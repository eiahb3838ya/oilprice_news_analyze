the
tokyo
commodity
exchange
tocom
may
start
trading
of
its
electric
power
futures
contract
as
early
as
january
part
of
an
effort
to
return
to
profitability
by
expanding
its
product
listings
its
chief
executive
officer
said
on
wednesday
in
march
japan
opened
its
electric
power
sector
to
competition
causing
the
country
s
utilities
to
embrace
more
spot
power
trading
with
volumes
on
the
japan
electric
power
exchange
more
than
quadrupling
the
demand
for
power
futures
on
tocom
to
help
utilities
to
manage
the
price
volatility
that
has
followed
the
spot
trading
surge
may
help
the
exchange
reverse
three
years
of
losses
incurred
amid
stiff
competition
with
futures
markets
in
china
and
singapore
the
spot
market
is
too
volatile
especially
in
the
summer
and
winter
said
tocom
chief
executive
officer
takamichi
hamada
said
in
an
interview
pointing
to
a
need
for
new
power
suppliers
to
be
able
to
hedge
in
the
futures
market
a
sweltering
summer
drove
prices
on
the
japan
electric
power
exchange
to
just
above
yen
per
kilowatt
hour
in
july
the
highest
on
record
as
new
entrants
scrambled
to
meet
the
demand
for
cooling
tocom
delayed
the
launch
of
the
electricity
futures
in
july
as
utilities
and
other
market
participants
needed
more
time
to
get
their
systems
in
place
hamada
wants
the
new
futures
contract
to
be
running
by
january
to
have
two
months
of
settlement
before
the
end
of
the
financial
year
in
march
tocom
reported
a
third
straight
year
of
losses
for
the
financial
year
but
hamada
is
hopeful
that
the
new
products
will
help
it
turn
to
profitable
this
year
cost
cut
marketing
to
broaden
participants
and
new
contracts
are
the
three
key
pillars
to
turn
us
around
he
said
last
financial
year
tocom
s
total
trading
volumes
were
million
contracts
only
about
a
quarter
of
the
record
million
contracts
traded
in
tocom
also
plans
to
boost
trading
volumes
by
adding
a
new
rubber
product
hamada
said
a
market
where
the
exchange
has
been
active
since
the
on
tocom
will
launch
new
technically
specified
rubber
tsr
futures
to
meet
growing
demand
for
the
product
the
exchange
s
existing
ribbed
smoked
sheet
rss
futures
have
been
a
benchmark
for
the
asian
rubber
market
since
they
were
first
offered
in
however
rubber
consumers
particularly
have
started
to
prefer
tsr
which
is
largely
machine
produced
and
is
considered
a
more
consistent
product
to
the
smoked
sheets
which
are
put
together
by
hand
and
can
have
some
variance
in
quality
tocom
s
new
tsr
contract
will
be
for
physical
delivery
on
a
free
on
board
fob
basis
at
two
ports
in
thailand
and
one
in
malaysia
trading
in
tsr
futures
on
the
singapore
exchange
tripled
between
and
while
tocom
s
rss
contract
volumes
have
fallen
by
more
than
a
tenth
singapore
s
tsr
is
mainly
linked
with
the
indonesian
product
but
our
tsr
meets
the
product
standard
in
thailand
the
world
s
biggest
natural
rubber
producer
hamada
said
adding
that
it
will
likely
attract
thai
producers
and
shippers
as
well
as
buyers
in
china
the
world
s
biggest
rubber
consumer
for
hedging
and
arbitrage

exchange

has
bypassed

with

in

times
