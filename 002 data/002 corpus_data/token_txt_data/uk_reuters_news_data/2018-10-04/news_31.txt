oil
traders
have
piled
into
wagers
that
crude
oil
could
surge
to
a
barrel
by
next
year
a
milestone
that
until
recently
many
considered
unthinkable
due
to
record
production
growth
and
relatively
flat
global
demand
but
the
imminent
return
of
sanctions
on
iran
and
bottlenecks
keeping
oil
from
getting
to
market
have
fueled
a
rally
that
has
taken
benchmark
oil
prices
to
highs
while
big
producing
nations
say
supply
is
ample
hedge
funds
and
speculators
are
increasingly
skeptical
of
that
argument
betting
the
market
could
rally
further
as
sanctions
on
iran
s
crude
exports
return
on
the
bullishness
is
visible
in
the

according
to

data
over
the
last
two
weeks
there
s
been
a
lot
more
evidence
that
even
some
of
the
larger
customers
india
and
china
are
not
going
to
be
buying
iranian
crude

group
as
a
result
he
said
these
sanctions
are
likely
to
be
a
lot
more
effective
than
people
even
overall
exports
from
iran
have
dropped
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
september
from
million
bpd
in
april
the
institute
of
international
finance
said
estimates
for
how
much
of
iran
s
exports
could
be
affected
range
from
bpd
to
million
bpd
and
uncertainty
over
the
impact
could
ultimately
foster
price
swings

either
direction

the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
renew
sanctions
on

prompted
a
sharp
shift
from
the

to
increase

saudi

agreed
privately
to
boost

an
effort
to
mollify
president
donald
trump
who
has
focused
his
anger
on
rising
prices
oil
markets
are
looking
to
opec
and
russia
to
make
up
shortfalls
in
supply
production
which
sits
at
a

million

can
not
replace
middle
east
crudes
such
as
iranian
grades
in
asian
refineries
in
addition
transportation
bottlenecks
are
constraining
output
we
continue
to
see
price
risks
tilted
to
the
upside

not

many

said
these

face
long

contracts
used
to
speculate
on

tend
to
be
cheap
and
if

stalls
those

expire
worthless
but
even
a

could
make
those

more
expensive
and

could
sell
them
