oil
prices
and
calendar
spreads
have
softened
significantly
this
month
as
traders
became
more
confident
about
the
availability
of
supplies
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
into
early
iran
s
exports
have
not
declined
as
much
as
predicted
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
it
is
now
clear
they
will
not
fall
to
zero
even
after
sanctions
are
next
month
refiners
in
turkey
india
and
possibly
china
are
reportedly
negotiating
with
officials
over
waivers
to
enable
them
to
continue
purchasing
at
least
some
iranian
oil
after
at
the
same
time
saudi
arabia
and
other
gulf
producers
have
boosted
their
exports
in
response
to
the
earlier
rise
in
prices
and
pressure
from
the
united
states
to
cool
the
market
traders
meanwhile
have
become
more
cautious
about
the
consumption
outlook
for
the
rest
of
with
most
indicators
pointing
to
a
loss
of
economic
momentum
outside
the
united
states
as
a
result
most
major
forecasters
are
now
predicting
a
significant
acceleration
in
oil
supplies
in
as
well
as
slower
growth
in
consumption
shifting
the
outlook
from
one
of
continuing
deficits
back
towards
a
surplus
in
part
the
improved
supply
picture
has
come
about
because
the
surge
in
oil
prices
during
august
and
september
forced
both
the
white
house
and
saudi
arabia
to
adapt
their
positions
the
united
states
has
softened
its
insistence
on
forcing
iran
s
exports
towards
zero
while
saudi
arabia
has
ramped
up
its
own
exports
in
october
and
november
to
alleviate
fears
about
a
possible
shortage
in
effect
the
oil
market
found
the
pain
threshold
for
the
administration
which
lies
at
around
per
barrel
for
brent
and
pushed
prices
high
enough
to
enforce
a
partial
course
correction
from
policymakers
as
the
supply
outlook
has
improved
traders
have
begun
to
scale
back
bets
on
a
crude
crunch
occurring
towards
the
end
of
the
year
hedge

sold

linked

total

with

retreating
from
a
high
of

below

as

nearby
futures

have
fallen
much
more
heavily
than

shifting
the
entire

steep

brent

a
backwardation

at

to
just

in

the
brent
calendar
spread
has
been
a
reliable
indicator
of
the
balance
and
the
recent
softening
of

is
