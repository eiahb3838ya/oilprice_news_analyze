update 1-carrots could be key to making greener buildings, say researchers
london

crunchy
and
tasty
yes
but
could
carrots
also
strengthen
cement
and
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
for
the
building
industry
a
group
of
researchers
at
britain
s
lancaster
university
has
been
using
a
household
food
blender
to
mix
particles
from
the
root
vegetable
with
concrete
to
see
if
they
can
produce
a
stronger
and
more
environmentally
sound
product
we
found
out
you
could
increase
the
strength
of
concrete
by
percent
by
using
a
small
amount
of
this
new
material
lead
researcher
mohamed
saafi
told
reuters
the
addition
of
carrots
prevent
any
cracks
in
the
concrete
the
team
said
it
also
means
less
cement
is
required
therefore
lowering
the
global
carbon
dioxide
output
cement
is
responsible
for
seven
percent
of
total
global
emissions
according
to
international
energy
agency
estimates
the
carrot
particles
are
provided
by
cellucomp
a
company
who
work
on
the
development
of
sustainable
materials
cellucomp
ceo
christian
explained
that
a
carrot
is
made
up
nearly
entirely
of
water
but
still
stays
rigid
and
crunchy
because
of
cellulose
a
fibrous
substance
found
in
all
plants
those
fibres
have
strength
characteristics
in
them
it
s
the
building
blocks
of
the
strength
of
a
vegetable
he
told
reuters
cellulose
is
also
found
in
wood
but
is
easier
to
extract
from
vegetables
with
large
amounts
of
vegetable
waste
available
as
a
byproduct
of
agriculture
it
is
a
cheap
and
environmentally
friendly
source
of
the
fibres
you
can
just
pop
a
few
of
these
fibres
into
other
materials
and
it
becomes
an
additive
that
gives
performance
characteristics
he
said
only
a
tiny
amount
of
cellulose
is
needed
to
alter
the
properties
of
cement
because
it
changes
the
way
water
behaves
during
the
process
when
cement
hardens
it
s
not
the
physical
fibre
that
s
causing
the
strength
it
s
the
way
it
holds
water
our
material
loves
to
hold
onto
water
there
is
a
chemical
reaction
happening
between
the
fibres
and
the
saafi
s
team
will
continue
to
test
their
mixtures
with
sugar
beets
also
being
used
as
cellucomp
can
get
large
amounts
of
inexpensive
beet
pulp
left
over
after
sugar
production
