the
czech
state
must
participate
in
the
country
s
nuclear
power
expansion
and
the
government
s
preferred
option
remains
being
second
in
line
behind
utility
cez
in
guaranteeing
the
project
the
industry
minister
said
on
friday
minister
marta
novakova
told
reuters
the
government
aims
to
pick
the
best
financing
model
for
the
dollar
construction
by
the
end
of
the
year
so
tender
preparations
can
get
underway
in
any
model
must
respect
minority
shareholders
in
percent
cez
central
europe
s
biggest
listed
utility
she
said
she
added
the
government
did
not
yet
have
analysis
of
the
impact
any
model
may
have
on
state
dividends
from
cez
which
put
billion
crowns
million
into
state
coffers
last
year
no
nuclear
power
unit
is
being
built
in
the
world
without
certain
participation
of
the
domestic
government
so
we
will
also
have
to
find
some
participation
even
here
she
said
the
world
s
main
six
nuclear
power
builders
are
all
vying
for
the
expansion
deal
long
under
discussion
in
the
czech
republic
since
cez
cancelled
an
original
tender
in
when
the
state
refused
to
provide
price
guarantees
cez
has
maintained
it
can
not
undertake
such
a
risky
project
without
state
backing
or
some
guarantees
safeguarding
investment
returns
the
state
has
debated
various
financing
models
that
include
possibly
a
of
cez
that
would
give
the
state
coal
and
nuclear
assets
while
spinning
off
the
new
energy
businesses
to
shareholders
or
the
state
could
acquire
and
develop
the
nuclear
project
itself
a
third
option
is
cez
undertaking
the
project
through
a
subsidiary
and
guaranteeing
it
itself
which
prime
minister
andrej
babis
has
backed
saying
it
is
big
enough
to
manage
it
the
minimum
guarantee
would
be
cez
would
guarantee
the
project
with
its
assets
and
the
czech
state
would
be
the
second
in
line
in
this
guarantee
novakova
said
this
is
the
option
the
government
would
like
the
most
in
this
she
said
agreement
must
be
found
with
shareholders
in
cez
which
has
remained
active
in
the
debate
the
government
will
decide
how
this
tender
process
looks
and
i
do
not
feel
any
resistance
from
the
side
of
cez
they
are
cooperating
she
said
when
asked
on
what
could
happen
if
the
two
sides
end
up
disagreeing
on
the
financial
model
the
project
to
expand
cez
s
nuclear
power
plant
fleet
is
the
biggest
investment
ever
into
czech
energy
cez
operates
two
plants
at
dukovany
and
temelin
that
together
covered
percent
of
czech
energy
needs
last
year
novakova
said
a
detailed
analysis
on
the
estimated
cost
will
follow
the
decision
on
financing
she
said
among
options
a
model
like
hungary
is
using
to
build
new
reactors
in
which
russia
s
rosatom
builds
the
unit
funded
by
a
billion
euro
loan
from
russia
is
not
preferred
but
she
added
she
could
not
rule
out
a
partial
supplier
model
of
financing
