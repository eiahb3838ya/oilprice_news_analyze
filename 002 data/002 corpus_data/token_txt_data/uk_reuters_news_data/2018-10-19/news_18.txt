schlumberger
nv
the
world
s
largest
oilfield
services
provider
reported
a
slight
profit
beat
on
friday
but
cautioned
that
north
american
growth
would
slow
due
to
transportation
bottlenecks
and
hurt
results
next
quarter
although
quarterly
profits
rose
from
a
year
ago
the
company
has
been
hit
by
growth
in
the
largest
permian
basin
production
has
outpaced
available
pipeline
takeaway
capacity
and
driven
prices
lower
but
schlumberger
expects
the
bottlenecks
to
be
resolved
in
the
next
to
months
the
north
america
land
market
is
changing
pretty
rapidly
chief
executive
officer
paal
kibsgaard
said
during
a
earnings
call
the
rapid
softening
in
both
hydraulic
fracturing
activity
and
pricing
seen
during
the
second
half
of
the
third
quarter
will
continue
at
the
same
pace
into
the
fourth
quarter
he
added
schlumberger
the
first
oilfield
service
provider
to
report
earnings
is
seen
as
a
bellwether
for
the
industry
the
company
warned
investors
last
month
that
slowing
activity
in
north
america
was
affecting
its
business
shares
of
schlumberger
were
up
percent
at
the
stock
hit
an
low
this
week
schlumberger
said
several
key
customers
were
opting
to
stop
using
hydraulic
fracturing
fleets
later
this
year
and
into
january
this
is
presenting
terms
challenges
in
terms
of
white
spaces
in
the
calendar
kibsgaard
said
the
company
reported
a
profit
of
million
or
cents
per
share
up
about
percent
from
a
year
ago
analysts
anticipated
earnings
of
cents
excluding
items
according
to
refinitiv
data
schlumberger
also
echoed
concerns
cited
on
previous
investor
calls
that
poor
oil
and
gas
reservoirs
and
well
performance
in
north
america
could
prompt
production
gains
to
fall
short
of
expectations
analysts
from
investment
firm
tudor
pickering
holt
co
said
the
results
were
within
expectations
but
unlikely
to
bring
investors
rushing
off
sidelines
and
back
into
the
sector
international
revenue
rose
percent
to
billion
while
revenue
from
north
america
jumped
about
percent
to
billion
we
may
have
seen
the
bottom
in
the
international
markets
the
commentary
seems
more
upbeat
said
brian
youngberg
an
edward
jones
analyst
total
revenue
rose
to
billion
from
billion
a
year
ago
analysts
looked
for
billion
