fight
pollution
the
latest
region
to
come
under
scrutiny
in
beijing
s
war
on
smog
in
its
latest
review
of
how
regions
are
complying
with
tougher
pollution
laws
the
ministry
of
ecology
and

singled
out
ningxia
for
criticism
on
the
day
china
said
the
country
s
coal
output
hit
its
highest
in
nine
months
in
september
some
districts
and
departments
in
ningxia
did
not
have
the
will
or
confidence
to
control
pollution
inspectors
said
in
a
report
in
the
china
environment
news
a
ministry
publication
they
said
ningxia
s
economic
and
trade
commission
had
submitted
reports
alleging
that
environmental
protection
was
a
burden
on
industrial
growth
the
commission
blamed
a
tougher
smog
control
and
inspection
regime
for
a
slowdown
in
industrial
activity
despite
what
inspectors
said
were
obvious
errors
in
the
commission
s
data
they
the
commission
tried
to
get
rid
of
their
responsibility
and
interfere
with
decision
making
the
inspectors
said
ningxia
a
poor
and
region
wants
to
exploit
its
reserves
of
coal
and
export
electricity
through
a
power
grid
but
it
has
been
forced
to
shut
down
small
coal
mines
and
millions
of
tonnes
of
annual
production
capacity
in
sectors
like
steel
and
aluminum
since
a
national
campaign
began
in
ningxia
is
the
latest
region
to
be
chastised
by
the
environment
ministry
for
failing
to
enforce
measures
three
cities
in
jiangsu
were
accused
this
week
of
exaggerating
coal
consumption
cuts
last
year
hebei
the
biggest
steel
producing
region
came
under
fire
on
thursday
with
inspectors
criticizing
some
officials
for
not
rectifying
previous
failings
in
controlling
pollution
hebei
s
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
remained
high
with
coal
accounting
for
percent
of
the
province
s
primary
energy
consumption
percentage
points
higher
than
the
national
average
the
ministry
said
officials
have
faced
some
form
of
punishment
as
a
result
of
the
latest
round
of
poor
environmental
reviews
in
the
three
regions
reported
so
far
officials
were
held
responsible
for
violations
of
which
were
reprimanded
and
detained
the
region
is
one
of
china
s
most
industrialized
with
hebei
province
producing
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
country
s
steel
it
has
been
on
the
front
line
of
the
country
s
war
on
pollution
for
more
than
four
years
the
region
is
about
to
embark
on
another
tough
winter
campaign
against
smog
with
inspectors
set
to
force
industrial
factories
to
curb
output
if
they
have
not
done
enough
to
clean
up
their
operations
vice
premier
han
zheng
said
on
thursday
authorities
must
ensure
residents
have
enough
heating
this
winter
even
as
thousands
of
households
switch
from
coal
to
cleaner
natural
gas
han
who
leads
a
committee
to
tackle
pollution
in
the
region
said
it
was
absolutely
forbidden
to
dismantle
boilers
and
leave
households
without
a
source
of
heat
the
xinhua
news
agency
said
parts
of
the
region
were
left
without
heating
last
year
after
governments
demolished
boilers
but
failed
to
secure
enough
natural
gas
as
a
replacement
fuel
hebei
was
home
to
four
of
china
s
cities
with
the
poorest
air
quality
according
to
data
for
the
first
nine
months
of
that
is
down
from
six
cities
