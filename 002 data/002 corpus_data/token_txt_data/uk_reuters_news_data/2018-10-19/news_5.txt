ukraine
secured
a
new
billion
aid
agreement
with
the
international
monetary
fund
on
friday
helping
the
country
maintain
financial
stability
and
the
trust
of
investors
as
it
heads
into
a
choppy
election
period
next
year
the
imf
announced
the
deal
hours
after
the
government
decided
to
raise
household
gas
prices
by
nearly
a
quarter
an
outstanding
imf
requirement
ukraine
s
prime
minister
had
warned
the
country
was
headed
for
default
without
an
imf
deal
but
the
gas
price
hike
triggered
fierce
criticism
from
opposition
politicians
giving
a
taste
of
the
backlash
that
is
likely
to
follow
the
new
agreement
would
span
months
and
replaces
the
previous
billion
aid
programme
that
has
propped
up
ukraine
s
economy
since
it
is
subject
to
ukraine
passing
a
budget
in
line
with
the
imf
s
requirements
and
the
approval
of
the
imf
s
executive
board
which
is
expected
to
take
a
decision
later
in
the
year
the
imf
said
the
new
sba
will
provide
an
anchor
for
the
authorities
economic
policies
during
an
imf
statement
said
it
will
focus
in
particular
on
continuing
with
fiscal
consolidation
and
reducing
inflation
as
well
as
reforms
to
strengthen
tax
administration
the
financial
sector
and
the
energy
the
new
deal
will
allow
the
government
which
must
service
a
rising
debt
burden
next
year
to
go
to
the
market
to
issue
new
debt
and
would
also
pave
the
way
for
the
european
union
and
other
foreign
donors
to
disburse
more
aid
acting
finance
minister
oksana
markarova
wrote
it
would
provide
a
safety
net
and
enable
our
government
to
benefit
from
concessional
financings
from
international
financial
institutions
and
continue
increasing
foreign
currency
reserves
currently
standing
at
over
usd
the
government
initially
had
agreed
to
raise
gas
prices
but
later
backtracked
knowing
the
potential
for
voter
anger
during
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
we
have
no
other
option
to
prevent
extremely
difficult
events
prime
minister
volodymyr
groysman
said
during
a
televised
cabinet
meeting
earlier
on
friday
if
we
are
not
able
to
continue
cooperation
with
our
international
partners
groysman
warned
then
the
country
will
not
be
able
to
service
its
debt
this
may
lead
to
the
situation
when
ukraine
will
be
put
into
default

said
a

increases
wage
ukraine
s
eurobonds
rose
across
the
curve
following
the
announcement
of
a
gas
price
hike
however
olena
babak
a
lawmaker
from
the
opposition
samopomich
party
told
the
news
channel
that
it
would
push
ukrainians
into
poverty
this
is
a
crime
against
ukraine
she
said
former
prime
minister
yulia
tymoshenko
who
hopes
to
unseat
president
petro
poroshenko
in
next
year
s
election
called
the
price
hike
a
genocide
against
the
ukrainian
people
and
asked
for
an
emergency
parliamentary
debate
the
imf
joined
efforts
to
rescue
ukraine
from
economic
crisis
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
the
outbreak
of
a
separatist
insurgency
but
imf
aid
had
effectively
been
frozen
since
april
as
ukraine
s
performance
on
reforms
slowed
down
and
due
to
the
government
s
refusal
to
raise
gas
prices
kept
artificially
low
since
soviet
times
to
market
levels
the
spotlight
will
now
be
on
discussions
on
the
budget
which
parliament
must
vote
on
by
the
end
of
the
year
one
sticking
point
could
be
ukraine
s
plans
for
a
change
to
how
companies
are
taxed
groysman
said
household
gas
prices
would
be
raised
by
percent
