to
combat
worsening
smog
pakistan
s
government
has
ordered
all
traditional
brick
kilns
closed
for
days
starting
saturday
as
it
promotes
new
cleaner
kilns
that
could
cut
pollution
up
to
percent
but
the
measure
has
produced
an
outcry
both
from
kiln
owners
who
want
incentives
to
make
the
switch
and
from
kiln
workers
who
fear
losing
income
how
i
will
provide
food
to
my
three
children
during
closure
of
the
kilns
asked
sumaira
bibi
who
with
her
husband
frames
up
bricks
a
day
for
a
kiln
near
islamabad
earning
about
under
the
government
order
all
traditional
kilns
must
shut
from
october
until
december
to
cut
smog
that
has
blighted
parts
of
punjab
province
and
other
areas
of
the
country
in
recent
years
pakistan
has
about
such
kilns
said
shoaib
khan
niazi
president
of
the
all
pakistan
brick
kiln
association
the
government
has
also
ordered
that
all
kilns
be
converted
to
technology
a
design
change
that
makes
more
efficient
use
of
fuel
according
to
the
pakistan
environmental
protection
agency
no
deadline
for
the
switch
has
been
set
an
internal
structure
in
kilns
combined
with
the
use
of
an
air
blower
can
cut
the
consumption
of
coal
slash
emissions
substantially
and
improve
the
quality
of
bricks
produced
said
malik
amin
aslam
an
adviser
to
prime
minister
imran
khan
on
climate
change
issues
traditional
kiln
owners
however
are
demanding
a
shutdown
of
no
more
than
a
month
and
insisting
on
government
help
to
make
the
design
change
mehar
abdul
haq
a
brick
kiln
owner
in
the
kasur
district
of
punjab
province
said
kilns
should
be
shut
for
a
maximum
of
days
or
only
on
days
when
there
is
smog
he
said
about
kilns
in
punjab
are
in
the
process
of
being
converted
to
technology
with
five
or
six
now
operating
using
it
the
international
centre
for
integrated
mountain
development
icimod
a
organisation
has
carried
out
two
training
programmes
on
the
technology
for
kiln
owners
in
pakistan
aiming
to
cut
smog
and
emissions
but
haq
said
converting
a
conventional
kiln
to
the
new
technology
costs
to
a
hefty
investment
we
have
demanded
the
government
either
give
loans
on
easy
terms
or
provide
loans
to
convert
to
the
technology
but
in
vain
he
said
efficient
but
inconvenient
niazi
of
the
brick
kiln
owner
s
association
said
a
closure
would
cause
unemployment
not
only
at
brick
kilns
but
in
the
coal
and
construction
industries
it
would
also
drive
up
the
cost
of
bricks
in
pakistan
he
said
he
said
an
average
of
to
people
worked
at
each
brick
kiln
neither
are
we
getting
financial
nor
technical
support
from
the
government
he
said
though
he
admitted
the
technology
was
environmentally
friendly
and
energy
efficient
the
technology
uses
to
percent
less
energy
than
traditional
kilns
and
cuts
the
costs
of
bricks
produced
by
up
to
half
niazi
said
a
punjab
spokesman
for
pakistan
s
environmental
protection
agency
said
brick
kilns
were
a
major
contributor
to
smog
along
with
vehicle
emissions
and
burning
of
crop
stubble
smog
is
a
particular
problem
from
late
october
through
in
pakistan
we
can
not
end
smog
at
all
but
we
are
trying
to
reduce
it
through
steps
at
all
levels
rehman
said
the
new
technology
has
benefits
for
kiln
owners
as
well
he
said
including
cost
and
time
savings
and
a
reduction
in
bricks
produced
what
we
are
seeing
is
that
this
technology
reduces
carbon
emissions
more
than
percent
he
said
which
means
those
kilns
using
technology
will
be
allowed
to
operate
during
smog
season
but
other
kiln
owners
should
expect
that
we
will
keep
on
shutting
these
kilns
after
intervals
to
force
them
to
covert
to
he
said
mome
saleem
an
environmentalist
said
the
closure
of
the
kilns
would
help
cut
smog
but
other
industries
needed
attention
too
the
government
should
formulate
an
inclusive
strategy
to
combat
the
smog
instead
of
just
shutting
the
kilns
she
suggested
arif
jeewa
former
chairman
of
the
association
of
builders
and
developers
of
pakistan
abad
said
a
shutdown
of
brick
kilns
would
have
no
impact
on
pakistan
s
commercial
construction
industry
because
it
relied
instead
on
cement
blocks
aslam
the
prime
minister
s
adviser
said
the
government
was
moving
now
to
try
to
avoid
smog
problems
in
the
months
to
come
we
are
shutting
down
brick
kilns
and
factories
that
emit
greenhouse
gases
in
excess
he
said
the
closure
will
have
an
economic
impact
but
so
does
their
continued
and
unabated
operation
which
has
a
huge
environmental
impact
