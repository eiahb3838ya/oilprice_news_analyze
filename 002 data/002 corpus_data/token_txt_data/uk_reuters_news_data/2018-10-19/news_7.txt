federal
reserve
officials
are
monitoring
the
case
of
missing
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
and
the
possibility
that
any
sanctions
against
saudi
arabia
could
disrupt
oil
markets
atlanta
fed
president
raphael
bostic
said
on
friday
asked
about
the
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
at
a
community
group
lunch
in
macon
georgia
bostic
mentioned
geopolitical
risks
generally
the
brexit
talks
and
the
saudi
arabian
situation
and
the
question
about
whether
what
happened
to
that
journalist
is
going
to
lead
to
sanctions
that
could
impact
oil
his
comments
the
first
by
a
central
banker
about
the
case
reflect
how
it
has
escalated
from
a
diplomatic
dispute
between
saudi
arabia
and
turkey
to
an
international
incident
with
the
potential
to
roil
financial
markets
khashoggi
went
missing
after
entering
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
to
obtain
documents
for
a
forthcoming
marriage
turkish
officials
believe
he
was
killed
in
the
building
but
riyadh
has
denied
the
allegations
bostic
singled
out
the
possible
fallout
if
the
united
states
or
other
countries
determine
that
top
saudi
officials
were
behind
khashoggi
s
possible
murder
and
begin
imposing
penalties
on
riyadh
we
don
t
know
what
is
going
to
happen
bostic
said
but
one
thing
we
will
do
is
monitor
the
economy
and
these
developments
as
closely
as
oil
prices
rose
about
percent
on
friday
on
signs
of
surging
demand
in
china
although
the
market
was
headed
for
a
second
week
of
losses
on
rising
inventories
and
concern
that
trade
wars
were
curbing
economic
activity
bostic
said
he
saw
little
risk
to
a
economy
that
is
chugging
along
with
very
low
unemployment
and
inflation
at
the
fed
s
percent
target
to
what
extent
can
we
keep
that
going
all
the
conversations
i
have
suggest
the
answer
is
that
there
are
no
significant
dark
clouds
on
the
horizon
he
said
bostic
did
not
comment
on
his
current
monetary
policy
views
though
he
recently
said
he
was
open
to
a
further
interest
rate
increase
in
december
depending
on
how
the
economy
evolves
the
fed
has
raised
rates
three
times
this
year
and
is
widely
expected
to
lift
borrowing
costs
again
at
its
december
policy
meeting
