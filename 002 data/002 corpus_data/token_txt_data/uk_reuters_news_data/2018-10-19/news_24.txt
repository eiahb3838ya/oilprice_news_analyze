carrots could be key to making greener buildings, say researchers

crunchy
and
tasty
yes
but
could
carrots
also
strengthen
cement
and
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
for
the
building
industry
a
group
of
researchers
at
britain
s
lancaster
university
has
been
using
a
household
food
blender
to
mix
particles
from
the
root
vegetable
with
concrete
to
see
if
they
can
produce
a
stronger
and
more
environmentally
sound
product
we
found
out
you
could
increase
the
strength
of
concrete
by
percent
by
using
a
small
amount
of
this
new
material
lead
researcher
mohamed
saafi
told
reuters
the
addition
of
carrots
prevent
any
cracks
in
the
concrete
the
team
said
it
also
means
less
cement
is
required
therefore
lowering
the
global
carbon
dioxide
output
cement
is
responsible
for
seven
percent
of
total
global
emissions
according
to
international
energy
agency
estimates
our
preliminary
results
show
that
adding
about
half
a
kilogram
of
carrot
nanomaterial
will
reduce
about
kilograms
of
cement
per
one
cubic
metre
of
concrete
saafi
said
the
team
have
also
tried
sugar
beet
fibres
in
cement
mixtures
with
all
their
vegetables
coming
from
food
waste
they
will
continue
to
test
their
mixtures
alongside
their
commercial
partners
a
scottish
company
which
makes
paint
using
root
vegetable
fibres
