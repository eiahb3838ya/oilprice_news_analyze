update 3-russia and uzbekistan launch work on nuclear power plant
tashkent
reuters
russia
and
uzbekistan
began
preliminary
work
on
friday
on
the
first
uzbek
nuclear
power
plant
a
project
moscow
estimates
will
cost
billion
the
plant
to
be
largely
financed
by
a
soft
loan
from
russia
will
allow
uzbekistan
to
use
more
of
its
natural
gas
for
other
purposes
such
as
chemicals
production
or
export
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
uzbek
president
shavkat
mirziyoyev
pressed
a
symbolic
button
together
at
a
ceremony
in
a
conference
hall
in
tashkent
to
mark
the
start
of
geological
surveying
to
decide
on
a
location
for
the
facility
uzbekistan
expects
to
pour
first
concrete
no
earlier
than
because
of
the
project
s
complexity
the
gigawatt
plant
is
expected
to
start
producing
power
in
today
most
electric
power
in
uzbekistan
is
generated
by
gas
turbines
but
the
country
wants
to
extract
more
added
value
from
its
gas
reserves
the
nuclear
project
launch
was
a
highlight
of
putin
s
state
visit
to
tashkent
which
saw
the
two
sides
also
signed
a
number
of
other
agreements
including
in
the
energy
sector
russia
s
gazprom
signed
a
agreement
for
the
dzhel
gas
field
where
it
aims
to
produce
about
million
cubic
metres
a
year
at
peak
a
small
project
by
the
region
s
standards
lukoil
signed
a
memorandum
on
exploration
work
and
russian
businessman
andrei
filatov
signed
an
agreement
with
an
uzbek
state
firm
over
a
project
to
develop
a
gas
field
and
build
a
chemical
plant
producing
the
same
amount
of
energy
as
a
nuclear
power
plant
using
modern
gas
turbines
would
consume
more
than
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
a
year
according
to
jurabek
mirzamahmudov
head
of
uzbekistan
s
nuclear
energy
agency
uzatom
this
is
feedstock
for
one
petrochemicals
plant
which
could
produce
half
a
million
tonnes
of
polymers
he
told
reporters
this
week
uzbekistan
also
exports
gas
by
pipeline
to
russia
and
china
and
the
latter
in
particular
has
steadily
increased
energy
purchases
from
central
asia
mirzamahmudov
said
it
was
possible
uzbekistan
would
add
two
more
blocks
to
the
plant
in
the
future
doubling
its
capacity
so
far
however
the
cost
is
not
final
even
for
the
first
two
blocks
moscow
has
put
it
at
billion
but
mirzamahmudov
said
talks
on
the
matter
would
start
next
year
and
tashkent
hoped
the
figure
could
be
reduced
