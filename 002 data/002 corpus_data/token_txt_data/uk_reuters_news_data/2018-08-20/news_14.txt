sweden calls for nuclear reactors to be shielded from hot weather
oslo
reuters
sweden
s
nuclear
energy
regulator
ssm
has
asked
plant
operators
to
produce
plans
in
the
coming
months
to
shield
their
reactors
from
harmful
hot
weather
its
director
told
reuters
on
monday
a
number
of
swedish
reactors
had
to
shut
down
or
reduce
output
as
the
summer
heatwave
sent
temperatures
to
record
highs
in
july
with
the
sea
water
that
is
used
to
cool
them
becoming
much
warmer
than
normal
exceeding
safety
levels
the
last
time
that
ssm
the
swedish
radiation
safety
authority
asked
operators
to
produce
plans
to
modify
their
reactors
was
after
japan
s
fukushima
disaster
in
the
cost
of
those
changes
which
are
due
by
was
in
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
we
really
have
to
take
into
consideration
what
happened
this
summer
we
have
asked
them
orally
to
come
with
suggestions
of
course
there
will
be
a
cost
i
do
not
know
how
much
at
this
stage
said
ssm
chief
mats
persson
said
the
cost
of
modifications
to
swedish
nuclear
plants
reached
as
much
as
million
euros
million
per
reactor
persson
said
persson
said
the
regulator
had
asked
vattenfall
and
uniper
subsidiary
okg
to
consider
how
they
could
shield
their
swedish
reactors
and
notify
ssm
in
the
autumn
to
enable
it
to
make
a
decision
on
the
best
options
i
hope
we
will
have
results
by
the
end
of
this
year
it
is
important
that
we
don
t
come
to
the
same
situation
again
he
said
vattenfall
which
operates
seven
reactors
in
sweden
shut
a
megawatt
mw
unit
one
of
the
four
located
at
its
ringhals
plant
in
july
as
water
temperatures
rose
above
degrees
celsius
the
company
s
second
plant
at
forsmark
consists
of
three
bwrs
and
vattenfall
had
to
reduce
output
by
megawatt
per
reactor
as
the
sea
water
in
the
area
climbed
to
more
than
degrees
celsius
sweden
s
biggest
reactor
the
gw
oskarshamn
was
not
affected
and
should
be
less
vulnerable
to
very
hot
summers
because
of
the
depth
from
which
it
takes
its
sea
water
a
spokesman
for
operator
okg
has
said
