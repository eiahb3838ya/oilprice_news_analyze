update 2-australia weakens commitment to climate accord after government fractures
sydney
reuters
australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
on
monday
stripped
requirements
for
reducing
greenhouse
emissions
from
his
centerpiece
energy
policy
in
the
face
of
political
opposition
although
the
country
remains
a
signatory
to
the
paris
agreement
while
stopping
short
of
following
the
lead
of
president
donald
trump
and
withdrawing
from
the
global
climate
accord
australia
removed
requirements
from
its
national
energy
guarantee
plan
that
would
have
mandated
that
greenhouse
emissions
from
its
power
industry
decrease
by
percent
from
levels
by
as
australia
s
east
coast
suffers
through
its
worst
drought
in
years
turnbull
said
he
would
seek
to
legislate
emission
reductions
in
the
future
he
added
that
his
government
would
move
legislation
to
reduce
emissions
when
it
had
sufficient
support
from
its
own
party
despite
the
impasse
turnbull
said
the
government
was
committed
to
its
paris
accord
commitments
the
legislation
to
move
forward
with
the
emissions
component
of
the
national
energy
guarantee
will
not
be
able
to
pass
the
house
of
representatives
turnbull
told
reporters
in
canberra
turnbull
has
a
parliamentary
majority
of
just
one
with
several
lawmakers
vowing
they
would
not
support
any
legislated
emission
reductions
such
mandates
are
likely
to
remain
elusive
until
at
least
a
year
the
decision
drew
immediate
scorn
from
critics
who
dismissed
suggestions
that
a
reduction
could
be
achieved
without
mandated
legislation
the
announcement
is
a
setback
for
global
action
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
said
will
steffen
a
climate
scientist
at
the
australian
national
university
australia
is
a
global
lagger
in
meeting
its
emission
targets
he
added
independent
research
shows
emissions
are
creeping
up
over
the
last
three
years
i
m
very
skeptical
that
without
immediate
action
australia
can
meet
it
australia
one
of
the
largest
carbon
emitters
per
capita
because
of
its
reliance
on
power
plants
is
among
nearly
countries
committed
to
the
paris
agreement
the
united
states
in
became
the
only
signatory
to
withdraw
from
the
accord
australia
s
national
energy
guarantee
was
supposed
to
end
a
decade
of
infighting
about
how
australia
could
boost
power
reliability
while
reducing
carbon
emissions
but
by
requiring
australia
s
electricity
sector
to
reduce
emissions
by
percent
old
wounds
were
reopened
which
split
the
government
along
ideological
grounds
conservatives
led
by
former
prime
minister
tony
abbott
who
committed
australia
to
the
paris
accord
when
he
led
the
country
argue
reducing
emissions
puts
australia
at
an
economic
disadvantage
after
the
united
states
withdrew
from
the
paris
accord
in
the
message
resonates
with
rural
voters
a
key
electorate
for
turnbull
a
social
liberal
who
throughout
his
political
career
has
voiced
support
for
addressing
climate
change
it
s
a
complete
capitulation
to
the
members
of
the
liberal
party
of
australia
who
want
to
perpetuate
australia
s
coal
economy
said
robyn
eckersley
professor
and
head
of
political
science
at
university
of
melbourne
turnbull
s
move
may
relieve
immediate
pressure
though
internal
peace
is
seen
as
fragile
as
the
government
s
prospects
look
dim
the
change
also
drew
criticism
from
australia
s
energy
sector
the
stakes
are
too
high
for
partisan
and
personal
politics
to
spoil
this
opportunity
to
move
energy
policy
into
the
century
said
andrew
richards
chief
executive
officer
at
the
energy
users
association
of
australia
with
turnbull
struggling
to
unite
the
party
local
media
reported
home
affairs
minister
peter
dutton
was
considering
a
leadership
challenge
australia
has
seen
five
different
leaders
since
turnbull
however
moved
to
quell
the
reports
peter
dutton
was
at
our
leadership
group
meeting
this
morning
and
he
was
at
the
cabinet
last
night
he
s
a
member
of
our
team
he
s
given
me
his
absolute
support
turnbull
said
a
widely
watched
poll
on
monday
shows
support
for
turnbull
has
crashed
to
its
lowest
level
since
december
the
ipsos
poll
published
in
fairfax
newspapers
shows
that
although
turnbull
is
still
personally
more
popular
than
opposition
labor
leader
bill
shorten
support
for
his
coalition
fell
four
points
to
percent
points
behind
labor
and
enough
for
a
crushing
electoral
defeat
michiel
schaeffer
science
director
at
climate
analytics
a
research
group
predicted
that
australia
would
eventually
toughen
climate
action
against
a
backdrop
of
record
drought
in
new
south
wales
and
a
very
early
bushfire
season
starting
interests
in
australia
have
again
won
out
over
the
government
moving
forward
on
climate
change
he
told
reuters
in
an
email
yet
despite
all
this
renewable
energy
continues
to
march
inexorably
forward
especially
at
state
level
he
added
ultimately
climate
action
will
be
inevitable
