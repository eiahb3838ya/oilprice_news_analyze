reuters
india
s
coal
imports
appear
headed
for
another
strong
month
in
august
raising
the
question
as
to
why
the
usually
market
hasn
t
scaled
back
purchases
given
a
surge
in
prices
to
the
highest
in
nearly
seven
years
total
coal
imports
may
reach
million
tonnes
in
august
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
this
figure
may
be
revised
as
it
becomes
clearer
when
ships
will
arrive
and
discharge
their
cargoes
but
the
august
imports
are
likely
to
be
more
or
less
in
line
with
the
million
tonnes
imported
in
july
which
was
the
strongest
monthly
outcome
so
far
in
but
no
matter
what
the
exact
level
of
imports
turns
out
to
be
india
s
coal
imports
have
been
exceptionally
strong
and
are
on
track
to
rise
for
the
first
year
in
three
in
this
is
despite
prices
for
thermal
coal
rising
to
the
highest
in
years
with
the
australian
benchmark
newcastle
cargoes
trading
above
a
tonne
recently
taking
the
gain
to
around
percent
the
gain
in
prices
has
been
largely
driven
by
strong
chinese
imports
partly
because
of
output
restrictions
at
domestic
mines
and
partly
because
of
high
demand
caused
by
a
recent
heatwave
previously
indian
coal
imports
especially
for
thermal
grades
used
to
generate
electricity
have
been
thought
to
be
sensitive
to
price
and
likely
to
decline
if
prices
moved
rapidly
higher
as
they
have
done
this
year
but
indian
imports
have
been
on
an
upward
trend
in
recent
months
despite
the
rising
prices
an
easy
answer
as
to
why
is
to
point
to
the
recent
difficulties
state
miner
coal
india
has
experienced
in
transporting
the
polluting
fuel
from
pits
to
power
plants
but
as
tim
buckley
director
of
energy
finance
studies
at
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
ieefa
pointed
out
in
a
recent
note
there
is
more
to
the
situation
data
from
india
s
central
electricity
authority
show
that
coal
imports
for
what
are
termed
power
plants
those
that
supply
power
to
the
network
are
actually
declining
falling
percent
in
the
june
quarter
so
as
far
as
thermal
coal
imports
for
the
power
sector
are
concerned
the
price
signal
is
working
insofar
as
they
are
declining
as
prices
rise
however
as
buckley
notes
a
large
part
of
india
s
coal
imports
are
used
by
consumers
other
than
power
plants
there
is
a
about
gigawatts
gw
of
generation
capacity
that
is
used
by
captive
power
plants
buckley
said
in
a
recent
paper
sent
to
reuters
these
users
include
aluminium
smelters
cement
makers
and
other
industrial
users
and
they
are
more
reliant
on
coal
imports
as
their
demand
isn
t
prioritised
by
coal
india
effectively
meaning
they
are
last
in
line
for
domestic
supplies
if
this
gw
was
run
at
percent
capacity
it
would
need
about
million
tonnes
of
thermal
coal
a
year
buckley
said
a
figure
that
represents
about
of
current
thermal
coal
imports
given
these
consumers
have
to
run
their
captive
power
plants
in
order
to
produce
their
goods
they
have
no
option
but
to
turn
to
imports
when
coal
india
can
t
meet
their
needs
thus
it
appears
that
as
much
as
of
india
s
current
coal
import
demand
is
from
buyers
that
aren
t
price
sensitive
this
likely
means
that
coal
imports
will
remain
robust
at
least
for
as
long
as
coal
india
is
struggling
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
various
consumers
of
the
fuel
this
dynamic
of
captive
users
importing
coal
also
appears
to
be
shifting
the
buying
patterns
of
india
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
india
s
coal
imports
totalled
million
tonnes
with
indonesia
the
largest
supplier
at
million
however
indonesia
s
share
of
imports
is
declining
running
at
percent
of
the
total
so
far
in
down
from
percent
for
the
whole
of
in
contrast
south
africa
s
share
of
indian
imports
in
the
first
seven
months
of
rose
to
percent
from
percent
for
while
that
of
the
united
states
rose
to
percent
from
percent
south
africa
and
the
united
states
supply
higher
grades
of
coal
with
greater
energy
content
than
indonesia
it
makes
sense
for
plant
buyers
in
india
to
seek
higher
quality
coal
as
it
maximises
the
output
from
their
plants
australia
s
share
of
india
s
imports
is
also
up
rising
to
percent
in
the
first
seven
months
of
from
percent
in
however
virtually
all
of
australia
s
exports
are
coking
coal
used
in
and
the
increase
is
likely
a
reflection
of
rising
domestic
steel
production
as
well
as
the
paucity
of
indian
supplies
of
this
type
of
coal
