sydney

australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
on
monday
averted
a
possible
leadership
challenge
by
dropping
targets
for
cutting
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
appease
his
critics
say
local
media
as
a
poll
showed
his
government
losing
voter
support
conservatives
in
his
coalition
were
reportedly
sounding
out
colleagues
for
a
possible
leadership
challenge
before
turnbull
on
monday
announced
the
removal
of
emission
reduction
targets
from
the
national
energy
guarantee
neg
policy
under
headlines
such
as
pm
s
leadership
on
knife
edge
major
papers
said
some
government
members
were
gauging
support
for
home
affairs
minister
peter
dutton
to
replace
turnbull
dutton
said
he
supported
the
prime
minister
asked
whether
his
leadership
was
under
threat
turnbull
declared
i
enjoy
the
confidence
of
the
cabinet
and
my
party
room
the
leadership
talk
was
fuelled
by
an
ipsos
poll
published
in
fairfax
newspapers
which
showed
support
for
turnbull
s
coalition
falling
four
points
to
percent
points
behind
opposition
party
labor
and
enough
for
a
crushing
electoral
defeat
the
next
election
is
due
by
turnbull
said
his
slim
parliamentary
majority
and
internal
dissent
with
some
government
members
saying
they
would
vote
against
the
energy
policy
left
him
no
option
but
to
remove
the
emission
cuts
that
were
part
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
politics
is
governed
by
the
iron
laws
of
arithmetic
and
in
a
house
of
representatives
with
a
majority
if
a
small
number
of
people
are
not
prepared
to
vote
with
the
government
on
a
measure
then
it
won
t
get
passed
turnbull
told
reporters
though
australia
remains
a
signatory
to
the
paris
accord
the
removal
of
emissions
targets
from
the
neg
mean
the
country
has
no
legislative
or
regulatory
path
to
meeting
the
agreement
s
requirements
turnbull
s
move
may
relieve
immediate
pressure
on
his
leadership
though
internal
peace
is
seen
as
fragile
as
the
government
s
prospects
look
dim
and
having
conceded
on
energy
he
may
face
demands
for
other
changes
it
s
a
complete
capitulation
to
the
members
of
the
liberal
party
of
australia
said
robyn
eckersley
professor
and
head
of
political
science
at
university
of
melbourne
turnbull
is
desperately
hanging
on
to
his
leadership
above
and
beyond
everything
in
turnbull
then
leader
of
the
liberal
party
in
opposition
crossed
the
floor
to
vote
with
the
labor
government
in
favour
of
an
emissions
trading
scheme
a
move
that
ultimately
lost
him
the
party
leadership
a
successful
challenge
to
turnbull
s
prime
ministership
would
have
been
the
fifth
change
in
national
leadership
since
with
no
prime
minister
seeing
out
a
full
term
in
office
since
