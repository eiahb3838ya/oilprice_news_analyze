south
sudanese
lawmakers
approved
a
percent
increase
in
public
spending
in
the
budget
on
monday
though
ministers
did
not
spell
out
where
the
cash
would
come
from
in
an
economy
ravaged
by
nearly
five
years
of
civil
war
finance
minister
salvatore
garang
mabiordit
told
parliament
that
the
planned
budget
of
billion
south
sudanese
pounds
million
was
based
on
our
own
resources
not
on
expected
grants
or
loans
from
donors
south
sudan
s
only
significant
economic
resource
is
oil
but
fighting
has
forced
operators
to
shut
down
many
fields
and
output
is
less
than
half
its
level
of
barrels
per
day
fighting
broke
out
between
troops
loyal
to
president
salva
kiir
and
his
former
deputy
turned
rival
riek
machar
in
late
less
that
three
years
after
south
sudan
declared
independence
from
sudan
amid
celebrations
and
promises
of
support
from
major
world
powers
earlier
this
month
kiir
granted
an
amnesty
to
rebels
including
machar
after
a
series
of
failed
peace
deals
and
broken
ceasefires
and
there
have
been
no
reports
of
major
fighting
since
but
the
ethnically
charged
violence
which
has
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
and
forced
nearly
four
million
to
flee
their
homes
according
to
figures
has
left
the
finances
of
the
world
s
youngest
country
in
tatters
inflation
has
been
in
the
triple
digits
at
various
stages
during
the
conflict
with
hyperinflation
persisting
for
several
years
due
in
part
to
its
depreciating
currency
the
minister
said
percent
of
approved
spending
would
go
on
salaries
which
he
said
previously
up
percent
of
spending
without
specifying
when
he
did
not
say
how
much
would
be
spent
on
the
military
and
other
security
costs
typically
the
largest
expenditure
category
saying
only
that
peace
is
expensive
without
giving
details
in
the
previous
fiscal
year
mabiordit
said
the
country
s
mps
had
each
received
loans
from
the
government
of
to
buy
cars
such
loans
had
not
been
included
in
this
year
s
budget
