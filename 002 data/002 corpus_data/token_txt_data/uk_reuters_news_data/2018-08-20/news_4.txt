iran
used
a
similar
system
between
and
to
circumvent
sanctions
which
were
effective
in
curtailing
exports
because
of
a
lack
of
insurance
for
the
shipments
it
was
not
immediately
clear
how
iran
would
provide
insurance
for
the
chinese
oil
purchases
worth
some
billion
a
month
insurance
usually
includes
cover
for
the
oil
cargoes
liability
and
pollution
this
is
not
the
first
time
companies
exercised
the
option
whenever
there
is
a
need
the
buyers
can
use
that
said
another
of
the
