brazilian
beer
maker
ambev
plans
to
add
volkswagen
electric
trucks
to
its
fleet
making
it
the
largest
fleet
of
its
kind
in
brazil
and
which
would
be
exempt
from
new
fixed
minimum
freight
fares
for
diesel
truckers
ambev
said
ownership
of
the
vehicles
which
will
replace
older
trucks
will
be
with
logistics
companies
that
distribute
ambev
s
products
it
declined
to
name
the
companies
roberto
cortes
chief
executive
of
volkswagen
s
bus
and
trucks
operation
in
brazil
told
reuters
that
negotiations
with
ambev
had
long
preceded
the
new
policy
which
came
into
effect
this
month
the
timing
was
pure
coincidence
he
said
though
he
acknowledged
the
rule
could
lead
clients
to
rethink
their
fleets
ambev
s
plan
which
had
not
yet
been
firmed
up
follows
a
truckers
strike
in
may
that
severely
hampered
the
flow
of
food
fuel
and
key
exports
for
nearly
two
weeks
and
forced
the
government
to
promise
changes
this
month
the
government
signed
those
promises
into
law
including
a
minimum
fare
for
freight
to
be
paid
to
diesel
truckers
which
is
now
higher
than
the
current
market
rate
electric
vehicles
are
exempt
from
the
price
minimums
it
s
obvious
that
a
strike
of
that
nature
calls
attention
to
the
need
of
having
products
that
are
alternatives
to
diesel
trucks
cortes
said
still
we
are
not
expecting
any
sales
directly
caused
by
this
volvo
ab
and
the
truck
unit
of
daimler
ag
have
received
inquiries
from
companies
considering
another
option
to
avoid
price
minimums
buying
their
own
truck
fleets
instead
of
relying
on
contractors
brazil
s
largest
logistics
company
jsl
expects
its
truck
rental
unit
to
grow
as
it
rents
out
vehicles
directly
to
companies
another
exemption
from
the
new
rule
jsl
chief
financial
officer
denys
ferrez
said
although
the
company
has
not
received
any
firm
orders
with
the
electric
trucks
about
percent
of
ambev
s
fleet
will
be
electric
which
the
companies
said
will
save
about
tons
of
carbon
emissions
per
year
it
expects
the
trucks
will
be
delivered
by
the
story
corrects
to
show
ambev
will
not
buy
the
trucks
