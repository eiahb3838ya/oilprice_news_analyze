australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
on
monday
stripped
requirements
for
reducing
greenhouse
emissions
from
his
centrepiece
energy
policy
in
the
face
of
political
opposition
although
the
country
remains
a
signatory
to
the
paris
agreement
the
national
energy
guarantee
had
mandated
that
greenhouse
emissions
from
its
power
industry
be
lowered
by
percent
from
levels
by
with
australia
s
east
coast
in
the
middle
of
the
worst
drought
in
years
turnbull
said
his
government
would
seek
to
legislate
emission
reductions
in
the
future
he
gave
no
timetable
for
revisiting
the
issue
but
said
his
government
is
committed
to
its
paris
accord
commitments
the
legislation
to
move
forward
with
the
emissions
component
of
the
national
energy
guarantee
will
not
be
able
to
pass
the
house
of
representatives
turnbull
told
reporters
in
canberra
the
decision
drew
immediate
scorn
from
critics
who
argued
it
was
meaningless
to
be
committed
to
a
treaty
without
working
to
hit
its
targets
it
s
a
complete
capitulation
to
the
right
wing
members
of
the
liberal
party
of
australia
who
want
to
perpetuate
australia
s
coal
economy
said
robyn
eckersley
professor
and
head
of
political
science
at
university
of
melbourne
conservatives
led
by
former
prime
minister
tony
abbott
argue
reducing
emissions
puts
australia
at
an
economic
disadvantage
after
the
united
states
withdrew
from
the
paris
accord
in
the
message
resonates
with
rural
voters
a
key
electorate
for
turnbull
australia
s
government
has
fractured
in
recent
days
after
a
handful
of
ruling
lawmakers
said
they
would
vote
against
the
national
energy
guarantee
which
aimed
to
lower
energy
bills
for
voters
improve
reliability
while
meeting
commitments
to
lower
carbon
emissions
turnbull
s
move
may
relieve
immediate
pressure
though
internal
peace
is
seen
as
fragile
as
the
government
s
prospects
look
dim
the
change
also
drew
criticism
from
australia
s
energy
sector
one
of
the
things
that
s
been
missing
in
the
whole
energy
sector
is
certainty
around
carbon
policy
that
s
what
has
stalled
investment
and
this
just
continues
that
carl
kitchen
a
spokesman
for
the
australian
energy
council
said
of
the
decision
to
remove
emissions
targets
with
turnbull
a
social
liberal
who
supports
fighting
climate
change
struggling
to
unite
the
party
local
media
reported
home
affairs
minister
peter
dutton
was
considering
a
leadership
challenge
australia
has
seen
five
different
leaders
since
turnbull
however
moved
to
quell
the
reports
peter
dutton
was
at
our
leadership
group
meeting
this
morning
and
he
was
at
the
cabinet
last
night
he
s
a
member
of
our
team
he
s
given
me
his
absolute
support
turnbull
said
a
widely
watched
poll
on
monday
shows
support
for
turnbull
has
crashed
to
its
lowest
level
since
december
the
ipsos
poll
published
in
fairfax
newspapers
shows
that
although
turnbull
is
still
personally
more
popular
than
opposition
labor
leader
bill
shorten
support
for
his
coalition
fell
four
points
to
percent
points
behind
labor
and
enough
for
a
crushing
electoral
defeat
