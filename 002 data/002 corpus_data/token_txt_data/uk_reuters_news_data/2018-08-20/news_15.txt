poland
unlike
germany
strongly
opposes
russia
s
plan
to
build
a
new
gas
pipeline
across
the
baltic
sea
and
shares
opinion
that
the
project
would
help
strengthen
moscow
s
market
position
polish
foreign
minister
jacek
czaputowicz
said
berlin
has
given
political
support
to
the
building
of
a
new
billion
pipeline
to
bring
russian
gas
across
the
baltic
sea
called
nord
stream
bypassing
traditional
routes
through
ukraine
despite
qualms
among
other
eu
states
in
july
president
donald
trump
publicly
criticised
germany
for
supporting
the
pipeline
deal
with
russia
i
would
like
to
underline
that
poland
s
stance
differs
here
from
the
german
one
we
see
this
dispute
as
an
existing
one
between
the
and
germany
czaputowicz
said
at
a
joint
statement
with
his
german
counterpart
heiko
maas
poland
buys
most
of
the
gas
it
consumes
from
russia
but
has
taken
steps
to
reduce
that
reliance
in
this
dispute
we
are
at
the
side
as
its
arguments
are
more
convincing
and
besides
we
have
raised
them
before
czaputowicz
also
said
in
a
broadcast
speech
he
reiterated
poland
s
concerns
that
nord
stream
was
a
harmful
and
political
project
that
will
strengthen
russia
s
dominant
position
in
the
gas
market
and
be
a
threat
to
ukraine
i
know
about
these
objections
but
the
german
government
does
not
share
them
maas
said
the
foreign
ministers
spoke
in
harmeze
south
of
poland
near
the
auschwitz
nazi
death
camp
which
maas
visited
earlier
on
monday
