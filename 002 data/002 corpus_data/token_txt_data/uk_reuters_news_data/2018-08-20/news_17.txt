ankara
reuters
iran
urged
europe
on
monday
to
speed
up
efforts
to
salvage
a
nuclear
deal
between
tehran
and
major
powers
that
president
donald
trump
abandoned
in
may
saying
french
oil
group
total
has
formally
pulled
out
a
major
gas
project
efforts
by
the
remaining
signatories
eu
members
britain
france
and
germany
plus
china
and
russia
to
avoid
the
agreement
s
collapse
are
struggling
as
washington
has
said
any
firms
dealing
with
teheran
will
be
barred
from
doing
business
in
the
united
states
europeans
and
other
signatories
of
the
deal
have
been
trying
to
save
the
deal
but
the
process
has
been
slow
it
should
be
accelerated
foreign
ministry
spokesman
bahram
qasemi
said
iran
relies
mainly
on
its
own
capabilities
to
overcome
america
s
new
sanctions
he
told
a
news
conference
broadcast
on
state
tv
european
states
have
been
scrambling
to
ensure
iran
gets
enough
economic
benefits
to
persuade
it
to
stay
in
the
deal
which
trump
said
was
deeply
flawed
washington
imposed
new
sanctions
on
iran
in
august
targeting
its
trade
in
gold
and
other
precious
metals
purchases
of
dollars
and
its
car
industry
the
european
powers
china
and
russia
say
they
will
do
more
to
encourage
their
businesses
to
remain
engaged
with
iran
but
the
threat
of
the
sanctions
has
prompted
many
major
companies
to
pull
out
of
iran
oil
minister
bijan
namdar
zanganeh
said
france
s
total
has
formally
left
a
contract
to
develop
iran
s
south
pars
gas
project
the
process
to
replace
total
with
another
company
is
underway
he
was
quoted
as
saying
by
state
tv
total
which
signed
the
deal
in
with
an
initial
investment
of
billion
confirmed
that
it
had
notified
the
iranian
authorities
of
its
withdrawal
from
the
deal
after
it
failed
to
obtain
a
waiver
from
sanctions
iranian
officials
had
earlier
suggested
that
china
s
cnpc
could
take
over
total
s
stake
in
the
offshore
project
cnpc
which
already
has
a
percent
stake
in
the
deal
is
an
experienced
onshore
oil
and
gas
producer
but
is
relatively
new
to
offshore
drilling
as
for
the
future
of
total
s
share
we
have
not
been
informed
of
an
official
cnpc
position
but
as
we
have
always
said
cnpc
a
chinese
company
has
the
right
to
resume
our
participation
if
it
decides
so
total
said
in
an
emailed
statement
most
of
cnpc
s
experience
lies
in
its
subsidiary
china
petroleum
offshore
engineering
company
cpoe
which
has
worked
in
shallow
waters
off
north
china
once
total
quits
that
will
trigger
cnpc
to
take
over
automatically
according
to
the
contract
a
senior
chinese
industry
source
with
knowledge
of
the
deal
told
reuters
but
the
question
is
not
about
if
cnpc
is
going
to
take
over
as
the
operator
but
if
cnpc
could
deliver
and
advance
the
project
without
china
also
faces
challenges
supplying
equipment
such
as
compressors
needed
for
developing
the
giant
gas
project
as
leading
manufacturers
could
be
barred
from
supplying
to
iran
under
sanctions
carmakers
psa
renault
and
daimler
are
also
among
those
to
suspend
or
drop
plans
to
invest
in
iran
along
with
deutsche
bahn
and
deutsche
telekom
working
to
maintain
financial
channels
with
tehran
and
facilitate
iran
s
oil
exports
the
european
union
has
taken
steps
to
counter
the
renewed
sanctions
including
forbidding
eu
citizens
from
complying
with
them
or
related
court
rulings
washington
has
said
iran
s
only
chance
of
avoiding
the
sanctions
would
be
to
accept
trump
s
offer
to
negotiate
a
tougher
nuclear
deal
iranian
officials
have
repeatedly
rejected
the
offer
we
do
not
want
to
revisit
that
nuclear
deal
we
want
the
united
states
to
implement
that
nuclear
deal
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
told
cnn
on
sunday
the
united
states
will
impose
tougher
sanctions
in
november
which
will
target
iran
s
oil
sales
and
banking
sector
iran
s
rial
currency
has
lost
about
half
of
its
value
since
april
because
of
a
weak
economy
financial
difficulties
at
local
banks
and
heavy
demand
for
dollars
among
iranians
who
fear
the
effects
of
sanctions
under
the
deal
most
international
sanctions
on
iran
were
lifted
in
return
for
curbs
on
the
country
s
nuclear
programme
