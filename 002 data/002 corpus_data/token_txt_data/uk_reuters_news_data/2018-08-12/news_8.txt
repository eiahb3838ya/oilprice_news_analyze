update 2-russia, iran, and 3 others agree caspian status, but not borders

kazakhstan
reuters
iran
and
four
nations
including
russia
agreed
in
principle
on
sunday
how
to
divide
up
the
potentially
huge
oil
and
gas
resources
of
the
caspian
sea
paving
way
for
more
energy
exploration
and
pipeline
projects
however
the
delimitation
of
the
seabed
which
has
caused
most
disputes
will
require
additional
agreements
between
littoral
nations
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
for
almost
three
decades
the
five
littoral
states
russia
iran
kazakhstan
turkmenistan
and
azerbaijan
have
argued
over
how
to
divide
the
world
s
biggest
enclosed
body
of
water
and
while
some
countries
have
pressed
ahead
with
large
offshore
projects
such
as
the
kashagan
oil
field
off
kazakhstan
s
coast
disagreement
over
the
sea
s
legal
status
has
prevented
some
other
ideas
from
being
implemented
one
of
those
is
a
pipeline
across
the
caspian
which
could
ship
natural
gas
from
turkmenistan
to
azerbaijan
and
then
further
to
europe
allowing
it
to
compete
with
russia
in
the
western
markets
some
littoral
states
have
also
disputed
the
ownership
of
several
oil
and
gas
fields
which
delayed
their
development
we
have
established
territorial
waters
whose
borders
become
state
borders
kazakhstan
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
told
a
briefing
after
signing
the
caspian
convention
adjacent
to
the
territorial
waters
are
miles
of
fishing
water
where
each
state
has
exclusive
fishing
rights
he
said
nazarbayev
also
said
the
convention
explicitly
barred
any
armed
presence
on
the
caspian
sea
other
than
that
of
the
littoral
states
issue
the
dispute
began
with
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
which
had
a
clearly
defined
caspian
border
with
iran
in
negotiations
with
nations
tehran
has
insisted
on
either
splitting
the
sea
into
five
equal
parts
or
jointly
developing
all
of
its
resources
none
of
its
neighbours
have
agreed
to
those
proposals
and
three
of
them
russia
kazakhstan
and
azerbaijan
effectively
split
the
northern
caspian
between
each
other
using
median
lines
azerbaijan
however
has
yet
to
agree
on
how
to
divide
several
oil
and
gas
fields
with
iran
and
turkmenistan
including
the
field
with
reserves
of
some
million
barrels
of
oil
the
three
countries
have
tried
to
develop
the
disputed
fields
while
at
times
using
warships
to
scare
off
contractors
hired
by
other
sides
as
a
result
none
of
the
disputed
projects
has
made
much
progress
speaking
after
the
signing
on
sunday
all
five
leaders
praised
it
as
historic
event
but
provided
little
detail
about
provisions
on
splitting
the
seabed
however
making
it
clear
that
the
document
is
no
final
solution
rouhani
said
border
delimitation
would
require
further
work
and
separate
agreements
although
the
convention
would
serve
as
a
basis
for
that
pipeline
moscow
has
no
outstanding
territorial
disputes
but
has
objected
citing
environmental
concerns
to
the
construction
of
a
natural
gas
pipeline
between
turkmenistan
and
azerbaijan
which
would
allow
turkmen
gas
to
bypass
russia
on
its
way
to
europe
it
remained
unclear
whether
the
convention
adopted
on
sunday
would
definitely
clear
a
way
for
the
pipeline
kazakh
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
said
the
document
allowed
pipelines
to
be
laid
as
long
as
certain
environmental
standards
were
met
ashley
sherman
principal
caspian
analyst
at
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
that
although
the
signing
itself
was
an
unprecedented
milestone
for
the
region
the
immediate
implications
for
the
energy
sector
would
be
limited
we
consider
a
gas
pipeline
tcgp
unlikely
even
in
the
longer
term
he
said
in
an
email
clarity
on
the
legal
status
will
shine
more
light
on
the
commercial
and
strategic
obstacles
to
a
tcgp
from
infrastructure
constraints
to
supply
competition
not
least
from
azerbaijan
in
the
upstream
sector
the
increasing
intent
for
joint
projects
in
the
south
caspian
is
very
promising
sherman
said
stranded
fields
and
frozen
exploration
projects
may
well
come
back
on
the
agenda
he
said
however
with
offshore
caspian
oil
and
gas
production
already
almost
at
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
the
impact
from
new
fields
if
and
when
disputes
about
their
ownership
are
settled
might
be
limited
the
scale
of
the
projects
in
disputed
waters
is
not
comparable
to
the
existing
fields
from
azeri
chirag
guneshli
and
shah
deniz
in
azerbaijan
to
kashagan
in
kazakhstan
