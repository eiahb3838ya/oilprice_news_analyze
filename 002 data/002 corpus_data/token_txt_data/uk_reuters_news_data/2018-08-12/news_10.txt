nasa
launched
a
space
probe
early
sunday
that
will
go
closer
to
the
sun
than
any
spacecraft
before
the
agency
announced
the
craft
will
endure
extreme
heat
while
zooming
through
the
solar
corona
to
study
the
sun
s
outer
atmosphere
that
gives
rise
to
the
solar
winds
the
parker
solar
probe
a
spacecraft
the
size
of
a
small
car
launched
from
cape
canaveral
in
florida
about
sunday
on
a

within
million
miles
million
km
of
the
solar
surface
seven
times
closer
than
any
other
spacecraft
the
corona
gives
rise
to
the
solar
wind
a
continuous
flow
of
charged
particles
that
permeates
the
solar
system
and
can
cause
havoc
with
communications
technology
on
earth
nasa
hopes
the
findings
will
enable
scientists
to
forecast
changes
in
earth
s
space
environment
the
project
with
a
billion
billion
pounds
price
tag
is
the
first
major

living
with
a
star
program
the
probe
named
after
american
solar
astrophysicist
eugene

parker
will
have
to
survive
difficult
heat
and
radiation
conditions
it
has
been
outfitted
with
a
heat
shield
designed
to
keep
its
instruments
at
a
tolerable
degrees
fahrenheit
degrees
celsius
even
as
the
spacecraft
faces
temperatures
reaching
nearly
degrees
