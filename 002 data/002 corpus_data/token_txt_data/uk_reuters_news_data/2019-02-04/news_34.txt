exit
a
nuclear

between
tehran
and
six
major
powers
after
nine
months

never
accept
their
strange
and
humiliating

negotiations
on
its
missile
a

a
mirror
company
the
two

are
to
hold
talks
this
week
on
the
process
the
european
statement
said
they
expected
iran
to
swiftly
implement
all
elements
of
its
fatf
action
plan
fatf
is
not
a
precondition
it
s
a
strong
expectation

any
suggestion
that
ballistic
missile
talks
had
anything
to
do
with
creating
the

iran
has
threatened
to
pull
out

the
deal
new
sanctions
have
largely
succeeded

persuading
european
companies
to
abandon
business
with
iran

washington
said
it
did
not
expect
the
eu
effort
known
as
instex
or
instrument
for
supporting
trade
exchanges
to
change
that
even
as
european
powers
have
worked
to
preserve

been
worsening

they
are
also
considering
whether
to
push
for
sanctions
on
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
if
talks
between
the
two
sides
on
the
issue
do
not
progress
