britain's ineos calls for a change in â€˜unworkable' gas fracking rules
london
reuters
british
chemical
manufacturer
ineos
has
called
on
the
uk
government
to
change
its
unworkable
rules
on
gas
fracking
which
it
says
could
force
the
closure
of
the
industry
ineos
has
the
largest
shale
gas
license
acreage
in
britain
and
wants
to
develop
the
sites
to
cut
its
reliance
on
imported
gas
which
it
says
will
dramatically
reduce
its
costs
the
government
is
shutting
down
shale
by
the
backdoor
and
is
betting
the
future
of
our
manufacturing
industry
on
windmills
and
imported
gas
ineos
said
in
a
statement
on
its
website
ineos
said
britain
must
change
its
traffic
light
seismicity
regulations
which
mean
fracking
must
be
halted
for
hours
if
seismic
activity
of
magnitude
or
above
is
detected
at
sites
ineos
calls
upon
the
government
to
either
make
shale
workable
or
shut
it
down
ineos
said
cuadrilla
currently
the
only
company
to
have
fracked
for
gas
in
britain
had
to
halt
operations
several
times
last
year
at
its
preston
new
road
site
in
northwest
england
due
to
seismic
events
which
exceeded
the
limit
it
has
also
said
the
current
regulations
are
too
stringent
and
experts
agree
that
the
limit
for
tremors
could
be
safely
raised
at
fracking
sites
however
the
government
which
initially
supported
fracking
to
cut
britain
s
reliance
on
imports
as
north
sea
gas
supplies
dry
up
said
earlier
this
year
it
has
no
plans
to
change
the
rules
britain
currently
imports
around
percent
of
its
gas
needs
via
pipelines
from
norway
and
continental
europe
and
tankers
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
from
countries
including
qatar
russia
and
the
fracking
or
hydraulically
fracturing
involves
extracting
gas
from
rocks
by
breaking
them
up
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
it
is
fiercely
opposed
by
environmentalists
who
have
raised
concerns
about
potential
groundwater
contamination
and
say
extracting
more
fossil
fuel
is
at
odds
with
britain
s
commitment
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
