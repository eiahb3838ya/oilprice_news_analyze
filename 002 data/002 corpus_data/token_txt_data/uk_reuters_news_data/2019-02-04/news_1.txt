extreme u.s. natural gas volatility to ease after winter -analysts
feb
reuters
the
most
extreme
period
of
volatility
in
natural
gas
futures
in
nearly
years
is
set
to
a
close
as
the
winter
weather
turns
warmer
but
not
before
the
wild
price
swings
caused
one
trading
firm
to
collapse
while
some
firms
took
losses
the
volatility
likely
helped
others
make
money
something
that
may
be
harder
to
do
now
that
prices
are
trading
in
a
narrower
range
analysts
said
there
certainly
were
more
winners
and
losers
in
november
and
december
than
in
recent
years
when
the
market
was
fairly
quiet
said
daniel
myers
market
analyst
at
gelber
associates
in
houston
noting
there
is
more
interest
in
a
market
that
provides
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
big
price
swings
for
an
interactive
graphic
on
extreme
volatility
in
natural
gas
futures
see
the
combination
of
colder
forecasts
concerns
about
low
levels
of
gas
in
storage
and
the
falloff
of
hedge
fund
bets
on
gas
kicked
off
the
longest
streak
of
extreme
volatility
since
gas
futures
posted
their
biggest
percentage
gain
in
eight
years
on
only
to
follow
with
their
largest
loss
in
years
the
next
day
those
types
of
swings
repeated
for
several
weeks
into
late
january
since
november
the
difference
between
the
highest
trading
level
and
the
lowest
for
gas
futures
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
averaged
percent
of
the
previous
closing
price
the
highest
for
an
extended
period
since
when
the
average
reached
percent
that
compares
with
extremely
low
intraday
price
movements
from
early
february
to
early
november
when
the
spread
averaged
just
percent
the
lowest
since
early
those
massive
price
swings
caused
commodities
trading
advisor
optionsellers
of
tampa
florida
to
suffer
huge
losses
and
collapse
in
addition
hedge
funds
in
general
were
forced
to
shift
positions
as
many
were
caught
betting
on
a
sleepy
lackluster
pricing
environment
investors
are
once
again
betting
on
low
volatility
but
with
winter
more
than
half
over
that
bet
is
a
safer
one
as
demand
for
heating
will
decline
i
think
volatility
will
decline
in
coming
weeks
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
said
steve
crossin
chief
executive
of
long
crossin
investments
llc
a
private
investment
firm
in
denver
noting
the
sharp
increase
in
volatility
since
november
was
caused
by
the
market
s
assessment
of
winter
weather
and
its
effect
on
heating
over
the
past
four
trading
sessions
gas
prices
slipped
to
their
lowest
level
in
nine
months
even
as
demand
for
the
fuel
spiked
to
a
record
high
during
a
polar
vortex
that
froze
the
midwest
and
northeast
and
caused
several
utilities
to
call
on
customers
to
use
less
fuel
traders
said
prices
declined
because
the
market
has
moved
past
the
brief
brutal
freeze
as
it
focused
on
warmer
weather
expected
to
last
through
late
february
over
the
past
four
sessions
including
monday
the
spread
averaged
just
percent
volatility
is
going
to
be
substantially
reduced
as
we
exit
the
winter
but
i
don
t
think
we
will
see
the
incredibly
depressed
volatility
we
saw
for
much
of
