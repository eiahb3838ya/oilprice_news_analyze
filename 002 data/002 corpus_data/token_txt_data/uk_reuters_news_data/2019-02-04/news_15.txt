rwe
could
preserve
a
forest
in
the
west
of
the
country
after
a
deal
to
coal
mining
and
generation
although
the
cost
of
doing
so
would
run
into
tens
of
millions
of
euros
its
chief
executive
said
on
monday
germany
s
coal
commission
said
on
that
preserving

rolf
martin
schmitz
told
an
industry
conference
in
essen
that
once
it
was
clear
what
the
roadmap
was
then
rwe
would
have
to
draw
up
a
new
plan
for
brown
coal
lignite
and
would
decide
whether
it
was
feasible
not
to
fell
trees
while
it
would
be
technically
possible
but
would
cost
tens
of
millions
of
euros
given
the
space
needed
for
mining
waste
said
schmitz
adding
one
would
have
to
ask
oneself
how
much
is
a
tree
rwe
is
germany
s
largest
operator
of
power
plants
and
employs
about
staff
in
the

coal
mining
area
which
also
includes
power
plants
plans
to
expand
the
mine
by
clearing
the
forest
which
has
become
a
symbol
of
industry

been
delayed
and

has
warned
that

be
lost
