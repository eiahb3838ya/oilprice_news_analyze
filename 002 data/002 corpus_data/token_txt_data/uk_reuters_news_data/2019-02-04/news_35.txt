german grid firms see extra costs to meet renewable power target

boosting
renewables
to
percent
of
germany
s
power
mix
by
could
cost
billion
euros
more
than
previously
planned
which
will
mean
higher
consumer
energy
bills
the
four
main
grid
operators
said
on
monday
last
year
germany
raised
its
target
for
the
contribution
of
renewables
to
percent
by
from
percent
in
a
bid
to
reduce
emissions
by
percent
over
levels
it
is
set
to
miss
a
target
aimed
at
cutting
emissions
by
percent
about
two
fifths
of
power
needs
in
europe
s
largest
economy
are
now
met
by
renewables
but
this
needs
to
rise
as
it
seeks
to
close
nuclear
plants
by
and
coal
power
stations
by
as
a
result
power
grids
need
to
be
extended
to
reach
renewable
energy
sites
this
will
include
new
transmission
lines
to
connect
the
industrial
south
with
northern
wind
power
farms
the
grid
companies
known
as
transmission
system
operators
tsos
have
presented
plans
for
a
consultation
outlining
spending
on
onshore
lines
of
billion
euros
billion
compared
to
the
billion
euros
previously
envisaged
the
four
main
tsos
enbw
s
transnetbw
tennet
and
amprion
said
in
a
statement
that
an
additional
billion
to
billion
euros
would
be
needed
to
link
up
offshore
wind
farms
total
spending
of
billion
to
billion
euros
over
years
would
be
shouldered
by
consumers
via
higher
grid
fees
which
account
for
about
a
quarter
of
their
electricity
bills
however
the
energy
regulator
bundesnetzagentur
said
between
a
quarter
and
a
third
of
costs
estimated
by
tsos
in
the
past
were
not
approved
the
tsos
said
some
of
extra
costs
arose
from
digitalising
transmission
systems
and
running
more
lines
underground
the
tsos
demands
include
adding
two
more
lines
on
top
of
three
underground
ones
already
planned
for
between
a
quarter
and
half
of
power
demand
in
southern
germany
will
have
to
be
met
by
renewable
generation
in
the
north
where
plants
now
generate
double
the
north
s
needs
the
additional
lines
to
be
built
would
run
from
to
baden
wuerttemberg
via
westphalia
with
capacity
for
gigawatts
gw
over
a
distance
of
kms
miles
the
tsos
said
we
will
study
the
draft
plan
very
carefully
to
decide
whether
all
transport
capacities
are
being
exploited
peter
franke
vice
president
of
bundesnetzagentur
told
a
panel
discussion
at
an
industry
event
in
essen
the
regulator
said
in
january
it
would
seek
to
rein
in
costs
especially
as
germany
s
plan
to
quit
coal
generation
would
demand
new
spending
