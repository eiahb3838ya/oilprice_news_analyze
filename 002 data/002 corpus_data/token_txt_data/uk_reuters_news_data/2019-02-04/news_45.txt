at

of
a
picturesque
rural

southern
france
near
the
spanish
border
odessa
roitg
has
a
tough
job
trying
to
get
people
to
use
private
cars
less
and
greener
transport
more
the
area
of
communes
with
its
base
in
the
arty
town
of
céret
approved
a
new
climate
change
plan
in
december
that
aims
to
improve
the
public
bus
service
and
encourage
for
people
to
get
to
work
the
young
bureaucrat
said
the
administration
itself
uses
electric
bikes
and
vehicles
for
some
of
its
operations
but
in
this
part
of
france
with
few
transport
alternatives
to
driving
a
car
roitg
can
understand
why
some
people
support
ongoing
protests
by
the
gilets
jaunes
yellow
vests
sparked
in
november
by
a
planned
hike
in
diesel
taxes
people
get
a
bit
annoyed
when
the
government
speaks
to
them
about
the
environment
and
sustainable
development
because
it
comes
with
taxes
and
things
costing
more
when
it
should
cost
them
less
she
said
the
yellow
vest
protests
caused
concern
among
officials
gathered
at
the
annual
climate
talks
in
poland
in
december
many
of
them
looking
for
ways
to
curb
emissions
without
stoking
social
discontent
growing
pressure
to
slash
emissions
to
meet
global
warming
limits
set
in
the
paris
agreement
and
prevent
the
worst
impacts
of
climate
change
means
more
governments
are
considering
pricing
carbon
usually
that
is
done
by
taxing
fossil
fuels
or
by
capping
industry
emissions
and
setting
up
a
scheme
to
trade
allowances
mathilde
bouyé
an
associate
with
the
climate
programme
at
the
world
resources
institute
said
france
s
aborted
attempt
to
hike
fuel
prices
came
on
top
of
a
tax
cut
for
the
wealthy
and
was
the
last
straw
for
families
what
is
behind
this
is
a
matter
of
equity
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
there
is
no
opposition
in
principle
to
carbon
but
citizens
are
unwilling
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
costs
when
they
feel
the
burden
should
be
shared
with
large
corporations
she
added
she
noted
that
the
gilets
jaunes
have
called
for
higher
taxes
on
shipping
and
aircraft
for
example
another
problem
in
france
was
that
the
extra
income
from
fuel
price
hikes
had
been
earmarked
for
the
french
state
budget
rather
than
to
support
concrete
projects
to
help
people
adopt
clean
energy
in
response
to
social
unrest
france
has
now
launched
a
nationwide
grand
debate
on
four
themes
including
the
ecological
transition
and
taxation
to
which
anyone
can
contribute
online
or
at
municipal
meetings
laurence
tubiana
ceo
of
the
european
climate
foundation
said
french
voters
had
little
trust
in
the
government
on
climate
change
policies
but
all
may
not
be
lost
i
think
the
grand
debate
will
offer
the
possibility
for
the
government
to
reshape
its
policy
because
it
will
give
the
president
a
new
legitimacy
to
do
that
she
said
george
marshall
a
lead
author
of
a
world
bank
guide
issued
in
december
on
communicating
carbon
pricing
said
consulting
the
public
was
crucial
though
often
skipped
in
designing
policies
to
make
people
pay
more
for
fossil
fuels
including
a
wide
range
of
views
from
the
outset
is
key
he
told
a
briefing
on
the
guide
we
can
not
sell
something
that
is
a
poorly
constructed
policy
said
marshall
founder
of
climate
outreach
a
organisation
that
works
to
improve
communication
around
climate
change
addressing
people
s
most
immediate
concerns
which
may
well
not
include
climate
change
is
crucial
too
the
top
environmental
issue
for
many
responding
to
france
s
grand
debate
online
survey
is
air
pollution
for
instance
and
action
on
that
could
also
help
reduce
emissions
marshall
said
the
public
often
responds
badly
to
a
conventional
narrative
that
lays
out
the
threats
and
costs
of
climate
change
then
goes
on
to
explain
in
economic
terms
why
it
is
cheaper
to
act
now
than
cough
up
for
the
damage
later
instead
the
benefits
have
to
be
put
first
and
foremost
he
explained
how
the
money
raised
from
a
carbon
levy
will
be
used
is
also
key
to
gaining
public
acceptance
he
said
in
canada
s
british
columbia
province
revenue
from
its
carbon
tax
introduced
in
is
given
back
to
individuals
via
a
climate
action
tax
credit
the
tax
has
proved
largely
successful
both
in
terms
of
curbing
emissions
and
public
a
similar
policy
is
now
being
rolled
out
at
national
level
in
the
united
states
meanwhile
a
bill
has
been
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
calling
for
a
fee
on
fossil
fuels
with
the
money
collected
paid
back
in
equal
shares
to
americans
each
month
as
a
carbon
dividend
an
idea
that
is
supported
by
eminent
economists
researchers
at
georgia
state
university
and
the
cicero
center
for
international
climate
research
surveyed
nearly
people
in
five
countries
britain
the
united
states
australia
south
africa
and
india
in
on
how
funds
from
a
hypothetical
global
carbon
tax
ought
to
be
used
the
three
methods
that
garnered
more
than
percent
approval
in
all
five
countries
were
lowering
income
taxes
redistributing
revenues
domestically
to
each
citizen
and
investing
the
funds
in
renewable
energy
projects
in
every
nation
worldwide
reporting
their
findings
in
the
journal
nature
last
month
the
researchers
wrote
that
returning
revenue
in
the
form
of
a
people
s
payout
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
it
appeals
to
the
political
right
because
it
does
not
swell
state
coffers
and
the
left
is
happy
because
the
average
tax
burden
is
unchanged
and
households
end
up
better
off
stefano
carattini
assistant
economics
professor
at
georgia
state
university
urged
countries
and
jurisdictions
with
carbon
taxes
or
emissions
trading
schemes
which
now
cover
about
a
fifth
of
global
emissions
to
form
an
international
club
aimed
at
harmonising
systems
and
raising
the
carbon
price
such
a
club
could
also
lobby
the
world
trade
organization
to
reform
rules
to
allow
carbon
taxes
to
be
levied
on
imports
he
said
eventually
if
enough
states
came
onboard
the
existing
messy
system
of
each
nation
setting
an
emissions
target
in
the
hope
of
keeping
global
warming
in
check
could
be
jettisoned
for
a
single
global
carbon
price
he
argued
climate
chief
patricia
espinosa
meanwhile
called
for
a
more
positive
narrative
on
the
benefits
of
a
green
transformation
yes
we
are
fighting
climate
change
but
we
are
working
towards
a
sustainable
resilient
world
that
is
good
for
health
for
nutrition
for
the
quality
of
life
of
