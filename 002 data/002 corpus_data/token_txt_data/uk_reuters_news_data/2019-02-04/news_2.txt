in

the
interior
department
which
employs
more
than
people
and
oversees
more
than
percent
of
the
land
surface
has
been
central
to
trump
s
energy
dominance
policy
of
boosting
energy
production
as
zinke
s
deputy
bernhardt
has
played
a
role
in
efforts
to
open
alaska
s
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
to
oil
drilling
ease
protections
on
a
bird
called
the
greater
sage

ann
navaro
a
former
department
of
interior
official
who
served
in
the
obama
and
trump
administrations
and
worked
closely
with
bernhardt
said
he
is
a
rare
lawyer
s
lawyer
who
prepares
thoroughly
for
meetings
often
being
the
only
one
in
a
room
to
have
read
full
environmental
assessments
of
projects
and
plans
bernhardt
who
prefers
conservative
suits
to
zinke
s
cowboy
hats
and
boots
also
worked
a
series
of
jobs
at
the
interior
department
under
former
president
george
bush
from
to
early
including
as
the
department
s
solicitor
after
working
under
bush
bernhardt
became
a
lawyer
and
lobbyist
at
brownstein
hyatt
farber
schreck
for
water
and
oil
interests
he
represented
noble
energy
inc
rosemont
copper
co
sempra
energy
and
california
s
westlands
water
district
among
others
bernhardt
has
long
been
an
advocate
of
reforming
the
endangered
species
act
the
law
that
protects
plants
and
animals
at
risk
from
resource
extraction
and
development
if
he
is
approved
by
the
senate
bernhardt
is
expected
to
continue
that
work
critics
say
bernhardt
s
previous
work
as
a
lobbyist
could
risk
conflicts
of
interest
unless
he
recuses
himself
from
certain
issues
because
he
worked
for
companies
that
could
benefit
by
opening
up
lands
to
development
about
environmental
groups
in
including
the
natural
resources
defense
council
urged
senators
to
oppose
bernhardt
in
the
confirmation
vote
for
his
deputy
position
saying
his
previous
lobbyist
work
raised
questions
about
his
ability
to
act
in
the
public
interest
despite
their
letter
calling
him
a
walking
conflict
of
interest
the
senate
confirmed
bernhardt
on
a
mostly
vote
and
with
strong
support
from
alaska
senator
lisa
murkowski
and
other
lawmakers
who
have
large
areas
of
lands
in
their
states
if
bernhardt
ascends
to
secretary
it
would
mirror
the
change
of
guard
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
where
last
july
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
a
former
coal
lobbyist
replaced
scott
pruitt
who
stepped
down
after
a
series
of
probes
into
his
conduct
wheeler
is
a
staunch
proponent
of
trump
s
energy
dominance
agenda
to
produce
oil
gas
and
coal
for
both
domestic
use
and
export
