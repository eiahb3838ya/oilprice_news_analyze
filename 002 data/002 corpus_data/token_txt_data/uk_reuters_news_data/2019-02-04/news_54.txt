london
feb
reuters
representatives
from
britain
s
biggest
union
unite
and
nissan
are
meeting
on
monday
after
the
japanese
carmaker
scrapped
plans
to
build
its
model
at
its
sunderland
plant
in
northern
england
falling
demand
for
diesel
cars
in
europe
has
forced
nissan
to
invest
in
other
technologies
as
the
segment
is
hit
by
levies
and
crackdowns
but
the
company
also
said
the
continued
uncertainty
around
the
uk
s
future
relationship
with
the
eu
is
not
helping
companies
like
ours
to
plan
for
the
future
prompting
renewed
fears
among
some
in
britain
that
brexit
was
hitting
the
economy
i
think
that
is
a
serious
signal
to
all
of
us
in
parliament
that
now
is
the
time
to
resolve
that
uncertainty
so
it
doesn
t
impinge
on
any
decisions
in
the
future
business
minister
greg
clark
told
the
bbc
tv
britain
secured
the
nissan
investment
just
four
months
after
the
june
vote
to
leave
the
eu
with
promises
to
maintain
the
competitiveness
of
the
plant
since
then
lawmakers
have
rejected
a
negotiated
brexit
deal
raising
the
prospect
of
an
exit
without
agreement
leading
to
tariffs
and
customs
checks
clark
said
new
jobs
were
due
to
be
created
by
the
investment
but
none
of
the
existing
workforce
would
be
hit
by
the
decision
to
pull
the
model
which
will
solely
be
built
in
japan
unite
s
acting
national
officer
for
the
automotive
sector
steve
bush
said
he
now
wanted
nissan
to
work
with
their
employees
regarding
the
future
unite
now
expects
the
company
to
work
with
us
to
ensure
full
preparations
for
brexit
in
which
jobs
and
investment
are
prioritised
which
can
be
best
achieved
by
our
representation
on
the
task
