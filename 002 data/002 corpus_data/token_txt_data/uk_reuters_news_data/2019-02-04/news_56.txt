new

reuters
mohanan
grew
up
in
a
village
without
electricity
studied
statistics
at
a
public
university
and
then
spent
more
than
three
decades
crunching
numbers
for
the
indian
government
but
in
the
past
week
the
official
has
been
caught
up
in
a
political
storm
that
has
threatened
to
undermine
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
government
months
before
a
general
election
on
mohanan
resigned
as
acting
chairman
of
the
national
statistical
commission
nsc
a
advisory
body
that
checks
the
quality
of
india
s
official
data
in
protest
at
a
delay
in
releasing
a
new
set
of
jobs
statistics
another
member
of
the
nsc
meenakshi
quit
with
him
three
days
later
some
of
those
jobs
numbers
were
leaked
to
the
business
standard
newspaper
which
reported
that
india
s
unemployment
rate
in
the
year
ending
june
rose
to
percent
its
highest
level
in
at
least
years
the
figures
are
potentially
crucial
before
the
election
due
to
be
held
by
may
as
modi
s
bharatiya
janata
party
bjp
struggles
to
win
over
voters
concerned
about
depressed
farm
incomes
and
a
lack
of
job
creation
india
needs
to
create
more
than
a
million
jobs
each
month
just
to
find
employment
for
young
people
entering
the
workforce
officials
from
niti
aayog
a
government
think
tank
formed
by
modi
in
that
is
not
normally
involved
in
official
releases
of
economic
data
have
rejected
the
job
numbers
reported
by
the
business
standard
they
said
the
report
was
still
in
draft
form
and
argued
that
more
quarterly
data
was
required
to
publish
a
comparable
jobs
report
finance
minister
arun
jaitley
also
told
reuters
news
partner
ani
the
report
was
a
draft
which
has
not
been
but
in
an
interview
with
reuters
this
weekend
mohanan
says
he
has
no
regrets
about
walking
out
in
protest
at
the
delay
he
said
the
nsc
which
was
supposed
to
be
the
final
authority
on
statistics
before
they
were
published
had
been
repeatedly
sidelined
by
the
government
in
recent
months
and
the
delay
in
the
jobs
figures
was
the
final
straw
data
should
be
released
as
per
the
calendar
whether
it
is
to
your
liking
or
not
liking
he
said
otherwise
where
is
credibility
in
the
system
it
is
unclear
where
the
business
standard
got
the
figures
mohanan
stresses
it
wasn
t
from
him
and
declined
to
discuss
the
specifics
of
the
jobs
report
with
reuters
mohanan
who
says
he
is
not
active
politically
said
the
nsc
approved
the
report
on
and
expected
it
to
be
released
soon
after
when
it
didn
t
happen
he
reached
out
to
top
officials
including
the
chief
statistician
pravin
srivastava
even
flying
to
new
delhi
from
mohanan
s
home
in
southern
india
for
a
meeting
with
him
in
late
january
he
says
he
didn
t
get
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
delay
in
any
of
those
discussions
with
the
report
still
unreleased
mohanan
and
meenakshi
quit
a
few
days
later
mohanan
said
he
felt
it
was
important
that
he
stood
up
for
the
integrity
of
the
organisation
the
nsso
where
he
built
his
career
he
had
joined
the
nsc
as
a
member
in
two
years
after
retiring
from
india
s
statistics
service
which
includes
the
nsso
when
he
became
the
acting
head
in
november
he
found
the
nsc
s
role
had
diminished
under
the
modi
government
it
was
starved
of
resources
and
it
wasn
t
engaged
in
major
statistical
initiatives
as
they
should
be
under
ministry
guidelines
there
was
also
a
controversy
over
the
release
in
november
of
historical
gdp
data
with
a
new
base
year
which
was
used
by
the
government
to
attack
the
opposition
congress
party
the
data
showed
growth
was
lower
than
previously
thought
during
the
previous
government
he
said
his
concern
was
the
way
niti
aayog
was
involved
in
releasing
the
numbers
the
government
think
tank
said
they
had
been
brought
in
to
assess
the
numbers
before
that
announcement
according
to
local
media
as
to
niti
aayog
s
arguments
against
publishing
the
jobs
data
both
mohanan
and
a
senior
former
nsso
official
said
they
are
bogus
there
is
no
relation
between
this
report
and
the
quarterly
data
the
former
nsso
official
said
requesting
anonymity
radha
binod
barman
who
chaired
the
nsc
between
and
said
the
national
statistical
commission
should
have
been
the
final
authority
on
whether
to
release
the
jobs
report
niti
aayog
and
india
s
statistics
ministry
did
not
respond
to
emails
seeking
comment
for
mohanan
it
has
been
a
stressful
past
week
he
realizes
this
might
be
the
end
of
his
government
life
but
is
ready
to
settle
into
retirement
in
the
village
he
grew
up
in
the
state
of
kerala
having
made
his
point
mohanan
s
one
big
hope
is
that
the
nsc
and
the
indian
statistics
team
will
now
be
shown
more
respect
