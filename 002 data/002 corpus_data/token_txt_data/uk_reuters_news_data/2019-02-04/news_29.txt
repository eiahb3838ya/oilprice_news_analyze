rpt-column-south africa will struggle to boost coal exports, even if it wants to: russell
repeats
earlier
story
for
wider
readership
with
no

the
opinions

are
those
of
the
author
a

for
reuters

cape
town
feb

there
may
be
some
irony
in
climate
change
being
blamed
for
an
increase
in
weather
delays
that
resulted
in
south
africa
s
coal
exports
dropping
percent
last
year
but
in
reality
the
rough
seas
at
the
country
s
richards
bay
terminal
are
the
least
of
the
industry
s
worries
shipments
from
richards
bay
declined
to
million
tonnes
in
from
million
the
prior
year
well
below
the
million
tonnes
capacity
of
the
terminal
which
is
the
in
the
world
behind
newcastle
port
in
australia
the
terminal
lost
days
of
loading
last
year
because
of
rough
weather
down
slightly
from
days
in
with
both
these
years
being
considerably
higher
than
in
preceding
years
but
even
if
the
terminal
was
fully
available
all
days
of
the
year
it
s
still
unlikely
that
much
more
coal
would
have
been
shipped
the
blame
for
south
africa
s
lower
exports
was
placed
on
market
conditions
by
the
head
of
richards
bay
coal
terminal
rbct
alan
waller
with
high
prices
crimping
demand
in
the
main
export
destination
of
india
however
rbct
chair
nosipho
said
the
weather
disruptions
are
also
likely
a
challenge
for
future
years
and
terminals
around
the
world
were
going
to
have
to
deal
with
the
new
norm
of
what
was
previously
abnormal
weather
patterns
while
high
prices
were
undoubtedly
a
contributing
factor
to
the
lower
exports
it
s
also
likely
that
infrastructure
constraints
and
an
inability
of
many
of
south
africa
s
coal
miners
to
boost
production
were
perhaps
of
greater
importance
the
rail
network
has
a
theoretical
capacity
of
delivering
million
tonnes
a
year
from
south
africa
s
inland
mines
to
rbct
meaning
that
even
if
it
was
working
at
full
steam
there
still
wouldn
t
be
enough
coal
to
use
up
rbct
s
export
capacity
mandisa
mondi
the
general
manager
of
coal
freight
at
rail
operator
transnet
told
the
ihs
markit
southern
african
coal
conference
in
cape
town
last
week
that
plans
were
in
place
to
boost
the
rail
capacity
to
match
that
of
rbct
these
include
initial
steps
to
improve
technology
and
operational
efficiencies
to
reduce
bottlenecks
followed
by
later
infrastructure
improvements
such
as
a
new
tunnel
through
a
mountain
between
the
inland
coal
fields
and
the
coast
transnet
said
it
could
eventually
boost
the
rail
capacity
available
for
exports
by
million
tonnes
above
current
levels
but
whether
this
happens
depends
on
whether
miners
commit
to
producing
and
exporting
more
it
s
here
where
the
situation
becomes
less
clear
with
companies
having
been
reluctant
in
recent
years
to
invest
in
building
new
mines
or
even
expanding
existing
operations
part
of
this
was
because
of
a
dispute
over
south
africa
s
mining
laws
although
that
appears
to
have
been
settled
recently
still
south
africa
s
coal
miners
would
have
to
take
a
positive
view
of
likely
demand
before
committing
capital
to
new
projects
the
ihs
markit
conference
heard
some
rosy
forecasts
of
demand
for
coal
mainly
on
a
surge
in
new
power
plants
being
built
in
india
however
these
forecasts
are
likely
to
prove
hopelessly
optimistic
especially
as
renewable
energies
become
cheaper
and
more
reliable
and
as
more
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
becomes
available
from
projects
in
australia
the
united
states
and
russia
just
under
half
of
south
africa
s
coal
went
to
india
in
a
country
with
an
official
policy
of
reducing
coal
imports
to
zero
over
time
other
major
buyers
include
south
korea
which
also
plans
to
lower
coal
burning
and
pakistan
which
has
concerns
over
the
foreign
exchange
cost
of
importing
fuels
while
south
african
coal
is
viewed
as
a
good
quality
product
and
superior
to
supplies
from
top
thermal
coal
exporter
indonesia
there
are
serious
questions
as
to
whether
there
will
be
sufficient
demand
in
asia
to
justify
spending
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
needed
to
boost
mine
supply
and
rail
capacity
this
makes
it
likely
that
south
africa
will
continue
to
be
a
relatively
steady
supplier
of
around
million
tonnes
of
coal
a
year
to
the
seaborne
market
this
could
increase
somewhat
if
transnet
can
and
rbct
doesn
t
lose
more
days
to
rough
weather
but
for
now
any
ambitious
plans
to
boost
coal
exports
are
exactly
that
just
plans
