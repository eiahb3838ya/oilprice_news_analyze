were
low
electricity

eskom
which
previously
forecast
a
billion
rand
loss
in
the
financial
year
ending
in
march
is
vital
to
south

eskom

have
rallied
in

on
hopes

ramaphosa
will

a
restructuring

many
issues
fetched
their
highest
since

the

rose
cent

chief
executive
phakamani
hadebe
told
a
mining
conference
in
cape
town
the
government
should
consider
splitting
the
utility
using
the
term
functionally
unbundling
chief
financial
officer
calib
cassim
said
in
johannesburg
the
larger
forecast
loss
would
be
due
to
power
plant
maintenance
costs
and
increased
use
of
diesel
and
gas
which
is
typically
more
costly
than
coal
for

cassim
said
eskom
was
now
requesting
electricity
tariff
hikes
of
percent
in
percent
in
and
percent
in
steeper
than
a
previous
application
for
increases
of
percent
in
each
of
those
three
years
eskom
said
the
new
request
was
based
on
changes
to
its
sales
forecasts
and
production
plans
arguing
that
significant
time
had
elapsed
since
it
made
its
initial
request
south
africa
s
energy
regulator
is
expected
to
make
a
decision
on
eskom
s
tariff
request
in
march
this
year
we
need
eskom
to
be
sustainable
to
supply
electricity
cassim
told
a
public
hearing
on
the
tariff
increases
we
are
using
one
credit
card
to
pay
for
another
he
said
saying
eskom
was
funding
debt
servicing
with
further
borrowing
if
granted
the
revised
tariff
hikes
eskom
would
still
turn
a
profit
only
in
