china
s
imports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
rose
to
another
monthly
record
in
january
even
as
the
country
grapples
with
high
gas
inventories
amid
a
winter
according
to
shipping
data
and
industry
sources
the
world
s
lng
importer
took
million
tonnes
of
lng
in
january
beating
the
previous
record
hit
in
december
by
nearly
percent
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
shipping
data
china
s
imports
last
year
surged
percent
from
after
gas
shortages
the
previous
winter
prompted
chinese
companies
to
stock
up
on
supplies
and
cargoes
with
beijing
continuing
to
push
millions
of
households
to
switch
to
gas
from
coal
for
heating
but
the
import
growth
is
not
wholly
due
to
a
rise
in
demand
said
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
chinese
market
when
people
see
these
numbers
they
think
chinese
demand
is
up
but
actually
it
is
causing
a
headache
for
importers
as
they
have
overbought
and
can
t
find
demand
to
absorb
the
cargoes
the
source
said
declining
to
be
identified
as

china
national
offshore
oil
corp
cnooc
resold
at
least
one
lng
cargo
in
january
and
possibly
another
an
unusual
move
during
what
is
typically
a
peak
demand
period
and
highlighting
this
year
s
warmer
weather
industry
sources
said
chinese
traders
are
offering
lng
cargoes
to
international
buyers
or
selling
into
their
domestic
market
at
prices
the
first
source
said
the
lunar
new
year
holiday
has
also
made
the
situation
worse
because
factories
are
shutdown
for
a
least
a
week
he
said
wholesale
lng
from
small
liquefaction
plants
fell
to
yuan
a
tonne
on
less
than
half
levels
of
last
year
according
to
chinese
monitoring
agency
quotes
at
receiving
terminals
in
east
china
s
shandong

north
china
s
tianjin
last
stood
at
yuan
a
tonne
down
percent
and
percent
respectively
from
late
november
shortly
after
heating
season
started
china
s
gas
demand
growth
should
decelerate
from
the
past
two
years
said
james
taverner
of
energy
consultancy
ihs
markit
switching
mandates
are
moderating
due
to
security
of
supply
concerns
and
weakening
economic
growth
taverner
said
there
is
also
limited
capacity
in
north
china
for
further
lng
after
big
increases
the
past
two
years
he
said
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
have
also
tightened
financial
conditions
dragging
china
s
growth
last
year
to
its
weakest
in
years
