lagos
reuters
nigerian
energy
firm
forte
oil
said
it
plans
to
sell
its
upstream
services
and
power
businesses
in
nigeria
and
divest
from
ghana
to
focus
on
its
core
fuel
distribution
operation
at
home
the
move
comes
as
a
surprise
for
a
company
whose
chief
executive
akin
akinfemiwa
told
investors
in
lagos
in
august
that
he
wanted
to
aggressively
pursue
m
a
opportunities
along
the
energy
value
chain
and
acquire
marginal
oilfields
to
boost
its
upstream
business
the
company
majority
owned
by
billionaire
femi
otedola
had
also
been
in
talks
with
a
major
refinery
to
form
a
strategic
partnership
for
local
refining
of
petroleum
products
forte
oil
s
share
price
plunged
percent
last
year
after
the
company
struggled
to
get
hard
currency
to
import
products
it
now
has
a
total
market
value
of
billion
naira
mln
but
gave
no
indication
on
wednesday
of
how
much
the
businesses
for
sale
might
fetch
it
said
interest
costs
attributable
to
the
businesses
to
be
sold
stood
at
billion
naira
as
of
december
it
now
plans
to
seek
shareholder
approval
for
the
sale
on
may
and
appoint
advisers
it
said
in
a
notice
to
investors
forte
oil
did
not
give
a
reason
for
the
change
in
direction
but
said
the
downstream
sector
in
nigeria
had
gone
through
changes
in
recent
years
and
was
expected
to
evolve
further
it
added
that
the
industry
has
operated
under
a
tightly
regulated
fixed
margin
but
could
be
deregulated
especially
given
its
impact
on
the
nigerian
currency
and
import
bill
the
government
increased
petrol
prices
by
percent
to
naira
in
to
cut
subsidies
paid
for
fuel
imports
after
a
plunge
in
oil
prices
hit
state
revenues
caused
dollar
shortages
and
halted
infrastructure
projects
with
firms
laying
off
tens
of
thousands
of
workers
however
the
hike
did
not
prevent
gasoline
shortages
which
have
plagued
nigeria
for
much
of
last
year
and
this
year
nigeria
s
existing
and
ageing
refineries
have
a
daily
domestic
refining
capacity
of
million
liters
while
the
daily
consumption
stands
at
million
liters
so
the
country
has
to
import
the
bulk
of
what
it
consumes
forte
oil
has
two
storage
depots
five
aviation
fuel
depots
and
a
lubricant
blending
plant
it
also
has
trucks
for
distribution
of
products
across
its
more
than
retail
outlets
which
would
require
a
lot
of
capital
to
expand
its
owned
power
unit
amperion
power
distribution
company
has
a
lot
of
receivables
due
from
the
offtaker
and
its
upstream
unit
has
contributed
less
than
percent
to
group
earnings
over
the
past
three
years
the
unit
in
ghana
has
declared
losses
over
the
last
three
years
and
has
uncollectible
trade
debts
due
to
tough
economic
conditions
and
a
currency
devaluation
in
the
country
forte
oil
said
proceeds
from
the
divestment
would
be
used
to
expand
its
downstream
fuel
distribution
business
and
to
invest
in
storage
infrastructure
the
changing
landscape
also
suggests
backward
integration
would
be
essential
to
remain
competitive
within
the
sector
particularly
in
the
face
of
impending
deregulation
it
said
in
the
notice
forte
s
pretax
profit
nearly
doubled
in
to
billion
naira
though
sales
fell
by
percent
to
billion
naira
the
company
said
in
march
shares
in
forte
closed
flat
on
wednesday
at
naira
and
have
risen
percent
this
year
