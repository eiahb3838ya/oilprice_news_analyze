clean energy sector swings republican with u.s. campaign donations
reuters
solar
and
wind
energy
companies
have
donated
far
more
money
to
republicans
than
democrats
in
congressional
races
this
election
cycle
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
campaign
finance
data
an
unprecedented
tilt
to
the
right
for
an
industry
long
associated
with
the
environmental
left
while
the
money
is
modest
compared
with
that
donated
by
fossil
fuel
interests
the
support
provides
gop
candidates
with
added
credibility
on
clean
energy
an
issue
polling
shows
swing
voters
care
about
renewable
energy
has
typically
depended
on
government
subsidies
and
policies
to
help
fuel
its
growth
and
the
donations
come
at
a
time
when
republicans
control
both
houses
of
congress
as
well
as
a
majority
of
state
houses
across
the
country
republicans
have
so
far
left
subsidies
for
the
industry
largely
intact
we
support
those
leaders
who
share
our
vision
said
arthur
haubenstock
vice
president
of
policy
and
strategy
at
renewables
llc
a
solar
project
developer
and
treasurer
of
a
newly
formed
political
action
committee
that
shares
the
company
s
name
so
far
the
pac
has
donated
only
to
republicans
overall
political
action
committees
representing
solar
and
wind
companies
have
donated
nearly
to
candidates
and
pacs
in
the
election
cycle
including
to
republicans
to
democrats
and
to
independents
according
to
the
reuters
analysis
that
marks
a
record
during
the
presidential
elections
the
first
cycle
during
which
the
clean
energy
industry
gave
more
to
the
gop
than
to
democrats
republicans
received
just
over
half
of
the
combined
in
political
contributions
from
major
wind
and
solar
pacs
before
that
solar
and
wind
companies
mainly
donated
to
democrats
who
were
broadly
seen
as
more
supportive
of
policies
that
could
help
the
nascent
sector
grow
in
percent
of
the
contributions
from
seven
major
wind
and
solar
pacs
went
to
democrats
the
solar
and
wind
industries
have
expanded
greatly
over
the
last
decade
and
now
employ
some
workers
nationwide
nearly
six
times
more
than
coal
mining
the
hottest
growth
has
been
in
states
that
voted
heavily
for
president
donald
trump
in
that
has
helped
strengthen
the
industry
s
appeal
to
republican
lawmakers
allowing
it
to
rebrand
as
a
jobs
engine
for
the
heartland
instead
of
as
a
tool
for
combating
global
warming
an
issue
that
played
better
with
democrats
solar
is
creating
economic
activity
in
so
many
districts
said
abigail
ross
hopper
head
of
the
solar
energy
industries
association
seia
whose
donations
have
tilted
heavily
toward
the
gop
global
warming
is
certainly
not
our
lead
talking
point
she
said
seia
has
contributed
more
than
twice
as
much
to
republicans
as
to
democrats
this
cycle
versus
prior
to
seia
s
contributions
to
democrats
were
reliably
double
what
the
group
gave
to
republicans
the
american
wind
energy
association
s
pac
too
has
shifted
its
giving
in
it
gave
democrats
twice
as
much
money
as
republicans
while
in
the
current
cycle
it
has
given
to
republicans
compared
to
for
democrats
polls
have
found
widespread
support
for
renewable
energy
among
voters
including
among
republicans
most
recently
a
gallup
poll
from
early
march
found
percent
of
adults
favor
an
emphasis
on
alternatives
like
wind
and
solar
over
traditional
fossil
fuels
just
over
half
of
republicans
percent
favored
alternatives
compared
with
percent
of
democrats
gallup
said
among
moderate
republicans
and
voters
who
lean
republican
there
is
even
wider
support
for
renewable
energy
a
poll
conducted
by
pew
research
center
in
early
found
that
nearly
of
that
group
favored
alternative
energy
sources
over
fossil
fuels
the
polls
also
found
that
attitudes
toward
clean
energy
are
not
necessarily
linked
to
those
about
climate
change
the
gallup
poll
for
instance
found
just
percent
of
republicans
think
climate
change
is
caused
by
human
activities
and
percent
think
the
seriousness
of
global
warming
is
exaggerated
clean
energy
works
every
time
and
it
doesn
t
alienate
the
base
said
jay
faison
chief
executive
of
clearpath
a
group
that
aims
to
help
elect
republicans
supporting
clean
power
voters
view
support
for
alternative
energy
as
a
signal
that
a
candidate
is
not
an
errand
boy
for
the
party
leadership
he
added
nevada
incumbent
senator
dean
heller
is
among
the
chief
republican
beneficiaries
of
support
from
the
clean
energy
industry
his
effort
has
drawn
more
than
in
backing
from
solar
and
wind
this
election
cycle
nevada
ranks
fourth
in
the
nation
in
solar
installations
and
generates
more
than
percent
of
its
electricity
from
the
sun
one
in
every
people
is
employed
by
the
solar
industry
in
nevada
putting
it
second
only
to
california
heller
told
reuters
he
supports
clean
energy
because
of
the
jobs
it
has
brought
to
his
state
nevada
has
been
able
to
attract
employers
like
tesla
he
said
in
part
because
its
abundant
sunshine
can
produce
renewable
power
for
factories
and
other
business
operations
he
added
he
doesn
t
see
a
conflict
with
supporting
both
solar
energy
and
fossil
fuel
interests
i
m
very
pro
all
of
the
above
and
i
think
that
s
where
the
gop
is
