alberta
will
hold
talks
with
rail
operators
and
oil
producers
aimed
at
smoothing
the
path
to
get
more
crude
moving
by
rail
amid
a
transportation
bottleneck
in
the
western
canadian
province
alberta
s
energy
minister
said
on
wednesday
the
first
session
on
friday
will
include
senior
executives
from
canada
s
top
oil
producers
and
the
two
main
railways
canadian
pacific
railway
and
canadian
national
railway
the
minister
margaret
told
reporters
at
a
calgary
conference
we
re
hearing
there
s
constraints
and
there
s
gaps
between
the
rail
companies
and
producers
so
what
are
those
gaps
and
how
can
we
address
them
she
said
railways
who
added
crude
by
rail
capacity
earlier
this
decade
only
to
have
the
market
vanish
as
pipeline
space
opened
up
have
been
slow
to
move
back
in
the
oil
transport
business
asking
producers
to
sign
deals
but
oil
producers
want
flexibility
to
switch
to
pipeline
which
is
far
cheaper
if
capacity
becomes
available
a
pipeline
isn
t
going
to
be
built
overnight
so
we
need
to
have
strategies
for
all
market
access
said
canada
s
energy
producers
are
struggling
as
increased
oil
sands
output
has
run
up
against
a
lack
of
new
export
pipelines
and
tight
rail
capacity
sending
the
differential
between
canadian
oil
prices
and
the
crude
benchmark
to
highs
adding
to
the
crunch

canada
paused
work
last
month
on
its
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
citing
opposition
in
british
columbia
and
said
it
would
decide
by
may
on
whether
to
go
ahead
with
the
build
or
not
both
alberta
and
canada
s
federal
government
have
pledged
financial
support
to
the
project
which
would
nearly
triple
capacity
on
an
existing
line
from
alberta
to
a
port
when
asked
about
alberta
s
financial
pledge
said
the
government
was
open
to
all
options
though
she
declined
to
clarify
if
the
province
was
considering
an
ownership
stake
in
just
the
project
or
the
entire
pipeline
or
company
