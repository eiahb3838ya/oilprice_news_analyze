turkmenistan
on
wednesday
opened
a
new
billion
cargo
and
passenger
seaport
on
the
caspian
sea
aiming
to
boost
its
export
revenues
by
handling
shipping
traffic
between
asia
and
europe
the
central
asian
country
s
main
source
of
hard
currency
is
its
gas
exports
which
took
a
hit
when
russia
once
its
main
customer
stopped
all
purchases
in
after
a
pricing
dispute
the
port
in
the
city
of
turkmenbashi
will
more
than
triple

s
cargo
handling
capacity
to
million
tonnes
a
year
the
government
has
said
speaking
before
the
official
opening
ceremony

was
ready
to
discuss
the
use
of
the
seaport
with
its
landlocked
neighbors
a
reference
to
uzbekistan
and
afghanistan
turkmenistan
already
has
a
railway
link
with
china
through
neighboring
kazakhstan
and
the
new
port
could
help
ashgabat
win
a
slice
of
cargo
flows
moving

the
middle
east
and
europe
russia
azerbaijan
kazakhstan
and
iran

a
polypropylene

will
handle
products
from
a
nearby
plant
which
is
set
to
be
launched
later

year
