the
world
is
moving
too
slowly
to
meet
targets
to
provide
electric
power
and
clean
cooking
to
everyone
on
the
planet
by
with
progress
on
using
fuels
in
the
kitchen
especially
poor
international
agencies
said
on
wednesday
the
number
of
people
living
without
access
to
electricity
in
was
a
billion
or
percent
of
the
global
population
with
the
vast
majority
in
rural
parts
of
africa
and
south
asia
new
data
released
by
the
world
bank
the
united
nations
and
other
organisations
showed
unless
efforts
to
get
power
to
areas
are
ramped
up
an
estimated
million
people
about
percent
of
the
world
s
population
will
still
live
without
electricity
in
they
said
in
a
report
in
billion
people
more
than
percent
of
the
global
population
did
not
have
access
to
clean
fuels
and
technologies
for
cooking
indoor
air
pollution
from
burning
wood
dung
kerosene
and
other
dirty
fuels
causes
over
million
deaths
a
year
with
women
and
children
at
highest
risk
the
report
said
we
must
be
more
ambitious
in
harnessing
the
power
of
renewable
energy
to
meet
sustainable
development
and
climate
goals
and
take
more
deliberate
action
to
achieve
a
sustainable
energy
future
said
adnan
amin
of
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
which
worked
on
the
report
among
the
global
development
goals
now
being
pursued
are
universal
access
to
electricity
and
clean
cooking
as
well
as
a
doubling
of
the
rate
of
improvement
in
energy
efficiency
and
a
substantial
increase
in
the
share
of
renewables
in
the
world
s
energy
mix
the
energy
progress
report
released
at
a
forum
in
lisbon
tackling
how
to
meet
the
targets
highlighted
that
some
countries
particularly
in
east
africa
have
made
big
strides
in
getting
electric
power
to
their
people
in
recent
years
vivien
foster
global
lead
for
energy
economics
with
the
world
bank
noted
that
in
africa
the
number
of
people
living
without
electricity
had
begun
to
fall
for
the
first
time
in
history
which
could
be
a
turning
point
for
electrification
on
the
continent
previously
efforts
to
add
power
capacity
were
unable
to
keep
up
with
population
growth
the
battle
for
universal
electricity
access
will
be
won
or
lost
in
africa
foster
told
the
forum
progress
in
east
africa
has
been
fuelled
by
a
jump
in
solar
power
driven
by
a
rise
in
systems
in
countries
such
as
kenya
and
tanzania
where
users
can
make
payments
via
mobile
phones
germaine
kamayirese
rwanda
s
minister
of
state
for
energy
water
and
sanitation
said
her
country
was
pushing
solar
power
hard
as
a
way
of
hitting
its
goal
of
providing
electricity
to
all
its
people
by
today
percent
have
access
compared
with
just
percent
in
at
least
million
people
around
the
world
are
benefiting
from
solar
home
systems
yet
only
about
a
dozen
countries
are
embracing
this
revolution
world
bank
experts
said
if
more
countries
would
turn
to
this
resource
we
think
electrification
could
accelerate
even
more
rapidly
said
foster
noting
the
need
for
governments
to
develop
clean
energy
markets
and
ensure
products
a
shift
towards
cleaner
cooking
is
lagging
partly
because
it
lacks
policymakers
to
champion
the
cause
in
many
places
she
added
markets
for
modern
cookstoves
also
remain
undeveloped
on
current
trends
by
only
percent
of
people
will
have
access
to
clean
fuels
for
cooking
said
maria
neira
director
for
public
health
and
environment
at
the
world
health
organisation
this
is
absolutely
not
acceptable
she
told
the
conference
noting
that
such
a
failure
would
have
an
enormous
impact
on
the
health
of
people
progress
on
boosting
use
of
renewable
energy
also
is
set
to
fall
short
of
the
target
the
report
said
as
of
the
world
got
percent
of
all
energy
that
goes
to
end
users
such
as
households
industry
and
agriculture
from
renewables
solar
and
wind
have
become
far
cheaper
allowing
them
to
compete
with
conventional
power
sources
such
as
coal
but
electricity
accounted
for
only
percent
of
energy
consumption
in
said
the
report
flagging
the
need
to
speed
up
the
transition
to
cleaner
energy
in
transport
and
heating
energy
efficiency
is
improving
with
economic
growth
outpacing
increases
in
energy
use
in
all
regions
except
for
western
asia
from
the
report
said
that
means
countries
and
particularly
industries
are
using
less
energy
to
produce
more
transport
and
residential
buildings
have
not
shown
the
same
rate
of
improvement
in
energy
efficiency
several
wealthy
developed
countries
such
as
japan
and
the
united
states
may
have
reached
a
peak
in
energy
use
the
report
said
while
among
large
developing
countries
china
and
indonesia
are
rapidly
becoming
more
energy
efficient
to
meet
targets
we
must
make
every
unit
of
energy
work
harder

rachel
kyte
ceo
of
sustainable
