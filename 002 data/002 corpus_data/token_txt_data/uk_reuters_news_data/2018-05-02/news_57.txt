feature-smoke to ink? indian inventors try a novel approach to tame air pollution
new

may
thomson
reuters
foundation
as
the
summer
heat
takes
hold
in
new
delhi
two
things
are
as
inevitable
as
days
power
cuts
and
air
pollution
from
the
diesel
generators
that
then
kick
in
but
a
team
of
indian
engineers
has
figured
out
away
to
bring
some
good
from
choking
generator
exhaust
they
are
capturing
it
and
turning
it
into
ink
the
alarming
thing
about
diesel
generators
is
they
are
located
in
the
heart
of
densely
populated
areas
it
s
spitting
smoke
right
there
said
kushagra
srivastava
one
of
the
three
engineers
who
developed
the
technology
now
installed
in
gurgaon
a
satellite
city
of
new
delhi
and
in
the
southern
city
of
chennai
the
idea
srivastava
said
came
about
when
he
and
his
stopped
at
a
sugarcane
juice
stall
on
a
hot
day
they
noticed
a
wall
that
had
turned
black
behind
the
stand
s
diesel
generator
where
exhaust
emerged
from
a
pipe
they
wondered
if
diesel
exhaust
might
be
used
to
produce
paint
and
set
out
to
try
the
device
they
came
up
with
which
attaches
to
generators
captures
percent
of
the
soot
particles
from
cooled
diesel
exhaust
the
material
can
then
be
sold
to
ink
manufacturers
their
company
chakr
innovation
has
so
far
installed
of
the
devices
for
government
firms
such
as
indian
oil
real
estate
developers
and
other
state
government
offices
earning
more
than
million
rupees
in
revenue
in
the
first
year
srivastava
said
the
company
has
plans
to
install
another
devices
over
the
coming
year
he
said
it
has
so
far
sold
kg
of
collected
soot
which
has
been
used
to
create
litres
of
ink
he
added
chakr
innovations
is
not
the
first
to
see
cash
in
diesel
exhaust
a
competitor
called
graviky
labs
based
in
bangalore
is
using
similar
technology
to
turn
diesel
exhaust
from
vehicles
into
ink
srivastava
and
his
arpit
dhupar
and
prateek
sachan
see
themselves
as
part
of
a
movement
towards
cleaner
air
and
energy
in
a
country
where
major
cities
struggle
with
choking
air
about
million
people
a
year
die
from
the
impacts
of
air
pollution
in
india
according
to
a
survey
by
the
health
effects
institute
that
is
about
a
quarter
of
the
total
number
of
air
pollution
deaths
worldwide
it
said
in
new
delhi
levels
of
the
most
dangerous
particles
in
the
air
are
sometimes
times
higher
than
the
safe
limit
the
survey
noted
srivastava
and
dhupar
both
grew
up
in
new
delhi
which
the
world
health
organization
in
declared
the
most
polluted
city
in
the
world
sachan
comes
from
allahabad
the
third
most
polluted
city
in
who
s
rankings
earlier
i
remember
there
were
a
lot
less
cars
on
the
road
there
was
a
lot
less
congestion
and
a
lot
more
greenery
said
dhupar
chakr
s
chief
technology
officer
but
as
trees
were
felled
and
roads
widened
to
accommodate
more
cars
dhupar
then
in
high
school
developed
chronic
respiratory
problems
doctors
put
him
on
medication
and
warned
him
to
stop
playing
sports
my
problem
is
whenever
i
start
to
run
out
of
air
the
anxiety
levels
shoot
up
he
said
dhupar
said
many
of
his
family
and
friends
have
also
developed
respiratory
issues
diesel
exhaust
contributed
to
just
percent
of
all
air
pollution
deaths
in
india
in
according
to
the
health
effects
institute
but
in
confined
spaces
in
urban
areas
where
many
generators
are
used
it
represents
a
larger
risk
said
pankaj
sadavarte
one
of
the
report
s
researchers
india
has
in
place
policies
to
monitor
and
restrict
air
pollution
but
they
can
be
difficult
to
enforce
experts
say
worries
about
air
pollution
are
growing
however
last
november
the
capital
launched
its
first
air
quality
emergency
action
plan
during
a
particularly
hazardous
week
when
pollution
spiked
the
government
halted
construction
within
the
city
raised
parking
fees
to
discourage
driving
and
shut
schools
to
keep
children
indoors
the
national
ministry
of
environment
forest
and
climate
change
is
drafting
a
national
policy
to
clean
india
s
air
though
its
release
has
been
delayed
said
sunil
dahiya
a
senior
campaigner
with
greenpeace
india
the
air
pollution
debate
and
health
debate
is
picking
up
in
india
dahiya
said
in
a
telephone
interview
that
momentum
is
forcing
the
policymakers
to
make
our
cities
