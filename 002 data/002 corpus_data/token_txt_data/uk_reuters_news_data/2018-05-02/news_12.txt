new
york
reuters
the
dollar
was
off
its
highs
of
the
day
and
treasury
yields
eased
on
wednesday
after
the
federal
reserve
held
interest
rates
steady
and
gave
no
signals
it
was
in
a
rush
to
increase
the
pace
of
rate
hikes
in
its
statement
the
fed
expressed
confidence
that
a
recent
rise
in
inflation
to
near
the
central
bank
s
target
would
be
sustained
leaving
it
on
track
to
raise
borrowing
costs
in
june
while
it
also
said
inflation
on
a
basis
is
expected
to
run
near
the
committee
s
symmetric
percent
objective
over
the
medium
ahead
of
the
statement
some
investors
were
nervous
the
fed
might
sound
more
hawkish
on
policy
tightening
after
recent
concerns
about
rising
inflation
it
looks
like
it
maybe
calmed
some
nerves
of
investors
who
maybe
were
expecting
a
faster
pace
of
hikes
because
of
the
rise
in
inflation
