the
worsening

levels
is
like
walking
into
a
category
hurricane
protected
by
only
an
umbrella
she
said
in
a
speech
right
now
we
are
talking

said
countries
face
limits
on
how
much
they
can
adapt
to
coming
changes
such
as
worsening

we
live
in
constant
fear
that
a
direct
hit
from

could
wipe

altogether
