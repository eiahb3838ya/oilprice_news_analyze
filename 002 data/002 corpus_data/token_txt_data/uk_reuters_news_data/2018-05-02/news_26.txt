preview-buffett draws them in even as berkshire comes up short
reuters
he
thinks
of
himself
as
a
teacher
and
to
many
he
is
an
icon
but
to
wall
street
warren
buffett
is
something
quite
different
a
disappointment
tens
of
thousands
of
berkshire
hathaway
inc
shareholders
and
fans
may
think
otherwise
as
they
flock
to
omaha
nebraska
this
weekend
to
see
buffett
and
his
longtime
partner
and
fellow
billionaire
charlie
munger
the
weekend
will
celebrate
their
success
running
a
conglomerate
now
with
businesses
overseen
on
a
daily
basis
by
two
potential
buffett
successors
vice
chairmen
greg
abel
and
ajit
jain
but
recent
results
relative
to
what
analysts
were
counting
on
were
of
a
sort
that
might
make
chief
executives
at
other
companies
hang
their
heads
berkshire
s
operating
profit
excluding
investments
and
derivatives
has
fallen
short
of
wall
street
forecasts
for
eight
consecutive
quarters
while
its
cash
stake
swelled
to
billion
billion
pounds
because
buffett
could
not
find
enough
worth
buying
in
contrast
just
percent
of
standard
poor
companies
typically
miss
forecasts
in
any
given
quarter
while
percent
beat
forecasts
berkshire
has
a
chance
to
break
its
streak
on
saturday
morning
when
it
is
scheduled
to
report
results
obviously
the
quarterly
results
matter
but
i
care
about
what
they
re
doing
said
paul
lountzis
founder
of
lountzis
asset
management
llc
in
wyomissing
pennsylvania
who
has
been
to
more
than
meetings
and
is
attending
this
weekend
though
you
may
be
upset
with
all
the
cash
they
have
if
there
is
a
challenge
across
the
world
or
liquidity
dries
up
he
s
going
to
step
in
and
take
advantage
he
added
referring
to
buffett
predicting
results
can
be
hard
because
berkshire
s
tentacles
spread
far
its
products
and
services
include
car
insurance
geico
mobile
homes
clayton
wind
power
berkshire
hathaway
energy
cowboy
boots
justin
brands
chocolate
see
s
helium
balloon
inflators
western
enterprises
and
electronic
sow
feeding
systems
perhaps
unsurprisingly
pigtek
berkshire
hathaway
is
a
challenging
company
to
analyse
and
does
not
manage
its
results
to
meet
street
expectations
barclays
analyst
jay
gelb
wrote
last
week
insurance
underwriting
has
dragged
on
recent
results
and
berkshire
last
year
paid
out
billions
of
dollars
for
hurricane
losses
but
a
tailwind
from
an
improving
economy
boosted
shipments
on
the
bnsf
railroad
and
bolstered
berkshire
s
building
materials
and
consumer
businesses
gelb
expects
operating
profit
to
rise
percent
in
that
could
help
berkshire
s
stock
price
which
closed
on
tuesday
about
percent
below
its
peak
on
questions
about
berkshire
will
likely
comprise
a
majority
of
the
roughly
questions
that
buffett
and
munger
will
field
over
five
hours
at
saturday
s
annual
shareholder
meeting
there
s
always
something
to
learn
said
brandon
taylor
managing
partner
of
taylor
hoffman
wealth
management
in
richmond
virginia
attending
his
sixth
meeting
this
year
knowledge
compounds
over
time
and
the
more
i
expose
myself
to
investors
who
are
better
than
me
the
better
off
i
will
berkshire
sent
out
slightly
more
tickets
to
this
year
s
extravaganza
than
in
when
an
estimated
celebrated
buffett
s
year
at
the
helm
a
couple
of
million
may
watch
buffett
and
munger
online
this
year
via
yahoo
finance
as
usual
there
will
also
be
events
across
omaha
including
investing
conferences
and
shareholder
shopping
at
businesses
at
the
jeweller
borsheim
s
for
example
silver
pens
bearing
buffett
s
signature
fetch
while
a
argyle
pink
diamond
can
be
yours
for
the
bargain
price
of
normally
million
but
the
meeting
remains
the
highlight
it
may
give
buffett
and
munger
a
chance
to
address
progress
on
berkshire
s
joint
venture
with
inc
and
jpmorgan
chase
co
to
lower
employee
healthcare
costs
or
the
scandals
hurting
the
stock
price
and
reputation
of
wells
fargo
co
one
of
berkshire
s
biggest
investments
buffett
and
munger
will
likely
also
get
questions
about
matters
outside
their
comfort
zones
such
as
bitcoin
or
perhaps
dysfunction
in
washington
while
buffett
is
a
democrat
and
munger
a
republican
both
are
critics
of
shortsightedness
and
stupidity
the
meeting
is
a
rejuvenation
of
all
the
investment
values
and
principles
that
warren
and
charlie
impart
