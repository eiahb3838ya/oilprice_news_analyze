the

colour
of
his

the
shi

pulled

praise
him
for
signing
saddam
s
death
warrant
in
and
for
refusing
to
allow
forces
to
stay
in
iraq
beyond
but
during
eight
years
in
office
maliki
was
also
perceived
as
an
inveterate
sectarian
who
alienated
the
minority
sunnis
and
kurds
by
shutting
them
out
of
key
security
positions
and
undermining
when
he
became
prime
minister
he
continued
to
function
as
an
underground
dawa
operative
he
put
in
place
shadow
dawa
cells
in
each
ministry
reporting
directly
to
him
and
not
the

said
a

who
served

it
wouldn
t
be
to
say
that
he
created
a

security
services
reporting
directly
to
him
the
former

told
reuters
responding
to
accusations
maliki
ran
a
parallel
government
his
media
adviser
abbas
said
the
former
prime
minister
was
at
times
forced
to
launch
initiatives
directly
to
boost
the
economy
when
he
felt
ministers
from
other
groups
were
delaying
or
obstructing

the
door
for

to
become

on
the
face
of
it
maliki
s
campaign
call
for
a
political
majority
government
to
make
the
administration
more
efficient
and
cohesive
could
be
seen
as
a
break
with
his
past
maliki
is
proposing
to
replace
the
system
whereby
the
cabinet
must
reflect
the
parliamentary
representation
of
political
parties
with
a
governing
majority
and
a
opposition
minority
but
ite
politicians
fear
the
plan
could
keep
the
main
ite
groups
out
of
government
and
reduce
their
influence
in
contrast
to
the
more
inclusive
policies
of
abadi
shi
ite
religious
parties
have
been
controlling
the
key
positions
of
the
state
public
administrations
and
security
services
since
having
a
political
majority
rule
under
these
conditions
will
remove
all
the
checks
and
balances
ite
parties
have
said
jaber
a
sunni
mp
opponents
say
the
proposed
system
would
in
practise
allow
a
prime
minister
to
chose
kurd
or
sunni
ministers
who
are
not
representatives
of
the
main
kurdish
or
sunni
parties
as
long
as
they
were
qualified
and
agreed
on
a
common
programme
the
claims
that
there
is
a
deep
state
controlled
by
the
dawa
is
a
big
lie
said
saad
a
lawmaker
from
maliki
s
group
in
parliament
the
previous
maliki
governments
were
partnership
cabinets
and
the
political
forces
that
took
part
in
them
share
the
credit
of
success
and
the
blame
of
failure
he
said
maliki
s
followers
see
his
removal
in
as
a
conspiracy
because
he
championed
shi
ite
interests
in
iraq
and
the
region
he
is
a
strong
leader
he
is
not
afraid
of
confrontation

a

in
the
shi

holy
city
of
kerbala
south
of
the
capital
baghdad
in

maliki
sided
with
shi

neighbour
iran
and
bashar
in
the
civil

pitting
the
syrian
president
against
predominantly
sunni
opponents
backed
by
saudi
arabia
qatar
and
turkey
like
many
iraqi
shi
ite
leaders
maliki
is
closely
tied
to
iran
where
he
built
relationships
during
his
exile
in
his
election
campaign
maliki
continues
to
advocate
an
line
implicitly
criticising
abadi
for
rebuilding
bridges
with
riyadh
and
other
sunni
capitals
i
had
told
these
countries
that
i
won
t
allow
the
regime
in
syria
to
fall
he
said
in
an
april
interview
to
al
mayadeen
a
lebanese
tv
channel
close
to
assad
who
belongs
to
the
alawite
sect
which
is
an
offshoot
of
shi
ism
saudi
arabia
failed
in
syria
and
it
is
trying
now
to
bring
iraq
to
the
saudi
alliance
iraq
can
t
be
part
of
this
alliance
he
said
in
an
apparent
reference
to
a
conference
in
kuwait
in
february
to
raise
funds
for
abadi
to
rebuild
iraq
as
the
leader
of
the

command
a
solid
base
of
shi

support
in
the
election
especially
from
religious
shi
ites
wary

but
this
time
round
the
shi

vote
looks
set
to
be
split
between
three
frontrunners
abadi
maliki
and
another
ally
of
iran
militia
leader
hadi
whose
stature
and
popularity
rose
after
he
commanded
the
fight
against
islamic
state
if
no
clear
winner
emerges
maliki
will
have
to
call
on
all
his
negotiating
skills
again
to
secure
a
governing
alliance

risk
being
sidelined
