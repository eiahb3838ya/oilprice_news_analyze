the

against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
and
world
stock
indexes

expectations
that
the
fed
will
signal
more
policy
tightening
ahead
kept
some
investors
cautious
the
fed
is
likely
to
announce
at
edt
gmt
that
it
is
holding
interest
rates
steady
but
it
could
encourage
expectations
of
a
rate
increase
in
june
a
fed
could
further
boost
the
dollar
which
has
roared
higher
in
recent
weeks
erasing
its
losses
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
the
gains
came
amid
signs
the
fed
will
be
the
only
major
central
bank
to
raise
rates
in
the
coming
months
the
fed
may
be
reluctant
to
increase
market
expectations
of
further
tightening
until
it
sees
more
data
however
markets
are
currently
pricing
in
an
additional
two
rate
hikes
this
year
i
don
t
think
the
fed
is
going
to
want
markets
to
price
in
more
tightening
