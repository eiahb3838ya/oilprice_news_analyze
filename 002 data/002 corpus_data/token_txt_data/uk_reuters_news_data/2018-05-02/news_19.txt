biofuels
policy
the
latest
in
a
series
of
such

aimed

helping
refiners
cope
with
the
renewable
fuel
standard
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter

republicans

will
take
place
on
monday
or
tuesday
they
said
white
house
spokeswoman
kelly
love
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
biofuels
groups
have
complained
that
the
trump
administration
is
granting
too
many
exemptions
to
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
which
requires
refineries
to
mix
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
or
to
purchase
credits
from
rivals
that
do
the
law
was
intended
to
support
farmers
reduce
pollution
and
cut
petroleum
imports
exemptions
were
meant
to
benefit
smaller
refiners
who
may
not
be
able
to
do
the
blending
or
purchase
the
credits
while
the
regulation
has
created
a
market
for
ethanol
refiners
complain
the
requirements
now
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
per
year
they
have
urged
the
trump
administration
to
make
changes
like
capping
the
price
of
blending
credits
or
shifting
the
blending
obligation
away
from
refiners
entirely
the
ethanol
industry
has
vehemently
opposed
those
proposals
saying
they
would
undermine
demand
for
biofuels
and
also
hurt
farm
income
numerous
meetings
on
the
topic
since
late
last
year
appeared
to
end
in
deadlock
last
month
president
donald
trump
announced
he
would
consider
expanding
the
times
of
year
that
high
ethanol
blend
gasoline
can
be
sold
a
concession
to
the
corn
industry
keen
to
boost
its
share
of
the
motor
fuel
market
at
the
same
time
trump
s
environmental
protection
agency
epa
has
been
issuing
more
rfs
exemptions
to
small
refineries
than
the
obama
administration
did
while
plants
receiving
the
exemptions
are
small
their
owners
are
some
of
the
largest
refiners
including
andeavor
which
marathon
petroleum
hopes
to
acquire
for
billion
the
surge
in
exemptions
follows
a
federal
court
ruling
in
august
that
says
the
epa
was
using
guidelines
in
denying
applications
that
were
too
strict
biofuel
groups
say
the
epa
is
using
the
court
decision
to
justify
gutting
the
rfs
prices
of
compliance
credits
have
plummeted
on
news
of
the
refinery
exemptions
the
epa
also
granted
a
waiver
to
a
refinery
owned
by
billionaire
carl
icahn
a
former
adviser
to
president
donald
trump
according
to
two
industry
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
oil
majors
exxonmobil
and
chevron
have
also
applied
for
waivers
at
their
small
refineries
a
biofuels
trade
group
asked
a
federal
court
on
tuesday
to
rule
whether
the
epa
violated
the
law
in
granting
a
growing
number
of
small
refineries
exemptions
from
renewable
fuel
laws
