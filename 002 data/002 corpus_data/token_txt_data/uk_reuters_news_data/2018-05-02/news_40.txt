electric
utilities
are
expected
to
shut
hundreds
more
of
their
power
generators
in
the
coming
years
extending
a
long
trend
away
from
coal
and
toward
natural
gas
that
has
cast
a
pall
over
the
mining
industry
but
not
every
coal
company
sees
a
bleak
future
ramaco
resources
which
produces
coal
for
steel
mills
and
consol
energy
which
supplies
coal
to
larger
power
plants
have
ramped
up
investments
even
as
the
industry
shrinks
president
donald
trump
has
promised
to
revive
the
coal
sector
by
stripping
away
burdensome
regulation
but
the
two
companies
say
their
confidence
stems
more
from
market
forces
than
any
policy
their
bullish
bets
illustrate
how
pockets
of
profitable
growth
can
survive
in
troubled
industries
facing
almost
certain
decline
ramaco
for
example
expects
global
demand
for
metallurgical
coal
to
rise
in
step
with
economic
growth
despite
the
slump
in
demand
for
the
type
of
coal
used
in
electric
power
generators
and
consol
says
it
has
found
a
way
to
turn
the
rapid
decline
of
power
into
a
strength
it
has
cultivated
a
clientele
that
owns
big
generators
that
are
not
expected
to
shut
down
anytime
soon
making
them
likely
to
take
over
business
from
rivals
that
do
close
we
can
sell
every
ounce
of
coal
we
can
produce
said
david
khani
consol
s
chief
financial
officer
this
isn
t
true
for
consol
which
mines
thermal
coal
for
power
plants
in
pennsylvania
boosted
capital
spending
last
year
by
percent
to
million
and
it
aims
to
bump
that
to
million
in
according
to
its
filings
ramaco
meanwhile
more
than
tripled
capital
expenditures
in
to
million
making
it
one
of
the
few
coal
producers
investing
in
new
mines
the
company
went
public
in
february
at
a
tough
time
for
the
industry
those
spending
increases
far
outpace
the
broader
sector
overall
the
coal
industry
increased
capital
spending
in
by
about
percent
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
filings
from
miners
a
rebound
from
years
of
steep
declines
targeted
mainly
at
sustaining
operations
rather
than
expanding
many
individual
coal
firms
have
cut
back
capital
spending
they
re
spending
as
much
as
they
need
to
to
maintain
production
said
analyst
john
bridges
of
jp
morgan
coal
production
is
expected
to
dip
percent
in
to
million
tons
down
from
billion
tons
a
decade
ago
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
ramaco
s
spending
reflects
its
opening
of
five
new
coal
mines
in
the
past
twelve
months
in
west
virginia
virginia
and
pennsylvania
said
randall
atkins
ramaco
s
executive
chairman
the
company
expects
to
produce
more
than
million
tons
of
coal
in
from
less
than
in
the
company
said
the
downturn
in
the
thermal
coal
industry
has
little
to
do
with
its
business
it
and
other
metallurgical
coal
producers
are
enjoying
robust
demand
from
steel
producers
around
the
globe
met
coal
is
a
proxy
for
steel
which
is
in
turn
a
proxy
for
a
nation
s
gdp
atkins
said
the
world
finds
itself
economically
in
a
good
he
said
trump
s
steel
tariffs
could
shift
some
of
the
demand
for
metallurgical
coal
to
the
domestic
market
but
that
foreign
demand
for
exports
also
remains
strong
ramaco
s
share
price
has
been
volatile
since
launching
last
year
it
is
trading
at
about
up
from
about
late
last
year
after
strong
earnings
estimates
but
that
s
only
about
half
of
its
share
price
last
year
in
part
because
one
of
its
new
mining
projects
was
delayed
most
miners
producing
coal
for
electricity
are
getting
battered
meanwhile
by
cheap
natural
gas
and
increasingly
stringent
pollution
controls
consol
is
betting
it
can
generate
hefty
profits
from
a
smart
play
on
the
downturn
it
plans
to
serve
very
large
retrofitted
coal
plants
that
compete
well
against
natgas
and
which
are
going
to
be
running
at
a
higher
capacity
as
other
units
are
retired
said
cfo
khani
those
plants
are
currently
running
at
only
about
percent
capacity
he
said
providing
room
for
growth
the
eia
predicts
that
generators
that
remain
open
could
operate
above
percent
capacity
for
decades
as
other
aging
plants
close
plants
are
using
less
than
percent
of
their
capacity
now
consol
whose
shares
are
up
to
about
a
share
from
about
late
last
year
supplies
east
coast
power
generating
companies
including
dominion
southern
duke
and
dte
both
consol
and
ramaco
applaud
the
trump
administration
s
stance
but
their
reasons
for
optimism
lie
elsewhere
there
has
been
no
legislation
that
would
allow
for
increasing
domestic
demand
for
coal

ramaco
s
atkins
