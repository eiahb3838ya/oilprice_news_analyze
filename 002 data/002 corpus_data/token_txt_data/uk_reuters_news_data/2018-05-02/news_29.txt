update 2-eu launches battle for bigger post-brexit budget
brussels
reuters
the
european
commission
proposed
a
bigger
new
budget
on
wednesday
that
will
trigger
battles
among
member
states
over
how
to
fill
the
funding
gap
left
by
britain
s
exit
next
year
the
dutch
led
the
charge
for
rich
northern
states
unwilling
to
step
into
the
brexit
breach
a
smaller
eu
should
have
a
smaller
budget
prime
minister
mark
rutte
said
against
that
france
s
agriculture
minister
called
it
simply
unthinkable
to
shave
percent
off
brussels
hefty
spending
on
farm
subsidies
poland
which
the
commission
has
in
its
sights
with
a
new
mechanism
to
penalize
authoritarian
governments
that
impinge
on
independent
judges
warned
of
a
long
road
ahead
to
reach
the
unanimous
compromise
required
to
put
the
budget
into
effect
germany
the
biggest
paymaster
was
cautious
repeating
its
readiness
like
france
to
spend
more
but
only
if
it
was
fair
with
today
s
proposal
we
have
put
forward
a
pragmatic
plan
for
how
to
do
more
with
less
commission
president
juncker
told
the
european
parliament
in
launching
the
proposal
to
spend
about
percent
more
in
as
a
share
of
output
among
highlights
are
sharp
increases
in
spending
on
border
defenses
against
illegal
immigration
as
well
as
on
foreign
aid
plus
more
investment
in
common
eu
defense
schemes
research
and
technology
and
on
helping
euro
zone
governments
in
difficulty
his
plan
to
spend
about
percent
of
the
nations
combined
economic
production
compare
to
percent
of
the
multiannual
financial
framework
now
in
place
it
is
worth
trillion
euros
trillion
adjusting
for
future
inflation
or
trillion
euros
at
today
s
prices
about
billion
euros
a
year
compared
to
billion
now
that
the
commission
argues
will
be
less
than
a
daily
cup
of
coffee
for
million
europeans
and
is
cheap
at
the
price
national
governments
typically
tax
and
spend
times
as
much
the
proposal
asks
member
states
to
let
brussels
raise
new
money
directly
from
new
taxes
on
plastics
designed
also
to
help
the
environment
and
on
big
global
tech
firms
but
it
will
also
require
governments
in
the
wealthier
west
to
chip
in
more
as
britain
stops
paying
its
annual
billion
euros
or
so
some
will
also
see
eu
rebates
phased
out
over
five
years
a
budget
for
a
europe
that
protects
empowers
and
defends
was
the
commission
s
chosen
slogan
for
the
day
that
language
reflects
a
campaign
from
brussels
to
persuade
voters
the
bloc
remains
relevant
after
a
decade
of
crisis
that
has
seen
ferocious
austerity
in
countries
hit
by
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
and
uproar
over
the
arrival
of
more
than
a
million
irregular
migrants
across
the
mediterranean
in
alone
a
europe
that
protects
has
also
become
a
familiar
demand
from
french
president
emmanuel
macron
as
he
tries
to
work
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
to
tighten
integration
after
the
british
have
left
while
easing
fears
among
voters
that
the
eu
means
open
borders
and
jobs
exported
abroad
furious
battles
among
member
governments
however
may
cast
a
shadow
over
the
commission
s
efforts
to
patch
over
rifts
as
juncker
tries
to
rally
east
and
west
north
and
south
big
and
small
states
behind
a
relaunch
next
year
eu
budget
commissioner
guenther
oettinger
who
has
called
for
states
to
show
unprecedented
speed
and
agree
the
budget
within
a
year
or
so
said
it
was
inevitable
that
there
will
be
disputes
there
will
be
cuts
which
many
countries
will
complain
about
he
told
german
television
and
there
will
be
new
spending
which
the
others
will
complain
