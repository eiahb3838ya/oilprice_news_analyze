reden
solar
a
niche
solar
energy
player
backed
by
private
equity
funds
is
looking
to
buy
solar
projects
to
take
advantage
of
a
government
push
to
boost
renewable
energy
in
france
france
has
been
a
laggard
in
renewables
as
its
relies
on
nuclear
for
about
three
quarters
of
its
electricity
needs
but
this
could
change
now
president
emmanuel
macron
has
made
solar
energy
the
focus
of
french
renewable
energy
policies
against
this
backdrop
reden
hopes
to
grow
quickly
rather
than
risk
being
swallowed
by
big
companies
like
engie
or
total
with
the
financial
clout
of
our
shareholders
we
can
grow
if
a
company
comes
on
the
market
we
could
be
interested
reden
ceo
thierry
carcel
said
an
ipo
is
a
possibility
though
there
are
no
plans
currently
based
in
agen
southern
france
reden
split
off
from
renewables
group
fonroche
last
year
when
infrastructure
fund
infravia
bought
a
percent
stake
alongside
listed
investment
company
eurazeo
which
has
percent
reden
has
a
percent
market
share
of
france
s
solar
market
with
megawatts
of
installed
capacity
this
puts
it
in
the
top
ten
in
a
country
where
market
leader
edf
energies
nouvelles
megawatt
accounts
for
only
about
percent
of
total
capacity
according
to
consultancy
finergreen
france
had
just
gigawatts
gw
of
solar
capacity
installed
at
the
end
of
compared
to
germany
s
gw
but
utility
edf
plans
to
build
gw
by
and
the
french
government
has
doubled
tender
volume
for
solar
projects
sparking
a
race
for
size
among
the
many
medium
size
companies
in
the
industry
there
are
four
to
six
significant
players
left
in
france
including
reden
the
small
ones
will
be
eaten
maybe
by
total
maybe
by
us

infravia
ceo
vincent

which
manages
billion
euros
billion
of
assets
in
sold

in
solar

soparsol
and
soley
after
holding
on
to
them
for
about
five
years
we
are
ready
to
follow
reden
if
it
makes
acquisitions

patrimoine
one
of
the
funds
under

which

finergreen
ceo
damien
ricordeau
sees
rapid
consolidation
in
the
next
year
with
the
top
solar
firms
capturing
percent
of
installed
capacity
things
are
moving
fast
we
expect
of
the
top
players
will
disappear
by
ricordeau
said
since
france
s
energy
giants
have
been
slow
to
invest
in
solar
about
the
only
way
to
catch
up
is
through
m
a
engie
in
bought
solairedirect
total
in
september
bought
into
renewables
firm
eren
and
last
month
bought
power
retailer
direct
energie

itself
had
just
bought

also
on
