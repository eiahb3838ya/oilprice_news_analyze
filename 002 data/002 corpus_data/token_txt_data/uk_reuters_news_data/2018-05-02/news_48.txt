rising
oil
prices
over
the
last
two
years
have
put
the
issue
of
demand
destruction
back
on
the
agenda
as
producers
traders
and
analysts
try
to
estimate
how
consumers
will
respond
demand
destruction
always
becomes
a
topic
of
discussion
during
this
stage
of
the
price
cycle
and
the
current
discussion
resembles
previous
episodes
of
high
and
rising
prices
in
and
brent
prices
have
surged
by
per
barrel
percent
from
their
low
point
in
early
and
are
now
trading
close
to
per
barrel
over
the
same
period
gasoline
pump
prices
have
risen
by
almost
per
gallon
percent
and
now
stand
just
a
few
cents
below
per
gallon
crude
and
gasoline
prices
are
still
well
below
the
levels
of
per
barrel
and
per
gallon
where
they
stood
just
before
oil
prices
started
slumping
at
the
end
of
june
but
crude
and
fuels
are
no
longer
particularly
cheap
and
most
traders
and
oil
exporting
nations
expect
prices
to
increase
further
over
the
next
year
in
real
terms
oil
prices
are
close
to
the
average
level
for
the
whole
of
the
last
cycle
from
late
through
early
as
the
matures
and
prices
move
towards
their
next
peak
the
focus
on
consumer
responses
is
set
to
intensify
in
an
early
sign
of
political
sensitivity
in
consuming
countries
president
donald
trump
blamed
opec
for
rising
oil
prices
via
a
message
on
his
twitter
account
on
april
oil
prices
are
artificially
very
high
no
good
and
will
not
be
accepted
the
president
wrote
with
his
customary
directness
in
contrast
opec
officials
have
indicated
they
see
no
adverse
impact
on
oil
consumption
as
a
result
of
price
increases
so
far
i
have
not
seen
any
impact
on
demand
with
current
prices
we
have
seen
prices
significantly
higher
in
the
past
twice
as
much
as
where
we
are
today
saudi
arabia
s
oil
minister
told
reporters
in
jeddah
reduced
energy
intensity
and
higher
productivity
globally
of
energy
input
levels
leads
me
to
think
that
there
is
capacity
to
absorb
higher
prices
the
minister
said
on
april
this
part
of
the
cycle
is
normally
characterised
by
a
game
of
guess
the
threshold
at
which
rising
prices
start
to
destroy
oil
demand
in
recent
weeks
some
analysts
have
suggested
demand
destruction
will
begin
if
and
when
prices
rise
above
per
barrel
while
others
put
the
threshold
as
high
as
others
express
the
same
idea
by
suggesting
per
gallon
or
even
is
the
psychologically
important
limit
for
motorists
but
identifying
a
specific
price
threshold
is
probably
the
wrong
way
to
think
about
the
issue
of
prices
and
consumption
in
reality
there
is
a
continuum
of
consumer
responses
to
price
ranging
from
demand
stimulation
to
demand
destruction
the
lower
prices
fall
and
the
longer
they
are
expected
to
stay
there
the
more
consumption
tends
to
be
stimulated
the
higher
prices
rise
and
the
longer
they
are
predicted
to
stay
up
the
more
consumption
tends
to
be
destroyed
the
response
of
consumption
to
prices
is
continuous
but
highly
the
response
also
takes
time
to
materialise
as
consumers
slowly
adjust
their
behaviour
and
buy
new
equipment
and
it
takes
even
longer
to
appear
in
the
official
consumption
statistics
due
to
reporting
delays
adding
to
the
complexity
oil
consumption
is
also
responsive
to
other
factors
including
economic
growth
and
incomes
car
ownership
and
vehicle
fleet
growth
average
miles
travelled
and
average
miles
per
gallon
some
of
these
factors
are
themselves
more
or
less
related
to
oil
prices
at
different
timescales
which
makes
the
analysis
even
more
complicated
for
example
oil
prices
have
an
impact
on
choices
about
fuel
economy
when
new
vehicles
are
purchased
as
a
result
it
is
notoriously
difficult
to
estimate
the
of
oil
demand
and
economists
have
generated
widely
varying
estimates
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
oil
consumption
does
respond
to
price
changes
and
the
response
is
not
geared
to
any
particular
threshold
the
relationship
between
prices
and
oil
consumption
is
evident
in
the
global
statistics
at
least
for
the
countries
in
the
oecd
though
it
is
not
so
clear
for
low
and
countries
outside
the
oecd
oil
consumption
in
countries
has
increased
every
year
since
with
the
single
exception
of
for
a
chartbook
click
here
in
these
countries
rising
consumption
has
been
driven
by
fast
economic
growth
rising
household
incomes
and
increasing
vehicle
ownership
which
has
dominated
and
masked
any
price
effects
by
contrast
in
the
oecd
growth
in
incomes
and
vehicle
ownership
has
been
more
moderate
and
the
impact
of
prices
on
consumption
is
readily
apparent
oecd
oil
consumption
fell
in
and
all
periods
associated
with
high
real
oil
prices
conversely
oecd
consumption
rose
very
rapidly
between
and
and
again
between
and
when
real
prices
were
relatively
low
there
are
some
nuances
including
the
elimination
of
oil
from
heating
and
power
generation
during
the
and
and
the
complicated
interaction
between
the
oil
shocks
and
recessions
but
the
basic
relationship
between
prices
and
consumption
for
the
oecd
is
clear
oil
prices
have
not
usually
risen
high
enough
to
reduce
total
global
demand
because
consumption
has
continued
growing
but
high
prices
tend
to
temper
demand
growth
through
their
impact
on
oecd
consumption
the
same
basic
relationship
can
be
traced
between
gasoline
prices
traffic
volumes
and
gasoline
consumption
punctuated
by
the
occasional
recession
the
decline
in
gasoline
prices
contributed
to
a
notable
acceleration
in
gasoline
consumption
growth
in
compared
with
the
preceding
years
but
gasoline
consumption
was
flat
in
and
is
expected
to
grow
by
just
barrels
per
day
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
energy
outlook
eia
april
mirror
the
escalation
of
oil
prices
since
the
start
of
has
probably
started
to
restrain
consumption
growth
compared
with
a
baseline
in
which
prices
had
remained
at
per
barrel
so
far
the
demand
restraint
from
increasing
prices
has
been
offset
by
synchronised
global
growth
especially
in
the
countries
that
account
for
a
rising
share
of
oil
use
if
prices
continue
to
increase
however
there
will
come
a
point
at
which
consumption
growth
starts
to
slow
in
a
much
more
pronounced
fashion
unfortunately
experience
suggests
the
extent
of
the
demand
deceleration
will
only
become
apparent
after
it
is
already
well
underway
and
the
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
will
continue
even
once
prices
stop
rising
given
the
long
lags
in
the
system
between
and
when
oil
prices
averaged
over
per
barrel
declining
consumption
in
the
oecd
and
slowing
consumption
growth
in
the
created
the
conditions
for
the
last
oil
slump
if
oil
prices
continue
to
increase
as
most
hedge
fund
managers
and
nations
expect
the
same
scenario
could
play
out
