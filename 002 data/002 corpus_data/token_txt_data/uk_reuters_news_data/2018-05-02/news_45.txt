world
stocks
inched
higher
on
wednesday
after
two
days
of
losses
but
remained
pinned
down
by
the
dollar
s
recent
surge
and
expectations
that
a

later
in

will

later
in
the
day
currency
markets
have
been
in
the
limelight
this
week
with
the
dollar
roaring
higher
to
erase
all
losses
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
it
stands
now
at
month
highs
on
growing
signs
the
fed
will
be
the
only
major
central
bank
to
raise
interest
rates
in
the
coming
months
in
contrast
to
the
united
states
where
inflation
and
growth
indicators
have
generally
surprised
to
the
upside
rate
rise
expectations
elsewhere
have
receded
after
a
string
of
disappointing
economic
data
expectations
of
a
bank
of
england
rate
hike
this
month
have
virtually
been
priced
out
while
the
european
central
bank
as
well
as
central
banks
in
japan
switzerland
and
sweden
have
all
hinted
that
policy
tightening
remains
some
way
off
the
fed
should
announce
at
gmt
that
it
is
holding
interest
rates
steady
but
will
likely
encourage
expectations
of
an
increase
in
borrowing
costs
in
june
those
expectations
were
strengthened
after
a
survey
on
tuesday
suggested
inflationary
pressures
were
building
it
is
this
concern
around
inflation
and
the
robustness
of
the
economy
that
is
likely
to
dominate
when
the
fed
concludes
its
meeting
said
michael
hewson
chief
market
analyst
at
cmc
markets
in
london
it
will
offer
policymakers
a
decent
opportunity
to
critique
the
health
of
the
that
dollar
eased
slightly
however
after
two
days
of
robust
gains
as
the
euro
firmed
percent
off
lows
hit
on
tuesday
but
world
stocks
remained
under
pressure
eking
out
a
meagre
percent
rise
after
two
days
of
hefty
losses
that
was
despite
a
stronger
close
for
wall
street
driven
by
optimism
over
trade
issues
and
generally
buoyant
company
results
shares
in
apple
rose
percent
in
trade
after
its
results
exceeded
expectations
especially
in
sales
apple
shares
listed
in
germany
surged
almost
percent
and
were
some
percent
higher
in
trade
its
results
also
helped
european
equities
almost
half
a
percent
higher
european
tech
firms
including
apple
suppliers
such
as
ams
rose
strongly
with
a
tech
shares
index
hitting
a
peak
the
tech
giant
s
results
are
the
icing
on
the
cake
for
companies
on
the
s
index
which
have
posted
earnings
growth
around
percent
according
to
thomson
reuters
but
markets
have
reacted
cautiously
due
to
concerns
for
the
profits
outlook
given
cost
pressures
stemming
from
oil
and
metals
prices
hitting
highs
in
recent
weeks
market
participants
may
be
starting
to
wonder
that
perhaps
this
is
as
good
as
it
s
going
to
get
said
stephen
innes
head

oanda
in
singapore
stock
markets
are
also
nervous
about
the
recent
rise
in

with

just
below

german

selloff

just
below
those
levels
markets
are
awaiting
growth
data
a
number
drawing
more
attention
than
usual
because
of
recent
signs
of
slowdown
economists
polled
by
reuters
predicted
percent
growth
versus
a
percent
increase
in
the
previous
quarter
national
gdps
released
so
far
point
to
a
sharper
slowdown
in
than
forecast
analysts
at
mizuho
said
in
a
note
a
weak
reading
could
further
pummel
the
euro
as

market
pricing
already
suggests
the
