apple
lifted
tech
shares
on
wednesday
putting

on

for
a
firmer

despite
some
trepidation
over
a

later
in

expectations
the
federal
reserve
will
signal
more
policy
tightening
ahead
kept
investors
wary
of
big
market
moves
especially
after
currency
markets
were
roiled
this
week
by
the
dollar
s
surge
to
highs
against
a
basket
of
currencies
but
the

edged
back
down
after

s
percent
rise
allowing
world
stocks
to
rise
after
two
days
of

following

the

expectations
in
the
first

thanks
to
robust

and
it
announced
a

apple

the

news
from

has
been
taken
well
and
there
s
a
relief

today
across

which
had

said
neil
campling
of
the
global

at

the

campling
said
the
apple
results
had
raised
some
red
flags
including
high
inventory
levels
and
a
lower
average
selling
price
for
its
handsets
it
s
a
strange
thing
to
do
to
increase
inventory
so
sharply
there
will
be
more
questions
about
where
do
we
go
from
here
he
said
that
uncertainty
about
future
profits
alongside
the
possibility
of
higher
interest
rates
is
weighing
on
other
sectors
too
even
though
s
companies
posted
percent
earnings
growth
in
the
first
quarter
according
to
thomson
reuters
oil
and
metals
prices
near
highs
are
a
major
concern
leaving
market
players
wondering
if
perhaps
this
is
as
good
as
it
s
going
to
get
said
stephen
innes
head
of

in
singapore
yields
hovered
just
below
recent
highs
above
percent
german
yields
dragged
to
highs
by
the
bond
selloff
stood
just
below
those
levels
the
fed
is
likely
to
announce
at
gmt
that
it
is
holding
interest
rates
steady
but
it
will
probably
encourage
expectations
of
a
rate
increase
in
june
those
expectations
were
strengthened
after
a
survey
on
tuesday
suggested
inflationary
pressures
were
building
a
fed
could
further
boost
the
dollar
which
has
roared
higher
in
recent
weeks
erasing
its
losses
versus
a
basket
of
currencies
the
gains
came
amid
signs
the
fed
will
be
the
only
major
central
bank
to
raise
rates
in
the
coming
months
it
is
this
concern
around
inflation
and
the
robustness
of
the
economy
that
is
likely
to
dominate
when
the
fed
concludes
its
meeting
said
michael
hewson
chief
market
analyst
at
cmc
markets
in
london
it
will
offer
policymakers
a
decent
opportunity
to
critique
the
health
of
the
in
contrast
to
the
united
states
rate
rise
expectations
elsewhere
have
receded
after
disappointing
economic
data
expectations
of
a
bank
of
england
rate
rise
this
month
have
virtually
been
priced
out
the
european
central
bank
and
central
banks
in
japan
switzerland
and
sweden
have
all
hinted
that
policy
tightening
remains
some
way
off
fresh
data
confirmed
that
expectation
for
the
euro
zone
showing
growth
at
percent
below
the
percent
quarterly
increases
seen
in
the
past
three
quarters
hsbc
analysts
said
the
data
showed
the
euro
zone
was
experiencing
a
slowdown
not
a
slump
but
they
added
that
with
inflation
staying
weak
there
is
every
reason
for
the
ecb
to
maintain
a
dovish
stance
for
the
time
being
the
euro
was
flat
staying
just
off
