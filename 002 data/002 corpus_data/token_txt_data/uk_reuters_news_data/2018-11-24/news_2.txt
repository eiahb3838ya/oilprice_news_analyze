update 3-clashing with trump, us govt report says climate change will batter economy
reuters
climate
change
will
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
hitting
everything
from
health
to
infrastructure
according
to
a
government
report
issued
on
friday
that
the
white
house
called
inaccurate
the
congressionally
mandated
report
written
with
the
help
of
more
than
a
dozen
government
agencies
and
departments
outlined
the
projected
impact
of
global
warming
on
every
corner
of
american
society
in
a
dire
warning
that
is
at
odds
with
the
trump
administration
s
agenda
with
continued
growth
in
emissions
at
historic
rates
annual
losses
in
some
economic
sectors
are
projected
to
reach
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
more
than
the
current
gross
domestic
product
gdp
of
many
states
the
report
the
fourth
national
climate
assessment
volume
ii
said
global
warming
would
disproportionately
hurt
the
poor
broadly
undermine
human
health
damage
infrastructure
limit
the
availability
of
water
alter
coastlines
and
boost
costs
in
industries
from
farming
to
fisheries
and
energy
production
the
report
said
but
it
added
that
projections
of
further
damage
could
change
if
greenhouse
gas
emissions
are
sharply
curbed
even
though
many
of
the
impacts
of
climate
change
including
more
frequent
and
more
powerful
storms
droughts
and
flooding
are
already
under
way
future
risks
from
climate
change
depend
primarily
on
decisions
made
today
it
said
the
report
supplements
a
study
issued
last
year
that
concluded
humans
are
the
main
driver
of
global
warming
and
warned
of
catastrophic
effects
to
the
planet
the
studies
clash
with
policy
under
president
donald
trump
who
has
been
rolling
back
environmental
and
climate
protections
to
maximize
production
of
domestic
fossil
fuels
including
crude
oil
already
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
white
house
spokeswoman
lindsay
walters
said
the
new
report
was
largely
based
on
the
most
extreme
scenario
which
contradicts
trends
by
assuming
that
there
would
be
limited
technology
and
innovation
and
a
rapidly
expanding
the
government
s
next
update
of
the
national
climate
assessment
she
said
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
provide
for
a
more
transparent
and
process
that
includes
fuller
information
on
the
range
of
potential
scenarios
and
trump
last
year
announced
his
intention
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
the
paris
deal
agreed
by
nearly
nations
to
combat
climate
change
arguing
the
accord
would
hurt
the
economy
and
provide
little
tangible
environmental
benefit
trump
and
several
members
of
his
cabinet
have
also
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
the
science
of
climate
change
arguing
that
the
causes
and
impacts
are
not
yet
settled
environmental
groups
said
the
report
reinforced
their
calls
for
the
united
states
to
take
action
on
climate
change
while
president
trump
continues
to
ignore
the
threat
of
climate
change
his
own
administration
is
sounding
the
alarm
said
abigail
dillen
president
of
environmental
group
earthjustice
this
report
underscores
what
we
are
already
seeing
firsthand
climate
change
is
real
it
s
happening
here
and
it
s
happening
previous
research
including
from
government
scientists
has
also
concluded
that
climate
change
could
have
severe
economic
consequences
including
damage
to
infrastructure
water
supplies
and
agriculture
severe
weather
and
other
impacts
also
increase
the
risk
of
disease
transmission
decrease
air
quality
and
can
increase
mental
health
problems
among
other
effects
thirteen
government
departments
and
agencies
from
the
agriculture
department
to
nasa
were
part
of
the
committee
that
compiled
the
new
report
the
entire
report
