by
early
evening
on
saturday
more
than
demonstrators
were
involved
in
protests
across
france
according
to
the
ministry
the
unrest
is
a
dilemma
for
macron
who
casts
himself
as
a
champion
against
climate
change
but
has
been
derided
as
out
of
touch
with
common
folk
and
is
fighting
a
slump
in
popularity
while
the
movement
which
has
no
leader
began
as
a
backlash
against
higher
fuel
prices
it
has
tapped
into
broader
frustration
at
the
sense
of
a
squeeze
on
household
spending
power
under
macron
s
government
since
coming
to
power
macron
has
seen
off
trade
union
and
street
demonstrations
against
his
changes
to
the
labour
rules
and
overhauled
the
heavily
indebted
state
rail
operator
foreign
investors
have
largely
cheered
his
administration
