update 6-trump rails against high oil prices, opec pushes back
saudi
arabia
reuters
president
donald
trump
accused
opec
on
friday
of
artificially
boosting
oil
prices
drawing
rebukes
from
some
of
the
world
s
top
energy
exporters
looks
like
opec
is
at
it
again
with
record
amounts
of
oil
all
over
the
place
including
the
fully
loaded
ships
at
sea
oil
prices
are
artificially
very
high
no
good
and
will
not
be
accepted
trump
wrote
on
twitter
it
was
unclear
what
triggered
the
tweet
trump
s
first
mention
of
opec
on
social
media
during
his
term
oil
prices
are
near
a
high
at
close
to
a
barrel
and
have
been
rising
since
opec
and
producers
including
russia
cut
supply
in
january
to
end
a
global
oil
glut
and
price
collapse
trump
s
tweet
came
shortly
after
officials
from
top
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
said
they
would
like
to
see
prices
climb
even
higher
and
that
they
were
still
far
from
their
goal
of
ending
the
supply
glut
the
cartel
is
expected
to
restrain
supply
through
the
end
of
this
year
and
possibly
into
three
saudi
officials
told
reuters
this
week
they
would
be
happy
to
see
oil
hit
or
a
barrel
higher
prices
drive
up
gasoline
prices
for
motorists
worldwide
and
rising
energy
costs
feed
inflation
but
higher
oil
prices
have
also
benefitted
the
energy
industry
feeding
rapid
growth
in
output
from
shale
fields
oil
output
is
at
record
levels
despite
trump
s
comments
oil
benchmarks
ended
the
day
modestly
higher
rebounding
from
early
losses
several
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
responded
to
the
tweet
saying
prices
were
not
artificially
inflated
delegates
at
an
monitoring
committee
meeting
in
jeddah
saudi
arabia
said
oil
prices
were
higher
partially
because
of
global
political
tensions
mentioning
sanctions
on
venezuela
threats
to
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
strikes
on
syria
and
over
north
korea
opec
secretary
general
mohammed
barkindo
said
the
output
cut
agreement
halted
the
collapse
in
global
oil
prices
and
is
on
course
to
restore
stability
on
a
sustainable
basis
in
the
interest
of
producers
consumers
and
the
global
we
don
t
have
any
price
objective
in
opec
and
not
in
this
joint
endeavour
with
barkindo
said
on
friday
in
response
to
trump
s
tweet
the
group
is
next
slated
to
meet
in
june
to
discuss
output
policy
ministers
from
both
iraq
and
the
united
arab
emirates
also
disagreed
with
trump
on
friday
with
iraqi
oil
minister
jabar
saying
prices
are
not
very
high
and
that
the
market
is
stabilizing
trump
gave
no
details
on
what
action
his
administration
might
take
regarding
oil
or
opec
and
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
elaborate
on
the
issue
on
the
record
we
have
a
difficult
time
seeing
how
opec
would
in
any
way
be
swayed
here
in
terms
of
changing
course
in
terms
of
policy
said
michael
tran
commodity
strategist
at
rbc
opec
s
output
fell
in
march
to
an
low
according
to
a
reuters
survey
the
cartel
has
targeted
the
average
of
inventories
in
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
oecd
countries
as
a
barometer
for
the
deal
s
success
as
of
those
inventories
were
billion
barrels
or
million
more
than
the
average
a
year
ago
it
was
million
barrels
above
that
benchmark
this
week
crude
futures
benchmarks
brent
and
west
texas
intermediate
wti
hit
their
highest
since
november
with
brent
touching
and
crude
per
barrel
that
has
raised
fuel
costs
with
average
prices
for
gasoline
hitting
a
gallon
on
wednesday
according
to
motorist
advocacy
group
aaa
up
more
than
cents
from
a
year
earlier
and
at
their
highest
since
july
trump
is
just
trying
to
relate
to
his
base
when
it
comes
to
the
retail
gasoline
prices
so
he
s
blaming
opec
for
this
said
josh
graves
senior
market
strategist
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
beyond
opec
s
supply
management
crude
prices
have
been
supported
by
expectations
that
washington
will
sanctions
on
iran
and
might
expand
sanctions
against
venezuela
after
that
country
s
presidential
election
next
month
if
one
concern
about
reinstating
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
is
the
impact
that
it
could
have
on
oil
prices
then
it
could
be
a
preemptive
measure
to
blame
opec
instead
said
antoine
halff
senior
research
scholar
at
the
center
on
global
energy
policy
at
columbia
university
hedge
funds
and
other
speculators
hold
a
record
level
of
bullish
bets
on
brent
on
expectations
of
further
price
rises
the
government
can
not
legally
influence
oil
prices
other
than
through
releasing
oil
from
its
strategic
reserve
which
it
does
occasionally
this
year
s
budget
agreement
includes
the
sale
of
about
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
about
percent
of
the
reserve
as
oil
production
recently
hit
a
record
at
more
than
million
barrels
a
day
that
release
is
not
related
to
high
oil
prices
and
analysts
said
it
signalled
washington
was
not
concerned
about
the
potential
for
future
global
shortages
washington
has
fully
given
up
this
idea
of
scarcity
you
don
t
get
to
the
point
of
selling
your
strategic
reserves
to
balance
your
budget
if
you
think
the
world
is
short
