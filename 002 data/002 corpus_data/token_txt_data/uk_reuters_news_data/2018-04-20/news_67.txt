asian
oil
demand
will
hit
a
record
in
april
just
as
global
crude
values
are
lifted
to
levels
not
seen
in
three
years
by
middle
east
supply
risks
and
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
withholding
output
and
noisily
pushing
for
prices
at
to
per
barrel
most
analysts
have
pointed
to
escalating
middle
east
conflicts
a
crisis
in
venezuela
and
the
supply
cuts
of
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
as
the
main
drivers
taking

west
texas
intermediate

futures
this
week
to
their
highest
since
late
at
almost

a

respectively
yet
a
much
more
fundamental
reason
has
also
sparked
oil

bull

asian
demand

goldman
sachs
said
this

points

an

of

in
rising
tensions
in
the
middle
east
have
likely
played
a
role
in
oil
price
strength
but
we
believe
a
tight
physical
market
is
the
key

its

that
s
nearly
percent

more

it

the

comes
despite

which
usually
dents

aspects
said
chinese
buyers
were
after
running
down
inventories
late
last
year
much
of
china
s
new
demand
also
comes
from
the
advent
of
refiners
often
called
teapots
as
crude
importers
resulting
in

a

of
teapots
are
starting
new

pulling

there
may
also
be
some

global
