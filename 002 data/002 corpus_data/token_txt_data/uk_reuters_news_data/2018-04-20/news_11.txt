with
oil
prices
hitting
per
barrel
it
was
meant
to
be
one
of
the
smoothest
meetings
opec
has
had
in
recent
years
the
night
before
the
meeting
the
ministers
gathered
in
jeddah
celebrated
with
a
traditional
saudi
sword
dance
just
as
president
donald
trump
had
done
when
he
visited
saudi
arabia
last
may
little
did
they
know
that
trump
was
about
to
spoil
their
party
when
he
tweeted
that
oil
prices
had
rallied
too
far
looks
like
opec
is
at
it
again
with
record
amounts
of
oil
all
over
the
place
including
the
fully
loaded
ships
at
sea
oil
prices
are
artificially
very
high
no
good
and
will
not
be
accepted
trump
said
on
twitter
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
in
the
midst
of
an
oil
deal
with
producers
like
russia
that
has
helped
erase
a
global
glut
and
boosted
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
oil
prices
fell
on
trump
s
tweet
as
market
analysts
tried
to
interpret
what
it
could
mean
for
policies
ministers
and
delegates
were
having
lunch
at
the
time
to
celebrate
opec
secretary
general
mohammad
barkindo
s
birthday
when
delegates
were
alerted
to
trump
s
tweet
we
in
opec
pride
ourselves
as
friends
of
the
united
states
barkindo
told
reporters
when
emerging
from
the
lunch
and
asked
for
his
response
to
the
tweet
an
opec
source
said
delegates
were
confused
by
trump
s
stance
higher
oil
prices
helped
the
oil
industry
and
the
americans
themselves
the
oil
industry
would
have
collapsed
if
it
wasn
t
for
this
opec
deal
uae
s
energy
minister
suhail
mohamed
said
prices
were
not
artificially
high
asked
whether
he
thought
it
was
fair
that
the
president
was
getting
involved
in
opec
matters
he
said
jokingly
since
when
is
it
about
fairness
trump
a
regular
twitter
user
has
never
tweeted
about
opec
before
although
he
has
regularly
attacked
cartels
that
control
prices
the
united
states
is
on
course
to
become
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
but
it
has
never
participated
in
opec
meetings
due
to
tough
legislation
reuters
reported
this
week
that
saudi
arabia
would
be
happy
to
see
crude
rise
even
higher
to
or
even
a
barrel
a
sign
riyadh
will
seek
no
changes
to
the
deal
at
a
june
meeting
to
set
policy
ole
hansen
of
saxo
bank
said
oil
had
risen
to
current
levels
in
part
because
of
the
risk
trump
might
pull
the
out
of
an
iranian
nuclear
deal
thus
curbing
iranian
oil
exports
rapidan
energy
thinktank
said
trump
s
tweet
would
initially
push
russia
and
saudi
arabia
closer
together
and
assist
riyadh
s
attempts
to
prolong
oil
supply
cuts
but
the
intensifying
clash
will
impact
relations
iran
sanctions
discussions
on
civilian
nuclear
cooperation
and
a
host
of
other
issues
