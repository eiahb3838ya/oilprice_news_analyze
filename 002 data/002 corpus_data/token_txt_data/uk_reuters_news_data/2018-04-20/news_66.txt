chinese
private
chemical
producer
hengli
group
has
won
state
approval
to
import
barrels
per
day
bpd
crude
oil
the
largest
quota
ever
for
a
private
refiner
as
it
challenges
the
country
s
smaller
independent
plants
in
an
oversupplied
chinese
fuel
market
the
group
s
listed
unit
hengli
petrochemical
said
in
an
exchange
filing
late
on
thursday
that
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
ndrc
the
state
economic
planner
had
approved
the
quota
the
firm
aims
to
start
trial
runs
in
october
at
a
newly
built
refinery
in
the
northeastern
port
city
of
dalian
that
will
be
among
the
five
biggest
refineries
in
china
we
will
start
using
our
quota
this
year
said
a
senior
hengli
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
we
hope
to
get
enough
allowances
for
the
refinery
to
start
trial
operations
in
another
private
chemical
firm
zhejiang
ronsheng
group
is
also
expected
to
start
operating
a
new
refinery
in
the
eastern
city
of
zhoushan
later
this
year
the
additional
production
capacity
in
china
is
likely
to
add
to
pressure
on
the
country
s
small
independent
or
teapot
refineries
which
are
vulnerable
to
increased
competition
because
of
their
modest
output
many
teapot
refineries
produce
less
than
bpd
hengli
s
scale
sophisticated
refinery
configuration
that
favors
petrochemicals
and
its
location
means
it
will
be
a
killer
competitor
to
teapots
said
harry
liu
of
consultancy
ihs
markit
with
the
government
stepping
up
scrutiny
over
their
tax
and
environmental
practices
liu
predicted
some
of
the
smaller
of
the
independents
close
in
the
next
two
years
as
a
result
of
the
competition
hengli
started
as
a
small
chemical
fiber
maker
and
operates
a
million
tonnes
per
year
plant
making
purified
terephthalic
acid
pta
the
world
s
largest
pta
is
a
feedstock
for
producing
polyester
although
the
ndrc
grants
approval
for
quotas
the
commerce
ministry
determines
how
much
of
a
quota
can
be
put
to
use
for
next
year
we
are
confident
of
getting
million
tonnes
of
allowances
from
the
government
the
senior
hengli
official
said
he
said
the
refinery
s
two
crude
distillation
units
cdu
are
designed
to
process
percent
of
saudi
arabia
s
arab
medium
crude
percent
of
saudi
heavy
and
percent
qatar
marine
crude
the
company
has
recently
applied
for
a
quota
to
export
fuel
oil
the
senior
hengli
official
and
another
company
official
said
hengli
would
market
its
refined
fuel
to
sinopec
and
petrochina
as
well
as
independent
wholesalers
and
distributors
there
is
no
plan
to
build
its
own
retailing
network
because
of
the
cost
in
january
hengli
signed
a
framework
deal
with
sinochem
group
to
cooperate
on
imports
of
crude
oil
and
the
marketing
of
refined
fuel
