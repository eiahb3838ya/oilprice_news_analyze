formerly

in
the
hope

will
mark
a
turning
point
for
energy

which
have
failed
to
keep
pace
with
a

the

been
taxing

baffling
we

even
though

improved
quite
dramatically
i
struggle
to
answer
the
question
why
they

been
so
poor
until
the
last

the

many

remaining
skeptical
cash

growing
rapidly
dividends
are
very
good
and
you
re
starting
to
get
some
buybacks
he
said
the
fact
higher

have
not
yet
trickled
down
into

leaves
a
lot
of
room
for

senior

that
we

seen
the

of

better
he
said
the
damage
of
the

taken

ample
alternatives
available
