focus-germany's merck seeks partners for cancer and immune system drugs
frankfurt
reuters
merck
kgaa
will
seek
development
partners
for
experimental
treatments
including
tepotinib
as
the
german
company
looks
to
licensing
deals
to
help
fund
clinical
trials
according
to
its
head
of
drug
r
d
merck
has
a
promising
drug
pipeline
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
it
is
looking
to
take
a
collaborative
approach
as
an
expected
decline
in
operating
profit
this
year
forces
it
to
find
new
ways
to
finance
pharmaceutical
development
luciano
rossetti
its
drug
research
and
development
chief
told
reuters
the
company
was
engaged
in
very
intense
ongoing
conversations
over
deals
to
help
fund
trials
of
drugs
in
its
pipeline
he
said
merck
was
looking
to
strike
agreements
for
treatments
including
oral
lung
cancer
drug
tepotinib
as
well
as
a
bifunctional
fusion
protein
at
an
earlier
stage
of
development
which
aims
to
assist
the
immune
system
in
fighting
cancer
cells
merck
did
not
disclose
the
names
of
potential
partners
rossetti
said
the
company
was
preparing
to
present
initial
phase
trial
data
for
tepotinib
at
the
american
society
of
clinical
oncology
asco
in
chicago
in
june
which
he
expected
would
show
the
drug
blocks
a
genetic
mutation
that
drives
tumor
growth
in
certain
lung
cancer
cases
what
we
expect
from
this
approach
is
to
have
a
high
response
rate
in
this
patient
population
said
rossetti
adding
that
asco
had
the
final
word
over
whether
the
findings
could
be
presented
at
the
conference
bernstein
analysts
said
in
a
march
note
that
tepotinib
was
the
one
to
watch
among
merck
s
early
and
pipeline
drugs
and
predicted
sales
of
million
euros
million
licence
partnership
agreements
which
typically
see
a
drugmaker
share
the
cost
of
trials
with
another
pharma
or
biotech
firm
in
return
for
a
share
of
future
sales
offer
merck
a
way
to
drive
through
a
promising
drug
pipeline
in
as
many
disease
types
as
possible
however
such
deals
are
while
they
curb
risk
they
also
curb
earnings
merck
a
diversified
company
that
also
has
chemicals
and
lab
equipment
divisions
does
not
have
the
financial
firepower
in
pharmaceuticals
of
the
sector
s
biggest
players
including
roche
pfizer
novartis
and
sanofi
this
could
prevent
it
challenging
larger
rivals
in
acquiring
assets
in
a
consolidating
global
market
analysts
say
pharma
majors
often
buy
certain
rights
to
experimental
drugs
from
rivals
or
smaller
biotech
firms
to
bolster
their
pipeline
selling
rights
outlicensing
is
also
common
but
is
mainly
driven
by
a
desire
to
win
partners
in
unfamiliar
markets
rather
than
financial
constraints
merck
s
bifunctional
fusion
protein
which
combines
its
approved
cancer
drug
bavencio
s
immunotherapy
mechanism
with
a
second
immune
trigger
is
in
phase
trials
drugs
typically
go
through
three
phases
of
testing
before
a
market
launch
but
in
cancer
can
be
cut
short
to
two
when
regulators
see
sufficient
promise
merck
which
started
out
years
ago
as
an
apothecary
shop
in
the
german
city
of
darmstadt
sells
products
ranging
from
pearlescent
pigments
to
dimmable
window
panes
healthcare
pharmaceuticals
allergy
treatments
and
consumer
health
accounted
for
percent
of
its
billion
euros
of
sales
last
year
merck
struck
a
deal
this
week
to
sell
the
consumer
health
unit
to
procter
gamble
co
for
billion
euros
but
the
company
said
this
would
not
affect
its
plans
to
seek
partners
to
help
develop
its
pharma
pipeline
the
group
is
in
a
bind
just
as
it
turned
around
its
drug
pipeline
with
promising
candidates
against
arthritis
and
cancer
its
finances
have
been
squeezed
by
chinese
competition
for
its
biggest
cash
generator
liquid
crystals
for
tv
screens
this
means
it
is
lacking
the
money
to
take
the
drug
candidates
forward
under
its
own
steam
its
shares
have
fallen
percent
over
the
past
year
compared
with
an
percent
decline
in
the
european
pharma
index
and
a
percent
gain
in
the
european
chemicals
index
considering
that
merck
had
next
to
no
pipeline
five
years
ago
they
ve
built
up
something
quite
solid
said
markus
manns
portfolio
manager
at
union
investment
which
holds
shares
in
the
german
company
as
an
investor
i
wouldn
t
want
to
take
an
earnings
hit
if
merck
were
to
decide
to
go
it
alone
in
pharmaceuticals
he
added
many
pharma
and
biotech
players
were
eager
to
grab
a
slice
of
other
companies
promising
new
treatments
putting
merck
in
a
very
comfortable
position
merck
when
it
flagged
its
collaborative
approach
to
drug
development
last
month
had
highlighted
evobrutinib
a
btk
inhibitor
designed
to
block
white
blood
cells
from
launching
an
immune
response
at
healthy
cells
it
is
in
the
second
phase
of
testing
the
drug
s
potentially
broad
use
in
the
autoimmune
market
including
rheumatoid
arthritis
multiple
sclerosis
and
lupus
would
attract
prospective
partners
such
as
abbvie
and
roche
said
manns
bernstein
has
identified
merck
s
stock
as
a
bargain
due
to
low
market
expectations
merck
kgaa
s
pipeline
is
often
overlooked
by
investors
rightly
so
given
the
lack
of
visibility
and
poor
track
record
said
analyst
wimal
kapadia
given
most
investors
expect
failure
