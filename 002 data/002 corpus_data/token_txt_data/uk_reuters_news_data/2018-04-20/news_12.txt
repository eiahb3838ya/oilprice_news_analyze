the
dense
smog
of

and
the
haze
of
beijing
cloud
the
sky
as
visitors
sniff
the
air
during
a
unique
exhibition
in
london
aimed
at
raising
awareness
of
pollution
the
new
art
installation
allows
people
to
experience
different
pollution
levels
using
five
domes
that
replicate
the
environments
of
the
indian
chinese
and
british
capitals
brazil
s
sao
paulo
and

s
tautra
peninsula
british
artist
michael
pinsky
whose
work
often
focuses
on
environmental
issues
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
he
wanted
to
make
people
stop
and
think
about
how
their
everyday
actions
impact
the
atmosphere
the
idea
of
polar
bears
on
a
melting
glacier
wasn
t
something
that
makes
people
change
their
lifestyles
it
s
the
things
that
affect
them
every
day
pinsky
said
in
an
interview
at
london
s
somerset
house
where
the
pollution
pods
are
on
display
for
london
we
ve
just
focused
entirely
on
diesel
emissions
because
that
s
the
primary
cause
of
pollution
it
exceeds
any
other
form
of
the
pods
are
climatically
controlled
and
expose
visitors
to
moderate
levels
of
the
different
toxins
from
nitrogen
dioxide
in
london
to
ethanol
in
sao
paulo
the
tautra
dome
contains
the
cleanest
air
you
re
seeing
a
comparison
between
different
cities
and
you
can
feel
it
and
see
it
as
you
move
from
dome
to
dome
i
think
it
s
a
really
powerful
way
of
bringing
this
issue
to
people
s
minds
said
south
african
visitor
gillian
benjamin
pinsky
said
the
worst
air
quality
was
in
the
delhi
pod
reflecting
the
conditions
of
the
indian
capital
if
exposed
to
levels
recreated
in
the
artwork
residents
in
new
delhi
would
shorten
their
lifespans
by
four
years
while
those
living
in
london
would
lose
up
to
months
of
their
lives
he
said
according
to
the
world
health
organization
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
population
live
in
places
where
air
pollution
levels
exceed
its
safe
limits
nearly
residents
of
london
die
prematurely
every
year
as
a
result
of
exposure
to
air
pollution
a
study
by
researchers
at
king
s
college
london
showed
delhi
s
state
government
has
adopted
measures
in
recent
years
including
limiting
car
use

temporarily
closing
power
plants

the
