an
australian
inquiry
into
financial
sector
misconduct
claimed
its
first
scalp

stepped
down
over
revelations
of
deception
and
misappropriation
of
funds
the
departure
of
amp
ltd
s
craig
meller
came
as
the
government
vowed
to
double
prison
terms
for
financial
crimes
dramatically
increase
penalties
and
ramp
up
the
investigative
powers
of
the
corporate
regulator
following
shocking
admissions
of
misconduct
to
the
royal
commission
inquiry
not
only
has
the
start
of
the
inquiry
been
a
publicity
disaster
for
australia
s
major
lenders
it
has
also
put
the
conservative
government
which
had
initially
opposed
a
commission
despite
years
of
scandals
including
and
alleged
in
a
tight
spot
faced
with
daily
revelations
of
wrongdoing
at
the
highest
levels
of
corporate
australia
the
government
is
now
under
mounting
pressure
to
extend
the
inquiry
beyond
its
february
deadline
meaning
it
would
run
concurrently
with
the
next
federal
election
treasurer
scott
morrison
who
once
dismissed
opposition
calls
for
a
royal
commission
as
crass
populism
on
friday
said
the
government
would
raise
criminal
penalties
for
corporate
crimes
to
a
maximum
of
years
in
jail
from
years
currently
offending
companies
would
face
fines

commission
asic
would
get
the
power
to
intercept
internal
communications
of
companies
if
necessary
morrison
said
they
are
not
victimless
crimes
morrison
told
a
press
conference
we
need
to
set
the
tone
so
people
understand
that
misleading
regulators
about
serious
issues
such
as
this
is
no
victimless
offence
and
it
won
t
carry
a
victimless
the
changes
were
the
result
of
years
of
planning
and
were
not
a
reaction
to
the
inquiry
he
said
amp
executives
admitted
in
testimony
this
week
that
the
company
had
lied
to
the
corporate
watchdog
for
almost
a
decade
to
cover
a
practice
of
charging
customers
for
services
it
did
not
provide
chairman
catherine
brenner
issued
an
unreserved
apology
for
misconduct
and
failures
in
regulatory
disclosures
in
our

as
she
announced
meller
s
exit
along
with
a
review
of
the
company
s
governance
government
data
prepared
for
the
royal
commission
which
has
the
power
to
subpoena
documents
and
compel
top
executives
to
testify
in
public
shows
more
than
consumers
have
been
given
bad
advice
by
financial
institutions
over
the
past
decade
costing
them
a
total
a
billion
billion
this
week
s
hearings
have
been
particularly
brutal
a
nurse
gave
tearful
testimony
on
thursday
about
losing
her
home
after
taking
advice
from
westpac
banking
corp
while
lawyers
presented
evidence
that
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
the
country
s
biggest
bank
knowingly
charged
dead
clients
for
counsel
for
years
but
the
revelations
about
amp
for
the
first
time
showed
direct
involvement
in
hiding
misconduct
from
asic
leading
to
calls
for
the
watchdog
to
play
a
far
more
aggressive
role
than
it
has
in
the
past
the
australian
shareholders
association
said
meller
s
resignation
was
not
sufficient
and
called
for
brenner
to
explain
the
board
s
involvement
in
the
case
or
step
down
the
asa
wants
to
ask
catherine
brenner
about
the
reported
interference
with
the
production
of
the
independent
report
it
said
in
a
statement
if
this
is
not
able
to
be
provided
her
position
as
chair
is
untenable
and
she
should
resign
said
the
asa
the
asa
is
having
further
discussions
with
the
company
to
assess
how
rigorous
these
directors
are
in
dealing
with
the
ongoing
issues
it
added
the
association
represented
about
shareholders
at
the
last
amp
annual
general
meeting
the
asa
website
shows
amp
shares
have
lost
over
a
billion
in
market
value
since
the
revelations
came
to
light
on
tuesday
the
stock
ended
down
percent
on
friday
in
a
weak
overall
market
meller
said
he
was
personally
devastated
by
the
issues
which
have
been
raised
publicly
this
week
and
while
he
did
not
condone
making
misleading
statements
to
the
regulator
they
had
occurred
under
his
watch
so
his
resignation
was
appropriate
this
is
not
the
amp
i
know
and
these
are
not
the
actions
our
customers
should
expect
from
the
amp
director
mike
wilkins
a
former

of

insurer
insurance

will
step
