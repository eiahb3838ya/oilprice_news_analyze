it
expects

book

much
as

the

has
been
investigating
the
activities

since
ge
said
settlement
discussions
with
the
doj
in
march
and
analysis
of
other
banks
reserves
prompted
it
to
take
the
charge
but
it
sees
limited
impact
to

we
do
not
expect
this
to
change

tusa
said
negative
free

weaker
than
he
expected

and
some
thought
