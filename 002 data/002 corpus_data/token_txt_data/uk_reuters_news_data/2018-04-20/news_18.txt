euro
zone
bond
yields
hit
fresh
highs
on
friday
and
are
now
well
above
their
levels
at
the
start
of
the
week
after
a
sharp
prompted
by
brent
crude
prices
hitting
their
highest
in
more
than
three
years
at
a
barrel
on
thursday
this
prompted
a
tweet
from
president
donald
trump
in
which
he
said
oil
prices
were
articifially
very
high
and
will
not
be
accepted
higher
oil
prices
tend
to
push
up
inflation
which
strengthens
the
case
for
tighter
monetary
policy
and
higher
interest
rates
the
yield
on
germany
s
government
bond
the
benchmark
for
the
region
hit
a
high
of
percent
and
is
about
basis
points
bps
higher
this
week
having
fallen
in
seven
of
the
past
weeks
french
and
dutch
equivalents
were
also
set
for
their
biggest
weekly
rises
in
weeks
the
market
is
hoping
that
higher
oil
prices
will
lead
to
higher
inflation
in
a
sustainable
manner
said
dz
bank
strategist
sebastian
fellechner
but
this
is
hard
to
say
because
oil
prices
are
only
one
factor
we
need
confirmation
we
need
to
see
other
factors
kick
in
such
as
wage
still
a

gauge
of
euro

inflation
expectations
the
forward
swap
was
close
to
its
highest
level
since
hit
on
thursday
at
percent
the
in
bonds
this
week
comes
after
a
long
stretch
in
which
euro
zone
yields
were
kept
compressed
by
factors
including
the
possibility
of
a
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
world
economies
china
in
particular
as
policy
meetings
get
under
way
this
is
likely
to
be
a
major
topic
for
discussion
ahead
of
next
week

european
central
bank
meeting
commerzbank
analysts
said
in
a
note
japan
has
warned
its
counterparts
that
protectionism
and
exchange
of
retaliatory
measures
will
disrupt
financial
markets
and
heighten
volatility
in
a
speech
on
friday
ecb
president
mario
draghi
said
the
euro
zone
economy
needs
strong
global
growth
and
open
trade
if
it
is
to
continue
to
prosper
large
redemptions
this
month
have
also
played
a
role
in
keeping
yields
lower
and
this
is
set
to
continue
next
week
with
french
coupon
and
redemptions
alone
worth
billion
euros
the
commerzbank
analysts
said
also
on
friday
british
borrowing
costs
dropped
after
bank

governor
mark
carney
