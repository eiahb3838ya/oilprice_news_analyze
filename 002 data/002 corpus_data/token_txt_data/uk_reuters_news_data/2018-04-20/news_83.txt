the
world
s
airlines
are
backing
the
development
of
a
united
global
registry
for
drones
as
a
rise
in
near
collisions
by
unmanned
aircraft
and
commercial
jets
fuels
safety
concerns
an
executive
of
their
trade
group
said
on
tuesday
the
international
air
transport
association
backs
efforts
by
the
united
nations
aviation
agency
to
develop
such
a
registry
which
could
also
help
track
the
number
of
incidents
involving
drones
and
jets

iata
s
director
of
air
traffic
management
infrastructure
iata
would
consider
collaborating
with
the
international
civil
aviation
organization
icao
to
use
the
registry
for
data
analysis
to
improve
safety
icao
is
developing
the
registry
as
part
of
broader
efforts
to
come
up
with
common
rules
for
flying
and
tracking
unmanned
aircraft
one
of
the
important
things
we
would
like
to
see
on
a
registry
as
well
is
the
compilation
of
data
which
would
include
incident
and
accident
reporting
eagles
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
iata
s
safety
and
flight
ops
conference
in
montreal
airlines
and
airport
operators
are
looking
to
drone
registries
technology
and
stiffer
penalties
for
operating
drones
near
airports
they
hope
these
steps
will
ensure
flying
remains
safe
as
hobbyists
and
companies
like
inc
use
more
drones
in
britain
the
number
of
near
misses
between
drones
and
aircraft
more
than
tripled
between
and
with
incidents
recorded
last
year
according
to
the
airprox
board
air
new
zealand
ltd
said
last
month
a
flight
from
tokyo
with
passengers
and
crew
on
board
encountered
a
drone
estimated
to
be
just
five
meters
away
from
the
boeing
jet
during
its
descent
into
auckland
a
single
registry
would
create
a
that
would
allow
law
enforcement
to
remotely
identify
and
track
unmanned
aircraft
along
with
their
operator
and
owner
the
intention
at
present
is
to
merge
this
activity
into
the
icao
registry
for
manned
aircraft
so
that
the
sector
has
a
single
consolidated
registry
network
said
icao
spokesman
anthony
philbin
by
email
barbara
dalibard
head
of
aviation
technology
group
sita
said
her
company
wanted
to
build
a
global
drone
registry
and
had
been
working
with
geneva
airport
on
tests
of
a
zone
around
the
airport
where
drones
listed
in
the
registry
would
not
be
able
to
fly
the
data
is
connected
to
the
airport
system
she
said
during
an
interview
in
singapore
on
tuesday
the
drone
is
approaching
the
airport
and
it
says
no
go
back
if
everything
is
connected
you
can
ask
the
drone
to
change
its
flight
plan
or
to
readjust
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
danger
zone
she
added
sita
also
has
a
joint
venture
with
the
irish
government
called
aviareto
which
operates
a
registry
that
tracks
financial
interests
in
certain
aircraft
