moscow
april
reuters
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
said
on
friday
it
has
lodged
a
claim
to
an
international
arbitration
seeking
to
cancel
its
supply
and
transit
contracts
with
ukraine
it
said
talks
with
kiev
over
the
contracts
had
ended
without
concrete
results
and
it
had
lodged
a
claim
to
a
stockholm
arbitration
court
the
contracts
are
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
last
month
gazprom
appealed
against
a
previous
stockholm
arbitration
ruling
which
obliged
the
company
to
pay
ukraine
s
naftogaz
billion
following
a
long
dispute
between
the
companies
over
gas
delivery
ukraine
is
a
major
transit
country
for
russian
gas
supplies
to
europe
where
gazprom
accounts
for
around
percent
of
the
gas
market
gazprom
said
last
month
it
would
terminate
its
gas
contracts
with
ukraine
after
it
lost
the
court
case
escalating
a
dispute
which
had
left
ukraine
struggling
to
stay
warm
and
which
the
european
union
said
could
threaten
gas
flows
to
europe
ukraine
has
not
bought
gas
from
russia
since
november
due
to
a
broader
political
conflict
between
the
two
countries
following
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
in
and
support
for
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
