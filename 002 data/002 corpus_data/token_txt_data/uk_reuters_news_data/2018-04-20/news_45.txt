europe
s
largest
bank
hsbc
said
on
friday
it
would
mostly
stop
funding
new
coal
power
plants
oil
sands
and
arctic
drilling
becoming
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
investors
to
shun
the
fossil
fuels
other
large
banks
such
as
ing
and
bnp
paribas
have
made
similar
pledges
in
recent
months
as
investors
have
mounted
pressure
to
make
sure
bank
s
actions
align
with
the
paris
agreement
a
global
pact
to
limit
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
curb
rising
temperatures
we
recognise
the
need
to
reduce
emissions
rapidly
to
achieve
the
target
set
in
the
paris
agreement
and
our
responsibility
to
support
the
communities
in
which
we
operate

said
in
a
statement
hsbc
said
it
would
make
an
exception
for
power
plants
in
bangladesh
indonesia
and
vietnam
there
s
a
very
significant
number
of
people
in
those
three
countries
who
have
no
access
to
any
electricity
hsbc
ceo
john
flint
told
hsbc
shareholders
at
the
bank
s
annual
general
meeting
in
london
on
friday
the
reasonable
position
for
us
is
to
allow
a
short
window
for
us
to
continue
to
get
involved
in
financing
coal
there
if
we
think
there
is
not
a
reasonable
alternative
he
said
aside
from
the
coal
exemptions
environmental
campaigners
greenpeace
welcomed
the
move
and
said
hsbc
s
new
energy
strategy
would
prevent
it
from
providing
project
finance
for
transcanada
corp
s
proposed
billion
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
to
nebraska
this
latest
vote
of
from
a
major
financial
institution
shows
that
tar
sands
are
becoming
an
increasingly
toxic
business
proposition
