lithuania
wants
the
united
states
to
bring
more
defence
systems
such
as
patriot
and
avenger
missiles
to
the
baltics
where
some
fear
russia
is
more
powerful
in
the
air
the
country
has
asked
washington
to
install
the
systems
more
regularly
for
exercises
arguing
nato
needs
to
know
the
region
well
in
case
of
conflict
defence
minister
raimundas
karoblis
told
reuters
yes
of
course
we
are
asking
he
told
reuters
on
thursday
we
are
talking
not
only
about
the
patriots
but
also
other
capabilities
such
as
avengers
and
other
systems
to
create
a
regional
architecture
of
air
defence
because
we
are
not
able
to
do
that
lithuania
latvia
and
estonia
once
ruled
from
moscow
but
now
part
of
nato
and
the
european
union
need
western
help
despite
growing
defence
budgets
due
to
their
small
economies
poland
was
equally
alarmed
by
moscow
s
seizure
of
crimea
in
and
is
spending
more
than
billion
on
buying
patriot
missiles
from
raytheon
co
after
a
deal
in
march
patriot
missile
defence
interceptors
are
designed
to
detect
track
and
engage
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
uavs
cruise
missiles
and
or
tactical
ballistic
missiles
but
the
small
baltic
countries
can
not
afford
costly
military
jets
or
advanced
air
defences
making
them
reliant
on
the
united
states
and
nato
to
fill
the
gap
from
kaliningrad
a
russian
exclave
on
the
baltic
sea
any
aircraft
or
missiles
could
reach
most
of
poland
lithuania
latvia
and
estonia
karoblis
did
not
expect
nato
to
increase
defences
in
the
baltics
immediately
but
he
expects
the
alliance
to
show
greater
commitment
at
a
nato
leaders
summit
in
july
to
deterring
any
threat
in
the
baltics
one
difficulty
is
that
other
nato
members
face
defence
gaps
after
years
of
better
ties
with
russia
following
the
end
of
the
cold
war
that
made
such
defences
unnecessary
we
would
like
to
have
the
permanent
deployment
of
ground
missile
systems
and
other
capabilities
but
we
understand
that
a
quite
significant
part
of
these
capabilities
were
lost
by
nato
after
the
cold
war
and
it
s
difficult
to
rebuild
them
fast
he
said
we
need
to
ensure
that
air
defences
could
be
deployed
in
the
baltics
at
any
time
nato
began
improving
the
region
s
defences
after
russia
s
crimea
annexation
including
putting
four
multinational
battalions
of
about
troops
to
rotate
in
each
baltic
state
and
poland
but
the
alliance
has
shied
away
from
deploying
permanent
military
capabilities
partly
to
avoid
escalating
tension
with
russia
the
kremlin
says
nato
not
moscow
is
the
risk
to
peace
in
europe
the
security
situation
in
the
baltics
is
not
improving
said
karoblis
sitting
in
his
ministry
next
to
a
painting
depicting
a
lithuanian
cavalry
battle
with
russian
bolsheviks
almost
a
hundred
years
ago
one
of
the
places
where
nato
unity
could
be
tested
is
the
baltic
countries
this
is
at
least
a
theoretic
possibility
