goldman
sachs
said
it
expects
global
oil
demand
growth
to
remain
strong
this
year
and
contribute
to
further
declines
in
oil
inventories
we
believe
that
the
combination
of
strong
developed
markets
momentum
and
accelerating
emerging
markets
growth
will
combine
to
keep
oil
demand
growth
above
consensus
expectations
with
our
year
on
year
forecast
at
million
barrels
per
day
goldman
said
in
a
note
dated
thursday
global
oil
demand
in
has
come
in
line
with
its
optimistic
expectations
with
the
first
quarter
likely
to
post
the
strongest
year
on
year
growth
since
fourth
quarter
at
the
bank
said
while
global
oil
data
for
supports
our
constructive
demand
outlook
for
the
year
we
expect
march
data
will
show
weaker
demand
growth
given
transient
seasonal
distortions
and
unusually
cold
temperatures
could
have
resulted
in
softer
march
data
the
bank
said
adding
that
was
likely
just
a
transient
weakness
as
strong
refinery
margins
supported
its
view
of
robust
demand
in
april
goldman
however
said
volatile
chinese
data
slowdown
in
global
demand
growth
in
march
ongoing
trade
tensions
and
fears
that
higher
oil
prices
will
start
to
weigh
on
demand
growth
have
led
to
increased
concern
about
the
sustainability
of
demand
