interview-sulphur scrubbers "no silver bullet" for shipping industry -wartsila
london
reuters
shipping
industry
hopes
that
sulphur
scrubbers
are
a
solution
to
compliance
with
drastic
emissions
reduction
demanded
by
are
somewhat
misguided
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
manufacturers
of
the
equipment
told
reuters
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
cut
to
the
amount
of
sulphur
the
world
fleet
can
emit
will
have
massive
implications
for
shippers
oil
refiners
and
even
crude
oil
producers
scrubbers
that
strip
sulphur
as
fuels
are
burned
allows
ships
to
continue
using
fuel
oil
and
finland
s
wartsila
marine
solutions
is
taking
in
record
orders
as
the
deadline
draws
nearer
however
sigurd
jenssen
the
company
s
director
of
exhaust
gas
cleaning
said
that
while
the
equipment
has
a
major
part
to
play
there
is
no
silver
bullet
to
ensure
the
deadline
is
met
you
can
t
equip
ships
in
one
year
he
said
wartsila
installed
scrubbers
last
year
accounting
for
about
a
third
of
the
market
and
jenssen
said
that
fitting
ships
with
scrubbers
by
is
doable
but
with
a
global
fleet
of
about
vessels
travelling
international
routes
according
to
brokers
alphatanker
a
large
number
will
have
to
turn
to
cleaner
fuels
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
that
there
has
not
been
enough
investment
in
scrubbers
and
it
is
worried
about
the
market
s
ability
to
meet
demand
for
the
marine
fuel
that
will
be
needed
by
ships
without
scrubbers
the
imo
rules
cut
the
maximum
amount
of
sulphur
emissions
to
percent
from
percent
meaning
that
ships
without
scrubbers
have
to
burn
fuels
such
as
marine
gasoil
or
fuel
oil
experts
say
this
will
cut
fuel
oil
demand
by
anywhere
from
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
million
bpd
jenssen
said
that
percent
of
ships
in
korea
a
major
hub
were
fitted
with
scrubbers
last
year
and
that
the
market
to
retrofit
existing
vessels
is
picking
up
quite
rapidly
but
at
a
cost
of
between
million
euros
and
million
euros
pounds
to
million
pounds
for
the
equipment
alone
jenssen
said
some
ship
owners
are
holding
back
a
lot
of
smaller
players
with
balance
sheets
want
to
wait
to
see
how
the
fuel
market
is
moving
as
well
he
said
fitting
a
scrubber
can
take
as
little
as
days
but
a
bespoke
engineering
plan
is
also
required
and
the
entire
process
can
take
up
to
a
year
the
lead
time
on
the
equipment
is
somewhere
between
months
but
before
you
get
to
the
point
of
ordering
there
s
some
investigations
and
work
to
be
done
that
can
easily
take
a
couple
more
months
jenssen
said
as
demand
increases
that
time
frame
could
get
longer
