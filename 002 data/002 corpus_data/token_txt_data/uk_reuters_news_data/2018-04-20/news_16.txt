the
rainy
season
water
used
to
pour
into
dativa
nyiramajyambere
s
house
on
a
cheap
plot
of
land
in
the
kigali
suburb
of
rugenge
outside
her
home
a
hole
in
the
pavement
gathered
rubbish
but
in
kigali
s
leaders
decided
to
start
demolishing
slums
in
the
capital
s
poor
suburbs
those
with
little
access
to
piped
water
or
electricity
and
replace
them
with
new
roads
and
homes
nyiramajyambere
who
had
owned
a
small
milk
shop
was
given
a
modest
new
home
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
families
like
hers
also
got
compensation
of
to
help
them
settle
in
the
move
was
a
first
step
in
what
has
turned
into
an
ambitious
master
plan
to
clean
up
kigali
one
that
has
led
to
the
city
being
hailed
as
one
of
the
greenest
and
cleanest
in
africa
earlier
this
year
at
the
world
economic
forum
meeting
in
davos
switzerland
environment
programme
head
eric
solheim
referred
to
kigali
as
the
cleanest
city
on
the
planet
both
in
terms
of
lack
of
rubbish
on
the
streets
and
green
initiatives
the
accolade
recognised
a
combination
of
government
schemes
that
have
made
the
rwandan
capital
much
tidier
than
before
but
that
also
have
spurred
resistance
from
many
displaced
slumdwellers
the
effort
is
in
part
a
response
to
rapid
growth
in
the
capital
which
has
seen
its
population
double
since
to
about
million
residents
many
of
them
living
in
informal
settlements
according
to
the
municipal
government
in
municipal
authorities
drew
up
a
master
plan
to
improve
the
city
s
environment
while
also
trying
to
promote
social
inclusion
sustainable
economic
development
and
access
to
civic
facilities
one
focus
was
traffic
congestion
to
try
to
alleviate
it
the
rwandan
government
spent
million
to
pave
narrow
streets
widen
all
main
roads
to
dual
carriageways
and
improve
signs
it
also
upgraded
bus
services
between
the
suburbs
and
the
city
centre
to
encourage
people
to
use
public
transport
said
bruno
rangira
a
kigali
city
spokesman
in
an
interview
with
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
as
well
the
government
committed
nearly
million
to
relocate
several
dozen
factories
in
a
former
wetlands
industrial
area
to
a
newly
established
special
economic
zone
it
has
also
begun
to
remove
nearly
smaller
businesses
from
motor
repair
shops
to
restaurants
that
encroach
on
the
city
s
wetlands
with
the
goal
of
restoring
the
land
to
its
natural
state
by
parfait
busabizwa
kigali
s
for
economic
development
told
reporters
in
december
that
the
city
wants
to
create
an
artificial
lake
on
reclaimed
wetlands
for
recreation
and
to
protect
against
flooding
a
worsening
problem
in
the
city
as
climate
change
brings
more
intense
rainfall
owners
of
businesses
constructed
illegally
on
wetlands
are
not
being
offered
compensation
according
to
the
rwanda
environmental
management
authority
and
the
ministry
in
charge
of
industries
but
they
will
be
given
the
chance
to
buy
new
land
in
a
suburban
area
where
they
will
be
given
construction
permits
busabizwa
said
other
legal
businesses
displaced
by
the
cleanup
effort
are
expected
to
receive
compensation
and
help
relocating
by
the
end
of
using
a
nearly
million
government
fund
he
said
not
all
business
owners
are
happy
about
the
shift
emile
murekezi
who
saw
his
garage
in
kinamba
a
marshland
suburb
closed
and
demolished
in
said
he
is
now
doing
jobs
while
waiting
to
find
an
appropriate
place
to
relocate
his
shop
shifting
businesses
could
lead
to
many
people
losing
their
jobs
he
said
as
old
clients
disappear
and
finding
new
ones
proves
a
struggle
slum
residents
and
landlords
with
property
in
central
parts
of
the
city
also
have
objected
to
being
relocated
usually
to
more
distant
areas
one
goal
of
the
changes
in
the
city
is
to
reach
more
people
with
services
but
greener
ones
such
as
biogas
from
sewage
rangira
said
key
contributors
to
kigali
s
green
push
are
residents
themselves
who
like
all
rwandan
citizens
are
required
to
perform
a
day
of
community
work
called
umuganda
once
a
month
in
the
capital
the
workdays
focus
on
things
like
clearing
land
for
community
gardens
picking
up
rubbish
or
helping
to
build
new
roads
classrooms
or
residential
toilets
for
families
that
lack
them
the
city
also
is
trying
to
set
up
trash
collection
sites
in
all
suburban
areas
and
is
working
with
local
businesses
to
install
public
toilets
rangira
said
in
the
meantime
busabizwa
said
that
kigali
rather
than
relying
primarily
on
fines
to
ensure
cleanliness
is
building
awareness
campaigns
to
promote
a
culture
of
hygiene
according
to
national
government
statistics
more
than
percent
of
households
in
kigali
now
have
access
to
toilets
and
to
clean
water
the
city
also
plans
to
create
a
new
more
than
million
wastewater
treatment
plant
by
in
giti
cy
inyoni
a
suburb
of
kigali
according
to
giselle
umuhumuza
deputy
managing
director
of
the
government
s
water
and
sanitation
corporation
teddy
kaberuka
a
independent
researcher
on
economic
and
development
issues
said
that
efforts
from
banning
plastic
bags
to
budgeting
for
city
cleaning
have
crucially
been
accompanied
by
efforts
to
persuade
people
of
the
benefits
of
the
changes
even
more
progress
in
winning
backing
for
the
green
push
could
be
made
by
creating
more
jobs
for
cleaners
rubbish
collectors
and
gardeners
he
said
so
far
the
rwanda
utility
regulatory
authority
has
granted
nearly
licenses
to
cleaning
services
companies
which
mostly
hire
women
relocated
from
shanty
towns
according
to
a
report
by
the
authority
nyiramajyambere
is
one
of
them
having
traded
her
job
as
an
informal
shop
owner
for
one
as
a
street
cleaner
something
she
says
has
increased
her
income
thanks
to
the
new
job
i
can
now
feed
my
family
and
my
children
are
now
going
to
schools
