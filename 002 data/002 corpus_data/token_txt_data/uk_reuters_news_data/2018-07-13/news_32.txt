municipal
workers
in
japan
struggled
on
friday
to
restore
water
supply
in
the
western
region
a
week
after
inundation
caused
by
a
record
downpour
killed
more
than
people
in
the
worst
weather
disaster
in
years
communities
that
grappled
with
rising
floodwaters
last
week
now
find
themselves
battling
scorching
summer
temperatures
well
above
degrees
celsius
as
garbage
piles
up
in
streets
we
need
the
water
supply
back

hiroshi
oka
a
resident
helping
to
clean
up
the
mabi
district
in
one
of
the
areas
the
city
of
kurashiki
where
more
than
households
have
gone
without
water
for
a
week
what
we
are
getting
is
a
thin
stream
of
water
and
we
can
t
flush
toilets
or
wash
our
hands

has
been
restored
to
some
parts
of
the
district
a
city
official
told
reuters

he
did
not
know
when
normal
operation
would
resume
as
engineers
are
still
trying
to
locate
water
pipeline
ruptures
the
soaring
temperatures
have
fuelled

illness
as
hygiene
levels
deteriorate
