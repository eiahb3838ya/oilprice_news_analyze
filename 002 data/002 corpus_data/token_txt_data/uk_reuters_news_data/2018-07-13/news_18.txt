russia
and
other
leading
oil
producers
may
boost
oil
output
further
if
supply
shortages
hit
the
global
oil
market
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
friday
the
expected
drop
in
iranian
crude
exports
this
year
due
to
renewed
sanctions
coupled
with
a
decline
in
venezuela
s
production
and
outages
in
libya
canada
and
the
north
sea
have
driven
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
in
recent
weeks
opec
and
other
key
producers
including
russia
responded
to
the
tightness
by
easing
a
agreement
in
june
the
deal
effectively
increases
combined
oil
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
which
russia
s
share
stands
at
bpd
if
we
need
more
than
million
bpd
i
don
t
rule
out
that
we
can
quickly
discuss
it
and
make
a
quick
decision
novak
told
reporters
adding
that
the
leading
oil
producers
can
get
together
and
discuss
the
market
situation
at
a
teleconference
he
also
said
russia
may
surpass
the
level
of
increases
if
there
is
a
need
for
it
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
that
there
were
already
very
welcome
signs
that
output
from
leading
producers
had
been
boosted
and
may
reach
a
record
the
global
energy
watchdog
however
said
the
disruptions
underscored
the
pressure
on
global
supplies
as
the
world
s
spare
production
capacity
cushion
might
be
stretched
to
the
limit
novak
said
higher
crude
prices
this
year
would
add
trillion
roubles
billion
to
state
coffers
this
year
the
minister
also
said
that
the
war
of
tariffs
between
the
united
states
and
china
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
global
economy
and
boosted
oil
price
volatility
