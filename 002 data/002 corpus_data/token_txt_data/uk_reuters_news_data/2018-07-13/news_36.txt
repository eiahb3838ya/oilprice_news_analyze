that
even
stronger
punitive

from

may
be

have
been
as

ponder
the
impact
of

percent
tariffs
on
an
additional

in
chinese
imports
the
slapped
import
tariffs
of
percent
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
on

prompting
a
matching
response
from
china
while
china
has
vowed
to
retaliate
to
the
new
tariffs
the
lack
of
a
specific
response
to

has
sparked
global
relief

by
expectations

corporate
earnings

a
high
on

some
troubling
if

recall
what
happened
when
the
cfo
of
caterpillar
said
last

season
that
was
likely
to
be
the
high
water
mark
all
we
need
is
somebody
with
serious
exposure
to
the
global
economy
to
do
something
similar
and
we
re
talking
about
the
downside
again
for
stocks
not
the
upside

said
offering
some
reassurance
to

said
on

china
could
reopen

to
make
serious
efforts
to
make

some
have
suggested
that
chinese
officials
are
easing
back
their
rhetoric
with
the
intention
of
going
back
to
the
negotiation
table
perhaps
in
light
of
increased
concerns
about
economic
impacts
anz
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
on
friday
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
is
truly
a
change
in
tone
or
if
the
news
was
a
surprise
to
china
s
economic
team
and
a
reaction
is
being
