trader
in

said
that
a
good
earnings
season
could
nevertheless
bring
with
it
some
troubling
if

recall
what
happened
when
the

that

to
be
the
high

all
we
need
is
somebody
with
serious
exposure
to
the
global
economy
to
do
something
similar
and
we
re
talking
about
the

fears
over
the
impact
of
an
escalating

possibly
as
its

there
was
little
immediate
reaction
in
chinese

to
the

have
suggested

officials
are
easing
