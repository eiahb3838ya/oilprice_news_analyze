seven
years
on
from
japan
s
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
the
beaten
down
uranium
sector
is
attracting
interest
as
analysts
and
investors
see
signs
its
time
in
the
wilderness
may
drawing
to
an
end
years
of
low
prices
have
forced
cuts
by
large
producers
who
have
also
shelved
new
investments
while
reactor
restarts
in
japan
and
a
drive
by
china
to
cut
pollution
point
to
a
potential
revival
although
the
timing
of
any
is
unclear
australian
fund
manager
tribeca
is
betting
on
a
sector
recovery
over
the
next
two
to
four
years
with
the
forthcoming
launch
of
a
mining
investment
fund
it
expects
uranium
prices
and
mining
shares
to
rally
as
asian
nations
build
new
reactors
to
reduce
their
reliance
on
polluting
fossil
fuels
you
ve
seen
japan
coming
back
china
has
made
a
very
clear
and
aggressive
focus
on
reducing
pollution
that
s
becoming
a
theme
that
the
rest
of
the
emerging
market
is
picking
up
fund
manager
guy
keller
told
reuters
uranium
spot
prices
slumped
from
over
a
pound
to
below
in
late
tribeca
sees
term
prices
at
least
doubling
from
a
tonne
over
the
next
few
years
keller
said
tribeca
plans
to
launch
its
fund
on
with
an
overall
target
of
million
it
will
have
a
and
is
targeting
mining
investments
to
hold
as
well
as
taking
physical
price
exposure
japan
last
month
confirmed
plans
to
make
nuclear
power
percent
of
its
total
power
mix
by
up
from
pct
in
while
china
is
set
to
boost
nuclear
power
capacity
by
more
than
percent
to
gigawatt
gw
by
the
end
of
this
decade
it
sees
that
at
around

by
china
s
nuclear
reactors
are
already
gaining
global
market
share
china
general
nuclear
corp
cgn
and
france
s
edf
are
building
a
hualong
reactor
in
england
while
china
also
has
a
deal
to
build
a
third
large
reactor
in
pakistan
going
forward
reactor
technology
will
be
exported
and
that
will
accelerate
growth
in
emerging
markets
keller
said
broker
argonaut
also
sees
a
recovery
for
the
downtrodden
sector
we
believe
the
uranium
price
is
within
two
years
of
a
sustained
recovery
it
said
in
a
recent
report
risks
however
include
construction
delays
in
china
s
next
generation
plants
due
to
both
protracted
safety
testing
and
difficulty
in
gaining
funding
given
a
current
domestic
power
oversupply
china
s
nuclear
is
well
behind
schedule
noted
argonaut
hong
analyst
helen
lau
australia
the
world
s
third
largest
producer
expects
uranium
prices
to
start
rising
slowly
after
recent
production
cuts
however
it
sees
spot
prices
rising
only
around
a
pound
from
current
levels
to
by
at
which
level
uranium
will
remain
a
commodity
for
most
producers
the
department
of
industry
said
in
its
latest
quarterly
minerals
report
further
out
however
it
said
new
capacity
under
construction
and
the
in
supply
should
lead
to
much
greater
upward
price
pressure
over
the
longer
term
