haiyou
petrochemical
group
has
no
definite
plan
to
reopen
its
crude
oil
distillation
unit
cdu
after
shutting
it
down
sometime
in
late
may
two
industry
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
plant
s
operation
said
on
friday
the
plant
in
the
city
of
rizhao
in
shandong
province
owns
a
cdu
with
a
capacity
of
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
which
it
shut
down
after
a
local
government
order
to
cut
down
pollution
ahead
of
a
regional
summit
in
june
the
sources
said
haiyou
however
will
keep
open
its
million
delayed
coker
a
unit
that
processes
residual
fuel
oil
into
lighter
refined
products
such
as
diesel
and
gasoline
said
one
of
the
sources
falling
profit
margins
following
beijing
s
move
to
tighten
tax
rules
for
independent
oil
refiners
and
blenders
could
be
one
reason
for
haiyou
s
extended
shutdown
the
two
sources
said
haiyou
s
large
debt
burden
could
be
another
reason
as
the
plant
struggles
to
secure
financing
for
oil
purchases
said
the
second

has
knowledge
of
the
plant
s
financial
status
haiyou
has

quota
of
