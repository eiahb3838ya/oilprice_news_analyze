a

ruled
on

investors
in
two
separate
suits
claimed
that
porsche
se
which
controls
percent
of
vw
s
voting
rights
had
not
disclosed
the
financial
risks
of
vw
s
emissions
scandal
quickly
enough
when
it
emerged
in
their
lawyers
demanded
that
bosch
provide
concerning
its
business
with
vw
bosch
which
makes
an
engine
control
unit
used
by
several
top
automakers
including
vw
had
protested
saying
it
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
provide
evidence
the
stuttgart
court
ruled
that
bosch
had
no
such
right
in
this
case
it
said
the
showed
bosch
acted
in
accordance
with
the
law
which
meant
it
could
not
argue
that
it
risked
incriminating
itself
by
handing
them
over
providing
the
would
also
not
risk
causing
direct
financial
damage
to
the
company
or
to
anyone
to
whom
it
is
accountable
it
said
nor
could
bosch
refuse
based
on
its
right
to
protect
trade
secrets
since
manipulation
of
engine
control
software
is
illegal
and
therefore
not
protected
by
law
bosch
said
it
would
await
the
court
s
full
written
opinion
and
then
consider
how
to
respond
the

reserves
the
right
to
file
a
legal
challenge
to
protect
the
interests
of
bosch
it
said
in
a
statement
preference
shares
in
porsche
se
fell
by
more
than
percent
in
the
two
weeks
after
the
vw
emissions
scandal
broke
they
remain
nearly
percent
below
their
value
prior
to
the
news
that
vw
had
cheated
on
emissions
