china
s
crude
oil
imports
fell
for
a
second
month
in
a
row
in
june
to
the
lowest
since
december
as
shrinking
margins
and
volatile
oil
prices
led
some
independent
refiners
known
as
teapots
to
scale
back
purchases
june
shipments
came
in
at
million
tonnes
or
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
according
to
data
from
the
general
administration
of
customs
that
was
down
percent
from
million
bpd
in
may
and
also
down
from
million
bpd
in
june
last
year
thomson

oil
research
had
pegged
china
s
crude
oil
arrivals
in
june
at
million
tonnes
imports
for
the
first
half
of
this
year
were
still
up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
at
million
tonnes
or
about
million
bpd
the
official
data
showed
while
some
and
independent
plants
were
shut
for
regular
maintenance
others
took
advantage
of
weakening
margins
and
oil
prices
at
near
to
conduct
extended
shutdowns
the
numbers
are
lower
than
we
expected
mostly
because
of
slowing
down
at
some
teapot
plants
as
they
face
growing
domestic
competition
in
refined
fuel
supplies
and
weakening
margins
said

the
oil
price
volatility
is
certainly
not
helping
as
not
many
independent
plants
are
doing
sophisticated
shandong
shengxing
chemical

shut
its
crude
oil
unit
at
the
end
of

a
teapot

annual

quotas
of
million

has
kept
its
crude

date
to

imports
of
oil
products
fell
percent
to
million
tonnes
while
oil
product
exports
fell
percent
to

data
showed
however
total
gas
imports
in
june
including
pipeline
gas
and
liquefied
natural
gas
rose
to
million
tonnes
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
customs
said
imports
hit
million
tonnes
percent
higher
than
the
same
period
in
gas
maintained
high
growth
as
demand
remained
strong
for
storage
fills
as
well
as
for
industrial
uses
local
governments
are
rolling
out
hikes
in
benchmark
gas
prices
for
residential
use
following
a
policy
change
by
beijing
in
may
to
unify
residential
prices
with
industrial
users
in
a
boost
for
gas
producers
the
change
effectively
removes
subsidies
for
the
residential
sector
