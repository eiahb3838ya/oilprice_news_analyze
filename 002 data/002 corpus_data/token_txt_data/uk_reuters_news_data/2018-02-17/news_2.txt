its

accountable
for

and
support
the

will
strike
if

weapons
are
used
against
civilians
in
the
syrian
conflict
in
violation
of
international
treaties
but
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
proof
this
is
the
case
the
syrian

has
repeatedly
denied
using
chemical
weapons
and
said
it
targets
only
armed
rebels
and
militants
in
recent
weeks
rescue

have
made
scant
progress
towards
ending
a
war

approaching
its
eighth
year
which

killed
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
and
forced
half
the
syrian
population
of
million
from
their
homes
mcmaster
called
on
the
international
community
to
do
more
on
north
korea
we
must
pressure
the
kim
regime
using
all
available
tools
to
ensure
that
this
cruel
dictatorship
can
not
threaten
the
world
with
the
most
destructive
weapons
on
earth
he
said
referring
to
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
the
united
states
has
appeared
to
endorse
closer
engagement
between
north
and
south
korea
with
an
eye
to
eventual
korean
talks
but
has
agreed
with
seoul
that
sanctions
must
be
intensified
to
push
pyongyang
to
negotiate
an
end
to
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
the
prospect
of
negotiations
comes
after
months
of
tension
over
north
korea
s
nuclear
and
missile
programs
in
which
president
donald
trump
and
the
north
korean
leader
traded
insults
and
threats
while
the
tightened
sanctions
nations
that
evade
full
enforcement
and
fail
to
take
these
steps
are
acting
irresponsibly
now
is
the
time
to
do
more
mcmaster
said
calling
on
countries
to
cut
off
military
and
commercial
ties
with
pyongyang
