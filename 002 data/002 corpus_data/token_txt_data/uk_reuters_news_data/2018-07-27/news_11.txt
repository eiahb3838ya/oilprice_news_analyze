lisbon
july
reuters
france
spain
and
portugal
agreed
on
friday
to
increase
the
links
between
their
energy
networks
aiming
to
reduce
the
iberian
peninsula
s
isolation
from
european
electricity
and
gas
markets
and
to
boost
energy
security
at
a
summit
in
lisbon
the
leaders
of
the
three
countries
pledged
to
boost
alternative
energy
sources
and
routes
including
liquified
natural
gas
lng
at
a
time
that
europe
is
facing
pressure
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
gas
from
russia
identifying
risks
to
europe
s
energy
supplies
the
three
underlined
the
importance
of
lng
to
diversify
the
sources
and
routes
of
eu
energy
supply
with
a
view
to
reducing
dependence
and
thereby
strengthening
energy
security
according
to
a
joint
statement
one
possibility
is
the
development
of
gas
pipelines
between
spain
and
france
over
the
pyrenees
to
pump
gas
from
north
africa
or
elsewhere
officials
said
french
president
emmanuel
macron
told
journalists
that
regulators
were
considering
the
relevance
of
new
gas
interconnections
and
in
particular
a
gas
interconnection
between
france
and
spain
he
added
that
such
a
pipeline
could
make
economic
sense
as
france
turns
away
from
coal
plants
friday
s
main
concrete
achievement
was
an
agreement
to
build
an
electricity
line
under
the
bay
of
biscay
from
northern
spain
to
france
it
will
receive
million
euros
million
from
the
european
commission
the
biggest
such
investment
by
europe
in
an
energy
project
by
the
electricity
link
should
raise
spain
s
energy
interconnection
capacity
close
to
the
european
target
of
percent
from
six
percent
now
the
european
union
has
set
a
target
that
member
states
should
have
at
least
percent
of
their
electricity
output
connected
to
other
countries
networks
i
think
this
meeting
clearly
shows
our
firm
comitment
to
the
european
energy
union
spanish
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
told
journalists
european
commission
president
juncker
said
in
a
statement
that
boosting
energy
interconnections
between
the
three
countries
was
a
step
towards
strengthening
the
security
of
energy
supply
across
europe
the
united
states
is
trying
to
sell
lng
to
europe
possibly
through
portugal
s
southern
sines
deep
water
port
for
that
gas
to
reach
europe
s
biggest
northern
economies
network
connections
would
be
necessary
between
iberia
and
france
portugal
is
actively
pushing
to
develop
the
potential
of
sines
portugal
and
spain
already
have
a
joint
iberian
electricity
market
called
mibel
whereby
producers
can
sell
extra
capacity
across
the
border
through
an
auction
system
that
started
in
euros
