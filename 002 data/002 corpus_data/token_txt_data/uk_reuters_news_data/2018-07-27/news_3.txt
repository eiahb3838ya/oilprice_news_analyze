booming
shale

forced
refiners
to
retrofit
the
distillation
process
to
handle
more
of
the
very
light

has
been
rising

record
high

hitting
a

the
widening
of
the

larger
discounts
on
inland
crudes
and
improved
heavy

all
contributed
to
increased

margins
phillips
said
we
expect
western

discounts
to
be
attractive
for
at

the
next
months
and
potentially
longer

no

overhauls
planned
at
its
nine
refineries
in
the
third

of
prices
for
canadian
crude
have
also
dropped
