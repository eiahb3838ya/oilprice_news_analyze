refining
margins
in
singapore
are
set
for
their
biggest
monthly
gain
since
as
surging
demand
for
gasoline
and
jet
fuel
lifted
fuel
prices
at
the
same
time
crude
oil
dropped
reducing
feedstock
costs
for
refiners
the
profit
from
refining
a
barrel
of
benchmark

rose
to
a

pushing
the

in
overall

refining
margins
appear
to
have
been
supported
by
a
combination
of
factors
including
demand
for
gasoline
and
middle
distillates
particularly
across
the
emerging
markets

research
fuel
oil
margins
in
july
were
also
supported
as
less
supply
arrived
in
asia
from
europe
margins
are
unlikely
to
maintain
their
recent
gains
as
chinese
fuel
exports
may
continue
to
increase
and
oil
prices
rebound
risks
to
subsequent
quarters
margins
lie
to
the
downside
amid
relentless
fuels
exports
out
of
china
stronger
oil
prices
and
potential
effects
onto
retail
prices
and

appetite

china
s
gasoil
or

exports
have
contributed
to
growing

stockpiles
in

gasoline
inventories
in

also
remain
high
despite
solid
demand
in
europe
and
the
united
states
with
singapore
inventories
reported
at
highs
this
week
even
fuel
oil
margins
should
drop
as
more
supply
comes
onto
the
market
we
could
see
pressure
on

cracks
emerge
as
surging
