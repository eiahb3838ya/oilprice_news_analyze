in
the

analysts

economists
forecasts
showed
a
median
of
percent
growth
for
nigeria
accelerating
to
percent
next

that
was
a
significant
downgrade
from
the
previous
poll
taken
three
months
ago
which
showed
africa
s
largest
economy
expanding
percent
this
year
after
a
lacklustre
percent
in
upcoming
elections
and
the
associated
politics
already
underway
would
instigate
caution
on
the
part
of
economic
stakeholders
said
rafiq
raji
chief
economist
at
macroafricaintel
in

who
expects
the

to
slow
in
the
next
few
quarters
business

decisions
are
thus
likely
to
be
postponed

and
the

s

senior
politician
said
he
might
follow
suit
in
a
blow
to
the
leader
who
is
seeking
next
year
this
comes
at
a
tough
time
for
the
economy
growth
slowed
in
the
first
quarter
of
for
the
first
time
since
the
country
pulled
out
of
recession
last
year
as
the
sector
struggled
fellow
heavyweight
south
africa
also
suffered
its
worst
quarterly
contraction
in
nine
years
in
a
reminder
to
investors
of
the
huge
challenge
president
cyril
ramaphosa
faces
to
deliver
long
term
economic
growth
a
separate
survey
earlier
this
month
showed
south
african
gdp
is
expected
to
grow
percent
this
year
however
reserve
bank
governor
lesetja
kganyago
shocked
markets
last
week
when
he
revealed
the
bank
projects
growth
at
only
percent
slower
than
last
year
it
is
a
different
story
for
kenya
east
africa
s
biggest
economy
where
analysts
forecasts
showed
a
median
of
percent
growth
this
year
despite
its
debt
problems
that
was
unchanged
from
a
poll
taken
three
months
ago
growth
is
expected
to
accelerate
next
year
to
percent
slightly
faster
than
in
the
last
survey
raji
attributed
this
to
the
fact
that
kenya
is
now
an
oil
producer
even
though
robust
production
levels
are
a
long
way
off
he
cautioned
that
the
recent
suspension
of
production
by
tullow
on
security
grounds
could
cause
problems
tullow
aims
to
produce
the
first
oil
from
its
billion
kenya
project
by
allowing
the
country
to
export
crude
however
protests
and
security
problems
have
halted
a
pilot
scheme
which
trucks
around
barrels
of
oil
per
day
to
a
storage
facility
in
mombasa
major
african
economies
are
also
at
risk
to
what
may
be
more
difficult
times
for
the
world
economy
reuters
polls
of
several
hundred
economists
taken
this
month
show
global
economic
activity
remains
solid
but
has
already
passed
its
peak
with
protectionist
trade
policies
likely
to
slow
activity
significantly
the
impact
of
higher
trade
tariffs
will
weigh
on
inflation
and
consumption
expenditure
in
advanced
economies
said
gaimin
nonyane
head
of
economic
research
at
ecobank
group
extended
sentiment
is
also
a
downside
risk
to
price
levels
and
growth
in
developing
but
many
african
economies
have
been
relatively
insulated
from
the
challenges
facing
larger
global
economies
in
ethiopia
for
example
growth
has
averaged
nearly
percent
for
the
past
decade
albeit
from
a
very
low
