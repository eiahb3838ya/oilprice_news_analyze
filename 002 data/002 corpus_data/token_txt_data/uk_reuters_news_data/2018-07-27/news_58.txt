the
first
warning
came
at
one
hour
later
the
water
started
to
flow
through
the
village
and
by
late
evening
it
was
a
torrent
inpon
sivatan
was
at
home
on
monday
afternoon
when
the
village
chief
knocked
on
his
door
to
warn
that
their
remote
hamlet
in
the
southern
tip
of
laos
was
about
to
be
flooded
the
water
came
really
fast
it
just
rushed
through
the
village
said
inpon
as
he
tidied
his
house
in
khokong
one
of
seven
villages
that
was
all
but
obliterated
when
a
nearby
hydropower
dam
collapsed
on
monday
sending
a
wall
of
water
crashing
across
mountains
jungle
and
rural
communities
i
ve
lived
here
for
years
and
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
this
inpon
said
a
medical
official
in
a
nearby
settlement
who
asked
not
to
be
named
said
locals
received
an
alert
about
three
to
four
hours
before
the
dam
burst
but
few
took
it
seriously
and
did
not
expect
the
water
to
rise
as
high
as
it
did
the
power
company
a
hydropower
project
that
involves
laotian
thai
and
south
korean
firms
on
monday
told
local
officials
in
a
letter
written
in
english
that
one
of
its
subsidiary
dams
was
unsafety
and
had
started
to
overflow
and
requested
that
they
inform
downstream
villages
it
was
not
clear
what
time
the
letter
a
copy
of
which
was
seen
by
reuters
was
delivered
at
that
evening
according
to
state
media
saddle
dam
d
part
of
a
network
of
two
main
dams
and
five
subsidiary
dams
failed
and
the
deluge
began
the
scale
of
the
disaster
in
the
southern
province
of
attapeu
was
still
unclear
on
friday
in
part
because
of
the
inaccessibility
of
the
area
but
also
because
reports
from
the
isolated
and
country
s
state
media
have
been
scant
sketchy
and
sometimes
inconsistent
but
in
khokong
the
scale
of
the
damage
was
palpable
every
inch
of
this
sleepy
farming
community
was
covered
in
a
swamp
of
viscous
mud
a
dead
baby
water
buffalo
lay
motionless
its
head
buried
in
the
thick
clay
dogs
still
trapped
in
wooden
stilt
houses
howled
for
their
owners
i
lost
everything
said
inpon
who
tried
in
vain
to
rescue
his
car
by
driving
it
to
the
highest
point
in
the
village
a
nearby
petrol
station
there
was
not
enough
time
to
get
out

armada
of
boats
the
unstoppable
force
of
the
water
released
from
the
dam
devastated
the
meagre
road
between
khokong
and
its
nearest
big
town
attapeu
complicating
rescue
efforts
to
bring
food
and
water
across
dangerous
muddied
roads
and
the
search
for
trapped
survivors
the
lao
army
has
set
up
checkpoints
to
filter
the
deluge
of
volunteers
who
have
driven
overland
from
other
parts
of
laos
and
from
neighbouring
thailand
into
the
secretive
communist
country
some
of
those
volunteers
have
donated
a
armada
of
wooden
fishing
boats
and
inflatable
banana
boats
to
navigate
the
sea
of
mud
so
rescuers
can
ferry
drinking
water
to
villages
like
khokong
as
inpon
fruitlessly
mopped
the
porch
of
his
waterlogged
house
a
young
family
evacuated
their
stilt
home
in
the
rain
outside
two
young
girls
used
a
broken
oar
to
steer
mattresses
like
rafts
initial
reports
had
suggested
the
death
toll
from
the
burst
dam
could
climb
to
several
hundred
and
on
wednesday
the
vientiane
times
reported
some
people
were
still
waiting
to
be
rescued
from
swirling
floodwaters
many
of

of

houses
