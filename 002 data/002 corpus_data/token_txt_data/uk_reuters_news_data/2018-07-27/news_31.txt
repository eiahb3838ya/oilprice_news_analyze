for
billion
billion
pounds
expanding
the
british
oil
major
s
footprint
in
some
of
the
nation
s
most
productive
oil
basins
in
its
biggest
deal
in
nearly
years
the
acquisition
of
about
producing
acres
marks
a
turning
point
for
bp
since
the
deepwater
horizon
rig
disaster
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
for
which
the
company
is
still
paying
off
more
than
billion
in
penalties
and
costs
this
is
a
transformational
acquisition
for
our
onshore
business
a
major
step
in
delivering
our
upstream
strategy
and
a
addition
to
bp
s
distinctive
portfolio
bp
chief
executive
bob
dudley
said
in
a
statement
in
a
further
sign
of
the
upturn
in
its
fortunes
bp
said
it
would
increase
its
quarterly
dividend
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
four
years
and
announced
a
billion
share
buyback
to
be
partly
funded
by
selling
some
upstream
assets
bp
s
shares
were
trading
percent
higher
at
gmt
compared
with
a
percent
gain
in
the
broader
european
energy
index
the
sale
ends
a
disastrous
foray
by
bhp
into
shale
on
which
the
company
effectively
blew
up
billion
of
shareholders
funds
investors
led
by
hedge
fund
elliott
management
have
been
pressing
the
mining
company
to
jettison
the
onshore
assets
for
the
past
months
bhp
put
the
business
up
for
sale
last
august
the
sale
price
was
better
than
the
billion
to
billion
that
analysts
had
expected
and
investors
were
pleased
that
bhp
planned
to
return
the
proceeds
to
shareholders
it
was
the
wrong
environment
to
have
bought
the
assets
when
they
did
but
this
is
the
right
market
to
have
sold
them
in
said
craig
evans
manager
of
the
tribeca
global
natural
resources
fund
bhp
first
acquired
shale
assets
in
for
more
than
billion
with
the
takeover
of
petrohawk
energy
and
shale
gas
interests
from
chesapeake
energy
corp
at
the
peak
of
the
oil
boom
it
spent
a
further
billion
developing
the
assets
but
suffered
as
gas
and
oil
prices
collapsed
triggering
massive
writedowns
the
world
s
biggest
miner
said
it
would
record
a
further
shale
charge
of
about
billion
in
its
financial
year
results
the
deal
bp
s
biggest
since
it
bought
oil
company
atlantic
richfield
co
in
will
increase
its
onshore
oil
and
gas
resources
by
percent
bp
will
acquire
bhp
s
unit
holding
eagle
ford
haynesville
and
permian
basin
shale
assets
for
billion
giving
it
some
of
the
best
acreage
in
some
of
the
best
basins
in
the
onshore
the
company
said
for
a
graphic

oil
production
click
its
bid
beat
rivals
including
royal
dutch
shell
and
chevron
corp
for
the
assets
which
have
combined
production
of
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
and
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
resources
the
acquisition
could
push
bp
s
total
production
to
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
in
two
years
and
close
to
million
by
said
maxim
petrov
a

the
permian

offers
the
biggest
upside
with
some
of
the
best

the
play

said
petrov
the
deal
would
turn
the
onshore

company
bernard
looney
bp
s
head
of
upstream
said
in
a
call
with
analysts
it
will
bring
bp
into
the
permian
basin
in
west
texas
where
production
has
surged
in
recent
years
with
it
bp
s
onshore
oil
production
will
jump
from
barrels
per
day
to
bpd
by
the
looney
said
bp
said
the
transaction
would
boost
its
earnings
and
cash
flow
per
share
and
it
would
still
be
able
to
maintain
its
gearing
within
a
percent
range
the
company
also
said
it
would
increase
its
quarterly
dividend
by
percent
to
cents

tribeca

evans
welcomed
the
clean
exit
for
cash
rather
than
asset
swaps
which
bhp
had
flagged
as
a
possibility
it
leaves
the
company
good
scope
to
focus
on
their
far
better
offshore
oil
business
he
said
bhp
chief

andrew
mackenzie
said
the
company
had
delivered
on
its
promise
to
get
value
for
its
shale
assets
while
the
sale
was
consistent
with
a
plan
to
simplify
and
strengthen
its
portfolio
bhp
