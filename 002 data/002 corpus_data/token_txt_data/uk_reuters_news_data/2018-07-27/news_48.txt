wind
turbine
maker
siemens
gamesa
warned
on
friday
that
trade
tensions
would
drive
up
costs
after
reporting
a
fall
in
quarterly
sales
and
profits
due
to
lower
turbine
sales
and
pricing
the
trade
row
adds
to
challenges
facing
wind
turbine
makers
such
as
siemens
gamesa
vestas
and
general
electric
which
already
face
pressure
from
tighter
markets
and
the
phasing
out
of
government
subsidies
the
united
states
and
china
have
imposed
tariffs
on
each
other
s
imports
worth
billion
moves
that
have
driven
up
the
cost
of
steel
the
main
raw
material
for
wind
turbine
parts
and
other
components
siemens
gamesa
said
the
company
said
it

the

chain
decisions
on

year
s
earnings
costs
would
rise
by
to
percent
depending
on
the
product
and
whether
further
tariffs
would
be
implemented
chief
financial
officer
miguel
angel
lopez
told
an
call
with
analysts
he
said
the
company
was
working
to
reduce
the
impact
on
margins
by
optimizing
our
supply
chief
executive
markus
tacke
said
it
was
not
likely
that
the
firm
could
pass
on
all
the
cost
increases
to
customers
we
are
operating
in
very
competitive
markets
he
said
the
likelihood
that
we
can
pass
through
these
effects
into

the
company

there
would
be
no
impact
on
earnings
as
the
extra
costs
were
covered
by

supplier
contracts

kept
its
