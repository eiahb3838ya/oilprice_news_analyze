again
said
michael

analyst
at

markets
in

nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
and
while
the
prospect
of
tariffs
on
european
cars
has
diminished
it
hasn
t
gone
away
completely
which
means
inevitably
the
market
shifts
its
attention
elsewhere
that
elsewhere
concerns
what
could
happen
next
with
respect
to
china
and
the
prospect
of
an
escalation

the

yuan
eased
on
course
to
mark
its

of

although
the
losses
were
cushioned
by
chinese
state
banks
swapping
of

expect

meeting
on

to
stop
short
of
making
immediate
policy
changes
and
to
say
instead
that
they
will
study

signalled
no
change
in
its
timetable
to
move
away
from
ultra
low
rates
or
end
its

purchase
program
there
was
a
dovish
spin
