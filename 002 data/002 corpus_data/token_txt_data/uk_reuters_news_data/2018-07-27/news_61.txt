struck
a
surprise
deal
on

virtually
halt

through
egypt
s
suez
canal
and
the

that
link
the
red

an

flowed
through
the
bab
strait
in

and
asia
according

has
the
petroline
also
known
as
the
pipeline
which
mainly
transports
crude
from
fields
clustered
in
the
east
to
yanbu
for
export
that
could
offset
a
bottleneck
caused
by
bab
s
closure
