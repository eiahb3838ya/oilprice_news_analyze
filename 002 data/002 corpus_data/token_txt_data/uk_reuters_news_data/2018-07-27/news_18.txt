during
an
briefing
mattis
remarks
were
the
most
detailed
by
a
senior
administration
official
about
policy
toward
iran
following
discussions
at
the
white
house
on
thursday
that
included
the
topic
of
iran
since
trump
s
decision
in
may
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
a
nuclear
agreement
between
iran
and
world
powers

clerical
establishment

been
under
increasing
pressure
and
the
prospect
of
possible
sanctions
as
the
tensions
simmered

australian
media
report
appeared
to
suggest
military

being
considered
right

mattis
told
reporters
speaking
at
an
event
earlier
in
the
day
washington
aims
to
force
tehran
to
end
its
nuclear
programme
and
its
support
of
militant
groups
in
the
middle
east
where
iran
is
involved
in
proxy
wars
from
yemen
to
syria
while
the
united
states
is
pushing
countries
to
cut
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
beginning
in
november
iran
has
warned
of
and
has
threatened
to
block
gulf
oil
exports
if
its
own
exports
are
halted
the
week
of
heated
rhetoric
between
washington
and
tehran
that
was
kicked
off
by
a
warning
from
iran
s
president
hassan
rouhani
on
sunday
that
hostile
policies
could
lead
to
the
mother
of
all
on
sunday
night
trump
said
in
a
twitter
posting
written
in
all
capital
letters
directed
at
rouhani
never
ever
threaten
the
united
states
again
or
you
will
suffer
consequences
the
likes
of
which
few
throughout
history
have
ever
suffered
before
we
are
no
longer
a
country
that
will
stand
for
your
demented
words
of
violence
death
be
cautious
the
harsh
words
evoked
memories
of
trump
s
warnings
to
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
last
year
over
his
nuclear
weapons
programme
which
raised
fears
of
a
major
conflict
those
concerns
have
eased
following
a
june
summit
between
trump
and
kim
still
analysts
warn
that
iran
is
a
far
different
challenge
and
that
stiff
rhetoric
could
harden
iranian
resolve
iran
s
guards
commanders
have
threatened
to
destroy
military
bases
across
the
middle
east
and
target
israel
which
iran
refuses
to
recognise
within
minutes
of
being
attacked
