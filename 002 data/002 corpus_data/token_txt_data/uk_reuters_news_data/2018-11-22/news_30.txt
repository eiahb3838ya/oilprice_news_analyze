north
korea
appears
to
be
still
expanding
operations
at
its
main
nuclear
site
the
atomic
watchdog
indicated
on
thursday
the
statement
by
the
head
of
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
is
a
further
sign
that
north
korea
is
pressing
ahead
with
its
atomic
activities
despite
pressure
from
the
united
states
for
it
to
scrap
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
at
a
leaders
summit
in
june
both
sides
pledged
to
work
towards
the
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
since
then
few
concrete
steps
have
been
made
towards
the
full
and
irreversible
dismantling
of
north
korea
s
nuclear
arms
programme
that
washington
has
called
for
at
yongbyon
north
korea
s
main
nuclear
facility
which
is
widely
believed
to
have
provided
fissile
material
for
its
bombs
components
appear
to
have
been
brought
into
a
reactor
being
built
there
iaea
chief
yukiya
amano
said
at
the
light
water
reactor
the
agency
also
observed
activities
consistent
with
the
fabrication
of
reactor
components
and
the
possible
transfer
of
these
components
into
the
reactor
building
amano
said
in
a
statement
to
the
iaea
s
board
of
governors
reporting
on
the
period
since
august
the
iaea
has
not
had
access
to
north
korea
since
and
mainly
monitors
activities
there
through
satellite
imagery
meaning
it
can
not
confirm
its
observations
north
korea
also
appeared
to
have
continued
work
at
the
nearby
kuryong
river
that
it
dammed
last
year
to
increase
the
supply
of
water
available
for
cooling
the
planned
reactor
or
the
existing
experimental
one
which
has
an
output
capacity
of
megawatts
further
activities
were
observed
near
the
kuryong
river
these
may
be
related
to
changes
to
the
cooling
infrastructure
for
the
e
reactor
and
the
light
water
reactor
amano
said
adding
that
the
experimental
reactor
was
likely
shut
down
while
some
of
those
unspecified
activities
were
carried
out
amano
referred
to
a
meeting
between
north
and
south
korea
in
september
at
which
the
north
expressed
its
readiness
to
take
measures
including
a
permanent
dismantlement
of
its
main
nuclear
facilities
in
yongbyon
should
there
be
unspecified
corresponding
action
from
the
united
states
apart
from
an
annual
report
on
developments
in
north
korea
the
iaea
does
not
normally
comment
on
what
it
sees
there
suggesting
that
amano
s
comments
were
aimed
at
illustrating
the
continued
activity
at
yongbyon
