the
amount

in
the
atmosphere
hit
a
new
record
last
year
with
emissions
showing
no
sign
of
slowing
down
the

meteorological
organization
said
on
thursday
the
annual
greenhouse
gas
bulletin
dashed
hopes
for
a
slowdown
in
emissions
of
the
byproduct
of
burning
fossil
fuels
that
scientists
say
is
the
main
cause
of
the
greenhouse
effect
causing
global
warming
the
science
is
clear
without
rapid
cuts
in

other
greenhouse
gases
climate
change
will
have
increasingly
destructive

irreversible

closed

in

the
report
found
levels
of
parts
per
million
in
up
from
ppm
in
the
rate
of
increase
is
in
line
with
the
average
growth
rate
over
the
last
decade
which
was
the
fastest
rate
for
million
years
the
wmo
said
carbon
dioxide
levels
have
risen
percent
since
the
era
around
the
most
alarming
thing
is
that
half
of
the
increase
from
times
comes
within
the
last
years
said
oksana
tarasova
head
of
wmo
s
atmospheric
environment
research
the
rise
was
expected
to
be
much
lower

the

unusually
