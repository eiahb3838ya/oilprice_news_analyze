update 1-poland calls for planting more forests worldwide to improve carbon capture
warsaw
reuters
poland
called
on
wednesday
for
more
forests
to
be
planted
worldwide
to
capture
carbon
emissions
and
so
curb
global
warming
speaking
ahead
of
annual
climate
talks
to
be
held
in
warsaw
next
month
poland
s
hosting
of
the
talks
has
been
contentious
given
its
dependence
on
coal
for
energy
and
various
environmental
disputes
poland
s
conservative
nationalist
government
has
had
with
the
european
union
including
increased
logging
of
the
ancient
bialowieza
forest
warsaw
has
repeatedly
said
it
needs
time
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
coal
and
has
meanwhile
launched
campaigns
to
promote
the
use
of
forests
to
capture
carbon
as
well
as
electric
vehicles
to
reduce
diesel
pollution
environment
minister
henryk
kowalczyk
noted
on
thursday
that
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
recently
determined
that
it
was
not
possible
to
limit
global
warming
without
curbing
carbon
emissions
the
ippc
report
said
that
keeping
the
earth
s
temperature
rise
to
degrees
celsius
means
making
rapid
unprecedented
changes
in
the
way
people
use
energy
to
eat
travel
and
live
the
report
said
that
if
average
global
temperature
growth
temporarily
exceeded
additional
carbon
removal
techniques
would
be
required
the
polish
presidency
draws
attention
to
this
through
encouraging
the
world
to
undertake
concrete
measures
in
this
field
kowalczyk
told
a
news
conference
the
ipcc
report
said
that
to
limit
temperature
rise
to
an
increase
of
up
to
million
square
kilometres
of
forests
would
be
needed
by
compared
to
levels
among
other
measures
that
is
equivalent
to
the
size
of
china
one
third
of
poland
s
land
mass
is
covered
by
trees
and
the
country
is
planting
more
ahead
of
the
global
climate
talks
warsaw
has
promoted
so
called
carbon
forest
projects
which
are
expected
to
absorb
about
million
tonnes
of
greenpeace
has
called
the
idea
a
cheap
excuse
and
a
secret
weapon
for
the
climate
conference
the
forest
carbon
farms
have
very
little
scientific
basis
and
marginal
meaning
for
the
absorption
of
polish
greenhouse
gas
emissions
greenpeace
said
in
a
statement
it
is
not
the
way
to
reach
climate
neutrality
but
in
the
best
case
scenario
a
pr
the
ruling
law
and
justice
party
pis
got
into
conflict
with
environmental
groups
and
the
eu
by
increasing
logging
in
the
primeval
bialowieza
forest
in
april
the
eu
court
of
justice
ruled
poland
had
broken
the
bloc
s
environmental
laws
with
the
logging
the
environment
minister
responsible
for
the
logging
was
dismissed
and
his
successor
kowalczyk
said
then
that
the
logging
had
already
been
halted
and
warsaw
would
honour
the
ecj
ruling
