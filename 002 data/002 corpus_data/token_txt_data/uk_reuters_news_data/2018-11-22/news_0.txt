a
top
aide
to
brazilian
jair
bolsonaro
said
on
thursday
the
new
government
would
adopt
concession
contracts
for
lucrative
oil
auctions
raising
concerns
that
talks
to
change
the
regime
would
drag
and
derail
investment
later
however
roberto
castello
branco
who
bolsonaro
has
tapped
to
lead
oil
company
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
said
there
was
no
final
decision
yet
on
what
contracts
the
new
administration
would
offer
in
the
highly
prized
deep
water
oil
tenders
bolsonaro
a
longtime
economic
nationalist
and
legislator
modified
his
stance
on
the
way
to
his
election
last
month
declaring
himself
open
to
selling
state
assets
and
ceding
ground
over
the
government
s
role
in
the
crucial
energy
sector
investors
are
eager
to
win
a
bigger
slice
of
brazil
s
oil
prize
but
the
shift
away
from
an
increasingly
successful
production
sharing
auction
regime
also
raises
concerns
that
any
changes
would
require
lengthy
discussions
in
congress
raising
uncertainty
and
causing
investment
to
dry
up
a
senior
transition
official
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
said
bolsonaro
s
administration
would
seek
to
modify
the
current
contract
in
the
fields
the
source
said
they
plan
to
adopt
a
concession
model
that
would
involve
less
state
interference
that
s
a
clear
preference
of
ours
we
will
change
to
concessions
instead
of
the
source
said
without
elaborating
on
whether
the
new
policy
would
require
a
change
in
the
law
the
model
which
was
rolled
out
by
the
leftist
workers
party
pt
and
reformed
by
the
government
of
michel
temer
gives
the
state
a
share
of
income
it
has
proved
successful
in
recent
auctions
luring
oil
majors

exxon

asked
about
the
potential
shift
during
an
event
in
rio
de
janeiro
on
thursday
marcio
felix
the
minister
for
mines
and
energy
said
the
best
solution
was
to
make
a
relatively
simple
adjustment
to
a
law
that
mandates
all
blocks
must
be
tendered
with
contracts
nonetheless
felix
said
he
suggested
to
the
incoming
administration
that
any
changes
should
take
place
after
once
key
auctions
have
taken
place
he
said
his
main
concern
was
that
congressional
talks
would
snarl
and
pause
the
current
round
of
tenders
which
have
been
successful
in
attracting
investment
if
we
get
into
that
discussion
in
congress
for
example
we
run
the
risk
of
paralyzing
auctions
and
that
s
what
we
do
not
want
the
risks
need
to
be
well
measured

higher
oil
prices
and
the
need
to
replace
shrinking
reserves
have
boosted
oil
majors
appetites
for
costlier
offshore
ventures
pumping
money
into
the

s
coffers
last
month
newspaper

reported
bolsonaro
s
team
was
planning
to
tweak
the
model
to
attack
some
of
the
political
abuses
perpetrated
by
previous
administrations
petrobras
was
at
the
center
of
an
investigation
dubbed
car
wash
that
uncovered
a
massive
and
corruption
scheme
the
government
found
that
political
parties
and
politically
appointed
executives
took
over
billion
reais
billion
in
bribes
mainly
from
construction
and
engineering
firms
in

for
winning
contracts
