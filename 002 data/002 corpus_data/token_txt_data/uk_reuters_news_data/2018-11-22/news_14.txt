reuters
russian

remain
committed
to
planned
stock
market
listings
in
sources
and
bankers
say
despite
the
country
s
worst
year
for
equity
sales
in
a
decade
at
least
russian
companies
ranging
from
petrochemicals
giants
to
real

health
businesses

been
lining
up
at
least

worth
of
initial
public
offerings
ipos
this
year
in
moscow
and
in
some
cases
london

none
have
come
to
pass

will
be
the
first
year
