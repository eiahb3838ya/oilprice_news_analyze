russia
s
ztz
said
on
thursday
it
had
won
a
contract
to
sell
half
a
million
tonnes
of
pipes
to
gas
giant
gazprom
next
year
for
the
construction
of
part
of
the
power
of
siberia
pipeline
gazprom
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
confirmation
of
the
contract
which
ztz
said
was
worth
over
billion
roubles
million
gazprom
is
obliged
to
hold
tenders
for
such
contracts
but
news
that
the
contract
had
already
gone
to
ztz
which
only
entered
the
market
three
years
ago
came
as
a
surprise
to
other
producers
who
frequently
take
part
in
such
tenders
other
pipe
producers
were
not
aware
that
the
contract
had
been
offered
two
sources
in
the
industry
said
official
documents
show
that
gazprom
filed
a
notice
on
russia
s
official
procurement
website
on
to
hold
a
tender
to
buy
tonnes
of
pipes
and
that
the
tender
closed
within
hours
it
was
the
second
time
gazprom
had
held
a
tender
for
this
project
its
first
attempt
fell
through
in
october
after
all
major
domestic
pipemakers
refused
to
take
part
with
sources
in
the
sector
saying
gazprom
had
set
the
price
too
low
ztz
is
a
relatively
new
company
it
began
producing
pipes
in
december
and
its
arrival
on
the
scene
has
shaken
up
a
market
traditionally
controlled
by
four
producers
steelmakers
omk
and
severstal
plus
specialist
pipemakers
chelpipe
and
tmk
sources
told
reuters
in
february
that
gazprom
was
seeking
discounts
put
by
the
sources
at
percent
in
an
attempt
to
limit
its
investment
spending
which
is
due
to
peak
in
the
next
two
years
it
is
specifically
our
appearance
on
the
large
diameter
pipe
market
that
has
permitted
a
total
transformation
of
the
skewed
pipe
price
for
gazprom
ztz
chief
executive
denis
safin
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
prices
rose
between
and
but
after
we
launched
prices
for
large
diameter
pipes
have
fallen
by
over
percent
for
the
gas
company
gazprom
safin
said
ztz
s
total
plant
capacity
is
tonnes
of
pipes
a
year
roubles
