asian
shares
stepped
ahead
cautiously
on
thursday
while
oil
rebounded
from
a
steep
though
rising
interest
rates
and
escalating
trade
tensions
kept
financial
markets
on
edge
amid
signs
of
slackening
global
growth
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
tacked
on
percent
and
has
so
far
managed
to
hold
up
in
november
after
three
straight
monthly
declines
for
the
year
it
is
on
track
for
its
worst
annual
performance
since
in
part
due
to
anxiety
over
a
weakening
outlook

corporate

while

up
its

to

flat
ahead
of
the
thanksgiving
holiday
in
a
sign
of
lingering
bearishness
markets
experienced
a
better
night
last
night
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
sentiment
remains
fragile
anz
analysts
said
in
a
note
to
clients
there
seems
a
greater
appreciation
that
with
the
impact
of
fiscal
stimulus
waning
the
economy
could
slow
like
other
major
economies
the
unemployment
rate
is
at
a
low
and
the
economy
is
expanding
at
a
percent
annual
rate
although
many
economists
now
believe
a
ballooning
federal
budget
deficit
and
trade
protectionism
could
hurt
growth
by
that
leaves
the
market
less
forgiving
of
poor
news
whether
that
is
on
the
trade
front
or
in
credit
markets
the
bottom
line
expect
this
higher
volatility
picture
to
persist
unless
global
growth
can
stage
a
turnaround
anz
analysts
said
the
synchronised
global
expansion
that
began
roughly
two
years
ago
has
now
plateued
and
fresh
signs
are
emerging
of
a
weaker
outlook
global
trade
volumes
are
still
increasing
although
at
a
slower
pace
moreover
leading
economic
indicators
monitored
by
the
oecd
have
weakened
since
the
start
of
the
year
and
point
to
slower
expansion
ahead
for
the
united
kingdom
and
the
euro
area
as
a
whole
currency
the
federal
reserve
has
stayed
on
its
tightening
path
after
ending
seven
years
of
interest
rates
in
december
that
took
the
fed
funds
rate
to
the
current
to
percent
investors
expect
the
fed
to
go
again
in
december
in
response
to
the
tightening
the
dollar
has
outperformed
most
of
its
peers
this
year
with
its
index
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
up
almost
percent
in
comparison
the
japanese
yen
is
flat
so
far
in
marios
hadjikyriacos
analyst
at
broking
firm
said
the
greenback
is
currently
an
all
wealther
it
can
shine
both
in
sessions
given
its
status
as
the
world
s
reserve
asset
and
on
days
as
wide
yield
differentials
brighten
its
carry
appeal
he
said
hadjikyriacos
expects
the
dollar
to
end
the
year
on
a
high
note
the
dollar
seems
more
attractive
from
a
perspective
as
the
bar
to
price
out
even
more
hikes
and
hence
weaken
the
currency
is
probably
quite
high
it
may
require
concrete
evidence
of
a
us
the
dollar
index
was
last
flat
at
the
yen
was
barely
changed
at
following
two
straight
sessions
of
losses
elsewhere
the
euro
rose
on
hopes
that
the
italian
budget
dispute
would
be
resolved
even
as
the
european
commission
took
its
first
step
toward
disciplining
italy
over
its
deficit
