alberta
is
willing
to
buy
trains
itself
to
help
clear
a
backlog
of
crude
oil
if
ottawa
decides
not
to
back
the
canadian
province
s
proposal
to
split
the
costs
of
new
rail
cars
premier
rachel
notley
said
on
thursday
notley
said
alberta
had
asked
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
government
to
help
pay
for
additional
rail
capacity
to
move
an
additional
to
barrels
per
day
notley
said
alberta
had
not
received
an
answer
from
ottawa
full
pipelines
have
stranded
much
of
western
canada
s
expanding
crude
output
driving
down
the
price
refineries
are
willing
to
pay
ottawa
needs
to
join
alberta
to
help
ease
the
economic
pain
notley
told
oil
well
drillers
in
calgary
if
ottawa
won
t
come
to
the
table
then
we
ll
get
it
done
ourselves
if
it
takes
buying
trains
to
move
more
oil
to
market
then
that
s
what
we
re
going
to
reuters
reported
exclusively
late
on
wednesday
that
alberta
has
asked
ottawa
to
share
the
c
million
million
capital
cost
and
c
billion
in
operating
costs
over
three
years
of
buying
rail
capacity
to
move
more
crude
starting
in
july
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
say
federal
officials
are
cool
to
the
idea
suggesting
that
by
the
time
any
new
cars
came
on
line
the
worst
of
the
glut
should
be
over
trudeau
speaking
later
in
calgary
did
not
respond
directly
when
asked
about
alberta
s
proposal
he
said
oil
executives
were
focused
on
tax
breaks
and
adding
pipeline
capacity
there
are
many
things
that
are
beyond
our
control
here
he
told
reporters
citing
refinery
shutdowns
and
the
fact
canada
exports
almost
all
its
oil
to
the
united
states
this
is
very
much
a
crisis
he
added
trudeau
s
liberals
could
lose
alberta
seats
in
a
federal
election
set
for
october
if
voters
decide
he
did
not
do
enough
to
help
finance
minister
bill
morneau
also
showed
little
evident
enthusiasm
when
asked
by
reporters
about
notley
s
request
saying
that
s
a
discussion
that
might
go
forward
in
low
prices
are
costing
the
canadian
economy
c
million
a
day
according
to
alberta
companies
that
service
oil
producers
are
on
life
support
said
mark
scholz
president
of
the
canadian
association
of
oilwell
drilling
contractors
which
hosted
notley
s
speech
several
canadian
crude
producers
including
cenovus
energy
have
curtailed
production
and
asked
alberta
to
mandate
cuts
for
other
producers
notley
said
the
province
is
considering
several
options
to
improve
prices
mandated
production
is
opposed
by
producers
who
own
refineries
to
process
the
cheap
oil
such
as
suncor
energy
and
imperial
oil
the
premier
said
alberta
would
have
liked
greater
recognition
of
the
industry
s
struggles
in
the
federal
government
s
fiscal
update
which
morneau
delivered
on
wednesday
without
including
specific
new
measures
to
help
the
sector
a
spokesperson
for
canadian
national
railway
co
could
not
be
immediately
reached
canadian
pacific
railway
declined
to
comment
notley
said
alberta
has
six
projects
to
partially
upgrade
oil
worth
a
combined
c
billion
if
all
proceed
upgrading
reduces
the
thickness
of
bitumen
so
it
does
not
require
blending
with
lighter
oil
to
move
in
pipelines
freeing
up
space
canadian
dollars
