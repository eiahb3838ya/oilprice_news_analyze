india
is
working
to
establish
a
natural
gas
trading
exchange
its
prime
minister
narendra
modi
said
on
thursday
as
part
of
a
shift
away
from
a
reliance
on
crude
oil
based
products
which
are
blamed
for
much
of
the
country
s
pollution
problem
we
want
to
increase
the
use
of
natural
gas
by
times
by
the
end
of
next
decade
modi
said
in
new
delhi
at
the
laying
of
a
foundation
stone
for
the
setting
up
of
city
gas
distribution
cgd
networks
in
districts
which
have
been
auctioned
india
wants
to
develop
a
transparent
market
for
natural
gas
where
the
price
is
determined
on
an
exchange
and
aims
to
increase
the
use
of
natural
gas
in
india
s
total
energy
mix
from
percent
to
percent
between
and
the
price
of
making
the
switch
has
not
been
disclosed
but
analysts
have
often
pointed
out
that
using
natural
gas
to
fuel
vehicles
and
households
is
cheaper
than
lpg
and
cleaner
than
petrol
or
diesel
which
are
causing
pollution
in
india
however
it
is
still
hard
to
persuade
people
to
switch
to
piped
gas
as
lpg
cylinders
are
well
entrenched
in
india
and
the
refuelling
infrastructure
for
natural
gas
is
minimal
as
well
as
uncertainty
about
the
cost
there
are
also
concerns
about
the
length
of
time
needed
to
install
the
infrastructure
which
is
expected
to
take
two
to
three
years
modi
said
india
had
begun
the
bidding
process
for
a
tenth
round
of
cgd
which
will
mean
districts
or
percent
of
the
country
s
population
is
covered
in
the
next
two
to
three
years
he
said
india
is
spending
billion
rupees
billion
to
set
up
a
pipeline
that
will
connect
eastern
india
where
there
is
latent
gas
demand
which
has
not
been
tapped
because
of
a
lack
of
infrastructure
the
pipeline
network
along
with
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminals
being
set
up
in
the
east
coast
and
a
cgd
network
are
expected
to
help
boost
gas
consumption
