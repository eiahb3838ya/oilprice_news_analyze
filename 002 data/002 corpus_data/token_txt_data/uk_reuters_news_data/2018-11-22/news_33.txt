some
analysts
have
warned
that
despite
high
global
production
oil
markets
have
little
spare
capacity
to
handle
unforeseen
supply
disruptions
however
innes
said
that
once
pipeline
bottlenecks
were
alleviated
which
he
said
he
expected
in
the
entire
notion
of
a
tight
global

argument

opec
is
considering
supply
cuts
when
it
next
meets
on
although
some
members
like
iran
are
expected
to
resist
any
voluntary
reductions
while
there
is
talk
that
russia
may
again
agree
to
a
production
cut
the
concern
is
that
not
all

will
be
able

an
agreement

saudi
arabia
has
hinted
at
a
unilateral

but
it
will
want
to
be
careful
about
annoying
the
given
that
president
trump
has
been
vocal
about
his
desire
for
lower
oil
prices
he
added
president
donald

on

praised
saudi
arabia
over
recent
oil
prices
and
called
for
prices
to
go
even
lower
oil
prices
getting

great
like
a
