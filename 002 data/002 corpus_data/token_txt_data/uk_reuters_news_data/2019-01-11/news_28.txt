soothing
sounds
from
the
world
s
top
central
banks
helped
stocks
maintain
their
strong
start
to
the
year
on
friday
while
another
leap
from
china
s
yuan
capped
its
best
week
since
being
cut
loose
from
the
dollar
in
with
more
promises
of
patience
from
federal
reserve
the
ecb
mulling
another
dump
of
cheap
money
and
news
that
trade
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
are
moving
to
higher
levels
the
friday
feeling
was
in
full
effect
asia
had
crawled
to
a
high
overnight
thanks
to
china
and
japan
and
european
stocks
were
up
for
what
could
be
the
fourth
straight
day
of
gains
and
longest
winning
streak
since
september
the
fed
s
dovish
stance
also
pushed
down
the
dollar
and
nudged
treasury
yields
lower
after
five
days
of
gains
again
that
cheered
emerging
markets
and
confidence
more
generally
having
been
flattened
during
the
brutal
end
to
equities
are
having
a
good
run
after
a
pretty
horrible
end
to
last
year
said
rabobank
quantitative
analyst
bas
van
geffen
it
is
the
changing
wording
of
the
fed
it
seems
to
be
making
more
and
more
room
for
an
eventual
pause
in
the
rate
hike
cycle
the
index
of
europe
s
leading
shares
was
up
percent
in
early
trade
at
points
its
highest
in
almost
a
month
germany
s
dax
was
up
percent
and
france
s
cac
was
up
percent
at
points
the
big
gainer
among
europe
s
leading
indices
was
britain
s
ftse
up
percent
at
points
on
the
back
of
the
latest
slide
in
sterling
against
the
euro
on
mounting
brexit
uncertainty
wall
street
s
strong
performance
on
thursday
was
another
positive
driver
the
s
p
is
now
up
more
than
percent
from
its
low
and
futures
point
to
another
rise
at
the
open
on
friday
at
the
economic
club
of
washington
on
thursday
fed
chief
jerome
powell
reiterated
the
central
bank
would
be
patient
about
hiking
interest
rates
the
word
patient
is
used
often
when
the
fed
s
policy
direction
is
still
tightening
but
its
next
rate
hike
can
wait
for
a
considerable
time
so
risk
assets
now
enjoy
support
from
what
we
can
call
powell
put
said
tomoaki
shishido
economist
at
nomura
securities
similarly
trump
also
softened
his
stance
on
china
after
sharp
falls
in
stock
prices
he
has
offered
an
olive
branch
to
china
and
there
s
no
reason
china
would
not
want
to
accept
it
he
added
and
chinese
officials
are
working
on
arrangements
for
trade
talks
after
officials
this
week
discussed
demands
that
would
require
structural
change
in
china
to
address
issues
such
as
ip
theft
forced
technology
transfers
and
other
barriers
treasury

steven
mnuchin
said
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
most
likely
visit
washington
later
in
january
for
trade
talks
too
in
the
foreign
exchange
markets
the
dollar
was
on
course
for
its
fourth
straight
weekly
fall
against
other
top
world
currencies
having
also
hit
a
low
the
previous
day
the
flip
side
was
that
the
japanese
yen
was
a
shade
higher
again
at
per
dollar
and
the
euro
was
up
at
on
course
for
its
best
week
since
august
it
is
china
s
yuan
that
has
been
the
real
mover
though
against
the
backdrop
of
the
sensitive
trade
negotiations
the
chinese
currency
has
risen

this
week
which
is
its
biggest
gain
