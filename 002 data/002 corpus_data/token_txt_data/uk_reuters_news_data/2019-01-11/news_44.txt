jerome
powell
reiterated
the
central
bank
can
be
patient
on
raising
interest
rates
further
but
the
rally
s
momentum
slowed
partly
as
investors
sought
more
clarity
on
whether
the
united
states
and
china
could
make
headway
on
their
talks
on

as

extended
its

into
a
fifth
straight
day
on

in
a
whipsaw
trading
session
as

responded
to

by

at
the
economic
club
of

reiterated
the
views
of
other
policymakers
that
the

would
be
patient
about
interest
rate
hikes
major
stock
indexes
also
quickly
recovered
from
brief
losses
after
powell
said
that
the
fed
s
balance
sheet
would
be
substantially
smaller
the
word
patient
is
used
often
when
the
fed
s
policy
direction
is
still
tightening
but
its
next
rate
hike
can
wait
for
a
considerable
time
so

can
call

put

softened
his

falls
in

has
offered
an
olive

there

no
reason
china
would
not
want
to
accept
it
he
said
and
chinese
officials
are
working
on
arrangements
for
trade
talks
after
officials
this
week
discussed
demands
on

require

as
