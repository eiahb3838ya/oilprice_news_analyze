wrapup 2-cheaper gasoline weighs on u.s. consumer prices in december
washington
reuters
consumer
prices
fell
for
the
first
time
in
nine
months
in
december
amid
a
plunge
in
gasoline
prices
but
underlying
inflation
pressures
remained
firm
as
rental
housing
and
healthcare
costs
rose
steadily
overall
the
report
from
the
labor
department
on
friday
painted
a
picture
of
inflation
that
was
under
control
with
increases
in
some
categories
offset
by
declines
elsewhere
this
likely
supports
recent
statements
by
federal
reserve
officials
pledging
patience
in
raising
interest
rates
this
year
the
fed
will
take
this
as
further
proof
that
price
pressures
are
building
more
slowly
than
some
have
feared
based
on
the
strong
growth
of
late
and
tight
labor
market
said
james
mccann
senior
global
economist
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
in
boston
it
certainly
seems
to
justify
the
fed
s
message
about
being
more
patient
on
rate
the
consumer
price
index
dipped
percent
last
month
the
first
drop
and
weakest
reading
since
march
after
being
unchanged
in
november
in
the
months
through
december
the
cpi
rose
percent
slowing
from
november
s
percent
gain
excluding
the
volatile
food
and
energy
components
the
cpi
increased
percent
advancing
by
the
same
margin
for
a
third
straight
month
in
the
months
through
december
the
core
cpi
rose
percent
matching
november
s
increase
december
s
inflation
readings
were
in
line
with
economists
expectations
the
cpi
rose
percent
in
slowing
from
a
percent
increase
in
but
the
core
cpi
jumped
percent
up
from
percent
in
the
fed
which
has
a
percent
inflation
target
tracks
a
different
measure
the
core
personal
consumption
expenditures
pce
price
index
for
monetary
policy
the
core
pce
price
index
increased
percent
in
november
after
rising
percent
in
october
it
hit
percent
in
march
for
the
first
time
since
april
the
central
bank
has
forecast
two
interest
rate
hikes
this
year
but
several
policymakers
including
chairman
jerome
powell
have
said
they
would
be
cautious
about
tightening
monetary
policy
powell
reiterated
that
view
on
thursday
saying
especially
with
inflation
low
and
under
control
we
have
the
ability
to
be
patient
and
watch
patiently
and
carefully
while
the
central
bank
monitored
economic
data
and
financial
markets
for
risks
to
growth
minutes
of
the
central
bank
s
policy
meeting
published
on
wednesday
showed
many
officials
were
of
the
view
that
the
fed
could
afford
to
be
patient
about
further
policy
but
with
core
inflation
remaining
firm
despite
a
strong
dollar
and
slowing
global
growth
economists
say
further
rate
increases
this
year
can
not
be
ruled
out
in
addition
a
tighter
labor
market
is
boosting
wage
growth
if
core
inflation
holds
firm
the
fed
will
continue
to
consider
additional
rate
hikes
this
year
said
sam
bullard
a
senior
economist
at
wells
fargo
securities
in
charlotte
north
carolina
the
fed
lifted
borrowing
costs
four
times
in
the
dollar
was
little
changed
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
treasury
prices
rose
stocks
on
wall
street
were
trading
lower
after
a
rally
low
inflation
is
boosting
households
purchasing
power
which
could
keep
consumer
spending
supported
while
the
economy
likely
posted
strong
growth
in
the
fourth
quarter
an
ongoing
partial
shutdown
of
the
federal
government
is
casting
a
cloud
on
the
economy
the
partial
closure
started
on
as
president
donald
trump
demanded
that
the
congress
give
him
billion
this
year
to
help
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
according
to
jpmorgan
the
shutdown
which
has
left
employees
furloughed
or
working
without
pay
and
delayed
the
release
of

from
the

weekly

july
from

last

gasoline

the
largest
decrease
since
february
after
tumbling

but
americans

that
was
the

since

and
followed
