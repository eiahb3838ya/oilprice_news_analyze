oil
prices
edged
down
on
friday
as
concerns
over
economic
growth
were
rekindled
after
talks
fell
short
of
offering
concrete
steps
to
end
the
trade
conflict
although
production
cuts
bolstered
sentiment
in
crude
markets
oil
prices
were
also
supported
by
comments
from
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
on
thursday
that
the
central
bank
had
the
ability
to
be
patient
on
monetary
policy

crude
futures
had
slipped
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
settlement
to
per
barrel
by
gmt
however
crude
was
on
track
for
a
second
consecutive
week
of
gains
and
its
largest
weekly
percentage
increase
in
more
than
two
years
wti

this

its

china
said
three
days
of
talks
with
the
united
states
that
wrapped
up
on
wednesday
had
established
a
foundation
to
resolve
differences
over
trade
but
it
gave
few
details
on
key
issues
at
stake
including
a
scheduled
tariff
increase
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
a
partial
government
shutdown
and
tepid
economic
data
in
some
countries
also
dragged
on
broad
financial
markets
the
government
shutdown
and
weak
retail
sales
figures
around
the
world
reinvigorated
concerns
about
economic
growth
analysts
at
anz
bank
said
in
a
note
on
friday
china
s
producer
prices
in
december
rose
at
their
slowest
pace
in
more
than
two
years
a
worrying
sign
of
deflationary
risks
that
could
see
beijing
roll
out
more
policy
support
to
help
stabilise
the
economy
however
investors
are
becoming
increasingly
confident
that
production
cuts
will
balance
the
market
anz
said
saudi
arabia
said
earlier
this
week
that
supply
curbs
started
in
late
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
producers
including
russia
would
bring
the
oil
market
into
balance
saudi
is
turning
the
screws
on
export
supply
in
order
to
the
market
in
their
favour
prices
are
maintaining
highs
which
suggests
that
the
recent
bullish
move
is
not
yet
over
said
jonathan
barratt
chief
investment
officer
at
probis
securities
in
sydney
we
expect
more
bullish
rhetoric
from
opec
especially
from
saudi
arabia
to
help
shore
up
the
prices
producers
will
just
enjoy
the
the
likelihood
of
supply
curbs
elsewhere
also
helped
buoy
oil
markets
norway
s
oil
industry
regulator
said
the
country
s
crude
output
in
would
be
smaller
than
previously
forecast
and
at
its
lowest
level
in
three
decades
meanwhile
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
thursday
sanctions
against
his
country
were
fully
illegal
and
tehran
would
not
comply
with
them
