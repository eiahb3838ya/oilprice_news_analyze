order
to

who
are
facing
corruption
charges
over
accusations
they
bribed
officials
at

firm
petroleo
brasileiro
brazilian
federal
prosecutors
on
friday
demanded
in
a
court
filing
that
the
firm
preserve
the
emails
they
may
contain
evidence
that
other
top
executives
at
trafigura
were

of
dollars
in
bribes
paid
to
petrobras
executives
for
sweetheart
oil
contracts
the
prosecutors
say
trafigura
declined
to
comment
pointing
to
a
prior
statement
about
the
case
in
which
it
said
it
takes
the
accusations
seriously
the
case
is
part
of
brazil
s
car
wash
probe
that
has
revealed
stunning
political
graft
at
petrobras
brought
down
presidents
and
politicians
and
sent
scores
of
businessmen
to
jail
now
prosecutors
are
aiming
for
their
biggest
targets
yet
multinational
firms
who
have
done
business
with
petrobras
in
the
past
two
decades
brazilian
prosecutors
allege
corruption
took
place
on
soil
and
money
was
laundered
through
american
and
european
banks
which
could
greatly
widen
the
probe
aside
from
trafigura
other
powerhouse
commodity
traders
like
vitol
sa
glencore
plc
and
mercuria
energy
group
are
also
under
investigation
vitol
has
said
it
is
cooperating
with
brazilian
authorities
a
glencore
spokesman
said
the
firm
takes
ethics
and
compliance
seriously
and
that
it
is
cooperating
with
the
investigation
mercuria
has
denied
wrongdoing
petrobras
has
suspended
oil
and
fuel
trading
with
vitol
glencore
and
trafigura
trafigura
s
brazilian
attorneys
filed
documents
before
the
federal
court
saying
the
firm
was
likely
prohibited
by
the
european
union
s
general
data
protection
regulation
gdpr
from
handing
over
the
emails
of
former
executives
mariano
marcondes
ferraz
and
marcio
pinto
magalhaes
both
men
have
been
charged
for
bribing
petrobras
officials
which
they
have
denied
according
to
a
court
document
trafigura
limited
sent
a
letter
sent
to
its
brazilian
subsidiary
trafigura
do
brasil
in
which
it
wrote
that
it
had
been
advised
by
outside
counsel
that
it
would
have
to
carry
out
an
extensive
examination
of
its
responsibilities
under
the
gdpr
in
several
jurisdictions
and
also
examine
what
individual
country
laws
state
about
data
privacy
trafigura
questioned
the
brazilian
judge
s
demand
that
the
emails
be
handed
over
writing
that
it
remains
unclear
whether
the
request
in
respect
of
mariano
marcondes
ferraz
is
indeed
within
the
scope
of
the
decision
made
by
the
judicial
it
argued
in
its
court
filing
that
it
could
potentially
face
a
fine
of
percent
of
its
global
revenues
well
over
billion
if
it
is
found
in
breach
of
the
eu
data
laws
brazilian
federal
prosecutors
declined
to
comment
beyond
the
friday
court
filing
demanding
the
email
archives
not
be
destroyed
prosecutors
have
accused
the
european
multinationals
and
some
smaller
players
of
collectively
paying
at
least
million
in
bribes
over
a
period
to
employees
at
petrobras
to
sell
them
oil
at
favourable
prices
they
have
repeatedly
said
the
firms
top
brass
had
total
and
unequivocal
knowledge
that
they
were
fleecing
petrobras
and
that
the
illicit
activity
may
still
be
going
on
more
than
pages
of
legal
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
portray
what
prosecutors
describe
as
a
bustling
criminal
enterprise
fuelled
by
competition
and
greed
authorities
say
the
trading
companies
often
used
freelance
middlemen
to
cover
their
tracks
allowing
them
to
negotiate
deals
and
pay
off
petrobras
collaborators
using
bank
accounts
in
several
countries
earlier
this
week
the
brazilian
court
overseeing
the
investigations
against
the
commodity
traders
disclosed
that
one
such
alleged
middleman
had
been
arrested
in
miami
on
the
request
of
the
brazilian
judge
