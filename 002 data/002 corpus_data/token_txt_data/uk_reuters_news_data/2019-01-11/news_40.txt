asian
stocks
inched
up
to
highs
on
friday
after
chairman
jerome
powell
reiterated
the
federal
reserve
will
be
patient
about
raising
interest
rates
and
news
that
trade
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
are
moving
to
higher
levels
as
the
fed
s
dovish
stance
kept
a
lid
on
the
dollar
china
s
yuan
rose
to
its
highest
levels
in
more
than
five
months
and
was
on
course
for
its
biggest
weekly
gains
since
the
revaluation
in
onshore
trade
msci

wall
street
extended
its
rally
into
a
fifth
straight
day
on
thursday
in
a
whipsaw
trading
session
as
investors
responded
to
mixed
comments
by
powell
while
a
warning
from
macy
s
pummelled
retail
stocks
at
the
economic
club
of
washington
powell
reiterated
the
views
of
other
policymakers
that
the
fed
would
be
patient
about
interest
rate
hikes
major
stock
indexes
also
quickly
recovered
from
brief
losses
after
powell
said
that
the
fed
s
balance
sheet
would
be
substantially
smaller
the
word
patient
is
used
often
when
the
fed
s
policy
direction
is
still
tightening
but
its
next
rate
hike
can
wait
for
a
considerable
time
so
risk
assets
now
enjoy
support
from
what
we
can
call
powell
put
said
tomoaki
shishido
economist
at
nomura
securities
similarly
trump
also
softened
his
stance
on
china
after
sharp
falls
in
stock
prices
he
has
offered
an
olive
branch
to
china
and
there
s
no
reason
china
would
not
want
to
accept
it
he
said
and
chinese
officials
are
working
on
arrangements
for
trade
talks
after
officials
this
week
discussed
demands
that
would
require
structural
change
in
china
to
address
issues
such
as
ip
theft
forced
technology
transfers
and
other
barriers
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
late
on
thursday
that
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
most
likely
visit
washington
later
in
january
for
trade
talks
for
markets
the
upshot
is
that
the
outlook
for
is
looking
better
as
tensions
creating
the
potential
for
a
of
risk
assets
as
the
tail
risk
of
a
trade
war
is
partially
priced
out
said
jeremy
lawson
chief
economist
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
in
edinburgh
this
is
especially
the
case
in
asia
he
added
still
fundamental
tensions
between
the
and
china
are
unlikely
to
go
away
and
there
is
a
high
likelihood
that
any
agreement
to
suspend
tariffs
eventually
breaks
down
when
it
becomes
clear
that
trump
s
objectives
can
not
really
be
some
investors
are
also
increasingly
wary
of
lingering
disputes
in
washington
over
a
wall
trump
wants
on
the
border
which
has
led
to
a
partial
government
shutdown
flanked
by
border
agents
who
are
going
without
paychecks
during
the
shutdown
trump
again
threatened
on
thursday
to
declare
a
national
emergency
to
bypass
congress
to
fund
a
wall
in
the
foreign

the

was
broadly
soft

a
small

the

both

by
a
