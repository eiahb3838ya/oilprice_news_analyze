iran
will
see
its
crude
exports
severely
curtailed
for
a
third
month
in
january
as
it
is
struggling
to
find
new
buyers
amid
fresh
sanctions
even
though
its
traditional
customers
secured
waivers
according
to
tanker
data
and
industry
sources
iran
s
crude
exports
in
november
plummeted
to
below
million
barrels
per
day
from
regular
sales
of
million
bpd
before
sanctions
were
imposed
in
may
and
taking
them
back
to
where
they
stood
during
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
in
buyers
said
plunging
exports
in
november
which
will
severely
hit
the
islamic
republic
s
budget
revenues
were
caused
by
a
total
lack
of
clarity
of
what
volumes
they
were
allowed
to
purchase
under
the
new
sanctions
washington
later
gave
a
fairly
generous
set
of
waivers
to
eight
traditional
iranian
oil
buyers
including
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
to
avoid
a
rally
in
oil
prices
but
the
measure
has
failed
to
give
a
meaningful
boost
to
exports
according
to
tanker
data
and
industry
sources
iran
s
crude
shipments
remained
below
million
bpd
in
december
and
are
unlikely
to
exceed
that
level
in
january
despite
rising
in
january
i
expect
a
slight
uptick
in
the
second
half
of
the
month
with
some
asian
lifting
resuming
one
of
the
sources
said
for
the
time
being
i
am
pencilling
in
around
bpd
for
regular
buyer
taiwan
said
last
year
it
was
not
yet
buying
iranian
oil
despite
receiving
a
waiver
because
of
a
lack
of
a
clear
payment
mechanism
iran
has
said
its
exports
have
not
declined
as
much
as
estimated
by
the
industry
because
it
was
selling
oil
to
new
buyers
but
it
declined
to
disclose
them
because
of
a
fear
of
new
sanctions
a
restrained
level
of
iranian
shipments
would
assist
the
new
global
push
to
cut
oil
supply
in
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
from
which
iran
is
exempt
and
lend
support
to
oil
prices
we
are
forecasting
slightly
more
than
december
but
not
massive
said
a
source
at
another
company
that
monitors
iranian
shipments
putting
the
rise
at
below
bpd
iranian
exports
are
higher
if
condensate
a
type
of
light
oil
is
counted
as
well
as
crude
kpler
another
company
that
tracks
oil
flows
put
iranian
crude
and
condensate
exports
at
million
bpd
in
december
tracking
iranian
exports
has
become
harder
since
the
sanctions
began
as
ships
switch
off
tracking
systems
industry
sources
say
keeping
some
of
the
shipments
hidden
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
shipments
including
condensate
plunged
to
about
bpd
in
december
although
such
figures
are
probably
not
counting
all
the
tankers
that
switch
off
their
ais
tracking
signal
some
buyers
that
stayed
away
in
november
are
returning
turkey
has
resumed
imports
of
iranian
oil
after
a
hiatus
in
november
reuters
reported
on
tuesday
at
a
volume
less
than
half
of
the
amount
shipments
were
at
least
million
bpd
in
april
the
month
before
president
donald
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
from
a
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
reimposed
sanctions
tehran
has
vowed
to
keep
exporting
oil
despite
the
effort
to
reduce
its
shipments
to
zero
