soothing
words
from
the
world
s
top
central
banks
helped
stocks
consolidate
a
strong
start
to
on
friday
while
china
s
yuan
capped
its
best
week
since
it
shed
its
dollar

in
stock
markets
were
lifted
by
more
promises
of
patience
from
the
federal
reserve
the
ecb
mulling
more
cheap
money
and
trade
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
moving

higher

asia
crawled
to

high
and
wall
street
futures
were
down
a
touch
but
european
stocks
clung
to
a
fourth
day
of
gains
and
their
longest
winning
streak
since
september
the
fed
s
dovish
stance
also
pushed
down
the
dollar
and
nudged
treasury
yields
lower
after
five
days
of

cheering
emerging

and
restoring

after
a

also
sparked
into

after
a

expect
a
brexit
delay
equities
are
having
a
good
run
after
a
pretty
horrible
end
to
last
year
it
is
the
changing
wording
of
the
fed
it
seems
to
be
making
more
and
more
room
for
an
eventual
pause
in
the
rate
hike
cycle
rabobank
quantitative
analyst
bas
van
geffen
said
the
index
of
europe
s
leading
shares
was
up
percent
at
points
having
hit
its
highest
in
almost
a
month
but
after
a
percent
jump
for
world
stocks
this
week
traders
were
beginning
to
book
some
profit
germany

wall
street
had
enjoyed
a
strong

on
thursday
the
s
p
is
now
up
more
than
percent
from
its
low
and
the
percent
dip
in
futures
will
be
barely
a
scratch
if
it
materialises
at
the
economic
club
of
washington
fed
chief
jerome
powell
reiterated
the
central
bank
would
be
patient
about
hiking
interest
rates
against
a
backdrop
of
the
longest
partial
government
shutdown
in
history
the
word
patient
is
used
often
when
the
fed
s
policy
direction
is
still
tightening
but
its
next
rate
hike
can
wait
for
a
considerable
time
so
risk
assets
now
enjoy
support
from
what
we
can
call
powell

no
reason
china
would
not
want
to
accept
it

added

officials
are
working
on
arrangements
for

such
as
