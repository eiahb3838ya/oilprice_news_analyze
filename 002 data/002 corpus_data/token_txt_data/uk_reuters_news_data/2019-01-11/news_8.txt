crisis
talks
between
india
s
jet
airways
ltd
and
aircraft
lessors
have
failed
to
ease
a
row
over
late
payments
prompting
some
lessors
to
explore
taking
back
aircraft
three
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
in
what
one
of
the
people
described
as
an
showdown
between
the
airline
and
some
of
the
world
s
leading
leasing
firms
jet
s
main
lender
state
bank
of
india
sought
to
provide
reassurance
that
india
s
biggest
carrier
is
doing
all
it
can
to
pay
its
staff
suppliers
and
creditors
jet
has
been
delinquent
for
many
months
nobody
wants
to
get
in
a
situation
where
the
problems
worsen
and
it
becomes
even
more
difficult
to
take
out
aircraft
one
of
the
people
said
jet
controls
over
a
sixth
of
a
market
experiencing
an
unprecedented
boom
in
air
travel
yet
high
fuel
taxes
a
weak
rupee
and
price
competition
have
squeezed
profitability
leaving
jet
with
billion
rupees
billion
in
net
debt
as
at
the
end
of
september
and
defaulting
on
payments
the
airline
had
previously
told
some
lessors
it
would
clear
arrears
by
but
was
unable
do
so
the
people
close
to
the
matter
said
for
an
interactive

on
india
aviation
market
click
at
meetings
on
tuesday
held
at
sbi
s
headquarters
in
mumbai
s
business
district
the
bank
s
chairman
rajnish
kumar
was
asked
how
jet
planned
to
raise
equity
or
debt
said
one
of
the
people
an
attendee
who
found
the
responses
lacked
sufficient
detail
other
attendees
included
jet
s
management
team
including
the
airline
s
founder
and
chairman
naresh
goyal
as
well
as
a
senior
adviser
of
etihad
airways
which
owns
percent
of
jet
and
which
did
not
provide
any
assurances
the
person
said
an
official
from
punjab
national
bank
later
said
lenders
have
agreed
to
extend
some
help
to
jet
but
details
on
the
mechanics
of
it
are
still
being
worked
out
some
lessors
have
engaged
with
lawyers
are
working
with
their
technical
teams
about
repossession
and
are
monitoring
the
planes
but
the
situation
could
be
complicated
by
a
new
bankruptcy
law
that
allows
up
to
days
where
no
action
is
permitted
against
the
debtor
or
its
assets
the
person
said
lessors
such
as
ge
capital

had
been
due
for
delivery
to
jet
the
person
said
a
second

been
behind

since
november

boc
aviation
ltd
and
aircastle

also
attended
the
meetings
along
with
gecas
and
smbc
one
of
the
people
said
declining
to
specify
which
are
considering
reclaiming
planes
jet
airways
in
a
statement
on
friday
said
the
airline
is
working
on
its
turnaround
strategy
and
updating
its
partners
in
real
time
on
efforts
taken
to
improve
its
liquidity
a
comprehensive
plan
that
will
ensure
business
sustainability
preserve
value
and
enable
the
company
to
honor
its
obligations
was
outlined
a
jet
spokesman
said
in
the
statement
adding
that
the
meeting
took
place
in
an
atmosphere
of
cordiality
and
mutual
appreciation
the
turnaround
plan
involves
creating
a
competitive
cost
structure
and
restructuring
the
balance
sheet
among
other
things
and
is
expected
to
deliver
a
positive
impact
on
the
financials
of
the
company
he
said
sbi
and
smbc
aviation
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
dae
aerospace
gecas
aircastle
and
jackson
square
did
not
respond
outside
of
regular
business
hours
etihad
boc
aviation
and
avolon
declined
to
comment
the
people
familiar
with
the
talks
were
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
on
the
matter
and
so
declined
to
be
identified
jet
controlled
by
goyal
has
turned
to
etihad
for
financial
help
however
the
abu
dhabi
airline
is
not
in
any
position
to
sink
new
equity
into
jet
at
this
juncture
said
a
person
familiar
with
etihad
s
position
etihad
posted
a
significant
loss
at
the
end
of
last
year
that
would
continue
into
according
to
an
internal
memo
seen
by
sources
on
thursday
the
memo
also
showed
pilots
would
lose
their
jobs
as
the
airline
cut
costs
jet
held
talks
with
indian
conglomerate
tata
sons
ltd
about
financial
aid
last
year
sources
told
reuters
that
goyal
ended
the
talks
because
tata
would
have
wanted
him
to
step
down
or
take
a
less
prominent
role
a
source
close
to
tata
on
thursday
said
there
had
been
no
recent
engagement
with
jet
and
doing
so
was
extremely
unlikely
because
tata
people
had
moved
on
internally
tata
sons
declined
to
comment
on
friday
after
the
disorderly
collapse
of
kingfisher
airlines
in
india
modified
rules
in
line
with
the
cape
town
convention
an
international
treaty
making
it
easier
for
foreign
owners
to
repossess
aircraft
when
airlines
default
on
payments
lessors
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
government
which
has
the
power
to
cancel
the
registration
of
a
plane
within
five
working
days
and
allow
lessors
to
repossess
it
subject
to
certain
conditions
including
unpaid
dues
on
the
aircraft
some
laws
conflict
with
full
implementation
of
the
convention
and
the
government
in
october
said
it
was
consulting
to
revise
those
laws
a
move
that
could
reduce
lease
rates
for
indian
carriers
nevertheless
the
ability
to
repossess
a
plane
can
be
a
more
complicated
process
in
india
than
in
some
other
countries
on
tuesday
jet
proposed
to
creditors
that
it
would
catch
up
with
debt
payments
in
arrears
as
of
september
and
from
april
meet
debt
payments
as
they
come
due
showed
a
document
seen
by
reuters
jet
s
debt
payments
will
be
large
over
the
next
few
years
starting
with
about
billion
rupees
due

firm
icra
