berlin
reuters
germany
will
try
to
protect
german
and
european
companies
from
some
potentially
massive
collateral
damage
if
washington
levies
further
sanctions
against
russia
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
on
friday
maas
speaking
on
friday
at
a
new
year
reception
of
the
german
committee
on
east
european
economic
relations
an
industry
group
said
he
expected
the
newly
elected
congress
to
move
swiftly
to
bring
new
sanctions
against
moscow
our
aim
is
to
reach
agreement
with
the
on
sanctions
and
protect
german
and
european
companies
from
the
in
some
cases
massive
collateral
damage
he
said
he
did
not
give
further
details
but
his
remarks
are
likely
to
cheer
german
exporters
hard
hit
by
european
union
and
sanctions
imposed
after
moscow
invaded
and
annexed
parts
of
ukraine
in
washington
has
led
the
way
in
demanding
tougher
measures
against
moscow
while
germany
which
has
deep
trade
ties
with
russia
and
depends
on
it
for
much
of
its
imported
gas
has
been
far
more
cautious
for
us
sanctions
only
make
sense
when
as
with
the
eu
s
sanctions
they
are
tied
to
clear
fulfillable
conditions
said
maas
in
an
apparent
softening
of
his
more
hawkish
tone
on
russia
when
he
took
office
last
year
sadly
that
is
no
longer
the
case
for
earlier
the
industry
group
s
chairman
wolfgang
buechele
had
criticized
the
sanctions
for
being
too
vague
and
unclear
for
german
exporters
to
adhere
to
pleading
for
german
government
backing
if
they
were
further
tightened
the
eu
last
month
extended
for
a
further
six
months
sanctions
targeting
russia
s
financial
energy
and
defense
sectors
they
were
originally
imposed
in
july
after
russia
s
annexation
of
ukraine
s
crimean
peninsula
the
expanded
its
sanctions
in
december
adding
members
of
russian
military
intelligence
and
four
entities
involved
in
alleged
election
interference
to
a
blacklist
that
allows
for
their
assets
to
be
frozen
the
new
democrat
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
incensed
by
allegations
of
collaboration
between
president
donald
trump
s
campaign
team
and
russian
lobbyists
is
preparing
congressional
hearings
on
trump
s
alleged
russia
ties
a
particular
focus
of
both
their
and
trump
s
ire
is
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
which
by
supplying
germany
with
russian
gas
directly
under
the
baltic
sea
will
cut
ukraine
out
of
lucrative
transit
fees
even
as
it
fends
off
a
insurrection
in
its
east
but
maas
said
he
had
told
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
that
sanctions
targeting
nord
stream
would
not
be
appropriate
russian
president
vladimir
putin
agreed
last
year
to
continue
gas
transit
through
ukraine
he
said
nord
stream
isn
t
germany
and
russia
going
it
alone
i
say
to
critics
of
the
project
questions
of
european
energy
policy
must
be
decided
in
europe
