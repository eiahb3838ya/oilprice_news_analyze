column-diesel futures point to economic slowdown in 2019: kemp
london
reuters
by
the
end
of
last
year
hedge
fund
positions
in
diesel
had
fallen
to
a
level
normally
associated
with
a
sharp
slowdown
in
economic
growth
if
not
an
outright
recession
most
middle
distillate
fuels
such
as
diesel
gasoil
and
jet
fuel
are
consumed
in
freight
transport
ships
trucks
railroads
and
air
cargo
as
well
as
manufacturing
and
mining
middle
distillate
consumption
and
prices
are
therefore
more
closely
tied
to
the
state
of
the
economy
than
other
refined
fuels
such
as
gasoline
chartbook
for
the
last
years
hedge
funds
and
other
speculators
collectively
termed
traders
have
mostly
held
a
net
long
or
bullish
position
in
distillate
futures
and
options
the
typical
net
long
position
reflects
the
overall
expansion
of
the
and
global
economies
expansions
have
been
long
while
recessions
have
been
relatively
short
in
most
cases
when
traders
have
switched
to
a
substantial
net
short
or
bearish
position
the
economy
has
been
experiencing
a
sharp
slowdown
or
is
already
in
recession
large
net
short
positions
in
and
were
all
associated
with
slowdowns
or
recessions
according
to
contemporary
statements
or
minutes
from
the
federal
reserve
s
open
market
committee
the
exception
was
the
net
short
position
at
the
end
of
which
came
six
months
after
the
fed
noted
a
soft
patch
in
the
expansion
by
which
time
the
economy
was
improving
enough
for
the
fed
to
raise
interest
rates
again
crucially
not
all
these
episodes
ended
in
a
recession
some
were
transient
slowdowns
in
an
uninterrupted
expansion
but
given
this
history
the
large
liquidation
of
speculative
long
positions
in
diesel
futures
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
was
consistent
with
a
substantial
deterioration
in
the
economic
outlook
traders
started
with
a
record
bullish
position
in
diesel
futures
equivalent
to
million
barrels
of
fuel
with
more
bullish
positions
held
in
options
and
european
derivatives
such
as
gasoil
at
the
start
of
the
fourth
quarter
they
still
held
a
very
large
net
long
position
equivalent
to
almost
million
barrels
suggesting
most
speculators
continued
to
anticipate
a
strong
economic
expansion
but
the
net
long
position
had
disappeared
by
the
end
of
november
and
turned
into
a
net
short
of
million
barrels
by
the
middle
of
december
coinciding
with
the
slump
in
equity
markets
and
fears
about
the
economic
outlook
unfortunately
there
is
no
more
recent
data
on
positions
because
of
the
partial
shutdown
of
the
federal
government
by
the
middle
of
december
the
net
short
position
was
not
yet
at
a
level
signalling
a
slowdown
or
recession
but
the
trend
was
clear
the
fall
in
diesel
positions
was
consistent
with
other
indicators
of
slackening
economic
activity
including
the
decline
in
equity
prices
yield
curve
inversion
business
surveys
and
slowing
freight
growth
at
the
end
of
the
distillate
market
like
other
financial
markets
and
the
economy
was
balanced
uncertainly
on
the
brink
of
a
slowdown
what
happens
next
depends
critically
on
whether
the
and
global
economies
accelerate
again
settle
into
an
extended
soft
patch
or
slump
into
recession
if
the
rate
of
economic
expansion
quickens
again
hedge
funds
and
other
speculators
will
close
some
of
their
short
positions
and
rebuild
a
significant
net
long
position
exerting
upward
pressure
on
diesel
and
crude
prices
the
process
may
already
have
started
in
recent
days
as
traders
become
more
optimistic
the
united
states
and
china
will
reach
an
agreement
or
at
least
a
truce
in
their
trade
war
but
if
the
economy
settles
into
a
more
sluggish
phase
or
stalls
and
slips
into
recession
further
hedge
fund
selling
will
put
renewed
downward
pressure
on
diesel
and
crude
