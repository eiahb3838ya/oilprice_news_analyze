any
attempts
by
the
united

stop
europe
buying

by
russian
state
gas
giant
gazprom
the
pipeline
which
would
carry
gas
straight
to
germany
under
the
baltic
sea
is
driving
a
wedge
between
germany
and
its
allies
as
it
would
deprive
ukraine
of
the
lucrative
gas
transit
fees
it
currently
enjoys
if
the
decided
to
sanction
the
use
of
russian
gas
that
would
be
an
attack
on

said
it
expected
trade
with
russia
to
stagnate
this
year
even
as

with
less
than
a
