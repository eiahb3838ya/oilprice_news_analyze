washington
reuters
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
will
outline
a
diplomatic
road
map
and
call
for
broad
support
from
european
and
other
allies
to
apply
pressure
on
iran
to
force
it
back
to
the
negotiating
table
a
senior
official
said
on
friday
as
washington
seeks
to
chart
a
course
after
it
pulled
out
of
a
landmark
nuclear
deal
rebuffing
appeals
from
france
germany
and
britain
president
donald
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
days
ago
from
the
nuclear
deal
between
iran
and
six
major
powers
and
ordered
that
sanctions
be
reimposed
on
tehran
in
his
first
foreign
policy
speech
on
monday
pompeo
will
call
for
broad
support
to
address
the
totality
of
iran
s
threats
said
brian
hook
senior
policy
advisor
hook
said
officials
hoped
economic
pressure
from
renewed
sanctions
would
lead
iran
back
to
the
table
as
it
did
a
few
years
ago
leading
to
the
nuclear
accord
but
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
the
europeans
would
support
the
plan
as
they
try
to
salvage
investment
and
trade
ties
with
tehran
that
followed
the
accord
hook
said
washington
was
seeking
a
diplomatic
outcome
with
iran
and
sanctions
were
part
of
that
the
goal
of
our
effort
is
to
bring
all
necessary
pressure
to
bear
on
iran
to
change
its
behaviour
and
to
pursue
a
new
framework
that
can
resolve
our
concerns
hook
told
reporters
we
very
much
want
to
be
to
have
a
kind
of
diplomacy
one
that
s
very
focussed
and
very
determined
to
achieve
our
national
security
objectives
he
said
adding
we
need
a
new
framework
that
s
going
to
address
the
totality
of
iran
a
senior
european
official
whose
country
is
party
to
the
deal
said
there
were
concerns
that
the
trump
administration
was
interested
in
pursuing
the
maximum
pressure
and
brutal
show
of
strength
idea
instead
of
negotiating
we
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
negotiating
method
but
if
they
are
purely
in
the
maximum
pressure
and
brutal
show
of
strength
idea
and
they
believe
it
will
work
because
they
believe
it
worked
with
north
korea
then
we
will
have
a
major
problem
the
official
said
the
threat
of
sanctions
has
already
forced
some
european
companies
to
pull
back
from
iran
german
lender
dz
bank
said
it
will
suspend
its
financial
transactions
with
iran
in
july
while
french
gas
and
power
group
engie
also
said
it
would
end
its
contracts
in
iran
by
november
this
week
the
treasury
imposed
sanctions
against
iranian
finance
officials
and
financiers
it
said
were
linked
to
hezbollah
hook
played
down
differences
between
the
united
states
and
europe
over
iran
we
have
a
period
of
opportunity
to
work
with
our
allies
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
new
security
architecture
a
new
framework
he
said
adding
i
think
people
are
overstating
the
disagreements
between
the
and
trump
said
the
agreement
did
not
adequately
curb
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
or
address
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
what
the
trump
administration
views
as
its
destabilising
role
in
the
region
under
the
agreement
tehran
agreed
to
limits
on
its
nuclear
programme
in
exchange
for
the
lifting
of
sanctions
against
it
iran
has
denied
it
sought
in
the
past
to
develop
an
atomic
weapon
saying
its
nuclear
programme
has
always
been
for
purely
peaceful
purposes
hook
said
the
iran
nuclear
accord
had
given
countries
a
false
sense
of
security
and
the
united
states
wanted
to
ensure
any
new
agreement
covered
not
only
iran
s
nuclear
and
missile
capabilities
but
also
curbed
its
regional
activities
this
involves
a
range
of
things
around
its
nuclear
programme
missiles
proliferating
missiles
and
missile
technology
and
support
for
terrorists
and
its
aggressive
and
violent
activities
that
fuel
civil
wars
in
syria
and
yemen
said
hook
in
recent
days
officials
have
highlighted
protests
in
iran
to
illustrate
economic
discontent
among
iranians
and
a
reason
iran
should
return
to
talks
at
least
one
person
was
killed
and
six
others
wounded
in
the
southern
city
of
kazeroon
according
to
the
fars
news
agency
on
thursday
iran
s
president
hassan
rouhani
has
assured
iranians
that
their
economy
can
withstand
new
sanctions
you
have
seen
the
protests
in
iran
and
people
have
publicly
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
with
a
lot
of
the
policies
of
the
regime
which
have
not
helped
the
iranian
people
said
hook
later
as
he
met
his
dutch
counterpart
at
the
state
department

also
tweeted
about
the
