algeria's islamist opposition urges national consensus on economic reform
algiers
reuters
algeria
must
build
a
national
consensus
to
undertake
deep
economic
reforms
and
end
its
dependency
on
volatile
gas
and
oil
revenues
the
new
leader
of
the
main
islamist
opposition
party
said
abderazak
makri
elected
last
week
as
the
new
head
of
the
islamist
msp
party
also
told
reuters
he
will
stand
in
the
presidential
election
in
april
if
the
government
does
not
bring
the
opposition
into
its
plans
for
taking
the
country
forward
president
abdelaziz
bouteflika
the
veteran
leader
in
power
since
has
not
declared
yet
whether
he
will
seek
a
fifth
term
though
the
ruling
fln
party
and
the
biggest
labour
union
have
asked
him
to
run
again
should
the
who
is
following
a
stroke
in
run
again
this
would
provide
stability
in
the
opec
oil
producer
giving
the
power
brokers
time
to
sort
out
a
smooth
transition
but
makri
said
the
oil
producer
had
no
time
to
lose
to
agree
on
economic
reforms
as
algeria
s
model
of
a
state
dominated
economic
dependent
on
oil
and
gas
revenues
no
longer
worked
a
government
needs
full
support
from
political
parties
unions
and
organizations
to
implement
difficult
reforms
this
is
why
we
need
a
consensus
makri
said
in
an
interview
if
we
do
not
reach
a
political
consensus
all
options
will
be
then
open
we
may
participate
we
may
boycott
he
said
islamist
parties
now
play
no
big
role
in
algeria
where
the
fln
has
dominated
since
independence
from
france
the
msp
won
only
percent
in
the
election
and
it
boycotted
the
presidential
elections
in
makri
said
rising
domestic
gas
consumption
eating
into
gas
exports
showed
that
the
algeria
need
to
diversify
its
economy
even
if
oil
prices
were
continuing
to
pick
up
oil
and
gas
revenues
have
halved
since
straining
a
welfare
state
used
to
discourage
dissent
algeria
has
responded
to
the
economic
crisis
by
reducing
imports
a
public
service
hire
freeze
and
postponing
some
projects
to
cope
with
the
crash
of
oil
prices
but
the
government
has
maintained
subsidies
of
key
products
such
as
milk
and
powerful
elites
have
resisted
opening
up
the
country
too
much
to
foreigners
the
government
needs
to
show
very
clearly
to
political
parties
that
it
will
accept
political
change
makri
said
many
ordinary
algerians
prefer
stability
after
the
civil
war
in
the
when
the
elite
overturned
an
election
which
islamists
were
poised
to
win
triggering
a
conflict
with
them
in
which
about
people
were
killed
makri
was
undeterred
by
the
apparent
modest
support
for
islamist
parties
pointing
to
tunisia
where
islamist
and
secular
forces
rule
together
tunisia
is
a
good
sample
when
elections
are
free
and
fair
the
winners
are
always
islamists
he
said
in
morocco
the
islamists
have
won
in
tunisia
they
have
won
and
they
would
have
won
in
algeria
if
there
had
been
