for

controlled

it
would

all

in
a
deal
valued
at

enbridge
said
it
would
buy
its
independent
units
including
spectra
energy
partners
and
enbridge
energy
partners
as
well
as
its
pipeline
assets
and
bring
then
under

cheniere
said
it
will
buy
out

holdings
for
about
billion
mlps
are
corporate
structures
that
pay
out
profit
to
investors
in
distributions
in
a
appeals
court
ruled
that
energy
regulators
were
allowing
these
companies
to
benefit
from
a
double
recovery
of
taxes
in
march
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
said
the
companies
largely
oil
and
natural
gas
pipeline
firms
will
no
longer
be
allowed
to
recover
an
income
tax
allowance
as
part
of
the
fees
they
charge
to
shippers
under
a
cost
of
service
rate
structure
i
would
expect
more
of
them
to
be
rolled
up
in
a
similar
fashion
if
the
reaction
to
enbridge
is
stronger
you
might
see
transcanada
do
the
same
thing
but
it
s
not
nearly
as
material
to
them
said
ryan
bushell
president
and
portfolio
manager
at
newhaven
asset
management
the
transaction
will
not
hurt
enbridge
s
financial
outlook
the
company
said
under
the
newly
changed
ferc
tax
policy
holding
certain
interstate
pipelines
in
mlp
structures
is
highly
unfavorable
to
unitholders
and
is
no
longer
advantageous
enbridge
said
the
company
which
has
been
trying
to
recast
itself
as
a
pipeline
utility
has
been
under
pressure
to
sell
assets
and
reduce
its
debt
of
more
than
billion
as
of
this
is
the
first
step
of
the
board
taking
control
and
taking
steps
to
put
the
company
in
good
standing
bushell
said
the
company
has
been
saddled
with
debt
following
its
billion
takeover
of
spectra
energy
last
year
earlier
this
month
it
sold
some
assets
worth
billion
rolling
up
spectra
will
allow
enbridge
to
mitigate
impact
from
the
tax
related
changes
by
percent
compared
with
a
zero
percent
benefit
if
assets
are
held
in
a
mlp
structure
