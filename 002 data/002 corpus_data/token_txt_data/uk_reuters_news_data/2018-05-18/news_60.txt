china
should
be
well
accustomed
to
trump
s
ways
by
now
judging
from
how
the
talks
are
proceeding
so
far
there
is
a
greater
chance
of
the
negotiations
ending
in
some
sort
of
a
compromise
instead
of
falling
through

such
an
outcome
would
bode
well

the

fallen
nearly

this

largely
pressured
by
italian
political
uncertainty
reports
this

that
italian
populist
parties
likely
to
form
the

next
government
may
ask
the
european
central
bank
for
debt
forgiveness
have
raised

a
retreat
by

prompted
the

to
tighten
monetary
policy
on
thursday
for
the
first
time
since

support
the

perhaps
the
most
unnerving
aspect
of
the
recent

weakness
has
been
the
sheer

in
which
the

markets
have
turned
against
