feature-global plan powers up to supply clean energy for refugees

thomson
reuters
foundation
aid
agencies
and
governments
are
transforming
the
way
they
provide
energy
to
families
forced
to
flee
their
homes
around
the
world
from
setting
up
solar
power
plants
at
camps
for
syrians
in
jordan
to
funding
a
small
solar
panel
for
a
malian
refugee
to
run
a
fridge
for
her
water
shop
in
burkina
faso
energy
has
always
been
needed
in
the
camps
and
informal
settlements
home
to
tens
of
millions
of
people
uprooted
by
conflicts
or
natural
disasters
but
it
has
largely
been
in
the
form
of
polluting
diesel
generators
fossil
fuels
for
trucks
to
move
relief
supplies
or
locally
harvested
firewood
for
cooking
that
is
changing
with
agencies
aid
groups
major
countries
and
businesses
preparing
in
july
to
sign
up
to
a
global
action
plan
to
provide
all
displaced
people
with
access
to
sustainable
energy
by
in
line
with
development
goals
people
are
beginning
to
realise
that
this
is
an
important
issue
and
something
that
deserves
priority
resources
and
attention
said
owen
grafham
from
the
moving
energy
initiative
mei
a
partnership
managed
by
think
tank
chatham
house
which
is
working
on
the
action
plan
in
camps
about
percent
of
people
lack
electricity
while
percent
rely
on
firewood
and
other
solid
fuels
to
cook
which
are
harmful
to
their
health
and
local
forests
according
to
mei
electric
power
has
not
been
regarded
as
a
human
right
in
emergency
situations
unlike
shelter
water
food
or
healthcare
said
andrew
harper
of
the
refugee
agency
unhcr
energy
is
really
not
something
that
is
fully
taken
into
account
he
said
but
it
is
the
key
to
empowering
refugees
and
displaced
persons
added
the
unhcr
s
director
of
programme
support
and
former
representative
in
jordan
in
when
jordan
s
za
atari
camp
opened
home
at
one
point
to
as
many
as
syrian
refugees
friday
prayers
would
be
followed
by
a
riot
with
frustrated
anxious
residents
destroying
things
and
throwing
stones
harper
said
but
once
unhcr
began
spending
up
to
each
month
on
electricity
supplied
to
the
camp
via
a
grid
connection
refugees
used
it
to
set
up
some
shops
and
businesses
and
the
rampages
stopped
as
their
sense
of
dignity
grew
he
said
they
started
feeling
possessive
protective
engaged
in
the
stability
of
the
camp
he
added
since
last
year
two
of
jordan
s
main
refugee
camps
have
used
power
produced
by
their
own
solar
plants
one
in
za
atari
funded
by
german
development
bank
kfw
and
the
other
in
azraq
backed
by
the
ikea
foundation
that
can
also
feed
back
surplus
electricity
into
the
national
grid
sarah
head
of
humanitarian
energy
at
charity
practical
action
said
jordan
s
government
takes
the
wider
view
that
getting
camps
connected
will
improve
the
country
s
infrastructure
and
support
national
development
they
see
it
as
an
opportunity
and
as
a
way
to
change
perceptions
in
host
communities
that
this
is
good
for
both
of
us
not
just
for
refugees
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
practical
action
is
embarking
on
a
project
in
the
north
jordan
city
of
irbid
also
funded
by
the
ikea
foundation
that
will
assist
landlords
renting
properties
to
vulnerable
refugee
families
to
install
rooftop
solar
systems
for
heating
water
the
development
charity
will
also
work
with
unhcr
and
other
partners
in
rwanda
to
set
up
solar
and
home
systems
to
power
schools
clinics
street
lighting
and
home
appliances
in
three
camps
hosting
congolese
refugees
offering
an
alternative
to
candles
and
kerosene
it
will
also
look
at
ways
to
provide
more
sustainable
fuel
and
efficient
stoves
for
cooking
government
officials
and
others
at
a
meeting
on
wednesday
in
kigali
rwanda
s
capital
about
the
renewable
energy
for
refugees
project
emphasised
the
need
to
move
away
from
the
environmentally
harmful
use
of
firewood
mei
said
energy
underpins
many
things
displaced
people
need
to
do
in
their
daily
lives
said
from
charging
mobile
phones
used
to
contact
relatives
and
transfer
money
to
washing
clothes
lighting
entertainment
and
moving
around
but
the
answer
is
not
to
distribute
energy
for
free
she
added
there
is
already
a
market
there
in
camps
with
households
spending
a
relatively
high
proportion
of
their
disposable
income
on
energy
she
noted
handouts
risk
destroying
that
market
and
making
people
worse
off
by
giving
them
products
they
do
not
want
she
said
the
challenge
is
to
supply
cleaner
power
and
cooking
methods
for
a
lower
price
and
other
experts
said
the
forthcoming
global
action
plan
will
include
targets
and
concrete
ways
of
reaching
them
those
drafting
it
said
practical
action
s
hopes
that
in
five
years
aid
workers
will
factor
in
the
provision
of
clean
energy
from
the
outset
of
an
emergency
and
include
it
in
funding
plans
doing
so
would
also
bring
significant
cost
savings
for
agencies
that
spend
millions
of
dollars
each
year
on
power
from
unreliable
diesel
generators
that
often
break
down
cutting
off
the
health
clinics
and
other
services
they
run
she
added
unhcr
s
harper
said
aid
organisations
needed
to
collaborate
with
business
governments
and
development
banks
to
overcome
barriers
to
building
and
operating
clean
energy
services
for
refugees
and
displaced
people
problems
include
high
upfront
costs
onerous
bureaucracy
and
restrictive
regulations
in
za
atari
for
example
unhcr
found
refugees
were
willing
to
buy
electricity
but
the
agency
had
no
mechanism
to
receive
payment
a
new
partnership
called
the
smart
communities
coalition
by
credit
card
giant
mastercard
and
the
government
s
power
africa
programme
will
attempt
to
resolve
such
issues
by
putting
in
place
digital
infrastructure
in
refugee
camps
and
settlements
starting
later
this
year
in
kenya
and
uganda
the
aim
is
for
governments
aid
agencies
and
companies
to
develop
a
model
to
provide
refugees
with
internet
and
mobile
connectivity
digital
financial
tools
and
access
to
clean
energy
that
will
require
fresh
thinking
on
all
sides
said
tara
nathan
who
leads
on
partnerships
for
mastercard
which
will
offer
its
expertise
in
digital
payments
the
money
the
capacities
exist
it
about
finding
a
way
for
everyone
to
act
like
and
intervene
together
she
said
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
on
energy
access
in
lisbon
