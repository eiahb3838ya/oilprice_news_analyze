signs of gas banned for harming climate prompt global hunt for source

thomson
reuters
foundation
scientists
are
hunting
for
the
mysterious
source
of
surging
levels
of
a
gas
that
is
outlawed
for
depleting
the
planet
s
protective
ozone
layer
united
nations
officials
said
on
friday
production
of
the
banned
gas
should
be
near
zero
but
recent
findings
showed
an
increase
in
the
atmosphere
of
percent
since
according
to
a
report
published
this
week
in
the
academic
journal
nature
research
points
to
it
originating
in
east
asia
experts
said
the
gas
trichlorofluoromethane
or
was
once
commonly
used
in
refrigerators
and
spray
cans
and
has
industrial
uses
experts
want
to
tighten
down
the
source
of
the
gas
emissions
by
fall
said
paul
newman
of
a
panel
helping
enforce
the
agency
s
montreal
protocol
that
bans
chemicals
the
planet
s
ozone
layer
shields
life
from
solar
rays
is
undetectable
using
common
infrared
techniques
so
scientists
plan
to
utilize
monitoring
stations
and
aircraft
observations
newman
said
but
pinpointing
the
exact
location
will
be
difficult
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
you
really
have
to
get
nearby
the
production
facilities
themselves
and
find
the
stuff
he
said
no
country
has
been
known
to
violate
the
montreal
protocol
in
its
years
of
existence
said
david
fahey
also
a
member
of
the
treaty
s
assessment
panel
there
s
certainly
somebody
who
is
responsible
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
it
could
be
inadvertent
he
told
the
foundation
in
addition
to
damaging
to
the
ozone
layer
is
also
a
greenhouse
gas
thousands
of
time
more
potent
than
carbon
dioxide
