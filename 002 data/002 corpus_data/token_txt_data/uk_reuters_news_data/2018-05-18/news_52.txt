petrochina
the
country
s
top
gas
producer
has
curbed
supplies
of
the
fuel
to
some
industrial
users
in
northern
and
western
regions
in
the
first
sign
of
emerging
tightness
only
two
months
after
china
experienced
one
of
its
worst
winter
gas
crunches
to
prevent
another
around
of
winter
shortages
petrochina
started
from
early
may
limiting
gas
supplies
and
hiking
prices
for
major
customers
including
city
gas
distributors
and
inland
gas
liquefaction
plants
in
some
western
provinces
four

briefed
on
the
matter
said
they
declined
to
be

they
are
not

suppliers

china

natural

rose
almost
percent
in
the
first
four
months
of

to

according
to

calculations
based
on
official

that
led
to
a

in
recent

and
has

the
expansion
in

driven
by
an

exceeds
a
annual

forecast
by

an

from

we
were
caught
by

the

said
this
is
the

petrochina

reduced

the

the

petrochina
wanted
to
cap
volumes
supplied
this
year
to
the
inner
mongolia
regional
government
at
consumption
levels
a
government
official
told
reuters
the
negotiation
reached
a
deadlock
as
we
asked
for
more
supplies
for
this
year
said
the
official
the
company
is
only
willing
to
offer
us
the
same
amount
they
supplied
in
which
is
not
enough
we
can
not
accept
it
the
official
said
a
sweeping
campaign
to
switch
industries
and
household
from
coal
to
gas
has
led
to
a
surge
in
the
region
s
demand
for
the
fuel
in
a
broader
attempt
to
avoid
a
winter
squeeze
the
state
planner
has
asked
national
gas
producers
to
sign
annual
supply
contracts
with
major
users
by
the
end
of
april
state
producers
however
are
suffering
ongoing
losses
in
their
import
business
of

contracts

china
