the

farmers
will
need
to
spend
more
ahead
of
harvesting
which
starts
in
about
a
month
in
russia
he
said
farms
are
also
factoring
in
potential
losses

a
percent
tax
china
announced
on
major
american
imports
following
the
government
s
decision
to
slap
duties
on

and
aluminum
we
re
seeing
financial
stress
occurring
in

that
we

seen

decade
or
so
said

college

food

more
pressure

in
an
percent
decline
from

tim
gannon
paid
about
in
february
to
fill
a
tank
with
diesel
used
to
run
equipment
and
irrigation
the
price
increase
means
it
may
cost
up
to
percent
more
or
an
extra
to
refill
it
in
coming
weeks
he
said
that
s
a
fairly
significant
amount
of
income
to
lose
he
said
gannon
has
been
taking
steps
to
cut
his
diesel
costs
over
the
past
year
by
reducing
the
number
of
times
he
plows
or
tills
in
brazil
farmers

also
taking
steps
to
deal
with
higher
costs

ferreira
bueno
a

mato
grosso
said
increased
fuel
costs
meant
he
had
no
other
option
but
to
spend
less

treat
the
other
farmers
might
hire
fewer
workers
or
delay
investment
plans

time

costs
are
rising
where
the
impact
is
felt
greatest
is
