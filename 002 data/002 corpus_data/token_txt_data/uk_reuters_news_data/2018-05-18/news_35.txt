bp
chief
executive
bob
dudley
expects
a
flood
of
shale
and
the
reopening
of
opec
taps
to
cool
the
oil
market
after
crude
rose
above
a
barrel
this
week
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
exit
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
revive
sanctions
on
the
opec
member
country
as
well
as
venezuela
s
plummeting
output
has
helped
to
lift
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
but
bp
sees
oil
falling
to
between
and
a
barrel
due
to
surging
shale
output
and
opec
s
capacity
to
boost
production
dudley
told
reuters
clearly
the
withdrawal
of
the
united
states
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
has
brought
a
lot
of
uncertainty
to
the
market
he
said
in
an
interview
crude
exports
from
iran
the
member
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
could
drop
by
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
a
result
of
sanctions
the
ceo
said
citing
internal
bp
forecasts
dudley
said
he
expected
the
figure
to
be
at
the
lower
end
of
the
range
the
percent
recovery
in
crude
prices
since
february
has
given
strong
tailwind
to
oil
companies
such
as
bp
whose
profits
recovered
last
year
after
a
slump
in
the
market
the
energy
information
administration
this
month
boosted
its
forecast
of
growth
in
domestic
crude
production
in
to
an
high
of
million
bpd
as
shale
drillers
accelerate
activity
the
surge
in
output
has
been
offset
by
deep
supply
cuts
for
over
a
year
by
opec
and
other
producers
including
russia
opec
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
assured
key
consumers
that
the
world
would
have
adequate
supplies
even
if
iran
s
exports
dropped
sharply
markets
have
so
far
been
able
to
absorb
oil
s
rise
without
impacting
demand
growth
but
dudley
said
a
sustained
crude
price
of
over
would
be
unhealthy
two
years
ago
when
the
price
was
it
was
great
for
global
growth
the
engines
of
the
consuming
economies
but
it
was
terrible
for
producing
countries
and
that
led
to
producing
countries
not
being
able
to
purchase
things
as
well
that
was
not
a
healthy
i
think
when
you
get
above
it
is
not
a
healthy
price
although
the
international
energy
agency
this
week
cut
its
outlook
for
oil
demand
growth
in
due
to
rising
crude
prices
bp
still
expects
consumption
to
expand
by
million
bpd
extending
a
period
of
strong
growth
the
world
has
experienced
an
unprecedented
decade
of
economic
growth
that
is
likely
to
continue
even
with
sanctions
and
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
dudley
said
we
re
about
to
begin
to
see
political
factors
creating
trade
dislocations
sanctions
and
things
like
that
they
will
have
impacts
here
and
there
but
the
overall
economic
growth
rates
appear
to
be
not
overheated
