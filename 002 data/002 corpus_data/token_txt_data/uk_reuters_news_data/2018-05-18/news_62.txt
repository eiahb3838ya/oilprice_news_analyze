new
york
reuters
the
federal
agency
tasked
with
restoring
electricity
to
puerto
rico
after
hurricane
maria
hit
the
caribbean
last
year
is
leaving
the
island
though
thousands
still
have
no
power
heading
into
the
next
hurricane
season
starting
next
month
only
a
request
from
the
governor
of
the
island
bemoaning
the
fragile
state
of
the
power
grid
managed
to
keep
most
of
the
generators
brought
by
the
federal
emergency
management
agency
fema
on
puerto
rican
soil
for
another
six
months
the
remaining
generators
might
help
keep
the
lights
on
for
hospitals
or
police
stations
if
the
island
gets
hit
again
during
the
coming
hurricane
season
which
begins
june
hurricane
maria
devastated
puerto
rico
last
september
leaving
million
homes
and
businesses
in
the
dark
both
the
island
s
power
utility
and
the
trump
administration
s
federal
emergency
management
agency
were
criticized
for
a
slow
response
most
power
has
been
restored
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers
but
the
electricity
grid
remains
unreliable
and
suffered
an
blackout
last
month
for

on
power
restoration
after
hurricanes
click
the
whole
world
is
very
nervous
about
hurricane
time
said
rosalina
abreu
gonzalez
who
lives
near
mariana
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
where
power
has
still
not
been
restored
there
is
a
real
concern
the
government
hasn
t
provided
an
energy
system
that
is
more
the
army
corps
a
unit
of
the
armed
forces
has
said
its
task
is
largely
complete
now
that
most
people
have
power
about
customers
are
still
without
electricity
most
in
remote
areas
according
to
the
new
head
of
the
island
s
power
utility
the
puerto
rico
electric
power
authority
our
mission
wasn
t
to
build
a
modern
resilient
system
charles
alexander
director
of
contingency
operations
and
homeland
security
headquarters
at
the
army
corps
said
at
a
senate
hearing
last
week
on
april
governor
ricardo
rossello
asked
officials
to
leave
behind
generators
at
critical
facilities
along
with
three
larger
generators
used
to
keep
the
grid
stable
fema
agreed
to
leave
the
and
generators
for
critical
facilities
supply
megawatts
of
power
enough
to
power
homes
new
prepa
chief
executive
walter
higgins
who
has
only
been
on
the
job
for
two
months
said
he
is
focusing
on
emergency
procedures
in
the
event
of
another
disaster
in
coming
months
he
said
there
is
a
plan
for
building
a
more
resilient
grid
in
the
future
higgins
took
over
from
ricardo
ramos
who
resigned
as
ceo
in
november
after
coming
under
fire
for
signing
unvetted
contractors
to
restore
power
rather
than
immediately
ask
for
assistance
from
other
utilities
unfortunately
pain
causes
learning
and
what
we
ve
learned
is
how
to
get
mutual
assistance
called
for
and
on
the
island
immediately
higgins
told
reuters
still
prepa
s
grid
lacks
buried
power
lines
or
reinforced
poles
common
in
other
hurricane
prone
areas
the
power
utility
ran
up
an
billion
debt
over
many
years
largely
due
to
poor
bill
collection
causing
the
system
to
fall
into
disrepair
it
is
very
hard
to
see
these
messages
where
the
government
is
saying
we
re
ready
for
next
season
we
re
not
said
sheylda
diaz
a
biology
professor
who
lives
near
utuado
in
the
island
s
center
where
some
lines
and
poles
have
yet
to
be
fixed
the
army
corps
will
not
provide
further
line
restoration
after
friday
fema
said
people
here
have
no
idea
that
they
are
leaving
said
abreu
gonzalez
who
runs
a
center
where
people
without
power
can
go
for
meals
higgins
said
he
sympathizes
with
those
who
want
the
corps
to
remain
i
can
understand
why
somebody
would
want
them
to
stay
longer
as
long
as
there
s
a
single
customer
maria
hit
shortly
after
hurricanes
harvey
and
irma
slammed
the
mainland
in
but
in
both
cases
power
was
largely
restored
within
a
week
i
can
not
imagine
a
scenario
where
texans
or
floridians
were
without
power
and
fema
would
make
that
decision
said
martin
heinrich
a
democrat
from
new
mexico
