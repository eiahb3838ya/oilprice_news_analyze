funds look past 3 pct u.s. yield to pump $11.9 bln into stocks-baml
london
reuters
investors
pumped
billion
into
global
equities
in
the
past
week
and
also
put
money
into
bank
loans
likely
viewing
the
rise
in
bond
yields
as
reflecting
a
robustly
growing
economy
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
said
on
friday
the
bank
s
data
which
tracks
fund
flows
from
wednesday
to
wednesday
also
showed
some
relatively
small
million
inflows
into
emerging
stocks
which
have
taken
a
hit
from
the
treasury
selloff
and
the
dollar
s
rise
but
tend
to
benefit
from
an
improving
economy
the
rise
in
yields
from
percent
to
percent
over
the
past
months
is
a
good
rise
in
yields
but
if
more
than
percent
is
considered
a
bad
rise
this
should
be
revealed
in
coming
weeks
by
further
outflows
from
financials
emerging
markets
credit
as
well
as
rising
private
client
cash
levels
baml
told
clients
in
a
note
a
good
yield
rise
would
indicate
faith
in
economic
growth
while
a
bad
rise
on
the
other
hand
could
reflect
the
view
that
inflation
is
gaining
the
upper
hand
the
bank
said
its
private
clients
cash
allocations
currently
stood
at
percent
of
assets
under
management
a
record
low
testifying
to
their
appetite
for
risk
within
equities
funds
took
in
billion
and
japanese
stocks
took
in
a
modest
million
but
europe
posted
its
straight
week
of
losses
losing
million
european
shares
have
suffered
as
economic
data
has
underwhelmed
indicating
a
growth
slowdown
even
as
companies
have
benefited
from
swinging
tax
cuts
that
boosted
their
bottom
line
at
least
in
the
first
quarter
another
indication
of
growth
optimism
was
large
inflows
into
pharmaceutical
and
technology
stocks
which
took
in
million
and
million
respectively
baml
said
adding
investors
show
preference
for
growth
over
value
the
data
also
showed
million
inflow
into
bank
loans
which
baml
attributed
to
the
fact
that
markets
are
now
pricing
in
a
roughly
percent
probability
of
three
more
federal
reserve
rate
rises
this
year
instead
of
two
banks
tend
to
benefit
as
interest
rates
rise
bond
funds
absorbed
billion
however
emerging
debt
recorded
its
fourth
straight
week
of
outflow
shedding
billion
bonds
also
considered
vulnerable
to
higher
borrowing
costs
also
saw
a
second
week
of
outflows
baml
said
however
there
were
signs
the
treasury
yield
rise
could
be
approaching
its
end
noting
million
in
redemptions
from
financials
stocks
bring
losses
to
billion
this
is
important
as
the
reversal
in
flows
to
financials
funds
preceded
the
peak
in
bond
yields
in
both
and
the
bank

on
financials
flows
and
bond
yields
