reuters
a
close
ally
of
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
issued
a
stark
warning
to
the
united
states
about
the
risks
of
placing
america
first
accusing
washington
of
seeking
to
block
a
planned
gas
pipeline
to
shore
up
its
own
exports
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
defended
the
nord
stream
pipeline
which
is
strongly
opposed
by
many
east
european
countries
as
well
as
the
who
say
that
by
circumventing
ukraine
the
pipeline
will
increase
russia
s
leverage
over
countries
that
rely
on
moscow
s
energy
sales
ahead
of
a
summit
due
later
on
friday
between
merkel
and
russian
president
vladimir
putin
altmaier
said
the
european
union
should
guarantee
that
ukraine
will
continue
to
receive
gas
transit
fees
even
after
the
pipeline
is
built
under
the
baltic
but
he
accused
washington
of
wanting
to
block
the
pipeline
built
by
russia
s
energy
giant
gazprom
and
a
consortium
of
european
energy
companies
in
order
to
boost
its
own
shale
gas
exports
they
are
looking
for
markets
which
we
can
understand
and
they
can
land
it
here
easily
he
said
but
it
is
much
more
expensive
than
pipeline
gas
so
blocking
nord
stream
on
its
own
won
t
guarantee
he
added
that
europe
would
respond
firmly
to
attempts
to
place
its
own
economic
interests
before
those
of
partners
the
are
our
friends
and
partners
and
we
want
to
defend
our
common
values
but
if
it
s
america
first
and
they
put
their
economic
interest
before
others
then
they
have
to
expect
europe
to
define
their
own
interests
and
fight
