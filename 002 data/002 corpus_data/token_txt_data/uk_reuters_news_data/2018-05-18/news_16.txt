sochi
russia
reuters
russian
president
vladimir
putin
said
at
a
meeting
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
friday
that
he
would
stand
up
to
any
attempts
by
president
donald
trump
to
block
a
gas
pipeline
project
berlin
and
moscow
have
been
at
loggerheads
since
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
four
years
ago
but
they
share
a
common
interest
in
the
nord
stream
pipeline
project
which
will
allow
russia
to
export
more
natural
gas
to
northern
europe
a
government
official
this
week
said
washington
had
concerns
about
the
project
and
that
companies
involved
in
russian
pipeline
projects
faced
a
higher
risk
of
being
hit
with
sanctions
donald
is
not
just
the
president
he
s
also
a
good
tough
entrepreneur
putin
said
at
a
news
conference
alongside
merkel
after
the
two
leaders
had
talks
in
the
russian
black
sea
resort
of
sochi
he
s
promoting
the
interests
of
his
business
to
ensure
the
sales
of
liquefied
natural
gas
on
the
european
market
putin
said
departing
from
his
usual
approach
of
being
scrupulously
respectful
when
speaking
about
trump
but
it
depends
on
us
how
we
build
our
relations
with
our
partners
it
will
depend
on
our
partners
in
we
believe
it
the
pipeline
is
beneficial
for
us
we
will
fight
for
as
well
as
the
differences
over
nord
stream
european
capitals
are
at
odds
with
washington
over
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
moscow
shares
europe
s
position
on
the
deal
some
commentators
have
said
that
a
shared
opposition
to
trump
s
stances
on
iran
and
other
issues
could
lead
to
a
rapprochement
between
europe
and
russia
repairing
a
relationship
badly
damaged
by
the
ukraine
conflict
merkel
who
earlier
in
the
day
received
a
bouquet
of
pink
and
white
roses
from
putin
as
she
arrived
at
his
residence
in
sochi
also
hinted
at
tensions
between
berlin
and
the
trump
administration
asked
about
differences
with
the
united
states
over
the
iran
deal
and
other
issues
merkel
told
reporters
we
have
a
strong
transatlantic
friendship
which
during
its
history
has
had
to
withstand
many
questions
of
different
opinions
and
i
think
that
might
be
the
case
now
as
while
the
russian
leader
is
frequently
critical
of
policy
he
has
been
meticulous
about
not
attaching
blame
to
trump
personally
kremlin
officials
have
said
in
the
past
the
two
men
have
a
personal
rapport
that
putin
wishes
to
preserve
european
states
involved
in
nord
stream
say
it
is
a
purely
commercial
project
but
the
trump
administration
say
it
is
helping
the
kremlin
pursue
its
political
agenda
the
pipeline
may
result
in
less
russian
gas
being
transported
via
ukraine
depriving
kiev
s
struggling
government
of
transit
fees
that
are
a
vital
source
of
revenue
in
a
nod
to
the
concerns
merkel
said
russian
gas
should
still
be
pumped
through
ukraine
we
see
nord
stream
as
an
economic
project
but
it
also
has
implications
and
that
s
why
we
are
working
on
what
guarantees
ukraine
could
be
given
she
said
putin
said
he
was
willing
to
negotiate
with
kiev
about
continued
transit
of
russian
gas
despite
the
common
ground
on
nordstream
and
the
iran
deal
tensions
in
the
relationship
surfaced
at
the
news
briefing
merkel
said
she
was
worried
about
a
new
property
law
implemented
by
the
government
of
syria
which
is
backed
by
moscow
rights
activists
say
the
law
allows
the
syrian
government
to
deprive
people
who
have
been
displaced
by
the
fighting
of
their
homes
that
is
bad
news
for
people
who
want
one
day
to
return
to
syria
we
will
discuss
that
intensively
and
ask
russia
to
use
their
influence
to
persuade
assad
not
to
do
that
we
must
prevent
facts
being
created
on
the
ground
merkel
said
putin
a
day
earlier
had
received
syrian
leader
bashar
at
his
residence
in
sochi
for
talks
at
the
briefing
with
merkel
the
russian
president
chided
european
leaders
over
syria
saying
if
they
want
syrian
refugees
living
in
their
countries
to
return
home
europe
had
to
commit
to
reconstruction
in
syria
diplomats
say
that
is
a
bone
of
contention
because
european
governments
believe
russia
should
pay
the
lion
s
share
of
the
reconstruction
cost
since
it
is
the
main
military
force
and
powerbroker
in
syria
