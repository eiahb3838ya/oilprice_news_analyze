moldova
a
small
landlocked
country
in
eastern
europe
imports
of
its
energy
and
has
seen
its
energy
prices
rise
by
more
than
half
in
the
past
five
years
but
that
could
soon
change
according
to
the
united
nations
development
programme
undp
which
this
year
will
launch
an
innovative
effort
to
power
a
moldovan
university
with
solar
energy
the
initiative
with
sun
exchange
a
south
african
solar
power
marketplace
will
allow
people
to
buy
solar
cells
using
solarcoin
a
cryptocurrency
launched
by
blockchain
electricchain
and
then
lease
them
to
the
technical
university
of
moldova
one
of
the
country
s
largest
universities
buyers
also
can
pay
for
the
solar
cells
using
euros
or
bitcoin
sun
exchange
officials
said
the
idea
is
to
find
new
sources
of
finance
to
help
buildings
go
green
overnight
in
this
instance
with
rooftop
solar
panels
said
dumitru
vasilescu
a
programme
manager
with
undp
in
moldova
one
of
europe
s
poorest
countries
one
of
the
biggest
obstacles
to
countries
investing
in
renewable
energy
is
a
lack
of
finance
as
you
often
have
to
wait
to
years
before
you
get
a
return
on
your
investment
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
the
university
will
get
a
full
megawatt
of
energy
installed
in
the
summer
he
said
as
a
result
of
the
effort
owners
of
the
solar
cells
in
turn
will
receive
solarcoins
as
soon
as
the
university
produces
energy
earning
interest
of
about
percent
on
their
investment
vasilescu
added
moldova
currently
has
over
square
metres
of
unused
rooftop
space
on
public
buildings
that
could
be
potentially
used
for
such
efforts
he
said
blockchain
which
first
emerged
as
the
system
underpinning
the
virtual
currency
bitcoin
is
a
digital
shared
record
of
transactions
maintained
by
a
network
of
computers
on
the
internet
without
the
need
of
a
centralised
authority
it
has
become
a
key
technology
in
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
given
its
ability
to
record
and
keep
track
of
assets
or
transactions
without
the
need
for
middlemen
research
firm
idc
estimates
global
investment
in
blockchain
will
more
than
double
in
to
billion
from
million
last
year
most
of
it
for
banking
idc
expects
strong
growth
in
the
energy
space
between
and
kevin
treco
an
associate
director
at
the
carbon
trust
an
environmental
consultancy
said
technologies
could
significantly
change
energy
use
in
countries
striving
to
decentralise
power
and
boost
renewable
sources
in
moldova
for
example
renewable
energy
could
reduce
the
country
s
dependence
on
energy
imports
such
as
oil
and
gas
from
russia
vasilescu
said
darius
nassiry
a
senior
research
associate
at
the
overseas
development
institute
a
british
think
tank
predicted
that
most
of
the
growth
in
energy
would
occur
in
the
developing
world
they
have
energy
and
a
more
accommodating
legal
and
regulatory
environment
towards
such
innovations
he
said
by
email
but
a
lack
of
understanding
on
how
blockchain
applications
such
as
cryptocurrencies
work
could
slow
their
in
the
energy
sector
he
added
for
abraham
cambridge
the
founder
and
ceo
of
sun
exchange
the
solar
currency
exchange
system
has
all
the
right
incentives
in
place
it
reduces
the
costs
of
going
solar
dramatically
for
the
end
user
and
makes
it
easy
for
anyone
in
the
world
to
own
a
solar
cell
anywhere
in
the
world
and
from
it
make
a
steady
source
of
income
he
said
in
a
statement
blockchain
is
also
being
used
in
the
energy
sector
to
facilitate
carbon
trading
with
computing
giant
ibm
announcing
this
week
that
it
will
partner
with
veridium
labs
an
environmental
tech
to
turn
carbon
credits
into
digital
tokens
if
the
moldovan
solar
currency
pilot
is
successful
undp
plans
to
replicate
it
in
neighbouring
countries
said
vasilescu
adding
that
it
could
revolutionise
the
renewable
energy
market
for
eastern
europe
and
central
asia
