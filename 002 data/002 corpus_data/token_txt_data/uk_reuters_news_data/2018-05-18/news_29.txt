focus-czech firms look to sweep up profits from dirty power
reuters
two
czech
power
companies
are
targeting
fossil
plants
in
germany
as
part
of
a
contrarian
strategy
to
snap
up
older
polluting
assets
on
the
cheap
from
european
energy
giants
going
green
eph
and
seven
energy
have
submitted
rival
offers
for
french
group
engie
s
plants
near
munich
and
bremen
as
well
as
its
percent
stake
in
a
plant
in
wilhemshaven
according
to
two
utilities
banking
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
assets
are
expected
to
fetch
a
few
hundred
million
euros
in
total
they
said
eph
and
seven
energy
both
told
reuters
they
were
interested
in
acquisitions
in
germany
but
declined
to
comment
on
whether
they
had
bid
for
the
engie
plants
engie
declined
to
comment
the
czech
firms
both
backed
by
billionaires
have
no
links
with
each
other
but
share
a
common
game
plan
they
are
looking
to
buy
up
old
coal
and
plants
being
discarded
by
big
players
like
engie
vattenfall
and
enbw
who
are
trying
to
set
themselves
up
for
the
future
by
switching
to
renewable
generation
fossil
fuel
or
thermal
power
still
accounts
for
almost
half
of
the
eu
s
electricity
eph
and
seven
energy
are
betting
the
plants
will
need
to
remain
operational
over
the
next
years
for
power
to
stabilize
grids
when
demand
outstrips
supply
from
less
predictable
wind
and
solar
there
are
potential
difficulties
and
risks
associated
with
this
strategic
focus
on
conventional
power
generation
where
margins
are
increasingly
squeezed
because
of
low
wholesale
prices
and
a
surge
in
renewable
capacity
governments
or
regulators
aiming
to
meet
tough
pollution
targets
could
also
decide
to
limit
power
generation
from
coal
plants
this
happened
to
eph
in
britain
where
it
announced
in
february
it
would
close
the
eggborough
plant
after
failing
to
secure
an
agreement
to
provide
capacity
the
company
said
without
a
contract
for
future
years
it
would
not
be
economically
viable
to
continue
operations
a
planning
application
is
in
progress
to
develop
a
new
station
at
the
site
but
it
is
unlikely
to
be
operational
until
the
tomas
david
vice
chairman
of
ep
power
europe
eph
s
power
generation
division
said
the
company
was
interested
in
assets
critically
needed
to
meet
a
country
s
power
needs
this
is
the
reason
for
our
interest
in
german
lignite
he
told
reuters
referring
to
a
type
of
coal

held
eph

by
czech
billionaire
daniel
kretinsky

bought
plants
in
germany
italy
and
britain
over
the
past
three
years
from
sweden
s
vattenfall
german
group
and
uk
company
centrica
producing
more
than
terawatt
hours
of
power
annually
eph
says
it
is
among
europe
s
top
electricity
producers
its
power
generation
portfolio
makes
about
billion
euros
billion
in
annual
revenue
which
along
with
an
ability
to
raise
billions
more
in
debt
provides
a
significant
warchest
for
acquisitions
newcomer
seven
energy
launched
in
february
by
pavel
tykac
has
more
than
billion
euros
to
spend
and
said
it
saw
potential
for
acquisitions
in
germany
britain
italy
and
the
benelux
countries
seven
energy
ceo
alan
svoboda
said
he
aimed
to
close
at
least
one
deal
this
year
several
others
are
in
negotiations
each
typically
worth
a
few
hundred
million
euros
he
added
as
part
of
its
plan
to
wring
profits
from
existing
coal
and
gas
plants
it
has
brought
in
a
number
of
former
top
officials
from
czech
firm
cez
central
europe
s
biggest
utility
svoboda
said
finnish
group
fortum
s
bid
for
a
stake
in
german
thermal
power
generation
firm
uniper
if
successful
would
likely
trigger
sales
of
fossil
fuel
power
assets
that
would
be
attractive
for
his
company
we
are
looking
at
it
opportunistically
he
said
eph
and
seven
energy
are
not
alone
in
targeting
thermal
power
assets
although
the
field
of
potential
buyers
is
small
because
such
companies
need
to
be
free
from
political
pressure
to
reduce
carbon
footprints
according
to
analysts
investment
funds
such
as
i
squared
capital
first
reserve
and
kkr
have
all
acquired
utility
assets
in
the
past
among
others
i

bought
irish
energy
group
viridian
first
reserve
has
bought
the
uk
s
morrison
utility
services
kkr
bought
france
s
coriance
other
thermal
plants
that
could
come
up
for
sale
according
to
utilities
bankers

s
german
coal
plants
in
heilbronn
karlsruhe
as
well
as
rostock
which
is
with
vattenfall
austria

evn
could
also
sell
its
percent
stake
in
the
duisburg
walsum
plant
the
bankers
said
adding
that
no
decisions
on
these
assets
had
been
taken
yet
enbw
and
evn
declined
to
comment
jiri
gavor
head
of
energy
consultant
ena
said
eph
and
seven
energy
s
strategy
could
bear
fruit
because
europe
s
push
to
replace
coal
with
renewables
would
not
be
as
quick
or
smooth
as
politicians
would
like
he
added
other
investors
don
t
have
the
competence
like
eph
or
seven
in
running
these
old
