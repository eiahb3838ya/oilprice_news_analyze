said
also
pointing
to
this
week
s
fall
in
the
euro
against
the
swiss

elsewhere
the
two
other
macro
spotlights
were
the
hot
oil
markets
after
brent
crude
broke
up
through
a
barrel
on
thursday
and
the
strain
on
emerging

currencies
the
turkish
lira
was
wobbling
again
having
fallen
to
a
record
low
this

the
brazilian
real
plumbed
a
low
while
mexico
s
peso
has
shed
more

that

continues

be
hit
by

the

american
free

agreement
nafta

on

for
the
first
time
since

support
the

it
slipped
again
on
friday
too
overall
for
the
big
emerging
market
currencies
it
has
been
the
worst
week
in
months
perhaps
the
most
unnerving
aspect
of
the
recent
rupiah
weakness
has
been
the
sheer
speed
in
which
the
currency
markets
have
turned
against
some
emerging

countries

however
policy
credibility
is
the
most
important
tool
