ioc
will
be
forced
to
implement
its
own
pricing
mechanism
to
minimise
losses
if
the
government
fails
to
implement
its
proposed
fuel
price
formula
the
company
said
on
friday
the
move
by
lanka
ioc
a
subsidiary
of
india
s
ioc
comes
after
the
government
failed
to
increase
fuel
prices
charged
by
ceylon
petroleum
corp
cpc
in
line
with
rising
global
oil
prices
on
march
lanka
ioc
raised
its
prices
because
of
losses
incurred
after
the

s
failure
to
implement
a
pricing
formula
for
cpc
finance
minister
mangala
samaraweera
last
week
said
that
the
cabinet
has
approved
a
price
formula
with
revisions
every
two
months
the
government
raised
fuel
prices
last
week
after
lanka
ioc
raised
its
prices
cabinet
approval
is
there
but
the
pricing
of
petroleum
is
a
very
touchy
issue
across
the
globe
and
the
same
is
the
case
in
sri
lanka
lanka
ioc
s
managing
director
shyam
bohra
told
reuters
if
the
proper
pricing
mechanism
is
in
place
we
will
follow
it
if
it
is
not
then
we
will
have
to
sell
our
products
at
the
cost
plus
what
ever
actuals
are
lanka
ioc
posted
a
loss
of
million
rupees
million
in
the
year
to
march
against
a
billion
rupee
profit
in
the
previous
year
mainly
because
of
high
global
oil
prices
in
conjunction
with
low
retail
prices
for
fuel
most
likely
it
will
be
that
we
will
have
to
have
our
own
prices
we
can
t
keep
on
losing
money
bohra
added
president
maitripala
sirisena
s
coalition
government
which
has
pressed
ahead
with
unpopular
fiscal
reforms
since
coming
to
power
in
has
been
hesitant
to
implement
the
fuel
price
formula
before
local
elections
the
coalition
partners
suffered
a
humiliating
loss
in
local
government
polls
in
february
bohra
said
the
government
has
yet
to
inform
the
company
about
the
new
pricing
formula
and
said
it
should
also
be
transparent
for
the
public
the
government
had
agreed
in
principle
with
an
international
monetary
fund
imf
requirement
to
implement
the
pricing
formula
in
return
for
a
billion
loan
approved
in
the
imf
on
thursday
said
that
if
the
pricing
formula
is
implemented
properly
it
would
eliminate
fuel
subsidies
that
benefit
the
rich
rather
than
the
poor
we
think
that
an
automatic
fuel
pricing
mechanism
marks
a
major
step
toward
completing
the
energy
pricing
reforms
that
are
under
way
in
sri
lanka
and
minimises
the
fiscal
risks
