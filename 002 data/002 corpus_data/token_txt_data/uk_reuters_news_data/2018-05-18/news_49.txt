euro
traders
nudged
the

back

it

fallen
nearly

largely
pressured
by
the
italian
uncertainty
it
is
also
heading
for
its
fifth
successive
weekly
drop

which
would
be
a
first
for

since
elsewhere
the
two
other
macro
spotlights
were
the
hot
oil
markets
after
brent
crude
broke
up
through
a
barrel
on
thursday
and
the
strain
on
emerging
economy
currencies
the
turkish
lira
was
holding
up
a
bit
better
having
fallen
to
a
record
low
this
week
the
brazilian
real
plumbed
a
low
while
mexico
s
peso
has
shed
more
than
percent
this

that

a

to
tighten

policy
on
thursday
for
the
first
time
since

the

it
slipped
again
on
friday
perhaps
the
most
unnerving
aspect
of
the
recent
rupiah
weakness
has
been
the
sheer
speed
in
which
the

markets
have
turned

credibility
is
the
