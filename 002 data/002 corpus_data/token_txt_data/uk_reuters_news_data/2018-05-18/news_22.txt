reuters
russian
president
vladimir
putin
said
at
a
meeting
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
on
friday
that
he
would
stand
up
to
any
attempts
by
president
donald
trump
to
block
a
gas
pipeline
project
berlin
and
moscow
have
been
at
loggerheads
since
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
four
years
ago
but
they
share
a
common
interest
in
the
nordstream
pipeline
project
which
will
allow
russia
to
export
more
natural
gas
to
northern
europe
a
government
official
this
week
said
washington
had
concerns
about
the
project
and
that
companies
involved
in
russian
pipeline
projects
faced
a
higher
risk
of
being
hit
with
sanctions
donald
is
not
just
the
president
he
s
also
a
good
tough
entrepreneur
putin
said
at
a
news
conference
alongside
merkel
after
the
two
leaders
had
talks
in
the
russian
black
sea
resort
of
sochi
he
s
promoting
the
interests
of
his
business
to
ensure
the
sales
of
liquefied
natural
gas
on
the
european
market
putin
said
i
understand
the
president
he
s
defending
the
interests
of
his
business
he
wants
to
push
his
product
on
the
european
market
but
it
depends
on
us
how
we
build
our
relations
with
our
partners
it
will
depend
on
our
partners
in
we
believe
it
the
pipeline
is
beneficial
for
us
we
will
fight
for
merkel
who
earlier
in
the
day
received
a
bouquet
of
pink
and
white
roses
from
putin
as
she
arrived
at
his
residence
in
sochi
also
hinted
at
tensions
between
berlin
and
the
trump
administration
as
well
as
the
differences
over
nordstream
european
capitals
are
at
odds
with
washington
over
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
moscow
shares
europe
s
position
on
the
deal
germany
britain
france
and
all
our
partners
in
the
european
union
continue
to
support
this
deal
and
remain
in
this
deal
and
we
know
that
a
very
specific
situation
arose
that
we
europeans
need
to
discuss
with
iran
merkel
said
at
the
news
conference
i
know
that
the
deal
is
anything
but
perfect
but
it
is
better
than
no
asked
about
differences
with
the
united
states
merkel
told
reporters
we
have
a
strong
transatlantic
friendship
which
during
its
history
has
had
to
withstand
many
questions
of
different
opinions
and
i
think
that
might
be
the
case
now
as
but
this
does
not
challenge
the
intensity
of
the
transatlantic
relationship
she
said
some
commentators
have
said
that
a
shared
opposition
to
trump
s
stances
on
iran
and
other
issues
could
lead
to
a
rapprochement
between
europe
and
russia
repairing
a
relationship
badly
damaged
by
the
ukraine
conflict
putin
s
remarks
about
trump
were
unusually
forthright
while
the
russian
leader
is
frequently
critical
of
policy
putin
has
always
been
respectful
in
his
comments
on
trump
with
whom
kremlin
officials
say
he
has
built
up
a
personal
rapport
