update 2-german cities free to ban older diesel cars immediately
berlin
reuters
german
cities
are
entitled
to
ban
older
diesel
vehicles
from
streets
with
immediate
effect
to
bring
air
pollution
levels
in
line
with
european
union
rules
germany
s
top
administrative
court
confirmed
on
friday
a
day
after
the
european
commission
lodged
a
complaint
with
europe
s
top
court
against
germany
for
its
repeated
failure
to
protect
air
quality
in
its
cities
the
details
of
the
german
ruling
will
add
to
pressure
on
volkswagen
and
its
german
peers
to
provide
hardware
fixes
for
polluting
diesel
models
research
firm
evercore
isi
has
said
this
could
cost
the
industry
billion
euros
billion
germany
opened
the
door
to
diesel
bans
in
february
when
it
allowed
environmental
groups
to
sue
cities
which
fail
to
enforce
europe
s
clean
air
rules
despite
fierce
lobbying
to
oppose
bans
from
carmakers
dozens
of
german
cities
including
hamburg
munich
and
stuttgart
exceed
european
union
limits
on
nitrogen
oxide
nox
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
in
a
statement
on
the
ruling
which
was
published
on
friday
germany
s
administrative
court
in
leipzig
said
there
should
be
no
grace
periods
for
driving
bans
such
restrictions
in
their
intensity
do
not
go
beyond
other
passage
and
stopping
bans
as
justified
by
road
law
requirements
which
motorists
always
have
to
reckon
with
and
which
they
principally
have
to
accept
the
court
said
european
carmakers
have
invested
heavily
in
diesel
engines
which
produce
less
of
the
carbon
that
causes
global
warming
than
gasoline
but
more
of
other
pollutants
blamed
for
causing
disease
germany
s
move
to
allow
cities
to
ban
diesel
engines
from
streets
could
have
wide
implications
for
the
future
of
the
industry
bans
in
the
home
of
some
of
the
world
s
biggest
automakers
are
a
further
blow
for
the
sector
and
an
embarrassment
for
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
government
which
has
faced
criticism
for
its
close
ties
to
the
industry
this
ruling
is
a
disaster
for
the
government
which
stands
in
for
the
greed
for
profit
by
the
carmakers
while
leaving
million
owners
of
manipulated
diesel
cars
alone
said
juergen
resch
managing
director
of
germany
s
duh
environmental
lobby
immediate
driving
bans
on
major
roads
or
road
sections
would
be
legitimate
and
could
affect
all
models
excluding
those
meeting
the
latest
emissions
standards
the
ruling
statement
said
of
the
million
diesel
cars
on
germany
s
roads
only
million
have
technology
which
was
phased
in
for
wider
city
areas
encompassing
a
multitude
of
main
roads
and
side
streets
the
court
recommended
a
phased
implementation
of
bans
starting
with
older
cars
that
meet
emissions
standards
the
standard
was
replaced
by
beginning
in
germany
s
vda
auto
industry
lobby
urged
cities
to
keep
a
sense
of
proportion
when
deciding
their
course
of
action
noting
that
nox
levels
should
fall
significantly
in
coming
months
as
more
models
are
sold
and
the
software
of
older
models
is
updated
what
s
at
stake
are
not
blanket
driving
bans
but
an
assessment
as
to
whether
local
measures
are
even
necessary
to
meet
the
legal
air
quality
targets
vda
president
bernhard
mattes
said
the
leipzig
court
had
said
in
february
that
vehicles
should
not
be
banned
until
tradesmen
and
some
residents
too
should
be
exempted
it
said
at
the
time
the
ruling
is
the
latest
regulatory
action
to
come
in
the
wake
of
volkswagen
s
diesel
emissions
scandal
in
and
was
prompted
by
legal
action
from
germany
s
duh
the
courts
have
been
waiting
for
the
ruling
statement
received
today
said
remo
klinger
a
lawyer
representing
duh
which
is
pushing
suits
in
german
cities
including
munich
and
frankfurt
we
believe
that
in
many
cases
it
will
swiftly
come
to
oral
hearings
and
germany
s
second
most
populous
city
hamburg
on
wednesday
said
it
had
started
putting
up
signs
to
enforce
driving
bans
of
older
diesel
cars
with
local
authorities
expecting
restrictions
to
start
taking
effect
at
the
end
of
this
month
