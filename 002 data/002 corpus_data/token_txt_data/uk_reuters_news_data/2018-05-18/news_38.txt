and

other
residents
of
lamao
village

sits
near
two
power
plants
and
an
oil
refinery
the
country
s
shift
to
renewable
energy
can
not
come
soon
enough
not
only
would
it
lessen
the
pollution
in
their
village
in
the
northern
philippines
it
could
also
mean
cheaper
electricity
castro
said
coal
just
adds
to
the
pollution
and
we
have
expensive
electricity
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
the
country
s
first
tax
hike
on
coal
in
years
introduced
in
march
may
signal
a
shift
in
the
government
s
attitude
towards
the
fossil
fuel
environmentalists
say
today
the
philippines
has
some
of
the
highest
power
generation
charges
in
southeast
asia
according
to
the
country
s
energy
agency
renewable
energy
costs
are
falling
around
the
globe
but
the
philippines
up
to
now
has
shown
few
signs
of
moving
away
from
coal
despite
ratifying
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
and
passing
laws
pushing
for
a
shift
to
renewable
energy
the
percent
tax
hike
on
imported
coal
part
of
a
wider
package
of
tax
reforms
passed
last
year
to
help
fund
a
major
infrastructure
project
could
change
that
environmental
experts
say
globally
coal
is
a
sunset
industry
antonio
la
vi√±a
a
former
environment
undersecretary
and
veteran
climate
negotiator
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
a
phone
interview
it
is
just
being
propped
up
by
subsidies
and
is
the
only
reason
it
is
cheap
in
the
philippines
the
coal
tax
signals
to
investors
that
they
should
invest
in
other
energy
sources
because
coal
is
no
longer
the
preferred
energy
source
in
the
country
he
added
the
philippines
imports
percent
of
its
coal
mostly
from
indonesia
and
australia
according
to
the
institute
for
climate
and
sustainable
cities
icsc
some
officials
say
coal
is
needed
to
power
the
nation
s
growth
including
the
government
s
centerpiece
push
to
build
new
roads
airports
and
mass
transit
systems
we
need
a
continuous
and
stable
supply
of
electricity
and
coal
is
the
most
stable
source
of
energy
said
christine
danao
head
of
power
energy
and
electrification
at
the
national
economic
development
authority
in
terms
of
fuel
coal
is
still
the
cheapest
in
the
long
run
the
government
will
see
what
renewable
energy
technology
will
bring
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
the
cost
of
electricity
generated
from
solar
and
wind
has
plunged
in
recent
years
and
costs
will
be
halved
again
by
compared
to
according
to
predictions
by
the
abu
international
renewable
energy
agency
solar
philippines
southeast
asia
s
largest
solar
company
is
offering
to
produce
solar
electricity
for
about
cents
a
for
meralco
the
largest
electrical
distributor
in
the
country
and
other
electricity
companies
said
koji
bulahan
a
spokesman
for
solar
philippines
that
is
about
percent
less
than
meralco
charges
on
average
for
a
kilowatt
hour
of
power
primarily
generated
from
coal
according
to
the
latest
rates
published
on
the
company
s
website
here
a
shift
to
renewable
energy
has
been
held
back
by
the
country
s
major
energy
companies
said
glenis
balangue
a
senior
researcher
at
ibon
foundation
a
think
tank
based
in
quezon
city
if
our
power
generation
policy
still
favours
corporations
that
are
only
interested
in
their
bottom
line
we
can
never
truly
push
for
renewable
energy
balangue
said
the
high
upfront
costs
of
many
forms
of
renewable
energy
which
require
installation
of
expensive
equipment
which
then
produces
power
at
extremely
low
cost
can
be
a
struggle
for
investors
with
aims
or
for
investors
anxious
about
trying
something
new
experts
say
international
investors
also
have
already
poured
billions
of
dollars
into
the
philippines
coal
industry
helping
it
to
thrive
climate
activists
said
here
the
philippines
government
privatised
the
country
s
power
industry
in
saying
the
move
would
help
bring
more
affordable
and
reliable
electricity
coal
seen
as
a
cheaper
alternative
to
oil
at
the
time
became
the
country
s
energy
of
choice
and
because
many
coal
plants
have
a
lifespan
of
years
or
more
investors
in
those
plants
are
still
demanding
a
payback
on
investment
the
philippines
however
still
has
plans
for
more
than
mw
of
new
coal
power
in
the
pipeline
worth
billion
according
to
a
study
published
by
the
icsc
and
the
institute
for
energy
economics
and
financial
analysis
last
year
here
but
international
efforts
to
address
climate
change
including
a
potential
flight
of
investor
capital
from
dirtier
fuels
and
the
rise
of
renewable
alternatives
could
mean
that
coal
investment
will
not
deliver
the
expected
returns
the
study
noted
worse
consumers
may
have
to
shoulder
the
losses
from
power
plants
the
institute
noted
in
mindanao
in
the
southern
philippines
for
example
power
producers
lost
about
million
between
and
because
of
an
excess
capacity
of
coal
and
hydropower
according
to
icsc
gerry
arances
head
of
the
center
for
energy
ecology
and
development
a
think
tank
said
it
was
clear
the
government
had
not
promoted
a
level
playing
field
for
all
kinds
of
energy
sources
particularly
on
renewable
energy
we
are
locked
into
a
energy
system
that
is
more
expensive
than
solar
arances
added
villagers
like
castro
say
they
can
not
afford
to
put
up
their
own
solar
panels
so
they
remain
reliant
on
the
main
power
grid
for
electricity
frederick
epistola
a
retail
seller
of
solar
panels
said
there
is
not
much
demand
for
solar
panels
among
homeowners
the
market
is
curious
about
shifting
to
solar
power
but
they
don
t
want
to
shell
out
the
capital
expenses
required
to
put
up
solar
panels
in
their
residences
it
can
still
be
expensive
for
the
typical
household
