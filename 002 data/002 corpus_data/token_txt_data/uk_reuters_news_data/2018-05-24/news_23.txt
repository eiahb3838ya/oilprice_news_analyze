european utility power struggle goes to the wire in brazil
may
reuters
a
bitter
feud
over
a
brazilian
power
grid
operator
has
taken
a
global
rivalry
to
new
levels
as
europe
s
top
two
utilities
ready
bids
for
eletropaulo
brazil
s
biggest
power
distributor
became
one
of
the
world
s
most
prized
power
assets
last
month
when
italy
s
enel
and
spain
s
iberdrola
locked
horns
in
a
country
both
see
as
key
to
expansion
virtually
doubling
its
value
overnight
although
enel
outdid
iberdrola
in
an
early
skirmish
with
a
reais
per
share
bid
for
eletropaulo
best
offers
are
due
on
thursday
in
a
complex
bidding
process
with
sources
close
to
the
auction
saying
there
could
be
room
to
raise
the
bar
shares
in
eletropaulo
which
has
a
market
value
of
billion
reais
billion
stood
at
reais
on
thursday
indicating
the
market
expected
higher
offers
we
are
ready
to
keep
on
participating
in
the
process
but
for
strategic
reasons
i
can
t
tell
you
to
which
point
the
chairman
of
iberdrola
s
brazil
unit
neoenergia
mario
jose
said
last
week
earlier
this
month
neoenergia
agreed
debt
issuance
of
billion
reais
billion
and
got
consent
from
its
main
shareholders
to
make
new
offers
for
eletropaulo
meanwhile
enel
which
generates
more
than
percent
of
its
earnings
in
south
america
is
said
to
have
financial
firepower
of
up
to
billion
euros
for
acquisitions
but
the
price
tag
has
left
some
investors
concerned
the
utilities
could
be
overpaying
despite
obvious
synergies
with
their
other
businesses
in
latin
america
s
most
populous
country
brazil
s
power
company
energisa
sa
dropped
out
of
the
race
in
may
while
sources
said
cpfl
the
brazilian
power
group
owned
by
china
state
grid
corp
gave
up
to
focus
on
other
assets
deeming
the
price
too
rich
the
aggressive
bidding
surprised
me
given
their
rivalry
in
spain
it
looks
to
me
like
this
might
have
become
a
question
of
principle
roberto
lottici
fund
manager
at
ifigest
and
an
enel
shareholder
said
the
chilean
minority
shareholders
of
enel
s
americas
unit
have
said
they
oppose
the
takeover
and
are
not
happy
with
the
idea
of
enel
americas
financing
the
potential
deal
enel
which
controls
spanish
utility
endesa
is
competing
with
iberdrola
in
spain
and
latin
america
and
recently
another
front
opened
in
italy
the
in
brazil
has
frayed
tempers
further
leading
iberdrola
to
write
to
the
european
commission
in
april
alleging
enel
was
taking
investment
decisions
it
would
not
be
able
to
do
were
it
not
brazil
is
a
strategic
market
for
iberdrola
it
helped
drive
a
percent
rise
in
core
profits
in
the
first
quarter
and
will
absorb
a
fifth
of
a
billion
euro
investment
plan
to
buying
eletropaulo
would
boost
its
client
base
in
the
country
to
more
than
million
with
km
of
grid
for
enel
a
deal
would
nearly
double
its
brazilian
client
base
to
million
europe
s
biggest
utility
which
last
year
bought
brazilian
power
distributor
for
million
said
in
april
it
was
keen
to
grow
in
the
country
last
week
a
source
told
reuters
that
enel
would
look
at
any
assets
of
portugal
s
edp
which
is
the
subject
of
a
bid
by
china
three
gorges
after
a
breakup
of
the
utility
which
has
generation
and
distribution
in
brazil
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
said
in
a
recent
report
that
despite
high
multiples
an
eletropaulo
deal
could
be
percent
accretive
for
enel
by
but
percent
for
iberdrola
due
to
the
geographical
proximity
of
assets
brazil
is
the
third
biggest
electricity
producer
in
the
americas
with
strong
growth
potential
and
energy
consumption
is
set
to
grow
percent
by
the
latest
bp
energy
outlook
report
says
after
years
of
and
government
interference
brazil
has
taken
steps
to
improve
regulation
and
investor
returns
to
attract
utilities
to
help
upgrade
its
infrastructure
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the
average
duration
of
a
blackout
on
the
grid
was
minutes
compared
to
minutes
in
italy
that
s
a
lot
of
revenue
that
can
be
recouped
just
by
streamlining
the
grid
the
source
said
thursday
is
the
last
day
for
offers
from
enel
and
iberdrola
ahead
of
registration
on
june
unless
that
is
a
new
investor
appears
in
which
case
everybody
will
be
allowed
to
raise
bids
at
a
june
auction
