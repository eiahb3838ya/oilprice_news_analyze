the

came
even
after
north

followed
through
on
a

meanwhile
some

interpreted
trump
s
message
with
caution
the

is
expressing
its
disappointment
but
this
is
a
tantrum

michael
antonelli
managing
director

trading
at

baird
in
milwaukee
markets
had
plenty
more
to
digest
including
minutes
from
the
latest
fed
and
ecb
meetings
but
in
asian
and
european
trading
it
was
plans
to
investigate
auto
imports
that
caused
the
biggest
moves
what
we
are
seeing
is
a
little
more
broad
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
trump
administration
not
just
on
north
korea
but
on
trade

trump
on
wednesday
ordered
a
national
security
probe
into
car
and
truck
imports
that
could
lead
to
new
tariffs
with
china
calling
the
move
an
abuse
of
the
clauses
and
saying
it
would
defend
its
interests
japan

the

it
weakened

the

surrendering
most
