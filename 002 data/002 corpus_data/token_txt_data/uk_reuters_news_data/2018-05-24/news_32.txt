copenhagen
may
reuters
the
united
states
is
leading
an
initiative
with
several
other
governments
to
promote
nuclear
power
and
encourage
investment
in
new
nuclear
technologies
the
initiative
launched
on
thursday
by
deputy
secretary
of
energy
dan
brouillette
with
international
partners
aims
to
highlight
the
value
of
nuclear
energy
as
a
clean
reliable
energy
source
the
partners
are
japan
canada
russia
south
africa
the
united
arab
emirates
poland
argentina
and
romania
the
nuclear
industry
is
battling
competition
particularly
from
natural
gas
while
many
national
governments
want
to
reduce
their
dependency
on
the
energy
source
after
the
nuclear
accident
at
japan
s
fukushima
plant
in
the
group
of
nations
aims
to
promote
areas
such
as
improved
power
system
integration
and
the
development
of
technologies
like
hybrid
systems
systems
could
link
nuclear
power
plants
with
variable
renewables
like
solar
or
wind
farms
and
could
allow
nuclear
power
to
backstop
intermittent
generation
brouillette
said
during
the
launch
at
the
clean
energy
ministerial
cem
in
copenhagen
cem
is
a
global
forum
of
countries
and
the
european
union
which
together
account
for
percent
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
brouillette
said
the
initiative
would
also
focus
on
the
development
of
small
modular
reactors
smr
which
use
existing
or
new
nuclear
technology
scaled
down
to
a
fraction
of
the
size
of
larger
plants
and
would
be
able
to
produce
around
a
tenth
of
the
electricity
created
by
projects
critics
say
smr
economies
of
scale
will
be
limited
because
each
reactor
will
need
its
own
control
and
safety
systems
they
also
point
to
the
danger
of
spreading
radioactive
material
more
widely
increasing
radiation
and
security
risks
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
also
launched
an
alliance
with
norway
and
saudi
arabia
to
boost
public
and
private
partnerships
on
carbon
capture
utilisation
and
storage
ccus
earlier
this
month
japan
released
a
draft
of
an
updated
basic
energy
policy
leaving
its
ideal
mix
of
power
sources
for
in
line
with
targets
set
three
years
ago
despite
criticism
that
it
placed
too
much
emphasis
on
unpopular
nuclear
power
