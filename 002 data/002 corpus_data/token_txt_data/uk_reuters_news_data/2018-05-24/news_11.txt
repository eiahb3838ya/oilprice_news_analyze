berlin
reuters
a
environmental
protection
agency
official
said
he
is
not
satisfied
with
volkswagen
s
efforts
to
improve
accountability
after
its
diesel
emissions
fraud
german
newspaper
handelsblatt
reported
on
thursday
the
vw
story
is
not
over
yet
not
for
vw
and
not
for
the
epa
the
business
daily
quoted
christopher
grundler
director
of
the
epa
s
office
of
transportation
and
air
quality
as
saying
soon
after
the
emissions
scandal
broke
in
september
the
german
automaker
pledged
to
reform
its
corporate
culture
seen
by
experts
as
a
factor
that
facilitated
the
cheating
and
become
a
more
transparent
business
but
some
senior
managers
including
previous
chief
executive
matthias
mueller
have
said
the
task
of
learning
from
past
mistakes
and
introducing
change
was
proving
harder
than
expected
as
some
managers
were
resisting
the
transformation
what
matters
to
the
epa
is
compliance
where
the
spirit
of
laws
is
respected
rather
than
just
the
text
of
the
law
i
absolutely
want
to
hear
from
vw
what
their
efforts
to
this
end
look
like
and
how
they
make
sure
that
such
a
thing
like
the
emissions
scandal
will
never
happen
again
grundler
said
handelsblatt
also
quoted
larry
thompson
the
monitor
appointed
under
the
plea
agreement
to
oversee
vw
for
three
years
as
saying
that
he
is
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
progress
of
culture
change
vw
on
thursday
said
thompson
s
findings
had
uncovered
a
need
for
action
to
establish
integrity
and
compliance
rules
across
the
group
as
it
struggles
to
overcome
the
dieselgate
scandal
earlier
this
week
vw
s
head
of
integrity
and
legal
affairs
hiltrud
werner
used
a
speech
in
washington
to
voice
her
frustration
that
some
staff
were
resisting
the
drive
for
openness
and
leadership
she
gave
an
example
of
commonly
received
pushback
well
that
diesel
scandal
was
kicked
off
in
technical
engineering
so
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
we
have
always
produced
products
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
we
didn
t
do
anything
everybody
needs
to
understand
why
it
should
affect
the
entire
company
