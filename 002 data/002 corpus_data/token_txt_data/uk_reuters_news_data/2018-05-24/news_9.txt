vienna
reuters
iran
continues
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
its
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
despite
the
withdrawal
but
could
be
faster
and
more
proactive
in
allowing
snap
inspections
the
atomic
watchdog
policing
the
accord
said
on
thursday
in
its
first
such
report
since
president
donald
trump
announced
washington
s
pullout
on
may
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
said
iran
remained
within
limits
on
the
level
to
which
it
can
enrich
uranium
its
stock
of
enriched
uranium
and
other
items
but
the
iaea
seemed
to
rebuke
iran
for
dragging
its
feet
on
complementary
access
inspections
under
the
agency
s
additional
protocol
which
iran
is
implementing
under
the
deal
such
inspections
are
often
carried
out
at
short
notice
the
agency
has
conducted
complementary
accesses
under
the
additional
protocol
to
all
the
sites
and
locations
in
iran
which
it
needed
to
visit
the
iaea
said
in
a
confidential
report
that
was
sent
to
member
states
and
obtained
by
reuters
timely
and
proactive
cooperation
by
iran
in
providing
such
access
would
facilitate
implementation
of
the
additional
protocol
and
enhance
confidence
it
said
the
report
came
with
france
britain
and
germany
scrambling
to
salvage
the
deal
s
core
bargain
of
sanctions
relief
in
exchange
for
restrictions
on
tehran
s
atomic
activities
trump
is
reimposing
sanctions
against
tehran
threatening
to
scupper
the
deal
and
prompt
iranian
retaliation
the
iaea
has
repeatedly
defended
the
deal
saying
it
created
the
world
s
most
robust
verification
regime
speaking
at
a
news
conference
with
russian
leader
vladimir
putin
in
saint
petersburg
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
the
report
went
in
the
right
direction
and
was
comforting
diplomats
who
follow
the
agency
said
an
inspection
last
month
went
down
to
the
wire
but
a
senior
diplomat
also
familiar
with
the
iaea
s
work
said
on
thursday
the
report
was
not
taking
iran
to
task
there
was
no
problem
it
s
just
an
encouragement
the
iaea
wants
to
make
sure
that
there
won
t
be
any
problem
he
said
adding
that
there
had
been
no
change
in
iranian
behaviour
either
over
the
first
quarter
of
or
since
trump
s
announcement
trump
sees
various
flaws
in
the
deal
including
that
many
of
its
restrictions
lapse
over
time
and
that
it
does
not
address
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
its
role
in
regional
conflicts
like
the
wars
in
syria
and
yemen
some
western
companies
such
as
french
oil
giant
total
have
already
said
they
may
have
to
quit
iran
because
of
the
move
senior
officials
from
the
other
countries
that
signed
the
deal
france
britain
germany
russia
china
and
iran
are
meeting
in
vienna
on
friday
to
discuss
next
steps
at
a
meeting
with
the
european
union
s
foreign
policy
chief
in
brussels
last
week
the
french
british
and
german
foreign
ministers
pledged
to
preserve
the
deal
by
trying
to
keep
iran
s
oil
and
investment
flowing
but
acknowledged
they
would
struggle
to
provide
the
guarantees
tehran
seeks
iran
s
supreme
leader
set
out
a
series
of
conditions
on
wednesday
for
iran
to
stay
in
the
deal
including
that
european
banks
should
safeguard
trade
with
the
islamic
republic
