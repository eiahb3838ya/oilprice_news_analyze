the

some

i
think
this
is
a

gamesmanship
that

plenty
more
to
digest

minutes
from

meetings
but
in
asian
and
european
trading
it
was
plans
to
investigate
auto
imports
that
caused
the
biggest
moves
trump
on
wednesday
ordered
a
national
security
probe
into
car
and
truck
imports
that
could
lead
to
new
tariffs

china
calling
the

an
abuse

it

defend
its
