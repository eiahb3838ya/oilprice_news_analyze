update 3-eu ends antitrust case against gazprom without fines
brussels
reuters
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
clinched
a
deal
with
eu
antitrust
regulators
on
thursday
to
reform
its
pricing
structure
and
allow
rivals
a
foothold
in
eastern
europe
avoiding
fines
in
a
case
that
has
dragged
on
for
seven
years
europe
s
competition
enforcer
said
gazprom
s
concessions
allay
concerns
of
market
abuse
ending
the
eu
s
longest
running
antitrust
saga
that
began
with
dawn
raids
at
offices
in
countries
in
the
eu
s
decision
to
accept
gazprom
s
offer
has
allowed
it
to
escape
fines
of
as
much
as
percent
of
its
global
turnover
an
outcome
that
has
angered
poland
and
eastern
eu
countries
which
have
sought
a
tougher
line
from
brussels
the
outlines
of
the
settlement
were
mapped
out
more
than
a
year
ago
and
finalised
earlier
this
year
as
reuters
previously
reported
but
it
was
delayed
by
critical
feedback
from
several
of
the
eight
member
states
in
the
east
at
the
centre
of
the
case
all
countries
formerly
dominated
by
moscow
many
are
angered
by
the
move
to
smooth
business
ties
with
gazprom
run
by
alexei
miller
an
ally
of
russian
president
vladimir
putin
contrasting
it
with
hefty
fines
against
multinationals
such
as
tech
giant
google
it
s
a
pity
lithuania
s
prime
minister
saulius
skvernelis
said
of
the
decision
not
to
fine
gazprom
but
still
it
s
a
step
forward
he
told
reporters
in
vilnius
europe
s
competition
commissioner
margrethe
vestager
said
the
decision
provides
a
rulebook
for
gazprom
s
future
conduct
this
case
is
not
about
the
flag
of
the
company
it
is
about
achieving
the
outcome
that
best
serves
european
consumers
and
businesses
she
stressed
gazprom
has
denied
the
charges
which
concerned
the
three
baltic
states
bulgaria
hungary
poland
slovakia
and
the
czech
republic
deputy
chief
executive
alexander
medvedev
said
gazprom
was
satisfied
calling
the
decision
the
most
reasonable
outcome
for
the
of
the
entire
european
gas
under
the
deal
gazprom
will
allow
clients
to
ask
for
lower
prices
when
these
diverge
from
benchmarks
such
as
western
european
gas
market
hubs
scrapping
its
old
system
of
linking
them
to
oil
prices
they
may
seek
price
reviews
every
two
years
and
go
to
arbitration
if
a
no
deal
is
agreed
within
days
the
russian
gas
export
monopoly
will
remove
contractual
constraints
which
prevent
clients
from
reselling
its
gas
in
markets
isolated
by
a
lack
of
pipeline
infrastructure
gazprom
will
give
customers
the
right
to
change
gas
delivery
points
swaps
will
apply
for
contracts
of
at
least
months
at
fixed
delivery
fees
including
for
relatively
small
amounts
of
gas
and
at
short
notice
of
just
over
four
months
in
the
countries
we
are
talking
about
gazprom
is
still
a
dominant
player
vestager
said
in
bulgaria
which
is
nearly
wholly
dependent
on
gazprom
supplies
the
transmission
network
operator
will
gain
greater
control
over
gas
flows
moscow
also
offered
not
to
seek
damages
from
the
balkan
nation
over
the
cancellation
of
the
planned
south
stream
pipeline
under
the
black
sea
many
of
gazprom
s
concessions
are
in
line
with
changes
in
its
marketing
strategy
away
from
contracts
to
which
the
eu
objected
as
a
sea
change
in
the
gas
market
has
eroded
its
dominance
europe
faces
slower
growth
it
has
greater
access
to
alternative
energy
sources
such
as
liquefied
natural
gas
and
coal
renewables
are
on
the
rise
and
the
eu
is
moving
to
make
the
market
more
liquid
with
new
regulation
and
infrastructure
furthermore
and
eu
sanctions
over
russia
s
role
in
the
ukraine
crisis
have
curtailed
gazprom
s
investment
plans
the
market
has
turned
into
the
buyer
s
market
one
senior
gazprom
source
told
reuters
failure
to
live
up
to
its
promises
could
still
earn
gazprom
a
fine
over
the
next
eight
years
by
the
time
the
deal
expires
vestager
predicted
changes
in
europe
s
gas
market
will
have
broken
gazprom
s
hold
on
the
market
in
eight
years
time
we
will
have
another
gas
market
