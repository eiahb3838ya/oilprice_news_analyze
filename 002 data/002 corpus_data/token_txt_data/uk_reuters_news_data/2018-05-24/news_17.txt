the
head
of
ukraine
s
naftogaz
said
on
thursday
talks
over
future
russian
gas
transit
via
the
country
to
europe
must
include
gazprom
and
must
be
based
on
firm
commitments
commenting
on
an
invitation
from
the
bloc
to
relaunch
trilateral
gas
talks
naftogaz
chief
andriy
kobolev
voiced
doubts
over
russia
s
willingness
to
engage
in
serious
talks
he
said
russia
s
energy
minister
has
agreed
to
the
talks
but
not
gazprom
for
the
success
of
the
talks
it
is
important
to
have
gazprom
in
the
room
kobolev
told
reuters
in
brussels
i
am
struggling
to
understand
what
outcome
we
are
trying
to
achieve
because
from
what
i
know
they
are
not
ready
to
give
any
russian
president
vladimir
putin
said
on
friday
that
moscow
was
ready
for
talks
with
ukraine
on
continued
gas
transits
after
their
contract
expires
in
following
talks
with
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
last
week
russia
s
gazprom
and
five
european
companies
with
german
backing
plan
to
build
the
north
stream
gas
pipeline
on
the
baltic
seabed
to
connect
russia
directly
with
germany
the
pipeline
bypassing
eastern
europe
would
allow
gazprom
to
reduce
gas
flows
through
ukraine
costing
it
valuable
transit
revenue
kobolev
added
that
the
eu
s
decision
to
settle
its
antitrust
case
with
gazprom
on
thursday
would
not
bring
any
positive
market
changes
saying
the
commitments
were
too
vague
it
seems
gazprom
is
getting
away
with
everything
