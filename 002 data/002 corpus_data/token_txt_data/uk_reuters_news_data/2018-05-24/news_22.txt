london

thomson
reuters
foundation
canadian
scientists
have
collaborated
with
hong
kong
climate
campaigners
to
create
dumplings
in
the
hope
of
persuading
the
world
s
biggest
carnivores
to
stop
pigging
out
china
eats
more
meat
than
any
other
nation
twice
the
amount
consumed
by
americans
alone
and
a
campaigning
hong
kong
business
is
launching
a
more
sustainable
diet
that
it
says
has
less
impact
on
global
warming
but
all
of
the
taste
just
to
tell
people
what
not
to
do
is
not
going
to
solve
the
problem
you
ve
got
to
give
them
alternatives
david
yeung
founder
of
green
monday
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
climate
change
water
scarcity
food
insecurity
these
are
mega
giant
problems
the
easiest
way
to
help
the
planet
is
to
reduce
meat
consumption
the
business
founder
said
green
monday
was
founded
in
as
a
social
enterprise
a
business
with
a
mission
to
benefit
society
as
well
as
turn
a
profit
it
will
launch
omnipork
at
its
six
green
common
foodstores
all
in
hong
kong
at
the
beginning
of
june
it
is
the
latest
product
aimed
at
carnivores
open
to
ethical
alternatives
with
less
environmental
fallout
scientists
attribute
nearly
percent
of
global
greenhouse
gases
to
meat
production
the
industry
is
the
largest
driver
of
global
environmental
change
due
to
feed
production
land
use
and
methane
emissions
according
to
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
china
consumes
a
lot
more
meat
than
any
other
country
people
ate
about
million
tonnes
of
pork
beef
and
poultry
in
about
twice
as
much
as
the
united
states
according
to
government
estimates
omnipork
is
the
first
food
product
from
green
monday
which
campaigns
for
people
to
ditch
meat
at
least
once
a
week
made
of
shiitake
mushroom
rice
and
pea
protein
the
new
food
will
initially
only
be
available
in
prepared
dishes
such
as
dumplings
and
a
traditional
asian
dish
of
dan
dan
noodles
as
well
as
running
grocery
stores
the
social
enterprise
has
an
online
directory
of
restaurants
with
vegetarian
menus
and
has
invested
in
beyond
meat
a
firm
that
produces
a
burger
made
from
plants
yeung
said
it
took
canadian
food
scientists
about
months
to
achieve
the
right
texture
moistness
and
taste
that
means
the
product
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
real
pork
nearly
three
quarters
of
consumers
globally
are
limiting
or
avoiding
meat
altogether
according
to
globaldata
a
data
analysis
company
that
surveyed
nearly
people
in
countries
including
china
the
shift
toward
foods
is
being
driven
by
millennials
who
are
most
likely
to
consider
the
food
source
animal
welfare
issues
and
environmental
impacts
