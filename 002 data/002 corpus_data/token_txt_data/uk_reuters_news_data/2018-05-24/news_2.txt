nuclear
power
generators
are
sticking
with
plans
to
shut
several
reactors
after
none
of
them
won
the
right
to
supply
capacity
in
an
auction
by
the
country
s
largest
power
grid
despite
higher
winning
prices
energy
companies
and
analysts
said
on
thursday
major
nuclear
power
providers
including
exelon
corp
and
firstenergy
solutions
bid
in
an
annual
auction
held
this
month
by
grid
operator
pjm
interconnection
to
make
sure
there
is
enough
resources
available
for
upcoming
years
this
year
s
auction
which
was
awarded
on
wednesday
came
to
billion
for
the
june
delivery
year
said
pjm
which
controls
the
grid
in
and
midwest
states
last
year
s
auction
fetched
billion
in
recent
years
natural
gas
has
become
the
nation
s
dominant
provider
of
power
generation
with
nuclear
and
coal
slipping
because
of
elevated
costs
for
those
fuels
nuclear
and
coal
operators
have
said
they
want
to
see
additional
subsidies
and
market
rule
changes
to
allow
them
to
keep
operating
as
they
provide
what
is
known
as
generation
power
available
around
the
clock
this
auction
involves
bids
for
capacity
pjm
awards
the
capacity
to
the
generators
that
can
offer
the
lowest
cost
this
auction
produced
a
price
of
per
for
much
of
the
pjm
footprint
compared
with
last
year
that
figure
was
still
too
low
for
some
of
exelon
and
firstenergy
s
plants
those
operators
are
looking
to
washington
and
individual
states
for
relief
to
keep
operating
exelon
the
biggest
operator
of
nuclear
power
plants
said
after
the
auction
that
it
still
planned
to
shut
its
three
mile
island
reactor
in
pennsylvania
in
october
and
the
oyster
creek
plant
in
new
jersey
this
october
oyster
creek
did
not
participate
in
the
auction
firstenergy
solutions
a
bankrupt
unit
of
firstenergy
corp
said
the
auction
had
no
impact
on
its
operations
the
company
said
in
march
it
planned
to
retire
the
perry
and
nuclear
plants
in
ohio
and
beaver
valley
in
pennsylvania
in
and
one
megawatt
can
power
about
homes
while
the
auction
was
tough
on
nuclear
reactors
it
was
a
boon
to
energy
companies
that
burn
gas
and
coal
to
generate
power
like
nrg
energy
inc
and
vistra
energy
corp
which
both
saw
their
shares
rise
by
nearly
percent
on
thursday
exelon
and
firstenergy
both
said
they
will
continue
to
work
with
federal
and
state
officials
and
pjm
on
broader
market
reforms
that
could
keep
some
reactors
from
shutting
now
more
than
ever
we
need
federal
regional
and
state
policymakers
to
urgently
take
action
to
preserve
the
benefits
that
our
nation
s
largest
and
most
resilient
source
of
energy
provides
to
our
customers
kathleen
barr√≥n
exelon
s
senior
vice
president
of
government
and
regulatory
affairs
and
public
policy
said
in
a
statement
nuclear
operators
have
complained
that
the
way
energy
prices
are
set
in
pjm
does
not
compensate
them
for
their
contribution
to
grid
resiliency
and
their
ability
to
produce
large
amounts
of
carbon
free
energy
some
states
provide
subsidies
including
new
york
and
illinois
and
this
week
new
jersey
passed
a
bill
that
will
compensate
nuclear
operators
providing
power
to
the
state
resiliency
became
an
issue
after
energy
secretary
rick
perry
in
september
asked
federal
energy
regulators
to
adopt
rules
to
protect
fuel
secure
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
early
retirement
we
remain
skeptical
that
federal
or
state
subsidies
are
likely
but
we
re
more
optimistic
about
reforms
put
forward
by
pjm
said
katie
bays
an
energy
analyst
at
height
securities
in
washington
pjm
is
testing
the
resiliency
of
its
grid
and
is
also
developing
a
plan
that
could
change
the
way
the
market
compensates
generators
for
the
energy
they
produce
which
could
increase
revenues
for
both
coal
and
nuclear
plants
