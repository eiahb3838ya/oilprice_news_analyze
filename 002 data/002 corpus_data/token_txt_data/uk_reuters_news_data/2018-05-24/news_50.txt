s
oil
company
petrobras
on
wednesday
temporarily
cut
diesel
prices
by
percent
in
order
to
help
the
government
and
truck
drivers
resolve
a
protest
crippling
highways
the
surprise
decision
aimed
at
resolving
a
standoff
threatening
grains
exports
industrial
output
and
even
fuel
supply
at
airports
and
gas
stations
will
bring
immediate
relief
for
angry
truckers
but
raise
investor
concerns
about
government
interference

said
the
price
cut
which

only
remain
in
place
for
days
and
cost
the

about
million
reais
million
had
not
been
demanded
by
the

the
independence
of
petrobras
has
not
been
damaged
parente
said
at
a
news
conference
explaining
the
decision
it
was
an
exceptional
measure
and
does
not
represent
a
change
to
our
pricing
price
adjustments
at
petrobras
have
let
the
company
track
global
prices
and
turn
a
profit
on
fuel
sales
after
losing
money
for
years
at
the
government
s
insistence
part
of
a
turnaround
that
lifted

nearly
percent
since
the
pricing
policy
started
last
july
while
petrobras
price
cut
brings
momentary
relief
to
truckers
policymakers
struggled
to
reach
a
more
lasting
accord
during
talks
with
the
drivers
representatives
in
brasilia
who
threatened
to
extend
their
protests
into

not
immediately
respond

approved
the

the
government
and

since
they
began
partially
blocking

in
several

on
monday
to
protest

prices

had
called
for
a
type
of

two
or
three
days

find
a
satisfactory
solution
for
brazilians
