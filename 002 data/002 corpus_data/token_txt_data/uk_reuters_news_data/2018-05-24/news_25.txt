iran
has
stayed
within
the
main
curbs
on
its
nuclear
activity
imposed
by
its
deal
with
major
powers
despite
the
pullout
from
the
pact
but
could
be
quicker
to
provide
extra
access
to
inspectors
the
atomic
watchdog
indicated
on
thursday
in
its
first
such
report
since
president
donald
trump
announced
washington
s
withdrawal
on
may
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
said
iran
had
complied
with
limits
on
the
level
to
which
it
can
enrich
uranium
its
stock
of
enriched
uranium
and
other
items
it
did
however
rebuke
iran
for
dragging
its
feet
over
complementary
access
inspections
under
the
iaea
s
additional
protocol
which
iran
is
implementing
under
the
deal
the
agency
has
conducted
complementary
accesses
under
the
additional
protocol
to
all
the
sites
and
locations
in
iran
which
it
needed
to
visit
the
iaea
said
in
a
confidential
report
that
was
sent
to
member
states
and
seen
by
reuters
timely
and
proactive
cooperation
by
iran
in
providing
such
access
would
facilitate
implementation
of
the
additional
protocol
and
enhance
confidence
it
said
the
report
came
with
france
britain
and
germany
scrambling
to
salvage
the
deal
s
core
bargain
of
sanctions
relief
in
exchange
for
restrictions
on
nuclear
fuel
production
trump
is
reimposing
sanctions
against
tehran
threatening
to
scupper
the
deal
and
prompt
iranian
retaliation
trump
sees
various
flaws
in
the
deal
including
that
many
of
its
restrictions
lapse
over
time
and
that
it
does
not
address
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
its
role
in
regional
conflicts
like
the
wars
in
syria
and
yemen
some
western
companies
like
french
oil
giant
total
have
already
said
they
may
have
to
quit
iran
because
of
the
move
senior
officials
from
the
other
countries
that
signed
the
deal
france
britain
germany
russia
china
and
iran
are
meeting
in
vienna
on
friday
to
discuss
next
steps
