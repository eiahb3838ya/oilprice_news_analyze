energy
corp

energy
inc
which
serve
about
million
electricity
customers
in
more
than
a
dozen
states
both
say
they
are
done
building
natural
power
plants
instead
they
are
building
large
solar
plants
which
offer
plentiful
and
inexpensive
electricity
this
bearish
view
of
energy
reflective
of
a
growing
acceptance
by
utilities
of
renewable
power
sources
poses
a
hurdle
to
john
flannery
s
plan
to
turn
around
general
electric
co
s
power
unit
ge
s
chief
executive
spelled
out
the
difficulty
on
wednesday
power
profits
will
be
flat
this
year
after
falling
percent
in
he
said
and
ge
is
planning
that
demand
for
natural
gas
power
plants
will
be
less
than
half
what
it
forecast
just
over
a
year
ago
and
will
stay
at
that
level
through
new
plant
sales
are
going
to
be
tough
flannery
said
at
an
investor
conference
on
wednesday
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
quick
fix
but
there
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
assets
here
with
intrinsic
economic
value
we
re
going
to
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
in
the
long
run
flannery
and
russell
stokes
the
head
of
ge
power
have
said
demand
for
electricity
and
natural
gas
power
generators
will
grow
about
percent
a
year
in
line
with
global
forecasts
as
utilities
make
a
gradual
transition
to
renewable
power
following
a
strategy
he
laid
out
in
november
flannery
is
cutting
jobs
and
billion
in
costs
at
the
unit
on
wednesday
he
said
ge
has
tripled
some
sales
incentives
in
the
power
division
and
is
competing
aggressively
for
new
contracts
to
maintain
plants
and
to
get
the
call
when
utilities
need
parts
or
repairs
during
an
unexpected
outage
something
of
which
ge
had
lost
sight
but
some
analysts
and
investors
are
skeptical
about
the
prospects
of
a
business
devoted
to
natural
gas
and
coal
power
plants
that
are
falling
out
of
favor
with
utilities
the
competition
from
solar
and
wind
along
with
abundant
gas
produced
by
fracking
is
curbing
orders
for
new
plants
and
forcing
the
closure
of
old
ones
some
utilities
are
even
filing
for
bankruptcy
that
means
companies
are
going
to
have
trouble
selling
new
plants
said
mark
dyson
a
principal
at
the
rocky
mountain
institute
an
organization
that
researches
the
power
industry
over
years
ge
has
weathered
ups
and
downs
in
power
market
before
and
has
legions
of
sales
and
service
people
around
the
world
last
year
it
booked
orders
for
its
newest
gas
turbines
in
mexico
bangladesh
and
elsewhere
it
is
investing
in
its
separate
renewables
unit
focused
on
wind
and
hydro
which
saw
revenue
fall
percent
last
year
ge

battery
storage
software

sales
fell
percent
in
the
first
quarter
accelerating
from
a
percent
drop
last
year
according
to
ge
s
earnings
reports
ge
s
performance
reflects
the
broader
trend
of
utilities
shifting
to
renewables
from
fossil
fuels
global
sales
of
large
natural
gas
power
plants
have
fallen
by
half
since
according
to
mccoy
power
reports
coal
and
plants
accounted
for
just
percent
of
new
electricity
capacity
financed
globally
last
year

corp
the
unit
said
in
an
interview
there
are
fewer
large
units
being
sold
globally
than
there
were
five
years
ago
i
don
t
see
that
changing
dramatically
going
siemens
is
cutting
power
and
gas
jobs
to
adjust
many
utilities
share
the
view
that
the
shift
is
permanent
because
it
is
driven
by
economics
rather
than
government
policy
and
concerns
while
conventional
power
plants
will
continue
to
be
built
sales
may
never
reach
the
levels
seen
just
two
years
ago
industry
experts
said
with
electricity
prices
trending
downward
utilities
are
increasingly
unwilling
to
risk
capital
on
a
new
plant
unless
then
can
lock
in
a
price
executives
said
building
new
large
gas
plants
is
challenging
without
the
stability
of
a
power
contract
said
timothy
menzie

executive
officer
of
intergen

international

generation
company
ge
faces
a
further
challenge

of

but
as
