wizz
air
sees
profit
soaring
again
this
year
as
bigger
more
efficient
planes
help
it
to
keep
costs
down
putting
it
on
course
to
outshine
larger
rival
ryanair
which
is
more
pessimistic
about
prospects
wizz
which
mainly
serves
passengers
in
central
and
eastern
europe
said
on
thursday
that
profit
could
climb
as
much
as
percent
in
the
months
to
the
end
of
next
march
boosting
its
shares
by
percent
by
contrast
europe
s
biggest
low
cost
airline
ryanair
said
this
week
that
its
profits
would
fall
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
hit
by
higher
fuel
and
staffing
costs
and
flat
fares
wizz
air
is
also
expecting
labour
costs
to
rise
this
year
but
said
the
growing
proportion
of
airbus
aircraft
in
its
fleet
gave
it
an
advantage
as
the
planes
were
more
fuel
efficient
and
carried
more
passengers
overall
it
was
guiding
for
costs
excluding
fuel
to
fall
by
percent
that
is
a
significantly
different
position
from
our
competitors
you
are
seeing
cost
creep
with
all
of
them
wizz
chief
executive
jozsef
varadi
told
reuters
for
the
months
to
march
wizz
reported
net
profit
of
million
euros
million
a
percent
jump
on
the
year
before
overall
this
is
a
very
positive
outlook
goodbody
analysts
said
all
airlines
are
facing
higher
fuel
costs
because
the
price
of
crude
oil
has
climbed
to
above
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
november
wizz
said
it
was
confident
it
could
pass
on
the
rise
to
customers
and
even
saw
benefits
from
the
impact
of
a
high
fuel
price
environment
that
will
put
pressure
on
the
weak
performing
airlines
and
almost
all
of
central
and
eastern
europe
s
incumbent
national
carriers
perform
very
vulnerably
with
no
profitability
and
no
liquidity
so
we
will
see
what
happens
to
them
varadi
told
investors
wizz
like
its
larger
rivals
ryanair
and
easyjet
aims
to
steal
market
share
when
the
oil
price
rises
and
carriers
are
forced
to
withdraw
unprofitable
capacity
from
the
market
last
year
capacity
left
the
market
when
uk
airline
monarch
collapsed
allowing
wizz
to
expand
in
britain
when
it
bought
slots
that
became
available
at
london
s
luton
airport
when
asked
about
wizz
s
interest
in
norwegian
a
budget
carrier
which
has
needed
to
raise
funds
to
shore
up
its
balance
sheet
and
has
rejected
two
approaches
from
iag
varadi
said
his
company
would
remain
opportunistic
we
don
t
know
what
s
going
to
happen
to
norwegian
but
if
that
creates
capacity
opportunities
for
us
one
way
or
another
then
yes
we
would
certainly
consider
it
he
said
highlighting
wizz
s
monarch
deal
as
an
example
of
what
was
possible
