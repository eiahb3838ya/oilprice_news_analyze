that

could
prompt

the

may
decide
in

to
lift

to
make
up
for

which
was
stung
by
the
decision

told

russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
production
cuts
could
be
eased
softly
if
opec
and
countries
see
the
oil
market
balancing
in

the
interfax
news
agency
reported
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
a
common
position
on
the
future
of
the

the

would
stay
in
place
for
now
russia
s
lukoil
said
the
deal
should
remain
in
place
but
needs
to
be
altered
we
still
believe
that
a
production
increase
will
still
be
forthcoming
that
will
become
official
at
next
month
s
opec
meeting
jim
ritterbusch
president
of

associates
said
in
a
note
in
the
meantime
even
the
slightest
suggestion
of
such
a
decision
especially
from
the
saudis
could
force

venezuela
s
output
has
fallen
to
about
million
barrels
per

according

opec
secondary

as
its
economic
crisis
grows
and
pdvsa
struggles
to
pay
debts
and
fund

supply
concerns
have
pushed

with

for
the
first
time
since

opec

vienna
next

previously
agreed
to
curb

by
about
million
bpd
to
boost
prices
and
clear
a
supply
glut
global
inventories
have
been
broadly
falling
even
as

risen
the
united

in

produced
million
bpd
a
record
oil
futures
also
fell
as

participants
took
profits
ahead
of
the

it
just
feels
like
reducing

called

a

kim
jong
un
over
that

s
nuclear

should
have
pressured
oil
prices
but
the
comments
weakened
the
dollar
which
supported
crude
commerzbank

said
a
weaker

makes

less
expensive
for
