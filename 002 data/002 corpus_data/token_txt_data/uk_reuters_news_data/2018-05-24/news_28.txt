looking

by
the
two
firms

agreed
to
swap
percent
of
its
norway
assets
for
percent
of
a
section
of
gazprom
s
urengoy
gas
field
but
norway
is
not
happy
with
that
plan
because
it
would
give
the
russian
company
access
to
its
continental
shelf
the
norwegian
energy
minister
told
reuters
last
week
the
swap
deal
was
meant
to
close
by
but
still
has
not
been
finalised
omv
has
said
it
now
expects
closure
by
saying
talks
are
being
complicated
by
corporate
governance
issues
in
recent
talks
the
two
companies
discussed
several
options
including
cancelling
the
swap
for
an
outright
payment
one
source
familiar
with
the
talks
said
there
are
different
options
including
this
one
the
source
said
about
the
possibility
of
payments
by
omv
another
source
also
familiar
with
the
talks
said
that

may
buy
gazprom
assets
in
siberia
instead
of
swapping
for
them
omv
and
gazprom
declined
to
comment
omv
chief
executive
rainer
seele
told
the
company
s
annual
shareholder
meeting
on
tuesday
that
talks
with
gazprom
were
ongoing
and
that
omv
remained
confident
that
it
could
close
the
asset
swap
deal
by
the
end
of
the
year
with
the
deal
austria
s
largest
energy
group
aimed
to
replenish
its
weakening
reserves
with
access
to
oil
and
gas
fields
while
the
russian
gas
giant
hoped
to
benefit
from
diversifying
its
geographic
footprint
omv
is
now
in
a
stronger
financial
position
than
it
was
in
and
can
easily
afford
to
buy
the
assets
avoiding
potential
trouble
with
the
norwegian
government
omv
has
announced
plans
to
spend
billion
euros
on

so
far
spent
