afghanistan's 30-year pipe dream could bring power, industry

afghanistan
is
pressing
ahead
with
plans
to
turn
natural
gas
from
an
pipeline
into
economic
development
with
projects
ranging
from
fertilizer
plants
to
power
generation
but
first
it
needs
to
start
construction
the
tapi
pipeline
named
after
the
countries
involved
turkmenistan
afghanistan
pakistan
and
india
was
first
proposed
three
decades
ago
the
problem
of
crossing
afghanistan
is
a
major
reason
it
has
not
been
built
surveying
work
is
finally
underway
in
afghanistan
s
western
province
of
herat
with
construction
planned
to
start
later
in
the
autumn
obstacles
loom
however
starting
with
convincing
donors
to
fund
afghanistan
s
percent
share
of
the
cost
and
attracting
private
investors
they
re
thinking
why
a
project
that
has
not
come
into
practice
will
be
able
to
fully
function
in
a
few
years
there
is
still
that
resistance
that
maybe
we
will
not
be
able
to
implement
on
time
said
afghanistan
s
acting
minister
of
mines
and
petroleum
nargis
nehan
in
an
interview
the
taliban
militant
group
has
pledged
support
for
tapi
but
security
remains
a
concern
tapi
will
transport
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
a
year
along
an
km
mile
route
from
turkmenistan
s
galkynysh
the
world
s
gas
field
to
fazilka
in
northwest
india
afghanistan
s
share
billion
cubic
metres
annually
would
meet
a
huge
need
for
the
country
which
relies
on
imported
electricity
and
faces
frequent
power
shortages
the
asian
development
bank
adb
which
is
financing
afghanistan
s
contribution
to
tapi
s
cost
and
the
world
bank
are
conducting
for
kabul
a
feasibility
study
into
generating
electricity
from
the
gas
and
using
it
to
supply
fertilizer
and
petrochemical
plants
said
samuel
tumiwa
the
adb
s
country
director
a
gas
distribution
system
in
herat
afghanistan
s
city
could
also
pipe
gas
directly
to
homes
for
heating
and
generate
electricity
for
plants
to
process
juice
and
nuts
he
said
this
opens
up
the
possibility
of
herat
as
an
industrial
city
tumiwa
said
the
priority
of
afghanistan
s
power
utility
da
afghanistan
breshna
sherkat
dabs
is
producing
power
and
it
is
examining
where
it
should
build
a
power
plant
to
convert
tapi
gas
said
the
utility
s
chief
executive
officer
aman
ghalib
afghanistan
could
access
additional
gas
from
turkmenistan
during
the
early
years
of
tapi
s
operation
until
the
pipeline
extends
to
pakistan
and
india
ghalib
said
tapi
is
expected
to
start
carrying
gas
by
although
the
adb
s
tumiwa
said
a
later
start
was
more
realistic
to
utilize
the
gas
additional
infrastructure
from
gas
mains
to
feeder
lines
and
compression
stations
may
be
needed
tumiwa
said
those
costs
plus
afghanistan
s
share
of
capital
would
likely
come
from
international
donors
since
the
international
monetary
fund
restricts
borrowing
the
country
also
expects
to
collect
at
least
million
in
annual
transit
fees
kabul
hopes
to
attract
private
investment
possibly
including
foreign
fertilizer
companies
nehan
said
unlike
other
projects
in
afghanistan
tapi
will
immediately
generate
revenue
and
gas
when
it
starts
operating
she
said
this
is
a
project
where
we
see
a
very
immediate
return
from
investment
perspective
i
think
it
is
better
that
we
focus
on
