the

administration
this

will
begin
the
environmental
review
process
for
oil
and
gas
drilling
on
a
section
of
the
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
a
region
in
northern
alaska
rich
in
crude
but
prized
by
conservationists
in
a
notice
from
the
department
of
the
interior
seen
by
reuters
which
the
agency
will
post
on
friday
it
says
it
will
hold
meetings
in
five
alaskan
towns
where
the
public
can
speak
about
drilling
in
the
refuge
it
is
the
first
step
in
the
review
process
which
will
consider
proposed
seismic
testing
and
exploration
plans
the
tax
bill
passed
by
the
congress
late
last
year
allowed
the
interior
department
to
hold
two
lease
sales
in
part
of
the
in
when
congress
created
the
refuge
it
designated
the
area
as
a
part
on
the
refuge
s
coastal
plain
where
drilling
could
occur
in
the
future
the
first
lease
sale
could
occur
next
year
if
there
are
no
delays
alaskan
lawmakers
have
been
fighting
for
decades
to
open
the
refuge
and
the
latest
effort
was
led
by
republican
senator
lisa
murkowski
who
has
said
it
would
lead
to
jobs
and
increase
energy
security
conservationists
have
vowed
to
fight
the
opening
up
of
the
reserve
in
court
they
are
concerned
that
drilling
would
harm
sensitive
populations
of
migrating
birds
as
well
as
caribou
herds
that
gwich
in
native
people
depend
on
wilderness
society
president
jamie
williams
said
the
interior
department
is
pursuing
an
irresponsibly
aggressive
timeline
for
arctic
refuge
drilling
that
reflects
the
trump
administration
s
eagerness
to
turn
over
america
s
public
lands
to
private
industry
for
nobody
knows
how
much
oil
the
refuge
contains
but
the
geological
survey
estimated
in
that
the
area
held
about
billion
barrels
of
recoverable
crude
and
it
is
uncertain
how
much
interest
there
is
from
oil
companies
to
drill
in
the
remote
region
in
december
a
lease
sale
received
only
seven
bids
on
less
than
percent
of
the
million
acres
offered
in
the
national
petroleum
reserve
which
is
less
than
miles
km
from
the
refuge
conocophillips
alaska
inc
in
partnership
with
anadarko
petroleum
corp
submitted
the
seven
bids
still
analysts
at
british
bank
barclays
have
said
if
surveys
show
promising
deposits
the
refuge
could
attract
oil
producers
that
drill
in
frontier
regions
in
latin
america
and
the
middle
east
the
public
meetings
will
be
held
in
anchorage
arctic
village
fairbanks
kaktovik
and
utqiaÄ¡vik
the
dates
for
which
will
be
announced
later
the
interior
department
said
in
the
notice
more
meetings
could
be
held
if
there
is
strong
community
interest
