analysis-european utilities retrench as cross-border deals lose appeal
reuters
european
utility
companies
are
retrenching
in
their
home
markets
and
looking
to
unwind
mergers
deals
as
increasingly
nationalist
governments
balk
at
foreign
ownership
of
strategic
power
supplies
hungary
was
one
of
the
first
european
countries
to
turn
against
foreign
ownership
of
utilities
back
in
but
there
are
growing
signs
that
borders
are
springing
up
again
in
an
industry
that
has
struggled
to
make
international
deals
pay
off
several
european
utilities
were
lining
up
to
buy
german
utility
rwe
s
subsidiary
innogy
but
in
march
rwe
and
domestic
rival
agreed
to
carve
up
the
renewable
energy
firm
themselves
in
an
deal
then
this
week
french
electricity
retailer
direct
energie
the
biggest
independent
challenger
to
market
leader
edf
went
to
french
energy
giant
total
in
another
deal
in
a
business
as
sovereign
and
strategic
as
utilities
it
is
hard
to
see
major
deals
materializing
in
today
s
europe
said
a
banker
in
paris
who
has
worked
on
mergers
and
acquisitions
m
a
in
the
utilities
sector
bankers
say
the
german
deal
hammered
out
within
two
months
was
partly
aimed
at
keeping
innogy
s
prized
assets
out
of
foreign
hands
and
the
backlash
against
foreign
owners
is
now
fuelling
speculation
some
big
deals
may
be
unwound
edf
s
italian
energy
subsidiary
edison
the
power
producer
in
italy
is
seen
as
a
prime
example
of
a
legacy
investment
ripe
for
unwinding
edison
s
oil
and
gas
activities
no
longer
fit
edf
s
strategy
and
its
prospects
of
winning
retail
market
share
from
enel
in
which
the
italian
state
has
a
percent
stake
look
limited
the
italians
have
never
accepted
that
edison
is
no
longer
italian
said
the
paris
banker
adding
that
the
firm
s
growth
outlook
in
italy
would
always
be
constrained
by
its
french
ownership
sources
told
reuters
this
month
that
edison
had
selected
banks
to
sell
its
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
division
joining
other
utility
firms
that
have
sold
off
hydrocarbon
assets
as
they
grapple
with
sluggish
energy
demand
low
wholesale
prices
and
a
surge
in
cleaner
renewable
energy
spain
s
endesa
is
another
asset
owned
by
a
foreign
utility
seen
as
a
potential
candidate
for
resale
italy
s
enel
europe
s
biggest
utility
outbid
for
endesa
in
during
a
spate
of
european
utility
mergers
while
enel
which
owns
percent
of
endesa
has
denied
it
has
plans
to
sell
its
control
has
drawn
criticism
from
spanish
politicians
who
say
endesa
is
not
investing
enough
locally
and
pays
too
much
in
dividends
to
its
owners
enel
chief
executive
francesco
starace
acknowledged
nationalism
was
having
an
impact
on
utilities
m
a
in
europe
there
is
some
but
i
don
t
think
europe
s
big
countries
can
afford
to
be
nationalistic
because
they
would
need
really
deep
pockets
to
keep
these
companies
off
their
markets
he
told
reuters
edison
and
edf
declined
to
comment
the
spate
of
utility
takeovers
before
and
just
after
the
financial
crisis
came
as
countries
joined
the
european
union
in
its
biggest
enlargement
and
european
power
companies
saw
a
chance
to
become
regional
power
giants
spent
billion
euros
billion
on
foreign
assets
after
losing
the
battle
for
endesa
rwe
bought
britain
s
npower
edf
bought
edison
and
british
energy
france
s
engie
bought
britain
s
international
power
spain
s
iberdrola
bought
scottish
power
and
sweden
s
vattenfall
bought
dutch
nuon
energy
but
the
collapse
in
wholesale
power
prices
since
has
undermined
many
of
these
deals
engie
and
vattenfall
alone
have
written
a
combined
billion
euros
at
least
off
the
value
of
their
international
acquisitions
now
not
much
of
the
deal
euphoria
is
left
with
nationalists
in
power
in
hungary
poland
and
austria
and
parties
on
the
rise
in
other
large
european
countries
utilities
are
feeling
a
backlash
against
the
internationalization
they
embraced
a
decade
earlier
this
is
still
a
very
national
business
said
a
senior
banker
who
worked
on
the
innogy
deal
the
most
difficult
situations
in
a
big
transaction
are
those
that
involve
players
from
different
while
potential
foreign
ownership
had
not
become
a
political
issue
ahead
of
the
innogy
deal
german
politicians
publicly
opposed
attempts
by
china
state
grid
corp
to
buy
a
stake
in
german
grid
operator
from
australian
fund
ifm
a
source
familiar
with
the
situation
told
reuters
that
german
officials
had
encouraged
belgium
s
elia
the
leading
shareholding
in
to
increase
its
stake
rather
than
let
state
grid
buy
it
the
first
moves
against
international
ownership
of
utilities
came
in
hungary
where
populist
prime
minister
viktor
orban
said
in
the
state
would
seek
to
buy
back
hungarian
assets
of
rwe
edf
engie
and
italy
s
eni
since
then
orban
has
imposed
sharp
cuts
in
energy
prices
making
mostly
firms
foot
the
bill
and
several
foreign
utilities
have
sold
their
operations
to
the
state
in
poland
edf
and
engie
felt
the
sting
of
nationalist
energy
policies
in
when
the
ruling
law
and
justice
party
put
assets
owned
by
french
utilities
on
a
list
of
firms
deemed
important
for
energy
security
to
block
their
potential
sale
edf
which
had
been
in
talks
with
czech
firm
eph
and
ifm
about
selling
its
assets
in
poland
was
ultimately
forced
to
sell
to
polish
firms
has
there
ever
been
a
big
m
a
deal
in
the
utility
world
i
would
have
to
think
very
hard
to
find
an
answer
said
an

based
in
frankfurt
who
has
worked
on
german
and
european
sector
deals
