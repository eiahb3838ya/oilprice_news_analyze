update 3-kinder morgan says investment in oil pipeline expansion may be untenable
reuters
kinder
morgan
inc
said
on
wednesday
that
recent
events
confirm
an
investment
in
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
may
be
untenable
and
said
ottawa
s
pledge
of
financial
support
does
not
resolve
political
risk
related
to
british
columbia
s
opposition
the
comments
come
as
the
british
columbia
government
pledged
to
file
a
legal
challenge
by
to
determine
whether
it
has
the
jurisdiction
to
stop
the
c
billion
billion
project
which
was
approved
by
the
federal
government
in
and
would
nearly
triple
capacity
on
the
pipeline
from
alberta
to
a
port
kinder
morgan
canada
a
unit
of
kinder
morgan
halted
most
spending
on
the
expansion
earlier
this
month
and
set
a
may
deadline
to
decide
if
it
would
scrap
the
project
entirely
citing
legal
and
jurisdictional
issues
as
we
said
then
it
s
become
clear
this
particular
investment
may
be
untenable
for
a
private
party
to
undertake
the
events
of
the
last
days
have
confirmed
those
views
chief
executive
steven
kean
said
on
a
conference
call
while
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
has
said
canada
is
prepared
to
offer
financial
aid
to
ensure
the
project
goes
ahead
kean
dodged
a
question
about
whether
that
support
would
ensure
construction
they
re
really
two
separate
things
he
said
most
of
the
investment
is
in
british
columbia
where
the
government
is
in
opposition
to
the
project
that
is
an
issue
that
in
our
view
needs
to
be
the
trans
mountain
expansion
is
considered
crucial
for
alberta
s
oil
industry
which
has
been
beset
by
transportation
bottlenecks
it
is
fiercely
opposed
by
some
cities
some
aboriginal
groups
and
environmentalists
concerned
about
possible
oil
spills
the
company
said
while
it
is
not
in
a
position
to
move
on
takeovers
until
the
uncertainty
around
trans
mountain
is
resolved
it
sees
good
opportunities
in
the
western
canadian
midstream
space
there
are
some
very
capable
players
with
good
midstream
assets
kean
said
adding
intent
is
and
was
that
kml
would
be
the
vehicle
to
invest
in
those
the
company
has
a
strong
balance
sheet
and
is
well
positioned
for
takeovers
especially
if
cash
earmarked
for
capital
projects
is
freed
up
said
paul
bloom
investment
manager
with
bloom
investment
counsel
i
think
you
can
expect
if
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
does
not
go
ahead
kinder
morgan
will
be
bidders
for
various
assets
here
in
canada
and
probably
fairly
quickly
as
well
