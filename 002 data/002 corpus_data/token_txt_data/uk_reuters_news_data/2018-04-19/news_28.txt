acharya
a
deputy
governor
at
the
central
bank
and
a
member
of
the
panel
said
he
would
decisively
vote
for
a
beginning
of
withdrawal
of
accommodation
in
the
next
monetary
policy
meeting
in
june
adding
that
it
was
also
important
to
see
some
data
on
growth
reinforcement
of
credibility
that
such
a
shift
would
signal
is
crucial
in
my
view
for
prudent
macroeconomic
management
on
both
the
domestic
and
external
sector
fronts
acharya
said
the
reserve
bank
of
india
this
month
kept
its
policy
repo
rate
unchanged
at
percent
for
the
fourth
straight
meeting
and
retained
its
neutral
stance
while
five
mpc
members
had
voted
in
favour
of
the
decision
one
michael
patra
recommended
a
quarter
percentage
point
hike
in
the
repo
rate
echoing
acharya
patra
said
that
despite
ebbing
inflation
in
the
past
few
months
an
easier
or
neutral
monetary
policy
stance
would
delay
achieving
the
inflation
target
underlying
macroeconomic
developments
impart
some
urgency
to
commencing
the
withdrawal
of
accommodation
patra
said
the
central
bank
s
inflation
target
has
been
set
at
percent
the
minutes
of
the
mpc
s
meeting
have
a
distinctly
hawkish
tinge
as
compared
to
our
reading
of
the
statement
itself
said
aditi
nayar
the
principal
economist
of
rating
agency
icra
while
incoming
data
and
policy
decisions
related
to
factors
such
as
msps
excise
on
fuels
and
expenditure
announcements
remain
critical
today
s
minutes
suggest
that
a
rate
hike
in
remains
a
possibility
if
headline
inflation
exceeds
the
trajectory
set
out
by
the
mpc
as
a
result
bond
yields
are
likely
to
harden
in
the
immediate
data
released
after
the
monetary
policy
meeting
showed
retail
inflation
rate
eased
to
percent
in
march
a
number
that
has
been
moderating
since
it
hit
a
high
of
percent
in
december
during
the
policy
meeting
the
central
bank
lowered
its
inflation
projection
to
percent
from
a
previous
range
of
percent
that
it
released
in
february
for
the
second
half
of
this
fiscal
year
the
mpc
said
it
saw
inflation
at
percent
but
that
was
without
taking
into
account
any
increase
from
higher
housing
allowances
to
government
employees
