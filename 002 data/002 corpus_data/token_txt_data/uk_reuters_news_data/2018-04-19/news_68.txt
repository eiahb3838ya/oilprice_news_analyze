the
shocks
from
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on
oleg
deripaska
and
his
uc
rusal
aluminium
empire
are
still
rolling
through
the
market
after
rio
tinto
last
week
flagged
it
was
declaring
force
majeure
on
some
raw
material
contracts
it
warned
today
of
potential
adjustments
to
its
aluminium
guidance
this
year
due
to
the
sanctions
some
of
japan
s
major
trading
houses
meanwhile
have
asked
rusal
to
stop
shipping
aluminium
for
fear
of
secondary
sanctions
japan
imports
around
tonnes
of
russian
aluminium
every
year
equivalent
to
around
percent
of
its
total
import
needs
aluminium
s
previously
supply
chain
is
starting
to
crack
along
multiple
fault
lines
as
supply
fears
grow
the
market
s
attention
is
turning
to
china
as
a
potential
source
of
aluminium
there
are
almost
a
million
tonnes
of
the
stuff
sitting
in
warehouses
registered
with
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
shfe
that
metal
will
flow
out
of
china
if
the
price
is
right
but
china
s
role
as
supplier
of
last
resort
is
heavily
laden
with
irony
given
the
political
push
back
against
its
exports
of
aluminium
products
the
world
s
largest
producer
is
also
suffering
from
its
own
turbulence

relative

performance
in
london
the
price
of
aluminium
has
been
on
a
charge
since
the
treasury
announced
the
sanctions
on
april
at
a
current
per
tonne
london
metal
exchange
lme
aluminium
has
gained
over
in
the
space
of
under
two
weeks
that
has
opened
up
a
widening
gap
with
shanghai
prices
which
have
reacted
only
mutedly
to
the
excitement
in
london
however
still
higher
prices
will
be
needed
for
chinese
aluminium
to
leave
the
country
and
fill
the
supply
gaps
opening
up
in
the
rest
of
the
world
according
to
analysts
at
cru
that
s
because
exports
of
primary
metal
from
china
are
subject
to
a
percent
export
tax
unlike
exports
of
products
which
qualify
for
vat
rebates
depending
on
market
dynamics
in
both
london
and
shanghai
cru
is
looking
for
prices
to
approach
to
unlock
the
tonnes
of
metal
sitting
in
shfe
warehouses
but
this
is
what
will
be
necessary
if
rusal
s
own
exports
out
of
russia
are
blocked
cru
was
already
anticipating
a
supply
shortfall
of
around
million
tonnes
outside
of
china
before
the
sanctions
according
to
cru
s
head
of
primary
and
products
research
eoin
dinsmore
throw
in
the
potential
loss
of
tonnes
of
monthly
exports
from
russia
and
there
would
be
a
critical
need
for
chinese
metal
goldman
sachs
agrees
arguing
that
a
complete
cessation
of
rusal
exports
could
lift
prices
to
as
high
as
quantifying
upside
risks
from
russian
sanctions
april
the
bank
s
view
is
that
rusal
will
be
restructured
to
bypass
sanctions
and
allow
both
production
and
exports
to
continue
but
it
has
still
lifted
its
price
forecasts
to
factor
in
the
uncertainty
the
irony
here
is
that
china
is
already
a
huge
exporter
not
of
primary
aluminium
but
rather
of
aluminium
in
the
form
of
products
indeed
such
has
been
the
flood
of
products
out
of
the
country
that
up
to
now
the
big
issue
for
everyone
else
has
been
how
to
stop
china
exporting
so
much
not
how
to
stimulate
it
to
export
more
the
united
states
has
led
the
political
push
back
against
chinese
product
exports
which
rose
another
percent
last
year
to
an
annual
record
of
million
tonnes
president
donald
trump
has
signed
off
on
a
import
tax
on
all
imports
of
aluminium
with
china
firmly
in
the
administration
s
sights
separately
the
united
states
is
still
slapping
duties
on
specific
chinese
products
aluminium
foil
has
already
been
hit
with
swingeing
countervailing
duties
and
the
net
has
just
been
widened
to
include
aluminium
alloy
sheet
this
is
the
dilemma
for
the
rest
the
world
it
now
desperately
needs
chinese
exports
of
primary
metal
to
rebalance
the
market
but
simultaneously
still
needs
lower
exports
of
products
china
s
own
aluminium
production
sector
meanwhile
is
experiencing
plenty
of
its
own
turbulence
the
closure
last
year
of
illegal
capacity
meaning
that
operating
without
all
the
correct
permits
and
mandated
curtailments
at
some
plants
during
the
winter
smog
campaign
have
slowed
production
growth
to
just
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
it
s
true
that
the
winter
heating
season
cuts
have
disappointed
aluminium
bulls
but
the
environmental
pressure
on
the
aluminium
smelting
sector
shows
no
signs
of
letting
up
any
time
soon
adding
new
uncertainty
is
a
draft
proposal
from
the
national
development
and
reform
commission
targeting
aluminium
producers
drawing
their
power
from
captive
coal
plants
and
stipulating
retroactive
power
payments
to
the
government
hongqiao
the
world
s
largest
aluminium
producer
and
one
that
is
heavily
reliant
on
coal
could
be
particularly
vulnerable
at
this
stage
the
proposal
is
no
more
than
that
and
there
is
likely
plenty
of
for
such
a
big
industrial
powerhouse
and
employer
but
the
key
takeaway
here
is
that
beijing
s
scrutiny
of
its
aluminium
sector
is
only
getting
sharper
as
it
targets
both
excessive
capacity
and
polluting
industries
at
any
other
time
in
recent
history
china
s
giant
smelter
sector
could
have
been
relied
upon
to
lift
production
in
response
to
rocketing
prices
right
now
however
price
is
only
part
of
a
more
complex
landscape
defined
by
illegal
capacity
closures
winter
curtailments
and
now
the
viability
of
coal
as
a
source
of
the
power
needed
to
produce
the
metal
the
global
aluminium
industry
continues
to
pay
the
price
of
chinese
excess
with
over
half
of
the
world
s
aluminium
production
concentrated
in
one
country
there
is
no
cushion
outside
of
china
to
compensate
for
diminished
flows
of
metal
from
rusal
moreover
what
is
clearly
available
right
now
in
china
namely
the
million
tonnes
sitting
in
shanghai
warehouses
is
trapped
behind
china
s
export
tax
what
is
flowing
in
ever
increasing
quantities
out
of
china
is
in
the
wrong
form
for
the
rest
of
the
world
which
now
needs
more
primary
aluminium
and
less
product
this
problematic
reliance
on
china
has
been
growing
for
many
years
but
it
s
taken
the
hit
on
the
largest
producer
to
expose
the
dysfunctional
nature
of
the
global
aluminium
supply
chain
