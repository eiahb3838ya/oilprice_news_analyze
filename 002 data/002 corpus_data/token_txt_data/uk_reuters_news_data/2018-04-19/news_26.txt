ivory

has
partnered
with
chocolate
makers
to
try
to
halt
the
spread
of
cocoa
plantations
in

ivory

the
world
s
biggest
cocoa
producer
and
major
chocolate
companies
from
mars
to
hershey
to
barry
callebaut
pledged
last
year
to
eliminate
the
production
and
sourcing
of
cocoa
from
protected
forests
stamping
out
deforestation
in
the
cocoa
supply
chain
is
just
one
of
the
commitments
made
by
the
world
s
chocolate
makers
to
make
the
industry
more
sustainable
along
with
finding
ways
to
end
child
labor
and
boost
farmers
incomes
if
deforestation
continues

the

rapidly
disappearing
forests
are
home
to
western

classified
as
critically
endangered
since
forest
elephants
and
the
rare
pygmy
hippopotamus
yet
plans
to
end
deforestation
a
major
threat
to
the
sustainability
of
the
cocoa
industry
face
major
hurdles
ivory
coast
estimates
percent
its
cocoa
comes
from
protected
areas
providing
livelihoods
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
farmers
and
their
families
ethical
certification
schemes
and
ivory
coast
s
laws
have
failed
so
far
to
stop
forests
being
replaced
by
plantations
while
farming
alternatives
are
typically
difficult
and
costly
to
implement
on
a
large
scale
ivory
coast
s
forests
have
been
cut
down
to
make
way
for
agricultural
products
such
as
cocoa
palm
oil
and
rubber
for
decades
since
the
country
s
independence
from
france
in
the
decimation
of
its
national
parks
and
forests
since
the
turn
of
the
century
however
has
shocked
researchers
and
led
to
the
agreement
to
end
deforestation
which
was
signed
at
the
climate
change
conference
in
november
see
the
agreement
here
a
study
published
in
the
journal
tropical
conservation
science
in
concluded
that
of
the
land
in
five
national
parks
and
forest
reserves
in
ivory
coast
had
been
transformed
for
cocoa
production
see
the
study
here
in
a
mighty
earth
investigation
here
the
director
of
ivory
coast
forest
reserve
protection
agency
sodefor
estimated
that
percent
of
the
country
cocoa
came
from
protected
areas
almost
half
the
mont
peko
national
park
had
been
converted
to
cocoa
by
data
from
the
environmental
campaign
group
seen
by
reuters
shows
marahoue
national
park
had
lost
percent
of
its
forest
by
the
same
year
one
contributing
factor
was
the
outbreak
of
civil
war
in
ivory
coast
in
the
country
was
split
for
a
decade
between
a
north
and
south
with
the
forest
regions
in
the
west
home
to
several
armed
groups
many
park
rangers
and
forest
officials
abandoned
their
posts
allowing
warlords
to
move
in
and
parcel
off
fertile
forest
land
ideal
for
cocoa
production
to
locals
and
immigrants
alike
accelerating
the
deforestation
despite
an
end
to
the
war
in
many
of
the
lucrative
fiefdoms
carved
out
by
former
rebels
remain
in
place
attractive
world
cocoa
prices
also
encouraged
farmers
to
move
deeper
into
protected
forests
helping
ivory
coast
consolidate
its
position
as
the
world
s
biggest
cocoa
grower
ahead
of
neighboring
ghana
the
deforestation
agreement
was
signed
by
ivory
coast
and
ghana
along
with
trading
firms
and
chocolate
makers
including
ferrero
nestle
lindt
mondelez
ritter
sport
olam
cargill
a
number
of
chocolate
makers
have
committed
separately
to
ensuring
none
of
the
beans
they
buy
come
from
deforested
areas
by
the
details
of
the
plan
have
yet
to
be
worked
out
but
cocoa
exporters
are
pinning
hopes
on
global
positioning
system
gps
mapping
and
relationships
with
cooperatives
producing
beans
under
certified
schemes
such
as
the
rainforest
alliance
the
idea
is
to
trace
all
cocoa
back
to
the
farm
where
it
was
produced
to
prevent
beans
grown
illegally
in
national
parks
and
protected
forests
getting
into
the
chocolate
supply
chain
we
believe
cooperatives
are
the
best
driver
said
lionel
soulard
africa
director
for
cargill
the
region
s
top
exporter
it
starts
with
gps
mapping
the
farmers
then
making
sure
we
can
trace
where
the
cocoa
comes
from
and
how
we
can
prove
it
comes
from
there
he
told
reuters
in
an
interview
in
ivory
coast
s
main
city
of
abidjan
in
february
ivory
coast
s
government
is
due
to
publish
maps
on
forest
cover
and
land
use
for
different
forests
along
with
data
on
cocoa
farmers
and
communities
that
depend
on
the
forests
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
government
has
committed
to
beefing
up
surveillance
of
its
forest
reserves
and
applying
sanctions
for
any
new
infringements
by
the
middle
of
the
year
at
the
latest
ivory
coast
is
also
coming
up
with
a
plan
to
restore
its
national
forests
and
develop
models
for
sustainable
a
model
that
aims
to
restore
forest
cover
while
also
allowing
cocoa
production
to
continue
in
protected
areas
it
s
a
lot
of
work
said
jean
claude
koya
a
specialist
on
sustainable
development
for
ivory
coast
s
government
some
of
these
forests
are
so
degraded
there
s
nothing
we
can
do
but
some
can
still
be
to
halt
deforestation
ivory
coast
may
be
forced
to
kick
out
hundreds
of
thousands
of
farmers
out
of
forests
and
find
alternative
livelihoods
for
them
to
prove
the
provenance
of
all
cocoa
every
smallholder
s
farm
would
need
to
be
mapped
and
every
cocoa
bean
tracked
from
farm
to
port
but
tracing
where
cocoa
comes
from
is
tricky
and
the
supply
chain
is
prone
to
manipulation
reports
by
mighty
earth
and
others
have
shown
that
cocoa
farmed
in
national
parks
still
ends
being
sold
by
cooperatives
to
large
cocoa
traders
certification
schemes
such
as
rainforest
alliance
are
meant
to
ensure
cocoa
sold
under
the
brand
has
not
come
from
illegal
farming
in
protected
forests
but
sustainability
experts
acknowledge
the
schemes
are
not
foolproof
in
duekoue
a
town
in
west
ivory
coast
surrounded
by
cocoa
farms
and
thick
bush
members
of
three
cooperatives
told
reuters
that
it
was
common
for
beans
grown
in
protected
forests
to
be
mixed
with
cocoa
from
farms
considered
sustainable
there
are
weaknesses
in
the
system
companies
may
think
they
re
buying
certified
cocoa
but
there
s
some
going
on
edward
millard
rainforest
alliance
director
for
africa
and
south
asia
told
reuters
you
do
the
best
you
can
but
there
are
risks
in
any
system
of
attempts
by
the
government
to
crack
down
on
illegal
cocoa
farming
since
a
second
civil
war
in
defused
the
country
s
political
crisis
have
also
foundered
partly
because
of
inertia
and
corruption
in
the
past
ivorian
authorities
tended
to
respond
to
encroachment
on
protected
areas
by
sending
agents
to
forcibly
remove
farmers
and
destroy
their
crops
park
authorities
evicted
thousands
of
illegal
cocoa
farmers
from
mont
peko
in
destroying
cocoa
trees
and
settlements
but
no
alternative
livelihoods
were
on
offer
and
many
cocoa
farmers
returned
afterwards
see
the
story
here
farmers
interviewed
by
reuters
in
the
scio
reserve
said
agents
from
sodefor
often
came
to
remove
them
from
the
forest
but
always
ended
up
accepting
bribes
instead
to
let
them
stay
ivory
coast
s
minister
of
water
and
forests
donwahi
declined
a
reuters
interview
a
ministry
spokeswoman
did
not
respond
to
emailed
questions
cargill
s
head
of
cocoa
sustainability
taco
terheijden
thinks
kicking
farmers
out
of
forests
is
undesirable
unless
alternative
livelihoods
can
be
found
if
hundreds
of
thousands
of
farmers
are
to
be
expelled
i
would
not
want
to
be
responsible
for
a
social
disaster
he
said
if
we
expel
them
out
of
their
own
source
of
cocoa
we
need
to
make
sure
there
s
an
alternative
last
year
the
ivorian
government
began
drafting
plans
to
legalize
cocoa
plantations
in
some
forests
and
reserves
creating
protected
agroforests
where
new
trees
are
planted
while
farmers
continue
to
grow
cocoa
under
this
model
trees
are
threaded
through
crops
helping
shade
cocoa
plants
while
also
doing
less
harm
to
biodiversity
and
keeping
the
soil
fertile
for
longer
this
strategy
could
help
ivory
coast
curb
deforestation
without
evicting
farmers
or
slashing
cocoa
output
which
provides
more
than
half
the
country
s
export
revenue
but
ivory
coast
s
aim
to
roll
out
on
million
hectares
of
protected
reserves
is
likely
to
prove
costly
and
neither
the
government
nor
the
cocoa
industry
have
yet
committed
to
footing
the
bill
rolling
out
in
million
hectares
wow
that
s
expensive
said
etelle
higonnet
of
conservation
watchdog
mighty
earth
referring
to
the
amount
of
land
devoted
to
cocoa
in
west
africa
as
a
whole
you
can
t
ask
farmers
to
foot
the
bill
the
companies
have
to
stump
up
