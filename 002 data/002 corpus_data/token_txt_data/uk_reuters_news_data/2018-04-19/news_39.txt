large
production
cuts
at
its
vast
groningen
gas
field
turned
the
netherlands
into
a
net
importer
of
gas
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
the
the
dutch
national
statistics
office
said
thursday
the
dutch
have
been
one
of
the
major
gas
suppliers
in
europe
for
decades
exploiting
what
once
was
europe
s
largest
gas
field
in
the
northern
region
of
groningen
but
they
have
rapidly
shrunk
production
in
recent
years
as
a
string
of
earthquakes
directly
related
to
gas
extraction
damaged

of
houses
and
buildings
production
at
the
groningen
field
has
been
cut
by
percent
since
its
peak
of

and
the
dutch
government
last
month
said
it
would
phase
out

at
all
dutch
gas

while
imports
rose
by
nearly
a
fifth

fourth
consecutive
drop
in
production
meant

overtook
domestic
gas

the
time
since
dutch

began
in

for

rise
by
a
third
in
