a
power
line
failure
in
southern
puerto
rico
cut
electricity
to
almost
all
million
residents
on
wednesday
the
latest
in
a
string
of
operational
and
political
headaches
for
the
territory
s
bankrupt
power
utility
in
a
statement
the
puerto
rican
electric
power
authority
known
as
prepa
said
technical
personnel
were
working
to
determine
a
cause
and
expected
to
restore
service
in
to
hours
puerto
rico
s
smaller
islands
of
culebra
and
vieques
as
well
as
a
pair
of
microgrids
on
the
main
island
were
unaffected
prepa
has
struggled
to
escape
the
headlines
since
hurricane
maria
wiped
out
power
to
all
of
puerto
rico
last
maria
the
worst
storm
to
hit
the
island
in
years
devastated
puerto
rico
s
grid
and
thousands
were
still
without
power
at
the
time
of
wednesday
s
blackout
this
is
another
example
of
why
puerto
rico
s
energy
infrastructure
needs
to
incorporate
new
forms
of
power
governor
ricardo
rossello
said
on
twitter
adding
that
he
is
committed
to
reforms
to
transform
the
island
s
energy
sector
separately
on
wednesday
the
island
s
financial
oversight
board
unveiled
a
framework
for
reform
that
breaks
with
rossello
s
vision
pushing
pension
cuts
and
labor
reforms
while
hinting
at
layoffs
prepa
has
suffered
several
blackouts
since
maria
and
has
been
in
bankruptcy
since
last
july
owing
some
billion
to
mutual
funds
hedge
funds
and
other
investors
in
october
rossello
canceled
a
million
contract
awarded
by
prepa
to
a
tiny
company
amid
political
backlash
three
months
later
the
army
corps
of
engineers
discovered
undistributed
hurricane
relief
materials
in
a
prepa
warehouse
sparking
rossello
to
order
a
separate
investigation
a
congressional
committee
in
march
announced
its
own
probe
into
potential
corruption
at
prepa
including
reports
that
some
officials
accepted
bribes
to
restore
power
to
exotic
dance
clubs
ahead
of
schedule
rossello
is
planning
to
privatize
prepa
over
the
next
months
as
puerto
rico
navigates
a
billion
bankruptcy
the
largest
in
government
history
in
the
though
the
grid
remains
vulnerable
ahead
of
a
new
hurricane
season
beginning
this
summer
falling
revenues
a
loss
of
staff
and
constant
leadership
turnover
have
contributed
to
an
outdated
fleet
of
equipment
which
was
exposed
by
maria
s
winds
of
up
to
miles
per
hour
compounding
that
most
of
the
island
s
generation
is
done
in
the
south
and
trekked
through
miles
of
wires
to
the
bulk
of
the
population
in
the
north
we
need
to
have
power
to
the
north
to
avoid
this
kind
of
chain
reaction
every
time
we
have
a
power
problem
