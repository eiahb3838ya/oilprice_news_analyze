lyft to offset emissions from rides with projects combating climate change
san
francisco
reuters
lyft
inc
is
launching
a
programme
on
thursday
to
offset
emissions
from
the
million
cars
that
drive
for
the
service
by
investing
in
projects
to
reduce
other
sources
of
greenhouse
gas
the
company
said
the
move
comes
as
lyft
and
uber
technologies
inc
as
well
as
and
startups
face
scrutiny
for
clogging
city
streets
and
sidewalks
worsening
traffic
the
company
will
purchase
carbon
offsets
to
support
projects
such
as
renewable
energy
and
reforestation
balancing
the
carbon
impact
of
every
mile
driven
by
a
car
working
for
lyft
including
the
miles
driven
to
pick
up
a
passenger
that
will
be
a
dollar
investment
in
the
first
year
and
the
cost
will
rise
as
lyft
grows
this
in
a
sense
puts
a
tax
on
ourselves
to
continue
to
move
toward
shared
rides
and
lower
emission
vehicles
said
lyft
and
president
john
zimmer
in
an
interview
the
company
declined
to
provide
a
precise
dollar
amount
for
the
programme
lyft
drivers
completed
million
rides
in
accounting
for
well
over
a
billion
miles
according
to
the
company
lyft
said
in
a
statement
it
is
working
with
environmental
firm
which
sources
carbon
reduction
projects
lyft
will
tap
its
more
than
billion
in
venture
capital
funding
to
pay
for
the
carbon
offsets
zimmer
said
the
project
took
on
a
heightened
sense
of
urgency
since
the
environmental
protection
agency
this
month
moved
to
ease
vehicle
emissions
standards
initial
projects
funded
by
lyft
include
an
effort
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
from
an
auto
parts
factory
in
michigan
by
using
alternative
materials
and
recycling
transformer
oil
in
ohio
it
s
really
important
that
we
know
what
the
projects
are
that
they
are
real
and
tangible
and
that
they
would
not
have
happened
otherwise
zimmer
said
lyft
s
effort
is
the
latest
example
of
a
silicon
valley
company
working
to
mitigate
some
of
the
harm
its
services
have
caused
this
week
airbnb
announced
its
office
of
healthy
tourism
aimed
at
easing
crowding
from
tourism
that
has
plagued
cities
such
as
barcelona
and
amsterdam
a
problem
exacerbated
by
airbnb
san
francisco
s
city
attorney
last
year
issued
subpoenas
to
lyft
and
uber
for
records
of
driving
practices
amid
concerns
the
companies
had
created
traffic
hazards
zimmer
acknowledged
traffic
is
a
major
issue
and
said
the
company
also
has
plans
to
invest
in
electric
autonomous
vehicles
and
expand
its
carpooling
service
