indonesian
biodiesel
makers
are
gearing
up
to
boost
exports
after
the
european
union
removed
duties
on
shipments
from
some
producers
in
the
country
but
rival
suppliers
in
malaysia
are
bracing
for
a
slowdown
in
the
wake
of
the
move
after
legal
proceedings
at
the
european
court
of
justice
the
eu
last
month
removed
duties
on
biodiesel
imports
for
indonesian
and
argentine
producers
that
had
been
in
place
since
the
move
is
set
to
be
a
boon
for
indonesia
the
world
s
top
supplier
of
biofuel
but
is
expected
to
hit
malaysian
exporters
hard
as
they
lose
market
share
due
to
higher
costs
in
their
biodiesel
industry
traders
estimate
malaysian
prices
for
a
tonne
of
biodiesel
are
typically
to
more
expensive
than
indonesian
cargoes
both
nations
use
palm
oil
from
their
vast
plantations
to
churn
out
biodiesel
prices
of
malaysian
palm
methyl
ester
the
bio
component
of
biodiesel
that
comes
from
palm
oil
traded
at
a
tonne
on
thursday
versus
in
indonesia
according
to
a
trader
some
indonesian
companies
have
already
started
shipping
to
europe
said
the
chairman
of
the
indonesia
biofuels
producer
association
aprobi
mp
tumanggor
he
expects
indonesia
to
ship
around
tonnes
of
biodiesel
to
the
eu
this
year
up
from
virtually
nothing
in
that
would
still
be
a
way
off
the
million
tonnes
exported
the
year
before
the
eu
duties
were
introduced
although
a
biodiesel
trader
said
indonesia
could
ship
up
to
tonnes
a
month
from
here
on
in
he
declined
to
be
identified
as

to

with

weaker
export
demand
for
malaysian
biodiesel
is
expected
to
curb
utilisation
rates
at
the
country
s
production
plants
malaysia
biodiesel
exports
last
year
were
pretty
good
it
had
a
window
to
export
to
the
eu
but
now
malaysia
is
not
competitive
said
unnithan
president
of
the
malaysia
biodiesel
association
mba
i
imagine
malaysian
biodiesel
exports
to
the
eu
now
would
be
virtually
malaysia
s
biodiesel
exports
largely
eu
bound
jumped
to
tonnes
in
from
tonnes
the
previous
year
according
to
mba
data
the
removal
of
eu
exports
would
see
biodiesel
production
fall
to
tonnes
this
year
from
tonnes
in
forecast
unnithan
lowering
plant
utilisation
rates
from
current
levels
of
around
percent
duties
on
biodiesel
exports
from
other
indonesian
producers
are
expected
to
be
lifted
soon
the
latest
step
comes
as
prices
for
regular
diesel
last
week
hit
a
peak
with
benchmark
palm
oil
prices
recently
declining
to
their
largest
discount
to
the
fuel
in
the
last
few
years
however
traders
warn
more
competitive
biodiesel
could
challenge
indonesian
exports
as
current
prices
of
soy
methyl
ester
are
with
those
for
palm
methyl
ester
