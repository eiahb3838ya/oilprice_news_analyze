talk
that
saudi
arabia
has
its
sights
on
a
barrel
oil
again
and
of
more
sanctions
on
russia
ignited
a
rally
in
commodities
and
resource
stocks
on
thursday
though
the
potential
boost
to
inflation
hit
assets
it
was
set
to
be
the
strongest
day
for
the
commodity
complex
in
eight
months
as
brent
crude
futures
climbed
past
a
barrel
after
a
near
percent
jump
overnight
the
surge
came
on
a
reuters
report
that
opec
s
new
price
hawk
saudi
arabia
would
be
happy
for
crude
to
rise
to
or
even
a
sign
riyadh
will
seek
no
changes
to
a
deal
even
though
the
agreement
s
original
target
is
now
within
sight
the
leap
in
oil
combined
with
fears
that
sanctions
on
russia
could
hit
supplies
of
other
commodities
to
light
a
fire
under
the
entire
sector
nickel
jumped
the
most
in
years
on
talk
nornickel
the
world
s
producer
of
the
metal
could
be
impacted
aluminium
prices
reached
their
highest
since
its
raw
material
alumina
touching
an
peak
before
retreating
when
russia
floated
the
idea
of
a
temporary
nationalisation
of
giant
rusal
it
has
been
a
very
erratic
day
it
s
a
bit
crazy
said
rabobank
metals
sector
economist
casper
burgering
nickel
went
up
by
almost
pct
and
aluminium
by
almost
percent
and
now
are
coming
right
back
expect
more
volatility
he
said
such
increases
if
sustained
though
could
fuel
inflationary
pressures
and
investors
hedged
by
selling
sovereign
bonds
yields
on
treasuries
stood
at
levels
last
visited
in
at
percent
and
german
yields
went
above
percent
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
month
saudi
arabia
wants
higher
oil
prices
and
yes
probably
for
the
ipo
but
it
isn
t
just
that
an
opec
source
told
reuters
look
at
the
economic
reforms
and
projects
they
want
to
do
and
the
war
in
yemen
how
are
they
going
to
pay
for
all
that
they
need
higher
opec
and
its
partners
next
meet
formally
on
june
but
a
ministerial
monitoring
panel
will
gather
in
jeddah
saudi
arabia
on
friday
and
are
expected
to
make
noises
about
the
broader
supply
and
demand
in
the
oil
market
resource
stocks
were
the
big
winners
from
thursday
s
romp
higher
in
prices
chinese
blue
chips
ended
up
percent
and
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
added
percent
with
energy
up
more
than
percent
japan
s
nikkei
faded
late
in
the
day
to
end
up
percent
but
basic
materials
and
utilities
both
climbed
more
than
percent
industrial
and
stocks
also
led
the
pack
in
europe
though
the
stoxx
showed
signs
of
fatigue
after
a
rally
that
had
taken
it
to
a
high
the
bullish
sentiment
in
markets
comes
amid
wider
optimism
about
economic
growth
the
global
economy
is
expected
to
expand
this
year
at
its
fastest
pace
since
the
latest
reuters
polls
of
over
economists
worldwide
suggest
but
trade
protectionism
could
quickly
slow
it
down
investors
were
also
relieved
that
no
new
demands
on
trade
came
out
of
a
summit
between
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
and
president
donald
trump
futures
for
the

were
pointing
to
a
broadly
steady
start
in
new

later
where
traders
were
already
digesting
the
latest
flurry
of
earnings
including
from
blackstone
and
philip
morris
wall
street
had
also
seen
hefty
gains
in
the
energy
and
industrial
indexes
late
on
wednesday
though
that
was
offset
by
softness
in
sectors
such
as
consumer
staples
and
financials
ibm
s
percent
drop
was
the
biggest
drag
on
the
s
p
after
the
technology
company
s
quarterly
profit
margins
missed
wall
street
targets
in
currency
markets
the

remained
rangebound
its

barely

its
best
day
in
more
than
a
year
on
wednesday
after

the
conventional

that

said
tom
