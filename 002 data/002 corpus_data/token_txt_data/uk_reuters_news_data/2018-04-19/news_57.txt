column-to frack or not to frack? australia's natural gas dilemma: russell

the
decision
by
the
government
of
australia
s
northern
territory
government
to
allow
the
resumption
of
fracking
for
natural
gas
will
do
little
to
immediately
solve
the
country
s
energy
woes
but
will
likely
sharpen
political
battle
lines
the
territory
s
government
said
on
april
that
it
has
lifted
a
near
moratorium
on
hydraulic
fracturing
known
as
fracking
accepting
the
recommendations
of
its
own
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
practice
northern
territory
is
a
vast
million
square
kilometre
square
mile
part
of
central
and
northern
australia
and
home
to
two
potentially
rich
basins
of
natural
gas
the
remote
region
is
ruled
by
the
labor
party
which
is
in
opposition
at
a
federal
level
the
labor
party
also
controls
state
governments
in
queensland
victoria
and
western
australia
the
decision
to
permit
fracking
subject
to
rigorous
regulation
came
as
a
surprise
to
many
observers
given
the
opposition
of
many
labor
supporters
to
this
method
of
natural
gas
production
the
territory
government
was
elected
on
a
platform
of
placing
a
moratorium
on
fracking
and
holding
an
inquiry
into
whether
it
was
safe
and
what
were
the
environmental
risks
in
some
ways
the
territory
s
commission
merely
confirmed
what
other
similar
inquiries
in
australia
have
already
found
namely
that
the
risks
of
fracking
can
be
managed
with
robust
regulation

the
government
of
new
territory
chief
minister
michael
gunner
must
have
known
however
that
allowing
the
resumption
of
fracking
would
alienate
part
of
its
support
base
and
make
it
a
target
for
green
activists
the
natural
gas
industry
has
welcomed
the
lifting
of
the
moratorium
and
australian
energy
major
origin
energy
said
it
aimed
to
resume
plans
as
soon
as
practical
to
drill
and
frack
the
beetaloo
basin
which
the
company
says
contains
as
much
as
trillion
cubic
feet
in
reserves
such
a
level
of
natural
gas
reserves
would
provide
a
welcome
boost
to
australia
which
is
struggling
to
balance
the
needs
of
three
large
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
plants
in
queensland
with
the
demands
for
cheap
and
reliable
supplies
from
industry
and
consumers
along
the
populous
east
coast
it
s
this
dynamic
that
is
creating
political
headaches
for
both
state
governments
and
the
liberal
party
of
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
the
natural
gas
industry
maintains
there
is
no
actual
shortage
of
the
fuel
but
says
that
to
ensure
that
this
situation
continues
the
states
and
territories
will
have
to
permit
exploration
and
production
currently
four
states
new
south
wales
victoria
tasmania
and
western
australia
have
either
bans
or
moratoriums
on
at
least
some
forms
of
natural
gas
exploration
and
production
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
nt
s
decision
to
lift
its
fracking
moratorium
will
encourage
other
jurisdictions
to
do
the
same
but
any
politician
considering
this
will
be
aware
of
the
furious
reaction
it
would
generate
from
environmental
activists
the
other
issue
for
australia
is
that
domestic
natural
gas
prices
have
risen
sharply
and
are
now
trading
more
in
line
with
asian
spot
lng
prices
the
price
of
natural
gas
at
the
wallumbilla
hub
in
queensland
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
per
million
british
thermal
units
last
week
while
spot
asian
lng
was
once
the
cost
of
the
lng
is
netted
back
to
the
hub
the
two
prices
are
more
or
less
in
line
meaning
australia
s
domestic
customers
are
paying
for
their
natural
gas
at
values
linked
to
international
prices
this
is
a
shift
from
what
happened
prior
to
the
three
lng
plants
being
built
in
queensland
when
domestic
natural
gas
was
cheaper
and
generally
sold
in
contracts
adding
natural
gas
from
the
territory
to
australia
s
supply
mix
may
help
lower
prices
for
both
feedstock
for
the
lng
plants
and
domestic
customers
but
the
point
is
that
this
extra
production
is
still
several
years
away
in
the
meantime
pressure
is
going
to
mount
on
domestic
natural
gas
suppliers
and
consumers
leading
to
political
fallout
and
seemingly
odd
solutions
such
as
bringing
a
floating
ship
to
melbourne
and
importing
lng
it
seems
ludicrous
that
australia
which
will
overtake
qatar
as
the
world
s
top
exporter
of
lng
once
the
last
of
eight
new
projects
comes
online
later
this
year
will
turn
to
importing
the
fuel
in
order
to
meet
domestic
demand
it
seems
logical
to
develop
onshore
natural
gas
resources
rather
than
import
lng
but
this
ignores
the
increasing
influence
of
environmental
activists
who
are
committed
to
ending
all
fossil
fuel
production
in
favour
of
renewable
energy
while
some
green
groups
ignore
the
scientific
evidence
that
supports
fracking
others
simply
shift
to
say
that
natural
gas
production
contributes
to
climate
change
and
should
be
banned
for
this
reason
any
company
engaged
in
fracking
in
australia
can
expect
to
be
targeted
by
activists
which
may
deter
some
oil
and
gas
companies
given
they
have
become
increasingly
publicity
shy
the
end
result
of
the
northern
territory
s
decision
to
allow
fracking
may
be
some
additional
natural
gas
supply
but
it
will
certainly
up
the
political
temperature
and
raise
the
risks
of
populist
policies
triumphing
over
cheap
energy
supplies
that
are
cleaner
than
australia
s
existing
power
plants

opinions
expressed
