when
veronica
gambled
her
life
savings
on
research
into
a
rare
species
of
bee
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
it
would
pay
off
the
new
zealander
a
trained
reproductive
biologist
had
a
hunch
that
the
substance
in
which
the
hylaeus
bee
breeds
its
larvae
could
replace
toxic
chemicals
used
in
plastics
the
idea
inspired
by
a
chance
reading
of
an
academic
paper
while
trying
to
distract
herself
from
a
job
in
film
distribution
set
her
on
a
completely
new
life
path
the
results
were
good
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
i
had
just
spent
my
life
savings
so
i
was
after
chased
around
rugged
bush
to
catch
specimens
tests
revealed
that
as
well
as
being
waterproof
the
bee
s
nest
lining
was
resistant
to
fire
and
certain
acids
giving
it
a
wide
range
of
potential
uses
plastics
are
commonly
treated
with
chemicals
to
change
their
properties
waterproofing
them
in
products
from
raingear
to
camping
gear
and
making
them
for
firefighters
jackets
and
construction
tarps
those
chemicals
are
drawing
scrutiny
from
environmentalists
concerned
about
the
danger
they
pose
to
health
some
studies
have
linked
bisphenol
a
bpa
used
to
stiffen
plastic
food
containers
to
a
range
of
possible
effects
from
cancer
to
heart
disease
to
infertility
although
this
is
disputed
enter
humble
bee
a
startup
that
has
raised
nzd
in
private
funding
as
well
as
a
nzd
grant
since
its
inception
in
dissecting
the
minute
bee
which
measures
no
more
than
mms
about
half
an
inch
to
extract
its
microscopic
glands
has
allowed
humble
bee
to
chart
a
chemical
pathway
to
replicate
the
precious
nest
lining
extracting
the
genetic
code
behind
the
material
the
company
s
current
focus
holds
more
promises
as
it
would
make
it
cheaper
to
manufacture
and
selling
the
material
at
a
more
competitive
price
said
company
director
richard
furneaux
a
chemistry
professor
who
heads
a
research
institute
at
the
victoria
university
of
wellington
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
discovery
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
its
robustness
is
beyond
what
you
would
have
expected
said
furneaux
who
has
opened
his
laboratory
to
humble
bee
the
interest
of
funders
in
the
reflected
a
growing
interest
in
the
scientific
field
of
biomimicry
which
looks
to
nature
for
solutions
said
maurie
cohen
a
professor
of
sustainability
at
the
new
jersey
institute
of
technology
hopes
the
final
product
would
go
on
sale
within
five
years
and
have
a
commercial
and
social
impact
the
answer
lies
in
nature
