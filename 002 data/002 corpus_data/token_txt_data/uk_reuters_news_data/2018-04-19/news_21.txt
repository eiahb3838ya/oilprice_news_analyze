a
global
oil
glut
has
been
virtually
eliminated
according
to
a
joint
opec
and
technical
panel
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
thanks
in
part
to
an
supply
cut
deal
in
place
since
january
the
meeting
of
the
joint
technical
committee
jtc
earlier
on
thursday
found
that
oil
inventories
in
developed
nations
in
march
stood
at
million
barrels
above
the
average
one
of
the
sources
said
that
s
down
from
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
january
the
stated
goal
of
the
supply
cut
is
to
reduce
the
excess
in
oil
stocks
to
that
of
the
average
although
oil
ministers
have
said
other
metrics
should
also
be
considered
although
opec
is
closing
in
on
the
original
target
of
the
pact
there
is
no
indication
yet
that
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
or
its
allies
want
to
wind
down
the
supply
cut
saudi
arabia
would
be
happy
to
see
crude
rise
to
pounds
or
even
a
barrel
three
industry
sources
said
a
sign
riyadh
will
seek
no
changes
to
the
deal
even
though
its
original
target
is
within
sight
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
to
reduce
supply
in
january
in
an
attempt
to
erase
a
glut
they
have
extended
the
pact
until
december
and
meet
in
june
to
review
policy
few
opec
sources
call
for
an
exit
strategy
most
officials
are
talking
of
introducing
additional
inventory
metrics
to
assess
the
success
of
the
deal
and
of
a
need
to
support
investment
in
new
production
to
avert
any
supply
crunch
the
impression
is
that
oil
prices
are
seen
as
not
yet
high
enough
to
encourage
sufficient
oil
investment
oil
was
trading
above
on
thursday
having
reached
its
highest
since
november
after
the
technical
meeting
a
ministerial
panel
of
opec
and
producers
called
the
jmmc
gathers
in
jeddah
on
friday
the
ministers
are
expected
to
discuss
the
average
inventory
metric
on
friday
though
the
jtc
has
made
no
recommendations
on
this
the
sources
said
opec
s
secretariat
in
vienna
will
be
tasked
to
prepare
a
study
with
different
scenarios
on
inventories
market
fundamentals
and
the
risks
which
might
impact
market
stability
such
as
possible
sanctions
on
iran
