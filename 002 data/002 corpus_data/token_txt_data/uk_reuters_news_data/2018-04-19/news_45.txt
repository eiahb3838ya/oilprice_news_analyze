talk
that
saudi
arabia
has
its
sights
on
a
barrel
oil
again
ignited
a
fierce
rally
in
commodities
and
resource
stocks
on
thursday
though
the
potential
boost
to
inflation
globally
put
some
pressure
on
assets
it
was
set
to
be
the
strongest
day
for
the
commodity
complex
in
eight
months
as
brent
crude
futures
climbed
past
a
barrel
after
a
near
percent
jump
overnight
the
surge
came
on
a
reuters
report
that
opec
s
new
price
hawk
saudi
arabia
would
be
happy
for
crude
to
rise
to
or
even
a
sign
riyadh
will
seek
no
changes
to
a
deal
even
though
the
agreement
s
original
target
is
now
within
sight
the
saudis
and
their
colleagues
in
opec
need
higher
oil
for
their
fiscal
positions
and
the
kingdom
is
on
a
bold
and
costly
reform
program
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
cfd
and
fx
provider
axitrader
the
leap
in
oil
combined
with
fears
that
sanctions
on
russia
could
hit
supplies
of
other
commodities
to
light
a
fire
under
the
entire
sector
nickel
jumped
the
most
in
years
on
talk
nornickel
the
world
s
producer

metal
could
be
targeted
aluminium
prices
reached
their
highest
since
its
raw
material
alumina
touched
an
peak
while
iron
ore
leapt
percent
such
increases
if
sustained
could
fuel
inflationary
pressures
and
investors
hedged
by
selling
sovereign
bonds
yields
on
treasuries
stood
at
levels
last
visited
in
at
percent
and
german
yields
went
above
percent
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
month
if
oil
prices
were
to
move
toward
a
barrel
and
euro
weakened
a
bit
there
could
be
some
inflation
pressure
said
rabobank

head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
that

has
a
negative
impact
on

and
could
do
here
especially
if
it
comes
on
the

japan

late
in
the
day
to
end
up

basic

both
climbed
more

industrial

stocks
also
led
the

though
the
stoxx
was
showing
some
signs
of
fatigue
after
a

had
taken
it
to

the
bullish
sentiment
in
markets
comes
amid
wider
optimism
about
economic
growth
the
global
economy
is
expected
to
expand
this
year
at
its
fastest
pace
since
the
latest
reuters
polls
of
over

worldwide
suggest
but
trade
protectionism
could
quickly
slow
it
down
investors
were
also
relieved
that
no
new

though
that
was
offset
by
softness
in
sectors
such
as
consumer
staples
and

ibm
s

was
the
biggest
drag
on

after

the
