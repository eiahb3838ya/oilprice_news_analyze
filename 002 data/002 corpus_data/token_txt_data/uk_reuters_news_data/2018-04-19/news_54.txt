focus-exxon faces setback in iraq as oil and water mix
iraq
reuters
talks
between
exxon
mobil
and
iraq
on
a
infrastructure
contract
have
reached
an
impasse
iraqi
officials
and
two
industry
sources
said
in
a
potential
setback
to
the
oil
major
s
ambitions
to
expand
in
the
country
more
than
two
years
of
negotiations
on
awarding
the
firm
a
project
to
build
a
water
treatment
facility
and
related
pipelines
needed
to
boost
iraq
s
oil
production
capacity
have
hit
difficulties
because
the
two
sides
differ
on
contract
terms
and
costs
the
officials
and
sources
told
reuters
unless
the
differences
can
be
resolved
the
project
could
be
awarded
to
another
company
in
a
tender
the
officials
said
without
elaborating
on
the
points
of
dispute
losing
the
contract
could
deal
a
blow
to
exxon
s
broader
iraqi
plans
as
it
would
be
handed
rights
to
develop
at
least
two
southern
oilfields
nahr
bin
umar
and
artawi
as
part
of
the
deal
exxon
declined
to
comment
further
delays
to
the
project
could
also
hold
back
the
oil
industry
in
iraq
opec
s
producer
the
country
needs
to
inject
water
into
its
wells
or
risk
losing
pressure
and
face
severe
decline
rates
especially
at
its
mature
oilfields
as
freshwater
is
a
scarce
resource
in
iraq
using
treated
seawater
is
one
of
the
best
alternatives
the
common
seawater
supply
project
cssp
which
would
supply
water
to
more
than
six
southern
oilfields
including
exxon
s
existing
west
qurna
field
and
bp
s
rumaila
was
initially
planned
to
be
completed
in
but
has
now
been
delayed
until
the
cssp
would
be
expensive
and
challenging
but
there
s
opportunity
here
for
exxon
to
get
access
to
resources
on
a
very
large
scale
and
to
achieve
something
and
really
make
a
difference
to
its
own
business
said
ian
thom
principal
analyst
at
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
many
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
companies
like
bp
total
royal
dutch
shell
and
eni
have
operations
in
iraq
where
a
environment
and
strict
contract
terms
have
squeezed
returns
in
recent
years
with
total
oil
production
at
west
qurna
at
around
bpd
exxon
s
presence
in
iraq
is
small
compared
with
dominant
player
bp
whose
rumaila
oilfield
accounts
for
around
a
third
of
the
country
s
total
production
of
around
million
bpd
while
the
firm
is
looking
to
grow
in
iraq
its
geographical
focus
remains
on
the
americas
including
shale
fields
and
brazil
in
contrast
to
rivals
like
france
s
total
and
italy
s
eni
who
have
been
significantly
expanding
their
activities
in
the
middle
east
in
recent
years
the
talks
between
iraqi
authorities
and
exxon
are
still
ongoing
according
to
the
industry
sources
and
officials
from
the
iraqi
oil
ministry
however
the
basra
oil
company
boc
which
is
overseeing
the
project
said
it
could
now
tender
the
project
this
month
in
a
parallel
process
with
the
aim
of
completing
a
first
phase
by
we
have
this
one
approach
but
we
can
have
another
approach
as
well
abdul
mahdi
head
of
the
iraqi
oil
ministry

licensing

contracts
office
told

iraq
chose
exxon
to
coordinate
the
initial
studies
of
the
cssp
in
story
here
here
at
the
time
baghdad
aimed
to
raise
its
oil
production
capacity
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
rivaling
saudi
arabia
that
target
has
been
missed
and
now
been
cut
to
million
bpd
by
from
around
million
bpd
now
iraq
can
probably
get
to
million
bpd
production
without
a
major
seawater
supply
project
but
i
think
they
will
struggle
to
get
to
million
bpd
said
thom
negotiations
with
exxon
fell
through
in
due
to
red
tape
and
cost
disputes
in
the
company
reentered
talks
with
the
oil
ministry
this
time
in
partnership
with
china
cnpc
and
with
the
cssp
folded
into
a
much
bigger
development
project
known
as
the
integrated
south

here
cnpc
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
for
iraq
going
down
the
route
raises
two
major
concerns
how
to
integrate
the
project
between
the
water
treatment
facility
and
the
oilfields
and
how
to
finance
the
project
thom
said
two
iraqi
oil
sources
told
reuters
that
taking
the
path
would
raise
financing
concerns
for
iraq
if
you
decouple
it
it
s
not
the
