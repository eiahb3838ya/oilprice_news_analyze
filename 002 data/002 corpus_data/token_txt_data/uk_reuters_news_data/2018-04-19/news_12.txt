lagos
reuters
president
muhammadu
buhari
has
drawn
criticism
from
social
media
and
the
opposition
alike
for
saying
many
young
nigerians
think
they
need
do
nothing
to
enjoy
free
homes
hospitals
and
schooling
because
they
live
in
an
country
buhari
who
said
last
week
he
will
run
for
a
second
term
in
elections
next
february
made
the
comments
in
london
where
he
is
attending
a
commonwealth
heads
of
government
meeting
more
than
percent
of
the
population
is
below
the
age
of
he
told
a
business
forum
on
wednesday
a
lot
of
them
haven
t
been
to
school
and
they
are
claiming
that
nigeria
has
been
an
oil
producing
country
therefore
they
should
sit
and
do
nothing
and
get
housing
healthcare
education
this
went
down
badly
with
the
very
people
the
will
need
if
he
is
to
remain
leader
of
africa
s
top
oil
producer
the
median
age
in
the
nation
of
around
million
people
is
just
according
to
the
united
nations
his
remarks
prompted
the
ironic
hashtag
lazynigerianyouths
on
twitter
even
though
buhari
a
former
general
who
was
also
a
military
ruler
in
the
did
not
use
the
word
lazy
young
nigerians
cited
examples
of
their
industry
and
fortitude
in
a
nation
where
most
people
live
on
less
than
a
day
public
services
are
poor
and
corruption
is
rife
imagine
living
and
surviving
in
a
country
that
has
no
plan
for
you
and
constantly
tries
to
make
life
hard
yet
we
survive
and
try
to
break
through
we
are
not

others
used
another
hashtag
lazynigeranpvc
in
reference
to
the
permanent
voter
card
pvc
used
to
cast
a
ballot
linking
buhari
s
comments
to
next
year
s
election
dear
lazynigerianyouths
is
around
the
corner
let
us
get
our
lazynigerianpvc
so
that
we
can
show
him
our
laziness
said
one
twitter
user
called
blessmhe
buhari
has
promised
to
fix
the
economy
and
reduce
nigeria
s
dependence
on
oil
but
it
fell
into
recession
in
largely
due
to
low
crude
prices
growth
returned
last
year
but
remains
sluggish
and
four
out
of
every
people
in
the
workforce
are
unemployed
or
underemployed
the
opposition
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
described
buhari
s
comments
as
false
derogatory
and
unpatriotic
most
disheartening
is
that
these
are
the
same
young
persons
who
form
the
highest
demography
of
voters
that
put
their
confidence
in
him
in
it
said
in
a
statement
the
pdp
which
was
in
power
in
has
not
selected
a
presidential
candidate
buhari
himself
still
requires
his
party
s
endorsement
although
many
see
this
as
a
formality
atiku
abubakar
a
former
vice
president
and
erstwhile
buhari
ally
said
he
backed
the
young
i
will
never
refer
to
nigeria
s
youth
as
people
who
sit
and
do
nothing
they
are
hardworking
abubakar
who
left
the
president
s
party
in
november
and
rejoined
the
pdp
said
in
a
tweet
abubakar
who
has
declared
his
readiness
to
run
for
president
in
also
said
their
entrepreneurial
spirit
work
ethic
and
creative
abilities
are
things
of
pride
and
should
be
applauded
bashir
ahmad
a
presidential
aide
tweeted
that
buhari
had
always
applauded
and
celebrated
nigerian
youths
who
excel
in
different
areas
of
endeavour
from
sports
to
academia
and
other
realms
