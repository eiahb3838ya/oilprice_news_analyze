the
son
of
a
key
figure
in
paraguay
s
dictatorship
is
expected
to
easily
win
the
presidency
in
sunday
s
election
but
his
party
is
projected
to
lose
seats
in
congress
complicating
his
legislative
agenda
mario
abdo
of
the
ruling
conservative
colorado
party
promises
to
fight
pressure
to
raise
taxes
on
the
country
s
key
farm
sector
despite
opposition
calls
for
a
levy
on
soybean
exports
recent
polls
show
him
ahead
by
about
points
over
his
rival
efrain
alegre
a
lawyer
from
the
centrist
ganar
coalition
both
candidates
respect
paraguay
s
trajectory
in
terms
of
macroeconomic
stability
and
i
think
that
is
positive
former
finance
minister
manuel
ferreira
told
reuters
abdo
a
former
senator
supports
the
current
structure
of
low
taxes
and
exemptions
aimed
at
stimulating
foreign
investment
and
agricultural
production
in
paraguay
the
world
s
no
soybean
exporter
and
a
major
supplier
of
beef
he
is
the
son
of
the
private
secretary
of
dictator
alfredo
stroessner
who
ruled
paraguay
with
an
iron
hand
for
years
but
abdo
s
commitment
to
democracy
has
not
been
questioned
paraguay
s
economy
has
grown
in
recent
years
social
welfare
programs
have
been
small
and
the
poverty
rate
among
the
country
s
million
population
is
percent
i
see
two
conservative
democratic
platforms
that
do
not
put
institutions
at
risk
said
political
analyst
alfredo
boccia
but
i
do
not
see
a
change
in
the
old
and
tiresome
paraguayan
politics
that
would
make
things
the
next
president
will
govern
for
five
years
without
the
possibility
of
reelection
alegre
has
focused
on
his
promise
of
slashing
electricity
bills
to
take
better
advantage
of
paraguay
s
itaipu
and
yacyreta
hydroelectric
plants
the
polls
indicate
that
after
sunday
s
general
election
the
colorado
party
will
end
up
with
fewer
seats
than
it
has
today
in
congress
while
the
leftist
frente
guasu
coalition
led
by
former
president
fernando
lugo
will
make
a
strong
advance
if
elected
abdo
may
have
to
make
concessions
to
form
alliances
that
give
him
manoeuvrability
in
congress
the
executive
will
have
to
exert
tremendous
leadership
to
bring
together
the
different
sectors
to
support
his
proposals
said
the
president
of
the
association
of
banks
of
paraguay
beltran
macchi
about
million
paraguayans
are
eligible
to
vote
in
the
election
which
will
also
renew
all
seats
in
congress
and
governorships
across
the
country
the
new
president
will
take
office
on
august
