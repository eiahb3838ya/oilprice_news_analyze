in
the

it
is
the
first
step
in
the

process
which

and
exploration
plans
the

passed
by
the
congress
late
last
year
allowed
the
interior
department
to
hold
two
lease

in
part
of
the
when
congress
created
the
refuge
it
designated
the
area
as
a
part
on
the
refuge
s
coastal
plain
where
drilling
could
occur
in
the
future
the
first
lease
sale
could
occur
next
year
if
there
are
no
delays
alaskan
lawmakers
have
been
fighting
for
decades
to
open
the
refuge
republican
senator
lisa
murkowski
said
in
a
joint
statement
with
alaska
s
other
lawmakers
that
the
drilling
would
help

security

vowed
to
fight
the
opening
of
the
reserve

well
as

society
president
jamie
williams
said
the
interior
department
is
pursuing
an
irresponsibly
aggressive
timeline
for
arctic
refuge
drilling
that
reflects
the
trump
administration
s
eagerness
to
turn
over
america
s
public
lands
to
private
industry
for
nobody
knows
how
much
oil
the
refuge
contains
but
the
geological
survey
estimated
in
that
the
area
held
about
billion
barrels
of
recoverable
crude
and
it
is
uncertain
how
much
interest
there
is
from
oil
companies
to
drill
in
the
remote
region
in
december
a
lease
sale
received
only
seven
bids
on
less
than
percent
of
the
million
acres
offered
in
the
national
petroleum
reserve
which
is
less
than
miles
km
from
the
refuge
conocophillips
alaska
inc
in
partnership
with
anadarko
petroleum
corp
submitted
the
seven
bids
still
analysts
at
british
bank
barclays
have
said
if
surveys
show
promising
deposits
the
refuge
could
attract
oil
producers
that
drill
in
frontier
regions
in
latin
america
and
the
middle
east
the
public
meetings
will
be
held
in
anchorage
arctic
village
fairbanks
kaktovik
and
utqiaġvik
the
dates
for
which
will
be
announced
later
the
interior
department
said
in
the
notice
more
meetings
could
be
held
if
there
is
strong
community
interest
