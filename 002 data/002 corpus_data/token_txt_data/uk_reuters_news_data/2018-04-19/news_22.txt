italian
energy
group
eni
is
considering
stepping
up
its
investment
in
nuclear
fusion
potentially
doubling
down
on
a
technology
considered
so
uncertain
that
eni
remains
the
only
global
oil
company
prepared
to
place
a
bet
on
it
eni
and
bigger
rivals
such
as
shell
and
bp
have
been
looking
at
moving
into
renewable
energy
as
climate
change
the
falling
cost
of
solar
and
wind
power
and
a
shift
to
electric
vehicles
raise
doubts
over
demand
for
oil
eni
last
month
committed
million
million
pounds
to
one
of
several
projects
aiming
to
produce
energy
by
fusing
atoms
at
temperatures
as
hot
as
the
sun
a
process
seen
by
doubters
as
still
closer
to
science
fiction
than
commercial
reality
after
the
move
eni
s
head
of
development
operations
and
technology
roberto
casula
said
it
might
raise
its
investment
in
commonwealth
fusion
system
a
firm
created
by
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
mit
which
is
developing
the
project
after
the
transition
to
renewable
energy
the
real
breakthrough
technologically
is
nuclear
fusion
casula
said
adding
the
process
involved
recreating
the
physics
of
the
sun
producing
heat
but
no
emissions
and
very
limited
nuclear
waste
casula
estimates
it
will
cost
billion
to
develop
a
fusion
reactor
by
and
says
commonwealth
fusion
system
is
looking
to
raise
more
funds
and
to
draw
up
an
overall
investment
agreement
with
a
range
of
financiers
casula
and
mit
declined
to
give
the
size
of
eni
s
current
stake
and
the
eni
executive
could
not
say
at
this
stage
how
much
it
would
be
ready
to
invest
he
said
eni
had
signed
a
deal
giving
it
the
right
to
use
the
project
s
intellectual
property
the
eventual
stake
we
ll
have
in
the
company
will
be
decided
when
there
is
an
overall
investment
agreement
depending
also
on
how
much
they
will
raise
casula
said
the
mit
project
is
vying
with
research
teams
in
france
china
and
britain
to
develop
a
reactor
that
can
generate
more
energy
than
the
enormous
amount
that
fusion
consumes
and
can
also
safely
contain
a
mass
of
gases
or
plasma
italy
also
recently
entered
the
race
though
eni
is
sticking
with
mit
saying
the
boston
project
is
unique
in
its
aim
to
produce
electricity
while
others
have
scientific
objectives
all
projects
are
based
on
a
system
known
as
tokamak
which
uses
superconducting
magnets
to
hold
the
plasma
at
temperatures
of
up
to
million
degrees
suspending
it
inside
a
vacuum
chamber
without
it
touching
the
chamber
s
walls
to
make
electricity
heat
produced
by
the
fusion
of
hydrogen
isotopes
is
used
to
spin
steam
turbines
in
the
conventional
way
the
iter
project
is
the
largest
endeavour
with
a
budget
of
around
billion
euros
a
collaboration
between
europe
the
united
states
china
india
japan
russia
and
south
korea
it
is
more
than
halfway
towards
the
first
test
of
its
plasma
by
and
first
fusion
by
unlike
the
mit
project
the
international
thermonuclear
experimental
reactor
iter
team
does
not
plan
to
generate
electricity
saying
this
will
be
further
in
the
future
and
is
being
supported
by
governments
rather
than
the
private
sector
based
on
our
experience
with
the
iter
project
we
feel
the
mit
timeline
to
a
power
plant
in
years
is
very
ambitious
if
not
overly
ambitious
iter
chief
scientist
tim
luce
said
but
if
they
succeed
we
will
celebrate
their
iter
director
bernard
bigot
said
nuclear
fusion
research
and
development
were
being
driven
mainly
by
governments
likening
it
to
the
early
days
of
space
technology
and
suggesting
the
time
had
yet
to
arrive
when
private
investors
would
take
the
lead
in
fusion
research
we
are
only
about
in
the
before
anybody
got
to
the
moon
bigot
said
mit
and
eni
are
more
optimistic
the
team
which
has
built
a
experimental
tokamak
reactor
plans
to
develop
a
system
of
superconducting
magnets
within
three
years
and
build
a
fusion
reactor
within
eight
before
finally
within
years
completing
a
power
plant
generating
electricity
our
goal
is
to
do
things
even
faster
than
that
because
it
is
a
unique
opportunity
right
now
and
with
climate
change
we
should
be
aggressive
and
ambitious
said
bob
mumgaard
chief
executive
of
mit
project
company
commonwealth
fusion
system
he
said
the
mit
and
iter
projects
differed
mainly
in
their
magnet
technologies
and
that
mit
s
system
enabled
it
to
contain
plasma
in
a
smaller
chamber
in
fusion
devices
the
magnetic
field
is
very
important
and
this
will
allow
us
to
build
a
device
which
is
one
sixtieth
the
volume
of
iter
mumgaard
said
adding
that
mit
s
reactor
would
be
the
size
of
a
basketball
court
though
research
into
nuclear
fusion
dates
to
the
some
scientists
doubt
the
technology
can
become
a
commercial
energy
source
within
mit
s
timeframe
the
ability
to
make
these
components
work
in
the
desired
way
in
the
presence
of
such
intense
fields
of
irradiation
is
a
very
big
challenge
said
matteo
passoni
a
nuclear
engineer
and
expert
on
plasma
physics
at
milan
s
polytechnic
university
for
eni
though
its
investment
in
fusion
represents
a
modest
bet
on
a
potentially
big
discovery
a
familiar
equation
to
its
upstream
division
when
it
explores
for
oil
and
gas
arriving
within
years
at
a
commercial
reactor
is
exactly
the
timeframe
we
use
in
upstream
