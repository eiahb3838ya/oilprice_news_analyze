there
is
a

between

with
responses
received
from
there
is
a
wide
dispersion
of
views
and
most
see
only
a
low
risk
of
recession
in
but
the
assessed
probability
increases
significantly
in
and
especially
the
state
of
the
global
economy
is
one
of
the
most
important
drivers
for
oil
consumption
and
prices
so
the
economic
outlook
is
crucial
to
the
calculations
of
opec
and
other
oil
suppliers
the
united
states
now
accounts
for
less
than
of
global
economic
activity
but
the
rest
of
the
world
is
unlikely
to
grow
strongly
if
the
united
states
is
in
recession
so
it
makes
a
useful
proxy
for
global
growth
predicting
turning
points
in
the
economic
and
trade
cycles
is
notoriously
difficult
but
the
current
global
expansion
shows
increasing
signs
of
maturity
and
escalating
trade
tensions
create
clear
downside
risks
opec
and
its
allies
as
well
as
other
oil
producers
need
to
incorporate
the
increasing
probability
of
a
recession
and
global
slowdown
when
projecting
oil
consumption
and
prices
in
and
the
current
economic
expansion
started
in
july
and
is
already
months
old
according
to
the
business
cycle
dating
committee
of
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
the
current
expansion
will
become
the
on
record
next

surpassing
the
long
boom
of

if
the
economy
is
still
expanding
in

it
will
become
the
longest

passing
the
long
boom
of
the
the
expansion
is
part
of
a
synchronised
global
upturn
in
industrial
activity
and
trade
that
is
lifting
consumption
of
oil
and
other
commodities
the
global
economy
continues
to
display
momentum

is
predicted
to
remain

global
trade
volumes
increased
last

at
the
fastest
rate
since
when
the
global
economy
was
still
rebounding
from
the
financial

according
to
the
world
trade
organisation
the

forecasts
trade
will
grow
nearly
as
fast
in
and
which
would
be
the
best
run
of
growth
since
before
the

strong
growth
in
rests
on
policy
choices
wto

the
current
cyclical
expansion
has
considerable
momentum
in
the
short
term
which
should
ensure
that
it
continues
in
the
short
term
but
there
is
increased
anxiety
about
whether
it
will
be
sustained
in
and
both
the
wto
and
the
imf
have
warned
about
potential
downside
risks
arising
from
increasing
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
the
recent
exchange
of
tariff
threats
between
washington
and
beijing
contains
a
substantial
element
of
bluffing
so
it
is
hard
to
estimate
the
risks
that
the
threats
will
turn
into
an
actual
trade
war
but
even
if
the
tariffs
are
never
imposed
the
increased
uncertainty
could
have
a
damaging
impact

some

about
