to
an

much
as
it
could
to
defend
market
share
overall
the
equation
is
fairly
balanced

anthony
scott
managing

in

it
depends
on
expectations
at
this
point
bullishness
may
be
stalling
out
and
people
are
asking
what
s
the
next
leg
you
need
to
see
the
next
signal
whether
it
s
a
bullish
or
bearish
traders
said
speculators
continue
to
bet
on
further

compared
with
a
daily
average
of
about
investors
are
eyeing
the
level
on
crude
but
said
that
would
likely
face
resistance
particularly
as
the
speed
and
magnitude
of
the
recent
rally
would
augur
for
selling
pressure
before
long
i
do
think
we
could
see
pretty
quick
but
i
want
to
caution
that
maybe
we
ll
see
the
market
level
out
a
little
bit
in
a
few
weeks

reuters
reported
on

that

even
a

as
a
sign
that

not

also
supporting

is
the
possibility
that
the

might
reimpose

which
could
result
in
further
