and
the

called
the
federal

the
only
problem
our
economy
investors
also
facing

by

and
said
he
would
convene
a
group
of
officials
known
as
the
plunge
protection
there
are
a
whole
number
of
factors
that
have
triggered

including
the

very
modest

from

plan
and
the
government
shutdown
in
the
united

said
investec

we
may
get
some
clarity
on
several
factors
in
early
starting
with
a
clearer
line
of
sight
on
the
prospect
for
a
resolution
in
trade
dispute
but
until
then
there
are
some
msci
s
world
equity
index
which
tracks

in

was
percent
lower
and
down
percent
over
the
past
eight
sessions
the
index
touched
its
lowest
since
early
stocks
have
fallen
sharply
in
recent
weeks
on
concerns
over
slowing
economic
growth
and
efforts
by
the
federal
reserve
to
tighten
monetary
policy
with
the
s
p
index
on
pace
for
its
biggest
percentage
decline
in
december
since
the
great
depression
and
on
the
cusp
of
confirming
it
is
now
in
a

market
the

fallen
nearly
percent
from
its
high
trump
on
monday
blasted
the
independent
central
bank
saying
on
twitter
that
the
only
problem
our
economy
has
is
the
fed
they
don
t
have
a
feel
for
the
meanwhile
the
senate
has
been
unable
to
break
an
impasse
over
trump
s
demand
for
funds
for
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
and
a
senior

said
the

could
continue
into

closed
the

still
under
pressure
from
last
week
s
more
hawkish

exacerbating
fears
about
slowing

and
more
expensive
refinancing
following
years
of
stimulus
said
mike
van
dulken
head
of
research
at
accendo
markets
the
political
uncertainty
has
only
added
to
the
air
of
risk
aversion
with
benchmark
treasury
notes
rising
in
price
to
yield
percent
the
gap
between
two

yields
has
shrunk
to
fewer

point
a
flattening
of
the

sometimes
heralded

many

this
is
consistent
with

that
the
