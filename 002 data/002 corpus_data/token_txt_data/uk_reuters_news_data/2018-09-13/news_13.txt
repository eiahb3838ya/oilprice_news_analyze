asian
shares
won
a
reprieve
on
thursday
as
news
the
trump
administration
has
reached
out
to
china
for
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
raised
hopes
a
deal
could
be
struck
in
the
bitter
tariff
dispute
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
msci

broadest

a

after
it
hit

china
s
shot
up
percent
on
hopes
for
reduced

but
the
excitement
did
not
last
long
and
the

was
almost
erased

only

japan

on

senior
officials
led
by
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
recently
sent
an
invitation
to
their
chinese
counterparts
including
vice
premier
liu
he
to
hold
another
bilateral
trade
meeting
the
development
comes
as
more
than
industry
groups
launched
a
coalition
on
wednesday
to
take
public
its
fight
against
president
donald
trump
s
trade
tariffs
trump
s
tariffs
have
escalated
far
beyond
what
business
groups
once
imagined
as
the
administration
prepares
to
activate
duties
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
hitting
a
broad
array
of
internet
technology
products
and

goods
from

public
support
for
trump
has
fallen
in
recent
weeks
with
democrats
seen
likely
to
capture
the
house
of
representatives
he
probably
needs
some
sort
of
achievements
on
trade
ahead
of
the
elections
said
mutsumi
kagawa
chief
global
strategist
at
rakuten
securities
in
tokyo
so
there
could
be
a
shift
in
his
trade
policy
he
will
surely
keep
his
hard
line
rhetoric
but
his
administration
may
seek
to
make
some
deals
behind
the
scene
he
said
however
many
market
players
remained
cautious
while
we
agree
this
should
provide
relief
the
road
ahead
can
still
be
tricky
said
tai
hui
chief
market
strategist
for
jp
morgan
asset
management
in
hong
kong
noting
concessions
china
made
earlier
this
year
did
not
satisfy
trump
china
may
not
be
able
to
offer
much
more
than
that
especially
if
this
involves
adjusting
its
made
in
china
policy
he
said
in
a
note
still
any
serious
signs
of
easing
in
trade
tensions
should
benefit
shares
in
china
and
other
asian
courtiers
the
most
given
they
have
borne
the
brunt
of
protectionist
moves
the
trade
tensions
have
hammered
global
riskier
assets
over
the
past
few
months
as
policymakers
and
investors
worried
about
the
hit
to
the
world
economy
msci
s
broad
emerging

index
has
fallen
more
than
percent
from
its
peak
in
january
entering
bear
market
territory
in
the

market
the

eased
a
little
on
the

hopes

well
as
on
soft

which
undermined
the
case
for
a
faster
pace

tightening

the
federal

august
recording
their

denting

this

the

sterling

high

lawmakers
in
british
prime

theresa
may

support
for
her
to
stay
in

the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
england
hold
policy
meetings
on
thursday
but
both
are
widely
expected
to
leave
interest
rates
unchanged
perhaps
attracting
more
attention
is
a
policy
meeting
by
the
turkish
central
bank
which
is
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
to
shore
up
its
battered
lira
the
lira
has
lost
more
than
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
this
year
hit
by
worries
over
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
grip
on
monetary
policy
and
by
a
diplomatic
spat
between
ankara
and
washington
the
lira
crisis
has
spread
to
some
other
emerging
market
countries
with
weak
economic
fundamentals
such
as
sizable
current
account
deficits
the
lira
traded
at
per
dollar
up
about
percent
on
the
week
and
well
off
its
record
low
of
reached
one
month
ago
oil

fell
reversing
some
of
the
strong

from
the
previous

about

brent
