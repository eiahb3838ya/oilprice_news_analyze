patchy
politicised
and
poorly
coordinated
aid
spending
by
the
world
s
top
economies
to
stop
modern
slavery
could
hinder
a
drive
to
end
the
dollar
crime
by
and
erode
public
support
for
such
funding
experts
said
on
thursday
united
nations
research
revealed
exclusively
by
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
found
that
annual
overseas
development
aid
oda
by
the
oecd
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
at
least
tripled
to
million
from
to
the
united
states
was
the
largest
donor
accounting
for
percent
of
billion
pledged
in
this
period
followed
by
canada
and
norway
and
afghanistan
india
and
colombia
were
the
top
recipients
according
to
the
university
unu
report
yet
many
nations
received
small
or
inconsistent
sums
raising
fears
about
the
effectiveness
and
sustainability
of
funding
given
the
dearth
of
data
on
its
impact
modern
slavery
is
increasingly
seen
as
a
major
global
issue
with
an
estimated
million
people
enslaved
but
there
is
growing
scrutiny
on
how
much
is
spent
and
how
well
to
meet
a
goal
of
ending
the
billion
a
year
crime
by
if
in
years
countries
can
t
show
taxpayers
what
bang
has
come
from
their
buck
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
people
will
not
want
them
to
keep
spending
on
the
issue
said
james
cockayne
director
of
the
centre
for
policy
research
at
the
unu
while
the
research
only
captured
a
snapshot
of
global
funding
excluding
private
sector
philanthropic
and
domestic
state
spending
it
sets
a
benchmark
for
future
data
to
spur
countries
to
better
measure
their
interventions
he
said
if
we
don
t
know
what
is
being
spent
where
by
who
and
how
to
achieve
progress
towards
the
target
then
we
won
t
understand
what
interventions
are
effective
cockayne
added
governments
will
have
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
where
they
are
preventing
people
falling
into
slavery
and
how
although
aid
is
just
one
prong
in
the
drive
to
end
slavery
major
countries
from
australia
to
britain
should
spend
more
if
the
goal
is
to
be
met
said
nick
grono
of
the
freedom
fund
million
a
year
is
significant
but
nowhere
near
enough
to
make
a
measurable
difference
said
the
chief
executive
of
the
first
private
donor
fund
dedicated
to
ending
modern
slavery
yet
meeting
the
goal
is
not
all
about
increasing
aid
he
added
it
is
a
question
of
the
political
will
and
priorities
of
donor
countries
and
those
where
slavery
is
most
the
data
found
that
some
of
the
countries
receiving
the
most
oda
were
not
the
nations
estimated
to
be
the
most
affected
by
slavery
with
aid
and
trafficking
experts
suggesting
some
cash
is
pledged
for
political
as
well
as
practical
reasons
politicisation
of
this
spending
would
not
be
surprising
especially
as
migration
is
now
such
a
major
focus
for
many
countries
said
nicola
jones
principal
research
fellow
at
the
overseas
development
institute
odi
a
british
think
tank
rich
nations
have
been
criticised
by
campaigners
for
funding
aid
projects
that
appear
focused
on
preventing
people
in
poorer
countries
migrating
rather
than
falling
into
slavery
some
of
the
united
states
top
oda
recipients
were
colombia
jordan
and
mexico
all
allies
receiving
millions
of
dollars
annually
the
data
shows
yet
none
rank
highly
in
the
global
slavery
index
of
nations
yet
the
unu
researchers
stressed
the
research
did
not
cover
all
forms
of
aid
spending
and
so
did
not
give
a
full
picture
of
funding
whether
from
the
agency
for
international
development
usaid
or
state
or
labor
departments
the
state
department
came
under
fire
in
after
a
reuters
investigation
found
that
diplomats
pressured
the
office
set
up
to
grade
global
efforts
into
inflating
the
rankings
of
strategically
vital
nations
in
its
annual
report
usaid
said
it
would
examine
the
unu
research
before
deciding
whether
to
comment
while
the
state
department
s
office
to
monitor
and
combat
trafficking
in
persons
said
it
considers
a
range
of
factors
in
determining
where
to
allocate
its
funding
in
addition
to
political
will
these
include
analyses
of
where
and
how
other
donors
are
programming
the
capabilities
and
needs
of
organisations
in
the
field
and
the
likelihood
for
sustainability
of
our
efforts
a
senior
official
said
by
email
regarding
global
estimates
there
is
no
exact
or
conclusive
data
that
accurately
reflects
the
total
number
of
people
exploited
the
report
also
found
that
most
countries
receiving
oda
including
nations
estimated
to
be
rife
with
slavery
like
yemen
and
malawi
were
granted
less
than
million
a
year
which
the
researchers
said
were
notably
small
sums
million
a
year
is
a
drop
in
the
ocean
and
would
likely
push
countries
to
focus
on
a
narrow
punitive
approach
rather
than
addressing
broader
social
issues
that
can
lead
to
slavery
said
jones
of
the
odi
a
focus
on
prevention
is
the
unu
researchers
said
the
study
had
limitations
such
as
the
fact
the
data
stops
before
the
adoption
of
the
sustainable
development
goals
sdgs
after
which
donors
like
britain
pledged
large
sums
and
the
omission
of
aid
cockayne
said
aid
projects
must
be
more
precisely
labelled
and
called
for
a
comprehensive
database
of
all
forms
of
global
spending
not
just
foreign
aid
funding
in
order
to
help
the
world
achieve
the
eradication
goal
many
aid
projects
tackle
issues
such
as
migrant
labour
child
marriage
and
poverty
all
of
which
can
fuel
trafficking
but
may
not
be
classed
as
initiatives
experts
say
figuring
out
how
you
identify
and
define
efforts
to
tackle
slavery
is
really
challenging
said
ed
marcum
managing
director
of
foundation
humanity
united
but
the
sdgs
have
created
more
transparency
attention
and
commitment
to
tackling
slavery
and
forced
labour
he
added
yet
increased
spending
aid
or
otherwise
will
have
little
impact
unless
governments
and
companies
seek
to
change
a
global
economy
fuelled
by
exploitation
said
genevieve
lebaron
a
politics
professor
at
britain
s
sheffield
university
if
you
are
looking
at
a
few
billion
aid
dollars
to
undo
the
damage
of
an
economy
that
is
fundamentally
broken
where
corporate
profits
arise
from
vulnerable
and
exploited
workers
it
is
grossly
insufficient
