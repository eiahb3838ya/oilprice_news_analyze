head

strategy
i
just
get
the
sense
this
week
we
are
beginning
to
see
some
light
through
the
washington

invitation
for
trade
talks
received
a
from
beijing
trump
had
earlier
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
practically
all
imports
from
china
unless
the
country
offered
concessions
the
dollar
which
has
been
a
safe
haven
from
trade
disputes
fell
percent
against
a
basket
of
other
major
currencies
consumer
prices
rose
less
than
expected
in
august
as
increases
in
gasoline
and
rents
were
offset
by
declines
in
healthcare
and
apparel
costs
and
underlying
inflation
pressures
also
appeared
to
be
slowing
data
showed
on
thursday
a
slackening
of
inflation
could
slow
the
federal
reserve
s
pace
of
rate
hikes
the
treasury
note
heavily
influenced
by
fed
policy
expectations
fell
in
price
to

on
wednesday
the
euro
rose
percent
to
the
european
central
bank
kept
its
rates
deep
in
negative
territory
as
expected
but
it
continues
to
move
closer
to
normalizing
policy
the
day
s
big
move
in
currency
markets
occurred
in
turkey
s
lira
it
fell
percent
after
erdogan
called
for
rate
cuts
and
then
surged
rising
percent
on
the
day
when
those
calls
were
ignored
the
lira
rally
comes
after
a
more
than
percent
slump
against
the
dollar
this
year
caused
in
part
by
a
diplomatic
disagreement
between
ankara
and
washington
inflation
in
turkey
is
now
almost
percent
and
the
crisis
there
has
spread
to
some
other
emerging
market
countries
with
sizable
current
account
deficits
if
they
hadn
t
hiked
today
then
the
real
risk
was
that
the
lira
would
sell
off
sharply
again
and
the
country
would
swiftly
head
towards
a
balance
of
payments
and
even
a
banking
crisis
said

there
is
concern
that
presidential
candidate
jair
bolsonaro
may
be
unable
to
campaign
even
in
a
likely
vote
after
he
was
stabbed
in
a

event
