u.s. utility solar contracts 'exploded' in 2018 despite tariffs -report
reuters
procurement
of
solar
energy
by
utilities
exploded
in
the
first
half
of
prompting
a
prominent
research
group
to
boost
its
installation
forecast
on
thursday
despite
the
trump
administration
s
steep
tariffs
on
imported
panels
a
record
gigawatts
gw
of
utility
solar
projects
were
procured
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
after
president
donald
trump
in
january
announced
a
percent
tariff
on
panels
produced
overseas
according
to
the
report
by
wood
mackenzie
power
renewables
and
industry
trade
group
the
solar
energy
industries
association
as
a
result
the
research
firm
raised
its
solar
forecast
for
through
by
gw
the
forecast
is
still
percent
lower
than
before
the
tariffs
were
announced
a
gigawatt
of
solar
energy
can
power
about
homes
procurement
soared
in
part
because
the
percent
tariff
was
lower
than
many
in
the
industry
had
feared
the
report
said
seia
strongly
lobbied
against
a
tariff
saying
it
would
drive
up
the
cost
of
solar
and
hurt
the
industry
s
robust
job
growth
in
addition
panel
prices
have
fallen
faster
than
expected
because
china
pulled
back
its
subsidies
for
the
renewable
power
source
in
june
creating
an
oversupply
of
modules
in
the
global
market
that
has
eroded
the
impact
of
the
tariff
module
prices
averaged
cents
a
watt
in
the
second
quarter
the
report
said
cents
higher
than
the
same
period
in
but
far
below
the
cents
a
watt
they
hit
late
last
year
as
the
industry
fretted
about
a
looming
duty
on
imports
in
every
segment
of
the
market
except
residential
system
pricing
is
at
its
lowest
level
ever
the
report
said
utility
projects
make
up
more
than
half
the
solar
market
utilities
are
eager
to
get
projects
going
because
of
a
federal
solar
tax
credit
that
will
begin
phasing
out
in
next
year
will
be
the
most
impacted
by
the
tariffs
wood
mackenzie
said
developers
will
begin
projects
next
year
to
claim
the
highest
level
of
tax
credit
but
delay
buying
modules
until
because
the
tariff
drops
by
percent
each
year
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
the
installed
gw
of
solar
accounting
for
nearly
a
third

in
the
second

installations
were
