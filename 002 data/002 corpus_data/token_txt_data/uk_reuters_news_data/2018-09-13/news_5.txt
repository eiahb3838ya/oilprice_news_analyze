consorcio
petrolero
del
golfo
a
small
energy
firm
operating
in
mexico
has
returned
of
an
onshore
area
won
in
a
auction
the
country
s
oil
regulator
said
on
thursday
citing
studies
showing
limited
potential
for
production
companies
operating
in
mexico
have
so
far
returned
all
or
part
of
three
oil
and
gas
areas
mostly
awarded
during
early
auctions
of
the
country
s
flagship
energy
reform
because
of
similar
reasons
as
well
as
high
taxes
and
development
program
demands
this
has
cast
doubt
on
the
sustainability
of
some
projects
in
the
reform
intended
to
open
the
industry
to
foreign
investors
the
partial
return
of
the
area
which
includes
the
benavides
and
primavera
fields
in
the
burgos
basin
in
northern
mexico
was
approved
this
week
by
the
national
hydrocarbon
commision
cnh
the
regulator
said
in
a
statement
the
consortium
based
in
the
state
of
tamaulipas
notified
regulators
of
its
decision
earlier
this
year
technical
studies
showed
no
potential
to
produce
hydrocarbons
the
regulator
cited
the
consortium
as
saying
the
firm
still
has
to
complete
the
minimum
development
plan
and
other
commitments
approved
by
the
commission
canamex
energy
holdings
a
consortium
of
dutch
and
mexican
firms
received
government
approval
to
terminate
a
license
to
produce
crude
and
gas
at
the
moloacan
field
due
to
difficulties
in
paying
taxes
and
other
fees
canamex
had
offered
a
percent
royalty
the
highest
in
that
bidding
round
in
august
a
consortium
led
by
capricorn
energy
and
mexico
s
citla
energy
requested
to
return
a
portion
of
a
area
won
earlier
this
year
it
told
the
regulator
its
block
was
near
an
environmentally
protected
zone
very
high
royalties
jeopardize
the
projects
economic
viability
many
relatively
new
operators
did
this
said
pablo
medina
research
vice
president
of
consultancy
welligence
in
houston
it
would
make
sense
offering
these
areas
again
questions
are
under
which
terms
and
who
would
be
interested
as
the
country
s
political
context
has
changed
he
added
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
will
take
office
in
december
said
in
august
that
auctions
for
oil
and
gas
areas
are
suspended
until
existing
contracts
are
reviewed
by
his
government
it
is
still
unclear
if
february
tenders
and
a
pemex
s
search
for
a
partner
will
be
halted
