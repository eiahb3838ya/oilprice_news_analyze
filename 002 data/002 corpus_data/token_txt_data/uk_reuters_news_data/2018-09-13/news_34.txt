update 1-global oil demand to top 100 mln bpd but outlook may cloud
london
reuters
world
oil
consumption
will
top
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
next
three
months
putting
upward
pressure
on
prices
although
emerging
market
crises
and
trade
disputes
could
dent
this
demand
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
the
iea
maintained
its
forecast
of
strong
growth
in
global
oil
demand
this
year
of
million
bpd
and
another
million
bpd
in
unchanged
from
its
previous
projection
things
are
tightening
up
the
agency
that
advises
western
governments
on
energy
policy
said
in
its
monthly
report
the
price
range
for
brent
of
per
barrel
in
place
since
april
could
be
sanctions
on
iran
s
energy
industry
which
come
into
force
in
november
have
already
cut
supply
back
to
lows
while
falling
venezuelan
output
and
unplanned
outages
elsewhere
will
also
keep
the
balance
between
supply
and
demand
tight
the
iea
said
but
it
said
rising
demand
could
also
be
checked
as
we
move
into
a
possible
risk
to
our
forecast
lies
in
some
key
emerging
economies
partly
due
to
currency
depreciations
versus
the
dollar
raising
the
cost
of
imported
energy
in
addition
there
is
a
risk
to
growth
from
an
escalation
of
trade
disputes
the
agency
said
the
united
states
and
china
have
imposed
a
series
of
tariffs
on
each
other
s
goods
since
may
that
have
unnerved
equity
markets
while
a
rising
dollar
has
put
emerging
market
currencies
under
pressure
raising
the
energy
bill
for
some
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
importers
demand
from
nations
not
in
the
oecd
group
of
industrialised
countries
led
by
china
and
india
is
expected
to
rise
by
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
this
year
and
by
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
next
year
the
iea
said
global
demand
will
hit
a
high
of
million
bpd
in
the
final
quarter
of
this
year
before
moderating
to
mln
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
the
agency
said
we
are
entering
a
very
crucial
period
for
the
oil
market
the
situation
in
venezuela
could
deteriorate
even
faster
strife
could
return
to
libya
and
the
days
to
will
reveal
more
decisions
taken
by
countries
and
companies
with
respect
to
iranian
oil
purchases
the
iea
said
referring
to
the
day
sanctions
on
iran
take
effect
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
other
producers
decide
to
increase
their
production
it
said
demand
for
crude
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
moderate
in
to
million
bpd
from
an
estimated
million
bpd
this
year
the
iea
said
iran
opec
s
member
is
feeling
the
effect
of
the
sanctions
the
iea
said
crude
output
fell
in
august
by
bpd
from
july
to
a
low
of
million
bpd
while
exports
fell
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
from
a
peak
of
around
million
