more
than
two
dozen
of
the
world
s
largest
cities
are
no
longer
increasing
their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
they
announced
at
a
global
climate
summit
in
san
francisco
the
cities
from
new
york
to
london
said
they
had
reached
the
milestone
even
as
their
populations
and
economies
grew
they
did
so
by
cutting
their
usage
of
energy
growing
their
public
transportation
systems
and
reducing
waste
according
to
cities
a
network
of
large
cities
acting
as
leaders
in
combatting
climate
change
paris
mayor
anne
hidalgo
said
it
was
a
relief
to
finally
share
good
news
on
climate
with
economies
continuing
to
grow
even
as
emissions
stagnate
or
fall
we
can
prove
that
we
can
also
create
jobs
create
opportunities
with
the
ecological
transition
she
told
reporters
global
warming
is
currently
set
to
exceed
the
more
ambitious
limit
of
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
called
for
in
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
according
to
a
draft
report
due
for
publication
in
october
under
president
donald
trump
the
united
states
the
world
s
second
largest
greenhouse
gas
emitter
has
weakened
the
paris
pact
by
announcing
last
year
it
intended
to
pull
out
of
the
deal
so
far
cities
that
have
peaked
their
emissions
are
in
industrialized
nations
in
north
america
europe
and
australia
research
by
found
those
cities
are
home
to
million
people
the
group
said
the
absence
of
developing
world
cities
from
the
list
suggests
they
may
need
more
funding
to
make
needed
changes
hidalgo
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
must
strive
toward
funds
going
toward
the
ecological
and
energy
transition
where
it
is
most
urgent
including
in
developing
cities
she
said
michael
burger
executive
director
of
the
sabin
center
for
climate
change
law
at
new
york
s
columbia
university
said
it
was
expected
that
poorer
countries
many
of
them
still
growing
might
still
see
emissions
increases
it
is
a
fact
that
countries
are
on
different
development
pathways
and
so
different
cities
are
going
to
peak
emissions
at
different
times
he
said
demonstrations
and
stunts
by
activists
