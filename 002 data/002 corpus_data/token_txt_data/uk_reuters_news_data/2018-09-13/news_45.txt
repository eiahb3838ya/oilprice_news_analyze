brazilian
and
australian
sugar
industry
groups
are
working
together
with
their
respective
governments
to
prepare
a
formal
complaint
to
the
world
trade
organization
wto
over
any
possible
sugar
export
subsidy
by
india
a
top
brazilian
sugar
official
told
reuters
brazil
and
australia
view
any
subsidy
by
india
set
to
take
over
as
the
world
s
largest
sugar
producer
this
year
as
a
grave
threat
to
a
recent
price
recovery
eduardo
le達o
executive
director
at
brazil
s
cane
industry
group
unica
said
in
an
interview
the
two
countries
reached
a
consensus
regarding
the
need
to
act
at
the
wto
level
if
india
moves
to
provide
an
export
subsidy
to
sugar
producers
le達o
told
reuters
late
tuesday
analysts
and
sugar
traders
are
expecting
such
a
move
by
india
as
the
country
would
be
willing
to
put
in
the
market
a
large
local
surplus
built
after
a
record
crop
this
year
and
amid
expectations
for
another
big
output
in
the
coming
season
we
have
heard
comments
that
india
could
launch
a
export
subsidy
le達o
said
it
is
not
admissible
we
would
seek
an
action
from
the
brazilian
government
he
added
raw
sugar
prices
in
new
york
recovered
slightly
in
the
last
days
since
slumping
to
a
low
of
cents
on
as
a
global
supply
surplus
and
massive
fund
short
position
pressured
values
there
was
no
immediate
comment
from
the
indian
trade
ministry
indian
officials
have
earlier
said
the
country
s
sugar
exports
do
not
violate
wto
rules
as
new
delhi
does
not
give
any
subsidy
for
overseas
sales
india
rather
gives
production
subsidy
to
its
cane
growers
the
unica
director
said
there
are
talks
going
on
with
australian
sugar
industry
representatives
for
a
joint
strategy
at
the
wto
if
the
need
arises
australia
s
minister
for
trade
simon
birmingham
on
thursday
declined
to
confirm
or
deny
plans
for
a
formal
complaint
though
he
confirmed
canberra
s
frustration
it
is
clear
that
export
subsidies
introduced
recently
by
the
india
and
pakistan
governments
have
contributed
to
a
growing
glut
on
global
markets
birmingham
said
in
an
emailed
statement
to
reuters
has
expressed
its
concerns
to
the
india
and
pakistan
governments
at
the
highest
levels
in
the
clearest
possible
australia
one
the
world
s
largest
sugar
exporters
is
expected
to
produce
a
near
record
crop
of
million
tonnes
this
year
the
australian
bureau
of
agricultural
and
resource
economics
and
sciences
estimated
we
know
the
market
fell
due
to
a
coincidence
of
large
productions
in
europe
thailand
and
india
but
things
are
improving
now
production
is
falling
so
we
don
t
see
the
need
for
a
export
subsidy
from
india
le達o
said
market
estimates
put
indian
sugar
surplus
at
about
million
tonnes
that
sugar
is
priced
above
current
market
so
to
stimulate
exports
the
government
would
need
to
help
mills
unica
s
director
said
indian
mills
will
eventually
be
able
to
sell
in
the
export
market
as
prices
continue
to
recover
he
said
the
brazilian
government
is
willing
to
back
their
plans
they
are
sensitive
to
this
due
to
the
difficult
financial
situation
of
many
mills
brazil
decided
on
to
open
a
consultation
at
the
wto
regarding
chinese
safeguards
on
sugar
imports
