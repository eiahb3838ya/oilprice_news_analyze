for
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
raised

a

could
be
struck
in
the
bitter

dispute
between
the
world

two
biggest
economies
msci

on

to
take
public
its
fight
against
president
donald
trump
s
trade
tariffs
trump

public

has
fallen

needs
some
sort
of
achievements
on

ahead
of
the
elections
said
mutsumi
kagawa
chief
global
strategist
at
rakuten
securities
so
there
could
be
a
shift
in
his
trade
policy
he
will
surely
keep
his
hard
line
rhetoric
but
his
administration
may
seek
to
make
some
deals
behind
the
scene
he
said
any
serious
signs
of
easing
in
trade
tensions
should
benefit
shares
in
china
and
other
asian
courtiers
the
most
given
they
have
borne
the
brunt
of
protectionist
moves
the
trade
tensions
have
hammered
global
riskier
assets
over
the

makers

investors
worried
about
the
hit
