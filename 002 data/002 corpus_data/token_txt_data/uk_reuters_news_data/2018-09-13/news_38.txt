the

senior

led
by

recently
sent
an
invitation
to
their
chinese
counterparts
including
vice
premier
liu
he
to
hold
another
bilateral
trade
meeting
the
development
comes
as
more
than
industry
groups
launched
a
coalition
on
wednesday
to
take
public
its
fight
against
president
donald
trump
s
trade
tariffs
trump
s
tariffs
have
escalated
far
beyond
what
business
groups
once
imagined
as
the
administration
prepares
to
activate
duties
on

worth

goods
hitting
a
broad
array
of

public
support
for
trump
has
fallen
in
recent
weeks
with
democrats
seen
likely
to
capture
the
house
of
representatives
he
probably
needs
some
sort
of
achievements
on
trade
ahead
of
the
elections
said
mutsumi
kagawa
chief
global
strategist
at
rakuten
securities
in
tokyo
so
there
could
be
a
shift
in
his
trade
policy
he
will
surely
keep
his
hard
line
rhetoric
but
his
administration
may
seek
to
make
some
deals
behind
the
scene
he
said
however
many
market
players
remained
cautious
while
we
agree
this
should
provide
relief
the
road
ahead
can
still
be
tricky
said
tai
hui
chief
market
strategist
for
jp
morgan
asset
management
in
hong
kong
noting
concessions
china
made
earlier
this
year
did
not
satisfy
trump
china
may
not
be
able
to
offer
much
more
than
that
especially
if
this
involves
adjusting
its
made
in
china
policy
he
said
in
a
note
still
any
serious
signs
of
easing
in
trade
tensions
should
benefit
shares
in
china
and
other
asian
courtiers
the
most
given
they
have
borne
the
brunt
of
protectionist
moves
the
trade
tensions
have
hammered
global
riskier
assets
over
the
past
few
months
as
policymakers
and
investors
worried
about
the
hit
to
the
world
economy
msci
s
broad
emerging
markets
index
has
fallen
more
than
percent
from
its
peak
in
january
entering
bear
market
territory
this
perception
that
growth
in
the
us
is
strong
and
the
rest
is
weak
should
reverse
i
already
see
some
signs
of
that
in
economic
surprise
indicators
the
gap
in
economic
expectations
between
the
and
europe
or
japan
is
too
wide
said
luca
paolini
chief
strategist
of
pictet
asset
management
noting
stocks
now
account
for
percent
of
the
developed
market
that
is
the
highest

since

the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
england
hold
policy
meetings
on
thursday
but
both
are
widely
expected
to
leave
interest
rates
unchanged
perhaps
attracting
more
attention
is
a
policy
meeting
by
the
turkish
central
bank
which
is
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
to
shore
up
its
battered
lira
the
lira
has
lost
more
than
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
this
year
hit
by
worries
over
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
grip
on

policy

by
a

spat
between
ankara
and
washington
the
lira
crisis
has
spread
to
some
other
emerging

countries
with
weak
economic
fundamentals
such
as
sizable
current

the
