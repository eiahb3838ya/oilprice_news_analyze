turkey
sent
world

higher
on
thursday
as

returned
news
that

donald
trump
s
administration
had
put
out
feelers
to
beijing
for
a
new
round
of

offsetting

which
was
being
held

beaten
up
emerging

also
made
ground
as
turkey
central
bank
made
a
rare
show
of
independence
ignoring
a
fresh
bashing
from
president
tayyip
erdogan
and
jacking
up
its
interest
rates
by
basis

to

it
all
helped

pointed
to
wall
street
inching
up
again
too
when

reopens
there
have
been
a
lot
of
obvious
headwinds
to

appetite
over
the
summer

head
of

michael
metcalfe
i
just
get
the
sense
this
week
we
are
beginning
to
see
some
light
through
the
washington
s
invitation
for
trade
talks
received
a
from
beijing
and
probably
came
as
a
relief
after
trump
had
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
practically
all
imports
from
china
in
the
absence
of
significant
concessions
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
had
began
to
grind
higher
again
having
been
dampened
by
wednesday
s
soft
wholesale
price
data
which
had
undermined
the
case
for
a
faster
pace
of
interest
rate
hikes
by
the
federal
reserve
producer
prices
unexpectedly
fell
in
august
recording
their
first
drop
in
years
and
denting
talk
of
accelerating
inflation
following
last
week
s
strong
jobs
and
wage
data
but
the
day
s
big
move
was
turkey
s
lira
which
swung
almost
percent
in
a
wild
few
hours
it
had
fallen
percent
after
president
erdogan
had
called
for
rate
cuts
rather
than
rate
hikes
and
then
surged
to
be
percent
up
on
the
day
when
those
calls
were
spectacularly
ignored
the
day
s
other
central
bank
meetings
were
far
less
eventful
while
a
drop
in
demand
sent
the
yen
down
percent
to
per
dollar
the
euro
hovered
around
as
the
ecb
kept
its
interest
rates
deep
in
negative
territory
as
widely
expected
sterling
barely
budged
from
near
a
high
of
as
the
bank
of
england
keep
britain
rates
at
percent
the
main
thing
left
for
traders
to
navigate
was
the
ecb
s
news
conference
which
this
time
will
include
a
update
of
its
economic
forecasts
the
lira
rally
comes
after
a
more
than
percent
slump
against
the
dollar
so
far
this
year
hit
by
worries
over
president
tayyip
erdogan
hold
over
monetary
policy
and
by
a
diplomatic
spat
between
ankara
and
washington
inflation
in
turkey
is
now
almost
percent
and
the
crisis
has
also
spread
to
some
other
emerging
market
countries
with
weak
economic
fundamentals
such
as
sizable
current
account
deficits
hiking
today
does
get
turkey
on
the
slow
road
to
recovering
some
monetary
policy
credibility
and
that
is
critical
said
aberdeen
standard
investments
head
of
emerging
market
debt
brett
diment
if
they
hadn
t
hiked
today
then
the
real
risk
was
that
the
lira
would
sell
off
sharply
again
and
the
country
would
swiftly
head
towards
a
balance
of
payments
and
even
a
banking
the
lira
was
up
at
per
dollar
well
off
its
record
low
of
reached
a
month
ago
among
commodities
oil
prices
fell
reversing
some
of
the
strong
gains
from
the
previous
session
as
economic
concerns
raised
doubts
about

growth
brent

but

trading

yields
were
little
changed
meanwhile
with
the
market
largely
sidelined
ahead
of
the
european
central
bank
meeting
and
news
conference
italy
s
debt
market
was
the
outlier
with
yields
rising
there
as
traders
absorbed
almost
billion
euros
of
new
bonds
as
well
as
a
fresh
wave
of
noise
on
the
budget
our
sense
is
that
we
will
get
a
dovish

conference
