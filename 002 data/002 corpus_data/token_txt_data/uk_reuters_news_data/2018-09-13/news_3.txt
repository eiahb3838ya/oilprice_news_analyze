the
world
s
largest
sugarcane
processing
plant
a
brazilian
mill
able
to
process
million
tonnes
per
year
has
recorded
a
drop
in
cane
crushing
for
the
second
consecutive
season
because
of
excessive
dryness
in
sao
paulo
state
an
executive
said
on
thursday
brazil
s
the
world
s
largest
cane
growing
region
will
likely
have
a
smaller
crop
this
year
for
the
fourth
consecutive
year
besides
the
weather
analysts
blame
factors
including
companies
reducing
investment
but
the
owner
of
the
mill
sao
sao
martinho
sa
is
one
of
the
few
companies
in
the
brazilian
sugar
industry
that
has
stayed
in
the
black
having
reported
profits
for
almost
every
quarter
in
the
last
four
years
while
maintaining
normal
levels
of
cane
field
renovation
and
crop
care
the
mill
s
cane
crushing
capacity
will
fall
primarily
because
of
drier
soil
caused
by
less
rain
and
contributing
to
a
smaller
crop
the
executive
said
it
has
been
like
that
for
the
last
four
years
or
so
drier
said
mário
ortiz
gandini
the
head
of
agriculture
and
technology
at
sao
martinho
sa
which
owns
the
mill
in
the
municipality
of
pradópolis
ribeirão
preto
region
gandini
hopes
the
dryness
is
not
a
permanent
trend
he
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
event
organized
by
machine
maker
case
ih
to
present
a
new
cane
harvester
i
prefer
to
believe
that
this
is
temporary
i
don
t
think
it
is
a
new
pattern
gandini
said
the
sao
martinho
executive
said
that
temperature
fluctuations
in
the
pacific
ocean
which
drive
the
climate
phenomenon
known
as
el
niño
and
la
niña
are
impacting
rain
levels
and
are
likely
to
blame
for
the
dryness
the
company
uses
data
measuring
pacific
ocean
temperatures
to
plan
forward
operations
he
said
the
average
cane
production
in
the
hectares
around
the
usina
sao
martinho
in
pradópolis
is
likely
to
reach
tonnes
per
hectare
in
the
current
season
gandini
said
down
from
tonnes
per
hectare
in
the
previous
crop
and
a
historic
average
of
tonnes
per
hectare
gandini
said
the
region
s
fields
were
experiencing
rains
and
next
year
s
production
will
depend
on
rains
from
october
to
february
