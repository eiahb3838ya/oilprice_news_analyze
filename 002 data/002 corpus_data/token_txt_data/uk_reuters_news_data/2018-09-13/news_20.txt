trump
had
earlier
threatened
to
impose
tariffs
on
practically
all
imports
from
china
unless
the

offered
concessions
the
dollar
which
has
been
a
safe
haven
from

disputes
fell
percent
against
a
basket
of

major

consumer
prices
rose
less
than

in

as
increases
in
gasoline
and
rents
were
offset
by
declines
in
healthcare
and
apparel
costs

underlying
inflation
pressures

appeared
to
be

president
mario
draghi
said
the
strength
of
the
european
economy
continues
to
support
confidence
but
added
that
inflation
is
likely
to
hover
at
current
levels
the
ecb
kept
its
rates
deep
in
negative
territory
as
expected
the
day
s
big
move
in
currency
markets
occurred
in
turkey
s
lira
it
fell
percent
after
erdogan
called
for
rate
cuts
and
then
surged
to
be
up
percent
on
the
day
when
those
calls
were
ignored
the
lira
s
rally
comes
after
a
more
than
percent
slump
against
the
dollar
this
year
caused
in
part
by
a
diplomatic
disagreement
between
ankara
and
washington
inflation
in
turkey
is
now
almost

the

there
has
spread

some

weak

as

get
turkey
on

that
is
critical

if
they
hadn
t
hiked
today
then
the
real
risk
was
that
the
lira
would
sell
off
sharply
again
and
the
country
would
swiftly
head
towards
a
balance
