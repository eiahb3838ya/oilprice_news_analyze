ophir
energy
wrote
down
the
value
of
its
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
in
equatorial
guinea
by
million
million
pounds
as
it
struggles
to
finance
it
ahead
of
a
december
deadline
the
oil
and
gas
producer
also
announced
job
cuts
and
said
it
would
shift
its
headquarters
to
asia
where
it
recently
acquired
new
assets
and
where
a
new
chief
executive
would
be
based
ophir
s
shares
were
almost
percent
lower
at
gmt
at
pence
its
share
price
has
fallen
by
more
than
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
due
largely
to
its
failure
to
progress
with
the
lng
project
ophir
s
ceo
nicholas
cooper
was
replaced
in
may
as
part
of
a
shake
up
the
fortuna
project
would
have
been
the
first
floating
lng
facility
in
west
africa
using
the
pioneering
technology
of
an
offshore
lng
production
plant
but
ophir
has
little
experience
in
complex
lng
projects
and
a
small
balance
sheet
in
the
end
the
fortuna
project
was
beaten
by
the
hilli
floating
lng
project
using
the
same
technology
in
neighbouring
cameroon
on
fortuna
we
are
continuing
to
work
to
deliver
value
for
our
shareholders
whilst
we
are
in
possession
of
the
licence
reflecting
the
uncertainty
surrounding
this
however
we
have
impaired
the
value
of
the
asset
to
million
it
said
ophir
ran
into
problems
trying
to
raise
billion
for
the
project
and
was
told
by
the
government
it
may
lose
it
if
it
did
not
come
up
with
the
cash
by
december
it
then
lost
schlumberger
as
a
partner
although
veteran
lng
vessel
operator
golar
which
runs
the
hilli
flng
project
remains
on
board
the
company
said
last
week
it
was
cautiously
optimistic
about
the
project
but
in
a
nod
to
the
troubles
it
has
had
with
it
ophir
said
it
would
minimise
its
exposure
to
frontier
exploration
and
focus
on
nearer
field
exploration
opportunities
that
can
drive
production
growth
extend
field
life
it
said
revenue
for
the
first
half
of
the
year
rose
percent
to
million
helped
by
higher
prices
with
production
at
barrels
of
oil
per
day
slightly
above
expectations
