novak
said
earlier
this

that
his

could
raise

the

producers
including
russia
will
meet
in
algeria
to
discuss
the

situation
during
the
meeting
with
perry
novak
said
he
proposed
creating
a
joint
investment
fund
to
develop
new
projects
adding
the
russian
direct
investment
fund
rdif
could
be
part
of
such
a
fund
the
rdif
supports
this
idea
and
will
propose
possible
parameters
for
such
an
arrangement
soon
it
said
in
a
statement
perry
and
novak
also
touched
on
the
topic
of
gas
pipeline
project
nord
stream
that
would
double
russia
s
export
capacity
via
the
baltic
sea
in
july
washington
repeated
a
warning
to
western
firms
invested
in
the
pipeline
that
they
were
at
risk
of
sanctions
saying
moscow
was
using
the
project
to
divide
europe
perry
who
also
met
with
russian
deputy
prime
minister
and
minister
of
finance
anton
siluanov
told
the
officials
that
the
trump
administration
opposes
nord
stream
because
it
would
concentrate
a
single
route
of
russian
gas
into
europe
one
vulnerable
to
disruption
and
risks
of
over
reliance
for
european
customers
his
spokeswoman
shaylyn
hynes
said
the
united
states
is
boosting
its
own
gas
exports
to
europe
including
to
poland
and
lithuania
through
liquefied
natural
gas
or
lng
shipments
lng
is
more
expensive
for
europe
than
gas
pipelined
from
russia
but
washington
is
emphasizing
the
reliability
of
lng
russian
state
energy
company
gazprom
has
in
the
past
cut
off
gas
to
ukraine
and
onward
to
western
europe
during
price
disputes
in
deep
winter
and
imposed
bans
on
customers
reselling
gas
to
other
countries
perry
told
the
russian
officials
that
the
trump
administration
welcomes
competition
on
energy
from
russia
but
moscow
can
no
longer
use
energy
as
an
economic
weapon
hynes
said
novak
said
nord
stream
was
a
commercial
project
which
russia
hoped
would
continue
to
be
developed
and
that
the
united
states
would
approach
rationally
perry
did
not
rule
out
the
introduction
of
sanctions
against
nord
stream
but
said
neither
leaders
of
the
two
countries
nor
their
energy
ministers
wanted
to
get
to
the
point
where
sanctions
against
the
project
would
be
engaged
