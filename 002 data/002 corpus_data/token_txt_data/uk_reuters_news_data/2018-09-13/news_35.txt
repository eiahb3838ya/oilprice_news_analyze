world
oil
consumption
will
top
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
next
three
months
tightening
the
market
and
putting
pressure
on
prices
but
emerging
market
crises
and
trade
disputes
could
dent
demand
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
the
iea
maintained
its
forecast
of
strong
growth
in
global
oil
demand
this
year
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
another
million
bpd
in
unchanged
from
its
previous
projection
things
are
tightening
up
the
agency
said
in
its
monthly
report
the
price
range
for
brent
of
per

in
place
since
april
could
be
the
imposition

energy
sector
have
already
cut
supply
to
lows
while
the
decline
in
venezuelan
output
from
spiralling
economic
crisis
as
well
as
unplanned
outages
elsewhere
will
keep
the
balance
between
supply
and
demand
tight
the
iea
said
global
demand
will
hit
a
high
of
million
bpd
in
the
final
quarter
of
this
year
before
moderating
to
million
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
the
agency
said
as
we
move
into
a
possible
risk
to
our
forecast
lies
in
some
key
emerging
economies
partly
due
to
currency
depreciations
versus
the
dollar
raising
the
cost
of
imported
energy
in
addition
there
is
a
risk
to
growth
from
an
escalation
of
trade
disputes
