dry
soil
after
european
summer
heatwaves
means
farmers
have
been
unable
to
plant
all
the
rapeseed
they
wished
experts
said
on
thursday
the
ground
may
have
been
too
dry
for
sowings
in
parts
of
the
top
four
producers
germany
france
britain
and
poland
high
grain
prices
after
the
poor
european
union
crop
this
summer
also
made
some
farmers
turn
to
cereals
from
rapeseed
europe
s
main
oilseed
for
edible
oil
and
biodiesel
production
we
anticipate
a
fall
in
the
rapeseed
area
firstly
because
margins
are
less
attractive
than
last
year
given
the
rise
in
prices
of
winter
cereals
and
also
because
weather
conditions
are
dry
all
over
the
eu
from
the
south
to
the
north
said
hemeline
macret
of
french
analysts
strategie
grains
drought
caused
serious
difficulties
for
rapeseed
sowing
in
germany
and
analysts
estimate
about
million
hectares
were
sown
down
by
about
hectares
on
this
summer
s
crop
the
dryness
created
major
problems
for
german
sowings
and
i
think
a
considerable
number
of
farmers
gave
up
and
have
decided
to
plant
other
grains
one
analyst
said
seeds
in
a
lot
of
areas
especially
north
germany
also
lack
enough
moisture
to
parched
land
hampered
rapeseed
sowing
in
france
raising
the
risk
that
farmers
will
abandon
some
drillings
france
has
experienced
its
summer
on
record
this
year
a
warm
dry
end
to
summer
increased
the
strain
on
cropland
during
rapeseed
sowing
we
re
seeing
an
accumulation
of
problems
said
fabien
lagarde
of
oilseed
institute
terres
inovia
soil
preparation
was
mostly
done
in
dry
conditions
not
all
intended
sowings
were
able
to
be
carried
out
notably
in
the
north
and
now
the
lack
of
rain
is
hindering
the
emergence
of
rapeseed
crops
in
britain
are
off
to
a
poor
start
due
to
drought
and
the
spread
of
cabbage
stem
flea
beetles
because
of
the
drought
and
the
flea
beetle
issues
we
could
see
a
reduced
production
of
oilseed
rape
said
benjamin
bodart
director
at
crm
agricommodities
bodart
said
rapeseed
planting
had
just
finished
and
the
area
was
expected
to
be
down
on
last
season
flea
beetles
have
posed
a
significant
threat
to
british
rapeseed
after
the
eu
restricted
use
of
insecticides
known
as
neonicotinoids
to
protect
bees
poland
also
suffered
dryness
during
the
rapeseed
planting
window
said
wojtek
sabaranski
of
analysts
sparks
polska
sabaranski
estimates
poland
s
winter
rapeseed
sowings
for
the
harvest
is
not
larger
than
the
hectares
harvested
in
there
are
now
concerns
over
uneven
sprouting
due
to
insufficient
moisture
especially
in
the
western
part
of
the
country
