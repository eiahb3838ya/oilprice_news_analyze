for
when
washington
is
due
to
reimpose
a
first
lot
of
economic
sanctions
in
may
the
united
states
pulled
out
of
a
deal
between
world
powers
and
tehran
under
which
international
sanctions
were
lifted
in
return

of
posing
a
security

countries
they
must
halt

down
from

rials
on
saturday
according
to
foreign
exchange
website
other
websites
said
the
dollar
was
exchanged
between
and
rials
the
rial
has
lost
about
half
of

value
since

because
of
a
weak

financial
difficulties
at
local
banks
and
heavy
demand
for
dollars
among
iranians
who
fear
the
effects
of
sanctions
the
central
bank
blamed
enemies
for
the
fall
of
the
currency

a
rapid
rise
in
the
prices
of
gold
coins
and
the
judiciary
said
people
had
been
arrested
on
charges
that
carry
the
death
penalty
the
recent
developments
in
the
foreign
exchange
and
gold
markets
are
largely
due
to
a
conspiracy
by
enemies
with
the
aim
of
exacerbating
economic
problems
and
causing
public
anxiety
the
central
bank
said
in
a
statement
read
on
state
television
judiciary
spokesman
gholamhossein
mohseni
ejei

television
people
have
been
arrested
for
economic
disruption
and
will
be
soon
put
on
trial
more

be
arrested
tonight
and
many
of
them
face
the
charge
of
spreading
corruption
on
earth
ejei
said
referring
to
a
capital
offence
under
iran
s
islamic
laws
besides
the
currency
fall
the
expected
return
of
sanctions
has
triggered
street
protests
including
by
bazaar
traders
usually
loyal
to
the
islamist
rulers
and
a
public
outcry
over
alleged
profiteering
and
corruption
on
saturday
ejei

been
arrested
over
alleged
profiteering
from
foreign

and
the
illegal
importing
of
luxury
cars
president
donald
trump
has
called
the
agreement
one
of
the
worst
deals
ever
negotiated
but
in
a
bid
to
salvage
the
accord
iran
s
european
partners
in
the
deal
are
preparing
a
package
of
economic
measures
but
france
said
this
month
it
was
unlikely
european
powers
could
put
the
package
together
before
november
on
washington
will
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
s
purchase
of
dollars
its
trade
in
gold
and
precious
metals
and
its
dealings
with
metals
coal
and
software
sanctions
also
will
be
reapplied
to
imports
of
iranian
carpets
and
foodstuffs
and
on
certain
related
financial
transactions
iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
as
much
as
by
this
year
due
to
sanctions
straining
oil
markets
amid
supply
outages
