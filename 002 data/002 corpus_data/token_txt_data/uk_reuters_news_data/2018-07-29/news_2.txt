websites
said
the
dollar
was
exchanged
between

rials
the
rial
has
lost
about
half
of
its
value
since

because
of
a
weak

at
local
banks
and
heavy
demand
for
dollars
among
iranians
who
fear
the
effects
of
sanctions
president

has
called
the

one
of
the
worst
deals
ever
negotiated

in
a
bid
to
salvage
the
accord
iran
s
european
partners
in
the
nuclear
deal
are
preparing
a
package
of
economic
measures
to
offset
the
pullout
however
france
said
earlier
this
month
that
it
was
unlikely
european
powers
would
be
able
to
put
together
an
economic
package
for
iran
that
would
salvage
its
nuclear

iran
s
oil
exports
could
fall
by
