energy
companies
on
sunday
against
working
with
the
greek
cypriot
government
in
carrying
out
exploratory
drilling
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
saying
such
activities
could
damage
regional
stability
the
eastern
mediterranean
is
believed
to
be
rich
in
natural
gas
and
attempts
to
tap
resources
there
have
revived
tensions
between
turkey
and
greece
which
has
a
defence
pact
with
the
internationally
recognised
greek
cypriot
government
turkey
and
cyprus
have
overlapping
claims
of
marine
jurisdiction
and
both
plan
to
carry
out
exploratory
drilling
this
year
ankara
has
diplomatic
relations
only
with
a
breakaway
turkish
cypriot
state
in
the
north
of
the
island
that
no
other
country
recognises
foreign
ministry
spokesman
hami
aksoy
said
exploratory
drilling
by
exxon
mobil
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
with
permission
from
the
greek
cypriot
government
did
not
help
regional
stability
and
would
upset
some
sensitive
balances
we
renew
our
warnings
to
companies
participating
in
the
greek
cypriots
exploration
and
drilling
we
remind
them
that
sharing
the
natural
resources
of
the
island
of
cyprus
relates
to
the
core
of
the
cyprus
issue
aksoy
said
in
a
statement
in
addition
to
our
own
continental
shelf
we
will
start
carrying
out
activities
in
areas
where
the
turkish
republic
of
northern
cyprus
has
given
oil
company
turk
petrolleri
a
license
he
said
last
month
turkey
complained
that
a
greek
frigate
had
hounded
a
turkish
exploration
ship
west
of
cyprus
greece
denied
the
charge
and
cyprus
accused
turkey
of
stirring
tension
breakaway
north
cyprus
which
is
supported
by
ankara
says
any
offshore
wealth
also
belongs
to
its
citizens
as
partners
in
the
establishment
of
the
republic
of
cyprus
in
the
island
was
split
in
after
a
turkish
invasion
triggered
by
a
