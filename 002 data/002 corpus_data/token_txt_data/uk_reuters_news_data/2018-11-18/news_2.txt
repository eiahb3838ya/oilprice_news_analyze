buhari
a
military
ruler
in
the
early
in
became
the
first
opposition
candidate
to
oust
a
president
through
the
ballot
box
his
focus
on
corruption
may
be
offset
by
nigeria
s
slow
growth
the
country
emerged
from
its
first
recession
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
largely
caused
by
low
crude
prices
last
year
in
his
first
term
buhari
ordered
government
revenues
and
funds
recovered
in
corruption
investigations
to
be
placed
in
a
central
bank
account
known
as
the
treasury
single
account
tsa
that
had
protected
government
coffers
from
corruption
when
oil
receipts
which
make
up
of
revenues
were
low
he
said
we
are
committed
to
deepening
the
work
we
started
this
first
term
such
that
the
nation
s
assets
and
resources
continue
to
be
organised
and
utilised
to
do
good
for
the
common
man
he
said
at
the
manifesto
launch
buhari
said
nigeria
had
a
chance
to
make
a
break
from
its
tainted
past
which
favoured
an
opportunistic
few
despite
the
president
s
focus
on
tackling
corruption
there
have
not
been
any
significant
convictions
related
to
graft
in
his
first
term
the
main
opposition
party
has
accused
buhari
of
focusing
on
its
members
which
the
presidency
denies
the
campaign
team
of
opposition
candidate
former
vice

atiku
abubakar
said
buhari
s
manifesto
was
an
and
did
not
address
nigerians
economic
problems
if
the
state
of
the
average
nigerian
has
not
improved
in
the
last
three
and
a
half
years
more
of
the
same
is
obviously
not
what
they
need
it
said
in
an
emailed
statement
abubakar
is
expected
to
unveil
his
policy
plans
on
monday
the
president
set
education
as
a
policy
priority
vowing
to
overhaul
buildings
and
subjects
taught
at
schools
in
each
year
of
the
term
and
retrain
teachers
to
focus
on
science
technology
and
mathematics
he
said
there
was
scope
for
over
million
new
jobs
by
expanding
a
nationwide
vocational
skills
programme
and
improving
access
to
credit
for
entrepreneurs
and
artisans
