paradise
reuters
the
number
of
people
missing
after
california
s
deadliest
and
most
destructive
wildfire
jumped
on
saturday
to
despite
authorities
locating
hundreds
of
people
who
scattered
when
the
camp
fire
tore
through
the
mountain
town
of
paradise
forensic
recovery
teams
sifting
through
the
charred
wreckage
recovered
the
remains
of
five
more
victims
bringing
the
death
toll
to
at
least
authorities
said
of
them
have
been
tentatively
identified
pending
dna
confirmation
butte
county
sheriff
kory
honea
said
much
of
the
increase
in
the
number
of
missing
was
due
to
his
office
s
efforts
to
comb
through
a
backlog
of
emergency
calls
that
came
in
during
the
first
hours
of
the
fire
on
he
said
officials
were
sifting
through
the
list
of
missing
persons
for
duplications
and
people
who
fled
some
people
had
been
located
and
taken
off
the
list
since
friday
he
said
a
lot
of
progress
is
being
made
with
regard
to
that
but
this
is
still
raw
data
honea
told
a
news
conference
the
sheriff
spoke
after
president
donald
trump
visited
paradise
the
small
community
that
was
home
to
nearly
people
in
the
sierra
foothills
miles
km
north
of
san
francisco
before
being
all
but
consumed
by
the
blaze
nobody
could
have
thought
this
would
ever
happen
trump
told
reporters
amid
the
charred
wreckage
of
the
town
s
skyway
villa
mobile
home
and
rv
park
this
is
very
sad
to
see
as
far
as
the
lives
are
concerned
nobody
knows
quite
yet
trump
said
right
now
we
want
to
take
care
of
the
people
who
have
been
so
badly
trump
was
flanked
by
california
governor
jerry
brown
and
gavin
newsom
brown
said
the
federal
government
was
doing
what
it
needed
to
do
including
supporting
first
responders
and
helping
with
and
search
for
victims
the
disaster
already
ranks
among
the
deadliest
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century
people
perished
in
the
big
burn
firestorm
that
swept
the
northern
rockies
in
august
minnesota
s
cloquet
fire
in
october
killed
people
trump
has
blamed
the
recent
spate
of
fires
on
forest
mismanagement
and
he
said
he
discussed
the
issue
with
brown
and
newsom
on
the
ride
into
paradise
asked
whether
the
scenes
of
devastation
had
changed
his
view
on
climate
change
trump
said
no
i
have
a
strong
opinion
i
want
great
climate
and
we
re
going
to
have
that
and
we
re
going
to
have
forests
that
are
very
authorities
attribute
the
high
death
toll
from
the
blaze
dubbed
camp
fire
partly
to
the
speed
with
which
flames
raced
through
the
town
with
little
warning
driven
by
howling
winds
and
fueled
by
scrub
and
trees
more
than
a
week
later
firefighters
have
managed
to
carve
containment
lines
around
percent
of
the
blaze
s
perimeter
besides
the
toll
on
human
life
property
losses
from
the
blaze
make
it
the
most
destructive
in
california
history
posing
the
additional
challenge
of
providing
shelter
for
many
thousands
of
displaced
residents
with
more
than
homes
and
other
structures
up
in
smoke
many
refugees
have
taken
up
temporary
residence
with
friends
and
family
while
others
have
pitched
tents
or
were
living
out
of
their
vehicles
hundreds
of
evacuees
were
being
housed
in
emergency
shelters
set
up
in
churches
schools
and
community
centers
around
the
region
with
more
than
people
remaining
under
evacuation
orders
authorities
said
several
shelters
are
full
and
although
authorities
say
they
still
have
space
for
everyone
hundreds
of
people
have
been
camping
in
tents
and
cars
in
the
area
the
names
were
being
compiled
from
information
received
from
a
special
hotline
along
with
email
reports
and
a
review
of
emergency
calls
that
came
in
on
the
first
night
of
the
fire
honea
said
some
listed
have
likely
survived
but
not
yet
notified
family
or
authorities
others
may
not
have
been
immediately
listed
because
of
delays
in
reporting
them
honea
bristled
at
a
friday
press
conference
when
asked
whether
many
of
those
listed
more
than
a
week
after
the
disaster
were
expected
at
this
point
to
end
up
either
deceased
or
declared
missing
and
presumed
dead
i
don
t
think
it
s
appropriate
for
any
of
us
to
sit
and
speculate
about
what
the
future
holds
he
said
the
sheriff
on
saturday
emphasized
that
authorities
were
largely
relying
on
the
public
s
cooperation
to
determine
who
on
the
list
of
missing
persons
is
alive
i
want
to
tell
people
that
it
s
really
very
important
for
you
to
take
a
look
at
the
list
and
call
us
if
you
re
on
the
list
and
let
us
weather
conditions
have
since
turned
more
in
the
firefighters
favor
though
strong
gusty
winds
and
lower
humidity
were
expected
through
early
sunday
ahead
of
rain
forecast
for
the
outbreak
of
camp
fire
coincided
with
a
series
of
smaller
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
is
linked
to
three
fatalities
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
scientists
have
said
the
growing
frequency
and
intensity
of
wildfires
in
california
and
elsewhere
across
the
west
are
largely
attributable
to
prolonged
drought
that
is
symptomatic
of
climate
change
the
precise
causes
of
the
camp
and
woolsey
fires
were
under
investigation
but
electric
utilities
have
reported
equipment
problems
in
the
vicinity
of
both
blazes
around
the
time
they
erupted
