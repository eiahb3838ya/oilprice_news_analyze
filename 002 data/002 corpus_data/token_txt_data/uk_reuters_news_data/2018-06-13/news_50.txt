paris
june
reuters
french
sugar
group
cristal
union
on
wednesday
said
it
had
scrapped
minimum
prices
for
sugar
beet
farmers
as
it
expects
sugar
prices
to
fall
further
in
after
hitting
historic
lows
last
year
a
surge
in
output
after
the
european
union
abolished
production
quotas
last
year
and
a
slump
in
prices
since
early
in
an
oversupplied
world
market
have
left
many
eu
companies
struggling
with
plunging
profits
the
magic
world
more
comfortable
and
predictable
in
which
the
beet
sector
was
living
has
vanished
the
cooperative
group
said
in
a
statement
french
producers
also
face
uncertainty
linked
to
the
eu
and
the
government
s
hostility
to
some
pesticides
free
trade
negotiations
and
a
hardly
understandable
defence
of
palm
oil
at
the
detriment
of
local
biofuel
producers
it
said
the
group
s
board
therefore
unanimously
decided
to
scrap
the
minimum
price
for
sugar
beet
as
soon
as
the
campaign
cristal
union
said
this
decision
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
sustainability
of
the
group
maintaining
a
minimum
price
would
further
distance
cristal
union
from
the
realities
of
the
market
and
weaken
the
operations
of
its
the
group
had
decided
in
to
offer
its
farmer
members
a
pivot
price
of
euros
per
tonne
of
sugar
beet
pulp
included
for
the
and
harvests
with
the
possibility
of
a
supplementary
payment
if
market
conditions
permitted
french
rival
tereos
which
on
tuesday
said
it
was
considering
offering
a
stake
to
an
international
partner
has
maintained
a
guaranteed
price
of
euros
a
tonne
for
sugar

part
of
a
deal
with
its
members
for
the

the
group

beet
area
rose
percent
last
year

an
average
of
tonnes
per

it
said
french
farmers
have
blocked
access
to
more
than
a
dozen
oil
depots
and
refineries
as
part
of
a
protest
over
plans
to
allow
oil
major

to
use
imported
palm
oil
at
a
biofuel
plant
which
would
compete
with
biodiesel
