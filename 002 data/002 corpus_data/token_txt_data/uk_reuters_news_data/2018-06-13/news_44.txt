oil
demand
will
grow
steadily
in
thanks
to
a
solid
global
economy
but
the
world
may
face
a
large
supply
gap
by
late
next
year
if
opec
can
not
cover
any
supply
shortfalls
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
the
report
serves
as
a
stark
warning
to
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporters
who
meet
next
week
in
vienna
to
discuss
supply
policy
the
iea
said
it
expects
global
oil
demand
to
grow
by
million
barrels
per
day
in
to
top
million
bpd
by
the
second
quarter
of
the
year
the
agency
expects
demand
to
grow
at
the
same
rate
this
year
unchanged
from
its
last
report
in
may
a
solid
economic
background
and
an
assumption
of
more
stable
prices
are
key
factors
risks
include
possibly
higher
prices
and
trade
disruptions
some
governments
are
considering
measures
to
ease
price
pressures
on
consumers
the
agency
said
in
its
monthly
report
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
downward
revision
to
our
economic
assumptions
in
the
next
few
months
the
world
economy
is
feeling
some
pain
from
higher
oil
the
oil
price
has
risen
by
a
third
to
around
a
barrel
close
to
its
highest
since
late
since
opec
and
other
producers
including
russia
began
cutting
production
in
january
by
million
bpd
increasing
trade
tensions
are
the
main
risk
to
our
oil
demand
forecast
the
iea
said
canada
and
the
european
union
have
announced
plans
to
increase
tariffs
on
selected
goods
in
response
to
duties
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
the
risks
associated
with
escalating
retaliations
are
not
negligible
a
prolonged
slowdown
in
trade
would
negatively
affect
world
gdp
growth
and
oil
demand
as
a
significant
part
of
oil
consumption
is
linked
to
trade
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
on
june
to
discuss
its
supply
policy
particularly
in
light
of
protracted
declines
in
venezuela
and
the
prospect
of
new
sanctions
on
iran
later
this
year
the
group
together
with
its
partners
may
consider
raising
output
to
compensate
for
any
supply
shortfalls
even
if
the
supply
gap
is
plugged
the
market
will
be
finely
balanced
next
year
and
vulnerable
to
prices
rising
higher
in
the
event
of
further
disruption
it
is
possible
that
the
very
small
number
of
countries
with
spare
capacity
beyond
what
can
be
activated
quickly
will
have
to
go
the
extra
mile
the
agency
said
if
the
other
opec
members
were
to
continue
pumping
at
the
same
rate
as
may
a
potential
supply
gap
could
emerge
and
lead
to
a
draw
on
stocks
of
more
than
million
bpd
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
report
said
the
agency
said
it
had
looked
at
a
scenario
in
which
by
the
end
of
next
year
output
from
iran
and
venezuela
could
be
million
bpd
lower
than
it
is
today
the
iea
estimated
that
iranian
exports
would
drop
by
the
same
amount
as
they
did
during
the
last
round
of
sanctions
for
venezuela
the
agency
said
it
saw
no
respite
in
the
collapse
in
production
from
economic
crisis
that
has
taken
million
bpd
off
the
market
in
the
past
two
years
opec
s
efforts
in
restraining
output
led
to
commercial
oil
stocks
across
the
world
s
richest
nations
falling
by
million
barrels
in
april
to
a
new
low
of
billion
barrels
the
agency
said
supply
from
outside
opec
is
expected
to
grow
by
million
bpd
this
year
led
predominantly
by
the
united
states
before
easing
to
around
million
bpd
next
year
the
iea
said
recently
this
expansion
has
not
been
without
stress
the
discount
for
wti
crude
versus
brent
has
blown
out
to
a
barrel
amidst
signs
that
takeaway
capacity
is
lagging
behind
output
growth
the
iea
said
to
make
up
for
losses
from
iran
and
venezuela
we
estimate
that
middle
east
opec
countries
could
increase
production
in
fairly
short
order
by
about
million
bpd
and
there
could
be
more
output
from
russia
on
top
of
the
increase
already
built
into
our
supply
the
iea
estimated
demand
for
opec
s
crude
would
ease
in
to
million
bpd
from
a
forecast
million
bpd
this
year
