chief
hadi
s
decision
to
choose
compromise
over
confrontation
and
strike
an
alliance
aiming
to
form
the
next
iraqi
government
has
eased
tensions
after
elections
marred
by
fraud
allegations
sadr
s
bloc
scored
a
stunning
victory
in
the
may
parliamentary
election
by
tapping
growing
public
discontent
with
neighbouring
iran
s
sway
in
iraq
and
promising
to
deliver
what
past
governments
have
not
jobs
better
services
and
stability
but
beneath
the
surface
there
were
fears
that
regional
power
tehran
which
before
the
vote
said
it
would
never
let
sadr
govern
would
sabotage
the
mercurial
cleric
and
set
the
stage
for
a
showdown
that
could
turn
bloody
in
the
end
an
alliance
has
emerged
of
strange
sadr
who
portrays
himself
as
a
nationalist
and
amiri
iran
s
most
powerful
ally
in
iraq
whose
grouping
came
second
their
choice
of
pragmatism
has

s
shi
ite
majority
after
a
costly
conflict
war
with
the
sunni
muslim
militants
of
islamic
state
sadr
is
treading
cautiously
aware
that
iran
has
manipulated
iraqi
politics
in
its
favour
in
the
past
and
of
tehran
s
vast
sway
in
its
most
important
arab
ally
in
a
election
vice
president
ayad
allawi
s
bloc
won
the
most
seats
but
he
was
prevented
from
becoming
prime
minister
blaming
iranian
manoeuvring
if
he
sadr
insisted
on
fighting
everyone
at
the
same
time
he
would
be
outmanoeuvred
and
the
pressure
of
a
of
the
elections
was
too
much
said
a
western
diplomat
in
baghdad
tehran
which
has
thrived
amid
iraqi
shi
ite
rivalries
in
the
past
by
acting
as
a
broker
has
its
own
motivations
sadr
s
alliance
with
amiri
announced
in
the
holy
shi
ite
city
of
najaf
to
project
a
sense
of
unity
gives
tehran
more
leverage
over
the
formation
of
iraq
s
next
government
amiri
who
spent
two
decades
fighting
iraqi
dictator
saddam
hussein
from
iran
and
speaks
farsi
fluently
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
figures
in
iraq
his
badr
organisation
controls
the
interior
ministry
and
he
played
a
decisive
role
in
the
battle
against
islamic
state
amiri
had
the
momentum
behind
him
especially
in
this
election
this
is
an
opportunity
for
him
said
hassan
hassan
senior
fellow
at
the
tahrir
institute
for
middle
east
policy
he
is
fresh
off
the
field
very
popular
in
some
amiri
is
close
to
major
general
qassem
soleimani
commander
of
foreign
operations
for
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
who
has
great
influence
in
iraq
soleimani
was
in
iraq
this
week
a
second
western
diplomat
in
baghdad
said
adding
that
it
is
likely
that
he
advised
amiri
to
ally
with
sadr
who
recently
met
iran
s
ambassador
the
iranians
have
decided
they
must
accept
sadr
the
diplomat
said
and
he
will
have
in
turn
realised
he
must
work
with
amiri
to
safeguard
his
victory
shunning
amiri
could
make
life
difficult
for
sadr
his
foe
former
prime
minister
nuri
is
still
in
the
picture
despite
being
forced
out
of
office
and
widely
blamed
for
islamic
state
s
seizure
of
a
third
of
iraq
in
maliki
ordered
a
crackdown
on
forces
loyal
to
sadr
in
the
shi
ite
heartland
according
to
the
first
diplomat
who
recently
met
sadr
he
felt
pressured
and
feared
his
victory
was
going
to
vanish
acting
on
what
prime
minister
haider
said
were
widespread
violations
a
parliament
stacked
with
lawmakers
who
failed
to
retain
their
seats
mandated
a
nationwide
recount
some
politicians
said
the
election
should
be
repeated
abadi
seemed
to
lose
the
most
out
of
the
alliance
diplomats
and
analysts
said
even
though
he
has
balanced
the
interests
of
iran
and
the
united
states
who
compete
for
influence
in
iraq
his
bloc
has
yet
to
join
any
coalition
he
may
yet
win
a
second
term
as
a
compromise
candidate
albeit
as
a
much
weaker
premier
beholden
to
sadr
and
amiri
iran
does
not
seem
worried
about
the
uncertainty
but
is
under
growing
pressure
to
preserve
its
interests
in
the
middle
east
especially
in
iraq
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
a
nuclear
deal
with
tehran
then
engaged

north
korea
increasing
tehran
s
isolation
in
yemen
houthi
forces
aligned
with
iran
face
the
biggest
offensive
from
a
coalition
in
the
conflict
part
of
a
regional
proxy
war
between
riyadh
and
tehran
there
is
a
certain
element
of
pragmatism
in
iran
on
foreign
policy
said
renad
mansour
research
fellow
at
chatham
house
in
london
iran
does
not
want
iraq
to
collapse
but
it
also
does
not
want
iraq
to
be
too
strong
they
want
a
middle
even
if
sadr
s
deal
with
amiri
succeeds
he
may
have
to
contend
with
grievances
from
members
of
his
own
bloc
who
insist
tehran
would
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
