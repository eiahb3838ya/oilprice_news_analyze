world
stocks
hovered

as
an
expected
interest
rate
rise
and
risks
of
a
fresh

of
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the

states
overshadowed
a

benign
political
and

backdrop

andrew

at

we
are
entering
three
days
of
important
central
bank
decisions
markets
have
pretty
much
priced
what
the

will
do
and
it
is
clear
we
are

milligan
downplayed
the
impact
of
trade
measures
on
global
commerce
but
noted
the
direction
of
travel
is
not
positive
which
is
why
equities
are
not
making
as
much
progress
and
investor
sentiment
is
not
more
investors
see
trade
wars
as
the

the
baml
poll
showed
projections
from
the
fed
s
march
meeting
suggest
a
benchmark
rate
of
percent
at
end
of
that
implies
a
total
of
three
rate
rises
this
year
but
some
reckon
four
increases
are
possible
the
focus
is
on
how
many
times
the
fed
will
raise
rates
this
year
and
next
and
how
much
beyond
the
levels
it
considers
as
neutral
to
the
economy
or
what
they
call
the

such

analysts
say
the

s
plans
could
boost

again
once
the

they
need

commerzbank
