offer
for

company
apa
group
offering
a
hefty
percent

the

would
make

part
of
the
business
empire
founded
by
hong
kong
tycoon
li
the
major
player
in
australia
s
east
coast
gas
pipeline
network
but
it
comes
as
soaring
gas
and
power
prices
have
caused
political
blowback
raising
concerns
it
could
run
into
competition
and
national
security
hurdles
apa
s
shares
rose
percent
to
a
but
closed
well
below
the
offer
price
of
a
per
stapled
security
signalling
investor
uncertainty
over
whether
australia
s
foreign
investment
review
board
firb
and
the
australian
competition
and

would
clear
the
deal
ck
infrastructure
leading
a
consortium
with

asset
holdings
and
power
assets
holdings
said
it
was
already
talking
to
the
regulators
since
the
controversial
sale
of
the
port
of
darwin
to
a
chinese
company
in
the
government
has
been
at
pains
to
demonstrate
limits
to
its
ties
to
china
its
biggest
export
partner
including
blocking
the
sale
of
australia
s
biggest
cattle
station
to
chinese
interests
the
firb
rejected
bids
by
china
s
state
grid
and
ck
infrastructure
for
the
nation
s
biggest
electricity
network
ausgrid
in
as
that
business
served
an
australian

however
ck
infrastructure
ran
into
no
trouble
last
year
with
a
a
billion
takeover
of
australian
pipelines
and
electricity
network
owner
duet
group
adding
to
the
swathe
of
gas
and
power
assets
it
already
owns
across
australia
cki
s
offer
for
apa
a
per
stapled
security
was
well
above
apa
s
last
close
of
a
and
its
record
high
of
a
hit
a
year
ago
it
s
a
decent
premium
what
it
basically
shows
is
there
is
a
disconnect
between
how
the
private
market
wants
to
value
these
assets
and
how
the
stock
market
values
them
said
jason
teh
chief
investment
officer
at
vertium
asset
management
which
does
not
own
shares
in
apa
apa
said
on
wednesday
it
would
evaluate
the
bid
and
agreed
to
open
its
books
for
the
consortium
to
review
it
told
shareholders
to
take
no
action
based
on
the
indicative
price
of
a
cash
per
stapled
security
the
apa
board
considers
that
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
apa
s
securityholders
to
engage
further
with
the
consortium
apa
said
in
a
statement
the
consortium
welcomed
apa
s
decision
to
enter
talks
saying
the
proposal
provided
a
compelling
opportunity
for
security
holders
to
realise
value
apa
s
biggest
shareholder
unisuper
which
owns
a
percent
stake
did
not
comment
on
the
offer
price
but
chief
investment
officer
john
pearce
said
it
fully
supported
allowing
cki
to
conduct
due
diligence
the
competition
watchdog
said
on
wednesday
it
would
take
about
weeks
to
review
the
deal
after
receiving
more
information
apa

gas
transportation
on
australia
s
east
coast
where
the
southeastern
states
are
increasingly
dependent
on
supply
from
queensland
in
the
north
and
where
ck
infrastructure
already
owns
a
gas
distribution
network
jpmorgan
analysts
said
they
doubted
any
rival
bids
would
emerge
but
said
foreign
investment
review
board
approval
may
be
challenging
considering
apa
s
dominant
position
in
gas
pipelines
on
the
east
macquarie
analysts
however
said
plans
by
other
companies
to
build
liquefied
natural
gas
import
terminals
might
ease
concerns
about
lack
of
gas
competition
to
avert

concerns
ck
infrastructure
has
offered
to
divest
all
