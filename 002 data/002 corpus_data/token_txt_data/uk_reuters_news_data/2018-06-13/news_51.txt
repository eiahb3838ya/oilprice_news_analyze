militia
chief
hadi
who
won
first
and
second
place
respectively
in
iraq
s
may
parliamentary
election
announced
on
tuesday
an
alliance
between
their
political
blocs
the
move
announced
from
the
shi
ite
holy
city
of
najaf
is
the
first
serious
step
towards
forming
a
new
government
after
weeks
of
negotiations
between
parties
it
comes
exactly
one
month
after
an
election
marred
by
historically
low
turnout
and
fraud
allegations
the
two
shi
ite
figures
said
they
would
keep
the
door
open
for
other
winning
blocs
to
join
them
in
forming
a
new
government
our
meeting
was
a
very
positive
one
we
met
to
end
the
suffering
of
this
nation
and
of
the
people
our
new
alliance
is
a
nationalist
one
sadr
said
sadr
and
amiri
are
strange
bedfellows
the
cleric
who
once
led
violent
campaigns
against
the
occupation
that
ended
in
has
emerged
as
a
nationalist
opponent
of
powerful
shi
ite
parties
allied
with
neighbouring
iran
and
as
a
champion
of
the
poor
he
backed
in
the
election
the
saeroon
list
composed
of
his
followers
the
communist
party
and
other
secular
candidates
amiri
a
fluent
farsi
speaker
is
iran
s
closest
ally
in
iraq
having
spent
two
years
in
exile
there
during
the
era
of
saddam
hussein
the
fatih
alliance
he
led
in
the
election
was
composed
of
political
groups
tied
to
shi
ite
militias
who
helped
government
forces
dislodge
islamic
state
militants
from
the
third
of
iraq
they
seized
four
years
ago
fatih
and
saeroon
announce
forming
the
nucleus
of
the
largest
bloc
and
call
on
all
winning
blocs
to
participate
in
this
alliance
under
a
government
programme
agreed
upon
by
all
that
is
suitable
to
face
the
challenges
crises
and
problems
facing
iraq
a
fatih
spokesman
said
in
a
statement
the
alliance
which
together
has
seats
short
of
the
majority
needed
to
form
a
government
came
hours
after
prime
minister
haider
who
s
own
bloc
came
third
urged
politicians
to
keep
negotiating
over
government
formation
despite
an
impending
nationwide
manual
recount
of
votes
parliament
mandated
the
recount
after
abadi
said
a
government
report
showed
there
were
serious
violations
a
few
days
later
a
storage
site
housing
half
of
baghdad
s
ballot
boxes
caught
fire
raising
tensions
and
prompting
some
to
call
for
the
election
to
be
repeated
abadi
said
on
tuesday
he
opposed
a
repeat
echoing
the
stances
of
sadr
and
amiri
and
warned
that
anyone
who
tried
to
sabotage
the
political
process
would
be
punished
he
may
yet
secure
a
second
term
as
a
compromise
candidate
if
he
joins
his
blocs
with
sadr
and
amiri
and
manages
to
win
their
backing
the
matter
is
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
not
politicians
the
government
and
parliament
don
t
have
the
power
to
cancel
the
election
abadi
said
of
a
repeat
the
government
report
had
recommended
a
recount
of
percent
of
votes
but
the
outgoing
parliament
in
which
over
half
of
lawmakers
including
the
speaker
lost
their
seats
instead
voted
for
a
nationwide
one
amiri
said
on
tuesday
he
supported
only
a
partial
recount
abadi
called
the
fire
a
deliberate
act
and
said
the
attorney
general
would
bring
charges
against
those
who
are
trying
to
undermine
the
political
process
an
iraqi
court
ordered
the
arrest
of
four
people
accused
of
setting
fire
to
the
storage
site
three
of
them
were
policemen
and
one
an
employee
of
the
elections
commission
abadi
said
a
preliminary
report
had
provided
evidence
of
gasoline
at
multiple
areas
inside
the
storage
site
it
also
showed
that
security
cameras
had
been
disabled
and
no
locks
had
been
broken
implying
it
was
carried
out
by
someone
with
access
to
the
storage
site
iraqi
authorities
said
the
ballot
boxes
had
been
rescued
but
the
fire
has
fuelled
fears
of
violence
sadr
has
warned
that
certain
parties
are
trying
to
drag
iraq
into
a
civil
war
adding
that
he
would
not
participate
in
one
abadi
thanked
sadr
for
a
disarmament
initiative
he
floated
after
a
weapons
cache
at
his
baghdad
stronghold
of
sadr
city
exploded
killing
people
and
said
he
hoped
the
cleric
would
stick
to
it
i
welcome
sayed
moqtada
s
announcement
that
his
followers
commit
to
not
having
weapons
outside
the
framework
of
the
state
we
consider
this
good
he
said
adding
that
those
responsible
for
the
explosion
would
be
brought
to
justice
what
happened
in
sadr
city
is
very
regrettable
it
is
a
crime
those
responsible
will
receive
their
just
sadr
who
ordered
his
own
separate
investigation
into
the
incident
said
on
tuesday
he
had
identified
the
culprit
who
was
now
on
the
run
and
that
he
would
be
brought
to
justice
