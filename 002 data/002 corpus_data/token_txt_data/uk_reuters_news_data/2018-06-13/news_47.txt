oil
demand
will
grow
steadily
in
thanks
to
a
solid
global
economy
and
stable
prices
although
trade
tensions
remain
the
largest
risk
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
the
iea
said
it
expects
global
oil
demand
to
grow
by
million
barrels
per
day
next
year
to
top
million
bpd
by
the
second
quarter
of
the
year
the
agency
expects
demand
to
grow
at
the
same
rate
this
year
unchanged
from
its
last
report
in
may
a
solid
economic
background
and
an
assumption
of
more
stable
prices
are
key
factors
risks
include
possibly
higher
prices
and
trade
disruptions
some
governments
are
considering
measures
to
ease
price
pressures
on
consumers
the
agency
said
in
its
monthly
report
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
downward
revision
to
our
economic
assumptions
in
the
next
few
months
the
world
economy
is
feeling
some
pain
from
higher
oil
the
oil
price
has
risen
by
a
third
to
around
a
barrel
close
to
its
highest
since
late
since
opec
and
other
producers
including
russia
began
cutting
production
in
january
by
million
bpd
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
later
this
month
to
discuss
its
supply
policy
particularly
in
light
of
protracted
declines
in
venezuela
and
the
prospect
of
new
sanctions
on
iran
later
this
year
the
group
together
with
its
partners
may
consider
raising
output
to
compensate
for
any
supply
shortfalls
if
the
other
opec
members
were
to
continue
pumping
at
the
same
rate
as
may
a
potential
supply
gap
could
emerge
and
lead
to
a
draw
on
stocks
of
more
than
million
bpd
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
report
said
supply
from
outside
opec
is
expected
to
grow
by
million
bpd
this
year
led
predominantly
by
the
united
states
before
easing
to
around
million
bpd
next
year
