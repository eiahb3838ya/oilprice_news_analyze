update 5-trump, iran spar over oil prices ahead of opec meeting
reuters
president
donald
trump
and
iran
exchanged
sharp
words
over
oil
prices
on
wednesday
with
trump
blaming
opec
for
high
oil
prices
and
tehran
accusing
him
of
stoking
volatility
after
he
withdrew
last
month
from
a
global
nuclear
arms
deal
with
iran
trump
sparked
the
latest
when
he
renewed
his
attack
on
opec
in
a
tweet
that
said
oil
prices
are
too
high
and
that
the
cartel
was
at
it
oil
prices
have
risen
around
percent
over
the
last
year
after
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
some
producers
including
russia
started
reducing
supplies
in
the
cartel
meets
june
in
vienna
and
producers
are
seen
as
likely
to
raise
production
perhaps
before
the
limits
are
due
to
sunset
at
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
fired
back
at
trump
in
a
statement
to
reuters
you
can
not
place
sanctions
on
two
opec
founder
members
and
still
blame
opec
for
oil
price
volatility
he
said
referring
to
his
country
and
venezuela
this
is
business
president
we
thought
you
knew
the
oil
supply
deal
is
set
to
continue
through
the
end
of
but
plans
for
its
continuation
were
unclear
the
calculus
changed
after
trump
announced
in
may
that
washington
was
pulling
out
of
the
deal
that
restricted
iran
s
nuclear
program
in
exchange
for
the
removal
of
sanctions
the
move
has
pressured
european
and
asian
clients
to
stop
importing
iranian
oil
or
doing
business
with
the
country
saudi
arabia
iran
s
rival
and
opec
s
largest
producer
and
russia
the
world
s
largest
producer
and
a
party
to
the
deal
have
already
increased
supply
saudi
arabia
supported
trump
s
decision
to
exit
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
i
think
the
trump
tweet
makes
the
saudis
job
of
getting
compromise
at
the
opec
meeting
tougher
said
joe
mcmonigle
senior
energy
policy
analyst
at
hedgeye
potomac
research
in
washington
saudi
production
rose
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
may
in
line
with
deal
quotas
according
to
opec
data
russia
s
production
was
million
barrels
a
day
in
the
beginning
of
june
exceeding
its
quota
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
price
of
brent
crude
peaked
in
may
at
a
barrel
then
pulled
back
trading
on
wednesday
near
at
barrel
partly
in
anticipation
that
the
deal
may
end
crude
traded
wednesday
near
a
barrel
oil
prices
are
too
high
opec
is
at
it
again
not
good
trump
wrote
in
his
post
on
twitter
after
last
raising
the
issue
in
april
the
potential
for
opec
to
boost
production
has
raised
concerns
about
the
cartel
s
limited
spare
capacity
which
could
fall
to
as
low
as
million
bpd
this
would
make
it
harder
to
respond
to
a
supply
shock
such
as
in
venezuela
where
output
has
declined
to
a
due
to
an
economic
crisis
opec
has
the
lowest
spare
capacity
ever
right
now
said
fund
manager
pierre
andurand
in
a
tweeted
response
to
trump
there
is
going
to
be
a
real
issue
he
wrote
predicting
prices
above
per
barrel
within
two
years
in
the
united
states
gasoline
pump
prices
nationwide
have
risen
to
near
a
gallon
during
the
peak
summer
travel
season
still
less
than
the
a
gallon
during
the
great
recession
gasoline
demand
has
remained
strong
rising
to
an
estimated
million
bpd
as
of
last
week
according
to
energy
department
data
trump
sent
his
tweet
hours
after
returning
to
washington
from
a
summit
with
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
in
singapore
separately
a
bipartisan
group
of
lawmakers
in
the
house
of
representatives
was
pushing
legislation
that
would
subject
opec
to
antitrust
law
and
fight
what
the
group
called
artificial
production
controls
the
measure
would
have
to
pass
the
full
house
and
the
senate
before
trump
could
sign
it
into
law
past
presidents
have
not
supported
similar
bills
when
they
have
been
proposed
