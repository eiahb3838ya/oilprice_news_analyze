the

the
time
binh
son
had
said
it
would
sell
a
further
percent
stake
to
strategic
investors
including
domestic
and
foreign
investors
but
the
refinery
operator
has
so
far
failed
to
find
a
strategic
investor
ceo
nguyen
said
the
timing
is
too
short
for
strategic
investors
to
decide
to
invest
in
such
a
big
stake
he
added
bsr
also
hopes
to
ease
requirements
such
as
time
and
minimum
registered
capital
for
the
planned
sale
nguyen
said
adding
he
expected
the
government
to
approve
the
change
in
order
to
help
speed
up
the
process
vietnam
has
been
privatising
hundreds
of
enterprises
in
order
to
boost
their
performance
relax
a
tight
state
budget
and
reform
an
economy
that
is
highly
reliant
on
foreign
investments
binh
son
s
foreign
ownership
is
capped
at
percent
it
is
currently
percent
owned
by
foreigners
indicating
overseas
buyers
may
take
up
to

in
the
upcoming
sale
shares
of
the
company
have
been
trading
on
the
unlisted

or

to
be
listed
on
the

next
year
binh
son
expects
to
rake
in
a
net
profit
of
trillion
dong
million
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
or
about
percent
of
its
target
it
said
in
a
statement
the
company
will
use
retained
profits
as
well
as
loans
to
fund
a
planned
upgrade
of
its
dung
quat
refinery
dung
quat
vietnam
s
first
refinery
that
began
operations
in
was
initially
designed
to
process
light
sweet
crude
oil
mostly
sourced
from
the
bach
ho
field
offshore
vietnam
the
upgrade
will
enable
the
plant
to
process
sour
crude
oil
as
well
nguyen
said
and
will
also
allow
it
to
produce
more
petrochemical
products
binh

will
select
an
engineering
procurement
and
construction
contractor
for
the
upgrade
next
year
nguyen
said
seven
companies
had
registered
to
bid
for
the
