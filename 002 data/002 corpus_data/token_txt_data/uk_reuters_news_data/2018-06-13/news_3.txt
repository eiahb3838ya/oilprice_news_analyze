new
york
reuters
lawyers
for
major
oil
companies
on
wednesday
urged
a
federal
judge
to
throw
out
a
lawsuit
filed
by
new
york
city
seeking
to
hold
them
financially
liable
for
damages
caused
by
global
warming
theodore
boutrous
a
lawyer
for
chevron
corp
said
at
a
hearing
before
district
judge
john
keenan
in
manhattan
that
the
lawsuit
filed
in
january
was
an
attempt
to
hold
the
oil
companies
liable
for
carbon
emissions
all
over
the
world
since
the
industrial
revolution
they
re
basically
asking
the
court
to
recognise
a
tort
that
would
hold
the
oil
companies
responsible
for
the
way
civilization
and
humankind
have
developed
over
the
ages
boutrous
said
the
city
sued
chevron
bp
plc
conocophillips
exxon
mobil
corp
and
royal
dutch
shell
plc
in
january
announcing
at
the
same
time
that
it
intended
to
divest
fossil
fuel
investments
from
its
billion
billion
public
pension
funds
over
the
next
five
years
the
city
said
the
companies
knew
for
years
that
carbon
emissions
caused
global
warming
yet
they
promoted
fossil
fuels
while
pushing
public
relations
efforts
to
discredit
science
on
the
risks
of
climate
change
the
city
said
it
must
spend
billions
of
dollars
to
safeguard
against
flooding
and
other
hazards
of
global
warming
and
is
seeking
money
damages
boutrous
argued
at
the
hearing
that
the
city
was
wrong
to
bring
claims
under
state
law
because
federal
law
governs
carbon
emissions
he
also
argued
that
a
court
would
be
unable
to
decide
the
complicated
political
considerations
that
go
into
addressing
global
warming
global
warming
is
a
very
important
issue
it
s
a
thorny
problem
boutros
said
lawsuits
are
not
the
way
to
deal
with
matthew
pawa
a
lawyer
for
the
city
said
the
oil
companies
had
contributed
to
a
public
nuisance
under
state
law
defined
as
an
unreasonable
interference
with
rights
common
to
the
he
denied
that
the
lawsuit
sought
to
hold
the
companies
liable
for
emissions
going
back
centuries
saying
the
city
only
claimed
they
became
liable
once
they
knew
of
fossil
fuels
risks
the
liability
would
go
back
as
far
as
the
intentionality
goes
he
said
keenan
asked
both
sides
lawyers
whether
the
city
could
hold
the
oil
companies
liable
given
that
it
used
fossil
fuels
itself
boutrous
agreed
that
could
be
an
issue
while
pawa
said
it
was
not
grounds
for
dismissing
the
case
the
judge
did
not
make
a
decision
at
the
hearing
