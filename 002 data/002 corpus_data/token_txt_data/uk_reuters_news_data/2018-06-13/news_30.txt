sanctions
on
iran
and
the
continued
decline
in
output
from
venezuela
will
leave
the
oil
market
very
vulnerable
to
any
further
production
or
consumption
surprises
next
year
output
and
demand
in
the
global
market
are
each
currently
running
at
almost
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
ensure
a
steady
flow
of
oil
from
the
wellhead
to
consumers
the
industry
relies
on
a
series
of
shock
absorbers
to
handle
any
interruption
in
supplies
or
unexpected
strength
in
demand
in
rough
order
of
responsiveness
these
buffers
are
commercial
inventories
opec
spare
capacity
strategic
stocks
production
consumption
restraint
both
commercial
inventories
and
opec
spare
capacity
have
become
dangerously
eroded
over
the
last
months
leaving
the
oil
market
much
more
vulnerable
in
if
all
the
other
shock
absorbers
become
exhausted
oil
prices
will
have
to
rise
to
the
point
where
consumption
growth
begins
to
slow
the
oil
market
s
first
line
of
defence
comes
from
changes
in
the
volume
of
commercial
inventories
held
by
producers
traders
and
refiners
oecd
commercial
stocks
currently
stand
at
billion
barrels
composed
of
crude
billion
barrels
other
liquids
million
barrels
and
refined
products
billion
barrels
additional
stocks
are
held
in
countries
as
well
as
on
tankers
and
in
pipelines
either
in
transit
from
oilfields
to
refineries
and
on
to
final
customers
or
as
floating
storage
the
vast
majority
of
stocks
are
held
for
operational
reasons
to
ensure
the
uninterrupted
flow
of
oil
from
wellhead
to
final
customers
only
a
small
percentage
generally
less
than
percent
can
be
considered
discretionary
and
available
to
act
as
a
shock
absorber
oecd
crude
and
product
stocks
are
already
million
barrels
below
the
average
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
oil
market
report
iea
june
the
average
was
inflated
by
the
glut
of
oil
between
and
so
it
may
not
be
representative
of
the
normal
level
of
inventories
but
global
oil
consumption
has
also
increased
by
more
than
million
bpd
over
the
five
years
since
so
other
things
being
equal
producers
traders
and
refiners
will
want
to
hold
more
stocks
for
operational
reasons
the
fact
that
futures
prices
for
both
brent
and
wti
are
in
backwardation
implies
oil
traders
see
stocks
as
already
fairly
tight
and
expected
to
tighten
further
for
the
last
four
decades
the
oil
industry
s
second
line
of
defence
has
been
the
existence
of
significant
volumes
of
spare
production
capacity
nearly
all
spare
production
capacity
is
held
by
saudi
arabia
with
smaller
volumes
held
by
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
russia
may
also
hold
a
small
amount
of
spare
capacity
at
the
moment
following
the
decision
taken
in
to
restrain
production
other
opec
and
members
essentially
produce
as
much
as
they
are
able
and
do
not
hold
significant
spare
capacity
opec
s
spare
capacity
currently
amounts
to
less
than
million
bpd
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
energy
outlook
eia
june
in
its
latest
oil
market
update
the
international
energy
agency
explored
a
scenario
in
which
exports
from
venezuela
and
iran
could
decline
by
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
to
compensate
for
the
lost
output
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
could
boost
production
by
just
over
million
bpd
with
additional
supplies
from
russia
according
to
the
iea
but
if
this
scenario
comes
to
pass
opec
spare
capacity
will
be
reduced
to
less
than
million
bpd
the
lowest
level
since
production
with
oil
inventories
already
tight
and
spare
capacity
set
to
shrink
the
industry
will
have
to
fall
back
on
strategic
stocks
and
production
to
meet
any
unexpected
shortfall
oecd
governments
and
refiners
hold
almost
billion
barrels
of
crude
and
products
in
strategic
storage
which
can
be
released
in
the
event
of
an
emergency
china
has
also
amassed
a
strategic
stockpile
estimated
at
more
than
million
barrels
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
strategic
stocks
are
the
third
line
of
defence
but
the
circumstances
under
which
oecd
and
china
s
strategic
stocks
would
be
released
to
the
market
remain
opaque
experience
suggests
governments
react
to
the
security
and
economic
threat
from
both
actual
shortages
of
crude
a
sharp
rise
in
prices
however
strategic
stock
releases
can
not
be
predicted
and
strategic
stocks
are
not
generally
considered
available
to
the
market
the
industry
will
therefore
be
forced
to
rely
on
production
its
fourth
line
of
defence
most
production
comes
from
the
shale
sector
with
smaller
volumes
available
from
the
accelerated
development
of
existing
oilfields
in
other
parts
of
the
world
but
even
production
can
take
months
or
more
to
reach
the
market
given
the
lengthy
delays
involved
in
securing
extra
drilling
rigs
fracking
wells
and
connecting
them
up
to
the
distribution
system
the
shale
supply
chain
is
already
extremely
stretched
with
reported
shortages
of
experienced
fracking
crews
and
truckers
and
pipelines
to
move
the
produced
oil
from
the
shale
fields
to
refining
centres
on
the
gulf
coast
or
onto
tankers
for
export
are
full
producers
may
therefore
struggle
to
plug
any
additional
shortfall
in
oil
supplies
next
year
especially
if
consumption
growth
remains
strong
and
production
from
new
oilfields
takes
too
long
to
develop
to
be
of
any
real
use
as
a
shock
absorber
so
the
final
shock
absorber
is
always
the
consumer
oil
prices
will
have
to
rise
high
enough
in
to
slow
growth
in
consumption
and
restore
inventory
and
spare
capacity
buffers
to
a
more
comfortable
level
rising
prices
will
slow
consumption
growth
through
some
combination
of
behavioural
changes
to
cut
fuel
use
switching
to
alternative
fuels
and
slower
gdp
growth
in
consuming
countries
consumption
is
not
very
responsive
to
a
small
change
in
oil
prices
at
least
in
the
short
term
so
large
price
increases
are
required
to
enforce
demand
restraint
between
and
and
again
between
and
high
oil
prices
coincided
with
falling
consumption
in
the
oecd
in
both
cases
the
rise
in
prices
was
followed
by
a
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
and
a
faster
increase
in
production
eventually
rebuilding
stocks
and
spare
capacity
the
combination
of
falling
venezuelan
output
sanctions
on
iran
low
commercial
stocks
low
spare
capacity
and
constraints
on
the
expansion
of
shale
is
priming
the
market
for
higher
prices
in
the
most
likely
outcome
is
a
further
rise
in
prices
to
enforce
demand
restraint
a
recession
in
the
major
consuming
countries
to
bring
the
market
back
to
balance
again
