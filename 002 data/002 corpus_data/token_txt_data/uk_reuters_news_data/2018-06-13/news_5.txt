wrapup 3-gasoline leads broad increase in u.s. producer inflation
washington
reuters
producer
prices
increased
more
than
expected
in
may
leading
to
the
biggest
annual
gain
in
nearly
years
the
latest
sign
of
a
gradual
building
up
of
inflation
pressures
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
for
a
second
time
this
year
on
wednesday
and
forecast
two
more
rate
hikes
the
central
bank
noted
that
overall
and
underlying
inflation
measures
had
moved
closer
to
its
percent
goal
the
fed
is
on
the
right
course
with
its
gradual
pace
of
rate
hikes
because
the
inflation
heat
may
yet
lead
to
fire
and
the
risk
that
monetary
policy
has
to
move
faster
and
put
the
long
economic
recovery
in
jeopardy
said
chris
rupkey
chief
economist
at
mufg
in
new
york
the
producer
price
index
for
final
demand
rose
percent
last
month
boosted
by
a
surge
in
gasoline
prices
and
continued
gains
in
the
cost
of
services
the
labor
department
said
the
ppi
edged
up
percent
in
april
in
the
months
through
may
the
ppi
increased
percent
the
largest
advance
since
january
producer
prices
rose
percent
in
april
economists
had
forecast
the
ppi
gaining
percent
from
the
prior
month
and
rising
percent
from
a
year
ago
a
key
gauge
of
underlying
producer
price
pressures
that
excludes
food
energy
and
trade
services
nudged
up
percent
last
month
the
core
ppi
rose
by
the
same
margin
in
april
in
the
months
through
may
the
core
ppi
rose
percent
after
advancing
percent
in
april
the
renewed
upward
trend
in
producer
prices
strengthens
expectations
that
inflation
will
pick
up
this
year
the
fed
s
preferred
inflation
measure
the
personal
consumption
expenditures
pce
price
index
excluding
food
and
energy
increased
percent
in
april
after
a
similar
gain
in
march
new
projections
from
fed
officials
on
wednesday
indicated
that
the
core
pce
price
index
would
slightly
run
above
the
percent
target
the
dollar
reversed
losses
against
a
basket
of
currencies
following
the
fed
s
rate
decision
while
prices
for
treasuries
fell
stocks
on
wall
street
fell
marginally
regional
factory
surveys
have
shown
an
acceleration
in
raw
material
prices
this
year
so
far
manufacturers
have
not
passed
on
these
higher
costs
to
consumers
a
worsening
worker
shortage
is
expected
to
push
up
wages
this
together
with
expensive
raw
materials
will
likely
squeeze
profit
margins
and
probably
force
businesses
to
raise
prices
a
report
on
tuesday
showed
monthly
consumer
prices
rising
moderately
in
may
in
may
prices
for
goods
surged
percent
accounting
for
percent
of
the
rise
in
the
ppi
goods
prices
were
unchanged
in
april
in
may
they
were
boosted
by
a
percent
jump
in
the
price
of
gasoline
wholesale
gasoline
prices
slipped
percent
in
april
prices
for
steel
mill
products
surged
percent
in
may
the
largest
rise
since
february
likely
reflecting
steel
and
aluminium
import
tariffs
imposed
in
march
by
the
trump
administration
the
cost
of
these
products
could
rise
further
after
the
government
this
month
widened
the
duties
to
imports
from
the
european
union
canada
and
mexico
the
inflation
impact
of
the
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
though
likely
moderate
will
be
more
visible
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
said
ryan
sweet
a
senior
economist
at
moody
s
analytics
in
west
chester
pennsylvania
wholesale
food
prices
edged
up
percent
last
month
after
declining
percent
in
april
excluding
food
and
energy
goods
prices
increased
percent
rising
by
the
same
margin
for
a
third
straight
month
the
cost
of
services
increased
percent
after
nudging
up
percent
in
april
services
were
driven
by
a
percent
rise
in
margins
for
trade
services
the
cost
of
healthcare
services
ticked
up
percent
after
falling
percent
in
april
those
costs
feed
into
the
core
pce
price
index
economists
said
factoring
in
the
ppi
and
cpi
data
they
expected
the
monthly
core
pce
price
index
rose
percent
in
may
which
would
push
the
annual
increase
to
percent
medical
care
pricing
looked
weak
in
may
but
we
see
firmness
in
other
inputs
related
to
used
vehicle
prices
airfares
and
prices
for
various
financial
services
said
daniel
