iran, other dissenters complicate opec oil output boost -sources
reuters
at
least
three
opec
members
disagree
with
saudi
arabia
and
russia
on
the
need
to
pump
more
oil
opec
sources
said
complicating
any
official
decision
to
boost
supply
just
as
consuming
nations
are
warning
of
a
shortage
in
attempt
to
bridge
differences
opec
and
its
allies
are
looking
at
a
number
of
options
around
pumping
more
oil
including
a
token
increase
and
delaying
the
start
of
any
production
boost
opec
delegates
say
after
almost
months
of
an
opec
and
deal
to
cut
production
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
said
they
are
prepared
to
pump
more
to
calm
consumer
worries
about
supply
and
prices
which
hit
a
barrel
the
highest
since
but
iran
the
of
saudi
arabia
plus
venezuela
iraq
and
smaller
producers
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
disagree
producers
meet
on
june
to
set
policy
the
disagreement
has
revived
memories
of
a
meeting
that
former
saudi
oil
minister
ali
called
one
of
the
group
s
worst
ever
talks
collapsed
when
a
majority
of
members
refused
to
endorse
a
saudi
push
to
pump
more
saudi
arabia
in
the
end
unilaterally
raised
output
those
against
an
increase
this
time
are
concerned
it
would
threaten
the
unity
of
the
alliance
involved
in
the
deal
and
say
forecasts
from
opec
and
others
calling
for
higher
demand
in
the
second
half
of
are
too
optimistic
changing
the
decision
is
very
complicated
an
opec
source
said
iran
iraq
and
venezuela
and
some
more
countries
are
going
to
push
for
keeping
the
ceiling
for
opec
in
place
until
the
end
of
the
source
did
not
say
which
other
countries
oppose
pumping
more
another
source
thought
a
supply
boost
will
be
agreed
eventually
but
a
modest
one
i
believe
there
will
be
a
marginal
increase
a
second
opec
source
said
adding
it
would
have
to
be
gradual
well
calculated
and
for
its
impact
on
the
market
to
be
consumers
say
more
oil
is
needed
president
donald
trump
renewed
his
attack
on
opec
on
wednesday
and
the
international
energy
agency
said
the
world
may
face
a
supply
gap
by
late
if
opec
can
not
cover
any
shortfalls
russian
president
vladimir
putin
plans
to
meet
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
when
he
visits
russia
for
the
opening
of
the
soccer
world
cup
and
the
two
would
discuss
the
oil
deal
the
kremlin
said
on
wednesday
venezuela
s
output
has
collapsed
due
to
economic
crisis
and
could
fall
further
due
to
sanctions
while
iran
is
facing
a
cut
in
exports
after
the
quit
a
nuclear
deal
with
tehran
those
who
oppose
the
increase
are
the
ones
who
will
not
gain
a
second
opec
source
said
they
will
lose
when
prices
go
down
because
they
will
not
be
able
to
increase
production
and
will
get
less
gulf
producers
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
are
the
main
opec
members
holding
sufficient
unused
oil
production
capacity
to
boost
output
quickly
to
offset
a
shortage
sources
close
to
the
matter
said
a
number
of
options
are
being
looked
at
including
an
increase
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
and
should
prices
fall
making
no
decision
arab
oil
ministers
who
met
in
kuwait
earlier
this
month
agreed
that
if
there
is
a
decline
in
prices
toward
the
then
opec
would
keep
the
deal
in
place
until
its
next
meeting
in
november
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
another
scenario
being
discussed
is
for
producers
to
ease
the
level
of
cutbacks
to
percent
of
the
agreed
level
from
around
percent
now
to
fill
any
supply
gap
from
venezuela
and
iran
should
oil
get
close
to
the
sources
said
in
a
further
effort
toward
building
consensus
the
amount
of
any
increase
would
be
distributed
among
all
even
though
only
three
or
four
producers
actually
have
the
capacity
to
increase
output
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
and
a
fifth
opec
source
said
that
if
opec
decided
next
week
to
raise
output
it
would
not
be
with
immediate
effect
and
would
be
gradual
suggesting
supply
would
not
rise
for
three
to
four
months
after
a
june
decision
