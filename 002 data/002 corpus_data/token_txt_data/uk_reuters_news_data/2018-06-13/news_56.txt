have
coursed

a

strong

coal

have
not
just
been
pushed

given
the

last

japanese

a

at

said
power

were
also
stocking
up
their

ahead
of

in

as

switches

powerhouses
the

and
economies
china

japan
respectively
rely
heavily
on

as
does
south

the
current

is
almost
unbearable
for

said
a
senior

with

operator
china
huaneng
group
declining
to
be
named
because
he
wasn
t
authorised
to
speak
to
media
he
added
however
that
strong
industrial
demand
for
electricity
was
in
turn
generating
healthy
revenue
and
that
cheaper
coal
supply
contracts
under
government
price
controls
were
shielding
the
company
from
some
of
the
high
import
costs
the
bull
run
in
fuel
demand
and
prices
is
a
boon
for

fended
off
a
billion
takeover
bid
by
an
investor
group
that
was
keen
to
get
a
share
in
the
booming
market
coal
and
gas
usually
take
their
lead
from
oil
markets
yet
that
s
not
been
the
case
recently
although
oil
prices
have
also
risen
this
year
in
part
due
to
healthy
demand
but
mostly
because
of
voluntary
production
cuts
led
by
producer
cartel
opec
but
crude
markets
have
more
recently
come
under
pressure
following
rising
