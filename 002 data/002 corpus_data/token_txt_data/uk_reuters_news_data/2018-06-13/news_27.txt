coal comeback spurs new carbon emissions growth, says bp
london

global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
began
rising
again
last
year
as
the
first
in
coal
burning
since
overshadowed
a
record
expansion
in
renewable
energy
a
bp
report
said
energy
demand
accelerated
in
by
percent
but
a
percent
gain
in
clean
power
such
as
solar
and
wind
did
little
to
offset
the
dominance
of
fossil
fuels
in
the
rapidly
expanding
global
economy
demand
for
hydrocarbons
rose
across
the
board
led
by
a
percent
increase
in
natural
gas
consumption
the
fastest
since
followed
by
a
percent
rise
in
oil
demand
which
far
exceeded
the
average
of
the
previous
years

higher
by

highlighting
the
difficulties
developing
economies
face
in
meeting
demand
for
electricity
while
fighting

bp
and
other
oil
companies
such
as
royal
dutch
shell
have
led
calls
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
by
converting
coal
power
plants
to
cleaner
natural
gas
still
the
share
of
coal
in
power
generation
today
remains
around
percent
practically
unchanged
since
while
the
share
of
fuels
slightly
dipped
as
nuclear
power
capacity
shrunk
bp
chief
economist
spencer
dale
said
the
power
sector
absorbs
more
than
percent
of
primary
energy
and
accounts
for
over
a
third
of
carbon
emissions
this
is
really
worrying
dale
told
reporters
in
a
briefing
before
the
report
was
released
how
much
progress
have
we
made
in
years
graphic
fuel
shares
in
power
carbon
emissions
grew
last
year
by
percent
compared
with
little
to
no
growth
in
the
previous
three
years
but
still
lower
than
average
growth
of
percent
in
the
years
to
a
landmark
climate
agreement
reached
in
paris
in
calls
for
halving
carbon
emissions
by
and
reducing
them
to
net
zero
by
the
end
of
the
century
to
limit
global
warming
three
years
of
flat
growth
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
it
wasn
t
a
big
enough
step
dale
said
steady
and
robust
growth
in
oil
demand
over
the
past
five
years
the
strongest
since
was
driven
by
lower
crude
prices
but
could
be
undercut
by
the
recent
rally
that
took
prices
to
their
highest
since
dale
said
there
are
some
signs
that
the
boost
from
low
oil
prices
may
be
beginning
to
wane
he
added

side
the
surge
in
production
of
shale
oil
also
known
has
tight
oil
has
redrawn
the
global
market
the
united
states
overtook
saudi
arabia
in
to
become
the
world
s
second
biggest
producer
behind
russia
a
agreement
between
opec
russia
and
other
major
oil
producers
to
reduce
global
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
combined
with
a
sharp
fall
in
venezuela
s
output
drove
down
global
inventories
to
their
average
bp
said
but
a
million
bpd
growth
in
oil
and
natural
gas
liquids
since
october
offset
a
large
part
of
the
cuts
opec
has
always
had
the
power
to
stabilise
the
market
in
response
to
fluctuations
dale
said
opec
has
never
had
the
power
to
try
to
offset
structural
shocks
to
the
market
such
as
the
emergence
of
new
sources
of
supply
and
the
growth
of
electric
the
rapid
response
of
tight
oil
just
reinforces
that
rising
exports
of
crude
and
new
refineries
in
asia
and
the
middle
east
have
also
led
to
a
surge
in
global
oil
trading
which
grew
by
more
than
percent
last
year
compared
to
a
average
