much
control
of
company
as
a
result
of
the
sale

state
s
stake
fell
to
percent
the
government
said
it
wanted
to
capitalize
on
the

recent
strong
performance
while
still
holding
a
strong
grip
on
the
company
the
state
will
continue
to
be
a
significant
shareholder
of

which

to
a
minimum

subject

the
logic
of
the
sale
is
rather
confusing
there
is
really
no
need
to
sell
the

lose
common
ownership
they
could
instead
borrow
cheap
money
