that

inventories
rose
by
barrels
in

to
million
the
rising
stocks
are
in
part
a
result
of
the
surge
in

has
jumped
by
percent
in
the
last
two
years
to
a
record
million
barrels

million
bpd
in

jumping
back
above
million
bpd
supplies
from
the
top
three
producers
are
rising
with
rising
production
from
shale
adding
to
oil
s
woes
and
reviving
oversupply
concerns
further
downside
could
be
a
possibility
in
the
short
to
medium
term
otunuga
said
official
production
and
inventory
data
is
due
