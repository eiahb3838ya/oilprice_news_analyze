world
stocks
retreated
on
wednesday
from
highs
with
investor
focus
turning
from
the
korea
summit
to
an
expected
interest
rate
rise
and
the
risk
of
a
fresh
outbreak
of
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the
united
states
global
tech
stocks
approached
record
highs
and
italian

fell
although
markets
remain
under
pressure
from
plans
for
extra

on

the

and

also

slipped
further
equity
markets
are
marking
time
and
finding
it
difficult
to
make
upward
progress
despite
reasonably
good
economic
data
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
we
are
entering
three
days
of
important
central
bank
decisions
markets
have
pretty
much
priced
what
the
banks
will
do
and
it
is
clear
we
are
in
a
monetary
policy
tightening
cycle
milligan
said
the
federal
reserve
is
expected
to
announce
a
rate
increase
this
year
s
second
the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
japan
also
meet
this
week
tuesday
s
meeting
between
president
donald
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
has
soothed
some
fears
as
a
joint
statement
pledged
to
work
toward
the
denuclearization
of
the
korean
peninsula
that
alongside
a
buoyant
picture
on
company
earnings
and
m
a
deals
helped
wall
street
close
on
a
strong
note
on
tuesday
with
tech
stocks
hitting
record
highs
but
trade
frictions
between
the
united
states
and
china
pushed
asian
equities
half
a
percent
lower
and
took
msci

percent
lower
european
equities
opened
flat
to
lower
an
index
of
auto
stocks
also
at
risk
of
additional
tariffs
fell
percent
milligan
downplayed
the
impact
of
trade
measures
on
global
commerce
volumes
but
noted
the
direction
of
travel
is
not
positive
which
is
why
equities
are
not
making
as
much
progress
and
investor
sentiment
is
not
more
in
a
reminder
of
the
danger
of
trade
disputes
shares
in
chinese
telecommunications
giant
zte
corp
fell
as
much
as
percent
wiping
billion
off
its
market
value
as
it
resumed
trade
after
agreeing
to
pay
up
to
billion
in
penalties
to
the
government
its
shenzhen

fell
by
their

limit
dragging
down
mainland
chinese

around

the
mexican
peso
and
the
canadian
dollar
caught
up
in
trade
war
risks
slipped
further
with
the
former
at
a
low
against
the
dollar
as
the
fed
meeting
approached
the
dollar
inched
up
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
and
was
close
to
a
high
versus
the
yen
projections
from
the
fed
s
march
meeting
suggest
a
benchmark
rate
of
percent
at
end
of
that
implies
a
total
of
three
rate
rises
this
year
but
some
reckon
four
increases
are
possible
the
focus
is
on
how
many
times
the
fed
will
raise
rates
this
year
and
next
and
how
much
beyond
the
levels
it
considers
as
neutral
to
the
economy
or
what
they
call
the
rates
said
shuji
shirota
head
of
macro
economic
strategy
group
at
hsbc
securities
in
tokyo
the
euro
eased
off
last
week
s
high
of
but
remained
underpinned
by
expectations
the
ecb
will
mention
plans
to
wind
up
its
stimulus
and
even
hint
at
the
timing
of
its
first
interest
rate
rise
when
it
meets
on
thursday
however
italian
bond
yields
continued
to
fall

yields
down

to
below

after
eu
affairs
minister
paolo
savona
considered
a
eurosceptic
said
the
euro
was
indispensable
these
comments
soothed
worries
about
italy
s
euro
membership
but
analysts
say
the
government
s
plans
could
boost
yields
again
once
the
relief
rally
ebbs
in
the
longer
term
they
need
to
do
something
different
to
bring
the
deficit
under
control
not
just
pay
lip
service
towards
the
euro
commerzbank
strategist
christoph
rieger
said
britain
s
pound
and
bond
yields
slipped
as
data
showing
subdued
inflation
tempered
expectations
for
an
interest
rate
rise
this
year
brent
