a
wave
of
shutdowns
will
hit
indian
refineries
next
year
as
the
country
prepares
for
cleaner
fuels
from
april
company
officials
said
in
moves
that
could
temporarily
dent
oil
demand
and
push
up
imports
of
refined
fuels
india
the
world
s
oil
importer
and
consumer
has
surplus
refining
capacity
and
rarely
imports
gasoil
and
gasoline
it
also
means
that
demand
for
fuel
produced
by
india
s
privately
owned
refiners
will
likely
climb
during
the
period
as
state
refiners
seek
to
fill
the
gap
state
refiners
indian
oil
corp
bharat
petroleum
hindustan
petroleum
and
mangalore
refinery
and
petrochemicals
account
for
about
percent
of
the
country
s
nearly
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
capacity
the
refiners
will
have
to
shut
and
units
at
their
plants
for
to
days
to
churn
out
euro
fuels
from
january
to
be
able
to
sell
them
from
april
of
that
year
next
year
will
be
challenging
for
us
as
i
have
to
protect
my
crude
throughput
and
finish
the
job
at
the
refineries
and
get
ready
for
euro
vi
by
april
said
rama
gopal
head
of
refineries
at
ioc
the
country
s
top
refiner
ioc
plans
a
roughly
shutdown
of
and
units
at
all
of
its
refineries
he
told
reuters
key
parts
of
the
refineries
requiring
a
revamp
include
naphtha
hydrotreaters
catalytic
reforming
units
isomerisation
units
diesel
sulphurisers
and
diesel
hydrotreaters
in
addition
some
refiners
have
to
revamp
or
set
up
new
gasoline
treaters
hydrogen
production
and
sulphur
recovery
units
india
has
been
gradually
reducing
sulphur
emissions
from
vehicles
since
when
fuel
sold
in
the
country
had
parts
per
million
ppm
motorists
in
delhi
which
faces
major
air
pollution
moved
in
april
this
year
to
standards
which
allow
up
to
ppm
sulphur
and
are
known
locally
as
bharat
hpcl
will
shut
its
diesel
and
gasoline
units
while
upgrading
the
crude
units
at
its
vizag
and
mumbai
refineries
for
to
days
its
chairman
surana
said
he
forecast
a
slight
reduction
in
the
company
s
crude
intake
we
will
take
the
shutdown
in
one
shot
so
we
don
t
have
multiple
disruptions
surana
said
surana
and
mrpl
managing
director
venkatesh
who
intends
to
shut
some
refinery
units
for
up
to
a
month
said
they
see
no
need
to
import
fuel
in
given
that
state
fuel
retailers
can
access
robust
production
at
local
private
refiners
their
view
is
challenged
by
analysts
who
estimate
weaker
gasoil
and
gasoline
prices
would
prompt
state
refiners
to
import
auto
fuel
instead
of
going
to
private
peers
who
levy
coastal
freight
charges
on
top
of
normal
prices
a
similar
phenomenon
was
witnessed
when
india
migrated
to
euro
iv
fuel
in
phases
to
april
said
sri
paravaikkarasu
head
of
east
of
suez
oil
for
consultants
fge
in
singapore
there
is
a
high
possibility
that
the
lengthy
shutdown
period
could
result
in
a
shortage
of
current
euro
iv
products
in
the
domestic
market
in
such
an
event
indian
nocs
national
oil
companies
should
turn
to
the
international
market
for
product
purchases
she
said
fge
expects
india
could
import
bpd
of
gasoline
and
bpd
of
gasoil
for
about
one
quarter
in
because
of
the
shutdowns
bpcl
india
s
state
refiner
has
upgraded
two
of
its
refineries
to
fuels
and
is
revamping
the
hydrocracker
at
its
mumbai
refinery
so
it
can
produce
cleaner
diesel
its
head
of
refineries
ramachandran
said
bpcl
plans
to
shut
a
crude
unit
and
some
other
secondary
units
at
the
mumbai
refinery
for
maintenance
and
upgrades
next
year
for
days
to
produce
cleaner
fuels
ramachandran
said
there
could
be
a
need
to
import
some
additional
cargoes
but
it
will
not
be
a
major
hiccup
the
shutdowns
will
be
spaced
out
in
a
manner
to
ensure
there
is
enough
product
in
the
market
it
will
be
a
exercise
