update 3-edf restructuring expected as france reduces reliance on nuclear
paris
reuters
france
is
considering
restructuring
utility
edf
and
plans
a
steady
reduction
to
the
country
s
reliance
on
nuclear
power
the
government
said
on
tuesday
in
a
speech
on
energy
strategy
president
emmanuel
macron
said
france
would
reduce
the
share
of
nuclear
in
the
power
mix
to
percent
by
down
from
percent
today
rather
than
the
total
phasing
out
planned
by
neighbour
germany
the
fate
of
edf
long
a
symbol
of
french
industrial
might
and
a
world
leader
in
nuclear
technology
is
a
politically
sensitive
issue
in
france
it
has
already
led
to
the
resignation
of
macron
s
former
ecology
minister
nicolas
hulot
who
accused
the
president
of
dragging
his
feet
on
nuclear
power
i
was
not
elected
on
a
promise
to
exit
nuclear
power
but
to
reduce
the
share
of
nuclear
in
our
energy
mix
to
percent
macron
said
in
an
address
adding
that
of
edf
s
nuclear
reactors
would
be
closed
by
edf
shares
fell
up
to
percent
on
news
of
the
plans
which
a
source
close
to
the
president
s
office
said
could
involve
the
state
increasing
its
stake
in
the
company
by
gmt
the
shares
were
down
percent
macron
s
action
plan
is
broadly
in
line
with
edf
s
desire
not
to
close
any
reactors
before
besides
the
previously
scheduled
closure
of
fessenheim
s
two
reactors
near
the
german
border
no
further
closures
are
planned
before
the
end
of
macron
s
term
in
another
two
will
be
shut
down
over
and
a
further
two
could
face
closure
as
early
as
if
there
is
no
risk
of
jeopardising
france
s
power
supply
in
his
election
campaign
macron
promised
to
stick
to
the
former
socialist
government
s
target
of
reducing
the
share
of
nuclear
to
percent
by
but
he
rowed
back
on
the
pledge
a
few
months
after
taking
office
angering
environmentalists
as
france
reduces
its
dependence
on
nuclear
energy
edf
is
wooing
overseas
markets
with
the
epr
model
of
reactor
it
is
building
at
hinkley
point
britain
s
first
new
plant
in
decades
macron
said
the
schedule
for
shutting
down
reactors
would
depend
on
the
evolution
of
france
s
energy
mix
including
the
planned
increase
of
renewable
energy
and
the
expansion
of
interconnection
capacity
with
neighbouring
countries
it
is
a
pragmatic
approach
which
takes
into
account
security
of
supply
he
said
an
elysee
note
on
the
strategy
said
the
closures
would
focus
on
the
oldest
reactors
including
at
the
tricastin
bugey
gravelines
and
chinon
plants
it
also
said
that
to
limit
job
losses
no
sites
would
be
closed
completely
macron
did
not
mention
a
possible
edf
restructuring
but
the
elysee
note
said
the
state
could
raise
its
percent
stake
the
state
will
consider
boosting
its
stake
in
the
capital
of
the
company
in
line
with
the
challenges
and
risks
linked
to
the
nuclear
activity
the
note
said
ecology
minister
francois
de
rugy
told
a
news
conference
that
edf
s
structure
was
not
necessarily
the
most
efficient
in
the
long
run
we
want
edf
to
remain
an
integrated
group
there
could
be
a
parent
company
and
subsidiaries
he
said
financial
markets
have
long
speculated
that
edf
s
nuclear
activities
could
be
put
into
a
separate
legal
structure
and
renationalised
which
would
allow
the
state
to
subsidise
the
business
and
make
nuclear
energy
available
to
edf
as
well
as
its
competitors
several
of
edf
s
major
business
activities
are
already
operating
as
separate
legal
units
such
as
power
grid
operators
rte
and
enedis
as
well
as
its
renewable
energy
division
greenpeace
said
that
macron
had
fallen
prey
to
corporate
interests
for
the
umpteenth
time
the
government
has
caved
in
to
the
nuclear
industry
lobby
said
alix
mazounie
head
of
greenpeace
france
s
nuclear
campaign
