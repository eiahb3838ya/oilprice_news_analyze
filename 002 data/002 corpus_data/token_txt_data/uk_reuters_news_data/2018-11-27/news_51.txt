activists
climbed
a
feet
chimney
at
a
power
station
in
belchatow
central
poland
on
tuesday
to
protest
warsaw
s
coal
policies
ahead
of
climate
talks
this
month
the
plant
is
poland
s
biggest
power
producer
europe
s
largest
polluter
and
one
of
the
biggest
coal
power
plants
in
the
world
nine
activists
climbed
an
internal
ladder
to
the
top
of
the
conical
chimney
at
the
plant
which
is
fueled
by
lignite
and
belongs
to
pge
activists
say
poland
s
dependence
on
coal
and
the
disputes
between
the
conservative
nationalist
government
and
the
european
union
could
make
the
climate
talks
difficult
i
am
from
a
mining
family
we
have
been
connected
to
coal
mining
for
generations
there
is
no
future
in
coal
what
we
need
is
a
just
transition
from
coal
and
fossil
fuels
to
renewables

jozefiak
an
activist
climbing
the
chimney
said
last
week
the
energy
ministry
said
in
a
draft
document
that
by
percent
of
power
will
come
from
coal
and
existing
onshore
wind
farms
will
disappear
poland
also
plans
to
replace
some
coal
with
nuclear
power
plant
photovoltaics
and
offshore
wind
farms
by
the
draft
ignores
the
threats
and
challenges
resulting
from
the
climate
crises
and
proves
that
the
energy
minister
completely
does
not
understand
the
changes
which
take
place
in
the
world
