trump
said
it
was
highly

he
would

china
s
request
to
hold
off

harsh
report
from
the

investors
have
only
the
flimsiest
hope
that
the
meeting
in
argentina
will
amount
to
more
than
a
hill

to

s
comments

trump
s
remarks
came
just
as
the
mood
among
investors
had
shown
signs
of
brightening
and
wall
street
took
heart
from
an
upbeat
holiday
shopping
period
even
oil
managed
to
regain
a
little
ground
after
the
slide
of
recent
weeks
the
dow
ended
monday
up
percent
while
the
s
p
gained
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
rally
came
after
the

recorded
its
lowest
close
in
six
months
down
more
than
percent
from
september
s
peaks
and

in

territory
in
commodity
markets
oil
prices
had
climbed
nearly
percent
on
monday
in
what
was
seen
as
largely
a
technical
correction
after
weeks
of
losses
early
tuesday
crude

off

brent
crude
futures

closed
up
at

barrel
analysts
at
national
australia
bank
noted
the
steep
retreat
in
oil
would
drag
on
inflation
in
coming
months
perhaps
offering
further
reason
for
the
federal
reserve
to
go
slower
on
tightening
this
is
a
starkly
different
picture
to
just
a
few
months
ago
said
nab
s
market
strategist
tapas
strickland
a
stable
to
lower
inflation
outlook
means
there
is
no
urgency
for
the
fed
to
hike
rates
he
added
an
early
pause
is
thus
becoming
more
the
futures
market
has
already
shifted
to
imply
two
more
hikes
at
most
next
year
while
the
fed
itself
is
predicting
three
and
more
in
ears
will
thus
be
pricked
for
a
speech
by
fed
vice
chairman
richard
clarida
later
on
tuesday
ahead
of
