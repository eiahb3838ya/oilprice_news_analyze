update 2-macron won't cede to "thugs" as he confronts diesel tax anger
paris
reuters
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
tuesday
he
understood
the
anger
felt
by
voters
outside
france
s
big
cities
over
the
squeeze
that
fuel
prices
have
put
on
households
but
insisted
he
would
not
be
bounced
into
changing
policy
by
thugs
for
over
a
week
yellow
vest
protesters
have
blocked
roads
across
france
and
impeded
access
to
some
fuel
depots
shopping
centres
and
factories
in
protest
against
fuel
tax
hikes
they
say
have
eroded
their
spending
power
the
unrest
including
violent
skirmishes
stirred
by
fringe
groups
in
paris
over
the
weekend
has
stung
macron
as
he
tries
to
fight
back
against
a
sharp
fall
in
popularity
and
exposed
him
to
charges
of
being
out
of
touch
with
voters
a
little
over
months
into
his
presidency
it
has
raised
questions
about
whether
the
former
investment
banker
has
misjudged
his
ability
to
overhaul
france
and
its
economy
we
must
not
change
course
because
the
policy
direction
is
right
and
necessary
macron
said
in
an
address
outlining
his
blueprint
for
a
transition
towards
cleaner
energy
striving
to
show
both
humility
and
empathy
with
anger
among
provincial
voters
he
said
his
administration
needed
to
be
smarter
in
its
policymaking
to
avoid
the
emergence
of
a
france
where
workers
living
outside
cities
were
left
behind
and
grew
more
frustrated
with
a
perceived
urban
elite
the
crisis
though
illustrated
a
paradox
in
a
country
that
cherishes
its
generous
welfare
state
and
was
becoming
less
inclined
to
pay
for
it
through
taxes
he
said
you
can
not
chant
in
the
same
slogan
cut
taxes
and
build
more
crèches
schools
macron
said
two
people
have
been
killed
and
more
than
injured
during
the
days
of
yellow
vest
protests
across
france
macron
has
warned
that
the
violence
which
turned
some
parisian
boulevards
into
battlefields
on
saturday
risked
unnerving
foreigners
though
he
acknowledged
on
tuesday
that
many
protesters
held
legitimate
grievances
i
will
not
confuse
citizens
and
their
demands
with
thugs
macron
said
i
will
not
cede
any
ground
to
those
who
want
to
destroy
and
create
disorder
macron
said
but
he
conceded
the
increase
in
diesel
tax
which
kicked
in
just
as
pump
prices
were
rising
had
inflicted
more
pain
than
anticipated
he
sought
to
dampen
the
anger
of
protesters
dubbed
yellow
vests
because
of
the
jackets
they
wear
at
their
barricades
with
a
proposal
to
review
fuel
tax
rates
quarterly
to
take
into
account
global
oil
prices
protesters
manning
the
roadblocks
and
the
president
s
political
opponents
were
unimpressed
with
macron
s
overtures
even
after
the
president
said
his
ecology
minister
would
meet
representatives
of
their
protest
movement
later
in
the
day
we
re
all
fed
up
one
protester
told
bfm
tv
he
s
not
listening
to
us
our
anger
is
leader
marine
le
pen
lambasted
the
speech
as
devoid
of
any
solutions
while
the
socialist
party
leader
oliver
faure
said
macron
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
voters
complaints
conservative
lawmaker
damien
abad
said
macron
s
remarks
underlined
the
reality
gap
between
the
elysee
palace
and
the
rest
of
france
this
was
a
technocrat
s
speech
disconnected
from
the
reality
of
french
and
not
touching
on
their
worries
including
those
of
the
yellow
vests
