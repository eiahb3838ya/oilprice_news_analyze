serbia plans to halt dam boom in protected areas
sarajevo
reuters
serbia
has
drafted
a
new
law
to
ban
the
construction
of
small
hydro
power
plants
in
protected
areas
bowing
to
pressure
from
environmentalists
aiming
to
preserve
a
network
of
waterways
that
see
the
balkans
dubbed
the
blue
heart
of
europe
the
law
drafted
by
the
ministry
of
environmental
protection
will
be
forwarded
to
the
government
and
parliament
at
the
beginning
of
ivan
karic
the
state
secretary
at
the
ministry
told
reuters
on
tuesday
authorities
and
investors
across
the
western
balkans
view
hydro
power
as
a
green
alternative
to
other
sources
of
energy
and
say
it
could
help
countries
in
the
region
hit
the
renewable
energy
targets
they
need
to
meet
to
join
the
european
union
under
plans
being
considered
by
governments
a
network
of
nearly
hydro
plants
could
be
built
across
the
region
with
about
a
third
of
them
in
protected
areas
campaigners
say
the
dams
would
drain
rivers
used
by
local
communities
for
drinking
farming
fishing
and
tourism
while
destroying
the
habitat
of
species
unique
to
the
region
such
as
the
danube
salmon
and
the
balkan
lynx
if
this
extreme
trend
of
diverting
the
streams
into
pipelines
continues
we
would
soon
have
thousands
of
kilometers
of
balkan
streams
and
rivers
forever
lost
said
karic
he
also
said
that
under
the
new
legislation
small
hydro
plants
that
have
already
been
built
could
lose
a
right
to
subsidies
for
providing
power
if
it
is
determined
they
do
not
respect
environmental
procedures
organizations
riverwatch
and
euronatur
on
tuesday
published
a
document
showing
that
three
quarters
of
the
rivers
in
the
balkans
are
so
ecologically
valuable
they
should
be
completely
for
hydro
power
development
they
assessed
a
river
network
of
over
kilometers
between
slovenia
and
greece
we
call
upon
investors
and
in
the
balkans
and
in
the
eu
to
refrain
from
approving
hydro
power
plants
in
these
areas
in
the
future
