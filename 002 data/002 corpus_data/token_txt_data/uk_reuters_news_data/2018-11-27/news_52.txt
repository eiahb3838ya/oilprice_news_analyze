oil
markets
opened
cautiously
on
tuesday
with
many
traders
reluctant
to
take
on
large
new
positions
ahead
of
the
gathering
in
argentina
this
weekend
and
the
opec
meeting
in
austria
next
week
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
down
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
settlement
international
brent
crude
oil
futures
had
yet
to
trade
but
had
barely
hung
on
to
per
barrel
at
the
end
of
the
previous
day
after
friday
s
price
plunge
since
their
most
recent
peaks
in
early
october
oil
prices
have
lost
almost
a
third
of
their
value
weighed
down
by
an
emerging
supply
overhang
and
by
widespread
weakness
in
financial
markets
the
recent
weakness
seems
to
have
been
driven
by
a
wider
impending
sense
of
doom
amidst
weak
equities
geopolitics
subsequent
softening
demand
and
increasing
supply
said
jack
allardyce
oil
analyst
at
financial
services
firm
cantor
fitzgerald
europe
looking
ahead
allardyce
said
a
lot
depends
on
the
outcome
of
the
group
of
meeting
in
buenos
aires
where
the
united
states
and
china
are
expected
to
address
their
trade
disputes
and
on
a
meeting
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
the
leaders
of
the
countries
which
make
up
the
world
s
leading
economies
are
due
to
meet
on
and
with
the
trade
war
between
washington
and
beijing
top
of
the
agenda
opec
s
annual
meeting
takes
place
at
its
headquarters
in
vienna
on
and
the
group
will
discuss
its
output
policy
together
with
some
producers
including
russia
it
looks
as
though
the
market
has
already
decided
that
the
mooted
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
cut
to
output
isn
t
enough
to
offset
the
decline
in
demand
growth
projections
so
if
that
is
the
number
then
the
current
oil
price
level
could
remain
into
the
new
year
or
we
might
see
some
more
weakness
