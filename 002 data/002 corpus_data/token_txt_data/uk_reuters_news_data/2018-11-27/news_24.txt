natural
gas
prices
for
tuesday
at
the
waha
hub
in
the
permian
basin
in
texas
tumbled
almost
percent
to
their
lowest
on
record
because
of
limits
on
the
amount
of
gas
that
can
move
out
of
the
region
by
pipeline
prices
at
the
waha
hub
fell
to
an
average
of
cents
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
according
to
snl
data
available
on
the
refinitiv
eikon
going
back
to
traders
said
small
amounts
of
fuel
were
even
sold
at
negative
prices
as
producers
struggled
to
get
rid
of
the
gas
that
compares
with
an
average
of
so
far
this
year
in
and
a
average
of
the
permian
is
the
biggest
oil
producing
shale
basin
in
the
united
states
and
since
gas
is
associated
with
much
of
the
oil
comes
out
of
the
ground
it
is
also
the
nation
s
second
biggest
shale
gas
producing
region
behind
the
appalachian
permian
drillers
want
the
oil
which
is
much
more
valuable
than
gas
in
some
cases
the
lack
of
infrastructure
to
remove
gas
from
the
region
has
forced
some
producers
to
burn
or
flare
off
some
of
the
gas
they
pull
out
of
the
ground
several
energy
companies
are
building
or
developing
new
pipelines
to
enable
more
gas
to
flow
out
of
the
permian
region
including
oneok
inc
s
westex
and
roadrunner
projects
kinder
morgan
inc
s
gulf
coast
express
and
permian
highway
projects
and
namerico
energy
holdings
llc
s
pecos
trail
drillers
will
however
have
to
wait
until
and
beyond
for
those
projects
to
enter
service
as
the
number
of
rigs
seeking
oil
in
the
permian
rose
this
year
to
the
highest
since
the
amount
of
oil
and
associated
gas
produced
has
increased
to
record
highs
constraining
the
region
s
existing
gas
and
oil
pipelines
those
gas
constraints
have
boosted
the
discount
waha
trades
at
below
the
henry
hub
benchmark
in
louisiana
that
spread
rose
to
for
tuesday
its
widest
since
september
according
to
snl
data
that
compares
with
an
average
discount
of
cents
so
far
in

a
