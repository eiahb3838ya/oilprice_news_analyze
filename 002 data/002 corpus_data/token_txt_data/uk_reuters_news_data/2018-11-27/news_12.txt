france
plans
to
triple
its
onshore
wind
power
capacity
by
and
multiply
by
five
its
solar
power
generation
enabling
it
to
boost
the
share
of
renewables
in
its
energy
mix
to
percent
according
to
the
energy
plan
presented
on
tuesday
french
president
emmanuel

said
the

would
increase
spending
on

to
billion

france
has
lagged
behind
other
european
nations
with
only
around
percent
of
electricity
consumption
coming
from
renewables
by
the
production
of
the
onshore
wind
farm
will
be
tripled
and
the
amount
of
energy
produced
from
solar
photovoltaic
multiplied
by
five
macron
said
in
a
televised
speech
france
is
on
track
to
meet
its
target
of
gigawatt
of
installed
wind
power
capacity
by
the
end
of
the
year
but
installation
of
solar
panels
would
likely
fall
short
of
the
gw
target
by
the
end
of
the
year
macron
said
the
government
would
make
sure
power
prices
from
renewables
projects
are
kept
low
for
consumers
while
developing
more
power
interconnectors
with
european
neighbors
so
as
to
always
benefit
from
the
power
to
keep
a
check
on
power
prices
the
government
also
plans
to
reform
france
s
arenh
market
mechanism
which
allows
alternative
power
suppliers
to
buy
up
to
terrawatt
hour
twh
of
power
produced
by
french
nuclear
reactors
every
year
at
a
fixed
price
of
the
mechanism
which
allows
french
consumers
to
have
one
of
the
lowest
electricity
prices
in
europe
is
expected
to
end
in
macron
said
it
is
indispensable
that
french
people
continue
to
benefit
from
it
so
long
as
the
