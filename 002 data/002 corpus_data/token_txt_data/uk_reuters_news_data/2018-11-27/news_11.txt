the
european
union
s
climate
chief
on
tuesday
called
on
the
bloc
to
aim
for
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
the
most
ambitious
path
in
a
strategy
due
to
be
announced
on
wednesday
with
president
donald
trump
pulling
the
united
states
out
of
international
efforts
to
curb
global
warming
miguel
arias
canete
said
the
eu
had
to
lead
by
example
at
the
next
round
of
united
nations
talks
on
climate
change
opening
in
katowice
poland
on
sunday
the
strategy
to
be
presented
by
the
eu
executive
on
wednesday
sets
out
eight
scenarios
for
the
bloc
s
nations
to
cut
emissions
in
line
with
the
paris
agreement
two
of
which
chart
of
a
course
for
the
europe
to
become
climate
neutral
it
s
worth
becoming
the
first
major
economy
to
fully
decarbonise
to
fully
reach
net
zero
emissions
europe
s
climate
commissioner
arias
canete
told
reuters
on
tuesday
it
is
absolutely
possible
for
sure
it
will
require
lots
of
investment
it
will
require
lots
of
effort
but
it
is
under
a
package
of
climate
legislation
passed
since
the
paris
accord
from
energy
efficiency
to
renewable
targets
and
curbs
on
transport
pollution
the
eu
is
on
track
to
overshoot
its
pledge
to
reduce
emissions
by
percent
from
levels
by
the
bloc
currently
is
set
to
reduce
emissions
by
percent
by
and
percent
by
the
message
of
the
commission
is
that
s
okay
but
we
need
to
do
more
arias
canete
said
the
thing
is
do
you
want
to
be
a
front
mover
or
a
follower
the
talks
are
the
most
important
since
the
paris
agreement
with
delegates
from
nations
set
to
haggle
over
the
details
and
produce
a
rule
book
for
the
pact
which
the
united
states
has
announced
it
will
quit
by
publishing
its
ambitious
strategy
on
wednesday
eu
official
hope
to
pull
more
weight
at
what
are
expected
to
be
tough
talks
amid
division
among
world
powers
it
will
not
be
an
easy
cop
but
the
european
union
arrives
with
lots
of
credibility
to
these
talks
and
we
can
show
the
rest
of
the
world
developed
and
developing
that
we
take
climate
policy
very
seriously
arias
canete
said
the
role
of
the
united
states
is
less
relevant
and
that
puts
more
burden
on
our
shoulders
because
we
have
to
occupy
territory
that
in
the
past
was
occupied
by
while
trump
on
monday
rejected
projections
that
global
warming
will
cause
severe
economic
harm
a
report
detailing
the
dangers
has
spurred
ministers
from
eu
nations
to
call
for
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
be
cut
at
a
faster
rate
than
planned
calls
for
more
ambition
however
have
divided
the
eu
many
nations
including
economic
powerhouse
germany
are
struggling
to
meet
their
targets
are
worried
that
tougher
cuts
would
threaten
industry
eu
national
governments
have
until
the
end
of
to
draft
their
own
plans
for
reducing
energy
usage
to
keep
in
line
with
the
bloc
s
goals
to
respond
to
the
report
and
achieve
net
negative
emissions
arias
canete
said
the
bloc
s
economies
will
have
to
invest
more
in
carbon
capture
and
storage
but
also
encourage
consumers
to
change
their
habits
