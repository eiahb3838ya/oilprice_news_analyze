has
announced
it
will
quit
the
deal
aims
to
shift
the
world
economy
away

to
between
and
degrees
celsius
to
avert
more
extreme
weather
rising
sea
levels
and
the

species
the
pact
was
years
in
the
making
and
commits
almost
every
country
to
fight
global
warming
but
rules
are
needed
to
bring
about
real
cuts
in
emissions
and
ensure
they
are
closely
monitored
scientists

added
to
pressure
for
a
strong
outcome
from

saying
the

hit
the
threshold
around
and
unprecedented
changes
are
needed
in
the
way
people
use
energy
despite
this
call

divisions

implications

at

time
acknowledging
the
scope
of
the
task
ahead
only
by
a
miracle
can
we
realise
success
he
said
last
month
although
miracles
were
a
polish
speciality
then
earlier
this
month
he
added
undoubtedly
the
geopolitical
situation
in
was
much
easier
for
discussing
global
agreements
than
the
one
we
have
in
however
my
talks
with
representatives
from
the
whole
world
show
that
there
is
a
willingness
to
reach
a
compromise
in
political
economic
rifts
developing
nations
and
those
vulnerable
to
climate
change

that
some
industrialised
countries
more
responsible
for
climate
change
were
backsliding
on
the
polluter
pays
principle
which
will
make
it
hard
to
reach
a
consensus
in
the
european
union
european
commission
climate
chief
miguel
arias
canete
s
call
for
more
ambitious
goals
was
rebuffed
by
chancellor
angela
merkel
who
said
it
would
be
because
some
european
countries
including
germany
were
struggling
to
meet
their
targets
the
united
states
has
a
seat
at
the
negotiating
table
until
it
can
formally
quit
in

at
the
earliest
it
may
use
its
remaining
time
to
try
to
develop
ammunition
for
its
trade
