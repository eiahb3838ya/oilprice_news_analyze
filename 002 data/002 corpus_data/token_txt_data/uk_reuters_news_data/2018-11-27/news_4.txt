analysis-oil investors still on edge, waiting on opec's word
new
york
reuters
global
oil
markets
are
nervously
eyeing
opec
s
upcoming
meeting
for
clarity
on
future
supply
as
the
dust
settles
after
a
rout
in
crude
markets
over
the
last
several
weeks
so
far
there
is
no
clear
view
if
production
will
be
cut
or
remain
steady
and
that
uncertainty
raises
the
risk
of
more
volatile
trading
after
mass
selling
caused
oil
to
drop
by
more
than
percent
in
little
over
a
month
participants
generally
expect
opec
will
trim
production
at
its
meeting
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
there
is
enough
uncertainty
to
make
traders
defensive
speculators
once
betting
on
oil
are
now
going
the
other
direction
having
boosted
short
positions
in
oil
to
their
biggest
in
more
than
a
year
the
options
market
currently
shows
a
record
number
of
open
positions
in
oil
falling
to
or
a
barrel
by
the
end
of
though
bullish
bets
have
also
edged
higher
getting
some
resolution
around
the
intent
of
the
saudis
and
opec
would
go
a
long
way
to
helping
the
market
feel
better
said
greg
sharenow
portfolio
manager
at
pimco
who
more
than
billion
in
commodity
assets
he
added
that
if
opec
does
not
reduce
production
prices
could
tumble
to
a
barrel
the
signals
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
leader
saudi
arabia
have
been
mixed
officials
familiar
with
saudi
plans
told
reuters
they
expect
it
to
trim
production
but
an
industry
source
also
said
saudi
oil
output
exceeded
mln
bpd
for
the
first
time
in
november
the
cartel
s
deliberations
have
been
compounded
by
the
growing
influence
of
russia
whose
production
has
climbed
to
a
era
high
and
by
the
united
states
which
is
now
producing
at
a
record
million
bpd
russian
oil
executives
and
officials
have
been
skeptical
of
the
need
to
cut
output
meanwhile
the
decision
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
only
to
grant
waivers
to
major
importers
of
that
nation
s
oil
threw
the
market
for
a
loop
and
commodity
trading
advisory
funds
ctas
had
bet
on
a
further
rally
ahead
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
but
instead
were
caught
after
waivers
were
announced
and
production
surged
faster
than
expected
wall
street
banks
looking
to
protect
against
exposure
from
selling
options
to
oil
producers
intensified
that

implied
volatility
a
gauge
of

demand
soared
with
crude

implied
volatility
hitting
its
highest
level
since
february
last

the

hit

at
record
levels
but
bets
on

rising
to
a

by
are
also
high
as
some
see
the
as
having
gone
too
far
too
fast
as
sharp
as
the
falloff
has
been
i
think
the
market
is
poised
to
have
as

a
comeback
said
shawn
reynolds
portfolio
manager
of
the
vaneck
global
hard
assets
fund
in
new
york
in
recent
weeks
both
opec
and
the
international
energy
agency
cut
their

forecasts
due
to
sagging
fortunes
in
developing
economies
the

curve
the
market
s
primary
indicator
of
expectations
for
supply
and
demand
now
signals
a
potential
glut
through
cme
group
s
opec
watch
tool
which
uses
activity
to
predict
the
probability
of
opec
s
decision
currently
puts
a
percent
chance
on
a
small
opec
production
cut
and
a
percent
chance
of
little
to
no
change
in
output
this
uncertainty
is
in
part
due
to
president
donald
trump
whose
decision
not
to
punish
the
saudis
for
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
has
raised
the
possibility
that
the
kingdom
will
be
less
inclined
to
cross
trump
by
cutting
output
dramatically
president
trump
s
tacit
support
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
known
as
mbs
in
the
wake
of
the
khashoggi
murder
seems
to
have
provided
him
