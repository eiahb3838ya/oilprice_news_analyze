seemed

clouding
what

been
a

said
he
expects
to
raise
tariffs
on

in
chinese
imports
to
percent
from
percent
currently
he
said
it
was
highly
unlikely
he
would
accept
china
s
request
to
hold
off
on
the
increase
planned
for
the
comments
ran
counter
to
recent
speculation
about
a
possible
deal
when
trump
meets
chinese
president
xi
jinping
at
the
summit
in
buenos

later
this

the

a

analyst
at

in

if
there
s
no
breakthrough
that
makes
it
more
likely
that
more
tariffs
will
be
imposed

that

initially
put
currencies
including
the
australian
dollar
on
the
defensive
although
it
climbed
back
into
positive
territory
in

trade
the

after
trump
said
on
monday
the
agreement
allowing
the
united
kingdom
to
leave
the
european

may
make

between
washington
and

more

s
comments
that

imported

trump
s
remarks
came
just
as
the
mood
among

had
shown

next

oil
had
climbed
nearly
percent
on
monday
but
that
was
seen
as
largely
a
technical
correction
after
weeks
of
heavy
losses
driven
both
by
oversupply
and
demand
worries
crude

off

while
brent

were
down
percent
to
analysts
at

bank
noted
the
percent
drop
in
oil
since
early
october
would
drag
on
inflation
in
coming
months
perhaps
offering
further
reason
for
the
federal

to
go
slower
on

this
is
a
starkly
different
picture
to
just
a
few
months

said
nab
s
market
strategist
tapas
strickland
a
stable
to
lower
inflation
outlook
means
there
is
no
urgency
for
the
fed
to
hike
rates
an
early
pause
is
thus
becoming
more
the

market
has
already
shifted
to
imply
two
more
hikes
at
most
next
yea
the

itself
is
predicting
three

more

hints
on

moves
may
