harsh
report
from
the

investors
have
only
the
flimsiest
hope
that
the
meeting
in
argentina
will
amount
to
more
than
a
hill
of

trump
s
remarks
came
just
as
the
mood
among
investors
had
shown
signs
of
brightening
and
wall
street
took
heart
from
an
upbeat
holiday
shopping
period
the

ended
monday
up
percent
while
the

came
after

recorded
its
lowest
close

months
down
more
than

territory
in

oil
prices
faltered
anew
amid
record
production
by
saudi
arabia
it
had
climbed
nearly
percent
on
monday
but
that
was
seen
as
largely
a
technical
correction
after
weeks
of
heavy
losses
crude
was
off
cents
at
a
barrel
while
brent
futures
fell
cents
to
analysts
at
national
australia
bank
noted
the
percent
drop
in
oil
since
early
october
would
drag
on
inflation
in
coming
months
perhaps
offering
further
reason
for
the
federal
reserve
to
go
slower
on
tightening
this
is
a
starkly
different
picture
to
just
a
few
months
ago
said
nab
s
market
strategist
tapas
strickland
a
stable
to
lower
inflation
outlook
means
there
is
no
urgency
for
the
fed
to
hike
rates
he
added
an
early
pause
is
thus
becoming
more
the
futures
market
has
already
shifted
to
imply
two
more
hikes
at
most
next
year
while
the
fed
itself
is
predicting
three
and
more
in
ears
will
thus
be
pricked
for
a
speech
by
fed
vice
chairman
richard
clarida
later
on
tuesday
ahead
of
