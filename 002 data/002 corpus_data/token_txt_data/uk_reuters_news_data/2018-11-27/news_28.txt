iran
s
nuclear
chief
said
on
tuesday
he
was
warning
the
european
union
s
top
diplomat
that
tehran
s
patience
was
running
out
on
the
bloc
s
pledges
to
keep
up
oil
trade
despite
sanctions
ali
akbar
salehi
head
of
iran
s
atomic
energy
organisation
said
the
islamic
republic
could
resume
its
percent
uranium
enrichment
if
it
fails
to
see
the
economic
benefit
of
the
deal
that
placed
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
if
we
can
not
sell
our
oil
and
we
don
t
enjoy
financial
transactions
then
i
don
t
think
keeping
the
deal
will
benefit
us
anymore
salehi
told
reuters
ahead
of
a
meeting
with
eu
foreign
policy
chief
federica
mogherini
in
brussels
i
will
pass
certainly
a
word
of
caution
to
her
mogherini
i
think
the
period
of
patience
for
our
people
is
getting
more
limited
and
limited
he
said
we
are
running
out
of
the
assumed
timeline
which
was
in
terms
of
the
meeting
was
due
on
tuesday
afternoon
with
no
media
statements
expected
afterwards
under
the
deal
iran
restricted
its
disputed
nuclear
programme
widely
seen
in
the
west
as
a
disguised
effort
to
develop
the
means
to
make
atomic
bombs
in
exchange
for
an
end
to
international
sanctions
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
the
accord
in
may
arguing
that
it
did
not
rein
in
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
or
support
for
armed
proxies
and
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
exports
this
month
but
europe
sees
the
nuclear
deal
as
an
important
element
of
international
security
the
eu
and
other
remaining
parties
china
and
russia
have
struggled
to
preserve
trade
incentives
for
iran
to
respect
the
deal
s
nuclear
curbs
under
pressure
in
brussels
for
talks
on
civilian
nuclear
cooperation
that
eu
officials
intended
as
a
signal
support
for
the
accord
salehi
said
the
bloc
s
efforts
were
encouraging
but
added
we
have
not
yet
seen
any
tangible
he
welcomed
an
eu
plan
to
establish
a
special
financial
vehicle
for
trade
with
iran
but
only
if
it
could
preserve
iranian
oil
exports
its
economic
lifeline
it
the
spv
could
be
helpful
in
keeping
the
deal
alive
he
said
if
there
is
nothing
to
reap
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
us
staying
in
because
voices
in
iran
are
day
by
day
becoming
more
against
the
iran
s
oil
exports
are
expected
to
drop
sharply
to
about
million
bpd
in
november
from
a
peak
of
million
bpd
earlier
this
year
however
output
is
expected
to
recover
somewhat
from
december
thanks
to
waivers
including
for
two
eu
nations
greece
and
italy
under
the
agreement
with
six
world
powers
iran
stopped
producing
percent
enriched
uranium
and
gave
up
the
majority
of
its
stockpile
salehi
reiterated
warnings
that
iran
has
the
technical
capacity
to
ramp
up
enrichment
if
the
deal
unravels
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
go
back
to
what
we
were
before
even
to
a
better
position
he
said
we
can
start
the
percent
enrichment
activity
we
can
increase
the
amount
of
the
enriched
uranium
refined
to
percent
fissile
purity
is
well
beyond
the
percent
normally
required
to
fuel
civilian
nuclear
power
plants
although
still
well
short
of
highly
enriched
or
to
percent
purity
needed
for
a
nuclear
bomb
