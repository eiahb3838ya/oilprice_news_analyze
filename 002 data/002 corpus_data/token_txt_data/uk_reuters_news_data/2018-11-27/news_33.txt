investment
to
tackle
climate
change
is
increasing
around
the
world
but
remains
far
too
low
to
limit
global
warming
and
avoid
its
most
harmful
consequences
as
governments
have
committed
to
do
analysts
said
on
tuesday
a
report
from
the
climate
policy
initiative
cpi
an
international
think
tank
said
initial
estimates
for
global
flows
of
climate
finance
in
ranged
from
about
billion
to
billion
a
to
percent
increase
from
updated
figures
for
and
based
on
new
data
becoming
available
showed
an
annual
average
flow
of
billion
which
was
percent
higher
than
in
cpi
said
the
early
figures
for
reflected
rising
investment
in
electric
vehicles
and
funding
from
development
banks
renewable
energy
investment
held
steady
after
dropping
percent
in
on
falling
costs
and
fewer
projects
but
climate
finance
is
still
only
a
small
share
of
what
will
be
needed
to
decarbonise
economies
in
the
coming
decades
as
governments
vowed
to
do
in
the
paris
agreement
it
noted
governments
will
meet
in
poland
to
work
out
rules
for
putting
that
accord
into
practice
unfortunately
we
still
have
far
to
go
said
barbara
buchner
cpi
s
executive
director
for
climate
finance
leaders
need
to
urgently
continue
and
ramp
up
the
progress
toward
the
transition
needed
to
address
climate
change
she
added
in
a
statement
the
cpi
report
noted
the
particularly
sparse
resources
allocated
for
adapting
to
wilder
weather
and
rising
seas
as
the
planet
heats
up
total
adaptation
finance
all
from
government
sources
was
only
billion
per
year
in
it
said
with
the
world
already
struggling
with
more
destructive
wildfires
storms
droughts
and
floods
that
spending
is
extremely
low
compared
to
the
need
which
un
environment
has
estimated
at
billion
per
year
investment
in
adaptation
is
hard
to
track
but
if
included
the
overall
amount
for
adaptation
could
be
much
higher
the
cpi
report
noted
lead
author
padraig
oliver
said
corporations
and
investors
were
under
growing
pressure
to
manage
climate
change
risks
the
impacts
are
happening
now
and
it
is
an
issue
that
is
far
more
front
and
centre
for
businesses
and
their
bottom
line
than
three
to
four
years
ago
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
ahead
of
the
annual
climate
conference
figures
published
last
friday
showed
rich
countries
were
on
track
to
meet
a
goal
of
raising
billion
a
year
by
to
help
poor
nations
go
green
and
cope
with
climate
shifts
analysts
said
that
report
said
total
climate
finance
increased
percent
between
and
reaching
billion
in
the
cpi
figures
feed
into
the
assessment
but
do
not
include
international
energy
agency
estimates
of
investment
in
energy
efficiency
which
is
why
they
are
lower
oliver
said
the
cpi
report
highlighted
a
jump
in
investment
in
electric
vehicles
around
the
world
between
and
that
rose
percent
each
year
on
average
to
reach
billion
in
policies
to
promote
sustainable
transport
are
propelling
investment
and
it
will
likely
continue
rising
