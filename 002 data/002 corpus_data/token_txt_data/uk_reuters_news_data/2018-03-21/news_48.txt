proponents
of

claim
they

those

claims
will
now
come
under
heightened
scrutiny
in
theory
vehicles
should
eliminate
several
major
causes
of
road
traffic
accidents
including
excessive
speed
intoxication
and
inattention
but
there
are
concerns
about
how
vehicles
will
interact
with
unpredictable
human
drivers
and
pedestrians
as
well
as
unmapped
hazards
such
as
temporary
road
obstructions
there
are
also
fears
about
how
vehicles
would
cope

in

worrying
trend
roads
appear
to
have
become
more
dangerous
in
the
last
few
years
reversing
the
downtrend
over
the
previous
quarter
of
a
century
the
number
of
crashes
injuries
and
fatalities
has
been
growing
faster
than
highway
traffic
volumes
since
around
road
deaths
rose
to
per
million
miles
driven
in
up
from

and
a
recent
low
of
in
the
trend
among
pedestrians
has
been
particularly
worrying
with
fatalities
surging
by
percent

the
highest

many
road
accidents
have
been
attributed
in

driver
misbehaviour

in
speed

than

distraction

relatively
dangerous

the
question
is
whether
vehicles
increase
or
reduce
the
existing
risks
not
whether
they
can
eliminate
risk
altogether

supporters
and
critics
have
long
acknowledged
the
inevitability
of
a
vehicle
being
involved
in
a
serious
accident
and
eventually
being
the
cause
of
a
fatality
some
had
hoped
vehicles
would
log
million
miles
or
more
before
the
first
fatal
accident
to
prove
they
are
safer
but
that
shows
a
misunderstanding
of
how
statistics
work
since
the
first
fatal
accident
is
as
likely
to
occur
on
the
first
mile
as
on
the
mile
assuming
the
safety
level
remains
constant
until
vehicles
are
tested
on
actual
roads
for
tens
of
millions
or
even
hundreds
of
millions
of
miles
it
will
not
be
possible
to
evaluate
their
safety
relative
to
vehicles
the
advent
of
vehicles
poses
complicated
questions
about
safety
but
is
no
different
from
any
other
new
technology
every
new
technology
is
initially
beset
by
accidents
and
that
has
been
particularly
true
in
transportation
where
early
steam
engines
automobiles
and
aircraft
were
all
initially
all
federal
safety
regulation
in
the
united
states
stems
originally
from
the
response
to
the
problem
of
exploding
steam
boilers
in
the
nineteenth
century
bursting
boilers
and
the
federal
power
burke
the
advent
of
steam
engines
on
riverboats
prompted
a
spate
of
explosions
killing
crew
passengers
and
unlucky
bystanders
between
and
lives
were
lost
in
boiler
explosions
on
steamboats
between
and
there
were
explosions
killing
people
one
particularly
serious
explosion
aboard
the
steamboat
helen
mcgregor
near
memphis
reportedly
killed
people
the
many
distressing
accidents
which
have
of
late
occurred
in
that
portion
of
our
navigation
carried
on
by
the
use
of
steam
power
deserve
the
immediate
and
unremitting
attention
of
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
country
president
andrew
jackson
wrote
in
his
state
of
the
union
message
to
congress
in
the
fact
that
the
number
of
those
fatal
disasters
is
constantly
increasing
notwithstanding
the
great
improvements
which
are
everywhere
made
in
the
machinery
employed
and
in
the
rapid
advances
which
have
made
in
that
branch
of
science
shows
very
clearly
that
they
are
in
a
great
degree
the
result
of
criminal
that
these
evils
may
be
greatly
lessened
if
not
substantially
removed
by
means
of
precautionary
and
penal
legislation
seems
to
be
highly
the
eventual
response
after
many
years
of
delay
was
a
system
of
safety
regulation
including
boiler
standards
and
inspections
the
arrival
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
and
the
automobile
generated
a
similar
surge
of
accidents
among
drivers
and
pedestrians
and
a
legal
and
regulatory
response
early
aircraft
too
were
far
more
prone
to
mechanical
failure
or
pilot
error
than
has
been
the
case
in
recent
years
but
no
one
would
now
suggest
steam
boilers
automobiles
or
aircraft
are
simply
too
dangerous
to
be
practical
any
more
than
in
future
people
will
think
vehicles
are
too
dangerous
in
every
case
of
new
technology
safety
lessons
have
been
learned
through
a
painful
process
of
trial
and
error
that
has
unfortunately
cost
lives
vehicles
will
be
no
different
the
challenge
is
to
introduce
sensible
and
balanced
safety
regulations
while
encouraging
continued
development
of
a
technology
that
has
potential
to
save
lives
and
bring
a
range
of
other
benefits
that
requires
a
very
transparent
approach
from
the
technology
companies
and
a
calm
and
reasoned
response
from
politicians
regulators
and
journalists
