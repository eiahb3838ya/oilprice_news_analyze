a
rise
in
oil
prices
to
a
high
and
signs
that
inflation
remains
in
check
helped
reverse
a
decline
in
world
equity
markets
wednesday
the
federal
reserve
raised
benchmark
interest
rates
by
percentage
point
as
expected
at
the
conclusion
of
a
policy
meeting
and
said
growth
in
the
economy
continues
to
look
strong
the
fed
s
measures
of
inflation
were
little
changed
helping
reassure
investors
that
the
central
bank
may
not
raise
rates
more
than
three
times
this
year
the
positive
for
the
market
is
that
the
focus
on
future
rate
hikes
seems
more
due
to
a
fed
view
of
a
better
economy
than
necessarily
inflation
prevention
if
the
economy
can
grow
with
moderate
inflation
that
is
certainly
the
ideal
situation
for
stocks

rick
meckler
president

new

the
dow

industrial
average
rose
points

the
nasdaq
composite
added
points
or

to
world
markets
had
traded
lower
earlier
after
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
china
was
planning
against
trade
tariffs
european
shares
fell
and
investors
scurried
for
the
safety
of
german
government
bonds
and
the
japanese
yen
shares
of
facebook
inc
rebounded
percent
after
two
days
of
steep
losses
that
had
wiped
some
billion
off
the
value
of
shares
of
the
social
media
company
those
declines
caused
by
uproar
over
the
alleged
misuse
of
user
data
filtered
through
the
tech
sector
with
technology
companies
in
the
benchmark
s
p
down
percent
for
the
week
to
date
a
equity
index
was
off
percent
after
the
wsj
report
on
china
the
yen
typically
bought
during
times
of
stress
rose
to
the
day
s
high
versus
the
dollar
around
yen
so
far
we
have
seen
trade
skirmishes
which
are
not
material
enough
to
affect
the
world
economy
but
if
we
see
retaliation
and
significant
trade
disruptions
it
s
a
different
order
or
magnitude
which
could
begin
to
affect
global
growth
forecasts
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
the
tech
selloff
was
a
serious
setback
to
markets
just
as
they
recovered
from
an
selloff

been
the

the
wsj
report
on
potential
chinese
tariffs

as
president
donald
trump
prepares

announce

earlier
this

this
week

meeting
of
finance
ministers
and
central
bankers
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
failed
to
defuse
tensions
with
the
saying
only
that
it
recognized
the
need
for
more
dialogue
and
fears
of
a
trade
war

also
weighed
on
