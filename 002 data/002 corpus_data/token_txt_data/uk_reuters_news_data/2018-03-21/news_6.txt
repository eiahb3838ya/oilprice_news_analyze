update 5-drillers give tepid response to record u.s. offshore lease sale
reuters
oil
and
gas
drillers
bid
on
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
gulf
of
mexico
acreage
offered
on
wednesday
in
the
largest
lease
sale
in
american
history
a
setback
to
the
trump
administration
s
efforts
to
rapidly
pump
up
investment
in
the
region
the
interior
department
had
offered
up
a
record
million
acres
million
hectares
for
development
in
the
gulf
an
area
twice
the
size
of
florida
with
discounted
royalty
rates
on
the
shallower
tracts
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
ramp
up
fossil
fuels
output
but
companies
facing
dollar
price
tags
to
develop
the
acreage
and
tempted
by
better
terms
overseas
bid
on
just
percent
of
the
area
up
for
grabs
winning
with
bids
that
averaged
just
an
acre
percent
below
levels
last
year
and
a
fraction
of
those
in
the
region
in
when
oil
prices
were
higher
according
to
the
data
in
all
the
auction
yielded
million
in
winning
bids
slightly
more
than
a
smaller
gulf
of
mexico
auction
last
year
but
a
tenth
of
the
amount
pulled
in
during
a
much
smaller
lease
sale
in
the
central
gulf
in
the
interior
department
s
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
which
administered
the
auction
characterized
the
results
as
robust
i
think
we
re
seeing
continued
consistent
investment
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
boem
spokesman
mike
celata
said
in
a
conference
call
with
reporters
adding
he
forecast
increasing
oil
and
gas
production
from
the
region
for
years
he
said
companies
including
majors
royal
dutch
shell
plc
bp
plc
chevron
corp
and
total
sa
had
placed
bids
on
blocks
but
critics
of
the
administration
called
the
unusually
large
lease
sale
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
output
is
already
smashing
records
thanks
to
improved
drilling
technology
that
has
opened
up
cheaper
onshore
reservoirs
and
brazil
and
mexico
are
also
competing
for
drilling
investment
in
their
own
deepwater
acreage
often
with
better
terms
offering
a
nearly
unrestricted
supply
in
a
low
demand
market
with
a
cut
rate
royalty
and
almost
no
competition
is
bad
policy
and
an
inexcusable
waste
of
taxpayer
resources
the
center
for
american
progress
a
policy
think
tank
said
in
a
statement
william
turner
senior
research
analyst
at
wood
mackenzie
said
the
sales
statistics
were
on
par
with
the
lows
that
we
saw
last
year
referring
to
a
lease
sale
in
that
had
yielded
million
in
winning
bids
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
had
said
ahead
of
the
sale
that
the
offering
would
be
a
bellwether
of
industry
demand
in
the
region
and
billed
the
effort
as
a
way
to
help
the
united
states
become
more
energy
after
the
sale
interior
assistant
secretary
joe
balash
said
today
s
lease
sale
is
yet
another
step
our
nation
has
taken
to
achieve
economic
security
and
energy
lows
the
government
offers
gulf
of
mexico
leases
annually
but
usually
in
smaller
regional
batches
an
auction
in
march
for
example
offered
up
million
acres
in
the
central
gulf
of
mexico
planning
region
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
had
expected
demand
for
the
acreage
to
get
a
boost
from
higher
oil
prices
compared
with
a
year
ago
and
lower
corporate
taxes
but
it
pointed
out
interest
would
be
tempered
by
competition
from
latin
america
and
concerns
over
the
impact
that
tariffs
on
steel
imports
could
have
on
costs
the
national
ocean
industries
association
which
represents
offshore
drillers
also
sounded
a
note
of
caution
the
united
states
must
continue
to
evaluate
how
to
keep
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
other
parts
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
attractive
in
light
of
competition
from
brazil
and
mexico
it
said
in
an
emailed
statement
drillers
have
been
trying
to
trim
their
gulf
of
mexico
drilling
costs
in
recent
years
to
make
certain
projects
there
more
competitive
bp
for
example
has
said
its
mad
dog
platform
will
be
economic
with
crude
at
just
a
barrel
current
oil
prices
are
over
a
barrel
bp
which
bid
over
million
on
parcels
on
wednesday
structured
its
bids
around
its
existing
production
platforms
and
areas
it
has
already
identified
as
being
highly
prospective
spokesman
jason
ryan
said
in
a
statement
still
many
new
projects
in
the
deepwater
gulf
of
mexico
come
with
dollar
price
tags
and
require
major
investment
up
front
making
them
a
tough
sell
some
oil
companies
like
exxon
mobil
corp
are
focusing
on
new
deepwater
projects
outside
of
the
united
states
where
royalties
and
tax
structures
can
be
more
favorable
in
terms
of
exxon
they
have
plenty
of
things
to
do
in
guyana
so
why
bother
getting
too
active
in
this
round
in
gulf
of
mexico
said
lysle
brinker
a
research
director
at
ihs
markit
noting
exxon
s
absence
from
the
bidding
in
an
effort
to
pump
up
interest
the
interior
department
had
cut
the
royalty
rate
companies
must
pay
in
shallow
offshore
waters
by
a
third
to
percent
and
is
considering
cutting
the
rate
for
deeper
waters
too
the
boem
s
celata
pointed
out
that
tracts
received
bids
on
wednesday
an
increase
from
past
lease
sales
that
he
attributed
to
the
lower
royalty
rates
the
administration
is
eyeing
further
vast
lease
sales
offshore
in
the
future
having
proposed
opening
up
parts
of
the
arctic
atlantic
and
pacific
an
idea
that
has
faced
pushback
from
several
governors
in
coastal
states
democratic
lawmakers
have
also
warned
the
interior
department
not
to
extend
the
lower
royalty
rates
to
deepwater
acreage
saying
the
move
would
