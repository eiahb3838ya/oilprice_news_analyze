march
reuters
the
interior
department
will
hold
the
largest
lease
sale
in
american
history
in
the
offshore
gulf
of
mexico
on
wednesday
in
a
major
test
of
the
oil
industry
s
appetite
for
federal
acreage
being
offered
by
the
trump
administration
the
auction
of
more
than
million
acres
million
hectares
an
area
twice
the
size
of
florida
is
part
of
an
effort
by
president
donald
trump
s
administration
to
ramp
up
fossil
fuels
production
by
lowering
royalty
rates
opening
up
more
public
lands
and
rolling
back
environmental
protections
but
the
push
comes
it
comes
at
a
time
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
output
is
already
smashing
records
thanks
to
improved
drilling
technology
that
has
opened
up
cheaper
onshore
reservoirs
and
as
brazil
and
mexico
compete
for
drillers
in
their
own
deepwater
acreage
the
produces
about
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
about
percent
of
the
national
total
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
american
energy
production
can
be
competitive
vincent
devito
an
energy
policy
advisor
at
interior
said
of
the
auction
people
need
jobs
the
gulf
coast
states
need
revenue
and
americans
do
not
want
to
be
dependent
on
foreign
others
called
the
unusually
large
lease
sale
offering
a
nearly
unrestricted
supply
in
a
low
demand
market
with
a
cut
rate
royalty
and
almost
no
competition
is
bad
policy
and
an
inexcusable
waste
of
taxpayer
resources
the

a

said
in
a
statement
the
government
offers
gulf
of
mexico
leases
annually
but
usually
in
smaller
regional
batches

mackenzie
energy
analyst
mfon
usoro
said
she
expected
demand
for
the
acreage
to
be
slightly
higher
than
in
last
year
s
auctions
thanks
to
higher
oil
prices
and
lower
corporate
taxes
but
she
noted
competition
from
latin
america
and
concerns
over
the
impact
of
steel
tariffs
on
capital
costs
could
hurt
she
said
she
expected
traditional
deepwater
oil
and
gas
drillers
like
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
chevron
corp
to
lead
the
pack
at
the
auction
a
spokeswoman
for
the
american
petroleum
institute
which
represents
oil
and
gas
companies
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
in
an
effort
to
pump
up
demand
the
interior
department
has
said
it
is
considering
cutting
the
royalty
rate
companies
must
pay
in
offshore
waters
by
a
third
to
percent
the
administration
had
already
cut
that
rate
for
shallow
water
acreage
offered
in
a
gulf
of
mexico
lease
sale
last
year
which
nonetheless
yielded
relatively
low
bids
on
a
small
percentage
of
the
acreage
offered
a
reuters
analysis
of
government
data
showed
the
amount
of
money
per
acre
that
oil
companies
spent
in
the
gulf
in
was
about
a
third
the
levels
in
when
oil
prices
were
higher
energy
firms
also
bid
for
less
than
percent
of
the
offered
acreage
in
compared
with
percent
in
the
administration
is
eyeing
further
vast
lease
sales
offshore
in
the
future
having
proposed
opening
up
parts
of
the
arctic
atlantic
and
pacific
an
idea
that
has
faced
pushback
from
several
