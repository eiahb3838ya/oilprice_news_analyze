pttep
is
looking
closer
to
home
for
upstream
oil
and
gas
assets
in
a
drive
to
boost
its
reserves
and
production
as
oil
prices
have
recovered
a
senior
company
executive
said
on
wednesday
global
oil
futures
that
have
held
above
a
barrel
and
sharp
in
the
upstream
sector
are
encouraging
national
oil
companies
and
international
majors
to
pump
money
into
exploration
and
production
although
many
producers
remain
wary
that
surging
oil
output
could
hold
crude
prices
back
since
the
oil
crisis
that
began
in
and
saw
prices
slump
to
less
then
a
barrel
in
early
pttep
has
cut
costs
and
increased
efficiency
bringing
its
average
cost
of
oil
and
gas
output
to
per
barrel
last
year
down
from
per
barrel
now
we
re
coming
back
more
to
the
region
we
re
good
friends
with
malaysia
s
petronas
but
we
didn
t
really
do
things
together
now
we
have
more
collaboration
and
we
have
a
project
to
work
together
phongsthorn
thavisin
pttep
s
president
of
exploration
and
production
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
otc
asia
conference
pttep
which
has
billion
cash
on
hand
is
also
eyeing
expiring
middle
east
concessions
that
can
boost
its
output
immediately
and
plans
to
invest
in
a
project
in
myanmar
by
tapping
into
gas
from
blocks
and
to
meet
its
neighbour
s
energy
demand
phongsthorn
said
we
re
looking
to
extend
ourselves
a
little
he
said
still
ratings
agency
fitch
expects
pttep
s
reserve
profile
to
remain
weak
for
the
next
two
years
as
the
majority
of
its
assets
are
located
in
thailand
where
oil
and
gas
reservoirs
are
scattered
and
relatively
small
pttep
has
already
invested
in
percent
of
train
of
malaysia
lng
and
is
exploring
offshore
block
in
sarawak
with
petronas
phongsthorn
said
the
company
is
also
in
the
second
round
of
bidding
for
a
stake
in
another
offshore
sarawak
block
seeking
a
percent
share
he
said
last
year
petroliam
nasional
bhd
petronas
kicked
off
a
process
to
sell
a
stake
of
up
to
percent
worth
an
estimated
billion
in
the
offshore
gas
block
in
malaysia
s
sarawak
state
total
and
some
japanese
firms
are
among
others
keen
to
bid
for
the
asset
sources
have
said
pttep
also
plans
to
bid
for
thailand
s
erawan
and
bongkot
gas
concession
licences
in
an
auction
scheduled
for
april
another
chance
to
raise
its
output
and
reserves
the
government
will
announce
the
licence
winners
in
december
which
will
give
the
companies
time
to
invest
to
sustain
a
combined
gas
output
of
billion
cubic
feet
a
day
from
the
fields
before
the
concessions
expire
in
phongsthorn
said
pttep
holds
an
percent
stake
in
a
billion
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
led
by
anadarko
petroleum
in
mozambique
the
consortium
will
build
two
lng
trains
with
a
total
capacity
of
million
tonnes
per
annum
that
are
slated
for
completion
in
we
are
still
trying
to
work
out
if
ptt
could
commit
its
volume
from
mozambique
either
for
thailand
or
trading
phongsthorn
said
the
lng
market
in
the
next
few
years
could
see
more
demand
and
supply
could
shrink
a
little
everyone
stopped
investing
for
some
time
and
our
industry
needs
time
to
develop
assets
i
think
in
the
future
you
ll
see
short
supply
he
said
pttep
is
also
exploring
solar
power
and
batteries
technologies
for
new
revenue
stream
as
it
adapts
itself
to
a
new
environment
phongsthorn
said
falling
costs
for
solar
panels
have
made
them
a
viable
electricity
source
and
oil
companies
expect
electric
vehicles
to
reduce
oil
demand
