world
shares
fell
on
wednesday
and
the
dollar
eased
off
highs
as
markets
awaited
a
likely
increase
in
interest
rates
and
guidance
on
how
many
more
to
expect
for
this
year
markets
were
also
spooked
by
signs
of
a
brewing
global
trade
war
a
wall
street
journal
report
saying
china
was
planning
against
trade
tariffs
european
shares
fell
and
investors
scurried
for
the
safety
of
german
government
bonds
and
the
japanese
yen
and
equity
futures
indicated
that
stocks
which
have
been
roiled
by
a
hefty
selloff
in
technology
shares
this
week
are
set
for
another
weak
session
the
selloff
wiped
some
billion
off
the
value
of
social
media
giant
facebook
leaving
investors
on
edge
as
the
federal
reserve
prepares
to
raise
rates
for
the
first
time
this
year
the
facebook
losses
caused
by
uproar
over
the
alleged
misuse
of
user
data
have
filtered
through
the
tech
sector
with
shares
in
twitter
falling
more
than
percent
on
tuesday
a
equity
index
fell
almost
percent
its
early
weakness
accelerating
after
the
wsj
report
on
china
and
a
tech
shares
index
reversing
an
early
bounce
the
yen
typically
bought
during
times
of
stress
rose
to
the
day
s
high
versus
the
dollar
around
so
far
we
have
seen
trade
skirmishes
which
are
not
material
enough
to
affect
the
world
economy
but
if
we
see
retaliation
and
significant
trade
disruptions
it
s
a
different
order
or
magnitude
could
begin
to
affect
global
growth
forecasts
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
the
tech
selloff
is
a
serious
setback
to
markets
just
as
they
recover
from
an
selloff
milligan
said
noting
tech
had
been
the
leading
light
of
and
asian
equity
markets
for
over
a
msci
s
equity
index
flatlined
and
is
now
percent
off
january
s
record
highs
pressured
by
the
trade
war
fears
and
the
possibility
that
the
fed
will
tighten
policy
more
than
expected
the
central
bank
has
raised
borrowing
costs
five
times
since
late
markets
are
pricing
in
three
rate
increases
this
year
but
some
reckon
policymakers
might
squeeze
in
a
fourth
triggering
a
bond
and
equity
selloff
the
gmt
announcement
will
also
be
the
first
under
new
fed
chair
jerome
powell
we
might
have
significant
changes
in
communication
compared
with
what
we
ve
seen
under
previous
chair
janet
yellen
said
chris
scicluna
head
of
economic
research
at
daiwa
capital
markets
the
economic
situation
cuts
also
justifies
a
significant
shift
upwards
in
the
dot
plot
he
added
referring
to
fears
the
fed
s
de
facto
policy
forecast
chart
will
signal
four
rate
rises
rather
than
three
because
of
the
effects
of
tax
reforms
those
expectations
had
sent
the
dollar
to
nearly
highs
on
tuesday
but
it
eased
back
a
quarter
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
on
wednesday
having
lost
almost
half
a
percent
this
month
the
dollar
s
weakness
it
fell
percent
last
year
is
at
least
partly
down
to
capital
seeking
to
invest
overseas
amid
robust
world
growth
milligan
said
that
would
continue
unless
trade
skirmishes
started
hurting
the
world
economy
or
growth
accelerated
further
to
get
the
dollar
higher
we
will
need
a
combination
of
the
fed
being
more
aggressive
and
signalling
more
changes
for
he
said
the
wsj
report
on
potential
chinese
tariffs
comes
as
president
donald
trump
prepares
to
announce
on
friday
up
to
billion
in
import
duties
on
chinese
goods
he
imposed
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminium
earlier
this
month
this
week

meeting
of
finance
ministers
and
central
banks
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
failed
to
diffuse
tensions
with
the
said
only
it
recognised
the
need
for
more
dialogue
and
actions
the
currencies
of
nations
such
as
the
australian
new

and
canadian
dollars
and
most
emerging
currencies
fell
the
aussie
traded
near
troughs
against
the
dollar
of
and
the
kiwi
hit
its
lowest
since
early
january
the
canadian
dollar
held
at
after
dropping
to
on
monday
its
weakest
since
the
mexican
peso
was
up
almost
percent
against
the
dollar
after
reports
the
united
states
had
dropped
a
demand
that
vehicles
imported
from
canada
and
mexico
should
contain

fears
of
a
trade
war
have
also
weighed
on
commodity
prices

tensions
in
the
middle
east
supported

half
a
percent
copper
prices
in
shanghai
fell
to
their
lowest
in
almost
six
month
their
fourth
