oil
hit
a
high
on
wednesday
closing
in
on
a
peak
set
in
late
january
on
a
surprise
decline
in
inventories
strong
compliance
on
opec
production
cuts
and
persistent
concern
related
to
the
iran
nuclear
deal
brent
crude

rose

a

west

intermediate
wti
crude
futures
gained
or
percent
to
settle
at
their
highest
since
those
increases
put
both
benchmarks
into
technically
overbought
territory
for
the
first
time
since
january
and
boosted
the
premium
of
the
brent
over
wti
to
its
highest
since
the
start
of
february
data
released
by
the
energy
information
administration
eia
on
wednesday
morning
showed
a
surprise
million
barrel
draw
in
crude
inventories
analysts
had
expected
a
million
barrel
build
a
few
things
happened
said
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
referring
to
the
eia
data
crude
imports
dropped
by
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
that
contributed
to
the
draw
we
saw
refinery
runs
increase
more
than
expected
by
around
barrels
per
day
so
that
ate
up
a
lot
of
crude
and
exports
were
up
slightly
he
said
oil
also
got
a
boost
after
the
federal
reserve
raised
interest
rates
on
wednesday
and
forecast
at
least
two
more
hikes
for
on
the
back
end
of
the
fed
meeting
the
dollar
is
getting
under
pressure
and
that
is
going
to
work
as
a
reverse
correlation
to
crude
oil
prices
said
bob
yawger
director
of
energy
futures
at
mizuho
in
new
york
a
falling
dollar
versus
a
basket
of
other
currencies
makes
commodities
cheaper
for
holders
of
other
currencies
since
they
have
to
spend
less
to
buy
the
same
amount
of
the
commodity
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
said
on
wednesday
its
members
and
allies
achieved
record
compliance
in
february
to
their
deal
to
cut
global
supplies
lifting
the
market
meanwhile
concerns
that
the
united
states
could
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
loom
energy
consultancy
fge
said
new
sanctions
on
iran
could
result
in
a
to
bpd
drop
in
its
exports
by
compared
with
crude
exports
of
roughly
million
to
million
bpd
since
early
when
sanctions
were
lifted
even
though
you
do
see
signs
that
the
market
is
lax
on
the
physical
side
do
you
go
aggressively
bearish
when
you
have
the
potential
for
something
happening
between
the
and
iran
bearish
concerns
have
largely
been
fuelled
by
surging
crude
output
wednesday
s
eia
data
in
addition
to
showing
inventory
draws
also
showed
that
weekly
crude
output
had
hit
an
high
so
far
the
market
is
sort
of
ignoring
the
increase
in
production
said
ritterbusch
we
now
have
production
above
million
bpd
and
it
s
going
to
keep
rising
and
the
market
is
eventually
going
to
have
to
reckon
with
that
