russia
s
state
oil
company
rosneft
and
italy
s
eni
did
not
make
a
commercial
oil
discovery
in
the
black
sea
as
the
well
they
were
drilling
proved
to
be
dry
a
source
close
to
the
operations
told
reuters
on
wednesday
rosneft
chief
executive
igor
sechin
has
partnered
with
a
number
of
foreign
companies
to
develop
russia
s
offshore
regions
though
western
sanctions
have
forced
some
of
its
partners
such
as
exxonmobil
to
suspend
projects
sechin
has
counted
on
the
black
sea
as
an
area
with
high
potential
and
any
discovery
would
help
send
a
message
that
the
sanctions
will
not
seriously
hamper
rosneft
s
global
standing
or
cooperation
with
other
global
players
but
the
well
which
rosneft
and
eni
started
to
drill
in
december
did
not
bring
the
desired
results
a
source
close
to
operations
said
rosneft
had
planned
a
second
well
if
the
first
showed
hydrocarbon
potential
there
will
be
nothing
nothing
was
found
the
source
familiar
with
the
operation
said
demobilisation
of
equipment
has
eni
which
holds
a
percent
stake
in
the
project
declined
to
comment
in
the
black
sea
rosneft
faces
a
technically
challenging
project
not
a
single
well
has
been
drilled
in
the
deep
water
russian
offshore
in
the
black
sea
sechin
said
back
in
december
the
prospecting
and
appraisal
well
was
drilled
using
the
rig
and
rosneft
said
this
week
it
had
a
target
depth
of
metres
contrary
to
previous
statements
when
rosneft
has
discovered
oil
on
wednesday
the
company
confirmed
that
drilling
was
complete
and
referred
only
to
finding
a
carbonate
structure
as
a
result
of
the
work
a
unique
carbonate
structure
was
discovered
which
is
a
fractured
reservoir
that
is
highly
likely
to
contain
hydrocarbons
rosneft
said
without
giving
details
of
how
much
or
what
type
of
hydrocarbons
the
structure
may
contain
the
obtained
results
inspire
confidence
in
the
discovery
of
large
oil
and
gas
deposits
in
the
russian
area
of
the
black
sea
rosneft
said
adding
that
it
will
now
carefully
study
the
material
received
by
the
drilling
the
wording
contrasts
with
rosneft
s
statement
following
the
completion
of
drilling
on
the
first
well
in
its
kara
sea
project
in
september
back
then
rosneft
reported
it
found
oil
and
sechin
took
a
group
of
reporters
and
tv
crews
to
the
kara
sea
valery
nesterov
an
analyst
with
sberbank
cib
said
that
given
there
was
no
information
about
any
oil
flow
from
the
well
rosneft
may
need
additional
drilling
the
issue
of
carbonate
structures
is
a
high
oil
movement
inside
a
layer
nesterov
said
the
high
movement
means
that
oil
can
migrate
from
one
part
of
the
structure
to
another
and
can
be
hard
to
track
if
at
all
according
to
thomsonreuters
tracking
data
the
rig
started
to
move
to
the
romanian
port
of
constanta
on
march
and
is
expected
to
arrive
there
on
march
eni
in
contrast
to
its
global
peers
does
not
yet
have
any
oil
producing
projects
in
russia
and
has
teamed
up
with
rosneft
in
the
black
sea
and
the
barents
sea
in
russia
s
arctic
nesterov
said
that
it
was
important
to
note
that
eni
has
not
pulled
out
of
the
partnership
with
rosneft
despite
what
he
described
as
not
very
active
cooperation
eni
does
not
announce
the
exit
and
this
is
positive
he
said
rosneft
said
last
december
that
oil
resources
in
the
licence
area
in
the
black
sea
were
estimated
at
over
million
tonnes
or
equal
to
more
than
two
years
of
rosneft
s
current
oil
production
the
partnership
has
yet
to
begin
drilling
in
the
barents
sea
