pgrading
s
biggest
ports
to
cope
with
the
effects
of
climate
change
will
cost
up
to
billion
but
the
bill
could
be
even
higher
if
no
action
is
taken
researchers

asia
research
and
engagement
are
analysed
the
risks
to
of
the
region
s
largest
ports
and
estimated
costs
for
them
to
adapt
to
rising
sea
levels
and
storm
surges

at
are
predicted
increasing
damage
to
ports
from
storms
and
related
stoppages
in
operations
if
measures
are
not
taken
to
prepare
for
global
warming
impacts
including
more
extreme
weather
that
kind
of
disruption
would
grow
and
continue

report
commissioned
by
international
bank
hsbc
covered
ports
in
japan
china
hong
kong
taiwan
singapore
australia
india
south
korea
and
malaysia
it
put
the
costs
for
those
ports
to
adapt
to
climate
change
at
between
billion
and
billion
japan
s
kitakyushu
port
faces
the
highest
cost
at
billion
the
report
said
while
five
of
the
region
s
largest
ports
by
capacity
could
see
bills
of
more
than
billion
each
indonesia
s
cilacap
could
take
steps
to
deal
with
climate
change
most
cheaply
at
million
the
report
said
it
is
more
expensive
to
fix
up
ports
with
large
areas
covered
by
warehouses
than
those
made
up
mainly
of
yards
which
can
be
elevated
relatively
easily
using
concrete
said
mccarron
port
owners
should
factor
the
report
s
findings
into
their
plans
and
upgrades
while
banks
insurance
companies
and
other
investors
should
question
port
operators
about
the
resilience
of
their
assets
he
added
incorporating
climate
protection
at
the
design
stage
is
cheaper
than
doing
so
once
a
port
is
built
mccarron
said
the
report
also
urged
financial
backers
of
new
infrastructure
like
china
s
belt
and
road
initiative
to
ensure
they
include
climate
projections
in
construction
plans
to
avoid
higher
costs
in
the
future
this
report
is
designed
to
start
conversations
amongst
those
who
use
and
finance
in
asia
by
asking
the
dollar
question
are
you
ready
for
climate
