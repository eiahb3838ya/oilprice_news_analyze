chief

anuar
taib
said
on
wednesday
petronas
like
other
oil
majors
was
hit
by
the
plunge
in
oil
prices
from
highs
but
sharp
cost
cuts
since
then
and
a
modest
price
recovery
that
began
last
year
has
helped
the
firm
boost
profits
so
it
can
spend
more
petronas
allocated
billion
ringgit
billion
for
upstream
expenditure
in
anuar
said
adding
this
was
slightly
more
than
although
he
did
not
give
a
precise
comparison
this
is
still
little
more
than
half
the
billion
ringgit
spent
on
upstream
activities
in
we
want
the
capital
discipline
the
challenge
we
have
seen
in
the
past
is
that
when
everybody
starts
going
for
activities
at
the
same
time
then
the
whole
supply
chain
is
stretched
that
adds
to
the
costs
anuar
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
otc
asia

he
said
petronas
would
drill
