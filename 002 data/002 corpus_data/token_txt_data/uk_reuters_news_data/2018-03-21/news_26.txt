participants
awaited
a
likely
increase
in
interest
rates
and
guidance
on
how
many
more
to
expect
for
this
year
investors
were
also
spooked
by
signs
of
a
brewing
global
trade
war
after
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
china
was
planning
against
trade
tariffs
european

and
investors
scurried
for
the

stocks
which
were
roiled
by
a
hefty
selloff
in

some
billion
off
the
value
of

giant
facebook
that
has
left
investors
on
edge
as
the
federal
reserve
prepares
to
raise

for
the
first
time
this
year
after
a
policy
meeting
the
facebook

caused
by

almost
percent
its
early
weakness
accelerating
after
the
wsj
report
on

a

index
reversing
an
early
bounce
the
yen
typically
bought
during
times
of
stress
rose
to
the
day
s
high
versus
the
dollar
around
so
far
we
have
seen
trade
skirmishes
which
are
not
material
enough
to
affect
the
world
economy
but
if
we
see
retaliation
and
significant
trade
disruptions
it
s
a
different
order
or
magnitude
could
begin
to
affect
global
growth

said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
the
tech
selloff
was
a
serious
setback
to
markets
just
as
they
recovered
from
an
selloff
milligan
said
noting
tech
had
been
the
leading
light
of

pressured
by
the
trade
war
fears
and
the
possibility
that
the
fed
will
tighten
policy
more
than
expected
emerging
market
stocks
lost
percent
the
central
bank
has
raised
borrowing
costs
five
times
since
late

some
worry
policymakers
