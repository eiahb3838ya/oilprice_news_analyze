iran
has
sharply
reduced
its
gasoline
imports
in
recent
weeks
after
starting
up
a
new
refinery
trade
sources
said
bringing
the
country
closer
to
its
goal
of
fuel
the
reduced
dependence
on
imports
comes
as
the
future
of
a
landmark
nuclear
accord
that
offered
iran
sanctions
relief
hangs
in
the
balance
with
president
donald
trump
threatening
to
pull
out
of
the
deal
iran
despite
being
opec
s
crude
oil
producer
has
for
years
struggled
to
meet
its
domestic
fuel
needs
due
to
a
lack
of
refining
capacity
and
international
sanctions
that
limited
the
supply
of
spare
parts
for
plant
maintenance
president
hassan
rouhani
has
made
fuel
independence
a
key
objective
following
the
removal
of
many
such
trade
restrictions
which
led
to
a
sharp
recovery
in
iran
s
economy
that
goal
moved
closer
after
iran
s
national
oil
company
in
recent
weeks
started
the
second
phase
of
the
persian
gulf
star
refinery
at
bandar
abbas
which
converts
light
crude
known
as
condensate
into
gasoline
and
naphtha
officials
at
the
refinery
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
the
new
phase
will
double
the
refinery
s
capacity
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
production
has
still
to
be
ramped
up
fully
and
it
might
not
yet
meet
its
highest
specifications
known
as
euro
iv
trading
sources
said
iran
does
seem
to
have
significantly
reduced
