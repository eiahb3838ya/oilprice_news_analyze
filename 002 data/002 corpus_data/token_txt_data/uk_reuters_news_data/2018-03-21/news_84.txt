bhge
is
on
the
hunt
for
smaller
oil
and
gas
projects
in
asia
pacific
to
replicate
a
project
in
papua
new
guinea
where
it
is
providing
services
and
financing
a
senior
company
executive
said
the
company
formed
from
the
merger
of
ge
s
oil
and
gas
services
and
equipment
business
and
baker
hughes
is
seeing
signs
of
renewed
interest
in
oil
and
gas
projects
in
the
region
driven
by
smaller
firms
president
visal
leng
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
otc
asia
conference
bhge
offers
resource
assessment
through
to
drilling
and
production
it
wants
to
work
with
smaller
companies
looking
to
develop
smaller
fields
and
stranded
resources
in
countries
such
as
indonesia
philippines
malaysia
and
myanmar
where
there
is
also
demand
for
natural
gas
to
generate
electricity
the
move
to
tackle
such
projects
comes
in
the
wake
of
the
oil
price
crash
which
devastated
the
region
s
oilfield
services
sector
after
producers
sharply
cut
back
spending
on
oil
and
gas
exploration
we
re
cautiously
optimistic
on
the
region
because
projects
are
slowly
coming
back
we
also
see
some
smaller
projects
in
size
not
by
nocs
national
oil
companies
or
iocs
international
oil
companies
but
by
smaller
operators
leng
said
bhge
is
currently
working
with
private
australian
company
twinza
oil
which
is
developing
the
first
offshore
field
for
papua
new
guinea
providing
fullstream
services
from
assessing
reserves
to
drilling
and
building
the
gas
processing
plant
we
have
taken
more
risks
in
development
we
have
put
some
skin
in
the
game
with
some
financing
