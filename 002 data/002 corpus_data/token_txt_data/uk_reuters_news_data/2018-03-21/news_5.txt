concerns
over
further
trade
tariffs
and
a
widely
expected
interest
rate
hike
by
the
federal
reserve
left
world
stocks
flat
after
a
choppy
session
wednesday
as
investors
tried
to
balance
out
the
effects
of
low
inflation
and
higher
trading
costs
on
the
global
economy
stocks
had
initially
rallied
and
pushed
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
up
more
than
points
after
the
fed
raised
benchmark
interest
rates
by
percentage
point
as
expected
at
the
conclusion
of
a
policy
meeting
and
said
growth
in
the
economy
continues
to
look
strong
the
fed
s
measures
of
inflation
were
little
changed
helping
reassure
investors
that
the
central
bank
may
not
raise
rates
more
than
three
times
this
year
but
stock
prices
began
to
come
under
selling
pressure
after
fed
chair
jerome
powell
said
in
a
later
press
conference
that
some
participants
in
the
federal
open
market
committee
said
they
had
heard
concerns
about
the
effect
of
future
trade
tariffs
on
global
growth
a
number
of
participants
in
the
committee
did
bring
up
the
issue
of
tariffs
powell
said
if
i
could
summarize
what
came
out
of
it
was
first
there
s
no
thought
that
changes
in
trade
policy
should
have
any
effect
on
the
current
however
a
number
of
participants
reported
that
about
their
conversations
with
business
leaders
around
the
country
and
reported
that
trade
policy
has
come
a
concern
going
forward
for
that
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
fell
points
or
percent
to
close
at
the
s
p
lost
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
dropped
points
or
percent
to
the
dollar
index
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
shed
percent
so
far
we
have
seen
trade
skirmishes
which
are
not
material
enough
to
affect
the
world
economy
but
if
we
see
retaliation
and
significant
trade
disruptions
it
s
a
different
order
of
magnitude
which
could
begin
to
affect
global
growth
