minister
claire
perry
said
it
had
yet
to
be
formally
agreed
with

lawmakers
but
the

wanted
to
provide
certainty
for
companies
covered
by

at

the
end
of
phase
three
she
was
speaking
to
members
of
the
eu
energy
and
environment
in
the
upper
house
of
parliament
britain
is
the
emitter
of
greenhouse
gases
in
europe
and
as
a
result
its
utilities
and
industry
are
among
the
largest
buyers
of
permits
in
ets
which
charges
power
plants
and
factories
for
every
ton
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
companies
from
these
sectors
have
urged
britain
to
stay
in
the
scheme
until
the
end
of
the
current
trading
phase
to
avoid
disruption
but
are
divided
over
britain
s
longer
term
participation
in
the
scheme
perry
said
britain
is
committed
to
using
a
price
on
carbon
as
a
means
to
reduce
emissions
but
would
use
the
country
s
exit
from
the
european
union
to
take
the
opportunity
to
see
if
there
are
other
opportunities
to
achieve
this
rules
of
the
ets
are
set
by
the
european
parliament
and
enforced
by
the
european
court
of
justice
and
industry
experts
have
said
it
could
be
politically
difficult
to
justify
staying
within
the
scheme
britain
has
a
legally
binding
target
to
cut
emissions
of
harmful
greenhouse
gases
such
as
those
produced
by
