a
hush
settled
over
financial
markets
on
wednesday
as
investors
anticipated
a
quarter
point
hike
in
the
federal
reserve
s
policy
rate
and
awaited
guidance
on
how

the

a

jonathan
sheridan
analyst
at
fiig
securities
in
sydney
said
the
concerns
here
are
that
the
fed
overshoots
with
raising
rates
into
a
faltering
economy
sheridan
added
if
this
opinion
takes
hold
then
we
may
well
see
falling
longer
term
rates
and
a
flatter
yield
curve
and
it
would
also
be
negative
for
equities
as
it
increases
the
chances
of
a
the
fed
has
raised
rates
five
times
since
it
began
tightening
policy
in
late
yet
the
dollar
has
not
really
responded
ending
down
about
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
we
remind
readers
that
every
single
fomc
rate
hike
this
cycle
has
been
a
dovish
hike

post
the

richard
grace
chief
currency
strategist
at
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
wrote
in
a
note
to
clients
on
wednesday
the
dollar
index
held
near
highs
around
at
against
the
japanese
yen
the
greenback
hovered
near
a
top
at
another
major
overhang
for
financial
markets
is
the
spectre
of
a
global
trade
war
president
donald
trump
is
expected
to
unveil
up
to
billion
in
import
duties
on
chinese
goods
by
friday
the
move
comes
after
trump
imposed
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminium
earlier
this
month
investors
are
worried
trump
s
actions
could
escalate
into
a
trade
war
if
china
and
other
countries
retaliate
with
similar
or
harsher
measures
threatening
global
growth
to
add
to
these
concerns
a
meeting
of
finance
ministers
and
central
banks
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
this
week
failed
to
diffuse
the
threat
the
agreed
only
to
stand
by
an
ambiguous
declaration
on
trade
from
and
recognised
the
need
for
more
dialogue
and
actions
the
currencies
of
nations
such
as
the
australian
new
zealand
and
canadian
dollars
were
on
the
defensive
after
being
knocked
down
to
lows
the
aussie
fell
to
a
trough
of
overnight
while
the
kiwi
dollar
hit
the
lowest
since
early
january
the
canadian
dollar
held
at

monday

a
level
not
seen
since
equity
analysts
have
also
turned
increasingly
downbeat
cracks
in
the

starting

emerge

top
of
the
list
of
tail
risks
most
commonly
cited
by
investors
followed
by
inflation
and
a
slowdown
in
global
growth
he
added
investors
have
yet
to
act
on
these
fears
however
as
rates
and
earnings
are
keeping
the
bulls
among
major
commodities
oil
