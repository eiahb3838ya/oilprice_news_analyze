eu
lawmakers
backed
draft
rules
on
wednesday
to
extend
the
bloc
s
internal
energy
market
laws
to
offshore
gas
pipelines
such
as
russia
s
planned
nord
stream
link
to
germany
lawmakers
on
the
european
parliament
s
industry
committee
voted
votes
to
in
favour
of
the
european
commission
s
proposal
with
abstentions
the
vote
puts
pressure
on
eu
governments
to
also
decide
on
a
proposal
on
which
they
have
so
far
failed
to
agree
the
commission
s
proposal
is
supported
by
east
european
and
baltic
countries
which
fear
the
km
mile
pipeline
will
undercut
eu
efforts
to
reduce
dependence
on
moscow
and
eu
support
for
ukraine
by
depriving
it
of
gas
transit
fees
the
pipeline
s
backers
including
germany
oppose
the
rule
change
as
an
attempt
to
block
what
they
see
as
a
commercial
project
to
pump
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
per
year
under
the
baltic
sea
in
its
current
form
the
nord
stream
project
fully
owned
by
russia
s
gas
export
monopoly
gazprom
does
not
comply
with
the
eu
s
third
energy
package
rules
it
s
too
difficult
to
find
a
compromise
one
eu
diplomat
said
of
the
last
round
of
talks
among
eu
nations
last
week
it
s
likely
it
won
t
go
an
eu
legal
opinion
this
month
rejecting
the
proposal
by
the
eu
executive
has
fuelled
such
doubts
jerzy
buzek
a
polish
member
of
the
european
parliament
who
steered
the
file
through
the
chamber
argued
the
rule
change
would
create
greater
investment
predictability
and
improve
competition
far
too
often
gas
supply
has
been
used
as
a
political
weapon
buzek
said
in
a
statement
we
can
not
disarm
the
impure
intentions
of
others
but
we
can
arm
ourselves
with
full
legal
clarity
and
consistency
of
existing
the
commission
last
year
proposed
the
changes
to
its
gas
directive
to
make
all
import
pipelines
subject
to
rules
that
require
they
not
be
owned
directly
by
gas
suppliers
apply
tariffs
and
make
capacity
available
to
third
parties
eu
officials
say
negotiations
with
moscow
may
be
needed
over
the
pipeline
which
begins
outside
eu
jurisdiction
on
russia
s
shores
the
draft
endorsed
by
parliament
calls
for
european
union
economic
sanctions
against
third
countries
to
be
taken
into
account
and
any
exemption
for
pipelines
to
be
limited
to
five
years
and
decided
