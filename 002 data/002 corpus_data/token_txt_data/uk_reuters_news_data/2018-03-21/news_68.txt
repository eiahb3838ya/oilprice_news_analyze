bangkok
reuters
asia
is
a
critical
battlefield
in
the
global
fight
to
rein
in
air
pollution
registering
about
million
premature
deaths
each
year
delegates
at
a
united
nations
conference
said
on
wednesday
as
urged
tougher
enforcement
of
curbs
the
world
health
organization
who
calls
air
pollution
the
greatest
environmental
risk
to
human
health
about
percent
of
related
deaths
take
place
in
and
countries
most
of
them
in
southeast
asia
and
the
pacific
there
is
a
sense
that
if
you
re
developing
economically
it
doesn
t
mean
that
you
have
to
live
in
a
city
where
you
can
t
breathe
the
air
dechen
tsering
the
director
of
the
environment
program
said
at
the
event
there
is
also
a
growing
sense
that
there
are
technologies
there
is
financing
to
help
said
tsering
adding
that
the
region
was
a
key
battleground
in
the
fight
air
pollution
grew
more
than
percent
between
and
in
more
than
of
southeast
asian
cities
the
who
said
in
a
report
in
children
are
uniquely
vulnerable
said
karin
hulshof
east
asia
and
pacific
director
for
the
children
s
agency
unicef
adding
that
about
million
children
worldwide
live
in
areas
where
the
air
is
toxic
what
we
are
seeing
more
and
more
in
cities
like
ulanbataar
is
hospitals
full
of
children
suffering
from
diseases
related
to
air
pollution
said
hulshof
referring
to
a
public
health
crisis
in
mongolia
s
capital
caused
by
toxic
smog
emissions
limits
are
simply
not
being
enforced
in
asia
however
said
andreas
kock
managing
director
at
scheuch
asia
which
develops
and
produces
environmental
cleaning
technologies
basically
they
are
not
investing
because
the
pressure
is
not
there
said
kock
who
called
for
efforts
to
spur
industries
in
asia
to
adopt
technology
major
cities
such
as
bangkok
need
to
build
comprehensive
public
transport
networks
and
push
citizens
to
use
them
tsering
said
as
well
as
vehicles
like
bicycles
that
is
the
aim
of
mobike
a
smartphone
application
that
allows
people
to
find
bicycles
and
unlock
them
by
scanning
a
qr
code
in
bangkok
we
operate
in
two
locations
and
we
hope
to
expand
in
a
few
months
