london
reuters
royal
dutch
shell
is
placing
a
big
bet
on
petrol
stations
and
convenience
stores
in
china
india
and
mexico
as
it
looks
to
shore
up
profits
during
the
electric
car
revolution
by
the
oil
and
gas
giant
plans
to
grow
its
global
network
of
roadside
stations
by
nearly
a
quarter
to
targeting
million
daily
customers
shell
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
it
will
add
another
convenience
stores
selling
coffee
and
snacks
with
growth
focused
on
rapidly
growing
economies
in
emerging
markets
shell
as
well
as
rivals
such
as
bp
sees
retail
as
a
way
to
secure
demand
for
the
fuels
it
refines
as
consumption
could
peak
as
early
as
by
the
end
of
the
next
decade
due
to
the
growth
in
electric
vehicles
already
in
marketing
accounted
for
around
a
quarter
of
shell
s
earnings
we
plan
to
be
leading
through
the
energy
transition
shell
head
of
downstream
john
abbott
said
in
an
investor
presentation
on
wednesday
already
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
retailers
with
a
well
known
brand
shell
expects
earning
from
its
marketing
and
commercial
businesses
to
grow
annually
by
percent
into
when
it
will
deliver
billion
in
earnings
around
half
of
the
new
petrol
stations
will
be
built
in
fast
growing
economies
mostly
in
china
india
indonesia
russia
and
mexico
where
shell
s
market
share
is
smaller
compared
to
local
companies
istvan
kapitany
shell
s
head
of
retail
said
these
markets
will
produce
half
of
the
oil
demand
growth
by
kapitany
said
the
company
is
also
rolling
out
a
number
of
experimental
initiatives
to
introduce
electric
battery
chargers
and
hydrogen
chargers
to
its
traditional
petrol
stations
hoping
to
capture
some
of
the
growth
in
the
engines
the
fuel
marketing
sector
nevertheless
faces
a
risk
of
overcrowding
as
many
companies
see
growth
potential
there
warned
biraj
borkhataria
analyst
at
rbc
capital
markets
we
are
more
sceptical
on
shell
s
plans
in
retail
as
the
market
is
fiercely
competitive
and
the
ongoing
threat
of
evs
electric
vehicles
could
put
some
of
that
earnings
stream

the
company
said
its
downstream
business
which
includes
refining
trading
marketing
and
chemicals
will
generate
billion
in
organic
free
cash
flow
per
year
by
based
on
a
brent
crude

price
of
a

free

generation
for
the
whole
company
is
expected
to
reach

downstream
proved
its
importance
during
the
oil
industry
s
downturn
since
providing
the
bulk
of
shell
s
profits
as
the
price
of
crude
collapsed
shell
has
in
recent
years
transformed
its
downstream
business
by
selling
some
plants
and
upgrading
others
helping
the
company
ride
out
oil
price
fluctuations
and
shifts
in
demand
the
company
is
also
bracing
for
a
world
of
lower
for
longer
oil
prices
due
to
rising
oil
supplies
particularly
from
the
united
states
shell
and
others
cut
tens
of
thousands
of
jobs
lowered
spending
and
brought
in
new
technology
to
simplify
field

and
operations
shell
also
said
it
plans
to
invest
billion
