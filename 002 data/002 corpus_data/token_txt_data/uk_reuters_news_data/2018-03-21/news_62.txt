banks
revenues
exceeded
their
earnings
from
the
oil
sector
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
as
low
and
relatively
stable
crude
prices
discouraged

activity
but
this
is
unlikely
to
be
the
start
of
a
new
trend
banks
commodity
revenue
has
been
on
a
steady
downward
path
in
recent
years
as
they
have
exited
or
slimmed
down
their
commodity
businesses
due
to
heightened
government
regulation
and
a
poor
performance
from
the
sector
the
world
s
biggest
investment
banks
made
revenue
of
billion
from
trading
selling
derivatives
and
other
activities
in
metals
last
year
compared
to
billion
in
oil
according
to
coalition
a
financial
industry
analytics
firm
that
is
the
lowest
for
both
in
at
least
a
decade
and
down
from
billion
for

for

revenue
has
dwindled
since
as
a
period
of
low
prices
reduced
interest
from
producers
and
consumers
in
financial
instruments
that
offer
protection
against
price
volatility
said
amrit
shahani
research
director
at
coalition
it
s
much
more
oil
declining
than
metals
gaining
he
said
we
ve
seen
reduced
client
activity
in
oil
reduced
hedging
from
the
corporates
as
well
as
low
prices
at
the
start
of
last
year
and
low
metals
income
held
up
better
thanks
to
stable
revenues
from
storing
gold
and
silver
and
a
surge
in
industrial
metals
prices
since
early
and
because
fewer
banks
have
left
the
precious
metals
business
than
have
quit
oil
markets
shahani
said
pretty
much
every
bank
maintains
a
precious
metals
business
it
s
a
much
more
stable
revenue
banks
revenue
from
both
metals
and
oil
is
expected
to
increase
this
year
as
prices
and
volatility
increase
shahani
said
with
overall
revenue
seen
rising
by
around
percent
part
of
this
is
likely
to
come
from
goldman
sachs
traditionally
one
of
the
top
three
commodities
banks
which
is
trying
to
turn
around
its
commodities
unit
after
revenues
collapsed
last
year
earnings
will
likely
rebound
faster
than
metals
over
the
next
few
years
as
banks
focus
on
building
revenues
in
the
oil
derivatives
market
which
is
historically
a
much
bigger
business
than
metals
derivatives
