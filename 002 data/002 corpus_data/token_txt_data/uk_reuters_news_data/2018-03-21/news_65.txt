world
shares
were
flat
on
wednesday
and
the
dollar
eased
off
highs
as
investors
marked
time
before
a
likely
hike
in
interest
rates
and
awaited
guidance
on
how
many
more
to
expect
for
this
year
markets
are
on
edge
not
only
because
of
the
federal
reserve
meeting
which
should
deliver
the
first
rate
rise
of
but
also
because
of
a
selloff
in
tech
shares
which
has
wiped
almost
billion
off
the
value
of
facebook
this
week
amid
uproar
over
the
alleged
misuse
of
users
data
the
facebook
losses
have
filtered
through
other
tech
shares
in
the
united
states
and
overseas
with
shares
in
twitter
falling
more
than
percent
on
tuesday
the
losses
are
likely
to
have
hit
investors
hard
with

merrill
lynch
s
monthly
survey
showing
global
funds
heavily
positioned
in
tech
shares
just
before
the
rout
began
there
are
tensions
between
potential
bad
news
and
good
news
in
the
market
the
bad
news
is
the
problem
facing
the
tech
sector
which
has
been
the
leading
light
of
and
asian
equity
markets
for
over
a
year
said
andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
the
good
news
is
we
must
recall
why
the
fed
is
tightening
policy
it
s
because
of
the
underlying
strength
of
the
and
global
msci
s
equity
index
flatlined
and
is
now
percent
off
record
highs
hit
at
the
end
of
january
pressured
by
fears
of
a
global
trade
war
ignited
by
president
donald
trump
and
the
possibility
that
the
fed
could
end
up
raising
interest
rates
more
than
three
times
this
year
the
fed
has
increased
borrowing
costs
five
times
since
it
began
tightening
policy
in
late
markets
are
pricing
in
three
rises
this
year
but
some
reckon
policymakers
could
squeeze
in
a
fourth
which
might
trigger
a
bond
and
equity
selloff
the
gmt
announcement
will
also
be
the
first
under
new
fed
chair
jerome
powell
analysts
note
we
might
have
significant
changes
in
communication
compared
with
what
we
ve
seen
under
previous
chair
janet
yellen
said
chris
scicluna
head
of
economic
research
at
daiwa
capital
markets
the
economic
situation
post
tax
cuts
also
justifies
a
significant
shift
upwards
in
the
dot
plot
he
added
referring
to
fears
the
fed
s
de
facto
policy
forecast
chart
could
signal
four
rate
rises
rather
than
three
due
to
the
economic
boost
delivered
by
trump
s
tax
reforms
those
expectations
had
sent
the
dollar
to
nearly
highs
on
tuesday
but
it
eased
back
a
quarter
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
on
wednesday
having
lost
almost
half
a
percent
this
month
the
greenback
s
weakness
it
fell
percent
last
year
is
at
least
partly
down
to
capital
seeking
to
invest
overseas
amid
robust
world
growth
milligan
said
that
would
continue
unless
trade
skirmishes
started
impacting
the
world
economy
or
growth
accelerated
further
to
get
the
dollar
higher
we
will
need
combination
of
the
fed
being
more
aggressive
and
signalling
more
changes
for
he
added
european
shares
edged
down
despite
a
small
tech
index
bounce
off
lows
and
equity
futures
signalled
that
wall
street
would
likewise
open
a
touch
lower
emerging
equities
fell
percent
a
major
overhang
for
financial
markets
is
the
spectre
of
a
global
trade
war
trump
is
expected
to
unveil
up
to
billion
in
import
duties
on
chinese
goods
by
friday
after
imposing
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminium
earlier
this
month
investors
are
worried
his
actions
could
escalate
into
a
trade
war
if
china
and
other
countries
retaliate
with
similar
or
harsher
measures
threatening
global
growth
this
week
s
meeting
of
finance
ministers
and
central
banks
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
failed
to
diffuse
tensions
with
the
bloc
saying
only
it
recognised
the
need
for
more
dialogue
and
actions
the
currencies
of
nations
such
as
the
australian
new
zealand
and
canadian
dollars
were
on
the
defensive
after
being
knocked
down
to
lows
while
most
emerging
currencies
were
also
marked
lower
the
aussie
languished
near
troughs
against
the
dollar
of
while
the
kiwi
hit
the
lowest
since
early
january
the
canadian
dollar
held
at
after
hitting
on
monday
a
low
not
seen
since
the
mexican
peso
was
up
almost
percent
against
the
dollar
after
reports
the
united
states
had
dropped
a
demand
that
vehicles
imported
from
canada
and
mexico
should
contain
percent
content
fears
of
a
trade
war
have
also
weighed
on
commodity
prices
though
tensions
in
the
middle
east
supported
oil
lifting

copper
prices
in

fell
to
