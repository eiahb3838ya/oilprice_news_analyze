compliance
with
a
global
deal
to
cut
oil
supply
hit
a
new
high
in
february
and
an
inventory
glut
is
shrinking
fast
a
joint
opec
and
committee
said
bringing
producers
close
to
the
pact
s
original
aim
opec
and
its
allies
achieved
percent
of
pledged
output
reductions
last
month
opec
said
up
from
percent
in
january
and
the
highest
since
the
deal
aimed
at
clearing
a
glut
began
in
january
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
other
producers
have
extended
the
pact
until
the
end
of
even
though
opec
sources
say
the
market
is
now
expected
to
balance
between
the
second
and
third
quarters
a
rapidly
shrinking
glut
will
fuel
debate
over
how
long
the
curbs
need
to
be
in
place
although
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
has
said
it
is
too
early
to
discuss
an
exit
strategy
a
ministerial
panel
meets
to
review
the
deal
in
april
the
committee
stressed
that
all
participating
countries
should
strive
to
achieve
or
exceed
full
conformity
with
their
voluntary
production
adjustments
the
opec
statement
said
february
continued
the
accelerated
rebalancing
path
witnessed
in
recent
the
supply
cut
s
original
aim
was
to
shrink
oil
inventories
in
developed
economies
to
their
average
stocks
in
february
were
million
barrels
above
that
level
opec
said
the
closest
the
group
has
come
to
the
target
stocks
can
now
be
considered
as
close
to
normal
levels
an
opec
source
said
the
compliance
figures
reflect
both
high
adherence
by
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
other
gulf
opec
countries
as
well
as
an
involuntary
slide
in
production
in
venezuela
whose
output
is
dropping
amid
an
economic
crisis
opec
s
deal
has
helped
boost
oil
prices
which
topped
a
barrel
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
and
were
above
on
wednesday
supported
by
a
surprise
decline
in
inventories
while
oil
stocks
are
dropping
closer
to
the
average
opec
is
talking
of
adjusting
the
metric
to
give
a
more
complete
picture
of
the
supply
cut
the
committee
which
met
at
opec
s
vienna
headquarters
on
monday
discussed
this
issue
but
made
no
conclusions
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
to
get
a
broader
picture
producers
could
look
at
a
longer
period
than
five
years
or
take
into
account
inventories
in
other
countries
floating
storage
and
oil
in
transit
opec
officials
have
said
the
committee
includes
officials
from
saudi
arabia
venezuela
and
algeria
plus
russia
