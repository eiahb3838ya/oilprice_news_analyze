update 1-chevron says it will not dispute climate science in u.s. lawsuit
san
francisco
reuters
a
chevron
attorney
said
in
court
on
wednesday
that
the
company
supports
scientific
conclusions
that
humans
are
causing
climate
change
a
response
to
a
lawsuit
that
accuses
five
major
energy
producers
of
misleading
the
public
for
years
about
their
role
in
global
warming
at
a
hearing
in
san
francisco
federal
court
chevron
attorney
theodore
boutrous
also
said
that
the
scientific
consensus
about
greenhouse
gas
emissions
did
not
fully
form
until
the
past
decade
the
cities
of
san
francisco
and
oakland
california
sued
chevron
corp
exxon
mobil
corp
conocophillips
royal
dutch
shell
plc
and
bp
plc
last
year
seeking
an
abatement
fund
to
help
the
cities
address
flooding
they
say
is
a
result
of
climate
change
the
companies
argued
in
legal
filings
on
tuesday
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
partly
because
congress
has
given
regulatory
agencies
not
the
courts
authority
over
the
production
and
emission
of
fossil
fuels
the
lawsuits
filed
by
democratic
party
politicians
are
part
of
a
larger
campaign
to
address
climate
change
in
the
courts
worldwide
there
are
almost
lawsuits
on
climate
change
in
countries
a
study
said
last
year
district
judge
william
alsup
invited
both
sides
to
the
hearing
to
describe
their
views
on
the
best
science
now
available
on
global
warming
and
rising
sea
levels
since
president
donald
trump
took
office
months
ago
domestic
climate
change
policy
has
been
turned
on
its
head
republican
trump
has
pushed
to
increase
production
of
fossil
fuels
and
said
he
was
withdrawing
the
from
the
paris
agreement
to
reduce
emissions
but
washington
has
not
disengaged
from
it
completely
in
court
on
wednesday
boutrous
said
chevron
supports
a
report
from
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
which
concluded
it
was
extremely
likely
humans
contribute
to
warming
however
boutrous
also
said
earlier
ipcc
reports
were
not
as
certain
the
judge
asked
boutrous
if
the
other
four
companies
agreed
with
his
presentation
and
boutrous
said
he
was
only
speaking
for
chevron
no
attorneys
for
the
other
four
companies
answered
questions
at
the
hearing
though
all
generally
acknowledge
the
reality
of
climate
change
i
m
going
to
ask
them
at
some
point
if
they
agree
with
everything
you
said
alsup
said
all
five
companies
argued
in
court
papers
on
tuesday
that
they
should
not
be
held
liable
for
warming
which
is
caused
by
billions
of
parties
and
complex
environmental
phenomena
occurring
worldwide
over
many
