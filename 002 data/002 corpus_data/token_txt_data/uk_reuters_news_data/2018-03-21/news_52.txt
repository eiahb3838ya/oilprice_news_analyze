china
is
likely
to
extend
an
agreement
proving
venezuela
with
favorable
loans
repayment
terms
but
will
not
lend
fresh
funds
to
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
according
to
sources
in
caracas
and
beijing
familiar
with
the
situation
during
a
decade
china
plowed
more
than
billion
into
the
opec
member
s
coffers
through
agreements
that
helped
beijing
secure
energy
supplies
for
its
economy
while
bolstering
an
ally
in
latin
america
but
the
flow
of
cash
halted
nearly
three
years
ago
when
venezuela
asked
for
a
change
of
payment
terms
when
a
fall
in
oil
prices
and
declining
crude
output
pushed
its
economy
into
a
hyperinflationary
collapse
though
unwilling
to
throw
venezuela
a
financial
lifeline
the
china
development
bank
cdb
will
likely
extend
next
month
a
grace
period
begun
in
that
allows
venezuela
to
make
only
interest
payments
on
its
loans
the
sources
said
however
china
has
ignored
several
requests
for
new
funding
given
venezuela
s
falling
oil
production
it
s
natural
for
chinese
banks
not
to
renew
loans
said
one
chinese
oil
industry
source
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
a
second
oil
industry
source
asked
if
the
conditions
would
be
tightened
cited
a
chinese
proverb
saying
china
would
not
drop
stones
on
somebody
who
has
fallen
into
a
venezuela
still
owes
china
billion
according
to
one
venezuelan
finance
industry
source
who
has
tracked
the
information
via
contacts
in
both
countries
some
billion
of
that
is
owed
under
the
billion
large
volume
long
term
fund
signed
in
a
further
billion
remains
outstanding
under
the
joint
china
venezuela
fund
via
three
tranches
of
billion
to
billion
each
according
to
the
source
china
s
policy
is
not
to
lend
new
funds
until
old
loans
have
been
paid
off
which
can
not
happen
under
the
scheme
created
in
april
because
the
outstanding
balance
does
not
change
cdb
president
zheng
zhijie
asked
by
reuters
if
the
bank
was
having
second
thoughts
about
financing
venezuela
given
its
situation
said
we
ve
done
our
assessment
of
its
political
and
economic
situation
we
re
just
monitoring
however
one
diplomatic
source
familiar
with
chinese
thinking
on
venezuela
said
china
increasingly
sees
maduro
as
similar
to
former
zimbabwe
president
robert
mugabe
who
was
pushed
out
after
years
in
power
that
dragged
his
country
into
hyperinflation
and
economic
crisis
china
would
have
no
concern
about
abandoning
maduro
as
it
did
mugabe
when
he
was
ousted
the
source
said
but
does
not
expect
china
to
take
an
active
role
in
pushing
him
out
china
looks
at
venezuela
as
another
zimbabwe
a
poor
return
on
its
investment
he
said
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
china
s
foreign
ministry
said
in
a
statement
that
bilateral
cooperation
was
proceeding
smoothly
at
present
adding
that
china
will
continue
to
carry
out
pragmatic
cooperation
with
prominent
chinese
ratings
agency
dagong
global
credit
rating
co
in
november
put
venezuela
s
sovereign
debt
on
negative
watch
in
a
scathing
review
that
warned
of
high
default
risks
on
bonds
which
are
not
linked
to
financing
arrangements
with
beijing
venezuela
lacks
the
ability
to
create
wealth
on
its
own
while
debt
repayment
sources
are
highly
fragile
thus
a
low
solvency
dagong
wrote
sanctions
levied
by
the
government
of
president
donald
trump
have
left
venezuela
unable
to
refinance
its
crippling
debt
burden
and
left
it
struggling
to
import
basic
goods
such
as
food
beijing
has
also
declined
to
renew
financing
to
state
oil
company
pdvsa
that
is
tied
to
oil
industry
investment
according
to
venezuelan
finance
industry
sources
in
contrast
to
other
loans
that
are
used
for
a
broader
range
of
expenditures
pdvsa
in
december
paid
off
a
billion
loan
that
it
received
in
but
was
unable
to
renew
it
the
loan
is
paid
off
in
cash
rather
than
in
oil
which
made
it
less
attractive
the
source
said
venezuela
has
in
recent
months
proposed
different
arrangements
under
which
china
would
put
in
new
cash
including
renewing
part
of
the
billion
large
volume
fund
according
to
venezuelan
finance
industry
sources
those
requests
have
been
ignored
the
sources
said
but
despite
china
s
discontent
halting
the
grace
period
would
have
little
practical
benefit
because
it
would
most
likely
lead
caracas
to
get
behind
on
payments
something
it
has
done
in
the
past
in
order
to
enforce
its
claims
china
would
have
to
open
a
cumbersome
commercial
dispute
and
engage
in
an
unfriendly
process
of
forcibly
collecting
on
the
loans
embarrassing
a
government
that
it
actively
supported
for
years
venezuela
as
of
last
year
had
fallen
behind
on
oil
shipments
to
china
as
well
as
russia
another
ally
that
has
been
providing
financing
