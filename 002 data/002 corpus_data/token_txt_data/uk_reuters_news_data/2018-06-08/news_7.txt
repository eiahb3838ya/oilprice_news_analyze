update 2-ukraine's sacked finance minister says no will in cabinet for gas price hike
kiev
reuters
oleksandr
danylyuk
sacked
this
week
as
ukraine
s
finance
minister
after
a
spat
with
the
prime
minister
said
on
friday
the
cabinet
lacked
the
will
to
raise
gas
prices
even
to
secure
more
foreign
aid
danylyuk
told
reuters
that
volodymyr
groysman
s
government
would
have
to
try
to
reach
a
compromise
with
the
international
monetary
fund
because
ukraine
faced
very
serious
consequences
if
the
imf
declined
to
disburse
more
aid
danylyuk
s
comments
suggest
ukraine
s
hopes
of
clinching
more
imf
aid
soon
could
be
disappointed
even
though
parliament
passed
a
law
on
thursday
to
create
a
special
court
to
try
graft
cases
a
milestone
set
out
in
the
imf
s
aid
programme
the
imf
has
backed
kiev
with
a
billion
billion
pounds
deal
since
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
plunged
ukraine
into
crisis
but
ukrainian
on
reforms
and
tackling
entrenched
corruption
has
stalled
aid
payments
since
last
year
raising
gas
prices
and
creating
an
independent
corruption
court
are
red
lines
for
the
imf
no
said
danylyuk
when
asked
whether
the
cabinet
had
the
will
to
raise
gas
prices
before
elections
next
year
but
i
did
my
best
actually
to
try
to
bring
together
these
two
opposite
positions
he
said
between
ukraine
s
refusal
to
raise
gas
tariffs
and
the
imf
s
insistence
on
a
rise
as
a
condition
of
more
funding
so
compromise
needs
to
be
found
and
that
is
where
the
government
should
work
now
it
will
not
be
easy
but
there
is
no
groysman
s
spokesman
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
earlier
on
friday
groysman
told
parliament
the
issue
of
hiking
gas
prices
was
complicated
and
very
sensitive
for
ukrainian
citizens
and
that
the
government
had
not
yet
found
an
answer
danylyuk
said
groysman
s
stance
makes
finding
a
compromise
more
difficult
lawmakers
passed
legislation
on
thursday
designed
to
court
decisions
from
political
pressure
or
bribery
in
the
republic
where
entrenched
corruption
remains
a
deterrent
to
foreign
investors
groysman
said
the
law
s
passage
showed
ukraine
s
fight
against
corruption
was
intensifying
but
the
imf
said
it
would
first
assess
whether
the
law
which
had
undergone
around
amendments
was
sufficient
look
if
ukraine
doesn
t
get
an
imf
tranche
we
will
have
very
serious
consequences
political
and
financial
consequences
danylyuk
said
not
getting
more
imf
money
would
result
in
high
inflation
and
government
spending
cuts
totalling
billion
he
said
though
he
played
down
fears
of
ukraine
overshooting
its
budget
deficit
of
percent
this
year
after
groysman
asked
parliament
to
sack
him
danylyuk
said
he
had
been
asked
to
back
political
corruption
using
state
money
to
fund
projects
of
favoured
lawmakers
asked
to
elaborate
danylyuk
said
state
money
was
given
to
lawmakers
to
buy
their
support
in
parliament
which
was
poor
practice
even
if
the
legislation
being
voted
on
benefited
the
country
they
fix
the
votes
like
this
he
said
if
it
s
for
good
reason
maybe
it
s
even
good
right
but
it
s
a
bit
odd
isn
t
it
if
it
s
for
bad
reason
it
s
actually
twice
as
bad
he
said
it
is
corrupt
