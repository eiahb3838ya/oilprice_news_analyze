oleksandr
danylyuk
who
was
sacked
as
ukraine
s
finance
minister
this
week
after
a
spat
with
the
prime
minister
said
on
friday
the
cabinet
does
not
have
the
will
to
raise
gas
prices
even
to
secure
more
foreign
aid
he
told
reuters
that
volodymyr
groysman
s
government
would
have
to
try
to
reach
a
compromise
with
the
international
monetary
fund
because
ukraine
faced
very
serious
consequences
if
the
imf
declined
to
disburse
more
aid
no
said
danylyuk
when
asked
whether
the
cabinet
had
the
will
to
raise
gas
prices
before
elections
next
year
but
i
did
my
best
actually
to
try
to
bring
together
these
two
opposite
positions
he
said
between
ukraine
s
refusal
to
raise
gas
tariffs
and
the
imf
s
insistence
on
a
rise
as
a
condition
of
more
funding
so
compromise
needs
to
be
found
and
that
is
where
the
government
should
work
now
it
will
not
be
easy
but
there
is
no
alternative
the
former
finance
minister
