washington
reuters
the
main
buyer
of
electricity
from
an
arizona
coal
plant
on
the
verge
of
closure
said
on
friday
it
will
instead
source
its
electricity
largely
from
a
solar
power
project
ignoring
an
appeal
by
the
interior
department
to
buy
more
power
from
the
plant
to
keep
it
open
the
trump
administration
has
been
waging
a
broad
effort
to
keep
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
from
retirement
arguing
that
their
closure
would
constitute
a
threat
to
national
energy
security
on
friday
the
board
of
the
central
arizona
project
cap
a
major
electricity
consumer
that
supplies
water
to
a
large
swath
of
arizona
voted
to
sign
a
agreement
to
buy
power
from
a
solar
project
and
also
agreed
to
a
power
deal
with
utility
salt
river
project
for
electricity
from
a
variety
of
sources
the
vote
came
despite
a
plea
from
the
head
of
interior
s
bureau
of
reclamation
who
last
friday
wrote
to
board
members
to
say
that
a
law
gives
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
power
to
require
the
cap
to
buy
energy
from
the
navajo
generating
station
or
ngs
a
power
plant
that
is
scheduled
to
close
in
with
the
act
in
mind
the
department
expects
to
consider
several
options
going
forward
including
the
feasibility
of
continued
use
of
power
the
letter
from
assistant
secretary
for
water
and
science
timothy
petty
said
such
a
move
would
have
delayed
the
plant
s
closure
but
cap
officials
disputed
the
assertion
that
they
were
required
to
buy
power
from
the
navajo
coal
plant
which
is
closing
due
to
competition
from
cheaper
natural
gas
and
renewable
energy
cap
is
not
required
by
law
to
buy
ngs
power
cap
seeks
a
reliable
and
diverse
power
portfolio
for
the
benefit
of
its
water
users

a

of
the

not
immediately
available

despite
the

board
s
decision
the
interior
department
said
it
will
continue
to
find
ways
to
keep
the
navajo
generation
station
open
the

of
the

is
committed
to
