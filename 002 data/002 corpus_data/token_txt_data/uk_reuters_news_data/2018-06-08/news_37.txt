one
of
the
key
features
of
oil
markets
recently
has
been
the
widening
discount
of
wti
crude
versus
brent
which
has
almost
quadrupled
since
february
to
per
barrel
its
steepest
discount
since
this
is
occurring
because
of
the
rapid
increase
in
production
from
shale
coupled
with
the
tightening
of
supplies
elsewhere
through
the
actions
of
opec
and
russia
