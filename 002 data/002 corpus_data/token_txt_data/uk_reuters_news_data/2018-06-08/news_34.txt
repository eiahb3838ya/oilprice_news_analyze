asian
shares
stepped
back
from
a
month
high
on
friday
as
risk
appetite
soured
on
bets
that
europe
s
massive
monetary
stimulus
was
nearing
an
end
compounded
by
uncertainty
over
trade
relations
ahead
of
a
key
meeting
of
global
leaders
msci

the

the

chief
economist
said
on
wednesday
a
hawkish
message
that
sent
the
euro
to
a
top
hit
emerging
markets
and
spurred
demand
for
bonds
markets
are
having
to
rediscover
how
to
price
risk
amid
reduced
central
bank
buying
and
that
adjustment
could
prove
very
hard
said
matt
king
citi
s
global
head
of
credit
strategy
another
major
reason
for
the
nerves
was
the
widening
rift
between
the
united
states
and
its
major
trade
partners
after
president
donald
trump
imposed
import
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
last
week
trump
seemed
in
no
mood
to
reconcile
when
he
tweeted
just
one
day
before
a
group
of
seven
summit
that
france
and
canada
imposed
massive
tariffs
on
their
imports
from
the
united
states
and
had
barriers
to
trade
the
summit
takes
place
on
friday
and
saturday
in
charlevoix

uncertainly
ahead
of
the
weekend
s
meeting
led
to
a
downturn
in

australia
risk

in
the

markets

appreciated
against
the
greenback
and
on
the

lower
on
wednesday
while
treasuries
gained

currencies
the
south
african
rand
brazil
s
real
and
the
mexican
peso
were
the
worst
hit
overnight
risk
appetite
also
waned
after
jobless
claims
pointed
to
a
further
tightening
in
labour
market
conditions
cementing
expectations
the
federal

will
raise
benchmark
rates
next
week
and
twice
again
later
in
the
year
investors
also
looked
to
a
historic
summit
in
singapore
on
june
where
the
main
issue
is
whether
north
korea
will
abandon
its
nuclear
weapons
programme

up
a
bit
from
