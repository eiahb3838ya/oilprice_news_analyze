reuters
approximately
homes
have
been
swallowed
by
lava
flows
from
kilauea
volcano
on
hawaii
s
big
island
since
early
last
month
marking
its
most
destructive
eruption
in
modern
times
hawaii
county
mayor
harry
kim
said
on
thursday
the
latest
estimate
of
property
losses
from
kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
far
surpasses
the
structures
consumed
by
lava
during
an
earlier
eruption
cycle
that
began
in
and
continued
nearly
nonstop
over
three
decades
kim
said
kilauea
one
of
five
volcanoes
on
the
big
island
formally
known
as
the
island
of
hawaii
has
never
destroyed
so
many
homes
before
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
the
latest
volcanic
eruption
which
entered
its
day
on
thursday
stands
as
the
most
destructive
in
the
united
states
since
at
least
the
cataclysmic
eruption
of
mount
helens
in
washington
state
that
reduced
hundreds
of
square
miles
to
wasteland
according
to
geologist
scott
rowland
a
volcano
specialist
from
the
university
of
hawaii
at
manoa
a
similar
extremely
violent
eruption
from
fuego
volcano
in
guatemala
this
week
killed
more
than
people
as
it
ejected
deadly
pyroclastic
flows
of
lava
and
ash
through
nearby
towns
the
latest
damage
appraisal
from
kilauea
came
moments
after
governor
david
ige
on
a
visit
to
hawaii
county
civil
defense
headquarters
in
hilo
the
island
s
biggest
city
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
furnishing
million
in
immediate
state
disaster
relief
to
the
island
ige
and
kim
also
announced
formation
of
a
task
force
of
federal
state
and
local
officials
to
devise
a
recovery
plan
for
communities
devastated
by
the
eruption
with
an
eye
toward
preventing
such
major
property
losses
in
the
future
our
responsibility
is
to
try
to
work
with
the
community
to
rebuild
out
of
harm
s
way
kim
said
county
civil
defence
officials
had
a
day
earlier
put
the
confirmed
number
of
homes
destroyed
during
the
past
month
at
all
of
them
in
and
around
the
leilani
estates
community
where
fissures
opened
up
on
the
volcano
s
eastern
flank
on
may
more
recently
a
huge
river
of
lava
that
has
crept
several
miles
across
the
landscape
to
the
eastern
tip
of
the
island
engulfed
two
entire
seaside
housing
subdivisions
kapoho
beach
lots
and
vacationland
over
the
course
of
about
three
days
a
rolling
wall
of
molten
rock
measuring
across
and
to
tall
buried
hundreds
of
homes
while
vaporizing
a
small
freshwater
lake
and
filling
in
an
inlet
called
kapoho
bay
extending
about
a
mile
out
from
what
had
been
the
shoreline
kim
said
vacationland
a
private
development
believed
to
comprise
roughly
homes
was
completely
erased
and
that
at
least
houses
were
devoured
by
lava
at
kapoho
beach
lots
the
rest
were
the
rest
of
the
losses
have
occurred
in
the
leilani
estates
area
where
the
toll
of
destruction
has
been
steadily
rising
by
the
day
so
if
you
combine
the
three
of
them
kapoho
vacationland
and
leilani
we
re
talking
about
homes
he
told
reporters
i
m
talking
about
families
don
t
forget
the
farmers
don
t
forget
the
ranchers
don
t
forget
all
the
employees
for
an
estimated
people
have
been
displaced
by
evacuations
across
the
island
since
the
eruption
began
five
weeks
ago
spouting
fountains
of
lava
and
high
concentrations
of
toxic
sulphur
dioxide
gas
through
about
two
dozen
volcanic
fissures
at
the
foot
of
the
volcano
plumes
of
volcanic
ash
belched
into
the
air
by
periodic
daily
explosions
from
the
crater
at
kilauea
s
summit
have
posed
an
additional
nuisance
and
health
hazard
to
nearby
communities
so
too
have
airborne
volcanic
glass
fibres
called
peel
s
hair
wispy
strands
carried
aloft
by
the
wind
from
lava
fountains
and
named
for
the
volcanic
goddess
of
hawaiian
myth
seaside
residents
and
boaters
also
have
been
warned
to
avoid
noxious
clouds
of
laze
a
term
derived
from
the
words
lava
and
haze
formed
when
lava
reacts
with
seawater
to
form
a
mix
of
acid
fumes
steam
and
particles
when
it
flows
into
the
ocean
frequent
earthquakes
mostly
of
relatively
small
magnitude
but
numbering
in
the
thousands
have
persisted
throughout
the
eruption
adding
to
the
jitters
of
residents
living
closest
to
the
volcano
in
addition
to
destroying
homes
and
other
structures
lava
flows
have
knocked
out
telephone
and
power
lines
causing
widespread
communication
outages
and
forced
the
shutdown
of
a
geothermal
energy
plant
that
normally
provides
about
a
quarter
of
the
island
s
electricity
