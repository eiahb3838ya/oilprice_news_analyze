london
reuters
iran
said
on
friday
a
request
for
saudi
arabia
to
pump
more
oil
so
that
it
could
cover
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
was
crazy
and
astonishing
and
said
opec
would
not
heed
the
appeal
setting
the
stage
for
a
tough
opec
meeting
this
month
iran
saudi
arabia
s
has
a
history
of
raising
challenges
in
opec
meetings
in
tehran
refused
to
sign
up
to
opec
policies
saying
it
needed
to
hike
output
due
to
the
easing
of
sanctions
after
a
nuclear
accord
with
world
powers
president
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
that
nuclear
deal
last
month
and
announced
the
highest
level
of
sanctions
against
iran
the
biggest
producer
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
after
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
it
s
crazy
and
astonishing
to
see
instruction
coming
from
washington
to
saudi
to
act
and
replace
a
shortfall
of
iran
s
export
due
to
their
illegal
sanction
on
iran
and
venezuela
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
in
april
oil
prices
were
artificially
high
because
of
opec
the
government
had
also
unofficially
asked
saudi
arabia
and
some
other
opec
producers
to
raise
output
a
day
before
washington
slapped
new
sanctions
on
tehran
in
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
against
tehran
in
which
the
european
union
had
taken
part
iranian
oil
exports
plummeted
by
more
than
half
to
below
million
barrels
per
day
the
eu
is
not
planning
to
join
sanctions
this
time
and
has
called
on
the
united
states
to
give
its
companies
waivers
so
they
can
continue
doing
business
with
tehran
but
many
european
companies
are
already
severing
ties
with
tehran
for
fear
of
facing
secondary
sanctions
from
the
united
states
which
could
mean
losing
access
to
the
dollar
clearing
system
the
sanctions
on
iran
s
petroleum
industry
will
take
effect
after
a
period
ending
on
but
many
european
refiners
are
already
winding
down
iranian
oil
purchases
iran
has
called
on
opec
to
discuss
what
it
called
illegal
sanctions
at
the
next
meeting
on
june
which
is
due
to
debate
production
policies
opec
and
its
allies
led
by
russia
have
cut
a
combined
million
barrels
per
day
of
output
since
january
and
the
cuts
are
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
however
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
said
cuts
could
be
eased
after
receiving
calls
from
consumers
including
the
united
states
china
and
india
to
support
global
demand
iran
s
kazempour
predicted
opec
would
not
heed
the
request
and
said
oil
prices
would
jump
in
response
to
washington
s
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
as
they
did
during
a
previous
round
of
sanctions
against
iran
no
one
in
opec
will
act
against
two
of
its
founder
members
he
said
the
tried
it
last
time
against
iran
but
oil
prices
got
to
a
opec
founded
in
has
a
history
of
collaboration
over
oil
policy
despite
differences
of
opinion
and
even
wars
between
some
members
over
the
said
the
group
would
unite
in
opposition
to
the
request
opec
will
not
accept
such
a
humiliation
how
arrogant
and
ignorant
one
could
be
to
underestimate
the
history
of
years
cooperation
among
competitors
he
we
have
to
live
together
we
can
not
change
geography
but
we
must
build
better
history
