update 2-bp complains to canada regulator about enbridge oil pipeline actions
reuters
oil
producer
bp
plc
complained
to
canada
s
national
energy
board
neb
regulator
about
enbridge
inc
s
implementation
and
then
abrupt
reversal
of
new
rules
for
shipping
crude
on
its
mainline
pipeline
system
neb
documents
showed
on
thursday
enbridge
notified
shippers
late
last
month
that
it
would
introduce
a
supply
verification
procedure
to
determine
each
company
s
volumes
on
the
mainline
but
then
scrapped
the
policy
early
this
week
the
neb
said
in
a
letter
on
thursday
to
bp
and
enbridge
that
it
would
establish
a
process
to
hear
comments
from
both
companies
and
anyone
else
this
month
enbridge
s
initial
notice
of
the
change
caused
the
discount
on
canadian
heavy
crude
against
the
north
american
benchmark
west
texas
intermediate
to
widen
sharply
in
sparse
trade
as
shippers
worried
about
transport
constrictions
the
discount
then
narrowed
rapidly
on
monday
when
enbridge
reversed
course
unnecessarily
injecting
uncertainty
in
how
services
would
be
provided
to
shippers
is
shocking
and
egregious

america
a
subsidiary
of
bp
in
a
june
letter
to
the
neb
geggie
further
noted
the
reversal
was
announced
during
the
main
trading
window
for
july
shipments
and
changing
pipeline
procedure
at
that
point
could
cause
unintended
consequences
which
could
materially
harm
bp
also
said
there
was
a
lack
of
clarity
on
whether
or
not
the
new
supply
verification
procedures
would
apply
after
july
creating
further
uncertainty
for
shippers
enbridge
declined
to
comment
on
bp
s
complaint
and
said
it
would
file
its
response
with
the
neb
in
due
the
mainline
is
part
of
the
largest
crude
oil
transportation
network
in
canada
funnelling
oil
from
alberta
to
refineries
enbridge
has
long
sought
more
efficient
ways
to
move
oil
on
the
network
and
prevent
shippers
from
overestimating
the
product
they
have
to
move
as
they
compete
for
space
