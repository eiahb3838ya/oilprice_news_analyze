russian
petrochemical
company
sibur
said
its
plans
to
build
a
gas
chemical
complex
in
russia
s
far
east
will
require
preliminary
investments
of
up
to
billion
and
it
is
still
looking
for
asian
partners
sibur
said
a
year
ago
that
it
had
been
in
talks
with
a
number
of
chinese
investors
about
participating
in
the
project
to
build
the
complex
in
amur
sibur
s
chief
executive
officer
dmitry
konov
told
reuters
in
a
recent
interview
that
the
company
russia
s
largest
petrochemicals
company
was
still
talking
to
investors
without
giving
details
on
their
progress
we
look
at
the
implementation
of
the
amur
complex
as
a
joint
venture
that
s
why
the
investments
will
be
shared
among
the
partners
konov
said
he
estimated
preliminary
investments
in
the
amur
complex
at
billion
the
plant
will
be
built
to
serve
asian
markets
as
part
of
a
broader
plan
by
russian
gas
export
monopoly
gazprom
to
supply
gas
to
china
gazprom
will
supply
the
complex
with
around
million
tonnes
of
ethane
per
year
the
plant
will
also
enable
sibur
to
diversify
into
asia
the
location
of
the
far
eastern
project
is
not
usual
for
us
konov
said
at
the
moment
our
supplies
to
asia
are
not
that
big
that
s
why
we
see
benefits
in
asian
sibur
said
last
year
that
it
had
been
in
talks
with
china
s
sinopec
which

in
sibur
about
investment
in
the
project
a
spokeswoman
for
sibur
declined
to
comment
on
friday
on
whether
sinopec
might
invest
in
the
project
konov
said
in
march
that
a
final
decision
on
investments
would
be
taken
next
year
sibur
expects
the
plant
to
start
operating
after
following
the
launch
of
gazprom
s
own
gas
processing
plant
also
called
amur
which
will
process
the
gas
before
it
is
exported
to
china
sibur
s
complex
will
produce
different
forms
of
ethylene
from
the
gas
supplied
by
gazprom
s
plant
sibur
currently
mainly
serves
clients
in
the
former
