and
the
prospect
that

all
contributed
to
the
tone

widely
expected
to
raise

next

to
be
exceptionally
tense
president
donald
trump
says
tariffs
are
needed
to
protect
industry

canada
and
the
european
union
have
denounced
them

preparing
retaliatory
measures

the
two
allies
will
reach
an
agreement
and
avoid
an
escalation

tariffs
in
their
stride
largely
because

had
been
lined
up
for
months
and
priced
in

further
escalations
will
hit
confidence
in
the
markets
and
could
trigger
further
corrections
