a
planned
nuclear
plant
to
the
east
of
london
will
not
require
state
investment
the
chinese
company
building
it
said
after
the
british
government
was
criticized
for
helping
another
project
it
is
not
our
plan
to
seek
direct

a
uk
subsidiary
of

s
general
nuclear
power
corporation
cgn
told
reuters
after
saying
it
did
not
want
to
directly
invest
in
new
nuclear
plants
britain
s
government
made
a
this
week
saying
it
could
take
a
stake
in
hitachi
s
near
billion
wlyfa
project
in
wales
cgn
s
davies
said
it
was
too
early
to
discuss
funding
in
detail
but
but
the
fact
that
the
firm
said
it
will
not
need
such
direct
investment
shows
it
is
confident
of
funding
the
project
itself
or
being
able
to
raise
the
cash
the
british
government
also
faced
protests
over
its
decision
to
offer
a
guaranteed
power
price
to
the
hinkley
point
project
being
built
by
france
s
edf
britain
s
first
new
nuclear
plant
in
more
than
twenty
years
britain
says
it
needs
a
new
fleet
of
nuclear
plants
to
replace
aging
coal
and
nuclear
reactors
set
to
close
in
the
as
well
as
to
cut
the
country
s
carbon
emissions
but
large
new
nuclear
power
plants
costing
several
billion
pounds
have
struggled
to
secure
financing
with
the
cost
of
lending
higher
than
traditional
infrastructure
projects
due
to
concerns
over
future
potential
liabilities
this
raised
the
possibility
that
it
would
also
need
to
provide
similar
assistance
for
other
new
plants
to
be
built
hinkley
got
the
final
from
edf
s
board
in
after
several
years
of
delay
and
only
after
securing
backing
from
the
french
government
when
announcing
the
possible
hitachi
deal
britain
s
business
minister
greg
clark
said
it
hoped
future
nuclear
projects
should
be
financed
by
the
private
hinkley
was
also
awarded
a
subsidy
minimum
price
guarantee
from
the
british
government
of
almost
double
current
electricity
prices
which
the
national
audit
office
said
could
cost
consumers
billion
pounds
billion
davies
said
cgn
s
bradwell
project
would
expect
a
much
lower
minimum
guarantee
price
we
know
we
have
to
get
within
a
realistic
range
of
the
cost
of
offshore
wind
he
said
some
offshore
wind
projects
were
awarded
a
minimum
price
as
low
as
per
megawatt
hour
mwh
in
the
latest
round
of
subsidies
compared
with
the
pounds
per
mwh
guaranteed
for
hinkley
cgn
owns
a
third
of
edf
s
hinkley
project
and
will
also
help
it
develop
another
new
plant
in
suffolk
sizewell
the
chinese
company
will
also
lead
construction
of
the
plant
in
bradwell
essex
using
a
nuclear
reactor
which
needs
to
gain
approval
from
britain
s
nuclear
regulator
we
expect
to
complete
the
second
phase
of
the
gda
generic
design
approval
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
final
approval
by
the
end
of
the
target
is
for
the
final
investment
decision
to
be
made
shortly
after
that
davies
said
the
hpr
nuclear
reactor
cgn
plans
to
use
at
bradwell
is
capable
of
generating
megawatts
mw
but
no
decision
has
been
made
yet
about
how
many
reactors
would
be
deployed
