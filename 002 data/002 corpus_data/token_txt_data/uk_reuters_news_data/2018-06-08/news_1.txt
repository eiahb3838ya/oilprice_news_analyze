iraqi
cleric
moqtada
called
on
friday
for
a
nationwide
disarmament
campaign
and
announced

baghdad
stronghold
would
be
first
to
disarm
just
two
days
after
an
ammunitions
cache
exploded
there
and
killed
people
sadr
whose
political
bloc
won
iraq
s
parliamentary
election
in
may
called
on
all
armed
groups
to
hand
in
their
weapons
to
the
government
and
declared
baghdad
s
sadr
city
district
would
be
a
area
later
this
month
everyone
must
obey
the
orders
and
not
stand
in
the
way
of
this
initiative
everyone
should
hand
over
their
weapons
without
any
discussion
because
the
blood
of
iraqis
is
more
valuable
to
us
than
anything
else
he
told
his
supporters
in
a
statement
the
move
appeared
to
be
aimed
at
easing
tensions
between
sadr
and
the
government
at
least
people
were
killed
and
over
wounded
as
a
result
of
the
detonation
of
an
ammunitions
cache
in
sadr
city
just
hours
after
parliament
mandated
a
nationwide
recount
of
votes
for
the
may
election
a
measure
rejected
by
sadr
s
bloc
sadr
had
urged
his
followers
to
remain
calm
after
the
explosion
and
ordered
his
office
to
investigate
the
incident
prime
minister
haider
whose
bloc
came
in
third
said
storing
ammunition
in
a
residential
area
was
a
crime
and
ordered
the
interior
ministry
to
investigate
the
incident
and
take
legal
action
against
those
who
had
done
so
some
of
sadr
s
political
opponents
had
suggested
the
ammunitions
cache
belonged
to
his
saraya
peace
companies
militia
the
interior
ministry
released
a
statement
on
friday
thanking
sadr
for
his
announcement
sadr
a
nationalist
who
opposes
the
involvement
of
both
the
united
states
and
iran
scored
a
surprise
victory
in
the
may
vote
by
promising
to
fight
corruption
and
improve
services
parliament
passed
a
law
on
wednesday
ordering
a
nationwide
manual
recount
of
votes
in
the
election
after
abadi
cited
serious
violations
the
move
could
undermine
sadr
who
has
in
the
past
mobilised
tens
of
thousands
of
followers
to
protest
against
government
policies
one
of
his
top
aides
expressed
concerns
that
some
parties
were
trying
to
sabotage
the
cleric
s
victory
sadr
has
always
been
seen
as
a
wildcard
in
iraq
s
turbulent
politics
which
is
often
driven
by
sectarian
interests
his
militia
previously
known
as
the
mehdi
army
staged
two
violent
uprisings
against
occupation
forces
after
the
invasion
iraqi
and
officials
described
him
at
the
time
as
the
biggest
security
threat
in
iraq
he
stressed
on
friday
that
the
disarmament
campaign
should
be
directed
at
all
armed
groups
and
warned
that
his
followers
must
not
be
its
sole
target
the
sadrist
bloc
must
not
be
targeted
using
this
initiative
or
else
there
will
be
negative
consequences
sadr
said
it
must
also
be
enacted
upon
official
security
forces
that
use
weapons
without
permission
or
mercy
these
forces
are
still
young
and
need
rehabilitation
he
said
referring
to
the
mostly
shi
ite
militias
collectively
known
as
popular
mobilisation
forces
pmf
iraq
s
military
and
police
dislodged
islamic
state
militants
who
took
over
a
third
of
the
country
with
the
help
of
both
a
coalition
and
the
militias
many
of
which
are
linked
to
political
groups
the
pmf
was
later
formally
integrated
into
iraq
s
official
security
structure
and
militias
officially
severed
ties
with
their
political
wings
although
informal
links
remain
