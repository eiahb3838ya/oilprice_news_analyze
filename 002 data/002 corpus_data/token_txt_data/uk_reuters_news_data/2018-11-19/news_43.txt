the
remains
of
people
have
been

late
on
sunday
the

on
was
percent
contained
up
from
percent
earlier
in
the
day
rain
is
forecast
for
the
area
this
week
potentially
helping
douse
the
flames
but
raising
the
risk
of
floods
and
mudslides
that
will
swell
the
misery
of
people
under
evacuation
orders
many
refugees
from
the
fire
have
taken
up
temporary
residence
with
friends
and
relatives
while
others
have
pitched
tents
or
were
camping
out
of
their
vehicles
the
death
toll
far
surpasses
the
previous
fatality
record
from
a
single
california
wildfire
in
the
griffith
park
fire
of
in
los
angeles
and
already
ranks
among
the
deadliest
wildfires
since
the
turn
of
the
last
century

perished

the
big
burn
firestorm
that
swept
the
northern
rockies
in
august
minnesota
s
cloquet
fire
in
october
killed
people
in
paradise
the
flames
moved
so
fast
that
some
victims
died
in
their
cars
in
a
chaotic
evacuation
as
gridlock
formed
on
the
two
exit
routes
out
of
town
the
butte
county
sheriff
s
office
said
the
list
of
the
missing
is
compiled
using
information
received
from
a
special
hotline
as
well
as
emails
and
calls
that
came
in
during
the
first
chaotic
hours
of
the
blaze
authorities
said
some
of
those
listed
likely
survived
but
have
not
yet
notified
family
or
officials
either
because
they
lack
phone
service
or
were
unaware
anyone
was
looking
for
them
in
paradise
home

nearly
people
before
the

were
helping

on
saturday
sort
through
the

fragments
sorting
them
into
paper
bags
roger
fielding
chief
deputy
coroner
with
the
martin
county
sheriff
s
office
said
each
site
was
treated
as
a
crime
scene
with
every
step
of
recovery
documented
with
photographs
our
job
is
to
pick
up
any
items
that
might
reflect
who
this
person
might
be
he
said
besides
the
toll
on
human
life
property
losses
from
the
blaze
make
it
the
most
destructive
in
california
history
posing
the
additional
challenge
of
providing
shelter
for
many
thousands
of
displaced
residents
at
last
count
the
camp
fire
had
destroyed
more
than
homes
and
other
structures
authorities
said
late
on
sunday
up
to
inches
cm
of
rain
is
expected
to
fall
from

sierra
foothills
said
patrick
burke
a
forecaster
with
the
national
weather
service
s
weather
prediction
center
in
college
park
maryland
it
ll
bring
much
needed
relief
to
the
firefighters
and
to
the
air
quality
but
there
s
a
potential
for
dangerous
mudslides
wherever
vegetation
is
burned
away
on
slopes
and
hills
burke
said
up
to
inches
of
rain
is
also
expected
to
fall
on
southern

this
week
where
the
woolsey

claimed
at

three
lives
that

was
percent
contained
on
sunday
authorities
said
with
full
containment
expected
on
thanksgiving
thursday
the
precise
causes
of
the
both
fires
were
under
investigation
but
electric
utilities
have
reported
equipment
problems
in
the
vicinity
of
both
blazes
around
the
time
they
erupted
pg
e
corp
has
said
it
could
face
liability
that
exceeds
its
insurance
coverage
if
its
equipment
were
found
to
have
caused
the
camp
fire
on
friday
the
company
reported
to
regulators
a
second

that
it
experienced
in
butte
county
on
the
morning
of
when
the
camp
fire
started
during
a
visit
to
both
fire
zones
on
saturday

mismanagement
and
he
said
he
discussed
the
issue
with
california
governor
jerry
brown
and
gavin
newsom
scientists
say
the
growing
frequency
and
intensity
of
wildfires
in
california
and
elsewhere
across
the
west
are
largely
attributable
to
prolonged
drought
