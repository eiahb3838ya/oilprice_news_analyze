the
c
in
apec
stands
for
cooperation
but
when
the
two
biggest
members
are
fighting
a
trade
war
and
using
the
forum
to
attack
each
other
s
policies
it
was
always
going
to
be
hard
work
delivering
on
that
the
weekend
s
economic
cooperation
summit
in
port
moresby
was
one
of
open
disagreement
led
by
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
china
over
trade
security
and
who
would
be
the
better
investment
partner
for
the
region
as
apec
approaches
its
anniversary
the
failure
to
agree
on
a
communique
for
the
first
time
calls
into
question
its
relevance
in
a
crowded
summit
calendar
and
as
the
trump
administration
makes
clear
its
aversion
to
multilateralism
it
does
mark
the
death
of
apec
s
founding
trade
vision
euan
graham
executive
director
of
la
trobe
asia
at
australia
s
la
trobe
university
said
on
twitter
adding
apec
was
the
most
disposable
of
the
regional
summits
rather
than
cooperation
the
theme
seemed
to
be
conflict
and
containment
as
beijing
and
washington
directly
criticised
each
other
s
policies
and
staked
their
claims
as
to
why
they
were
the
security
and
investment
partner
the
pacific
should
choose
it
s
not
even
supposed
to
be
binding
it
s
apec
said
one
diplomat
involved
in
negotiations
for
the
communique
surprised
that
the
members
couldn
t
agree
on
what
is
usually
a
humdrum
summary
of
issues
discussed
china
and
the
hijacked
the
apec
spirit
i
the
united
states
even
preferred
its
own
terminology
of
which
it
defines
as
running
from
the
western
shores
of
latin
america
to
the
furthest
reaches
of
the
indian
ocean

mentioning
apec
five
times
and
times
in
his
apec
speech
on
saturday
speaking
in
beijing
on
monday
chinese
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
said
the
united
states
attended
apec
in
a
blaze
of
anger
causing
disputes
and
disagreements
and
damaging
the
harmonious
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
apec
is
a
platform
to
deepen
cooperation
not
a
place
to
criticise
each
other
china
attended
to
promote
cooperation
and
seek
consensus
not
to
get
into
a
boxing
ring
geng
told
reporters
founded
in
with
a
view
to
fostering
trade
and
economic
ties
around
the
pacific
ocean
it
operated
at
a
ministerial
level
until
when
president
bill
clinton
established
the
annual
leaders
meeting
each
meeting
had
produced
a
joint
statement
at
its
conclusion
until
sunday
this
is
very
concerning
from
a
systemic
perspective
the
wto
faces
similar
challenges
said
charles
finny
a
trade
consultant
and
a
former
new
zealand
government
trade
negotiator
in
an
editorial
chinese
tabloid
the
global
times
said
the
absence
of
a
communique
was
not
a
big
deal
and
placed
more
significance
on
an
upcoming
meeting
between
president
donald
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
the
two
leaders
are
expected
to
meet
at
the
summit
which
starts
in
argentina
next
week
it
is
hoped
washington
makes
serious
preparations
for
the
summit
and
not
pin
its
hopes
on
exerting
pressure
said
the
tabloid
which
is
known
for
its
nationalistic
stance
still
there
did
seem
to
be
some
chinese
concern
over
the
communique
with
officials
rebuffed
on
saturday
when
they
tried
to
meet
png
foreign
minister
rimbink
pato
on
the
issue
pato
confirmed
to
reuters
that
chinese
officials
had
wanted
to
see
him
but
said
they
had
not
made
necessary
arrangements
as
the
apec
host
it
was
papua
new
guinea
s
png
role
to
produce
a
communique
but
the
hostility
and
conflicting
visions
on
display
meant
few
blamed
the
group
s
poorest
country
for
being
caught
between
two
feuding
superpowers
in
these
times
chairing
a
gathering
such
as
the
leaders
that
we
had
over
the
last
few
days
is
no
easy
task
australian
prime

scott
morrison
said
adding
papua
new
guinea
prime
minister
peter
o
neill
had
shown
great
integrity
and
leadership
indeed
one
big
change
was
pacific

found
themselves
aggressively
courted
by
the
two
superpowers
competing
for

in
the
strategically
important
