reuters
iran
will
continue
to
export
oil
despite
sanctions
which
are
part
of
a
psychological
war
doomed
to
failure
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
on
monday
by
reimposing
sanctions
on
opec
s
third
biggest
crude
producer
washington
wants
to
force
tehran
to
drop
its
ballistic
missile
programs
further
curb
its
nuclear
work
and
limit
its
support
for
proxy
militias
from
syria
to
lebanon
and
yemen
we
will
not
yield
to
this
pressure
which
is
part
of
the
psychological
war
launched
against
iran
rouhani
said
in
a
speech
in
the
city
of
khoy
broadcast
live
on
state
television
they
have
failed
to
stop
our
oil
exports
we
will
keep
exporting
it
your
regional
policies
have
failed
and
you
blame
iran
for
that
failure
from
afghanistan
to
yemen
and
syria
he
added
to
chants
of
death
to
america
rouhani
said
washington
lacked
the
necessary
international
support
for
its
sanctions
and
noted
that
it
had
granted
temporary
waivers
to
eight
major
buyers
of
iranian
oil
america
is
isolated
now
iran
is
supported
by
many
countries
except
for
the
zionist
regime
israel
and
some
countries
in
the
region
no
other
country
backs
america
s
pressure
on
iran
he
said
the
european
union
france
germany
britain
russia
and
china
participants
with
the
united
states
in
the
deal
that
lifted
sanctions
on
iran
in
exchange
for
curbs
on
its
nuclear
program
have
been
trying
to
find
ways
to
circumvent
the
limitations
in
particular
the
eu
has
been
trying
to
establish
a
special
purpose
vehicle
spv
for
trade
with
iran
but
this
has
not
stopped
foreign
businesses
ranging
from
oil
companies
and
trading
houses
to
firms
leaving
iran
for
fear
of
incurring
penalties
iran
has
threatened
to
exit
the
deal
if
its
economic
benefits
are
not
preserved
but
foreign
ministry
spokesman
bahram
qasemi
told
a
news
conference
that
it
remained
hopeful
that
the
europeans
can
save
the
deal
the
spv
was
conceived
as
a
clearing
house
that
could
be
used
to
help
match
iranian
oil
and
gas
exports
against
purchases
of
eu
goods
circumventing
the
sanctions
which
are
based
on
the
global
use
of
the
dollar
for
oil
trade
the
eu
wanted
to
have
the
spv
set
up
by
this
month
but
no
country
has
offered
to
host
it
six
diplomats
told
reuters
last
week
we
expect
eu
to
implement
the
spv
as
soon
as
possible
qasemi
said
iran
adheres
to
its
commitments
as
long
as
other
signatories
honor
iran
s
deputy
oil
minister
amirhossein
zamaninia
said
france
might
host
the
spv
the
fars
news
agency
reported
on
monday
the
french
foreign
ministry
declined
to
comment
the
finance
ministry
has
said
that
all
options
are
on
the
table
for
the
spv
and
that
no
decisions
had
been
taken
washington
has
warned
that
european
banks
and
firms
who
engage
in
the
spv
will
be
at
risk
from
the
reimposed
sanctions
