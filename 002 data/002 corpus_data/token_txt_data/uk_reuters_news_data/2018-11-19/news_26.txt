emergency
services
on
sunday
sifted
through
the
charred
wreckage
of
california
s
deadliest
ever
wildfire
searching
for
signs
of
nearly
people
believed
still
missing
as
crews
made
progress
in
bringing
the
blaze
under
control
the
remains
of
people
have
been
recovered
the
butte
county
sheriff
s
office
said
late
on
sunday
as
it
cut
the
number
of
missing
to
from
it
gave
no
other
details
the
camp
fire
broke
out
in
northern
california
on
and
quickly
all
but
obliterated
paradise
a
mountain
town
of
nearly
people
around
miles
km
north
of
state
capital
sacramento
officials
said
it
had
consumed
about
acres
and
was
percent
contained
late
on
sunday
up
from
percent
earlier
in
the
day
as
prospects
of
a
heavy
rainstorm
from
late
tuesday
onwards
raised
hopes
that
that
percentage
will
rise
as
the
week
progresses
they
said
full
containment
was
not
expected
until
however
up
to
four
inches
cm
of
rain
are
forecast
to
fall
north
of
san
francisco
between
late
tuesday
and
friday
said
patrick
burke
a
forecaster
at
the
national
weather
service
s
weather
prediction
center
in
maryland
this
weather
system
is
locked
in
he
said
the
rain
would
also
make
it
harder
for
forensic
teams
sifting
through
ash
and
dirt
looking
for
the
bones
of
the
dead
the
rain
will
easily
disturb
the
soil
where
remains
might
be
found
burke
said
pathologists
from
the
university
of
nevada
reno
worked
through
the
weekend
as
firefighters
peeled
back
debris
collecting
bits
of
burned
bones
and
photographing
everything
that
might
help
identify
the
victims
the
storm
which
is
expected
to
carry
moderate
winds
of
mph
could
also
cause
problems
for
evacuees
hundreds
of
whom
are
sheltering
in
tens
and
cars
it
isn
t
clear
how
many
people
are
in
need
of
shelter
but
as
many
as
people
had
been
ordered
to
evacuate
while
it
isn
t
an
exceptionally
strong
storm
the
recent
burns
make
mud
slides
on
hills
and
slopes
a
real
danger
burke
said
south
of
sacramento
near
malibu
at
least
two
inches
of
rain
are
expected
to
fall
on
a
second
fire
the
woolsey
known
to
have
killed
three
people
it
was
percent
contained
on
sunday
and
full
containment
was
expected
on
thanksgiving
thursday
the
cause
of
both
fires
is
under
investigation
but
electric
utilities
reported
localized
equipment
problems
around
the
time
they
broke
out
pg
e
corp
has
said
it
could
face
liability
that
exceeds
its
insurance
coverage
if
its
equipment
were
found
to
have
caused
the
camp
fire
