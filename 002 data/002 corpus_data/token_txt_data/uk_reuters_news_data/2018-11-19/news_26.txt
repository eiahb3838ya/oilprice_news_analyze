hedge

have
exited
from
all
the
bullish
positions
in
crude
oil

they
accumulated
in

the

unwound

and
prospective

by

is
matched
by
downside
risks
from
rapidly
rising
shale
production
and
a
deteriorating
economic
outlook
hedge

and
other
money
managers
cut
their
combined
net

in
the
six
most
important
petroleum
futures
and
options

by

managers
have
sold
the
equivalent
of
million
barrels
of
crude
and

in
the
last
seven
weeks
the
largest
reduction
over
a
comparable
period
since
at

funds
now
hold
a
net

of
just
million

bullishness
towards
oil
prices
has
evaporated
and
hedge
funds
now
have
the
fewest
outright
long
positions
in
crude
and
fuels
since
january
when
oil
prices
were
hitting
the
bottom
of
the
last
slump
by
contrast
short
positions
have
climbed
to
million
barrels
the
highest
for
a
year
and
up
from
a
recent
low
of
just
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
september
in
the
last
five
weeks
funds
have
sold
million
barrels
of
gasoline
million
barrels
of
heating
oil
and
million
barrels
of
european
gasoil
but
the
heaviest
selling
has
been
in
crude
where
fund
managers
have
sold
million
barrels
of
brent
in
the
last
seven
weeks
and
million
barrels
of
wti
in
the
last
weeks
fund
managers
still
have
a
residual
net
long
position
of
million
barrels
in
brent
and
wti
according
to
an
analysis
of
exchange
and
regulatory
data
but
most
of
the
remaining
positions
appear
to
be
passive
and
structural
in
nature
rather
than
expressing
an
active
view
on
prices
the
money
manager
category
of
positions
reported
by
exchanges
and
regulators
includes
passive
index
funds
and
pension
funds
as
well
as
more
actively
managed
hedge
funds
pension
funds
and
index
funds
play
little
role
in
the
price
formation
process
in
contrast
to
the
much
more
active
strategies
pursued
by
hedge
fund
managers
because
of
the
way
the
data
is
published
there
is
no
way
to
identify
how
many
of
these
positions
were
active
positions
held
by
hedge
funds
and
how
many
were
more
passive
positions
held
by
a
range
of
players
but
it
may
be
possible
to
make
a
rough
division
between
positions
and
more
positions
by
a
careful
inspection
of
the
data
there
appears
to
be
a
structural
net
long
position
in
crude
oil
futures
and
options
of
around
million

since

by

it

to
estimate
the
remaining
active

held
by
hedge

following
the
recent
wave
of

fund
managers
have
reduced
their
actual

down
almost
exactly
