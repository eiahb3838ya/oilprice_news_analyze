amid
conflicting
signals

firmed

after
president

said
that
he
might
not
impose
more
tariffs
on

goods
after
beijing
sent
a
list
of
measures
it

of
a

when

meets
chinese

on
the

of
a

in

this

however
tensions
were
clearly
on
display
at
an

in
papua
new
guinea
over
the
weekend
where
leaders
failed
to
agree
on
a
communique
for
the
first
time
ever
vice

mike
pence
said
in
a
blunt
speech
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
until
china
changed
its
ways
the
comments
from
trump
were
seen
as
offering
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
further

action
could
be
held

it

the

a
result
it
now
sees
a
broad

next

its
bearish
view
on

tipped
latin

currencies
the
swedish

the
canadian

and
new

dollars
and
the
israeli
shekel
to
rise
we
see
several
changes
to
the
global
economic
backdrop
which
combined
with
a
few
negative
factors
point
to
more
downside

later
on

if
he
echoes

british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
sunday
that
toppling
her

risk
delaying

as
she
faces
the
possibility
of
a

challenge
from
within
her

party
with
both
and
lawmakers
unhappy
with
the

not
clear
that
she
will
be
able
