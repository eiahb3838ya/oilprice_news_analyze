world
shares
struggled
higher
on
monday
amid
conflicting
signals
of
a
potential
truce
in
the
trade
dispute
while
the
federal
reserve
s
concerns
over
the
global
economy
sapped
the
dollar
asia
had
taken
a
while
to
warm
up
but
finished
strongly
and
europe
was
heading
for
its
first
rise
in
four
sessions
as
mining
tech
and
bank
share
gains
helped
offset
a
nasty
prang
to
the
car
sector
it
was
a
bit
though
renault
s
shares
crashed
more
than
percent
as
it
and
nissan
s
joint
chairman
carlos
ghosn
was
arrested
in
japan
for
financial
misconduct
the
sector
s
gloom
was
further
compounded
by
a
percent
slump
in
vw
s
global
october
numbers
and
with
wall
street
futures
dithering
either
side
of
flat
in
new

overall
sentiment
was
starting
to
backslide
again
i
m
not
sure
one
man
warrants
such
a
big
drop
in
the
share
price
cmc
markets
senior
strategist
michael
hewson
said
referring
to
nissan
and
renault
s
woes
but
maybe
people
think
it
could
prompt
the
french
government
which
has
a
stake
in
renault
to
launch
an
enquiry
into
the
running
of
the
over
in
the
currency
markets
the
pound
saw
some
respite
from
last
week
s
brexit
trauma
as
the
dollar
and
euro
both
went
limp
as
focus
switched
back
to
the
trade
feud
wall
street
had
firmed
on
friday
after
president
donald
trump
said
that
he
might
not
impose
more
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
after
beijing
sent
a
list
of
measures
it
was
willing
to
take
to
resolve
trade
tensions
the
comment
stoked
speculation
of
a
deal
when
trump
meets
chinese
president
xi
jinping
on
the
sidelines
of
a
summit
in
argentina
this
month
however
tensions
were
clearly
on
display
at
an
apec
meeting
in
papua
new
guinea
over
the
weekend
where
leaders
failed
to
agree
on
a
communique
for
the
first
time
ever
vice
president
mike
pence
said
in
a
blunt
speech
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
until
china
changed
its
ways
the
comments
from
trump
were
seen
as
offering
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
further
tariff
action
could
be
held
in
abeyance
said
nab
s
head
of

attrill
the
exchange
of
barbs
between
pence
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
in
png
on
the
weekend
continues
to
suggest
this
is
also
uncertain
was
the
outlook
for
interest
rates
federal
reserve
policymakers
are
still
signalling
rate
increases
ahead
but
also
sounded
more
concerned
about
a
potential
global
slowdown
leading
markets
to
suspect
the
tightening
cycle
may
not
have
much
further
to
run
investment
bank
goldman
sachs
chimed
in
saying
on
monday
that
it
expected
the
pace
of
economic
growth
to
slow
towards
the
global
average
next
year
and
that
the
dollar
would
see
a
broad
based
drop
as
a
result
on
top
of
that
it
revised
its
bearish
view
on
the
japanese
yen
and
tipped
latin
american
currencies
the
swedish
krona
the
canadian
australian
and
new
zealand
dollars
and
israeli
shekel
for
rises
next
year
too
we
see
several
changes
to
the
global
economic
backdrop
which
combined
with
a
few
negative
factors
point
to
more
downside
than
upside
to
the
broad
dollar

analysts
said
in
a
macroeconomic
outlook
report
that
will
focus
attention
on
an
appearance
by
new
york
fed
president
john
williams
later
on
monday
to
see
if
he
echoes
the
same
theme

last

british
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
on
sunday
that
toppling
her

risk
delaying

as
she
faces
the
possibility
of
a

challenge
from

her
own
party
with
both

lawmakers
unhappy
with
the

that

able
to

the

of

the
risk
that
britain
will
leave

westminster
seems
to
be
