underwater
surveys
began
on
monday
after
an
oil
spill
off
canada
s
atlantic
coast
as
husky
energy
inc
and
government
agencies
assessed
a
leak
that
temporarily
shut
down
all
crude
production
in
the
waters
of
newfoundland
labrador
a
leaking
flowline
from
husky
s
white
rose
field
to
the
searose
storage
vessel
was
detected
on
friday
when
husky
was
restarting
production
after
suspending
operations
a
day
earlier
due
to
stormy
weather
the
spill
involved
cubic
meters
barrels
of
oil
husky
spokeswoman
colleen
mcconnell
said
on
monday
she
said
the
company
is
monitoring
the
area
for
oil
sheens
and
any
impact
on
wildlife
the
leak
forced
husky
s
white
rose
to
shut
down
along
with
all
other
producing
oil
projects
in
the
area
until
the
regulator
labrador
offshore
petroleum
board
determines
it
is
safe
to
resume
the
board
said
in
a
statement
on
sunday
along
with
white
rose
there
are
three
other
producing
projects
off
the
shore
of
newfoundland
exxon
mobil
corp
s
hebron
and
hibernia
fields
and
the
suncor
energy
terra
nova
exxon
mobil
said
on
monday
it
had
safely
resumed
production
at
hebron
while
its
larger
hibernia
field
has
not
yet
restarted
it
said
it
shut
in
production
at
the
two
fields
prior
to
the
husky
incident
the
combined
output
of
canada
s
atlantic
projects
is
barrels
per
day
a
volume
that
is
unlikely
to
affect
oil
markets
significantly
with
global
storage
levels
high
and
a
likely
quick
return
to
production
said
mark
oberstoetter
director
of
upstream
canada
for
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
environmental
groups
said
that
while
government
and
industry
officials
have
said
they
can
protect
oceans
from
the
risks
of
an
offshore
spill
the
reality
is
more
complicated
this
is
the
inevitable
nightmare
scenario
where
extreme
weather
is
making
it
impossible
to
determine
how
much
oil
has
been
spilled
much
less
try
to
clean
it
up
said
keith
stewart
senior
energy
strategist
with
greenpeace
canada
there
were
no
injuries
to
oil
workers
during
the
storm
one
of
the
worst
in
decades
the
newfoundland
labrador
regulator
said
on
sunday
a

for
the
regulator
did
not
respond
