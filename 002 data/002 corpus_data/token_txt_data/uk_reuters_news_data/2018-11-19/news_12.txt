norway's wealth fund should divest from rwe -green groups
oslo
reuters
green
groups
have
urged
norway
s
trillion
wealth
fund
to
sell
its
small
stake
in
german
power
firm
rwe
saying
the
company
is
a
heavy
polluter
due
to
its
plants
greenpeace
said
in
a
report
published
on
tuesday
that
it
was
disgraceful
that
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
was
still
invested
in
rwe
rwe
is
germany
s
largest
power
producer
and
operates
a
number
of
power
plants
the
report
entitled
last
gasp
the
coal
companies
making
europe
sick
was
by
greenpeace
the
sandbag
climate
and
other
environmentalists
it
used
a
european
atmospheric
model
to
estimate
how
coal
power
plant
emissions
impact
pollution
levels
in
the
air
over
europe
and
found
rwe
to
be
the
worst
offender
rwe
said
it
was
unable
to
comment
specifically
on
the
report
as
it
had
not
seen
it
however
it
said
that
all
its
power
stations
fully
complied
with
the
emission
limits
established
by
law
and
the
authorities
the
legislator
s
intention
is
to
keep
human
health
from
being
jeopardized
with
the
limits
having
the
greatest
protective
effect
on
senior
citizens
and
children
we
constantly
work
on
further
reducing
our
specific
emissions
rwe
said
in
an
emailed
response
to
reuters
request
for
comment
in
this
context
account
should
be
taken
of
the
fact
that
the
emissions
of
our
power
plants
above
all
nitrous
oxides
only
account
for
a
very
small
portion
of
the
emissions
in
the
power
stations
surroundings
norway
s
wealth
fund
which
is
mandated
to
divest
from
companies
that
derive
more
than
percent
of
their
revenues
or
activities
from
coal
had
a
percent
stake
in
rwe
as
of
the
end
of
worth
million
according
to
the
fund
s
own
data
this
new
analysis
should
be
a
clear
call
for
the
norwegian
government
pension
fund
and
other
major
rwe
shareholders
to
exit
the
company
martin
norman
head
of
greenpeace
nordic
s
sustainable
finance
campaign
told
reuters
the
wealth
fund
declined
to
comment
since
it
was
mandated
in
to
avoid
companies
heavily
reliant
on
coal
the
wealth
fund
has
divested
from
companies
mostly
coal
miners
but
also
utilities
using
coal
in
their
energy
mix
it
has
kept
investments
in
companies
that
have
a
credible
plan
to
reduce
their
share
of
revenues
from
coal
increase
revenues
from
renewable
energy
it
was
not
clear
whether
rwe
derives
more
than
percent
of
its
activities
from
coal
the
wealth
fund
s
ceo
yngve
slyngstad
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
last
month
that
it
was
generally
very
difficult
to
get
good
data
from
power
producers
on
this
rwe
said
in
its
emailed
response
that
it
had
a
set
a
roadmap
to
sharply
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
lignite
in
the
roadmap
reveals
that
emissions
will
be
cut
by
up
to
percent
by
as
early
as
it
is
regrettable
that
such
facts
have
apparently
not
been
considered
in
the
report
rwe
said
rwe
also
said
that
after
its
asset
swap
transaction
with
german
peer
is
completed
it
would
become
europe
s
renewables
player
it
said
renewables
would
account
for
roughly
percent
of
its
earnings
before
interest
taxes
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
and
that
percent
of
its
power
generation
portfolio
would
produce
electricity
with
low
or
absolutely
no
carbon
emissions
