analysis-refiners get taste of post-imo world with gasoline/diesel imbalance
london
reuters
refineries
around
the
world
are
squeezing
out
every
last
drop
of
diesel
while
drowning
in
gasoline
in
what
could
well
become
the
new
normal
for
the
next
few
years
the
imbalance
is
a
confluence
of
major
shifts
in
oil
markets
surging
production
of
light
shale
oil
plummeting
exports
of
heavier
venezuelan
and
iranian
crude
weakening
gasoline
demand
and
rising
diesel
consumption
the
coming
in
of
the
biggest
change
in
fuel
regulations
in
decades
when
the
international
maritime
organisation
imo
will
start
requiring
ships
to
use
cleaner
fuel
is
likely
to
prolong
this
reality
oil
executives
and
analysts
say
refineries
that
distil
crude
oil
into
fuel
have
always
had
to
adapt
their
output
to
shifting
demand
patterns
such
as
high
consumption
of
gasoline
in
summer
and
increased
demand
for
heating
oil
in
winter
but
the
market
for
refined
products
appears
out
of
kilter
in
a
way
rarely
seen
before
and
the
imo
changes
are
likely
to
prolong
the
imbalance
we
are
witnessing
a
microcosm
of
the
environment
jefferies
analyst
jason
gammel
said
the
new
imo
regulations
will
reduce
the
allowed
content
of
sulphur
in
shipping
fuel
known
as
bunker
fuel
from
percent
to
percent
increasing
demand
for
diesel
at
the
expense
of
dirtier
fuel
oil
ahead
of
the
change
refineries
invested
in
equipment
to
remove
more
sulphur
from
crude
oil
and
increase
production
of
diesel
at
the
same
time
a
slew
of
new
refineries
has
come
or
will
come
on
stream
in
coming
years
several
changes
are
further
impacting
oil
refining
first
gasoline
demand
is
gradually
decelerating
due
to
higher
engine
efficiency
slowing
economic
growth
in
china
and
a
gradual
expansion
of
the
electric
vehicle
fleet
the
international
energy
agency
has
estimated
that
gasoline
demand
will
grow
by
a
puny
barrels
per
day
in
the
slowest
expansion
since
diesel
demand
on
the
other
hand
has
been
persistently
strong
due
to
higher
industrial
activity
in
the
united
states
while
global
stocks
have
tightened
as
a
result
of
lower
exports
from
china
and
refinery
outages
for
a
graphic
on
diesel
vs
gasoline
png
see
the
imbalance
has
been
deepened
by
the
shifting
supply
of
crude
oil
to
lighter
sweet
grades
that
yield
less
diesel
and
more
gasoline
production
of
light
shale
oil
in
the
united
states
surged
over
the
past
year
while
supply
of
heavy
crudes
dropped
in
venezuela
and
iran
which
was
hit
by
newly
instated
sanctions
this
month
so
while
historically
refineries
tweak
their
crude
intake
and
production
yields
to
adapt
to
seasonal
consumption
this
time
the
acute
demand
for
diesel
and
lighter
crude
intake
means
refiners
are
opting
to
maximise
output
in
terms
of
overall
refining
profits
strong
diesel
cracks
are
able
to
offset
slumping
gasoline
margins
refineries
have
also
found
support
from
fuel
oil
a
bottom
of
the
barrel
product
usually
sold
at
a
loss
the
abundance
of
light
sweet
crude
has
pushed
up
demand
for
fuel
oil
which
is
blended
with
lighter
crude
to
increase
diesel
output
we
are
seeing
very
healthy
demand
for
diesel
and
fuel
oil
and
the
only
weak
spot
really
is
gasoline
dario
scaffardi
chief
executive
of
italian
refiner
saras
told
reuters
the
imo
will
be
very
constructive
for
us
and
the
question
is
how
constructive
i
would
agree
that
this
scenario
of
strong
diesel
and
weak
gasoline
seems
the
most
reasonable
going
unlike
previous
years
that
saw
an
extreme
imbalance
between
gasoline
and
diesel
which
account
for
around
percent
of
global
refinery
output
today
s
reality
is
likely
to
persist
refineries
will
attempt
to
shift
output
as
much
as
they
can
away
from
gasoline
into
diesel
said
russell
hardy
chief
executive
of
vitol
the
world
s
largest
oil
trader
which
owns
several
refineries
in
europe
as
more
refineries
come
on
and
as
more
light
sweet
materials
come
on
it
is
going
to
tend
to
weigh
heavily
on
that
part
of
the
barrel
which
in
turn
essentially
puts
all
of
the
onus
on
distillates
to
make
the
refinery
margin
in
hardy
told
the
reuters
commodities
summit
in
october
consultancy
jbc
energy
expects
the
abundance
of
light
crude
supply
in
the
united
states
to
hinder
the
ability
of
refiners
to
cut
gasoline
output
while
also
forecasting
that
demand
in
is
unlikely
to
rebound
strongly
the
refineries
with
the
highest
diesel
production
and
lowest
fuel
oil
output
are
generally
likely
to
benefit
the
most
from
the
imo
changes
less
complex
older
plants
that
have
a
greater
output
of
gasoline
or
fuel
oil
are
likely
to
fall
behind
according
to
morgan
stanley
in
europe
spain
s
repsol
turkey
s
tupras
and
saras
are
best
placed
for
the
imo
changes
in

the
