nickel
nornickel
plans
to
ramp
up
output
over
the
next
five
years
to
tap
an
expected
boom
in
demand
from
electric
vehicle
makers
its
ceo
and
top
shareholder
vladimir
potanin
told
reuters
the
company
which
vies
with
brazil
s
vale
to
be
the
world
s
largest
nickel
producer
has
been
profitable
for
years
thanks
to
its
arctic
operations
but
output
has
been
relatively
stable
due
to
a
decline
in
metal
content
in
ore
and
as
it
focused
on
revamping
production
facilities
now
with
nickel
set
to
benefit
from
its
use
in
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
potanin
thinks
the
time
is
right
to
step
up
production
he
said
in
an
interview
the
firm
could
lift
nickel
and
copper
output
by
percent
and
production
of
platinum
group
metals
pgms
by
percent
by
from
levels
if
it
launches
two
new
projects
nickel
output
alone
could
rise
to
tonnes
by
from
tonnes
in
this
tonnes
equates
to
about
a
third
of
nornickel
s
estimate
of
the
world
s
nickel
deficit
for
the
two
projects
being
considered
by
nornickel
which
currently
accounts
for
percent
of
global
nickel
output
and
is
the
world
s
top
palladium
producer
with
the
share
of
percent
are
the
third
stage
of
its
talnakh
concentrator
upgrade
and
south
cluster
which
may
start
pgm
production
these
projects
would
require
the
company
to
raise
capital
expenditure
capex
by
billion
to
billion
in
potanin
said
adding
he
hoped
russia
would
support
some
of
nornickel
s
projects
as
part
of
the
list
of
strategic
projects
which
metals
and
mining
companies
are
discussing
with
the
government
nornickel
s
current
capex
plan
includes
billion
for
its
base
investment
programme
and
billion
for
its
environmental
programme
these
programmes
remain
a
priority
and
are
expected
to
add
billion
to
core
earnings
in
as
well
as
boosting
output
of
nickel
and
pgms
by
up
to
percent
if
nornickel
goes
ahead
with
the
two
new
projects
potanin
said
he
would
like
to
make
sure
the
company
s
dividend
payments
are
evenly
distributed
in
the
years
of
high
investment
while
remaining
the
same
in
total
over
the
next
years
the
environmental
programme
will
peak
in
he
said
there
were
no
immediate
plans
to
discuss
dividends
with
aluminium
giant
rusal
which
holds
percent
in
nornickel
potanin
owns
a
percent
stake
potanin
also
said
he
planned
to
introduce
the
maximum
amount
of
digital
technology
into
nornickel
which
could
help
it
get
a
bigger
slice
of
the
market
to
supply
electric
vehicles
ev
the
company
recently
agreed
to
join
forces
with
germany
s
basf
in
the
european
ev
battery
market
and
could
do
more
such
partnerships
in
other
markets
potanin
said
adding
there
were
no
concrete
negotiations
underway
nornickel
is
also
betting
on
palladium
used
in
auto
catalysts
for
gasoline
cars
amid
stricter
emissions
limits
prices
for
palladium
hit
a
record
high
in
london
on
friday
nornickel
and
russian
platinum
a
company
backed
by
russian
businessman
musa
bazhaev
are
considering
a
joint
project
called
arctic
palladium
which
could
become
one
of
the
world
s
largest
producers
of
pgms
the
cost
subject
to
a
feasibility
study
which
is
not
ready
yet
could
potentially
reach
billion
and
so
it
could
require
other
partners
potanin
said
a
decision
is
expected
in
the
second
half
