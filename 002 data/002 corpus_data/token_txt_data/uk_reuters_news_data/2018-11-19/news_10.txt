the
international
community
on

to
halt
iran
s
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programmes
and
reiterated
the
kingdom
s
support
for
efforts
to
end
the
war
in
yemen
the
king
s
annual
remarks
to
the
shura
council
a
top
governmental
advisory
body
were
his
first
public
comments
since
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
on
which
caused
a
global
outcry
king
salman
who
did
not
mention
the
khashoggi
affair
condemned
the
actions
of
iran
its
rival
for
influence
in
the
region
including
in
the
conflicts
in
syria
iraq
and
yemen
the
iranian
regime
has
always
intervened
in
the
internal
affairs
of
other
countries
sponsored
terrorism
created
chaos
and
devastation
in
many
countries
in
the
region
the
monarch
said
the
international
community
has
to
work
to
put
an
end
to
the
iranian
nuclear
programme
and
stop
its
activities
that
threaten
security
and
the
king
said
riyadh
supported
efforts
to
end
the
conflict
in
yemen
where
a
coalition
has
been
battling
houthi
rebels
for
nearly
four
years
to
restore
the
government
our
standing
by
yemen
was
not
an
option
but
a
duty
to
support
the
yemeni
people
in
confronting
the
aggression
of
militias
he
said
the
houthis
said
on
monday
they
were
halting
drone
and
missile
attacks
on
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
and
their
yemeni
allies
and
indicated
readiness
for
a
broader
ceasefire
if
the
coalition
wants
peace
riyadh
has
come
under
growing
international
criticism
for
its
conduct
of
the
yemen
war
which
has
brought
the
country
to
the
brink
of
famine
and
killed
many
civilians
in
air
strikes
the
reputation
of
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
top
oil
exporter
has
been
further
battered
by
khashoggi
s
murder
the
king
had
largely
stepped
back
from
active
political
life
and
handed
extensive
authority
to
his
son
and
heir
apparent
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
but
is
now
trying
to
defuse
the
crisis
caused
by
the
murder
and
shore
up
the
crown
prince
prince
mohammed
the
kingdom
s
de
facto
ruler
will
participate
in
the
summit
in
argentina
at
the
end
of
the
month
as
part
of
a
foreign
trip
al
arabiya
television
quoted
the
country
s
energy
minister
as
saying
on
monday
in
his
speech
king
salman
said
riyadh
would
continue
working
with
opec
and
oil
producers
to
maintain
stability
in
global
energy
markets
he
reaffirmed
saudi
support
for
a
palestinian
state
with
east
jerusalem
as
its
capital
a
position
thrown
into
question
last
year
when
the
crown
prince
appeared
to
back
a
nascent
peace
plan
that
aligns
with
israel
on
key
issues
later
on
monday
the
king
travelled
to
the
northern
tabuk
region
resuming
a
domestic
tour
in
the
latest
public
outreach
apparently
intended
to
show
support
for
his
chosen
heir
last
week
after
offering
numerous
contradictory
explanations
for
khashoggi
s
disappearance
riyadh
said
he
had
been
killed
and
his
body
dismembered
when
negotiations
to
convince
him
to
return
to
saudi
arabia
failed
the
public
prosecutor
said
it
would
seek
the
death
penalty
for
five
suspects
in
the
case
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
has
said
the
order
for
the
killing
of
khashoggi
came
from
the
highest
level
of
the
saudi
leadership
but
probably
not
from
king
salman
putting
the
spotlight
instead
on
the
crown
prince
president
donald
trump
has
suggested
ultimate
responsibility
lies
with
the
prince
as
de
facto
ruler
his
administration
has
imposed
economic
and
travel
restrictions
on
a
few
individuals
for
alleged
involvement
including
a
top
aide
to
prince
on
monday
the
king
signalled
that
the
crown
prince
remains
empowered
to
pursue
ambitious
economic
reforms
praising
a
comprehensive
developmental
transformation
underway
he
directed
his
son
sitting
in
the
hall
to
focus
on
preparing
the
new
generation
for
future
jobs
king
salman
also
praised
the
saudi
judiciary
and
prosecution
service
for
performing
the
duties
they
were
entrusted
with
without
elaborating
in
addition
to
the
khashoggi
case
the
public
prosecutor
has
participated
in
an
campaign
ordered
by
prince
mohammed
last
year
in
which
scores
of
princes
ministers
and
businessmen
were
arrested
and
the
state
said
it
recovered
billion
in
stolen
assets
