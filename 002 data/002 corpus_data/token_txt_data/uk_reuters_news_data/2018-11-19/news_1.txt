brazil
s
incoming

announced

at
the
indebted

latin
america
s

by
market
capitalization
castello
branco
s
appointment
is
the

in
a
string
of
selections
by
jair
bolsonaro
many
of
them
influenced
by
his
adviser
and
future
economy
minister
paulo
guedes
the
appointments
have
raised
hopes
among
investors
that
the
former
army
captain
who
takes
office
on
will
deliver
significant
reforms
needed
to
improve
brazil
s
creaking
public
finances
including
a

castello
branco
who
in
the
past
has
spoken
in
favor
of
privatizing
petrobras
on
monday
said
he
had
not
been
tasked
with
selling
off
the
company
but
signaled
his
intention
to
cut
costs
do
away
with
some
of
the
company
s
downstream
operations
and
focus
on
its
core
business
the
privatization
of
the
company
is
not
in
question
i
do
not
have
a
mandate
to
think
about
it
he
told
the
folha
de
paulo
newspaper
adding
that
he
expected
brazil
s
supreme
court
to
approve
a
path
enabling
the
company
to
continue
selling
assets
such
as
majority
stakes
in
two
blocks
of
refineries
and
in
a
gas
pipeline
company
in
an
earlier
interview
with
the
o
estado
de
paulo
newspaper
he
said
br
distribuidora
petrobras
fuel
distribution
unit
was
not
a
natural
fit
for
the
company
and
does
not
generate
returns
sending
its
shares
up
almost
percent
as
investors
bet
the
government
may
sell
its
percent
stake
in
the
unit
castello
branco
also
said
he
would
consider
all
current
asset
sales
including
that
of
liquid
petroleum
gas
distribution
company
liquigas
petrobras
competence
is
in
oil
exploration
and
production
he
told
the
newspaper
guedes
has
advocated
a
full
privatization
of
the
company
while
military
generals
around
bolsonaro
oppose
such
an
idea
underlining
that
tension
bolsonaro
told
reporters
on
monday
that
certain
units
of
petrobras
could
be
privatized
even
though
the
company
is
deemed
strategic
for
the
nation
castello
branco
a
fellow
at
the
university
of
chicago
will
join
other
school
alumni
in
the
ranks
of
the
incoming
administration
including
guedes
and
former
finance
minister
joaquim
levy
who
has
been
tapped
to
lead
brazil
s
powerful
state
development
bank
bndes
chicago
s
economics
department
has
long
been
known
for
orthodox
economics
particularly
in
latin
america
and
much
of
brazil
s
business
elite
is
enthused
by
the
prospect
of
appointees
in
top
posts
in
public
administration
we
basically
have
the
university
of
chicago
economics
department
taking
over
the
brazilian
economy
said
james
gulbrandsen
chief
investment
officer
for
latin
american
investments
at
nch
capital
welcoming
castello
branco
s
appointment
he
s
been
public
in
the
past
about
advocating
for
less
government
intervention
all
the
way
to
privatizing
parts
of
castello
branco
a
member
of
petrobras
s
board
until
has
also
held
executive
positions
at
brazil
s
central
bank
and
at
iron
ore
miner
vale
sa
we
expect
petrobras
deleveraging
process
and

program
to
continue
under
castello

tenure

bbi
wrote
in
a
note
to
clients
petrobras
which
is
burdened
by
some
billion
of
gross
debt
has
played
a
leading
role
in
developing
a
bonanza
of
oil
finds
in
recent
decades
castello
branco
told
folha
that
the
company
would
now
on
that
strategy
seeking
to
maximize
potential
of
the
area
we
need
to
seize
this
wealth
while
there
is
time
in
some
decades
oil
will
lose
the
relevance
it
has
today
he
said
petrobras
is
a
source
of
national
pride
for
many
brazilians
but
its
central
role
in
brazil
s
car
wash
investigation
considered
by
many
to
be
the
world
s
largest
corruption
probe
has
hurt
its
public
image
and
bottom
line
in
recent
years
preferred
shares
of
petrobras
rose
percent
after
experiencing
swings
during
the
day
while
brazil
benchmark
bovespa
index
fell
percent
bolsonaro
on
monday
said
that
petrobras
outgoing
boss
ivan
monteiro
could
go
to
banco
do
brasil
the
country
s
largest
although
no
decision
has
been
made
petrobras
said
monteiro
would
leave
