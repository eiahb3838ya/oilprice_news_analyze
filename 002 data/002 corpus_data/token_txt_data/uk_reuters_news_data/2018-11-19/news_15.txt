privately

hbp
paying
around
million
euros
million
a
year
which
helps
maintain
thousands
of
jobs
the
company
produced
million
tonnes
of
brown
coal
last
year
supplying
the
novaky
power

slovenske
elektrarne
said
this
year
that
extending
the
life
of
the
novaky

beyond
would
require
significant
investment
the
environment
ministry
says
the
plant
is
the
carbon
emitter
in
the
country
closing
the
mines
has
long
been
contentious

is
booming

potentially
giving
retrained

on
the
sidelines
of
an

it
does
not
mean
they
would
have
to
close

we
have
to
work
with
the
european
commission
to
show
people
alternatives
