azerbaijan
s
ilham
aliyev
is
expected
to
easily
win
for
seven
more
years
on
wednesday
in
a
vote
boycotted
by
major
opposition
parties
which
accuse
him
of
authoritarian
rule
and
suppressing
political
dissent
the
country
s
huge
energy
reserves
and
its
strategic
location
along
the
caspian
sea
means
it
is
viewed
by
europe
as
an
important
alternative
to
russian
energy
supplies
opposition
parties
say
they
are
staying
away
from
wednesday
s
vote
because
of
aliyev
s
sustained
crackdown
on
dissent
during
his
rule
and
because
they
say
the
results
will
be
rigged
the
aliyev
in
power
since
when
he
succeeded
his
father
and
his
supporters
deny
allegations
of
democratic
abuses
and
election
fraud
his
opponents
say
aliyev
benefits
too
from
only
muted
criticism
from
europe
because
of
his
country
s
perceived
strategic
value
and
the
risk
of
stirring
instability
in
the
region
aliyev
brought
forward
the
date
of
the
vote
to
april
from
a
move
his
allies
said
was
necessary
to
avoid
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
clashing
in
seven
other
candidates
are
running
in
wednesday
s
election
which
will
be
observed
by
international
monitors
including
the
organization
for
cooperation
and
security
in
europe
osce
but
critics
have
expressed
doubts
about
how
genuine
the
other
candidates
are

democratic
institutions
and
human
rights
interlocutors
said
they
do
not
expect
the
election
to
be
genuinely
competitive
claiming
that
those
who
stand
against
the
incumbent
in
this
election
either
do
not
present
a
political
alternative
or
even
actively
support
him
odihr

in

the
main
opposition
parties
say
the
vote
is
illegal
and
are
boycotting
it
we
are
certain
that
the
election
results
will
be
rigged
and
ilham
aliyev
will
be
announced

council

democratic
forces
the
azeri

told

after
taking
power
from
his
father
heydar
in
aliyev
cemented
his
position
with
two
referendums
one
in
which
scrapped
a
presidential
limit
and
another
in
which
extended
the
head
of
state
s
term
of
office
to
seven
years
from
five
the
opposition
say
these
steps
are
illegal
and
undemocratic
aliyev
has
tried
to
strike
a
balance
between
big
regional
power
russia
and
the
west
notably
on
energy
policy
his
rule
benefited
from
an
economic
boom
fuelled
by
oil
exports
but
a
slump
in
global
oil
prices
in
the
last
three
years
has
weakened
the
azeri
manat
currency
and
shrunk
the
economy
many
people
in
azerbaijan
are
struggling
on
low
incomes
and
amid
a
growing
gap
between
rich
and
poor
tensions
are
rising
with
neighbouring
armenia
over
a
territorial
conflict
that
caused
a
war

sure
that
the
election
results
do
not
depend
on
the
choices
of
voters
and
that

why
i

not
going
to
vote
