deputy
energy
minister
arcandra
tahar
said
president
joko
widodo
won
international
praise
and
sovereign
bond
rating
upgrades
for
southeast
asia
s
largest
economy
after
cutting
government
fuel
spending
by
more
than
percent
and
shifting
the
burden
of
petroleum
subsidies
to
pertamina
shortly
after
taking
office
in
but
indonesia
still
subsidises
some
fuels
and
the
government
said
in
march
it
would
cap
domestic
coal
prices
and
keep
fuel
and
electricity
prices
unchanged
until
the
end
of
an
election
year
widodo
s
latest
energy
policies
contrast
with
his
earlier
moves
to
eliminate
subsidies
and
have
raised
concerns
among
some
economists
fuel
prices
are
currently
set
by
retailers
but
under
a
planned
regulation
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
decide
whether
retailers
can
change
fuel
prices
tahar
told
reporters
on
monday
the
government
is
very
concerned
with
the
rate
of
inflation
he
added
referring
to
adjustments
to
fuel
prices
by
all
retailers
excluding
aviation
fuel
and
industrial
fuels
the
direction
from
the
president
was
that
fuel
price
increases
must
take
into
account
inflation
going
forward
tahar
said
referring
to
retail
fuels
the
government
plans
to
meet
retailers
and
issue
a
regulation
on
the
matter
as
quickly
as
possible
that
will
become
effective
immediately
he
said
susyanto
secretary
of
indonesia
s
oil
and
gas
directorate
said
that
under
the
proposed
regulation
every
time
there
s
an
increase
it
will
be
obligatory
to
obtain
prior
government
approval
indonesia
s
fuel
retailers
include
shell
total
akr
corporindo
and
energy
company
pertamina
a
second
regulation
would
soon
be
issued

improve
distribution
of

shortages
emerged
in
some
areas
tahar
said
a
spokesman
for

said
the
company
had
not
received

about
the
move
a
spokesman
for
shell
did
not
respond
to
a
written
request
for
comment
on
the
matter
the
government
s
concern
is
that
household
consumption
growth
remains
below
percent
below

for
indonesia
permata
bank
economist
joshua
pardede
said
referring
to
recent
central
government
data
the
hope
is
that
by
managing
administered
prices
it
can
boost
private
consumption
pardede
told
reuters
widodo
has
been
grappling
with
an
economy
that
has
refused
to
respond
to
conventional
policies
to
growth
that
could
dent
his
chances
in
especially
with
a
budget
that
won
t
stretch
to
lavish
government
spending
the
preliminary
conjecture
is
that
this
is
an
effort
to
save
widodo

electability
