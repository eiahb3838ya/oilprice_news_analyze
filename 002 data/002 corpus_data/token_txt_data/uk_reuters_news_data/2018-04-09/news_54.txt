kept

war
with
china
just
a
couple
of
days
before
president
xi
jinping
gives
a
keynote
speech
there
was
more
confusion
than
reaction
to
reports
forces
had
struck
at
sites
in
syria
reports
which
the
pentagon
quickly
denied
trump
said
on
sunday
there
would
be
a
big
price
to
pay
after
medical

groups
reported
dozens
of

were
killed

caution
had
been
the
watchword
after
trump
claimed
on
sunday
that
china
would
take
down
its
trade
barriers
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
trump
late
thursday
threatened
to
slap
billion
more
in
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
while
beijing
said
it
was
fully
prepared
to
respond
with
a
fierce
counter
strike
analysts
warned
the
drama
would
be
a
one
given
the
lengthy
public
discussion
period
on
tariff
proposals
meant
the
earliest
they
might
be
imposed
was
somewhere
around
late
july
or
early
august
this
is
not
going
to
happen
tomorrow
and
given
the
mercurial
nature
of
the
administration
the
whole
issue
could
well
disappear
before
anything
really
happens

global
many
market

trade
policy
is
in
the
hands
of
someone
totally
the
next
major
hurdle
will
be
a
speech

at
the
boao
forum

war

while
the

the

be
strong
enough
to
provide
fundamental
support
for
stocks
with
analysts
tipping
the
fastest
quarterly

growth
in

the
