ottawa

reuters
canada
s
liberal
government
is
under
pressure
to
push
through
the
expansion
of
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
from
the
alberta
oil
sands
to
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
but
the
company
said
it
would
scrap
plans
to
nearly
triple
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
s
capacity
unless
various
legal
challenges
could
be
resolved
by
may
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
federal
government
approved
the
project
why
has
this
issue
arisen
the
minority
new
democratic
government
in
british
columbia
citing
the
risks
of
a
major
spill
opposes
the
project
this
year
it
proposed
new
rules
to
temporarily
block
increased
shipments
of
crude
while
it
examined
oil
spill
preparedness
and
response
british
columbia
is
also
asking
the
provincial
courts
to
rule
on
whether
it
has
the
power
to
control
oil
shipments
on
environmental
grounds
who
has
jurisdiction
over
pipelines
while
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
to
grant
permits
for
major
pipelines
the
provinces
have
powers
over
natural
resource
development
ottawa
says
british
columbia
does
not
have
the
right
to
block
the
pipeline
the
provinces
guard
their
jurisdictions
and
federal
governments
tend
to
think
carefully
before
picking
fights
preferring
instead
to
rely
on
negotiations
what
has
the
federal
government
done
so
far
ottawa
has
taken
a
cautious
line
insisting
the
project
will
be
built
while
urging
british
columbia
to
back
down
trudeau
has
spoken
separately
to
british
columbia
premier
john
horgan
and
his
alberta
counterpart
rachel
notley
who
backs
the
expansion
and
is
threatening
sanctions
against
british
columbia
unless
it
reconsiders
what
can
trudeau
do
now
trudeau
asked
what
the
government
would
do
told
reporters
on
monday
that
ottawa
is
examining
a
range
of
options
but
gave
no
further
details
a
possible
step
is
for
trudeau
to
convene
a
meeting
between
horgan
and
notley
to
thrash
out
a
compromise
that
would
allow
kinder
morgan
to
restart
work
however
horgan
insists
he
will
not
change
his
mind
warren
mabee
an
environment
and
energy
expert
at
queen
s
university
in
kingston
ontario
said
trudeau
was
unlikely
to
be
too
forceful
especially
given
that
he
does
not
want
to
harm
the
prospects
of
federal
liberal
legislators
in
a
national
election
set
for
october
it
runs
the
risk
of
alienating
voters
in
british
columbia
and
i
don
t
think
this
government
is
prepared
to
do
that
he
said
by
phone
what
more
could
the
government
do
in
theory
at
least
ian
blue
a
lawyer
with
gardiner
roberts
and
an
expert
in
energy
and
constitutional
law
said
ottawa
could
warn
british
columbia
that
if
it
took
further
actions
under
provincial
laws
to
block
the
pipeline
the
federal
government
would
step
in
and
disallow
those
laws
this
provision
in
the
canadian
constitution
has
not
been
used
since
the
in
an
extreme
situation
using
an
article
in
the
criminal
code
the
government
could
deploy
the
royal
canadian
mounted
police
and
troops
to
maintain
a
barrier
between
protestors
and
construction
workers
ottawa
last
took
such
a
move
in
when
it
sent
in
troops
and
police
to
help
quell
an
aboriginal
protest
near
montreal
these
things
never
end
well
that
s
the
difficulty
with
them
the
question
is
how
much
do
you
want
get
the
pipeline
built
and
how
much
do
you
want
to
assert
federal
authority
blue
said
by
phone
what
else
could
delay
the
project
first
nations
bands
environmental
groups
and
local
municipalities
have
launched
a
legal
challenge
against
the
project
saying
canada
failed
in
its
duty
to
consult
them
hearings
at
the
federal
court
of
appeal
ended
in
october
and
there
is
no
firm
deadline
for
a
judgment
a
decision
in
a
similar
case
involving
an
enbridge
pipeline
project
took
about
eight
months
whichever
side
loses
would
most
likely
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
a
move
that
would
cause
lengthy
delays
