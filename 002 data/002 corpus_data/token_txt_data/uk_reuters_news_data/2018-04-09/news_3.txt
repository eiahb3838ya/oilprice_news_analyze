reuters
nigeria
s
president
muhammadu
buhari
confirmed
on
monday
he
will
seek
another
term
in
elections
next
year
ending
months
of
speculation
about
his
future
after
bouts
of
ill
health
the
said
he
would
seek
his
party
s
presidential
ticket
to
contest
elections
in
february
during
a
closed
door
meeting
of
the
national
executive
committee
of
his
all
progressives
congress
apc
party
he
flew
to
britain
for
talks
with
prime
minister
theresa
may
a
few
hours
later
the
announcement
by
buhari
a
northern
muslim
who
became
the
first
opposition
candidate
to
defeat
an
incumbent
at
the
ballot
box
was
widely
expected
although
stocks
on
the
nigerian
market
fell
percent
on
monday
to
a
low
it
takes
away
the
concern
of
an
open
race
which
would
have
fuelled
uncertainty
said
a
equity
sales
analyst
the
bond
market
shrugged
off
the
announcement
with
the
benchmark
debt
unchanged
at
percent
from
its
previous
session
after
one
trade
on
wednesday
traders
said
buhari
took
office
in
may
after
vowing
to
improve
security
and
crackdown
on
endemic
corruption
but
africa
s
top
oil
producer
fell
into
its
first
recession
in
years
in
largely
caused
by
low
crude
prices
and
militant
attacks
in
the
niger
delta
and
its
recovery
remains
fragile
after
spending
five
months
in
britain
last
year
being
treated
for
an
undisclosed
ailment
opposition
groups
in
africa
s
most
populous
nation
and
other
critics
said
he
was
unfit
for
office
and
his
administration
was
beset
by
inertia
if
buhari
is
selected
to
contest
the
presidential
election
it
is
not
clear
whom
he
would
face
the
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
which
prior
to
the
former
general
s
victory
had
held
power
since
nigeria
adopted
civilian
rule
in
has
yet
to
select
a
candidate
the
president
said
he
was
responding
to
the
clamour
by
nigerians
to
recontest
in
adding
that
he
wanted
to
give
nec
the
honour
of
notifying
them
first
buhari
s
spokesman
garba
shehu
said
in
an
emailed
statement
antony
goldman
of
pm
consulting
said
although
buhari
s
party
a
broad
coalition
of
groups
which
largely
united
to
oust
the
pdp
was
riven
by
divisions
it
was
nevertheless
likely
that
he
would
become
the
apc
candidate
with
the
pdp
weak
and
still
discredited
incumbency
is
still
a
powerful
factor
said
goldman
it
would
be
a
huge
surprise
if
he
was
not
the
apc
s
candidate
and
the
candidate
to
beat
in
goldman
added
atiku
abubakar
a
former
vice
president
and
erstwhile
buhari
ally
quit
the
apc
in
november
and
rejoined
the
pdp
he
is
the
most
high
profile
figure
to
say
he
is
prepared
to
run
in
the
pdp
in
a
statement
described
the
president
s
announcement
as
an
internal
affair
within
the
ruling
party
until
he
becomes
the
candidate
of
the
apc
we
will
not
spend
precious
time
on
his
mere
show
of
interest
said
spokesman
kola
ologbondiyan
nigeria
s
political
parties
must
select
their
presidential
election
candidates
by
buhari
led
a
military
regime
that
was
overthrown
in
a
coup
in
his
election
victory
three
years
ago
was
in
large
part
due
to
his
military
credentials
and
his
vow
to
end
the
islamist
militant
boko
haram
insurgency
the
insurgents
have
lost
most
of
the
territory
the
size
of
belgium
that
they
held
in
northeast
nigeria
in
late
but
continue
suicide
bomb
attacks
and
kidnappings
in
the
northeast
other
security
challenges
militant
attacks
in
the
niger
delta
oil
production
heartland
as
well
as
communal
violence
between
nomadic
herdsmen
and
settled
farmers
plus
a
resurgence
of
separatist
sentiments
have
flared
up
during
his
tenure
