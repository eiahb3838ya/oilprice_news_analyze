global
stocks
rose
on
monday
as
the
government
played
down
fears
of
a
trade
war
with
china
which
has
roiled
markets
over
the
last
week
the
two
countries
have
threatened
each
other
with
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
tariffs
but
officials
in
president
donald
trump
s
administration
have
stressed
the
tariffs
are
not
yet
in
place
and
the
dispute
could
be
resolved
through
talks
trump
s
chief
economic
adviser
national
economic
council
director
larry
kudlow
said
in
an
interview
on
sunday
the
ongoing
spat
might
turn
out
to
be
very
benign
on
sunday
trump
appeared
to
echo
this
tweeting
that
any
tariffs
would
be
reciprocal
and
that
he
saw
a
great
future
for
both
countries
msci

stocks
look
likely
to
continue
the
trend
with

to
a
pct
opening
rise
for
the
index
never
ending
escalation
is
not
guaranteed
as
china
has
shown
willingness
to
negotiate
in
recent
months
jpmorgan
analysts
said
also
noting
the
two
countries
made
significant
progress
on
trade
agreements
when
trump
visited
china
in
november
but
the
issue
could
dominate
markets
for
the
foreseeable
future
given
the
lengthy
public
discussion
period
on
tariff
proposals
mean
the
earliest
they
might
be
imposed
is
somewhere
around
late
july
or
early
august
this
is
not
going
to
happen
tomorrow
and
given
the
mercurial
nature
of
the
administration
the
whole
issue
could
well
disappear
before
anything
really
happens
acls
global
chief
strategist
marshall
gittler
said
many
market
participants
may
be
starting
to
think
that
this
is
just
a
lot
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
in
the
end
but
you
never
know
trade
policy
is
in
the
hands
of
someone
totally
the
next
big
focus
will
be
a
speech
by
chinese
president
xi
at
the
boao
forum
on
tuesday
russian
stock

the

both

after
the
united

russian

part
of
an
aggressive
round
of
new
sanctions
to
punish
moscow
for
a
range
of
activities

alleged
meddling
