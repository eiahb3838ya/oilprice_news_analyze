the
revised
billion
bid
by
harbour
energy
for
australian
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
producer
santos
ltd
looks
at
first
glance
like
a
winning
hand
but
it
s
still
probably
got
the
odds
stacked
against
it
the
private
equity
firm
s
fourth
bite
at
the
santos
cherry
since
august
last
year
values
the
company
at
a
percent
premium
to
the
close
on
april
and
is
percent
higher
than
the
first
attempt
recognising
that
this
is
a
serious
bid
santos
board
has
decided
to
engage
further
with
harbour
the
company
said
in
a
statement
to
shareholders
this
is
sensible
but
shareholders
should
consider
whether
they
want
to
sell
out
just
as
santos
is
finally
starting
to
reap
the
benefits
of
its
investments
and
the
prospects
for
further
improvement
are
getting
brighter
the
harbour
offer
values
santos
at
a
a
share
a
level
the
company
last
traded
at
in
july
at
a
time
when
the
price
of
lng
and
crude
oil
was
falling
putting
the
company
under
pressure
just
as
its
massive
gladstone
lng
plant
in
australia
s
queensland
state
was
starting
up
when
santos
was
last
at
a
a
share
brent
crude
oil
was
around
a
barrel
and
the
spot
price
of
asian
lng
was
about
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
these
prices
matter
for
the
bid
as
the
bulk
of
santos
revenue
is
either
in
lng
contracts
spot
lng
prices
or
in
crude
for
the
company
s
small
oil
output
brent
crude
ended
last
week
at
a
barrel
and
spot
lng
was
about
per
mmbtu
although
it
s
worth
bearing
in
mind
that
lng
prices
typically
are
weakest
during
the
shoulder
seasons
between
the
winter
and
summer
peak
demand
periods
spot
lng
prices
surged
to
per
mmbtu
in
early
january
the
highest
in
more
than
three
years
as
china
bought
additional
cargoes
to
meet
winter
demand
while
future
spot
lng
prices
are
uncertain
the
chances
are
that
china
will
continue
to
boost
its
imports
as
part
of
efforts
to
reduce
the
use
of
polluting
coal
for
winter
heating
on
crude
oil
the
success
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
in
draining
global
inventories
and
boosting
prices
has
led
to
a
market
consensus
that
prices
are
more
likely
to
rise
than
fall
over
the
medium
term
this
means
that
santos
is
likely
to
receive
higher
revenues
for
its
lng
from
the
gladstone
plant
and
its
share
in
lng
operations
in
darwin
and
papua
new
guinea
as
well
as
for
its
domestic
natural
gas
and
oil
output
in
australia
it
s
these
revenue
streams
that
harbour
energy
is
eyeing
and
it
must
be
taking
the
view
that
santos
share
price
has
yet
to
reflect
the
brighter
medium
and
longer
term
outlook
for
this
reason
the
revised
offer
may
not
quite
be
enough
especially
if
santos
existing
major
shareholders
and
the
analysts
they
rely
on
start
to
the
stock
in
line
with
expectations
for
higher
crude
and
lng
prices
the
santos
share
price
did
kick
higher
on
the
new
harbour
energy
bid
jumping
more
than
percent
after
the
revised
offer
but
at
its
close
of
a
on
april
it
s
still
some
way
below
the
indicative
value
of
the
offer
rather
than
reflect
that
harbour
energy
is
overpaying
this
likely
shows
that
investors
don
t
believe
the
bid
will
clear
the
regulatory
hurdles
in
its
way
the
deal
will
be
subject
to
australia
s
foreign
investment
review
board
which
may
have
concerns
about
a
key
domestic
oil
and
gas
producer
falling
into
foreign
hands
even
if
the
board
does
greenlight
the
deal
the
chances
are
that
the
liberal
federal
government
of
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
will
decline
final
approval
domestic
energy
policy
is
a
hot
button
issue
in
australia
with
consumers
and
industry
angry
and
disillusioned
at
sharply
rising
prices
for
electricity
and
natural
gas
any
suggestion
that
a
private
equity
company
buying
santos
would
somehow
be
bad
for
consumers
and
industry
would
put
tremendous
pressure
on
a
government
that
is
trailing
the
opposition
labor
party
in
opinion
polls
and
it
wouldn
t
be
hard
to
make
such
an
argument
as
it
s
likely
that
harbour
energy
is
focused
on
the
lng
jewels
in
the
santos
crown
and
not
that
interested
in
developing
domestic
natural
gas
supply
also
a
deal
carries
the
risk
of
massive
with
related
job
losses
another
issue
that
would
be
exceedingly
touchy
in
adelaide
a
city
still
reeling
from
the
loss
of
australia
s
motor
car
assembly
plants
these
factors
make
it
unlikely
that
harbour
energy
s
offer
will
get
over
the
line
at
least
in
its
current
form
it
s
possible
that
it
could
win
political
approval
if
harbour
energy
agrees
to
whatever
conditions
are
placed
on
the
deal
but
it
s
also
possible
that
santos
shareholders
may
want
the
offer
sweetened
