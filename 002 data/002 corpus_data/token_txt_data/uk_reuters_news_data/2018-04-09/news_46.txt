global
stocks
rose
on
monday
as
the
government
played
down
fears
of
a
trade
war
with
china
that
has
roiled
markets
over
the
last
week
the
two
countries
have
threatened
each
other
with
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
of
tariffs
but
officials
in
president
donald
trump
s
administration
have
stressed
the
tariffs
are
not
yet
in
place
and
the
dispute
could
be
resolved
through
talks
trump
s
chief
economic
adviser
national
economic
council
director
larry
kudlow
said
in
an
interview
on
sunday
the
ongoing
spat
might
turn
out
to
be
very
benign
in
a
twitter
post
on
sunday
trump
appeared
to
echo
this
saying
any
tariffs
would
be
reciprocal
and
that
he
saw
a
great
future
for
both
countries
msci
s
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
percent
helped
by
europe
s
benchmark
stoxx
index
that
rose
percent
never
ending
escalation
is
not
guaranteed
as
china
has
shown
willingness
to
negotiate
in
recent
months
said
analysts
at
jpmorgan
who
also
noted
the
two
countries
made
significant
progress
on
trade
agreements
when
trump
visited
china
in
november
but
the
issue
could
dominate
markets
for
the
foreseeable
future
given
the
lengthy
public
discussion
period
on
tariff
proposals
mean
the
earliest
they
might
be
imposed
was
somewhere
around
late
july
or
early
august
this
is
not
going
to
happen
tomorrow
and
given
the
mercurial
nature
of
the
administration
the
whole
issue
could
well
disappear
before
anything
really
happens
said
marshall
gittler
chief
strategist
at
acls
global
many
market
participants
may
be
starting
to
think
that
this
is
just
a
lot
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
in
the
end
but
you
never
know
trade
policy
is
in
the
hands
of
someone
totally
the
next
major
hurdle
will
be
a
speech
by
chinese
president
xi
at
the
boao
forum
on
tuesday
russian
stock
indexes
and
the
rouble
both
fell
on
monday
after
the
united
states
hit
russian
companies
and
officials
as
part
of
an
aggressive
round
of
new
sanctions
to
punish
moscow
for
a
range
of
activities
including
alleged
meddling
in
the
election
the
rts
stock
market
index
was
down
percent
its
worst
single
day
in
over
a
year
while
the
rouble
was
percent
weaker
