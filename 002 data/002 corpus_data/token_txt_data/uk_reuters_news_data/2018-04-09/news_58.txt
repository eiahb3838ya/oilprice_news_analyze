a
couple
of
days
before

a
little
was
news
north

had
told
the

for
the
first
time
that
it
was
prepared
to
discuss

caution
remained
the

said
it
was
fully
prepared

analysts
warned
the
drama
would
be
a
one
given
the
lengthy
public

period
on

proposals
meant
the
earliest
they
might
be
imposed
was
somewhere
around
