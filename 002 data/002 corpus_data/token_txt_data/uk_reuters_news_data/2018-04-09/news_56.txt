kinder

canada
on
sunday
suspended
most
work
on
a
c
billion
billion
oil
pipeline
expansion
that
has
become
the
focus
of
protests
a
move
underscoring
uncertainty
over
major
energy
projects
in
canada
company
chairman
steve
kean
said
he
would
scrap
plans
to
nearly
triple
the
capacity
of
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
which
takes
crude
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
to
a
facility
in
the
pacific
province
of
british
columbia
unless
the
various
legal
challenges
could
be
resolved
by
may
the
announcement
was
a
blow
to
the
liberal
government
of
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
which
approved
the
project
and
says
it
is
in
the
national
interest
the
project
considered
crucial
for
an
oil
industry
hit
by
transportation
bottlenecks
is
fiercely
opposed
by
british
columbia
s
new
democratic
government
many
municipalities
some
aboriginal
groups
and
environmental
activists
concerned
about
possible
oil
spills
we
will
be
judicious
in
our
use
of
shareholder
funds
in
keeping
with
that
commitment
we
have
determined
that
in
the
current
environment
we
will
not
put
kml
shareholders
at
risk
on
the
remaining
project
spend
kean
said
in
a
statement
the
firm
is
currently
carrying
out
preliminary
work
and
has
not
started
construction
many
in
the
energy
industry
are
concerned
about
whether
any
new
pipelines
can
be
built
in
canada
which
sits
on
the
world
s
third
largest
proven
reserves
of
crude
and
is
the
single
largest
exporter
of
energy
to
the
united
states
although
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
approve
major
pipelines
the
provinces
enjoy
broad
responsibility
for
resource
development
that
can
result
in
deadlock
when
a
province
opposes
a
decision
made
by
ottawa
this
is
not
good
i
think
the
key
point
is
it
shows
a
lack
of
confidence
in
our
political
and
regulatory
system
said
tim
pickering
president
of
auspice
capital
in
calgary
alberta
last
october
transcanada
corp
abandoned
its
c
billion
energy
east
pipeline
from
alberta
to
the
atlantic
coast
amid
mounting
regulatory
hurdles
the
inability
to
get
oil
to
ports
for
export
means
canadian
crude
has
been
trading
at
a
discount
of
up
to
a
barrel
this
year
costing
alberta
s
heavy
oil
producers
c
million
to
c
million
in
revenue
per
day
federal
natural
resources
minister
jim
carr
said
in
a
statement
that
with
all
our
partners
we
continue
to
consider
all
available
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
said
she
was
very
optimistic
the
project
would
go
ahead
and
repeated
calls
on
trudeau
s
government
to
do
more
to
ensure
it
would
be
built
alberta
is
prepared
to
be
an
investor
in
the
pipeline
if
we
take
that
step
we
will
be
a
significantly
more
determined
investor
this
pipeline
will
be
built
she
told
reporters
trudeau
visited
the
oil
sands
on
friday
and
reiterated
the
government
s
determination
that
the
expansion
go
ahead
british
columbia
s
government
proposed
environmental
rules
this
year
that
were
seen
as
a
direct
attack
on
the
project
it
later
edged
back
from
a
pledge
to
block
increased
shipments
of
crude
oil
through
the
province
which
had
sparked
a
trade
war
with
alberta
british
columbians
expect
their
government
to
stand
up
for
their
interests
and
our
coast
and
to
do
everything
we
can
to
protect
our
land
and
waters
our
coastal
communities
and
our
local
economies
premier
john
horgan
said

a
statement
mike
hudema
climate
campaigner
with
greenpeace
canada
said
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
and
even
kinder
morgan
can
read
it
investors
should
note
that
the
opposition
to
this
project
is
strong
deep
and
gets
bigger
