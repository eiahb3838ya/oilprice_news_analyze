april
reuters
ukraine
s
energy
firm
naftogaz
will
go
to
court
to
try
to
seize
gazprom
s
assets
in
europe
after
the
russian
energy
firm
failed
to
make
a
payment
ordered
by
an
international
tribunal
naftogaz
s
deputy
chief
said
on
monday
gazprom
is
refusing
to
pay
naftogaz
more
than
billion
under
a
stockholm
arbitration
ruling
meant
to
conclude
a
long
legal
battle
that
has
run
alongside
ukraine
s
broader
political
with
russia
for
us
it
s
clear
that
they
won
t
do
that
pay
so
we
will
start
arresting
their
gas
and
other
assets
of
gazprom
in
europe
not
in
ukraine
we
will
go
to
courts
in
europe
natogaz
s
chief
commercial
officer
yuri
vitrenko
told
reuters
in
brussels
however
naftogaz
will
not
seek
to
seize
russian
gas
transiting
through
ukraine
to
european
clients
he
added
saying
we
don
t
want
to
create
any
kind
of
political
ambiguity
here
in
the
eu
that
ukraine
is
not
a
reliable
transit
gazprom
is
appealing
against
the
stockholm
ruling
and
is
seeking
to
cancel
a
gas
transit
contract
with
ukraine
escalating
a
dispute
which
the
european
union
says
could
threaten
gas
flows
naftogaz
said
it
expected
talks
with
gazprom
later
this
week
to
be
the
last
before
it
files
fresh
complaints
with
the
stockholm
arbitration
tribunal
among
other
issues
it
wants
compensation
for
gazprom
s
refusal
to
supply
gas
this
winter
the
eu
and
western
clients
had
hoped
the
stockholm
arbitration
would
resolve
one
of
the
many
thorny
disputes
between
kiev
and
moscow
instead
the
two
sides
are
raising
the
stakes
amid
tricky
discussions
over
future
gas
transits
through
ukraine
when
the
current
contract
expires
at
the
end
of
vitrenko
said
it
was
likely
gazprom
would
entirely
halt
gas
flows
through
ukraine
them
through
two
major
new
pipelines
to
the
north
and
south
it
is
absolutely
likely
that
in
there
will
be
no
transits
through
ukraine
and
gazprom
will
be
okay
in
terms
of
meeting
their
minimal
contractual
obligations
he
said
we
know
that
mr
putin
wants
to
punish
ukraine
and
that
s
why
he
