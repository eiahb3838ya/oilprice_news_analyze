analysis-high u.s. natgas storage draws raise alarm for coming seasons
reuters
natural
gas
prices
could
rise
in
after
utilities
pulled
the
second
biggest
amount
of
gas
from
storage
on
record
over
the
winter
even
though
the
season
was
slightly
warmer
than
normal
that
left
total
stockpiles
about
percent
below
usual
at
the
end
of
the
heating
season
on
march
and
will
require
companies
to
add
percent
more
gas
than
usual
into
storage
this
summer
just
to
get
inventories
back
to
normal
levels
before
next
winter
some
analysts
think
the
market
is
putting
too
much
weight
on
rising
production
to
refill
inventories
this
year
and
is
not
worried
enough
about
a
projected
increase
in
domestic
demand
and
exports
we
feel
the
current
market
has
become
far
too
complacent
and
that
prices
are
simply
too
low
to
account
for
demand
growth
and
the
amount
of
gas
needed
in
storage
for
the
next
winter
heating
season
martin
king
director
institutional
research
at
gmp
firstenergy
in
calgary
said
in
a
recent
report
prices
for
gas
at
the
henry
hub
benchmark
in
louisiana
have
averaged
less
than
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
since
versus
more
than
over
the
prior
years
and
are
expected
to
remain
below
through
at
least
based
on
current
futures
trading
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
if
prices
were
to
stay
at
their
current
level
over
the
course
of
the
summer
that
would
boost
coal
to
gas
switching
we
see
prices
having
to
move
closer
to
this
summer
in
order
to
lower
these
power
burn
levels
and
allow
adequate
storage
refills
ahead
of
winter
analysts
at
barclays
a
bank
said
in
a
recent
note
electric
companies
can
switch
between
burning
more
gas
or
coal
in
power
plants
depending
on
which
fuel
is
cheaper
utilities
likely
pulled
billion
cubic
feet
bcf
of
gas
from
inventories
during
the
heating
season
according
to
a
poll
of
analysts
by
reuters
the
most
since
the
polar
vortex
winter
of
and
the
second
highest
on
record
one
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
is
enough
to
supply
about
million
homes
for
a
day
analysts
forecast
total
inventories
by
the
end
of
october
the
start
of
the
next
heating
season
will
rise
to
bcf
compared
with
bcf
last
year
a
level
that
should
be
of
increasing
concern
to
the
market
king
at
gmp
firstenergy
said
if
the
amount
of
gas
in
storage
on
is
below
normal
a
cold
winter
could
cut
inventories
to
below
bcf
by
the
end
of
march
that
would
be
the
smallest
amount
of
gas
in
storage
since
the
end
of
march
despite
expected
record
production
dry
gas
production
is
projected
to
rise
to
an
high
of
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
bcfd
in
but
consumption
is
also
expected
to
hit
an
high
of
bcfd
in
with
exports
rising
to
record
highs
as
well
it
does
not
leave
a
lot
of
extra
gas
to
go
into
storage
