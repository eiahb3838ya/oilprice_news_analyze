preview-u.n. shipping agency under pressure to tackle growing co2 emissions
london
reuters
the
united
nations
shipping
agency
is
under
pressure
this
week
to
agree
on
a
plan
to
cut
carbon
emissions
from
the
sector
following
years
of
slow
progress
but
the
strategy
could
fall
well
short
of
what
is
required
to
limit
global
warming
the
shipping
sector
along
with
aviation
avoided
specific
emissions
cut
targets
in
a
global
climate
pact
agreed
at
the
end
of
which
aims
to
limit
a
global
average
rise
in
temperature
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
from
shipping
accounts
for
percent
of
world
emissions
according
to
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
the
agency
responsible
for
regulating
pollution
from
ships
this
is
around
the
amount
emitted
by
germany
according
to
the
latest
eu
data
available
and
is
predicted
to
grow
significantly
if
left
unchecked
the
european
commission
estimates
that
air
and
marine
transportation
could
contribute
as
much
as
a
third
of
all
emissions
by
the
imo
is
meeting
in
london
this
week
to
develop
a
initial
strategy
to
cut
emissions
a
final
plan
is
not
expected
until
the
strategy
should
include
a
global
emissions
reduction
goal
for
the
sector
which
is
in
line
with
temperature
limits
agreed
under
the
global
climate
deal
and
a
list
of
and
measures
to
ensure
this
goal
is
met
a
spokesman
for
the
european
commission
said
eu
countries
along
with
the
marshall
islands
support
a
goal
of
cutting
emissions
by
to
percent
by
compared
with
levels
norway
has
proposed
a
percent
cut
by
while
another
proposal
backed
by
japan
which
is
also
chairing
this
week
s
talks
and
other
countries
aims
for
a
percent
cut
by
these
targets
would
not
be
ambitious
enough
to
keep
global
temperature
rise
to
well
below
degrees
c
some
environmental
groups
and
countries
argue
countries
such
as
brazil
saudi
arabia
and
panama
are
also
opposed
to
the
eu
s
proposal
of
a
loftier
target
sources
say
a
report
by
the
oecd
s
transport
think
tank
international
transport
forum
last
week
said
the
maritime
sector
could
be
fully
by
as
early
as
the
percent
reduction
proposal
from
some
european
countries
is
unlikely
to
achieve
broad
support
said
the
chairman
of
the
international
chamber
of
shipping
ics
which
represents
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
merchant
fleet
while
ics
does
not
fully
agree
with
them
in
every
respect
alternative
proposals
made
by
china
and
japan
merit
serious
consideration
and
could
form
the
basis
of
a
possible
compromise
said
ics
chairman
esben
poulsson
the
marshall
islands
the
second
largest
flag
registry
in
the
world
is
one
of
the
countries
most
vulnerable
to
climate
change
its
environment
minister
david
paul
said
on
monday
there
was
simply
no
credible
reason
to
hesitate
any
longer
the
imo
has
adopted
mandatory
rules
for
new
vessels
to
boost
fuel
efficiency
as
a
means
of
cutting
from
ship
engines
there
have
been
discussions
for
years
on
wider
cuts
but
progress
has
been
slow
prompting
calls
for
potential
unilateral
measures
to
be
taken
at
regional
or
national
level
imo
kitack
lim
said
last
week
postponing
the
adoption
of
the
initial
strategy
to
a
future
session
should
not
be
an
option
imo
members
have
set
themselves
a
deadline
to
adopt
the
initial
strategy
at
this
week
s
meeting
but
they
could
still
postpone
it
to
a
later
meeting
if
no
decision
is
reached
this
week
is
really
crucial
for
the
credibility
of
imo
said
member
of
the
european
parliament
bas
eickhout
in
a
report
by
research
group
influencemap
released
on
monday
if
this
week
they
fail
again
countries
will
have
to
take
their
own
actions
he
added
influencemap
said
japan
represented
potentially
the
largest
obstruction
to
an
ambitious
climate
policy
at
the
imo
despite
backing
a
slightly
less
negative
position
as
compared
to
brazil
panama
and
argentina
japan
has
opposed
binding
ghg
greenhouse
gas
targets
