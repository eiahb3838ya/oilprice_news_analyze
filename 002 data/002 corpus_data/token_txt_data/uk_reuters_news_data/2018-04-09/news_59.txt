obesity
rates
among
children
in
are
rising
at
a
rapid
rate
and
more
action
is
needed
to
encourage
healthier
lifestyles
and
ease
pressure
on
fledgling
healthcare
systems
researchers
said
the
number
of
overweight
children
under
five
rose
percent
between
and
in
the
region
and
the
problem
is
growing
said
sridhar
dharmapuri
a
food
safety
and
nutrition
officer
at
the
s
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
in
bangkok
the
rate
of
growth
in
obesity
in
is
higher
than
in
many
other
countries
dharmapuri
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
while
the
united
states
leads
the
way
on
obesity
rates
the
number
of
overweight
children
in
is
rising
rapidly
and
many
countries
in
this
region
are
now
among
the
most
in
the
adult
obesity
rates
are
highest
in
the
united
states
mexico
new
zealand
and
hungary
and
lowest
in
japan
and
south
korea
according
to
a
report
on
member
states
by
the
organization
for
economic
and
development
but
the
rapid
rise
in
obesity
among
young
people
in
is
worrying
because
overweight
children
are
at
higher
risk
of
becoming
obese
as
adults
and
then
developing
serious
health
problems
like
type
diabetes
high
blood
pressure
and
liver
disease
malaysia
indonesia
singapore
and
thailand
are
among
the
most
overweight
countries
in
southeast
asia
while
samoa
tonga
and
nauru
are
the
most
overweight
in
the
pacific
australia
also
has
high
rates
of
obesity
many
of
these
nations
are
also
struggling
to
tackle
malnutrition
among
their
citizens
the
cost
to
the
region
of
citizens
being
overweight
or
obese
is
billion
a
year
a
recent
report
by
the
asian
development
bank
institute
adbi
said
rising
wealth
levels
over
the
last
years
have
played
a
major
role
in
the
rise
in
obesity
levels
researchers
say
the
region
has
undergone
economic
growth
so
food
has
become
available
at
a
relatively
cheaper
price
said
matthias
helble
an
economist
at
the
adbi
in
tokyo
for
the
last
years
the
economic
growth
has
been
almost
uninterrupted
said
helble
who
has
researched
obesity
levels
in
the
region
for
three
years
the
obesity
time
bomb
will
be
discussed
by
the
member
governments
attending
the
fao
conference
for
asia
and
the
pacific
which
starts
in
fiji
from
monday
in
addition
to
consuming
more
as
economies
have
grown
people
in
have
moved
away
from
farming
into
manufacturing
and
then
to
service
sector
jobs
which
are
more
sedentary
researchers
said
cities
in
have
also
seen
unprecedented
growth
over
the
last
two
decades
this
year
more
than
half
the
region
s
population
will
for
the
first
time
be
urban
the
united
nations
has
estimated
in
can
spend
hours
commuting
due
to
poor
transport
systems
and
infrastructure
and
when
they
finally
reach
home
they
have
little
time
to
cook
many
opt
to
eat
out
this
new
lifestyle
has
caused
a
rise
in
the
consumption
of
convenience
and
processed
foods
which
often
contain
excess
fats
and
more
salt
and
sugar
researchers
said
people
in
the
region
also
struggle
to
maintain
a
balanced
diet
said
dharmapuri
with
meals
often
lacking
vegetables
the
diet
is
largely
he
said
on
anybody
s
plate
rice
takes
up
between
percent
of
the
when
people
are
overweight
they
often
suffer
from
other
health
problems
economists
said
and
this
is
likely
to
put
pressure
on
public
healthcare
systems
that
are
only
just
being
established
in
many
nations
absenteeism
from
work
is
also
higher
among
obese
people
said
helble
adding
that
overweight
people
often
die
earlier
than
those
who
lead
healthy
lives
so
have
a
shorter
productive
life
the
term
obesogenic
environment
has
been
used
to
describe
an
environment
that
promotes
obesity
among
individuals
and
populations
elizabeth
ingram
of
the
australian
institute
of
health
and
welfare
a
government
statistics
agency
said
by
email
it
includes
physical
economic
political
and
sociocultural
fixing
the
problem
will
likely
take
years
and
researchers
said
a
joint
effort
by
business
and
governments
was
needed
better
labeling
on
foods
to
promote
healthier
options
education
about
healthier
diets
and
lifestyles
and
even
healthier
school
meals
would
improve
the
situation
analysts
said
being
obese
can
also
be
seen
as
a
sign
of
prosperity
because
you
have
enough
food
to
show
your
wealth
through
the
fact
that
you
have
a
lot
to
eat
said
helble
sugar
taxes
which
have
been
introduced
or
are
being
discussed
in
the
philippines
singapore
and
indonesia
are
also
one
way
to
change
people
s
mindset
he
added
building
more
sports
facilities
at
schools
and
ensuring
urban
planners
include
recreational
areas
for
cities
and
make
them
more
walkable
and
less
polluted
is
also
crucial
governments
must
work
with
retailers
like
in
singapore
to
create
a
coordinated
approach
on
packaging
and
promote
a
balanced
diet
researchers
said
working
with
retailers
to
ban
unhealthy
and
sweet
foods
from
checkout
areas
and
pushing
street
vendors
to
switch
from
fried
foods
to
healthier
more
traditional
options
are
also
key
and
countries
should
adopt
a
farm
to
fork
approach
which
encourages
farmers
to
diversify
what
they
grow
and
be
less
reliant
on
growing
just
rice
said
dharmapuri
in
some
pacific
island
countries
it
actually
easier
to
buy
soft
drinks
and
processed
foods
than
buy
fruits
and
vegetables
said
dharmapuri
it
almost
a
delicacy
to
have
a
vegetable
in
a
restaurant
