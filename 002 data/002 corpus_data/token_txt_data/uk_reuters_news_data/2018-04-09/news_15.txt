reuters
fund
managers
have
begun
to
ditch
fang
stocks
that
powered
the
stock
market
to
record
highs
in
january
and
are
slowly
rotating
into
shares
and
other
value
stocks
which
typically
outperform
in
recoveries
portfolio
managers
holding
shares
of
facebook
inc
inc
netflix
inc
and
alphabet
inc
say
they
are
increasingly
concerned
that
the
data
scandal
that
has
sent
shares
of
facebook
down
nearly
percent
will
spill
over
into
all
of
the
fang
stocks
imperiling
the
broad
market
s
momentum
at
a
time
when
there
are
no
clear
companies
or
sectors
to
take
their
place
on
tuesday
an
index
which
tracks
the
fang
stocks
along
with
six
other
technology
stocks
tumbled
percent
the
biggest
decline
since
september
facebook
rose
as
much
as
percent
in
early
trading
wednesday
before
falling
into
the
red
one
day
after
sources
told
reuters
that
chief
executive
mark
zuckerberg
plans
to
testify
before
congress
dropped
percent
while
netflix
fell
percent
alphabet
was
slightly
positive
there
are
legitimate
concerns
over
the
business
models
of
these
companies
and
i
expect
that
they
will
be
ironed
out
in
legislation
that
will
likely
eat
into
their
profit
margins
said
michael
cuggino
a
portfolio
manager
of
the
permanent
portfolio
funds
cuggino
who
would
not
say
whether
he
was
selling
any
of
his
shares
in
facebook
said
that
commodity
and
industrial
stocks
look
more
attractive
now
given
rising
inflation
and
continued
global
economic
growth
each
fang
company
rose
more
than
percent
last
year
helping
power
the
s
p
to
a
nearly
gain
yet
those
gains
have
left
the
broad
s
p
trading
at
a
high
trailing
ratio
of
leaving
it
overpriced
despite
a
boost
to
margins
from
the
corporate
tax
cut
at
the
end
of
rising
volatility
and
changing
market
leadership
are
now
pointing
towards
the
possible
conclusion
that
the
stock
market
peaked
in
late
january
said
douglas
kass
president
of
seabreeze
capital
management
the
s
p
is
now
down
percent
for
the
year
and
down
nearly
percent
below
the
high
of
it
reached
on
fund
managers
say
that
the
high
valuation
of
fang
stocks
and
the
likelihood
of
regulation
are
pushing
them
into
traditional
value
stocks
like
energy
and
defense
companies
connor
browne
a
portfolio
manager
at
thornburg
investment
management
said
that
he
sold
his
shares
of
netflix
and
last
year
after
both
companies
blew
through
his
price
targets
he
used
those
gains
instead
to
increase
positions
in
energy
stocks
such
as
pipeline
operator
enterprise
products
partners
lp
and
crude
oil
shipping
company
overseas
shipholding
group
inc
that
stand
to
benefit
from
the
recovery
in
the
price
of
oil
we
noticed
that
in
all
of
this
excitement
over
the
fangs
taking
over
the
world
there
are
parts
of
the
economy
that
seem
really
out
of
favor
and
offer
more
compelling
opportunities
he
said
even
after
the
selloff
fang
stocks
continue
to
trade
at
higher
valuations
than
the
broad
market
netflix
trades
at
a
of
and
trades
at
a
of
facebook
and
alphabet
both
of
which
have
been
directly
linked
with
privacy
concerns
now
trade
at
valuations
near
lows
the
overhang
of
increased
government
oversight
has
sunk
the
fortunes
of
large
technology
companies
in
the
past
microsoft
corp
reached
a
settlement
in
an
antitrust
case
with
the
department
of
justice
in
that
lasted
until
contributing
to
a
long
period
of
underperformance
that
kept
the
stock
below
the
high
it
reached
in
until
since
then
the
stock
is
up
nearly
percent
on
the
strength
of
its
services
margaret
patel
a
senior
portfolio
manager
at
wells
fargo
funds
said
that
she
has
been
adding
to
defense
stocks
like
raytheon
co
that
should
benefit
from
increasing
military
spending
in
both
the
and
overseas
at
the
same
time
she
is
increasing
her
exposure
of
technology
stocks
like
adobe
systems
inc
and
microsoft
that
have
been
hurt
by
the
recent
in
the
sector
it
s
very
hard
to
see
another
sector
that
still
has
all
the
fundamental
drivers
for
growing
much
faster
than
any
other
sector
