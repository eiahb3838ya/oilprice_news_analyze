until
the

it

a

experts
say
arbitration
disputes
which
are
held
in

often
take
years
to
resolve
but
can
also
be
withdrawn
quickly
if
a
deal
is
reached
privately
neconde
energy
last
week
said
it
purchased
its
stake
in
oml
following
a
competitive
bidding
round
and
made
no
payments
to
a
former
shell
employee
or
other
companies
to
facilitate
the
purchase
a
shell
spokesperson
said
the
decision
to
file
a
criminal
complaint
against
its
former
employee
over
the
sale
was
unconnected
to
the
arbitration
case
neconde
s
ceo
also
said
the
company
was
under
significant
pressure
to
keep
up
with
payments
to
banks
and
was
holding
talks
to
restructure
its
debt
and
raise
equity
we
are
looking
for
between
million
and
million
said
edozie
adding
that
the
energy
firm
was
dealing
with
a
consortium
of
lenders
he
said
financiers
on
the
oml
acquisition
included
international
lenders
africa
finance
corp
fbn
bank
uk
glencore
and
afrexim
guaranty
trust
bank
diamond
bank
fidelity
bank
and
access
bank
were
domestic
banks
in
the
mix
edozie
said
the
company
had
been
in
talks
with
lenders
to
refinance
its
loans
we
are
in
the
market
for
debt
then
we
are
on
a
journey
to
proof
of
the
asset
he
added
edozie
said
crude
production
at
the
oilfield
stood
at
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
it
aimed
to
increase
that
to
bpd
by
the
end
of
he
said
the
company
had
recently
decided
to
transport
crude
by
barge
because
of
the
disruption
caused
by
pipeline
vandalism
by
militants
in
the
southern
niger
delta
first
in
and
later
in
nigeria
s
forcados
terminal
is
ramping
up
after
a
temporary
shutdown
on
the
trans
forcados
pipeline
shell
said
on
friday
we
lost
production
due
to
downtime
therefore
we
felt
that
we
are
better
off
barging
than
putting
our
crude
in
the
pipeline
