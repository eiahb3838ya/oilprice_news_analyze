slipped

as

in

while
the

consolidated
recent

after
the
federal

reaffirmed
the

for
more

talks

and

liu
he
are
due
to
kick
off
later
on
thursday
however
a
breakthrough
was
viewed
as
highly
unlikely

as

said
their

would

bucked

not

an

japan

firmer
wall
street
had
wobbled
on
wednesday
as
the
threat
of
restrictions
on
chinese
telecom
companies
fuelled
investor
concerns
about
worsening
trade
relations
the
fed
policy
meeting
ended
with
no
change
as
expected
while
the
central
bank
expressed
confidence
a
recent
rise
in
inflation
to
near
target
would
be
sustained
leaving
it
on
track
to
raise
borrowing
costs
in
june
the
statement
carried
only
modest
changes
in
wording
but
they
were
meaningful
nonetheless
highlighting
that
the
fed
is
optimistic
on
the
outlook
and
intent
on
continuing
to
raise
rates
at
a
gradual
pace
said
westpac
analyst
elliot
clarke
yet
the
fed
also
emphasised
the
inflation
target
was
symmetric
suggesting
it
was
not
inclined
to
speed
up
its
tightening
plans
the
fed
sees
little
reason
to
be
concerned
with
inflation
marginally
above
its
percent
target
particularly
after
such
a
long
period
of
underperformance
clarke
said
westpac
like
the
market
expects
two
more
hikes
this
year
the
fed
statement
was
not
quite
as
hawkish
as
some
had
wagered
on
and
caused
a
dip
in
the
dollar
though
sentiment
remained
bullish
given
rates
were
still
clearly
heading
higher
while
those
in
europe
and
japan
lagged
far
behind
the
euro
was
last
at
having
hit
a
trough
at
on
wednesday
uncomfortably
close
to
the
low
for
the
year
at
the
dollar
also
scored
a
peak
on
the
yen
at
overnight
before
edging
back
to
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
was
trading
at
after
reaching
the
highest
since
late
december
at
in
the
treasury
market
yields
dipped
slightly
as
a
quarterly
refunding
programme
of
billion
came
in
short
of
expectations
reducing
the
pressure
on
prices
from
the
torrent
of
supply
oil
prices
inched
higher
with
brent
crude
futures
up
cents
to
a
barrel
while
crude
added
cent
to
spot
gold
was
up
percent
at
