pressure
restrictions
on
transcanada
corp
s
keystone
oil
pipeline
were
lifted
on
tuesday
in
a
letter
issued
by
pipeline
safety
regulators
a
spokesman
for
the
agency
told
reuters
on
thursday
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
current
flow
rates
are

the
company
in
november
shut
down
its
keystone
pipeline
which
links
alberta
s
oil
sands
to
refineries
after
a
spill
in
south
dakota
and
was
ordered
later
that
month
to
operate
at
reduced
pressure
reduced
flows
on
the
pipeline
had
helped
draw
down
inventories
in
the
cushing
oklahoma
storage
hub
a
return
to
full
capacity
on
the
line
is
also
expected
to
help
relieve
a
bottleneck
in
the
province
of
alberta
where
increased
output
has
run
up
against
a
shortage
of
pipeline
and
rail
capacity
the
restrictions
really
did
have
a
minor
impact
on
our
throughput
and
so
consequently
i
don
t
anticipate
seeing
a
tremendous
increase
in
our
throughput
once
it
s
lifted
based
on
some
of
the
changes
we
ve
made
already

paul
miller
said
on
a
conference
call
last
week
a
spokesman
for
transcanada
said
the
restrictions
in
place
were
limited
to
a
small
section
of
the
pipeline
and
had
been
lifted
we
don
t
expect
to
see
significant
additional
volumes
on
keystone
matthew
john
a
spokesman
for
transcanada
said
in
an
emailed
statement
on
thursday
as
of
pressure
restrictions
were
in
place
only
from
the
pipeline
s
luverne
pump
station
to
ludden
pump
station
and
on
the
segment
that
had
the
leak
between
ludden
to
ferney
pump
stations
near
amherst
south
dakota
the
phmsa
letter
showed
on
april
transcanada
requested
that
the
remaining
pressure
restrictions
on
the
pipeline
be
lifted
and
phmsa
approved
the
request
effective
on
tuesday
they
ve
been
moving
historical
volumes
with
dra
agents
just
makes
it
easier
for
them
to
operate
now
