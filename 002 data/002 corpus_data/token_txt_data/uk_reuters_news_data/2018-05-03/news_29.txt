the
green
climate
fund
set
up
to
help
developing
countries
tackle
climate
change
could
seek
to
refill
its
coffers
in
a
year
which
is
likely
to
see
a
huge
amount
of
attention
on
climate
finance
said
the
fund
s
executive
director
howard
bamsey
a
former
australian
diplomat
said
the
fund
could
reach
the
trigger
point
for
its
replenishment
process
later
this
year
if
the
share
of
available
funds
it
has
allocated
for
projects
reaches
percent
the
fund
began
making
investment
decisions
in
with
pledges
from
donor
governments
of
billion
but
it
is
expected
to
receive
only
about
billion
of
that
after
president
donald
trump
a
climate
change
sceptic
who
plans
to
pull
out
of
the
paris
climate
accord
indicated
he
would
not
make
good
on
the
remaining
billion
of
the
billion
promised
by
his
predecessor
bamsey
said
the
fund
had
not
been
formally
notified
it
would
not
receive
the
full
contribution
but
if
the
money
were
not
available
it
would
limit
what
the
fund
could
achieve
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
are
waiting
for
the
next
step
from
washington
he
said
climate
finance
is
expected
to
come
under
the
spotlight
next
year
at
talks
which
established
the
green
climate
fund
rich
countries
have
promised
to
raise
billion
a
year
in
climate
finance
from
both
public
and
private
sources
by
to
help
developing
countries
tackle
global
warming
poorer
nations
are
seeking
reassurances
that
target
will
be
met
the
chief
is
also
holding
a
climate
summit
in
where
the
subject
is
likely
to
be
high
on
the
agenda
so
far
the
green
climate
fund
has
agreed
to
provide
about
billion
to
finance
projects
to
help
developing
countries
shift
to
clean
energy
and
adapt
to
the
impacts
of
climate
change
such
as
more
extreme
weather
and
rising
seas
bamsey
said
a
further
billion
for
projects
could
be
approved
at
meetings
this
year
bringing
the
total
close
to
billion
and
pushing
the
start
button
to
replenish
the
fund
the
fund
s
board
which
has
members
balanced
between
developed
and
developing
countries
has
yet
to
agree
on
the
process
and
whether
to
set
a
target
amount
bamsey
said
the
fund
would
likely
seek
at
least
billion
and
the
board
could
also
decide
to
widen
its
pool
of
donors
now
limited
to
governments
to
include
philanthropists
and
others
that
have
shown
interest
in
contributing
i
think
we
re
in
a
good
position
for
replenishment
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
on
energy
access
in
lisbon
our
projects
are
getting
better
and
better
and
countries
want
more
and
more
and
so
you
ve
got
a
very
good
opportunity
here
where
funding
can
be
used
extremely
well
to
help
solve
the
climate
bamsey
said
he
thought
the
projects
being
submitted
for
backing
were
gradually
becoming
more
in
line
with
the
fund
s
mandate
to
be
transformational
he
cited
a
recently
approved
project
led
by
the
world
bank
to
develop
financial
instruments
to
improve
energy
efficiency
in
brazilian
cities
and
a
initiative
managed
by
the
acumen
fund
to
build
markets
for
solar
in
east
africa
by
investing
in
small
providers
he
said
the
green
climate
fund
had
become
better
known
around
the
world
though
not
in
all
sectors
a
lot
of
the
energy
community
know
very
little
about
the
green
climate
fund
yet
he
added
saying
efforts
were
being
made
at
the
conference
to
introduce
it
to
renewable
energy
companies
working
in
africa
and
asia
bamsey
said
his
team
was
focused
on
helping
poorer
countries
improve
their
ability
to
tap
into
different
international
climate
funds
the
fragmented
nature
of
climate
finance
is
a
problem
for
many
but
the
funds
are
working
together
to
present
a
more
coherent
picture
to
governments
he
said
the
aim
is
to
help
countries
identify
the
bigger
projects
needed
to
meet
their
national
targets
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
and
to
become
more
resilient
to
climate
change
effects
and
then
build
those
projects
bamsey
said
we
still
learning
and
we
got
a
real
long
way
to
go
before
we
optimal
but
i
think
we
are
doing
much
better
