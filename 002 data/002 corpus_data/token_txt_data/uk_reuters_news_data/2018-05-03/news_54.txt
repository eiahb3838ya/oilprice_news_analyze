column-climate resolution at rio meeting heralds coming climate avalanche: russell

australia
reuters
it
may
not
sound
like
a
lot
but
the
percent
of
rio
tinto
shareholders
that
voted
in
favour
of
a
resolution
that
effectively
called
on
the
company
to
do
more
to
address
climate
change
have
launched
a
snowball
at
the
top
of
a
large
mountain
the
vote
at
rio
s
may
annual
general
meeting
called
upon
the
world
s
mining
company
to
review
its
membership
of
the
minerals
council
of
australia
mca
and
other
lobby
groups
while
the
vote
was
easily
defeated
it
sends
a
very
clear
message
to
natural
resource
companies
that
investors
are
going
to
be
paying
more
attention
to
environmental
credentials
in
the
future
the
percent
support
was
said
by
the
resolution
s
lead
sponsor
brynn
o
brien
of
the
australasian
centre
for
corporate
responsibility
to
be
the
highest
vote
ever
on
a
similar
issue
the
sydney
morning
herald
reported
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
among
the
supporters
of
the
resolution
were
life
assurers
such
as
aegon
and
legal
general
as
well
as
pension
funds
like
the
church
of
england
pensions
board
investors
such
as
these
make
up
the
backbone
of
institutional
shareholders
of
companies
such
as
rio
tinto
and
the
clear
trend
in
recent
years
has
been
toward
calling
on
company
boards
to
be
clearer
in
their
commitment
to
the
health
of
the
global
environment
for
its
part
rio
defended
its
climate
stance
with
new
chairman
simon
thompson
acknowledging
that
the
company
s
exit
from
coal
mining
has
been
partially
driven
by
climate
change
concerns
but
he
also
said
rio
preferred
to
engage
with
groups
such
as
the
mca
rather
than
walk
out
over
differences
in
climate
change
policies
but
as
can
be
seen
from
bhp
s
recent
decision
to
leave
the
world
coal
association
it
s
becoming
increasingly
hard
for
mining
companies
that
are
trying
to
nurture
progressive
public
images
to
remain
engaged
with
groups
that
promote
fossil
fuels
and
are
often
sceptical
of
scientific
evidence
that
burning
such
fuels
contributes
to
climate
change
in
some
ways
targeting
rio
is
a
tad
odd
given
the
company
recently
completed
its
exit
from
coal
mining
with
the
billion
sale
in
march
of
its
kestrel
mine
in
australia
s
queensland
state
rio
unlike
bhp
decided
that
coal
was
no
longer
a
fit
for
its
portfolio
and
took
advantage
of
strong
prices
for
the
polluting
fuel
to
sell
its
portfolio
of
mines
it
s
inevitable
that
companies
that
remain
in
coal
mining
especially
those
with
listings
in
developed
countries
such
as
bhp
glencore
and
anglo
american
will
face
rising
shareholder
pressure
this
will
make
it
harder
for
companies
to
develop
or
expand
coal
mines
and
related
infrastructure
facilities
which
is
the
obvious
aim
of
the
environmental
groups
and
their
supporters
the
struggles
of
indian
conglomerate
adani
enterprises
to
build
its
planned
carmichael
mine
in
queensland
and
export
the
coal
through
its
existing
abbot
point
terminal
is
a
case
in
point
despite
having
all
the
necessary
government
approvals
and
claimed
customers
for
the
coal
adani
has
so
far
been
unable
to
attract
financing
for
the
project
in
fact
the
carmichael
mine
looks
increasingly
unlikely
to
be
developed
as
political
support
starts
to
wane
in
australia
with
queensland
s
labor
state
government
ruling
out
support
and
the
liberal
party
of
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
which
backs
the
mine
behind
in
the
polls
ahead
of
next
year
s
likely
election
coal
s
difficulties
are
also
amplified
by
policies
in
the
two
major
importing
nations
china
and
india
china
wants
to
use
less
of
the
fuel
in
order
to
improve
air
quality
and
india
wants
to
import
less
in
order
to
improve
its
current
account
balance
however
it
s
dreadful
pollution
may
well
result
in
more
stringent
environmental
policies
in
the
future
the
irony
of
the
success
of
activism
and
stricter
environmental
rules
is
that
coal
is
likely
to
become
a
scarcer
commodity
demand
for
seaborne
supplies
is
likely
to
increase
in
coming
years
because
of
investment
decisions
made
in
previous
years
to
build
plants
particularly
in
asia
but
it
s
becoming
harder
to
see
countries
being
able
to
boost
output
given
political
challenges
in
top
shipper
australia
and
diversion
of
exports
to
local
demand
in
number
two
exporter
indonesia
coal
prices
have
responded
to
this
by
remaining
robust
with
the
newcastle
weekly
index
a
benchmark
for
australian
thermal
coal
ending
at
a
tonne
on
april
the
straight
week
it
has
been
above
the
level
perhaps
the
final
irony
for
coal
is
that
it
is
dying
but
its
going
to
be
a
profitable
death
for
those
who
can
stick
it
out
to
the
end

opinions
expressed
here
are
