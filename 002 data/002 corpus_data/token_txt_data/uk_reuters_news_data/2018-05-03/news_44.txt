in u.s. gulf, robots, drones take on dangerous offshore oil work

s
massive
thunder
horse
oil
platform
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
robot
called
maggie
uses
magnetic
tracks
to
creep
along
pipes
connecting
the
giant
oil
facility
to
the
sea
floor
before
magghd
dubbed
maggie
by
bp
the
dangerous
inspection
job
was
reserved
for
highly
paid
specialist
technicians
who
did
their
jobs
while
rappelling
along
the
platform
the
energy
industry
has
turned
to
robots
and
drones
to
cut
costs
and
improve
safety
in
some
of
the
world
s
tougher
working
environments
drones
inspect
gear
high
up
on
floating
rigs
robots
crawl
underwater
to
test
subsea
equipment
for
microscopic
metal
cracks
remotely
operated
mini
submarines
can
replace
divers
big
oil
producers
such
as
bp
and
statoil
are
racing
to
create
the
oilfields
of
the
future
where
smart
devices
replace
workers
they
have
the
potential
to
cut
costs
save
lives
and
reduce
the
scope
for
human
error
this
is
going
to
change
the
way
oil
and
gas
does
business
carri
lockhart
senior
vice
president
of
offshore
at
statoil
usa
said
in
an
interview
earlier
this
year
referring
to
the
push
towards
autonomous
gear
and
facilities
maggie
belongs
to
a
group
of
devices
known
as
magnetic
crawlers
which
can
move
across
rigs
platforms
and
pipelines
above
and
below
water
using
ultrasonic
test
devices
and
cameras
they
can
cost
pounds
apiece
bp
the
largest
operator
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
piloted
maggie
on
its
thunder
horse
platform
last
year
and
expects
to
roll
out
similar
crawlers
across
all
its
gulf
of
mexico
platforms
in
coming
years
bp
s
deepwater
horizon
rig
explosion
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
killed
people
and
was
the
largest
accidental
release
of
oil
into
marine
waters
underscored
the
dangers
of
offshore
work
bp
wants
the
robots
to
remove
individuals
from
being
in
unsafe
environments
the
efficiencies
we
gain
by
collecting
data
this
way
are
significant
the
safety
factor
is
obvious
said
dave
truch
a
technology
director
in
bp
s
digital
innovation
organization
drones
and
crawlers
can
do
inspections
in
about
half
the
time
of
rope
access
technicians
while
placing
fewer
workers
in
harm
s
way
executives
at
bp
said
this
week
other
gadgets
can
reduce
the
need
for
shutdowns
which
are
sometimes
necessary
for
safe
inspection
of
equipment
by
humans
drones
can
conduct
inspections
of
flaring
equipment
which
burn
off
dangerous
gases
at
oil
and
gas
production
facilities
without
requiring
a
shutdown
those
shutdowns
could
last
anywhere
from
five
to
days
said
iain
gault
a
business
development
manager
at
stork
an
energy
maintenance
unit
of
fluor
we
still
can
t
do
the
physical
work
with
a
drone
or
crawler
but
the
efficiency
is
gained
by
only
putting
people
in
the
field
when
needed
said
gault
who
started
his
career
in
oil
and
gas
as
a
rope
access
technician
rappelling
along
the
sides
of
oil
structures
in
the
north
sea
nearly
years
ago
the
technology
can
be
a
hard
sell
because
of
the
high
upfront
cost
he
added
estimating
crawler
rentals
run
between
to
per
day
excluding
the
cost
of
an
operating
technician
hiring
technicians
for
drones
is
even
more
costly
because
they
require
pilot
s
licenses
he
added
companies
that
provide
the
inspection
specialists
for
offshore
equipment
say
they
are
not
worried
about
losing
out
to
robots
and
gadgets
it
is
not
a
threat
to
jobs
but
they
change
we
have
to
adapt
said
ryan
king
a
technical
sales
representative
for
oceaneering
international
an
offshore
services
and
equipment
provider
we
re
at
a
point
now
where
big
data
is
helping
optimise
inspection
programs
so
we
don
t
have
to
send
guys
into
the
field
king
said
drones
and
crawlers
may
be
a
stepping
stone
norwegian
oil
producer
statoil
is
eying
an
unmanned
remotely

concept
noble

work
the
companies
said
paves
the
way
for
an
autonomous
drilling
fleet
we
have
the
technology
it
s
just
a
matter
of
getting
these
projects
executed
we
re
not
there
yet
on
unmanned

for

it
s
coming
