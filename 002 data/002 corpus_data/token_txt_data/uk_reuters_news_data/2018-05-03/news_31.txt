world
stocks
made
little
progress
on
thursday
as
worries
over
global
trade
tensions
weighed
while
the
dollar
consolidated
recent
bumper
gains
after
the
federal
reserve
reaffirmed
the
outlook
for
more
rate
hikes
the
msci
world
equity
index
which

traded
flat
in
percentage
terms
europe
s
stoxx
index
was
down
percent
as
the
euro
held
firm
as
the
fed
policy
meeting
threw
up
no
surprises
with
rates
left
unchanged
the
focus
shifted
back
to
simmering
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
china
as
well
as
the
ongoing
first
quarter
earnings
season
in
europe
earnings
disappointments
from
medical
technology
company
smith
nephew
and
postal
services
provider
bpost
soured
the
mood
as
the
stocks
fell
percent
and
percent
respectively
while
german
drug
and
crop
chemicals
maker
bayer
flagged
a
stronger
euro
in
its
update
futures
for
the
s
p
traded
flat
with
overnight
results
from
kraft
heinz
tesla
and
spotify
in
focus
so
far
it
has
been
a
strong
earnings
season
with
the
blended
earnings
growth
estimate
coming
in
at
more
than
percent
in
the
first
quarter
for
s
p
companies
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
while
the
equivalent
figure
for
the
msci
emu
index
european
economic
and
monetary
union
is
percent
in
dollar
terms
the
negative
mood
carried
over
from
the
asian
trading
session
where
shares
slipped
as
hopes
waned
for
real
progress
in
trade
talks
following
reports
the
trump
administration
is
considering
executive
action
to
restrict
some
chinese
companies
ability
to
sell
telecoms
equipment
in
the
united
states
the
risk
at
the
moment
is
that
the
increasing
uncertainty
could
create
ambiguity
in
executives
heads
it
makes
corporate
more
difficult
and
then
leads
to
a
decline
in
investment
alastair
george
chief
investment
strategist
at
edison
investment
research
said
edison
s
george
added
that
the
impact
from
trade
tensions
was
hypothetical
at
the
moment
though
talks
between
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
and
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
are
due
to
kick
off
later
on
thursday
however
a
breakthrough
was
viewed
as
highly
unlikely
especially
as
the
embassy
said
the
delegation
would
leave
as
early
as
friday
evening
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
while
south
korean
stocks
stumbled
percent
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
ended
percent
lower
but
chinese
shares
bucked
the
trend
the
blue
chip
csi
was
up
percent
but
not
far
from
an
low
hit
in
april
the
fed
policy
meeting
ended
with
no
change
as
expected
while
the
central
bank
expressed
confidence
a
recent
rise
in
inflation
to
near
target
would
be
sustained
leaving
it
on
track
to
raise
borrowing
costs
in
june
the
statement
carried
only
modest
changes
in
wording
but
they
were
meaningful
nonetheless
highlighting
that
the
fed
is
optimistic
on
the
outlook
and
intent
on
continuing
to
raise
rates
at
a
gradual
pace
said
westpac
analyst
elliot
clarke
yet
the
fed
also
emphasised
the
inflation
target
was
symmetric
suggesting
it
was
not
inclined
to
speed
up
its
tightening
plans
the
fed
sees
little
reason
to
be
concerned
with
inflation
marginally
above
its
percent
target
particularly
after
such
a
long
period
of
underperformance
clarke
said
westpac
like
the
market
expects
two
more
hikes
this
year
the
fed
statement
was
not
quite
as
hawkish
as
some
had
wagered
on
and
caused
a
dip
in
the
dollar
though
sentiment
remained
bullish
given
rates
were
still
clearly
heading
higher
while
those
in
europe
and
japan
lagged
far
behind
the
euro
was
last
at
having
hit
a
trough
at
on
wednesday
close
to
the
low
for
the
year
at
the
single
currency
trimmed
gains
after
euro
zone
inflation
unexpectedly
slipped
in
april
while
euro
zone
bond
yields
hit
lows
germany
s
bund
yield
fell
to
percent
below
highs
hit
last
week
the
dollar
also
scored
a
peak
on
the
yen
at
overnight
before
edging
back
to
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
was
trading
at
after
reaching
the
highest
since
late
december
at
oil
prices
retreated
with
brent
crude
futures
slipped
down
to
a
barrel
while
crude
was
at
spot
gold
was
up
percent
at
an
ounce
