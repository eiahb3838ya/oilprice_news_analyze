pending
further
assessment
of
the
most
recently
identified
keyway
root
cracks
inspections
confirmed
the
expected
presence
of
new
keyway
root
cracks
in
the
reactor
core
and
also
identified
these
happening
at
a
slightly
higher
rate
than

edf
energy
said
in
a

edf
energy
has
decided
that
while
hunterston
b
reactor
could
return
to
operation
from
the
current
outage
it
will
remain
offline
while
the
company
works
with
the
regulator
to
ensure
that
the
longer
term
safety
case
reflects
the
findings
of
the
recent

includes
the
results
obtained
from
other
analysis

hunterston
b
in
north
ayrshire
scotland
has
been
generating
electricity
since
last

it
produced
enough
electricity
for
million

are
being
decommissioned
during
the
time
it

edf
might
carry
out
additional
planned
routine
maintenance
it

energy
s
outage
website
is
showing
an
expected
return
date
of
the
extended

will
result
in
a
reduction
of
its

of
terrawatt
hours
the
company
said
the
operation
of
edf
energy
s
remaining
nuclear
reactors
in
britain
is
not
affected
edf
energy
will
need
onr
s
permission
to
restart
the
reactor
and
onr
will
assess
the
adequacy
of
