asian
shares
were
subdued
on
thursday
ahead
of
trade
talks

nikkei

closed

while
futures
for
the
s
p
barely
budged
wall
street
had
wobbled
on
wednesday
as
potential
restrictions
on
chinese
telecom
companies
reinforced
investor
concerns
about
worsening
trade
relations
the
dow
ended
down
percent
while
the
s
p
also
lost
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
fed
policy
meeting
ended
with
no
change
as
expected
while
the
central
bank
expressed
confidence
a
recent
rise
in
inflation
to
near
target
would
be
sustained
leaving
it
on
track
to
raise
borrowing
costs
in
june
the
statement
carried
only
modest
changes
in
wording
but
they
were
meaningful
nonetheless
highlighting
that
the
fed
is
optimistic
on
the
outlook
and
intent
on
continuing
to
raise
rates
at
a
gradual
pace
said
westpac
analyst
elliot
clarke
yet
the
fed
also
emphasised
the
inflation
target
was
symmetric
suggesting
it
was
not
inclined
to
speed
up
its
tightening
plans
the
fed
sees
little
reason
to
be
concerned
with
inflation
marginally
above
its
percent
target
particularly
after
such
a
long
period
of
westpac
like
the
market
expects
two
more
hikes
this
year
the
statement
was
not
quite
as
hawkish
as
some
had
wagered
on
and
caused
a
dip
in
the
dollar
but
the
move
was
brief
as
rates
were
still
clearly
heading
higher
while
those
in
europe
and
japan
lagged
far
behind
the
euro
was
the
biggest
loser
dropping
to
a
trough
at
it
was
last
pinned
at
and
threatening
the
low
for
the
year
so
far
at
the
dollar
also
scored
a
peak
on
the
yen
at
before
edging
back
to
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
index
touched
the
highest
since
late
december
at
and
was
last
at
in
the
treasury
market
yields
dipped
slightly
as
a
quarterly
refunding
program
of
billion
came
in
short
of
expectations
reducing
the
pressure
on
prices
from
the
torrent
of
supply
oil
prices
slipped
with
the
market
cautious
ahead
of
the
may
deadline
for
the
to
ratify
the
iran
nuclear
deal
reuters
reported
president
donald

has
all
but
decided

withdraw
from

nuclear

but
exactly
how
he
will
do
so
remains
unclear
