new
york
s
power
grid
operator
on
thursday
forecast
that
demand
for
power
from
the
system
will
decline
over
the
next
decade
due
to
efficiency
programs
and
as
more
homes
and
businesses
generate
their
own
electricity
on
site
the
new
york
independent
system
operator
nyiso
the
grid
operator
projected
power
demand
would
decline
at
a
rate
of
percent
per
year
through
annual
electric
usage
in
fell
to
its
lowest
level
since
according
to
the
nyiso
in
demand
peaked
at
megawatts
mw
which
was
percent
below
s
peak
of
mw
and
percent
below
the
record
peak
of
in
one
megawatt
can
power
about
homes
at
the
same
time
that
demand
for
power
from
the
grid
is
declining
the
nyiso
said
the
state
s
generation
mix
is
changing
as
energy
companies
build
mostly
natural
units
downstate
and
mostly
wind
farms
update
while
coal
and
nuclear
plants
retire
since
nearly
mw
of
generation
has
retired
leaving
just
mw
in
and
those
units
are
expected
to
shut
or
be
repowered
into
units
in
due
to
state
carbon
dioxide
emission
restrictions
the
nyiso
said
the
two
reactors
at
entergy
corp
s
indian
point
nuclear
power
plant
in
westchester
county
north
of
new
york
city
will
shut
in
and
under
a
deal
between
the
company
and
the
state
the
nyiso
said
the
grid
will
remain
reliable
after
the
units
shut
as
new
sources
of
mostly
generation
enter
service
the
nyiso
said
it
expects
about
mw
of
renewable
generation
to
enter
service
over
the
next
decade
or
so
to
help
meet
the
state
s
goal
requiring
percent
of
the
energy
consumed
come
from
renewable
sources
by
in
renewable
sources
of
generation
like
hydro
wind
and
solar
power
accounted
for
about
percent
of
the
energy
produced
in
the
state
with
all
the
changes
expected
the
nyiso
said
it
will
have
to
use
price
signals
to
reward
flexible
units
like
gas
plants
that
can
also
burn
oil
for
times
when
gas
or
renewable
sources
of
generation
may
not
be
available
as
can
happen
on
the
coldest
winter
days
when
consumers
use
most
of
the
available
gas
to
heat
their
homes
and
businesses
