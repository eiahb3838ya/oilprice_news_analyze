a
reactor
at
edf
energy
s
hunterston
b
nuclear
power
plant
in
scotland
will
remain
offline
for
additional
safety
checks
after
cracks
were
found
in
its
core
britain
s
office
for
nuclear
regulation
onr
said
ageing
reactors
generate
just
over
percent
of
britain
s
power
but
almost
half
of
this
capacity
including
hunterston
is
due
to
go
offline
by
prompting
the
government
to
plan
new
plants
onr
was
informed
in
march
about
keyway
root
cracks
found
during
planned
inspections
of
graphite
bricks
in
the
core
of
reactor
at
hunterston
graphite
bricks
ensure
reactors
can
be
cooled
and
thousands
of
them
are
used
in
reactor
cores
inspections
confirmed
the
expected
presence
of
new
keyway
root
cracks
in
the
reactor
core
and
also
identified
these
happening
at
a
slightly
higher
rate
than
modelled
edf
energy
said
in
a
statement
the
reactor
has
been
offline
since
march
and
was
due
to
come
back
online
this
month
but
edf
energy
has
extended
the
outage
until
later
this
year
while
hunterston
b
reactor
could
return
to
operation
from
the
current
outage
it
will
remain
offline
while
the
company
works
with
the
regulator
to
ensure
that
the
longer
term
safety
case
reflects
the
findings
of
the
recent
inspections
and
includes
the
results
obtained
from
other
analysis
and
modelling
it
said
hunterston
b
in
north
ayrshire
scotland
has
been
generating
electricity
since
last
year
it
produced
enough
electricity
for
million
homes
in
edf
energy
said
routine
inspections
had
revealed
cracks
in
part
of
the
graphite
core
at
a
hunterston
b
nuclear
reactor
it
said
three
of
bricks
had
cracked
something
that
had
been
expected
to
begin
happening
at
that
point
in
the
power
station
s
life
two
of
edf
energy
s
nuclear
power
plants
in
britain
heysham
and
hartlepool
were
offline
for
months
in
for
inspections
after
a
crack
was
found
on
a
boiler
spine
at
heysham
in
belgium
the
regulator
ordered
production
to
be
stopped
at
two
nuclear
reactors
in
after
finding
indications
of
tiny
cracks
in
core
tanks
the
cracks
turned
out
to
be
particles
of
hydrogen
that
were
trapped
inside
the
tanks
when
they
were
made
by
a
dutch
company
in
the
early
edf
said
it
expects
hunterston
b
s
reactor
to
return
to
service
before
the
end
of
edf
energy
s
outage
website
shows
an
expected
return
date
of
its
reactor
and
reactor
are
both
advanced
reactors
the
outage
will
reduce
its
output
by
terawatt
hours
the
company
said
edf
energy
said
the
operation
of
its
other
uk
reactors
was
not
affected
