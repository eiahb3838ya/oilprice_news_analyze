grief
over
the
hundreds
of
brazilians
feared
lost
in
a
mining

on
friday
has
quickly
hardened
into
anger
as
victims
families
and
politicians
say
iron
ore
miner
vale
sa
and
regulators
have
learned
nothing
from
the
recent
past
by
sunday
night
firefighters
in
the
state
of
minas
gerais
had
confirmed
dead
after
a
tailings
dam
broke
sending
a
torrent
of
sludge
into
the
miner
s
offices
and
the
town
of
brumadinho
some
others
are
unaccounted
for
and
officials
said
the
odds
were
slim
that
any
would
be
found
alive
the
disaster
at
the
corrego
do
feijao
mine
came
less
than
four
years
after
a
dam
collapsed
at
a
nearby
mine
run
by
samarco
mineracao
sa
a
joint
venture
by
vale
and
bhp
billiton
killing
and
filling
a
major
river
with
toxic
sludge
while
the
samarco
disaster
dumped
about
five
times
more
mining
waste
friday
s
dam
break
was
far
more
deadly
as
the
wall
of
mud
hit
vale
s
local
offices
including
a
crowded
cafeteria
and
tore
through
a
populated
area
downhill
the
cafeteria
was
in
a
risky
area

said
while
searching
for
his
twin
brother
a
vale
employee
at
an
emergency
response
station
just
to
save
money
even
if
it
meant
losing
the
little
guy
these
businessmen
they
only
think
about
chief
executive
fabio
schvartsman
said
facilities
were
built
to
code
and
equipment
had
shown
the
dam
was
stable
two
weeks
earlier
i
m
not
a
mining
technician
i
followed
the
technicians
advice
and
you
see
what
happened
it
didn
t
work
schvartsman
said
we
are
percent
within
all
the
standards
and
that
didn
t
do
many
wondered
if
the
state
of
minas
gerais
named
for
the
mining
industry
that
has
shaped
its
landscape
for
centuries
should
have
higher
standards
there
are
safe
ways
of
mining
said
joao
vitor
xavier
head
of
the
mining
and
energy
commission
in
the
state
assembly
it
s
just
that
it
diminishes
profit
margins
so
they
prefer
to
do
things
the
cheaper
way
and
put
lives
at
german
auditor
tuv
sud
said
on
saturday
it
inspected
the
dam
in
september
and
found
all
to
be
in
order
blowback
from
the
disaster
could
threaten
the
plans
of
newly
inaugurated
president
jair
bolsonaro
to
relax
restrictions
on
the
mining
industry
including
proposals
to
open
up
indigenous
reservations
and
large
swaths
of
the
amazon
jungle

mining
