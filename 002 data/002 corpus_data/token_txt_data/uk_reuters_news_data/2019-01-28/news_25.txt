analysis-aramco's rating ambitions face saudi economic curb
dubai
reuters
saudi
aramco
is
pushing
for
a
top
credit
rating
ahead
of
its
first
international
bond
sale
but
saudi
arabia
s
sluggish
economy
may
curb
the
oil
firm
s
ambitions
aramco
intends
to
issue
its
first
bonds
expected
to
be
at
least
billion
in
the
second
quarter
to
help
finance
the
acquisition
of
a
stake
in
sabic
the
world
s
petrochemicals
maker
chief
executive
amin
nasser
said
last
week
that
aramco
was
talking
to
credit
rating
agencies
ahead
of
its
debut
on
the
international
capital
markets
which
comes
after
it
last
year
pulled
what
would
have
been
the
biggest
ever
stock
flotation
credit
ratings
allow
investors
to
compare
and
assess
the
credit
quality
of
bond
issuers
and
their
debt
securities
and
are
important
in
determining
how
much
borrowers
have
to
pay
as
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
aramco
expects
to
match
the
ratings
of
exxon
and
shell
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
exxon
is
rated
by
agency
moody
s
and
by
its
rival
s
p
putting
it
on
par
with
the
rating
of
the
united
states
but
this
would
put
aramco
which
declined
to
comment
four
to
six
notches
above
saudi
arabia
itself
creating
an
unprecedented
gap
between
a
firm
and
its
government
bond
market
investors
expect
aramco
to
have
a
similar
if
not
lower
rating
than
saudi
arabia
meaning
its
bonds
will
have
to
offer
a
higher
yield
than
government
debt
to
attract
buyers
we
wouldn
t
buy
aramco
s
bonds
if
they
were
yielding
lower
than
saudi
arabia
s
sovereign
bonds
of
similar
maturity

quinsonas

fund
said
moody
s
and
s
p
declined
to
comment
on
aramco
while
a
third
agency
fitch
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
as
a
standalone
business
aramco
could
outweigh
its
international
peers
but
most
of
its
assets
are
in
saudi
arabia
and
it
is
tightly
linked
to
saudi
arabia
s
economic
policies
and
national
oil
companies
are
generally
rated
at
the
same
level
as
or
slightly
lower
than
their
governments
several
investors
said
they
expect
aramco
s
rating
to
be
in
line
with
the
country
s
sovereign
rating
as
a
result
even
though
its
accounts
for
seen
by
reuters
show
that
cashflow
from
operations
put
it
well
above
exxon
the
world
s
largest
listed
oil
firm
and
aramco
s
nearest
rival
we
would
anticipate
that
the
group
as
a
whole
at
face
value
would
have
a
credit
rating
equivalent
or
slightly
below
that
of
the
sovereign
ehsan
khoman
head
of
mena
research
and
strategy
at
mufg
said
saudi
arabia
is
trying
to
diversify
its
revenues
away
from
oil
and
stimulate
a
sluggish
economy
bruised
by
a
price
slump
in
the
past
few
years
the
aramco
ipo
which
has
been
pushed
back
to
was
a
cornerstone
of
its
reform
plans
when
it
comes
to
what
aramco
will
have
to
pay
investors
the
oil
firm
may
have
to
offer
higher
yields
than
the
government
one
would
expect
aramco
as
an
entity
that
is
less
core
than
the
sovereign
per
se
to
trade
wider
than
sovereign
bonds
mufg
s
khoman
said
while
aramco
s
revenue
stream
depends
on
hydrocarbon
sales
which
are
cyclical
and
subject
to
international
fundamentals
the
state
has
access
to
more
diversified
wealth
buffers
to
meet
its
contractual
obligations
almost
percent
of
state
revenues
are
set
to
come
from
oil
this
year
and
aramco
is
the
sole
holder
of
saudi
oil
concessions
and
the
country
s
most
important
source
of
foreign
currency
there
is
not
a
clear
fundamental
advantage
to
buy
aramco
rather
than
saudi
bonds
but
the
spread
concession
to
the
sovereign
could
make
it
the
more
attractive
investment
when
considering
the
relative
credit
risk
profile
janelle
woodward
head
of
income
at
bmo
global
asset
management
said
a
spread
differential
of
to
basis
points
when
comparing
entities
with
their
sovereigns
was
typical
for
entities
woodward
said
adding
that
this
would
be
the
case
with
aramco
which
she
expects
will
be
rated
at
par
with
the
kingdom
