relieved

one

the
longest
government
shutdown
in

the

anxious

definitely
a
plus

will
visit
the

nature
of
the
government
s
reopening
trump
has
threatened
to
resume
the
shutdown
on
if
his
demands
aren
t
met
remained
a
source
of
concern
as
things
stand
this
morning
we
have
only
days
left
before
we
get
another
government
shutdown
or
a
wall
that
should
keep
