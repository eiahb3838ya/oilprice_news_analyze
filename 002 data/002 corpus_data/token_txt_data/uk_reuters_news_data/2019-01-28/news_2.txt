a
deeply
indebted
petrobras
put
the
plant
on
the

in

sinking
more
than
billion
into
it
since
it
acquired
its
first
stake
in
the
operation
in
chevron
and
petrobras
negotiations
were
delayed
in

petrobras
has
been
looking
to
divest
billion
in
assets
to
reduce
its
debt
load
amid
a
series
of
corruption
scandals
including
allegations
bribes
were
paid
to
executives
as
a
result
of
the
purchase
of
the
pasadena
plant
the
rapid
expansion
of
shale
production
from
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
has
stirred
demand
for
new
refining
capacity
and
facilities
oil
output
has
soared
to
an
estimated
million
bpd
this
month
from
million
five
years
ago
chevron
which
reported
a
bpd
increase
in
shale
production
in
the
third
quarter
has
said
it
wants
a
second
gulf
coast
facility
to
handle
that
crude
and
better
supply
its
retail
gasoline
network
the
plant
produces
mostly
gasoline
and
distillates
such
as
diesel
the
refinery
covers
acres
on
the
houston
ship
channel
and
the
purchase
includes
another
acres
of
terminal
and
other
cleared
land
available
for
expansion
the
site
has
storage
tanks
that
can
hold
million
barrels
and
a
marine
terminal
for
exports
the
plant
s
work
force
is
represented
by
the
united
steelworkers
union
and
would
become
chevron
employees
once
the
deal
is
completed
there
