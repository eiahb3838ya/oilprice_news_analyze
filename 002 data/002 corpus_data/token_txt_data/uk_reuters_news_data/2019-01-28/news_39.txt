chinese
demand
for
crude
oil
is
rebounding
as
independent
refiners
push
to
buy
before
prices
climb
further
from
low
levels
hit
late
last
year
restocking
with
supplies
that
will
arrive
in
march
and
april
trade
sources
said
that
appetite
from
such
refiners
often
known
as
teapots
has
driven
up
spot
premiums
for
oil
from
africa
europe
russia
and
oman
the
sources
said
with
prices
for
some
grades
hitting
highs
that
comes
after
teapots
slowed
crude
purchases
for
delivery
in
the
first
two
months
of
as
demand
for
the
fuel
they
churn
out
typically
fades
over
the
lunar
new
year
holidays
which
this
year
fall
in
early
february
it
s
as
if
someone
lit
a
match
and
the
market
s
caught
fire
said
one
of
the
sources
all
sources
declined
to
be
named
as
they
were
not
authorised
to
speak
to
media
global
benchmark
brent
oil
prices
had
fallen
more
than
percent
to
just
above
a
barrel
by
the
end
of
but
prompt
may
crude
futures
have
rebounded
to
above
a
barrel
this
month
teapots
tend
to
time
their
crude
purchases
based
on
oil
price
movements
and
often
when
one
buys
others
will
follow
the
sources
said
spot
premiums
for
crude
grades
popular
with
chinese
buyers
are
between
cents
and
more
than
a
barrel
higher
than
price
quotes
seen
at
the
start
of
the
month
they
said
for
example
oman
s
spot
premium
almost
doubled
last
week
to
a
barrel
from
the
start
of
the
month
while
offers
of
russian
espo
crude
for
delivery
to
china
in
march
have
risen
by
cents
to
about
a
barrel
to
may
ice
brent
futures
according
to
the
sources
and
reuters
data
however
demand
is
expected
to
cool
by
the
end
of
this
week
as
buyers
leave
the
office
for
the
lunar
new
year
break
the
sources
said
china
s
refined
product
consumption
could
only
see
growth
in
from
last
year
as
gasoline
demand
slows
with
an
expected
drop
in
passenger
vehicle
sales
while
diesel
use
will
continue
to
contract
on
weaker
industrial
output
lin
chen
nomura
s
head
of
greater
china
energy
global
markets
research
said
in
a
note
still
the
world
s
biggest
oil
importer
could
see
crude
imports
rising
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
up
more
than
percent
from
the
previous
year
chen
said
china
s
refining
throughput
is
set
to
hit
another
high
of
million
bpd
in
about
bpd
more
than
last
year
driven
by
new
refineries
hengli
petrochemical
and
zhejiang
petrochemical
he
added
competition
from
these
new
plants
means
that
other
independent
refiners
are
unlikely
to
increase
their
throughput
this
year
chen
said
also
oil
imports
in
the
key
refining
region
of
shandong
in
the
east
of
the
country
are
unlikely
to
rise
until
dongjiakou
city
completes
a
port
expansion
