analysts
said
high
crude
oil
production
which
hit
a
record
million
barrels
per

bpd
late
last

was
weighing
on
oil
markets
in
a

that

rise
further
energy

last

raised

in

on

beyond
oil
supply
a
key
question
for
this
year
will
be
oil
consumption
has
been
increasing
steadily
likely
averaging
above
million
bpd
for
this
first
time
in
driven
largely
by
a
boom
in
china
however
an
economic
slowdown
amid
a
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
beijing
is
also
weighing
on
fuel
expectations
china
which
recorded
the
slowest
pace
of
economic
growth
since
last
year
is
trying
to
stem
the
slowdown
with
aggressive
fiscal
stimulus
measures
but
there
are
concerns
that
these
measures
may
not
have
the
full
desired
effect
as
china
s
economy
is
already
laden
with
massive
debt
and
some
of
the
bigger
government
spending
measures
are
seen
to
be
of
little
real
use
high
supply
and
an
economic
slowdown
are
weighing
on
the
oil
price
outlook
we
expect
crude
oil
prices
to
range
between
per
barrel
in
and
about
more

capital
advisors
said
in
its
oil
market
outlook
however
tortoise
added
that
oil
prices
would
be
supported
above
per
barrel
as
it
was
very
clear
that
saudi
arabia
will
no
longer
be
willing
to
accept
these
lower
oil
prices
the
organization
of
the

exporting

opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
started
supply
cuts
late
last
year
to
tighten
markets
and
buoy
prices
