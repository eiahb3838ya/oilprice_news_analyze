feature-when harrow met solar: u.s. land-use competition heats up

reuters
foundation
nathan
l
etoile
and
caroline
taylor
are
both
passionate
about
preserving
farmland
but
they
differ
over
a
question
being
posed
across
the
united
states
should
farmers
devote
some
or
even
all
of
their
land
to
solar
energy
in
recent
years
the
country
has
experienced
a
solar
boom
installed
capacity
last
year
reached
gigawatts
up
from
about
a
decade
ago
according
to
the
solar
energy
industries
association
a
trade
group
it
expects
this
figure
will
more
than
double
in
the
next
five
years
with
about
being
installed
annually
for
a
start
that
means
much
more
land
will
be
needed
under
a
scenario
that
sees
solar
reach
by
the
government
estimates
a
total
of
million
acres
million
hectares
will
be
required
by
roughly
the
size
of
massachusetts
by
comparison
the
country
s
capacity
from
all
sources
in
was
about
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
a
government
body
coal
and
natural
gas
accounted
for
about
percent
of
that
total
flat
undeveloped
tracts
that
enjoy
plenty
of
sun
are
in
growing
demand
said
l
etoile
whose
family
farms
acres
in
massachusetts
and
has
been
approached
repeatedly
by
solar
developers
who
to
date
have
been
unsuccessful
we
only
have
so
much
land
and
we
all
have
our
own
idea
of
the
best
use
of
that
land
l
etoile
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
further
south
in
maryland
where
taylor
lives
the
state
government
has
pledged
that
a
quarter
of
the
electricity
sold
by
local
utilities
will
come
from
renewables
by
legislation
underway
could
see
that
double
by
although
taylor
supports
those
goals
she
heads
a
group
called
the
montgomery
countryside
alliance
that
works
with
a
nationally
recognised
agricultural
reserve
acres
located
just
miles
from
washington
the
reserve
was
zoned
in
the
to
protect
farmland
and
agriculture
she
fears
that
it
is
increasingly
under
threat
as
state
laws
look
to
boost
solar
generation
we
re
concerned
that
industry
will
want
to
come
look
for
arable
land
it
s
the
easiest
way
to
go
she
said
adding
that
last
year
the
alliance
fought
off
one
legislative
attempt
to
allow
solar
projects
within
the
reserve
taylor
said
more
research
was
needed
on
how
to
combine
solar
with
farming
she
is
also
concerned
at
the
s
scattershot
approach
to
renewables
saying
legislators
should
come
up
with
a
comprehensive
plan
for
achieving
goals
l
etoile
s
family
grows
turf
as
well
as
hops
and
grain
that
they
mill
and
sell
to
local
restaurants
and
bakeries
he
said
the
area
had
some
of
the
country
s
best
soil
which
is
one
reason
his
family
has
turned
down
solar
developers
we
have
emotional
ties
to
the
land
and
we
feel
it
s
important
that
they
stay
in
agriculture
he
said
historically
he
said
farmland
could
be
used
for
solar
or
for
farming
not
both
but
that
could
change
in
august
massachusetts
began
a
programme
to
push
farmers
and
the
solar
industry
to
work
together
tiered
incentives
under
which
dual
use
projects
were
eligible
for
about
percent
more
financial
assistance
l
etoile
said
this
includes
projects
that
combine
solar
arrays
with
active
agriculture
typically
that
means
placing
solar
panels
high
off
the
ground
and
spacing
them
to
ensure
crops
can
grow
beneath
research
suggests
that
works
he
said
the
l
etoile
family
estimates
a
solar
lease
would
bring
in
per
acre
over
that
time
in
addition
to
the
revenue
the
land
continued
to
generate
from
farming
that
would
help
the
farm
and
bolster
rural
economies
l
etoile
said
but
like
taylor
the
implications
of
what
looks
to
be
easy
money
worry
him
he
also
works
for
an
advocacy
group
the
american
farmland
trust
that
last
year
found
more
than
million
acres
of
farmland
were
lost
to
development
between
and
double
previous
estimates
it
s
an
easy
path
to
just
convert
farms
to
solar
many
people
say
that
solar
is
only
a
thing
that
the
land
can
always
go
back
to
agriculture
l
etoile
said
but
he
said
that
reversion
generally
did
not
happen
his
family
has
not
applied
for
state
subsidies
but
they
are
talking
to
developers
knowing
they
could
produce
solar
energy
and
crops
on
the
same
land
at
the
same
time
it
s
not
a
binary
choice
maybe
we
can
other
collaborative
models
are
also
springing
up
in
minnesota
passed
legislation
requiring
new
solar
development
to
say
whether
it
was
pollinator
friendly
rather
than
building
the
solar
array
on
a
gravel
bed
developers
plant
the
area
with
perennial
flowers
said
rob
davis
of
fresh
energy
a
based
in
the
state
that
attracts
bees
that
can
pollinate
crops
davis
said
and
could
help
to
roll
back
some
of
the
million
acres
of
pollinator
habitat
lost
nationwide
over
the
past
two
decades
doing
so
would
cut
maintenance
costs
he
said
and
could
increase
the
amount
of
solar
energy
generated
it
creates
a
cooler
microclimate
and
solar
panels
produce
more
electricity
when
they
re
cooler
he
said
minnesota
s
requirement
that
all
large
solar
projects
be
was
a
major
selling
point
in
getting
communities
to
support
new
developments
he
said
the
law
has
sparked
similar
legislation
in
five
other
states
and
has
led
large
utilities
which
are
some
of
the
major
investors
in
solar
power
in
the
united
states
to
follow
that
lead
davis
said
cypress
creek
renewables
an
independent
solar
developer
in
north
carolina
started
a
pollinator
programme
last
year
and
has
similar
projects
in
four
states
said
bryanna
glod
ocitti
its
senior
director
of
strategic
development
a
pilot
programme
is
assessing
having
livestock
graze
around
solar
arrays
that
could
let
farmers
could
keep
using
land
that
is
generating
energy
and
solar
developers
cut
costs
by
having
animals
trim
the
vegetation
ocitti
said
putting
solar
on
some
underutilised
parts
of
their
land
has
helped
landowner
partners
to
weather
the
ups
and
downs
of
farming
she
said
others
are
looking
to
avoid
competition
over
by
targeting
landfill
and
other
degraded
areas
some
of
the
most
innovative
work
is
taking
place
in
nevada
where
in
august
authorities
amended
state
law
to
include
solar
development
as
a
valid
use
for
former
mine
lands
said
john
zablocki
of
the
nature
conservancy
an
advocacy
group
that
has
been
supported
across
the
political
spectrum
including
by
environmental
groups
and
the
mining
industry
he
said
he
and
his
colleagues
see
great
potential
nationally
government
data
shows
the
united
states
has
more
than
degraded
sites
comprising
more
than
million
acres
far
more
than
would
be
needed
by
which
could
in
theory
generate
annually
according
to
a
report
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
a
government
body
zablocki
and
his
colleagues
want
to
transfer
their
knowledge
to
west
virginia
another
state
with
a
long
mining
history
i
d
say
it
s
america
s
greatest
untapped
energy
resource
tens
of
millions
of
acres
that
can
generate
energy
he
said
mining
companies
are
starting
to
see
they
can
turn
liabilities
into
assets
so
we
see
nevada
and
west
virginia
as
the
tip
of
the
spear
