update 4-venezuela's guaido aims at control of pdvsa, citgo as u.s. imposes sanctions
reuters
venezuelan
opposition
leader
and
president
juan
guaido
ordered
congress
on
monday
to
appoint
new
boards
of
directors
to
state
oil
company
pdvsa
and
subsidiary
citgo
shortly
before
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
the
firm
the
moves
were
aimed
at
intensifying
pressure
on
president
nicolas
maduro
who
was
last
year
in
a
contest
widely
seen
as
fraudulent
guaido
proclaimed
himself
president
last
week
but
without
a
source
of
revenue
or
control
of
the
military
he
faces
difficult
odds
in
assuming
the
post
despite
support
across
most
of
the
western
hemisphere
guaido
who
has
not
yet
appointed
a
cabinet
faces
the
intricate
legal
challenge
of
nominating
new
leadership
for
pdvsa
and
its
subsidiaries
including
citgo
petroleum
who
would
manage
the
companies
during
a
transition
the
white
house
s
measures
to
freeze
pdvsa
s
assets
including
proceeds
from
oil
exports
and
limit
the
company
s
transactions
are
an
attempt
to
largely
cut
off
maduro
s
access
to
oil
revenue
that
accounts
for
most
of
the
country
s
income
in
hard
currency
refineries
in
the
united
states
can
receive
venezuelan
oil
already
paid
for
and
currently
at
sea
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
if
the
people
in
venezuela
want
to
continue
to
sell
us
oil
as
long
as
the
money
goes
into
blocked
accounts
we
will
continue
to
take
it
otherwise
will
we
not
be
buying
it
mnuchin
told
reporters
in
washington
on
monday
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
the
sanctions
would
block
billion
in
pdvsa
s
assets
plus
over
billion
in
lost
export
proceeds
over
the
next
it
is
unclear
if
venezuela
will
continue
selling
oil
to
customers
in
the
united
states
venezuela
exports
about
barrels
of
oil
daily
to
the
united
states
mostly
to
citgo
and
refineries
owned
by
valero
energy
corp
and
chevron
corp
the
country
s
production
has
dropped
in
recent
years
to
about
million
barrels
a
day
because
of
economic
mismanagement
and
lack
of
investment
maduro
remains
in
control
of
the
country
because
of
support
from
the
military
despite
massive
protests
against
his
government
amid
an
economic
crisis
that
has
caused
millions
to
flee
the
country
many
people
are
going
hungry
while
inflation
has
skyrocketed
and
left
basic
goods
unaffordable
the
sanctions
do
not
prohibit
deals
between
pdvsa
and
major
operating
in
venezuela
including
chevron
halliburton
co
and
schlumberger
nv
it
does
however
prevent
firms
from
exporting
certain
oil
products
venezuela
needs
to
blend
with
its
own
crude
for
sale
elsewhere
attempting
to
redirect
funds
to
guaido
s
team
could
give
him
maneuverability
in
the
short
term
as
appointing
new
boards
at
pdvsa
and
citgo
could
take
a
long
time
according
to
experts
frank
holder
the
head
of
berkeley
research
group
s
latin
american
practice
said
guaido
could
face
difficulties
in
appointing
a
citgo
board
against
the
wishes
of
its
parent
but
guaido
s
team
may
try
a
number
of
things
even
if
they
are
unlikely
to
work
because
politically
it
shows
he
is
trying
to
do
something
that
he
has
power
holder
said
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
pdvsa
in
that
prevented
citgo
from
repatriating
dividends
to
its
parent
company
citgo
had
about
million
in
cash
at
the
end
of
september
according
to
a
creditor
who
spoke
to
reuters
last
week
and
million
in
available
credit
citgo
also
faces
a
july
deadline
to
refinance
its
revolving
credit
a
task
that
could
be
delayed
because
of
sanctions
affecting
the
subsidiary
s
ability
to
access
to
credit
