open

to

shutting

as
the

began
to
go
down
but
these
days
it
s
open
until
pm
and
her
profits
have
tripled
we
now
sell
both
during
the
day
and
late
in

of
the
constant

this

ngonou
s
new
power
source
is
a
solar
array
that
supplies
power
to
about
homes
businesses
and
other
institutions
in
mfou
a
town
of
about
people
east
of
yaounde
cameroon
s
capital
earlier
the
area
relied
in
part
on
grid
power
which
has
been
unreliable
as
more
erratic
rainfall
and
droughts
linked
to
climate
change
hit
the
county
s
hydropower
dams
which
supply
the
majority
of
its
energy
but
the
solar
grid
installed
in
has
given
the
area
it
serves
reliable
power
and
is
now
being
replicated
in
other
parts
of
cameroon
as
the
government
tries
to
plug
a
stubborn
energy
gap
and
shore
up
its
energy
system
against
climate
change
officials
say
mfou
s
solar
system
was
part
of
a
deal
between
cameroon
s
government
and
china
s
huawei
telecommunications
company
which
also
installs
solar
installations
to
supply
solar
energy
to
more
than
villages
largely
in
rural
areas
they
say
so
far
solar
power
much
of
it
and
often
installed
by
organisations
provides
only
about
percent
of
cameroon
s
energy
needs
according
to
government
figures
energy
expansion
plans
for
cameroon
have
focused
largely
on
fossil
fuel
plants
and
hydropower
expansion
mostly
funded
by
china
but
now
cameroon
s
president
paul
biya
has
thrown
his
hefty
political
weight
in
support
of
renewable
energy
and
this
has
brought
a
new
stimulating
perspective
martine
akame
mesumbe
director
of
gas
exploitation
at
the
ministry
of
water
and
energy
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
government
hopes
to
boost
cameroon
s
electricity
access
in
rural
areas
as
part
of
its
vision
development
plan
aimed
at
expanding
the
economy
and
slashing
poverty
to
percent
so
far
that
expansion
has
been
hampered
by
a
lack
of
power
experts
say
according
to
a
world
bank
report
just
half
of
cameroon
s
people
have
access
to
electricity
with
percent
of
the
supply
concentrated
in
urban
areas
rural
electrification
is
just
percent
it
said
as
part
of
its
push
to
change
that
the
government
now
aims
to
reach
communities
about
people
in
total
with
solar
power
by
the
end
of
according
to
mesumbe
altogether
it
hopes
to
get
electricity
from
a
variety
of
sources
to
percent
of
rural
cameroonians
by
this
could
drive
significant
economic
change
in
rural
cameroon
mesumbe
said
more
than
million
in
funding
for
the
push
is
coming
from
a
bank
of
china
loan
for
renewable
energy
projects
he
said
communities
now
hooked
up
to
solar
panels
like
those
in
mfou
say
they
are
happy
to
have
a
cleaner
and
less
costly
source
of
energy
it
is
a
cheaper
alternative
to
diesel
generators
and
wood
energy
used
in
the
past
to
power
small
businesses
said
roger
belinga
the
mayor
of
mfou
jarome
angwi
a
beer
vendor
in
the
town
said
solar
energy
to
power
his
refrigerator
and
premises
costs
just
a
fifth
of
what
he
used
to
pay
for
diesel
local
officials
say
they
hope
access
to
electricity
will
help
keep
young
people
from
deserting
rural
areas
for
jobs
in
cameroon
s
cities
in
mfou
even
some
of
those
who
left
are
already
coming
back
since
the
solar
panels
were
installed
belinga
said
whether
the
new
solar
systems
will
be
maintained
however
remains
a
question
local
authorities
in
some
towns
said
they
lack
the
funds
to
train
local
solar
technicians
many
local
councils
do
not
have
the
financial
resources
to
sustain
these
projects
they
need
financial
support
from
government
rose
ngassa
the
mayor
of
tombel
in
southwest
cameroon
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
in
yaounde
but
national
government
officials
say
an
ongoing
political
decentralisation
push
in
cameroon
including
an
expected
percent
boost
in
cash
transferred
to
local
authorities
in
should
give
local
councils
more
money
to
invest
in
and
maintain
solar
energy
systems
greater
use
of
solar
power
could
also
help
cut
worrying
deforestation
rates
in
cameroon
home
to
part
of
africa
s
congo
basin
forests
environmentalist
say
the
cutting
of
trees
for
wood
and
charcoal
used
for
cooking
and
heating
will
now
reduce
in
many
villages
with
the
coming
of
solar
energy
