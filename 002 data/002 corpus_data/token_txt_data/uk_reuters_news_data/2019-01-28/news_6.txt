the
trump
administration
on
monday
imposed
sweeping
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
the
toughest
financial
challenge
yet
to
the
country
s
embattled
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
the
sanctions
ratchet
up
pressure
against
maduro
to
step
aside
and
turn
over
power
to
juan
guaido
the
venezuelan
opposition
leader
who
proclaimed
himself
interim
president
last
week
and
was
immediately
recognized
by
the
united
states
and
a
host
of
other
countries
we
have
continued
to
expose
the
corruption
of
maduro
and
his
cronies
and
today
s
action
ensures
they
can
no
longer
loot
the
assets
of
the
venezuelan
people
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
told
reporters
at
a
white
house
briefing
president
donald
trump
s
order
freezes
assets
of
pdvsa
venezuela
s
largest
source
of
revenue
and
the
owner
of
refining
arm
citgo
petroleum
the
opec
member
s
most
important
foreign
asset
the
trump
administration
had
long
held
off
on
targeting
venezuela
s
vital
oil
sector
for
fear
that
it
would
hurt
refiners
and
raise
oil
prices
for
americans
white
house
officials
had
also
expressed
concern
about
inflicting
further
hardship
on
the
venezuelan
people
the
latest
sanctions
appear
to
seek
to
build
on
the
momentum
that
has
mounted
in
recent
weeks
against
maduro
at
home
and
abroad
officials
said
the
sanctions
on
pdvsa
were
intended
to
prevent
maduro
s
government
from
siphoning
off
funds
from
the
oil
company
to
maintain
his
grip
on
power
bolton
said
monday
s
announcement
would
block
maduro
from
accessing
pdvsa
assets
worth
billion
and
cost
him
billion
in
lost
export
proceeds
over
the
next
year
the
united
states
stopped
short
however
of
imposing
a
ban
on
imports
of
venezuelan
oil
a
move
that
oil
refiners
had
opposed
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
citgo
in
the
united
states
would
be
able
to
continue
to
operate
provided
funds
go
to
a
blocked
account
he
said
oil
supplies
were
sufficient
to
ensure
no
significant
impact
on
gas
prices
in
the
short
term
and
that
the
treasury
department
would
issue
temporary
licenses
to
permit
some
transactions
with
pdvsa
even
though
the
venezuelan
military
has
shown
no
sign
of
abandoning
maduro
bolton
said
our
assessment
based
on
numerous
contacts
on
the
ground
is
that
the
rank
and
file
of
the
venezuelan
military
is
acutely
aware
of
the
desperate
economic
conditions
in
the
country
and
we
think
they
look
for
ways
to
support
the
national
assembly
countries
around
the
world
have
recognized
guaido
as
venezuela
s
rightful
leader
and
the
united
states
vowed
to
starve
maduro
s
administration
of
oil
revenue
after
he
was
sworn
in
on
for
a
second
term
that
was
widely
dubbed
illegitimate
maduro
says
the
united
states
is
promoting
a
coup
against
him
and
promised
to
stay
in
office
backed
by
russia
and
china
which
have
bank
rolled
his
government
and
fought
off
efforts
to
have
his
government
disavowed
by
the
united
nations
the
venezuelan
government
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
move
bolton
warned
maduro
that
he
would
be
held
responsible
for
the
safety
of
diplomatic
personnel
in
venezuela
as
well
as
guaido
and
other
opposition
figures
he
also
did
not
appear
to
rule
out
military
intervention
though
such
action
is
widely
considered
to
be
unlikely
the
president
has
made
it
very
clear
on
this
matter
that
all
options
are
on
the
table
