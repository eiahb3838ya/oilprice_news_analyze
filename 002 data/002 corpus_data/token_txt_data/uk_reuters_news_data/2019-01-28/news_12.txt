oil
fell

percent
on

its
biggest
percentage
drop
in
a
month
after
an
increase
in

pointed
to
further
supply
growth
amid
continuing

about

the

both

seeing

really
start

said
phillip

senior

strategist
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
one
of
the
factors
that
played
into
prices
is
the
rising
rig

that
we
saw
on
drillers
added
oil
rigs
last
week
according
to
energy

on

the
trade
war
between
washington

weighed
on

investor
optimism
waned
that
the
two
sides
would

end
the
tariff
fight
that
has
damaged
china
s
economy
that
coupled
with
uncertainty
about
how
long
the

will
stay
open
after
washington
agreed

historic

dampened
investor
optimism
said
gene
mcgillian

in

connecticut
i
think
both
those
factors
seem
to
have
sparked
fears
about
slowing
demand
growth
which
have
been
one
of
the
main
bearish
drivers
in
the
market
for
a
while
mcgillian
said
crude
futures
remain
on
course
for
their
strongest
monthly
gains
in
more
than
two
years
following

the

wti
has
risen
more
than
percent
this
month
the
biggest
jump
since
april
when
it
surged
almost

investors
have
added
to
bets
on
a
sustained
rise
in
the
oil
price
this
month
for
the
first
time
since
september
according
to
data
from
the

much
of
the

outlook
hinges
on
china
and
whether
its
refiners
will
continue
to
import
crude
at
s
breakneck
pace
industrial
companies
in

reported
a
