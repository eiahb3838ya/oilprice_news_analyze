arrested
opposition
leader
maurice
kamto
on
monday
his
lawyer
said
after
weekend
protests
that
security
forces
dispersed
with
live
bullets
wounding
six
people
kamto
has
been
mobilising
dissent
against
president
paul
biya
since
losing
what
he
says
was
a
fraudulent
election
in
october
kamto
declared
himself
winner
at
the
time
of
the
poll
and
has
since
challenged
biya
s
win
in
the
african
union
court
protests
are
rare
in
cameroon
outside
its
troubled
anglophone
western
region
and
tend
to
be
swiftly
put
down
by
force
and
mass
arrests
i
can
confirm
that
professor
maurice
kamto
was
arrested
today
his
lawyer
agbor
bala
told
reuters
by
telephone
adding
that
it
was
because
of
the
weekend
protests
in
which
dozens
took
part
the
treasurer
of
his
cameroon
renaissance
movement
party
alain
fogue
was
also
detained
bala
said
at
biya
is
the
oldest
leader
in
africa
and
most
cameroonians
have
known
only
him
as
president
he
holds
cabinet
meetings
only
every
few
years
and
spends
a
lot
of
his
time
on
private
trips
to
switzerland
but
the
opposition
has
been
unable
to
mount
a
credible
challenge
to
him
the
election
cemented
his
place
as
one
of
africa
s
serving
leaders
but
allegations
of
ballot
stuffing
and
intimidation
loomed
over
his
victory
and
turnout
was
low
because
of
a
secessionist
uprising
in
the
anglophone
regions
in
which
hundreds
have
died
biya
s
camp
has
denied
all
allegations
of
electoral
fraud
