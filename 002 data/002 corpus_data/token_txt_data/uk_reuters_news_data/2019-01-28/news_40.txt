rallied
broadly
on
friday
as
investors
were
relieved
to
see
an
end
to
one
of
the
longest
government
shutdown
in
history
the
shutdown
had
left
the
markets
anxious
as
it
came
at
a
time
of
heightened
worries
over
slowing
global
growth
signs
of
stress
in

a

negotiations
with
washington

treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
he
has
criticized
the
yuan
s
weakness
in
the
past
but
in
recent
days
positive
sentiment
towards
the
talks
has
lifted
the
yuan
s
value
against
the
dollar
although
coming
to
an
agreement
is
still
tricky
both
sides
have
little
incentive
to
escalate
tensions

tai
hui
hong
chief
market
strategist
for

pacific
at
morgan
asset
management
in
a
note
markets
will
at
least
expect
an
extension
of
the
truce
in
tariff
increases
beyond
early
march
while
more
difficult
issues
are
still
being
worked
on
by
both

the
underlying
anxiety
on
trade

temporary
nature
of
the
government
s
reopening
trump
has
threatened
to
resume
the
shutdown

if
his
demands
aren
t
met
remained
a
source
of
concern
as
things
stand
this
morning
we
have
only
days
left
before
we
get
another
government
shutdown
or
a
wall

should
keep
things
interesting
