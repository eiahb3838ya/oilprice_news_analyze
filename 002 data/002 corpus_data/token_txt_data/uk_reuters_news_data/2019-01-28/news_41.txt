china
has
been
aggressively
promoting
renewable
power
as
part
of
an
energy
revolution
aimed
at
easing
its
dependence
on
coal
a
major
source
of
pollution
and
greenhouse

including
hydro
and
biomass
as
well
as
solar

wind
rose
to
gigawatts

hooked

another

said
new
solar
capacity
reached
gw
slightly
higher
than
a
figure
given
by
an
industry
association
earlier
this
month
but
still
down
compared
to
following
a
decision
to
slash
subsidies
china
also
completed
another
gw
of
hydropower
capacity
mostly
in
the
nation
s
southwest
bringing
total
hydropower
to
gw
by
the
year
s
end
china
has
tried
to
change
the
rhythm
of
renewable
power
construction
to
give
grid
operators
time
to
raise
transmission
capacity
and
ensure
clean
electricity
generation
is
not
wasted

however
still
failed
to
get
around
a
fifth

power
onto

china
s

revolution
has
also
involved
the

the

domestically
it
