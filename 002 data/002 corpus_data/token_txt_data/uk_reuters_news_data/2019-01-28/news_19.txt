and
the

nearly

or
should
change
vale
s
top
management
pension
funds
hold
several
seats
on
the

the

said
mourao
who
is
serving
as
acting
president
for
some
hours
while
president
jair
bolsonaro
recovers
from
surgery
i
m
not
sure
if
the

that

called
on

be
removed
urgently
out
of
respect
for
the
victims
and
to
avoid
any
destruction
of
one
of
vale
s
lawyers
sergio
bermudes
told
newspaper
folha
de
paulo
that
management
should
not
leave
the
company
and
calheiros
was
trying
to
profit
politically
from
the
tragedy
brazil
s
top
prosecutor
raquel
dodge
said
the
company
should
be
held
strongly
responsible
and
criminally
prosecuted
executives
could
also
be
personally
held
responsible
she
said
the
disaster
at
the
corrego

occurred
less
than
four

major
river
while
the
samarco
disaster
unleashed
about
five
times
more
mining
waste
friday
s
dam
break
was
far
deadlier
as
the
wall
of
mud
hit
vale
s
local
offices
including
a
crowded
cafeteria
and
tore
through
a
populated
area
downhill
the
cafeteria
was
in
a
risky
area

said
while
searching
for
his
twin
brother
a
vale
employee
at
an
emergency
response
station
just
to
save
money
even
if
it
meant
losing
the
little
guy
these
businessmen
they
only
think
about
as
search
efforts
continued
on
monday
firefighters
laid
down
wood
planks
to
cross
a
sea
of
sludge
that
is
hundreds
of
meters
wide
in
places
to
reach
a
bus
in
search
of
bodies
inside
villagers
discovered
the
bus
as
they
tried
to
rescue
a
nearby
cow
stuck
in
the
mud
longtime

cried
as
he
surveyed
the
mud
where
vale
s
facilities
once
stood
on
the
edge
of
town
the
world
is
over
for
us
he
said
vale
is
the
top
mining
company
in
the
world
if
this
could
happen
here
imagine
what
would
happen
if
it
were
a
smaller
nestor
jos√©
de
mury
said
he
lost
his
nephew
and
coworkers
in
the
mud
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
killed
everyone
he
said
the
board
of
vale
which
has
raised
its
dividends
over
the
last
year
suspended
all
shareholder
payouts
and
executive
bonuses
late
on
sunday
as
the
disaster
put
its
corporate
strategy
under
scrutiny
since
the
disaster
courts
have
order
a
freeze
on
billion
reais
of
vale
s
assets
to
cover
damages
state
and
federal
authorities
have
slapped
it
with
million
reais
of
administrative
fines
german
insurer
allianz
se
may
have
to
cover
some
of
the
costs
of
the
dam
collapse
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
i
m
not
a
mining
technician
i
followed
the
technicians
advice
and
you
see
what
happened
it
didn
t
work
vale
ceo
fabio
schvartsman
said
in
a
tv
interview
we
are
percent
within
all
the
standards
and
that
didn
t
do
many
wondered
if
the
state
of
minas
gerais
named
for
the
mining
industry
that
has
shaped
its
landscape
for
centuries
should
have
higher
standards
there
are
safe
ways
of
mining
said
joao
vitor
xavier
head
of
the
mining
and
energy
commission
in
the
state
assembly
it
s
just
that
it
diminishes
profit
margins
so
they
prefer
to
do
things
the
cheaper
way
and
put
lives
at
reaction
to
the
disaster
could
threaten
the
plans
of
brazil
s
newly
inaugurated
president
to
relax
restrictions
on
the
mining
industry
including
proposals
to
open
up
indigenous
reservations
and
large
swaths
of
the
amazon
jungle
for
mining
environment
minister
ricardo
salles
said
in
a
tv
interview
on
monday
that
brazil
should
create
new
regulation
for
mining
dams
replacing
wet
tailings
dams
with
dry
mining
methods
mines
and
energy
minister
bento
albuquerque
proposed
in
sunday
newspaper
interview
that
the
law
should
be
changed
to
assign
responsibility
in
cases
such
as
brumadinho
to
the
people
responsible
for
certifying
the
safety
of
mining
dams
current
law
does
not
prevent
disasters
like
the
one
we
saw
on
brumadinho
he
said
the
model
for
verifying
the
state
of
mining
dams
will
have
to
be
reconsidered
the
model
isn
t
the
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
questions
about
