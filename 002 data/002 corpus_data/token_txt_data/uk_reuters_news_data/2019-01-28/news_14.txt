is
rushing
to
take
control
of
the
country
s
main
foreign
asset
refiner
citgo
petroleum
before
a
potential
bond
default
that
could
leave
half
the
company
in
creditors
hands
sources

to
the
talks
told
reuters
on
monday
guaido
who
proclaimed
himself
president
last
week
and
has
not
yet
appointed
a
cabinet

the
intricate
legal
challenge
of
nominating
new
leadership
for
pdvsa
the
oil
and
natural
gas
company
and
its
subsidiaries
including
citgo
who
would
manage
the
companies
during
a
transition

ideas
are
also
in
discussion
to
gain
control
of

who
runs
the
congress
assumed
venezuela
s
presidency
after
president
nicolas
maduro

in
a
voting
widely
considered
a
sham
the
united
states
and
numerous
nations
in
the
hemisphere
recognized
guaido
as
the
president
but
maduro
still
controls
the
military
and
pdvsa
holders
of
venezuela
s
most
watched
pdvsa
bonds
which
mature
in
are
due
a
million
interest
payment
in
late
april
those
bonds
are
collateralized
with
percent
of
citgo
holdings

of
revenue
and
control
of
foreign
assets
guaido

team
faces
long
odds

caused
millions
to
flee
the

many
people

starving
while
inflation
has
skyrocketed
and
left
basic

imposed
sanctions
on
venezuela
in
that
have
prevented
citgo
from
repatriating
dividends
to
its

it
had
about
million
in
cash
at
the
end
of
september
according
to
