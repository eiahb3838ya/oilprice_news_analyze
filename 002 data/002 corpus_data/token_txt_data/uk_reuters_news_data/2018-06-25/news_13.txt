reuters
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
monday
a
deal
between
global
oil
producers
to
boost
crude
output
reached
last
week
may
not
be
enough
to
relieve
global
oil
markets
that
are
stressed
by
supply
constraints
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
countries
reached
an
agreement
on
saturday
to
moderately
boost
production
after
consuming
countries
including
the
united
states
had
urged
them
to
produce
more
saudi
arabia
said
the
agreement
would
likely
result
in
about
million
barrels
more
oil
output
per
day
or
about
percent
of
global
oil
supplies
the
price
of
oil
traded
in
london
fell
on
monday
after
the
wider
agreement
by
to
a
barrel
on
friday
they
had
risen
to
a
barrel
after
opec
only
countries
came
to
their
own
deal
to
boost
output
obviously
we
ve
got
a
market
that
is
stressed
from
a
standpoint
of
supply
perry
told
reporters
the
rise
in
prices
on
friday
showed
the
agreement
may
be
a
little
short
of
what
is
needed
there
are
difficulties
in
getting
crude
oil
to
market
in
the
permian
basin
in
texas
and
new
mexico
in
venezuela
which
is
struck
with
political
turmoil
and
in
angola
perry
said
in
addition
the
united
states
is
asking
oil
consuming
countries
to
reduce
their
purchases
of
oil
from
iran
an
opec
member
as
washington
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
perry
said
the
united
states
would
do
everything
it
can
to
keep
gasoline
prices
in
check
but
he
said
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
should
only
be
used
for
supply
emergencies
and
not
as
a
tool
to
manipulate
markets
several
sales
of
crude
oil
from
the
reserve
have
been
mandated
by
laws
passed
by
congress
to
help
balance
the
federal
budget
