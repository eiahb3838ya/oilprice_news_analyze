from

exports
to
china
until
last
week
there
was
vague
optimism
that
we
can
muddle
through
this
but
now
it
looks
like
unless
the
lays
down
its
arms
things
will
be
getting
more
chaotic
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global

at

as
the

of
a
trade
war

become
all
the
more
real
msci

declined
one
percent
its
biggest
weekly
drop
in
three
months
chinese

were
among
the
biggest

put
the

on
beijing
threatening
to
hit
billion
of
chinese
imports
with
percent
tariffs
policy
makers
in
china
moved
fast
to
temper
any
potential
economic
drag
from
the
trade
dispute
as
its
central
bank
said
on
sunday
it
would
cut
the
amount
of
cash
some
banks
must
hold
as
reserves
by
basis
points
bps
the
reduction
in
reserve
requirements
the
third
by
the
central
bank
this
year
had
been
widely
anticipated
by
investors
and
is
aimed
at
accelerating
the
pace
of
swaps
and
spur
lending
for
smaller
firms
despite
the
move
the

a
low
touched
on
friday
the

remained
soft
after
percent
fall
last
week
trump
threatened
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
friday
on
all
imports
of
cars
a
month
after
his
administration
launched
an
investigation
into
whether
auto
imports
posed
a
national
security
threat
a
senior
european
commission
official
said
on
saturday
that
the
european
union
will
respond
to
any
move
to
raise
tariffs
on
cars
made
in
the
bloc
investors
and
traders
are
worried
that
threats
of
higher
tariffs
and
retaliatory
measures
by
others
could
derail
a
rare
period
of
synchronised
global
growth
oil
prices
were
supported
after
opec
and
producers
agreed
on
a
modest
increase
in
production
from
next
month
without
announcing
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
leaving
traders
guessing
how
much
more
will
actually
be
pumped
opec
and
said
in
their
statement
that
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
in
reality
there
aren
t
many
countries
that
can
raise
outputs
with
only
saudi
arabia
having
the
capacity
to
flexibly
increase
the
output
but
if
saudis
alone
increase
output
sharply
they
could
face
backlash
from
some
other
countries
