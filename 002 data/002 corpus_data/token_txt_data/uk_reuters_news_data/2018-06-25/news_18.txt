french
nuclear
fuel
group
orano
has
agreed
with
china
s
cnnc
to
do
preparatory
work
for
the
sale
of
a
nuclear
fuel
reprocessing
plant
to
the
chinese
company
in
the
latest
attempt
to
seal
a
deal
that
has
been
years
in
the
making
orano
said
on
monday
the
agreement
which
runs
until
the
end
of
and
covers
work
to
be
carried
out
by
orano
to
prepare
the
sale
of
the
recycling
plant
was
confirmed
during
a
visit
by
french
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
to
china
an
orano
spokeswoman
said
the
work
would
cost
the
french
company
about
million
euros
million
and
cover
in
particular
project
management
and
quality
control
paperwork
she
added
talks
about
the
plant
were
continuing
with
the
price
being
one
of
the
remaining
issues
to
be
agreed
negotiations
about
the
tonne
capacity
plant
have
been
going
on
for
a
decade
with
new
agreements
signed
regularly
usually
during
diplomatic
meetings
but
so
far
the
two
parties
have
not
been
able
to
agree
on
a
price
for
transferring
the
technology
following
a
visit
to
china
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
in
january
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
the
deal
would
be
worth
billion
euros
billion
and
that
france
had
been
given
assurances
a
contract
would
be
signed
this
spring
that
deadline
passed
last
week
without
a
contract
ten
years
ago
orano
formerly
called
areva
had
hoped
for
billion
euros
leading
civil
nuclear
nations
such
as
the
united
states
britain
and
japan
have
ended
or
are
phasing
out
processing
france
and
russia
are
the
only
two
nations
recycling
spent
fuel
from
nuclear
reactors
but
france
no
longer
operates
the
breeder
reactors
which
are
suitable
to
use
this
fuel
critics
say
that
recycling
increases
the
risk
of
nuclear
proliferation
as
it
separates
out
plutonium
and
is
not
cost
effective
because
uranium
is
trading
near
decade
lows
