update 2-shelf drilling falls in oslo market debut, upbeat on rig rates
oslo
reuters
a
fall
in
equities
and
oil
markets
knocked
shares
in
shelf
drilling
on
their
oslo
market
debut
on
monday
although
the
world
s
largest
owner
of
shallow
water
rigs
was
optimistic
rig
rates
are
set
to
rise
the
company
s
shares
were
trading
at
norwegian
crowns
at
gmt
below
their
initial
public
offering
ipo
price
of
crowns
i
think
it
the
share
price
move
is
more
of
a
response
to
a
broader
market
movement
than
anything
specific
to
the
company
chief
executive
david
mullen
said
stocks
in
asia
and
europe
fell
on
concerns
about
a
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
while
brent
crude
eased
after
a
deal
between
opec
and
other
oil
producers
to
increase
production
shelf
drilling
s
debut
came
four
years
after
it
abandoned
plans
to
list
in
london
in
the
wake
of
an
oil
price
downturn
the
company
raised
about
million
in
the
offering
it
said
on
friday
the
latest
drilling
firm
to
list
in
oslo
to
raise
capital
mullen
told
reuters
on
monday
the
company
expected
to
see
higher
rig
rates
in
and
more
consolidation
of
the
fragmented
market
he
forecast
utilisation
of
marketed
rigs
would
rise
to
near
percent
by
the
end
of
this
year
from
percent
currently
giving
rig
owners
more
leverage
to
ask
for
higher
prices
so
going
into
we
should
see
some
pricing
power
and
some
real
price
movements
he
said
in
an
interview
adding
the
middle
east
north
sea
and
west
africa
were
the
most
promising
regions
for
rigs
about
percent
of
shelf
drilling
s
current
business
relates
to
drilling
extra
wells
at
existing
oilfields
to
help
to
drain
the
reservoirs
or
to
repair
existing
wells
as
a
recovery
in
crude
oil
prices
increases
oil
companies
interest
in
offshore
exploration
and
field
developments
mullen
plans
to
acquire
more
premium
rigs
better
suited
to
search
for
new
resources
than
standard
specification
rigs
today
we
have
eight
premium
and
we
want
to
see
that
grow
i
would
like
to
ultimately
grow
to
a
fleet
of
maybe
premium
rigs
mullen
said
mullen
also
said
he
expected
more
consolidation
in
the
drilling
rig
market
between
small
players
and
big
deals
too
i
think
you
are
going
to
see
some
big
mergers
but
we
are
more
interested
in
acquiring
assets
not
so
much
interested
in
doing
broad
m
a
deals
he
said
conglomerate
is
expected
to
try
to
sell
its
drilling
arm
maersk
drilling
but
has
not
found
a
buyer
so
far
mullen
said
shelf
drilling
itself
was
not
seeking
a
broad
deal
with
maersk
but
could
be
interested
in
buying
some
of
the
danish
company
s
benign
environment
