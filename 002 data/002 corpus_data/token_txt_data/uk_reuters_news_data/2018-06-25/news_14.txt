coal
mining
companies
are
worried
president
donald
trump
s
intensifying
trade
dispute
with
china
could
hurt
their
booming
export
business
one
of
the
ailing
sector
s
most
important
lifelines
according
to
industry
players
beijing
this
month
added
coal
and
other
energy
products
to
a
list
of
goods
facing
import
tariffs
in
retaliation
for
trump
administration
levies
the
measure
has
already
dampened
chinese
demand
for
coal
multiple
and
chinese
industry
sources
said
for
instance
trade
sources
said
china
national
building
material
international
one
of
the
biggest
metallurgical
coal
importers
in
china
pulled
back
from
supply
talks
with
coal
broker
xcoal
and
miner
consol
energy
shortly
after
beijing
s
announcement
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
consol
had
been
in
talks
with
china
to
supply
up
to
million
tons
per
year
of
metallurgical
coal
but
would
not
confirm
whether
the
deal
would
be
delayed
officials
at
xcoal
declined
to
comment
we
re
obviously
watching
it
closely
particularly
given
what
a
bright
spot
exports
have
been
for
our
industry
of
late
said
ashley
burke
a
spokeswoman
for
the
national
mining
association
which
represents
mining
companies
anything
that
would
chip
away
at
the
appetite
for
coal
abroad
would
be
of
the
energy
information
administration
said
coal
exports
to
asia
doubled
from
million
tons
in
to
million
tons
in
exports
to
china
totaled
million
tons
in
up
from
zero
in
and
according
to
the
eia
the
coal
industry
s
concerns
mirror
the
unease
spreading
in
farm
country
over
unintended
consequences
of
the
trump
administration
s
protectionist
stance
which
has
roiled
foreign
market
for
american
crops
the
farm
and
coal
industries
are
critical
trump
supporters
that
the
president
and
his
republican
party
are
relying
on
to
help
them
retain
control
of
congress
in
the
elections
in
november
steve
roberts
president
of
the
west
virginia
chamber
of
commerce
said
trump
s
protectionism
was
a
dilemma
for
his
organization
which
represents
a
number
of
companies
benefiting
from
the
export
trade
because
of
our
small
population
we
export
far
more
than
we
consume
he
said
we
are
concerned
about
the
momentum
slowing
down
we
are
literally
holding
our
breath
to
make
sure
this
dispute
is
part
of
a
bigger
picture
and
the
parties
see
the
advantage
of
trade
with
each
jason
bostic
vice
president
of
the
west
virginia
coal
association
said
he
hoped
the
dispute
would
blow
over
or
at
least
that
the
trump
administration
s
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
would
boost
domestic
demand
for
metallurgical
coal
demand
for
met
coal
is
currently
about
million
tons
a
year
and
could
rise
if
steel
manufacturing
increases
we
are
walking
a
tight
rope
he
said
the
addition
of
coal
to
the
list
of
more
than
items
facing
higher
tariffs
from
china
also
came
as
a
shock
to
chinese
steel
mills
and
trading
firms
just
last
month
beijing
had
been
encouraging
them
to
buy
more
coal
to
narrow
the
trade
gap
four
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
plan
said
coal
operators
like
pennsylvania
s
consol
had
been
in
talks
with
chinese
buyers
and
hope
those
talks
revive
we
think
that
coal
will
be
part
of
the
solution
with
china
buying
coal
to
offset
the
trade
deficit
said
zach
smith
a
spokesman
for
consol
a
number
of
appalachian
operators
are
banking
on
it
in
a
may
investor
presentation
corsa
coal
said
it
was
aiming
for
million
tons
per
year
of
metallurgical
coal
sales
by
with
percent
for
export
and
percent
domestic
in
its
presentation
corsa
said
chinese
and
indian
infrastructure
as
well
as
a
rising
population
were
positive
drivers
for
coking
coal
to
serve
growing
demand
for
steel
corsa
coal
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for

earlier
this
month

owned
by
the
family
of
west
virginia
governor
jim
justice
announced
it
planned
to
hire
workers
for
two
reopened
mines
and
two
new
metallurgical
mines
in
west
virginia
some
percent
of
its
coal
is
marketed
for
overseas
export
