if
it
were
possible
to
boil
the
crude
oil
market
down
to
just
one
determining
factor
for
the
coming
months
it
would
be
this
what
will
saudi
arabia
actually
do
the
saudis
appear
to
have
emerged
as
the
winners
from
last
week
s
meeting
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
the
subsequent
talks
between
opec
and
its
allies
in
the
deal
to
restrict
output
the
outcome
of
the
meetings
would
seem
to
indicate
that
crude
oil
supply
should
rise
by
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
s
based
on
the
assumption
that
opec
and
allies
will
return
to
percent
compliance
with
the
november
cut
of
million
bpd
from
a
current
situation
of
however
the
reality
on
the
ground
is
that
many
opec
countries
lack
the
ability
to
pump
their
full
quotas
saudi
arabia
is
the
only
producer
that
can
ramp
out
output
significantly
within
a
short
period
of
time
the
market
consensus
after
the
opec
meeting
in
vienna
on
june
and
the
talks
with
allies
the
following
day
was
that
the
agreements
reached
wouldn
t
actually
result
in
an
extra
million
bpd
reaching
global
markets
while
there
is
some
debate
on
the
likely
increase
in
supply
the
upper
end
of
the
range
is
around
bpd
the
question
is
whether
this
would
be
enough
to
prevent
prices
from
rallying
again
given
that
the
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
largest
crude
exporter
is
going
to
have
to
provide
the
lion
s
share
of
any
increase
in
output
watching
its
export
numbers
and
price
signals
in
the
coming
months
will
be
key
in
fact
the
saudis
already
are
supplying
more
crude
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
saudi
seaborne
crude
exports
were
million
bpd
in
may
the
most
in
a
year
the
data
shows
prior
to
the
november
agreement
saudi
arabia
was
regularly
exporting
more
than
million
bpd
but
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
only
in
two
months
january
and
february
in
did
the
kingdom
ship
more
than
million
bpd
what
this
shows
is
that
the
saudis
definitely
have
the
scope
to
export
more
crude
but
boosting
output
above
million
bpd
on
a
sustained
basis
isn
t
something
they
have
done
in
recent
years
the
saudis
are
on
track
to
export
more
than
million
bpd
in
june
with
thomson
reuters
data
estimating
seaborne
shipments
of
million
bpd
but
it
s
interesting
to
note
that
the
saudis
have
been
somewhat
vague
when
it
comes
to
saying
exactly
how
much
more
they
will
produce
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
after
last
week
s
meetings
that
the
kingdom
s
oil
company
will
increase
output
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
barrels
with
precise
figures
to
be
decided
later
there
is
also
some
confusion
over
whether
saudi
arabia
will
be
permitted
in
terms
of
the
agreement
to
its
quota
to
make
up
for
shortfalls
from
other
members
such
as
venezuela
and
libya
currently
unable
to
pump
more
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
saudi
arabia
wouldn
t
be
allowed
to
pump
more
on
behalf
of
venezuela
meaning
the
kingdom
can
increase
its
production
by
less
than
bpd
with
no
certainty
on
exactly
who
can
produce
what
it
becomes
more
important
than
ever
to
monitor
crude
oil
flows
in
coming
months
and
perhaps
less
important
to
hang
on
every
word
uttered
by
the
various
parties
to
the
agreement
another
factor
often
bypassed
in
the
discussion
is
exports
of
refined
fuels
saudi
arabia
s
exports
of
gasoline
were
around
bpd
in
the
first
four
months
of
this
year
according
to
the
joint
organisations
data
initiative
jodi
that
s
up
by
around
bpd
from
last
year
s
average
saudi
shipments
of
gasoil
averaged
just
under
bpd
in
the
january
to
april
period
about
bpd
more
than
for
for
all
oil
products
the
jodi
data
show
that
saudi
arabia
s
exports
averaged
million
bpd
in
the
first
four
months
of
up
percent
from
the
million
bpd
recorded
in
the
same
period
last
year
what
this
shows
is
that
saudi
arabia
is
already
boosting
exports
to
global
markets
but
in
the
form
of
refined
products
rather
than
crude
that
brings
us
back
to
the
burning
question
for
oil
markets
how
much
more
can
or
will
the
saudis
add
to
the
global
supply
of
both
crude
and
refined
products
there
is
certainly
a
risk
in
relying
on
the
kingdom
to
virtually
balance
supply
and
demand
thereby
keeping
prices
in
the
sweet
spot
of
around
a
barrel
which
seems
to
be
high
enough
to
prevent
fiscal
problems
in
most
producers
but
low
enough
to
prevent
demand
destruction
