the

today

stocks
sank
in
a
broad

escalating
trade
tensions
the
expectation
that
we
ll
see
more
crude
out
of
opec
and
that
supplies
in
the
will
be
tight
because
of
the
syncrude
outage
is
going

keep
the
market
on
edge
said
phil

analyst
at

futures
group
losses
in
crude
prices
were
limited
by
the
likelihood
that
an
outage
at
syncrude
canada
s

would
last
through

the
outage
is
expected
to
limit

this
helped

shrink

the

was

as

had

the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
agreed
to
modestly
boost
global
oil
supplies
the
group
which
has
been
curbing
output
since
said
it
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
largely
due
to
unplanned
disruptions
in
places
including
venezuela
and
angola
the
head
of
saudi
oil
giant
aramco
said
it
has
spare
capacity
of
million
bpd
and
can
meet
additional
demand
in

provided
more

on
the
decision
to
increase

this

obviously
we

got
a
market
that
is
stressed
from
a
standpoint
of
supply
perry
said

the
agreement
may
