the
violent
conflicts
between
farmers
and
herders
in
nigeria
that
left
dozens
of
people
dead
over
the
weekend
illustrate
the
intensifying
pressure
and
competition
for
arable
land
in
africa
experts
said
on
monday
fertile
land
that
is
dwindling
due
to
climate
change
combined
with
a
population
boom
are
fueling
conflicts
across
the
continent
they
said
the
weekend
deaths
of
at
least
people
in
nigeria
s
central
plateau
state
are
seen
as
part
of
an
escalation
of
conflicts
that
have
raged
for
years
often
over
land
nigeria
has
one
of
the
world
s
fastest
growing
populations
rapidly
approaching
million
and
expected
to
be
bigger
than
the
united
states
by
according
to
united
nations
estimates
with
the
boko
haram
jihadists
insurgency
in
the
last
decade
in
nigeria
s
central
and
northern
states
herders
have
been
pushed
south
to
populated
farming
areas
said
rinaldo
depagne
west
africa
project
director
for
the
international
crisis
group
icg
at
least
people
died
annually
in
nigeria
s
middle
belt
due
to
communal
land
conflicts
between
cattle
herders
and
farmers
between
and
the
icg
estimates
the
weekend
clashes
are
the
extension
of
the
violence
depagne
told
thomson
reuters
foundation
africa
s
arable
land
is
being
taken
up
by
infrastructure
farmers
and
multinational
agricultural
firms
seeking
to
produce
food
for
a
growing
population
depriving
herders
of
grazing
reserves
depagne
said
more
people
to
feed
means
more
agricultural
settlement
and
less
available
land
and
water
for
herders
all
of
this
tend
to
trigger
more
and
more
disputes
he
said
relations
between
the
nomadic
fulani
herders
and
farming
communities
in
mali
and
niger
as
well
have
been
chaotic
with
fights
over
cropland
grazing
water
and
migration
routes
experts
say
climate
change
bringing
extreme
weather
droughts
and
desertification
has
increased
conflict
over
land
said
tim
christophersen
coordinator
of
freshwater
land
and
climate
at
united
nations
environment
programme
unep
both
climate
change
and
conflict
can
mean
limited
access
to
clean
water
and
that
affects
agricultural
productivity
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
we
should
stop
the
degradation
of
land
and
invest
in
restoring
landscape
he
said
suggesting
more
strategies
for
resilience
crop
diversification
and
more
agriculture
we
need
to
make
societies
more
resilient
by
ensuring
that
people
have
alternative
livelihoods
that
makes
them
use
their
land
in
a
sustainable
way
he
said
the
drought
and
desertification
have
degraded
pastures
and
dried
up
many
natural
water
sources
across
nigeria
s
northern
state
forcing
herders
south
in
search
of
grassland
depagne
said
the
spread
of
conflict
into
the
southern
states
is
aggravating
already
fragile
relations
among
the
country
s
major
regional
ethnic
and
religious
groups
he
said
the
south
s
majority
christian
communities
resent
the
influx
of
predominantly
muslim
herders
he
said
authorities
imposed
a
curfew
in
central
plateau
state
after
the
weekend
fighting
the
violence
in
nigeria
s
diverse
middle
belt
states
has
killed
more
people
than
the
islamist
insurgency
in
nigeria
s
northeast
