asian
shares
fell
on
monday
on
escalating
trade
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
major
economies
while
oil
prices
gave
up
some
of
their
hefty
gains
made
after
major
oil
producers
agreed
to
a
modest
increase
in
production
s
mini

as

while

japan
s
nikkei
lost

the
falls
were
triggered
by
a
report
from
the
wall
street
journal
that
president
donald
trump
plans
to
bar
many
chinese
companies
from
investing
in
technology
firms
and
block
additional
technology
exports
to
china
until
last
week
there
was
vague
optimism
that
we
can
muddle
through
this
but
now
it
looks
like
unless
the
lays
down
its
arms
things
will
be
getting
more
chaotic
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
as
the
threat
of
a
trade
war
has
become
all
the
more
real
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
has
fallen
in
five
of
the
last
six
weeks
including
last
week
when
it
declined
one
percent
its
biggest
weekly
drop
in
three
months
chinese
shares
were
among
the
biggest
losers
tumbling
percent
last
week
as
trump
put
the
heat
on
beijing
threatening
to
hit
billion
of
chinese
imports
with
percent
tariffs
policy
makers
in
china
moved
fast
to
temper
any
potential
economic
drag
from
the
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
with
china
s
central
bank
on
sunday
saying
it
would
cut
the
amount
of
cash
that
some
banks
must
hold
as
reserves
by
basis
points
bps
the
reduction
in
reserves
the
third
by
the
central
bank
this
year
had
been
widely
anticipated
by
investors
and
is
aimed
to
accelerate
the
pace
of
swaps
and
spur
lending
to
smaller
firms
following
the
move
the
index
of
mainland
chinese
shares
rose
percent
in
early
trade
on
the
other
hand
the
index
of
global
auto
manufacturers
which
shed
percent
last
week
remained
soft
trump
threatened
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
friday
on
all
imports
of
cars
a
month
after
his
administration
launched
an
investigation
into
whether
auto
imports
posed
a
national
security
threat
a
senior
european
commission
official
said
on
saturday
that
the
european
union
will
respond
to
any
move
to
raise
tariffs
on
cars
made
in
the
bloc
investors
and
traders
are
worried
that
threats
of
higher
tariffs
and
retaliatory
measures
by
others
could
derail
a
rare
period
of
synchronised
global
growth
oil
prices
were
supported
after
opec
and
producers
agreed
on
a
modest
increase
in
production
from
next
month
without
announcing
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
leaving
traders
guessing
how
much
more
will
actually
be
pumped
opec
and
said
in
their
statement
that
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
in
reality
there
aren
t
many
countries
that
can
raise
outputs
with
only
saudi
arabia
having
the
capacity
to
flexibly
increase
the
output
but
if
saudis
alone
increase
outputs
sharply
they
could
face
backlash
from
some
other
countries
said
tatsufumi
okoshi
senior
commodity
economist
at
nomura
securities
so
markets
seem
to
be
sceptical
how
much
saudi
can
increase
we
could
see
some
after
last
week
s
gains
but
the
market
will
be
supported
the
next
focus
will
be
on
the
size
of
output
increase
by
saudis
in
july

erdogan
and
his

claimed
victory
in

presidential
and
parliamentary
polls
on
sunday
but
his

kept
alive
worries
about

and
the

recent
comments

to
take
greater
