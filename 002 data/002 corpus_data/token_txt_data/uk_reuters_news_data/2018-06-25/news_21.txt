private

are

to
drive
a
wave
of
merger
activity
in
australia

gas
sector
hunting

amid
soaring
demand
in
china
rising

prices
and
a

recovery
the
energy
sector
has
dominated
australian
m
a
activity
over
the
past
months
led
by
a
spurned
billion
bid
for
oil
and
gas
producer
santos
and
a
billion
bid
for
pipeline
operator
apa

by

still
the
share
prices
of
smaller
companies
in
the
sector
have
yet
to
fully
reflect
the
sharp
recovery
in
oil
markets
over
the
past
year
and
gains
from
lower

costs
say
bankers
and
consultants
private

firms
clearly
see
strong
turnaround
opportunities
in
the
oil

trading
below

partner
bernadette
cullinane
firm
harbour
energy
pursued
santos
for
a
year
before
its
bid
ended
in

for
australia

sino

energy
holdings
which
has
stakes
in
two
shale

projects
in
china
more
deals
are
seen
as
small
oil
and
gas
companies
look
to
fund
new
gas
developments
to
feed
the
east
coast
market
and
bigger
companies
like
santos
look
to
replenish
their
reserves
following
years
of
cuts
in
exploration
most
of
the
market
cap
companies
with
reasonable
resources
and
cash
flow
or

would
be
attractive
to
private

funds
said
eddie
rigg
head
of
corporate
finance
at
argonaut
who
advised
a
private
chinese
firm
that
lost
out
in
a
bidding
war
for
gas
producer
awe
ltd
in
february
such
companies
include
senex
energy
central
petroleum
cooper
energy
and
strike
energy
rigg
predicted
sino
gas
will
attract
a
rival
bid
from
a
european
or
asian
group
as
most
of
the
geological
and
well
engineering
risks
on
its
project
have
been
dealt
with
it
s
a
reasonably
safe
entry
into
a
growing
gas
market
he
said
australian
domestic
gas
prices
have
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
three
years
as
east
coast
supply
has
been
sucked
into
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
feed
demand
china
s
lng
imports
driven
by
a
clean
air
push
are
expected
to
jump
percent
over
three
years
to
million
tonnes
by
according
to
australian
government
forecasts
for
investors
australia
is
handy
way
to
play
into
that
growth
australia
s
attractiveness
as
an
oil
and
gas
m
a
and
investment
proposition
is
driven
primarily
by
its
low
geopolitical
and
sovereign
risk
and
of
course
its
proximity
to
asia
s
energy
demand
centres
said
deloitte
s
cullinane
the
next
likely
target
is
in
australia
s
west
gas
supplier
quadrant
energy
potentially
worth
a
billion
is
attracting
interest
as
one
of
its
two
owners
canada
s
brookfield
asset
management
is
looking
to
sell
its
stake
bankers
say
quadrant
by
macquarie
group
produces
more
than
a
fifth
of
the
gas
going
into
the
domestic
market
in
the
state
of
western
australia
has
oil
production
and
untapped
gas
reserves
potential
suitors
include
santos
the
appeal
for
santos
is
that
it
knows
the
quadrant
business
well
as
the
companies
share
stakes
in
a
number
of
gas
fields
bankers
and
analysts
say
although
santos
may
not
want
to
risk
alienating
shareholders
by
splashing
out
on
a
deal
so
soon
after
having
rejected
a
takeover
quadrant
s
domestic
business
in
western
australia
is
a
prized
cash
cow
in
santos
portfolio
doubling
down
there
makes
sense
said
wood
mackenzie
analyst
saul
kavonic
santos
brookfield
and
macquarie
declined
to
comment
within
the
next
two
years
there
could
be
other
deals
on
the
west
coast
where
woodside
petroleum
and
chevron
corp
are
looking
to
develop
new
gas
fields
to
feed
their
lng
plants
the
biggest
hurdle
to
their
plans
is
the
myriad
of
in
their
gas
fields
and
lng
plants
all
with
competing
priorities
making
it
difficult
to
agree
on
development
plans
the
best
way
to
overcome
that
hurdle
analysts
and
bankers
say
would
be
for
woodside
or
chevron
to
buy
out
some
of
their
partners
as
woodside
did
in
february
with
the
million
purchase
of
exxonmobil
s
stake
in
the
scarborough
gas
field
obviously
if
an
interest
owner
in
a
particular
part
of
the
value
chain
no
longer
desires
to
participate
chevron
or
other
companies
are
always
looking
for
opportunities
to
improve
their
portfolio
