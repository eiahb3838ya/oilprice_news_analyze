dutch
shell
and
exxon
mobil
will
not
submit
a
claim
for

due
to
the
dutch
government
s
decision
to
halt
gas
production
at
the
groningen
field
by
the
dutch
ministry
of
economic
affairs
said

minister

said
at
the
presentation
of
his
deal
with
the
oil
majors
responsible
for
extracting
groningen
gas
that
gas
is
the
property
of
the
oil
companies
but
they
will
not
submit
a
claim
and
the
government
is
not
required
to
compensate

government
in
march
said
it
would
end
gas
production
at
the
groningen
field
by
the
end
of
the
next
decade
in
an
effort
to
stop
a
string
of
relatively
small
but
damaging
earthquakes
caused
by
gas
extraction
this
will
leave
around
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
of
gas
in
the
ground
wiebes
said
with
an
estimated
value
of
approximately
billion
euros
billion
pounds
the
decision
to
halt
groningen
production
forced
the
government
to
broker
a
new
deal
with
shell
and
exxon
mobil
whose
joint
venture
nam
is
responsible
for
the
field
nam
will
be
required
to
pump
as
much
gas
as
the
government
says
is
needed
in
the
coming
years
in
return
it
will
see
its
share
of
the
revenue
from
groningen
rise
from
to
percent
wiebes
said
starting
this
year
as
part
of
the
deal
nam
will
also
contribute
a
total
of
million
euros
to
strengthen
the
economy
in
the
groningen
region
