asian
shares
got
the
week
off
to
a
cautious
start
on
monday
amid
lingering
concerns
about
escalating
trade
frictions
while
oil
prices
maintained
hefty
gains
made
after
major
oil
producers
had
agreed
on
a
modest
increase

japan

the
falls
were
triggered
by
a
report
from
wall
street
journal
that
president
donald
trump
plans
to
bar
many
chinese
companies
from

msci

gauge

six
weeks
including
last
week
when
it
declined
one
percent
its
biggest
weekly
drop
in
three
months
as
the
threats
of
trade
wars
have
become
all
the
more
real
chinese
shares
were
among
the
biggest
losers
tumbling

last

as
trump
put
the
heat
on
beijing
threatening
to
hit

of
chinese
imports
with
percent
tariffs
policy
makers
in
china
moved
fast
to
temper
any
potential
economic
drag
from
a
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
with
china
s
central
bank
on
sunday
saying
it
would
cut
the
amount
of

that
some

points
bps
the
reserve
reduction
the
third
by
the
central
bank
this
year
had
been
widely
anticipated
by
investors
and
is
aimed
to
accelerate
the
pace
of
swaps
and
spur
lending
to
smaller
firms
another
major
victim
were
automaker
shares
which
shed
percent
last
week
trump
threatened
to
impose
a
percent
tariff
on
friday
on
all
imports
of
cars
a
month
after
his
administration
launched
an
investigation
into
whether
auto
imports
posed
a
national
security
threat
a
senior
european
commission
official
said
on
saturday
that
the
european
union
will
respond
to
any
move
to
raise
tariffs
on
cars
made
in
the
bloc
investors
and
traders
are
worried
that
threats
of
higher
tariffs
and
retaliatory
measures
by
others
could
derail
a
rare
period
of
synchronized
global
growth
oil
prices
were
supported
after
opec
and
producers
agreed
on
a
modest
increase
in
oil
production
from
next
month
without
announcing
a
clear
target
for
the
output
increase
leaving
traders
guessing
how
much
more
will
actually
be
pumped
opec
and
said
in
their
statement
that
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
in
reality
there
aren
t
many
countries
that
can
raise
outputs
with
only
saudi
arabia
having
the
capacity
to
flexibly
increase
the
output
but
if
saudis
alone
increase
outputs
sharply
they
could
face
backlash
from
some
other
countries
said
tatsufumi
okoshi
senior
commodity
economist
at
nomura
securities
so
markets
seem
to
be
sceptical
how
much
saudi
can
increase
we
could
see
some
after
last
week
s
gains
but
the
market
will
be
supported
the
next
focus
will
be
on
the
size
of
output

saudis

the

the
turkish
lira
gained
more
than
one
percent
on
expectations
of
a
stable
government
after
tayyip
erdogan
and
his
ruling
ak
party
claimed
victory
in
turkey
s
presidential
and
parliamentary
polls
on
sunday
but
his
victory
kept
alive
worries
about
inflation
and
the
central

s
independence
given
erdogan
s
recent
comments
suggesting
he
wants
to
take
greater
control
