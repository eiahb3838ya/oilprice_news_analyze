decades
of
efforts
to
curb
emissions
are
failing
leaving
not
just
small
islands
but
every
country
at
this
year
s
climate
talks
facing
the
threat
of
disaster
former
maldives
president
mohamed
nasheed
warned
on
thursday
carbon
emissions
keep
rising
and
rising
and
rising
and
all
we
seem
to
be
doing
is
talking
and
talking
and
talking
we
are
not
winning
the
battle
said
nasheed
who
is
leading
his
indian
ocean
island
state
s
negotiating
team
at
the
talks
in
poland
the
slow
pace
of
the
negotiations
and
lagging
efforts
to
change
government
and
business
policies
run
contrary
to
stark
warnings
in
an
october
science
report
that
the
world
has
about
years
left
to
clean
up
its
energy
system
or
face
potentially
catastrophic
consequences
failure
to
hold
global
warming
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
or
less
compared
to
times
would
likely
lead
to
worsening
water
and
food
shortages
rising
poverty
more
destructive
disasters
and
accelerating
natural
losses
scientists
warned
the
report
took
away
all
places
to
hide
all
the
kicking
the
can
down
the
road
said
rachel
kyte
ceo
of
sustainable
energy
for
all
seforall
and
special
representative
of
the
on
sustainable
energy
governments
and
businesses
must
swallow
the
report
not
chew
on
it
she
said
that
s
the
urgency
we
re
missing
here
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
speeding
up
efforts
to
switch
to
clean
energy
and
prepare
vulnerable
communities
for
harsher
climate
impacts
is
proving
frustratingly
intractable
for
many
reasons
a
recent
plan
by
french
president
emmanuel
macron
to
hike
taxes
on
diesel
for
instance
was
a
trigger
for
widespread
protests
over
declining
living
standards
that
has
spooked
government
officials
who
in
signed
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
climate
change
experts
say
we
have
gone
from
the
paris
of
to
the
paris
of
said
ottmar
edenhofer
a
climate
economist
and
of
the
potsdam
institute
for
climate
impact
research
in
germany
people
here
at
the
talks
say
that
what
we
learned
from
paris
is
that
to
impose
a
carbon
price
on
electricity
heat
or
gasoline
is
an
incredibly
bad
idea
that
for
a
politician
it
s
political
suicide
he
said
but
that
view
is
a
complete
misrepresentation
he
added
calling
france
s
tax
poorly
thought
out
and
badly
handled
it
is
a
combination
of
low
fuel
prices
worldwide
huge
subsidies
for
fossil
fuels
and
rising
interest
rates
that
is
making
the
higher
upfront
cost
of
solar
and
wind
power
harder
to
afford
and
slowing
down
climate
action
edenhofer
said
countries
that
want
to
curb
global
warming
should
make
sure
changes
do
not
hit
wallets
and
work
to
reduce
widening
social
inequality
to
build
trust
in
government
he
said
growing
concerns
about
air
pollution
around
the
world
are
driving
demand
for
action
in
some
regions
particularly
asian
countries
such
as
south
korea
and
china
in
korea
it
has
become
the
number
one
issue
in
elections
said
frank
rijsberman
of
the
global
green
growth
institute
based
in
seoul
that
has
led
a
government
that
previously
was
not
really
interested
in
renewable
energy
to
say
it
intends
to
phase
out
coal
though
relatively
slowly
rijsberman
said
globally
too
many
national
and
multilateral
banks
are
still
offering
to
fund
new
coal
plants
even
as
scientists
say
coal
use
must
end
rapidly
seforall
s
kyte
said
if
you
ratified
the
paris
agreement
no
instrument
of
your
government
lending
should
be
supporting
coal
anywhere
period
she
insisted
to
grow
more
cleanly
developing
countries
need
to
find
it
as
easy
to
add
renewable
power
capacity
as
coal
or
other
fossil
fuel
plants
she
added
but
so
far
a
lack
of
big
investors
in
clean
power
a
shortage
of
affordable
finance
to
cover
its
higher
initial
costs
and
insufficient
expertise
in
new
technologies
mean
coal
remains
an
easier
option
kyte
said
pushing
businesses
and
banks
to
change
faster
is
likely
to
require
making
disclosure
of
financial
risks
mandatory
as
soon
as
possible
she
said
nasheed
of
the
maldives
agreed
it
was
time
to
up
the
pressure
we
are
still
begging
the
big
polluters
to
stop
polluting
on
ethical
grounds
but
they
are
not
listening
to
us
