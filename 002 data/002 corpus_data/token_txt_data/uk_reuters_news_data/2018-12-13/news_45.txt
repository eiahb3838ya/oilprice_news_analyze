luxembourg
reuters
a
european
union
court
upheld
on
thursday
a
complaint
by
the
city
authorities
of
paris
brussels
and
madrid
against
an
eu
rule
change
on
vehicle
emissions
they
said
had
increased
pollution
and
it
partly
overturned
the
regulation
the
general
court
said
the
european
commission
s
regulatory
amendment
raising
the
limits
on
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
from
cars
and
vans
went
beyond
the
powers
of
the
eu
executive
and
broke
eu
human
rights
and
other
laws
the
general
court
upholds
the
actions
brought
by
the
cities
of
paris
brussels
and
madrid
and
annuls
in
part
the
commission
s
regulation
setting
excessively
high
oxides
of
nitrogen
emission
limits
for
the
tests
for
new
light
passenger
and
commercial
vehicles
it
said
in
a
statement
the
commission
did
not
have
the
power
to
amend
the
euro
emission
limits
for
the
new
real
driving
emission
the
french
belgian
and
spanish
capitals
have
imposed
their
own
local
restrictions
to
curb
air
pollution
the
court
said
and
notably
the
oxides
of
nitrogen
collectively
known
as
nox
emitted
especially
by
older
diesel
engines
it
said
only
the
part
of
the
commission
s
regulation
which
sets
nox
limits
must
be
annulled
not
other
parts
of
the
legislation
which
sets
out
the
conditions
for
testing
it
gave
the
commission
a
year
to
make
the
amendments
so
as
to
avoid
legal
uncertainty
over
decisions
made
already
by
consumers
and
carmakers
the
court
dismissed
a
claim
for
damages
of
a
symbolic
euro
brought
by
the
city
of
paris
the
french
capital
said
the
commission
action
had
hurt
its
image
the
court
said
no
damage
was
proven
and
if
there
were
it
would
be
compensated
for
by
the
annulment
of
the
regulation
