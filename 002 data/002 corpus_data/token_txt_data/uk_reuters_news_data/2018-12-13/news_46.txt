london

the
global
oil
market
could
move
into
deficit
sooner
than
expected
thanks
to
opec
s
output
agreement
with
russia
and
others
and
to
canada
s
decision
to
cut
supply
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
the
iea
kept
its
forecast
for
global
oil
demand
growth
at
million
barrels
per
day
unchanged
from
its
projection
last
month
and
said
it
expected
growth
of
million
bpd
this
year
uncertainty
over
the
global
economy
stemming
from
trade
tensions
could
undermine
oil
consumption
next
year
as
growth
in
supply
gathers
pace
for
our
demand
growth
outlook
remains
at
million
bpd
even
though
oil
prices
have
fallen
back
considerably
since
the
early
october
peak
the
iea
said
some
of
the
support
provided
by
lower
prices
will
be
offset
by
weaker
economic
growth
globally
and
particularly
in
some
emerging
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
agreed
last
week
with
russia
oman
and
other
producers
to
cut
oil
output
by
million
bpd
from
january
to
stem
a
in
unused
inventories
of
fuel
the
decision
by
the
government
of
canada
s
alberta
province
to
force
oil
producers
to
curtail
supply
will
bring
the
largest
reduction
to
crude
output
next
year
the
iea
said
the
oil
price
has
fallen
by
nearly
a
third
so
far
this
quarter
to
around
a
barrel
from
a
peak
close
to
in
early
october
