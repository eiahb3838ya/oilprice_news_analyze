billion
pounds
italian
investment
plan
which
includes
a
shift
to
cleaner
engines
if
rome
raises
taxes
on
petrol
and
diesel
cars
were
these
measures
to
be
confirmed
as
of
a
thorough
examination
of
their
impact
and
an
update
to
plans
already
announced
would
be
necessary
fca

europe
head
pietro
gorlier
said
in
a
letter
to
government
representatives
in
the
northern
piedmont
region
where
some
of
the
new
investment
would
be
targeted
in
an
amendment
to
the
budget
law
passed
in
italy
s
lower
house
last
week
the
government
approved
subsidies
of
up
to
euros
for
lower
emission
vehicles
but
included
a
surcharge
of
up
to
euros
on
petrol
and
diesel
cars
however
the
government
immediately
vowed
to
change
it
in
the
senate
where
it
will
be
voted
on
next
after
one
of
the
ruling
parties
contested
the
measure
italy
s
ruling
parties
the
movement
and
the
league
have
been
at
odds
over
the
issue
with
the
latter
opposing
any
new
taxes
on
cars
while
the
has
encouraged
the
new
rules
unions
and
auto
sector
associations
have
also
warned
about
the
proposed
new
tax
saying
it
would
hurt
not
only
the
carmakers
but
also
the
entire
supply
chain
and
could
cost
jobs
fca
said
last
month
it
plans
to
spend
more
than
billion
euros
on
new
models
and
cleaner
engines
in
italy
over
the
next
three
years
to
boost
jobs
and
profitability
leader
luigi
di
maio
has
since
said
the
government
would
seek
to
improve
the
measures
to
not
harm
families
in
difficulties
and
to
not
create
a
shock
to
the
italian
economy
we
will
find
a
solution
without
damaging
or
causing
a
shock
to
companies
industrial
plans
di
maio
said
when
asked
about
gorlier
s
letter
possible
changes
to
the
amendment
could
result
in
the
exclusion
of
vehicles
from
the
proposed
tax
government
officials
have
said
the
sector
scenario
has
been
significantly
modified
by
interventions
in
the
car
market
under
discussion
in
the
budget
law
which
in
our
opinion
alter
the
whole
framework
within
which
we
outlined
our
plan
for
italy
fca
s
gorlier
said
at
the
moment
we
do
not
yet
have
visibility
on
what
the
regulatory
scenario
will
be
in
the
coming
years
