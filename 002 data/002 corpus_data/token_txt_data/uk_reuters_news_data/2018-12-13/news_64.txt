global markets-asian shares, sterling up on pause in brexit, trade fears
shanghai
dec
reuters
asian
shares
and
the
pound
moved
higher
on
thursday
as
investors
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
after
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
survived
a
vote
and
as
china
appeared
to
be
taking
more
steps
to
meet
demands
to
open
its
markets
sterling
rallied
from
a
low
after
the
vote
and
was
holding
onto
gains
early
in
the
asian
trading
day
trading
at
any
respite
for
sterling
was
expected
to
be
brief
however
as
may
appeared
no
closer
to
getting
her
eu
divorce
agreement
through
parliament
raising
the
risk
of
a
chaotic
exit
in
march
the
fact
remains
that
the
eu
is
highly
unlikely
to
offer
the
reassurance
mps
are
demanding
on
the
irish
backstop
analysts
at
ing
said
adding
there
was
a
risk
that
a
parliamentary
vote
on
the
brexit
deal
will
not
take
place
until
later
in
the
first
quarter
of
in
the
meantime
the
lack
of
clarity
and
elevated
risk
of
no
deal
is
set
to
see
economic
activity
slow
further
they
said
ing
expects
uk
growth
to
halve
in
the
fourth
quarter
from
the
third
the
euro
was
also
higher
up
percent
at
after
italy
s
government
offered
to
lower
its
deficit
target
next
year
to
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
below
the
percent
level
that
the
european
commission
had
rejected
as
too
high
the
european
central
bank
is
all
but
certain
to
formally
end
its
lavish
bond
purchase
scheme
on
thursday
but
will
take
an
increasingly
dim
view
on
growth
raising
the
odds
that
its
next
step
in
removing
stimulus
will
be
delayed
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
major
rivals
edged
down
to
the
dollar
rose
a
hair
against
japan
s
currency
buying
yen
in
equity
markets
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
was
up
percent
in
early
asian
trade
after
stocks
finished
the
previous
session
higher
amid
cautious
optimism
for
progress
in
trade
talks
japan
s
nikkei
stock
index
gained
percent
while
australian
shares
were
up
percent
chinese
companies
have
bought
more
than
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
reuters
reported
wednesday
in
the
first
major
soybean
purchases
in
more
than
six
months
the
purchases
are
the
most
concrete
evidence
yet
that
china
is
making
good
on
pledges
made
when
presidents
donald
trump
and
xi
jinping
met
on
and
agreed
to
a
detente
to
negotiate
a
trade
deal
china
also
appears
to
be
toning
down
its
industrial
development
push
dubbed
made
in
china
which
has
long
irked
the
united
states
according
to
new
guidance
to
local
governments
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
beijing
will
meet
washington
s
demands
for
stronger
protection
for
intellectual
property
beijing
plans
to
replace
the
made
in
china
initiative
with
a
new
one
to
play
down
china
s
bid
to
dominate
manufacturing
and
will
seek
to
be
more
open
to
participation
by
foreign
companies
the
wall
street
journal
reported
on
wednesday
citing
people
briefed
on
the
matter
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
were
this
to
prove
true
this
is
far
more
relevant
than
china
agreeing
to
restart
purchases
of
american
soybeans
or
even
reducing
the
tariff
on
us
car
imports
from
percent
to
percent

has
been
indicated
in
