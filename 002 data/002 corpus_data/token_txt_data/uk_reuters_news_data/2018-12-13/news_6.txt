gazprom
was
interested

of

capacity
gazprom
said
on
nov
it
was
considering
whether
to
book
capacity
in
the
bulgarian
gas
system
bulgaria
saw
that
as
an
intention
to
ship
its
gas
from
turkstream
to
serbia
hungary
and
austria
through
bulgaria
moscow
has
also
suggested
that
the
option
for
an
extension
of
turkstream
via
greece
to
italy
is
also
possible
gazprom
is
building
turkstream
to
bypass
ukraine
on

amid
strong
political
tensions
with
the
west
over
russia

actions
against

that
an
extended
turkstream
along
with
nord
stream
pipeline
that
aims
to
bring
russian
gas
to
western
europe
via
the
baltic
sea
will
deepen
eu
dependence
on
russia
and
increase
moscow
s
grip
over
ukraine
brussels
has
also
said
that
bulgaria
currently
fully
dependent
on
russian
gas
needs
to
sell
russian
gas
through
its
planned
gas
hub
in
varna
along
with
gas
from
other
sources
rather
than
just
building
transit
pipelines
sofia
has
vowed
to
fully
comply
with
eu
rules
and
seek
ways
to
transit
some
of
the
gas
and
sell
part
of
it
via
its
planned
varna
hub
