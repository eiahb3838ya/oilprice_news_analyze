green power on track to overtake coal in germany by year end
frankfurt

green
energy
is
on
track
to
overtake
coal
as
germany
s
main
power
source
this
year
with
renewables
set
to
cover
a
record
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
consumption
two
percent
up
from
two
energy
industry
groups
said
on
thursday
the
figures
from
the
energy
industry
group
bdew
and
research
institute
zsw
confirm
their
forecast
in
early
november
which
predicted
the
increase
in
green
power
s
share
of
electricity
consumption
renewable
production
as
a
single
category
has
been
closing
in
on
the
contribution
of
individual
fossil
fuels
in
germany
since
the
country
embarked
on
a
path
towards
greater
reliance
on
wind
and
solar
last
decade
the
renewables
contribution
is
politically
significant
in
europe
s
biggest
economy
which
wants
the
share
of
renewables
to
reach
percent
by
the
final
numbers
each
year
depend
on
weather
patterns
which
have
to
produce
high
enough
wind
speeds
and
sunshine
to
fuel
turbines
and
solar
panels
an
extensive
drought
since
the
spring
of
resulted
in
a
fall
in
hydroelectric
power
production
by
percent
to
a
total
of
billion
kwh
the
two
groups
noted
in
a
statement
but
the
expansion
of
renewables
as
a
whole
continued
allowing
green
power
to
overtake
the
share
of
imported
hard
coal
and
domestic
brown
coal
the
two
fuels
met
percent
of
power
consumption
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
germany
relies
on
a
mixture
of
coal
renewables
nuclear
and
gas
for
its
energy
for
the
full
year
output
from
renewable
power
sources
such
as
wind
solar
biomass
and
hydropower
plants
will
contribute
a
total
billion
kilowatt
hours
kwh
the
two
parties
said
in
the
statement
this
accounts
for
percent
of
recorded
electricity
usage
of
billion
kwh
the
percent
was
made
up
of
onshore
wind
supplying
percent
offshore
wind
with
percent
biomass
with
percent
photovoltaics
with
percent
hydropower
with
percent
and
waste
and
geothermal
energy
supplying
percent
the
share
of
green
energy
had
reached
percent
of
consumption
last
year
bdew
s
managing
director
stefan
kapferer
said
that
germany
s
target
would
require
further
efforts
to
expand
wind
power
and
power
transport
links
zsw
board
chairman
frithjof
staiss
said
given
the
growing
share
of
variable
green
power
production
there
also
needed
to
be
improved
power
storage
facilities
and
demand
management
separately
the
power
industry
wants
the
government
to
enforce
more
carbon
dioxide
reductions
from
the
heat
and
transport
sectors
to
help
germany
to
meet
its
climate
goals
staiss
said
the
car
industry
had
not
improved
its
record
in
years
