analysis-opec exit frees qatar from u.s. legal concerns
reuters
even
before
taking
over
qatar
s
energy
policy
in
a
government
reshuffle
last
month
qatar
petroleum
qp
ceo
saad
had
long
wanted
the
gulf
state
to
leave
opec
kaabi
was
concerned
opec
membership
could
be
a
stumbling
block
for
qp
s
ambitions
in
the
united
states
where
it
has
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
lng
terminals
and
a
distraction
as
doha
doubles
down
on
gas
production
three
industry
sources
said
proposed
legislation
known
as
nopec
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
could
expose
members
of
the
oil
exporters
club
to
antitrust
lawsuits
a
risk
for
qp
at
a
time
it
is
planning
to
invest
billions
more
in
the
united
states
the
sources
said
qatar
s
exit
had
been
in
the
works
for
months
driven
by
kaabi
s
desire
to
focus
on
qatar
s
strength
in
liquefied
national
gas
lng
rather
than
opec
where
doha
has
little
say
anyway
because
it
doesn
t
produce
much
oil
it
takes
qatar
out
of
the
whole
debate
within
the
congress
on
whether
or
not
opec
is
a
cartel
said
james
dorsey
a
senior
fellow
at
the
rajaratnam
school
of
international
studies
if
anything
it
puts
qatar
in
america
s
good
the
decision
to
leave
after
years
just
two
days
ahead
of
a
crucial
opec
output
policy
meeting
in
vienna
last
week
also
struck
many
as
a
shot
at
saudi
arabia
which
along
with
the
bahrain
egypt
and
the
united
arab
emirates
has
imposed
a
boycott
on
qatar
since
june
the
absence
of
qatar
s
emir
from
an
annual
gulf
arab
summit
in
saudi
arabia
on
sunday
was
then
seen
as
a
sign
there
is
no
end
in
sight
to
the
dispute
and
that
qatar
is
set
to
go
it
alone
outside
a
gulf
arab
bloc
fractured
by
the
rift
qatar
would
nevertheless
still
welcome
the
lifting
of
the
trade
and
transport
boycott
which
has
hit
national
carrier
qatar
airways
companies
with
interests
in
boycotting
states
and
demand
from
regional
investors
and
banks
the
countries
boycotting
qatar
accuse
it
of
supporting
terrorism
doha
denies
the
charge
president
donald
trump
has
been
a
vocal
critic
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
blaming
it
for
high
oil
prices
opec
members
have
also
been
unnerved
by
the
souring
of
relations
over
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
kingdom
s
istanbul
consulate
the
senate
is
considering
this
week
a
joint
resolution
condemning
saudi
arabia
s
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
for
khashoggi
s
murder
trump
told
reuters
he
stands
by
the
crown
prince
as
de
facto
ruler
of
a
strategic
ally
saying
he
has
repeatedly
denied
involvement
in
the
killing
but
the
risk
of
possible
legal
action
under
nopec
has
become
a
concern
for
doha
as
it
aims
to
cement
its
rank
as
the
world
s
biggest
lng
producer
the
industry
sources
told
reuters
qp
is
the
majority
owner
of
the
huge
golden
pass
lng
terminal
in
texas
with
oil
companies
exxon
mobil
corp
and
conocophillips
holding
smaller
stakes
qp
is
also
considering
buying
gas
assets
and
is
due
to
decide
soon
on
more
investment
in
the
golden
pass
lng
project
while
qatar
is
one
of
smallest
opec
producers
with
output
of
some
barrels
per
day
or
percent
of
global
demand
it
is
one
of
the
most
influential
players
in
the
global
gas
market
thanks
to
annual
production
of
million
tonnes
of
liquefied
natural
gas
qatar
s
gas
production
has
been
a
crucial
factor
in
helping
it
weather
the
gulf
arab
boycott
and
it
plans
to
boost
capacity
percent
by
kaabi
said
in
vienna
last
week
that
being
primarily
a
gas
producer
doha
saw
no
added
value
in
belonging
to
opec
and
that
its
departure
was
percent
not
a
political
decision
we
don
t
have
enough
weight
in
opec
to
have
an
effect
he
told
reporters
on
the
eve
of
his
first
and
last
meeting
as
the
head
of
qatar
s
opec
delegation
kaabi
promised
qp
would
make
a
big
splash
soon
industry
sources
said
the
opec
exit
bore
the
hallmarks
of
a
ceo
who
has
aggressively
streamlined
qp
since
taking
the
helm
in
merging
subsidiaries
and
laying
off
thousands
of
employees
to
refocus
on
one
thing
producing
even
more
gas
it
s
consistent
with
his
desire
to
simplify
to
focus
on
oil
and
gas
and
try
to
avoid
the
peripheral
stuff
that
qp
used
to
do
it
s
very
much
in
line
with
that
drive
to
get
out
of
activities
which
are
not
fundamental
said
one
source
kaabi
a
engineer
is
one
of
qatar
s
most
powerful
figures
and
after
years
of
dealmaking
for
qp
he
is
known
as
mr
gas
although
not
a
member
of
the
ruling
family
he
is
in
charge
of
the
vital
gas
resources
in
a
country
of
just
million
people
and
is
close
to
inner
circles
the
plan
to
withdraw
from
opec
likely
started
in
june
when
kaabi
attended
opec
talks
in
vienna
with
then
energy
minister
mohammed
according
to
the
sources
due
to
the
gulf
rift
qatar
could
no
longer
attend
a
traditional
meeting
of
gulf
oil
ministers
to
agree
policy
before
talks
with
all
opec
members
the
qataris
felt
marginalized
said
one
opec
source
a
gulf
official
said
despite
the
boycott
sada
still
had
some
rapport
with
his
saudi
and
uae
counterparts
as
opec
president
in
sada
was
instrumental
in
bringing
together
oil
producers
including
russia
to
agree
a
reduction
in
supply
to
support
crude
oil
prices
but
last
month
a
government
reshuffle
removed
sada
and
elevated
kaabi
to
minister
of
state
for
energy
affairs
making
him
de
facto
energy
head
if
kaabi
came
it
won
t
be
the
same
they
don
t
have
that
same
relationship
and
the
qataris
want
to
be
part
of
the
the
official
