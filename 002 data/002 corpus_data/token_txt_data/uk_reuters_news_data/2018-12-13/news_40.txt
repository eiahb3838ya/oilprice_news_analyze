opec's oil-cut pledge is vague, but saudi plans lend some credibility
london
reuters
opec
s
deal
agreed
last
week
is
vague
even
by
the
standards
of
the
oil
producer
group
as
no
individual
output
targets
are
likely
to
be
published
although
precise
plans
from
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
boost
the
agreement
s
credibility
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
seeking
to
prevent
a
surplus
that
could
weaken
oil
prices
agreed
to
cut
production
by
percent
or
barrels
per
day
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
opec
has
published
less
detail
on
how
the
cut
will
work
than
it
did
in
when
it
first
announced
a
deal
with
its
allies
unlike
last
time
there
will
be
no
release
of
any
previously
secret
list
of
cuts
two
opec
sources
said
as
ever
there
s
a
bit
of
smoke
and
mirrors
around
the
latest
opec
deal
said
david
fyfe
an
oil
market
economist
formerly
at
trading
firm
gunvor
and
the
international
energy
agency
oil
ministers
said
the
cuts
would
be
from
october
production
levels
except
for
kuwait
and
that
iran
venezuela
and
libya
at
risk
of
output
declines
due
to
sanctions
economic
collapse
and
unrest
respectively
were
not
required
to
reduce
supply
none
of
that
was
confirmed
in
opec
s
statement
issued
after
the
vienna
meeting
still
actual
supply
cuts
could
exceed
the
promised
volume
thanks
to
saudi
arabia
riyadh
said
it
would
reduce
output
to
million
bpd
in
january
going
far
beyond
a
percent
reduction
from
october
production
of
million
bpd
the
opec
communique
is
very
vague
but
the
production
numbers
from
saudi
arabia
are
very
precise
olivier
jakob
of
oil
consultancy
petromatrix
said
the
main
thing
is
that
saudi
arabia
is
reducing
if
each
opec
country
that
is
expected
to
reduce
supplies
were
to
curb
output
by
percent
the
cutback
would
appear
smaller
than
the
reduction
announced
a
cut
of
percent
from
october
levels
for
all
bar
iran
libya
venezuela
and
qatar
looks
closer
to
a
cut
said
fyfe
although
he
still
sees
the
agreement
as
enough
to
support
prices
qatar
one
of
opec
s
smallest
oil
producers
is
leaving
the
organisation
in
january
assuming
we
lose
another
say
combined
from
iran
libya
and
venezuela
in
the
first
half
of
then
the
others
will
have
probably
done
enough
to
prevent
stockbuilds
early
next
a
third
opec
watcher
who
also
saw
the
deal
as
vague
cited
the
potential
for
unplanned
output
losses
such
as
at
libya
s
sharara
oilfield
to
give
tailwind
to
pledges
of
lower
supply
a
bit
of
a
fudge
might
turn
out
a
slight
understatement
he
said
but
in
the
end
external
events
seem
to
support
opec
sharara
at
the
moment
and
who
knows
what
in
the
following
table
shows
how
a
production
cut
of
percent
would
work
if
shared
equally
among
opec
members
minus
iran
venezuela
and
libya
the
baseline
for
the
cut
is
october
s
production
as
reported
in
opec
s
december
monthly
oil
market
report
except
for
kuwait
which
according
to
delegates
will
cut
from
september
production
production
is
in
barrels
per
day
qatar
has
been
removed
