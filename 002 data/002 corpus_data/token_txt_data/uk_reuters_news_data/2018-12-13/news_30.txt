by
to
develop
the
world
s
first
carbon
industrial
centre
by
teaming
up
emitters
with
industries
that
can
reuse
their
polluting
gases
or
by
moving
to
lower
carbon
fuels
such
as
hydrogen
it
said
on

the
government
said
it
will
commit
up

reusing
them
in
industries
such
as
brewing

britain
has
been
making
progress
in
cutting
emissions
from
the
electricity

by
increasing

as
it
seeks
to
phase
out
generation
by

to
sustain
this
track
record

need
to
tackle

energy
intensive
sectors
and
bring
clean
growth
to
our
great
industrial

industrial
emissions
such
as
from
the
production
of
steel
ceramics
and
chemicals
account
for
percent
of
the
country
s
greenhouse
gases
the
hub
could
be
developed
in
existing
industrial
regions
such
as
grangemouth
in
scotland
in
south
wales
or
in
england
at
merseyside
teeside
humberside
or

commitments
made
under
the
paris
agreement
to
keep
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
below

celsius
this
century
britain
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
have
fallen
percent
since

it
is
more
than
half
way
towards
meeting
a
legally
binding
target
to
cut
them
by
to
percent
below
levels
