markets
are
slowly
growing
less
pessimistic
about
the
chances
of
a
trade
deal
after
a
slew
of
news
this
week
pointed
to
easing
tensions
between
the
two
powers
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
that
chinese
companies
have
bought
more
than
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
in
the
first
major
soybean
purchases
in
more
than
six
months
the
purchases
are
the
most
concrete
evidence
yet
that
china
is
making
good
on
pledges
made
when
presidents
donald
trump
and
xi
jinping
met
on
and
agreed
to
a
detente
to
negotiate
a
trade
deal
but
markets
have
been
stung
by
false
dawns
in
the
past
yoshinori
shigemi
a
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
cautioned
against
reading
too
much
into
trade
headlines
trade
negotiations
are
subject
to
very
high
uncertainty
so
lots
of
headlines
come
and
go
and
markets
come
and
go
also
he
said
we
have
to
see
the
evolution
of
this
china
also
appears
to
be
toning
down
its
industrial
development
push
dubbed
made
in
china
which
has
long
irked
the
united
states
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
beijing
will
meet
washington
s
demands
for
stronger
protection
for
intellectual
property
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
were
this
to
prove
true
this
is
far
more
relevant
than
china
agreeing
to
restart
purchases
of
american
soybeans
or
even
reducing
the
tariff
on
us
car
imports
from
percent
to
percent
as
has
been
indicated
in
the
last
hours
analysts
at
national
australia
bank
said
in
a
note
but
china
s
economic
woes
are
deeper
rooted
than
just
trade
threats
and
global
investors
are
banking
that
beijing
will
roll
out
more
support
measures
in
coming
months
to
reduce
the
risk
of
a
sharper
slowdown
zhang
gang
an
analyst
at
china
central
securities
said
investor
expectations
of
further
policy
support
were
rising
ahead
of
a
key
policy
meeting
the
central
economic
work
conference
cewc
is
typically
held
in
major
economic
growth
targets
and
policy
goals
are
discussed
but
typically
not
publicly
announced
until
the
national
people
s
congress
in
march
some
analysts
expect
china
s
economic
growth
could
slow
to
around
percent
next
year
the
slowest
pace
since
from
around
percent
in
in
the
currency
market
sterling
gave
up
some
ground
after
rallying
from
a
low
after
may
survived
a
party
vote
it
was
last

analysts
expect
gains
in
the
pound
will
be
fleeting
as
may
appeared
no
closer
to
getting
her
eu
divorce
agreement
through
parliament
raising
the
risk
of
a
chaotic
exit
from
the
bloc
in
march
the
fact
remains
that
the
eu
is
highly
unlikely
to
offer
the
reassurance
mps
are
demanding
on
the
irish
backstop
analysts
at
ing
said
adding
there
was
a
risk
that
a
parliamentary
vote
on
the
brexit
deal
will
not
take
place
until
later
in
the
first
quarter
of
in
the
meantime
the
lack
of
clarity
and
elevated
risk
of
no
deal
is
set
to
see
economic
activity
slow
further
they
said
ing
expects
uk
growth
to
halve
in
the
fourth
quarter
from
the
third
the
euro
was
flat
at
after
italy
s
government
offered
to
lower
its
deficit
target
next
year
to
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
below
the
percent
level
that
the
european
commission
had
rejected
as
too
high
the
european
central
bank
is
all
but
certain
to
formally
end
its
lavish
bond
purchase
scheme
on
thursday
but
will
take
an
increasingly
dim
view
on
growth
raising
the
odds
that
its
next
step
in
removing
stimulus
will
be
delayed
the

the
