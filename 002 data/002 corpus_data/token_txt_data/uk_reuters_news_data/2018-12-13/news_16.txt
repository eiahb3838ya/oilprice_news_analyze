norwegians nonplussed at 'norway-plus' brexit idea
oslo
reuters
whatever
the
outcome
of
britain
s
tortuous
divorce
proceedings
from
europe
there
appears
to
be
little
help
waiting
in
the
wings
from
member
norway
to
join
its
own
special
relationship
with
the
bloc
some
brexit
supporters
in
britain
have
touted
a
scenario
whereby
the
world
s
fifth
largest
economy
would
emulate
the
scandinavian
country
in
finding
its
own
tailored
deal
with
the
european
union
their
idea
has
not
gained
much
domestic
momentum
but
even
so
in
oslo
there
would
be
low
prospects
of
consensus
for
any
potential
bid
to
rejoin
the
european
free
trade
association
efta
between
norway
iceland
lichtenstein
switzerland
and
the
european
union
which
it
left
in
prime
minister
erna
solberg
did
tell
reuters
that
oslo
could
lend
a
hand
but
there
would
be
little
support
from
others
in
her
governing
coalition
or
the
opposition
labour
party
norway
s
biggest
party
on
a
major
issue
needing
consensus
politicians
say
the
nations
interests
are
too
diverse
even
though
britain
is
norway
s
biggest
trading
partner
and
they
worry
entry
to
efta
could
swamp
other
members
currently
the
second
largest
eu
economy
britain
has
million
people
versus
efta
nations
combined
million
norwegian
interests
are
quite
different
from
british
interests
anniken
huitfeldt
leader
of
parliament
s
foreign
affairs
and
defence
committee
told
reuters
citing
fisheries
and
agriculture
policies
i
do
not
see
the
need
to
extend
an
invitation
for
britain
to
join
efta
said
huitfeldt
a
labour
lawmaker
norway
imposes
high
tariffs
on
food
to
protect
farmers
in
a
nation
that
stretches
into
the
arctic
whereas
britain
is
a
major
food
exporter
another
concern
is
that
london
could
veto
future
efta
decisions
said
abid
raja
vice
president
of
parliament
of
the
centrist
liberal
party
that
is
part
of
solberg
s
coalition
norway
must
think
of
its
own
interests
and
what
is
best
there
is
that
britain
holds
a
new
referendum
and
stays
in
the
eu
he
told
reuters
under
its
arrangements
norway
is
currently
part
of
the
eu
single
market
which
allows
for
free
movement
of
goods
capital
services
and
people
but
not
the
customs
union
with
the
norwegian
public
largely
disinterested
in
the
issue
the
only
political
support
for
britain
joining
efta
seems
to
be
from
two
small
parties
the
socialist
left
and
the
centre
party
which
want
to
renegotiate
norway
s
entire
relations
with
the
eu
they
think
british
membership
of
efta
would
give
oslo
better
bargaining
power
with
brussels
northern
european
countries
would
have
a
stronger
negotiating
position
and
could
assess
together
what
kind
of
relationship
we
would
want
to
have
with
the
eu

knag
fylkesnes
a
socialist
left
lawmaker
told
reuters
we
could
have
a
better
deal
for
democracy
