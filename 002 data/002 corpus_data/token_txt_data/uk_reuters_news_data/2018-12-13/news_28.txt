made
a
lacklustre
attempt
to
deliver
his
traditional
end
of
year
rally
on
thursday
as
world
stocks
squeezed
out
a
third
day
of
gains
and
the
pound
and
the
euro
both
stayed
firm
after
the
latest
bout
of
brexit
drama
uk
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
survival
in
a
late
night
vote
has
not
changed
the
markets
questions
on
brexit
but
along
with
tentative
signs
of
truces
in
the
trade
war
and
italy
s
budget
feud
it
was
enough
to
keep
them
jolly
the
nikkei
and
other
asian
stocks
had
pushed
roughly
percent
higher
and
europe
enjoyed
a
largely
uneventful
morning
even
the
confirmation
that
the
european
central
bank
was
ending
its
quantitative
easing
programme
did
little
to
rouse
activity
the
euro
rose
percent
to
having
largely
traded
in
a
and
range
since
august
that
made
the
dollar
a
touch
softer
while
the
pound
was
up
for
a
second
day
at
the
governing
council
expects
the
key
ecb
interest
rates
to
remain
at
their
present
levels
at
least
through
the
summer
of
and
in
any
case
for
as
long
as
necessary
the
ecb
said
though
the
ecb
will
technically
now
stop
qe
it
will
still
keep
buying
german
italian
and
other
euro
zone
bonds
possibly
for
years
using
proceeds
from
the
trillion
mountain
of
debt
it
has
bought
over
the
last
few
years
analysts
were
now
waiting
to
hear
what
signals
mario
draghi
sends
at
his
gmt
news
conference
next
year
will
be
his
last
in
charge
of
the
ecb
morgan
stanley
fx
strategist
hans
redeker
said
all
eyes
would
be
on
draghi
and
the
ecb
s
messaging
it
may
revise
its
growth
projections
lower
but
continue
to
prepare
the
markets
for
allowing
qe
to
italian
bond
yields
which
move
inversely
to
price
hit
their
lowest
in
six
months
after
the
country
s
government
confirmed
it
would
cut
its
deficit
goal
for
potentially
ending
months
of
wrangling
with
brussels
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
said
the
deficit
goal
had
been
lowered
to
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
from
the
percent
it
had
originally
proposed
and
it
expected
the
european
commission
to
accept
the
proposal
italian
bond
yields
tumbled
to
percent
which
took
them
back
to
where
they
were
before
a
late
may
eruption
of
tensions
triggered
the
worst
day
for
italian
debt
in
years
italy
s
and
government
bond
yields
dropped
to
their
lowest
level
in
months
while
the
closely
watched
bond
yield
spread
improved
to
its
tightest
since
the
start
of
october
i
think
the
momentum
can
carry
on
in
the
near
term
as
we
have
a
number
of
supportive
factors
for
italian
debt
beyond
just
the
hopes
the
budget
deal
can
be
reached
said
commerzbank

strategist
christoph
rieger
on
brexit
may
was
heading
to
an
eu
summit
in
brussels
after
her
confidence
vote
win
to
try
and
secure
some
additional
concessions
on
the
controversial
irish
border
aspect
of
the
agreement
to
placate
rebels
within
her
own
party
and
northern
irish
ulster
unionist
allies
markets
reckon
may
s
continued
premiership
for
now
makes
a
no
deal
brexit
less
likely
at
the
margins
and
her
survival
takes
at
least
some
of
the
immediate
headline
risk
out
of
the
market
even
if
the
parliamentary
impasse
over
the
terms
of
brexit
looks
no
closer
to
being
resolved
the
pound
was
trading
at
as
the
first
trading
started
still
well
up
more
than
cent
from
the
lows
set
early
wednesday
and
at
about
the
levels
seen
just
before
the
results
of
the
confidence
vote
on
wednesday
night
in
asia
gains
were
concentrated
in
chinese
shares
with
chinese
up
percent
and
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
gaining
percent
japan
s
nikkei
stock
index
ended
percent
higher
while
australian
shares
gained
percent
markets
are
slowly
becoming
less
pessimistic
about
the
chances
of
a
trade
deal
after
a
slew
of
news
this
week
pointed
to
easing
tensions
between
the
two
big
powers
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
that
chinese
companies
had
bought
more
than
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
in
the
first
major
soybean
purchases
in
more
than
six
months
the
purchases
are
the
most
concrete
evidence
yet
that
china
is
making
good
on
pledges
made
when
presidents
donald
trump
and
xi
jinping
met
on
and
agreed
to
a
detente
to
negotiate
a
trade
deal
but
markets
have
been
stung
by
false
dawns
in
the
past
yoshinori
shigemi
a
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
cautioned
against
reading
too
much
into
trade
headlines
trade
negotiations
are
subject
to
very
high
uncertainty
so
lots
of
headlines
come
and
go
and
markets
come
and
go
also
he
said
we
have
to
see
the
evolution
of
this
in
the
commodities
markets
oil
prices
steadied
under
pressure
from
high
inventories
but
buoyed
by
a
drawdown
in
crude
stockpiles
and
the
indications
that
the
trade
war
may
be
easing
copper
which
is
highly
sensitive
to
china
s
fortunes
also
rose
to
a
high
in
the
metals
market
at
it
approached
a
tonne
although
it
remains
badly
beaten
having
lost
almost
percent
this
year
signs
of
positive
progression
in
trade
talks
between
the
and
china
should
see
sentiment
in
the
commodity
market
remain
positive
