there
is
a
risk
that
investors
will
get
carried
away
with
optimism
over
an
easing
of
the
trade
dispute
on
the
back
of
china
resuming
purchases
of
soybeans
this
is
especially
the
case
given
there
is
yet
no
sign
of
new
imports
of
crude
oil
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
coal
the
energy
commodities
that
will
provide
a
far
better
signal
of
any
detente
in
the
trade
spat
china
ended
a
boycott
of
buying
soybeans
on
wednesday
with
companies
purchasing
at
least
tonnes
of
the
oilseed
traders
said
traders
also
said
it
appears
the
chinese
may
seek
more
soybeans
in
coming
weeks
as
they
are
struggling
to
meet
all
their
import
requirements
from
other
suppliers
this
sounds
extremely
positive
for
president
donald
trump
and
the
trade
war
truce
he
claimed
to
have
brokered
with
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
at
the
meeting
in
argentina
earlier
this
month
it
may
well
be
the
first
sign
of
a
major
thaw
between
the
two
administrations
and
it
may
even
herald
the
start
of
positive
moves
towards
some
kind
of
settlement
that
would
see
no
more
tariffs
being
imposed
and
perhaps
even
the
removal
of
the
ones
already
implemented
but
it
s
also
worth
putting
things
in
context
china
used
to
be
the
biggest
buyer
of
soybeans
taking
about
percent
of
exports
in
worth
an
estimated
billion
however
since
beijing
slapped
a
tariff
on
soybean
imports
from
the
united
states
the
trade
has
fallen
away
with
exports
to
china
dropping
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
months
of
the
year
down
from
million
in
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
government
figures
what
this
shows
is
that
china
would
have
to
dramatically
boost
its
buying
from
the
united
states
to
return
to
former
levels
which
makes
the
recent
purchase
a
spit
in
the
bucket
it
s
also
likely
that
china
finds
it
convenient
to
go
back
to
the
market
at
the
present
time
given
the
crop
is
ready
for
export
while
that
from
southern
hemisphere
rival
brazil
isn
t
this
means
there
is
a
seasonal
element
to
trade
in
soybeans
and
the
chinese
government
may
have
had
little
choice
but
to
resume
imports
but
they
have
done
so
in
a
way
that
delivers
trump
a
little
victory
that
may
appease
the
mercurial
president
what
would
be
far
more
significant
than
buying
some
cargoes
of
soybeans
which
china
needs
anyway
is
the
resumption
of
imports
of
energy
commodities
one
of
trump
s
aims
in
starting
a
trade
fight
with
beijing
was
that
he
wanted
to
reduce
the
trade
deficit
with
china
but
the
opposite
has
proven
to
be
the
case
while
trump
focused
on
putting
tariffs
on
imports
from
china
the
chinese
simply
stopped
the
one
area
of
trade
that
was
growing
rapidly
and
helping
lower
the
trade
imbalance
namely
imports
of
crude
oil
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
coal
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
china
imported
about
bpd
from
the
united
states
about
percent
of
its
total
crude
imports
but
this
dropped
to
zero
in
october
and
in
november
one
cargo
of
crude
was
discharged
according
to
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
more
importantly
there
is
no
sign
of
the
trade
resuming
with
no
cargoes
currently
booked
to
arrive
in
december
or
beyond
according
to
the
data
it
s
worth
noting
that
crude
oil
isn
t
subject
to
any
chinese
import
tariff
although
lng
and
coal
are
in
lng
no
cargoes
of
lng
arrived
in
china
in
october
although
two
were
discharged
in
november
however
no
cargoes
are
slated
for
arrival
in
december
or
beyond
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
ships
delivered
a
total
of
million
tonnes
of
lng
from
the
united
states
to
china
representing
about
percent
of
total
imports
according
to
the
data
china
imported
zero
coal
in
october
two
cargoes
totalling
about
tonnes
in
november
and
none
are
scheduled
to
arrive
in
december
or
january
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
the
majority
of
this
being
metallurgical
coal
used
in
steelmaking
obviously
this
situation
can
change
and
chinese
importers
of
crude
lng
and
coal
may
well
choose
to
resume
buying
from
the
united
states
but
perhaps
unlike
soybeans
they
don
t
have
to
as
there
are
currently
plenty
of
alternative
suppliers
if
there
really
was
a
detente
looming
in
the
trade
dispute
then
a
clear
sign
of
that
would
be
a
resumption
of
energy
imports

opinions
