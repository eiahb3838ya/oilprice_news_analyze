said
jennifer

every
country
here
needs
to
take
a
step
back
and
remember
why
we
are
here
our
very
humanity
is
at
it
remains
unclear

implement
the
paris

which
aims
to
restrict
warming

well
below
two

talk
turned
from
how
long
into
the

the
talks
may
continue
to
whether
they
could
collapse
countries
most
vulnerable
to
climate
change
called
for
the
conference
to
send
a
strong
signal
that
ambitions
to
reduce
global
emissions
should
be
enhanced
by
but
mohamed
nasheed
former
president
of
the
maldives
a
nation
threatened
by
climate
change
said
nothing
seems
to
have
changed
since
he
last
addressed
a
climate
summit
a
decade
ago
a
whole
dictionary
of
words
has
been
born
into
these
climate
conferences
we
go
round
and
round
and
round
with
these
words
and
end
up
not
getting
anywhere
carbon
emissions
are
rising
rising
and
rising
and
all
we
seem
to
be
doing
is
talking
talking
and

mohammed
sanusi
barkindo
was
a
top
billing
on
the
list
of
speakers
but
by
the
time
he
got
on
stage
during
the
plenary
on
late
wednesday
night
after
a
marathon
session
with
over
speakers
there
was
barely
a
soul
in
the
hall
to
hear
him
he
said
unequivocally
that
the
oil
industry
must
remain
and
be
part
of
the
solution
to
the
climate
change
challenge
and
that
opec
members
also
believe
there
is
no
plan
