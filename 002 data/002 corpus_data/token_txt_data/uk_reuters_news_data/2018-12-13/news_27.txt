do
all
in
its
power
to
keep
our
heads
above
water

its
delegation
at
climate

on
thursday
in
an
impassioned
appeal
for
nations
to
overcome
their
divisions
over
how
to
tackle
global
warming
the
maldives
is
among
countries
most
vulnerable
to
the
effects
of
climate
change
such
as
rising
sea
levels
and
coral
reef
deterioration
we
are
not
prepared
to
die
we
are
not
going
to
become
the
first
victims
of
the
climate
crisis
instead
we
are
going
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
keep
our
heads
above
water
mohamed
nasheed
told
delegates
at
the
talks
in
katowice
poland
climate
change
is
a
national
security
issue
for
us
it
is
an
existential
threat
he
said
adding
that
a
rise
in
global
temperatures
could
still
be
avoided
but
countries
had
to
unite
nasheed
was
the
maldives
first
democratically
elected
leader
but
was
ousted
in
in
a
coup
imprisoned
then
granted
asylum
in
britain
the
maldives
current
president
ibrahim
mohamed
solih
invited
nasheed
to
head
the
country
s
negotiating
delegation
at
the
katowice
talks
which
are
aimed
at
agreeing
rules
for
implementing
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
with
less
than
two
days
until
the
conference
is
formally
scheduled
to
end
delegates
are
still
grappling
with
many
issues
not
just
how
the
accord
will
be
implemented
including
finance
strengthening
emissions
cuts
and
monitoring
action
a
draft
more
concise
text
of
the
deal
should
be
available
later
on
thursday
but
it
is
expected
to
still
be
laden
with
brackets
for
wording
to
be
decided
on
and
gaps
since
last
addressing
a
climate
conference
in
nasheed
said
he
had
been
deposed
in
a
coup
imprisoned
and
then
forced
into
exile
but
almost
years
since
i
was
last
at
these
climate
negotiations
i
must
say
nothing
much
seems
to
have
changed
we
are
still
using
the
same
old
dinosaur
language
he
said
carbon
emissions
are
rising
rising
and
rising
and
all
we
seem
to
be
doing
is
talking
