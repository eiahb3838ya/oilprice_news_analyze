analysis-smog and a hard place: china regions caught between economic woes and pollution war
reuters
amid
a
slowing
economy
and
a
slew
of
mixed
signals
from
the
environment
ministry
china
s
embattled
local
governments
are
facing
a
dilemma
do
they
go
all
out
to
curb
smog
this
winter
or
do
their
best
to
keep
factories
humming
china
has
promised
to
put
an
end
to
a
growth
at
all
costs
economic
model
which
has
blackened
its
skies
and
contaminated
large
stretches
of
its
water
and
soil
the
government
just
embarked
on
another
winter
campaign
against
polluters
in
a
dozen
provinces
and
regions
environmental
compliance
has
become
a
key
test
of
political
loyalty
among
local
officials
but
this
year
they
must
plot
a
course
that
will
also
keep
the
economy
on
track
that
could
be
tricky
as
china
s
growth
is
at
its
slowest
since
the
global
financial
crisis
a
fact
beijing
has
acknowledged
local
governments
in
the
polluting
regions
are
working
hard
to
reduce
air
pollution
but
also
are
exhausted
said
zhu
shu
the
regional
director
of
the
east
asia
secretariat
of
the
international
council
for
local
environmental
initiatives
iclei
a
think
tank
that
helps
local
governments
tackle
pollution
though
local
authorities
have
been
asked
to
show
more
flexibility
in
cracking
down
on
polluters
the
new
approach
has
already
sown
confusion
if
officials
show
leniency
they
are
accused
of
chasing
growth
but
if
they
come
down
hard
they
are
considered
brittle
bureaucrats
with
the
goalposts
constantly
shifting
few
know
how
to
strike
the
right
balance
experts
said
we
have
seen
name
and
shame
statements
from
the
ministry
of
ecology
and
environment
accusing
local
governments
of
either
failing
to
do
their
duty
or
overdoing
it
in
a
wrong
way
said
a
researcher
with
ties
to
the
ministry
who
declined
to
be
identified
because
he
is
not
authorized
to
talk
to
the
media
china
last
year
forced
northern
cities
to
curb
industrial
output
traffic
and
coal
consumption
to
reduce
emissions
of
small
breathable
particles
known
as
by
at
least
percent
from
november
to
march
economists
with
china
s
tianfeng
securities
said
last
year
s
controls
which
included
the
closure
of
vast
numbers
of
industrial
plants
some
permanently
would
cost
jobs
in
the
region
alone
heavy
industrial
cities
throughout
the
north
have
struggled
to
diversify
their
economies
and
delegates
to
parliament
this
year
urged
beijing
to
provide
more
financial
support
the
targeted
cuts
for
are
much
lower
though
the
controls
have
now
been
extended
to
as
many
as
cities
many
are
under
pressure
to
cut
by
about
percent
but
some
are
still
making
provisions
to
close
up
to
half
of
their
factories
when
required
according
to
reuters
analysis
of
official
government
data
readings
in
the
cities
stood
at
an
average
of
micrograms
in
november
this
year
percent
higher
than
the
same
period
last
year
of
the
total
only
cities
saw
improvements
over
the
period
to
minimize
disruptions
companies
in
hebei
province
normally
china
s
most
polluted
have
also
been
placed
into
four
categories
with
only
those
in
the
lowest
class
subject
to
stringent
shutdowns
this
year
from
what
i
understand
the
government
is
turning
a
blind
eye
as
long
as
air
quality
is
good
enough
for
them
to
meet
the
targets
said
an
official
at
a
steel
mill
in
tangshan
hebei
s
top
base
who
did
not
wish
to
be
identified
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
production
cuts
are
just
a
measure
not
the
final
nevertheless
regions
that
missed
targets
last
year
will
come
under
increased
pressure
to
make
deeper
cuts
jincheng
which
saw
emissions
rise
and
its
economy
tank
in
the
first
quarter
is
still
planning
to
shut
at
least
half
of
its
industrial
plants
during
smog
authorities
must
also
outperform
neighbors
in
hebei
the
counties
and
towns
are
fined
million
yuan
and
the
money
is
awarded
to
regions
that
overachieved
officials
from
the
districts
also
face
disciplinary
measures
there
are
concerns
that
unfavorable
weather
conditions
will
put
cities
at
risk
of
missing
targets
an
official
with
a
environmental
think
tank
in
the
eastern
chinese
province
of
jiangsu
said
poor
weather
could
to
boost
smog
by
percent
this
year
last
winter
a
crude
one
size
fits
all
approach
to
the
war
on
pollution
disrupted
large
parts
of
the
industrial
economy
with
inspectors
forcing
companies
to
shut
down
whether
they
caused
smog
or
not
environment
minister
li
ganjie
promised
to
set
up
dedicated
inspectorates
to
help
make
enforcement
more
nuanced
authorities
were
also
encouraged
to
set
their
own
targets
based
on
local
circumstances
this
year
they
have
also
been
instructed
to
help
violators
comply
instead
of
simply
shutting
them
down
environment
ministry
spokesman
liu
youbin
told
a
media
briefing
in
november
that
officials
would
be
punished
if
they
went
too
far
or
not
far
enough
hundreds
have
already
been
reprimanded
while
china
wants
to
make
environmental
improvements
by
devising
new
laws
raising
standards
taxing
pollutants
and
forcing
companies
to
adopt
cleaner
production
methods
it
still
relies
on
crackdowns
to
meet
its
targets
many
local
economies
still
depend
on
polluting
industries
like
coal
or
steel
the
core
solution
to
this
dilemma
is
to
adjust
the
industrial
structure
said
zhu
that
is
a
problem
they
will
face
and
have
to
deal
with
sooner
