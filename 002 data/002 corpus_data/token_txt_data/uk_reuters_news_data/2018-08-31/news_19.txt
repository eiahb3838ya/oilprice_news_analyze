global
stocks
were
poised
on
friday
to
end
august
much
as
they
began
the
month
under
the
dark
cloud
of
a
potentially
worsening
trade
war
a
closely
watched
barometer
of
global
equities
fell
for
a
second
day
as
a
report
that
president
donald
trump
was
preparing
to
step
up
a
trade
war
with
beijing
dampened
risk
appetite
and
erased
some
gains
from
a
rally
this
week
trump
is
ready
to
impose
tariffs
on
another
billion
in

as
soon
as

ends

very
hard
to
see
a
decisive
resuscitation
of

appetite
until
these
tensions
are
resolved

we
have
learned
to
to
some
of

yourself

set
for
a

a
growing
