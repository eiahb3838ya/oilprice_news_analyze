oil
analysts
cut
their
price
forecasts
for
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
year
in
august
given
growing
concern
over
the
impact
on
crude
demand
from
escalating
trade
tensions
although
falling
supply
particularly
from
iran
would
likely
limit
losses
a
reuters
poll
showed
on
friday
a
survey
of
economists
and
analysts
forecast
brent
crude
to
average
a
barrel
in
cents
lower
than
the
projected
in
the
previous
month
s
poll
and
above
the
average
so
far
this
year
the
price
was
forecast
to
average
in
crude
futures
were
forecast
to
average
a
barrel
in
compared
with
forecast
last
month
and
an
average
of
until
now
the
eventual
loss
of
iranian
barrels
is
likely
to
match
if
not
exceed
the
amount
seen
during
the
round
of
sanctions
in
said
harry
tchilinguirian
global
head
of

strategy
at

paribas
supply
is
also
at
risk
in
countries
like
venezuela
libya
and
angola
he
said
these
supply
side
factors
presents
strong
upside
for
oil
sanctions
on
iran
s
energy
sector
will
come
into
force
on
although
the
country
s
crude
oil
and
condensate
exports
are
already
expected
to
have
fallen
to
a
low
in
august
the
united
states
wants
to
force
buyers
of
iranian
oil
to
cut
their
imports
from
opec
s
producer
to
nothing
after
an
international
nuclear
deal
between
the
two
nations
was
dissolved
however
there
is
a
concern
among
analysts
that
global
trade
disputes
could
undermine
economic
growth
which
in
turn
may
mean
asian
importers
demand
for
crude
oil
declines
the
united
states
is
embroiled
in
an
trade
war
with
multiple
countries
especially
china
trade
tensions
could
slow
oil
demand
growth
in
asia
likewise
possible
contagion
of
the
turkey
crisis
slower
demand
growth
would
make
it
easier
to
replace
iranian
barrels
said
carsten
fritsch
senior
commodities
analyst
at
commerzbank
analysts
said
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
would
continue
to
adjust
its
crude
supply
to
ensure
the
global
oil
market
remained
in
balance
saudi
arabia
will
be
a
strong
contender
to
fill
in
the
supply
deficit
caused
by
iran
sanctions
and
tensions
elsewhere
in
the
coming
months
a
majority
of
industry
experts
said
at
the
moment
the
market
is
looking
balanced
over
the
assuming
iranian
supply
falls
by
around
barrels
per
day
the
obvious
upside
risk
is
if
iranian
losses
are
greater
than
this
as
this
would
push
the
market
into
deficit
over
the
final
quarter
