the
economy
shows
signs
of
extending
its
expansion
with
the
help
of
tax
cuts
and
strong
business
and
consumer
confidence
both
the
longevity
of
the
expansion
and
the
apparent
limited
slack
in
the
labour
and
product
markets
suggest
the
current
pace
of
growth
is
probably
not
sustainable
in
the
medium
term
the
current
cyclical
expansion
is
months
old
and
will
be
the
longest
on
record
if
the
economy
is
still
growing
in
july
while
longevity
alone
is
not
a
good
predictor
of
cyclical
turning
points
with
most
financial
and
economic
indicators
close
to
highs
the
balance
of
risks
is
shifting
what
matters
primarily
is
not
the
passage
of
calendar
time
but
what
happens
over
time
in
and
to
the
economy
in
motion
it
is
historical
and
psychological
time
filled
with
events
and
processes
perceptions
and
actions
there
is
a
simple
corollary
knowledge
of
the
current
phase
of
the
business
cycle
and
its
age
can
help
but
must
not
be
used
in
isolation
victor
zarnowitz
a
leading
expert
on
business
cycles
wrote
in
the
variability
in
length
of
business
expansions
and
contractions
is
sufficiently
large
for
the
timing
of
cyclical
turning
points
to
be
very
difficult
to
forecast
the
age
of
a
phase
alone
is
not
of
much
help
in
predicting
its
end
what
matters
more
is
the
dynamics
of
the
evolving
business
situation
business
cycles
theory
history
indicators
and
forecasting
zarnowitz
zarnowitz
went
on
to
observe
the
largest
errors
in
forecasts
are
made
in
the
vicinity
of
business
cycle
and
growth
cycle
turning
points
particularly
peaks
many
forecasts
are
overly
influenced
by
the
most
recent
events
or
developments
they
rely
on
the
persistence
of
local
trends
and
are
insufficiently
cyclical
in
the
sense
they
miss
recessions
and
fears
about
a
future
slowdown
in
the
economy
have
grown
as
the
treasury
curve
has
come
closer
to
inverting
given
the
close
correlation
between
slowdowns
and
inversions
over
several
decades
yields
on
treasury
paper
with
two
years
to
maturity
are
now
just
basis
points
below
yields
on
notes
the
narrowest
gap
since
a
few
months
before
the
start
of
the
last
recession
in
december
the
yield
curve
exhibits
strongly
cyclical
behaviour
with
a
large
negative
gap
during
economic
slowdowns
and
a
smaller
negative
gap
or
even
a
positive
one
during
expansions
to
some
extent
whether
or
not
the
curve
actually
inverts
is
arbitrary
since
there
is
no
special
significance
in
the
zero
line
and
the
average
has
been
around
basis
points
so
the
current
gap
is
already
in
the
percentile
of
the
distribution
across
multiple
cycles
since
and
the
is
economy
already
well
into
the
cycle
s
phase
it
is
not
possible
to
predict
either
the
precise
timing
or
the
depth
of
the
next
slowdown
but
the
narrowing
yield
gap
indicates
the
distribution
of
risks
over
the
next
couple
of
years
is
now
skewed
to
the
downside
there
are
more
scenarios
in
which
something
could
go
wrong
accelerating
inflation
an
emerging
markets
crisis
monetary
policy
errors
or
a
deterioration
in
corporate
finances
and
fewer
in
which
everything
goes
right
the
current
yield
gap
is
consistent
with
a
wealth
of
other
indicators
including
purchasing
surveys
consumer
confidence
unemployment
retail
price
inflation
freight
movements
and
the
escalation
in
share
prices
they
all
point
to
an
economy
approaching
a
cyclical
peak
and
then
likely
to
move
into
a
period
of
more
moderate
growth
if
not
recession
over
the
next
to
months
the
critical
question
is
whether
the
next
slowdown
when
it
comes
proves
just
a
pause
in
an
otherwise
sustained
expansion
or
marks
an
end
to
the
current
cycle
and
start
of
a
new
one
