japan's nuclear reboot gathers pace, set to curtail lng demand
tokyo
reuters
japan
s
consumption
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
is
set
to
fall
as
the
country
s
nuclear
reactors
restart
with
output
from
atomic
power
set
for
its
highest
since
the
aftermath
of
the
fukushima
disaster
kansai
electric
power
will
restart
the
mw
no
reactor
at
its
takahama
station
later
on
friday
a
spokesman
told
reuters
the
kansai
restart
followed
kyushu
electric
power
bringing
back
the
no
reactor
at
its
sendai
plant
on
wednesday
kyushu
now
has
four
reactors
running
each
returning
reactor
will
cut
demand
for
lng
by
as
much
as
million
tonnes
a
year
said
kosho
tamura
a
gas
analyst
at
japan
oil
gas
and
metals
national
corp
the
return
of
japan
s
nuclear
capacity
should
lead
to
lower
imports
of
fossil
fuels
especially
lng
while
that
is
a
positive
for
japan
s
utilities
especially
as
lng
prices
are
near
highs
in
asia
the
loss
of
japanese
demand
could
undermine
the
demand
outlook
for
the
global
market
japan
is
the
world
s
biggest
buyer
of
lng
it
s
a
good
thing
that
the
power
utilities
in
western
japan
have
restarted
nuclear
plants
which
is
leading
to
the
cuts
in
fossil
fuel
costs
primarily
lng
through
the
continued
operations
of
nuclear
plants
said
tomoko
murakami
manager
of
the
nuclear
energy
group
at
the
institute
of
energy
economics
japan
ieej
kansai
is
japan
s
utility
by
sales
and
was
the
most
reliant
on
nuclear
power
before
the
march
fukushima
disaster
when
a
nuclear
power
plant
owned
by
tokyo
electric
power
suffered
meltdowns
after
an
earthquake
and
tsunami
before
the
disaster
japan
had
the
world
s
reactor
fleet
which
provided
about
of
its
electricity
but
the
plants
were
shut
down
for
relicensing
after
fukushima
highlighted
regulatory
failings
kansai
will
have
three
units
operating
and
expects
to
have
another
reactor
at
takahama
restarted
in
november
after
shutting
it
down
earlier
this
month
for
maintenance
and
refuelling
its
spokesman
said
those
three
units
will
save
about
billion
billion
pounds
in
fuel
costs
each
year
they
are
running
the
kansai
spokesman
said
declining
to
comment
on
what
fuels
it
would
substitute
operating
kyushu
s
nuclear
units
will
save
the
company
about
billion
in
annual
costs
based
on
current
lng
prices
its
spokeswoman
said
with
two
more
reactors
likely
to
restart
by
the
end
of
the
year
when
japan
enters
its
peak
demand
period
as
much
as
million
tonnes
of
lng
demand
could
be
replaced
by
nuclear
operations
japan
s
electric
power
utilities
burn
less
lng
as
reactors
return
the
country
s
use
of
lng
in
power
generation
has
been
declining
this
year
as
more
reactors
return
in
june
lng
imports
fell
to
the
lowest
monthly
amount
since
may
and
for
the
year
through
to
july
are
down
percent
the
fukushima
disaster
sparked
the
country
s
worst
energy
crisis
in
the
period
forcing
it
to
import
record
amounts
of
lng
and
driving
prices
to
record
highs
utilities
also
turned
to
cheaper
coal
imports
