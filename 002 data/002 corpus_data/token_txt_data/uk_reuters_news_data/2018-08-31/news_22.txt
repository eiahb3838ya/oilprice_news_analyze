dam nation: big state projects spared in china's hydro crackdown

in
a
mountain
village
in
southwest
china
s
sichuan
province
authorities
have
demolished
seven
small
dam
projects
this
year
along
a
river
to
clear
illegal
developments
in
a
new
nature
reserve
the
demolition
is
part
of
a
nationwide
program
to
close
hundreds
of
tiny
and
often
ramshackle
dams
and
turbines
and
bring
order
to
china
s
massive
hydropower
sector
after
years
of
unconstrained
construction
the
dams
sat
on
an
unnamed
tributary
of
the
fierce
and
dadu
river
which
feeds
into
the
yangtze
asia
s
largest
and
longest
river
where
the
government
says
the
irregular
development
of
thousands
of
small
hydropower
projects
has
wrecked
the
ecology

but
green
groups
say
the
campaign
will
not
necessarily
save
the
environment
because
it
will
not
affect
big
state
hydropower
stations
which
they
say
have
caused
the
most
damage
on
the
zhougong
river
another
tributary
farmer
zhang
who
declined
to
give
his
full
name
reckons
big
dams
have
devastated
the
ecology
zhang
described
himself
as
a
hydropower
migrant
after
his
land
was
inundated
by
state
dam
builders
years
ago
he
said
changes
in
the
zhougong
s
flow
and
temperature
had
devastated
the
local
fish
population
with
one
species
favored
by
the
former
leader
deng
xiaoping
now
wiped
out
the
fish
here
now
taste
terrible
and
are
fit
only
for
dogs
he
said
pointing
to
three
silver
carp
he
had
caught
after
they
were
swept
down
river
by
flood
waters
from
an
upstream
reservoir
china
triggered
an
aggressive
damming
program
years
ago
as
it
looked
for
ways
to
develop
industry
and
bring
electricity
to
poor
rural
regions
not
connected
to
the
power
grid
investors
rushed
in
and
environmentalists
likened
the
frenzy
to
the
construction
of
backyard
steel
smelters
during
the
great
leap
forward
a
program
that
aimed
to
industrialize
china
s
agrarian
society
but
caused
widespread
famine
as
farmers
made
metal
instead
of
food
now
the
government
wants
to
reverse
course
and
the
environmentally
conscious
leadership
must
decide
how
much
of
china
s
gigawatts
of
capacity
needs
to
close
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
expensive
state
investments
hydropower
was
a
good
thing
at
the
time
but
as
is
often
the
case
in
china
it
turns
into
a
swarm
and
we
basically
lose
control
said
chen
guojie
a
hydropower
expert
with
the
china
academy
of
sciences
in
chengdu
central
china
sichuan
underlines
the
case
total
hydropower
reached
more
than
gw
in
greater
than
the
total
in
most
asian
countries
it
was
also
more
than
double
the
capacity
of
the
province
s
power
grid
meaning
lots
of
wasted
power
china
s
official
hydropower
capacity
was
about
gw
at
the
end
of
june
and
around
a
third
of
that
is
considered
small
hydropower
projects
of
less
than
mw
china
s
overall
power
capacity
including
coal
and
nuclear
plants
is
gw
in
june
state
auditors
identified
small
hydropower
projects
in
the
regions
along
the
yangtze
and
said
the
environmental
costs
of
some
plants
were
too
high
even
though
they
had
made
historical
contributions
to
development
a
month
later
beijing
ordered
the
regions
to
ban
new
construction
and
rectify
illegal
projects
although
it
remains
uncertain
how
many
will
be
decommissioned
there
is
no
unified
standard
and
we
still
aren
t
clear
which
plants
should
be
demolished
and
which
ones
retained
said
yang
yong
chairman
of
the
hengduan
mountain
research
society
a
environmental
group
the
government
says
small
dams
have
disrupted
the
habitats
and
breeding
patterns
of
many
rare
species
of
fish
although
green
groups
argue
the
damage
wrought
by
bigger
dams
is
more
severe
with
entire
towns
and
ecosystems
submerged
in
water
which
they
say
increases
the
risk
of
earthquakes
landslides
and
even
climate
change
on
the
km
zhougong
authorities
have
already
demolished
small
projects
built
in
nature
reserves
or
encroaching
upon
new
ecological
red
lines
drawn
up
to
shield
a
quarter
of
china
s
territory
from
development
but
the
river
houses
larger
stations
run
by
some
of
the
country
s
biggest
firms
including
guodian
huadian
and
the
state
grid
corp
and
the
overdevelopment
of
the
river
was
criticized
by
the
environment
ministry
earlier
this
year
none
of
the
firms
or
their
local
subsidiaries
responded
to
requests
for
comment
central
utilities
have
long
urged
regulators
to
crack
down
on
small
poorly
planned
dams
which
they
say
have
eroded
their
own
profits
hengduan
s
yang
suspects
small
plants
are
being
shut
down
to
free
up
grid
access
for
bigger
dams
these
small
hydropower
plants
originally
had
grid
agreements
and
if
they
were
legal
they
could
connect
he
said
if
they
can
t
access
the
grid
because
there
are
many
big
plants
that
isn
t
as
far
as
zhang
the
farmer
is
concerned
big
hydro
has
already
squeezed
the
life
from
the
zhougong
on
which
people
have
depended
for
decades
tens
of
thousands
of
people
have
made
their
living
here
but
soon
it
won
t
be
possible
