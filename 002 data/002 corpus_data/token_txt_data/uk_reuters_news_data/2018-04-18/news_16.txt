update 1-exclusive-viability of french-spain gas pipeline questioned - report
paris
reuters
a
report
prepared
for
the
european
commission
has
questioned
the
economic
viability
of
plans
to
build
a
huge
gas
pipeline
between
spain
and
france
designed
to
boost
security
of
supply
in
europe
five
sources
told
reuters
the
commission
has
long
backed
the
billion
euro
billion
midcat
pipeline
that
would
more
than
double
the
amount
of
gas
that
can
be
piped
across
the
pyrenees
mountains
that
border
the
two
nations
french
gas
grid
terega
owned
by
italy
s
snam
and
spain
s
enagas
want
to
invest
in
the
project
which
has
strong
support
from
european
union
climate
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
a
spanish
national
but
the
project
has
faced
opposition
from
french
energy
regulator
cre
who
says
midcat
would
push
up
consumer
prices
without
improving
security
french
gas
network
firm
grtgaz
also
questions
the
need
for
the
pipeline
now
a
study
by
poyry
a
consultancy
appointed
to
assess
the
first
phase
of
midcat
for
the
commission
indicates
the
project
is
unlikely
to
be
economically
viable
it
said
it
would
only
achieve
financially
viability
in
scenarios
with
a
tight
lng
market
the
study
says
the
step
pipeline
across
the
pyrenees
the
first
and
central
part
of
the
broader
midcat
project
would
only
be
viable
if
lng
prices
over
a
long
period
remained
significantly
higher
than
pipeline
gas
prices
specialists
say
that
is
unlikely
the
report
seen
by
reuters
will
be
the
basis
for
a
commission
discussion
on
wednesday
of
priority
eu
infrastructure
plans
termed
projects
of
common
interest
pci
the
commission
has
declined
requests
to
release
the
report
citing
commercial
confidentiality
and
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
poyry
declined
to
comment
terega
infrastructure
director
michel
boche
said
the
step
pipeline
would
cost
million
euros
of
which
million
for
terega
and
million
for
enagas
the
firms
have
sent
an
investment
proposal
to
the
cre
in
october
they
will
present
the
case
to
the
european
union
which
could
provide
subsidies
of
up
to
percent
regulated
network
operators
typically
earn
around
a
percent
return
on
their
asset
base
on
such
projects
boche
said
the
expected
flow
would
be
mainly
from
france
to
spain
but
the
interconnector
would
be
reversible
in
case
of
need
last
winter
gas
flowed
from
spain
to
france
only
about
two
days
to
boost
britain
s
gas
supplies
during
a
cold
spell
many
experts
question
the
need
for
another
interconnector
saying
that
existing
pipelines
are
already
underutilised
even
during
periods
of
high
demand
if
there
were
a
real
demand
for
midcat
the
market
would
already
have
built
those
interconnectors
said
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
poyry
report
the
project
has
attracted
critics
the
midcat
project
is
not
coherent
with
the
eu
s
climate
commitments
and
its
promises
to
reduce
reliance
on
fossil
energy
said
michele
rivasi
a
french
member
of
the
european
parliament
friends
of
the
earth
europe
s
antoine
simon
said
step
was
designed
as
a
precursor
to
a
bigger
billion
euro
investment
in
the
midcat
pipeline
across
france
and
the
iberian
peninsula
step
is
a
reasonable
project
that
responds
to
the
desire
of
the
heads
of
state
of
france
spain
and
portugal
to
strengthen
our
gas
interconnections
and
boost
security
of
supply
in
europe

boche
said
spanish
european
mp
xabier
benito
ziluaga
said
midcat
made
no
economic
sense
and
that
madrid
backed
the
plan
to
support
its
gas
industry
it
is
a
project
based
on
private
interests
not
on
public
interest
or
objective
evidence
