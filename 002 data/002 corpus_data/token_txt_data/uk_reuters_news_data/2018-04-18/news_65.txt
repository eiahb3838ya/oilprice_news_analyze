britain's costa promises to recycle half a billion coffee cups by 2020
london
reuters
britain
s
costa
coffee
pledged
on
wednesday
to
recycling
half
a
billion
coffee
cups
a
year
by
and
said
it
seeks
to
become
the
first
chain
to
guarantee
it
recycles
the
same
number
of
cups
as
it
puts
onto
the
market
less
than
percent
of
coffee
cups
are
recycled
in
britain
which
has
led
to
politicians
calling
for
a
latte
levy
on
disposable
cups
britain
has
resisted
those
calls
and
instead
encourages
voluntary
measures
to
limit
cup
use
costa
said
there
was
a
misconception
that
coffee
cups
could
not
be
recycled
and
that
while
the
process
was
more
costly
it
had
reached
agreements
with
five
waste
disposal
firms
to
guarantee
more
cups
would
be
recycled
we
think
it
s
a
really
neat
solution
because
it
is
effective
immediately
dominic
paul
managing
director
of
costa
coffee
told
reuters
it
s
not
directly
because
of
the
conversations
about
the
tax
it
s
something
we
ve
been
working
on
for
quite
a
veolia
biffa
suez
grundon
and
first
mile
are
working
with
costa
on
the
scheme
which
will
start
in
offices
transport
hubs
and
other
locations
costa
said
it
would
pay
waste
management
companies
pounds
per
tonne
of
cups
collected
combined
with
the
pounds
per
tonne
they
currently
receive
it
makes
it
economically
viable
for
the
firms
to
collect
the
cups
an
additional
five
pounds
per
tonne
will
go
to
an
auditor
costa
which
is
owned
by
whitbread
said
the
costs
of
the
programme
would
not
be
material
for
the
target
of
million
cups
for
the
next
months
the
estimated
cost
is
just
under
pounds
the
goal
is
for
million
cups
to
be
recycled
by
the
chain
competes
with
companies
like
starbucks
pret
a
manger
caffee
nero
and
greggs
on
the
british
high
street
and
paul
said
that
other
firms
should
join
the
scheme
we
think
our
competitors
should
join
us
on
this
it
s
the
quickest
way
to
get
a
material
number
of
cups
recycled
he
said
if
none
of
our
competitors
joined
us
on
this
we
would
still
do
it
ultimately
that
is
going
to
be
