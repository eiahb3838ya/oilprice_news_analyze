angola
s
finance
ministry
said
it
had
requested
assistance
from
the
international
monetary
fund
to
help
it
implement
economic
reforms
as
africa
s
crude
producer
continues
to
suffer
from
a
lower
oil
price
the
agreement
known
as
a
policy
coordination
instrument
will
help
to
improve
the
external
credibility
of
our
country
with
positive
impact
on
the
ability
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
the
finance
ministry
said
in
a
statement
late
on
tuesday
the
ministry
said
it
wanted
help
in
implementing
the
macroeconomic
stabilisation
plan
which
is
effectively
the
economic
policy
of
the
new
angolan
government
but
did
not
say
what
form
this
should
take
president
joão
lourenço
who
took
over
last
september
after
years
of
rule
by
josé
eduardo
dos
santos
has
said
he
wants
to
bring
about
an
economic
miracle
in
angola
by
opening
up
to
foreign
investment
and
diversifying
away
from
oil
which
accounts
for
over
percent
of
exports
lourenço
is
trying
to
resolve
a
dollar
liquidity
squeeze
that
has
made
it
difficult
for
foreign
companies
to
repatriate
profits
and
discouraged
many
from
investing
in
africa
s
economy
on
the
streets
of
luanda
a
dollar
goes
for
nearly
twice
the
official
rate
a
devaluation
of
around
percent
to
the
dollar
this
year
has
gone
some
way
to
closing
the
gap
with
the
street
rate
angola
has
been
trying
to
persuade
international
banks
to
rekindle
dollar
correspondent
relationships
with
the
country
which
were
cut
over
the
past
few
years
due
to
perceived
compliance
