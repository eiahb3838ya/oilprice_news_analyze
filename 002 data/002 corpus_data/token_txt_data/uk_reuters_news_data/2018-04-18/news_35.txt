quiet no more, french village becomes centre of anti-nuclear protest

the
residents
of
the
french
village
of
bure
lived
a
quiet
life
until
the
government
began
testing
the
feasibility
of
storing
nuclear
waste
there
now
bure
is
rocked
by
protests
as
a
final
decision
on
the
project
looms
for
the
past
years
french
nuclear
waste
agency
andra
has
tested
the
stability
of
the
clay
of
the
northeastern
village
to
see
if
it
could
hold
radioactive
waste
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
andra
is
preparing
a
formal
request
for
next
year
to
build
the
billion
euro
billion
facility
to
hold
waste
from
the
reactors
of
utility
edf
french
nuclear
regulator
asn
has
already
said
the
plan
is
sound
and
deep
geological
storage
is
the
safest
way
to
protect
future
generations
from
radioactive
waste
but
a
police
van
at
the
main
square
is
testimony
to
rising
tensions
and
demonstrations
that
have
at
times
blocked
the
area
where
andra
wants
to
dig
life
will
become
unbearable
here
with
the
nuclear
waste
and
all
the
demonstrators
said
bure
mayor
gerard
antoine
who
breeds
beef
cattle
antoine
approved
the
installation
of
andra
research
facilities
two
decades
ago
but
said
he
now
regrets
that
decision
and
would
say
no
if
he
were
asked
today
hundreds
of
demonstrators
who
built
a
camp
nearby
were
kicked
out
by
police
in
february
but
say
they
are
there
for
the
long
run
and
will
fight
the
project
until
the
government
changes
its
plans
we
are
heading
straight
for
a
nuclear
disaster
that
s
why
we
re
against
it
said
fleury
a
local
elected
official
with
an
environmentalist
party
police
are
maintaining
a
heavy
presence
while
protesters
have
regrouped
in
and
around
a
house
in
the
bure
village
centre
the
future
cigeo
site
is
designed
to
cover
an
area
of
hectares
and
have
kilometres
of
underground
galleries
where
nuclear
waste
would
be
buried
in
huge
cylinders
andra
which
carried
out
research
work
via
a
research
laboratory
metres
underground
wants
to
start
work
on
the
site
in
and
complete
it
by
we
re
not
going
to
do
deep
burial
of
nuclear
waste
if
we
had
any
doubt
that
it
would
leak
or
contaminate
the
environment
said
andra
spokesman
mathieu
saint
louis
the
ultimate
goal
with
an
underground
installation
such
as
this
one
is
precisely
to
protect
ourselves
from
the
danger
of
nuclear
for
now
spent
fuel
from
french
nuclear
reactors
is
stored
in
pools
next
to
the
reactors
before
it
is
shipped
to
nuclear
fuel
group
orano
s
recycling
plant
in
la
hague
western
france
but
la
hague
is
not
designed
for
storage
and
france
does
not
have
a
solution
years
after
investing
heavily
in
nuclear
energy
other
countries
that
use
nuclear
power
face
the
same
problem
the
bure
site
is
designed
so
that
nuclear
waste
could
be
retrieved
for
the
first
years
if
scientists
find
a
better
solution
than
burying
it
otherwise
the
underground
galleries
will
be
permanently
sealed
with
concrete
activists
say
deep
geological
storage
does
not
offer
perfect
guarantees
against
radiation
leakage
in
ground
water
they
want
the
waste
moved
to
underground
facilities
that
are
just
a
few
metres
deep
to
monitor
it
