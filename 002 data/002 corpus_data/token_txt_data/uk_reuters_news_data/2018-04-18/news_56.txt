were
signs

caution
in

leave

it
judged

were
to
the
downside
citing
financial
vulnerabilities
geopolitical
strains
and
tariffs
the
global
narrative
has
quickly
shifted
from
synchronous
global
growth

growth
and
glimmers
of
inflation
in
early

a
focus
on
tariffs
and

strategy
at

we
ultimately
believe
that
we
will
see
a

solution
but
there
is
still
a
long

to
go
and
further
bouts
of
volatility
and

seem
worries
about
the
longevity
of
the
economic
expansion
were
one
reason
the

was
at
its
