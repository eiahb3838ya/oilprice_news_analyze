in sweden, wind farms and warplanes battle for airspace
oslo
reuters
several
wind
farm
projects
in
sweden
are
under
threat
due
to
the
government
s
decision
to
reserve
more
airspace
for
its
armed
forces
according
to
two
companies
and
an
industry
lobby
group
in
november
the
government
said
its
air
force
had
labelled
more
airspace
as
zones
in
order
to
protect
its
operations
from
the
expanding
wind
power
industry
the
move
to
avoid
planes
colliding
with
wind
turbines
has
created
uncertainty
for
a
number
of
planned
wind
farms
sweden
s
largest
utility
vattenfall
said
the
decision
affected
at
least
four
of
its
projects
which
together
could
generate
around
gigawatt
gw
of
power
such
projects
would
lose
the
permits
and
couldn
t
be
built
spokesman
peter
stedt
said
referring
to
two
of
the
projects
that
have
been
approved
in
all
some
gw
of
planned
wind
power
production
could
be
cancelled
according
to
industry
lobby
svensk
vindenergi
equivalent
to
percent
of
sweden
s
current
wind
production
around
gw
of
that
relates
to
wind
farms
with
permits
and
gw
to
projects
awaiting
approval
it
said
eolus
vind
which
builds
wind
farms
and
has
projects
under
consideration
in
the
affected
areas
said
it
needed
more
clarity
from
authorities
clarification
is
important
so
that
developers
do
not
spend
money
on
projects
that
have
a
low
chance
of
being
permitted
due
to
the
views
of
the
armed
forces
said
spokesman
johan
hammarqvist
the
government
said
projects
that
have
been
approved
should
not
be
affected
plants
that
already
have
permits
to
build
should
normally
not
be
affected
by
the
new
areas
energy
minister
ibrahim
baylan
told
reuters
sweden
aims
to
meet
its
energy
needs
without
producing
global
warming
carbon
dioxide
by
and
defence
interests
should
be
balanced
with
energy
targets
he
added
but
svensk
vindenergi
said
several
companies
with
approved
farms
will
have
to
reapply
for
permits
because
they
need
to
build
turbines
that
are
higher
than
originally
planned
and
are
therefore
at
risk
of
being
refused
many
of
the
permitted
parks
have
a
maximum
height
of
metres
in
general
at
least
metres
is
needed
to
reach
the
wind
needed
to
be
able
to
realise
the
project
with
today
s
low
price
on
electricity
and
certificates
said
hallberg
some
projects
could
still
be
considered
in
the
newly
designated
areas
the
armed
forces
said
in
some
cases
the
thorough
analysis
that
is
always
performed
might
conclude
that
a
wind
power
project
can
coexist
in
some
specific
areas
its
press
office
told
reuters
according
to
svensk
vindenergi
the
government
s
decision
affects
percent
of
sweden
s
territory
up
from
percent
previously
the
energy
ministry
and
the
armed
forces
did
not
provide
their
own
calculations
of
the
area
affected
with
the
military
saying
the
