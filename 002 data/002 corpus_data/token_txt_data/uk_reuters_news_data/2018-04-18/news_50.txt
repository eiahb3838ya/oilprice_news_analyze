cut

at

i
think
that

the

scope

a

more

fund
managers
named
the
threat
of

as
the

tail

while
they

monetary
tightening
proceeding
at
a
different

on
either

making
its
mark
on

the
gap
between

german
bonds
reached
its
widest
in
nearly
years
reflecting
the
diverging
monetary
policy
outlook
in
some
ways
i
am
sort
of
surprised
that
it
hasn
t
mattered
more
said
fenton
referring
to
the
divergence
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
helped
european
equity
prices
more
on

the
gap
between

government

widened
slightly
in
early

having
fallen

points
overnight
i
would
worry
if
the

got
inverted
said
fenton
adding
it
s
probably
a
bit
premature
to
get
too
bent
out
of
shape
about
it
the
rise
