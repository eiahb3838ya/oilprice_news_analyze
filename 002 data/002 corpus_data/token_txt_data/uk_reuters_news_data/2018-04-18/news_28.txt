russian energy ministry - tax change could boost oil output
moscow
april
reuters
the
russian
energy
ministry
has
proposed
changes
to
a
draft
oil
production
law
that
it
says
could
boost
production
by
around
tonnes
per
year
first
deputy
energy
minister
alexei
texler
said
on
wednesday
debate
about
the
law
has
dragged
on
for
years
as
the
finance
ministry
expressed
concerns
the
changes
could
reduce
state
revenues
oilfields
especially
in
west
siberia
have
become
increasingly
depleted
and
the
new
tax
regime
is
seen
as
an
incentive
to
produce
more
oil
in
a
country
which
is
heavily
dependent
on
sales
of
energy
for
state
revenue
russia
s
parliament
has
approved
the
new
tax
on
the
oil
industry
on
a
first
reading
currently
taxes
are
based
on
production
via
a
mineral
extraction
tax
and
exports
the
new
tax
will
initially
cover
four
groups
of
oilfields
including
new
deposits
in
regions
of
east
siberia
fields
which
enjoy
a
lower
export
duty
and
some
fields
in
west
siberia
the
new
taxes
at
least
on
an
initial
stage
will
be
applicable
to
only
limited
number
of
fields
depending
on
how
big
their
reserves
are
texler
said
the
ministry
had
proposed
increasing
quotas
for
the
groups
of
oilfields
eligible
for
the
new
tax
from
million
tonnes
of
reserves
to
million
tonnes
and
the
changes
would
be
debated
in
the
second
crucial
reading
in
addition
the
new
proposal
would
raise
the
limits
for
a
single
oilfield
to
which
the
new
taxation
could
be
applicable
to
million
tonnes
of
reserves
from
million
tonnes
to
increase
the
scope
for
the
taxation
the
proposals
would
boost
production
of
oil
by
tonnes
per
year
bpd
texler
said
he
didn
t
say
to
which
level
the
law
is
expected
to
be
implemented
starting
from
a
forecast
published
in
september
by
the
economy
ministry
saw
russian
oil
production
rising
to
million
tonnes
per
year
in
lawmakers
must
approve
the
draft
in
three
readings
before
it
is
sent
it
to
the
upper
house
of
parliament
and
then
president
vladimir
putin
for
signature
