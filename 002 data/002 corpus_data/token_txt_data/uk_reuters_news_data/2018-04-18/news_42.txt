reuters
africa
is
on
course
for
economic
growth
of
percent
this
year
the
world
bank
said
on
wednesday
marginally
slower
than
it
previously
forecast
but
faster
than
last
year
thanks
to
rising
commodity
prices
by
growth
in
the
region
should
pick
up
to
percent
it
said
african
economies
were
hit
hard
by
a
crash
in
commodity
prices
which
slowed
growth
slashed
government
revenues
and
weakened
several
of
the
currencies
on
the
continent
growth
was
percent
in
the
lowest
in
more
than
two
decades
before
rising
to
an
estimated
percent
last
year
while
nigeria
south
africa
and
angola
are
expected
to
see
a
gradual
in
growth
economic
expansion
will
continue
at
a
solid
pace
in
the
west
african
economic
and
monetary
union
waemu
and
strengthen
in
most
of
east
africa
the
bank
said
in
its
africa
s
pulse
report
for
april
these
forecasts
are
predicated
on
the
expectations
that
oil
and
metals
prices
will
remain
stable
expansion
in
global
trade
will
stay
robust
and
external
financial
market
conditions
will
continue
to
be
in
january
the
world
bank
s
global
economic
prospects
report
forecast
growth
in
africa
would
rise
to
percent
in
nigeria
south
africa
and
angola
make
up
about
percent
of
africa
s
annual
gdp
the
bank
said
nigeria
was
experiencing
a
recovery
in
oil
output
but
hurdles
in
industries
and
services
would
be
a
drag
on
activity
in
angola
the
revisions
reflect
the
expectation
that
a
more
efficient
foreign
exchange
allocation
system
increased
availability
of
foreign
exchange
due
to
higher
oil
prices
rising
natural
gas
production
and
improved
business
sentiment
would
help
support
the
rebound
in
economic
activity
the
bank
said
in
south
africa
slowing
inflation
and
improving
business
confidence
are
expected
to
help
sustain
the
ongoing
recovery
in
domestic
demand
especially
in
the
bank
said
that
while
growth
prospects
were
encouraging
there
were
still
hurdles
ahead
growth
in
the
industrial
sectors
has
yet
to
pick
up
underscoring
the
low
structural
transformation
in
the
region
employment
opportunities
are
lagging
public
debt
relative
to
gdp
is
rising
and
poverty
is
widespread
the
report
said
the
main
risk
to
growth
in
the
region
was
the
possibility
of
a
collapse
in
commodity
prices
a
possible
trigger
could
be
a
slowdown
in
chinese
growth
given
the
risks
posed
by
interest
rate
hikes
or
trade
tensions
with
the
united
states
the
world
bank
said
a
collapse
in
oil
and
metals
prices
would
severely
undermine
efforts
at
fiscal
consolidation
derailing
progress
in
reining
in
the
region

debt
