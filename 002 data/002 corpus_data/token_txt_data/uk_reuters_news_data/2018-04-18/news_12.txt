technologies
that
alter
mosquitoes
dna
could
prove
critical
in
the
fight
against
malaria
bill
gates
said
on
wednesday
and
ethical
concerns
should
not
block
progress
in
such
research
speaking
at
the
malaria
forum
conference
in
london
the
billionaire
microsoft
and
philanthropist
said
that
while
gene
editing
raises
legitimate
questions
that
should
not
jeopardize
exploration
of
tools
such
as
crispr
gene
editing
and
gene
drive
technologies
i
m
very
energized
about
the
potential
of
gene
drive
it
s
the
kind
of
breakthrough
we
need
to
support
gates
said
it
may
prove
critical
gene
drive
technologies
alter
dna
and
drive
genetic
changes
through
multiple
generations
by
overriding
normal
biological
processes
crispr
technology
enables
scientists
to
find
and
modify
or
replace
virtually
any
gene
the
techniques
are
being
explored
across
science
from
human
medicine
to
and
in
mosquitoes
that
transmit
malaria
genetic
alterations
can
be
used
to
induce
infertility
to
reduce
populations
or
alter
the
insects
ability
to
carry
and
pass
on
the
malaria
parasite
the
technologies
can
be
extremely
powerful
but
they
are
also
controversial
since
such
genetically
engineered
organisms
released
into
the
environment
could
have
an
unknown
and
irreversible
impact
on
the
ecosystem
asked
in
a
interview
with
reuters
about
that
controversy
gates
said
there
were
understandable
concerns
about
safety
and
efficacy
that
would
need
to
be
addressed
in
research
and
trials
but
he
countered
malaria
itself
is
quite
controversial
it
kills
about
kids
a
year
so
we
re
definitely
not
on
the
side
of
he
also
noted
that
at
their
summit
in
january
leaders
of
the
african
union
endorsed
gene
drive
research
as
part
of
the
fight
against
a
disease
that
continues
to
kill
their
people
they
spoke
out
to
say
that
for
them
getting
rid
of
malaria
is
worth
using
innovative
science
gates
said
the
world
health
organization
who
warned
late
last
year
that
global
progress
against
malaria
had
stalled
and
could
be
reversed
if
momentum
in
the
fight
to
wipe
it
out
was
lost
the
disease
infected
around
million
people
in
countries
in
an
increase
of
million
cases
over
the
previous
year
it
killed
people
about
the
same
number
as
in
with
the
vast
majority
of
deaths
occurring
in
babies
and
young
children
in
africa
gates
told
the
forum
that
his
almost
years
of
involvement
in
global
efforts
to
beat
malaria
had
been
both
gratifying
in
terms
of
progress
and
tough
in
terms
of
suffering
he
witnessed
he
described
seeing
a
child
in
a
hospital
in
tanzania
convulsed
with
seizures
due
to
cerebral
malaria
with
the
state
of
science
and
the
wealth
of
the
world
that
really
should
be
an
affront
he
said
we
really
shouldn
t
accept
that
this
disease
can
gates
said
that
ending
malaria
for
good
would
take
many
years
and
a
range
of
tools
both
new
and
old
from
bednets
and
mosquito
traps
to
a
new
vaccine
and
next
generation
gene
tools
he
said
he
thought
it
unlikely
that
creating
gene
drives
in
mosquitoes
would
have
a
major
impact
on
the
wider
ecosystem
because
it
would
only
target
a
few
species
and
suppress
their
populations
for
a
period
of
time
none
of
these
gene
technology
constructs
will
actually
wipe
out
the
species
he
said
it
will
evolve
back
after
all
evolutionary
pressures
always
push
dramatically
reducing
mosquito
populations
with
such
technologies
could
however
give
a
window
of
opportunity
to
help
limit
the
human
reservoir
of
disease
so
that
transmission
of
the
disease
among
people
is
stopped
he
said
gates
also
said
genetic
information
and
data
gathered
in
the
field
and
transmitted
swiftly
to
sophisticated
surveillance
systems
is
allowing
scientists
to
identify
evolving
strains
of
malaria
parasites
and
track
drug
and
pesticide
resistance
helping
them
stay
one
step
ahead
of
the
disease
