libya
s
national
oil
corporation
noc
is
considering
using
a
chemical
marking
system
to
help
trace
oil
products
smuggled
out
of
the
country
its
chairman
said
on
wednesday
mustafa
sanalla
also
called
on
a
european
union
naval
mission
to
combat
smugglers
by
seizing
their
ships
in
the
mediterranean
said
the
united
nations
should
consider
sanctioning
smugglers
and
urged
libya
to
reform
massive
subsidies
that
allow
fuel
to
be
sold
for
as
little
as
cents
per
litre
the
fuel
smugglers
and
thieves
have
permeated
not
only
the
militias
which
control
much
of
libya
but
also
the
fuel
distribution
companies
which
are
supposed
to
bring
cheap
fuel
to
libyan
citizens
sanalla
told
an
inaugural
oil
and
fuel
theft
conference
in
geneva
the
huge
sums
of
money
available
from
smuggling
have
corrupted
large
parts
of
libyan
society
he
said
according
to
a
text
of
his
speech
the
noc
was
looking
at
adding
molecular
markers
to
subsidised
fuel
to
help
libyan
and
international
law
enforcers
including
europol
cepol
and
interpol
identify
smugglers
sanalla
said
fuels
can
be
tracked
by
using
chemical
markers
that
bind
to
fuel
molecules
smuggling
networks
have
flourished
amid
the
political
turmoil
and
armed
conflict
that
developed
following
libya
s
uprising
groups
are
often
involved
in
multiple
types
of
smuggling
making
huge
profits
from
illicit
sales
of
fuel
and
the
transfer
of
migrants
towards
europe
between
and
percent
of
fuel
refined
in
libya
or
imported
into
the
country
is
stolen
or
smuggled
according
to
the
noc
libyan
vessels
smuggle
mainly
diesel
to
international
ships
offshore
while
gasoline
is
diverted
to
roadside
sellers
or
smugglers
who
operate
across
libya
s
land
borders
the
practice
costs
the
libyan
state
one
billion
libyan
dinars
per
year
or
million
at
the
official
exchange
rate
the
noc
estimates
action
taken
so
far
including
italian
prosecution
and
sanctions
against
smuggling
networks
and
a
ditch
and
berm
built
by
tunisia
on
its
border
with
libya
had
not
been
enough
to
create
a
major
disincentive
for
the
fuel
smugglers
sanalla
said
though
local
officials
say
they
are
trying
to
crack
down
on
fuel
smuggling
fuel
is
still
allocated
to
inoperational
or
ghost
petrol
stations
prices
are
among
the
lowest
in
the
world
though
rampant
smuggling
means
petrol
shortages
are
common
and
libyans
often
pay
a
higher
black
market
price
fuel
smugglers
are
and
and
every
day
their
grip
on
regions
of
libya
and
also
on
neighbouring
countries
who
receive
smuggled
and
stolen
libyan
fuel
becomes
stronger
and
more
institutionalised
sanalla
said
he
called
for
the
mandate
of
the
eu
s
naval
mission
operation
sophia
to
be
extended
to
combat
the
smuggling
of
refined
fuel
as
well
as
oil
saying
that
much
of
the
illegal
activity
could
be
traced
by
radar
or
satellite
and
was
concentrated
at
hurd
s
bank
anchorage
just
outside
maltese
territorial
waters
