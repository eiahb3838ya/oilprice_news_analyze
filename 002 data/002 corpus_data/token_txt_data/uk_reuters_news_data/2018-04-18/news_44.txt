the
governor
of
japan
s
niigata
prefecture
home
to
the
world
s
largest
nuclear
power
plant
resigned
on
wednesday
saying
he
hoped
to
avoid
political
turmoil
over
an
impending
magazine
article
about
his
relations
with
women
news
that
the
governor
ryuichi
yoneyama
intended
to
resign
sent
shares
of
tokyo
electric
power
company
holdings
inc
tepco
surging
as
investors
bet
his
departure
could
make
it
easier
for
the
utility
to
restart
its
nuclear
power
plant
which
is
in
niigata
prefecture
japan
has
had
few
reported
metoo
cases
about
sexual
harassment
involving
public
figures
but
yoneyama
s
resignation
came
on
the
same
day
japan
s
top
finance
bureaucrat
resigned
on
after
a
magazine
said
he
had
sexually
harassed
several
female
reporters
the
official
denied
the
allegation
yoneyama
like
his
predecessor
is
opposed
to
a
restart
of
the
plant
and
has
been
a
block
to
attempts
to
get
the
station
going
by
the
utility
which
also
owns
the
wrecked
fukushima
daiichi
nuclear
station
yoneyama
told
reuters
last
year
a
better
understanding
of
the
fukushima
disaster
of
was
needed
before
he
would
sign
off
on
a
restart
at
tepco
shares
closed
percent
higher
on
wednesday
after
media
reported
yoneyama
would
resign
the
broader
market
rose
about
percent
yoneyama
who
is
single
said
it
was
possible
that
some
of
the
presents
and
money
he
had
given
to
women
he
dated
could
be
misinterpreted
and
that
he
was
resigning
to
avoid
further
political
turmoil
over
the
issue
it
really
hurts
me
that
i
can
t
complete
the
task
of
tackling
the
safety
of
the
nuclear
plant
he
told
a
news
conference
is
the
world
s
largest
nuclear
power
plant
and
restarting
the
site
s
seven
reactors
is
crucial
to
tepco
s
recovery
plans
in
the
wake
of
the
meltdowns
at
its
fukushima
plant
in
tepco
has
approval
from
regulators
to
start
two
reactors
at
but
the
company
needs
to
carry
out
further
work
before
the
restarts
while
not
a
legal
requirement
the
sign
off
of
the
governor
is
also
required
