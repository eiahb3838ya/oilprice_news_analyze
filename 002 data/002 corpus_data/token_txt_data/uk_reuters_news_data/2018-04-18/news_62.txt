asian
shares
crept
ahead
on
wednesday
after
wall
street
took
heart
from
upbeat
corporate
earnings
though
nagging
concerns
about
trade
barriers
and
the
global
growth
outlook
kept
currencies
and
bonds
subdued
dealers
were
anxious
to
see
if
a
surprise
policy
move
by
the
china
s
central
bank
late
on
tuesday
might
help
soothe
shanghai
markets
after
a
couple
of
days
of
sharp
losses
the
pboc
will
reduce
the
cash
banks
hold
as
reserves
in
a
move
that
frees
up
lending
for
small
firms
but
falls
short
of
a
broad
monetary
easing
the
shanghai
index
hit
a
near
low
on
tuesday
after
the
united
states
banned
american
companies
from
selling
components
to
chinese
telecom
equipment
maker
zte
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
edged
up
percent
in
early
trade
though
that
follows
four
straight
sessions
of
losses
japan
s
nikkei
added
percent
with
investors
waiting
for
any
developments
on
trade
as
japanese
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
meets
president
donald
trump
at
his
resort
futures

the
s
p
gained
percent
after
robust
earnings
from
netflix
goldman
sachs
and
healthcare
companies
fuelled
optimism
about
what
is
expected
to
be
the
strongest
earnings
season
in
seven
years
the
dow
ended
tuesday
up
percent
while
the
s
p
rose
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
yet
there
were
signs
of
caution
in
the
latest
bofa
merrill
lynch
survey
of
fund
mangers
which
found
investors
squirreling
more
funds
away
into
cash
while
cutting
their
equity
allocation
to
an
low
the
outlook
for
the
global
economy
also
darkened
with
just
a
net
percent
expecting
stronger
growth
in
the
next
months
the
lowest
since
the
united
kingdom
voted
to
leave
the
eu
in
june
while
the
imf
on
tuesday
left
its
global
growth
forecasts
unchanged
for
and
it
judged
risks
were
to
the
downside
citing
financial
vulnerabilities
geopolitical
strains
and
tariffs
the
global
narrative
has
quickly
shifted
from
synchronous
global
growth
upgraded
growth
and
glimmers
of
inflation
in
early
to
a
focus
on
tariffs
and
protectionist
rhetoric
said
robert
rennie
head
of
financial
markets
strategy
at
westpac
we
ultimately
believe
that
we
will
see
a
negotiated
solution
but
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go
and
further
bouts
of
volatility
and
headline
risk
seem
worries
about
the
longevity
of
the
economic
expansion
were
one
reason
the
treasury
curve
was
at
its
flattest
in
a
decade
and
why
some
curves
were
starting
to
price
in
rate
cuts
for
the
air
of
uncertainty
was
keeping
currencies
within
ranges
the
dollar
hovered
at
yen
having
spent
all
of
tuesday
in
a
band
the
euro
was
stuck
at
after
topping
out
at
overnight
while
the
dollar
index
was
a
fraction
lower
at
in
commodity
markets
gold
was
little
changed
at
an
ounce
oil
prices
firmed
with
brent
crude
futures
up
cents
to
a
