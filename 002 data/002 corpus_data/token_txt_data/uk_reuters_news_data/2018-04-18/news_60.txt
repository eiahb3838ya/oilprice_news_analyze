lucky for some: chinese city launches wind power lottery to ease grid strains
shanghai
reuters
the
city
of
yanan
a
major
wind
power
base
in
northwest
china
s
shaanxi
province
has
introduced
a
lottery
system
to
decide
which
wind
projects
will
go
ahead
this
year
a
sign
that
grid
constraints
are
forcing
local
governments
to
restrict
capacity
china
has
been
aggressively
developing
alternative
power
as
part
of
its
efforts
to
cut
pollution
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
wind
power
reached
gigawatts
gw
last
year
up
percent
on
the
year
and
amounting
to
percent
of
total
generating
capacity
but
capacity
expansion
has
outpaced
grid
construction
and
large
numbers
of
wind
solar
and
hydropower
plants
are
unable
to
deliver
all
their
power
to
consumers
as
a
result
of
transmission
deficiencies
a
problem
known
as
curtailment
according
to
a
yanan
planning
agency
notice
seen
by
reuters
the
city
was
given
permission
to
build
megawatts
of
wind
capacity
this
year
but
megawatts
or
gw
have
already
been
declared
eligible
for
construction
forcing
authorities
to
whittle
down
the
total
number
of
projects
after
study
it
was
decided
that
the
lottery
method
should
be
used
to
determine
what
plans
will
be
submitted
for
approval
to
the
provincial
development
and
reform
commission
it
said
the
authenticity
of
the
document
was
confirmed
by
a
local
municipal
government
official
he
declined
to
give
his
name
or
provide
details
china
aims
to
raise
the
share
of
fuels
in
its
total
energy
mix
to
around
percent
by
the
end
of
the
decade
up
from
percent
in
but
while
renewable
power
has
grown
rapidly
around
gw
of
wind
capacity
was
still
unable
to
transmit
electricity
to
consumers
in
wasted
wind
power
amounted
to
around
percent
of
total
generation
in
according
to
the
energy
regulator
an
environmental
group
is
currently
suing
grid
companies
in
the
northwest
for
failing
to
fulfill
their
legal
obligation
to
maximize
purchases
of
local
renewable
power
to
try
to
prevent
waste
china
has
drawn
up
guidelines
aimed
at
preventing
new
plant
construction
in
regions
already
suffering
from
surplus
capacity
it
also
released
draft
guidelines
last
month
for
a
new
renewable
energy
certificate
system
that
will
force
regions
to
meet
mandatory
clean
electricity
utilization
targets
the
scheme
is
expected
to
help
alleviate
curtailment
