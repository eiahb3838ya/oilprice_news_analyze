australia to amend $3.9 bln infrastructure fund in bid to develop country's north
sydney
reuters
australia
will
amend
the
guidelines
for
a
a
billion
billion
fund
that
offers
loans
to
build
infrastructure
in
the
country
s
north
so
it
can
offer
greater
support
to
a
broader
range
of
projects
a
government
minister
said
on
wednesday
the
changes
will
aid
a
bid
to
develop
australia
s
sparsely
populated
yet
northern
region
opening
the
fund
to
more
projects
after
some
such
as
a
proposed
coal
mine
by
indian
conglomerate
adani
enterprises
ran
into
political
hurdles
the
northern
australia
infrastructure
facility
naif
was
introduced
in
but
its
rules
had
proved
too
restrictive
said
minister
for
northern
australia
matt
canavan
there
s
a
strong
pipeline
of
projects
but
it
has
been
challenging
to
get
them
to
financial
close
so
that
s
why
some
of
these
rules
are
being
changed
canavan
told
australian
broadcasting
corporation
radio
the
government
will
remove
a
requirement
that
means
naif
can
fund
only
percent
of
a
project
while
the
types
of
infrastructure
that
can
be
backed
will
also
be
broadened
the
changes
now
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
we
are
able
to
consider
smaller
projects
where
they
meet
our
mandatory
criteria
naif
chief
executive
laurie
walker
said
in
a
statement
canavan
said
naif
had
projects
in
the
pipeline
relating
to
energy
generation
and
gas
pipelines
transport
tourism
agriculture
manufacturing
water
infrastructure
and
communications
i
am
confident
that
many
of
the
projects
currently
under
consideration
by
the
board
of
naif
will
quickly
be
given
the
tick
of
approval
once
these
changes
are
made
he
told
abc
radio
the
changes
will
not
however
revive
adani
s
giant
coal
mine
which
has
faced
strong
opposition
on
environmental
grounds
australia
s
treasurer
scott
morrison
said
it
s
off
the
table
they
made
that
decision
this
change
in
no
way
resuscitates
that
morrison
told
reporters
in
sydney
adani
had
hoped
for
government
funding
to
help
build
a
km
mile
rail
line
connecting
its
proposed
mine
with
a
pacific
ocean
port
australian
state
leaders
will
also
keep
their
ability
to
veto
any
naif
loan
which
scuttled
adani
s
plans
morrison
said
the
amendments
come
just
over
months
out
from
australia
s
next
federal
election
where
the
ruling
coalition
government
will
seek
to
win
favor
with
voters
on
its
economic
record
australia
s
north
which
has
been
home
to
a
rise
of
parties
such
as
pauline
hanson
s
one
nation
is
shaping
up
as
a
key
battleground
and
contains
many
of
the
ruling
coalition
government
s
least
secure
seats
