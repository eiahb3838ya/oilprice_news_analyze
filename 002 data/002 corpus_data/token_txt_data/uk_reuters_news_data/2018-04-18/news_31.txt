the
imf
indicated
on
wednesday
that
it
was
receptive
to
a
request
from
angola
for
assistance
to
help
it
implement
economic
reforms
africa
s
crude
producer
continues
to
suffer
from
lower
oil
prices
which
have
caused
a
dollar
liquidity
squeeze
that
has
made
it
difficult
for
foreign
companies
to
repatriate
profits
and
discouraged
many
from
investing
the
finance
ministry
said
on
tuesday
it
wanted
a
deal
with
the
imf
known
as
a
policy
coordination
instrument
that
will
help
to
improve
the
external
credibility
of
our
country
with
positive
impact
on
the
ability
to
attract
foreign
direct
investment
in
a
statement
the
ministry
said
it
was
seeking
help
in
implementing
its
macroeconomic
stabilisation
plan
effectively
the
economic
policy
of
the
new
government
the
imf
confirmed
receipt
of
the
request
saying
it
stands
ready
to
help
angola
address
its
economic
challenges
by
supporting
a
comprehensive
policy
package
the
statement
explained
that
while
the
policy
coordination
instrument
does
not
involve
any
imf
financing
the
policies
supported
under
it
must
meet
the
same
standard
as

who
took
over
last

has
said

to
bring
about
an

opening

a
severe
shortage
of
dollars
has
deterred
foreign
investment
on
the
streets
of
the
capital
luanda
a
dollar
goes
for
nearly
twice
the
official
rate
however
a
devaluation
of
some
percent
to
the
dollar
this
year
has
gone
some
way
to
closing
the
gap
with
the
street
rate
angola
has
been
trying
to
persuade
international
banks
to
rekindle
dollar
correspondent
relationships
with
the
country
which
were
cut
over
the
past
few
years
due
to
perceived
compliance
risks
in
doing
business
there
the
government
of
president
lourenço
has
taken
important
steps
toward
improving
governance
and
restoring
macroeconomic
stability
