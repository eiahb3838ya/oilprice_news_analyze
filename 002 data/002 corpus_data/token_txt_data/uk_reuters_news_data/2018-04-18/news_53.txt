the

has
gained
key
support

aiming
to
agree
on
a

woodside
petroleum
s
chief
executive
said
on
wednesday
browse
is
seen
as
a
key
source
of
growth
for
woodside
but
has
been
stuck
on
the
drawing
board
for
years
as
plans
for
onshore
and
floating
lng
development
estimated
at
billion
to
billion
were
scrapped
the
plan
now
is
to
develop
the
giant
gas
field
to
feed
the
north
west
shelf
plant
australia
s
biggest
lng
plant
when
its
current
gas
source
runs
dry
in
the
we
ve
picked
up
momentum
over
the
last
couple
of
months
around
browse
and
some
of
it
is
now
a
realisation
in
particular
on
behalf
of
the
north
west
shelf
partners
that
browse
needs
to
be
the
anchor
tenant
for
the
north
west
shelf
over
the
next
years
woodside
ceo
peter
coleman
told
reuters
the
nw
shelf
joint
venture
partners
are
very
much
aligned
now
on
completing
tariff
talks
by
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
he
said
woodside
s
north
west
shelf
partners
are
bp
bhp
billiton
chevron
corp
royal
dutch
shell
and
japan
s
mitusbishi
corp
and
mitsui
co
once
the
tariff
is
set
woodside
and
its
browse
partners
most
of
which
overlap
with
stakeholders
in
the
north
west
shelf
will
be
in
a
stronger
position
to
move
ahead
with
planning
how
to
develop
the
field
a
final
investment
decision
could
come
earlier
than
the
current
target
of
the
opportunity
for
us
is
to
bring
that
forward
to
be
able
to
meet
market
general
consensus
now
says
the
market
s
going
to
be
short
by
coleman
said
just
two
years
ago
the
market
had
been
expected
to
remain
in
oversupply
until
around
but
that
has
changed
following
a
sharp
jump
in
gas
demand
in
china
woodside
is
also
pushing
ahead
with
an
oil
project
off
senegal
where
its
partners
are
cairn
energy
and
far
ltd
while
a
dispute
with
far
over
woodside
s
acquisition
of
a
percent
stake
in
the
project
enters
arbitration
cairn
and
far
have
said
the
first
phase
of
the
sne
development
is
expected
to
cost
around
billion
however
woodside
is
looking
to
cut
that
cost
by
quite
a
lot
coleman
said
it
has
invited
offers
for
a
floating
production
storage
and
offloading
vessel
fpso
and
other
equipment
for
the
project
coleman
spoke
to
reuters
after
woodside
reported
a
percent
rise
in
revenue
to
billion
from
a
year
earlier
on
increased
output
and
higher
lng
prices
output
rose
to
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent

from
mmboe
in
the

quarter
last
year
