for
signs
of
strain

britain

out

survey
of

showed
signs
of
caution
investors
cut
their

allocation
to
an
low

just
like
they
were
chasing

up
in

have
gradually
started

said
clark
fenton
chief
investment
officer
at
agilis
investment
management
i
think
that
gives
the
market
scope
to
rally
a
bit
more
as

has
lightened

gap
widens

muted
fund
managers
named
the
threat
of
trade
war
as
the
biggest
tail
risk
in
baml
s
survey
while
they
were
less
concerned
about

markets
monetary
tightening
proceeding
at
a
different
pace
on
either

making
its
mark
on
bond
markets
the
gap
between

german
bonds
reached
its
widest
in
nearly
years
reflecting
the
diverging
monetary
policy
outlook
in
some
ways
i
am
sort
of
surprised
that
it
hasn
t
mattered
more
said
agilis
fenton
referring
to
the
divergence
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
helped
european
equity
prices
more
on
a
relative
the
yield
curve
the
gap
between
and
government
bond
yields
flattened
back
slightly
having
fallen
to
a
low
of
basis
points
overnight
i
would
worry
if
the
curve
got
inverted
it
s
probably
a
bit
premature
to
get
too
bent
out
of
shape
about
it
now
said
fenton
the
rise
in

has
pushed
