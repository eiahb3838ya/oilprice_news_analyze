update 2-china sept exports surge, creating record surplus with u.s. despite tariffs
beijing

china
s
vast
export
engine
unexpectedly
kicked
into
higher
gear
in
september
producing
a
record
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
that
could
exacerbate
the
dispute
between
beijing
and
washington
analysts
said
last
month
s
strong
export
growth
which
might
indicate
tariffs
are
not
biting
much
yet
is
unlikely
to
be
sustained
but
the
robust
numbers
reported
on
friday
by
china
s
customs
agency
the
last
ones
from
china
before
congressional
elections
on
could
prompt
a
reaction
from
president
donald
trump
september
exports
rose
percent
from
a
year
earlier
the
fastest
pace
since
february
the
customs
data
showed
that
was
well
above
august
s
percent
and
a
reuters
poll
forecast
of
percent
the
big
picture
is
the
chinese
exports
have
so
far
held
up
well
in
the
face
of
escalating
trade
tensions
and
cooling
global
growth
most
likely
thanks
to
the
competitiveness
boost
provided
by
a
weaker
renminbi

global

tariffs
set
to
become
more
punishing
the
recent
resilience
of
exports
is
unlikely
to
be
a
weaker
yuan
which
has
depreciated
about
percent
against
the
dollar
this
year
may
have
taken
the
sting
out
of
the

imposed
on

to
the

in

surpassing
the
record
of

in

beijing
s
export
data
has
been
surprisingly
resilient
to
tariffs
possibly
because
companies
ramped
up
shipments
before
broader
and
stiffer
duties
went
into
effect
raising
concerns
about
a
sharper
drop
in
export
strength

cited
a
jump
in
exports

item
from

as
a
sign
exporters
might
have

out
