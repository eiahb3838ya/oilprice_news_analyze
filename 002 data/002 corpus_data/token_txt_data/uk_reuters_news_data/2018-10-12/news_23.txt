asian
spot
lng
prices
fell
this
week
as
sellers
struggled
to
offload
the
last
of
their
november
cargos
and
chinese
demand
for
december
supplies
failed
to
materialise
significantly
after
a
frenzy
of
asian
buying
last
month
november
spot

were
sparse

was
wide

were
cited
as
low

although
a
trade
was
heard
at
around
crude
which
was
heading
for
a
first
weekly
fall
in
over
a
month
as
part
of
a
global
market
rout

month
in
anticipation
of
winter
demand
after
a
hot
summer
depleted
stockpiles
china
was
seen
as
providing
support
to
prices
after
the
country
got
caught
short
last
winter
with
its
storage
capacity
still
low
however
that
has
not
been
the
case
so
far
this
month
china
has
been
pacing
down
supplies
so
as
not
to
spike
prices
again

one
lng

storage
is
a
fact
but
i
guess
they
are
replacing

little
wiser
than
last
another

said
a
november

was
bought
by
osaka
gas
for

mmbtu
although
the
japanese
utility
had
a
wide
delivery
window
and
quality
specification
to
make
the
sale
attractive
to
suppliers
there
s
some
distressed
sellers
out
there
the
bid
offer
spread
is
wide
