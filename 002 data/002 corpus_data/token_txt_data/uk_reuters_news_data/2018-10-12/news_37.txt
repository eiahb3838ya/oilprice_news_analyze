oil
markets
look
adequately
supplied
for
now
after
a
big
increase
in
production
over
the
last
six
months
but
the
oil
industry
is
coming
under
strain
as
it
copes
with
increasing
global
demand
the
west
s
energy
watchdog
said
on
friday
the
international
energy
agency
said
in
its
monthly
report
that
the
world
s
spare
oil
production
capacity
was
already
down
to
only
percent
of
global
demand
with
further
reductions
likely
to
come
this
strain
could
be
with
us
for
some
time
and
it
will
likely
be
accompanied
by
higher
prices
however
much
we
regret
them
and
their
potential
negative
impact
on
the
global
economy
the
iea
said
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
exporters
such
as
russia
and
shale
producers
had
increased
oil
production
sharply
since
may
the
iea
said
raising
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
overall
opec
had
boosted
production
by
bpd
since
may
as
middle
east
gulf
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
more
than
compensated
for
declining
output
in
venezuela
and
iran
which
is
facing
sanctions
from
next
month
and
the
outlook
for
world
oil
consumption
was
faltering
the
iea
cut
its
forecast
of
global
oil
demand
growth
by
million
bpd
for
both
this
year
and
next
to
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
this
is
due
to
a
weaker
economic
outlook
trade
concerns
higher
oil
prices
and
a
revision
to
chinese
data
said
the
iea
which
advises
major
oil
consumers
on
energy
policy
oecd
commercial
stocks
rose
by
million
barrels
in
august
to
billion
barrels
their
highest
level
since
february
on
strong
refinery
output
and
liquefied
petroleum
gas
restocking
the
iea
said
it
added
that
oecd
inventories
were
likely
to
have
risen
by
million
barrels
in
the
third
quarter
the
largest
quarterly
increase
in
stocks
since
the
first
quarter
of
the
increase
in
net
production
from
key
suppliers
since
may
of
approximately
million
bpd
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
the
fact
that
oil
stocks
built
by
million
bpd
in
and
look
likely
to
have
done
the
same
in
lends
weight
to
the
argument
that
the
oil
market
is
adequately
supplied
for
now
