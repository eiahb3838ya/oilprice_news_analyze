poland to protect households from power price surge - parkiet
warsaw
oct
reuters
the
polish
government
is
looking
to
reduce
the
impact
of
surging
electricity
prices
on
households
either
by
helping
suppliers
or
giving
tax
relief
for
consumers
the
parkiet
newspaper
said
quoting
draft
regulations
prepared
for
the
energy
ministry
such
a
move
would
be
the
latest
costly
proposal
from
the
ruling
law
and
justice
pis
party
ahead
of
municipal
elections
this
month
the
party
which
took
power
in
has
also
promised
to
boost
spending
on
roads
and
air
quality
the
energy
ministry
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
electricity
prices
on
the
polish
power
exchange
have
leapt
percent
in
the
year
to
september
on
the
back
of
higher
coal
prices
and
the
rising
cost
of
carbon
emissions
permits
poland
has
liberalized
power
prices
for
companies
but
still
regulates
them
for
households
while
the
head
of
the
energy
market
regulator
said
earlier
this
year
the
higher
price
would
have
to
be
reflected
in
households
bills
the
energy
minister
has
said
prices
will
remain
unchanged
parkiet
said
the
energy
ministry
had
worked
out
two
proposals
to
help
households
both
to
be
financed
with
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
eu
carbon
permits
one
would
include
support
for
mostly
electricity
suppliers
although
this
could
run
foul
of
eu
rules
parkiet
said
the
other
proposal
is
potential
tax
relief
for
households
we
are
aware
of
the
weight
of
the
problems
resulting
from
electricity
price
increase
we
are
planning
to
launch
a
package
of
shielding
solutions
for
citizens
and
industrial
consumers
these
could
be
reliefs
from
various
payments
or
even
compensations
for
the
emission
price
parkiet
quoted
the
energy
minister
as
saying
the
current
electricity
tariff
expires
at
the
end
of
this
year
analysts
say
poland
s
utilities
are
unlikely
to
ask
for
regulatory
approval
to
raise
power
prices
for
households
ahead
of
regional
elections
next
month
and
a
general
election
next
year
although
this
may
hit
their
profits
