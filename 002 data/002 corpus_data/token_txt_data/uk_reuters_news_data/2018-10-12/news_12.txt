analysis-trump's ethanol plan: hype now, legal fights later
york
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
hyping
of
a
plan
to
boost
ethanol
demand
drew
cheers
at
an
iowa
rally
on
tuesday
but
the
oil
refining
industry
has
promised
a
lawsuit
to
block
the
move
so
victory
for
midwest
farmers
is
far
from
certain
trump
on
tuesday
indicated
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
should
allow
for
a
waiver
for
gasoline
known
as
to
be
sold
all
year
which
has
been
prohibited
due
to
smog
concerns
he
did
not
mention
the
threatened
lawsuit
and
was
not
asked
about
it
the
hitch
according
to
industry
experts
as
well
as
legal
precedent
is
that
trump
needs
an
act
of
congress
to
change
the
rule
new
supreme
court
justice
brett
kavanaugh
wrote
in
that
epa
can
not
change
the
rule
unless
congress
changes
the
law
and
the
refining
industry
has
promised
to
sue
if
the
agency
tries
still
some
ethanol
industry
experts
said
trump
s
political
support
in
farm
states
will
give
him
enough
cover
to
push
either
congress
or
regulators
to
act
some
said
the
media
coverage
of
the
proposal
alone
should
help
republican
members
of
congress
in
tight
farm
state
races
you
can
t
tell
me
this
didn
t
have
a
political
impact
said
monte
shaw
head
of
the
iowa
renewable
fuels
association
he
said
he
was
in
cedar
rapids
iowa
having
breakfast
on
friday
when
a
waiter
congratulated
him
on
trump
s
announcement
he
said
however
that
trump
must
publish
the
rule
ahead
of
the
november
election
or
else
democrats
will
try
to
paint
the
announcement
as
all
show
no
substance
gasoline
sold
in
the
summer
contains
percent
ethanol
for
years
the
biofuel
industry
has
sought
to
lift
the
summer
ban
on
with
percent
ethanol
to
boost
domestic
demand
for
ethanol
since
trump
took
office
there
has
been
a
tug
of
war
over
ethanol
policy
within
his
administration
trump
s
former
adviser
billionaire
oilman
carl
icahn
led
an
effort
to
change
rules
requiring
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
into
gasoline
or
pay
for
credits
for
those
who
can
the
biofuels
industry
and
democrats
blasted
his
efforts
saying
his
ownership
in
refining
company
cvr
energy
created
a
conflict
of
interest
icahn
ultimately
stepped
aside
as
a
presidential
adviser
trump
has
tried
to
thread
the
needle
between
the
rival
corn
and
oil
industries
seeking
ways
to
boost
overall
ethanol
demand
while
giving
refiners
relief
from
the
cost
the
administration
could
not
secure
assurances
from
the
refining
industry
not
to
sue
over
lifting
the
ban
on
but
with
midterm
elections
looming
trump
moved
ahead
anyway
siding
with
farm
belt
supporters
who
helped
secure
his
narrow
election
victory
several
industry
experts
said
the
clean
air
act
forbids
such
a
change
without
congressional
action
epa
can
t
change
a
rule
that
s
created
by
the
congress
said
jonathan
lewis
senior
counsel
for
clean
air
task
force
a
nonprofit
working
to
reduce
pollution
they
need
the
congress
to
amend
the
clean
air
kavanaugh
wrote
in
a
case
that
was
dismissed
on
procedural
grounds
the
waiver
might
be
good
policy
if
so
congress
has
the
power
to
enact
a
new
law
permitting
but
under
the
statute
as
currently
written
epa
lacks
authority
for
the
the
refining
industry
has
seized
on
this
we
are
going
to
sue
and
other
organizations
are
going
to
sue
and
i
think
the
case
is
pretty
that
it
s
against
the
law
chet
thompson
head
of
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
said
despite
these
headwinds
trump
hyped
his
plan
at
a
rally
on
tuesday
in
council
bluffs
iowa
part
of
a
congressional
district
where
incumbent
republican
representative
david
young
faces
a
tough
race
i
believe
the
administration
understands
how
important
of
an
issue
this
is
to
many
farmers
across
the
country
said
andrew
walmsley
a
director
at
the
american
farm
bureau
an
interest
group
if
the
congress
can
t
do
it
perhaps
epa
should
try
that
