colombia
s
constitutional
court
on
thursday
ruled
that
local
referendums
that
ban
mining
and
oil
extraction
can
not
halt
energy

after
a
raft
of
votes
spooked
multinational
companies
a
wave
of
environmentally
focused
referendums
over
the
past
months
have
worried
investors
and
forced
some
to
alter
investment
plans
like

ashanti
which
suspended
a
potential

last
year
the

mining
association
acm
said
in
a
statement
after
the
court
decision
it
was
now
optimistic
projects
would
get
back
on
track
this
decision
not
only
gives
life
to
several
mining
projects
that
would
have
been
truncated
by
the
votes
but
begins
to
give
positive
signals
in
terms
of
legal
security
it

restricted
by
local
authorities
the
court
ruling
said
the
national
government
however
can
not
exercise
sole
control
over
extractive
projects
and
congress
must
pass
regulations
as
soon
as
possible
that
allow
communities
to
voice
opposition
to
mining
and
oil
projects
the
court
