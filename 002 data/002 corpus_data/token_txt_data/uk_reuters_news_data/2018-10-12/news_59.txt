the
future
that
cities
in
south
asia
and
africa
choose
cleaner
and
safer
or
dirtier
and
more
dangerous
will
be
pivotal
to
efforts
to
limit
global
warming
to
degrees
celsius
scientists
said
in
a
key
report
this
week
iconic
metropolises
such
as
new
york
and
london
often
grab
headlines
with
their
plans
to
cut
air
pollution
adopt
electric
transport
design
green
buildings
or
protect
residents
from
floods
but
greater
efforts
are
needed
to
make
similar
changes
in
cities
particularly
as
many
smaller
ones
lack
the
knowledge
and
financial
resources
to
do
it
experts
said
we
know
that
much
of
urban
growth
is
going
to
be
in
these
and
cities
in
the
global
south
said
william
solecki
an
author
of
the
climate
science
report
and
professor
at
hunter
university
of
new
york
however
these
are
cities
that
historically
have
had
limited
capacity
in
governance
and
finance
he
said
around
the
world
cities
consume
more
than
of
the
world
s
energy
and
account
for
about
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
according
to
the
united
nations
whether
they
can
cut
those
emissions
swiftly
and
protect
inhabitants
against
worsening
climate
impacts
from
flooding
to
heatwaves
will
play
a
huge
role
in
determining
whether
the
goals
of
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
are
met
but
many
cities
in
poorer
nations
face
significant
challenges
including
large
and
growing
slum
populations
that
lack
basic
services
and
are
increasingly
at
risk
from
climate
disasters
experts
said
the
report
highlights
that
climate
change
will
impact
the
most
vulnerable
that
the
capacity
to
respond
will
be
most
limited
in
those
locations
and
among
those
peoples
solecki
said
the
report
from
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
outlined
ways
to
hold
warming
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
above
times
and
sounded
the
alarm
about
the
consequences
if
action
to
achieve
that
goal
is
not
stepped
up
the
world
s
slum
population
for
instance
is
expected
to
triple
to
billion
by
placing
a
significant
proportion
of
people
beyond
the
direct
reach
of
formal
policies
to
cut
emissions
and
adapt
to
wild
weather
and
rising
seas
it
noted
how
to
tackle
the
conditions
that
lead
to
informal
urban
settlements
and
fuel
the
risks
to
their
inhabitants
is
a
central
question
the
report
said
among
the
problems
that
need
to
be
addressed
it
said
are
poverty
weak
governance
and
low
levels
of
investment
by
local
authorities
on
the
brighter
side
the
lack
of
government
services
in
poorer
parts
of
cities
also
can
spur
green
informal
economies
based
around
things
like
recycling
such
economies
are
often
and
use
resources
efficiently
the
report
noted
bringing
transitions
to
slums
will
require
governments
teaming
up
with
communities
it
said
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
these
partnerships
will
evolve
or
cohere
into
the
type
of
service
delivery
and
climate
governance
system
that
could
steer
the
change
on
a
scale
required
to
limit
to
warming
to
the
report
warned
still
it
acknowledged
work
by
some
organisations
such
as
dwellers
international
sdi
to
try
to
make
that
happen
that
network
is
collaborating
among
other
initiatives
on
a
project
in
the
south
african
city
of
durban
to
build
evidence
in
part
by
having
slum
communities
collect
data
on
the
best
ways
to
upgrade
more
than
informal
settlements
mark
watts
executive
director
of
cities
which
promotes
climate
action
in
metropolises
said
his
group
was
funding
advisors
for
member
african
cities
to
help
them
put
together
plans
in
line
with
the
warming
goal
while
those
cities
may
lack
expertise
they
do
not
have
big
negative
bureaucracies
to
push
against
which
may
make
winning
the
case
for
development
easier
he
said
they
also
can
leapfrog
the
mistakes
made
by
the
west
he
added
an
african
city
that
lacks
a
waste
management
system
for
instance
can
build
modern
treatment
plants
that
run
on
clean
energy
rather
than
trying
to
fix
or
improve
older
facilities
watts
urged
cities
to
stop
investing
in
infrastructure
including
roads
that
is
likely
to
hike
carbon
emissions
in
future
instead
they
should
put
scarce
resources
into
clean
transport
buildings
and
training
people
to
deliver
green
infrastructure
he
said
seven
cities
that
are
members
of
new
york
barcelona
copenhagen
london
oslo
paris
and
stockholm
have
already
published
climate
change
strategies
designed
to
deliver
on
the
goal
and
a
further
have
committed
to
do
so
but
most
cities
are
still
developing
in
an
unsustainable
way
that
is
adding
to
carbon
emissions
watts
said
the
report
made
clear
what
cities
must
do
to
become
green
and
resilient
and
the
urgency
of
following
that
path
he
noted
the
cities
that
do
change
wo
be
viable
in
a
few
decades
time
