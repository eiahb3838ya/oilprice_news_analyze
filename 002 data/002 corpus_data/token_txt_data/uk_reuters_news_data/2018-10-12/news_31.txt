update 1-uk's cuadrilla to begin shale gas fracking after last hurdle dismissed
london
reuters
british
energy
company
cuadrilla
said
on
friday
it
would
begin
fracking
a
shale
gas
well
at
its
lancashire
site
on
after
a
court
removed
the
final
hurdle
to
the
first
hydraulic
fracturing
in
britain
in
seven
years
the
privately
owned
company
will
spend
three
months
fracking
two
horizontal
wells
which
involves
injecting
sand
water
and
chemicals
to
split
the
tightly
packed
shale
rock
and
induce
gas
to
flow
out
this
will
be
the
first
fracking
of
a
horizontal
shale
gas
well
since
a
attempt
by
cuadrilla
caused
earth
tremors
prompting
protests
tighter
regulations
and
delays
the
process
will
be
followed
by
the
first
flow
rate
tests
from
fractured
horizontal
shale
gas
wells
in
britain
to
ascertain
not
only
whether
the
well
could
commercially
produce
gas
but
test
how
similar
the
prospect
is
to
the
shale
plays
that
have
transformed
the
gas
industry
we
are
delighted
to
be
starting
our
hydraulic
fracturing
operations
as
planned
cuadrilla
s
chief
executive
francis
egan
said
in
a
statement
flow
rate
tests
will
be
run
after
cuadrilla
fracks
the
two
wells
and
results
are
expected
in
the
new
year
the
company
said
last
week
it
would
put
sensors
in
one
well
as
the
other
is
fracked
to
monitor
any
seismic
activity
during
the
process
egan
said
last
week
that
a
result
matching
an
estimate
that
a
single
km
mile
well
could
produce
about
million
cubic
feet
a
day
would
be
a
good
one
a
local
resident
wanted
the
fracking
suspended
to
allow
for
a
judicial
review
of
the
local
council
s
safety
procedures
but
a
high
court
judge
dismissed
the
case
