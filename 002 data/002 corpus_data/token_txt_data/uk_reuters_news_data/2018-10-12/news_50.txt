reuters
ecuador
has
begun
talks
with
neighboring
peru
to
jointly
explore
two
oilfields
at
the
border
and
allow
petroamazonas
to
operate
natural
gas
areas
in
peru
ecuadorian
energy
minister
carlos
perez
said
on
thursday
ecuador
which
earlier
this
year
awarded
foreign
and
domestic
energy
firms
exploration
and
production
rights
for
four
oil
blocks
in
the
andean
country
plans
to
continue
offering
areas
through
an
onshore
auction
later
this
year
and
another
in
for
natural
gas
blocks
off
its
pacific
shore
we
could
form
a
joint
venture
between
oil
firms
petroamazonas
and
petroperu
plus
a
private
company
to
bring
in
capital
perez
told
reuters
in
an
interview
the
crude
to
be
jointly
produced
along
the
border
would
feed
peru
s
talara
refinery
through
an
existing
pipeline
while
natural
gas
to
be
produced
in
peruvian
territory
would
be
exported
to
ecuador
to
ease
a
shortage
there
ecuador
president
lenin
moreno
s
government
is
moving
fast
to
attract
foreign
investment
in
the
country
s
energy
industry
to
reverse
a
slow
decline
in
crude
output
other
countries
in
the
region
including
brazil
mexico
colombia
and
argentina
also
are
competing
for
oil
capital
oil
contracts
in
ecuador
have
been
changed
to
allow
operators
to
export
independently
and
over
a
dozen
crude
and
gas
blocks
are
planned
to
be
offered
to
foreign
companies
through
production
agreements
and
service
contracts
after
completing
the
intracampos
onshore
oil
tender
in
the
last
quarter
of
ecuador
will
next
year
auction
exploration
and
production
rights
for
gas
blocks
off
the
esmeraldas
manabi
and
guayas
shores
which
have
been
studied
but
reserves
have
not
been
confirmed
the
country
s
largest
gas
field
amistad
is
also
being
offered
for
private
investment
we
want
to
bring
large
companies
to
the
gas
auction
because
bigger
investment
is
required
there
perez
said
ecuador
which
plans
to
boost
oil
output
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
from
bpd
this
year
supports
a
crude
production
increase
at
the
december
opec
meeting
he
said
due
to
national
interest
ecuador
wants
to
have
the
option
of
being
able
to
increase
production
that
will
be
our
point
of
view
in
the
upcoming
opec
meeting
perez
said
the
current
crude
price
of
between
and
per
barrel
is
reasonable
perez
said
adding
that
we
must
find
a
balance
in
the
market
