asian

staged

on

to

managing
a
modest

from
a

that
saw
its

crumble

the

msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
the
biggest
in
more
than
two
years
but
the
bounce
came
after
the
index
fell
percent
on
thursday
to
hit
a
low
on
the
week
it
is
still
on
track
for
a
weekly
loss
of

the
biggest
market
shakeout
since
february
has
been
blamed
on
a
series
of
factors
including
worries
about
the
impact
of
a
trade
war
a
spike
in
bond
yields
this
week
and
caution

in

helped
by
media
report
that
the
treasury
department
will
not
call
china
a
currency
manipulator
in
its
upcoming
semiannual

earlier
wall
street
offered
asia
a
weak
lead
overnight
with
the
s
p
falling
just
over
percent
to
a
low
following
a
percent
drop
on
wednesday
the
share
market
is
now
about
percent
off
of
its
high
but
this
is
far
from
a
rare
occurrence
historically
economists
at
rbc
capital
markets
wrote
in
a
research
note
indeed
history
is
littered
with
over
type
selloffs
in
the
midst
of
economic
expansions
they
said
the
sharp
we
are
seeing
in
the
market
has
left
a
lot
of
folks
wondering
if
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
investors
shouldn
t
panic
said
christopher
smart
head
of
macroeconomic
and
geopolitical
research
at
barings
so
far
it
has
the
feel
of
a
temporary
correction
that
will
take
some
of
the
excess
air
out
of
tech
stocks
but
the
volatile
markets
mean
that
economic
data
and
corporate
earnings
will
get
even
closer
scrutiny
in
the
weeks
ahead
chinese
trade
figures
on
friday
showed
however
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
hit
a
record
high
in
september
providing
a
likely
source
of
contention
with
president
donald
trump
over
trade
policies
and
the
currency
the
data
showed
solid
expansion
in
china
s
overall
imports
and
exports
suggesting
little
damage
from
the
tariffs
with
the
united
states
cboe
volatility
index
rose
on
thursday
to

concern

its

but
a
further
rise
in

could
hurt

asian

appeared
to

ultimately
where

be
key
said
teppei

senior

at

adding
confusion
for
investors
trump
launched
a
second
day
of
criticism
of
the
federal
reserve
on
thursday
calling
its
interest
rate
increases
a
ridiculous
policy
while
that
does
not
appear
to
have
shaken
investor
confidence
in
the
fed
s
independence
some
investors
suspect
expectations
on
future
rate
hikes
could
be
undermined
if
trump
raises
his
threats
levels
i
doubt
trump
will
tolerate
further
rise
in

ahead
of

i
believe
the
rise
in
yields
and
the
dollar
s
rally
are
coming
to
a
turning
point

naoki
iwami
fixed

in

the

lacked

against
a
