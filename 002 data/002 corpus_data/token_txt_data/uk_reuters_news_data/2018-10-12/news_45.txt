asian
shares
found
a
slightly
firmer
footing
on
friday
to
set
course
for
their
first
gains
in
two
weeks
but
the
rout
continued
in
shanghai
where
shares
hit
lows
last
seen
in
investor
sentiment
was
frail
though
as
wall
street
s
fear
gauge
rose
to
an
high
pointing
to
more
downside
risk
market
sources
said
the
biggest
market
shakeout
since
february
has
been
blamed
on
a
series
of
factors
including
worries
about
the
impact
of
a
trade
war
a
spike
in
bond
yields
this
week
and
caution
ahead
of
earnings
seasons
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
led
by
gains
in
south
korea
and
taiwan
the
msci
index
fell
percent
on
thursday
to
hit
a
year
low
it
is
on
track
for
a
weekly
loss
of
more
than
percent
japan
s
nikkei
average
fell
percent
while
the
shanghai
composite
dropped
as
much
as
percent
to
the
lowest
levels
since
late
taking
losses
so
far
this
week
to
almost
percent
wall
street
offered
asia
a
weak
lead
overnight
with
the
s
p
falling
just
over
percent
to
a
low
following
a
percent
drop
on
wednesday
the
share
market
is
now
about
percent
off
of
its
high
but
this
is
far
from
a
rare
occurrence
historically
economists
at
rbc
capital
markets
wrote
in
a
research
note
indeed
history
is
littered
with
over
type
selloffs
in
the
midst
of
economic
expansions
they
said
the
futures
of
the
index
rebounded
percent
in
asian
trade
on
friday
in
part
helped
by
media
report
that
the
treasury
department
will
not
call
china
a
currency
manipulator
in
its
upcoming
semiannual
report
however
chinese
trade
figures
on
friday
showed
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
hit
a
record
high
in
september
providing
a
likely
source
of
contention
with
president
donald
trump
over
trade
policies
and
the
currency
the
data
showed
solid
expansion
in
china
s
overall
imports
and
exports
suggesting
little
damage
from
the
tariffs
with
the
united
states
cboe
volatility
index
rose
on
thursday
to
its
highest
close
since
feb
pointing
to
investors
concern
of
further
losses
in
markets
there
still
appears
to
be
downside
risk
to
the
market
amid
worries
the
trade
war
may
be
slowing
down
global
growth
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo

asset
management
in
tokyo
so
far
this
week
chinese
and
shares
are
among
the
worst

in
a

investor
worries
about
the

are

gold
typically
seen
as

times

it

it

off
its
high

touched
on
tuesday
but
a
further
rise
in
the

costs
could
hurt
risk
sentiment
asian
stocks
appeared
to
have
stabilised
but
ultimately
where

will
settle
down
will
be
key
said
teppei

senior
analyst
at
mufg
bank
adding
confusion
for
investors
trump
launched
a
second
day
of
criticism
of
the
federal
reserve
on
thursday
calling
its
interest
rate
increases
a
ridiculous
policy
while
that
does
not
appear
to
have
shaken
investor
confidence
in
the
fed

independence
some
investors
suspect
expectations
on
future

hikes
could
be
undermined
if
trump
raises
his
threats
levels
i
doubt
trump
will
tolerate
further
rise
in

ahead
of
elections
i
believe
the
rise
in
yields
and
the
dollar
s

are
coming
to
a
turning
