german
utility
uniper
has
hit
back
at
suggestions
that
germany
should
sacrifice
the
company
s
planned
datteln
coal
power
plant
to
help
to
meet
the
country
s
climate
goals
the
rheinische
post
daily
reported
on
friday
that
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
proposed
that
germany
considers
shutting
close
to
gigawatts
gw
of
german
power
capacity
and
that
datteln
should
not
be
connected
to
the
power
grid
the
plant
is
already
under
contruction
and
slated
to
begin
operating
in
it
would
be
a
foolish
act
to
symbolically
sacrifice
datteln
within
a
possible
scenario
uniper
board
member
eckhardt
ruemmler
said
in
a
written
statement
instead
of
making
the
energy
transition
a
model
of
success
with
the
help
of
one
of
the
most
modern
power
stations
in
europe
we
would
instead
continue
to
operate
old
and
more
highly
plants
should
datteln
not
go
live
a
spokeswoman
for
the
berlin
ministry
said
altmaier
had
not
made
numerical
suggestions
regarding
coal
capacity
to
be
shut
she
referred
to
a
commission
that
is
due
to
meet
on
friday
ahead
of
a
deadline
to
come
up
with
a
schedule
for
limiting
and
phasing
out
power
generation
altmaier
is
not
part
of
the
commission
datteln
a
megawatt
mw
plant
should
have
started
in
but
proved
a
major
headache
for
uniper
attracting
protests
by
environmentalists
and
swallowing
billion
euros
billion
in
investment
so
far
it
has
also
been
held
up
by
damages
to
its
boiler
during
component
tests
ruemmler
emphasised
that
uniper
was
ready
to
work
with
the
government
on
making
power
production
less
and
eventually
get
out
of
coal
altogether
germany
still
derives
percent
of
its
power
from
coal
and
employs
tens
of
thousands
in
the
industry
the
coal
commission
will
help
to
allocate
federal
funds
amounting
to
billion
euros
in
the
current
government
s
term
for
bringing
new
industries
into
coal
regions
according
to
a
draft
proposal
seen
by
reuters
it
is
also
expected
to
discuss
additional
funding
needs
and
infrastructure
for
the
future
of
the
regions
working
closely
with
the
european
union
