update 1-german justice minister committed to tougher sanctions on companies
berlin
reuters
the
german
government
is
committed
to
introducing
tougher
sanctions
against
companies
that
foster
criminal
behavior
in
the
wake
of
volkswagen
s
diesel
emissions
scandal
the
country
s
justice
minister
said
in
an
interview
published
in
friday
s
edition
of
the
handelsblatt
newspaper
katarina
barley
said
she
had
seen
a
pattern
whereby
companies
try
to
blame
individual
managers
for
any
wrongdoing
this
was
very
blatant
in
the
diesel
scandal
in
several
companies
she
added
without
naming
any
of
the
companies
barley
said
individuals
will
in
future
still
be
responsible
for
any
crimes
they
commit
but
if
there
is
a
visible
structure
in
a
company
that
fosters
and
covers
up
criminal
behavior
there
should
be
penalties
for
companies
in
the
future
she
said
a
coalition
agreement
between
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
and
their
spd
partners
signed
in
march
included
plans
to
ensure
that
companies
that
profit
from
the
wrongdoing
of
staff
members
face
tougher
sanctions
the
agreement
said
that
the
maximum
penalty
for
companies
generating
more
than
million
euros
in
annual
revenues
should
be
raised
to
percent
of
annual
sales
up
from
a
cap
of
million
euros
previously
while
it
is
unlikely
that
all
plans
in
the
coalition
agreement
will
be
implemented
barley
s
comments
suggest
that
the
proposal
on
company
sanctions
could
become
law
volkswagen
in
admitted
to
using
illegal
software
to
cheat
emissions
tests
sparking
a
scandal
that
has
cost
it
more
than
billion
in
penalties
and
fines
environmental
lobby
group
duh
which
has
been
seeking
bans
on
diesel
cars
in
a
number
of
german
cities
in
the
wake
the
vw
scandal
told
handelsblatt
that
barley
of
the
spd
party
was
not
going
far
enough
new
legislation
should
require
that
sanctions
against
companies
are
pursued
and
it
should
also
allow
companies
to
be
sanctioned
even
if
none
of
their
staff
members
can
be
made
personally
liable
duh
managing
director
juergen
resch
told
the
paper
our
criminal
law
is
being
hampered
by
the
fact
that
only
people
but
not
companies
can
be
punished
that
is
absurd
he
said
german
industry
association
bdi
meanwhile
criticized
barley
saying
the
proposed
change
in
law
risked
unnecessarily
criminalizing
companies
existing
law
already
offers
ways
to
sanction
both
individuals
and
companies
