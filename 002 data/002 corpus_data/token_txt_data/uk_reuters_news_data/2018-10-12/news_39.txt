uk to cut hybrid car subsidies
london
reuters
britain
will
cut
the
incentives
available
to
those
buying
hybrid
vehicles
as
it
focuses
on
pure
electric
models
sparking
anger
from
an
industry
trade
body
as
carmakers
already
face
declining
sales
in
europe
s
autos
market
buyers
of
vehicles
which
emit
less
than
of
and
have
a
range
of
at
least
miles
will
see
the
grant
they
are
eligible
for
reduced
by
percent
to
pounds
those
purchasing
cars
emitting
up
to
of
but
with
a
lower
range
will
no
longer
be
eligible
for
such
support
under
plans
due
to
come
into
force
next
month
with
hybrid
models
like
the
mitsubishi
outlander
becoming
popular
among
consumers
the
government
is
focussing
its
attention
to
zero
emission
models
such
as
the
nissan
leaf
and
bmw
the
government
said
in
a
statement
hybrid
vehicles
have
both
a
combustion
and
electric
engine
the
announcement
comes
just
over
two
weeks
before
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
philip
hammond
is
due
to
make
his
annual
budget
statement
sales
of
vehicles
which
include
different
types
of
cars
are
the
fastest
growing
part
of
the
market
rising
percent
so
far
this
year
according
to
data
from
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
smmt
however
the
overall
market
is
down
percent
so
far
this
year
hit
by
a
clampdown
on
diesel
and
more
stringent
emissions
tests
prematurely
removing
upfront
purchase
grants
can
have
a
devastating
impact
on
demand
without
incentives
government
s
ambitions
will
not
be
delivered
