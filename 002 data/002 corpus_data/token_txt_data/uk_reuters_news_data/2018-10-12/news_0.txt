killed
a
contract

a
project
to
convert
plutonium
from
cold
bombs
into
power
which
it
has
said
would
cost
tens
of

a

in
its
entirety
and
is
effective
immediately

halted
a
lower

s
injunction
of
the
department
of

doe

comment
south
carolina
politicians
including
republican
senator
lindsey
graham
have
defended
the
mox
plant
saying
it
was
about
percent
complete
would
help
keep
plutonium
out
of
the
hands
of
militants
and
provide
up
to
direct
jobs
the
doe
told
senate
and
house
of
representatives
committees
in
may
that
mox
a
type
of
specialized
nuclear
recycling
plant
that
has
never
been
built
in
the
united
states
would
cost
about
billion
more
than
the
billion
already
spent
on
it
instead
of
completing
mox
the
trump
administration
like
the
obama
administration
before
it
wants
to
blend
the
tonnes
of
deadly
plutonium
enough
to
make
about
nuclear
weapons
with
an
inert
substance
and
bury
it
underground
in
new
mexico
s
waste
isolation
pilot
plant
wipp
burying
the
plutonium
would
cost
nearly
billion
over
the
next
two
decades
and
would
require
jobs
at
savannah
river
the
doe
has
estimated
the
doe
has
said
the
savannah
river
site
could
be
used
to
manufacture
new
plutonium
pits
or
triggers
for
nuclear
weapons
but
there
have
not
been
final
decisions
on
that
plan
and
south
carolina
governor
henry
mcmaster
has
complained
it
would
not
provide
jobs
for
many
years
mox
opponents
praised
the
closure
taxpayers
can
now
rest
easier
that
their
money
will
no
longer
be
thrown
down
a
black
hole
called
mox
said
tom
clements
of
the
savannah
river
site
watch
an
nnsa
spokeswoman
said
the
agency
will
work
with
