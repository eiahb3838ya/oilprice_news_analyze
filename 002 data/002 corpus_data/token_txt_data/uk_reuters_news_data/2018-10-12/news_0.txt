in
less
than
two
days
into
a
category
hurricane
on
the

apart
entire
neighbourhoods

we
ve
been
writing
things
down
on
pieces
of
paper
we
re
doing
what
we
can
with
the
minimal
media
that
we
she
said
local
television
stations
were
knocked
off
the
air
for
two
days
and
authorities
were
relying
on
the
gulf
state
college
radio
station
to
transmit
public
service
bulletins
search
teams
went
hunting
victims
fema
s
long
urged
communities
such
as
mexico
beach
where
many
homes
were
pulverized
by
to
feet
to
meters
of
storm
surge
to
rebuild
to
withstand
future
storms
it
s
ok
if
you
want
to
live
on
the
coast
or
on
top
of
a
mountain
that
sees
wildfires
or
whatever
but
you
have
to
build
to
a
higher
standard
he
said
if
we
re
going
to
rebuild
do
it
by
friday
morning
the
storm
remnants

massachusetts
packing
maximum
sustained
winds
of
mph
kph
more
than
homes
and
businesses
on

it
could
be
weeks
before
power
is
restored
to

damaged
parts

guard
said
it
rescued
people
even
as

searched
the
rubble
for
survivors
or
the

some
mexico
beach
residents
were
nervously
trickling
back
expressing
hope
the
place
nicknamed
the
forgotten
coast
would
not
change
too
much
as
it
rebuilds
it
was
the
perfect
beach
town
not
all
of
that
commercialism
said
dottie
sinclair
a

adding
a
subway
