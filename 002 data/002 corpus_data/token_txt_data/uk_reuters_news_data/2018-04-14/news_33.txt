british
and
french
forces
pounded
syria
with
air
strikes
early
on
saturday
in
response
to
a
poison
gas
attack
that
killed
dozens
of
people
last
week
in
the
biggest
intervention
by
western
powers
against
syrian
president
bashar
president
donald
trump
announced
the
military
action
from
the
white
house
as
he
spoke
explosions
rocked
damascus
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
their
forces
had
joined
in
the
attack
with
more
than
missiles
fired
from
ships
and
manned
aircraft
the
allies
struck
three
of
syria
s
main
chemical
weapons
facilities
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
and
joint
chiefs
of
staff
chairman
general
joseph
dunford
said
mattis
called
the
strikes
a
one
time
shot
but
trump
raised
the
prospect
of
further
strikes
if
assad
s
government
again
uses
chemical
weapons
we
are
prepared
to
sustain
this
response
until
the
syrian
regime
stops
its
use
of
prohibited
chemical
agents
the
president
said
in
a
televised
address
the
syrian
conflict
pits
a
complex
myriad
of
parties
against
each
other
with
russia
and
iran
giving
assad
military
and
political
help
while
fractured
opposition
forces
have
had
varying
levels
of
support
at
different
times
from
the
west
arab
states
and
turkey
the
strikes
risked
raising
tension
in
an
already
combustible
region
but
appeared
designed
not
to
trigger
a
military
response
from
russia
and
iran
nevertheless
assad
s
government
and
russia
both
responded
angrily
again
we
are
being
threatened
we
warned
that
such
actions
will
not
be
left
without
consequences
anatoly
antonov
russia
s
ambassador
to
the
united
states
said
on
twitter
syrian
state
media
said
the
attack
would
fail
and
called
it
a
flagrant
violation
of
international
it
was
unclear
if
the
strikes
will
deter
assad
from
again
using
chemical
weapons
they
seemed
unlikely
to
have
much
impact
on
the
balance
of
power
in
syria
s
civil
war
in
which
assad
s
government
has
steadily
gained
the
upper
hand
against
armed
opponents
since
russia
intervened
in
trump
had
tough
words
for
assad
and
his
suspected
role
in
last
week
s
chemical
weapons
attack
these
are
not
the
actions
of
a
man
they
are
crimes
of
a
monster
he
said
at
least
six
loud
explosions
were
heard
in
damascus
and
smoke
was
seen
rising
over
the
city
a
reuters
witness
said
a
second
witness
said
the
barzah
district
of
damascus
had
been
hit
in
the
strikes
barzah
is
the
location
of
a
major
syrian
scientific
research
center
a
senior
official
in
a
regional
alliance
that
backs
damascus
told
reuters
that
said
the
syrian
government
and
its
allies
had
absorbed
the
attack
and
that
targeted
sites
were
evacuated
days
ago
thanks
to
a
warning
from
russia
syrian
tv
said
syrian
air
defenses
shot
down
missiles
fired
in
the
attack
the
russian
defence
ministry
said
none
of
the
rockets
launched
had
entered
zones
where
russian
air
defense
systems
are
protecting
facilities
in
tartus
and
hmeimim
the
combined
british
and
french
assault
appeared
to
be
more
intense
than
a
similar
strike
trump
ordered
almost
exactly
a
year
ago
against
a
syrian
air
base
in
retaliation
for
an
earlier
chemical
weapons
attack
that
washington
attributed
to
assad
the
targets
included
a
syrian
center
in
the
greater
damascus
area
for
the
research
development
production
and
testing
of
chemical
and
biological
weaponry
as
well
as
a
chemical
weapons
storage
facility
near
the
city
of
homs
a
third
target
also
near
homs
contained
both
a
chemical
weapons
equipment
storage
facility
and
a
command
post
at
a
pentagon
briefing
dunford
said
the
air
strikes
on
saturday
were
planned
to
minimize
the
risk
of
casualties
among
russia
s
forces
in
syria
mattis
acknowledged
that
the
united
states
conducted
the
air
strikes
only
with
conclusive
evidence
that
chlorine
gas
was
used
in
the
april
attack
in
syria
evidence
that
the
nerve
agent
sarin
also
was
used
is
inconclusive
he
said
allegations
of
assad
s
chlorine
use
are
frequent
in
syria
s
conflict
raising
questions
about
whether
washington
had
lowered
the
threshold
for
military
action
in
syria
by
now
deciding
to
strike
after
a
chlorine
gas
attack
mattis
who
officials
said
had
earlier
warned
in
internal
debates
that
too
large
an
attack
would
risk
confrontation
with
russia
described
the
strikes
as
a
to
dissuade
assad
from
doing
this
but
a
official
familiar
with
the
military
planning
said
there
could
be
more
air
strikes
if
the
intelligence
indicates
that
assad
has
not
stopped
manufacturing
importing
storing
or
using
chemical
weapons
including
weaponized
chlorine
the
official
acknowledged
that
could
require
a
more
sustained
air
and
naval
presence
in
the
region
as
well
as
intensified
satellite
and
other
surveillance
of
syria
trump
however
has
been
leery
of
military
involvement
in
the
middle
east
and
is
eager
to
withdraw
roughly
troops
who
are
in
syria
as
part
of
the
battle
against
islamic
state
militants
the
air
strikes
however
risk
dragging
the
united
states
further
into
syria
s
civil
war
particularly
if
russia
iran
and
assad
opt
to
retaliate
america
does
not
seek
an
indefinite
presence
in
syria
under
no
circumstances
trump
said
in
his
address
the
purpose
of
our
actions
tonight
is
to
establish
a
strong
deterrent
against
the
production
spread
and
use
of
chemical
weapons
he
said
the
president
who
has
tried
to
build
good
relations
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
had
sharply
critical
words
for
russia
and
iran
over
their
support
of
assad
to
iran
and
to
russia
i
ask
what
kind
of
a
nation
wants
to
be
associated
with
the
mass
murder
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
trump
said
may
said
she
had
authorized
british
armed
forces
to
conduct
coordinated
and
targeted
strikes
to
degrade
the
syrian
regime
s
chemical
weapons
she
described
it
as
a
limited
and
targeted
strike
aimed
at
minimizing
civilian
casualties
macron
said
we
can
not
tolerate
the
employment
of
chemical
last
year
the
united
states
fired
tomahawk
cruise
missiles
from
the
guided
missile
destroyers
uss
porter
and
the
uss
ross
that
struck
the
shayrat
air
base
the
targets
of
that
strike
included
syrian
aircraft
aircraft
shelters
petroleum
and
logistical
storage
facilities
ammunition
supply
bunkers
air
defense
systems
and
radar
at
the
time
the
pentagon
said
that
a
fifth
of
syria
s
operational
aircraft
were
either
damaged
or
destroyed
the
attack
on
syria
will
be
seen
as
limited
if
it
is
now
over
and
there
is
no
second
round
of
strikes
said
a
senior
official
in
the
regional
alliance
that
has
supported
president
bashar
in
the
syrian
war
if
it
is
finished
and
there
is
no
second
round
it
will
be
considered
limited
