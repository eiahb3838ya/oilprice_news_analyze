dakar
reuters
the
international
monetary
fund
said
it
was
resuming
loan
disbursements
to
chad
after
the
central
african
oil
producer
reached
an
agreement
in
principal
to
restructure
its
more
than
billion
debt
to
glencore
and
four
banks
glencore
and
the
banks
lent
chad
s
state
oil
firm
about
billion
in
to
be
repaid
with
crude
oil
cargoes
but
global
oil
prices
crashed
shortly
thereafter
the
debt
has
eaten
up
nearly
all
of
chad
s
oil
profits
its
main
source
of
revenue
prompting
tense
negotiations
that
began
last
year
about
restructuring
the
agreement
struck
in
february
extends
the
maturity
of
the
debt
and
provides
a
grace
period
on
principal
payments
the
imf
approved
about
million
in
credit
to
chad
at
the
end
of
june
and
initially
released
million
but
a
decision
on
the
next
disbursement
was
delayed
as
the
government
s
talks
with
its
creditors
dragged
on
in
a
statement
late
on
friday
the
imf
said
it
would
immediately
disburse
about
million
mitsuhiro
furusawa
the
fund
s
deputy
managing
director
said
the
february
deal
is
expected
to
yield
the
necessary
financing
for
the
programme
and
firmly
restore
external
debt
stability
the
imf
also
said
it
expects
chad
s
economy
to
grow
by
percent
this
year
after
it
contracted
by
percent
last
year
assuming
the
terms
of
the
agreement
are
implemented
