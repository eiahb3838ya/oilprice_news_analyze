investigators
probing
mercedes
maker
daimler
have
found
that
its
cars
were
equipped
with
software
which
may
have
help
them
to
pass
diesel
emissions
tests
a
german
newspaper
reported
on
sunday
citing
confidential
documents
there
has
been
growing
scrutiny
of
diesel
vehicles
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
installing
secret
software
on
vehicles
that
allowed
them
to
emit
up
to
times
legally
allowable
emissions
while
meeting
standards
when
tested
by
regulators
daimler
which
faces
ongoing
investigations
by
and
german
authorities
into
excess
diesel
emissions
has
said
investigations
could
lead
to
significant
penalties
and
recalls
the
bild
am
sonntag
newspaper
said
that
the
documents
showed
that
investigators
had
found
several
software
functions
that
helped
daimler
cars
pass
emissions
tests
including
one
which
switched
off
emissions
cleaning
after
km
of
driving
another
function
under
scrutiny
allowed
the
emissions
cleaning
system
to
recognise
whether
the
car
was
being
tested
based
on
speed
or
acceleration
patterns
bild
am
sonntag
also
cited
emails
from
daimler
engineers
questioning
whether
these
software
functions
were
legal
a
daimler
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
content
of
the
documents
saying
the
german
company
was
fully
cooperating
with
the
authorities
and
had
agreed
upon
strict
confidentiality
with
the
department
of
justice
the
authorities
know
the
documents
and
no
complaint
has
been
filed
the
spokesman
said
the
documents
available
to

have
obviously
selectively
been
released
in
