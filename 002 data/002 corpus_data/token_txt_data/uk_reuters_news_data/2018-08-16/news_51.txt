analysis-new fuel rules push shipowners to go green with lng
london
reuters
tough
new
rules
on
marine
fuel
are
forcing
shipowners
to
explore
liquefied
natural
gas
as
a
cleaner
alternative
and
ports
such
as
gibraltar
are
preparing
to
offer
upgraded
refuelling
facilities
in
the
shipping
industry
s
biggest
in
decades
from
international
maritime
organisation
rules
will
ban
ships
from
using
fuels
with
a
sulphur
content
above
percent
compared
with
percent
now
unless
they
are
equipped
to
clean
up
sulphur
emissions
this
will
be
enforced
by
fines
levied
by
the
imo
s
member
states
using
lng
to
power
ships
instead
of
heavy
fuel
oil
or
the
lighter
marine
gasoil
can
reduce
polluting
emissions
of
nitrogen
oxides
and
sulphur
oxides
by
to
percent
according
to
industry
estimates
the
stakes
are
high
analysts
at
swiss
bank
ubs
estimate
that
the
green
shipping
market
could
be
worth
at
least
billion
over
the
next
five
years
to
scoop
up
some
that
market
the
british
territory
of
gibraltar
is
in
the
process
of
launching
an
power
station
whose
accompanying
storage
tanks
will
also
be
able
to
be
used
to
refuel
cargo
ships
via
barges
gibraltar
already
supplies
the
most
marine
fuel
of
any
port
in
the
mediterranean
and
aims
to
do
the
same
with
lng
said
manuel
tirado
chief
executive
of
the
gibraltar
port
authority
the
gpa
s
aim
is
to
be
the
number
one

in
the

however
this
is
something
that
will
not
happen
overnight
he
told
reuters
the
shipping
industry
is
under
pressure
to
cut
its
emissions
of
the
main
greenhouse
gas
which
causes
global
warming
carbon
dioxide
by
at
least
percent
by
from
levels
after
the
imo
agreed
on
a
target
in
april
after
years
of
debate
although
still
a
fossil
fuel
lng
emits
to
percent
less
than
even
fuel
oil
a
period
of
low
oil
prices
slowed
the
of
lng
as
a
marine
fuel
but
over
the
past
year
as
the
oil
price
has
risen
appetite
has
grown
in
the
cruise
ship
industry
as
well
as
in
the
container
cargo
and
tanker
sectors
there
are
currently
ships
around
the
world

said
ships
with
engines
capable
of
using
lng
would
be
delivered
in
the
largest
annual
number
to

over
the
last
year
or
so
there
is
a
growing
consensus
among
shipowners
that
lng
is
a
reasonable
next
step
it
is
gaining
traction
said
martin
wold
a
senior
consultant
at

but
the
transition
to
lng
will
take
time
with

only

of

account

accounts
for
about
half
of

s
daily
operating
cost
one
of
the
challenges
in
using
lng
to
power
ships
has
been
the
investment
needed
to
build
the
required
refuelling
facilities
in
addition
commercial
vessels
powered
by
lng
cost
around
million
more
than
regular
ships
retrofitting
is
also
costly
as
existing
ships
require
space
to
install
much
bigger
fuel
tanks
to
keep
the
gas
from
evaporating
for
gibraltar
the
construction
of
the
new
lng
power
plant
by
royal
dutch
shell
will
help
to
create
some
of
the
required
ship
refuelling
infrastructure
the
lng
for
the
power
plant
will
be
used
solely
for
the
power
plant
however
the
same
marine
infrastructure
that
provides
the
lng
for
the
power
plant
will
also
be
able
to
be
utilised
to
supply
lng
to
vessels
the
current
focus
is
to
deliver
lng
by
barge
said
tirado
the
gibraltar
port
authority
chief
tirado
said
authorities
in
gibraltar
were
working
on
a
legal
framework
that
would
allow
ships
to
be
refuelled
with
lng
in
the
near
future
a
shell
spokeswoman
said
the
supply
of
lng
to
gibraltar
opens
up
the
possibility
for
other
future
lng
applications
in
gibraltar
such
as
the
use
of
lng
as
a
cleaner
burning
maritime
fuel
malta
is
studying
the
provision
of
lng
refuelling
facilities
at
its
ports
and
other
places
such
as
barcelona
are
working
on
providing
lng
bunkering
zeebrugge
and
rotterdam
are
already
supplying
lng
via
barges
elsewhere
several
lng
bunkering
vessels
from
which
merchant
ships
can
refuel
have
been
delivered
to
operate
in
locations
such
as
the
amsterdam
rotterdam
antwerp
region
the
north
sea
the
baltic
sea
and
the
coast
of
florida
we
are
reaching
a
tipping
point
where
shipowners
are
starting
to
commit
to
ships
at
scale

planning
for

meet
the
sulphur
rules
in

companies
can
use
fuel
install
a
scrubber
and
continue
to
use
heavy
fuel
oil
or
switch
to
lng
sulphur
scrubbers
can
cost
up
to
million
per
ship
and
will
not
help
lower
emissions
in
the
longer
term
according
to
analysts
at
ubs
in
the
future
ships
could
be
fuelled
by
methanol
biofuels
systems
or
hydrogen
but
these
are
not
technologically
advanced
enough
and
very
costly
since
demand
will
inevitably
shift
to
compliant
fuels
low

in
the
as
well
as

the
main
losers
will
be
refiners
unless
they
adjust
their
production
