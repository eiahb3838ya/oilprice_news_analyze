in

despite
the
modest

of
a

in
the
chinese
economy
and
turkey
s
volatile
currency
keep
investors
on
guard
the
news
of
the

it
is

limited
significance

sakuma
said
turkey
s
market
swings
reflect
the

that
it

one

the
more
vulnerable
parts
of

the
federal

seeks
to
normalise
its
monetary
policy

noted
there
were
arguably
larger
risks
for
investors
such
as
weak
