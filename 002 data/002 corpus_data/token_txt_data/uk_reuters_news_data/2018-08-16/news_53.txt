blockchain benefits still murky for most commodities trading
london
reuters
commodity
firms
and
banks
have
been
diving
into
blockchain
pilot
schemes
over
the
last
two
years
but
the
new
technology
s
application
for
most
trading
has
likely
been
a
report
by
boston
consulting
group
bcg
said
blockchain
originally
the
platform
behind
cryptocurrency
bitcoin
is
viewed
by
some
as
a
solution
to
inefficiencies
improving
transparency
and
reducing
to
the
risk
of
fraud
but
bcg
believes
its
potential
has
been
exaggerated
a
ledger
blockchain
uses
a
shared
database
that
updates
in
and
can
process
and
settle
transactions
in
minutes
without
the
need
for
verification
the
volume
of
trades
through
various
schemes
has
been
negligible
so
far
and
it
is
too
early
to
tell
how
soon
it
might
reach
a
critical
mass
there
are
so
many
pilot
schemes
but
none
have
become
real
production
scale
systems
yet
one
of
the
problems
is
that
it
s
not
designed
for
physical
trades
the
fundamental
issue
how
do
you
track
a
physical
entity
in
a
virtual
world
it
s
two
worlds
colliding
antti
belt
of
the
bcg
report
said
among
the
obstacles
to
scaling
up
the
technology
include
reconciling
terminologies
and
whether
the
switch
to
a
blockchain
platform
is
even
financially
justifiable
the
industry
is
very
old
and
everyone
uses
a
different
language
how
do
you
define
quality
shipment
schedules
a
lot
of
reconciliation
is
currently
needed
for
both
sides
belt
said
people
have
spent
millions
sometimes
over
million
on
it
system
do
they
want
to
do
it
again
furthermore
it
is
uncertain
to
what
degree
traders
will
want
to
adopt
a
technology
that
will
erode
already
profit
margins
bcg
said
that
as
the
platforms
take
shape
it
would
be
bad
news
for
merchant
traders
as
the
price
inefficiencies
and
unequal
dissemination
of
information
that
they
rely
on
to
make
profits
would
disappear
the
use
of
blockchain
solutions
would
significantly
improve
transparency
it
would
also
create
a
more
efficient
and
liquid
market
moving
commodity
trading
away
from
bilateral
deals
struck
directly
between
two
parties
to
transactions
based
on
electronic
platforms
to
match
buyers
and
sellers
the
report
said
steven
kok
said
interest
in
the
wider
adoption
of
blockchain
technology
would
start
where
the
primary
driver
is
certifying
the
source
of
the
asset
as
with
diamonds
rather
than
efficiency
anglo
american
s
de
beers
said
in
may
it
had
tracked
diamonds
from
miner
to
retailer
using
blockchain
in
the
first
effort
of
its
kind
to
clear
the
supply
chain
of
impostors
and
exploitation
nevertheless
major
companies
and
banks
have
tested
blockchain
across
commodities
such
as
in
power
diamonds
food
and
oil
last
year
a
consortium
including
major
banks
trading
firms
and
producers
bp
equinor
and
royal
dutch
shell
announced
that
they
would
develop
a
platform
ready
to
go
by
the
end
of
separately
commodities
trader
trafigura
set
up
another
platform
with
ibm
and
natixis
for
the
crude
oil
market
last
year
major
agriculture
traders
have
also
tried
blockchain
such
as
louis
dreyfus
co
with
a
cargo
of
soybeans
simply
put
blockchain
may
not
be
the
right
answer
for
all
players
