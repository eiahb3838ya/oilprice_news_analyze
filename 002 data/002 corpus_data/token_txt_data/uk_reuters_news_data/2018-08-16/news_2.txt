supply
deal
with
a
canadian
company
planning
to
build
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminal
a
sales
and
purchase
agreement
would
boost
the
chances
that
pieridae
energy
would
decide
to
build
the
c
billion
billion
goldboro
project
which
would
be
the
first
lng
export
terminal
on
canada
s

in
oil
and
gas

deliveries
are
estimated
to
begin
in

third
quarter
of

months
said
chief

alfred
sorensen
in
an
interview

declined

axpo
supply
agreement
pieridae
already
has
a
agreement
to
sell
five
million
tonnes
annually
to
german
utility
uniper
goldboro
would
produce
million
tonnes
annually
starting
in
if
construction
begins
by
securing
financing
for
such
a
large
project
mainly
through
offtakes
is
a
big
challenge
however
for
a
company
with
a
c
million
market
cap
are
we
delusional
about
how
we
can
get
to
the
finish
line
it
really
has
been
from
the
very
beginning
about
how
we
can
work
with
the
germans
and
work
to
improve
their
energy
security
sorensen
said
germany
depends
heavily
on
gas
imports
from
russia
and
is
seeking
to
diversify
its
suppliers
pieridae
is
finalising
a
loan
guarantee
of
at
least

the
german

the
company
is
very
close
to
securing
enough
committed
sales
to
make
a
positive
final
investment

said
five
other
