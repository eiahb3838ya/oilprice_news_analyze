angola
will
launch
next
year
a
new
agency
to
handle
oil
concessions
the
government
said
on
thursday
as
president
joão
lourenço
pushes
ahead
with
reforms
aimed
at
boosting
production
in
africa
s
second
biggest
oil
industry
the
creation
of
a
national
agency
of
petroleum
and
gas
to
manage
and
sell
oil
blocks
reduces
the
near
total
grip
state
energy
firm
sonangol
has
over
the
sector
since
lourenço
became
president
in
september
he
has
moved
to
overhaul
sonangol
which
has
been
criticised
by
transparency
and
rights
groups
for
a
lack
of
transparency
as
both
producer
and
regulator
angola
hopes
the
shift
will
help
reverse
a
decline
in
oil
output
in
the
opec
member
by
reducing
bureaucracy
and
speeding
up
the
pace
at
which
company
investments
can
be
approved
it
is
part
of
a
series
of
measures
taken
by
lourenço
aimed
at
revamping
the
sector
including
tax
breaks
for
the
development
of
marginal
fields
and
new
legislation
for
gas
rights
angola
s
oil
production
is
expected
to
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
in
compared
to
million
barrels
a
decade
ago
without
a
spike
in
fresh
investment
production
is
set
to
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
by
according
to
the
ministry
of
mineral
resources
and
oil
the
decline
is
partly
due
to
a
fall
in
crude
prices
and
a
lack
of
investment
appetite
from
international
majors
given
the
high
relative
cost
of
production
in
angola
s
offshore
fields
but
the
government
has
also
concluded
that
a
bottleneck
in
the
approval
of
new
projects
at
sonangol
under
the
previous
management
of
isabel
dos
santos
daughter
of
lourenço
s
predecessor
was
also
responsible
the
ministry
said
the
new
agency
would
be
rolled
out
from
january
and
would
gradually
take
over
functions
from
sonangol
by
december
the
agency
should
be
fully
operational
for
sonangol
the
proposed
model
allows
it
to
focus
on
its
core
activities
the
ministry
said
the
restructuring
of
sonangol
according
to
the
statement
will
also
involve
the
shedding
of
assets
outside
the
oil
sector
in
which
the
company
invested
during
the
oil
boom
