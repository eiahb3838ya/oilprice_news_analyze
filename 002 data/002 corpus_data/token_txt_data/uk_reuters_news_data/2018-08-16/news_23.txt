kept

about
the

while
crude
was
also
pressured
by
broader
selling
of
industrial

it
also
really
reflects
how
the
theme
in
the
commodities
market
has
so
quickly
changed
from
being
one
where
the
worry
was
about
supply
with
iran
sanctions
for
oil
or
chilean
miner
strikes
for
copper
and
now
the
focus
is
on
brent
crude
futures
are
resting
on
the
moving
average
a
key
technical
level
for
the
first
time
in
a

say
a
break
below
this
point
could
trigger
