column-best commodity bets? exposed to china and less open to trade: russell

the
recent
gyrations
in
the
world
economy
around
turkey
s
currency
and
the
escalating
trade
dispute
have
taken
a
toll
on
commodity
prices
especially
industrial
metals
however
while
sentiment
can
clearly
pummel
markets
over
a
longer
period
of
time
not
all
commodities
will
be
equally
affected
by
the
changing
global
economic
dynamics
the
key
to
which
commodities
are
likely
to
perform
better
is
china
which
is
the
world
s
largest
commodity
importer
even
if
the
chinese
economy
does
struggle
under
the
weight
of
the
trade
barriers
erected
by
president
donald
trump
there
are
still
likely
to
be
commodities
that
can
hold
their
own
the
key
is
to
look
for
commodities
that
are
likely
to
remain
in
relatively
high
demand
and
are
subject
to
supply
constraints
on
this
basis
coal
becomes
the
darling
of
the
commodity
complex
as
chinese
import
demand
has
been
robust
and
will
likely
remain
so
as
beijing
cuts
back
on
domestic
output
as
part
of
efforts
to
cut
pollution
china
s
coal
imports
surged
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
from
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
customs
data
and
it
s
not
just
china
boosting
coal
with
the
world
s
importer
india
also
increasing
overseas
purchases
by
about
percent
in
the
first
seven
months
to
about
million
tonnes
while
it
s
true
that
chinese
import
demand
for
coal
has
been
partially
driven
by
higher
power
generation
because
of
the
recent
heatwave
the
market
may
also
be
changing
from
a
structural
perspective
china
s
coal
output
fell
percent
in
july
from
the
prior
month
to
million
tonnes
the
lowest
in
two
years
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
said
on
while
coal
has
in
recent
weeks
reached
year
highs
of
around
a
tonne
china
is
also
importing
more
natural
gas
both
in
a
liquefied
state
on
ships
and
by
pipeline
from
neighbouring
countries
imports
of
pipeline
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
rose
percent
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
to
million
tonnes
according
to
customs
data
while
the
rate
of
growth
has
slowed
from
s
breakneck
speed
china
is
still
increasing
its
demand
for
natural
gas
at
a
pace
that
is
rapidly
eating
away
expectations
of
an
oversupplied
lng
market
after
the
commissioning
of
several
new
projects
in
australia
and
the
united
states
however
coal
is
still
a
better
bet
than
lng
from
a
supply
perspective
with
major
exporters
australia
indonesia
and
south
africa
all
largely
unable
to
boost
exports
as
mines
are
already
running
at
capacity
and
new
projects
have
been
lacking
only
the
united
states
can
realistically
supply
much
more
coal
to
the
global
market
and
its
exports
to
china
are
now
uncompetitive
after
beijing
slapped
a
tariff
on
them
in
retaliation
for
tariffs
on
its
goods
the
other
commodities
that
china
may
exert
a
positive
influence
upon
are
those
most
likely
to
benefit
from
the
current
in
infrastructure
spending
most
likely
iron
ore
coking
coal
and
steel
beijing
has
once
again
opened
the
fiscal
taps
in
an
effort
to
counteract
any
economic
slowing
caused
by
the
trade
dispute
with
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
china
rolled
out
a
billion
urban
railway
plan
on
and
pushed
local
governments
to
speed
up
the
issuance
of
special
infrastructure
bonds
amid
fears
of
a
slowdown
in
fixed
asset
investment
which
grew
at
percent
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
below
market
expectations
while
these
and
other
measures
do
little
to
ease
worries
about
credit
quality
in
china
from
a
commodity
perspective
they
are
likely
to
underpin
demand
for
the
steel
complex
and
perhaps
to
a
lesser
extent
copper
which
is
also
used
in
construction
for
wiring
another
factor
worth
noting
is
that
while
the
commodities
likely
to
perform
better
on
the
back
of
chinese
demand
are
all
tradable
they
are
nowhere
near
as
liquid
as
the
ones
that
may
underperform
crude
oil
natural
gas
copper
and
other
metals
such
as
zinc
and
nickel
all
have
deep
and
liquid
futures
markets
while
paper
coal
markets
are
well
established
they
are
tiny
in
comparison
and
the
same
can
be
said
for
iron
ore
and
lng
they
key
to
success
in
commodity
markets
in
what
may
be
challenging
times
ahead
may
lie
in
being
a
commodity
that
remains
in
demand
in
china
and
is
less
accessible
to
your
average
investor
