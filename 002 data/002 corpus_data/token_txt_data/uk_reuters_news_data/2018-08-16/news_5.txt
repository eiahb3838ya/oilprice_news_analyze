department
to
do
a
full
environmental
review
of
a
revised
route
for
the
keystone
xl
oil
pipeline
possibly
delaying
its
construction
and
dealing
another
setback
to
transcanada
corp
for
more
than
a
decade
environmentalists
tribal
groups
and
ranchers
have

for
the
indigenous
environmental
network
and
other
plaintiffs
ordering
the
review
of
a
revised
pipeline
route
through
nebraska
to
supplement
one
the
state
department
did
on
the
original
path
in
the
state
department
was
obligated
to
analyze
new
information
relevant
to
the
environmental
impacts
of
its
decision
to
issue
a
permit
for
the
pipeline
last
year
morris
said
in
his
ruling
supporting
the
project
are
canadian
oil
producers
who
face
price
discounts
over
transport
bottlenecks
and
refineries
and
pipeline
builders
transcanada
is
reviewing
the
decision
company
spokesman
matthew
john
said
it
hopes
to
start
preliminary
work
in
montana
in
the
coming
months
and
to
begin
construction
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
company
said
this
month
it
expects
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
late
this
year
or
in
early
the
ruling
is
negative
for
transcanada
since
it
adds
uncertainty
to
timing
said
rbc
analyst
robert
kwan
and
it
was
important
that
the
pipeline
be
constructed
during
the
current
presidential
cycle
president
donald
trump
is
keen
to
see
the
building
of
the
pipeline
which
was
axed
by
former
president
barack
obama
in
on
environmental
concerns
relating
to
emissions
that
cause
climate
change
transcanada
shares
rose
percent
in
trading
in
toronto
the
white
house
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
state
department
is
reviewing
the
court
s
order
a
spokesman
said
the
ruling
was
a
rejection
of
the
trump
administration
s
attempt
to
force
keystone
xl
on
the
american
people
said
jackie
prange
a
lawyer
for
the
natural
resources
defense
council
an
environmental
group
trump
pushed
to
approve
the
pipeline
soon
after
he
took
office
and
a
state
department
official
signed
a
presidential
permit
in
allowing
it
to
move
forward
however
morris
declined
the
plaintiff
s
request
to
void
that
permit
which
was
based
on
the
review
last
year
nebraska
regulators
approved
an
alternative
route
for
the
pipeline
which
will
cost
transcanada
millions
of
dollars
more
than
the
original
path
in
a
draft
environmental
assessment
last
month
the
state
department
said
keystone
xl
would
not
harm
water
supplies
or
wildlife
that
review
is
less
than
the
full
environmental
impact
