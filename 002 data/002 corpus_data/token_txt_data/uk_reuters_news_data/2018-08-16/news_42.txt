french
oil
major
total
said
it
was
searching
for
more
resources
in
africa
including
in
senegal
and
mauritania
the
company
is
historically
strong
in
africa
and
buoyed
by
rising
oil
prices
and
improved
terms
for
its
dollar
kaombo
contract
in
angola
it
is
doubling

guy
maurice
total
s
head
of
exploration
and
production
in
africa
told
reuters
that
the
company
had
completed
seismic
surveys
and
planned
to
start
drilling
exploratory
wells
in
senegal
and
mauritania
in
west
africa
he
did
not
give
a
specific
timeframe
but
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
drilling
would
begin
at
the
end
of
this
year
or
in
early
total
has
broken
ranks
with
some
of
its
rivals
in
recent
years
and
largely
ignored
the
rush
to
shale
it
is
looking
to
eke
out
conventional
oil
and
gas
resources
seeking
projects
in
africa
and
the
middle
east
the
strategy
carries
risks
it
has
left
the
company
exposed
to
political
instability
that
has
deterred
some
competitors
and
although
production
costs
in
its
africa
oil
and
gas
operations
have
fallen
from
billion
in
to
billion
in
they
remain
the
highest
among
six
geographic
regions
total
operates
in
according
to
its
annual
report
total
started
production
at
the
deep
offshore
kaombo
north
project
in
angola
at
the
end
of
july
it
has
also
announced
it
will
launch
another
field
in
the
southern
african
country
zinia
which
is
expected
to
pump
oil
in
the
company

a
bigger
presence
in
africa
than
its
rivals
although
several
of
them
are
also
major
producers
there
and
have
invested
billions
of
dollars
in
recent
projects

has
the
largest
proven
reserves
in
africa
among
the
world

top

companies
last

according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of

statements
with

of

billion

million
investors
and
analysts
are
looking
closely
at
whether
total
can
keep
a
lid
on
costs
in
angola
where
it
has
struggled
to
rein
in
spending
in
recent
years
and
in
needed
oil
prices
at
around
a
barrel
to
break
even
total
s
maurice
told
reuters
that
a
renegotiation
with
the
angolan
government
and
suppliers
had
allowed
total
to
shave
off
billion
from
the
initial
billion
budget
for
kaombo
on
zinia
capital
expenditure
was
reduced
by
more
than
percent
to
billion
from
billion
he
added
while
prices
have
rebounded
since
the
market
collapse
nothing
can
be
taken
for
granted
said
maurice
prices
have
gone
from
per
barrel
to
over
but
we
are
not
going
to
be
bringing
out
the
champagne
because
volatility
is
still
there
we
could
still
fall
back
to
per
barrel
at
higher
oil
prices
at
per
barrel
you
don
t
look
too
closely
at
what
you
spend
said
maurice
referring
to
negotiating
contracts
with
suppliers
and
the
government
he
said
the
company
s
oil
price
had
come
down
as
a
result
of
its
cost
savings
but
did
not
specify
the
price
the
billion
kaombo
project
kaombo
north
plus
kaombo
south
which
is
due
to
start
up
next
year
will
produce
an
estimated
barrels
of
oil
per
day
at
peak
according
to
total
and
is
expected
to
increase
angola
s
output
by
percent
zinia
will
add
another
barrels
per
day
a
lot
of
the
majors
have
had
their
heads
turned
by
tight
shale
oil
in
the
but
total
has
not
really
gone
that
route
they
re
still
focused
on
west
africa
and
angola
s
a
big
part
of
that
said
adam
pollard
a
senior
research
analyst
on
africa
oil
and
gas
at
wood
mackenzie
for
angola
an
opec
member
and
africa
s
second
largest
crude
exporter
total
s
commitment
was
important
because
its
output
had
been
declining
steadily
due
to
the
lack
of
investments
in
its
ageing
offshore
fields
in
nigeria
total
s
egina
field
is
expected
to
start
production
in
december
and
it
will
make
a
final
investment
decision
on
its
ikike
project
this
year
as
well
as
its
lake
albert
project
in
uganda
the
company
expects
these
projects
to
help
it
increase
its
african
production
by
percent
to
barrels

oil
equivalent
