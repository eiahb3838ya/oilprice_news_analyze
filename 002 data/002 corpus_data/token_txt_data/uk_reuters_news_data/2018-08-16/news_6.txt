washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
s
proposed
replacement
for
the
s
central
regulation
on
climate
change
the
clean
power
plan
is
expected
to
be
released
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
late
next
week
an
agency
source
said
on
thursday
the
replacement
for
former
president
barack
obama
s
plan
to
slash
carbon
emissions
from
power
plants
will
grant
states
the
ability
to
write
their
own
weaker
regulations
for
the
plants
a
politico
report
citing
a
portion
of
an
unpublished
draft
of
the
plan
said
this
week
the
trump
administration
focused
on
reversing
environmental
regulations
was
not
sure
at
first
whether
it
would
replace
the
clean
power
plan
but
after
pressure
from
electricity
generators
and
other
energy
interests
concerned
about
regulatory
certainty
and
litigation
over
emissions
linked
to
climate
change
from
environmentalists
former
epa
head
scott
pruitt
who
resigned
last
month
under
a
cloud
of
ethics
controversies
made
replacing
the
plan
with
a
more
industry
friendly
measure
a
top
priority
for
the
epa
in
under
obama
finalized
the
cpp
which
sought
to
reduce
emissions
from
power
plants
to
percent
below
levels
by
but
the
plan
never
took
effect
the
supreme
court
put
the
brakes
on
it
in
after
states
sued
the
epa
saying
it
had
exceeded
its
legal
reach
the
trump
administration
s
replacement
plan
would
also
give
states
the
ability
to
seek
permission
to
opt
out
of
regulations
on
power
plant
emissions
the
politico
report
said
the
epa
source
did
not
comment
on
the
report
but
a
move
to
let
states
opt
out
would
likely
face
staunch
opposition
from
electricity
industry
associations
because
in
many
states
the
cpp
s
limits
on
emissions
have
already
been
met
in
addition
opting
out
of
regulations
by
states
would
likely
be
fought
by
green
groups
in
the
courts
during
a
public
hearing
late
last
year
in
charleston
west
virginia
the
heart
of
coal
country
health
groups
environmentalists
and
a
former
coal
miner
criticized
the
trump
s
administration
s
proposal
to
dismantle
the
clean
power
plan
after
a
public
comment
period
on
the
proposed
trump
plan
a
final
epa
rule
is
expected
later
this
year
