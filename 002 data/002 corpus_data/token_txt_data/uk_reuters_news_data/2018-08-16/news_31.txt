rain pours into norway's dams, securing winter power supply

norway
s
power
supply
entirely
dependent
on
hydroelectric
dams
will
be
secure
this
winter
the
energy
regulator
said
on
thursday
as
rains
have
begun
filling
reservoirs
a
run
of
exceptionally
warm
dry
months
until
early
august
depleted
norway
s
water
supplies
lifting
power
prices
to
record
highs
triggering
power
imports
from
its
nordic
neighbours
and
raising
concerns
over
power
security
this
winter
rain
was
so
scarce
over
the
summer
that
the
norwegian
lutheran
church
asked
believers
to
light
candles
and
pray
for
rain
water
had
begun
flowing
into
reservoirs
more
quickly
in
the
last
two
weeks
although
the
power
market
was
still
in
deficit
the
water
resources
and
energy
directorate
nve
said
in
a
statement
however
in
nve
s
view
there
is
no
danger
of
security
of
supply
next
winter
the
regulator
said
the
nve
said
that
despite
the
reservoir
filling
rate
the
reservoirs
still
contained
a
lot
of
water
and
if
necessary
norway
could
import
power
through
connections
with
sweden
denmark
and
the
netherlands
in
years
of
average
rainfall
norway
has
a
power
surplus
of
about
terawatt
hours
twh
and
the
country
can
meet
its
power
needs
even
in
years
of
less
than
average
rainfall
the
nve
added
norway
s
reservoirs
were
percent
full
power
exchange
nordpool
said
on
wednesday
up
from
percent
last
week
however
the
nve
said
the
content
of
the
reservoirs
was
percentage
points
lower
than
normal
and
will
most
likely
not
reach
the
norm
this
even
though
security
of
supply
will
not
be
at
risk
norway
s
regulator
said
it
expected
reservoir
levels
to
hit
a
record
low
during
the
winter
norway
s
power
imports
exceeded
its
exports
in
several
days
during
the
summer
as
its
power
price
topped
those
of
its
nordic
and
continental
europe
neighbours
