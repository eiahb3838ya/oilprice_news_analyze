in

had
hired
investment
bank

bid
by
dno
under
british
takeover
rules
dno
would
be
free
to
increase
its

from
the

a
dividend
for
years
has
benefited
from
rising
output
in
the
kurdistan
region
of
iraq
the
unthinkable
happened
dno
dividend
we
guess
this
will
positively
surprise
the
market
as
we
and
probably
others
have
expected
to
see
excess
cash
to
be
invested
in
operations
said
as
rising
oil
prices
and
output
boosted
its
cashflows
from
the
middle
east
dno
said
last
year
it
would
return
to
the
north
sea
by
acquiring
assets
off
norway
and
the
uk
dno
also
said
it
planned
to
boost
output
from
its
peshkabir
field
in
the
kurdistan
region
of
iraq
to
barrels
of
oil
per
day
bopd
by
the
after
surpassing
a
previous
target
of
bopd
in
july
with
growing
production
and
robust
and
reliable
revenues
the
dividend
announcement
underscores
confidence
in
our
strong
growth
prospects
