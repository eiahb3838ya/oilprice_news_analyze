bruised
world
shares
and
emerging
market
currencies
fought
to
regain
their
footing
on
thursday
after
china
said
it
will
hold
trade
talks
with
the
united
states
later
this
month
and
turkey
s
lira
continued
its
recovery
run
asian
equities
had
hit
lows
overnight
as
they
tracked
wednesday
s
global
falls
and
tencent
results
disappointed
but
a
fresh
high
for
london
s
ftse
and
modest
gains
elsewhere
pulled
europe
and
wall
street
futures
up
at
the
same
time
a
dip
in
the
dollar
the
sight
of
the
lira
moving
back
to
per
dollar
and
a
higher
chinese
yuan
also
steadied
emerging
market
currencies
such
as
south
africa
s
rand
russia
s
rouble
and
mexico
s
peso
emerging
market
stocks
did
nudge
lower
again
though
after
they
had
crossed
the
percent
threshold
that
defines
a
bear
market
metals
markets
also
clawed
higher
however
after
copper
had
also
entered
bear
territory
the
chinese
are
heading
to
washington
and
yuan
bounced
the
qataris
are
heading
to
ankara
and
the
lira
bounced
and
that
has
left
everything
else
floating
around
really
said
societe
generale
s
global
head
of
currency
strategy
kit
juckes
he
added
that
it
was
still
too
early
to
sound
the
all
clear
around
turkey
its
new
finance
minister
and
of
president
tayyip
erdogan
was
about
to
hold
a
global
conference
call
and
that
the
broader
worries
were
still
around
the
extent
of
china
s
economic
slowdown
china
on
thursday
said
a
delegation
led
by
its
vice
commerce
minister
would
travel
to
the
united
states
for
talks
in
late
august
at
the
invitation
of
washington
hopes
that
it
could
ease
trade
tensions
helped
chinese
stocks
pare
losses
with
both
shanghai
composite
index
and
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
each
down
percent
earlier
in
the
day
shanghai
was
down
as
much
as
percent
while
hong
kong
was
off
percent
japan
s
nikkei
average
closed
percent
lower
in
choppy
trade
with
the
benchmark
falling
as
much
as
percent
before
a
brief
swing
into
positive
territory
on
china
news
the
euro
rose
percent
from
a
month
low
and
the
offshore
chinese
yuan
gained
percent
following
the
trade
talk
news
stock
futures
jumped
percent
the
news
of
the
trade
talks
triggered
but
i
think
fundamentally
it
is
of
limited
significance
said
yasuo
sakuma
chief
investment
officer
at
libra
investments
he
said
turkey
s
market
swings
reflect
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
more
vulnerable
parts
of
the
global
economy
at
this
stage
in
the
interest
rate
cycle
as
the
federal
reserve
seeks
to
normalise
monetary
policy
however
sakuma
noted
there
were
arguably
larger
risks
for
investors
such
as
the
weak
earnings
from
tencent
holdings
the
chinese
tech
giant
reported
its
first
quarterly
profit
fall
in
nearly
years
on
weak
gaming
revenue
it
holds
a
percent
stake
in
the
firm
that
makes
cult
game
fortnite
while
that
may
be
booming
china
s
regulator
this
week
has
signalled
it
is
clamping
down
on
some
of
these
types
of
games
that
had
knocked
other
asian
tech
firms
with
south
korea
s
samsung
electronics
asia
s
third
largest
firm
by
market
capitalisation
down
to
a
low
back
in
europe
italy
s
stock
market
sank
percent
to
its
lowest
level
since
april
as
motorway
operator
atlantia
fell
percent
the
italian
government
said
it
could
be
heavily
fined
or
stripped
of
its
contracts
following
the
deadly
collapse
of
a
bridge
in
genoa
though
metals
strengthened
oil
prices
were
also
left
flat
after
data
showed
a
surprise
weekly
increase
in
crude
stockpiles
compounding
worries
about
a
weaker
global
economic
growth
brent
was
at
just
over
a
barrel
and
crude
oil
last
stood
at
having
fallen
to
lows
of
following
wednesday
s

the

appetite
also
saw

on
german
bunds
and

regarded
as
safe
investments
in
times
of

up
the
