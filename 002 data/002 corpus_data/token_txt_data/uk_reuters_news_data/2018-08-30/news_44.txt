rpt-focus-inside albemarle's quest to reinvent the lithium market
repeats

aug
reuters
as
global
demand
for
lithium
hits
overdrive
albemarle
corp
is
investing
millions
of
dollars
to
engineer
specialized
types
of
the
light
metal
for
electric
car
batteries
part
of
a
strategy
to
remain
the
niche
market
s
top
producer
the
pivot
comes
as
battery
makers
such
as
panasonic
corp
the
sole
battery
supplier
to
tesla
inc
increasingly
demand
more
purified
versions
of
lithium
that
can
help
boost
electricity
storage
and
increase
a
battery
s
charge
shaping
albemarle
s
strategy
according
to
sources
and
documents
reviewed
by
reuters
and
confirmed
by
the
company
once
used
primarily
as
a
pharmacological
treatment
for
bipolar
disorder
lithium
has
become
one
of
the
world
s
most
commodities
thanks
to
the
rising
popularity
of
electric
vehicles
powered
by
batteries
roughly
electric
vehicles
were
sold
globally
in
a
figure
that
is
expected
to
jump
sevenfold
by
according
to
estimates
from
the
energy
information
administration
albemarle
s
strategy
which
includes
developing
a
battery
research
center
near
its
north
carolina
headquarters
is
aimed
at
setting
it
apart
from
its
major
competitors
including
chile
s
sqm
and
china
s
tianqi
lithium
corp
albemarle
has
historically
sold
basic
types
of
lithium
under
contracts
much
like
rivals
now
the
company
is
diverging
from
rivals
and
developing
dozens
of
lithium
products
that
can
help
boost
electricity
storage
and
increase
a
battery
s
charge
what
we
are
doing
is
not
a
moonshot
but
rather
just
good
engineering
albemarle
s
lithium
unit
head
eric
norris
said
at
a
private
dinner
earlier
this
summer
attended
by
state
street
global
advisors
goldman
sachs
group
inc
and
other
top
shareholders
according
to
two
sources
as
more
lithium
production
comes
online
in
the
americas
and
asia
concerns
about
oversupply
are
high
making
a
push
into
specialized
lithium
a
crucial
step
for
albemarle
lithium
is
much
more
a
specialty
chemical
than
a
mined
product
said
joe
lowry
an
independent
lithium
industry
consultant
it
s
definitely
not
a
commodity
because
it
s
not
a
fungible
albemarle
is
now
trying
to
use
its
technical
and
clout
to
forge
customer
partnerships
that
it
hopes
guarantee
profit
for
decades
if
every
new
lithium
project
that
s
been
announced
does
come
online
that
could
cause
market
oversupply
said
deutsche
bank
mining
analyst
chris
terry
there
s
a
lot
of
bearishness
in
the
market
and
differentiation
is
the
key
to
by
treating
the
metal
with
various
chemicals
and
other
processing
steps
lithium
s
chemical
structure
can
be
rearranged
to
boost
electricity
storage
and
increase
charge
which
albemarle
hopes
will
make
it
even
more
indispensable
to
battery
makers
and
the
electric
car
industry
norris
told
the
investor
dinner
battery
requirements
are
becoming
more
stringent
and
there
is
a
definitive
move
towards
higher
energy
density
batteries
albemarle
spokeswoman
hailey
cobb
said
longer
term
albemarle
is
studying
solid
state
batteries
which
contains
no
liquid
and
theoretically
can
store
more
electricity
than
the
lithium
ion
battery
norris
told
investors
while
batteries
are
not
expected
to
replace
lithium
ion
batteries
as
the
industry
standard
they
are
seen
as
a
promising
technological
evolution
and
importantly
for
albemarle
they
will
consume
even
more
lithium
so
far
wall
street
is
rooting
for
albemarle
s
success
seventeen
of
the
analysts
that
cover
the
stock
recommend
buying
it
as
an
average
that
same
group
thinks
the
stock
should
be
trading
percent
above
current
levels
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
albemarle
agrees
and
earlier
this
month
said
it
would
double
its
stock
buyback
for
the
year
to
million
the
global
lithium
business
is
dominated
by
albemarle
sqm
tianqi
and
fmc
corp
which
is
spinning
off
its
lithium
division
this
fall
as
a
publicly
traded
company
sqm
has
stated
publicly
a
goal
of
supplanting
albemarle
as
the
world
s
biggest
lithium
producer
by
the
next
decade
which
albemarle
says
is
not
a
concern
we
are
not
interested
in
being
the
largest
we
are
concerned
about
meeting
the
needs
of
our
customers
and
being
the
most
profitable
lithium
company
in
the
world
said
hobb
but
some
on
wall
street
are
spooked
with
shares
of
albemarle
down
percent
this
year
lithium
has
become
the
centerpiece
for
the
future
of
the
company
said
chip
skinner
a
portfolio
manager
with
the
royce
funds
which
holds
albemarle
shares
but
supply
and
demand
still
to
help
retain
its
crown
the
company
is
moving
customers
toward
contracts
of
a
decade
or
more
far
longer
than
the
to
contracts
it
currently
signs
the
contracts
have
an
option
to
reset
pricing
every
year
in
contrast
to
sqm
which
favors
shorter
contracts
and
typically
charges
spot
market
prices
albemarle
also
poached
former
general
electric
co
battery
scientist
glen
merfeld
this
spring
and
is
hiring
deputies
for
merfeld
to
help
oversee
the
new
battery
center
norris
told
large
investors
that
the
shift
to
contracts
which
would
have
a
base
price
guaranteed
could
be
as
long
as
a
decade
or
more
in
some
cases
and
secure
albemarle
s
percent
profit
margins
regardless
of
market
forces
lithium
is
a
business
and
albemarle
is
betting
that
brings
it
success
