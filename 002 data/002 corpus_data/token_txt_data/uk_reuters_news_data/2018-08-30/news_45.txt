china's solar subsidy cuts erode the impact of trump tariffs
los
angeles
reuters
a
move
by
china
to
slash
subsidies
for
domestic
solar
installations
has
unleashed
a
flood
of
panels
onto
the
global
market
pushing
down
prices
and
eroding
the
impact
of
president
donald
trump
s
tariff
on
solar
equipment
imports
according
to
industry
officials
that
s
good
news
for
companies
that
purchase
and
install
imported
solar
panels
including
inovateus
solar
and
pine
gate
renewables
which
had
expected
that
the
protectionist
policy
would
raise
their
costs
and
slow
their
business
the
falling
prices
however
will
hurt
panel
manufacturers
including
china
s
jinko
solar
and
korea
s
hanwha
q
cells
which
had
announced
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
solar
manufacturing
investments
in
the
expectation
that
tariffs
would
boost
their
profits
trump
announced
a
levy
on
all
imported
solar
panels
in
january
his
opening
salvo
in
an
escalating
global
trade
war
that
he
says
is
aimed
at
helping
manufacturers
and
other
businesses
rebound
from
years
of
decline
critics
say
the
tariffs
could
backfire
by
hurting
other
domestic
industries
that
depend
on
imports
the
prospect
of
solar
tariffs
initially
sent
panel
prices
soaring
making
domestic
manufacturing
more
profitable
and
drawing
a
handful
of
new
investments
but
the
tax
on
imports
cooled
the
pace
of
solar
installations
by
raising
panel
costs
the
solar
industry
employs
more
than
people
with
about
percent
of
those
people
in
installation
and
percent
in
manufacturing
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
the
solar
panel
market
shifted
in
june
after
china
the
world
s
top
solar
installer
and
a
major
critic
of
the
trump
tariff
announced
a
plan
to
cut
the
amount
of
installed
solar
capacity
this
year
nearly
in
half
by
cutting
subsidies
for
such
projects
while
the
move
could
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
trump
s
tariffs
on
panels
china
s
national
development
and
reform
commission
has
said
the
subsidy
cuts
were
motivated
mainly
by
domestic
concerns
about
the
industry
s
rapid
growth
surging
solar
capacity
has
left
china
struggling
to
build
sufficient
transmission
infrastructure
to
link
projects
to
the
electrical
grid
and
the
finance
ministry
has
scrambled
to
find
billions
of
yuan
in
subsidies
owed
to
new
projects
the
subsidy
reductions
forced
chinese
panel
makers
to
find
new
buyers
on
the
export
market
the
increased
global
supply
has
driven
down
the
cost
of
buying
a
panel
in
the
united
states
to
about
cents
a
watt
from
cents
shortly
after
the
tariff
according
to
pricing
data
from
wood
mackenzie
power
renewables
the
research
firm
said
prices
could
fall
to
about
cents
by
the
end
of
less
than
they
were
before
the
administration
began
considering
a
tariff
in
it

a

project
developer
founded
in
that
has
plans
to
purchase
large
volumes
of
panels
starting
in
the
unexpected
price
declines
are
eroding
the
effectiveness
of
the
tariff
in
boosting
manufacturing
profits
and
could
completely
offset
its
initial
market
impact

november

association
seia
a
trade
group
representing
both
solar
developers
and
panel
manufacturers
opposed
the
tariffs
as
a
net
loss
of
industry
jobs
and
revenue
the
falling
prices
mitigate
some
of
the
pain
but
still
amount
to
a
drag
on
growth
said
seia
spokesman
dan
whitten
it
may
be
less
bad
than
it
could
have
been
but
it
s
still
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
should
be
he
said
solar
developers
including
cyprus
creek
renewables
and
southern
current
told
reuters
earlier
this
year
that
the
higher
panel
prices
caused
by
the
tariff
had
forced
them
to
cancel
or
freeze
plans
for
more
than
billion
in
projects
a
figure
that
topped
new
investments
announced
by
manufacturing
firms
that
benefitted
from
the
tariffs
many
installers
are
now
feeling
more
optimistic
south
bend
inovateus
solar
for
example
said
lower
panel
prices
had
helped
it
close
a
deal
in
june
to
develop
a
megawatt
system
for
the
city
of
pratt
kansas
and
to
revive
hiring
plans
the
drop
in
panel
prices
has
really
helped
stimulate
more
activity
inovateus
tj
kanczuzewski
said
in
an
interview
the
lower
prices
have
also
helped
the
economics
of
projects
already
in
the
pipeline
especially
those
with
marginal
prospects
for
a
payoff
said
ben
catt
chief
development
officer
of
charlotte

renewables
cypress
creek
said
the
decline
has
yet
to
resuscitate
its
shelved
projects
for
but
the
company
said
it
expects
panel
prices
to
keep
falling
potentially
helping
projects
next
year
ramping
construction
up
and
down
is
not
something
that
happens
overnight
said

strange
southern
current
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
colin
smith
an
analyst
for
wood
mackenzie
power
renewables
said
he
expects
the
solar
market
to
expand
between
and
because
of
the
falling
price
of
panels
instead
of
remaining
flat
as
the
firm
had
forecast
earlier
this
year
the
market
has
become
comfortable
again
smith
said
panel
manufacturers
that
announced
expansions
in
response
to
the
tariffs
including
china
s
jinko
solar
sunpower
corp
and
canada
s
heliene
said
they
still
planned
to
move
forward
with
planned
investments
but
the
falling
prices
are
forcing
them
to
operate
at
a
lower
margin
they
said
to
compete
against
foreign
rivals
who
benefit
from
lower
labor
and
material
costs
it
makes
domestic
manufacturing
that
much
more
challenging
sunpower
chief
executive
tom
werner
said
in
an
interview
sunpower
earlier
this
year
agreed
to
take
over
the
oregon
factory
of
troubled
solarworld
americas
one
of
the
companies
that
sought
the
tariffs
the
deal
is
expected
to
close
before
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
sunpower
said
the
facility
is
capable
of
producing
nearly
a
gigawatt
of
solar
cells
and
modules
a
year
or
enough
energy
to
power
about
homes
jinko
s
investor
relations
director
sebastian
liu
called
the
price
collapse
a
normal
fluctuation
and
said
the
firm
was
making
reasonable
margins
thanks
to
a
focus
on
higher
efficiency
products
and
lower
costs
for
polysilicon
solar
s
key
raw
material
he
said
jinko
will
begin
producing
panels
at
a
facility
in
florida
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
heliene
president
martin
pochtaruk
said
his
company
had
weathered
such
price
drops
before
and
would
do
so
again
as
it
works
toward
opening
its
minnesota
factory
next
month
heliene
took
over
the
facility
in
may
of
and
has
invested
million
to
get
it
up
and
running
the
company
expects
to
produce
mw
of
panels
there
a
year
heliene
said
it
would
focus
on
cost
cuts
to
compensate
for
falling
prices
it
is
of
course
stressing
pochtaruk
said
of
the
sudden
market
shift
but
also
business
as
usual
in
a
volatile
sector
