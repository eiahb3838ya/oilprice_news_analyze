will
delay
submitting
a
plan
for
development
of
its
block
off
ghana
until
early

to
allow
time
to
complete
appraisal
drilling
expected
to
start
in

its

said
on
thursday
the
unlisted
firm
controlled
by
norwegian
billionaire
kjell
inge
roekke
bought
a
stake
in
ghana
s
deepwater
tano
cape
three
points
block
from
hess
for
million
in
february
aker
had
initially
intended
to
summit
a
development
plan
in
the
second
half
of
but
has
since
changed
its
mind
the
forecast
now
is
to
start
drilling
in
october
our
goal
is
to
identify
the
contact
to
update
the
reservoir
model
chief
executive
jan
arve
haugan
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
energy
conference
aker
energy
plans
to
make
a
final
investment
decision
and
to
submit
a
field
development
plan
to
ghanaian
authorities
early
next
year
with
production
seen
starting
in
or
early
haugan
said
the
plan
involves
developing
around
million
barrels
of
oil
by
using
a
floating
production
storage
and
offloading
vessel
fpso
we
believe
that
we
should
be
able
to
increase
the
volumes
further
but
that
depends
on
the
recovery
rate
and
on
the
possibility
to
tie
in
nearby
discoveries
haugan
said
the
volumes
in
place
are
estimated
to
be
more
than
a
billion
barrels
he
added
the
company
has
signed
a
letter
of
intent
to
use
maersk
drilling
s
maersk
viking
drillship
which
was
previously
employed
by
exxon
mobil
and
is
currently
located
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
haugan
said
executives
of
aker
which
has
a
percent
stake
in
aker
energy
have
previously
compared
the
ghanaian
field
to
norway
s
arctic
johan
castberg
field
in
terms
of
costs
norway
s
equinor
operator
of
johan
castberg
estimates
the
field
s
price
at
below
a
barrel
that
s
not
achievable
as
we
speak
but
we
are
working
hard
to
bring
down
the
costs
haugan
said
about
the
ghanaian
field
aker
energy
holds
percent
in
the
block
lukoil
has
percent
ghana
national
petroleum
corporation
percent
and
fuel
trade
percent
aker
energy
could
eventually
become
publicly
listed
but
there
are
no
firm
plans
to
do
so
