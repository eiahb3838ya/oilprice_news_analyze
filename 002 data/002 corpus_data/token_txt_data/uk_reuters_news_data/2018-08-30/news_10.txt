analysis-now you see it, now you don't: oil surplus vanishes ahead of iran deadline
london
reuters
an
overhang
of
homeless
crude
in
the
atlantic
basin
has
halved
in
recent
weeks
suggesting
oil
traders
are
bracing
for
a
further
supply
loss
from
iran
due
to
sanctions
and
a
new
rally
in
prices
iran
s
oil
exports
are
already
dropping
fast
as
refiners
scurry
to
find
alternatives
ahead
of
a
reimposition
of
sanctions
in
early
november
which
in
turn
has
helped
drain
a
glut
of
unsold
oil
the
millions
of
unsold
barrels
of
crude
that
had
pooled
around
northwest
europe
the
mediterranean
and
west
africa
over
july
and
august
are
rapidly
draining
a
surplus
in
the
west
african
market
that
depressed
prices
to
their
lowest
in
months
has
almost
vanished
traders
had
said
just
one
week
ago
that
leftover
crude
from
the
august
and
september
loading
schedules
amounted
to
some
cargoes
equivalent
to
an
average
barrels
per
day
bpd
now
that
overhang
has
dwindled
to
a
handful
of
unsold
cargoes
while
demand
for
angolan
oil
the
favored
west
african
grades
for
chinese
refiners
has
been
even
more
robust
than
that
for
september
the
overall
situation
is
that
sanctions
toward
iran
are
now
increasingly
kicking
in
which
will
help
to
dry
up
the
physical
crude
oil
market
and
place
it
back
into
solid
backwardation

this
week
this
will
shift

oil
price
into
the
higher

the
belief
that
supply
will
fall
short
of
demand
is
reflected
in
the
futures
market
when
the
price
of
a
contract
rises
above
that
of
a
one
a
situation
known
as
backwardation
with
a
little
over
nine
weeks
until
possibly
more
than

off

brent

are
now
at
their
closest
to

in
almost
a

leaving

nearly
half
what
it
was
in
late
july
concern
over
oil

particularly
in
china
has
been
put
to
rest
for
now
at

consumption
by
china

independent
refiners

has
picked
up
sharply
in
august
to
around

in

from
prolonged

shipments
of

generally
have
hit
record
highs
of

in
august
thanks
in
large
part
to
indian
demand
while

appetite
for
crudes

pushed
the
price
of
russian

to
its
highest
in
nine
months
looking
at
the
spreads
it
s
starting
to
appear
as
if
the
market
is
somewhat
tightening
the
west

has
disappeared
so
it
looks
as
though
that

output
in

strategist
warren
patterson
said
a
number
of
major
producers
including
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
boosting
output
after
having
agreed
to
cut
by
up
to
million
bpd
since
january
to
fill
any
gaps
in
supply
left
by
the
sanctions
and
prevent

in
europe
the
north
sea
market
is
still
suffering
from
a
surplus
of
crude
that
grew
so
large
earlier
in
august
that
traders
resorted
to
keeping
it
on
tankers

the
most
expensive

option

this

is
finally
shrinking
according
to
reuters
data
some
million
barrels
of
oil
are
still
in
floating
storage
around
northwest
europe
and
the

including
north

this
is
down

a

even
though
oil
supply
from
outside

may

continues

other

like
libya
and
nigeria
are
prone
to
disruption
add
to
that
years
of
underinvestment
as
a
result
of
an
oil

that
struggled
below
