it
s
been
a
long
time
coming
but
chinese
steel
prices
are
finally
showing
signs
of
running
out
of
steam
with
futures
having
dropped
for
six
straight
sessions
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
benchmark
rebar
contract
closed
at
yuan
a
tonne
on
wednesday
having
retreated
from
the
high
of
yuan
a
tonne
reached
on
the
recent
declines
point
to
an
increasing
between
still
robust
margins
for
steel
makers
and
the
likelihood
of
slowing
demand
growth
in
china
which
produces
about
half
of
the
world
s
steel
steel
futures
gained
about
percent
from
the
end
of
last
year
to
their
recent
peak
as
chinese
mills
enjoyed
some
of
the
strongest
profits
in
years
output
curbs
related
to
efforts
to
control
pollution
and
the
cutting
of
older
less
efficient
capacity
has
boosted
the
industry
s
fortunes
improving
profits
have
allowed
steel
mills
to
boost
production
by
employing
higher
grade
iron
ore
as
a
feedstock
which
has
the
added
benefit
of
requiring
less
coking
coal
per
unit
of
steel
produced
the
result
has
been
record
output
with
china
producing
a
fourth
straight
monthly
high
in
july
of
million
tonnes
according
to
official
statistics
output
to
grew
percent
compared
with
the
previous
year
to
million
tonnes
as
profit
margins
reached
around
yuan
a
tonne
according
to
analysts
from
huatai
futures
while
it
s
logical
to
expect
steel
mills
to
maximise
production
when
profit
margins
are
elevated
there
is
some
concern
as
to
where
all
the
steel
is
going
the
key
construction
sectors
appear
to
still
be
enjoying
strong
activity
but
perhaps
not
enough
to
justify
a
percent
increase
in
output
other
sectors
such
as
appliance
and
goods
manufacturing
and
car
making
are
in
a
similar
position
exports
of
steel
products
have
been
trending
lower
this
year
with
shipments
of
products
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
slipping
percent
to
million
tonnes
the
escalating
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
and
imposition
of
duties
by
other
countries
on
chinese
steel
means
exports
are
unlikely
to
return
to
growth
any
time
soon
visible
inventories
have
been
largely
steady
in
recent
weeks
but
are
still
well
down
on
levels
earlier
in
the
year
with
data
from
consultancy
steelhome
showing
rebar
stocks
at
million
tonnes
in
the
week
to
less
than
half
the
peak
in
early
march
with
mounting
concern
about
a
cooling
in
the
chinese
economy
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
the
risk
is
rising
that
steel
s
stellar
run
must
be
coming
to
an
end
this
should
also
have
a
desultory
effect
on
iron
ore
as
well
which
has
spent
the
past
five
months
trading
in
a
fairly
narrow
range
ore
with
a
percent
iron
content
the
main
benchmark
ended
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
according
to
prices
assessed
by
argus
media
this
means
the
ingredient
has
lost
about
percent
so
far
this
year
although
it
should
be
noted
that
higher
grade
ore
has
performed
better
argus
assessed
percent
iron
ore
at
a
tonne
on
wednesday
which
is
up
percent
so
far
this
year
iron
ore
has
also
declined
more
than
the
benchmark
with
consultancy
custeel
citing
percent
ore
from
india
at
a
price
of
yuan
a
tonne
on
wednesday
down
percent
from
the
end
of
last
year
the
outperformance
of
higher
grade
iron
ore
does
confirm
that
china
s
steel
mills
have
been
using
better
quality
ore
to
maximise
output
and
lower
emissions
but
it
is
also
the
case
that
they
have
still
been
importing
significant
volumes
of
lower
grade
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
shows
that
australia
which
supplies
mainly
percent
and
percent
iron
ore
has
managed
to
boost
its
share
of
china
s
imports
to
percent
for
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
compared
with
percent
for
the
same
period
in
in
contrast
suppliers
brazil
and
south
africa
both
lost
market
share
with
the
south
american
country
dropping
to
percent
from

slipping
