german
carmaker
volkswagen
said
only
half
of
its
vw
branded
passenger
car
models
in
germany
are
compliant
with
a
new
pollution
standard
thanks
to
a
much
tougher
emissions
testing
regime
cars
in
the
european
union
must
comply
with
the
new
worldwide
harmonised
light
vehicle
test
procedure
wltp
from
september
but
volkswagen
has
only
gained
regulatory
clearance
for
seven
of
its
main
model
lines
the
new
tests
are
more
cumbersome
and
take
two
to
three
times
longer
than
in
the
past
even
limited
edition
models
need
to
be
tested
separately

zahn
said
in
a
call
with
journalists
on
thursday
the
coming
months
will
be
challenging
for
us
said
zahn
head
of
sales
and
marketing
for
volkswagen
passenger
cars
volkswagen
s
golf
model
is
among
the
vehicles
still
waiting
to
be
cleared
by
authorities
zahn
said
he
said
he
expected
the
golf
to
pass
the
wltp
standards
by
the
end
of
september
shipments
of
cars
are
expected
to
slow
down
in
september
and
october
but
pick
up
again
in
the
final
two
months
of
the
year
we
expect
very
strong
deliveries
in
december
zahn
said
carmakers
including
daimler
volkswagen
and
supplier
valeo
have
cut
profit
expectations
blaming
a
slowdown
in
global
sales
triggered
in
part
by
delays
getting
vehicles
certified
to
the
new
standard
analysts
at
evercore
isi
said
the
wltp
delays
at
the
vw
brand
appear
to
be
under
control
since
the
carmaker
has
not
resorted
to
heavy
discounting
to
keep
sales
flowing
nonetheless
delays
will
cause
profitability
of
the
brand
to
drop
to
around
percent
in
the
third
quarter
from
percent
in
the
second
quarter
