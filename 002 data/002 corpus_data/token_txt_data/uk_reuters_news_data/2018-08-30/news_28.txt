maersk tankers tests wind power to fuel ships
copenhagen
reuters
maersk
tankers
is
testing
the
use
of
wind
power
to
fuel
its
ships
a
new
technology
it
says
can
cut
fuel
consumption
by
up
to
percent
and
help
the
industry
reduce
polluting
emissions
the
move
comes
as
the
global
shipping
industry
is
suffering
from
rising
oil
prices
and
preparing
for
fuel
costs
to
rise
further
by
around
a
quarter
or
some
billion
in
when
new
rules
limiting
sulfur
kick
in
the
company
has
installed
two
tall
metal
cylinders
on
board
the
maersk
pelican
a
long
range
product
tanker
vessel
the
cylinders
or
rotor
sails
work
as
mechanical
sails
that
spin
to
propel
the
vessel
forward
the
maersk
pelican
will
depart
rotterdam
on
thursday
for
a
test
journey
if
successful
maersk
tankers
which
shipping
giant
maersk
sold
last
year
to
its
controlling
shareholder
and
japan
s
mitsui
co
for
billion
plans
to
install
the
cylinders
on
half
its
vessels
the
company
did
not
specify
what
savings
could
amount
to
but
said
an
vessel
on
average
uses
around
tonnes
of
shipping
fuel
per
day
at
the
current
price
of
high
sulfur
fuel
of
around
per
ton
that
would
amount
to
yearly
savings
of
as
much
as
if
the
vessel
sails
days
a
year
the
change
in
regulations
in
forces
a
portion
of
the
world
s
fleet
to
switch
to
lower
sulfur
but
higher
cost
fuels
such
as
marine
gasoil
mgo
and
ultra
low
sulfur
fuel
oil
the
total
global
shipping
fuel
bill
is
roughly
billion
a
year
consultants

mackenzie
estimated
in
april
maersk
pelican
is
the
third
vessel
to
have
the
rotor
sail
technology
installed
norsepower
which
delivered
the
technology
first
installed
it
on
a
small
cargo
ship
in
and
on
a
ferry
sailing
between
sweden
and
finland
in
