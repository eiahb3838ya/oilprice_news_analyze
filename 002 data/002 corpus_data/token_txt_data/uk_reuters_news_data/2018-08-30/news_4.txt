a

at

in

there
are
pretty
good
tailwinds
here
that
will
keep
people
jumping
on
board
he
said
brent
s
wide
premium
to
wti
is
likely
to
encourage
exports
of
crude
keeping
inventories
lower
and
boosting
activity
following
weekly

data
he
said
brent
has
risen
by
almost
percent
over
the
past
two
weeks
on
widespread
perceptions
that
the
global
oil
market
is
tightening
and
could
run
short
in
the
next
few
months
as
sanctions
restrict
crude
exports
from

there
are
a

factors

at

in

in
addition
to
support
from
geopolitical
events
natural
disasters
could
impact
the

if
a
potential
storm
system
currently
off
the

of

strengthens
and

iranian
oil
export
declines
are
already
visible
well
in
advance
of
sanctions
which
enter
into
force
in
iranian
crude
exports
are
likely
to
drop
to
a
little
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
august
against
a
peak
of
million
bpd
in
april
as
importers
bow
to
american
pressure
to
cut
orders
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
in
which
iran
is
the
producer
will
discuss
in
december
whether
it
can
compensate
for
a
sudden
drop
in
iranian
supply
after
sanctions
start

the
international
energy
agency
iea
has
warned
of
a
tightening
market
toward
the
end
of
the

because
of
falling
supply
in
countries
such
as
iran
and
venezuela
combined
with
strong
demand
especially
in

definitely
there
are
some

the

resistance
for

in
