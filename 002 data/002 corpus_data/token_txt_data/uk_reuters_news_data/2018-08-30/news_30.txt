update 3-kenya's parliament approves retaining interest rate cap, against imf wishes
nairobi
reuters
the
kenyan
parliament
voted
on
thursday
to
retain
the
cap
on
commercial
interest
rates
which
the
international
monetary
fund
has
insisted
must
be
scrapped
or
modified
in
return
for
a
new
standby
arrangement
in
a
response
to
emailed
questions
jan
mikkelsen
the
imf
s
resident
representative
for
kenya
said
they
were
aware
of
the
passing
of
the
finance
bill
and
were
currently
assessing
the
implications
for
the
program
kenyan
lawmakers
also
voted
to
delay
a
proposed
percent
tax
on
petroleum
products
for
two
more
years
citing
the
high
cost
of
living
a
move
that
will
be
a
blow
to
government
efforts
to
raise
revenues
through
higher
taxes
the
rate
cap
introduced
in
september
was
aimed
at
helping
small
traders
access
capital
at
affordable
rates
but
has
had
the
opposite
effect
with
banks
saying
they
can
not
price
risk
to
small
and
medium
enterprises
smes
properly
while
the
cap
is
in
place
as
a
result
lending
to
the
private
sector
fell
from
percent
in
to
percent
last
year
many
thousands
of
kenyans
have
been
unable
to
access
bank
lending
and
have
turned
to
more
expensive
borrowing
said
aly
khan
satchu
a
independent
trader
and
analyst
president
uhuru
kenyatta
said
in
april
that
he
recognised
the
limitation
of
the
law
and
hoped
that
the
finance
bill
would
remove
the
cap
that
he
said
had
ended
up
hurting
the
financial
sector
the
legislation
still
needs
to
secure
presidential
assent
and
it
was
not
clear
what
line
kenyatta
would
now
take
the
president
will
have
to
crack
the
whip
and
hard
because
notwithstanding
some
bravado
chatter
it
would
not
make
sense
to
lose
the
support
of
the
imf
at
a
time
when
the
markets
are
so
skittish
and
our
ratio
is
nudging
percent
satchu
said
some
bank
stocks
at
the
nairobi
securities
exchange
edged
lower
on
thursday
after
the
bill
was
passed
it
was
not
widely
expected
people
were
banking
on
repeal
of
the
interest
cap

africa
it
s
still
a
buy
the
current
is
temporary
mostly
it
s
the
foreign

who
are
heavy
on
that

who
are

minister
henry
rotich
proposed
repealing
the
interest
rate
cap
a
move
cheered
by
bankers
but
lawmakers
have
continued
to
insist
they
are
not
ready
to
remove
the
upper
limit
of
commercial
lending
rates
at
percentage
points
above
the
central
bank
rate
lawmakers
did
however
remove
the
minimum
deposit
rate
of
percent
of
the
central
bank
rate
the
imf
has
demanded
the
cap
be
repealed
as
a
condition
for
kenya
to
access
its
balance
of
payments
support
kenya
secured
a
extension
for
its
credit
arrangement
of
million
from
the
fund
in
march
and
is
seeking
another
extension
when
it
expires
in
jibran
qureishi
an
economist
for
east
africa
at
stanbic
bank
said
the
decision
threw
open
the
question
of
how
discussions
with
the
imf
would
now
proceed
on
the
imf
with
the
vat
on
fuel
being
postponed
with
most
of
the
tax
measures
not
approved
this
means
the
fiscal
deficit
is
likely
to
remain
higher
than
projected
qureishi
said
the
odds
of
the
imf
facility
being
retained
are
quite
slim
but
we
have
to
see
what
will
kenya
s
legislature
also
rejected
a
robin

tax
of
percent
on
bank
transfers
of
over
shillings
during
thursday
s
session
and
an
employee
contribution
scheme
towards
the
national
housing
development
fund
the
rejected

were
designed
to

goals
including
universal
