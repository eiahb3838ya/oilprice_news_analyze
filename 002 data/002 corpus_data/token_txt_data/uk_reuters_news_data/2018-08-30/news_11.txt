refile-analysis-savvy european utilities shield themselves from higher carbon costs
reuters
the
surging
costs
of
carbon
permits
have
caused
some
of
europe
s
biggest
utilities
to
lock
in
purchases
in
advance
while
nuclear
and
hydro
firms
are
benefiting
from
the
effect
on
power
prices
carbon
permits
traded
under
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
ets
have
become
the
best
performing
commodity
this
year
almost
trebling
in
price
to
over
euros
pounds
a
tonne
since
january
on
the
back
of
stronger
energy
prices
and
measures
to
reduce
supply
the
ets
which
charges
power
plants
and
factories
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
has
suffered
from
excess
supply
since
the
financial
crisis
which
dragged
prices
down
to
lows
of
euros
a
tonne
now
at
highs
stronger
carbon
prices
make
it
more
expensive
for
european
utilities
to
burn
fossil
fuels
encouraging
a
shift
to
cleaner
energy
sources
prices
are
expected
to
keep
rising
according
to
a
reuters
survey
of
analysts
last
month
market
participants
can
hedge
their
exposure
to
rising
prices
by
buying
enough
carbon
permits
when
the
price
is
low
to
cover
their
future
emissions
output
if
they
have
a
surplus
they
can
sell
them
back
to
the
market
and
make
a
profit
when
the
price
rises
if
they
don
t
have
enough
they
would
have
to
buy
more
at
a
higher
price
higher
carbon
prices
mean
higher
costs
for
all
european
utilities
unless
of
course
they
hedged
or
stockpiled
allowances
said
french
energy
consultant
hibault
laconde
one
such
company
is
german
generator
rwe
which
said
it
had
protected
itself
against
power
price
volatility
by
selling
fuels
as
opposed
to
selling
power
production
and
simultaneously
buying
enough
emissions
permits
our
position
is
already
financially
hedged
until
the
end
of
and
we
have
also
taken
steps
beyond
chief
financial
officer
markus
krebber
said
during
recent
earnings
calls
with
analysts
coal
plants
have
benefited
for
years
from
low
carbon
prices
which
kept
operational
costs
down
many
old
german
coal
plants
could
be
operated
at
low
overheads
and
they
were
the
price
setters
in
the
wholesale
market
for
thermal
generation
rwe
s
hedging
strategy
involves
nuclear
and
brown
power
being
sold
usually
up
to
three
years
in
advance
and
hard
coal
and
ones
closer
to
production
rival
uniper
said
it
sold
the
bulk
of
its
hydroelectric
output
next
year
the
rise
in
carbon
prices
will
force
inefficient
coal
plants
out
of
the
market
chief
financial
officer
christopher
delbrueck
said
this
week
aurora
energy
research
said
german
producers
of
coal
from
lignite
a
heavily
polluting
brown
coal
such
as
leag
eph
and
rwe
had
reason
to
worry
the
carbon
price
rise
to
euros
from
euros
a
year
ago
could
have
produced
additional
costs
of
billion
euros
according
to
aurora
analyst
hanns
koenig
in
poland
the
country
s
four
major
state
producers
are
historically
heavily
exposed
to
coal
generation
tauron
s
chief
executive
has
called
the
eu
carbon
price
a
tax
this
is
not
a
comfortable
situation
for
us
because
of
the
policy
energy
could
become
a
luxury
good
he
was
quoted
as
saying
by
state
news
agency
pap
at
the
weekend
for
companies
producing
electricity
from
nuclear
and
hydroelectric
plants
higher
carbon
prices
are
welcomed
the
wholesale
price
of
power
reflects
the
cost
of
buying
carbon
permits
and
fuels
coal
and
gas
prices
have
risen
this
year
due
to
chinese
demand
a
cold
winter
and
a
heatwave
across
europe
the
benchmark
german
power
price
is
at
a
year
high
france
s
edf
which
has
a
generation
fleet
made
up
of
percent
nuclear
and
percent
renewables
should
produce
more
competitive
electricity
in
interconnected
european
markets
the
higher
prices
are
a
huge
jackpot
for
edf
as
they
drive
up
wholesale
power
market
prices
this
is
the
case
for
all
nuclear
and
hydro
power
producers
said
nicolas
goldberg
energy
specialist
at
colombus
consulting
a
spokesman
for
swedish
utility
vattenfall
said
price
rises
supported
its
strategy
of
becoming
less
reliant
on
fossil
fuels
if
current
price
developments
continue
we
expect
a
gradual
decrease
in
profitability
of
assets
however
our
diversified
portfolio
with
a
significant
combined
heat
and
power
share
is
rather
robust
to
such
developments
he
added
germany
s
uniper
which
has
inherited
the
thermal
and
hydro
plants
of
former
parent
said
it
had
factored
in
significant
price
increases
for
carbon
coal
and
power
in
the
coming
years
that
will
give
our
earnings
a
boost
from
cfo
delbrueck
said
germany
s
is
focussing
on
power
grids
and
retail
activities
and
is
left
with
nuclear
power
production
only
in
germany
and
sweden
where
it
also
operates
hydropower
czech
nuclear
coal
and
renewable
generator
cez
has
sold
over
percent
of
its
expected
output
benefiting
from
a
higher
share
of
nuclear
than
pure
coal
generators
some
analysts
say
a
carbon
price
around
euros
could
encourage
more
utilities
to
switch
to
lower
carbon
fuels
power
generation
becomes
more
competitive
at
a
carbon
price
of
round
euros
a
tonne
however
margins
for
plants
are
still
mostly
negative
despite
a
cleaner
carbon
record
as
high
oil
and
gas
prices
mean
high
purchasing
costs
for
generators
coal
uniper
s
delbrueck
said
it
should
be
closer
to
euros
to
get
a
stronger
fuel
switch
