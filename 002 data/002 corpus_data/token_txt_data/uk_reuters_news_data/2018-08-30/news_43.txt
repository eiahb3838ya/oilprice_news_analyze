stock
market
gains
came
to
a
grinding
halt
on
thursday
held
back
by
concern
that
china
will
be
left
behind
as
the
united
states
nears
trade
agreements
with
other
north
american
countries
and
europe
stock
markets
and
major
government
bond
yields
rose
in
recent
weeks
on
hopes
that
a
global
trade
war
could
be
averted
particularly
with
the
leaders
of
the
united
states
and
canada
optimistic
they
could
reach
a
new
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
by
friday
but
with
tariffs
beginning
to
hurt
the
chinese
economy
asian
stocks
lost
some
of
their
gains
and
european
shares
followed
suit
on
thursday
on
concerns
over
trade
relations
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
craig
erlam
a
senior
market
analyst
at
fx
broker
oanda
said
there
s
a
sense
of
urgency
on
nafta
talks
as
the
countries
try
to
complete
the
deal
before
a
new
mexican
government
takes
control
and
ahead
of
a
vote
in
the
united
states
it
doesn
t
mean
the
will
look
for
a
quick
solution
with
china
he
said
there
s
still
a
long
way
to
run
with
these
trade
situations
and
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
we
see
more
tariffs
on
more
goods
before
it
gets
a
reuters
poll
showed
activity
among
china
s
manufacturers
probably
slowed
for
the
third
straight
month
in
august
this
pushed
the
shanghai
composite
index
down
percent
and
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
percent
and
in
turn
hit
european
stocks
on
worries
that
reduced
chinese
demand
would
hurt
exporters
a
stock
index
dropped
percent
on
thursday
dragging
the
msci

equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in

off
a

overnight
investors
are
relatively
pessimistic
and
cautious
for
now
amid
low
levels
of
trading
volume
as
there
are
still
concerns
over
the
development
of
the

spat

on
another

next

positive
signals
from
london
and
brussels
over
the
trade
component
of
eu
divorce
talks
drove
sterling
higher
against
the
euro
on
thursday
though
the
risk
of
a
brexit
kept
the
british
currency
well
off
its
highs
the
gains
came
as
european
union
negotiator
michel
barnier
signalled
an
more
accommodative
stance
towards
london
in
ongoing
talks
it
is
a
slight
change
in
tone
from
barnier
and
a
sign
that
the
eu
is
very
aware
of
the
brexit
deadline
and
they
don
t
want
a
brexit
any
more
than
we
do
said
erlam
of

another
emerging

the

after

turkey
earlier
in
