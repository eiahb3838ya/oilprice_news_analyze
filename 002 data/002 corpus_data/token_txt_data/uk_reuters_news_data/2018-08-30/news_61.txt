update 2-australia's east coast drought to intensify as dry weather to linger for months
sydney
reuters
australia
s
east
coast
will
experience
dry
weather
for
at
least
the
next
three
months
the
country
s
meteorological
bureau
said
on
thursday
intensifying
a
drought
that
has
wilted
crops
and
left
farmers
struggling
to
stay
in
business
in
its
latest
outlook
the
bureau
of
meteorology
said
there
was
only
a
percent
chance
rainfall
would
exceed
average
levels
over
much
of
the
country
s
east
coast
during
spring
which
runs
from
september
to
november
if
the
drought
gets
worse
australia
s
agricultural
sector
will
suffer
further
crop
losses
while
farmers
will
also
be
forced
to
slaughter
livestock
in
greater
numbers
as
they
struggle
to
find
enough
food
or
water
to
keep
them
alive
the
bureau
also
raised
the
prospect
of
dry
weather
in
the
country
s
west
which
has
so
far
escaped
drought
conditions
bringing
new
concerns
for
australian
food
manufacturers
unable
to
source
enough
grain
from
the
east
coast
some
food
producers
have
started
to
import
supplies
from
western
australia
where
recent
favorable
weather
had
encouraged
farmers
to
sell
leftover
supplies
but
the
bureau
said
the
west
coast
the
country
s
largest
agricultural
producing
region
will
also
experience
drier
than
average
weather
over
the
next
three
months
tightening
national
supply
yet
further
east
coast
farmers
have
largely
written
off
wheat
crops
this
year
but
the
issue
could
be
the
situation
in
the
west
said
phin
ziebell
agribusiness
economist
national
australia
bank
some
had
been
calling
for
a
crop
in
excess
of
million
tonnes
in
western
australia
but
if
the
forecast
materializes
the
figure
will
be
under
production
of
wheat
from
the
world
s
exporter
is
already
expected
to
hit
a
decade
low
this
year
although
output
from
the
west
is
expected
to
cushion
the
decline
in
the
east
the
bureau
also
said
it
saw
a
percent
chance
of
an
el
nino
weather
event
which
can
bring
warmer
weather
and
dry
conditions
to
australia
and
could
extend
the
dry
weather
into
an
el
nino
basically
means
that
as
we
get
into
summer
there
d
be
less
chance
of
having
those
recovery
rains
that
we
need
and
we
may
have
to
wait
till
autumn
in
to
start
seeing
some
recovery
rains
in
the
drought
areas
