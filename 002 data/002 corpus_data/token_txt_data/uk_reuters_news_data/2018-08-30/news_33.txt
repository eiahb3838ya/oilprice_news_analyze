which

with

through
the

statnett
told

nyhamna
is
one
of
norway
s
biggest
gas
processing
plants
requiring
a
stable
and
plentiful
supply
of
electricity
power
supply
has
been
a
recurrent
problem
and
the
plant
has
had
to
shut
down
production
due
to
outages
in
recent
years
sometimes
affecting
gas
supply
to
britain
the
processing
capacity
of
the
plant
which
handles
gas
from
norway
s
ormen
lange
field
will
be
raised
to
million
cubic
meters
mcm
per
day
by
october
to
start
accommodating
output
from
the
aasta
hansteen
field
the
plant
is
connected
only
by
a
single
transmission
line
to
norway
s
grid
and
processing
more
gas
will
only
add
to
concerns
about
the
fragility
of
its
power
link
operator
gassco
and
the
country
s
grid
statnett
have
negotiated
for
years
about
how
to
reinforce
the
power
supply
to
nyhamna
and
more
importantly
who
will
pay
for
it
without
results
so
far
they
gassco
are
considering
a
cooperation
with
local
industries
to
have
reserves
as
a
measure
statnett
s
chief
financial
officer
knut
hundhammer
told
reuters
statnett
had
earlier
expressed
concerns
over
the
security
of
supply
to
nyhamna
which
it
described
as
below
the
desired
level
in
the
risk
segment
of
its
report
some
industries
are
much
more
flexible
than
nyhamna
and
they
can
provide
capacity
to
the
plant
if
needed
hundhammer
said
declining
to
name
the
companies
cooperation
with
local
industry
would
give
nyhamna
a
fallback
option
if
power
to
the
plant
was
cut
or
reduced
hundhammer
said
the
industries
that
may
supply
nyhamna
in
case
of
need
get
their
supply
from
other
power
lines
so
their
electricity
flow
would
not
be
disrupted
if
nyhamna
s
link
suffered
an
outage
a
gassco
spokeswoman
said
different
measures
were
being
considered
and
costs
and
usefulness
were
always
part
of
those
assessments
at
nyhamna
gassco
is
seeking
opportunities
in
reinforcements
in
the
regional
grid
as
well
as
other
measures
she
said
the
nyhamna
plant
sits
on
an
island
near
the
mainland
town
of
molde
with
local
businesses
including
furniture
makers
oil
services
companies
producers
of
building
materials
and
auto
parts
firms
some
distance
further
away

spokesman
said
that
even
though
the
firm
hasn
t
been
approached
cooperation
on
power
security
was
feasible
security
of
power
supply
is
important
for
both
our
plant
and
nyhamna
we
could
find
a
solution
that
is
mutually
beneficial
he
said
statnett
and
gassco
were
still
working
on
options
to
enhance
power
supply
at
nyhamna
for
the
but
hundhammer
declined
to
elaborate
on
when
that
would
be
and
how
much
it
would
cost
as
the
negotiations
are
ongoing
