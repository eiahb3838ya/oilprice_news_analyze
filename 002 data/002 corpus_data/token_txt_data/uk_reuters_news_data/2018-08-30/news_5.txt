said
iran
could
do
more
to
cooperate
with

and
thereby
enhance

saying
the
islamic

had
given
it
cause
for
concern
thursday
s
report
to
member
states
seen
by
reuters
contained
similar
language
it
said
the
nuclear
watchdog
was
able
to
carry
out
all
complementary
access
inspections
needed
to
verify
iran
s
compliance
with
the

timely
and
proactive
cooperation
by
iran

whatsoever
a
senior
diplomat
added
with
the
united
states
reimposing
its
sanctions
on
iran
that
were
lifted
under
the
nuclear
deal
many
diplomats
and
analysts
now
doubt
that
the
accord
will
survive
despite
european
union
efforts
to
counter
some
of
the
effects
of
trump
s
move
sticking
to
the
nuclear
accord
is
not
the
only
way
forward
for
iran
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
said
on
thursday
being
the
party
to
still
honour
the
deal
in
deeds
not
just
words
is
not
iran
s
only
option
he
said
on
twitter
speaking
after
the
iaea
report
was
sent
to
the
agency
s
member
states
french
foreign
minister
le
drian
said
the
deal
was
still
holding
despite
the
withdrawal
he
urged
his
fellow
ministers
who
met
in
vienna
on
thursday
to
discuss
eu
policy
on
iran
to
do
more
to
protect
tehran
from
sanctions
calling
for
permanent
financial
mechanisms
that
allow
iran
to
continue
to
trade
the
eu
implemented
a
law
this
month
to
shield
european
companies
from
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
tehran
and
has
approved
aid
for
the
iranian
private
sector
although
large
european
companies
are
pulling
out
of
iran
adhering
to
the
deal
should
bring
iran
economic
benefits
zarif
said
if
preserving
the
jcpoa
the
deal
is
the
goal
then
there
is
no
escape
from
mustering
the
courage
to
comply
with
commitment
to
normalize
iran
s
economic
relations
instead
of
making
extraneous
demands
zarif
wrote
on
twitter
on
wednesday
iranian
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
cast
doubt
on
the
ability
of
eu
countries
to
save
the
agreement
and
said
tehran
might
abandon
it
khamenei
told
president
hassan
rouhani
not
to
rely
too
much
on
european
support
as
he
came
under
increased
pressure
at
home
over
his
handling
of
the
economy
in
the
face
of
sanctions
with
key
ministers
under
attack
by
parliament
le
drian
whose
country
signed
the
iran
deal
along
with
britain
germany
china
russia
and
the
united
states
under
barack
obama
said
tehran
should
be
ready
to
negotiate
on
its
future
nuclear
plans
its
ballistic
missile
arsenal
and
its
role
in
wars
in
syria
and
yemen
those
issues
were
not
covered
by
the
deal
and
trump
has
cited
this
as
a
major
reason
for
pulling
washington
out
of
it
le
drian
said
iran
which
says
its
missiles
are
only
for
defence
was
arming
regional
allies
with
rockets
and
allowing
ballistic
proliferation
adding
iran
needs
to
avoid
the
temptation
to
be
the
regional
iran
has
ruled
out
negotiations
on
its
ballistic
missiles
and
broader
middle
eastern
role
