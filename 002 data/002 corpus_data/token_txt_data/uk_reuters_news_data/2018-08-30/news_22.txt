winnipeg

reuters
a
canadian
court
on
thursday
overturned
approval
of
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
expansion
ruling
that
ottawa
failed
to
adequately
consider
aboriginal
concerns
in
a
blow
to
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
efforts
to
balance
environmental
and
economic
issues
trudeau
s
government
agreed
in
may
to
buy
the
pipeline
from
kinder
morgan
canada
ltd
for
c
billion
billion
betting
it
would
win
the
court
battle
and
expand
trans
mountain
despite
fierce
political
and
environmental
opposition
the
decision
also
hurts
canada
s
oil
producers
who
say
the
expanded
pipeline
is
needed
to
address
bottlenecks
that
have
sharply
reduced
prices
for
their
crude
shares
fell
on
the
decision
the
federal
court
of
appeal
ruled
that
the
national
energy
board
neb
regulator
wrongly
narrowed
its
review
of
the
project
to
exclude
related
tanker
traffic
additionally
the
federal
government
failed
to
adequately
consult
first
nations
as
required
by
law
it
ruled
the
big
takeaway
is
the
duty
to
consult
indigenous
people
is
still
the
most
important
step
in
any
major
project
said
andrew
leach
associate
professor
of
business
economics
at
the
university
of
alberta
trudeau
has
portrayed
himself
as
a
friend
to
aboriginal
people
and
tried
to
build
national
support
for
a
carbon
emissions
reduction
plan
even
while
backing
trans
mountain
to
support
the
oil
industry
it
s
quite
a
slap
to
the
government
by
the
court
on
the
grounds
of
reconciliation
with
first
nations
said
kathryn
harrison
a
professor
of
political
science
at
the
university
of
british
columbia
they
ve
committed
billions
of
dollars
in
taxpayers
funds
doubling
down
on
a
project
that
the
courts
have
just
trudeau
s
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
the
government
remains
absolutely
committed
to
building
the
project
adding
the
sale
could
close
as
early
as
friday
we
know
that
we
must
diversify
our
economy
and
our
markets
for
resources
and
that
s
why
it
was
important
to
buy
the
pipeline
morneau
told
reporters
in
toronto
in
a
statement
kinder
morgan
canada
president
ian
anderson
said
the
court
ruling
was
not
a
condition
of
the
pipeline
s
sale
to
ottawa
he
said
the
project
is
suspending
construction
kinder
morgan
canada
shareholders
voted
on
thursday
to
approve
the
pipeline
s
sale
to
ottawa
canada
has
the
option
to
appeal
the
ruling
to
the
supreme
court
but
morneau
said
the
government
had
made
no
decisions
and
needs
time
to
study
the
ruling
an
appeal
to
the
higher
court
would
drag
out
the
project
at
least
another
couple
of
years
harrison
said
thankfully
the
court
has
stepped
in
where
canada
has
failed
to
protect
and
respect
our
rights
and
our
water

chief
lee
spahan
said
in
a
statement
our
members
will
be
hugely
the
trans
mountain
expansion
would
nearly
triple
capacity
on
an
existing
line
from
edmonton
alberta
to
a
port
in
the
vancouver
area
for
export
it
was
approved
by
the
federal
government
in
the
court
s
ruling
is
likely
to
amplify
sentiments
expressed
by
oil
producers
such
as
suncor
energy
inc
that
they
would
hold
off
on
further
major
investments
in
canada
s
oil
patch
until
regulatory
challenges
abated
shares
of
canadian
oil
producers
fell
in
toronto
led
lower
by
heavy
oil
producers
meg
energy
corp
and
athabasca
oil
corp
which
are
especially
hurt
by
price
discounts
connected
to
clogged
pipelines
further
delays
will
harm
canada
s
economy
by
limiting
access
to
global
markets
said
al
