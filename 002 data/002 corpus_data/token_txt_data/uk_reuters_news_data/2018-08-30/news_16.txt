year
earlier
for
the
first
time
in
months
according
to
figures
released
on
thursday
by
the
state
s
energy
regulator
a
fresh
sign
that
a
lack
of
pipeline
space
in
the
nation
s
largest
shale
field
may
be
curbing
production
texas
june
oil
production
was
million
barrels
down
about
percent
from
the
same
month
last
year
and
off
percent
from
the
previous
month
the
texas
railroad
commission
estimated
in
a
monthly
report
so
far
this
year
the
state
s
crude
output
had
been
rising
percent
annually
the
slowdown
comes
as
oil
prices
in
west
texas
home
of
the
permian
basin
have
fallen
to
near
lows
as
production
outpaces
takeaway
capacity
including
pipelines
local
refineries
and
rail
cars
this
week
west
texas
intermediate
wti
in
midland
texas
traded
at
a
more
than
discount
to
the
benchmark
its
lowest
level
since
august
back
then
local
oil
prices
also
sank
because
there
were
not
enough
pipelines
to
carry
away
production
some
west
texas
producers
have
said
they
will
pull
back
on
activity
and
delay
well
completions
as
a
result
of
falling
local
oil
prices
the
number
of
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
ducs
in
the
permian
rose
by
in
july
to
accounting
for
around
percent
of
all
ducs
in
the
united
states
the
energy
information
administration
said
this
month
keane
group
which
hydraulically
fractures
shale
wells
last
month
said
it
expected
ducs
to
rise
as
operators
continue
to
drill
wells
to
hold
onto
specialized
rigs
when
prices
are
weak
producers
will
hold
off
completing
wells
and
grow
their
duc
count
the
department
of
energy
forecasts
west
texas
oil
production
will
grow
next
month
despite
the
weaker
prices
and
transportation
bottlenecks
it
calls
for
output
to
rise
by
barrels
per

to
million
