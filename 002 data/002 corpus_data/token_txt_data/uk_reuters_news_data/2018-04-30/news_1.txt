u.s. lawmakers seek details from epa chief on fuel economy rule changes
washington
reuters
two
democratic
lawmakers
asked
environmental
protection
agency
chief
scott
pruitt
on
monday
for
documents
related
to
proposed
changes
to
vehicle
fuel
emission
standards
and
california
s
authority
to
set
its
own
measures
and
accused
him
of
misleading
congress
of
the
agency
s
plans
representatives
doris
matsui
of
california
and
paul
tonko
of
new
york
sent
the
letter
after
reports
on
friday
that
the
epa
and
national
highway
transportation
safety
administration
had
prepared
a
proposal
that
would
likely
freeze
fuel
economy
standards
from
through
and
assert
that
a
federal
law
states
from
imposing
their
own
emissions
rules
matsui
said
the
reports
which
came
a
day
after
pruitt
testified
about
ethics
and
travel
concerns
before
two
house
committees
contradicted
his
response
to
her
question
about
whether
the
epa
would
revoke
california
s
clean
air
act
waiver
that
enables
it
to
set
more
stringent
fuel
economy
standards
he
said
not
at
if
true
these
reports
directly
contradict
your
testimony
last
week
as
you
were
reminded
at
the
start
of
that
hearing
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law
to
knowingly
make
false
statements
to
a
congressional
committee
the
letter
said
the
lawmakers
requested
all
emails
related
to
the
development
of
the
proposal
drafts
a
list
of
staff
that
participated
in
the
proposal
and
a
list
of
all
meetings
held
with
industry
and
stakeholders
about
it
they
also
asked
for
data
used
by
the
epa
earlier
this
month
when
it
determined
earlier
proposed
standards
were
too
stringent
the
agency
is
continuing
to
work
with
nhtsa
to
develop
a
joint
proposed
rule
and
is
looking
forward
to
the
interagency
process
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
said
bowman
said
the
proposal
had
not
yet
been
sent
to
the
white
house
office
of
management
and
budget
for
review
an
administration
source
familiar
with
the
proposal
said
it
would
be
sent
to
the
omb
by
the
end
of
the
week
other
california
lawmakers
raised
concerns
about
reports
that
the
epa
could
undermine
california
s
waiver
like
many
californians
from
across
the
political
spectrum
i
support
our
state
s
waiver
and
i
have
shared
my
views
with
administrator
pruitt
on
many
occasions
said
republican
representative
ken
calvert
who
said
he
would
facilitate
a
discussion
between
the
epa
and
california
officials
in
the
coming
days
and
weeks
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
said
his
office
was
monitoring
the
epa
s
plans
i
m
ready
to
take
any
and
all
action
necessary
to
defend
our
progress
