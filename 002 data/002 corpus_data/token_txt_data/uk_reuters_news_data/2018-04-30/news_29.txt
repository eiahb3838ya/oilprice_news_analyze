will
reach
years
of
independence
in
and
the
country
s
new
president
plans
to
mark
it
with
a
revolution
of
his
own
a
plan
to
end
the
use
of
fossil

in
transport
when
we
reach
years
of
independent
life
we
will
take
costa

forward
and
celebrate
that
we
ve
removed
gasoline
and
diesel
from
our
transportation
plans
carlos
alvarado
promised
in
his
victory
speech
this
month
the
progressive
beat
rival
fabricio
alvarado
an
evangelical
preacher
and
musician
with
percent
of
the
vote
in
elections
and
will
take
office
on
may
the
s
promise
marks
the
first
time
a
costa
rican
leader
has
backed
such
a
move
though
green
organizations
have
previously
urged
it
according
to
alvarado
s
environmental
advisors
no
date
has
yet
been
set
for
a
full
phase
out
of
fossil
fuels
in
transport
but
the
plan
should
be
ready
by
achieving
transport
quickly
even
in
a
central
american
country
for
its
environmental
commitment
will
be
a
significant
challenge
energy
experts
say
jose
daniel
lara
a
costa
rican
energy
researcher
at
the
university
of
said
completely
eliminating
fossil
fuels
within
just
a
few
years
is
probably
unrealistic
though
the
plan
will
lay
the
groundwork
for
faster
action
toward
the
goal
a
proposal
like
this
one
must
be
seen
by
its
rhetoric
value
and
not
by
its
technical
precision
lara
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
oscar
echeverría
president
of
the
vehicle
and
machinery
importers
association
said
the
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
in
transport
can
t
be
rushed
as
the
clean
transport
market
is
so
far
undeveloped
if
there
s
no
previous
infrastructure
competence
affordable
prices
and
waste
management
we
d
be
leading
this
process
to
failure
we
need
to
be
careful
echeverría
said
but
economist
mónica
araya
a
costa
rican
sustainability
expert
and
director
of
costa
rica
limpia
which
promotes
renewable
energy
and
electric
transport
said
that
in
a
country
already
rapidly
weaning
itself
off
fossil
fuels
focusing
on
transport
one
of
the
last
major
challenges
could
send
a
powerful
message
to
the
world
getting
rid
of
fossil
fuels
is
a
big
idea
coming
from
a
small
country
this
is
an
idea
that
s
starting
to
gain
international
support
with
the
rise
of
new
technologies
she
said
in
an
interview
costa
rica
s
push
toward
clean
energy
faces
no
backlash
in
part
because
the
country
has
no
significant
oil
or
gas
industry
but
demand
for
cars
is
rising
as
is
use
of
other
transport
systems
and
that
may
prove
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
in
meeting
the
new
goal
lara
said
according
to
data
by
the
national
registry
the
country
s
records
agency
there
were
twice
as
many
cars
registered
as
babies
born
in
transport
is
today
the
country
s
main
source
of
climate
changing
emissions
according
to
the
country
s
national
meteorological
institute
percent
of
costa
rica
s
emissions
come
from
energy
use
and
more
than
two
thirds
of
that
is
from
transport
according
to
data
from
the
state
of
the
region
report
put
together
by
a
council
of
costa
rica
s
university
leaders
public
transport
has
struggled
to
meet
the
transport
needs
of
the
country
as
a
result
demand
for
private
vehicles
has
risen
dramatically
with
the
car
industry
growing
percent
in
alone
making
costa
rica
one
of
the
fastest
growing
auto
markets
in
latin
america
according
to
the
report
one
problem
in
cutting
back
on
fossil
fuels
is
that
the
country
s
budget
depends
on
them
lara
said
according
to
ministry
of
treasury
data
percent
more
than
a
fifth
of
the
government
s
income
comes
from
fossil
fuel
taxes
and
most
of
those
are
levied
on
transport
that
is
particularly
problematic
because
the
country
has
run
a
budget
deficit
since
with
its
debt
now
having
climbed
to
more
than
percent
of
gdp
last
year
according
to
the
treasury
the
international
monetary
fund
noted
in
that
public
debt
continues
to
rise
rapidly
despite
efforts
to
curb
it
but
the
president
s
proposal
to
eliminate
fossil
fuel
use
for
transport
could
force
a
rethink
of
costa
rica
s
financial
dependence
on
a
pollution
source
lara
said
the
country
could
for
instance
consider
broader
new
taxes
on
carbon
emissions
araya
said
a
move
that
could
provide
benefits
including
less
spending
by
the
country
s
health
services
on
respiratory
problems
the
new
a
former
national
employment
minister
under
the
country
s
current
government
envisions
eliminating
transport
fuels
as
just
another
step
toward
a
full
of
fossil
fuels
such
an
achievement
would
be
a
defining
moment
in
the
country
s
history
akin
to
the
country
s
abolition
of
its
army
in
he
said
the
effort
to
end
the
use
of
transport
fossil
fuels
is
expected
to
start
with
reform
of
the
country
s
hydrocarbon
laws
araya
said
that
the
rapid
international
of
renewable
power
and
electric
transport
could
make
things
easier
and
be
a
big
economic
opportunity
for
costa
rica
for
example
it
took
almost
years
to
get
to
one
million
electric
cars
worldwide
it
took
months
to
reach
two
million
the
third
million
happened
in
around
the
next
eight
months
this
is
exponential
growth
she
said
prices
are
falling
and
efficiency
growing
in
new
clean
energy
technologies
including
battery
storage
she
said
the
biggest
barrier
to
seeing
them
much
more
widely
used
may
simply
be
that
people
aren
t
yet
used
to
them
she
added
tackling
resistance
to
change
is
one
of
the
most
important
tasks
we
have
right
now
