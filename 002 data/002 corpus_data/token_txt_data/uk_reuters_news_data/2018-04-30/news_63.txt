london
reuters
britain
s
interior
minister
resigned
on
sunday
after
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
government
faced
an
outpouring
of
indignation
over
its
treatment
of
some
caribbean
residents
who
were
wrongly
labelled
illegal
immigrants
the
loss
of
one
of
may
s
closest
allies
is
a
blow
as
she
navigates
the
final
year
of
negotiations
ahead
of
britain
s
exit
from
the
european
union
in
march
it
also
deprives
the
cabinet
of
one
of
its
most
outspoken
members
in
a
resignation
letter
to
may
amber
rudd
said
she
had
inadvertently
misled
a
parliamentary
committee
last
wednesday
by
denying
the
government
had
targets
for
the
deportation
of
illegal
migrants
may
accepted
her
resignation
for
two
weeks
british
ministers
have
been
struggling
to
explain
why
some
descendants
of
the
windrush
generation
invited
to
britain
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
had
been
denied
basic
rights
the
windrush
scandal
overshadowed
the
commonwealth
summit
in
london
and
has
raised
questions
about
may
s
stint
as
interior
minister
before
she
became
prime
minister
in
the
wake
of
the
brexit
referendum
the
windrush
scandal
has
rightly
shone
a
light
on
an
important
issue
for
our
country
rudd
said
in
a
resignation
letter
to
may
rudd
who
was
appointed
home
secretary
in
said
voters
wanted
those
who
had
the
right
to
reside
in
britain
to
be
treated
fairly
and
humanely
but
also
that
illegal
immigrants
be
removed
the
opposition
labour
party
which
had
repeatedly
called
on
rudd
to
resign
said
may
was
responsible
and
should
explain
her
own
role
in
the
government
s
immigration
policies
the
architect
of
this
crisis
theresa
may
must
now
step
forward
to
give
an
immediate
full
and
honest
account
of
how
this
inexcusable
situation
happened
on
her
watch
said
diane
abbott
labour
s
spokeswoman
on
interior
affairs
abbott
called
on
may
to
give
a
statement
to
the
house
of
commons
explaining
whether
she
knew
that
rudd
was
misleading
parliament
about
the
deportation
targets
facing
questions
over
the
windrush
scandal
rudd
told
lawmakers
on
wednesday
that
britain
did
not
have
targets
for
the
removal
of
immigrants
but
was
forced
to
clarify
her
words
after
leaked
documents
showed
some
targets
did
exist
the
guardian
newspaper
on
sunday
reported
a
letter
from
rudd
to
may
last
year
in
which
she
stated
an
ambitious
but
deliverable
aim
for
an
increase
in
the
enforced
deportation
of
immigrants
after
repeated
challenges
to
her
testimony
on
the
deportation
of
immigrants
rudd
telephoned
may
on
sunday
and
offered
her
resignation
i
feel
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
because
i
inadvertently
misled
the
home
affairs
select
committee
over
targets
for
removal
of
illegal
immigrants
rudd
told
may
with
her
conservative
party
split
over
brexit
may
will
have
to
be
careful
to
preserve
the
uneasy
balance
in
the
cabinet
after
the
loss
of
such
a
senior
minister
possible
contenders
who
could
replace
rudd
include
environment
secretary
michael
gove
health
secretary
jeremy
hunt
communities
secretary
sajid
javid
northern
irish
secretary
karen
bradley
and
former
northern
irish
secretary
james
brokenshire
the
government
has
apologised
for
the
fiasco
promised
citizenship
and
compensation
to
those
affected
including
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
been
threatened
with
deportation
and
denied
benefits
because
of
the
errors
but
the
controversy
over
policies
which
may
is
closely
associated
with
has
raised
awkward
questions
about
how
the
pursuit
of
lower
immigration
after
brexit
sits
alongside
the
desire
to
be
an
global
economy
the
immigrants
are
named
after
the
empire
windrush
one
of
the
first
ships
to
bring
caribbean
migrants
to
britain
in
when
commonwealth
citizens
were
invited
to
fill
labour
shortages
and
help
rebuild
the
economy
after
world
war
two
almost
half
a
million
people
left
their
homes
in
the
west
indies
to
live
in
britain
between
and
according
to
britain
s
national
archives
a
week
before
local
elections
may
apologised
to
the
black
community
on
thursday
in
a
letter
to
the
voice
britain
s
national
newspaper
we
have
let
you
down
and
i
am
deeply
sorry
she
said
but
apologies
alone
are
not
good
enough
we
must
urgently
right
this
historic
the
crisis
has
focussed
attention
on
may
who
as
interior
minister
set
out
to
create
a
really
hostile
environment
for
illegal
immigrants
imposing
tough
new
requirements
in
for
people
to
prove
their
legal
status
rudd
s
resignation
comes
four
months
after
another
close
ally
and
her
then
most
senior
minister
damian
green
was
forced
out
of
his
job
for
lying
about
whether
he
knew
pornography
had
been
found
on
computers
in
his
parliamentary
office
anna
soubry
a
conservative
lawmaker
predicted
rudd
may
one
day
return
to
a
senior
job
in
government
she
is
a
woman
of
great
courage
and
immense
ability
soubry
said
if
there
is
any
justice
she
will
soon
return

the
highest
