became
the
sole
candidate

he
gets
the
job
left

by
the
resignation

after
two
weeks
of
protests
depends
on
a
parliamentary

held
on
tuesday
pashinyan
has
received
the
support
of
all
opposition
parties
in
parliament
who
hold
seats
in
the
legislature
but
he
will
require
a
majority
to
win
demonstrations
driven
by
public
anger
over
perceived
political
cronyism
and
corruption
in
the
south

way
out
pashinyan
said
that
a

an
end

think
this
is
a
unique
and
great
opportunity
to
resolve
the
domestic
political
crisis

to
register
the
victory
of
the
people
the
kind
of
victory
in
which
there
are
no
losers

yerevan
towards
the
evening
with
a
column
of
demonstrators
marching
to
the
capital
city
s
main
square
speaking
with
journalists
on
monday
pashinyan
said
his
main
project
as
interim
prime
minister
would
be
to
organise
new
free
and
fair
parliamentary
elections
for
the
post
of
prime
minister
although
demonstrations
have
been
peaceful
the
upheaval
has
threatened
to
destabilise
armenia
an
ally
of
russia
in
a
volatile
region
