rises
this

and
the

seen
likely
to

the
key

to
what
extent
can

persist
said
jacob
mitchell
chief
investment
officer
of
australian
investment
boutique
antipodes
which
has
a
billion
in
assets
under
management
global
shares
had
a
dream
run
in
helped
by
the
first
synchronous
world
growth
in
decades
coupled
with
easy
monetary
policies
in
most
of
the
developed
world
we
believe
the
unusually
favourable
goldilocks
combination
of
accelerating
growth
and
tepid
inflation
experienced
in
will
not
repeat
mitchell
added
instead
normalisation
of
interest
rate
policy
will
likely
upset
the
rhythm
with
more
volatile
and
less
forgiving
indeed
the
msci
asia
index
is
almost
flat
so
far
in
compared
with
a
more
than
percent
jump
in
the
same
period
last
year
investors
will
turn
their
focus
to
a
torrent
of
data
from
the
united
states
this
week
including
consumer
spending
later
in
the
day
the
fed
s
policy
decision
on
wednesday
and
a
jobs
report
on
friday
separately
a
delegation
of
officials
including
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
and
president
donald
trump
s
top
economic
and
trade
advisers
larry
kudlow
robert
lighthizer
and
peter
navarro
are
all
expected
in
china
later
this
week
for
trade
negotiations
the
relationship
had
turned
sour
earlier
this
year
when
trump
announced
stiff
tariffs
on
some
chinese
imports
setting
off
a
response
from
beijing
political
tensions
in
the
korean
peninsula
are
also
showing
signs
of
easing
following
a
historic
summit
between
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
and
south
korea
s
moon
last
week
at
which
they
vowed
complete
denuclearization
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
sunday
that
he
told
kim
that
the
north
korea
leader
would
have
to
agree
to
take
irreversible
steps
toward
abandoning
nuclear
weapons
if
he
was
to
reach
a
deal

trump

adding

the
considerable
troubles
of
prime

theresa
may
s
government
the
pound
was
last
buying
after
falling
percent
on
friday
when
disappointing
economic
growth
data
challenged
expectations
the
bank
of
england
would
raise
rates
in
may
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
it
had
been
as
high
as
the
gdp
print
missed
the
and
may
quickly
repriced
to
around
a
percent
chance
of
a
hike
wrote
analysts
at
citi
in
a
note
we
do
not
expect
a
hike
next
month
and
expect
a
more
dovish
meeting
than
is
currently
the

was
barely
changed
after
retreating
on
friday
with
its
index

six
major
