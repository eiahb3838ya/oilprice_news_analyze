plans
to
increase
the
volume
of
russian
espo
crude
it
receives
under
a
supply
contract
with
russian
producer
rosneft
since
espo
is
sought
by
more
chinese
refiners
four
trade
sources
said
starting
in
july
cefc
could
take
eight
cargoes
of
about
barrels
or
million
barrels
of
espo
crude
from
rosneft
the
four
sources
said
the
cargoes
are
part
of
a
supply
contract
with
the
russian
producer
for
million
tonnes
of
oil
per
year
it
signed
late
in
that
jump
started
cefc
s
oil
trading
business
previously
rosneft
supplied
cefc
with
six
espo
cargoes
two
cargoes
of
sokol
crude
and
two
urals
shipments
cefc
will
swap
the
sokol
cargoes
with
the
espo
the
sources
said
rosneft
said
in
an
email
on
friday
that
it
will
supply
its
term
contracts
based
on
the
agreed
timing
and
volumes
without
saying
that
it
is
increasing
espo
shipments
to
cefc
the
swap
arrangement
is
a
sign
that
cefc
s
landmark
crude
oil
deal
with
top
russian
producer
rosneft
remains
intact
even
as
the
chinese
firm
s
planned
billion
investment
in
rosneft
has
stalled
news
that
cefc
s
founder
and
chairman
ye
jianming
was
investigated
by
chinese
authorities
for
suspected
economic
crimes
spooked
cefc
s
trading
partners
in
march
but
market
participants
are
convinced
that
china
s
government
may
step
in
to
take
over
the
private
company
now
the
market
believes
that
chances
are
high
that
the
chinese
government
will
step
in
and
take
care
of
the
problems
it
has
gone
past
the
earlier
panic
in
march
said
a
trading
executive
who
deals
with
cefc
s
russian
barrels
the
increase
in
espo
cargoes
gives
cefc
control
over
about
percent
of
the
total
seaborne
espo
sold
in
a
month
up
from
percent
making
it
a
key
russian
crude
supplier
to
china
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
russia
was
china
s
top
oil
supplier
in
march
retaining
the
lead
spot
for
a
consecutive
month
cefc
s
number
of
counterparties
has
also
grown
to
between
six
and
seven
buyers
for
its
cargoes
for
loading
in
may
to
june
while
the
firm
last
month
won
for
the
first
time
a
tender
to
supply
espo
to
chinese
independent
