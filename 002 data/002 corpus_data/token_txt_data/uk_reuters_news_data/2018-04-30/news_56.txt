as
a

from

help

memories
of

a

and
while
i
would

not
all

are
positive
the
s

looks

good

that

said

an
analyst
at

markets
sainsbury
s
shares
shot
up
percent
at
the
open
after
the

agreed
a
billion

merger
with

buoyed

risk
appetite
this
after
asian
shares
extended
gains
on
monday
as
tensions
in
the
korean
peninsula
eased
and
earnings
shone
although
some
investors
were
cautious
about
the
outlook
amid
the
backdrop
of
a
simmering
trade
dispute
msci
s
broadest
index
of

outside

climbed
one
percent
adding
to
a
similar
rise
on
friday
the
index
is
now
poised
for
a
modest
rise
this
month
after
two
consecutive
losses
south
korea
s
kospi
index
jumped
percent
and
is
set
to
end
april
more
than
percent
higher
following
record
profits
from
tech
giant
samsung
electronics
and
after
a
successful
summit
on
friday
south
korean
president
moon
and
the
north
s
leader
kim
jong
un
agreed
to
end
hostilities
and
work
toward
complete
denuclearisation
of
the
korean
peninsula
the
direction
of
travel
is
more
positive
that
it
was
at
the
end
of
last
year
and
geopolitics
is
now
not
the
concern
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
april
said
hewson
of
cmc
markets
but
the
potential
for
trade
wars
would
be
the
main
issue
for
me
going
forward
that
s
the
clear
and
present
danger
and
what
effect
it
may
have
on
oil
prices

oil
prices
eased
from
recent
highs
with

since

basket

as
traders
awaited
consumer

numbers
to
see
whether
the

can
continue
its

run
of
gains
the

is
also
due
to
meet
this
week
and
while
no
rate
hike
is
expected
investors
will
look
for
clues
on
the
future
pace
of
hikes
there
might
be
a
tweak
to
the
inflation
language
acknowledging
the
move
towards
two
percent
on
inflation
rather
than
have
continued
to
run

expecting
the

the
question
is
whether
