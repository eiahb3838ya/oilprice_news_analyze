oil
major
bp
plc
is
closely
following
oil
auctions
in
brazil
and
mexico
which
are
expected
to
announce
new
awards
later
this
year
to
decide
whether
to
submit
bids
and
expand
its
presence
in
the
region
felipe
arbelaez
the
firm
s
chief
for
latin
america
said
on
monday
rising
crude
prices
and
energy
reforms
in
several
latin
american
nations
have
reinvigorated
the
oil
majors
appetite
for
a
region
that
once
imposed
nationalizations
forced
contract
changes
and
strict
rules
for
foreign
investors
more
companies
are
becoming
interested
in
offshore
prospects
from
brazil
to
guyana
which
present
potential
new
reserves
and
could
diversify
investment
portfolios
our
emphasis
in
the
region
right
now
in
terms
of
bidding
rounds
is
in
brazil
and
mexico
we
are
also
looking
at
argentina
though
it
is
still
early
arbelaez
said
brazil
will
receive
bids
for
blocks
in
its
coveted
presalt
region
in
june
after
awarding
majors
including
exxon
mobil
corp
bp
and
royal
dutch
shell
plc
offshore
blocks
in
previous
rounds
in
and
brazil
s
government
also
is
in
negotiations
with
petrobras
to
accept
foreign
investment
in
the
remaining
areas
of
fields
assigned
to
the
oil
company
the
resulting
blocks
would
be
auctioned
this
year
along
with
hundreds
of
areas
that
were
not
awarded
in
previous
rounds
for
its
part
mexico
plans
to
announce
results
in
september
from
two
onshore
rounds
including
its
first
offer
of
unconventional
areas
for
foreign
investment
in
colombia
and
uruguay
the
investors
interest
has
not
been
as
high
the
andean
nation
has
postponed
several
times
the
offer
for
its
jacinto
onshore
round
while
uruguay
received
no
bids
at
its
third
offshore
auction
in
april
the
auctions
in
many
latin
american
countries
come
as
presidential
elections
this
year
increase
the
political
risk
because
some
candidates
have
promised
to
slam
the
brakes
on
reforms
revise
the
signed
contracts
or
change
fiscal
terms
every
country
is
different
the
elections
don
t
change
our
perspective
in
the
medium
or
long
terms
arbelaez
said
bp
is
trying
to
increase
the
number
of
oil
projects
it
operates
in
the
region
especially
in
brazil
in
countries
including
guyana
colombia
and
suriname
the
firm
is
seeking
opportunities
to
participate
in
offshore
areas
these
countries
are
reopening
for
foreign
investment
we
think
that
will
benefit
the
countries
because
they
will
have
a
wider
number
of
experienced
operators
and
because
they
will
be
capable
of
better
developing
and
marketing
their
resources
