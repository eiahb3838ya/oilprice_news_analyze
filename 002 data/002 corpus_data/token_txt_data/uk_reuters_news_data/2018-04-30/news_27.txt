icebergs could float to the rescue of cape town water crisis
johannesburg
reuters
marine
salvage
experts
are
floating
a
plan
to
tug
icebergs
from
antarctica
to
south
africa
s
cape
town
to
help
solve
the
region
s
worst
water
shortage
in
a
century
salvage
master
nick
sloane
told
reuters
he
was
looking
for
government
and
private
investors
for
a
scheme
to
guide
huge
chunks
of
ice
across
the
ocean
chop
them
into
a
slurry
and
melt
them
down
into
millions
of
liters
of
drinking
water
we
want
to
show
that
if
there
is
no
other
source
to
solve
the
water
crisis
we
have
another
idea
no
one
else
has
thought
of
yet
said
sloane
who
led
the
refloating
of
the
capsized
italian
passenger
liner
costa
concordia
in
south
africa
has
declared
a
national
disaster
over
the
drought
that
hit
its
southern
and
western
regions
after
and
turned
into
two
of
the
driest
years
on
record
tough
water
restrictions
are
already
in
place
and
cape
town
authorities
have
warned
that
taps
could
run
dry
altogether
as
soon
as
next
year
if
winter
rains
do
not
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
port
city
s
million
residents
cape
sloane
said
his
team
could
wrap
passing
icebergs
in
fabric
skirts
to
protect
them
and
reduce
evaporation
large
tankers
could
then
guide
the
blocks
into
the
benguela
current
that
flows
along
the
west
coast
of
southern
africa
a
milling
machine
would
then
cut
into
the
ice
producing
a
slurry
and
forming
a
saucer
structure
that
will
speed
up
the
natural
process
he
said
a
single
iceberg
could
produce
about
million
liters
per
day
for
about
a
year
around
percent
of
the
city
s
needs
said
sloane
a
director
at
the
marine
salvage
firm
resolve
marine
he
said
he
was
planning
to
hold
a
conference
later
this
month
to
try
and
sell
the
million
project
to
city
officials
and
investors
the
city
council
was
not
immediately
