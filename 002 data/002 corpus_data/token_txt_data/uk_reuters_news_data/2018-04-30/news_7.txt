netanyahu
said
israel
had
proof
that
iran
lied
about
its
nuclear
capabilities
and
that
he
was
sure
president
donald
trump
would
do
the
right
thing
in
reviewing
the
country
s
nuclear

with
western

netanyahu
said
israel
has
evidence
that
iran
lied
about
its
nuclear
program
after

the
agreement
with
global
powers
iran
dismissed
netanyahu
s
accusations
calling
them
netanyahu
may
be
the
flavour
of
the
day
but
the
larger
issue
driving
this
is
what
will
trump
do
with
iran
and
what
will
iran
do
in
response
and
that
uncertainty
is
the
fundamental
driver
not
so
much
netanyahu
said
walter
zimmerman
chief
technical
analyst
for

has
until

to
decide
whether
to
restore
sanctions
on
iran
that
were
lifted
after
the
international
agreement

prices
have
risen
this
month
to
their
highest
since

extremely
sensitive
to
any
