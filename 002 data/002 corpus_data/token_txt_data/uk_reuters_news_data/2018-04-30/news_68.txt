wants
to
hold

until

alinta
energy
offered
a
million
million
on
monday
for
australia
s
ageing
liddell
power
plant
creating
a
headache
for
owner
agl
energy
amid
a
national
debate
over
energy
security
agl
has
long
flagged
plans
to
shut
the
plant
in
as
part
of
a
phased
exit
from
power
but
has
come
under
pressure
from
the
federal
government
to
sell
it
to
ensure
generation
for
intermittent
wind
and
solar
power
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
told
agl
s
chairman
this
month
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
keep
the
plant
open
or
sell
it
after
alinta
owned
by
hong
kong
conglomerate
chow
tai
fook
enterprises
expressed
interest
in
buying
it
any
sale
would
be
unlikely
to
run
into
regulatory
hurdles
despite
growing
concerns
about
chinese
ownership
of
key
assets
given
the
worries
about
energy
security
and
a
boost
to
competition
from
a
alinta
it
won
approval
last
year
to
buy
another
plant
however
agl
would
have
to
weigh
a
range
of
factors
including
that
it
needs
liddell
to
meet
customer
demand
until
it
wants
the
site
for
a
battery
installation
after
and
selling
liddell
would
bolster
alinta
s
competitive
position
it
s
a
very
difficult
decision
to
make
said

bank

analyst

johnston
agl
wants
to
replace
liddell
s
capacity
by
by
spending
about
a
billion
billion
on
a
mix
of
and
renewable
power
as
well
as
a
battery
at
the
liddell
site
and
other
measures
however
alinta
and
others
see
an
opportunity
in
keeping
open
the
plant
in
australia
s
most
populous
state
new
south
wales
nsw
as
power
could
fetch
a
premium
at
times
when
the
market
is
short
on
renewable
energy
alinta
energy
has
submitted
a
offer
for
the
liddell
power
station
to
agl
which
we
believe
represents
a
compelling
commercial
proposition
for
agl
shareholders
alinta
said
in
an
email
to
reuters
agl
which
said
it
was
considering
the
offer
reiterated
that
it
wanted
to
hold
on
to
liddell
until
agl
has
not
sought
to
sell
the
liddell
power
station
as
it
requires
liddell
to
provide
energy
to
its
customers
until
and
for
repurposing
as
part
of
its
nsw
generation
plan
post
the
company
said
in
a
statement
agl
paid
virtually
nothing
for
liddell
when
it
acquired
macquarie
generation
in
but
has
since
spent
around
a
million
to
keep
the
plant
operating
reliably
until
when
it
will
be
years
old
alinta
would
have
to
spend
about
a
million
more
to
improve
the
plant
a

familiar
with
the
company
s
plan
said
alinta
last
year
bought
a
newer
plant
