opec april oil output hits year low on venezuela slide - reuters survey
london
reuters
opec
oil
output
fell
in
april
to
a
low
due
to
declining
production
in
venezuela
and
lower
shipments
from
african
producers
a
reuters
survey
found
sending
compliance
with
a
deal
to
another
record
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
this
month
the
survey
found
down
bpd
from
march
the
april
total
is
the
lowest
since
april
according
to
reuters
surveys
opec
is
reducing
output
by
about
million
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
to
get
rid
of
excess
supply
the
pact
started
in
january
and
runs
until
the
end
of
adherence
by
producers
in
the
deal
rose
to
percent
of
agreed
cuts
from
a
revised
percent
in
march
the
survey
found
there
was
again
no
sign
that
saudi
arabia
or
other
big
producers
had
boosted
output
significantly
to
cash
in
on
higher
prices
or
to
compensate
for
the
venezuelan
decline
thus
higher
oil
production
is
needed
to
plug
the
supply
gap
said
carsten
fritsch
analyst
at
commerzbank
referring
to
the
lack
of
extra
barrels
from
other
opec
members
to
compensate
for
declines
oil
has
topped
a
barrel
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
and
was
trading
near
on
monday
still
opec
says
supply
restraints
should
be
maintained
to
ensure
the
end
of
a
glut
that
had
built
up
since
in
april
the
biggest
decrease
in
supply
came
from
venezuela
where
the
oil
industry
is
starved
of
funds
because
of
economic
crisis
output
dropped
to
million
bpd
in
april
the
survey
found
a
new
low
production
in
angola
where
natural
declines
at
some
fields
are
weighing
on
output
slipped
and
the
country
is
pumping
over
bpd
less
than
its
opec
target
nigerian
exports
which
have
risen
this
year
slipped
in
april
production
in
libya
which
remains
unstable
due
to
unrest
edged
lower
after
a
suspected
act
of
sabotage
briefly
stopped
flows
from
waha
oil
s
fields
industry
sources
said
opec
s
two
largest
producers
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
pumped
slightly
more
but
not
enough
to
offset
the
declines
elsewhere
output
in
top
producer
saudi
arabia
edged
up
due
to
higher
exports
sources
in
the
survey
said
but
remained
below
the
kingdom
s
opec
target
iraq
the
pumped
more
because
of
an
increase
in
exports
from
the
south
the
outlet
for
most
of
the
country
s
crude
despite
maintenance
at
a
loading
terminal
output
in
the
country
holding
the
opec
presidency
this
year
the
united
arab
emirates
remained
steady
in
april
as
it
continues
to
show
higher
compliance
than
in
sources
close
to
the
matter
said
kuwait
also
maintained
full
compliance
nigeria
and
libya
were
originally
exempt
from
cutting
supply
because
their
output
had
been
curbed
by
conflict
and
unrest
for
both
told
opec
that
output
would
not
exceed
levels
opec
has
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
taking
into
account
changes
of
membership
since
plus
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
pumped
about
bpd
below
this
implied
target
in
april
not
least
because
of
the
involuntary
declines
in
venezuela
and
angola
