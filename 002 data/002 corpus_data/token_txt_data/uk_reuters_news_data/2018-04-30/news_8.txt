exempting
the
oklahoma
facility
from
requirements
under
a
federal
biofuels
law
according
to
two
industry
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
the

enables

s
cvr
energy
inc
to
avoid
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
costs

the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
program
the
regulation
is
meant
to
cut
air
pollution
reduce
petroleum
imports
and
support
corn
farmers
by
requiring
refiners
to
mix
billions
of
gallons
of
biofuels
into
the
nation

gasoline
and
diesel
each
year
the
small
refiners

which
represents
companies
that
operate
small
refining
facilities
said
the
epa
is
required
by
law
to
help
small
refineries
struggling
with
these
regulations

that
such
exemptions
are
crucial
to
their
financial
it
applauded
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
for
protecting
small
refineries
regardless
of
ownership
from
the
rfs
requirements
but
the
exemption
for
cvr
s
wynnewood
oklahoma
plant
prompted
criticism
from
a
corn
state
lawmaker
and
the
powerful
corn
lobby
which
has
already
accused
trump
s
epa
of
overusing
the
hardship
waiver
program
in
a
way
that
hurts
demand
for
ethanol
hundreds
of
millions
and
in
some
cases
billions
of
dollars
in
profits
isn
t
my
definition
of
hardship
iowa

senator
chuck
grassley
said
in
statement
condemning
the
cvr
waiver
president
trump
promised
to
support
biofuels
and
administrator
pruitt
is
breaking
that
this
one
s
going
to
be
hard
for
pruitt
to
explain
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
industry
group
said
in
an
email
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
said
that
the
agency
does
not
comment
on
specific
refineries
but
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
criteria
used
to
grant
waivers
has
not
changed
since
previous
administrations
bowman
added
cvr

declined
to
comment
regarding
the

icahn
had
met
with
pruitt
when
pruitt
was
being
vetted
in
late
for
the
epa
administrator
job
according
to
news
reports
at
the
time
icahn
stepped
down
from
his
position
as
special
regulatory
adviser
to
the
republican
president
last
august
after
lawmakers
cited
potential
ethical
problems
in
his
dual
role
as
an
adviser
and
an
investor
icahn
is
currently
under
investigation
by
the
justice
department
for
his
role
in
influencing
biofuels
policy
while
serving
as
trump
s
adviser
some
lawmakers
have
expressed
concern
that
icahn
may
have
used
his
presidential
access
to
benefit
his
investments
a
charge
icahn
has
rejected
the
epa
has
said
it
has
granted
more
than
two
dozen
waivers
for
but
has
declined
to
name
the
recipients
under
trump
s
democratic
predecessor
barack
obama
the
epa
granted
about
eight
waivers
annually
records
show
cvr
had
been
denied
on
at
least
one
occasion
the
small
refiners
coalition
said
the
obama
administration
had
wrongly
denied
waivers
to
firms
like
cvr
reuters
has
reported
that
andeavor
one
of
america
s
biggest
refining
companies
which
reported
about
billion
in
net
profit
last
year
was
among
the
other
companies
that
have
received
hardship
waivers
from
trump
s
epa
for
its
small
refineries
to
prove
rfs
compliance
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
tradable
blending
credits
awarded
by
the
government
for
each
blended
gallon
of
fuel
and
hand
them
in
to
the
epa
yearly
the
epa
has
the
authority
to
exempt
small
refineries
of
under
barrels
per
day
from
the
requirement
under
the
hardship
waiver
program
if
they
can
prove
that
compliance
would
cause
them
disproportionate
financial
with
the
exemption
cvr
would
not
have
to
turn
over
the
credits
related
to
the
wynnewood
facility
for
according
to
the
two
sources
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
waiver
was
granted
in
recent
months
but
the
sources
did
not
say
precisely
when
the
trump
administration
has
encouraged
small
refiners
to
apply
for
the
hardship
waivers
a
surge
of
applications
has
come
to
the
epa
since
a
court
ruling
that
the
agency
had
used
too
narrow
a
definition
of
financial
hardship
under
obama
the
waivers
have
the
potential
to
save
companies
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
by
allowing
them
to
avoid
blending
or
paying
for
credits
on
the
open
market
and
by
permitting
them
to
sell
any
credits
they
have
on
hand
to
others
cvr
has
reported
a
million
profit
in
the
biofuels
credit
market
in
the
first
quarter
of
due
to
what
it
called
a
lower
rfs
obligation
an
unusual
return
for
a
refiner
that
has
no
biofuel
blending
facilities
the
company
also
said
it
expects
its
cost
of
complying
with
the
rfs
requirements
to
fall
to
million
for
the
entirety
of
from
a
previous
estimate
of
million
and
from
roughly
million
