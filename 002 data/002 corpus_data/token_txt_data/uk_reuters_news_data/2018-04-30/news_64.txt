parts
of
africa
will
get
left
behind
in
the
global
push
to
provide
electric
power
to
all
unless
national
governments
and
the
international
community
agree
on
a
plan
for
faster
action
in
places
that
are
lagging
a
top
energy
official
has
warned
of
the
roughly
billion
people
who
still
lack
access
to
electricity
around
the
world
nearly
million
live
in
africa
with
the
vast
majority
in
rural
areas
the
proportion
of
the
billion
that
lives
in
africa
is
increasing
said
rachel
kyte
ceo
of
sustainable
energy
for
all
seforall
a
body
set
up
by
the
united
nations
within
africa
some
countries
are
going
faster
than
others
but
those
that
aren
t
going
fast
are
going
to
get
left
behind
because
you
need
that
electricity
you
need
that
clean
energy
for
the
urban
growth
and
economic
development
they
all
want
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
some
african
countries
such
as
kenya
and
ethiopia
are
setting
a
good
example
said
kyte
who
also
serves
as
the
s
special
representative
on
energy
access
others
especially
those
mired
in
conflict
and
political
instability
or
emerging
from
war
are
falling
behind
shunned
by
investors
as
tough
places
to
do
business
she
said
they
include
countries
like
central
african
republic
and
sierra
leone
this
week
governments
energy
businesses
and
development
experts
will
gather
in
lisbon
at
a
forum
organised
by
seforall
to
discuss
ways
to
close
the
gap
in
making
sustainable
affordable
energy
available
to
everyone
a
set
of
global
development
goals
includes
key
energy
targets
to
be
met
by
ensuring
universal
access
to
modern
energy
increasing
substantially
the
share
of
renewables
used
and
doubling
the
rate
of
improvement
in
energy
efficiency
but
data
shows
rates
of
progress
are
still
too
slow
to
meet
the
targets
with
poor
marginalised
people
set
to
suffer
most
as
a
result
of
that
shortfall
experts
say
kyte
gave
examples
of
those
most
likely
to
be
overlooked
a
woman
running
a
household
in
a
rural
community
where
men
have
left
to
seek
work
in
the
city
a
disabled
family
head
living
in
an
urban
slum
or
an
indigenous
nomad
in
mongolia
or
the
sahel
such
households
may
be
the
hardest
to
reach
using
the
traditional
method
of
connecting
homes
to
the
power
grid
but
there
are
alternatives
kyte
emphasised
with
or
systems
those
people
are
reachable
and
they
are
reachable
with
clean
energy
and
they
are
reachable
affordably
she
said
governments
of
countries
doing
badly
on
energy
access
need
to
set
national
targets
invest
in
infrastructure
and
tackle
corruption
kyte
said
even
for
the
poorest
states
or
those
emerging
from
conflict
prioritising
energy
access
is
a
real
approach
to
take
because
lots
of
other
things
happen
she
added
switching
from
polluting
fuels
such
as
kerosene
and
diesel
to
solar
power
can
improve
people
s
health
help
children
study
and
allow
small
businesses
to
flourish
experts
say
distributed
energy
solutions
systems
that
operate
independently
of
the
main
grid
and
are
often
powered
by
renewables
can
be
built
quickly
and
nimbly
in
difficult
situations
kyte
said
they
are
also
suitable
for
use
in
and
around
camps
for
refugees
and
displaced
people
where
failure
to
provide
solar
lamps
or
efficient
cooking
stoves
can
lead
to
deforestation
kyte
hopes
international
agencies
and
businesses
will
put
in
place
a
global
action
plan
in
the
coming
months
to
provide
clean
power
to
people
forced
to
flee
their
homes
similarly
she
urged
development
banks
governments
and
companies
to
team
up
and
work
out
what
financial
and
technical
aid
is
needed
for
the
countries
that
are
home
to
of
the
billion
still
in
the
dark
another
priority
for
poor
nations
is
energy
efficiency
she
said
which
could
help
avoid
pollution
and
smog
in
their
cities
if
you
talk
about
energy
efficiency
as
the
way
to
ensure
clean
air
clean
water
low
energy
bills
buildings
you
want
to
live
in
transport
you
want
to
travel
in
then
that
becomes
a
big
part
of
leaving
no
one
behind
