offshore wind power firms see taiwan as a battleground to expand in asia
copenhagen

taiwan
is
becoming
the
next
battleground
for
the
world
s
top
offshore
wind
developers
as
they
seek
a
foothold
in
asia
for
a
technology
that
has
been
expanding
fast
in
europe
taiwan
announced
results
on
monday
of
its
first
major
offshore
wind
farm
auction
that
aims
to
add
gigawatts
gw
of
capacity
to
its
existing
network
of
just

the
island
s
offshore
wind
market
is
expected
to
expand
to
gw

aims
to
invest

day
says
taiwan
is
making
a
big
push
to
attract
investments
in
renewable
technology
as
it
phases
out
nuclear
power
by
after
the
fukushima
disaster
in
japan
highlighted
the
risks
of
using
nuclear
energy
in
a
region
prone
to
earthquakes
for
developers
in
europe
where
expanding
offshore
wind
projects
particularly
in
the
north
sea
has
driven
down
costs
taiwan
is
seen
as
a
route
into
asian
markets
such
as
japan
and
south
korea
where
the
technology
is
still
barely
used
denmark
s
orsted
and
germany
s
wpd
were
monday
s
biggest
winners
securing
contracts
to
install
mw
and
gw
of
capacity
respectively
we
see
taiwan
as
a
stepping
stone
into
said
matthias
bausenwein
the
regional
general
manager
for
orsted
the
world
s
largest
owner
of
offshore

taiwan
s
auction
drew
bids
from
the
world
s
biggest
international
players
attracted
by
the
island
s
strong
winds
a
stable
regulatory
framework
and
the
offer
of
power
purchase
agreements
with
a
above
european
benchmarks
we
have
aggressive
targets
in
taiwan
and
with
things
going
on
in
china
south
korea
and
other
markets
that
amounts
to
it
becoming
the
region
globally
said
bausenwein
offshore
wind
power
is
costlier
than
onshore
projects
or
solar
power
and
still
only
accounts
for
about
percent
of
global
wind
energy
capacity
but
europe
has
been
leading
the
way
in
using
the
technology
adding
gw
last
year
and
taking
total
offshore
capacity
to
gw
according
to
the
global
wind
energy
council
costs
have
plunged
as
a
result
in
last
week
s
auction
in
germany
the
world
s
second
biggest
offshore
wind
power
market
some
bids
offered
capacity
with
no
subsidies
in
britain
the
world
s
biggest
market
the
cost
of
wind
power
fell
below
new
nuclear
generation
for
the
first
time
last
year
this
has
been
encouraged
by
an
expanding
regional
grid
greater
ability
to
manage
variable
wind
power
supplies
and
the
growing
scale
of
turbines
expected
to
have
capacity
of
to
mw
each
in
two
or
three
years
roughly
twice
as
powerful
as
today
taiwan
is
not
considering
firms
from
china
the
world
s
third
biggest
offshore
market
and
which
claims
taiwan
as
chinese
territory
chen
director
of
the
energy
technology
division
at
taiwan
s
bureau
of
energy
said
chinese
bids
were
excluded
due
to
concerns
of
national
security
alongside
orsted
and
wpd
other
bidders
included
copenhagen
infrastructure
partners
canada

yushan

a

will
be
allocated

tender
this
summer
monday
s
auction
had
included
an
assessment
of
factors
such
as
the
amount
of
local
content
included
european
firms
want
local
suppliers
to
avoid
the
cost
of
shipping
bulky
equipment
used
in
the
turbines
from
europe
the
requirements
for
local
content
are
increasing
step
by
step
said
andreas
nauen
offshore
chief
executive
for
siemens
gamesa
adding
some
european
equipment
would
initially
be
used
siemens
gamesa
is
working
to
develop
the
port
of
taichung
as
a
regional

and
has
signed
agreements
with
some

maker
vestas
is
also
considering
developing
local
manufacturing
we
want
to
