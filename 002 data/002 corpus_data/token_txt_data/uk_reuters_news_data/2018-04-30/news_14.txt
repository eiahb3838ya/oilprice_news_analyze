pjm will test u.s. mid atlantic/midwest power grid for resiliency
april
reuters
pjm
interconnection
operator
of
the
biggest
power
grid
said
on
monday
it
would
look
for
fuel
security
vulnerabilities
in
its
and
midwest
system
and
if
needed
compensate
generators
for
the
resiliency
their
units
provide
we
do
not
feel
we
have
a
vulnerability
today
but
will
take
a
look
at
the
system
to
see
if
we
could
have
fuel
security
issues
in
the
future
andy
ott
president
and
ceo
of
pjm
said
in
a
conference
call
the
fuel
mix
used
to
generate
power
in
pjm
which
serves
million
people
has
changed
over
the
past
several
years
with
coal
and
nuclear
plants
retiring
as
energy
firms
add
more
natural
gas
and
renewable
units
raising
potential
resilience
risks
beyond
existing
reliability
standards
that
transition
has
caused
economic
pain
for
owners
of
the
retiring
units
like
firstenergy
inc
along
with
concern
by
some
in
the
trump
administration
that
the
grid
is
becoming
more
vulnerable
to
the
loss
of
a
big
gas
pipeline
or
an
extreme
weather
event
firstenergy
in
march
asked
energy
secretary
rick
perry
to
evoke
emergency
powers
to
help
several
struggling
nuclear
and
coal
plants
remain
open
including
units
owned
by
its
firstenergy
solutions
subsidiary
which
sought
bankruptcy
protection
just
days
after
saying
it
would
shut
nuclear
reactors
in
ohio
and
pennsylvania
we
don
t
think
there
is
an
emergency
today
but
we
do
think
these
are
legitimate
questions
to
ask
ott
said
pjm
s
ott
described
potential
fuel
security
issues
as
those
that
could
cut
fuel
supply
to
critical
resources
due
to
extreme
weather
conditions
or
physical
or
cyber
attacks
on
power
plants
and
gas
pipelines
pjm
said
it
plans
to
complete
its
vulnerability
assessment
over
the
next
six
months
the
assessment
will
the
system
under
various
fuel
supply
disruption
scenarios
to
better
understand
potential
future
reliability
concerns
we
have
the
ability
to
identify
risks
to
the
system
and
to
put
a
value
on
resources
that
offset
that
risk
ott
said
noting
certain
generators
with
weeks
of
fuel
on
hand
or
multiple
sources
of
fuel
could
receive
more
money
for
the
resiliency
they
provide
some
coal
plants
for
example
keep
weeks
of
fuel
on
hand
or
have
access
to
mines
on
site
nuclear
plants
can
hold
up
to
two
years
worth
of
fuel
in
their
reactors
some
gas
plants
can
also
burn
oil
and
have
access
to
multiple
pipelines
gas
straight
out
of
the
ground
and
liquefied
natural
gas
supplies
