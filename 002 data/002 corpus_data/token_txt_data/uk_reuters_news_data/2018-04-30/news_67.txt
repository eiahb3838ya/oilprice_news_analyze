the
term
demand
destruction
is
again
entering
the
lexicon
of
the
current
crude
oil
market
as
the
sharp
rise
in
prices
raises
concerns
about
when
do
consumers
start
cutting
back
on
their
fuel
consumption
while
it
s
probably
impossible
to
pick
the
exact
point
at
which
this
happens
the
risk
in
the
current
cycle
of
rising
prices
is
that
it
happens
earlier
than
in
the
past
in
asia
the
main
region
driving
rising
crude
demand
the
reason
for
this
is
that
many
countries
in
asia
used
the
prior
period
of
falling
crude
prices
to
end
or
dramatically
scale
back
their
fuel
subsidies
this
means
that
this
time
consumers
in
countries
such
as
india
indonesia
and
malaysia
are
fully
exposed
to
rising
crude
prices
something
that
hasn
t
been
in
the
case
in
previous
bull
cycles
the
combined
oil
consumption
of
those
three
countries
is
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
with
india
alone
accounting
for
about
million
bpd
even
a
percent
drop
in
demand
for
fuel
in
those
countries
would
knock
about
bpd
from
global
crude
oil
consumption
so
far
it
appears
that
consumers
in
those
countries
haven
t
been
exposed
to
the
full
extent
of
the
crude
oil
increase
global
benchmark
brent
crude
closed
at
a
barrel
on
april
up
percent
since
the
end
of
last
year
and
percent
from
last
year
s
low
in
june
the
price
of
a
litre
of
diesel
in
new
delhi
was
rupees
on
sunday
according
to
data
on
the
website
of
indian
oil
this
is
equivalent
to
about
a
litre
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
price
of
a
litre
of
diesel
was
rupees
meaning
it
has
risen
by
percent
so
far
this
year
not
quite
keeping
pace
with
the
rise
in
brent
crude
oil
when
crude
was
at
its
low
in
june
diesel
was
rupees
a
litre
in
new
delhi
meaning
it
has
risen
about
percent
since
then
while
brent
has
jumped
by
percent
what
appears
to
have
happened
is
that
the
oil
majors
such
as
indian
oil
have
largely
absorbed
the
cost
of
rising
crude
prices
partly
because
of
government
pressure
to
do
so
but
there
has
to
be
a
question
mark
as
to
how
long
this
can
continue
to
be
the
case
indian
oil
s
share
price
has
plunged
percent
since
its
high
reached
in
august
and
there
will
likely
come
a
point
where
the
pain
of
the
slumping
stock
price
outweighs
the
political
pressure
to
keep
absorbing
the
cost
of
higher
crude
oil
prices
there
is
also
some
preliminary
evidence
that
india
s
appetite
for
crude
oil
is
levelling
off
with
imports
trending
lower
so
far
this
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
for
the
first
days
of
april
the
data
which
has
been
filtered
to
show
only
cargoes
that
have
been
discharged
show
imports
running
at
million
bpd
this
is
down
from
million
bpd
in
march
million
bpd
in
february
and
million
bpd
in
january
while
there
may
be
some
seasonal
slowing
in
india
s
crude
demand
it
s
worth
noting
that
april
this
year
appears
to
be
slightly
weaker
than
the
million
bpd
imported
in
the
same
month
in
in
indonesia
which
ended
gasoline
subsidies
in
and
lowered
the
diesel
subsidy
to
rupiah
cents
per
litre
in
retail
prices
also
haven
t
risen
by
as
much
as
the
price
of
crude
oil
diesel
was
about
the
equivalent
of
about
cents
a
litre
last
week
up
from
cents
at
the
start
of
the
year
according
to
data
on
the
website
similar
to
india
this
means
indonesian
consumers
have
only
been
partially
slugged
the
increase
in
the
price
of
crude
oil
meaning
the
fuel
retailer
has
been
absorbing
the
difference
via
shrinking
profit
margins
again
how
much
longer
this
can
continue
is
uncertain
but
one
would
imagine
at
some
point
rising
crude
prices
will
have
to
be
reflected
in
higher
retail
prices
for
diesel
and
gasoline
even
when
retail
fuel
prices
do
rise
picking
the
exact
level
at
which
consumers
cut
back
on
usage
either
directly
by
driving
or
flying
less
or
indirectly
by
purchasing
fewer
goods
and
services
as
they
divert
income
to
rising
fuel
bills
is
a
challenge
and
will
vary
from
country
to
country
but
the
absence
of
fuel
subsidies
in
most
asian
nations
is
likely
to
mean
the
region
feels
the
pain
of
the
jump
in
crude
prices
far
faster
than
was
the
case
