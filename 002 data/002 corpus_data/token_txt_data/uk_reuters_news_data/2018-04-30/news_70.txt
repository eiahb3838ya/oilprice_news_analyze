oil
prices
edged
lower
on
monday
as
a
rising
rig
count
in
the
united
states
pointed
to
higher
production
but
prices
held
near
more
than
highs
and
were
on
track
to
rise
for
a
second
consecutive
month
the
oil
complex
has
been
driven
by
supply
concerns
amid
prospects
of
the
united
states
reimposing
sanctions
on
iran

about

from

there
s
a
small
drop
in

this
morning
but
volumes
are
low
and
there
s
not
much
commitment
in
the
selling
the
overall
trend
is
positive
and
there
s
potential
for
the

to

today
said
michael

at

markets
the
underlying
strength
in
crude
markets
is
quite
impressive
and
a
lot
of
it
is
predicated
by
sanctions
other
than
that
it
s
the
demand
picture
around
the
globe
and
if
that
continues
we
could
see

the

however
the
increase
in

was
modest
and
this

is
overshadowed
by
other
things
