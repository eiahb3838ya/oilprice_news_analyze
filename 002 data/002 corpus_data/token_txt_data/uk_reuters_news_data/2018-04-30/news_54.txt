uk, u.s. study antarctic glacier, hoping to crack sea level risks
oslo
reuters
britain
and
the
united
states
launched
a
million
project
on
monday
to
study
the
risks
of
a
collapse
of
a
giant
glacier
in
antarctica
that
is
already
shrinking
and
nudging
up
global
sea
levels
the
research
involving
scientists
would
be
the
two
nations
biggest
joint
scientific
project
in
antarctica
since
the
ice
is
thawing
from
greenland
to
antarctica
and
global
warming
is
accelerating
the
trend
the
scientists
would
study
the
thwaites
glacier
which
is
roughly
the
size
of
florida
or
britain
in
west
antarctica
the
uk
natural
environment
research
council
and
national
science
foundation
said
in
a
joint
statement
rising
sea
levels
are
a
globally
important
issue
which
can
not
be
tackled
by
one
country
alone
uk
science
minister
sam
gyimah
said
thwaites
and
the
nearby
pine
island
glacier
are
two
of
the
biggest
and
glaciers
in
antarctica
if
both
abruptly
collapsed
allowing
ice
far
inland
to
flow
faster
into
the
oceans
world
sea
levels
could
rise
by
more
than
a
meter
feet
threatening
cities
from
shanghai
to
san
francisco
and
coastal
regions
the
scientists
would
deploy
planes
hot
water
drills
satellite
measurements
ships
and
robot
submarines
to
one
of
the
remotest
parts
of
the
planet
to
see
whether
the
glacier
s
collapse
could
begin
in
the
next
few
decades
or
centuries
the
statement
said
despite
satellites
there
are
still
many
aspects
of
the
ice
and
ocean
that
can
not
be
determined
from
space
said
ted
scambos
of
the
national
snow
and
ice
data
center
and
the
lead
scientific
coordinator
other
scientists
from
south
korea
germany
sweden
new
zealand
and
finland
would
also
contribute
the
united
states
is
keeping
up
research
even
though
president
donald
trump
doubts
mainstream
scientific
findings
that
human
activities
led
by
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
are
the
main
cause
of
global
warming
