proposed
of
innogy
its
assets
will
be
divided
between

rwe
and
which
would
take
over
npower
potentially
raising
regulatory
concerns
some
analysts
said
on
monday
sse
and
npower
said
last
year
they
would
merge
their
retail
gas
and
power
operations
combining
some
million
customers
to
better
challenge
british
gas
uncertainty
over
the
merger
plan
hit
sse
shares
on
monday
they
were
down
percent
to
pence
per
share
at

underperforming
the
wider
ftse
index
britain
s
competition
and
markets
authority
cma
which
is
expected
to
make
an
initial
decision
by
april
on
the
planned
merger
said
on
monday
it
will
be
engaging
with
both
sse
and
innogy
to
consider
the
implications
of
the
new
german
deal
the
deal
the
cma
has
been
looking
at
is
between
innogy
s
npower
and
sse
but
now
if
npower
is
owned
by
that
s
three
of
the
big
six
energy
suppliers
involved
jefferies
analyst
ahmed
farman
told
reuters
britain
s
big
six
energy
suppliers
control
around
percent
of
the
retail
energy
market
the
other
three
suppliers
are
centrica
s
british
gas
edf
energy
and
iberdrola
s
scottish
power
it
could
potentially
complicate
things
from
a
regulatory
point
of
view
farman
added
innogy
rwe
and
sse
have
not
commented
on
how
the
transaction
could
impact
the
british
merger
which
would
create
a
new
retail
company
with
sse
shareholders
holding
percent
and
innogy
percent
but
innogy
said
on
monday
the
joint
venture
with
sse
has
great
strategic
importance
for
the
group
adding
the
deal
had
been
filed
with
british
antitrust
bodies
and
was
expected
to
close
late
this
year
or
early
in
one
solution
to
potential
regulatory
hurdles
could
be
for
to
sell
down
its
innogy
share
in
the
new
company
said
peter
atherton
an
associate
at
consultancy
cornwall
insight
we
haven
t
seen
any
indication
wants
to
do
that
but
if
it
the
merger
is
a
stumbling
block
for
the
wider
deal
then
that
is
a
logical
solution
he
said
has
not
given
any
further
details
on
its
plans
for
npower
but
said
it
intends
to
take
on
innogy
s
retail
business
innogy
managers
speaking
at
the
group
s
annual
news
conference
said
the
uk
market
environment
remained
difficult
despite
innogy
having
cut
prices
and
invested
efforts
in
stemming
customer
losses
