plans
to
carve
up
innogy
between
parent
rwe
and
fellow
utility
are
unlikely
to
be
disrupted
by
rival
bidders
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
planned
transaction
people
close
to
the
matter
said
rwe
which
owns
percent
of
innogy
had
also
already
explored
alternative
combinations
but
without
reaching
agreement
further
reducing
the
chances
of
the
deal
now
being
challenged
the
transaction
announced
on
sunday
will
sharpen
the
corporate
focus
of
rwe
which
will
become
one
of
europe
s
largest
renewable
players
and
create
one
of
the
continent
s
top
grids
and
energy
retail
players
under
the
umbrella
of
the
chance
of
a
rival
bidder
coming
in
is
at
best
percent
one
of
the
people
said
adding
that
it
would
be
hard
for
any
potential
interloper
to
offer
an
attractive
mix
of
assets
to
both
rwe
and
rwe
had
been
in
talks
with
european
peers
including
engie
and
enel
over
the
last
year
on
a
potential
transaction
and
was
even
close
to
reaching
a
deal
with
iberdrola
in
late
the
sources
said
it
was
a
competitive
process
one
of
the
sources
said
adding
that
rwe
had
decided
to
strike
the
deal
with
after
considering
proposals
from
peers
one
source
said
australia
s
macquarie
had
also
been
in
the
race
while
asset
swaps
had
been
discussed
with
other
european
companies
too
rwe
never
felt
comfortable
with
taking
on
large
exposure
to
southern
europe
the
people
said
citing
forays
into
the
region
by
during
the
last
decade
a
german
deal
was
also
seen
as
having
better
chances
to
receive
political
backing
chancellor
angela
merkel
welcomed
the
deal
and
said
she
had
faith
in
germany
s
utilities
to
find
the
best
way
to
adapt
to
the
country
s
energy
shift
dubbed
energiewende
under
merkel
germany
decided
to
phase
out
nuclear
power
by
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
disaster
at
the
fukushima
plant
in
japan
dealing
a
major
blow
to
and
rwe
and
forcing
a
strategy
rethink
while
the
two
companies
were
in
touch
with
each
other
over
the
last
year
concrete
negotiations
about
innogy
only
picked
up
this
year
the
sources
said
former
innogy
chief
executive
peter
terium
left
the
company
in
late
following
a
profit
warning
but
people
close
to
the
matter
said
that
the
real
reason
for
his
departure
was
his
opposition
to
the
asset
swap
despite
being
an
internal
german
deal
the
asset
swap
of
rwe
and
could
accelerate
the
consolidation
of
the
energy
sector
in
europe
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
industry
inevitably
there
are
going
to
be
movements
the
ceos
of
the
energy
companies
could
get
nervous
with
this
deal
the
person
said
adding
that
the
deal
would
also
potentially
open
up
opportunities
to
snap
up
assets
that
rwe
and
have
to
sell
to
get
regulatory
clearance
for
their
deal
