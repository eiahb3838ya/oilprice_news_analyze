india
has
moved
to
quickly
scale
up
its
use
of
renewable
power
in
the
year
modi
took
office
india
had
gigawatts
of
solar
power
by
the
end
of
it
had
nearly
times
that
or
gw
according
to
industry
tracker
bridge
to
india
a
renewable
energy
consultancy
now
india
wants
to
quintuple
that
total
by
a
goal
once
seen
as
hugely
ambitious
but
now
considered
within
reach
by
energy
experts
progress
is
clearly
happening
quickly
during
alone
india
doubled
its
installed
solar
capacity
from
gw
to
gw
india
is
going
to
maintain
and
accelerate
the
momentum
it
will
move
to
be
the
number
two
player
in
the
next
year
or

finance
studies
at
the
institute
for

economics
and
financial
analysis
ieefa
a
think
tank
in
india
added
the
third
largest
amount
of
national
solar
capacity
just
behind
the
and
china
and
was
overtaking
japan
according
to
ieefa
research
now
in
partnership
with
france
india
wants
to
take
its
growing
resources
and
knowledge
on
solar
power
and
use
it
to
help
other
sunny
countries
jumpstart
their
solar
ambitions
as
well
on
sunday
in
new
delhi
modi
and
the
french
president
emmanuel
macron
hosted
the
launch
of
a
solar
energy
partnership
that
aims
to
build
a
network
to
help
tropical
countries
around
the
world
boost
their
use
of
solar
power
in
the
vedas
ancient
hindu
texts
the
sun
was
thought
to
be
the
world
s
soul
in
india
the
sun
was
thought
of
as
the
nurturer
of
all
life
modi
said
at
the
launch
of
the
international
solar
alliance
isa
these
days
when
we
are
looking
for
a
way
to
combat
climate
change
we
must
look
to
this
ancient
perspective
he
said
as
part
of
the
alliance
india
will
offer
financial
support
to
help
with
solar
projects
in
other
countries
the
prime
minister
said
macron
said
france
also
will
commit
million
euros
to
the
alliance
upendra
tripathy
the
director
general
of
the
new
alliance
said
it
aims
solar
power
in
many
more
countries
everyone
has
access
to
the
sun
but
in
terms
of
ability
to
exploit
solar
energy
that
is
not
equal
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
with
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
credit
is
a
challenge
skillset
is
a
challenge
the
fundamental
issue
is
do
all
member
countries
have
equal
ability
to
exploit
solar
energy
isa
plans
to
address
that
issue
in
part
by
creating
a
larger
global
market
for
solar
technology
that
would
benefit
smaller
countries
by
aggregating
the
risk
and
the
demand
tripathy
said
the
alliance
an
effort
to
advance
the
paris
climate
agreement
aims
to
become
a
network
of
countries
he
said
currently
countries
are
full
members
and
another
are
on
their
way
to
full
membership
many
are
developing
nations
india
s
solar
push
is
in
part
boosted
by
steadily
dropping
costs
of
providing
solar
energy
to
produce
a
unit
of
solar
power
now
costs
rupees
a
cost
similar
to
that
of
more
traditional
energy
sources
said
kanika
chawla
the
senior
programme
lead
at
the
council
on
energy
environment
and
water
a
partner
organisation
of
the
isa
india
s
transition
to
renewable
energy
without
shutting
down
its
power
plants
represents
a
new
model
for
developing
countries
going
forward
chawla
said
in
a
telephone
interview
but
india
still
gets
about
of
its
power
from
coal
although
that
is
expected
to
fall
to
below
percent
by
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
india
s
power
providers
largely
public
companies
are
heavily
in
debt
and
as
a
result
many
companies
generating
solar
power
are
not
being
paid
on
time
chawla
said
india
s
government
also
is
considering
a
percent
tariff
on
solar
imports
to
protect
india
s
solar
manufacturers
something
that
is
causing
a
lot
of
uncertainty
as
investors
try
to
bring
new
solar
projects
into
the
country
buckley
said
other
issues
for
the
nation
s
solar
include
the
tricky
business
of
figuring
out
how
to
integrate
renewables
into
the
existing
electricity
grid
and
the
lack
of
a
business
model
for
such
utilities
a
problem
other
countries
using
solar
energy
also
face
chawla
said
all
of
these
issues
have
contributed
to
a
slowdown
in
the
pace
at
which
solar
projects
are
being
commissioned
in
india
she
said
but
what
the
renewable
energy
future
holds
for
the
south
asian
giant
will
be
critical
for
the
world
climate
change
experts
say
as
china
s
economic
growth
slows
india
s
is
heating
up
along
with
its
energy
demand
india
is
today
the
top
contributor
to
growth
in
energy
demand
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
it
s
worth
acknowledging
the
indian
market
and
economy
is
still
significantly
smaller
than
china
and
it
will
be
for
some
time
to
come
buckley
said
however
india
is
very
much
wedded
to
the
energy
transformation
it
s
coming
straight
from
the
prime
minister
and
the
energy
minister
and
the
coal
minister
are
very
much
onboard
he
said
and
especially
with
the
leaving
the
paris
agreement
there
s
a
perceived
void
that
some
country
needs
to
fill
and
the
international
solar
alliance
is
a
clever
way
of
signaling
climate
leadership
