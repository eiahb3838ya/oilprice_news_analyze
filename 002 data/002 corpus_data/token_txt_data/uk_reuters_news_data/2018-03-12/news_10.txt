bogota
reuters
a
significant
lead
in
votes
for
colombian
candidate
ivan
duque
over
leftist
gustavo
petro
in
presidential
primaries
pushed
the
peso
up
against
the
dollar
on
monday
as
investors
bet
duque
would
be
more
business
friendly
that
the
former
guerrilla
candidate
petro
s
promise
of
a
social
economy
that
would
raise
taxes
and
shift
away
from
oil
colombia
s
top
export
towards
agriculture
has
worried
investors
in
the
andean
nation
as
opinion
polls
showed
the
former
member
of
the
disbanded
guerrilla
group
and
of
bogota
running
ahead
of
duque
parties
will
likely
now
look
to
form
alliances
before
the
may
election
to
replace
president
juan
manuel
santos
if
no
candidate
gets
more
than
percent
of
the
vote
a
second
round
will
be
held
in
june
sunday
s
primaries
in
which
duque
won
almost
percent
more
votes
than
petro
did
were
considered
a
better
test
of
voter
support
than
often
inaccurate
opinion
polls
although
some
voters
will
have
participated
strategically
and
may
not
back
either
winner
in
the
presidential
vote
more
than
million
votes
were
cast
in
the
primary
and
million
in
the
contest
while
all
candidates
advocate
clamping
down
on
corruption
and
investment
in
education
and
health
the
two
top
pollers
differ
in
their
views
on
a
peace
deal
with
marxist
farc
rebels
duque
supported
by
former
president
alvaro
uribe
and
his
democratic
center
party
backs
foreign
investment
and
an
aggressive
security
strategy
meant
to
combat
colombia
s
remaining
rebel
group
which
regularly
kidnaps
and
bombs
oil
pipelines
he
has
been
vocal
in
his
opposition
to
the
farc
accord
which
could
stymie
implementation
if
he
wins
petro
and
his
colombia
humana
party
pledges
to
improve
conditions
for
the
poor
ban
open
pit
mining
and
use
clean
energy
voters
also
elected
a
new
congress
while
no
party
came
close
to
winning
control
of
either
legislature
the
democratic
center
party
came
out
on
top
in
the
senate
with
seats
and
second
in
the
lower
house
with
seats
petro
s
decencia
coalition
won
just
four
senate
seats
and
only
two
seats
in
the
lower
house
there
s
now
sure
to
be
at
the
presidential
level
a
shake
out
of
candidates
over
the
coming
weeks
as
we
approach
the
first
round
petro
can
t
yet
be
completely
discounted
but
he
looks
further
from
his
goal
today
compared
with
friday
said
rupert
stebbings
managing
director
of
equities
at
grupo
bancolombia
the
peso
cop
stfx
strengthened
percent
against
the
dollar
to
and
local
treasury
bonds
rose
to
yield
percent
from
friday
s
close
of
percent
the
peso
and
bonds
markets
are
much
more
liquid
than
the
stock
market
which
is
heavily
dependent
on
oil
prices
and
shares
of
oil
company
ecopetrol
the
fact
that
the
centre
right
has
won
that
doesn
t
represent
a
political
change
for
the
markets
said

though
fajardo
is
considered
duque
and
vargas
lleras
from
the
radical
change
party
have
strong
party
machines
behind
them
