officials
from
southwest
china
s
yunnan
province
have
defended
a
plan
to
build
a
dam
in
the
region
as
fully
legally
compliant
after
an
environment
group
took
developers
of
the
project
to
court
last
month
for
violating
laws
the
friends
of
nature
had
filed
a
suit
against
the
huilong
mountain
hydropower
plant
on
the
mekong
river
in
rural
xishuangbanna
near
the
myanmar
border
saying
it
would
destroy
rain
forest
and
encroach
upon
nature
reserves
in
the
project
we
discovered
several
serious
problems
said
zhang
boju
the
group
s
executive
director
looking
at
them
from
current
legislation
we
saw
they
could
be
considered
in
breach
of
the
but
xishuangbanna
governor
luo
hongjiang
said
in
a
statement
sent
to
reuters
during
the
latest
session
of
china
s
parliament
that
construction
was
fully
legally
compliant
since
approval
was
granted
in
various
laws
related
to
the
development
and
utilisation
of
hydropower
environmental
protection
fish
habitats
in
the
lancang
mekong
river
basin
management
of
nature
reserves
and
so
on
have
been
strictly
implemented
he
added
china
resources
power
the
developer
leading
the
project
did
not
respond
to
questions
about
the
project
hydropower
has
been
at
the
heart
of
china
s
efforts
to
cut
its
dependence
on
coal
and
it
promised
in
guidelines
published
last
week
that
it
would
speed
up
in
the
southwest
this
year
and
add
another
gigawatts
of
capacity
but
projects
in
the
region
including
the
world
s
biggest
at
the
three
gorges
have
been
responsible
for
flooding
fragile
ecosystems
displacing
millions
and
worsening
earthquake
risks
the
mekong
and
the
salween
rivers
also
flow
into
myanmar
and
thailand
raising
concerns
about
downstream
water
disruptions
grid
deficiencies
and
weak
local
demand
have
also
meant
that
yunnan
s
existing
plants
run
at
less
than
optimal
levels
yunnan
s
governor
ruan
chengfa
said
last
week
the
province
was
in
pain
because
of
weak
grid
coverage
we
are
not
using
green
energy
to
the
full
and
we
are
suffering
about
billion
of
wasted
hydro
every
several
projects
including
a
series
of
dams
on
the
salween
have
been
shelved
because
of
grid
deficiencies
resolving
grid
issues
will
take
time
said
stephanie
ngo
international
rivers
china
program
director
it
would
be
foolish
for
the
local
government
to
continue
to
build
dams
before
having
fully
addressed
these
friends
of
nature
s
zhang
said
local
authorities
were
underestimating
the
costs
of
hydro
and
exaggerating
benefits
we
think
if
yunnan
continues
plans
to
develop
as
a
green
power
and
energy
base
with
hydropower
at
its
core
it
will
probably
be
in
violation
of
the
central
government
s
policies
and
curbs
