fell

for

weeks
gross
short
positions
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
climbed
to
their
highest
in
nearly
a
month
that
has
undercut
some
of
the
enthusiasm
for
oil
as
investors
weigh
increased
supply
against
the
likelihood
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
will
maintain
supply
cuts
that
have
been
in
effect
for
more
than
a
year
the
market
continues
to
flip
back
and
forth
on
the
idea
that
increased
global
demand
and
a
production
cut
is
going
to
support
prices
but
production
and
north
american
production
levels
in
general
is
going
to
negate
a
lot
of
the
impact
of
that

said
on
friday
that
energy
companies
last

cut
oil
rigs
for
the
first
time
in
almost
two
months
still
the

is
now

s
no

ahead
of

saudi

we
are
maintaining
a
bearish

stance
in
anticipation
of
a
range
in
nearby
wti
between

and
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
while
friday
s
favorable
jobs
data
and
oil
rig
decline
might
suggest
a
test
of
the
high
side
of
this
expected
range
first
we
still
view

exceeding
that
to

saudi

said
they
would
be
delaying
the
initial
public
offering
of

aramco
until
this
week
s

release
given
its
potential
impact
on
the
dollar
could
be
critical
said
bill
baruch
president
of
blue
line
futures
in
chicago
the
dollar
tends
to
have
an
inverse
relationship
with
oil
prices
as
a
weaker
greenback
makes
commodities
cheaper
for
holders
of
other
currencies
