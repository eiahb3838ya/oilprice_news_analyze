oil
prices
regained
some
ground
on
monday
afternoon
but
remained
down
as
investors
grappled
with
persisting
concerns
about
rising
output
while
demand
for
treasuries
stayed
strong
despite
increased
supply
crude
prices
rose
on
friday
after
the
economy
added
the
biggest
number
of
jobs
in
more
than
years
in
february
but
crude
fell
as
much
as
percent

bouncing
back

energy
investors
are
weighing
increased
supply
against
the
likelihood
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
maintain
supply
cuts
that
have
been
in
effect
more
than
a
year
the
market
continues
to
flip
back
and
forth
on
the
idea
that
increased
global
demand
and
a
production
cut
is
going
to
support
prices
but
production
and
north
american
production
levels
in
general
is
going
to
negate
a
lot
of
the
impact
of
that

that
is
not
far
off
the

yield
on
the
highest
since
the

yielded
more
than

in

the
treasury
on
monday
sold
billion
of
notes
and
billion
of

in
what
analyst
george
goncalves
called
an
type
increased
supply
did
not
quell

for
