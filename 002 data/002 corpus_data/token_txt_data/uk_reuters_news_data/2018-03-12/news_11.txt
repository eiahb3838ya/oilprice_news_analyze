an
deal
to
split
innogy
between
rwe
and
looks
set
to
create
a
template
for
european
utilities
m
a
that
includes
the
demise
of
the
integrated
model
no
more
big
deals
and
a
quest
for
emerging
market
growth
under
the
deal
announced
on
sunday
german
utility
rwe
will
combine
the
renewables
businesses
of
rival
with
innogy
s
while
will
acquire
innogy
s
regulated
energy
networks
and
customer
operations
the
deal
continues
the
of
and
rwe
which
were
two
vertically
integrated
utilities
before
they
split
their
renewables
and
grids
from
their
thermal
generation
assets
with
set
to
sell
its
stake
in
thermal
generation
unit
uniper
to
finland
s
fortum
this
year
and
rwe
will
be
left
with
the
only
assets
that
still
make
money
in
europe
s
power
industry
subsidised
renewables
and
regulated
networks
germany
s
switch
from
nuclear
to
renewables
after
the
fukushima
disaster
in
and
european
union
support
for
renewable
energy
created
huge
overcapacity
that
is
pricing
thermal
and
generation
out
of
the
market
in
response
rwe
s
and
s
first
two
years
ago
were
about
getting
out
of
traditional
generation
now
even
highly
integrated
utilities
like
france
s
edf
and
czech
republic
s
cez
have
been
presented
with
scenarios
european
utilities
are
increasingly
specialising
in
one
part
of
the
value
chain
said
colette
lewiner
energy
adviser
to
the
chairman
of
capgemini
a
consultancy
she
said
this
might
be
partly
because
spot
markets
set
the
power
price
and
thus
integrate
the
value
chain
from
power
generation
to
electricity
retailing
the
innogy
deal
is
also
notable
for
its
lack
of
foreign
utilities
involvement
before
the
financial
crisis
european
utilities
were
in
a
dealmaking
frenzy
all
seeking
to
buy
footholds
in
other
european
countries
but
most
of
those
deals
fell
through
or
turned
sour
and
now
only
a
few
eu
utilities
have
a
significant
presence
in
other
eu
countries
investment
bankers
had
floated
enel
iberdrola
or
engie
as
potential
buyers
of
innogy
but
none
of
them
materialised
as
bidders
electricity
unlike
oil
and
gas
is
difficult
to
transport
which
is
why
utilities
never
went
global
and
besides
the
physics
politics
too
has
played
a
part
in
crimping
deals
a
decade
ago
the
eu
tried
to
drive
politics
out
of
utilities
with
a
push
for
privatisation
and
the
unbundling
of
grids
but
politics
has
returned
via
the
back
door
germany
s
nuclear
exit
spain
s
unwinding
of
renewables
subsidies
and
britain
s
threat
of
price
caps
all
show
the
extent
to
which
utilities
dance
to
governments
regulatory
tunes
roland
vetter
chief
investment
officer
at
praxis
partners
said
that
besides
valuation
and
the
lack
of
synergies
politics
was
a
major
reason
for
foreign
utilities
not
buying
innogy
the
moment
you
own
these
businesses
you
are
involved
in
german
politics
already
is
for
them
it
is
not
an
issue
he
said
german
companies
have
some
impact
on
politicians
but
not
foreigners
he
said
if
say
iberdrola
buys
a
german
company
there
is
no
protection
only
vetter
expects
no
further
major
m
a
deals
neither
or
on
a
regional
scale
that
is
not
to
say
there
will
be
no
smaller
deals
in
a
bid
to
innovate
utilities
are
buying
dozens
of
small
to
companies
in
new
business
areas
such
as
electric
vehicle
charging
insulation
smart
meters
and
energy
services
utilities
will
also
continue
investing
in
emerging
markets
which
have
huge
power
needs
and
more
liberal
regulation
as
new
market
entrants
steal
their
customers
at
home
european
utilities
have
no
choice
but
to
go
seek
growth
where
they
can
find
it
