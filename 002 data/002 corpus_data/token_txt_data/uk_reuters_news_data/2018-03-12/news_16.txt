oil
prices
were
down
on
monday
as
investors
grappled
with
ongoing
concerns
over
rising
output
and
tight
opec
supply
while
the
benchmark

hovered

ahead
of
an
auction
later

crude
prices
had
risen
on
friday
and
earlier
on
monday
after
the
economy
added
the
biggest
number
of
jobs
in
more
than
years
in
february
but
the
trend
began
to
reverse
later
in
the
day
investors
are
weighing
increased
supply
against
the
likelihood
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
will
maintain
supply
cuts
that
have
been
in
effect
more
than
a
year
the
market
continues
to
flip
back
and
forth
on
the
idea
that
increased
global
demand
and
a
production
cut
is
going
to
support
prices
but
production
and
north
american
production
levels
in
general
is
going
to
negate
a
lot
of
the
impact
of

the
treasury
department
will
auction
billion
in
notes
on
monday
as
well
as
billion
in
notes
a
high
yield
going
into
auction
could
limit
demand
from
bidders
at
that
level
widening
the
spread
between
the
expected
high
yield
when
the
auction
starts
versus
the
actual
high
yield
during
the
auction
a
wider
spread
is
called
a
tail
and
indicates
weaker

referring
to

if

you
ll
see
a
repeat
of
that
last
