update 1-oil producer norway starts wage talks to avert widespread strikes
oslo
reuters
norwegian
employers
and
labor
unions
embarked
on
four
weeks
of
wage
talks
on
monday
to
stave
off
widespread
strikes
that
risk
impacting
output
in
western
europe
s
biggest
crude
producer
unlike
most
years
in
which
wages
are
set
on
an
basis
to
reduce
complexity
the
round
rolls
a
majority
of
private
sector
firms
into
a
single
negotiation
in
a
bid
to
resolve
a
over
pension
reform
we
ve
understood
that
there
is
no
real
will
among
employers
to
compromise
from
the
outset
labor
union
negotiator
asle
reime
who
will
represent
oil
workers
told
reuters
ahead
of
the
talks
pension
rights
are
important
to
all
workers
regardless
of
which
industry
they
are
in
that
s
why
i
think
there
is
more
weight
behind
the
demands
this
year
and
also
more
willingness
to
strike
he
added
while
employers
are
willing
to
discuss
an
increase
in
pay
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
meet
demands
for
better
pensions
and
change
in
compensation

told
reporters
if
initial
talks
break
down
a
mediator
will
attempt
to
broker
a
deal
in
the
final
days
leading
up
to
an
april
deadline
after
which
most
workers
are
allowed
to
go
on
strike
unless
an
agreement
is
found
a
few
days
in
advance
labour
unions
must
name
the
companies
that
would
be
hit
in
a
first
wave
of
industrial
action
making
it
difficult
to
predict
how
extensive
an
initial
could
be
while
norway
s
production
of
oil
and
natural
gas
is
unlikely
to
be
targeted
from
the
start
since
the
contract
for
rig
workers
is
valid
until
june
unions
may
still
hit
the
sector
by
shutting
down
yards
and
other
suppliers
onshore
processing
and
export
facilities
for
natural
gas
are
also
at
risk
of
strike
unions
said
while

could
become
involved

extended
