london
reuters
companies
in
britain
and
the
european
union
face
an
extra
billion
pounds
billion
in
annual
costs
if
there
is
a
brexit
with
britain
s
vast
financial
sector
set
to
be
the
industry
according
to
a
report
on
monday
firms
across
the
eu
s
countries
other
than
britain
will
have
to
pay
billion
pounds
a
year
in
tariff
and
barriers
if
britain
leaves
the
bloc
without
a
deal
the
report
by
oliver
wyman
management
consultants
and
law
firm
clifford
chance
said
in
return
british
exporters
to
the
eu
will
have
to
pay
billion
pounds
a
year
these
increased
costs
and
uncertainty
threaten
to
reduce
profitability
and
pose
existential
threats
to
some
businesses
the
report
said
britain
is
due
to
leave
the
eu
next
year
after
voting
in
favor
of
ending
more
than
four
decades
of
political
economic
and
legal
ties
with
the
world
s
largest
trading
bloc
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
trade
between
britain
and
the
other
eu
members
would
default
to
world
trade
organization
rules
and
tariffs
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
access
the
uk
has
enjoyed
as
a
member
of
the
eu
s
single
market
although
britain
wants
a
deal
the
government
says
it
is
preparing
for
any
outcome
including
the
chance
that
britain
could
crash
out
of
the
bloc
without
a
deal
it
has
set
aside
billion
pounds
to
prepare
for
all
eventualities
if
britain
stays
in
a
form
of
a
customs
union
it
would
reduce
the
costs
for
both
sides
by
about
half
the
report
said
however
prime
minister
theresa
may
has
ruled
out
keeping
britain
in
an
eu
customs
union
because
it
would
prevent
the
country
from
striking
its
own
trade
deals
with
economies
such
as
china
and
india
monday
s
report
showed
percent
of
the
extra
costs
in
britain
from
a
brexit
would
be
shared
by
five
industries
financial
services
cars
agriculture
and
food
and
drink
consumer
goods
and
chemicals
and
plastics
financial
services
firms
in
britain
would
suffer
the
biggest
hit
because
unlike
some
automotive
and
aerospace
firms
that
can
switch
to
domestic
suppliers
of
components
they
will
have
to
set
up
new
operations
in
the
eu
to
continue
serving
clients
goldman
sachs
and
ubs
said
last
week
they
were
starting
to
transfer
some
bankers
to
frankfurt
in
preparation
for
britain
s
exit
from
the
eu
the
bank
of
england
has
warned
that
about
finance
jobs
may
leave
britain
by
the
end
of
next
year
because
of
brexit
however
top
investment
banks
are
currently
planning
to
hire
far
more
people
in
london
than
anywhere
else
in
europe
in
the
eu
the
hardest
hit
sector
would
be
the
automotive
sector
agriculture
and
food
and
drinks
chemicals
and
plastics
consumer
goods
and
industrials
