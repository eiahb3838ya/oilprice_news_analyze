the

almost
fully
priced
for

and
leaning
towards
a
further
move
before
a
policy
meeting
by
the
bank
of
japan
on
tuesday
has
taken
on
greater
importance
amid
talk
it
could
tweak
its
massive
campaign
elias
haddad
a
senior
currency
strategist
at
commonwealth
bank
of
australia
doubted
the
boj
would
move
just
yet
but
felt
it
may
abandon
the
negative
interest
rate
applied
to
accounts
held
by
financial
institutions
at
the
central
bank
the
boj
could
also
modify
its
annual
objective
of
accumulating
trillion
yen
billion
of
japanese
government
bonds
as
well
as
potentially
lifting
its
target
yield
for
jgbs
those
yields
recorded
the
highest
close
since
january
last
week
any
of
these
policy
changes
would
be
interpreted
as
a
step
towards
less
monetary
policy
accommodation
dragging
lower
haddad
said
just
the
chance
of
such
a
shift
has
sent
the
yen
higher
in
the
last
week
or
so
pulling
the
dollar
down
to
around
yen
from
a
peak
of
earlier
in
the
month
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
was
hovering
at
having
repeatedly
failed
to
clear
resistance
around
this
month
the
euro
has
had
problems
of
its
own
as
the
european
central
bank
emphasised
that
rates
would
not
be
rising
until
the
second
half
of
next
year
on
monday
the
euro
was
flat
at
corralled
between
support
around

resistance

be
on

yuan
after
it
suffered
its
longest
weekly
losing
streak
since
november
it
hit
a
low
at
per
dollar
last
week
in
commodity
markets
oil
prices

supported
by

tensions
