with
a
flash
of
green
light
a
robot
sputters
and
whizzes
across
the
room
obeying
the
remote
control
commands
xaviera
nguefo
and
her
team
send
its
way
it
is
a
scene
that
would
not
look
out
of
place
in
a
futuristic
fantasy
but
is
instead
playing
out
in
yaounde
the
dusty
capital
of
cameroon
with
its
potholed
streets
and
frequent
power
outages
in
a
country
where
one
in
four
girls
do
not
even
learn
to
read
xaviera
one
of
about
young
cameroonians
studying
at
the
nextgen
centre
in
yaounde
is
picking
up
the
basics
of
artificial
intelligence
i
love
doing
that
because
the
physics
that
they
teach
us
at
school
is
all
applied
here
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
and
it
makes
me
a
little
bit
smarter
the
centre
is
the
brainchild
of
janet
fofang
a
pioneering
scientist
and
teacher
who
aims
to
train
the
future
tech
innovators
of
her
country
with
a
particular
focus
on
its
girls
it
enables
young
cameroonians
to
learn
to
write
code
make
robots
and
acquire
advanced
computer
skills
and
is
one
of
a
range
of
initiatives
fofang
has
set
up
including
a
technological
school
for
pupils
we
ve
seen
technology
prove
to
every
one
of
us
that
it
s
a
good
method
to
move
away
from
poverty
and
we
all
know
that
in
these
parts
women
always
remain
at
the
poverty
line
she
said
nearly
one
in
three
girls
in
cameroon
are
married
by
according
to
a
study
by
united
nations
children
s
agency
unicef
and
this
often
means
they
drop
out
of
education
early
in
percent
of
all
children
out
of
school
were
girls
and
data
for
the
most
up
to
date
available
showed
women
and
girls
made
up
percent
of
cameroon
s
illiterate
population
studies
suggest
educating
girls
has
a
broader
societal
benefit
that
goes
well
beyond
the
individual
child
if
all
girls
had
a
secondary
education
child
deaths
would
be
cut
in
half
saving
almost
million
lives
across
the
globe
according
to
research
by
the
cultural
agency
unesco
fofang
says
teaching
girls
about
technology
can
help
break
the
cycle
of
poverty
from
generation
to
generation
but
says
social
attitudes
as
well
as
a
lack
of
opportunities
are
still
holding
them
back
an
overly
ambitious
girl
in
cameroon
is
not
a
good
one
if
you
re
too
ambitious
society
judges
you
she
said
one
woman
who
has
not
allowed
society
to
hold
her
back
is
chemical
engineer
persis
mbangsi
one
of
a
tiny
minority
of
cameroonian
women
who
have
broken
through
the
glass
ceiling
she
is
the
only
woman
among
male
engineers
at
the
aluminium
plant
in
cameroon
where
she
works
together
with
other
female
engineers
mbangsi
established
a
social
media
initiative
entitled
hidden
no
more
cameroon
to
showcase
the
achievements
of
women
in
technology
it
was
inspired
by
the
hollywood
film
hidden
figures
which
tells
the
story
of
three
female
mathematicians
in
the
who
defy
the
odds
by
going
to
work
for
nasa
we
have
a
cultural
background
that
says
that
a
woman
sits
in
the
kitchen
said
mbangsi
but
imagine
in
a
community
one
person
saying
oh
i
ve
seen
her
she
s
a
petroleum
engineer
cameroon
a
income
country
wedged
between
central
and
west
africa
has
natural
resources
including
oil
and
gas
timber
and
minerals
yet
percent
of
its
million
people
live
below
the
poverty
line
the
country
needs
to
increase
productivity
and
unleash
the
potential
of
its
private
sector
the
world
bank
said
in
april
after
she
qualified
as
an
electrical
engineer
fofang
worked
in
one
of
yaounde
s
poorest
schools
where
most
teachers
lacked
even
basic
computer
skills
in
she
established
her
own
school
the
tassah
academy
financing
it
herself
with
the
help
of
her
mother
and
sister
the
school
specialises
in
technology
and
percent
of
its
students
are
girls
five
years
later
seeking
to
take
technology
to
schoolgirls
around
the
country
she
launched
a
scheme
to
encourage
other
schools
to
set
up
clubs
to
get
girls
interested
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
in
august
xaviera
and
her
team
will
travel
to
mexico
to
take
part
in
an
international
competition
to
devise
robots
that
provide
reliable
energy
power
systems
a
topic
close
to
their
hearts
given
the
frequent
power
outages
in
cameroon
it
s
really
frustrating
sometimes
just
as
we
re
talking
there
can
be
a
blackout
said
xaviera
who
wants
to
keep
working
on
the
issue
in
the
meantime
robotics
is
helping
her
assert
herself
against
the
boys
in
the
team
and
at
school
who
she
says
often
think
they
know
best
xaviera
recalled
a
recent
case
where
she
came
up
with
the
solution
to
a
problem
forcing
them
to
concede
she
was
right
and
i
was
so
happy
she
laughed
my
solution
