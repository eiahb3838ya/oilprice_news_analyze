prices

the
spot
lng
price
for
september
delivery
in

rose
to
per

british

mmbtu
in
the
week
to

the
first
increase
in
six
weeks
soaring
temperatures
in
japan
and
south
korea
were
behind
the
move
higher
as
utilities
ramped
up

to
meet
demand
for
japan
even
resorted
to
restarting
old

dirty

plants
in
addition
to
boosting

generation
the
boost
to
prices
last
week
was
the
latest
turn
in
a
spot
lng
market
that
has
become
more
volatile
and
sensitive
to
even
relatively
modest
moves
in
supply
and
demand
the
spot
price
reached
per
mmbtu
in
an
unusual
occurrence
as
it
meant
the
peak
summer
price
exceeded
that
for
the
previous
winter
for
the
first
time
since
lng
has
a
seasonal
pattern
with
the
peak
price
usually
occurring
in
the
northern
winter
followed
by
a
lower
high
in
summer
and
troughs
in
autumn
and
spring
the
price
peak
was
built
on
strong
demand
from
china
the
world
s
no
importer
whose
rapid
growth
took
it
past
south
korea
last
year
although
it
still
has
some
way
to
go
to
dislodge
japan
from
the
top
spot
some
supply
outages
at
the
same
time
in
major
producer
australia
as
well
as
malaysia
and
the
united
states
also
drove
prices
higher
in
june
while
the
spot
price
has
shifted
up
a
gear
the
extra
demand
has
yet
to
show
up
in
trade
flows
northeast
asia
which
includes
the
three
top
lng
buyers
of
japan
china
and
south
korea
is
on
track
to
import
around
million
tonnes
of
lng
in
july
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
this
would
be
largely
steady
to
june
s
million
tonnes
and
million
tonnes
in
july
last
year
looking
at
the
breakdown
by
country
shows
japan
on
track
to
import
about
million
tonnes
in
july
up
from
june
s
million
but
below
last
july
s
million
china
will
import
around
million
tonnes
in
july
down
a
tad
from
june
s
million
but
up
from
million
in
july
of
south
korea
s
july
imports
are
headed
for
million
tonnes
a
percent
slump
from
june
s
million
and
also
well
below
the
million
from
july
a
year
ago
while
china
is
still
posting
large
gains
it
seems
current
demand
for
lng
is
largely
being
driven
by
japan
the
dynamics
of
lng
flows
are
also
shifting
partly
as
a
result
of
president
donald
trump
s
escalating
trade
dispute
with
china
while
trade
in
lng
isn
t
restricted
in
any
way
as
yet
it
seems
china
is
quietly
discouraging
its
major
oil
and
gas
companies
from
buying
from
the
united
states
only
two
cargoes
arrived
china
in
july
from
the
united
states
carrying
just
million
tonnes
of
the
fuel
this
was
an
unchanged
number
of
cargoes
from
june
but
down
on
five
vessels
that
arrived
in
may
and
well
below
seven
that
unloaded
in
january
this
year
the
winner
in
china
is
australia
with
imports
totalling
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
up
from
million
tonnes
in
the
same
period
last
year
australia
has
also
upped
its
shipments
to
japan
with
million
tonnes
arriving
in
the
first
seven
months
up
from
million
in
the
same
period
in
lng
suppliers
have
had
some
success
in
shipping
to
asian
countries
other
than
china
with
japan
taking
three
cargoes
in
july
down
from
four
in
june
and
level
with
may
south
korea
brought
in
four
cargoes
in
july
the
same
number
as
june
and
down
from
five
in
may
but
with
chinese
demand
for
lng
under
a
cloud
it
s
likely
that
producers
will
have
to
offer
more
competitive
prices
to
other
buyers
in
asia
or
perhaps
in
europe
this
may
prompt
changes
in
the
way
lng
producers
such
as
qatar
and
australia
market
spot
cargoes
increasing
volatility
in
a
market
that
has
shifted
from
being
fairly
predictable
to
one
characterised
by
quicker
and
larger
price
swings
