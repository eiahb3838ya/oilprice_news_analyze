opec
oil
output
has
risen
this
month
to
a
high
as
gulf
members
pumped
more
after
a
deal
to
ease
supply
curbs
and
congo
republic
joined
the

a
reuters
survey
found
although
losses
from
iran
and
libya
limited
the
increase
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
in
july
the
survey
on
monday
found
up
bpd
from
june
s
revised
level
and
the
highest
this
year
with
congo
added
opec
and
allies
agreed
last
month
to
boost
supply
as
president
donald
trump
urged
producers
to
offset
losses
caused
by
new
sanctions
on
iran
and
to
dampen
prices
which
this
year
hit
a
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
on
june
opec
russia
and
other
agreed
to
return
to
percent
compliance
with
oil
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
after
months
of
underproduction
in
venezuela
and
elsewhere
pushed

above

saudi

said
the
decision
would
translate
into
an
output

of
about
million
bpd
opec

collective
adherence
with

targets
has
slipped
to
percent
in

from
a
revised
percent
in

the
survey
found
meaning
it
is
still
cutting
more
than
agreed
following
the
opec
decision
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
raised
output
by
bpd
and
bpd
respectively
in
july
the
survey
found
the
bulk
of
the
saudi
supply
boost
appears
to
have
been
delivered
in
june
as
riyadh
tapped
storage
tanks
to
push
supply
to
million
bpd
near
a
record
high
the
increase
infuriated
iran
and
surprised
other
opec
members
with
its
scale
riyadh
has
boosted
supply
in
july
by
a
further
bpd
from
june
s
revised
level
the
survey
found
because
domestic
crude
use
in
refineries
and
power
plants
has
risen
while
exports
have
held
close
to
june
s
rate
supply
in

royal

light
crude
exports
nigeria
and
libya
were
exempt
from
the
original
deal
iraq
also
increased
supply
as
exports
rose
from
the
country
s
southern
terminals
among
countries
with
lower
output
the
biggest
drop
of
bpd
was
in
iran
exports
fell
as
returning
sanctions
discouraged
companies
from
buying
the
country
s
oil
output
in
libya
which
remains
volatile
due
to
unrest
edged
down
fields
in
eastern
libya
resumed
production
after
a
standoff
at
export
terminals
ended
but
output
was
cut
at
the
largest
oilfield
sharara
production
also
slipped
in
venezuela
where
the
oil
industry
is
starved
of
funds
because
of
economic
crisis
and
in
angola
due
to
lower
exports
in
july
against
a
backdrop
of
natural
decline
at
oilfields
the
addition
of
congo
republic
to
opec
in
june
has
added
about
bpd
to
production
and
coupled
with
the
increases
by
existing
members
has
lifted
opec
output
in

to
the
highest
since

an
implied

target
for
of

based
on

nigeria
and
libya

expectations
of

according
to
