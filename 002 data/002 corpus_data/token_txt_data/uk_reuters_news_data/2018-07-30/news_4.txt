wti
rose
on
expectations
that

fell

worries
that
an

at

in

will
not
be
solved
as
soon
as

traders
said
we
re
just
getting
tighter
and
tighter
here
in
the
in
terms
of

particularly
in
cushing
said
john
kilduff
partner
at
again
capital
management
in
new
york
that
s
why
you
re
seeing
wti
crude
inventories
at
the
oklahoma
delivery
point
for
wti
have
been
dwindling
in
part
due
to
the
situation
at
the
syncrude
facility
that
has
reduced
the
flow
of
oil
into
the
hub
stocks
at
the
cushing
dropped
to
million
barrels
the
lowest
since
november
in
the

to
july
energy

genscape
however
said
that
inventories
at
the
cushing
rose
almost
barrels
or
nearly
percent
from
tuesday
to
friday
last
week
according
to
traders
oil
prices
have
rebounded
from
recent
lows
over
the
last
two
weeks
as
looming
sanctions
on
iran
have
already
started
to
curtail
exports
from
that
country
president
donald
trump
said
on
monday
he
would
meet
with
iran
s
president
hassan
rouhani
the
scenario
is
that
the
provides
meaningful
sanction
waivers
in
the
to
the
elections
and
iran
can
get
away
with
a
loss
of
around
barrels
per
day
of
exports

tamas
varga
said
in
a
note
the
market
held
gains
even
after
a
reuters
survey
showed
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
increased
production
in
july
opec
hiked
production
barrels
per
day
to
million
bpd
a
high
further
supply
increases
could
offset
production
outages
and
pressure
prices
prices
remain
buoyed
by
a
tight
supply
outlook
with
global
inventories
down
from
record
highs
in
and
inventories
at
lows
said
gene
mcgillian
vice
president
of
market
research
at
tradition
energy
in
stamford
connecticut
if
you
take
a
step
back
and
look
at
where
global
inventories
and
inventories
are
you
re
seeing
a
tighter
picture
than
where
we
were
a
year
ago
mcgillian
said
overall
i
think
the
market
is
in
the
process
of
saudi
arabia
last
week
said
it
was
suspending
oil
shipments
through
the
red
sea
s
bab
strait
one
of
the
world
s
most
important
tanker
routes
after
yemen
s
houthis
attacked
two
ships
in
the
waterway
the
ongoing
concerns
about
the
lack
of
supply
coming
out
of
the
bab
strait
on
top
of
continued
disruption
in
venezuela
seems
to
be
giving
the
market
momentum
not
to
mention
the
potential
loss
of
iranian
supply
