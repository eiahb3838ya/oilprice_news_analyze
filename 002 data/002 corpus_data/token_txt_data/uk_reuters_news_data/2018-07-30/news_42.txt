world
stocks
and
the
dollar
were
broadly
steady
on
monday
as
a
busy
week
of
central
bank
meetings
and
company
updates
began
while
japanese
government
bonds
sold
off
before
possible
monetary
policy
tweaks
disappointing
updates
from
tech
heavyweights
overshadowed
solid
results
elsewhere
helping
knock
european
shares
off
highs
while
a
msci

that
tracks
shares
in
countries
pared
losses
to
trade
flat
quarterly
results
continue
to
be
more
than
good
overall
but
markets
appear
to
be
particularly
sensitive
to
the
sporadic
negative
updates
especially
from
tech
stocks
jci
capital
strategist
and
fund
manager
alessandro
balsotti
said
meanwhile
before
the
august
lull
although
that
s
not
always
the
case
for
markets
we
re
bracing
for
an
intense
week
packed
with
central
bank
meetings
and
macro
data
he
said
on
monday
industrial
heavyweight
caterpillar
posted
higher
quarterly
profit
that
beat
market
forecasts
and
upgraded
the
profit
outlook
citing
robust
global
demand
the
encouraging
update
helped
dow
futures
rise
while
nasdaq
and
s
p
futures
remained
under
pressure
from
technology
stocks
apple
is
also
among
the
s
p
companies
that
report
results
this
week
the
iphone
maker
will
be
closely
watched
after
disappointing
results
from
facebook
and
twitter
shook
confidence
in
tech
resilience
jpmorgan
reported
relatively
aggressive
moves
into
value
stocks
banks
in
particular
and
away
from
shares
leveraged
to
economic
growth
tech
really
began
cracking
on
tuesday
before
the
floodgates
opened
on
friday
jpmorgan
analysts
wrote
in
a
note
the
rotation
will
likely
continue
benefiting
value
categories
at
the
expense
of

are
biased
higher
they
said
europe

higher

vs

in
europe
companies
on
the
stoxx
benchmark
are
due
to
report
their
updates
this
week
with
figures
from
big
banks
including
bnp
paribas
intesa
sanpaolo
and
lloyds
in
the
spotlight
according
to
data
earnings
of
companies
on
the

are
expected
to
have
risen
percent
earnings
for
the
s
p
are
forecast
to
have
risen
percent
with
more
than
four
out
of
five
companies
which
have
already
reported
beating
analyst
expectations
at
percent
earnings
beats
in
europe
have
lagged
those
on
wall
street
away
from

the
top
focus
will
be
three
central
bank
meetings
bank
of
japan
and
the
bank
of
england
will
be
eyed
for
possible
policy
tweaks
while
the
federal
reserve
is
unlikely
to
deliver
surprises
the
fed
meets
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
and
is
expected
to
keep
rates
unchanged
and
reaffirm
the
outlook
for
further
rate
rises
the
market
is
almost
fully
priced
for
a
hike
in
september
and
leaning
towards
a
further
move
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
boj
meeting
that
ends
on
tuesday
will
be
closely
watched
amid
speculation
the
central
bank
might
tweak
its
massive
programme
and
take
a
step
towards
less
monetary
policy
accommodation
as
the
market
tried
to
test
the
central
bank
s
intention
japanese
government
bonds
sagged
sending
the
benchmark
yield
to
its
highest
level
for
almost
a
year
and
a
half
that
forced
the
boj
to
conduct
a
special
operation
for
two
sessions
in
a
row
and
to
end
up
buying
a
record
amount
to
stem
rising
bond
yields
on
currency
markets
the
chance
of
a
boj
shift
has
sent
the
yen
higher
in
the
last
week
or
so
leaving
the
dollar
around

from
this
month

peak

repeatedly
failed
to
