from
big

including
bnp
paribas
intesa
sanpaolo
lloyds
in
the
spotlight
away
from

the
top
focus
will
be
three
central
bank
meetings
bank
of
japan
and
the
bank
of
england
will
be
eyed
for
possible
policy
tweaks
while
the
federal
reserve
is
unlikely
to
deliver
surprises
the
fed

on
tuesday
and
wednesday
and
is
expected
to
keep
rates
unchanged
and
reaffirm
the
outlook
for
further
rate
rises
the
market
is
almost
fully
priced
for
a
hike
in
september
and
leaning
towards
a
further
move
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
boj
meeting
that
ends
on
tuesday
will
be
closely

programme
and
take
a
step
towards
less
monetary
policy
accommodation
as
the
market
tried
to
test
the
central
bank
s
intention
japanese
government
bond
sagged
sending
the
benchmark
yield
to
its
highest
level
in
almost
a
year
and
a
half
that
forced
the
boj
to
conduct
a
special
operation
for
two
sessions
in
a
row
and
to
end
up
buying
a
record
amount
to
stem

the
chance
of
a
boj
shift
has
sent
the

so
leaving
the
dollar
around
yen

that
