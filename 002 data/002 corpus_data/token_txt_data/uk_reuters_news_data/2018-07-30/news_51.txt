japan
s
biggest
electric
utilities
are
firing
up
old
fossil
fuel
power
plants
and
ramping
up
others
that
are
already
operating
pushing
to
meet
demand
as
power
prices
hit
record
highs
amid
a
deadly
heatwave
the
deployment
of
older
dirtier
stations
that
use
commodities
such
as
crude
and
fuel
oil
highlights
the
lingering
effects
of
the
fukushima
nuclear
disaster
in
which
has
left
most
of
the
country
s
reactors
offline
as
operators
upgrade
them
like
many
other
regions
of
the
world
japan
has
been
hit
by
record
temperatures
in
a
heatwave
with
more
than
people
dying
and
thousands
rushed
to
emergency
rooms
surging
appetite
for
power
as
households
and
businesses
crank
up
their
air
conditioning
has
driven
utilities
to
start
up
old
fossil
fuel
plants
that
had
been
mothballed
but
kept
on
standby
or
to
boost
output
at
fossil
units
kansai
electric
power
which
supplies
japan
s
western
industrialized
heartland
where
the
heatwave
has
been
most
persistent
has
started
up
two
old
units
with
total
capacity
of
gigawatts
gw
a
spokesman
told
reuters
the
nation
s
utility
has
also
run
one
station
fuelled
by
natural
gas
and
another
fired
by
oil
at
higher
than
planned
output
levels
he
said
adding
that
kansai
had
also
received
gw
of
power
from
five
other
utilities
the
sweltering
weather
has
driven
prices
on
the
japan
electric
power
exchange
for
the
kansai
region
to
just
above
yen
yen
per
kilowatt
hour
this
week
the
highest
on
record
meanwhile
tokyo
electric
power
the
country
s
biggest
electricity
provider
and
the
operator
of
the
wrecked
fukushima
nuclear
plant
has
run
oil
coal
and
gas
plants
at
rates
higher
than
their
typical
maximum
capacity
a
spokesman
told
reuters
he
declined
to
say
which
plants
were
operating
at
these
levels
japan
relied
on
nuclear
power
for
nearly
a
third
of
its
electricity
supply
before
the
fukushima
disaster
but
now
has
just
six
out
of
available
nuclear
reactors
running
and
the
scorching
conditions
could
be
set
to
stay
as
july
turns
to
august
typically
the
hottest
month
in
japan
western
japan
has
a
percent
chance
of
experiencing
temperatures
over
the
month
the
country
s
weather
bureau
said
this
week
chubu
electric
power
the
country
s
utility
sees
electricity
demand
in
july
and
august
potentially
exceeding
initial
estimates
president
satoru
katsuno
told
reporters
on
july
our
old
thermal
power
plants
are
working
hard
we
must
get
our
act
together
to
keep
them
well
maintained
