oilfield
workers
equipped
with
goggles
are
helping
bp
s
shale
business
turn
a
profit
for
the
first
time
thousands
of
automated
wells
feed
data
on
their
performance
into
the
firm
s
supercomputers
each
evening
if
they
show
a
need
for
maintenance
an
system
summons
a
subcontracted
repair
firm
to
keep
the
shale
wells
flowing
at
optimal
output
and
minimal
cost
such
technology
has
helped
slash
bp
s
shale
oil
and
natural
gas
production
costs
by
percent
over
five
years
the
shale
business
turned
a
profit
for
the
first
time
in
bp
said
although
the
company
declined
to
disclose
the
figure
bp
s
progress
in
shale
underpinned
its
billion
acquisition
last
week
of
bhp
billiton
s
shale
operations
the
deal
highlighted
bp
s
newfound
confidence
in
a
sector
that
has
challenged
oil
majors
which
initially
struggled
to
adjust
to
the
quick
pace
and
methods
used
to
tap
shale
with
horizontal
drilling
and
hydraulic
fracturing
bp
and
other
majors
that
had
traditionally
focused
on
large
conventional
drilling
projects
such
as
royal
dutch
shell
and
chevron
were
left
behind
when
the
shale
boom
took
off
a
decade
ago
the
british
energy
giant
is
now
catching
up
with
smaller
rivals
using
technology
and
its
institutional
knowledge
from
global
operations
to
push
shale
into
a
second
phase
that
it
hopes
will
reward
its
massive
scale
over
the
agility
of
smaller
competitors
we
spent
the
last
four
years
retooling
our
business
and
getting
ready
for
this
opportunity
david
lawler
who
heads
bp
s
shale
business
said
in
a
call
with
analysts
after
the
bhp
deal
announcement
we
re
at
the
lowest
production
costs
we
ve
seen
in
many
years
we
ll
take
that
model
put
that
to
work
on
these
bhp
assets
and
dramatically
improve
production
and
bp
faces
other
large
rivals
in
the
race
to
grow
shale
production
and
profits
including
exxon
mobil
corp
chevron
shell
and
norway
s
equinor
all
are
expanding
drilling
and
acquisitions
particularly
in
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
the
largest
oil
field
and
the
center
of
the
shale
revolution
they
aim
to
capitalize
on
the
vast
resources
unearthed
by
new
drilling
technologies
which
also
allow
companies
to
start
and
stop
production
quickly
in
response
to
market
shifts
that
s
a
key
advantage
over
the
commitments
of
billions
of
dollars
required
by
offshore
oil
or
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
projects
the
bhp
deal
will
transform
bp
into
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
shale
oil
and
gas
producers
bp
s
total
shale
output
will
increase
from
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boed
to
more
than
boed
its
reserves
will
jump
percent
to
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
bp
s
output
of
shale
oil
which
is
worth
more
than
natural
gas
is
poised
to
rise
from
about
barrels
of
oil
per
day
bpd
to
about
bpd
by
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
the
deal
bp
s
first
major
acquisition
in
years
also
marked
a
watershed
moment
for
the
company
in
the
united
states
as
it
looks
to
leave
behind
the
billion
fallout
from
the
deadly
explosion
of
its
deepwater
horizon
rig
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
bhp
deal
will
also
bp
as
a
major
player
in
the
permian
basin
bp
had
sold
all
of
its
assets
there
to
apache
corp
in
august
right
after
the
gulf
disaster
today
bp
operates
more
than
shale
wells
that
produce
mostly
natural
gas
in
the
haynesville
basin
which
straddles
eastern
texas
arkansas
and
louisiana
it
has
used
the
data
from
its
automated
wells
to
create
a
streamlined
system
that
farms
out
maintenance
to
a
fleet
of
contractors
the
firm
now
orders
up
repairs
much
in
the
same
way
a
homeowner
uses
a
mobile
app
to
hire
a
maintenance
person
or
a
passenger
summons
an
uber
for
a
ride
bp
puts
repair
work
out
for
bid
to
contractors
who
then
compete
for
jobs
each
contractor
is
rated
after
completing
the
work
and
those
with
high
rankings
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
hired
again
this
means
we
re
not
hiring
and
firing
staff
all
the
time
depending
on
market
conditions
said
brian
pugh
chief
operating
office
of
bp
s
shale
division
which
the
company
created
as
a
unit
in
bp
equips
field
staff
and
contractors
with
augmented
reality
goggles
to
make
repairs
more
efficient
modeling
its
methods
in
part
on
pokemon
go
a
popular
video
game
where
virtual
images
appear
to
be
in
surroundings
on
the
player
s
screen
the
field
workers
are
connected
through
their
headsets
to
bp
s
houston
offices
where
experts
can
see
and
show
staff
how
to
perform
repairs
while
they
work
bp
has
started
to
collect
many
of
these
fixes
in
a
video
library
so
staff
can
call
up
videos
much
like
youtube
to
fix
problems
themselves
without
expert
consultation
the
company
s
algorithms
crunch
data
compiled
from
its
wells
each
evening
operators
wake
up
each
morning
to
a
report
telling
them
which
wells
may
need
repair
a
task
that
once
took
hours
each
day
as
workers
drove
from
well
to
well
in
search
of
problems
the
systems
bp
said
cut
downtime
for
wells
needing
repairs
by
percent
boosting
production
last
year
by
million
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
across
its
shale
portfolio
the
technology
provides
a
panoramic
view
into
the
ongoing
needs
of
the
oilfield
said
kimberly
krieger
who
overseas
bp
s
shale
operations
in
eastern
texas
it
s
like
looking
into
a
crystal
ball
krieger
said
the
firm
s
success
in
reducing
costs
reflects
its
ability
to
spend
money
automating
its
oil
fields
and
overhaul
work
processes
to
drive
down
service
and
equipment
costs
bp
also
separated
its
shale
business
from
the
main
company
to
allow
the
business
now
headquartered
in
denver
to
form
its
own
culture
we
re
able
to
leverage
the
best
parts
of
our
global
business
to
boost
our
shale
operations
pugh
said
our
smaller
shale
rivals
in
the
don
t
necessarily
have
other
majors
are
shooting
for
the
same
results
exxon
expects
its
shale
operations
to
produce
billion
in
profit
by
compared
to
a
billion
loss
in
chevron
expects
percent
of
its
profit
to
come
from
the
permian
by
after
it
lost
money
there
during
the
oil
downturn
of
to
shell
forecasts
that
shale
operations
will
make
money
for
the
first
time
next
year
and
cash
flow
will
hit

we
use
our
global
size
to
our
advantage
when
we
negotiate
