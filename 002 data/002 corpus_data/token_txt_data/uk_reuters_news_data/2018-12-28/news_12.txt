world
stocks
rose
to
highs
on
friday
and
looked
set
to
snap
a
losing
streak
after
a
bounce
overnight
on
wall
street
filtered
into
asian
and
european
markets
assets
were
also
in
demand
amid
broader
doubts
about
the
market
stability
that
in
turn
eroded
the
dollar
s
appeal
shares
appeared
poised
for
another
rise
with
futures
for
the
s
dow
jones
and
nasdaq
indices
all
up
around
half
a
percent
while
a
benchmark
rose
percent
reversing
thursday
s
retreat
that
took
msci
s
equity
index
percent
higher
for
a
weekly
gain
so
far
of
almost
percent
equities
have
however
not
matched
a
surge
on
wall
street
that
saw
the
s
p
gain
percent
its
best
performance
since
august
while
wall
street
s
resilience
has
fuelled
hope
that
some
of
the
market
pressure
may
be
easing
investors
remain
wary
the
volatility
here
at
is
unlikely
to
be
sustained
but
without
more
encouraging
signals
from
washington
the
markets
will
likely
remain
treacherous
in
the
new
year
marc
chandler
at
bannockburn
securities
told
clients
volatility
in
europe
and
in
the
united
states
spiked
to
highs
not
seen
since
a
global
stock
market
correction
in
february
but
the
main
volatility
gauge
has
since
subsided
to
lows
among
currencies
the
dollar
slipped
percent
to
yen
and
was
on
track
to
lose
more
than
percent
against
the
japanese
currency
this
month
against
the
swiss
franc
it
declined
percent
to
francs
another

gold
inched
up
to
touch
a
high
of
an
ounce
the
steady
drumbeat
of
disappointing
data
continued
to
reinforce
caution
with
japan
s
industrial
output
contracting
in
november
and
retail
sales
showing
sharply
in
europe
german
annual
inflation
slowed
sharply
in
december
the
euro
and
sterling
both
firmed
percent
against
the
soft
dollar
while
an
index
of
emerging
market
currencies
touched
highs
chris
bailey

strategist
at

raymond
james
said
dollar
weakness
was
good
news
for
assets
my
feeling
is
if
we
get
the
transmission
mechanism
of
a
lower
dollar
stocks
outside
the
are
set
up
for
a
good
bailey
said
once
people
get
their
heads
around
the
fact
the
is
not
going
to
have
yet
another
return
year
in
you
can
look
this
year
though
the
annual
picture
for
most
assets
remains
grim
with
world
stocks
for
instance
losing
close
to
percent
so
far
in
and
oil
prices
falling
percent
brent
crude
futures
which
had
rebounded
after
thursday
s
percent
fall
eased
back
half
a
percent
to
a
barrel
as
rising
inventories
and
concern
over
global
economic
growth
weighed
on
bond
markets
yields
on
safer
debt
from
germany
and
the
united
states
rose
slightly
though
they
remained
near
lows
in
italy
yields
are
set
for
their
biggest
monthly
drop
since
july
the
last
auction
of
the
year
there
saw
investors
willing
to
buy
government
bonds
at
percent
down
from
percent
last
month
the
auction
could
be
a
sign
italy

turned
a
