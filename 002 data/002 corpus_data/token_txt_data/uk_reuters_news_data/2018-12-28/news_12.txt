update 3-u.s. limits on coal plant mercury emissions too costly -trump's epa
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
friday
said
limits
on
mercury
emissions
from
power
plants
were
unnecessary
as
they
were
too
costly
sparking
an
outcry
from
environmentalists
who
feared
the
next
step
would
be
looser
rules
favouring
the
coal
industry
at
the
expense
of
public
health
under
the
mercury
and
air
toxic
standards
or
mats
enacted
under
former
president
barack
obama
power
plants
were
required
to
install
expensive
equipment
to
cut
output
of
mercury
which
can
harm
pregnant
women
and
put
infants
and
children
at
risk
of
developmental
problems
the
environmental
protection
agency
left
the
emission
standards
in
place
but
proposed
using
a
different
cost
analysis
to
evaluate
whether
the
regulation
is
needed
a
move
that
paves
the
way
for
looser
rules
going
forward
its
statement
was
issued
on
friday
during
a
partial
government
shutdown
since
august
the
environmental
protection
agency
has
been
reconsidering
the
justification
for
the
rule
a
coalition
of
electric
utilities
had
said
the
looser
rules
were
not
needed
since
they
have
already
invested
billions
of
dollars
in
technology
to
cut
emissions
of
the
pollutant
and
comply
epa
said
it
was
proposing
that
it
is
not
appropriate
and
necessary
to
regulate
hap
hazardous
air
pollution
emissions
from
and
power
plants
because
the
costs
of
such
regulation
grossly
outweigh
the
quantified
hap
it
said
its
reassessment
showed
the
cost
of
compliance
with
mats
was
between
billion
to
billion
annually
while
the
monetized
benefits
were
between
million
to
million
it
also
said
the
identification
of
unquantified
benefits
was
not
enough
to
support
the
standards
among
such
benefits
environmentalists
say
are
reduced
healthcare
costs
breathing
cleaner
air
and
drinking
cleaner
water
the
policy
acting
epa
administrator
andrew
wheeler
and
president
donald
trump
proposed
today
means
more
pregnant
women
young
children
and
the
elderly
will
be
exposed
to
deadly
neurotoxins
and
poisons
just
so
wealthy
coal
and
oil
barons
can
make
a
few
extra
bucks

director
mary
anne
hitt
said
in
a
statement
wheeler
is
a
former
coal
industry
lobbyist
virtually
every
coal
plant
in
the
has
already
met
this
lifesaving
standard
and
now
trump
is
recklessly
trying
to
roll
it
back
she
said
a
study
published
this
month
by
harvard
university
s
school
of
public
health
said
power
plants
are
the
top
source
of
mercury
in
the
united
states
accounting
for
nearly
half
of
mercury
emissions
in
it
said
the
standards
have
markedly
reduced
mercury
in
the
environment
and
improved
public
health
since
taking
office
in
january
trump
has
targeted
rolling
back
environmental
and
climate
protections
to
maximize
production
of
domestic
fossil
fuels
including
crude
oil
oil
production
is
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
after
a
boom
that
was
triggered
more
than
a
decade
ago
by
improved
drilling
technology
the
coal
industry
had
challenged
a
conclusion
by
obama
s
epa
that
the
rule
was
justified
because
savings
to
consumers
on
healthcare
costs
would
exceed
compliance
costs
the
calculations
accounted
for
how
equipment
would
reduce
emissions
of
other
harmful
substances
in
addition
to
mercury
trump
s
industry
allies
including
robert
murray
ceo
of
private
coal
mining
giant
murray
energy
corp
had
complained
that
the
mats
rule
contributed
to
the
demise
of
the
coal
business
by
triggering
hundreds
of
power
plant
shutdowns
and
driving
coal
demand
to
its
lowest
in
decades
power
generation
has
fallen
more
than
since
a
peak
in
while
natural
generation
soared
by
about
the
same
amount
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
utilities
demand
for
coal
is
projected
to
fall
further
this
year
by
around
percent
to
million
short
tons
the
lowest
in
years
according
to
the
eia
in
july
electric
utilities
and
utility
groups
favouring
the
rule
asked
the
administration
to
keep
it
in
place
they
noted
that
billions
of
dollars
in
investments
for
equipment
have
already
been
made
and
costs
are
being
recovered
from
electricity
customers
through
regulated
pricing
this
is
like
when
your
kid
tries
to
clean
up
your
kitchen
it
actually
makes
things
worse
please
stop
helping
said
a
utility
industry
lobbyist
based
in
washington
who
asked
not
to
be
named
the
rule
itself
forced
coal
plant
shutdowns
but
they
aren
t
coming
epa
said
it
will
take
comment
for
the
proposal
for
days
and
will
hold
at
least
one
public
hearing
