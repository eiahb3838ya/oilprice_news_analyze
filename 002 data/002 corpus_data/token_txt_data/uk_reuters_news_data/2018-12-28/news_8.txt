trump epa says limits on mercury emissions from coal plants not necessary
washington
dec
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
friday
said
limits
on
mercury
emissions
from
power
plants
were
no
longer
necessary
as
their
costs
outweighed
the
benefits
a
move
environmentalists
said
was
favorable
for
the
coal
industry
and
could
increase
health
hazards
under
the
mercury
and
air
toxic
standards
or
mats
enacted
under
former
president
barack
obama
coal
plants
have
been
forced
to
install
expensive
equipment
to
cut
output
of
mercury
which
can
harm
pregnant
women
and
put
infants
and
children
at
risk
of
developmental
problems
since
august
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
has
been
reconsidering
the
justification
for
the
rule
electric
utilities
have
pushed
back
on
the
potential
loosening
of
requirements
saying
they
have
already
invested
in
technology
to
cut
emissions
of
the
dangerous
pollutant
in
a
statement
issued
on
friday
during
a
partial
government
shutdown
the
epa
said
the
emission
standards
of
the
mats
rule
would
remain
in
place
but
it
proposed
to
withdraw
the
justification
for
the
requirements
epa
is
proposing
that
it
is
not
appropriate
and
necessary
to
regulate
hap
emissions
from
and
power
plants
because
the
costs
of
such
regulation
grossly
outweigh
the
quantified
hap
benefits
it
said
the
industry
had
challenged
a
conclusion
by
obama
s
epa
that
the
rule
was
justified
because
savings
to
consumers
on
healthcare
costs
would
exceed
compliance
costs
the
calculations
accounted
for
how
equipment
would
reduce
emissions
of
other
harmful
substances
in
addition
to
mercury
since
taking
office
in
january
trump
has
targeted
rolling
back
environmental
and
climate
protections
to
maximize
production
of
domestic
fossil
fuels
including
crude
oil
oil
production
is
the
highest
in
the
world
above
saudi
arabia
and
russia
after
a
boom
that
was
triggered
more
than
a
decade
ago
by
improved
