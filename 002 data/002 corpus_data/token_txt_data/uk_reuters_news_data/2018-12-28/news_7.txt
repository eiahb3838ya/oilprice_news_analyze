buenos

reuters
argentina
s
energy
secretary
resigned
on
friday
the
government
said
in
a
statement
less
than
hours
after
news
leaked
that
the
administration
of
president
mauricio
macri
plans
to
increase
electricity
prices
by
an
average
percent
next
year
higher
power
bills
are
sure
to
be
unpopular
as
they
would
hit
families
already
struggling
with
percent
inflation
and
a
shrinking
economy
that
has
caused
job
losses
and
an
increase
in
poverty
the
statement
announcing
energy
secretary
javier
iguacel
was
stepping
down
gave
no
reason
for
his
resignation
it
said
the
incoming
energy
secretary
would
be
gustavo
lopetegui
currently
a
presidential
adviser
with
close
ties
to
macri
s
powerful
cabinet
chief
marcos
pena
next
year
will
be
politically
sensitive
for
argentina
with
macri
set
to
run
for
in
october
while
policymakers
struggle
to
jumpstart
latin
america
s
third
biggest
economy
and
tame
leaping
consumer
prices
which
eroded
the
purchasing
power
of
average
argentine
households
during
the
planned
energy
price
increases
are
linked
to
a
standby
financing
deal
that
the
government
signed
with
the
international
monetary
fund
at
which
calls
on
argentina
to
erase
its
primary
fiscal
deficit
next
year
in
part
by
reducing
public
utility
subsidies
