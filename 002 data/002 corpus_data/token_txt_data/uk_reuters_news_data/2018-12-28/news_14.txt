tough to stop nord stream 2 now it's being built - eu's oettinger
berlin
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
criticism
of
the
nord
stream
pipeline
is
no
reason
to
stop
the
project
and
any
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
difficult
now
that
it
is
being
built
european
commissioner
guenther
oettinger
said
trump
has
attacked
berlin
for
supporting
the
billion
gas
pipeline
spanning
the
baltic
sea
accusing
germany
in
july
of
being
a
captive
of
russia
due
to
its
reliance
on
russian
energy
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
last
month
that
washington
retained
the
option
of
imposing
sanctions
on
companies
working
on
the
pipeline
which
would
bring
russian
gas
directly
to
germany
berlin
and
moscow
have
been
at
odds
since
russia
annexed
crimea
four
years
ago
but
they
have
a
common
interest
in
the
nord
stream
project
which
will
double
the
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
route
from
next
year
i
was
never
a
great
supporter
of
nord
stream
oettinger
the
eu
s
budget
commissioner
told
german
magazine
der
spiegel
but
the
truth
is
the
pipeline
has
long
been
under
construction
and
can
no
longer
so
easily
be
he
added
trump
s
threats
are
no
reason
for
germany
refuses
to
join
opposition
to
the
project
from
many
eu
states
and
thus
far
from
the
eu
executive
describing
it
as
a
private
enterprise
washington
is
concerned
that
the
pipeline
which
will
bypass
ukraine
by
running
under
the
baltic
sea
will
strip
ukraine
of
important
transit
revenue
and
says
moscow
is
using
the
project
to
divide
europe
ukraine
derives
up
to
percent
of
its
gross
domestic
product
gdp
from
transit
charges
construction
of
the
project
is
progressing
oettinger
a
german
pressed
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
which
is
leading
the
project
to
agree
a
fair
deal
on
the
further
use
of
the
existing
pipelines
through
ukraine
gazprom
is
the
sole
shareholder
in
nord
stream
shouldering
half
of
