coal
miners
in
spain
are
working
their
last
shifts
before
all
unprofitable
mines
shut
down
under
a
european
union
directive
in
which
deposits
that
no
longer
make
money
and
receive
public
funds
must
stop
production
by
spain
announced
in
a
billion
euro
billion
plan
backed
by
brussels
to
ease
the
closure
of
uncompetitive
coal
mines
by
the
end
of
this
year
mines
must
return
funds
if
they
do
not
close
by
the
end
of
coal
accounts
for
under
percent
of
spain
s
energy
needs
and
the
majority
used
in
spain
is
imported
high
extraction
costs
have
led
to
the
gradual
closure
of
mines
in
spain
mostly
concentrated
in
the
northern
regions
of
asturias
castile
and
leon

since
dwindled

said
by

the
group
is
fighting
against
closure
saying
that
it
has
presented
a
project
to
exploit
adjoining
concessions
that
are
not
receiving
state
aid
it
said
estimating
there
were
reserves
of
several
million
tonnes

spain
s
socialist
government
agreed
a
deal
in
october
with
unions
to
smooth
workers
access
to
benefits
such
as
early
retirement
and
earmarked
a
million
euro
fund
for
aiding
business
ventures
and
disused
mines
the
government
expects
around
percent
of
workers
to
opt
for
early
retirement
the
closure
of
coal
mines
is
a
thorny
issue
for
the
minority
socialist
government
as
it
has
made
environmental
issues
a
keystone
of
its
administration
creating
a
ministry
to
oversee
the
transition
to
more
policies
however
the
coal
mining
communities
most
affected
by
these
closures
are
traditionally
socialist
voters
