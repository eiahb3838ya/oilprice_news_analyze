update 2-germany paves way for upgrading exhaust systems on older diesel cars
berlin
reuters
germany
on
friday
cleared
away
legal
hurdles
for
carmakers
to
upgrade
exhaust
emissions
filtering
systems
on
older
diesel
cars
as
a
way
to
avoid
vehicle
bans
but
failed
to
quell
doubts
among
manufacturers
and
suppliers
over
the
effectiveness
of
retrofits
carmakers
have
been
forced
to
consider
upgrading
exhaust
treatment
systems
on
older
cars
after
german
cities
started
banning
heavily
polluting
diesel
vehicles
to
cut
pollution
from
fine
particulate
matter
and
toxic
nitrogen
oxides
the
fight
over
refits
is
the
latest
fallout
from
an
emissions
cheating
scandal
triggered
by
volkswagen
in
after
it
admitted
systematically
hiding
illegal
pollution
levels
from
regulators
an
environmental
and
regulatory
backlash
ensued
and
lawmakers
and
the
auto
industry
are
now
at
odds
over
how
to
clean
up
dirty
air
in
inner
cities
carmakers
want
customers
to
buy
new
cars
with
cleaner
engines
while
environmentalists
and
consumer
groups
argue
that
retrofitting
older
vehicles
may
be
more
the
transport
ministry
on
friday
released
a
document
setting
out
guidelines
for
getting
regulatory
approval
to
install
upgraded
exhaust
filtering
systems
on
older
cars
now
it
is
the
turn
of
the
retrofit
industry
to
develop
effective
systems
to
meet
all
limits
and
regulations
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
said
in
a
statement
the
federal
motor
transport
authority
would
grant
approval
quickly
so
that
the
retrofit
systems
could
be
offered
on
the
market
as
soon
as
possible
he
added
baumot
group
which
makes
exhaust
filtering
upgrade
kits
welcomed
the
guidelines
under
a
normal
vehicle
certification
process
we
believe
we
can
deliver
our
system
in
in
a
timely
fashion
said
marcus
hausser
the
company
s
chief
executive
german
auto
lobby
group
vda
however
said
that
customers
should
buy
new
cars
rather
than
spend
money
on
installing
new
exhaust
filtering
mechanisms
on
older
vehicles
we
can
not
give
a
guarantee
for
a
vehicle
in
which
exhaust
purification
systems
have
been
retrofitted
vda
president
bernhard
mattes
told
die
welt
newspaper
if
a
customer
has
his
vehicle
modified
then
he
and
the
retrofitter
are
responsible
for
any
consequential
german
environmental
lobby
group
deutsche
umwelthilfe
duh
won
a
landmark
ruling
in
february
to
force
diesel
bans
after
it
sued
cities
that
failed
to
meet
clean
air
rules
cities
have
considered
banning
older
vehicles
which
do
not
conform
to
the
latest
euro
engine
emissions
standards
hamburg
has
banned
older
diesel
cars
from
the
city
center
and
other
cities
including
berlin
and
stuttgart
the
home
of
germany
s
car
industry
are
set
to
introduce
similar
bans
of
the
million
diesel
cars
on
germany
s
roads
only
million
have
technology
evercore
isi
has
estimated
that
upgrading
the
exhaust
cleaning
of
just
the
fleet
could
cost
up
to
billion
euros
billion
german
carmakers
have
already
agreed
to
spend
up
to
euros
per
vehicle
to
upgrade
engine
management
software
to
make
exhaust
filtering
systems
more
effective
but
environmentalists
say
these
measures
are
insufficient
carmakers
are
divided
over
who
will
pay
the
retrofit
costs
given
that
most
older
diesel
cars
met
clean
air
rules
at
the
time
when
they
were
sold
volkswagen
and
daimler
announced
they
would
cover
some
retrofit
costs
while
rival
bmw
has
refused
only
proposing
incentives
to
trade
in
old
vehicles
for
new
ones
volkswagen
said
on
friday
that
customers
may
not
benefit
from
installing
new
exhaust
systems
on
older
cars
all
concepts
known
to
us
to
date
have
disadvantages
for
our
customers
such
as
increased
fuel
consumption
and
thus
increased
emissions
and
in
some
cases
reduced
performance
vw
research
and
development
head
frank
welsch
said
in
a
statement
bmw
said
exhaust
system
upgrades
that
would
not
penalize
fuel
consumption
or
cause
additional
wear
and
tear
could
take
up
to
three
years
to
develop
and
certify
selling
newer
cars
through
incentives
combined
with
the
of
electric
car
charging
infrastructure
would
bring
down
pollution
levels
in
inner
cities
much
faster
than
trying
to
retrofit
older
vehicles
bmw
said
on
friday
supplier
continental
supported
the
carmakers
critical
stance
a
spokesman
said
developing
retrofits
for
each
model
would
be
extremely
costly
and
paris
madrid
mexico
city
and
athens
have
said
they
plan
to
ban
diesel
vehicles
from
city
centers
by
while
the
mayor
of
copenhagen
wants
to
ban
new
diesel
cars
from
entering
the
city
as
soon
as
next
year
france
