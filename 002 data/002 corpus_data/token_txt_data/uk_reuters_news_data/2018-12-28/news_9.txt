investors
gravitated
to
assets
on
friday
as
worries
about
the
world
economy
persisted
cutting
short
a
rebound
in
stocks
stocks
making
it
difficult
for
world
equity
indexes
to
end
one
of
the
most
brutal
december
selloffs
in

on
a

markets
will
likely
remain
treacherous
in

the

added

rose
percent
and
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
gained
percent
to
bring
the
global
benchmark
to
a
weekly
gain
over
percent
markets
have
swung
wildly
in
a
week
shortened
by
the
christmas
holiday
but
even
a
late
santa
claus
rally
will
do
little
to
salve
the
percent
declines
for
the
msci
index
this
month
and
a
year
that
brought
gains
for
very
few
categories
of
financial
assets
from
stocks
to
bonds
and
commodities
the
dollar
index
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
and
japanese
yen
strengthening
percent
versus
the
greenback
at
per
dollar
the
greenback
is
down
about
percent
this
month
that
has
boosted
gold
a
traditional
safe
haven
whose
appeal
this
year
was
hit
by
a
stronger
dollar
which
makes
the
metal
more
expensive
to
buyers
with
other
currencies
the
metal
is
perched
at
highs
of
an
ounce
the
steady
drum
beat
of
disappointing
economic
data
has
continued
to
reinforce
caution
with
japan
s
industrial
output
contracting
in
november
and
retail
sales
showing
sharply
in
europe
german
annual
inflation
slowed
sharply
in
december
while
in
the
united
states
national
association
of
realtors
data
showed
contracts
to
buy
previously
owned
homes
fell
unexpectedly
in
november
the
latest
sign
of
weakness
in
the
housing
market
chris
bailey
a
strategist
at
brokerage
raymond
james
said
dollar
weakness
was
good
news
for
assets
my
feeling
is
if
we
get
the
transmission
mechanism
of
a
lower
dollar
stocks
outside
the
are
set
up
for
a
good
bailey
said
once
people
get
their
heads
around
the
fact
the
is
not
going
to
have
yet
another
return
year
in
you
can
look
that
would
be
a
relief
to
world
markets
that
largely
underperformed
the
united
states
in
treasuries
did
not
see
a
huge
move
bonds
have
been
helped
in
recent
weeks
by
risk
aversion
but
also
face
a
glut
of
supply
as
the
government
finances
its
growing
deficit
short
and
bonds
were
little
changed
on
friday
the
treasury
bond
last

in
price
