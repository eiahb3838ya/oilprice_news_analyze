potentially
air

in
its
biggest
for
more
than
a
decade
according
to
executives
and
two

with
the
matter
the

operates
the
world
s
leading
shipping
freight

which
tracks

including
iron

and

it
is
looking
to
diversify
its
business
after
a
near
shipping
downturn
hit
trading
volumes
and
profitability
we
are
only
going
to
make
real
money
through

so
we
have
got
to
increase
our
reach
said
baltic
exchange
chief
executive
mark
jackson
everything
we
are
doing
now
is
about
increasing
our
for
its
listed
owner
the
far
larger
singapore
exchange
sgx
the
new
products
are
part
of
a
drive
to
expand
its
own
global
presence
and
increase
its
market
share
particularly
in
asia
the
baltic
told
reuters
it
was
developing
two
new
grain
freight
indexes
as
well
as
a
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
index
the
grain
indexes
which
the
company
aims
to
launch
this
year
will
be
tradable
instruments
allowing
investors
to
take
a
position
on
freight
rates
at
a
point
in
the
future
known
as
forward
freight
agreements
or
ffas
the
new
products
will
target
users
including
gas
and
grains
players
moving
the
company
beyond
its
traditional
shipping
base
which
it
hopes
will
help
counter
future
market
shocks
some
of
the
biggest
grains
traders
such
as
groups
cargill
archer
daniels
midland
bunge
and
china
s
cofco
international
have
been
consulted
on
the
development
of
the
new
grains
indexes
according
to
the
two
sources
who
declined
to
be
named
citing
market
sensitivity
cargill
bunge
and
adm
declined
to
comment
alessio
la
rosa
global
head
of
freight
with
cofco
international
confirmed
the
group
was
involved
in
the
initiative
adding
that
it
expected
the
new
indexes
to
be
beneficial
for
sgx
which
acquired
the
baltic
in
for
million
pounds
million
the
new
indexes
could
boost
its
market
share
in
ffa
clearing
volumes
currently
estimated
at
about
percent
and
fend
off
rival
clearing
houses
such
as

nasdaq
and

part
of
the
deutsche
boerse
group
mike
syn
head
of
derivatives
at
sgx
stressed
that
the
baltic
needed
to
expand
its
global
customer
base
profitability
will
result
if
we
are
able
to
get
the
world
to
accept
that
they
need
these
tools
he
said
the
baltic
exchange
which
has
been
located
in
the
heart
of
the
city
of
london
since
its
founding
in
a
coffee
house
in
produces
daily
benchmark
rates
and
indexes
that
are
used
to
trade
and
settle
freight
contracts
it
also
publishes
data
used
in
the
dollar
freight
derivatives
market
it
did
not
disclose
how
much
the
new
products
would
cost
to
develop
launch
and
operate
but
there
are
risks
the
indexes
may
never
take
off
or
could
take
years
to
gain
traction
or
fail
to
provide
significant
returns
sgx
which
has
a
market
value
of
billion
singapore
dollars
billion
does
not
break
out
the
baltic
s
financial
performance
the
last
annual
report
directly
filed
by
the
baltic
exchange
for
the
year
ending
march
showed
its
profit
after
tax
more
than
halved
to
pounds
the
baltic
does
not
have
any
direct
competitors
at
this
stage
but
with
growing
interest
from
investors
in
shipping
this
year
following
an
improvement
in
the
market
the
firm
could
face
potential
challengers
from
players
like
data
provider
s
p
global
platts
or
companies
in
china
such
as
the
shanghai
shipping
exchange
according
to
industry
sources
the
baltic
exchange
is
also
exploring
the
possibility
of
moving
into
air
freight
in
the
future
to
provide
indexes
for
freight
routes
potentially
in
europe
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
ceo
jackson
did
not
confirm
this
saying
the
firm
presently
had
nothing
in
the
pipeline
for
air
freight
but
he
added
we
are
an
established
benchmark
provider
and
if
it
has
got
the
word
freight
in
it
we
should
be
looking
at
sgx
s
syn
added
for
air
freight
as
a
concept
we
would
need
to
learn
to
get
to
know
a
new
group
of
people
and
it
would
not
be
a
before
sgx
s
acquisition
of
the
company
the
baltic
was
privately
owned
by
shareholders
many
of
whom
were
in
the
shipping
industry
and
included
ship
brokers
companies
and
individuals
the
shareholders
before
the
acquisition
did
not
want
the
baltic
to
take
any
risks
jackson
said
we
are
more
reactive
now
more
willing
to
test
things
and
take
the
risk
of
failure
he
added
our
decisions
are
a
lot
more
pounds
singapore
dollars
