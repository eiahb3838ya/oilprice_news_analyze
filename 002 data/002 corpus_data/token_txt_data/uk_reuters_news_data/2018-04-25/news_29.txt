parched
cape
town
in
south
africa
has
managed
to
push
back
its
day
zero
an
estimate
of
when
taps
in
the
city
could
run
dry
to
after
successful
efforts
but
in
india
day
zero
has
come
and
gone
for
residents
in
many
parts
of
the
country
where
taps
failed
long
ago
and
people
have
turned
instead
to
digging
wells
or
buying
water
an
expanding
population
growing
demand
for
water
from
agriculture
and
industry
and
poor
management
of
water
supplies
have
sent
india
s
groundwater
to
ever
lower
levels
that
reality
combined
with
rising
temperatures
threatens
worsening
scarcity
experts
say
nearly
million
people
among
india
s
population
of
billion
or
more
than
one
in
lack
access
to
clean
water
close
to
their
home
according
to
a
wateraid
report
that
is
the
most
of
any
country
in
the
world
according
to
the
charity
which
aims
to
provide
clean
water
and
better
hygeiene
to
people
without
them
disputes
with
neighbours
over
the
sharing
of
water
from
rivers
that
cross
national
boundaries
also
means
tensions
are
rising
as
water
shortages
grow
said
michael
kugelman
a
deputy
director
and
south
asia
expert
at
the
wilson
center
a
policy
think
tank
in
washington
countries
that
get
along
the
least
are
forced
to
share
and
cooperate
over
water
resources
and
many
major
rivers
originate
in
or
pass
through
politically
contested
and
tense
areas
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
so
you
have
population
growth
intensifying
impacts
poor
water
management
and
geopolitical
tensions
it
s
a
perfect
storm
for
greater
water
insecurity
he
said
india
is
entangled
in
water
disputes
with
its
eastern
and
western
neighbours
bangladesh
and
pakistan
which
accuse
it
of
monopolising
water
flows
moving
downstream
toward
them
to
the
north
and
northeast
however
india
fears
a
loss
of
water
to
upstream
china
which
plans
a
series
of
dams
over
the
tsangpo
river
called
the
brahmaputra
as
it
flows
into
eastern
india
while
india
s
rivers
are
governed
by
treaties
on
how
water
should
be
shared
disputes
are
increasing
as
water
shortages
stoke
tensions
apart
from
in
bhutan
and
nepal
south
asia
s
per
capita
water
availability
is
already
below
the
world
average
the
region
could
face
widespread
water
scarcity
less
than
cubic
metres
available
per
person
by
kugelman
said
almost
million
people
in
india
are
at
high
risk
of
being
unable
to
continue
relying
on
surface
water
including
in
the
country
s
northwest
and
south
where
much
of
the
country
s
staple
wheat
and
rice
are
grown
according
to
the
world
resources
institute
water
supply
in
india
may
fall
percent
below
demand
by
the
asian
development
bank
has
forecast
large
parts
of
india
have
already
been
living
with
day
zero
for
a
while
now
said
mridula
ramesh
author
of
an
upcoming
book
on
climate
change
much
of
it
is
because
of
bad
management
most
cities
lose
between
a
third
and
a
fifth
of
their
water
from
pilferage
or
leakage
through
antiquated
pipes
and
we
don
t
treat
and
reuse
wastewater
enough
she
said
bengaluru
karachi
and
kabul
are
among
the
cities
in
the
world
that
are
on
the
verge
of
an
imminent
water
crisis
according
to
a
report
last
month
by
the
centre
for
science
and
environment
cse
a
research
and
advocacy
group
based
in
new
delhi
bengaluru
once
known
as
the
city
of
lakes
now
relies
heavily
on
groundwater
which
is
not
being
naturally
replenished
and
can
not
sustain
the
growing
population
said
sushmita
sengupta
at
cse
day
zeros
are
inevitable
unless
cities
push
for
judicious
use
of
water
including
rainwater
harvesting
and
reuse
of
waste
water
as
well
as
more
efficient
irrigation
and
regulation
of
tubewells
she
said
india
is
one
of
the
largest
consumers
of
groundwater
in
the
world
with
worsening
shortages
attributed
in
part
to
subsidies
that
help
farmers
run
electric
irrigation
pumps
cheaply
for
longer
than
needed
and
to
a
lack
of
limits
on
extracting
water
or
digging
wells
some
states
are
taking
steps
to
manage
water
better
karnataka
and
maharashtra
require
industries
to
use
treated
urban
wastewater
with
gujarat
and
other
states
also
planning
similar
measures
but
regulating
water
use
is
a
politically
sensitive
issue
one
few
policymakers
are
keen
to
address
kugelman
said
that
s
the
case
even
as
thousands
of
farmers
migratw
out
of
parched
rural
areas
or
commit
suicide
as
their
crops
wilt
he
said
water
scarcity
is
expected
to
force
to
million
people
in
india
bangladesh
nepal
and
china
from
their
homes
by
according
to
research
by
the
strategic
foresight
group
in
mumbai
with
greater
migration
to
the
cities
there
will
be
increased
social
disruptions
and
greater
stress
on
water
resources
in
urban
areas
kugelman
predicted
these
will
in
turn
increase
tensions
between
states
and
countries
over
water
even
treaties
can
t
help
