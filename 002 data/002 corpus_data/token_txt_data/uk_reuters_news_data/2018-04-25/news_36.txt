manik
s
firing
and
the
dismissal
of
four
other
executives
along
with
pertamina
s
fuel
sales
losses
starkly
illustrate
the
competing
priorities
of
the
firm

wants
the
company
to
improve
profits
by
reviving
indonesia
s
flagging
oil
output
and
building

fuel
imports
it
also
wants
pertamina

manik
sent
a
statement
by

to
comment
on
his
dismissal
but
saying
pertamina
executives
needed
to
ensure
the
oil

was
not
left
behind
while
working

meet
indonesia
s
energy
security
goals

were

pertamina
dominates
indonesia
s
energy
industry
it
has
a
virtual
monopoly
on
petroleum
imports
and
retail
sales
and
owns
and
operates
the
country

main

the
company
estimates
it
would
need

said
in

a

and
solar
diesel
could
cost
pertamina
losses
of

million
a

this
is
a
burden
on
pertamina
and
so
far
there
has
been
no
discussion
of
compensation
he
told
parliament
the
government
then
added
to
pertamina
s
difficulties
this
year
saying
fuel
prices
would
not
change
until
after
the
elections
and
extended
price
controls
to
all
retail
fuels
while
pertamina
s
growing
upstream
output
will
benefit
from
higher
crude
prices
unless
retail
fuel
prices
are
increased
its
superior
downstream
earnings
will
be
unsustainable
