prosecutors
seized
an
unknown
number
of
files
at
porsche
during
searches
carried
out
by
around
officials
on
april
as
part
of
an
investigation
into

at
the
volkswagen
carmaker
suspected
of
fraud
and
fraudulent

tied
to
manipulated

control
systems
of

passenger
cars
porsche
has
appealed
in
full
against
the
seizure
and
consequential
inspection
of
the
files
the
prosecutor
s
office
in
porsche
s
home
town
of
stuttgart
said
on
wednesday
the
contributor
to
volkswagen
group
profit
is
the
latest
vw
division
to
find
itself
in
the
of
public
prosecutors
after
vw
admitted
to
cheating
emissions
tests
in
the
united
states
in
and
related
investigations
that
have
since
engulfed
luxury
brand
audi
last
week
german
police
arrested
the
head
of
powertrain
development
at
porsche
and
are
holding
him
on
remand
on
concerns
he
could
try
to
destroy
evidence
or
flee
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
a
local
court
will
now
be
tasked
with
deciding
whether
stuttgart
prosecutors
are
entitled
to
process
the
seized
files
a
spokesman
for
the
prosecutors
said
adding
that
porsche
has
a
right
to
lodge
a
complaint
should
the
court
uphold
the
seizure
porsche
said
the
sheer
quantum
of
files
seized
by
the
prosecutors
which
also
included
confidential
data
for
the
carmaker
s
own
lawyers
and
information
irrelevant
to
the
inquiries
have
caused
it
to
file
a
blanket
appeal
against
the
seizures
the
reason
for
the
appeal
is
the
large
number
of
seized
files
that
is
making
it
impossible
for
porsche
to
carry
out
an
assessment
in
the
short
time
available
a
spokesman
said
porsche
fully
cooperates
with
the
relevant
authorities
and
takes
an
interest
in
clearing
up
the
