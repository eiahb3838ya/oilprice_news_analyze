germany: getting into trade conflict with u.s. would be careless
berlin

german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
said
on
wednesday
it
would
be
negligent
to
end
up
in
a
trade
conflict
with
the
united
states
which
has
imposed
tariffs
on
imports
of
steel
and
aluminium
from
some
countries
speaking
just
days
before
chancellor
angela
merkel
travels
to
washington
to
hold
talks
with
president
donald
trump
on
the
issue
altmaier
said
i
remain
convinced
that
it
would
be
careless
to
stumble
into
a
trade
conflict
so
i
think
a
consensual
solution
should
take
precedence
over
a
confrontational
trump
has
given
the
eu
until
may
to
negotiate
permanent
exemptions
from
the
tariffs
asked
whether
updated
german
government
growth
forecasts
included
the
scenario
of
a
hard
brexit
altmaier
said
we
don
t
know
whether
there
will
be
a
hard
brexit
we
are
all
interested
in
avoiding
it
and
the
eu
commission
is
negotiating
with
britain
in
this
spirit
even
if
these
negotiations
were
not
to
lead
to
the
desired
outcome
there
would
unlikely
be
an
impact
on
economic
growth
this
year
so
we
are
safe
with
the
forecast
for
this
reporting

michelle
