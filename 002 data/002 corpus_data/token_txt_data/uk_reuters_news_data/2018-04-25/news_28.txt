shares
were
on
their
way
to
the
longest
losing
streak
of
the
year
on
wednesday
as
an
advance
in
bond
yields
beyond

from

about

having
broken
the
psychologically
key
level
on
tuesday
for
the
first
time
since
the
start
of
it
has
been
down
to
a
mix
of
factors
a
strong
economy
and
rising
commodity
prices
which
are
increasing
the
chance
of
more
interest
rate
hikes
as

fujito
noted
major

the
first
major

to

have
followed
a
similar
pattern
the

reaction
so
far
feels
as
if
we
are
starting
to
see
an
end

after

revenues

will
all
be

also
fuelling

that

may
move
