oil
prices
were
stable
on
wednesday
but
were
below
more
than
highs
reached
the
previous
session
as
rising
fuel
inventories
and
production
dragged
on
an
otherwise
bullish
market
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
but
were
some
way
below
the
high
of
a
barrel
reached
the
previous
day
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
up
cents
or
percent
at
per
barrel
that
was
also
off
the
highs
of
a
barrel
reached
earlier
in
april
overall
many
analysts
say
an
oil
market
slump
that
started
in
has
now
ended
and
is
turning
into
a
sustained
price
rally
due
to
supply
disruptions
and
also
strong
demand
especially
in
asia
that
s
due
to
production
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
which
were
introduced
in
with
the
aim
of
propping
up
the
market
but
also
because
of
political
risk
to
supplies
in
the
middle
east
venezuela
and
africa
market
sentiment
is
turning
increasingly
bullish
towards
the
commodity
said
lukman
otunuga
research
analyst
at
futures
brokerage
fxtm
despite
this
otunga
said
the
sustainability
of
the
rally
is
a
concern
as
it
was
fuelled
largely
by
political
risk
in
the
middle
east
with
rising
production
from
shale
still
a
key
market
theme
that
continues
to
weigh
on
oil
prices
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
much
oil
appreciates
before
bears
enter
the
scene
he
said
crude
oil
production
has
shot
up
by
more
than
a
quarter
since
to
over
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
taking
it
past
saudi
arabia
s
output
of
around
million
bpd
only
russia
currently
produces
more
at
almost
million
bpd
crude
inventories
rose
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
april
to
million
according
to
a
report
by
the
american
petroleum
institute
on
tuesday
