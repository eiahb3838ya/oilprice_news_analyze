to
stick
to
previous
annual
forecasts
cenovus
one
of
the
biggest
of
canada
s
oil
sands
producers
said
in
march
that
it
was
operating
at
lower
capacity
due
to
the
maxing
out
of
pipelines
and
other
routes
through
which
it
sends
heavy
oil
south
to
markets
analysts
had
wondered
if
that
would
threaten
its
previous
targets
for
the
full
year
but
chief
executive
alex
pourbaix
played
down
any
danger
and
shares
rose
percent
in
response
despite
the
temporary
pullback
in
production
in
the
first
quarter
we
still
expect
our
oil
sands
volumes
for
the
year
to
be
within
our
original
guidance
of
to
barrels
per
day
he
told
a
conference
call
with
analysts
i
m
really
confident
that
as
we
move
into
the
second
half
this
year
and
into
the
first
half
of
we
re
going
to
be
seeing
very
material
volumes
of
oil
moving
by
rail

added
railways

for
hauling

have
so
far
been
reluctant

sign

pourbaix
said
that
railway
operators
have
hired
and
are
training
crew
to
handle
crude
shipments
and
have
indicated
that
they
re
reactivating
a
fair
amount
of
the
transport
bottlenecks
have
increased
the
discount
buyers
take
for

cenovus
said
its

averaged
