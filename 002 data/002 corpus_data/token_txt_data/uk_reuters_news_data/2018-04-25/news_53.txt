fujito
noted
major
financial
shares
such
as
goldman
sachs
and
citigroup
as
well
as
google
parent
alphabet
the
first
major
tech
firm
to
report
earnings
have
followed
a
similar
pattern
corporate
earnings
are
in
solid
shape
with
analysts
estimating
percent
growth
in
the
quarter
among
s
firms
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
a
similar
trend
is
expected
globally
if
shares
are
falling
when
corporate
earnings
are
rising
percent
and
the
economy
is
growing
at
percent
the
market
is
in
trouble
the
market
reaction
so
far
feels
as
if
we
are
starting
to
see
an
end
of
its
long
rally
since
investors
could
be
thinking
that
the
best
time
will
be
soon
behind
us
he
said
creeping
gains
in
treasury
yields
are
fuelling
fears
the
yield
a
benchmark
for
global
borrowing
costs
has
been
driven
steadily
higher
by
a
combination
of
concerns
over
inflation
growing
debt
supply
and
rising
federal
reserve
borrowing
costs
the
treasuries
yield
rose
to
as
high
as
percent
on
tuesday
and
last
stood
at
percent
a
break
of
its
january
high
of

could
turn
investors
even
more
bearish

futures
prices
have
been
constantly
falling
this

pricing
in

considerable
chance
of

more

the
end
of
this
year
rising

the

in
the

the

stood
at
not
far
from

low
of

the

traded
at

after
having
jumped
to
a
high
of

on

against
a

the

oil
