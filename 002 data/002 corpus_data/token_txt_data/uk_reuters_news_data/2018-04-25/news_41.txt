hydro
will
miss
its
target
this
year
and
faces
possible
writedowns
as
its
brazilian
operations
work
at
reduced
capacity
following
a
spill
the
norwegian
aluminium
producer
said
on
wednesday
hydro
was
ordered
by
regulators
to
slash
output
from
alunorte
the
world
s
largest
alumina
refinery
which
triggered
cutbacks
at
its
nearby
albras
aluminium
plant
and
a
scramble
among
other
factories
and
customers
for
supplies
unless
it
gets
permission
in
the
second
quarter
to
restart
shuttered
output
it
may
have
to
write
down
the
value
of
alunorte
and
its
related
paragominas
bauxite
mine
and
faces
the
risk
of
impairments
at
albras
and
other
plants
the
company
said
even
if
hydro
wins
permission
to
restart
the
closed
production
lines
at
alunorte
it
would
take
about
three
weeks
to
reach
full
output
the
company
said
as
a
result
hydro
said
its
better
improvement
programme
was
now
expected
to
miss
its
target
of
million
norwegian
crowns
million
in
cost
cuts
this
year
brazilian
authorities
have
ordered
alunorte
which
has
a
capacity
of
about
million
tonnes
of
alumina
per
year
to
halve
production
after
the
plant
admitted
to
making
unlicensed
emissions
of
untreated
water
during
severe
rains
in
february
hydro
has
said
neighbouring
albras
will
also
halve
production
cutting
the
equivalent
of
tonnes
of
aluminium
per
year
hydro
s
brazilian
outage
and
sanctions
imposed
on
russian
rival
rusal
have
caused
fears
of
a
supply
crunch
sending
prices
this
month
to
highs
although
the
rally
later
faded
the
sanctions
on
rusal
caused
great
uncertainty
in
aluminium
markets
and
will
impact
trade
flows
and
availability
of
metal
and
raw
materials
throughout
the
value
chain
hydro
said
the
company
still
expects
percent
growth
in
global
aluminium
demand
in
but
now
predicts
a
supply
deficit
for
the
year
rather
than
the
balanced
market
it
had
previously
anticipated
our
customers
are
worried
chief
executive
svein
richard
brandtzaeg
told
reuters
adding
that
supplies
could
still
flow
from
global
warehouses
to
replace
the
production
cuts
for
some
time
it
s
important
to
remember
that
there
are
some
million
tonnes
of
aluminium
in
storage
brandtzaeg
said
a
decision
to
postpone
the
deadline
for
complying
with
sanctions
to
from
june
has
also
provided
some
relief
he
added
the
company
reiterated
that
it
may
have
to
declare
force
majeure
on
its
contracts
with
rusal
though
it
was
too
early
to
provide
details
on
the
timing
or
volume
impact
hydro
