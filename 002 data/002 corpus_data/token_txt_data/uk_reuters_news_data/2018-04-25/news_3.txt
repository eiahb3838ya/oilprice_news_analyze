despite
data
showing
rising

highs
reached
the
previous
day
on
geopolitical
tensions
including
the
prospect
of
fresh
sanctions
on
iran
french
president
emmanuel
macron
forcefully
challenged
many
of
the
president
s
policies
during
a
visit
to
washington
saying
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
which
president
donald
trump
has
harshly
criticized
was
not
perfect
but
must
remain
in
place
until
a
replacement
is
forged
trump
will
decide
by
may
whether
to
restore
sanctions
on
tehran
which
could
be
a
first
step
to
ending
the
deal
the
market
was
also
supported
by
concerns
around

over

dispute
with

pdvsa
according
to
four
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
geopolitical
risk
in
the

has
a
pretty
high
premium

even
with
this
week
s
department

it
hasn
t
shaken

the
market
rebounded
quickly
from
a
dip
after
bearish
inventory
data
because
the
build
was
not
as
large
as
it
could
have
been
given

mcgillian
said
crude

rose

eia
said
a
rise
in
government
borrowing
costs
to
their
highest
since
this
week
has
tempered
some
investor
appetite
for
risk
but
analysts
said
brent

the
global
benchmark
may
yet
rise
toward
new
peaks

a

cutbacks
steady

growth
geopolitical
tensions
and
a
favorable
structure
in
the
futures
market
have
attracted
record
investment
in
oil
this
year
money
managers
hold
record
positions
in
brent
crude
futures
and
options
lured
by
the
hefty
premium
of
the
june
contract
over
subsequent
months
that
makes
it
profitable
to
invest
in
crude
over
the
longer
term
the
prospect
of
a
downside
correction
in
prices
is
lost
on
the
speculative
fraternity
in
fact
financial
players
have
rarely
felt
more
optimistic
bets
on
rising
crude

are
close
to

oil
associates
strategist
stephen
brennock
said
however
given
the
already
vast
holdings
of
long
positions
in
oil
there
are
doubts
over
the
scope
for
further
the
forward
curve
for
brent
lco
is
now
above
until
the
end
of
and
prices
are
above
through
but
the
rise
in
treasury
yields
above
percent
has
driven
the
dollar
to
highs
making
oil
more
expensive
for
buyers
using
other
currencies
this
might
eventually
pressure
crude
prices
even
though
oil
and
the
dollar
have
moved
in
tandem
for
a
few
weeks
