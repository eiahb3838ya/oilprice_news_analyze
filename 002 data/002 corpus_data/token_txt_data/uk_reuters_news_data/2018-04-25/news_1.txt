an
international
arbitration
court
has
ordered
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
to
pay
conocophillips
billion
for
early
dissolution
of
two
joint
ventures
for
producing
oil
in
the
country
the
firm
said
on
wednesday
conoco
s
assets
in
venezuela
were
expropriated
in
following
a
nationalization
of
the
country
s
oil
industry
led
by
late
president
hugo
chavez
the
firm
left
the
nation
after
it
could
not
reach
a
deal
to
convert
its
projects
into
joint
ventures
controlled
by
pdvsa
the
arbitration
decision
released
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
which
has
no
means
of
enforcing
its
decisions
is
considered
by
the
company
a
first
step
in
a
series
of
legal
actions
to
receive
compensation
for
the
expropriation
of
its
assets
in
venezuela
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
venezuela
s
economy
almost
completely
dependent
on
oil
exports
is
in
the
grip
of
deep
recession
with
hyperinflation
and
severe
shortages
of
medicine
and
food
its
ability
to
pay
has
also
been
hurt
by
sanctions
imposed
on
the
country
and
pdvsa
conoco
said
it
would
pursue
enforcement
and
seek
financial
recovery
of
its
award
but
did
not
elaborate
other
companies
seeking
compensation
from
venezuela
have
tried
to
enforce
awards
through
various
foreign
courts
the
ruling
upholds
the
contractual
protections
to
which
conocophillips
is
entitled
said
janet
langford
carrig
the
company
s
general
counsel
who
called
the
expropriation
conoco
had
sought
up
to
billion
from
pdvsa
for
the
broken
contracts
and
loss
of
future
profits
from
the
hamaca
and
petrozuata
oil
projects
the
agreements
with
pdvsa
had
price
formulas
that
limited
the
compensation
conoco
could
claim
a
separate
arbitration
case
by
conoco
against
venezuela
before
the
world
bank
s
international
centre
for
settlement
of
investment
disputes
icsid
introduced
in
could
issue
a
final
decision
later
this
year
a
lawyer
close
to
the
case
said
a
partial
decision
by
icsid
in
which
declared
the
takeover
unlawful
is
considered
by
conoco
a
positive
step
toward
receiving
more
compensation
for
its
venezuela
assets
exxonmobil
corp
also
brought
two
separate
arbitration
claims
before
icsid
and
the
icc
following
the
nationalization
of
its
projects
in
venezuela
the
company
last
year
sought
to
enforce
a
billion
icsid
award
after
an
annulment
committee
threw
out
nearly
all
of
the
arbitration
decision
that
concerned
one
of
two
projects
reducing
the
payout

million
