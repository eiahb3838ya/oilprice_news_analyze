we
ve
seen
quite
a
lot
of
companies
announcing
earnings
and
their
shares
falling
sharply
said
norihiro
fujito
senior
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
fujito
noted
major
financial
shares
such
as
goldman
sachs
and
citigroup
as
well
as
google
parent
alphabet
the
first
major
tech
firm
to
report
earnings
have
followed
a
similar
pattern
corporate
earnings
are
in
solid
shape
with
analysts
estimating
percent
growth
in
the
quarter
among
s
firms
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
a
similar
trend
is
expected
globally
if
shares
are
falling
when
corporate
earnings
are
rising
percent
and
the
economy
is
growing
at
percent
the
market
is
in
trouble
the
market
reaction
so
far
feels
as
if
we
are
starting
to
see
an
end
of
its
long
rally
since
investors
could
be
thinking
that
the
best
time
will
be
soon
behind
us
he
said
creeping
gains
in
treasury
yields
are
fuelling
fears
that
portfolio
managers
may
move
money
into
safer
securities
at
the
expense
of
riskier
assets
like
stocks
and
emerging
markets
the
yield
a
benchmark
for
global
borrowing
costs
has
been
driven
steadily
higher
by
a
combination
of
concerns
over
inflation
growing
debt
supply
and
rising
federal
reserve
borrowing
costs
the
treasuries
yield
rose
to
as
high
as
percent
a
break
of
its
january
high
of
percent
could
turn
investors
even
more
bearish
fed
funds
rate
futures
prices
have
been
constantly
falling
this
month
pricing
in
a
considerable
chance
of
three
more
rate
hikes
by
the
end
of
this
year
the
impact
is
already
reverberating
in
many
emerging
markets
with
jpmorgan
s
emerging
market
bond
index
hitting
a
low
in
indonesia
a
market
with
one
of
the
largest
exposures
to
foreign
portfolio
holdings
the
authorities
have
been
intervening
heavily
to
put
a
floor
under
the
rupiah
which
has
been
flirted
with
lows
the
indian
rupee
hit
a
low
higher
yields
are
no
doubt
having
a
negative
impact
on
emerging
markets
we
are
likely
to
see
outflows
from
emerging
market
bonds
said
takahiko
sasaki
market
economist
at
mizuho
bank
the
dollar
also
gained
a
tad
against
major
currencies
the
euro
stood
at
not
far
from
tuesday
s
low
of
a
low
last
seen
on
march
the
dollar
traded
at
yen
after
having
jumped
to
a
high
of
yen
on
tuesday
the
australian
dollar
fell
percent
to
a
low
of
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
the
dollar
index
edged
up
percent
oil
prices
were
stable
but
were
below
the
more
than
highs
reached
the
previous
session
as
rising
fuel
inventories
and
production
weighed
on
an
otherwise
bullish
market
