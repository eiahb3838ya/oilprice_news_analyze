uk minister "deeply regrets" failing to spot scale of windrush migrant problem
london
reuters
interior
minister
amber
rudd
said
on
wednesday
she
deeply
regretted
failing
to
realise
there
was
a
widespread
problem
that
some
caribbean
immigrants
who
have
lived
legally
in
britain
for
decades
were
being
labelled
illegal
immigrants
rudd
told
a
parliamentary
committee
she
had
known
about
the
problem
for
months
and
said
officials
were
still
checking
how
many
people
had
been
detained
over
their
supposed
immigration
status
i
look
back
with
hindsight
and
i
m
surprised
i
did
not
see
the
shape
of
it
sooner
rudd
said
i
bitterly
deeply
regret
that
i
didn
t
see
it
as
more
than
individual
cases
that
had
gone
wrong
that
needed
addressing
i
didn
t
see
it
as
a
systemic
issue
until
very
thousands
of
people
from
the
windrush
generation
were
invited
to
britain
to
plug
labour
shortfalls
between
and
but
some
of
them
and
their
descendants
have
been
caught
out
by
tighter
immigration
rules
the
issue
has
created
anger
in
britain
after
it
was
revealed
some
of
these
migrants
have
been
made
homeless
lost
their
jobs
threatened
with
deportation
and
denied
benefits
raising
awkward
questions
about
how
the
pursuit
of
lower
immigration
sits
alongside
the
desire
to
be
an
global
economy
the
crisis
has
focussed
attention
on
the
role
of
prime
minister
theresa
may
who
as
interior
minister
set
out
to
create
a
really
hostile
environment
for
illegal
immigrants
imposing
tough
new
requirements
in
for
people
to
prove
their
legal
status
rudd
told
the
committee
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
of
these
migrants
had
been
kicked
out
of
britain
as
a
result
of
the
scandal
after
officials
examined
deportation
records
dating
back
almost
two
decades
but
she
admitted
her
department
still
had
no
idea
how
many
migrants
have
been
wrongly
detained
by
immigration
authorities
like
the
grandmother
paulette
wilson
who
spent
a
week
in
detention
after
being
told
she
was
in
britain
illegally
earlier
the
opposition
labour
party
leader
jeremy
corbyn
called
on
rudd
to
resign
for
a
cruel
and
misdirected
immigration
policy
that
he
said
was
responsible
for
the
hardships
faced
by
the
windrush
generation
the
current
interior
minister
inherited
a
failing
policy
and
made
it
worse
isn
t
it
time
she
took
responsibility
and
resigned
