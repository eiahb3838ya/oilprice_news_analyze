soon
after
taking

in
indonesian
president
joko
widodo
made
a
landmark
decision
to
cut
subsidies
on
politically
sensitive
fuel
prices
to
boost
the
economy
but
a
year
out
from
a
tough
campaign
his
reformist
zeal
may
be
waning
markets
cheered
widodo
s
gamble
to
free
up
billions
of
dollars
to
build
infrastructure
while
the
former
furniture
salesman
also
unveiled
a
series
of
reforms
to
slash

holding

southeast
asia
s
biggest
economy
now
less
than
a
year
from
an
expected

widodo
has
made
a
strategic
policy
shift
say
senior
government
officials
dropping
nearly
billion
of
infrastructure
projects
to
focus
on
social
welfare
the
government
has
also
slapped
price
controls
on
staple
goods
such
as
fuel
power
rice
and
sugar
moves
that
will
surely
be
welcomed
by
voters
of
course
he
s
thinking
about
elections
with
these
moves
he
can
gain
popularity
by
benefiting
the
people
and
ensuring
welfare
both
in
the
and
said
one
senior

who
declined
to

he
was

the
issue
economists
warn
widodo
s
return
to
populist
policies
may
threaten
indonesia
s
investment
climate
with
national
elections
around
the
corner
widodo
appears
to
be
backtracking
on
his
reform
agenda
with
a
string
of
populist
measures
moves
that
would
pressure
firms
profit
margins
and
weigh
on
the
investment
climate

in
a
note
last
week
widodo
took
office
promising
to
boost
annual
economic
growth
to
percent
and
with
an
ambitious
plan
to
build
billion
worth
of
infrastructure
across
the
poorly
connected
archipelago
indonesia
has
since
earned
coveted
upgrades
from

moody

index
the
old
widodo
still
enjoys
high
public
approval
with
recent

giving
him
a
double
digit
lead
over
his
main
rival
former
general
prabowo
subianto
widodo
only
narrowly
defeated
subianto
in
a
bitterly
fought

subianto
is
expected
to
campaign
on

and
a
perceived

chinese
investment
at
a
time
when
economic
growth
is
stagnating
at
around
percent
and
consumption
has
been
persistently
sluggish
asked
about
the
government
s
change
in
policy
focus
widodo
s
said
it
was
time
to
be
realistic
development
should
not
just
be
in
the
physical
sector
but
also
be
oriented
to
the
sector
like
vocational
schools
education
religious
schools
health
moeldoko
a
former
military
commander
said
in
an
interview
with
reuters
the
president
is
aware
that
we
are
achieving
some
success
in
the
investment
area
in
infrastructure
in
ease
of
doing
business
and
in
deregulation
so
we
can
leap
to
the
next
stage
which
is
to
focus
on
human
development
he
told
reuters
data
shows
that
as
of
the
end
of
around
billion
worth
of
roads
ports
bridges
and
dams
had
been
built
or
were
under
construction
but
experts
say
it
s
unlikely
the
remainder
of
the
programme
can
be
finished
before
the
end
of
widodo
s
term
in
oct
denni
purbasari
the
president
s
deputy
for
economic
affairs
said
the
government
had
taken
into
account
external
factors
like
rising
global
oil
prices
in
its
decision
to
funds
to
public
welfare
it
s
important
to
balance
between
economic
progress
and
the
burden
borne
by
the
people
we
percent
believe
that
an
adjustment
must
be
made
to
fuel
subsidies
said
purbasari
motorcycle
taxi
driver
ibrahim
naben
believes
widodo
s
new
policies
can
only
boost
the
president
s
support
base
jokowi
has
been
fair
and
has
a
record
of
policies
that
help
the
poor
even
in
the
most
remote
islands
naben
said
using
the
president
s
nickname
we
re
not
feeling
the
effects
yet
but
we
anticipate
any
price
controls
will
be
good
for
widodo
plans
to
keep
electricity
tariffs
and
fuel
prices
unchanged
over
the
next
two
years
by
hiking
subsidies
by
million
in
and
making
state
owned
enterprises
soes
foot
the
rest
of
the
bill
critics
say
the
move
is
a
reversal
of
the
decision
to
scrap
fuel
subsidies
and
that
the
government
is
essentially
forcing
soes
to
subsidise
prices
moody
s
has
said
it
could
undo
its
recent
upgrade
of
indonesia
s
government
debt
if
the
financial
health
of
soes
worsened
and
threatened
the
government
s
balance
sheet
the
finance
ministry
has
said
it
will
monitor
such
risks
another
plan
to
force
fuel
retailers
to
get
government
approval
before
changing
prices
has
been
criticised
as
distorting
the
market
other
efforts
to
boost
purchasing
power
include
imposing
a
ceiling
price
on
rice
even
though
traders
say
the
upcoming
main
harvest
of
the
staple
should
contain
prices
government
officials
insist
the
policy
changes
will
not
affect
the
core
discipline
of
widodo
s
economic
agenda
finance
minister
sri
mulyani
indrawati
recently
told
foreign
correspondents
the
government
was
not
returning
to
subsidising
everything
and
was
not
curtailing
market
mechanisms
this
year
s
budget
deficit
would
be
under
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
well
below
a
legal
cap
of
percent
she
said
arianto
patunru
a
researcher
on
indonesia
s
economy
at
australian
national
university
said
widodo
s
actions
should
be
seen
in
the
context
of
a
global
shift
towards
populist
policies
if
the
indonesian
government
is
carried
away
with
this
trend
i
think
the
prospect
is
not
so
bright
he
said
adding
it
was
too
early
to
say
if
it
was
a
risk
to
economic
reforms
in
the
southeast
asian
nation
