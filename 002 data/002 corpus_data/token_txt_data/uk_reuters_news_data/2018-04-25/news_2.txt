of
its
joint
venture
with
the
opec
nation
s
oil
firm
the
sources
said
the

in
a
raid
by
national
intelligence
officers
were
the
first
at
a
foreign
oil
firm
since
venezuela
s
government
launched
a

last
fall
that
has
resulted
in
detentions

more
than
executives
at

may

venezuela

foreign

jorge
arreaza
linked
the
chevron
arrests
to
the
government
probe
for
the
first
time
on
wednesday
in
our
oil
industry
and
in
its
relationships
with
other
countries
there
has
been
corruption

said
at
a
news
conference
at
the
united
nations
headquarters
in
new
york
that
was
broadcast
on
venezuela
state
television
the
decisions
of
the
prosecutor
s
office
are
based
on
serious
investigations
to
fight
corruption
these
two
people
involved
have
the
right
to
defence
and
due
of
chevron
s
evacuation
of
executives
arreaza
said
the
logical
decision
would
be
to
turn
themselves
over
to
authorities
and
demonstrate
their
innocence
not
to
chevron
spokeswoman
isabel
ordonez
responded
to
the
minister
s
comments
with
a
written
statement
that
the
firm
abides
by
a
code
of
business
ethics
under
which
we
comply
with
all
applicable
and
venezuelan
chevron
s
move
to
evacuate
its
expatriate
workforce
underscores
the
how
arduous
it
has
become
for
foreign
oil
firms
and
their
workers
to
sustain
operations
through
venezuela
s
accelerating
political
and
economic
meltdown

ordonez
said
the

had
an
executive
team
overseeing
operations
in
venezuela
but
declined
to
provide
details
on
the
leadership
there
or
the
number
and
type
of
workers
the
company
had
withdrawn
last
week
the
company
said
it
was
working
for
the
release
of
the
detained
workers
carlos
algarra
and
rene
vasquez
who
are
represented
by
chevron
lawyers
chevron
has
no
plans
to
exit
the
country
according
to
a
person
familiar
with
the
thinking
of
its
board
of
directors
the
oil
company
has
not
pulled
out
of
other
tough
environments
in
the
past
the
person
said
citing
the
jailing
of
employees
in
indonesia
in
and
the
firm
believes
venezuela
will
eventually
stabilise

publicly
traded
oil
producer
with

operates
in

mostly
through
minority
stakes
in
five
projects
across
the

the

has
about
employees
in
its
puerto

headquarters
and
has
two
more
offices
in
the
country
its
earnings
from
venezuela
dropped
percent
last
year
to

million
according
to
regulatory
filings
the
arrests
mark
an
escalation
of
tensions
between
pdvsa
and
foreign
companies
over
control
of
supply
contracts
and
the
joint
ventures
governance
sources
familiar
with
the
dispute
told
reuters
outside
firms
say
they
are
increasingly
faced
with
impossible
dilemmas
if
their
executives
sign
contracts
without
following
their
companies
due
process
rules
they
run
the
risk
of
violating
compliance
standards
meant
to
control
costs
and
guard
against
corruption
if
they
don
t
sign
they
stoke
tension
with
their
partners
at
pdvsa
which
has
a
controlling
interest
in
all
joint
ventures
companies
evaluating
an
exit
from
venezuela
have
limited
options
because
few
if
any
international
firms
would
pay
anything
close
to
full
value
for
assets
in
the
country
amid
the
ongoing
turmoil
according
to
interviews
with
three
executives
of
oil
firms
that
have
operated
in
venezuela
but
continuing
operations
often
means
stomaching
steep
losses
taking
massive
and
now
the
threat
of
having
staff
arrested
by
the
embattled
socialist
government
of
president
nicolas
maduro
pdvsa
s
deteriorating
infrastructure
and
cash
flow
have
caused
oil
production
to
plunge
percent
in
a
year
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
march
according
to
official
data
reported
to
opec
venezuela
s
oil
output
so
far
this
year
is
at
a
low
the
falling
production
and
arrests
of
pdvsa
executives
on
allegations
of
corruption
picked
up
speed
late
last
year
after
maduro
named
a
military
chief
with
no
oil
industry
experience
major
general
manuel
quevedo
as
the
nation
s
oil
minister
and
president
of
pdvsa
several
of
chevron
s
foreign
staff
and
some
local
executives
and
their
families
left
venezuela
starting
last
week
after
the
arrests
the
four
sources
familiar
with
their
departures
told
reuters
they
described
the
situation
as
temporary
and
said
executives
may
return
if
proposed
talks
between
chevron
and
pdvsa
to
resolve
the
dispute
are
successful
chevron
executives
have
had
meetings
with
venezuelan
government
officials
this
week
said
two
of
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
chevron
and
other
firms
aim
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
what
happened
to
exxon
mobil
corp
and
conocophillips
in
venezuela
in
when
the
government
of
hugo
chavez
expropriated
their
assets
after
they
could
not
reach
an
agreement
to
convert
their
projects
into
joint
ventures
no
company
can
leave
because
it
would
lose
the
assets
said
a
former
negotiator
of
exxon
s
exit
from
venezuela
at
this
point
there
are
just
a
few
chevron
employees
remaining
in
venezuela
are
concerned
they
may
be
vulnerable
to
detention
following
the
departure
of
senior
management
according
to
interviews
with
employees
and
family
members
the
arrested
chevron
workers
oversaw
operations
and
procurement
at
petropiar
an
oil
production
and
processing
project
by
pdvsa
and
chevron
chevron
has
asked
employees
assigned
to
petropiar
to
temporarily
work
from
the
firm
s
puerto
la
cruz
office
rather
than
show
up
at
its
partner
s
oil
production
and
processing
facilities
according
to
one
person
familiar
with
the
situation
the
two
men
had
refused
to
sign
a
dollar
contract
under
an
emergency
decree
to
buy
imported
parts
required
by
petropiar
according
to
six
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
contract
dispute
such
decrees
which
skip
competitive
bidding
have
been
cited
by
venezuelan
and
prosecutors
as
a
means
of
extracting
bribes
in
some
recent
corruption
cases
algarra
and
vasquez
are
now
being
held
in
a
detention
centre
in
barcelona
run
by
venezuela
s
intelligence
unit
known
as
sebin
coworkers
and
relatives
have
brought
them
food
to
supplement
what
they
are
provided
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
said
several
other
foreign
energy
companies
have
written
down
the
value
of
their
venezuela
assets
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
or
halted
most
operations
keeping
only
a
skeletal
staff
in
the
country
spain
s
repsol
took
a
charge
of
about
billion
on
its
venezuelan
assets
in
the
prior
quarter

eni
said
it
was
owed
million

it
wrote
off
all
remaining
assets
in
the
country
adding
a
million
charge
on
top
of
million
in
charges
last
year
other
international
oil
firms
including
france
s
total
sa
have
withdrawn
foreign
staff
in
recent
years
and
reduced
investment
as
living
conditions
have
deteriorated
i
can
tell
you
it
is
difficult
for
our
people
because
of
lack
of
power
lack
of
water
said
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
last
week
at
an
oil
summit
in
paris
the
company
would
maintain
a
presence
there
however
on
the
hope
the
crisis
would
ease
it
is
important
to
stay
in
a
country
even
in
difficult
times
