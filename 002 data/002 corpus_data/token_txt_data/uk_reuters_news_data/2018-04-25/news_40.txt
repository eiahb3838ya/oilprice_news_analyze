the
singapore
fuel
oil
market
has
rallied
this
week
as
inventories
have
dropped
at
the
same
time
that
some
supplies
in
the
region
do
not
meet
the
standards
for
use
as
shipping
fuel
further
reducing
the
amount
of
supply
available
five
trade
sources
said
cash
premiums
for
fuel
oil
which
is
primarily
sold
for
ship
fuel
known
as
bunker
fuel
have
soared
this
week
to
the
highest
since
may
the
premium
of
the
swap
for
the
fuel
over
the
swap
has
jumped
to
the
highest
since
october
underscoring
a
surge
in
demand
for
prompt
supply
the
sources
said
the
supply
tightness
stems
from
too
much
of
the
supply
of
bunker
fuel
being
meaning
that
it
does
not
meet
the
standards
for
use
on
ships
singapore
is
the
world
s
biggest
bunker
fuel
market
three
of
the
sources
said
there
were
problems
with
the
amount
of
metals
and
concerns
about
the
flashpoint
or
the
temperature
at
which
vapours
of
the
fuel
oil
will
ignite
of
some
of
the
bunker
supply
which
impacts
the
ability
to
store
the
fuel
onboard
a
vessel
the
market
strength
in
the
prompt
is
due
to
bunker
issues
said
one
of
the
sources
a
fuel
oil
trader
which
forced
shippers
to
reject
some
cargoes
and
seek
alternatives
one
source
said
the
quality
problems
may
originate
from
blending
fuel
onboard
ships
where
the
blending
process
can
not
be
done
as
well
as
at
large
and
specialised
onshore
facilities
the
traders
declined
to
be
identified
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
the
quality
of
the
bunker
fuel
could
be
improved
by
blending
it
with
fuel
in
onshore
tanks
however
the
amount
of
fuel
oil
stored
in
tanks
to
blend
with
has
declined
as
there
is
no
incentive
to
store
fuel
because
the
market
is
in
backwardation
when
prices
for
future
delivery
are
lower
than
those
for
immediate
dispatch
landed
physical
fuel
oil
storage
leased
out
in
singapore
the
world
s
largest
bunker
market
fell
by
an
estimated
percent
over
the
past
to
months
said
mike
beviss
director
of
special
projects
at
eastport
maritime
a
consultancy
singapore
onshore
fuel
oil
inventories
fell
to
a
more
than
low
of
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
april
the
latest
official
data
showed
adding
to
the
shortage
of
quality
cargoes
is
rising
demand
ahead
of
the
high
consumption
summer
period
in
the
northern
hemisphere
regional
demand
has
swung
big
time
too
with
the
gulf
india
and
south
korea
pulling
instead
of
pushing
