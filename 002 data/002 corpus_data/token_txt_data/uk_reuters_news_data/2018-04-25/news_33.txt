south
sudan
president
salva
kiir
has
rejected
opposition
calls
for
him
to
resign
as
part
of
efforts
to
end
a
civil
war
accusing
groups
of
making
unreasonable
demands
in
peace
talks
despite
several
agreements
and
ceasefires
fighting
has
rumbled
on
in
south
sudan
with
barely
any
break
since
it
first
erupted
in
just
two
years
after
independence
killing
tens
of
thousands
in
talks
in
the
ethiopian
capital
addis
ababa
led
by
east
african
bloc
igad
opposition
groups
last
month
demanded
kiir
step
aside
they
also
want
a
transitional
parliament
dissolved
and
replaced
by
a
new
one
formed
with
less
than
members
the
people
who
are
fighting
with
us
have
unreasonable
conditions
to
make
peace
kiir
said
during
a
ceremony
for
his
deceased
army
chief
general
james
ajongo
mawut
late
on
tuesday
they
think
that
i
am
the
obstacle
to
peace
and
if
i
am
removed
after
signing
the
agreement
then
there
will
be
no
problem
he
added
they
want
me
to
sign
the
agreement
and
then
step
down
immediately
just
imagine
what
is
my
incentive
in
bringing
peace
if
it
is
peace
that
i
will
bring
and
then
i
step
aside
nobody
can
do
it
bashir
sudanese
president
omar
didn
t
do
it
when
we
are
fighting
with
the
government
and
rebel
groups
signed
the
latest
ceasefire
in
december
in
addis
ababa
aiming
to
revive
a
pact
reached
in
but
the
truce
was
violated
within
hours
another
series
of
talks
that
were
scheduled
for
this
week
were
postponed
and
are
now
expected
to
take
place
in
early
may
civil
war
first
erupted
when
troops
loyal
to
kiir
clashed
with
forces
loyal
to
riek
machar
then
the
vice
president
tens
of
thousands
of
people
have
been
killed
and
much
of
the
nation
has
faced
dire
food
shortages
igad
said
last
month
machar
should
be
released
from
house
arrest
in
south
africa
as
soon
as
possible
on
condition
that
he
renounces
violence
the
fighting
has
slashed
oil
production
and
driven
about
a
third
of
the
population
of
million
from
their
homes
the
refugee
agency
estimates
million
will
be
refugees
in
neighbouring
countries
by
the
end
of
this
year
kiir
also
dismissed
calls
to
dissolve
the
parliament
if
we
were
to
sign
an
agreement
the
agreement
has
to
be
endorsed
by
the
parliament
so
that
it
is
passed
into
law
if
the
parliament
is
dissolved
then
what
do
we
do
with
the
agreement
he
said
we
will
not
work
for
such
