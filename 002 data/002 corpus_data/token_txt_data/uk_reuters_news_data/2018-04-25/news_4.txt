april
reuters
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
has
given
up
on
the
idea
of
selling
its
brazilian
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
unit
through
an
initial
public
offering
ipo
and
decided
to
reopen
a
sale
process
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
the
oil
company
has
not
yet
set
a
date
for
interested
companies
to
deliver
bids
and
is
still
discussing
the
best
way
to
avoid
problems
with
antitrust
authorities
the
sources
added
asking
for
anonymity
because
talks
are
private
petrobras
as
the
company
is
known
has
sounded
out
banks
and
investors
for
a
potential
ipo
of
liquigas
distribuidora
sa
but
advisers
said
it
would
be
a
hard
sell
especially
to
international
investors
according
to
the
sources
liquigas
sells
gas
cylinders
used
mainly
for
cooking
in
brazilian
households
not
served
by
gas
pipelines
a
segment
unfamiliar
to
investors
in
more
developed
markets
petrobras
had
agreed
to
sell
the
subsidiary
to
a
unit
of
ultrapar
participações
sa
in
for
billion
reais
million
but
brazilian
antitrust
watchdog
cade
blocked
the
deal
ultragaz
a
unit
of
ultrapar
is
brazil
s
largest
lpg
distributor
and
liquigas
is
the
second
biggest
in
talks
with
banks
petrobras
has
discussed
how
to
structure
the
sale
process
without
triggering
antitrust
issues
the
easiest
solution
would
be
a
sale
to
foreign
buyers
with
similar
businesses
such
as
turkey
s
aygaz
as
or
chile
s
empresas
copec
sa
sources
said
some
of
the
brazilian
rivals
that
bid
for
the
asset
are
still
interested
such
as
copagaz
distribuidora
de
gas
but
a
sale
to
a
brazilian
rival
would
be
trickier
and
some
representatives
of
brazilian
companies
have
been
lobbying
petrobras
to
break
up
the
subsidiary
before
the
sale
one
of
the
sources
said
a
third
option
would
be
to
require
proposals
that
already
include
remedies
for
potential
antitrust
concerns
so
far
no
decision
has
been
taken
the
sources
added
petrobras
responded
to
a
request
for
comment
by
referring
to
a
previous
securities
filing
in
which
it
said
details
of
the
deal
had
not
been
defined
copagaz
aygaz
and
copec
did
not
immediately
comment
on
the
matter
