reuters
ukrainian
military
pilot
mykola
volkozub
could
barely
move
under
the
weight
of
a
lead
vest
meant
to
protect
him
from
radiation
as
he
prepared
for
his
first
flight
over
the
chernobyl
reactor
after
the
world
s
worst
nuclear
disaster
in
remembering
the
incident
still
brings
tears
to
the
eyes
of
volkozub
who
survived
the
risk
of
radiation
poisoning
to
live
to
a
ripe
age
of
and
still
supervises
test
pilots
for
antonov
a
aircraft
manufacturer
volkozub
was
deployed
in
a
team
of
two
pilots
an
engineer
and
a
scientist
to
fly
an
helicopter
over
the
reactor
to
measure
the
temperature
and
composition
of
gases
inside
thursday
marks
the
anniversary
of
the
chernobyl
disaster
in
ukraine
caused
by
a
botched
safety
test
in
the
fourth
reactor
of
the
atomic
plant
that
sent
clouds
of
nuclear
material
across
much
of
europe
the
accident
killed
dozens
right
away
and
forced
tens
of
thousands
to
flee
the
final
death
toll
of
those
killed
by
illnesses
such
as
cancer
is
subject
to
debate
speaking
ahead
of
the
anniversary
volkozub
called
it
a
tragedy
and
recalls
agreeing
to
fly
the
mission
despite
knowing
his
life
would
be
at
risk
for
some
reason
i
thought
i
would
feel
bad
if
something
happened
to
someone
else
there
and
i
am
not
there
that
s
why
i
took
such
a
decision
immediately
he
told
reuters
in
the
hangar
at
an
antonov
factory
where
he
has
worked
for
years
volkozub
was
awarded
a
hero
of
ukraine
medal
for
his
efforts
after
performing
three
flights
which
lasted
for
minutes
seconds
in
total
volkozub
was
exposed
to
such
a
high
dose
of
radiation
that
some
dosimeters
went
haywire
when
he
tried
to
measure
his
exposure
the
helicopter
was
also
exposed
to
radiation
and
had
to
be
buried
at
a
cemetery
for
decommissioned
equipment
something
he
recalls
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
landed
there
near
the
site
and
when
i
left
the
place
i
felt
very
sorry
for
the
helicopter
it
seemed
to
me
it
had
not
failed
me
but
i
had
to
throw
it
away
he
said
right
after
his
third
flight
on
may
volkozub
was
sent
to
moscow
for
medical
tests
he
remembered
how
nurses
afraid
of
contamination
pushed
food
towards
him
with
the
help
of
a
long
stick
to
avoid
physical
interaction
with
him
