global
wind
energy
capacity
could
increase
by
more
than
half
over
the
next
five
years
as
costs
continue
to
fall
and
the
market
returns
to
growth
at
the
end
of
this
decade
a
report
by
the
global
wind
energy
council
shows
in
its
annual
report
on
the
status
of
the
global
wind
industry
the
gwec
said
cumulative
wind
energy
capacity
stood
at
gigawatts
gw
at
the
end
of
last
year
percent
higher
than
the
previous
year
that
should
increase
by
percent
to
gw
by
the
end
of
as
countries
develop
more
renewable
energy
to
meet
emissions
cut
targets
and
prices
continue
to
fall
the
wind
industry
association
said
around
gigawatts
gw
of
new
wind
power
capacity
was
added
worldwide
last
year
down
slightly
from
gw
in
the
gwec
expects
the
market
to
be
flat
this
year
but
start
growing
again
from
the
annual
market
will
return
to
growth
in
and
breaching
the
gw
barrier
once
again
and
continue
to
grow
albeit
at
a
slower
pace
in
the
beginning
of
the
new
decade
the
gwec
said
in
its
report
we
expect
to
see
total
cumulative
installations
reach
gw
by
the
end
of
it
added
wind
power
has
become
more
competitive
over
the
past
few
years
with
a
move
from
government
subsidies
to
auctions
which
has
brought
costs
down
further
overall
offshore
prices
for
projects
to
be
completed
in
the
next
five
years
or
so
are
half
of
what
they
were
for
the
last
five
years
and
this
trend
is
likely
to
continue
the
report
said
china
continues
to
be
the
biggest
wind
market
in
the
world
adding
nearly
gw
of
new
capacity
in
though
this
was
percent
lower
than
the
previous
year
the
pace
of
china
s
wind
development
is
gradually
slowing
down
and
growth
is
expected
to
be
flat
to
india
experienced
record
wind
installations
last
year
adding
over
gw
but
gwec
expects
this
to
slow
this
year
due
to
a
transition
period
between
old
market
incentives
and
moving
towards
an
system
the
gwec
said
the
european
union
also
had
a
record
year
in
with
gw
added
the
bloc
is
expected
to
install
around
gw
of
new
wind
power
by
the
end
of
reaching
a
cumulative
total
of
gw
the
united
states
added
gw
of
new
wind
capacity
last
year
despite
attempts
to
change
the
structure
of
tax
credits
last
year
the
provisions
remained
intact
and
continue
to
support
the
industry
