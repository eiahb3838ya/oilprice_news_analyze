oslo
reuters
norwegian
offshore
oil
services
firm
subsea
is
open
to
potentially
sweetening
its
billion
billion
pounds
offer
for
mcdermott
if
the
company
would
work
with
it
to
identify
additional
benefits
of
a
deal
subsea
said
on
wednesday
the
norwegian
firm
s
comments
come
a
week
before
mcdermott
s
shareholders
vote
on
a
planned
combination
with
chicago
bridge
and
iron
cb
i
which
mcdermott
s
board
has
recommended
its
investors
to
support
while
rejected
subsea
s
proposal
subsea
is
open
to
considering
amending
its
proposal
if
it
can
discover
additional
value
through
discussions
with
the
mcdermott
management
team
subsea
one
fifth
owned
by
norwegian
billionaire
kristian
siem
said
in
a
statement
siem
who
is
also
subsea
s
chairman
declined
to
say
specifically
whether
the
company
was
willing
to
pay
more
than
the
per
share
rejected
by
mcdermott
s
board
on
april
some
analysts
say
that
depending
on
potential
synergies
subsea
could
increase
its
offer
to
a
least
a
share
but
it
can
t
do
that
without
more
information
from
mcdermott
subsea
repeated
on
wednesday
its
proposal
was
subject
to
the
termination
of
mcdermott
s
planned
transaction
with
cb
i
italian
oil
services
group
saipem
which
competes
with
subsea
in
providing
undersea
solutions
for
oil
and
gas
firms
has
said
the
bid
for
mcdermott
is
a
sign
of
industry
consolidation
that
has
to
be
monitored
closely
the
move
comes
after
schlumberger
and
subsea
started
talks
earlier
this
year
to
form
a
joint
venture
to
deliver
undersea
installations
and
services
oil
firms
have
returned
to
profit
thanks
to
higher
oil
prices
and
cost
cuts
made
in
the
recent
downturn
but
their
suppliers
are
still
feeling
the
squeeze
siem
has
long
called
for
the
industry
to
consolidate
as
a
way
of
coping
siem
doesn
t
care
about
the
market
share
but
about
the
value
he
wouldn
t
do
that
buy
mcdermott
if
it
would
not
create
value
for
shareholders
