disappointed
on

with

failed

its

business
that

industry
suffered
yet
again
with

clariant
said
in
a
statement
this
however
is
expected
to
improve
throughout
the

due

the

lacklustre
margin
added
to

clariant

fears
clariant
s

seems
pretty
demanding

clariant
s
kottmann
remained
confident
the
company
will
hit
its
goals
of
boosting
sales
and
operating

and
also
stuck
to
his

for
