point
triggered
by

last

the

anything
the

of
the
gyrations
in

a
fall
in
the
vix
index
a
gauge
of
expected
volatilities
in
stocks
also
helped
underpin
improving
sentiment
the
recent
is
believed
to
have
been
amplified
by
a
jump
in
the
vix
as
many
players
are
thought
to
have
adjusted
their
portfolio
in
line
with
the
change
in
volatilities
the
latest
rout
was
driven
more
by
forced
selling
of
such
players
as
