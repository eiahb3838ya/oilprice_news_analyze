it
s
the
burning
question
in
the
oil
industry
when
will
saudi
arabia
pull
the
trigger
on
the
aramco
stock
market
listing
many
industry
experts
are
focusing
on
the
current
level
of
oil
prices
however
another
key
consideration
for
saudi
officials
in
floating
up
to
percent
of
the
state
oil
producer
is
where
they
see
prices
in
one
to
two
years
time
two
sources
close
to
the
ipo
said
the
riyadh
government
is
carefully
analysing
the
future
price
curve
structure
in
oil
markets
because
it
regards
prices
further
out
as
an
important
element
in
achieving
a
high
valuation
in
what
could
be
the
biggest
initial
public
offering
in
history
the
sources
told
reuters
ideally
prices
for
one
and
two
years
ahead
need
to
move
at
least
higher
to
around
per
barrel
for
the
government
to
be
happy
to
launch
the
listing
said
the
sources
who
declined
to
be
named
as
the
information
is
confidential
when
will
the
ideal
moment
come
said
one
of
the
sources
maybe
you
should
also
look
at
the
forward
curve
for
oil
as
the
forward
curve
will
be
key
for
investors
valuing
the
saudi
energy
ministry
and
saudi
aramco
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
many
considerations
are
likely
to
influence
the
ipo
timing
and
the
final
decision
may
rest
with
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
but
if
prices
at
around
are
an
important
factor
this
could
indicate
a
listing
may
be
some
way
away
brent
oil
futures
for
march
are
valued
now
at
about
a
discount
to
the
current
spot
price
and
for
two
years
away
at
saudi
officials
have
given
few
clues
about
the
ipo
with
energy
minister
khalid
and
finance
minister
mohammed
saying
only
that
the
government
will
proceed
when
the
time
is
right
spot
and
prices
often
do
not
move
together
immediate
prices
are
more
influenced
by
developments
such
as
politically
driven
supply
outages
or
natural
disasters
while
prices
further
down
the
curve
are
more
affected
by
broader
expectations
of
supply
and
demand
factoring
in
issues
such
as
opec
output
policy
and
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
spot
prices
rose
to
a
high
above
in
january
but
have
since
slid
nearly
percent
together
with
a
broader
decline
in
the
stock
markets
due
to
fears
about
global
inflation
as
well
as
renewed
concerns
about
rising
oil
production
the
concern
about
prices
could
also
cast
opec
kingpin
saudi
arabia
s
policies
in
a
new
light
the
kingdom
has
orchestrated
a
global
oil
output
cut
deal
to
support
prices
a
move
which
reuters
has
previously
reported
was
partly
driven
by
a
desire
to
maximise
aramco
s
valuation
for
the
ipo
falih
has
repeatedly
said
he
sees
opec
cuts
lasting
until
the
end
of
and
even
then
that
the
exit
would
be
very
gradual
comments
that
helped
support
not
only
but
also
prices
the
saudi
government
says
aramco
is
worth
trillion
and
aims
to
list
on
one
or
more
foreign
stock
exchanges
in
addition
to
riyadh
saudi
sources
have
said
the
listing
on
a
local
bourse
could
happen
before
the
international
listing
it
is
not
clear
if
the
forward
oil
price
indicator
will
be
a
key
consideration
for
the
timing
of
a
local
listing
the
ipo
is
a
central
part
of
the
crown
prince
s
reform
drive
aimed
at
restructuring
the
kingdom
s
economy
and
reducing
its
dependence
on
oil
revenue
the
prince
is
also
one
of
the
architects
of
the
output
production
pact
between
opec
and
russia
while
saudi
officials
think
per
barrel
is
a
reasonable
price
for
oil
in
the
long
term
the
rally
at
the
start
of
has
provided
an
incentive
to
bump
up
the
aramco
valuation
according
to
a
third
source
close
to
the
ipo
is
a
sweet
spot
but
now
they
are
making
hay
while
the
sun
shines
the
source
said
he
added
however
that
inside
aramco
concerns
were
also
rising
that
a
prolonged
rally
could
again
spur
shale
production
too
much
and
lead
to
a
loss
of
saudi
market
share
a
rally
to
the
carries
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction
