asian
shares
ticked
up
on
monday
joining
a
global
recovery
for
equity
markets
as
sentiment
improved
gradually
from
a
recent
shakeout
that
stemmed
from
fears
of
creeping
inflation
and
higher
borrowing
costs
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
having
recovered
more
than
percent
of
their
losses
from
late
last
month
to
last

trading

be
slower

on

the
s
p
rose
marginally
on
friday
to
mark
its
biggest
weekly
increase
in
five
years
although
earlier
gains
evaporated
after
a
indictment
filed
by
special

charged
russians
and
three
russian
companies
for
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
msci
s
index
of
stock
markets
across
the
globe
gained
percent
last
week
the
best
weekly
performance
since
december
the
rebound
came
after
a
rout
that
wiped
off
more
than
percent
of
value
at
one
point
triggered
by
worries
a
rise
in
inflation
may
boost
dollar
funding
costs
the
stocks
valuation
has
become
cheaper
to
levels
that
are
on
par
with
the
assumption
that
bond
yields
will
shoot
up
to
percent
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
the
treasuries
yield
rose
to
high
of
percent
compared
to
percent
at
the
end
of
last
year
a
fall
in
the
vix
index
a
gauge
of
expected
volatilities
in
stocks
also
helped
underpin
improving
sentiment
the
recent
is
believed
to
have
been
amplified
by
a
jump
in
the
vix
as
many
players
are
thought
to
have
adjusted
their
portfolio
in
line
with
the
change
in
volatilities
the
latest
rout
was
driven
more
by
forced
selling
of
such
players
as
risk
parity
strategies
and
commodity
trading
advisors
ctas
their
selling
appears
to
be
over

kuramochi
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
stabilised
off
its
lows
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
euro
stood
at
backing
down
from
friday
s
high
of
the
dollar
traded
at
yen
bouncing
back
from
its
low
of
set
on
feb
the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
by
a
barrage
of
factors
including
worries
about
widening
trade
and
budget
deficits
and
speculation
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
there
is
also
talk
that
foreign
central
banks
may
be
reallocating
their
reserves
out
of
