the

reuters
france
asked
the
world
court
on
monday
to
throw
out
a
case
launched
by
equatorial
guinea
saying
the
african
country
was
wrongly
using
the
court
to
shield
the
son
of
its
ruler
from
prosecution
in
france
following
a
corruption
investigation
the
case
before
the
united
nation
s
highest
court
formally
known
as
the
international
court
of
justice
is
seen
as
an
important
test
of
the
limits
of
diplomatic
immunity
equatorial
guinea
launched
the
case
in
after
france
raided
the
paris
residence
of
teodorin
obiang
as
part
of
a
corruption
investigation
that
eventually
resulted
in
his
conviction
for
embezzlement
in
october
equatorial
guinea
argued
that
obiang
was
the
country
s
second
when
the
raid
took
place
and
that
his
paris
residence
therefore
was
part
of
its
diplomatic
mission
the
french
criminal
proceedings
against
the
second
constitute
a
violation
of
the
immunity
to
which
he
is
entitled
under
international
law
it
said
in
its
complaint
invoking
the
vienna
convention
on
diplomatic
relations
but
at
the
start
of
jurisdictional
hearings
on
monday
france
argued
that
guinea
only
sought
to
add
the
residence
to
its
diplomatic
residence
after
the
raid
had
taken
place
france
s
representative
alain
pellet
told
the
court
to
disregard
the
wholly
unbelievable
circumstances
under
which
the
apartment
on
avenue
foch
suddenly
became
a
part
of
the
how
ever
many
positions
he
holds
obiang
is
no
diplomat
pellet
said
equatorial
guinea
is
due
to
respond
on
tuesday
a
french
court
found
obiang
guilty
of
embezzlement
in
october
during
a
trial
in
absentia
and
ordered
the
confiscation
of
more
than
million
euros
worth
of
his
assets
the
residence
at
the
centre
of
the
guinean
dispute
is
a
luxury
residence
on
avenue
foch
in
paris
a
grand
sweeping
road
near
the
arc
de
triomphe
often
favoured
by
wealthy
african
expatriates
and
politicians
the
property
bought
for
million
euros
in
had
rooms
a
gym
studio
and
disco
with
cinema
screen
pellet
said
french
investigators
found
luxury
cars
on
the
premises
when
they
searched
it
the
first
time
obiang
is
the
son
of
president
teodoro
obiang
nguema
mbasogo
who
has
ruled
the
former
spanish
colony
for
more
than
three
decades
rights
groups
have
labelled
his
administration
as
one
of
the
world
s
most
corrupt
if
judges
decide
the
international
court
has
jurisdiction
then
they
would
then
move
to
hear
equatorial
guinea
s
claim
on
its
merits
a
process
likely
to
take
more
than
a
year
