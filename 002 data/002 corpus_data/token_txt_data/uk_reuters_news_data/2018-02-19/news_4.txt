venezuela
s
political
situation
could
well
be
on
the
agenda
during
a
trip
by
mexico
s
foreign
minister
to
jamaica
next
month
during
which
mexican
oil
sales
are
likely
to
be
discussed
jamaica
s
foreign
minister
told
reuters
on
monday
last
week
reuters
reported
that
mexican
foreign
minister
luis
videgaray
will
travel
to
jamaica
and
other
caribbean
nations
in
march
as
part
of
efforts
to
erode
venezuela
s
influence
in
the
caribbean
mexico
has
been
looking
at
the
possibility
of
replacing
venezuela
s
petrocaribe
program
that
provided
cheap
loans
for
oil
to
caribbean
nations
and
has
helped
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
retain
diplomatic
support
in
the
region
jamaica
buys
mexican
crude
on
the
spot
market
so
in
terms
of
jamaica
having
an
energy
relationship
with
mexico
that
exists
of
course
and
probably
there
will
be
discussions
around
that
foreign
minister
kamina
johnson
smith
said
in
a
phone
interview
on
monday
when
asked
about
mexico
s
commitment
to
help
improve
energy
security
in
the
caribbean
johnson
smith
said
she
had
invited
videgaray
to
jamaica
last
october
and
they
decided
his
visit
should
coincide
with
a
regional
conference
of
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
due
to
be
held
in
jamaica
on
march
videgaray
s
visit
represents
the
latest
development
in
pressure
on
maduro
who
retains
loyalty
from
some
caribbean
nations
that
have
long
benefited
from
caracas
oil
largesse
and
have
been
unwilling
to
shun
the
country
in
regional
diplomatic
efforts
it
could
be
johnson
smith
said
when
asked
if
venezuela
would
be
on
the
agenda
with
videgaray
hemispherical
matters
will
of
course
be
on
the
but
the
focus
is
very
much
on
our
bilateral
cooperation
deepening
trade
and
investment
she
added
videgaray
s
trip
follows
a
visit
to
latin
america
and
the
caribbean
earlier
this
month
by
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
who
announced
plans
to
study
how
possible
oil
sanctions
against
venezuela
could
be
mitigated
in
the
caribbean
mexico
s
foreign
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
a
mexican
official
told
reuters
last
week
that
videgaray
has
sought
to
engage
more
with
the
caribbean
in
the
wake
of
a
june
meeting
in
which
foreign
ministers
from
the
organization
of
american
states
oas
failed
to
reach
agreement
on
a
resolution
criticizing
