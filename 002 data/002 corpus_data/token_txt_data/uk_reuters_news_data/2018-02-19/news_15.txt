antonio
guterres
said
on
monday
he
was
worried
about
the
possibility
of
a
direct
confrontation
between
israel
and
lebanon
s
hezbollah
movement
guterres
said
the
latest
signals
from
israel
and
the
hezbollah
showed
the
will
to
not
let
this
happen
but
sometimes
a
spark
is
enough
to
unleash
this
kind
of
a
conflict
hezbollah
said
last
week
it
could
act
against
israeli
oil
facilities
if
necessary
in
an
offshore
energy
dispute
diplomats
have
been
mediating
between
the
two
countries
after
a
rise
in
tensions
also
involving
a
dispute
over
a
border
wall
and
hezbollah
s
growing
arsenal
i
am
deeply
worried
about
escalations
in
the
whole
region
guterres
told
reporters
in
his
native
lisbon
also
referring
to
israel
s
concerns
about
various
militia
groups
in
syria
approaching
its
borders
the
worst
nightmare
would
be
if
there
is
a
direct
confrontation
between
israel
and
hezbollah
the
level
of
destruction
in
lebanon
would
be
absolutely
devastating
so
there
are
major
points
of
concern
around
this
the
powerful
shi
ite
movement
is
part
of
lebanon
s
coalition
government
israel
sees
hezbollah
as
the
biggest
security
threat
on
its
borders
hezbollah
was
formed
in
the
as
a
resistance
movement
against
israel
s
occupation
of
southern
lebanon
the
two
remain
bitter
enemies
but
there
has
been
no
major
conflict
between
them
since
a
war
