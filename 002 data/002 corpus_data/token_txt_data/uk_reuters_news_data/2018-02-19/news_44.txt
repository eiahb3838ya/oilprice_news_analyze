german carmakers in a spin ahead of diesel ban ruling
reuters
a
court
will
decide
on
thursday
whether
german
cities
can
ban
heavily
polluting
cars
potentially
wiping
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
off
the
value
of
diesel
cars
on
the
country
s
roads
environmental
group
duh
has
sued
stuttgart
in
germany
s
carmaking
heartland
and
duesseldorf
over
levels
of
particulate
matter
exceeding
european
union
limits
after
volkswagen
s
admission
to
cheating
diesel
exhaust
tests
the
scandal
led
politicians
across
the
world
to
scrutinise
diesel
emissions
which
contain
the
matter
and
nitrogen
oxide
nox
and
are
known
to
cause
respiratory
disease
there
are
around
million
diesel
vehicles
on
german
streets
and
environmental
groups
say
levels
of
particulates
exceed
the
eu
threshold
in
at
least
german
towns
and
cities
local
courts
ordered
them
to
bar
diesel
cars
which
did
not
conform
to
the
latest
standards
on
days
when
pollution
is
heavy
startling
german
carmakers
because
an
outright
ban
could
trigger
a
fall
in
vehicle
resale
prices
and
a
rise
in
the
cost
of
leasing
contracts
which
are
priced
on
assumed
residual
values
the
german
states
concerned
where
the
carmakers
and
their
suppliers
have
a
strong
influence
appealed
against
the
decisions
leaving
germany
s
federal
administrative
court
the
court
of
last
resort
for
such
matters
to
rule
on
whether
such
bans
can
legally
be
imposed
at
local
level
the
key
question
is
whether
bans
can
already
be
considered
to
be
legal
instruments
said
remo
klinger
a
lawyer
for
duh
it
s
a
completely
open
question
of
paris
madrid
mexico
city
and
athens
have
said
they
plan
to
ban
diesel
vehicles
from
city
centres
by
while
the
mayor
of
copenhagen
wants
to
ban
new
diesel
cars
from
entering
the
city
as
soon
as
next
year
france
and
britain
will
ban
new
petrol
and
diesel
cars
by
in
a
shift
to
electric
vehicles
evercore
isi
forecasts
a
percent
fall
in
diesel
residual
values
could
result
in
a
drop
of
billion
euros
billion
in
operating
profit
across
eight
european
and
carmakers
analysts
at
bernstein
research
have
said
that
diesel
bans
in
europe
would
hit
french
carmaker
peugeot
hardest
followed
by
renault
among
german
carmakers
daimler
s
global
fleet
exposure
to
diesel
is
around
percent
bmw
s
percent
and
vw
s
percent
bernstein
said
in
a
report
from
carmakers
have
sought
to
avert
total
bans
by
updating
engine
management
systems
to
improve
filters
a
step
only
possible
on
vehicles
equipped
with
systems
environmental
groups
have
called
software
updates
insufficient
and
have
lobbied
for
cars
with
and
emissions
standards
to
receive
hardware
updates
of
their
exhaust
treatment
systems
costing
at
least
euros
per
vehicle
europe
s
love
affair
with
diesel
is
already
fading
with
its
market
share
in
the
european
union
falling
from
percent
at
the
end
of
