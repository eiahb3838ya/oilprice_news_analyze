the

the

came
after
a

off
more
than

at
one
point
triggered
by
worries
a

in

the
took
place
even
as

shares
were
traded
at
times
their
expected
earnings
the
highest
levels
since
according
to
thomson

datastream
they
are
currently
at
times
the
stocks
valuation
has
become
cheaper
to
levels
that
are
on
par
with
the
assumption
that
bond
yields
will
shoot
up
to
percent
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
the
treasuries
yield
rose
to
a
high
of
percent
last
week
compared
to
percent
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
yield
hit
its
highest
level
since
last
week
as
investors
bet
the
federal
reserve
will
raise
interest
rates
at
its
next
policy
meeting
in
march
the
cash
bond
market
is
shut
on
monday
for
a
holiday
what
s
been
told
less
about
rising
yields
is
the
fact
that
this
could
reflect
the
impact
of
the
fed
s
balance
sheet
reduction
and
the
likely
increase
in
debt
issues
following
trump
s
tax
cuts
and
infrastructure
spending
said
hiroaki
hayashi
director
of
fukokushinrai
life
insurance
the
treasuries
could
test
the
percent
level
he
added
in
october
the
fed
started
trimming
reinvestments
in
treasuries
and
agency
bonds
as
the
fed
plans
to
gradually
reduce
reinvestments
the
impact
is
expected
to
get
bigger
this
year
while
the
fed
scales
back
its
bond
purchases
the
government
is
expected
to
increase
its
debt
issuance
after
congress
reached
a
deal
earlier
this
month
to
raise
spending
by
almost
billion
over
the
next
two
years
the
minutes
of
the
fed
s
last
policy
meeting
held
amid
the
equities
tumble
on
are
due
on
wednesday
besides
the
outlook
on
rates
markets
will
be
keen
to
see
what
if
anything
the
fed
makes
of
the
gyrations
in
markets
a
fall
in
the
vix
index
a
gauge
of
expected
volatilities
in
stocks
also
helped
underpin
improving
sentiment
the
recent
is
believed
to
have
been
amplified
by
a
jump
in
the
vix
as
many
players
are
thought
to
have
adjusted
their
portfolio
in
line
with
the
change
in
volatilities
the
latest
rout
was
driven
more
by
forced
selling
of
such
players
as
risk
parity
strategies
and
commodity
trading
advisors
ctas
their
selling
appears
to
be
over

kuramochi
in
the

the

stabilised
off
its

against
a

down
from

at

bouncing
back
from
its
low
of

on

the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
by
a
barrage
of
factors
including
worries
about
widening
trade
and
budget
deficits
and
speculation
washington
might
pursue
a

strategy
there
is
