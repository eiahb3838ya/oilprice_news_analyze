forced
to
abandon
ship
after
mistiming
their
investments
five
years
ago
hedge
funds
are
venturing
back
in
a
bid
to
profit
from
growing
global
trade
flows
around
percent
of
traded
goods
by
volume
are
transported
by
sea
and
global
shipping
sectors
including
dry
bulk
are
on
course
for
a
recovery
this
year
after
a
long
crisis

said
in
a
report
last
week
the
imf
has
forecast
gdp
growth
at
percent
for
and
versus
percent
last
year
which
analysts
say
is
boosting
sentiment
for
shipping
as
a
result
many
hedge
funds
are
loading
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
into
the
sector
putting
behind
them
losses
suffered
in
when
based
on
forecasts
of
improved
world
economic
growth
they
piled
in
to
shipping
debt
and
equity
that
strategy
hit
the
rocks
for
many
investors
when
the
shipping
companies
they
had
put
their
faith
in
new
vessels
and
saw
their
shares
fall
by
as
much
as
percent
they
all
came
in
too
early
tor
svelland
chief
investment
officer
at
hedge
fund
svelland
capital
said
adding
that
the
market
is
different
this
time
around
as
capacity
is
shrinking
it
looks
like
the
new
building
market
will
not
be
able
to
kill
the
positive
demand
story
this
is
a
dream
this
time
round
it
is
not
only
shipping
stocks
but
also
freight
forward
agreements
ffa
which
allow
investors
to
take
positions
on
freight
rates
at
a
point
in
the
future
that
are
more
widely
used
to
get
into
what
is
still
a
niche
sector

fund
the
tide
is
turning
and
with
less
chance
of
a
shipping
glut
there
are
now
some
interesting
opportunities
for
investors
another
new
feature
are
exchange
traded
funds
which
filings
show
are
being
set
up
to
focus
on
shipping
investments
these
would
allow
hedge
funds
and
retail
investors
to
access
ffas
polemis
said
a
lot
of
people
have
been
talking
about
shipping
recently
last
year
a
few
funds
were
setting
up
bespoke
products
said
a
hedge
fund
investor
one
example
is
tufton
ocean
a
hedge
fund
and
private
equity
firm
which
started
a
strategy
run
solely
for
a
investor
in
january
the
wave
of
new
money
is
clear
from
data
last
week
which
showed
that
hedge
funds
bet
at
least
million
on
shipping
stocks
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
hedge
fund
participation
in
of
the
top
shipping
stocks
reached
percent
in
the
fourth
quarter
up
from
percent
in
the
previous
three
months
data
from
securities
and
exchange
commission
filings
compiled
by
symmetric
showed
and
activists
who
buy
up
shares
in
undervalued
companies
and
agitate
for
change
to
drive
up
the
share
price
have
also
been
increasingly
moving
into
shipping
stocks
activist
hedge
funds
made
public
demands
of
five
shipping
companies
in
the
months
to
the
highest
number
of
campaigns
in
more
than
five
years
with
three
in
the
previous
year
and
two
between
and
according
to
research
group
activist
insight
duncan
dunn
senior
director
with
leading
ffa
broker
ssy
futures
ltd
said
a
number
of
investment
funds
started
betting
on
dry
bulk
ffas
when
the
sector
downturn
started
to
bite
at
the
end
of
he
said
there
had
been
an
increase
in
the
estimated
underlying
transaction
value
of
dry
bulk
ffas
to
billion
in
from
around
billion
in
and
hopes
that
the
underlying
value
could
reach
billion
if
both
volume
and
values
grow
by
percent
this
year
last
year
s
improvement
in
time
charter
rates
was
such
that
not
only
will
there
be
more
hedging
opportunity
for
dry
ffa
traders
but
also
a
compelling
case
for
renewed
elsewhere
the
baltic
exchange
founded
in
is
creating
the
possibility
of
its
globally
tracked
main
sea
freight
index
which
gauges
the
cost
of
shipping
dry
bulk
commodities
including
iron
ore
grain
and
coal
becoming
a
tradeable
instrument
the
baltic
is
also
looking
into
launching
a
freight
index
for
lng
liquefied
natural
gas
creating
further
scope
for
trading
plays
such
developments
are
likely
to
be
a
boost
for
those
who
caution
against
stocks
as
a
way
of
gaining
shipping
exposure
nicholas
tsevdos
managing
director
of
ocean
way
navigation
a
shipping
investor
and
asset
manager
said
shipping
stocks
are
a
particularly
poor
way
in
this
is
due
to
the
exorbitant
combined
g
a
general
and
administrative
expenses
and
management
fees
which
on
average
are
around
three
times
the
market
standard
tsevdos
said
adding
that
the
correlation
between
underlying
asset
values
and
the
share
price
is
often
not
as
expected
you
can
watch
a
company
achieve
a
phenomenal
price
for
a
vessel
or
fleet
sale
and
watch
the
stock
tank
as
the
market
views
it
as
a
retraction
tsevdos
said
others
such
as
jens
rohweder
managing
partner
with
investment
and
asset
manager
notos
group
say
some
markets
such
as
dry
bulk
which
accounts
for
an
estimated
percent
of
the
world
s
cargo
fleet
may
already
be
past
their
peak
leading
him
to
prefer
investments
such
as
lpg
liquefied
petroleum
gas
stocks
this
will
be
the
third
time
round
for
them
hedge
funds
let
s
hope
they
get
the
timing
right
