the

with

that
outstanding
disputes
would
have

s
comments
refer
to
egypt
s
challenge
to
a
ruling
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
ordering
egypt
to
pay
billion
in
compensation
after
a
deal
to
export
gas
to
israel
via
pipeline
collapsed
in
due
to
months
of
attacks
by
insurgents
in
egypt
s
sinai
peninsula
we
don
t
mind
importing
gas
from
israel
but
we
have
terms
in
order
to
allow
something
like
this
to
happen
most
importantly
the
settlement
of
ongoing
arbitration
molla
said
an
egyptian
government
official
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
the
deal
did
not
mean
egypt
itself
would
import
any
gas
from
abroad
international
private
companies
will
import
gas
from
abroad
in
the
framework
of
their
own
needs
and
will
liquefy
and
export
them
again
the
official
said
without
elaborating
shares
in
delek
drilling
were
up
percent
on
the

the

and
confidence
in

expected
cash
flow
profile
for

beyond
noble
energy
which
plans
to
sell
its
offshore
exploration
business
said
the
prices
under
the
agreements
were
linked
to
the
brent
oil
benchmark
and
promised
more
details
when
it
releases
results
on
tuesday
barclays
analyst
tavy
rosner
said
weakness
seen
in
israeli
gas
shares
over
the
past
several
months
was
due
to
investors
doubts
that
gas
exports
would
ever
take
place
we
believe
today
s
announcement
will
pave
the
way
to
a
of
the
shares

built
by

emg
to
send

in
the
other

in
the
