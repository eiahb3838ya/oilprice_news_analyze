for
rhoda
tanko
preparing
dishes
of
okra
or
egusi
soup
in
her
small
shack
was
a
daily
ordeal
spent
battling
the
dizzying
toxic
black
fumes
spewed
out
by
her
charcoal
stove
every
time
i
had
to
cook
for
my
family
i
knew
i
had
to
deal
with
smoke
that
made
my
head
feel
heavy
and
my
eyes
swim
tanko
a
mother
of
four
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
the
central
nigerian
town
of
jengre
her
home
s
energy
needs
were
costly
too
nigeria
s
unreliable
power
supply
meant
she
had
little
choice
but
to
spend
a
large
part
of
the
family
s
income
on
firewood
charcoal
and
kerosene
but
that
changed
earlier
this
year
when
with
help
from
her
local
cooperative
tanko
bought
a
new
stove
the
stove
which
cost
naira
was
provided
by
solar
sister
a
that
operates
in
nigeria
as
well
as
in
kenya
tanzania
and
uganda
the
charity
helps
women
entrepreneurs
sell
consumer
products
such
as
solar
lamps
and
a
stove
that
minimises
emissions
by
trapping
most
of
the
smoke
fumes
within
its
aluminium
combustion
chamber
a
more
efficient
stove
means
fewer
trees
are
felled
for
firewood
said
hanatu
onogu
solar
sister
s
business
development
manager
in
northern
nigeria
because
people
use
less
charcoal
and
firewood
for
more
cooking
it
saves
resources
in
the
long
run
it
reduces
the
rate
of
deforestation
and
conserves
energy
onogu
said
over
the
past
two
years
about
of
these
stoves
have
been
sold
in
nigeria
alone
according
to
solar
sister
tanko
who
is
one
of
several
hundred
women
in
her
area
testing
out
the
stove
said
it
had
made
a
big
difference
it
cooks
food
faster
and
it
doesn
t
consume
much
charcoal
before
a
bag
of
charcoal
would
not
last
one
month
but
now
it
s
been
four
months
and
this
bag
is
not
finished
yet
she
said
pointing
at
a
sack
worldwide
more
than
three
billion
people
use
traditional
solid
fuels
like
charcoal
firewood
and
dung
to
cook
according
to
the
world
health
organization
who
and
each
year
nearly
four
million
people
most
of
them
women
and
girls
die
from
the
effects
of
these
dirty
cooking
fuels
the
who
says
in
part
due
to
inefficient
stoves
and
poorly
ventilated
homes
a
lack
of
access
to
cleaner
energy
supplies
is
a
problem
in
nigeria
too
despite
the
fact
that
the
country
of
million
people
is
africa
s
biggest
oil
producer
fuel
shortages
are
common
with
its
refining
system
operating
well
below
capacity
due
to
mismanagement
and
lack
of
investment
forcing
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
to
import
most
of
its
gasoline
the
country
has
set
a
target
of
expanding
electricity
access
to
percent
of
the
population
by
and
percent
by
meantime
the
supply
remains
unreliable
january
saw
six
power
outages
in
eight
days
as
the
national
grid
repeatedly
collapsed
plunging
most
of
the
country
into
darkness
that
burden
falls
harder
on
nigerians
in
rural
areas
where
just
one
in
four
people
are
connected
to
the
national
grid
according
to
campaign
group
power
for
all
which
promotes
decentralized
renewable
energy
and
which
funds
solar
sister
moving
from
fossil
fuels
to
cleaner
energy
for
cooking
and
solar
energy
for
lighting
has
gained
momentum
in
parts
of
northern
nigeria
through
groups
like
solar
sister
the
assists
families
like
tanko
s
to
switch
by
offering
the
option
to
pay
in
instalments
it
also
provides
customer
support
and
raises
awareness
about
the
benefits
of
clean
energy
a
lack
of
access
to
a
reliable
supply
of
electricity
means
many
families
in
nigeria
and
across
africa
use
kerosene
for
lighting
a
fuel
that
experts
say
is
polluting
dirty
and
bad
for
human
health
it
is
also
relatively
expensive
switching
to
solar
could
cut
the
amount
that
families
in
africa
spend
on
lighting
to
just
percent
of
their
household
income
down
from
percent
according
to
a
report
by
the
overseas
development
institute
a
based
in
the
united
kingdom
using
a
lamp
means
nafisa
abubakar
can
avoid
the
dangers
of
kerosene
and
the
inconvenience
of
blackouts
sitting
in
her
small
shack
she
flicked
a
switch
and
a
solar
lamp
lit
up
her
home
abubakar
could
not
have
done
that
with
confidence
six
years
ago
even
though
her
home
was
connected
to
the
national
utility
known
then
as
nepa
our
light
was
very
inconsistent
sometimes
for
two
months
straight
the
light
would
not
even
turn
on
abubakar
said
in
hausa
via
a
translator
we
were
using
nepa
light
then
one
day
the
transformer
blew
up
and
it
was
not
repaired
until
a
year
later
so
we
have
been
using
the
solar
sister
lamp
for
five
years
now
she
said
as
day
turned
to
night
abubakar
and
her
husband
watched
television
while
their
two
sons
finished
their
homework
under
the
radiant
light
of
the
solar
lamp
we
are
happy
for
this
light
that
we
have
she
said
solar
sister
says
nearly
solar
products
have
been
sold
in
nigeria
since
be
they
units
household
lights
or
lamps
and
for
abubakar
the
lamp
has
become
more
than
a
household
convenience
these
days
she
sells
solar
lights
for
a
living
power
for
all
the
campaign
group
said
the
products
allowed
people
to
live
safer
healthier
lives
and
to
save
money
we
are
even
happier
for
the
women
who
use
them
and
have
built
sustainable
selling
them
as
it
has
brightened
the
chances
of
ending
energy
poverty
