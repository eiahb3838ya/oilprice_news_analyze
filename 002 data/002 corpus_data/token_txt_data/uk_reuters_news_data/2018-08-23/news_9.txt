explainer-in the race to bag iran's european oil market share, quality is king
london
reuters
two
of
iran
s
biggest
opec
rivals
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
are
bagging
its
european
oil
market
share
by
cranking
up
production
of
their
lookalike
crude
grades
before
the
restart
of
sanctions
designed
to
halt
exports
from
the
islamic
republic
iran
faces
curbs
on
its
energy
sector
from
early
november
after
president
donald
trump
walked
away
in
may
from
a
deal
aimed
at
restraining
tehran
s
nuclear
program
iran
s
crude
is
mainly
bought
by
refiners
in
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
although
it
has
customers
in
turkey
and
the
european
union
buyers
seeking
an
alternative
can
not
simply
opt
for
any
crude
on
the
market
as
oil
sanctions
against
iran
take
effect
perhaps
in
combination
with
production
problems
elsewhere
maintaining
global
supply
might
be
very
challenging
and
would
come
at
the
expense
of
maintaining
an
adequate
spare
capacity
cushion
the
international
energy
agency
warned
recently
thus
the
market
outlook
could
be
far
less
calm
at
that
point
than
it
is
today
the
iea
said
a
senior
iranian
diplomat
told
producer
group
opec
on
that
no
member
country
should
be
allowed
to
take
over
another
s
share
of
oil
exports
in
light
of
saudi
arabia
s
offer
to
produce
more
to
cover
any
iranian
shortfalls
but
a
look
at
trade
flows
shows
that
in
europe
at
least
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
have
already
succeeded
in
doing
so
since
the
start
of
the
year
iranian
flows
to
europe
have
fallen
percent
to
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
while
saudi
shipments
have
doubled
and
those
from
iraq
have
risen
percent

one
refiner
said
when
asked
what
crude
grades
were
likely
alternatives
the
latter
two
hailing
from
iraq
and
russia
respectively
iraq
and
saudi
arabia
have
raised
their
oil
output
by
a
combined
bpd
since
the
start
of
the
year
and
cut

prices
for
their

customers

the
world
s
oil
exporter
and
with
as
much
as

of
supply
estimated
to
be
under
threat
its
customers
may
be
forced
to
pay
handsomely
for
possible

crude
oil
is
categorized
mainly
according
to
sulfur
content
and
its
density
relative
to
water
or
american
petroleum
institute
gravity
the
denser
crude
is
the
lower
its
gravity
crudes
that
have
an
api
gravity
above
degrees
are
categorized
as
light
while
those
with
api
gravity
between
and
degrees
are
medium
and
below
degrees
heavy
the
lighter
the
crude
the
easier
and
cheaper
it
is
to
extract
and
transport
and
the
simpler
it
is
to
refine
heavier
crudes
which
contain
more
impurities
such
as
sulfur
or
metals
require
additional
processing
to
recover
products
sulfur
content
is
a
second
key
category
a
sweet
crude
is
one
with
a
sulfur
content
of
less
than
percent
while
the
sulfur
content
of
a
sour
crude
is
above
this
threshold
sulfur
is
corrosive
and
refineries
that
run
more
sour
grades
require
more
intense
maintenance

average
api

s
crudes
