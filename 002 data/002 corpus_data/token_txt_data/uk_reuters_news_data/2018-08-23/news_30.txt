orway
s
equinor
sees
scope
to
further
reduce
development
costs
at
the
johan
sverdrup
oilfield
in
the
north
sea
as
it
looks
to
maximise
the
potential
of
what
could
be
the
last
giant
field
to
be
found
off
the
nordic
country
the
field
one
of
the
five
largest
oil
finds
offshore
norway
is
estimated
to
contain
up
to
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalents
mainly
crude
oil
enough
to
meet
britain
s
oil
demand
for
five
years
sverdrup
is
on
track
to
begin
production
in
late
and
could
produce
up
to
a
quarter
of
norway
s
overall
petroleum
output
at
its
peak
equinor
formerly
statoil
has
already
cut
development
costs
by
billion
crowns
billion
to
billion
crowns
thanks
to
more
efficient
drilling
and
smooth
execution
that
meant
cash
put
aside
for
contingencies
has
not
been
used
i
think
there
are
still
some
further
gains
on
the
cost
side
margareth
oevrum
equinor
s
executive
president
for
technology
project
and
drilling
told
reuters
oevrum
was
speaking
at
the
sverdrup
drilling
platform
one
of
two
already
in
place
in
the
north
sea
some
km
miles
west
of
the
norwegian
coast

part
of
the
staff
currently
offshore
to
complete
construction
the
remaining
two
platforms
are
expected
to
be
delivered
to
the
field
in
spring
during
the
first
stage
of
development
sverdrup
is
expected
to
produce
up
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalents
per
day
boepd
while
the
second
phase
scheduled
to
start
in
is
expected
to
boost
output
to
boepd
equinor
is
expected
to
submit
a
plan
for
the
field
s
second
phase
estimated
to
cost
a
preliminary
billion
crowns
later
this
month
going
forward
this
will
be
the
biggest
oilfield
producing
on
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
said
oevrum
sverdrup
s
significance
in
terms
of
oil
output
could
be
even
higher
oil
pricing
agency
s
p
global
platts
has
said
output
from
the
field
would
be
suitable
for
its
north
sea
basket
making
it
potentially
a
sixth
crude
underpinning
the
brent
benchmark
used
to
price
most
global
oil
the
field
also
helped
sustain
demand
for
industry
suppliers
during
the
oil
downturn

equinor
and
partners

i
lost
my
job
when
the
oil
crisis
came
and
i
got
it
back
when
this
project
started
so
i
am
very
happy

sverdrup
the
field
is
named
after
a
century
norwegian
prime
minister
but
there
may
not
be
another
sverdrup
to
help
the
norwegian
oil
industry
in
the
years
ahead
i
can
t
see
anything
larger
for
the
future
we
have
johan
castberg
but
it
s
not
as
big
as
johan
sverdrup
oevrum
said
referring
to
equinor
s
oilfield
development
in
the
arctic
we
are
still
positive
about
exploration
and
will
explore
more
but
at
the
moment
we
don
t
have
oevrum
herself
will
soon
leave
norway
for
brazil
to
supervise
the
development
of
the
carcara
discovery
which
is
of
a
similar
size
to
sverdrup
while
norway
still
accounts
for
about
of
equinor
s
total
petroleum
output
its
international
operations
have
been
hitting
new
quarterly
records
the
norwegian
continental
shelf
has
been
the
backbone
of
equinor
for
many
years
and
it
will
continue
for
some
time
but
it
will
be
gradually
replaced
by
the
international
production
