london
reuters
the
market
for
freight
fuels
is
moving
close
to
balance
after
tightening
significantly
in
and
the
first
quarter
of
contributing
to
the
recent
stabilisation
in
crude
oil
prices
oecd
stocks
of
middle
distillate
fuels
including
road
diesel
marine
gasoil
and
jet
fuel
totalled
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
june
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
oil
market
report
august
stocks
have
fallen
compared
with
the
slump
years
of
when
they
ranged
from
million
to
million
barrels
but
are
higher
than
in
the
years
of
million
barrels
fuel
availability
appears
to
have
improved
since
the
middle
of
the
second
quarter
with
distillate
stocks
rising
to
almost
million
barrels
last
week
up
from
just
million
in
stocks
are
now
million
barrels
below
the
seasonal
average
compared
with
a
deficit
of
million
in
may
and
the
gap
is
closing
confirming
that
stocks
are
still
tight
but
only
marginally
so
the
calendar
spread
for
european
gasoil
futures
is
close
to
level
chartbook
the
spread
has
been
trading
in
an
average
backwardation
of
roughly
per
tonne
just
cents
per
barrel
over
the
last
days
the
spread
is
currently
in
the
percentile
for
the
distribution
since
implying
traders
see
gasoil
availability
close
to
average
levels
slower
growth
in
global
trade
since
the
start
of
the
year
and
especially
since
the
second
quarter
is
likely
to
be
contributing
to
improved
availability
of
distillates
by
moderating
the
increase
in
fuel
consumption
on
the
production
side
refining
margins
for
making
gasoil
remain
healthy
averaging
just
over
per
barrel
in
the
last
month
putting
them
in
the
percentile
since
margins
have
widened
since
but
mostly
because
crude
prices
have
weakened
rather
than
gasoil
prices
have
risen
reflecting
weakness
in
the
crude
market
rather
than
strength
in
fuels
soft
crude
prices
coupled
with
firm
gasoil
margins
are
giving
refineries
a
strong
incentive
to
maximise
production
of
distillates
refiners
produced
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
of
distillate
fuel
last
week
a
seasonal
record
and
more
than
bpd
above
the
average
if
refinery
runs
remain
strong
throughout
the
remainder
of
august
and
september
which
seems
likely
in
the
absence
of
a
hurricane
strike
on
the
coast
distillate
availability
should
improve
significantly
in
a
sign
that
distillates
are
becoming
more
plentiful
hedge
fund
managers
have
cut
their
net
bullish
position
in
european
gasoil
by
million
barrels
since
late
may
and
in
heating
oil
by
million
barrels
the
distillate
market
seems
to
have
its
balance
and
availability
should
remain
high
unless
global
trade
accelerates
again
