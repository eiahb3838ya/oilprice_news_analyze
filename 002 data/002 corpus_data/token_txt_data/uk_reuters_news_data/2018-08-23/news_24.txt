canada
ought
to
require
stronger
tank
cars
for
transporting
flammable
liquids
sooner
than
the
current
deadline
in
transportation
safety
board
chair
kathy
fox
said
on
thursday
noting
that
shipments
are
expected
to
rise
in
the
country
we
understand
that
it
can
t
happen
all
at
once
but
we
d
like
to
see
it
sooner
fox
said
in
an
interview
without
giving
a
specific
alternative
date
we
do
have
an
ongoing
concern
that
flammable
liquids
be
transported
in
the
most
robust
tank
canada
and
the
united
states
have
introduced
new
requirements
to
more
safely
transport
flammable
liquids
after
a
runaway
train
explosion
carrying
crude
killed
in
the
canadian
province
of
quebec
older
cars
used
during
the
tragedy
in
lac
megantic
quebec
have
already
been
replaced
in
canada
by
cars
for
moving
crude
oil
but
even
these
must
be
completely
phased
out
by
may
for
the
transport
of
flammable
liquids
according
to
the
tsb
they
will
need
to
be
replaced
by
cars
or
retrofits
that
meet
the
same
standard
which
has
thicker
steel
the
department
of
transportation
expects
flammable
liquids
to
be
carried
in
comparable
rail
tank
cars
or
retrofits
by
may
canada
has
not
experienced
a
major
derailment
of
a
crude
train
since
fox
said
but
in
the
united
states
a
bnsf
railway
co
freight
train
carrying
crude
oil
derailed
in
northwest
iowa
in
june
sending
some
gallons
of
oil
into
a
state
waterway
transports
which
have
declined
in
canada
in
recent
years
on
declining
oil
prices
are
showing
signs
of
a
resurgence
canada
exported
a
record
barrels
per
day
of
crude
by
rail
in
june
the
national
energy
board
said
on
wednesday
as
oil
shippers
coped
with
congested
pipelines
that
volume
jumped
percent
from
a
year
earlier
but
expanding
oil
producers
have
said
they
need
to
move
much
more
to
reduce
a
steep
discount
on
their
heavy
crude
prices
recommendations
following
lac
megantic
have
led
to
improved
oversight
and
standards
for
tank
cars
fox
said
but
she
remains
concerned
over
a
recent
rise
in
uncontrolled
train
movements
that
could
be
prevented
with
better
training
less
reliance
on
air
or
hand
brakes
and
improved
physical
defences
we
re
encouraged
to
see
the
progress
made
since
lac
megantic
she
said
but
there
is
still
more
work
to
be
