and
amid
speculation
president
donald
trump
s
political
position
could
be
threatened
by
the
legal
woes
of
two
former
advisers
and
chinese
officials
met
for
the
first
time
in
over
two
months
to
find
a
way
out
of
their
deepening
trade
conflict
but
there
was
no
evidence
the
discussions
would

a

moody

cited
the

war
as
a
risk
to
global
growth
with
emerging
markets
already
battling
high
oil
prices
and
a
tightening
of

emerging

citi
said
that
divergence
in
the
various
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
its
trading
partners
is
likely
to
be
a
key
driver
for
markets
trade
tensions
have
narrowed
to
vs
china
however
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bilateral
trade
war
it
added
despite
recent
signs
that
trade
talks
are
resuming
we
expect
trade
tensions
to
australian
shares
were
a
tad
softer
amid
political
uncertainty
over
the
future
of
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
after
several
senior
ministers
tendered
their
resignations
on
thursday
the
turmoil
hit
the
australian
dollar
which
slipped
percent
for
its
second
straight
day
of
decline
the
pm
has
been
losing
popularity
in
the
polls
but
as
far
as
the
markets
are
concerned
he
s
been
a
steady
hand
at
the
tiller
for
the
australian
economy
and
that
s
why
we
re
seeing
this
move
to
the
downside
in
the
currency
said
nick
twidale
analyst
at
rakuten
securities
another
focus
for
investors
will
be
manufacturing
data
from
europe
and
the
united
states
later
in
the
day
as
investors
gauge
whether
the
spectre
of
a
global
trade
war
is
hurting
economic
activity
a
survey
on
thursday
showed
japanese
manufacturing
activity
grew
at
a
slightly
faster
pace
in
august
as
domestic
demand
jumped
but
export
orders
contracted
adding
to
worries
about
rising
trade
protectionism
the
lead
from
wall
street
was
mixed
overnight
even
as
the

marked
its
longest
run
in
history
the
dow
fell
percent
the
s
p
was
mostly
unchanged
and
the
nasdaq
added
percent
investors
are
considering
whether
a
twin
political
setback
to
trump
would
hurt
the
republican
party
s
election
prospects
and
widen
a
criminal
probe
that
has
overshadowed
his
presidency
trump
was
not
charged
and
cohen
s
plea
deal

not
mean
the

been
implicated
