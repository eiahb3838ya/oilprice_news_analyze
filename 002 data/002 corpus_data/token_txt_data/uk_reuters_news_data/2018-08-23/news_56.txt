micco
godinez
who
rents
out
kayaks
on
the
island
of
kauai
and
loves
surfing
said
he
was
twice
tempted
to
hit
the
waves
on
wednesday
but
kept
his
focus
on
a
more
pressing
concern
getting
ready
to
board
up
his
home
for
a
major
hurricane
with
forecasts
calling
for
hurricane
lane
to
strike
or
brush
past
hawaii
s
garden
isle
on
friday
godinez
has
joined
tens
of
thousands
of
others
on
kauai
and
across
the
state
in
the
rituals
of
disaster
preparation
lane
wavering
between
category
and
category
strength
on
the
hurricane
scale
churned
toward
the
pacific
island
state
with
sustained
winds
of
up
to
miles
per
hour
kph
on
wednesday
as
authorities
urged
residents
to
stock
up
on
water
food
and
medicines
across
hawaii
jittery
residents
lined
up
at
hardware
centers
gasoline
stations
and
grocery
stores
but
nowhere
was
the
sense
of
urgency
perhaps
more
palpable
than
on
kauai
where
torrential
rains
four
months
ago
triggered
widespread
flooding
that
destroyed
homes
and
washed
out
roads
some
people
here
were
just
wiped
out
in
that
flood
it
rained
inches
cm
in
hours
said
hanalei
resident
charlie
cowden
who
owns
several
surf
shops
on
the
island
now
there
is
many
older
residents
recalled
even
greater
devastation
from
the
last
category
storm
to
pummel
hawaii
hurricane
iniki
which
made
landfall
on
kauai
in
september
killing
six
people
and
leveling
or
damaging
more
than
dwellings
godinez
who
lives
two
blocks
from
the
ocean
in
the
bayside
town
of
hanalei
on
kauai
s
north
shore
said
he
spent
part
of
his
day
shopping
for
lumber
and
a
recharging
device
for
his
portable
drill
he
described
the
mood
in
town
as
pleasantly
apprehensive
and
said
he
even
felt
the
familiar
pang
of
one
of
his
favorite
pastimes
twice
the
surf
was
up
and
twice
i
wanted
to
go
surfing
but
i
had
other
things
pressing
on
my
he
recalled
getting
up
early
to
drive
to
a
home
depot
outlet
before
it
opened
at
only
to
find
two
dozen
others
already
lined
up
ahead
of
him
there
s
a
run
on
plywood
he
said
it
was
slim
pickings
when
i
was
pausing
later
after
filling
up
jugs
of
water
godinez
said
he
and
his
wife
would
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
taking
measurements
and
cutting
plywood
to
fit
over
more
than
windows
on
their
house
measure
twice
cut
once
and
away
we
go
he
said
adding
they
would
wait
until
thursday
for
the
latest
forecasts
before
deciding
whether
to
go
ahead
with
fastening
the
boards
to
the
windows
since
hanalei
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
kauai
from
where
the
hurricane
is
most
likely
to
come
ashore
godinez
said
he
was
less
concerned
about
ocean
storm
surge
than
ferocious
winds
godinez
said
he
his
wife
and
two
guests
planned
to
hunker
down
in
a
laundry
room
at
the
height
of
the
storm
should
it
make
landfall
by
late
thursday
or
early
on
friday
with
two
small
laundry
windows
sealed
up
and
probably
no
electricity
except
for
flashlights
it
s
going
to
be
hot
and
dark
