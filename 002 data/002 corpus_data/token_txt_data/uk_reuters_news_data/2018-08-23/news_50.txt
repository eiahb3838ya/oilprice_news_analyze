said
on
wednesday
that
construction
on
the
trans

project
had
faced
a
delay
but
he
did
not
provide
an
update
on
when
the
expansion
of
the
oil
pipeline
from
alberta
to
british
columbia
s
coast
would
be
complete
the
canadian

agreed

ltd
for
c
billion
billion
in
an
effort
to
ensure
its
expansion
went
ahead
it
is
currently
scheduled
to
be
in
service
by
december
yes
there
s
a
delay
because
of
the
construction
was
stopped
for
a
couple
of
months
but
this

a
project

cabinet
meeting
in
nanaimo
british
columbia
kinder
morgan
halted
all
work
on
the
project
in
april
delaying
the
build
for
several
months
some
preliminary
work
has
since
resumed
but
actual
pipeline
construction
is
not

start
until
the
spring

remains
unclear
if
the
expansion
will
be
delivered
on
its
current
timeline
and
budget
the
canadian
government
has
faced
criticism
for
taking
on
the
massive
c
billion
billion
twinning
project
which
will
nearly
triple
capacity
on
the
existing
pipeline
to
barrels
per
day
that
new
capacity
is
desperately
needed
by
canadian
oil
producers
who
face
transportation
bottlenecks
that
have
translated
into
deep
discounts
on
their
product
relative
to
the
benchmark
but
the
project
is
hotly
opposed
by
environmental
activists
some
aboriginal
groups
and
the
province
of
british
columbia
who
worry
about
the
consequences
of
a
possible
oil
spill
