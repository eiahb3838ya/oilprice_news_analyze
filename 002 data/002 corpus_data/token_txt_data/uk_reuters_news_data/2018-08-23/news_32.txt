ukraine
which
wants
to
resume
cooperation
with
the
international
monetary
fund
may
need
to
increase
household
gas
prices
prime
minister
volodymyr
groysman
was
quoted
as
saying
on
thursday
earlier
this
month
the
government
extended
a
freeze
on
gas
prices
until
at
least
reducing
its
prospects
of
securing
more
money
from
the
imf
which
is
needed
to
keep
its
economy
on
a
stable
footing
you
know
that
there
are
obligations
that
our
gas
prices
will
rise
in
conditions
of
rising
global
gas
prices
i
have
been
restraining
this
situation
for
a
year
however
now
there
is
a
question
of
another
increase

news
agency
quoted
groysman
as
saying
during
his
trip
to
western
ukraine
this
requirement
arose
because
we
need
to
work
with
external
borrowings
he
added
ukraine
must
raise
gas
prices
to
market
levels
in
order
to
qualify
for
more
aid
under
a
billion
imf
program
it
initially
agreed
to
raise
prices
under
a
jointly
agreed
formula
but
has
since
postponed
the
increases
a
number
of
times
ukraine
hasn
t
received
any
money
from
the
imf
since
april
due
to
a
slowdown
in
the
pace
of
reforms
that
has
put
the
country
in
a
more
financially
precarious
situation
as
it
must
repay
around
billion
of
foreign
currency
debt
in
the
next
two
years
the
government
may
shy
away
from
potentially
unpopular
measures
like
gas
price
hikes
with
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
due
next
year
but
said
talks
with
the
imf
were
continuing
