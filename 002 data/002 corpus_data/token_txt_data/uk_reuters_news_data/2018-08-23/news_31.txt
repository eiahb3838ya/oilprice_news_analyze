the
risk
of
blackouts
in
australia
s
upcoming
summer
has
grown
from
last
year
as
ageing
power
plants
have
become
less
reliable
the
nation
s
energy
market
operator
said
on
friday
calling
for
more
power
investment
in
the
next
few
years
the
australian
energy
market
operator
s
aemo
latest
outlook
underscores
worries
about
the
country
s
grid
just
days
after
the
government
s
signature
energy
policy
to
boost
power
reliability
lower
emissions
and
cut
prices
collapsed
amid
political
turmoil
close
collaboration
with
industry
in
the
lead
up
and
throughout
summer
will
be
key
to
reducing
the
risks
of
energy
supply
shortfalls
aemo
managing
director
audrey
zibelman
said
in
a
statement
australia
s
southeastern
states
suffered
a
string
of
blackouts
in
and
the
worst
of
which
hit
the
entire
state
of
south
australia
and
shut
global
miner
bhp
s
olympic
dam
copper
mine
for
two
weeks
costing
it
million
aemo
sees
the
states
of
victoria
and
south
australia
most
at
risk
of
outages
in
the
summer
which
runs
from
december
through
february
with
some
risk
in
the
most
populous
state
new
south
wales
where
a
severe
drought
could
deplete
hydropower
electricity
demand
typically
jumps
over
the
summer
as
households
and
businesses
crank
up
air
conditioning
the
bureau
of
meteorology
has
not
issued
its
forecast
for
this
summer
yet
but
has
said
that
temperatures
this
spring
are
likely
to
be
warmer
than
average
the
forecast
risk
of
in
has
increased
since
the
outlook
primarily
because
modelling
has
now
factored
in
a
reduction
in
thermal
generation
reliability
observed
in
recent
years
aemo
said
unexpected
outages
at
plants
have
forced
australia
s
biggest
power
user
the
tomago
aluminium
smelter
partly
owned
by
rio
tinto
to
cut
output
several
times
this
year
as
it
looked
to
avoid
sharp
price
spikes
when
sydney
was
on
the
verge
of
blackouts
without
shoring
up
reserves
there
would
be
a
risk
of
involuntary
during
summer
peak
periods
in
victoria
from
this
summer
in
new
south
wales
from
and
in
south
australia
from
aemo
said
aemo
is
repeating
steps
from
last
summer
when
it
lined
up
supply
and
paid
big
energy
users
to
cut
energy
use
at
times
when
the
system
was
short
on
supply
as
australia
s
ageing
generators
which
supply
more
than
percent
of
the
market
s
electricity
get
closer
to
retiring
starting
in
the
market
will
need
to
find
new
sources
beyond
those
already
planned
to
avert
outages
the
results
emphasise
the
need
for
an
investment
landscape
which
supports
the
development
of
the
portfolio
of
resources
required
to
replace
retiring
generation
