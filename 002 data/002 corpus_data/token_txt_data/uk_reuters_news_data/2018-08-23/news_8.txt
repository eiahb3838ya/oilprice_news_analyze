south

hanwha
total
petrochemical
co
ltd
has
increased
imports
of
condensate
from
the
united
states
and
australia
and
is
seeking
more
european
cargoes
to
replace
iranian
supplies
two
industry
sources
said
on
thursday
the
move
is
in
line
with
other
south
korean
refiners
that
have
replaced
iranian
oil
with
similar
imports
the
petrochemical
producer
bought
million
barrels
of
eagle
ford
condensate
for
november
arrival
and
it
has
also
stepped
up
imports
from
australia
recently
buying
wheatstone
condensate
for
october
delivery
the
sources
said
the
purchases
were
part
of
hanwha
total
s
efforts
to
replace
iranian
condensate
ahead
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
in
november
one
of
the
sources

the

south
korean
refiners
and
petrochemical
producers
suspended
shipments
of
iranian
crude
and
condensate
in
july
halting
all
shipments
for
the
first
time
in
six
years
amid
pressure
to
cut
all
imports
from
iran
from
november
south
korea
in
turn
increased
its
condensate
imports
from
australia
and
will
lift

several
trade
sources
said
south
korean
banks
have
halted
payment
for
iranian
oil
ahead
of
the
sanctions
that
will
take
effect
from
november
although
seoul
is
still
working
to
get
a
waiver
from
washington
to
import
some
oil
from
iran
other
industry
sources
said
before
the
suspensions
south
korea
had
been
the
largest
buyer
of
iranian
south
pars
condensate
spc
with
imports
as
high
as
million
barrels
in
june
the
condensate
or
ultra
light
oil
is
typically
processed
at
refining
units
known
as
splitters
to
extract
heavy
naphtha
for
aromatics
production
the
loss
of
iranian
supplies
meant
korean
buyers
had
to
find
and
settle
for
other
sources
of
oil
that
are
not
great
replacements
for
spc
as
their
heavy
naphtha
yields
are
lower
trade
sources
said
in
addition
to
using
substitute
condensates
south
korean
petrochemical
companies
such
as
hanwha
total
have
also
been
ramping
up
imports
of
cheaper
heavy
naphtha
they
said
hanwha
total
has
been
importing
an
average
of
tonnes
of
heavy
naphtha
a
month
this
year
versus
tonnes
a

traders
said
it
paid
a
