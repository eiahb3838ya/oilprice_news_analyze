slide
in
crude
prices
the
market
is
trying
to
balance
the
worries

growth

how

said
the

deepened
with
the

of
percent

other
s

growth
in
said
moody
s
investor

adding
it
should
cut

point
from
projected
real
gdp
growth
to
percent
in
the

already
led

some

remain
tight
commercial

fell
million

the

more

also
said

was
rising
reaching
million

that
means
the

was
thin
with
just
a
few
hundred

exchanged
said
bob
yawger
director
of

at
mizuho
in

the
fact
that
someone
even
thought
it
was
possible
to
get
there
is
interesting
yawger
said
to
get
to
it
would
need
to
get
ugly
between
now

the
options

much
lower
than

in
a
range
closer
