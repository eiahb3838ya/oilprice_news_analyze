leaders
of
some
of
the
world
s
biggest
cities
vowed
on
thursday
to
make
all
buildings
carbon
neutral
by
ensuring
they
make
no
contribution
to
climate
change
from
london
to
tokyo
mayors
said
they
would
put
in
place
regulations
requiring
all
new
buildings
to
be
carbon
neutral
by
and
all
existing
ones
to
reach
the
same
goal
by
climate
change
poses
an
existential
threat
to
new
york
city
and
making
our
buildings
more
sustainable
and
efficient
is
a
key
part
of
the
solution
said
mayor
of
new
york
bill
de
blasio
in
a
statement
houses
offices
and
other
buildings
account
for
more
than
half
of
all
gasses
emitted
by
urban
areas
according
to
cities
a
network
of
cities
pushing
climate
action
that
shepherded
the
latest
commitment
in
london
los
angeles
and
paris
the
share
is
as
high
as
percent
of
all
greenhouse
emissions
it
said
paris
is
home
to
some
of
the
world
s
most
beautiful
and
iconic
buildings
we
recognise
our
responsibility
to
ensure
every
building
whether
historic
or
brand
new
helps
deliver
a
sustainable
future
said
paris
mayor
anne
hidalgo
experts
said
the
target
was
feasible
but
that
more
cities
would
have
to
follow
suit
if
the
world
was
to
achieve
the
paris
climate
goals
the
paris
agreement
set
a
goal
of
limiting
a
rise
in
average
world
surface
temperatures
to
well
below
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
to
limit
rising
temperatures
to
the
biggest
challenge
is
ensuring
that
developers
avoid
cutting
corners
to
save
relatively
small
amounts
in
construction
today
by
passing
retrofit
costs
onto
future
owners
said
eric
lounsbury
director
of
environmental
consultancy
carbon
trust
to
achieve
the
ambitions
of
the
paris
agreement
we
will
need
all
buildings
to
be
net
zero
emissions
by
the
middle
of
this
century
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
buildings
that
are
net
carbon
neutral
are
powered
by
renewable
sources
and
consume
little
energy
typically
using
led
lights
winter
insulation
and
solar
panels
buildings
are
a
large
contributor
to
greenhouse
gas
emissions
so
to
meet
reductions
set
out
in
the
paris
agreement
it
s
critical
that
we
tackle
this
problem
said
helen
clarkson
