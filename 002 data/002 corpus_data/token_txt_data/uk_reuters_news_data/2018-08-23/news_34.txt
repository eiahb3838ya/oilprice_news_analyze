the
city
of
vaxjo
is
thriving
even
as
it
cuts
greenhouse
gas
emissions
at
rates
more
typical
of
economic
crashes
in
recessions
or
wars
it
is
a
radical
example
of
tackling
climate
change
by
cutting
the
use
of
fossil
fuels
offering
a
glimpse
of
how
the
world
could
stay
within
warming
limits
which
scientists
say
are
needed

avoid

governments

to
cut

under

scientists
are
set
to
warn
governments
in

that
global
carbon
emissions
from
energy
use
will
have
to
plunge
by
up
to
seven
percent
a

to
meet

toughest
goals
unless
they
develop
technologies
to
suck
carbon
from

according
to
a
draft
report
obtained
by

extreme
falls
are
usually
known
only
from
world
wars
the
great
depression
or
in
russia
where
emissions
plunged
percent
in
the
year
after
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
emerging
economies
led
by
china
and
india
are
all
raising
energy
use
to
end
poverty
and
developed
countries
are
wary
of
sacrificing
growth
for
the
environment
what
works
in
a
city
in
a
rich
stable
nordic
democracy
is
not
an
easy
blueprint
still
isolated
examples
like
vaxjo
a
city
of
inhabitants
where
the
red
medieval
cathedral
contrasts
with
wooden
buildings
are
intriguing
for
policymakers
since
it
has
cut
emissions
and
continued
to
grow
bo
frank
president
of
the
city
council
and
an
architect
of
the
green
shift
said
his
advice
boiled
down
to
heavy
heavy
tax
increase
on
fossil
energy
and
reduce
the
tax
on
all
kinds
of
renewable
per
capita
vaxjo
says
carbon
dioxide
emissions
have
fallen
by
percent
from
to
tonnes
from
while
local
gross
domestic
product
gdp
rose
percent
from
according
to
the
latest
available
figures
the
trajectory
is
uneven
but
equates
to
an
annual
rate
of

of
percent
with

growth
by
contrast
worldwide
carbon
emissions
rose
by
two

last

a
record
high
of
almost
five

estimates
that

accounts

vaxjo
has
cut
other
gases
such
as
methane
and
nitrous
oxide
by
percent
since
but
has
not
yet
set
deadlines
for
phasing
them
out
thanks
to
the
early
green
start
vaxjo
s
carbon
cuts
are
far
ahead
of
the
timetable
set
by
almost
nations
in
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
phase
out
net
emissions
of
all
greenhouse
gases
sometime
from
sweden
as
a
whole
has
also
cut
emissions
while
sustaining
strong
economic
growth
the
country
of
million
tops
international
environmental
rankings
and
imposes
the
world
s
highest
carbon
tax
of
up
to
euros
a
tonne
the
notion
that
a
carbon
tax
is
harmful
for
the
economy
in
any
country
is
a
political
notion
not
a
factual
notion
said
swedish
environment
minister
karolina
skog
of
the
green
party
the
burning
of
biomass
also
emits
carbon
dioxide
but
can
be
made
carbon
neutral
by
planting
new
forests
as
in
vaxjo
which
absorb
the
gas
to
grow
almost
no
countries
have
forests
covering
of
the
country
like
sweden
but
skog
noted
that
all
nations
have
some
form
of
renewable
energy
such
as
solar
or
wind
power
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
oecd
says
sweden
produces
of
gdp
for
every
kilo
of
carbon
emissions
almost
three
times
the
average
for
rich
nations

skog
cited

like

group
ikea
which
aims
to
be
climate
positive
by
to
show
that
strong
environmental
goals
do
not
undermine
profits
but
said
we
have
not
yet
completely
decoupled
our
economy
from
carbon
emissions
the
nation
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
fell
percent
between
but
the
rate
of
decline
has
slowed
in
recent
years
rolf
lindahl
of
greenpeace
said
sweden
was
doing
better
than
most
but
not
enough
in
terms
of
phasing
out
fossil
fuels
wildfires
have
made
the
environment
a
big
issue
in
elections
due
on
with
most
parties
pledging
tougher
action
on
climate
change
the
sweden
democrats
who
oppose
sweden
taking
a
global
lead
in
cutting
greenhouse
gas
emissions
because
of
fears
it
could
slow
the
economy
are
expected
to
make
the
biggest
gains
with
an
expected
fifth
of
the
vote
but
mainstream
parties
on
left
and
right
have
ruled
out
cooperating
with
them
the
paris
agreement
set
a
goal
of
limiting
the
rise
in
average
global
temperatures
to
well
below
two

celsius
above

while
pursuing
efforts
for

as
part
of
the

world
leaders
asked
scientists
to
write
a
report
about
ways
to
achieve
the
goal
a
goal
that
many
experts
say
is
unrealistic
the
draft
by
the
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
to
be
unveiled
in
south
korea
in
october
acknowledges
there
is
no
documented
historical
precedent
to
limit
warming
to
but
outlines
four
possible
ways
to
do
it
three
rely
heavily
on
unproven
technologies
for
extracting
carbon
dioxide
from
nature
and
burying
it
a
low
energy
demand
led
scenario
is
the
only
one
to
focus
solely
on
rapid
cuts
in
emissions
and
an
acceleration
of
planting
forests
to
absorb
more
greenhouse
gases
arnulf
gruebler
of
the
international
institute
for
applied
systems
analysis
in
vienna
the
lead
author
of
the
led
said
the
rise
of
the
internet
in
recent
years
showed
that
new
technologies
can
abruptly
transform
economies
smart
phones
for
instance
could
reduce
energy
demand
if
they
replace
cameras
radios
telephones
clocks
televisions
and
music
players
rather
than
being
an
extra
gadget
but
many
say
the
led
scenario
is
also
christian
azar
a
professor
of
energy
and
the
environment
at
chalmers
university
in
gothenburg
said
it
would
probably
require
unpopular
restrictions
on
driving
flying
even
diets
i
don
t
think
that
s
going
to
happen

vaxjo
was
one
of
the
first
swedish
cities
to
build
a
district
heating
plant
run
on
biomass
in
pumping
hot
water
around
the

and
generating

after
the

we
realized
we
live
virtually
in
the
woodshed
said
henrik
johansson

coordinator
at

municipality
it
was
a
local
forest
owners
producing
timber
earned
extra
money
from
selling
waste
branches
sawdust
and
bark
to
fuel
the
new
power
plant
the
forest
owners
then
paid
more
taxes
enriching
the
municipality
overall
sweden
s
green
shift
was
eased
by
a
lack
of
a
strong
oil
or
coal
lobby
even
though
it
does
have
a
big
steel
industry
and
car
makers
such
as
volvo
in
vaxjo
buses
run
on
biogas
bus
routes
are
altered
to
stop
at
new
housing
developments
even
before
they
are
built
and
changes
to
building
codes
are
being
planned
to
limit
new
parking
spaces
the
city
is
also
upgrading
insulation
in
older
buildings
and
has
decreed
that
percent
of
all
new
municipal
buildings
will
be
made
of
wood
by
an
urban
garden
near
the
center
grows
tomatoes
squash
pumpkins
and
sunflowers
sweden
s
local
municipalities
have
huge
power
raising
taxes
and
spending
about
percent
of
all
public
money
on
everything
from
education
to
pensions
in
sweden
we
have
very
high
taxes
and
we
are
also
the
most
decentralized
country
in
the
world
so
what
i
say
happens
said
mayor
anna
tenje
of
the
ruling
mainstream
conservative
moderate
party
it
is
not
always
popular
frank
president
of
the
city
council
said
vaxjo
s
strong
line
on
the
environment
had
led
a
satirical
newspaper
to
describe
him
as
the
head
of
a
green
fascist
state
and
not
everything
is
on
track
gleaming
new
bicycle
racks
for
commuters
at
vaxjo
railway
station
were
mostly
empty
one
recent
day
tenje
said
the
biggest
headache
was
persuading
people
in
rural
areas
to
forsake
cars
run
on
diesel
or
gasoline
making
the
goal
hard
to
reach
we
will
achieve
the
goal
but
maybe
it
won
t
be
by
she
said
maybe
it
will
take
until
