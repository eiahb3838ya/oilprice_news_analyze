analysis-too much oil? texas boom outpaces supply, transport networks
midland
texas
reuters
the
west
texas
drillers
that
drove
the
shale
revolution
have
overwhelmed
the
region
s
infrastructure
with
oil
production
up
costs
depressing
regional
oil
prices
and
slowing
the
pace
of
growth
the
government
continues
to
forecast
the
country
s
oil
output
rising
to
fresh
record
but
competition
for
limited
resources
in
texas
is
making
it
harder
for
shale
producers
to
turn
a
profit
and
encouraging
some
to
invest
elsewhere
texas
is
home
to
the
permian
basin
the
largest
oil
field
and
the
centre
of
the
country
s
shale
industry
in
the
past
three
years
production
from
the
permian
has
risen
a
whopping
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
million
bpd
all
that
oil
means
pipelines
from
the
shale
patch
are
full
so
producers
are
paying
more
to
transport
oil
on
trucks
and
rail
cars
shortages
of
labour
water
and
even
the
fuel
used
in
fracking
are
driving
up
production
costs
at
the
same
time
permian
producers
are
getting
less
for
their
oil
which
in
august
traded
as
much
as
a
barrel
below
the
crude
benchmark
sellers
have
to
offer
the
discount
to
compensate
for
the
higher
transport
costs
we
re
our
own
worst
enemy
said
ross
craft
chief
executive
of
approach
resources
a
small
west
texas
oil
producer
which
last
year
averaged
about
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
daily
output
we
can
drill
bring
these
wells
on
so
quickly
that
we
basically
outpace
the
market
it
is
going
to
take
a
little
bit
of
time
he
said
for
the
infrastructure
to
catch
up
to
producers
approach
resources
is
leaving
some
wells
uncompleted
that
means
the
firm
drills
the
wells
but
does
not
fracture
the
rock
to
produce
the
oil
other
shale
producers
are
also
leaving
the
oil
in
the
ground
waiting
for
higher
prices
to
make
the
drilling
more
profitable
the
number
of
uncompleted
wells
in
the
permian
jumped
by
percent
to
in
august
compared
with
a
year
earlier
according
to
energy
department
data
for
the
rest
of
the
united
states
uncompleted
wells
are
up
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
some
companies
are
reducing
the
scope
of
their
operations
in
the
permian
conocophillips
and
carrizo
oil
gas
each
moved
a
permian
drilling
rig
to
another
oilfield
and
conoco
idled
a
second
the
companies
have
said
noble
energy
also
has
cut
back
on
its
well
completions
and
said
it
is
moving
some
drilling
resources
to
colorado
global
drilling
partners
a
drilling
contractor
based
in
the
woodlands
near
houston
was
set
to
drill
seven
wells
with
a
permian
operator
this
july
but
that
has
dropped
to
two
wells
starting
in
december
due
to
lack
of
pipeline
takeaway
said
john
hopkins
a
managing
partner
at
the
company
there
will
be
a
shift
out
of
west
texas
temporarily
until
they
can
solve
their
midstream
problems
he
said
companies
are
looking
to
boost
their
drilling
in
other
fields
in
texas
colorado
and
oklahoma
he
said
suppliers
including
sand
and
rail
companies
say
they
are
hedging
their
bets
by
expanding
elsewhere
the
price
discount
on
permian
oil
has
hurt
the
share
price
of
shale
producers
such
as
parsley
energy
which
operates
only
in
the
permian
parsley
delivered
an
eight
in
profits
in
the
second
quarter
versus
a
year
earlier
and
boosted
output
by
percent
over
the
same
period
but
investors
have
dumped
the
stock
on
concern
that
plans
to
increase
output
by
another
percent
by
spending
percent
more
will
deliver
diminishing
returns
parsley
s
shares
are
down
about
percent
since
the
company
reported
results
on
spending
plans
in
by
independent
producers
have
risen
a
combined
percent
over
to
billion
according
to
investment
firm
cowen
co
the
in
august
produced
a
record
million
bpd
and
continued
investment
in
the
permian
should
see
the
country
s
total
output
to
hit
an
average
of
million
bpd
in
but
rising
costs
and
bottlenecks
have
already
slowed
the
pace
of
growth
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
estimates
permian
oil
production
in
will
be
barrels
per
day
bpd
less
than
it
could
be
because
of
transport
constraints
permian
output
will
be
million
bpd
next
year
wood
mackenzie
estimates
but
could
have
been
million
bpd
if
more
pipeline
space
were
available
we
ve
had
a
more
significant
increase
in
costs
this
year
than
we
would
have
assumed
timothy
dove
chief
executive
of
pioneer
natural
resources
one
of
the
largest
permian
oil
producers
said
in
august
smaller
producers
without
contracts
to
use
pipelines
are
getting
hurt
most
because
they
are
forced
to
use
trucks
and
railcars
shipping
oil
by
truck
to
gulf
coast
refinery
and
export
hubs
costs
to
a
barrel
compared
to
to
a
barrel
by
rail
and
less
than
a
barrel
by
pipeline
according
to
market
sources
the
shift
is
leading
to
traffic
jams
on
highways
and
rail
crossings
in
parts
of
the
permian
shale
fields
it
also
means
fuel
for
supply
vehicles
and
fracking
equipment
can
be
in
short
supply
locally
truck
traffic
is
unlike
anything
we
ve
ever
seen
said
james
walter
of
colgate
energy
a
based
oil
producer
who
adds
his
company
has
agreements
to
transport
all
of
its
crude
and
gas
production
via
pipelines
rail
capacity
is
unlikely
to
increase
because
oil
producers
are
reluctant
to
sign
up
to
contracts
to
lease
rail
cars
they
would
prefer
to
wait
for
the
new
pipelines
to
be
built
planned
pipelines
out
of
the
permian
will
add
about
million
bpd
of
oil
capacity
by
late
estimates
wood
mackenzie
rail
firms
are
reluctant
to
buy
new
oil
railcars
without
contracts
we
do
think
it
s
a
situation
union
pacific
executive
vice
president
beth
whited
said
in
july
so
we
will
not
invest
to
support
sand
suppliers
have
moved
quickly
to
alleviate
one
supply
shortage
by
opening
new
operations
some
sand
mines
have
popped
up
in
the
permian
in
the
past
year
creating
a
billion
industry
almost
overnight
consultancy
rystad
energy
estimates
these
mines
sell
sand
for
about
a
ton
saving
producers
nearly
a
ton
compared
with
sand
shipped
in
from
other
states
just
as
elsewhere
in
the
permian
however
the
increase
in
activity
is
inflating
costs
preferred
sands
which
has
a
sand
mine
in
monahans
texas
is
paying
workers
there
about
percent
more
it
does
in
other
markets
said
chief
executive
michael
o
neill
prompting
the
firm
to
open
its
next
sand
mine
in
oklahoma
instead
