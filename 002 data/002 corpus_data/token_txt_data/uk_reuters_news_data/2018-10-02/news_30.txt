the
launch
of
a
massive
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
export
project
in
canada
has
finally
fired
the
starting
gun
on
a
wave
of
plan
approvals
around
the
world
needed
to
avoid
a
supply
crunch
after
royal
dutch
shell
said
it
would
export
lng
from
western
canada
by
after
approving
a
billion
project
hot
on
the
heels
of
qatar
s
commitment
last
week
to
expand
its
facilities
the
two
announcements
adding
million
tonnes
a
year
mtpa
to
the
million
tonnes
traded
in
are
just
the
start
of
project
approvals
known
as
final
investment
decisions
fids
that
have
been
waiting
in
company
drawers
while
lng

recovered
from
a

believe
could
be
the

said
despite
a
slump
in
global
lng
prices
between
and
many
had
long
worried
there
would
be
a
global
supply
gap
at
some
point
after
due
to
broadly
demand
and
the
lack
of
new
export
projects
to
produce
corresponding
supply
several
projects
that
had
been
touted
for
years
such
as
shell
s
lng
canada
venture
were
put
on
the
backburner
lng
prices
began
climbing
last
winter
and
have
since
broadly
stayed
at
highs
seasonally
driven
by
china
s
shift
to
gas
away
from
coal
if
you
look
at
the
demand
curve
and
the
supply
coming
on
stream
there
are
simply
not
enough
projects
that
are
being
sanctioned
or
under
development
to
meet
demand
by
shell
s
chief
financial
officer
jessica
uhl
told
reporters
on
tuesday
shell
s
vote
of
confidence
in
these
new
market
conditions
now
gives
credence
that
projects
with
capacities
of
around
mtpa
will
be
approved
by
the
end
of
next
year
as
planned
with
most
expected
to
be
running
by
aside
from
these
projects
with
another
mtpa
in
the
united
states
have
already
been
approved
and
are
expected
to
start
operations
between
now
and
the
end
of
forecasts
vary
but
lng
demand
is
expected
to
jump
to
about
mtpa
by
the
international
energy
agency
has
said
while
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
is
projecting
mtpa
there
needs
to
be
mtpa
lng
capacity
authorised
by
to
meet
future
demand
this
is
a
colossal
boom
a
percent
expansion
on
the
entire
capacity
installed
since
bernstein
analysts
said
in
a
research
note
ultimately
this
is
the
start
of
a
major
lng
investment
wave
bernstein
said
qatar
petroleum
said
it
would
build
a
fourth
mega
train
or
production
facility
with
capacity
of
mtpa
to
bring
its
supply
to
mtpa
by
early
more
than
twice
china
s
consumption
today
and
enough
to
feed
china
s
demand
that
year
other
large
project
approvals
on
the
horizon
include
novatek
s
arctic
project
with
mtpa
capacity
after
the
russian
gas
company
s
yamal
export
facility
started
operations
smoothly
and
quickly
at
the
end
of
last
year
two
projects
are
planned
in
mozambique
backed
by
different
commercial
models
exxon
mobil
s
like
lng
canada
does
not
make
use
of
offtake
agreements
to
finance
it
the
other
is
more
conventional
operated
by
anadarko
a
host
of
approvals
are
also
anticipated
including
from
tellurian
for
the
driftwood
project
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
which
is
seen
as
a
potential
industry
disruptor
