london

half
of
poland
s
electricity
generation
will
come
from
coal
by
though
coal
production
should
remain
at
current
levels
as
energy
demand
is
expected
to
increase
a
senior
government
official
said
on
tuesday
poland
and
germany
are
jointly
responsible
for
over
half
of
the
eu
s
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
coal
currently
around
percent
of
poland
s
power
production
is
provided
by
plant
generation
it
aims
to
cut
that
to
half
by
with
renewables
and
nuclear
providing
much
of
the
rest
and
generation
providing
earlier
this
year
poland
said
it
planned
to
lower
the
share
of
coal
in
its
energy
production
to
percent
in
and
around
percent
in
we
would
like
to
keep
the
level
of
hard
coal
production
at
the
level
it
is
today
some
mines
will
be
decommissioned
but
demand
for
energy
will
grow
all
transition
in
the
sector
will
be
in
cooperation
with
the
european
commission
piotr
naimski
who
is
responsible
for
strategic
energy
infrastructure
told
reuters
at
the
bloomberg
nef
future
of
energy
summit
under
a
plan
to
restructure
the
coal
industry
some
of
the
oldest
and
most
polluting
power
units
could
be
decommissioned
and
replaced
with
bigger
cleaner
and
more
efficient
units
he
said
poland
is
considering
whether
to
open
new
fields
of
lignite
an
intermediate
between
bituminous
coal
and
peat
alongside
new
power
units
which
would
take
around
years
or
build
a
nuclear
plant
which
would
cost
and
take
around
the
same
we
are
considering
which
way
to
go
existing
lignite
fields
should
last
until
the
early
naimski
said
poland
will
host
this
year
s
climate
talks
in
the
mining
city
of
katowice
where
the
implementation
of
a
global
pact
to
keep
global
warming
in
check
will
be
worked
out
the
pact
called
the
paris
agreement
was
agreed
in
and
seeks
to
wean
the
world
economy
off
fossil
fuels
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
president
donald
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
pact
last
year
saying
it
favored
other
countries
research
by
climate
analytics
earlier
this
year
said
the
european
union
as
a
whole
must
shelve
plans
for
additional
coal
capacity
and
shut
down
plants
completely
by
to
keep
its
carbon
emissions
in
check
but
poland
also
has
plans
for
renewable
energy
it
wants
to
have
gigawatts
gw
of
offshore
wind
installed
in
the
it
already
has
gw
of
onshore
wind
at
the
same
time
it
is
trying
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
russian
gas
through
the
baltic
pipe
project
a
billion
cubic
meter
per
year
pipeline
which
will
supply
natural
gas
from
norway
to
the
danish
and
polish
markets
construction
of
the
pipeline
is
due
to
start
in
and
gas
supply
should
start
in
when
poland
s
gas
contracts
with
russia
s
gazprom
are
scheduled
to
end
poland
also
plans
to
expand
its
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminal
by
and
expand
its
transmission
grid
we
will
get
better
security
of
supply
and
diversification
of
gas
sources
and
routes
we
get
percent
of
our
gas
from
russia
now
so
we
are
looking
for
lng
and
gas
from
the
norwegian
shelf
