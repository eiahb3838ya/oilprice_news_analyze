elected
as
president
kurdish
politician
barham
salih
who
immediately
named
shi
ite
adel
abdul
mahdi
prime
ending
months
of
deadlock
after
an
inconclusive
national
election
in
may
the
presidency
traditionally
occupied
by
a
kurd
is
a
largely
ceremonial
position
but
the
vote
for
salih
was
a
key
step
towards
forming
a
new
government
which
politicians
have
failed
to
do
since
the
election
under
iraq
s
constitution
salih
a
engineer
who
has
held
office
in
both
the
iraqi
federal
and
kurdish
regional
governments
had
days
to
invite
the
nominee
of
the
largest
parliamentary
bloc
to
form
a
government
he
chose
to
do
so
less
than
two
hours
after
his
election
since
saddam
hussein
was
toppled
in
a
invasion
power
has
been
shared
among
iraq
s
three
largest
components
the
most
powerful
post
that
of
prime
minister
has
traditionally
been
held
by
a
shi
ite
arab
the
speaker
of
parliament
by
a
sunni
arab
and
the
presidency
by
a
kurd
a
former
vice
president
oil
minister
and
finance
minister
abdul
mahdi
now
has
days
to
form
a
cabinet
and
present
it
to
parliament
for
approval
he
faces
the
daunting
tasks
of
rebuilding
much
of
the
country
after
four
years
of
war
with
islamic
state
militants
healing
its
ethnic
and
sectarian
tensions
and
balancing
foreign
relations
with
iraq
s
two
major
allies
iran
and
its
the
united
states
abdul
mahdi
is
a
trained
economist
who
left
iraq
in
for
exile
in
france
where
he
worked
for
and
edited
magazines
in
french
and
arabic
he
is
the
son
of
a
respected
shi
ite
cleric
who
was
a
minister
in
the
era
of
iraq
s
monarchy
overthrown
in
he
will
become
the
first
elected
prime
minister
in
iraq
not
to
hail
from
the
shi
ite
islamist
dawa
party
abdul
mahdi
was
nominated
by
two
rival
blocs
one
led
by
shi
ite
cleric
moqtada
and
outgoing
prime
minister
haider
and
the
other
by
militia
leader
hadi
and
former
premier
nuri
both
blocs
claim
to
hold
a
parliamentary
majority
but
the
dispute
has
been
rendered
irrelevant
by
their
choice
of
the
same
man
to
be
premier
the
nomination
of
mr
adel
abdul
mahdi
came
after
an
agreement
between
the
binaa
bloc
and
the
islah
bloc
to
nominate
him
via
consensus
and
not
a
majority
bloc
in
order
to
get
past
the
issue
of
which
is
the
majority
bloc
said
ahmed
a
spokesman
for
the
binaa
bloc
led
by
amiri
and
maliki
ameri
and
maliki
are
iran
s
two
most
prominent
allies
in
iraq
abadi
was
seen
as
the
preferred
candidate
of
the
united
states
while
sadr
portrays
himself
as
a
nationalist
who
rejects
both
american
and
iranian
influence
the
rival
claims
to
a
parliamentary
majority
and
uncertainty
over
the
composition
of
the
new
government
had
raised
tensions
at
a
time
when
public
impatience
is
growing
over
poor
basic
services
high
unemployment
and
the
slow
pace
of
rebuilding
after
the
war
with
islamic
state
sadr
s
bloc
welcomed
abdul
mahdi
s
nomination
the
cleric
earlier
on
tuesday
tweeted
that
iraq
is
bigger
than
the
biggest
bloc
a
likely
reference
to
the
compromise
abadi
issued
a
statement
congratulating
abdul
mahdi
and
wishing
him
success
abdul
mahdi
s
nomination
represents
the
best
choice
to
pleasing
all
the
shi
ite
players
who
were
about
to
reach
a
point
of
conflict
and
no
return
said
political
analyst
ahmed
younis
all
the
shiite
blocs
reached
the
conclusion
that
their
divisions
could
lead
to
an
ite
conflict
which
would
weaken
their
position
in
iraqi
he
said
now
with
abdul
mahdi
there
are
no
winners
and
losers
everyone
is
if
the
nomination
of
abdul
mahdi
diffused
shi
ite
tensions
salih
s
election
fuelled
kurdish
ones
the
presidency
was
fiercely
contested
between
iraqi
kurdistan
s
two
main
parties
the
patriotic
union
of
kurdistan
puk
which
nominated
salih
and
its
traditional
rival
the
kurdistan
democratic
party
kdp
salih
s
election
raises
concerns
of
destabilisation
in
the
kurdistan
region
because
of
escalating
tensions
between
the
kdp
and
puk
who
fought
a
civil
war
in
the
the
kdp
and
puk
were
unable
to
iron
out
differences
and
agree
on
one
candidate
as
they
have
traditionally
done
they
competed
in
a
parliamentary
election
in
their
region
in
northern
iraq
on
sunday
allegations
of
fraud
have
created
tensions
results
have
not
been
announced
i
promise
to
safeguard
iraq
s
unity
and
safety
salih
said
as
he
was
sworn
in
affirming
his
commitment
to
the
country
s
unity
a
year
after
kurds
overwhelmingly
backed
a
failed
independence
bid
he
was
the
preferred
candidate
of
most
lawmakers
because
of
his
perceived
softer
stance
on
the
thorny
issue
of
kurdish
independence
his
opponent
had
served
as
the
longtime
chief
of
staff
to
former
kurdistan
region
president
and
kdp
leader
masoud
barzani
who
ushered
in
the
referendum
on
independence
last
year
barzani
had
struck
alliances
with
several
heads
of
major
political
blocs
in
parliament
but
they
were
unable
to
whip
the
votes
for
his
candidate
salih
s
election
marked
the
first
time
in
modern
iraqi
politics
that
one
of
the
three
top
posts
was
selected
without
a
backroom
deal
even
though
the
heads
of
political
blocs
wanted
to
reach
a
backroom
deal
rather
than
leave
it
up
to
a
vote
they
couldn
t
control
their
own
mps
said
renad
mansour
a
research
fellow
at
chatham
house
mps
voted
for
the
candidate
they
thought
was
most
qualified
and
was
most
in
favour
