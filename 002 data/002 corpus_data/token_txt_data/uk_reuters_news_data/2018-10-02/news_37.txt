the
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
industries
believe
they
have
got
their
mojo
back
with
the
overwhelming
impression
gained
at
two
recent
conferences
that
the
future
is
indeed
bullish
it
was
hard
to
find
any
downbeat
delegates
at
last
week
s
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
the
region
s
largest
annual
event
or
at
the
gastech
in
barcelona
the
prior
week
however
one
advantage
of
having
been
around
the
commodity
sector
for
what
seems
like
ages
is
that
sometimes
one
can
get
a
sense
of
deja
vu
the
crude
and
natural
gas
industries
today
sound
remarkably
similar
to
the
coal
industry
of
a
decade
ago
in
the
recovery
from
the
global
recession
the
coal
industry
found
itself
in
the
happy
place
of
being
in
strong
demand
to
fuel
robust
economic
growth
in
china
and
india
the
two
economies
that
displaced
japan
as
the
region
s
top
importer
of
the
polluting
fuel
the
refrain
at
numerous
coal
industry
events
at
the
time
was
the
outlook
is
bright
because
coal
is
cheap
reliable
and
necessary
to
bring
electricity
to
populations
in
asia
that
were
rapidly
moving
from
poverty
to
a
more
existence
this
optimism
manifested
itself
in
some
extremely
bullish
forecasts
which
seem
ridiculous
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
among
those
was
a
forecast
that
china
s
coal
imports
would
rise
to
billion
tonnes
a
year
when
they
in
reality
peaked
at
million
tonnes
in
this
rosy
outlook
for
coal
led
the
industry
to
invest
heavily
in
mines
to
boost
the
availability
of
seaborne
supplies
which
in
turn
led
to
five
consecutive
years
of
declining
prices
as
supply
overwhelmed
demand
but
that
wasn
t
the
real
problem
for
the
coal
industry
what
is
causing
them
more
problems
now
is
the
fact
that
they
didn
t
see
either
renewables
and
natural
gas
in
their
rearview
mirror
a
decade
ago
coal
industry
executives
dismissed
both
renewables
and
natural
gas
as
too
expensive
and
in
the
case
of
wind
and
solar
too
unreliable
what
they
didn
t
anticipate
was
that
renewables
managed
to
lower
costs
dramatically
as
the
take
up
increased
albeit
with
the
help
of
government
incentives
in
many
countries
the
advent
of
battery
storage
also
appears
to
be
mitigating
the
problem
of
intermittent
supply
with
the
success
of
the
world
s
largest
battery
storage
facility
in
south
australia
being
a
case
in
point
natural
gas
was
also
happy
to
sink
the
knife
into
coal
especially
in
the
united
states
with
the
rise
of
cheap
shale
gas
the
natural
gas
industry
could
simultaneously
claim
a
price
advantage
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
being
less
polluting
the
pollution
advantage
also
started
to
become
more
important
in
asia
with
china
aggressively
pursuing
clean
air
policies
that
have
resulted
in
natural
gas
much
of
it
in
the
form
of
imported
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
displacing
coal
in
residential
heating
and
industry
to
all
this
coal
was
left
claiming
it
was
still
cheap
and
reliable
but
the
sharp
rise
in
coal
prices
since
has
eroded
the
cost
advantage
now
coal
s
major
threat
is
the
withdrawal
of
financing
and
credit
by
banks
and
development
agencies
and
the
curtailing
of
insurance
getting
a
new
coal
project
off
the
ground
is
proving
increasingly
difficult
as
shown
by
adani
enterprises
ongoing
struggle
to
start
the
carmichael
project
in
australia
s
queensland
state
in
some
ways
the
only
positive
currently
for
the
coal
industry
is
that
it
is
very
profitable
given
high
prices
and
the
limited
ability
to
boost
output
but
how
does
this
relate
to
natural
gas
and
crude
oil
similar
to
coal
years
ago
much
of
the
positive
outlook
expressed
by
the
industry
is
that
they
are
necessary
for
economic
development
reliable
and
not
easy
to
replace
but
it
s
not
too
hard
to
imagine
a
scenario
where
renewables
combined
with
storage
end
up
being
cheaper
than
natural
gas
particularly
in
countries
that
have
to
import
relatively
expensive
lng
crude
oil
has
a
better
story
to
tell
given
the
current
lack
of
alternatives
for
much
of
its
use
in
ships
heavy
transport
aviation
and
petrochemicals
even
if
electric
vehicles
do
claim
a
large
share
of
the
passenger
car
market
this
will
only
make
a
dent
in
the
overall
demand
profile
for
crude
rather
than
delivering
a
potential
lethal
blow
the
main
problem
for
natural
gas
and
crude
is
rising
opposition
from
environmental
activists
coupled
with
government
policies
aimed
at
limiting
fossil
fuel
consumption
as
climate
change
rises
in
the
consciousness
of
the
world
s
population
particularly
the
young
every
report
of
record
temperatures
and
unusually
destructive
hurricanes
will
be
a
nail
in
the
coffin
of
the
deniers
of
the
science
many
of
whom
are
supporters
of
the
fossil
fuel
industry
just
as
coal
argued
it
was
cheap
reliable
and
needed
those
arguments
are
unlikely
to
work
in
the
long
term
for
natural
gas
and
crude
