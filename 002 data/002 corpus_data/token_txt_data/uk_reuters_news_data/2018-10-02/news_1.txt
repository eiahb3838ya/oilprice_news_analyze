exxon
mobil
corp
is
exploring
the
sale
of
many
of
its
gulf
of
mexico
assets
as
higher
prices
prompt
the
world
s
largest
publicly
traded
oil
company
to
review
its
portfolio
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
tuesday
major
oil
companies
have
been
looking
to
concentrate
development
operations
in
a
few
key
areas
irving
exxon
is
focusing
on
promising
acreage
in
offshore
areas
such
as
guyana
and
brazil
and
onshore
in
the
permian
basin
of
texas
exxon
has
asked
a
small
number
of
parties
to
gauge
their
potential
interest
in
the
company
s
gulf
assets
ahead
of
deciding
how
to
proceed
according
to
two
of
the
sources
adding
that
any
sale
would
likely
happen
next
year
the
company
is
considering
selling
deepwater
assets
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
currently
produce
about
barrels
per
day
of
oil
one
of
the
sources
added
the
company
has
stakes
in
gulf
assets
that
produce
the
equivalent
of
more
than
barrels
of
oil
per
day
and
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
daily
according
to
company
data
exxon
produces
the
equivalent
of
about
million
barrels
of
oil
daily
while
exxon
is
the
most
valuable
publicly
traded
oil
company
it
is
only
the
operator
in
the
gulf
trailing
heavyweights
like
royal
dutch
shell
and
bp
plc
along
with
smaller
independent
oil
companies
like
fieldwood
and
talos
the
gulf
of
mexico
once
considered
a
reliable
basin
for
oil
exploration
and
production
has
become
overshadowed
by
shale
formations
onshore
and
by
new
offshore
plays
like
guyana
where
exxon
s
giant
liza
field
is
expected
to
produce
barrels
per
day
of
crude
in
its
first
phase
exxon
mobil
continually
reviews
its

their
contribution
toward
meeting
the
company
s
operating
needs
financial
objectives
and
their
potential
value
to
others

remain
committed
to
conducting
business
