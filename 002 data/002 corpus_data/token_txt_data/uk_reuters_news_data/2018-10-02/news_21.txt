of
venezuela
s
economy
which
is
struggling
to
overcome
hyperinflation
a
recession
and
scarcity
of
basic
goods
pdvsa
had
estimated
the
berth
would
reopen
by
the
end
of
september
but
needed
parts
have
not
been
obtained
as
pdvsa
continues
facing
problems
to
pay
foreign

financial
sanctions
imposed

to
its

not
arrived
in
the
country
the
fences
were
bought
but
funds
to
pay
the

were
retained
due
to
the
sanctions
a
new
deal
to
buy
them
through
a
third
party
will
take
at
least
another
month
one

the
people

was
not
immediately

pdvsa
has
neither
resumed
