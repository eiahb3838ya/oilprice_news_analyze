assertions
somewhat
misleading
adding
that
the
facility
does
not
contain
anything
that
would
enable
iran
to
accelerate
activities
banned
under
the
deal
the
agency
sends
inspectors
to
sites
and
locations
only
when
needed
the
agency
uses
all

not
take
any
information
at
face
value

its
nuclear
activities
under
the
deal
which
also
lifted
international
sanctions
against
tehran
president

sanctions
are
being
all
information
obtained
including

third
parties
is
subject
to
rigorous

to
arrive
at
an
independent
assessment
based
on
the
agency
s
own
expertise
amano
said
in
order
to
maintain
credibility
the
agency
s
independence
in
relation
to
the
implementation
of
verification

of
paramount
importance
