scientists to publish report on feasibility of climate targets on oct. 8
reuters
the
world
s
leading
climate
scientists
this
week
are
preparing
the
final
version
of
a
cornerstone
united
nations
report
to
assess
whether
global
temperatures
can
be
kept
in
check
this
century
to
prevent
the
most
damaging
effects
of
global
warming
the
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
is
meeting
this
week
in
incheon
south
korea
and
plans
to
discuss
the
report
which
will
determine
whether
global
warming
this
century
can
be
kept
to
a
limit
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
the
ipcc
aims
to
release
the
special
report
on
global
warming
of
on
the
main
issue
of
the
report
discussion
will
be
around
how
we
can
get
to
a
degree
limit
and
what
will
be
the
carbon
emissions
budget
available
to
do
that
said
friederike
otto
acting
director
of
the
environmental
change
institute
at
oxford
university
in
nearly
nations
pledged
in
paris
to
limit
the
global
average
temperature
rise
to
well
below
above
times
while
pursuing
efforts
for
a
tougher
goal
the
ipcc
report
seen
as
the
main
scientific
guide
for
combating
climate
change
will
provide
guidance
on
the
required
actions
to
combat
climate
change
there
has
already
been
a
rise
of
since
the
as
industrialization
produced
rising
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
blamed
for
climate
change
according
to
a
draft
of
the
report
seen
in
june
but
subject
to
change
governments
can
still
limit
temperatures
below
but
only
with
rapid
and
action
the
draft
said
current
pledges
in
the
paris
agreement
are
too
weak
to
limit
warming
to
the
document
said
there
was
a
need
to
increase
renewable
energy
output
by
percent
between
and
while
energy
from
coal
should
be
scaled
back
by
by
that
means
renewables
would
supply
between
percent
and
percent
of
primary
energy
since
the
agreement
was
reached
president
donald
trump
has
withdrawn
the
united
states
from
the
paris
accord
on
the
policy
side
of
reducing
emissions
i
think
there
will
be
a
lot
of
points
of
disagreement
said
michael
grubb
professor
of
international
energy
and
climate
change
policy
at
university
college
london
if
they
fail
to
reach
an
agreement
it
will
be
down
to
a
fundamental
division
on
climate
justice
between
fossil
fuel
producers
and
the
administration
and
more
vulnerable
countries
such
as
small
island
states
who
feel
their
existence
is
under
threat
