different

the
goal
was
to
help
restore
peace
in
libya
and

italy
has
been
tussling
with
neighbouring
france
over
how
best
to
deal
with
libya
which
has
been
racked
by
violence
for
years
following
the
uprising
in
that
overthrew
strongman
mummar
gaddafi
libyan
leaders
announced
at
a
conference
in
paris
in
may
that
they
would
hold
elections
on
as
part
of
a
french
drive
to
stabilise
the
north
african
country
italy
bristled
at
the
move
to
fix
a
date
in
the
face
of
continued
clashes
between
rival
factions
and
few
western
diplomats
believe
the
vote
can
go
ahead
in
the
current
climate
moavero
said
he
did
not
expect
the
palermo
meeting
would
focus
on
specific
dates
no
deadlines
will
be
imposed
or
tasks
set
for
the
libyans
he
said
president
donald
trump
has
given
his
blessing
to
the
italian
conference

moavero
said
he
would
fly
to
moscow
next
monday
to
discuss
the
situation
in
libya
with
russian
foreign
minister
sergei
lavrov
rome
expects
delegations
from
libya
s
neighbours
as
well
as
from
the
gulf
turkey
and
the
european
union
however
it
was
still
not
clear
if
libyan
commander
khalifa
haftar
a
dominant
figure
in
the
east
of
the
country
would
show
up
in
sicily
haftar
s
libyan
national
army
lna
last
year
seized
the
country
s
second
largest
city
benghazi
by
expelling
islamist
and
other
fighters
in
an
interview
with
reuters
published
on
tuesday
haftar
said
he
still
supported
plans
for
national
elections
in
libya
in
december
but
accused
other
players
of
not
fulfilling
their
promises
that
would
have
paved
the
way
for
a
ballot
italy
has
thrown
its
weight
behind
haftar
s
main
rival
prime
minister
fayez
seraj
who
leads
a
transitional
government
based
in
the
libyan
capital
tripoli
moavero
met
haftar
last
month
and
said
on
tuesday
that
the
commander
had
confirmed
his
interest
in
the
conference
