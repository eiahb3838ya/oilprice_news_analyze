reuters
world
equity
markets
surged
anew
on
thursday
as
investors
shrugged
off
the
latest
sign
of
rising
inflation
while
strong
global
growth
weighed
on
the
dollar
and
pushed
it
to
a
low
against
the
japanese
yen
producer
prices
accelerated
in
january
according
to
a
labor
department
report
that
offered
further
evidence
of
growing
inflation
pressures
in
the
world
s
largest
economy
the
report
came
on
the
heels
of
data
on
wednesday
showing
a
broad
increase
in
consumer
prices
last
month
faster
inflation
which
reduces
the
return
of
fixed
income
spooked
the
bond
market
and
had
sparked
a
selloff
in
equities
on
wednesday
but
stocks
later
rallied
on
the
notion
that
strong
economic
growth
can
offset
moderate
inflation
an
index

world
stock
markets
advanced
more
than

the
reaction
to
the
inflation

there
were
a
lot
eyes
fixating
on
the

this

it
came
in

little
hot
but
much
like
yesterday
the
market
s
shaking
it
off
grohowski
said
the
equities
selloff
two
weeks
ago
after
an
initial
sign
of
an
uptick
in
inflation
had
overshadowed
earnings
that
are
so
strong
estimates
may
need
to
be
revised
upward
he
said
we
re
taking
our
earnings
estimates
and
looking
at
them
and
saying
we
just
increased
them
six
weeks
ago
but
you
know
what
they
re
feeling
pretty
conservative
to
us

not
be
a
worry
as
long
as
the
economy
is
growing
and
the
fundamental
outlook
does
not
change
grohowski
said
the
market
s
growing
increasingly
comfortable
that
