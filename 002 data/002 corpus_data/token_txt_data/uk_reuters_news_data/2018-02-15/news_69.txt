a
move
that

pinned

surged
on

with

shrugged
off
the

more
than

in

raising

the

more

the
combination
of
stellar

data
leaves

the

index
against
a
basket
of
currencies
slipped
percent
to
after
losing
more
than
percent
overnight
despite
the
strong
inflation
number
the
recovery
in
broader
risk
sentiment
was
seen
weighing
on
the
dollar
which
had
gained
during
the
market
turmoil
earlier
in
the
month
the
currency
has
been
buffeted
by
a
variety
of
setbacks
this
year
including
prospects
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
and
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
part
with
easier
monetary
policy
concerns
about
the
growing
fiscal
deficit
have
also
weighed
on
the
greenback
the
dollar
stretched
overnight
losses
against
the
japanese
yen
to
touch
a
low
of
having
declined
more
than
percent
so
far
this
week
and
causing
the
nikkei
to
underperform
its
global
peers
japanese
stocks
could
act
as
drag
to
their
regional
counterparts
if
the
stronger
yen
hampers
its
performance
in
that
respect
the
strong
yen
could
be
seen
as
a
factor
preventing
the
stabilisation
in
global
markets
