reuters
just
over
a
year
into
production
cuts
lead
by
opec
and
russia
oil
markets
in
asia
have
tightened
noticeably
as
significant
amounts
of
excess
crude
have
been
taken
off
tankers
used
for
storage
and
delivered
to
customers
across
the
region
shipping

about
are
currently
filled
with
oil
floating
off
the
coasts
of
singapore
and
surrounding
malaysia
asia
s
main
trading
and
storage
hub
for
crude
coming
from
the
middle
east
to
asia
that
s
slightly
less
than
last
november
and
half
the
number
of
tankers
used
for
storage
in
traders
say
onshore
tanks
in
the
region
including
at
vopak
s
site
in
johor
malaysia
are
also
not
booked
out
any
more
marking
a
turnaround
from
when
a
situation
known
as
was
feared
in
which
oil
markets
are
so
bloated
that
they
run
out
of
storage
the
fall
in
storage
is
a
sign
production
restraint
started
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
allies
including
russia
in
january
is
having
the
intended
effect
of
reducing
a
global
glut
the
main
impact
of
opec
withholding
supplies
has
been
to
change
the
structure
of
the
oil
price
curve
during
oversupply
crude
prices
for
immediate
delivery
tend
to
be
lower
than
those
for
later
dispatch
a
market
structure
known
as
contango
that
gives
traders
an
incentive
to
store
oil
for
later
sale
with
markets
now
tighter
spot
prices
are
more
expensive
than
those
for
later
delivery
removing
the
incentive
most
of
the
contango
stocks
afloat
are
sold
said
oystein
berentsen
director
for
crude
trading
at
strong
petroleum
in
singapore
the
oil
price
curve
shows
spot
prices
to
be
almost
per
barrel
above
those
for
delivery
this
time
next
year
floating
storage
is
no
longer
economical
berentsen
said
what
s
more
shipping
data
shows
the
majority
of
tankers
storing
oil
around
singapore
are
only
part
full
in
by
contrast
the
armada
of
tankers
was
filled
to
the
rims
the
main
factors
that
could
flip
oil
markets
back
into
oversupply
are
an
end
to
opec
s
and
russia
s
production
restraint
and
soaring
output
but
saudi
arabia
opec
s
leader
says
it
is
committed
to
withholding
production
if
we
have
to
err
on
the
market
a
little
bit
so
be
it
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
wednesday
output
however
is
rising
fast
and
its
exports
are
increasingly
appearing
in
asia
crude
production
hit
a
fresh
record
of
million
barrels
per
day
this
month
more
than
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
pumps
and
within
reach
of
top
producer
russia
the
international
energy
agency
warned
this
week
that
supplies
may
start
overtaking
demand
growth
again
later
this
year
