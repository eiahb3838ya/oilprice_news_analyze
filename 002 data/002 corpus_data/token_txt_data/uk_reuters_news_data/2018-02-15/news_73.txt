china
s
new
crude
futures
contract
faces
a
mountain
of
obstacles
to
overcome
if
it
is
to
establish
itself
as
a
viable
benchmark
for
trading
with
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
ine
which
is
part
of
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
said
on
it
would
launch
the
contract
on
march
in
theory
this
will
give
china
a
powerful
tool
to
shake
up
global
crude
trading
by
offering
pricing
and
hedging
in
the
heart
of
the
world
s
biggest
market
for
imported
crude
the
reality
is
likely
to
be
somewhat
different
with
potential
market
participants
likely
to
be
cautious
until
they
see
how
the
various
dynamics
play
out
some
of
the
issues
that
will
need
to
be
addressed
are
how
liquid
will
the
contract
be
given
the
limited
number
of
potential
buyers
for
physical
delivery
at
the
bonded
storages
in
china
how
much
government
intervention
is
likely
given
beijing
s
penchant
for
adjusting
rules
and
regulations
to
influence
pricing
if
the
market
moves
in
a
direction
deemed
undesirable
will
traders
be
happy
to
work
in
a
contract
with
the
associated
currency
risk
and
convertibility
issues
will
trade
in
the
new
contract
be
dominated
by
the
chinese
majors
to
the
exclusion
of
opportunities
for
others
given
the
contract
is
deliverable
in
china
how
will
the
inclusion
of
freight
costs
affect
trading
but
perhaps
the
biggest
challenge
face
the
ine
contract
is
the
fact
that
it
is
effectively
based
in
a
demand
centre
rather
than
a
production
centre
as
are
the
other
major
oil
futures
the
three
main
existing
benchmarks
brent
west
texas
intermediate
and
the
dubai
mercantile
exchange
s
dme
oman
are
based
in
production
centres
and
the
delivery
points
are
close
to
where
the
oil
is
actually
pumped
it
s
actually
difficult
to
find
futures
in
the
commodity
world
that
are
based
in
a
demand
centre
with
most
successful
contracts
being
set
up
near
points
of
supply
a
system
that
has
allowed
producers
traders
and
consumers
to
hedge
risks
and
discover
prices
the
ine
contract
will
be
pioneering
a
different
type
of
future
with
the
specifications
showing
that
each
contract
will
be
for
a
volume
of
barrels
and
the
deliverable
crudes
being
a
mix
of
tradable
middle
eastern
grades
as
well
as
shengli
a
domestic
crude
the
ine
has
approved
six
bonded
storage
sites
at
eight
locations
in
china
with
a
total
usable
capacity
of
million
barrels
it
appears
that
the
contract
has
been
and
there
is
little
to
fault
from
a
technical
perspective
but
this
alone
is
unlikely
to
be
enough
to
guarantee
success
the
per
lot
and
the
minimum
transaction
margin
of
percent
of
contract
value
are
probably
large
enough
to
deter
day
traders
and
speculators
however
this
is
a
sword
as
it
will
limit
liquidity
and
volatility
two
things
that
can
be
attractive
to
traders
some
of
china
s
most
successful
commodity
futures
contracts
such
as
iron
ore
on
the
dalian
commodity
exchange
are
dominated
by
day
traders
with
the
volumes
they
bring
helping
establish
the
derivatives
as
important
regional
price
indicators
overcoming
the
trust
deficit
between
foreign
market
participants
and
the
chinese
authorities
also
looms
large
and
it
s
likely
that
many
potential
players
will
be
keen
for
the
ine
to
establish
a
track
record
before
they
become
involved
another
risk
for
the
new
contract
is
that
the
chinese
authorities
want
it
to
succeed
so
much
that
they
effectively
force
majors
and
even
smaller
independent
chinese
refiners
to
use
the
ine
this
could
well
boost
volumes
and
give
the
contract
the
semblance
of
success
but
it
would
be
artificial
and
thus
probably
not
as
effective
as
it
could
be
as
a
hedging
tool
there
is
little
doubt
that
china
is
seeking
to
play
a
bigger
role
in
global
crude
trading
a
reasonable
ambition
given
it
has
overtaken
the
united
states
as
the
world
s
biggest
buyer
however
establishing
a
new
price
benchmark
is
extremely
difficult
as
the
dme
can
tell
you
from
their
experience
in
trying
to
build
the
oman
futures
as
the
main
middle
east
marker
despite
it
being
a
contract
with
arguably
better
technical
specifications
than
both
brent
and
wti
the
ine
deserves
a
shot
at
success
and
ultimately
it
makes
far
more
sense
to
have
a
price
benchmark
for
asia
based
in
the
region
s
top
consumer
rather
than
using
contracts
that
reflect
a
few
small
fields
in
the
north
sea
or
storage
tanks
in
oklahoma
