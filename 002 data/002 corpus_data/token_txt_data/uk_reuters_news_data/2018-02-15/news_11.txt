an
injunction
in
by
britain
s
high

preventing
protesters
from
interfering
with
its
operations
corre
told
crowd
that
activists
were
not
frightened
of
the
injunction
an
ineos
spokesman
said
that
activists
assertions
that
their
legal
action
had
made
all
protest
unlawful
in
the
uk
was
not
the
case
our
injunctions
prohibit
unlawful
acts
by
protesters
and
in
no
way
impinge
on
the
right
to
peaceful
protest
these
injunctions
simply
protect
ineos
and
our
people
from
hard
core
activists
who
game
the
system
and
treat
the
law
