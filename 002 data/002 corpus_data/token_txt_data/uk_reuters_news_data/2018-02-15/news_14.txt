that
the

group
s
growing
arsenal
and
involvement
in

conflicts
threatened
lebanon

security
speaking

the
united
states
was
engaging
with

and
israel
to
ensure
their
border
remained
calm
israel
regards
hezbollah
as
the
biggest
direct
threat
on
its
borders
and
has
repeatedly
struck
it
in
syria
where
the
group
is
fighting
alongside
president
bashar
in
a
civil
war
now
entering
its
eighth
year
the
trump
administration
has
taken
a
hardline
position
on
iran
and
has
sanctioned
several
people
and
entities
associated
with
hezbollah
in
recent
weeks
as
part
of
an
effort
to
increase
pressure
on
iran
the
heavily
armed
shi
ite
movement
is
part
of
the
lebanese
coalition
government
led
by
sunni
muslim
politician
hariri
under
a
complex
political
system
that
promotes
sectarian
hezbollah
is
not
just
a
concern
for
the
united
states
the
people
of
lebanon
should
also
be
concerned
about
how
hezbollah
s
actions
and
its
growing
arsenal
bring
unwanted
and
unhelpful
scrutiny
on
lebanon
tillerson
said
hebollah
s
entanglement
in
regional
conflicts
threatens
the
security
of
lebanon
he
added
hezbollah
has
always
rejected
any
demand
that
it
give
up
its
weapons
which
it
says
are
necessary
to
defend
lebanon
against
israel
it
has
said
its
role
in
syria
is
needed
to
stop
any
sunni
militant
threat
to
lebanon
and
said
in
january
it
believes
the
war
there
will
be
over
in
one
or
two
years
tillerson
s
visit
the
first
by
a
secretary
of
state
to
lebanon
since
got
off
to
an
awkward
start
as
he
waited
several
minutes
in
baabda
palace
for
his
meeting
with
president
michel
aoun
a
hezbollah
ally
the
lebanese
president
s
office
denied
any
departure
from
diplomatic
protocol

few
minutes
early
footage
of
him

tv
channels
throughout
the
day
aoun
later
said
tillerson
had
listened
and
understood
the
lebanese
position
regarding
the
israeli
border
tensions
have
spiked
in
recent
months
because
of
israeli
plans
to
build
a
wall
at
the
border
and
because
of
lebanon
s
decision
to
begin
exploring
for
oil
and
gas
in
an
offshore
block
in
disputed
waters
hezbollah
which
the
united
states
deems
a
terrorist
organisation
has
increased
its
military
strength
since
the
last
major
conflict
with
israel
in
tillerson
urged
lebanese
leaders
to
uphold
the
country
s
commitment
to
staying
out
of
regional
conflicts
israel
has
accused
iran
of
seeking
to
set
up
weapons
factories
in
lebanon
and
the
israeli
military
last
month
said
the
country
had
turned
into
one
large
missile
factory
lebanon
is
a
big
recipient
of
military
support
tillerson
said
washington
remained
committed
to
supporting
the
lebanese
army
and
internal
security
forces
when
asked
about
the
maritime
border
dispute
with
israel
including
lebanese
media
reports
that
washington
had
asked
beirut
to
give
up
a
portion
of
sea
it
claims
tillerson
denied
the
reports
we
will
continue
to
be
very
engaged
with
both
parties
we
ve
asked
no
one
to
give
up
anything
rather
we
are
looking
for
a
solution

said
we
are
engaging
the
governments
of
