sunpower

mainly
in

malaysia
and
mexico
is
seeking
an
exemption
from
the
import
tariffs
president
donald
trump
imposed
on
imported
solar
panels
in
january
unfortunately
we
are
already
seeing
a
negative
impact
from
the
ruling
as
the
increased
cost
due
to
import
tariffs
have
delayed
certain
projects
and
made
other
projects
uneconomical
chief
executive
thomas
werner
said
in
a
conference
call
sunpower
is
considering
significant
cost
saving
initiatives
to
lower
its
overall
expense
structure
werner
added
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
impose
tariffs
on
cheap
imported
panels
was
intended
to
protect
american
manufacturing
jobs
but
many
in
the
solar
industry
have
argued
that
tariffs
will
raise
costs
and
trigger
thousands
of
layoffs
at
the
installation
end
of
the
industry
the
company
said
it
also
plans
to
expand
its
internal
international
businesses
including
its
distributed
generation
business

thomson
reuters
excluding
items
the
company
earned
cents
per
share
in
the
fourth
quarter
ended
beating
analysts
estimate
of
cents
the
beat
was
driven
a
healthy
demand
for
solar
modules
in
as
the
federal
tax
credit
for
solar
installations
was
extended
by
the
congress
however
it
will
take
time
for
companies
to
rebuild
their
project
pipelines
the
company
had
reported
total
operating
expenses
rise
times
in
the
quarter
largely
due
to
a
charge
of
million
related
to
its
residential

the
fourth
quarter

net
loss
attributable
