the

the

losing
more

the

number
the

in
broader

sentiment
was
seen
weighing
on
the
dollar
which
had
gained
during
the
market
turmoil
earlier
in
the
month
the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
by
a
variety
of
factors
this
year
including
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
and
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
easier
monetary
policy
concerns
about
the
growing
fiscal
deficit
have
also
intensified
the
dollar
stretched
overnight
losses
against
the
japanese
yen
to
touch
a
low
of
having
declined
more
than
percent
so
far
this
week
causing
the
nikkei
to
underperform
its
global
peers
japanese
stocks
could
act
as
drag
to
their
regional
counterparts
if
the
stronger
yen
hampers
its
performance
in
that
respect
the
strong
yen
could
be
seen
as
a
factor
preventing
the
stabilisation

global
markets
