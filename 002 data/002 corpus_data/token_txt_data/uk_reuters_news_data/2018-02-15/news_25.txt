president
donald
trump
s
nominee
for
a
top
state
department
energy
position
said
on
thursday
he
would
oppose
russia
s
proposed
natural
gas
pipeline
under
the
baltic
sea
to
germany
the
nord
stream
the
united
states
position
it
is
my
understanding
is
to
strongly
oppose
that
pipeline
francis
fannon
who
has
been
nominated
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
energy
resources
said
during
his
senate
confirmation
hearing
fannon
said
he
would
continue
to
advance
alternate
ways
to
decrease
europe
s
need
for
russian
energy
as
the
trump
administration
looks
to
energy
exports
as
a
way
to
strengthen
the
united
states
international
influence
the
united
states
sees
the
planned
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
between
russia
and
germany
as
a
threat
to
europe
s
energy
security
poland
ukraine
and
baltic
states
fear
the
pipeline
would
increase
europe
s
dependence
on
russian
gas
and
provide
the
kremlin
billions
of
dollars
of
revenue
to
finance
a
further
military
on
europe
s
borders
but
germany
and
austria
have
focused
on
the
commercial
benefits
of
having
more
cheap
gas
arguing
there
could
be
little
harm
from
an
additional
pipe
