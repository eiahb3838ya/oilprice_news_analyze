stocks
and
commodities
steamed
higher
on
thursday
suddenly
shrugging
off
the
angst
that
has
burst
out
in
recent
weeks
over
higher
global
borrowing
costs
on
the
back
of
rising
inflation
economists
were
struggling
to
explain
the
shift
except
for
the
argument
that
historically
it
s
not
unusual
for
stocks
and
bond
market
borrowing
costs
to
rise
in
tandem
with
a
rapidly
expanding
economy
some
just
blamed

time
of

they
speculated
that
wednesday
s
strong
inflation
data
that
many
had
predicted
could
reignite
the
rout
was
probably
distorted
while
asian
bears
may
be
squaring
up
positions
for
chinese

year
whatever
the
reason
though
the

were
back

big

put

s
world
stocks
index
back
in
positive
territory
for
the
year
and
europe
s
main
markets
followed
with
percent
gains
for
me
it
s
a
clear
indication
that
inflation
is
not
as
big
a
threat
as
people
made
it
out
to
be
over
the
past
couple
of
weeks
said
lukas
daalder
chief
investment
officer
at
robeco
in
rotterdam
the
trend
behind
the
market
is
still
very
strongly
pointed
upwards
he
added
was
a
very
market
and
if
that
s
still
the
case
which
after
yesterday
it
appears
to
be
then
we
will
probably
see
new
highs
before
too
wall
street
futures
were
also
pointing
higher
but
just
as
big
a
puzzle
as
the
sudden
rebound
in
stocks
sentiment
was
the
break
down
in
correlation
between
rising
bond
yields
and
dollar
treasury
yields
on

the

tumbled
though

board

to
a
low
against
the

of

as
worries
about
the
government
s
finances
seemed
to
set
again
after
a
white

splurge
and
recent
corporate
tax
cuts
that
also
marked
a
drop
of
percent
from
its
early
february
peak
near
yen
while
the
euro
and
pound
both
climbed
back
above
the

thresholds
the
story
i
hear
most
frequently
from
people
is
it
s
the
of

of
the

s
persistent

there
seem
to
be
concerns
on
the

what
that
implies

last

the

weakness
also
lifted
emerging
markets
and
commodities
though
there
were
a
number
of
idiosyncratic
stories
in
play
too
after
weeks
of
frenzied
speculation
the
resignation
of
south

s
president
jacob
zuma
sent
the

to
a
high
