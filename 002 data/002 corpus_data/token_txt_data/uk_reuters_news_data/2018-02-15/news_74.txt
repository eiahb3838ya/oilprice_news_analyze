asian
stocks
gained

after

brushed

strong

data
and
surged
a
counterintuitive
move
that
also
saw
the
dollar
pinned
at
lows
even
as

jumped

the

wall

surged

with

the

and
snapped
up
shares

and

consumer
prices
rose
more
than

in

as
americans
paid
more

further
raising
inflation
concerns
and
the
prospect
of
the
federal

hiking
interest
rates
more
than
initially
expected
that
drove
treasury
yields
on

higher
on

with

hitting
a
high
the

index
against
a
basket
of

was
slightly
lower
at
after
losing
more
than
percent
overnight
despite
the
strong
inflation
number
the
recovery
in
broader
risk
sentiment
was
seen
weighing
on
the
dollar
which
had
gained
during
the
market
turmoil
earlier
in
the
month
the
currency
has
been
buffeted
by
a
variety
of
setbacks
this
year
including
from
prospects
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
to
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
part
with
easier
monetary
policy
concerns
about
the
growing
fiscal
deficit
have
also
weighed
on
the
greenback
the
dollar
stretched
overnight
losses
against
the
japanese
yen
to
touch
a
low
of
having
declined
more
than
percent
so
far
this
week
and
causing
the
nikkei
to
underperform
its
global
peers
japanese
stocks
could
act
as
drag
to
their
regional
counterparts
if
the
stronger
yen
hampers
its
performance
in
that
respect
the
strong
yen
could
be
seen
as
a
factor
preventing
the
stabilisation
in
global
markets

masafumi
yamamoto
chief
currency
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
in
tokyo
the
euro
extended
gains
to
reach
a
high

after
surging

the
previous

traded
at

ruling
african
national
congress

said
it
would
proceed
with

to
remove
president
jacob
zuma
from

the
australian
dollar
was
steady
at
after
rallying
percent
the
previous
day
in
commodities
crude
futures
were
up
percent
at
per
barrel
after
prices
surged
the
previous
day
as
crude
stocks
rose
less
than
expected
and
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
major
oil
producers
would
prefer
tighter
markets
than
end
supply
cuts
too
early
crude
also
benefited
from
the
dollar

weakness
oil
tends
to
move
inversely

the
dollar

also
of
