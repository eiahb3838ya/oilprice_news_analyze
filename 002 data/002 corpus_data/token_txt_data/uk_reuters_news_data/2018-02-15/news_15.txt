a
bondholder
who
did
not
wish

identified
said
seadrill

not
immediately
available
to
comment

had
previously
claimed
a
total
of

world

in
texas
on
after
being

a
steep
drop
in
crude
prices
under
the
deal
being
negotiated
bondholders
represented
by
new
york
law
firm
stroock
stroock
lavan
llp
and
rothschild
will
get
a
bigger
stake
in
the
restructured
company
than
a
previously
offered
percent
after
dilution
both
sources
said
but
did
not
give
a
figure
unsecured
claim
holders
would
be
offered
rights
to
invest
more
than
million
in
new
secured
notes
and
equity
up
from
the
original
proposal
of
million
they
said
this
is
a
much
better
deal
than
was
initially
offered
we
are
very
happy
with
the
company
s
efforts
to
have
a
pragmatic
discussion
with
bondholders
the
bondholder
said
seadrill
whose
clients
include
petrobras
exxonmobil
total

statoil
has
more
than

rigs
the
company
said
last
friday
that
it
would
update
the
texas
court
on
on
ongoing
talks
with
a
group
of
unsecured
bondholders
and
barclays
bank
who
submitted
rival
proposals
to
the
original
restructuring
plan
proposed
last
september
which
was
backed
by
fredriksen
centerbridge
partners
and
a
group
of
hedge
funds
one
of
the
two
sources
said
the
parties
were
just
left
to
agree
on
how
to
raise
a
final
million
of
the
billion
dollars
of
new
capital
bondholders
and
other
general
unsecured
claim
holders
would
get
a
better
deal
at
the
expense
of
hemen
fredriksen
s
investment
vehicle
and
seadrill
s
main
shareholder
and
some
parties
behind
the
original
plan
but
fredriksen
will
remain
principal
stakeholder
one
of
the
sources
said
hemen
had
around
a
percent
stake
before
seadrill
filed
for
creditor
protection
the
deal
has
to
be
approved
by
seadrill
s
more
than
bank
lenders
who
hold
about
billion
in
secured
debt

banks
agreed
to
extend
maturities
for
about
five
years
provided
that
seadrill
raises
about
a
billion
dollars
in
new
capital
