berlin
reuters
volkswagen
s
drive
to
improve
accountability
has
made
zero
progress
in
the
view
of
a
large
number
of
its
workers
in
germany
the
carmaker
s
top
labor
representative
said
almost
two
thirds
of
staff
see
no
improvement
in
volkswagen
s
vw
corporate
culture
almost
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
diesel
emissions
fraud
was
revealed
works
council
chief
bernd
osterloh
said
on
thursday
citing
results
of
a
labor
survey
of
more
than
workers
carried
out
in
december
at
german
plants
the
attempt
by
europe
s
largest
automaker
to
become
more
transparent
and
improve
troubleshooting
is
seen
by
investors
as
a
key
part
of
vw
s
ability
to
regain
trust
and
avoid
any
future
scandals
there
is
also
the
potential
for
vw
employee
discontent
with
management
to
prompt
labor
leaders
to
adopt
a
tougher
stance
in
dealings
with
top
executives
culture
change
for
us
remains
a
permanent
work
site
osterloh
said
on
thursday
in
comments
released
on
vw
s
internal
communications
network
group
human
resources
boss
karlheinz
blessing
commissioned
to
lead
the
change
in
culture
at
vw
said
the
transformation
needs
more
broadbased
support
to
succeed
we
have
been
saying
all
along
that
a
culture
change
can
not
be
implemented
over
the
short
term
and
takes
time
and
is
also
not
the
work
of
an
individual
or
of
individual
participants
he
said
in
a
separate
interview
published
internally
at
vw
all
stakeholders
are
urged
to
bring
about
this
culture
separately
osterloh
who
is
seeking
as
works
council
chairman
next
month
said
that
workers
were
critical
of
internal
communication
by
management
and
expressed
concerns
about
job
safety
and
retirement
conditions
given
the
continued
negative
news
flow
about
vw
with
the
latest
revelations
of
diesel
fume
tests
involving
monkeys
and
humans
and
prosecutors
raids
on
luxury
brand
audi
it
s
no
surprise
that
sentiment
among
staff
is
declining
blessing
said
with
the
negative
headlines
that
keep
surprising
us
it
would
be
remarkable
if
sentiment
was
not
affected
he
said
we
can
only
apologize
to
staff
for
what
they
have
to
put
up
with
even
though
we
are
not
