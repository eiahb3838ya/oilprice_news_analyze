libya
is
shutting
down
production
at
its
biggest
oilfield
after
tribesmen
and
state
security
guards
seized
the
el
sharara
facility
field
engineers
and
protesters
said
on
sunday
but
there
was
no
confirmation
from
state
oil
firm
noc
if
true
the
shutdown
at
the
field
would
also
force
the
closure
of
the
oilfield
located
in
the
same
remote
and
lawless
southern
desert
usually
pumps
around
bpd
one
field
engineer
said
production
was
being
shut
without
giving
a
time
frame
or
figures
a
spokesman
for
the
tribesmen
which
call
themselves
the
fezzan
anger
movement
mohamed
maighal
also
said
the
field
was
closed
but
adding
to
the
confusion
amid
two
days
of
contradicting
comments
an
oil
source
said
late
on
sunday
that
the
field
was
still
operational
as
noc
was
trying
to
negotiate
to
avoid
a
full
shutdown
he
gave
no
output
figure
el
sharara
lies
in
libya
s
remote
southwestern
desert
where
state
authority
is
weak
chaos
rampant
and
phone
connections
patchy
making
it
difficult
to
get
reliable
information
noc
confirmed
at
noon
only
that
guards
had
forced
the
closure
of
some
pumps
at
el
bharara
which
will
result
in
tanks
filling
within
the
next
few
hours
and
thus
force
a
production
shutdown
a
statement
said
noc
could
not
be
reached
for
further
comment
and
did
not
issue
a
new
statement
after
the
hours
had
passed
which
it
had
said
would
take
to
fill
the
tanks
it
warned
of
catastrophic
consequences
shutting
down
production
at
the
el
sharara
field
will
have
catastrophic
consequences
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
resume
production
because
of
the
sabotage
and
theft
that
are
likely
to
happen
noc
said
in
a
statement
the
tribesmen
stormed
into
the
field
premises
on
saturday
after
noc
said
some
guards
supported
by
locals
had
opened
the
gates
driving
around
in
jeeps
and
filming
themselves
in
video
they
sent
to
journalists
they
stayed
overnight
in
the
vast
partly
unsecured
area
making
good
on
a
threat
to
stop
production
issued
first
in
october
should
authorities
not
provide
more
development
funds
for
their
impoverished
region
we
will
not
allow
the
el
sharara
field
to
reopen
unless
the
mediates
maighal
said
late
sunday
afternoon
he
said
their
southern
fezzan
region
had
suffered
decades
of
neglect
and
demanded
that
the
revenue
of
the
oil
produced
from
local
fields
be
used
to
fund
development
projects
noc
was
scrambling
to
keep
the
field
operating
working
the
phones
from
tripoli
some
km
miles
to
the
north
and
issuing
a
statement
late
on
saturday
after
a
long
silence
saying
the
field
had
been
occupied
but
remained
at
present
open
officials
were
at
the
same
time
trying
to
exploit
the
time
it
takes
to
gradually
turn
off
wells
to
negotiate
a
solution
while
accusing
some
guards
of
being
criminals
field
engineers
say
talks
were
complicated
because
the
protesters
were
divided
the
tribesmen
wanted
development
which
would
time
to
get
under
way
members
of
the
petroleum
facilities
guard
pfg
were
ready
to
end
the
blockage
if
they
get
quick
cash
saying
they
had
not
been
paid
recently
the
guard
has
repeatedly
asked
the
state
to
add
more
men
to
the
public
payroll
with
libya
divided
into
two
weak
governments
armed
groups
tribesmen
and
normal
libyans
tend
to
take
their
anger
out
over
high
inflation
and
a
lack
of
infrastructure
on
the
noc
which
they
see
as
a
cash
cow
booking
billions
of
dollars
in
oil
and
gas
revenues
annually
libya
recently
brought
oil
output
to
up
to
million
bpd
the
highest
level
since
when
a
wave
of
oilfield
blockages
started
part
of
turmoil
since
muammar
gaddafi
was
toppled
