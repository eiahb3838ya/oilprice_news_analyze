a
decision
by

to

a
rebuff

irna
reported
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
to
slash
oil
production
by
more
than
the
market
had
expected
after
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
reduce
the
price
of
crude
despite
attempts
to
interfere
in
opec
affairs
and
prevent
a
balancing
of
oil
supply
fortunately
with
the
resistance
of
member
states
and
the
efforts
of
iran
and
mr
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
this
plan
was
