in

the

cites
a
confidential
presentation
from
the
vw
legal
department
available
to
investigators
in
proceedings
about
the
carmaker
s
alleged
market
manipulation
according
to
the

a
presentation
dubbed
sacramento
and
dated

were
being
violated
and
that
the

may
also
have
breached
its
supervisory

the

also
reported
that
according
to
testimony
from
a
leading
vw
lawyer
referred
to
as
witness
poetsch
received
the
presentation
on
june
he
was
also
informed
then
that
vehicles
in
the
were
affected
and
that
the
financial
risk
for
vw
stood
at
billion
euros
billion
volkswagen
said
in
a
statement
on
sunday
that
it
had
been
aware
of
the
allegations
for
some
time
the
presentation
by
the
witness
is
emphatically
rejected
as
the
diesel
issue
was
the
subject
of
a
number
of
discussions
with
poetsch
in
the
summer
of
volkswagen
said
however
none
of
these
discussions
had
the
content
and
quality
which
could
have
made
capital
markets
law
relevant
for
volkswagen
added
that
until
the
publication
of
the
notice
of
violation
by
the
authorities
on
september
it
did
not
have
sufficiently
concrete
indication
of
a
situation
that
could
be
share
price
sensitive
poetsch
became
vw
chairman
shortly
after
the
dieselgate
scandal
broke
in
plaintiffs
in
a
market
manipulation
lawsuit
in
germany
say
volkswagen
failed
in
its
duty
to
inform
investors
about
the
potential
financial
implications
of
the
emissions
test
cheating
which
has
so
far
cost
the
company
billion
euros
in
penalties
and
fines
the
company
has
argued
it
did
not
inform
investors
of
the
issue
because
it
did
not
want
to
endanger
the
chance
of
reaching
a
settlement
with
the
authorities
