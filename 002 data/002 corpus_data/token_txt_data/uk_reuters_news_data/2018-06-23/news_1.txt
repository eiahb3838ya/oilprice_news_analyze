prime
minister
haider
and
cleric
moqtada
said
on
saturday
their
political
blocs
would
enter
into
an
alliance
bringing
iraq
one
step
closer
to
forming
a
new
government
after
an
election
marred
by
low
turnout
and
fraud
allegations
the
alliance
between
abadi
s
victory
alliance
which
came
third
in
a
may
parliamentary
election
and
sadr
s
saeroon
list
which
won
the
largest
number
of
seats
increases
the
chances
of
forming
a
government
after
weeks
of
political
tensions
we
announce
a
alliance
to
speed
up
forming
the
next
government
and
to
agree
on
common
points
that
guarantee
the
interests
of
the
iraqi
people
sadr
said
at
a
news
conference
in
the
shi
ite
holy
city
of
najaf
he
called
for
a
wider
alliance
consisting
of
all
components
of
iraqi
society
that
would
form
an
inclusive
government
sadr
presents
himself
as
a
nationalist
opposed
to
both
the
united
states
and
iran
s
influence
over
his
country
saeroon
is
an
electoral
alliance
between
sadrist
politicians
the
iraqi
communist
party
and
other
secular
candidates
yet
earlier
in
june
sadr
went
into
an
alliance
with
hadi
a
shi
ite
militia
commander
with
close
ties
to
iran
whose
fatih
coalition
came
second
in
the
election
there
was
no
immediate
reaction
from
al
amiri
s
camp
but
the
prime
minister
said
his
pact
with
sadr
would
not
compromise
the
cleric
s
other
alliance
i
affirm
that
this
alliance
is
not
in
contrast
to
any
other
alliances
either
of
the
two
lists
have
previously
entered
into
with
other
blocs
rather
it
flows
in
the
same
direction
and
same
principles
said
abadi
the
top
three
winning
blocs
all
shi
have
upwards
of
seats
between
them
at
least
seats
are
needed
to
form
a
government
although
traditionally
the
ruling
bloc
in
parliament
tends
to
be
larger
so
as
to
include
sunni
arab
and
kurdish
lawmakers
a
coalition
between
sadr
amiri
and
abadi
could
see
internal
divisions
abadi
had
balanced
and
iranian
interests
during
his
term
and
was
backed
by
the
west
sadr
says
he
opposes
both
and
amiri
is
iran
s
biggest
iraqi
ally
despite
coming
in
third
abadi
is
hoping
to
win
a
second
term
as
a
compromise
candidate
for
the
premiership
analysts
and
diplomats
say
he
would
be
weakened
and
beholden
to
sadr
and
amiri
even
if
he
manages
to
stay
on
however
abadi
and
sadr
both
called
on
the
leaders
of
other
blocs
to
meet
and
agree
on
the
coming
steps
in
order
to
speed
up
the
formation
of
an
inclusive
iraqi
government
political
leaders
in
iraq
traditionally
hold
such
meetings
after
elections
as
part
of
the
lengthy
and
often
complicated
process
of
forming
a
coalition
government
as
no
one
party
ever
wins
enough
seats
to
form
a
government
on
its
own
the
process
is
further
complicated
this
time
round
because
the
next
parliament
is
born
of
an
election
marred
by
historically
low
turnout
and
allegations
of
fraud
the
outgoing
parliament
has
mandated
a
nationwide
manual
recount
of
votes
and
iraq
s
top
court
upheld
that
move
which
faced
legal
challenges
a
fire
at
a
storage
site
housing
half
of
baghdad
s
ballot
boxes
had
raised
tensions
security
forces
said
it
was
deliberate
and
made
arrests
but
said
most
ballots
were
saved
no
party
has
been
identified
as
responsible
yet
the
recount
will
slow
down
the
process
as
the
new
parliament
and
government
can
not
be
formed
until
the
results
are
officially
ratified
by
iraq
s
supreme
federal
court
political
leaders
need
to
meet
soon
in
order
to
end
that
crisis
and
speed
up
the
process
