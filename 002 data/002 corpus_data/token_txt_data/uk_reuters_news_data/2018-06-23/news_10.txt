opec
meets
russia
and
other
allies
on
saturday
to
clinch
a
new
deal
raising
oil
output
a
day
after
agreeing
a
production
hike
within
the
group
itself
but
confusing
the
market
as
to
how
much
more
oil
it
will
pump
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
announced
its
agreement
on
friday
but
gave
no
clear
output
targets
russia
and
other
oil
producers
will
now
meet
opec
in
a
bid
to
secure
their
participation
in
the
pact
benchmark
brent
oil
rose
by
or
percent
on
friday
to
a
barrel
president
donald
trump
was
among
those
wondering
how
much
more
oil
opec
will
deliver
hope
opec
will
increase
output
substantially
need
to
keep
prices
down
trump
wrote
on
twitter
after
opec
announced
its
decision
the
united
states
china
and
india
had
urged
oil
producers
to
release
more
supply
to
prevent
an
oil
deficit
that
could
undermine
global
economic
growth
opec
said
in
a
statement
that
it
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
but
gave
no
concrete
figures
saudi
arabia
said
the
move
would
translate
into
a
nominal
output
rise
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
percent
of
global
supply
for
opec
and
producers
iraq
said
the
real
increase
would
be
around
bpd
because
several
countries
that
had
suffered
production
declines
would
struggle
to
reach
full
quotas
iran
said
the
real
increase
could
amount
to
as
little
as
bpd
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
saturday
he
was
happy
with
the
decision
even
though
he
had
previously
pushed
opec
and
to
raise
output
by
as
much
as
million
bpd
at
this
stage
the
million
is
quite
rational
he
told
reporters
after
arriving
in
vienna
where
opec
is
headquartered
iran
opec
s
producer
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
fellow
member
venezuela
trump
slapped
fresh
sanctions
on
tehran
in
may
and
market
watchers
expect
iran
s
output
to
drop
by
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
means
the
country
has
little
to
gain
from
a
deal
to
raise
opec
output
unlike
top
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
by
not
setting
individual
targets
the
opec
deal
appeared
to
give
saudi
arabia
the
leeway
to
produce
more
than
its
previous
opec
quota
and
fill
the
gap
left
by
those
such
as
venezuela
who
can
not
pump
enough
to
meet
their
official
allocation
but
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
that
was
not
the
case
each
country
which
has
produced
less
than
its
allocation
can
produce
more
those
which
can
not
will
this
means
that
saudi
arabia
can
increase
its
production
by
less
than
bpd
qatar
can
produce
an
additional
bpd
zanganeh
told
argus
media
but
this
does
not
mean
that
venezuela
s
production
should
be
produced
by
some
other
venezuela
will
raise
its
production
when
it
can
and
if
it
can
not
others
can
not
come
in
and
produce
on
their
behalf
zanganeh
said
opec
and
its
allies
have
since
last
year
been
participating
in
a
pact
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
the
measure
had
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
around
per
barrel
from
as
low
as
in
but
unexpected
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
have
effectively
brought
supply
cuts
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
has
warned
the
world
could
face
a
supply
deficit
of
up
to
million
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
both
saudi
and
iran
can
show
that
they
won
an
opec
delegate
said
zanganeh
can
go
back
to
his
country
and
say
i
won
because
we
are
keeping
the
original
agreement
unchanged
falih
can
go
back
and
say
we
will
be
able
to
raise
production
to
meet
market
needs
