interview-iran sees little extra oil if opec, partners stick to deal
vienna
reuters
iran
said
on
saturday
the
world
will
see
little
extra
oil
reaching
the
market
if
opec
and
its
partners
adhere
properly
to
a
supply
pact
underlining
a
disagreement
with
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
opec
and
a
group
of
countries
agreed
on
saturday
that
they
would
return
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
oil
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
by
opec
countries
including
venezuela
and
angola
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
this
implied
an
indirect
reallocation
of
extra
production
from
countries
unable
to
produce
more
oil
to
those
such
as
his
own
and
the
other
gulf
opec
members
that
are
able
to
do
so
but
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
that
no
reallocation
was
agreed
at
saturday
s
joint
opec
and
meeting
or
the
talks
a
day
earlier
there
is
no
such
thing
kazempour
said
some
people
may
do
but
they
are
in
breach
of
the
the
comments
underline
that
disagreement
between
iran
and
saudi
arabia
longtime
rivals
in
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
persists
despite
extensive
talks
in
vienna
this
week
aimed
at
resolving
differences
venezuela
has
been
pumping
more
than
barrels
per
day
below
its
opec
target
because
of
natural
declines
in
its
oil
output
but
in
iran
s
view
other
countries
should
not
step
in
to
cover
the
shortfall
they
can
not
go
and
say
venezuela
has
bpd
on
the
table
and
there
is
no
cat
to
eat
this
meat
i
m
the
cat
and
i
will
jump
on
it
kazempour
said
if
countries
stick
to
their
allocations
output
would
rise
by
bpd
in
the
first
three
months
and
up
to
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
less
than
the
million
bpd
mentioned
by
falih
and
some
other
ministers
this
will
come
up
naturally
some
is
additional
barrels
some
is
restraint
barrels
because
nobody
can
turn
up
tomorrow
kazempour
said
iran
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
president
donald
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
according
to
kazempour
venezuela
had
said
its
output
would
partially
recover
in
the
next
three
to
four
months
another
reason
why
other
producers
should
not
step
in
to
compensate
venezuela
told
us
that
bpd
will
come
back
