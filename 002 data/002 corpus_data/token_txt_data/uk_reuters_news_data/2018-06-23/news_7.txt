pledging
a
measurable

but
giving
no

on

oil
producers
agreed
to
participate
in
the
pact
but
a
communique
issued
after
their
talks
with
the
group
provided
no
concrete
numbers
amid
deep
disagreements
between
opec
saudi
arabia
and
iran
president
donald
trump
was
among
those
wondering
how
much
more
oil
opec
would
deliver
hope
opec
will
increase
output
substantially
need
to
keep
prices
down
trump
wrote
on
twitter
after
opec
announced
its
friday
decision
the
united
states
china
and
india
had
urged
oil
producers
to
release
more
supply
to
prevent
an
oil
deficit
that
could
undermine
global
economic
growth
opec
and
said
in
their
statement
that
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
cuts
after
months
of
underproduction
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
opec
and
combined
would
pump
roughly
an
extra
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
coming
months
equal
to
percent
of
global
supply
top
global
exporter
saudi
arabia
will
increase
output
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
barrels
he
said
with
exact
figures
to
be
decided
later
we
already
mobilised
the
aramco
machinery
before
coming
to
vienna
this
meeting
falih
said
referring
to
the
saudi
state
oil
company
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
his
country
would
add
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
asked
to
what
extent
the
decision
to
increase
supply
had
been
driven
by
pressure
from
trump
novak
said
it
is
obvious
that
we
are
not
being
driven
by
tweets
but
base
our
actions
on
deep
market
iran
opec
s
producer
had
demanded
opec
reject
calls
from
trump
for
an
increase
in
oil
supply
arguing
that
he
had
contributed
to
a
recent
rise
in
prices
by
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
fellow
member
venezuela
trump
slapped
fresh
sanctions
on
tehran
in
may
and
market
watchers
expect
iran
s
output
to
drop
by
a
third
by
the
end
of
that
means
the
country
has
little
to
gain
from
a
deal
to
raise
output
unlike
saudi
arabia
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
the
real
increase
could
amount
to
as
little
as
bpd
because
saudi
arabia
would
not
be
allowed
to
pump
more
on
behalf
of
venezuela
where
output
has
collapsed
in
recent
months
each
country
which
has
produced
less
than
its
allocation
can
produce
more
those
which
can
not
will
not
this
means
that
saudi
arabia
can
increase
its
production
by
less
than
bpd
zanganeh
told
argus
media
but
falih
said
quota
reallocations
did
not
have
to
be
strict
meaning
saudi
wanted
to
fill
the
gaps
left
by
others
some
of
the
countries
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
produce
so
the
others
will
and
that
implies
there
will
be
indirectly
a
reallocation
falih
said
he
also
said
opec
could
hold
an
extraordinary
meeting
before
its
next
formal
talks
due
on
or
adjust
deliveries
in
september
when
its
monitoring
committee
meets
if
global
oil
supply
fell
further
because
of
sanctions
on
iran
opec
and
its
allies
have
since
last
year
been
participating
in
a
pact
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
the
measure
had
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
around
per
barrel
from
as
low
as
in
but
unexpected
outages
in
venezuela
libya
and
angola
have
effectively
brought
supply
cuts
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
months
falih
has
warned
the
world
could
face
a
supply
deficit
of
up
to
million
bpd

the
second
