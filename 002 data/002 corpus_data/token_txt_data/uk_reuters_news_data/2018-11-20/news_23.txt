glacier
melt
at
major
sites
in
western
china
is
accelerating
fast
greenpeace
said
on
tuesday
prompting
thousands
to
evacuate
in
recent
months
and
underscoring
the
vulnerability
to
climate
change
in
a
call
for
the
world
satellite
analysis
showed
that
the
rate
of
retreat
at
glaciers
in
china
s
remote
western
regions
had
more
than
doubled
greenpeace
said
with
the
annual
rate
at
the
tianshan
glacier
no
in
xinjiang
rising
from
an
average
of
square
meters
between
and
to
square
meters
between
and
this
year
this
is
a
call
for
china
and
the
world

campaigner

glaciers
in
china
supply
water
to
billion
people

re
melting
fast
in
just
the
last
few
months
thousands
of
people
have
been
evacuated
from
their
homes
due
to
threats
of
greenpeace
has
identified
two
major
disasters
caused
by
glacier
melt
this
year
including
the
release
of
million
cubic
meters
of
floodwater
into
the
yarkant
river
basin
that
forced
the
evacuation
of
residents
in
august
researchers
with
the
china
academy
of
sciences
said
in
september
that
glaciers
in
the
plateau
had
shrunk
percent
as
a
result
of
rising
temperatures
over
the
last
years
temperatures
in
the
region
are
rising
faster
than
the
global
average
they
said
china
has
pledged
to
bring
carbon
emissions
to
a
peak
by
around
as
part
of
its
commitment
to
the
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
keep
average
global
temperature
increases
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
the
historical
norm
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
warned
in
a
report
in
october
that
zones
like
the
tibetan
plateau
would
be
especially
vulnerable
if
global
temperature
rises
were
not
restricted
to
degrees
celsius
another
cas
study
published
in
october
said
china
was
at
risk
of
longer
and
more
intense
drought
as
well
as
more
destructive
flooding
if
global
temperature
rises
were
not
limited
to
degrees
