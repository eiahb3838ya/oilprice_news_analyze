global
oil
markets
are
adjusting
to
relatively
strong
demand
for
diesel
and
jet
fuel
compared
to
gasoline
coupled
with
the
introduction
of
new
bunker
fuel
regulations
at
the
start
of
rising
diesel
and
jet
fuel
prices
at
least
relative
to
crude
and
gasoline
are
forcing
adjustments
that
should
lessen
the
chance
of
a
severe
shortage
at
the
end
of
next
year
futures
prices
for
diesel
delivered
at
new
york
harbor
have
moved
to
a
premium
of
more
than
per
barrel
over
futures
prices
for
gasoline
delivered
at
the
same
location
the
diesel
premium
has
doubled
since
the
end
of
september
it
is
trading
at
the
highest
level
since
and
before
that
both
of
which
were
years
when
diesel
consumption
was
growing
much
faster
than
gasoline
refiners
have
a
strong
incentive
to
maximise
the
production
of
diesel
and
jet
fuel
while
minimising
output
of
gasoline
and
many
are
adjusting
production
plans
in
response
in
the
united
states
for
example
refiners
cut
gasoline
yields
by
percentage
point
while
boosting
yields
of
jet
fuel
by
point
and
distillate

oil
by
point
in
august
compared
with
a
year
earlier
refiners
produced
a
barrels
of
middle
distillates
mostly
diesel
and
jet
fuel
from
every
barrels
of
crude
in
august
the
most
recent
month
for
which
data
is
available
refiners
have
rarely
squeezed
more
middle
distillate
from
each
barrel
of
crude
they
process
according
to
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
eia
chartbook
at
the
same
time
refiners
produced
fewer
than
barrels
of
gasoline
per
barrels
of
crude
close
to
lows
petroleum
supply
monthly
eia
october
as
a
result
the
ratio
of
distillate
to
gasoline
production
is
at
the
highest
level
since
the
summer
of
when
oil
prices
were
spiking
before
the
global
financial
crisis
global
diesel
consumption
has
generally
been
rising
faster
than
gasoline
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
diesel
consumption
increased
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
between
and
while
gasoline
was
up
by
just
million

statistical

refiners
have
responded
by
squeezing
more
diesel
and
jet
fuel
from
every
barrel
mostly
at
the
expense
of
products
such
as
heavy
fuel
oil
bitumen
and
asphalt
refiners
made
almost
barrels
of
diesel
and
jet
fuel
from
every
barrels
of
crude
in
up
from
barrels
in
according
to
the
eia
over
the
same
period
production
of
residual
fuel
oil
and
asphalt
declined
from
nine
barrels
to
fewer
than
five
barrels
per
petroleum
supply

the
international
maritime
organization
s
new
regulations
on
bunker
fuels
are
likely
to
accelerate
the
transition
to
distillate
fuel
oil
and
away
from
heavy
fuel
oil
from
the
start
of
the
regulations
will
require
ship
owners
to
start
using
distillate
fuel
oil
unless
they
start
buying
heavy
fuel
oil
or
install
exhaust
gas
cleaning
systems
scrubbers
some
analysts
have
expressed
concern
that
the
regulations
will
create
an
acute
shortage
of
middle
distillates
resulting
in
a
surge
in
diesel
and
jet
fuel
prices
and
pulling
up
crude
oil
prices
with
them
but
with
prices
already
starting
to
adjust
there
is
probably
enough
flexibility
in
the
system
to
enable
it
to
meet
the
rise
in
middle
distillate
demand
over
the
next
months
experience
shows
refiners
have
flexibility
to
adjust
the
mix
by
two
to
four
barrels
per
barrels
of
crude
and
in
some
cases
more
in
the
short
term
by
making
straightforward
operational
changes
for
example
fluid
catalytic
cracking
units
can
be
operated
at
reduced
severity
to
cut
the
production
of
light
hydrocarbons
in
the
gasoline
range
and
increase
the
number
of
heavier
hydrocarbons
in
the
diesel
and
jet
range
fcc
units
play
a
critical
role
in
giving
refiners
the
flexibility
to
adjust
their
output
mix
in
response
to
changes
in
demand
over
a
matter
of
months
over
longer
time
horizons
refiners
have
multiple
routes
to
increase
the
output
of
diesel
by
investing
in
new
processing
units
refinery
configurations
for
maximum
conversion
to
middle
distillates
chevron
most
refiners
have
been
planning
to
increase
their
yield
of
middle
distillates
for
nearly
a
decade
in
response
to
projections
of
increased
diesel
demand
the
new
in
the
middle
east
and
asia
have
all
been
planned
to
maximise
the
production
of
middle
distillates
for
the
transport
market
in
anticipation
of
new
imo
rules
and
projected
increases
in
freight
demand
on
the
consumption
side
price
changes
will
help
smooth
the
adjustment
to
imo
rules
with
higher
diesel
prices
forcing
more
fuel
efficiency
in
the
freight
transportation
sector
and
the
sharp
rise
in
diesel
prices
relative
to
gasoline
is
likely
to
accelerate
the
shift
away
from
diesel
among
european
motorists
making
more
fuel
available
to
the
shipping
sector
by
encouraging
maximum
refinery
production
and
restraining
consumption
over
the
next
six
to
nine
months
the
rise
in
diesel
prices
should
help
build
stocks
and
reduce
the
risk
of
a
price
spike

late
