oslo
reuters
norwegian
oil
and
gas
company
equinor
is
preparing
to
pay
for
the
protection
of
tropical
forests
to
help
reduce
its
carbon
footprint
it
said
on
tuesday
the
investments
could
start
in
pending
the
establishment
of
a
market
a
company
spokesman
said
although
he
declined
to
comment
on
payment
size
while
equinor
s
european
emissions
are
subject
to
carbon
taxes
the
company
is
also
active
in
regions
such
as
africa
the
americas
and
others
that
are
not
part
of
similar
schemes
equinor
is
now
preparing
investments
in
reduced
deforestation
corresponding
to
the
emissions
from
the
company
s
volumes
from
operated
production
in
areas
where
there
is
no
price
on
the
company
said
in
a
statement
emissions
from
this
operated
production
were
slightly
below
million
tonnes
in
this
underlines
equinor
s
support
for
a
global
price
on
carbon
it
said
preventing
deforestation
is
vital
to
reaching
the
goals
of
the
paris
climate
accords
and
a
key
reason
why
equinor
will
put
a
price
tag
on
its
own
greenhouse
gas
emissions
it
said
equinor
also
hopes
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
an
international
carbon
market
that
would
enable
companies
to
invest
in
the
protection
of
tropical
forests
