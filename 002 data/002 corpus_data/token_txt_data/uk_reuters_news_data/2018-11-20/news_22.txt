coal
exporters
have
effectively
lost
a
promising
market
in
china
since
the
imposition
of
tariffs
as
part
of
the
ongoing
trade
dispute
but
so
far
they
have
managed
to
find
other
buyers
in
asia
chiefly
india
china
imposed
a
percent
tariff
on
imports
of
coal
in
august
as
part
of
its
retaliation
against
tariffs
on
its
exports
implemented
by
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
show
that
no
coal
from
the
united
states
was
discharged
in
china
in
october
while
two
cargoes
totalling
tonnes
are
being
unloaded
this
month
however
both
the
cargoes
being
unloaded
in
november
left
the
united
states
before
the
tariffs
took
effect
on
while
china
isn
t
the
most
important
asian
buyer
for
coal
it
had
been
growing
in
importance
until
this
year
in
the
first
months
of
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
which
was
down
from
million
for
the
same
period
last
year
much
of
the
coal
china
buys
from
the
united
states
is
higher
value
coking
coal
used
in
steel
making
and
it
usually
is
at
least
double
the
price
of
thermal
coal
used
for
power
generation
the
loss
of
the
china
market
hasn
t
been
a
devastating
blow
to
coal
exporters
as
they
have
so
far
been
able
to
find
other
buyers
in
asia
india
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
from
the
united
states
in
the
first
months
of
the
year
according
to
refinitiv
data
up
percent
from
the
million
tonnes
in
the
same
period
in
japan
asia
s
coal
importer
behind
china
and
india
bought
million
tonnes
from
the
united
states
in
the
january
to
october
period
up
from
million
tonnes
in
the
same
period
last
year
overall
asia
s
imports
from
the
united
states
were
million
tonnes
in
the
first
months
of
the
year
up
percent
from
the
million
in
the
same
period
last
year
that
doesn
t
sound
like
a
poor
outcome
for
coal
exporters
but
the
data
doesn
t
reflect
whether
it
has
been
relatively
easy
for
coal
miners
to
sell
their
product
in
asia
or
whether
they
have
been
offering
discounts
in
order
to
stay
competitive
with
the
region
s
powerhouse
exporters
australia
and
indonesia
since
china
stopped
providing
detailed
customs
data
earlier
this
year
it
s
been
difficult
to
work
out
how
much
the
country
is
paying
for
various
coal
imports
by
country
of
origin
however
data
on
the
website
of
the
energy
information
administration
shows
that
the
average
price
of
coking
coal
exports
to
china
in
the
second
quarter
of
this
year
was
a
short
tonne
equivalent
to
about
a
metric
tonne
for
india
the
price
for
coking
coal
exports
was
about
a
metric
tonne
in
the
april
to
june
period
for
the
same
quarter
the
price
of
coking
coal
futures
on
the
singapore
exchange
which
are
based
on
the
steel
index
price
for
australian
cargoes
was
between
and
a
tonne
while
the
pricing
doesn
t
take
into
account
any
quality
differentials
or
freight
costs
it
does
nonetheless
imply
that
coal
exporters
had
to
discount
in
order
to
sell
into
the
chinese
market
there
may
also
be
some
disturbing
signs
for
coal
exporters
to
india
with
imports
slowing
in
recent
months
from
a
peak
of
million
tonnes
in
may
india
s
imports
of
coal
have
trended
lower
with
october
recording
million
tonnes
according
to
the
refinitiv
data
november
may
be
slightly
better
with
the
data
showing
india
s
imports
of
coal
at
around
million
tonnes
but
this
is
still
well
below
the
may
peak
overall
while
it
seems
that
coal
exporters
have
been
able
to
find
markets
in
asia
to
replace
lost
volumes
to
china
it
may
be
at
the
cost
of
having
to
accept
lower
prices
and
to
become
more
reliant
on
sales
to
india
a
country
that
has
a
government
policy
of
reducing
coal
imports
to
zero

opinions
expressed
here
