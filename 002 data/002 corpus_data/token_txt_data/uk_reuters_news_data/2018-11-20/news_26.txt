global

tensions
trillions

recorded
its
steepest
drop
in

the

chair
richard
clarida
and
dallas
fed

robert
kaplan
late
last

raised
concerns
over
a
potential
global
slowdown
the

has
rallied
strongly
this
year
buoyed
by
three
fed
rate
hikes
and
a
robust
economy
though
some
expect
the
bull
run
may
be
nearing
an
end

a
low
