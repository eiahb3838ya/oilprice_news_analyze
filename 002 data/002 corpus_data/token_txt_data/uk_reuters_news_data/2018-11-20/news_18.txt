warsaw

poland
expects
its
first
nuclear
power
plant
to
start
operating
after
as
the
country
aims
to
cut
its
use
of
coal
in
producing
electricity
deputy
environment
minister
michal
kurtyka
said
the
east
european
country
which
hosts
global
climate
talks
in
december
generates
around
percent
of
its
electricity
from
coal
in
outdated
power
plants
many
of
which
will
have
to
close
in
the
coming
decade
poland
has
considered
building
a
nuclear
power
plant
for
years
but
has
yet
to
take
a
binding
decision
on
the
project
the
discussion
over
launching
the
nuclear
power
plant
has
accelerated
it
is
mostly
about
the
international
partnership
we
are
able
to
finance
the
construction
on
our
own
but
we
have
to
draw
the
technology
from
somewhere
kurtyka
told
reuters
he
added
poland
would
talk
with
france
the
united
states
japan
and
south
korea
about
nuclear
technologies
the
energy
minister
is
also
in
such
talks
with
the
side
the
recent
signals
show
that
they
are
very
advanced
i
assume
that
the
nuclear
power
station
will
start
generating
power
after
said
kurtyka
also
a
former
deputy
energy
minister
during
a
visit
to
poland
earlier
in
november
energy
secretary
rick
perry
and
polish
energy
minister
krzysztof
tchorzewski
signed
a
joint
declaration
of
enhanced
cooperation
over
energy
security
including
the
nuclear
power
plant
the
energy
ministry
is
expected
to
publish
poland
s
energy
policy
by
the
end
of
the
year
likely
at
the
climate
conference
in
katowice
the
heart
of
the
coal
industry
in
the
south
of
the
country
government
officials
have
said
poland
will
gradually
reduce
its
reliance
on
coal
so
it
accounts
for
half
of
electricity
generation
by
in
future
the
significance
of
coal
in
poland
s
energy
supplies
will
be
diminishing
we
assume
that
in
the
share
of
coal
in
poland
s
energy
mix
will
be
percent
said
kurtyka
he
added
that
gigawatts
or
percent
of
poland
s
installed
power
capacity
in
will
be
based
on
coal
while
the
remaining
energy
sources
will
be
wind
some
photovoltaic
and
gas
