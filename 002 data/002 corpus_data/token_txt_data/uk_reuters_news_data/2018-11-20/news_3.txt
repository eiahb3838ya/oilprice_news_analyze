the
environmental
protection
agency
granted
oil
major
chevron
corp
a
hardship
waiver
from
biofuel
laws
for
its
utah
refinery
earlier
this
year
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
company
s
operations
chevron
which
reported
a
net
income
of
billion
in
becomes
the
largest
known
company
to
be
awarded
a
hardship
waiver
from
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
which
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
pool
or
buy
compliance
credits
from
competitors
that
do
the
waivers
which
have
grown
significantly
under
the
trump
administration
have
angered
farmers
who
say
it
hurts
demand
for
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
when
an
oil
company
whose
net
profits
surpass
the
total
value
of
the
iowa
corn
crop
claims
it
is
experiencing
hardship
you
know
we
ve
reached
a
new
level
of
absurdity
said
geoff
cooper
ceo
of
the
renewable
fuels
association
chevron
declined
to
confirm
whether
it
received
a
small
refinery
hardship
waiver
but
did
say
that
seeking
them
can
level
the
playing
field
epa
has
acknowledged
that
it
has
granted
several
small
refinery
exemptions
from
the
rfs
any
chevron
refinery
not
exempted
from
the
rfs
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
highly
competitive
markets
where
we
operate
the
company
said
in
an
emailed
statement
the
epa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
refineries
with
a
capacity
less
than
can
receive
waivers
from
the
rfs
if
they
prove
compliance
would
cause
them
disproportionate
hardship
chevron
s
salt
lake
city
utah
plant
is
the
epa
under
president
donald
trump
expanded
the
waiver
program
awarding
exemptions
for
the
calendar
year
up
from
in
and
just
seven
in
epa
data
shows
the
epa
has
attributed
the
program
s
expansion
to
a
lawsuit
brought
by
two
oil
refiners
who
challenged
the
epa
s
denial
of
their
waiver
request
a
federal
judge
ruled
the
epa
was
using
too
narrow
of
a
test
to
evaluate
applications
biofuel
backers
say
the
expansion
was
politically
driven
by
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
who
sought
ways
to
lower
compliance
costs
for
refiners
the
chevron
approval
was
granted
under
pruitt
the
source
said
the
surge
in
hardship
waivers
has
pummeled
the
price
for
compliance
credits
some
refiners
must
buy
reuters
previously
reported
that
chevron
along
with
exxon
mobil
corp
sought
a
hardship
waiver
from
biofuel
laws
exxon
mobil
s
application
status
was
unclear
