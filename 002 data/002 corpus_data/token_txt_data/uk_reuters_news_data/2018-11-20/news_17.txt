epa plans biofuel 'reset' as program misses u.s. congress' targets
new
york
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
will
propose
new
targets
for
the
final
three
years
of
the
nation
s
renewable
fuel
program
in
january
replacing
ambitious
goals
set
by
congress
with
volumes
closer
to
the
industry
s
current
output
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
planned
reset
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
is
likely
to
set
up
a
fresh
battle
between
two
industries
with
corn
growers
wanting
the
highest
possible
targets
to
spur
investment
and
oil
companies
eyeing
the
smallest
to
reduce
costs
the
standard
which
expires
in
was
established
in
to
boost
the
corn
belt
economy
and
help
wean
the
country
off
of
fossil
fuels
refiners
are
required
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
gasoline
and
diesel
each
year
or
purchase
blending
credits
from
companies
that
do
oil
companies
say
the
policy
costs
them
a
fortune
yet
it
has
fallen
short
of
original
targets
because
production
has
proven
more
costly
and
inefficient
than
expected
even
with
subsidies
the
two
sources
who
requested
anonymity
because
they
are
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
about
the
matter
said
on
monday
the
epa
was
planning
to
slash
the
target
to
bring
it
closer
to
current
market
realities
but
added
that
the
agency
had
not
settled
on
a
number
an
epa
official
confirmed
the
agency
is
working
with
stakeholders
on
a
reset
proposal
and
aimed
to
finalize
its
plan
by
november
congress
had
hoped
biofuel
production
volumes
under
the
standard
would
hit
billion
gallons
by
but
the
industry
in
produced
only
around
billion
with
advanced
biofuels
made
from
things
like
corn
fiber
and
algae
posting
the
biggest
shortfalls
as
a
result
the
epa
has
been
forced
to
ignore
the
statutory
targets
in
its
annual
process
setting
out
instead
what
it
views
as
more
realistic
and
attainable
yearly
mandates
for
the
first
time
the
epa
wants
to
officially
rewrite
the
congressional
targets
for
through
the
trump
administration
has
tried
to
reduce
compliance
costs
for
refiners
drawing
the
ire
of
biofuel
producers
and
their
legislative
backers
oil
and
agriculture
groups
said
the
outcome
is
crucial
we
are
going
to
ask
and
we
expect
to
see
lower
volumes
across
the
board
derrick
morgan
a
lobbyist
for
the
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
said
in
a
phone
interview
he
said
the
ethanol
targets
currently
at
billion
gallons
a
year
should
be
more
fluid
and
based
on
expected
gasoline
demand
the
ethanol
target
should
be
closer
to
billion
gallons
he
said
which
is
percent
of
the
government
s
gasoline
demand
projection
biofuel
backers
say
the
program
should
retain
loftier
targets
in
its
final
years
to
encourage
companies
to
keep
investing
in
new
plants
and
technology
our
goal
is
simple
to
keep
moving
the
rfs
forward
not
backward
