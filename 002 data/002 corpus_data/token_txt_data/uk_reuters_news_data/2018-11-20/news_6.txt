for

the

bakken
crude
has
traded
around
a
per
barrel
discount
to
crude

this
week
in

as
production
topped
the
region
s

takeaway
capacity
hitting
a

the

kept

trading
cheaper
lls

premium
to
crude
was
per

compared
to
to
per

for

the
spread
between
coastal
bakken
and
lls
is
expected
to
narrow
to
or
below
in

month
market
participants
said
lls

a

barrel
and
refineries
are
less
inclined
to
take
blends
especially
if
there

said
explaining
why
the

will
narrow
rising

helped
launch
a

nederland
pricing
agency
argus
estimated
bakken
crude
makes
up
about
bpd
of
the
nation
s
million
bpd
of

the
influx
of
bakken
crude
may
not
be
enough
to
weigh
on
prices
for
west
texas
intermediate
at
east
houston
because
the

commands
a
larger
more
