philippine senators ask duterte to disclose china energy plan
manila
reuters
philippine
opposition
senators
have
demanded
president
rodrigo
duterte
reveal
details
of
joint
energy
exploration
plans
with
china
warning
such
a
deal
risked
affirming
chinese
territorial
claims
that
are
not
recognised
under
international
law
early
this
year
the
two
countries
set
up
a
joint
panel
to
work
out
how
to
explore
offshore
oil
and
gas
in
areas
that
both
claim
without
addressing
the
explosive
issue
of
who
has
the
sovereign
rights
to
them
signing
the
chinese
deal
will
make
the
philippines
recognise
an
unlawful
with
china
the
minority
senators
said
in
a
resolution
on
the
eve
of
tuesday
s
visit
to
manila
by
chinese
president
xi
jinping
the
philippines
which
relies
heavily
on
energy
imports
is
racing
against
time
to
develop
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
the
south
china
sea
but
to
do
that
needs
foreign
help
which
china
has
offered
though
they
intend
to
undertake
some
projects
in
waters
that
are
not
subject
to
competing
claims
there
are
concerns
among
philippine
lawyers
and
diplomats
about
teaming
up
in
areas
that
both
countries
claim
in
particular
the
reed
bank
about
miles
km
off
the
philippines
palawan
island
a
ruling
by
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
in
a
case
filed
by
manila
clarified
among
other
issues
that
the
philippines
had
sovereign
rights
to
exploit
energy
reserves
at
the
reed
bank
it
also
invalidated
china
s
line
claim
to
most
of
the
south
china
sea
which
the
senate
resolution
said
was
unlawful
and
expansive
china
refuses
to
recognise
the
hague
tribunal
s
ruling
the
idea
of
joint
development
was
first
hatched
in
but
disputes
and
the
complexities
of
the
sovereignty
issue
have
held
up
the
plans
the
senators
said
any
agreement
with
china
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
an
impeachable
offence
presidential
spokesman
salvador
panelo
said
any
joint
agreement
would
be
constitutional
adding
that
it
was
too
early
to
discuss
senate
scrutiny
any
demand
for
a
release
of
documents
is
premature
and
could
be
prejudicial
to
our
country
s
interests
given
that
parties
have
yet
to
ink
any
agreement
