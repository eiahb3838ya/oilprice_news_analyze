worries
of
a
peak
in
corporate
earnings
growth
amid
rising
borrowing
costs
slowing
global
economic
momentum
and
international
trade
tensions
triggered
a
shakeout
in
stocks
over
the
past
two
months
with
trillions
of
dollars
worth
of
equity
losses
in
a
particularly
torrid
october
month
in
currencies
the
dollar
struggled
at
a
near
low
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
greenback
was
hit
after

released
on

showed
home
builder
sentiment
recorded
its
steepest
drop
in
over
years
in
november
the
dollar
had
also
been
weighed
down
after
fed
vice
chair
richard
clarida
and
dallas
fed
president
robert
kaplan
late
last
week
raised
concerns
over
a
potential
global
slowdown
the
currency
has
rallied
strongly
this
year
buoyed
by
three
fed
rate
hikes
and
a
robust
economy
though
some
expect
the
bull
run
may
be
nearing
an
end
with
treasury
yields
slipping
to
a
low
of
percent
in
the
wake
of
weaker
stocks
and
housing
data
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
hovered
near
an
low
plumbed
on
monday
the
euro
was
little
changed
at
after
gaining
percent
overnight
the
dollar
slipped
to
a
low
of
yen
and
last
traded
at
crude
futures
gained
percent
to
adding
to
the
previous
day
s
gains
supported
by
a
reported
drawdown
of

inventories
potential
