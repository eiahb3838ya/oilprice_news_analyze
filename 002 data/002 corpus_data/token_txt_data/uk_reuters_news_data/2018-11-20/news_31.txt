the

illustrates
the
dominance
the
south
korean
yards
have
achieved
over
their
competitors
especially
in
japan
it
is
also
sign
of
how
the
companies
have
rebounded
from
a
slump
only
two
years
ago
and
how
they
are
positioned
to
command
the
sector
in
the
future
the
demand
for

surged
followed
by
increased
global

of

said

there
is
a
bright
outlook
ahead
for

at
a
combined

of
over
billion
the
new

will
increase
the
global
lng
fleet
by
around
percent
dominating
this
segment
is
key
for
shipyards
as
gas
consumption
outgrows
that
of
other
fuels
such
as
oil
or
coal
the
south
korean
shipbuilders
have
outperformed
their
japanese
competitors
this
year
with
the
equities
for
all
three
korean
firms
rising
while
the
japanese
builders
are
either
flat
or
down
with

in

this

are
worth
about

this

have
made
up
over
half

dsme

helping
it
recover
from
a
near
collapse
in

its

were
suspended
amid
one
of
the
deepest

downturns
on

an
official
at

did
not
wish

said

conditions
are
improving
and
the
firm
has
received

this

around

book
hyundai

its

and
the
rest
made
in

south

comes
from

according
a
ship
broker
in

and
a
european
shipping
manager
further
cementing
south
korea
s
grip
the
lng
industry
has
shifted
away
from
the
moss
tanker
design
identified
by
the
four
or
five
spherical
tanks
holding
the
fuel
and
named
for
the
company
that
designed
them
in
instead
customers
are
demanding
vessels
that
leave
less
dead
space
within
the
ship
s
hull
this
efficiency
allows
a
vessel
the
largest
class
of
membrane
carrier
to
load
up
to
cubic
metres
of
lng
versus
cubic
metres
on
the
biggest
tanker
ship
designs
are
changing
said
park
an
analyst
at
hana
financial
investment
in
seoul
with
customers
preferring
the
membrane
tankers
china
and
japan
are
not
well
responding
to
the
change
and
this
led
to
no
orders
there
and
that
s
why
european
shipowners
are
placing
orders
to
south
koreans
he
added
braemar
estimates
percent
of
the
global
lng
tanker
fleet
is
made
up
of
membrane
carriers
versus
percent
moss
tankers
and
percent
using
other
systems
this
year
large

using
the

according
to
braemar
a
spokesman
for
japan
s
mitsubishi
shipbuilding
confirmed
it
has
won
no

carrier
orders
since
a
spokesman
at
kawasaki
heavy
industries
said
the
same
japan
marine
united
last
won
an
order
in
japan
contends
however
that
south
korea
began
unfairly
supporting
the
shipyards
during
the
downturn
when
the
south
korean
government
paid
out
subsidies
and
gave
credit
to
keep
the
companies
alive
and
their
hundreds
of
thousands
of

employed
the
country
plans
to

a

s
nikkei
paper
reported
this
month
whoever
dominates
this
market
is
set
to
reap
large
benefits
global
lng
demand
is
surging
from
new
users
in
emerging
markets
and
because
of
a
huge
gasification
program
in
china
the
fuel
is
set
to
become
important
for
marine
transport
as
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
require
shippers
to
use
cleaner
fuels
from
the
rising
thirst
is
being
met
by
new
production
projects
especially
in
north
america
and
australia
which
will
require
more
ships
to
transport
lng
to
its
customers
korea
s
shippers
are
confident
they
will
be
the
ones
to
ship
most
of
this
gas
i
see
the
current
cycle
lasting
for
at
least
years
and
south
korea
is
expected
to
keep
dominating
the
lng
market
rival
countries
can
t
catch
up

short
term
