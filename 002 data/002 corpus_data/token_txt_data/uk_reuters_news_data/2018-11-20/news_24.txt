washington
reuters
the
united
states
is
considering
adding
venezuela
to
its
list
of
state
sponsors
of
terrorism
but
no
final
decision
has
been
made
a
person
familiar
with
the
deliberations
said
on
monday
adding
venezuela
to
the
list
could
limit
economic
assistance
and
impose
financial
restrictions
on
a
country
already
suffering
from
hyperinflation
mass
migration
and
shortages
of
food
and
medicine
discussions
on
the
issue
have
moved
forward
in
recent
days
with
strong
lobbying
from
republican
senator
marco
rubio
who
has
long
pressed
the
administration
to
take
a
tougher
stand
against
the
government
of
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
the
source
said
a
time
frame
for
a
decision
on
whether
to
add
venezuela
to
the
terrorism
list
had
not
yet
been
determined
the
source
said
a
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
it
would
be
a
challenge
for
the
trump
administration
to
provide
concrete
proof
linking
the
maduro
government
to
terrorism
if
it
decides
to
put
venezuela
on
the
list
the
four
countries
currently
on
the
list
north
korea
iran
sudan
and
syria
have
been
found
to
have
repeatedly
provided
support
for
acts
of
international
rubio
and
two
other
republican
senators
sent
a
letter
to
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
in
september
urging
him
to
name
venezuela
a
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
and
accusing
it
of
links
to
lebanon
s
hezbollah
militant
group
and
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
or
farc
but
they
offered
no
proof
the
trump
administration
has
levied
several
rounds
of
sanctions
against
maduro
s
government
since
accusing
it
of
undermining
democracy
on
president
donald
trump
signed
an
executive
order
aimed
a
disrupting
venezuela
s
gold
exports
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
maduro
who
denies
limiting
political
freedoms
has
said
he
is
the
victim
of
an
economic
war
led
by
the
united
states
the
washington
post
which
first
reported
that
the
trump
administration
was
considering
the
designation
said
the
state
department
had
been
asking
for
feedback
on
the
proposed
move
from
various
agencies
in
recent
days
a
state
department
spokesperson
said
it
consistently
and
on
an
ongoing
basis
reviews
available
information
and
intelligence
from
many
sources
on
possible
involvement
in
terrorism
evaluating
all
credible
verified
and
corroborated
information
in
its
the
white
house
declined
to
comment
a
senior
official
told
reuters
earlier
this
month
that
the
trump
administration
was
looking
at
all
potential
avenues
to
pressure
maduro
s
government
we
believe
his
presidency
to
be
illegitimate
the
official
said
reiterating
washington
s
rejection
of
the
outcome
of
venezuela
s
elections
earlier
this
year
maduro
won
a
new
term
in
may
but
his
main
rivals
disavowed
the
election
and
alleged
massive
irregularities
the
regime
really
understands
that
the
world
is
getting
smaller
for
them
and
that
s
the
kind
of
pressure
that
is
needed
to
really
change
minds
in
the
regime
the
sanctions
are
having
an
effect
