for

prompted
a

selloff
across

the

of

carlos
ghosn
pulled
nissan
and
renault
sharply

was
arrested
in

this

global
stock
markets
have
suffered
a
sharp
shakeout
in
the
past
two
months
pressured
by
worries
of
a
peak
in
corporate
earnings
growth
rising
borrowing
costs
slowing
global
economic
momentum
and
international
trade
tensions
trillions
of
dollars
were
wiped
off
equities

a
particularly
torrid
october
month

the
dollar
struggled
at
a
near
low
against
a
basket
of

on

showed
home

sentiment
recorded
its
steepest
drop
in
over
years
in

the
dollar
had
also
been
weighed
down
after
fed
vice
chair
richard
clarida
and
dallas
fed
president
robert
kaplan
raised
concerns
late
last
week
about
a
possible
global
slowdown
the
currency
has
rallied
strongly
this
year
buoyed
by
three
fed
rate
increases
and
a
robust
economy
though
some
expect
the
bull
run
may
be
nearing
an
end
oil
prices
lost
steam
as
fears
about
slower
global
demand
and
a
surge
in
production
outweighed
