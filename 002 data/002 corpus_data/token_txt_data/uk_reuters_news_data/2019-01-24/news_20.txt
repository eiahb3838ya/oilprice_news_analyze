agency
issued
million
in
civil
penalties
to
polluters
last
year
the
lowest
level
in
at
least
two
decades
when
adjusted
for
inflation
according
to
an
analysis
of
agency
data
environmental
advocates
called
the
level
of
fines
a
symptom
of
the
trump
administration
s
agenda
the
epa
rejected
that
assertion
and
said
it
was
using
all
the
tools
at
its
disposal
to
deter
pollution
the
analysis
conducted
by
president
barack
obama
s
former
epa
assistant
administrator
cynthia
giles
and
first
reported
by
the

post
showed
civil
fines
for
polluters
during
at
million
the
lowest
level

at
least
over
the
previous
years
epa
had
issued
a
wide
range
of
fine
totals
ranging
from
a
low
of
million
in
to
over
billion
during
obama
s
final
year
in
office
a
massive
outlier
because
of
a
settlement
the
epa
finalized
with
bp
over
its
oil
spill
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
median
level
of
the
epa
s
annual
fines
during
that
period
was
about
million
according
to
the
data
which
giles
shared
with
reuters
on
thursday
the
environmental
integrity
project
an
advocacy
group
blasted
the
epa
s
performance
on
enforcement
under
republican
president
donald
trump
saying
it
reflected
the
administration
s
and
agenda
trump
was
elected
partly
on
a
promise
to
revive
the
coal
industry
and
boost
oil
and
gas
drilling
and
he
has
been
working
to
undo
environmental
protections
president
trump
promised
to
reduce
epa
to
little
tidbits
during
his
campaign
so
it
should
be
no
surprise
to
see
enforcement
of
environmental
laws
he
s
never
liked
decline
on
his
watch
eric
schaeffer
executive
director
of
the
environmental
integrity
project
and
a
former
director
of
civil
enforcement
at
the
epa
the
epa
said
it
was
not
giving
polluters
any
breaks
and
cited
a
recent
million
settlement
with
fiat
chrysler
over
emissions
violations
let
there
be
no
mistake
epa
enforcement
will
continue
to
correct
using
all
the
tools
at
its
disposal
including
imposing
civil
penalties
to
maintain
a
level
playing
field
and
deter
future
misconduct
