seeking

told

in
an
interview
the

will
package

of

with
a
concession
to
run
a
major
section
of
a
key
northern
route
for
shipping
brazilian
grains
a
ministry
spokesman
said
later
on
tuesday
the
section
of
the
up
for
privatization
will
connect
with
the
river
port
of
miritituba
in
northern
state
of
para
the
spokesman
said
president
jair
bolsonaro
s
government
is
seeking
to
overhaul
brazil
s
poor
transportation
infrastructure
which
raises
costs
and
causes
delays
for
the
powerhouse
by
seeking
private
investors
to
operate
dozens
of
road
rail
and
airport
projects
on
monday
government
secretary
adalberto
vasconcelos
who
has
been
tasked
with
creating
infrastructure
partnerships
said
the
country
would
privatize
more
airports
and
secure
new
investment
for
railways
for
roadways
five
concessions
are
slated
for
auction
this
year
with
a
long
pipeline
of
projects
to
follow
according
to
freitas
in
the
state
of
minas
gerais
sometimes
called
the
road
of
death
because
its
poor
condition
has
contributed
to
lethal
accidents
will
also
be
put
on
the
privatization
list
next
month
he
said
the
highway
officially
known
as
was
inaugurated
in
the
under
brazil
s
military
dictatorship
but
only
a
fraction
of
its
nearly
kilometers
were
paved
and
much
of
the
existing
roadway
has
fallen
into
disrepair
it
stretches
from
the
coastal
state
of
paraiba
deep
into
amazonas
state
original
plans
for
it
to
reach
the
border
with
peru
were
never
completed
nevertheless
research
by
brazil
s
space
agency
and
academics
has
linked
the
road
to
a
rise
in
deforestation
and
road
improvements
allowing
easier
access
deep
into
the
amazon
have
consistently
led
to
increased
deforestation
nearby
he
said
that
major
construction
firms
that
were
implicated
in
corruption
schemes
remain
unable
to
participate
in
public
auctions
for
infrastructure
projects
but
could
act
as
subcontractors
for
winners
of
concession
auctions
engineering
conglomerates
odebrecht
sa
and
andrade
gutierrez
sa
both
implicated
in
corruption
schemes
to
fix
contracts
signed
leniency
deals
with
the
government
admitting
guilt
and
agreeing
to
cooperate
which
allows
them
to
contest
government
contracts
companies
linked
to
corruption
but
without
such
leniency
deals
may
be
subject
to
legal
challenges
they
are
companies
that
have
companies
with
engineering
ability
companies
that
can
provide
good
services
