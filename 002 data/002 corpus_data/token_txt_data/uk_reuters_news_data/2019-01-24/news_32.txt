south
africa
s
eskom
could
be
split
into
three
separate
firms
under
proposals
from
experts
president
cyril
ramaphosa
has
hired
to
help
revive
the
ailing
state
power
company
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
reforming
eskom
is
vital
to
get
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
firing
on
all
cylinders
it
supplies
more
than
percent
of
the
nation
s
power
but
is
drowning
in
debt
a
sustainability
task
team
picked
by
ramaphosa
is
due
to
report
to
the
president
next
week
but
shared
its
preliminary
thoughts
about
eskom
with
senior
members
of
the
ruling
african
national
congress
anc
at
a
meeting
that
ended
on
monday
one
senior
anc
source
briefed
by
the
task
team
said
it
proposed
a
functional
unbundling
of
eskom
which
would
involve
separating
it
into
three
entities
responsible
for
power
generation
distribution
and
transmission
a
second
source
who
met
the
task
team
recently
confirmed
it
favoured
splitting
up
eskom
a
strategy
which
analysts
say
should
encourage
greater
efficiency
and
transparency
ramaphosa
s
task
team
also
told
senior
anc
members
that
eskom
which
has
around
billion
rand
billion
of
debt
and
is
regularly
cited
as
the
biggest
threat
to
the
country
s
public
finances
needed
another
government
bailout
to
survive
said
the
senior
source
who
asked
not
to
be
named
the
anc
recognises
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
serious
turnaround
strategy
for
eskom
but
it
feels
very
strongly
that
it
should
not
lead
to
privatisation
or
massive
job
losses
the
senior
source
said
eskom
s
debt
pile
was
built
up
due
to
heavy
staffing
stagnating
power
sales
and
rising
coal
costs
that
it
has
not
been
able
to
pass
on
to
customers
analysts
say
cost
overruns
on
building
two
major
power
plants
have
also
hit
its
finances
traders
said
leaks
about
the
task
team
s
proposals
which
were
also
reported
in
south
africa
s
business
day
newspaper
pushed
eskom
bonds
higher
on
thursday
with
the
and
bonds
hovering
near
highs
ramaphosa
has
made
shoring
up
ailing
state
firms
like
eskom
a
priority
since
replacing
jacob
zuma
as
president
in
february
but
progress
has
been
slow
because
of
severe
fiscal
constraints
he
also
has
to
deal
with
divisions
in
the
anc
over
how
to
manage
the
economy
and
trade
unions
which
want
to
avoid
layoffs
ramaphosa
rejected
a
proposal
by
eskom
s
board
of
directors
last
year
for
the
government
to
take
billion
rand
of
the
utility
s
debt
saying
other
options
needed
to
be
looked
at
he
told
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
this
week
that
his
government
would
release
eskom
s
turnaround
plan
in
the
next
few
weeks
the
task
team
s
members
have
agreed
not
to
disclose
their
recommendations
publicly
and
ramaphosa
could
choose
to
ignore
their
ideas
but
analysts
say
action
is
needed
as
creditors
are
reluctant
to
lend
more
to
eskom
without
a
credible
rescue
plan
eskom
spokesman
khulu
phasiwe
said
he
could
not
comment
on
the
task
team
s
proposals
the
presidency
will
make
formal
pronouncements
on
this
matter
he
