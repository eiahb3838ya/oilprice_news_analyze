republicans at u.s. nuclear regulator pass stripped down safety rule
washington
jan
reuters
republicans
on
the
nuclear
power
regulator
approved
a
stripped
down
safety
rule
on
thursday
that
removes
the
need
for
nuclear
plants
to
take
extra
measures
based
on
recent
science
to
protect
against
hazards
such
as
floods
and
earthquakes
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
a
board
of
three
republicans
and
two
democrats
approved
the
rule
on
a
vote
along
party
lines
dissents
are
rare
on
the
nrc
and
the
two
democrats
strongly
disagreed
with
the
approval
they
said
the
republican
decision
could
allow
plants
to
avoid
protections
against
risks
of
natural
disasters
that
have
become
apparent
with
science
methods
that
have
evolved
since
most
plants
were
built
about
years
ago
a
draft
rule
that
included
the
measures
was
formed
in
the
wake
of
the
nuclear
disaster
at
japan
s
fukushima
daiichi
plant
that
was
damaged
by
an
earthquake
and
tsunami
which
forced
more
than
people
from
their
homes
the
draft
was
presented
to
the
commission
in
commissioner
jeff
baran
a
democrat
said
nrc
staff
had
included
the
extra
safety
measures
in
the
draft
after
years
of
work
but
republicans
had
jettisoned
them
instead
of
requiring
nuclear
power
plants
to
be
prepared
for
the
actual
flooding
and
earthquake
hazards
that
could
occur
at
their
sites
the
nrc
will
allow
them
to
be
prepared
only
for
the
old
hazards
typically
calculated
decades
ago
when
the
science
of
seismology
and
hydrology
was
far
less
advanced
than
it
is
nrc
chairman
kristine
svinicki
a
republican
said
after
the
vote
that
the
commission
s
work
since
has
resulted
in
tangible
safety
improvements
at
every
nuclear
power
svinicki
said
that
although
the
democrats
were
concerned
that
the
rule
ignores
flooding
and
earthquake
hazards
in
the
view
of
the
commission
majority
this
is
not
the
regulations
already
in
place
already
address
the
issues
she
added
a
nuclear
power
safety
advocate
said
new
information
showed
that
plants
may
experience
bigger
floods
and
earthquakes
than
they
are
now
required
to
withstand
and
that
it
is
possible
the
commission
will
not
require
nuclear
plants
that
face
greater
hazards
to
make
upgrades
nuclear
plants
must
be
protected
against
the
most
severe
natural
disasters
they
could
face
today
not
those
estimated
years
ago
when
many
plants
were
built
