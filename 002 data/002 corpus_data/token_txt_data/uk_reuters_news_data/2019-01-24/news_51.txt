if
you
somehow
missed
the
news
about
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
by
saudi
agents
and
the
global
outcry
that
ensued
you
might
think
saudi
arabia
is
the
darling
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
the
kingdom
has
sent
one
of
its
strongest
delegations
ever
to
the
swiss
mountain
resort
and
packed
its
top
executives
agendas
with
meetings
with
international
peers
it
has
even
managed
to
secure
top
western
businessmen
for
a
panel
debate
on
next
steps
for
saudi
arabia
where
french
oil
major
total
s
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
and
morgan
stanley
s
boss
james
gorman
will
be
sitting
next
to
the
saudi
finance
and
economy
ministers
the
davos
gathering
in
the
swiss
alps
is
a
chance
for
the
saudis
to
try
to
put
behind
them
months
of
intense
criticism
over
the
murder
of
khashoggi
a
critic
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
inside
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
his
killing
by
a
team
of
saudi
operatives
provoked
widespread
revulsion
and
tarnished
the
image
of
the
crown
prince
previously
admired
in
the
west
for
pushing
deep
changes
including
tax
reform
infrastructure
projects
and
allowing
women
to
drive
at
davos
the
signs
are
that
the
damage
control
is
working
swiss
president
ueli
maurer
said
on
wednesday
his
country
has
moved
on
and
wanted
to
build
strong
relations
with
riyadh
a
rich
kingdom
that
is
itself
a
major
global
investor
we
have
long
since
dealt
with
the
khashoggi
case
we
have
agreed
to
continue
the
financial
dialogue
and
normalise
relations
again
maurer
told
swiss
news
agency
sda
western
allies
including
some
politicians
have
called
on
riyadh
to
hold
those
responsible
for
the
khashoggi
murder
accountable
the
saudi
public
prosecutor
is
seeking
the
death
penalty
for
five
suspects
as
the
kingdom
tries
to
contain
its
biggest
political
crisis
for
a
generation
so
there
had
been
doubts
about
saudi
arabia
s
status
at
davos
after
all
a
number
of
global
investors
stayed
away
from
the
crown
prince
s
annual
future
investment
initiative
conference
in
october
overshadowed
by
the
saudi
journalist
s
death
then
at
a
summit
of
the
big
economies
in
buenos
aires
leaders
appeared
to
ignore
prince
mohammed
on
stage
during
the
family
photo
even
if
many
went
on
to
have
bilateral
meetings
with
him
afterwards
but
at
davos
the
saudi
delegation
had
dozens
of
meetings
and
no
western
investor
pulled
out
saudi
economy
minister
mohammad
al
tuwaijri
told

on
wednesday
on
a
basis
in
saudi
arabia
it
is
business
as
usual
our
job
as
government
is
to
make
sure
infrastructure
legal
in
particular
is
stable
this
transformation
journey
hopefully
will
attract
investors
tuwaijri
said
he
said
the
probe
into
the
killing
needed
time
the
message
he
would
take
back
to
the
crown
prince
was
to
listen
to
the
investors
feedback
finance
minister
mohammed
told
cnbc
it
was
very
unfortunate
what
happened
to
jamal
but
also
suggested
to
wait
for
the
probe
s
results
and
the
trial
he
also
said
the
fact
that
a
billion
saudi
bond
was
heavily
oversubscribed
earlier
this
month
showed
investors
were
regaining
confidence
latest
saudi

the
killing
of
his
lawyer
known
