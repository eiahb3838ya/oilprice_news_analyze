analysis-with fees and laws, india rushes to save vanishing groundwater

indian
authorities
are
imposing
a
new
fee
and
stricter
laws
to
rein
in
groundwater
use
as
the
world
s
biggest
extractor
struggles
to
find
ways
to
conserve
the
fast
dwindling
resource
the
water
conservation
fee
for
use
for
drinking
and
domestic
and
commercial
purposes
is
due
to
take
effect
from
june
even
as
several
states
tighten
laws
around
extraction
but
conservationists
and
campaigners
say
these
efforts
will
fail
unless
the
government
also
separates
water
rights
from
land
ownership
and
empowers
communities
to
manage
and
use
groundwater
and
recharge
aquifers
the
approach
so
far
has
been
this
is
my
land
so
the
water
below
it
is
mine
and
i
can
use
as
much
of
it
as
i
want
said
himanshu
kulkarni
of
the
advanced
center
for
water
resources
development
and
management
an
advocacy
group
but
we
need
to
think
of
groundwater
as
a
common
pool
resource
and
look
at
it
from
a
rights
perspective
he
said
india
is
the
world
s
largest
user
of
groundwater
drawing
about
cubic
kilometres
per
year
or
more
than
a
fourth
of
the
global
total
according
to
the
world
bank
more
than
percent
of
the
country
s
irrigated
agriculture
and
percent
of
drinking
water
supplies
are
dependent
on
groundwater
the
world
bank
estimates
with
a
growing
population
rising
demand
from
agriculture
and
industry
and
increasingly
erratic
monsoon
rains
india
is
suffering
the
worst
water
crisis
in
its
history
according
to
government
niti
aayog
about
million
people
nearly
half
india
s
population
face
acute
water
shortage
with
close
to
dying
each
year
from
polluted
water
niti
aayog
said
in
a
report
last
year
a
draft
groundwater
bill
proposed
a
new
regulatory
framework
that
recognised
the
fundamental
right
to
water
the
need
for
decentralised
control
and
protection
of
aquifers
and
sought
to
give
control
to
local
users
but
the
legislation
was
not
passed
by
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
government
and
with
national
elections
due
by
may
it
has
been
relegated
to
the
backburner
availability
of
water
is
an
issue
everywhere
but
water
management
which
should
be
a
raging
election
issue
is
not
because
we
don
t
pay
a
meaningful
price
for
it
said
mridula
ramesh
founder
of
the
sundaram
climate
institute
in
madurai
the
water
conservation
fee
is
a
necessary
first
step
she
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
with
its
dependence
on
seasonal
rainfall
india
has
long
managed
water
with
an
elaborate
network
of
canals
tanks
and
wells
water
was
regarded
as
a
communal
resource
that
was
managed
by
the
community
this
approach
changed
with
the
british
who
imposed
a
centralised
system
and
the
common
law
principle
in
the
late
emphasising
the
rights
of
landowners
to
access
water
according
to
kulkarni
the
conflation
of
the
right
to
water
with
property
ownership
led
to
landowners
treating
groundwater
as
a
private
resource
with
no
thought
of
its
conservation
said
kulkarni
who
helped
draft
the
bill
the
green
revolution
launched
by
the
government
in
the
to
increase
food
production
led
to
the
widespread
use
of
tubewells
which
were
heavily
subsidised
resulting
in
faster
depletion
of
groundwater
for
irrigation
india
has
built
dams
and
plans
to
link
rivers
to
ease
availability
measures
that
are
opposed
by
conservationists
the
country
is
also
entangled
in
disputes
across
the
border
with
its
eastern
and
western
neighbours
bangladesh
and
pakistan
accusing
it
of
monopolising
water
flows
to
the
north
and
northeast
india
fears
a
loss
of
water
to
upstream
china
which
plans
a
series
of
dams
over
the
tsangpo
river
called
the
brahmaputra
as
it
flows
into
eastern
india
a
groundwater
law
was
first
introduced
in
india
in
the
and
about
a
dozen
states
began
introducing
measures
to
control
use
from
the
but
the
legislation
has
failed
to
tackle
falling
water
tables
and
lacks
provisions
to
protect
and
conserve
groundwater
at
the
aquifer
level
said
philippe
cullet
a
professor
of
environmental
law
at
the
university
of
london
s
soas
access
to
a
source
of
groundwater
has
progressively
become
a
source
of
power
and
economic
gain
said
cullet
who
also
helped
draft
the
bill
groundwater
is
essentially
a
local
resource
yet
the
present
framework
remains
mostly
and
is
incapable
of
addressing
local
situations
adequately
he
said
groundwater
reserves
are
under
pressure
worldwide
with
warmer
temperatures
affecting
how
quickly
they
replenish
resulting
in
an
environmental
time
bomb
for
future
generations
according
to
a
study
published
this
week
in
india
the
world
s
populous
country
the
crisis
has
serious
implications
for
food
security
nearly
million
people
are
at
high
risk
of
being
unable
to
rely
on
surface
water
including
in
the
northwest
and
south
where
much
of
india
s
staple
wheat
and
rice
are
grown
according
to
washington
world
resources
institute
some
states
including
maharashtra
are
enacting
tougher
laws
to
regulate
tubewells
prevent
pollution
and
limit
the
type
of
crops
that
can
be
grown
in
areas
the
conservation
fee
will
charge
users
based
on
the
amount
of
water
extracted
in
areas
but
the
fee
exempts
agricultural
users
the
largest
consumers
of
groundwater
and
a
key
voter
base
helping
farmers
manage
water
can
help
limit
crop
failures
from
failed
monsoons
said
kulkarni
whose
organisation
helped
establish
pani
panchayat
or
water
village
councils
that
were
popular
in
the
in
these
projects
farmers
delinked
land
and
water
rights
and
collectively
managed
harvesting
and
distributing
surface
water
and
groundwater
individual
wells
were
banned
as
were
crops
such
as
sugarcane
and
bananas
a
similar
project
in
seven
districts
of
nearly
one
million
people
in
andhra
pradesh
state
was
described
by
the
world
bank
as
the
first
global
example
of
success
in
of
groundwater
ensuring
the
rights
of
the
landless
community
participation
equitable
distribution
and
sustainability
of
the
resource
is
key
said
kulkarni
it
is
a
fairer
more
democratic
way
to
manage
water
and
prevents
the
kind
of
conflicts
we
now
