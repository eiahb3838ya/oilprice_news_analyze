the
partial
government
shutdown
is
threatening
to
delay
the
of
new
vehicle
models
in
the
united
states
by
stalling
required
certifications
from
the
environmental
protection
agency
automakers
said
the
shutdown
at
days
the
longest
in
history
has
left
over
federal
agency
workers
without
pay
and
had
an
impact
on
everything
from
access
to
national
parks
to
airline
security
screening
to
the
release
of
economic
data
some
percent
of
epa
staff
has
been
furloughed
including
those
at
the
lab
in
ann
arbor
michigan
responsible
for
verifying
emissions
data
for
new
automotive
models
to
ensure
they
comply
with
clean
air
laws
gm
has
not
yet
had
any
vehicle
launch
delays
but
like
other
automakers
we
are
currently
awaiting
decisions
in
the
certification
process
for
a
few
model

chief

manley
said
at
the

officials
said
some
vehicles
could
be
delayed
if
the
government
shutdown
goes
another
days
as
the
shutdown
continues
these
certification
delays
will
affect
vehicle
production
consumers
will
also
not

automakers
told
reuters
the
epa
declined
to
comment
former
acting
administrator
of
the
epa
stanley
meiburg
noted
the
agency
s
certification
process
was
central
to
discovering
volkswagen
s
past
efforts
to
cheat
on
emissions
automakers
tend
to
seek
certifications
well
in
advance
of
releasing
them
to
the
market
meaning
a
delayed
certification
does
not
always
impact
the
schedule
but
the
issue
could
become
more
serious
if
the
shutdown
lingers
for
much
longer
meiburg
said
any
disruptions
to
this
part
of
the
process
will
disrupt
the
entire
supply
chain
he
said
republican
president
donald
trump
has
refused
to
sign
any
legislation
to
fund
an
array
of
government
agencies
unless
it
includes
billion
billion
for
his
proposed
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
democrats
argue
that
a
wall
is
costly
and
there
are
better
ways
to
shore
up
national
security
and
curb
