if
you
somehow
missed
the
news
about
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
by
saudi
agents
and
the
global
outcry
that
ensued
you
might
think
saudi
arabia
is
the
darling
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
the
kingdom
has
sent
one
of
its
strongest
delegations
ever
to
the
swiss
mountain
resort
and
packed
its
top
executives
agendas
with
meetings
with
international
peers
it
has
managed
to
secure
top
western
businessmen
for
a
panel
debate
on
next
steps
for
saudi
arabia
where
french
oil
major
total
s
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
and
morgan
stanley
s
boss
james
gorman
spoke
alongside
the
saudi
finance
and
economy
ministers
the
davos
gathering
in
the
swiss
alps
is
a
chance
for
the
saudis
to
try
to
put
behind
them
months
of
intense
criticism
over
the
murder
of
khashoggi
a
critic
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
inside
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
his
killing
by
a
team
of
saudi
operatives
provoked
widespread
revulsion
and
tarnished
the
image
of
the
crown
prince
previously
admired
in
the
west
for
pushing
deep
changes
including
tax
reform
infrastructure
projects
and
allowing
women
to
drive
at
davos
the
signs
are
that
the
damage
control
is
working
swiss
president
ueli
maurer
said
on
wednesday
his
country
has
moved
on
and
wanted
to
build
strong
relations
with
riyadh
a
rich
kingdom
that
is
itself
a
major
global
investor
we
have
long
since
dealt
with
the
khashoggi
case
we
have
agreed
to
continue
the
financial
dialogue
and
normalize
relations
again
maurer
told
swiss
news
agency
sda
western
allies
including
some
politicians
have
called
on
riyadh
to
hold
those
responsible
for
the
khashoggi
murder
accountable
the
saudi
public
prosecutor
is
seeking
the
death
penalty
for
five
suspects
as
the
kingdom
tries
to
contain
its
biggest
political
crisis
for
a
generation
so
there
had
been
doubts
about
saudi
arabia
s
status
at
davos
after
all
a
number
of
global
investors
stayed
away
from
the
crown
prince
s
annual
future
investment
initiative
conference
in
october
overshadowed
by
the
saudi
journalist
s
death
then
at
a
summit
of
the
big
economies
in
buenos
aires
leaders
appeared
to
ignore
prince
mohammed
on
stage
during
the
family
photo
even
if
many
went
on
to
have
bilateral
meetings
with
him
afterwards
but
at
davos
the
saudi
delegation
had
dozens
of
meetings
and
no
western
investor
pulled
out
saudi
economy
minister
mohammad
al
tuwaijri
told
reuters
on
wednesday
on
a
basis
in
saudi
arabia
it
is
business
as
usual
our
job
as
government
is
to
make
sure
infrastructure
legal
in
particular
is
stable
this
transformation
journey
hopefully
will
attract
investors
tuwaijri
said
he
said
the
probe
into
the
killing
needed
time
the
message
he
would
take
back
to
the
crown
prince
was
to
listen
to
the
investors
feedback
finance
minister
mohammed
said
it
was
absolutely
sad
what
happened
to
jamal
khashoggi
but
also
suggested
to
wait
for
the
probe
s
results
and
the
trial
he
also
said
the
fact
that
a
billion
saudi
bond
was
heavily
oversubscribed
earlier
this
month
showed
investors
were
regaining
confidence
mohammed
el
kuwaiz
chairman
of
the
saudi
capital
market
authority
said
the
murder
of
khashoggi
caused
investors
to
pull
back
but
only
temporarily
speaking
not
just
as
a
government
employee
but
as
a
saudi
citizen
everyone
in
saudi
has
been
absolutely
horrified
by
what
happened
but
a
country
of
million
people
should
not
be
held
hostage
by
an
event
no
matter
how
heinous
particularly
at
this
point
in
time
when
we
have
been
working
very
hard
to
set
a
new
course
for
the
country

pouyanne
said
he
was
carrying
on
with
a
billion
refining
and
petrochemical
investment
in
saudi
arabia
and
would
also
soon
announce
a
new
venture
for

stations
what
is
the
alternative
for
a
company
like
total
to
boycott
saudi
arabia
we
are
always
against
sanctions

the
normal
people

pouyanne
told
the
panel
morgan
s
gorman
also
said
investors
wanted
clear
light
and
transparency
about
the
murder
which
was
utterly
unacceptable
you
have
to
decide
what
process
you
play
in
a
country
which
has
had
an
incident
versus
the
million
people
who
are
going
through
an
extraordinary
reform

bank
has
been
present
in

arabia

a

successfully
pushed
through
some
of
the
harshest
sanctions
against
russia
for
the
killing
of
his
lawyer
known
as
the
magnitsky
act
said
the
same
sanctions
should
be
applied
to
saudi
arabia
until
mohammed
bin
salman
bears
responsibility
for
this
crime
there
can
not
be
business
as
usual
with
saudi
arabia
