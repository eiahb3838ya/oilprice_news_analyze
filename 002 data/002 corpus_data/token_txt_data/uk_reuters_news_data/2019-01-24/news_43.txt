update 1-vestas launches more versatile wind power platform
copenhagen
reuters
danish
wind
power
company
vestas
presented
a
new
platform
on
thursday
it
says
will
enable
customers
to
produce
cheaper
energy
through
turbines
tailored
for
different
wind
conditions
and
locations
the
move
is
a
response
to
a
more
competitive
industry
that
is
moving
away
from
governments
guaranteeing
utilities
generous
fixed
subsidised
tariffs
for
power
towards
an
system
that
favours
those
who
can
bid
at
the
lowest
price
this
is
a
more
approach
chief
executive
anders
runevad
told
reuters
in
an
interview
there
is
a
different
logic
now
that
we
get
into
an
auction
market
enventus
the
first
new
vestas
platform
since
will
offer
customers
more
flexibility
than
its
existing
megawatt
mw
and
mw
platforms
vestas
said
the
company
is
also
launching
new
mw
and
mw
turbines
to
run
on
the
enventus
platform
new
turbines
will
be
built
from
standardised
modules
that
fit
other
turbines
rather
than
from
parts
that
only
fit
one
platform
that
will
make
manufacturing
servicing
and
upgrading
the
turbines
simpler
vestas
said
vestas
whose
main
rivals
are
general
electric
and
siemens
gamesa
last
month
became
the
first
to
install
gigawatts
of
capacity
globally
the
wind
power
industry
has
been
grappling
with
reduced
subsidies
in
recent
years
and
governments
seeking
more
competitive
contract
tenders
increasing
pressure
on
suppliers
turbine
makers
and
wind
farm
developers
to
reduce
costs
we
ve
gone
from
being
a
niche
industry
dependent
on
subsidy
tariffs
to
an
industry
that
can
compete
on
more
normal
market
conditions
and
that
ripples
through
the
chain
runevad
said
the
enventus
platform
will
lower
the
cost
of
energy
produced
throughout
the
lifespan
of
the
turbine
by
as
much
as
percent
vestas
said
asked
whether
the
platform
would
allow
vestas
to
increase
prices
runevad
said
that
remains
to
be
seen
we
have
to
wait
and
see
what
the
competition
is
vestas
