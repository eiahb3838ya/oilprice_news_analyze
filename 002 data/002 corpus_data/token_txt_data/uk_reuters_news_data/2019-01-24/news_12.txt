reuters
the
global
solar
power
industry
is
about
to
lose
a
major
competitive
windfall
as
prices
of
solar
panels
begin
to
recover
after
a
collapse
last
year
the
leader
of
one
of
the
world
s
top
manufacturers
said
on
thursday
the
party
if
definitely
over
said
eric
luo
president
of
china
s
gcl
system
integration
technology
co
a
maker
of
solar
panels
feeding
the
renewable
power
sector
solar
panel
prices
tumbled
around
percent
last
year
after
china
the
world
s
largest
producer
cut
subsidies
to
shrink
its
bloated
solar
industry
pushing
smaller
manufacturers
to
the
brink
of
collapse
to
raise
cash
and
stay
afloat
manufacturers
cleared
inventory
and
diverted
sales
offshore
sending
prices
into
a
downward
spiral
offering
up
a
windfall
for
solar
power
generators
and
investors
in
solar
farms
luo
speaking
to
reuters
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
the
swiss
ski
resort
of
davos
this
week
said
gcl
s
vertically
integrated
business
model
cushioned
it
from
the
downturn
in
prices
as
its
solar
farms
benefited
from
cheaper
panels
the
pain
will
mostly
be
felt
by
smaller
chinese
producers
which
lack
international
supply
chains
triggering
industry
consolidation
or
forcing
them
to
close
he
added
luo
said
solar
panel
prices
were
already
stabilizing
and
he
expected
them
to
rebound
by
to
percent
as
the
chinese
industry
consolidates
over
the
next
year
or
two
given
panels
represent
close
to
half
of
a
solar
farm
s
installation
costs
that
threatens
to
eat
into
the
returns
of
investors
china
is
home
to
almost
a
third
of
the
world
s
cumulative
installed
solar
capacity
and
its
manufacturers
dominate
the
industry
despite
being
slapped
with
tariffs
and
getting
caught
up
more
recently
in
the
trade
war
in
september
the
european
union
ended
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
chinese
solar
panels
but
washington
continues
to
impose
an
duty
they
are
also
subject
to
president
donald
trump
s
more
recent
hike
to
general
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
gcl
still
counts
the
united
states
as
a
major
market
but
is
expanding
rapidly
in
other
markets
following
in
the
wake
of
beijing
s
huge
belt
and
road
international
development
program
luo
said
adding
that
overseas
business
would
account
for
percent
of
gcl
s
solar
panel
shipments
this
year
at
home
luo
said
china
was
rapidly
nearing
the
point
where
the
solar
industry
could
operate
without
any
form
of
subsidy
he
said
northwest
china
where
sun
was
more
plentiful
and
land
less
expensive
had
already
reached
that
milestone
most
of
the
rest
of
the
country
would
follow
this
year
before
the
age
of
subsidies
ends
completely
in
he
said
if
you
need
subsidies
at
that
point
