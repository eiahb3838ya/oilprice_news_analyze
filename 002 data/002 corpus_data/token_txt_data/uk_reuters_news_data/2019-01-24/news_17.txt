the
top
importer
of
venezuelan
crude
is
seeking
to
ensure
that
the

revenue
goes
to
opposition

guaido

swore
himself
in

interim

and
to
cut
off
money
from
president
nicolas
maduro
a
top
official
said
on
thursday
the
breakdown
in
diplomatic
relations
was
interpreted
as
upping
the
possibility
of
a
sanction
on
venezuelan
oil
that
would
likely
force
refiners
to
seek
alternative
supplies
at
higher
prices
hence
the

gains
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
and
associates
said
in
a
note
venezuelan
oil
is
predominantly
heavy
crude
which
requires
extensive
refining
it
is
frequently
blended
with
lighter
crudes
to
give
refiners
products
with
iran
already
crippled
by
sanctions
a
drop
in
venezuelan
exports
could
squeeze
global
supply
further

on
its

that
iranian
crude
and
condensate
exports
in
december
fell
steeply
from
november
to
less
than

lower
than
some
other
estimates
both
brent
and
wti
are
both
backed
by
light
sweet
crudes
and
are
not
directly
linked
to
venezuelan
oil
but
concern
about
the
supply
of
heavy
crudes
is
apparent
in
the
physical
market
where
the
price
for
