over

analysts
at

warned
that
china
s
economic
slowdown
looks
set
to
be
of
a
similar
scale
to
that
in
though
there
are
some
significant
differences
so
far
most
notably
less
downward
pressure
on
the

and
no
signs
of
major

outflows
against
a

weakness
in
china
adds
to
reasons
to
expect
a
marked
global
slowdown
they
wrote
in
