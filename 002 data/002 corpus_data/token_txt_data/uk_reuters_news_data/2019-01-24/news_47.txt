invested
in
chinese

to
charging
points
and
helps
power
suppliers
balance
distribution
the
powershare
application
which
is
used
in
cities
such
as
shanghai
will
help
manage
growing
pressure
on
power
grids
as
electric
vehicles
evs
usage
surges
in
the
coming
decades
with
china
targeting
sales
of
more
than
million
evs
by
the
need
to
manage
demand
and
distribution
of
power
on
the
grid
particularly
at
times
of
peak
demand
will
be
crucial
bp
s
investment
is
the
latest
in
a
string
by
the
oil
and
gas
major
and
several
of
its
rivals
including
royal
dutch
shell
and
total
in
ev
charging
as
they
target
future
economies
car
producers
utility
firms
and
energy
companies
have
doubled
down
efforts
in
recent
years
to
find
ways
to
manage
the
expected
surge
in
power
demand
powershare
helps
drivers
locate
charging
points
and
pay
for
the
supply
while
allowing
suppliers
to
optimize
to
balance
demand
on
the
grid
depending
on
the
time
of
day
for
example
between
city
centers
and
residential
areas
as
more
and
more
evs
come
on
grid
operators
are
concerned
about
mobile
demand
powershare
can
monitor
where
vehicles
are
and
where
demand
is
in
the
system

typically
invests
up
to
ten
million
dollars

we
wanted
to
find
a
technology
that
