nuclear, climate threats keep doomsday clock close to apocalypse
reuters
a
renewed
nuclear
arms
race
rising
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
the
emergence
of
disinformation
campaigns
have
left
the
modern
world
as
close
to
annihilation
as
it
was
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
atomic
scientists
said
on
thursday
the
doomsday
clock
created
by
the
bulletin
of
the
atomic
scientists
as
an
indicator
of
the
world
s
susceptibility
to
apocalypse
remained
at
two
minutes
to
midnight
for
a
second
year
running
in
what
the
scientists
called
a
dangerous
new
though
unchanged
from
this
setting
should
be
taken
not
as
a
sign
of
stability
but
as
a
stark
warning
to
leaders
and
citizens
around
the
world
the
group
said
in
a
statement
humanity
s
two
simultaneous
existential
threats
of
nuclear
war
and
climate
change
were
exacerbated
during
the
past
year
by
the
increased
use
of
information
warfare
to
undermine
democracy
around
the
world
the
group
said
in
many
forums
including
particularly
social
media
nationalist
leaders
and
their
surrogates
lied
shamelessly
insisting
that
their
lies
were
truth
and
the
truth
fake
news
it
said
since
the
election
of
president
donald
trump
in
the
clock
has
closed
in
on
midnight
in
successive
moves
in
and
in
part
because
of
escalating
tensions
with
north
korea
over
its
nuclear
program
the
last
time
the
clock
was
as
close
to
midnight
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
two
years
was
in
when
the
arms
race
escalated
as
moscow
tested
a
hydrogen
bomb
in
august
after
the
detonation
of
an
american
the
previous
november
despite
a
softening
of
barbed
rhetoric
between
trump
and
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
over
the
past
year
the
group
saw
rising
threats
in
nations
programs
of
nuclear
modernization
that
are
all
but
indistinguishable
from
a
worldwide
arms
on
climate
the
group
said
carbon
dioxide
emissions
resumed
an
upward
climb
in
the
past
two
years
to
turn
back
the
clock
it
recommended
steps
including
fortifying
and
extending
nuclear
treaties
with
limits
on
modernization
programs
adopting
safeguards
to
prevent
peacetime
military
incidents
along
nato
countries
borders
citizen
demands
for
action
on
climate
change
and
multilateral
talks
to
discourage
the
misuse
of
information
technology
the
bulletin
was
founded
by
scientists
who
helped
develop
the
united
states
first
atomic
weapons
when
the
clock
was
created
in
it
was
set
at
seven
minutes
to
midnight
