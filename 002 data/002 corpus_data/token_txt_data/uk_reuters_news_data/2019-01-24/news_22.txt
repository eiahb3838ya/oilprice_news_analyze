oil
prices
this
year
will
be
influenced
primarily
by
the
health
of
the
global
economy
which
is
why
prices
have
closely
tracked
equity
and
bond
markets
in
recent
months
shale
production
growth
the
policy
of
opec
and
its
allies
sanctions
on
iran
and
the
threat
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
may
all
have
an
impact
on
the
price
of
a
barrel
but
that
impact
will
be
secondary
and
it
is
more
likely
to
be
crude
prices
that
determine
what
happens
with
shale
policy
and
sanctions
chartbook
predict
what
will
happen
to
the
global
economy
and
the
movement
of
oil
prices
in
should
become
clear
weakening
global
expansion
amid
growing
risks
international
monetary
fund
business
sentiment
is
buckling
under
pressure
from
the
deteriorating
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
china
as
well
as
tightening
financial
conditions
in
the
form
of
higher
borrowing
costs
and
falling
equity
prices
the
global
economic
expansion
has
been
losing
momentum
since
the
middle
of
last
year
and
there
are
signs
the
slowdown
has
worsened
in
recent
months
with
risks
skewed
to
the
downside
so
oil
consumption
especially
middle
distillates
such
as
diesel
which
are
closely
linked
to
freight
transportation
and
industrial
activity
is
likely
to
grow
more
slowly
in
lower
crude
prices
and
the
introduction
of
new
pollution
regulations
on
shipping
fuels
will
offset
some
of
the
implied
slowdown
but
consumption
growth
is
still
set
to
slacken
the
extent
of
the
slowdown
depends
on
whether
global
growth
starts
to
accelerate
again
settles
into
an
extended
soft
patch
or
falls
into
an
outright
recession
the
difference
between
each
of
these
three
scenarios
amounts
to
several
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
consumption
growth
dwarfing
all
other
influences
on
oil
prices
in
much
will
depend
on
whether
the
united
states
and
china
can
successfully
their
economic
conflict
and
whether
financial
conditions
including
equity
prices
yield
curves
and
credit
availability
ease
production
of
crude
lease
condensates
and
gas
liquids
surged
by
more
than
million
bpd
in
the
largest
increase
reported
in
any
single
country
in
the
history
of
the
oil
industry
the
frenzied
shale
boom
coupled
with
signs
of
slowing
consumption
growth
and
unexpectedly
generous
sanctions
waivers
on
iran
s
oil
exports
to
push
the
market
towards
a
large
surplus
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
result
has
been
a
sharp
drop
in
prices
which
has
already
prompted
opec
and
especially
its
principal
member
saudi
arabia
to
cut
production
sharply
lower
prices
are
also
expected
to
moderate
the
growth
in
shale
production
this
year
and
next
albeit
after
a
delay
as
the
industry
completes
the
large
number
of
new
wells
started
during
the
boom
the
energy
information
administration
forecasts
growth
in
petroleum
liquids
supply
will
slow
from
million
bpd
in
to
million
bpd
in
and
million
bpd
in
but
the
speed
and
depth
of
any
slowdown
in
shale
production
is
uncertain
and
likely
to
depend
critically
on
what
happens
to
prices
and
thus
the
economy
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
have
announced
plans
to
cut
their
combined
production
by
million
bpd
to
prevent
the
oil
market
from
becoming
oversupplied
the
group
s
early
and
aggressive
production
cuts
appear
to
have
removed
much
of
the
surplus
in
the
oil
market
and
boosted
sentiment
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
have
stopped
selling
futures
and
options
linked
to
brent
crude
and
european
gasoil
and
become
small
buyers
of
both
since
the
start
of
the
year
spot
brent
prices
have
found
a
floor
above
per
barrel
up
from
in
late
december
and
the
structure
of
futures
prices
has
swung
from
contango
to
level
and
even
a
small
backwardation
in
the
higher
spot
prices
and
firmer
calendar
spreads
have
caused
some
opec
policymakers
to
conclude
the
market
rebalancing
process
is
over
but
if
the
global
economy
falls
into
an
extended
soft
patch
or
even
a
recession
opec
and
its
allies
will
probably
have
to
make
further
cuts
to
prevent
a
surplus
likewise
if
shale
production
does
not
slow
as
quickly
as
anticipated
will
come
under
pressure
to
cut
output
further
on
the
other
hand
if
the
economy
grows
strongly
shale
production
slows
sharply
the
resulting
market
tightening
will
encourage
to
unwind
some
of
its
output
restraints
like
the
shale
producers
opec
s
production
policy
will
ultimately
be
contingent
on
the
health
of
the
global
economy
and
the
rate
of
oil
consumption
growth
in
the
united
states
has
pledged
progressively
to
tighten
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
after
the
white
house
decided
to
pull
out
of
the
nuclear
agreement
reached
in
the
first
phase
of
sanctions
has
proved
less
aggressive
than
expected
after
the
united
states
granted
generous
waivers
to
some
of
iran
s
largest
customers
in
asia
the
white
house
seems
to
have
responded
to
concerns
about
the
lack
of
spare
capacity
in
the
oil
market
to
replace
exports
lost
from
iran
and
the
resulting
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
policymakers
have
proved
sensitive
to
the
impact
of
higher
oil
prices
on
fuel
costs
for
motorists
and
the
state
of
the
economy
but
the
initial
waivers
were
granted
for
only
six
months
so
they
will
have
to
be
extended
narrowed
or
terminated
by
may
oil
market
analysts
have
speculated
about
whether
the
next
round
of
waivers
will
be
tougher
or
if
they
will
be
terminated
completely
in
practice
the
last
round
provides
a
for
white
house
decisions
will
be
conditional
on
the
availability
of
spare
capacity
and
prices
which
in
turn
makes
them
dependent
on
the
state
of
the
oil
market
and
the
economy
if
the
global
economy
remains
sluggish
opec
is
still
restricting
output
and
oil
prices
remain
relatively
low
the
white
house
may
take
the
opportunity
to
narrow
the
waivers
or
remove
them
altogether
if
the
global
economy
is
accelerating
opec
is
unwinding
its
production
cuts
and
oil
prices
are
rising
again
the
white
house
is
likely
to
be
less
aggressive
the
same
considerations
apply
to
possible
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
exports
which
are
likely
to
be
contingent
on
the
anticipated
impact
on
prices
and
the
availability
of
replacement
capacity
in
venezuela
s
case
there
is
an
additional
complication
because
there
are
few
alternatives
to
the
country
s
heavy
and
crudes
venezuela
s
heavy
crude
can
not
be
replaced
by
light
shale
production
if
the
united
states
decides
to
impose
primary
secondary
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
exports
alternative
supplies
will
have
to
come
from
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
kuwait
and
iraq
spare
capacity
in
these
countries
may
not
be
enough
to
cover
for
tough
sanctions
on
both
iran
and
venezuela
at
the
same
time
while
leaving
enough
to
absorb
further
shocks
like
everything
else
the
severity
of
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
depends
on
the
state
of
the
oil
market
and
the
economic
outlook
