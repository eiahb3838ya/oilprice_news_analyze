davos-big oil is more talk than action on renewables - iberdrola

reuters
the
world
s
largest
producer
iberdrola
sa
has
brushed
off
big
oil
s
embrace
of
renewable
energy
as
more
noise
than
action
major
oil
and
gas
firms
have
been
venturing
into
renewable
power
under
pressure
from
policy
collectively
spending
around
percent
of
their
budgets
on
clean
energy
according
to
a
recent
study
by
research
firm
cdp
however
iberdrola
chief
executive
ignacio
galan
who
has
led
the
spanish
utility
for
years
shrugged
when
asked
in
a
reuters
interview
if
big
oil
represented
a
competitive
threat
it
s
good
that
they
have
moved
in
this
direction
but
they
make
more
noise
than
the
reality
he
said
on
thursday
on
the
sidelines
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
galan
said
returns
on
oil
investment
still
far
exceeded
those
typical
of
wind
and
solar
projects
and
he
doubted
major
oil
companies
would
make
a
meaningful
shift
until
that
changed
they
like
to
be
enthusiastic
but
if
they
had
to
make
a
choice
between
a
wonderful
oil
well
and
a
good
wind
farm
i
feel
their
heart
will
move
in
the
traditional
galan
also
brushed
off
president
donald
trump
s
policy
shift
in
favour
of
coal
pointing
out
that
iberdrola
would
spend
percent
of
its
billion
euros
billion
investment
budget
in
the
united
states
over
the
next
four
years
the
white
house
is
saying
that
they
would
like
to
promote
coal
but
as
far
as
i
know
no
new
coal
mine
has
been
opened
and
many
have
been
shut
down
galan
said
he
said
states
were
more
influential
than
washington
in
terms
of
energy
investment
and
that
several
were
looking
to
develop
america
s
first
offshore
wind
farms
from
massachusetts
down
to
north
carolina
and
new
york
across
to
california
the
states
are
more
and
more
committed
to
moving
to
renewables
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
cities
and
towns
he
said
adding
that
falling
generation
costs
of
renewable
energy
was
a
big
driver
of
the
adoption
of
wind
and
solar
power
iberdrola
also
continues
to
ramp
up
investment
in
europe
and
in
its
other
priority
emerging
markets
of
mexico
and
brazil
and
is
dipping
its
toes
in
south
africa
where
it
is
looking
to
invest
in
onshore
wind
power
and
solar
galan
said
it
wanted
to
invest
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
in
south
africa
over
the
next
few
years
and
use
it
as
a
gateway
to
africa
but
iberdrola
first
needed
to
iron
out
permit
and
authorisation
issues
with
the
government
there
galan
who
tilted
iberdrola
towards
wind
power
when
most
renewable
energy
was
largely
unviable
without
state
subsidies
said
the
group
had
effectively
reached
its
goal
already
of
shutting
down
all
its
power
generation
the
who
wears
green
ties
and
makes
his
executive
team
do
the
same
said
the
two
remaining
generators
both
in
spain
were
now
mothballed
it
s
done
he
said
those
plants
are
officially
open
but
they
are
not
