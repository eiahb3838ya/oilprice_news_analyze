average

are
set
to
climb
this
year
a
reuters
poll
showed
buoyed
by
slowing

top
producer
indonesia
and
by
robust
demand
for
the
commodity
which
is
used
to
churn
out
products
ranging
from
chocolate
to
biofuels
benchmark
palm
prices
will
average
ringgit
a
tonne
in
up
percent
from
ringgit
last
year
according
to
the
median
estimate
from
a
poll
of
analysts
and
industry
players
including
planters
millers
and
refiners
the
price
outlook
in
should
be
slightly
better
than
in
as
the
trees
need
to
rest
said
an
indonesian
planter
who
estimates
the
country
s
output
will
peak
between
june
and
september
indonesia
s
production
has
been
very
strong
since
and
production
may
take
a
breather
this
the
median
estimate
of
the
poll
respondents
who
answered
questions
specifically
on
indonesia
s
palm
sector
pegged
the
nation
s
production
at
million
tonnes
in
that
would
be
up
slightly
from
the
indonesia
palm

association

estimate
for

would
mark
slower
growth
than
last
year

jump
from
million

in
output
in
producer
malaysia
will
rise
to
million
tonnes
in
based
on
the
median
estimates
of
participants
they
forecast
production
would
peak
between
october
and
november
that
would
be
only
a
marginal
rise
from
million
tonnes
in
which
respondents
said
was
due
to
factors
such
as
the
ageing
of
trees
indonesia
and
malaysia
together
account
for
nearly
percent
of
global
palm
production
growing
demand
for
palm
from
biodiesel
producers
is
expected
to
support
prices
this
year
with
the
indonesian
and
malaysian
governments
pushing
the
use
of
biofuels
indonesia
in
september
required
all
diesel
fuel
used
in
the
country
to
contain
biodiesel
while
malaysia
is
set
to
increase
the
amount
of
biological
ingredients
that
fuel
must
contain
peak
stocks
won
t
mirror
last

s
highs
due
to
better
export
demand
higher
domestic
consumption
for
biodiesel
and
lower
production
said
the
planter
in
indonesia
survey
respondents
expect
demand
in
key
export
markets
to
rise
this
year
largely
driven
by
india
where
import
duties
have
been
cut
india
reduced
import
taxes
at
the
start
of
the
year
though
the
rates
are
still
higher
than
before
an
initial
hike
from
last
march
however
downward
pressure
on
prices
for
rival
oilseed
soybeans
amid
the
trade
war
could
also
drag
on
palm
markets

of

respondents
