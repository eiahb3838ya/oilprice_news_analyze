britain
supports
venezuela
s
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
head
of
the
democratically
elected
national
assembly
a
spokesman
for
prime
minister
theresa

said
on
thursday
adding
that
a
presidential
poll
was
neither
free
nor
fair
guaido
declared
himself
interim
president
on
wednesday
winning
backing
from
washington
and
parts
of
latin
america
and
prompting
socialist
nicolas
maduro
venezuela
s
leader
since
to
break
relations
with
the
united
states
the
presidential
election
in
venezuela
was
neither
free
nor
fair
so
the
regime
s
basis
for
power
is
deeply
flawed
we
fully
support
the
democratically
elected
national
assembly
with
juan
guaido
as
its
president
may
s
spokesman
said
in
relation
to
the
we
think
it
is
totally
unacceptable
for
venezuela
to
cut
off
diplomatic
ties
the
solution
to
this
crisis
lies
in
working
to
find
a
peaceful
and
diplomatic
solution
not
in
