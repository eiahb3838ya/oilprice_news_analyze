a
rise
in

in
november
december
and
stretching
into
january
after
suffering
a
year
of
decline
and
said
it
would
boost
growth
with
the

welcomed
the
news
with
interglobe
aviation
ltd
shares
rising
as
much
as
percent
to
their
highest
in
three
weeks
the
optimism
comes
after
major
carriers
swung
to
a
loss
in
as
high
oil
prices
a
weak
rupee
and
domestic
price
competition
eroded
margins
leaving
indigo
s
rival
jet

struggling
to
stay
in
the
air
for
interglobe
the
september

marked
its
first

returned

profit
in
albeit
a
percent
fall
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
billion
rupees
million
due
to
higher
costs
morgan
stanley
analysts
said
the
profit
missed
their
estimate
due
to
lower
passenger
volume
but
that
a
rise
in
passenger
yield
a
proxy
for
airfare
was
a
larger
positive
for
investors
indigo
s
passenger
yield
rose
for
the
first
time
since
the
end
of
with
a
busy
festive
period
pushing
the
yield
up
by
percent
in
versus
a
year
prior
in
the
september
quarter
the
yield
fell
percent
for
the
time
being
the
better
environment
that
we
had
in
november
and
december
has
continued
so
far

willy
boulter
said
on
an
analyst
call
we
see
there
is
some
discipline
in
imposing
advance
purchase
indigo
last
year
said
fares
were
down
in
part
because
rivals
were
not
charging
the
usual
premium
for
bookings
its
load
factor
a
measure
of
seats
filled
fell
percentage
points
to
percent
chief
financial

rohit

said
fare
hikes
in
november
and
december
offset
that
decline
making
it

said
the
december
quarter
performance
was
stronger
than
expected
we
believe
the

costs
is
behind
