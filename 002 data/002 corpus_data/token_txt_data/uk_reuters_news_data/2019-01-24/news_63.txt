update 7-u.s. weighs oil sanctions on venezuela as it steps up pressure
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
ratcheted
up
pressure
on
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
on
wednesday
signaling
potential
new
sanctions
against
the
country
s
vital
oil
sector
as
it
recognized
venezuela
s
opposition
leader
as
interim
president
with
street
protests
against
maduro
under
way
across
venezuela
president
donald
trump
said
the
united
states
recognized
juan
guaido
head
of
the
national
assembly
congress
as
the
country
s
leader
and
called
socialist
maduro
s
government
in
response
maduro
said
he
was
breaking
diplomatic
relations
with
the
united
states
and
giving
embassy
personnel
hours
to
leave
venezuela
the
united
states
however
rejected
maduro
s
move
to
cut
ties
saying
it
did
not
think
he
had
the
authority
to
sever
ties
and
it
would
conduct
relations
with
a
government
led
by
guaido
a
senior
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
warned
maduro
and
his
loyalists
that
washington
was
ready
to
ramp
up
oil
gold
and
other
sanctions
and
take
unspecified
actions
if
they
choose
to
harm
any
of
the
national
assembly
members
or
any
of
the
other
duly
legitimate
officials
of
the
government
of
asked
whether
he
was
considering
military
intervention
trump
told
reporters
we
re
not
considering
anything
but
all
options
are
on
the
venezuelan
opposition
sympathizers
had
been
urging
guaido
to
assume
the
presidency
since
maduro
was
inaugurated
for
a
second
term
on
following
a
widely
boycotted
election
last
year
that
many
foreign
governments
characterized
as
fraudulent
formal
recognition
of
guaido
could
be
complicated
however
by
questions
of
how
to
deal
with
venezuela
s
diplomats
and
who
would
now
control
its
bank
accounts
and
other
assets
which
include
citgo
the
refining
arm
of
venezuelan
oil
company
pdvsa
the
senior
administration
official
told
reporters
that
washington
now
regards
guaido
and
the
national
assembly
as
the
legitimate
in
transactions
between
the
united
states
and
venezuela
and
that
there
would
be
a
whole
bunch
of
consequences
but
declined
to
elaborate
recognition
of
guaido
could
backfire
if
maduro
who
accused
the
opposition
of
attempting
a
coup
used
it
as
a
pretext
to
detain
guaido
or
other
opposition
figures
after
trump
s
announcement
most
major
latin
american
countries
made
similar
moves
recognizing
guaido
and
a
canadian
official
said
ottawa
would
also
follow
suit
but
mexico
said
it
continued
to
recognize
maduro
as
president
nicolasmaduro
has
undertaken
a
fight
with
the
international
community
he
has
no
chance
of
winning
senator
marco
rubio
said
in
a
message
on
twitter
rubio
who
led
a
delegation
of
florida
lawmakers
to
discuss
venezuela
with
fellow
republican
trump
on
tuesday
is
considered
to
have
played
a
major
role
since
trump
took
office
in
convincing
him
to
take
a
tougher
stand
against
maduro
multiple
sources
said
the
trump
administration
could
impose
new
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
industry
as
soon
as
this
week
officials
are
considering
a
range
of
potential
measures
including
restricting
imports
of
venezuelan
oil
or
even
a
full
ban
but
no
final
decisions
have
been
made
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
two
other
sources
briefed
on
the
matter
said
the
trump
administration
informed
energy
companies
of
its
deliberations
the
decision
on
whether
to
go
ahead
could
depend
on
how
harshly
maduro
cracks
down
on
protesters
and
how
he
responds
to
guaido
s
several
of
the
sources
said
even
then
the
administration
would
likely
hold
further
discussions
that
could
delay
any
final
move
one
source
said
the
trump
administration
has
been
increasingly
frustrated
with
existing
sanctions
on
venezuela
which
have
spared
oil
exports
so
far
targeting
oil
shipments
to
the
united
states
could
choke
off
significant
revenue
to
the
opec
member
nation
the
united
states
has
held
off
on
broad
measures
mindful
of
the
potential
not
only
for
deepening
the
hardships
of
the
venezuelan
people
but
also
the
risk
of
causing
problems
for
companies
and
consumers
refiners
such
as
valero
energy
corp
chevron
corp
and
pbf
energy
inc
have
had
discussions
about
the
possibility
of
such
sanctions
with
the
trump
administration
in
recent
weeks
venezuelan
crude
exports
to
the
united
states
last
year
fell
percent
to
the
lowest
annual
average
in
nearly
three
decades
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
still
some
refineries
have
equipment
specifically
designed
for
heavy
grades
of
crude
like
those
from
venezuela
they
imported
about
barrels
per
day
last
year
