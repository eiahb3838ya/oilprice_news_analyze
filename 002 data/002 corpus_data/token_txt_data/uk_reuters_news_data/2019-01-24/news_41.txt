the
euro
retreated
while
stocks
and
bonds
rallied
on
thursday
as
painful
data
from
france
and
only
modestly
better
readings
from
germany
set
the
tone
for
the
european
central
bank
s
first
meeting
of
the
year
progress
or
lack
of
it
in
trade
talks
was
also
in
focus
as
were
signs
of
a

traders
were
waiting
to
see
how
much
concern

chief
mario
draghi
shows
at
his
gmt

after
a
blizzard

showed
business

pulled

of

the
impact
of

germany
s
services
sector
accelerated
more
than
expected
but
that
was
largely
offset
by
the
first
contraction
in
manufacturing
in
more
than
four
years
the
euro
fell
percent
to
and
while
an
upbeat
tech
sector
helped
stocks
it
meant
there
would
be
plenty
of
concerned
questions
for
