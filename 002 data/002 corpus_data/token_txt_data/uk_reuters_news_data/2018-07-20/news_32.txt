pay

naftogaz
ceo

kobolyev
this
week
was
quoted
as
saying
gazprom
s
talk
of
reaching
an
amicable
agreement
was
just
a
waste
of
time
but
that
naftogaz
was
prepared
to
consider
it
ukraine
and
russia
have
clashed
over
gas
supply
and
pricing
for
years
and
relations
have
deteriorated
since
russia
annexed
crimea

no
longer
buys
gas
from
gazprom
but
the
russian
company
still
pipes
gas
across
ukraine
to
europe
naftogaz
and
gazprom
this
week
held
a
european
meeting
in
berlin
on
a
new
transit
deal
but
the
talks
have
been
complicated
by
their
lengthy
legal
dispute
a
stockholm
court
in
february
awarded
naftogaz
billion
in
damages
but
also
ordered
it
to
pay
billion
to
gazprom
and
to
resume
purchases
this
month
naftogaz
said
it
had
submitted
a
new
claim
to
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
for
more
than
billion
from
gazprom

to
a
transit
contract
