turkey
s
biggest
oil
importer
tupras
has
cut
back
purchases
of
iranian
crude
since
may
when
the
united
states
said
it
would
sanctions
on
tehran
and
analysts
say
tupras
is
likely
to
stick
to
lower
volumes
in

nato

turkey
depends
heavily
on
imports
to
meet
its
energy
needs
and
neighbouring
iran
has
been
one
of
its
main
sources
of
oil
because
of
its
proximity
crude
quality
and
favourable
price
differentials
traders
say
in
the
first
four
months
of
tupras
turkey
s
largest
refiner
bought
an
average
of
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
oil
data
from
turkey
s
energy
watchdog
epdk
showed
in
april
alone
tupras
imported
eight
cargoes
equivalent
to
just
over
bpd
from
the
opec
member
but
since
may
when
president
donald
trump
announced
the
of
sanctions
on
tehran
after
pulling
out
of
a
nuclear
deal
tupras
s
purchases
of
iranian
oil
have
gone
down
tehran
shipped
four
cargoes
of
crude
oil
per
month
to
tupras
equivalent
to
around
bpd
in
may
and
june
tanker
tracking
and
shipping
data
showed
down
from
six
to
eight
earlier
in
the
year
so
far
in
july
tupras
has
bought
three
more
cargoes
the
united
states
is
due
to
sanctions
on
iran
s
energy
sector
after
a
period
ends
on
an
industry
source
said
the
decision
was
the
main
reason
for
the
decline
in
tupras
s
purchases
of
iranian
oil
since
may
but
said
the
company
was
likely
to
continue
importing
some
iranian
crude
as
it
did
when
sanctions
were
previously
in
force
during
the
sanctions
scheme
of
by
the
tupras
was
able
to
purchase
to
cargoes
of
iranian
crude
a
month
the
industry
source
said
i
believe
they
would
want
to
be
able
to
stick
to
that
this
time
as
well
instead
of
completely
stopping
this
crude
needs
to
be
bought
by
someone
as
otherwise
it
will
send
the
price
shooting
up
which
nobody
wants
he
said
refiners
in
other
countries
are
affected
by
the
sanctions
because
they
want
to
maintain
their
access
to
the
financial
system
indian
refiners
also
cut
imports
of
iranian
oil
last
month
to
avoid
looming
sanctions
trump
initially
planned
to
totally
shut
iran
out
of
global
oil
markets
demanding
all
other
countries
stop
buying
its
crude
by
november
the
united
states
later
said
it
may
grant
sanction
waivers
to
some
allies
that
are
particularly
reliant
on
iranian
supplies
most
analysts
still
think
the
sanctions
will
significantly
reduce
iran
s
crude
oil
exports
with
some
forecasting
as
much
as
a
drop
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
turkey
has
criticised
the
decision
saying
ankara
will
not
cut
trade
ties
with
iran
at
the
behest
of
other
countries
after
meeting
a
delegation
in
ankara
on
friday
the
turkish
foreign
ministry
said
authorities
were
working
to
avoid
the
sanctions
from
harming
turkey
in
the
past
whenever
turkey
has
needed
to
cut
back
on
iranian
oil
iraqi
crude
emerged
as
the
alternative
analysts
say
that
is
again
likely
to
be
the
case
in
the
coming
months
iran
and
iraq
have
traditionally
been
turkey
s
two
biggest
crude
oil
suppliers
cuneyt
kazokoglu
head
of
oil
demand
at
consulting
firm
fge
said
it
won
t
be
a
surprise
to
see
more
basra
barrels
flowing
to
turkey
he
said
in
the
first
four
months
of
the
year
turkey
imported
an
average
of
bpd
of
iraqi
oil
in
the
whole
of
iraq
was
turkey
s
third
biggest
supplier
of
crude
after
iran
and
russia
with
million
tonnes
of
oil
equivalent
to
around
bpd
