update 1-vattenfall profit dips in q2, heatwave seen driving prices
stockholm
reuters
swedish
utility
vattenfall
reported
a
fall
in
underlying
operating
earnings
for
the
second
quarter
on
friday
after
higher
coal
and
gas
prices
put
a
damper
on
margins
even
as
a
heatwave
lifted
power
prices
in
its
nordic
home
market
a
hot
and
dry
spring
and
early
summer
have
followed
a
cold
winter
in
the
region
leading
to
far
lower
water
flows
than
normal
though
vattenfall
said
reservoir
levels
at
its
swedish
hydropower
plants
remained
adequate
for
now
the
drought
which
has
sparked
wildfires
across
sweden
has
pushed
up
nordic
electricity
prices
with
the
hydrologic
balance
between
water
supply
and
consumption
growing
increasingly
strained
vattenfall
chief
executive
magnus
hall
said
this
hydrologic
balance
is
almost
back
at
the
situation
we
had
in
when
prices
became
very
high
he
told
reuters
prices
have
already
come
up
as
a
result
of
this
and
the
assessment
is
that
if
we
don
t
see
considerable
amounts
of
rain
this
price
increase
will
vattenfall
s
hydropower
plants
primarily
located
along
the
river
arteries
crossing
northern
sweden
account
for
roughly
a
third
of
its
electricity
production
quarterly
operating
profit
excluding
items
fell
to
billion
swedish
crowns
million
from
a
billion
even
as
net
sales
increased
percent
the
company
said
vattenfall
which
produces
energy
from
carbons
nuclear
hydropower
and
wind
said
higher
prices
for
coal
gas
and
emission
allowances
had
squeezed
margins
in
its
power
plants
that
use
those
fuels
the
average
spot
price
for
gas
was
percent
higher
compared
to
the
second
quarter
of
last
year
while
coal
prices
were
up
percent
the
company
said
electricity
prices
have
come
up
but
so
have
costs
and
that
is
what
we
are
seeing
a
bit
in
our
results
hall
said
vattenfall
recorded
its
first
annual
profit
in
five
years
in
as
the
company
turned
the
corner
on
a
disastrous
buying
spree
outside
its
nordic
home
market
that
saw
it
rack
up
the
biggest
in
swedish
corporate
history
swedish
crowns
