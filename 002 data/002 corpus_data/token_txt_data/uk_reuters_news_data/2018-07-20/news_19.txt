asian
shares
pushed
higher

volatile
trade

bounced
from
a
low
with
market
participants
suspecting
state
support
for
the
currency
the
yuan
took
a
beating
earlier
in
the
day
after
the
central
bank
set
a
weaker
fixing
for
the
currency
for
the
seventh
straight
session
adding
to
the
anxiety
in
asian
markets
which
remain
sensitive
to
any
sharp
moves
in
the
yuan

the
yuan
s
latest
bout
of
weakness
catalysed
by
concerns
over
the
brewing
trade
war
and
a
slowing
chinese
economy
has
seen
the
it
shed
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
since
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
there
are
several
channels
through
which
the
yuan
s
weakening
is
hitting
asian
stocks
first
a
weaker
yuan
challenges
the
competitiveness
of
other
asian
economies
said
shusuke
yamada
currency
and
equity
strategist
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
in
tokyo
the
weaker
currency
also
causes
fears
of
capital
leaving
china
and
disrupting
their
capital
markets
which
could
have
effects
on
asia
lastly
a
weaker
yuan
deepens
trade
war
the
yuan
fell
to
as
low
as
to
the
dollar
in
the
onshore
market
before
reversing
course
to
last
trade
at
for
a
gain
of
about
percent
china
s
stocks
bounced
back
after
the
yuan
made
its
about
turn
its
depreciation
arrested
after
major
chinese
banks
were
seen
selling
dollars
in
an
apparent
bid
by
authorities
to
prevent
a
rapid
fall
in
the
currency
dominant
in
investors
memories
is
china
s
sudden
devaluation
of
the
yuan
in
and
the
subsequent
turmoil
in
global
financial
markets
then
as
investors
worried
about
the
stability
of
the
world
s
economy
elsewhere
in
asia
on
friday
japan
s
nikkei
was
down
percent
while
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
both
bounced
out
of
negative
territory
to
gain
percent
and
percent
respectively
investors
do
not
know
how
far
the
yuan
could
fall
said
ken
cheung
senior
asian
fx
strategist
at
mizuho
bank
in
hong
kong
the
authorities
might
want
to
keep
economic
growth
stable
and
the
direct
impact
of
a
weaker
yuan
could
offset
some
negative
impact
from
the
trade
war
but
it
will
be
hard
to
maintain
confidence
among
foreign
investors
in
purchasing
asian
stock
markets
were
already
edgy
after
wall
street
shares
declined
overnight
amid

tensions

concern
about
the
potential
impact
of

and
a
stronger
dollar
on
the
economy
and
american
corporate
competitiveness
the

major
currencies
was
percent
lower
at
after
being
knocked
down
from
its
highest
level
since
july
the
dollar
had
reached
that
high
after
