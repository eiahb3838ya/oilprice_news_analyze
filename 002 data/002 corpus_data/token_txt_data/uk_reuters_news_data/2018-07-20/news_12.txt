beijing

in

the
yuan
slid
as
low
as
to
the

in

the
drop
in

yuan
came
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
was
concerned
that
the
chinese
currency
was
dropping
like
a
rock
and
the
strong
dollar
puts
us
at
a
disadvantage
his
comments
knocked
the
dollar
forcing
it
off
highs
against
a
basket
of
currencies
but
the
yuan
hurt
by
concerns
over
the

war
and
a
