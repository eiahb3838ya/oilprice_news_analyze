service
giants
schlumberger
and
general
electric
co
s
baker

missed
second
quarter
revenue
forecasts
on
friday
as
slow
international
growth
offset
record
production
in
the
united
states
that
boosted
domestic
demand
for
their
services
the
companies
were
the
first
among
their
peers
to
report
earnings
putting
them
under
scrutiny
from
analysts
seeking
clues
about
the
health
of
the
industry
schlumberger
the
world
s
largest
oilfield
services
firm
is
viewed
a
as
bellwether
for
the
global
oil
and
gas
industry
due
to
its
heavy
international
exposure
schlumberger
s
overall
revenue
rose
percent
in
the
quarter
to
billion
missing
analysts
estimate
of
billion
according
to

revenue
from
schlumberger
s
international
business
dragged
the
overall
performance
down
it
grew
percent
in
the

to
billion

below

ago
ge
s
baker
hughes
reported
total
revenue
of
billion
versus
analysts
forecasts
of
billion
according
to
baker
hughes
revenues
were
hurt
by
its
oilfield
equipment
and
turbomachinery
businesses
the
performances
reflect
how
a
relatively
slow
recovery
in
international
markets
where
oil
projects
are
often
more
costly
continues
to
drag
down
earnings
for
large
integrated
service
firms
even
as
surging
production
helps
oil
production
last
week
hit
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
marking
a
dramatic
comeback
in
an
industry
that
had
been
hard
hit
by
the
oil
price
crash
wall
street
analysts
were
not
fazed
by
the
missed
estimates
and
instead
focused
their
attention
on
sequential
growth
in
international
markets
and
upbeat
comments
from
executives
both
companies
were
much
more
optimistic
about
the
global
land
and
offshore
recovery
than
in
previous
conference
calls

off
a
fraction
of
a

baker

the
global
benchmark
topped
a
barrel
in
the
second
quarter
its
strongest
level
in
roughly
three
and
a
half
years
amid
an
effort
by
major
oil
producers
to
cut
production
and
stabilize
prices
and
supply
disruptions
schlumberger
said
it
expected
to
fully
utilize
its
international
equipment
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
and
forecasted
double
digit
growth
in
that
segment
next
year
the
recovery
has
finally
started

call
baker
hughes
ceo
lorenzo
simonelli
said
his
firm
was
seeing
positive
indications
from
a
number
of
international
markets
and
that
activity
should
drive
growth
in
its
oilfield
equipment
and
turbomachinery
businesses
going
forward
this
is
what
people
have
been
looking
for
the
inflection
in
the
international
business
it
is
starting
to
materialize
now

referencing
the
firm

sequential
growth
revenue
from

north

jumped
about
percent
to

both
companies
said
they
have
yet
to
see
the
impacts
of
pipeline
constraints
in
the
permian
where
growing
production
is
quickly
outpacing
available
takeaway
capacity
schlumberger
warned
the
constraints
could
slow
growth
in
the
coming
months
but
said
it
plans
to
continue
deploying
hydraulic
fracturing
fleets
the
