it
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
cases
attempting
to
hold
oil
and
gas
companies
responsible
for
climate
change
caused
by
carbon
emissions
from
burning
fossil

and

a
day
after
a

similar
suit
by
new
york
city
baltimore
is
vulnerable
to
any
rise
in
sea
level
because
it
has
miles
km
of
coastline
and
one
of
the
country

largest
ports
according

the

which
points
to
research

lawsuit
accuses
oil
and
gas
companies
of
knowing
about
a
link
between
climate
change
and
fossil
fuel
production
for
nearly
years
yet
working
to
hide
the
dangers
and
protect
their
assets
rather
than
minimize
the
damage
the
complaint
seeks
unspecified
damages
penalties
and
relief
these
oil
and
gas
companies
could
have
warned
us
they
could
have
taken
steps
to
minimize
or
avoid
the
damage
in
fact
they
had
a
responsibility
to
do
both
but
they
didn
t
and
that
s
why
we
are
taking
them
to
court

a
chevron
spokesman
said
the
company
supports
meaningful
efforts
to
address
climate
change
but
that
lawsuits
are
counterproductive
to
real
these
lawsuits
seek
to
penalize
the
production
of
reliable
affordable
energy
which
has
been
lawful
and
encouraged
for
decades
by
government
officials
chevron
spokesman
sean
comey
said
in
an
email
a
cnx
resources
spokesman
said
the
company

been
served
so
was
unable
to
comment
spokespeople
for
the
other
oil
companies
were
not
immediately
available
to
comment
the
oil
companies
had
moved
to
dismiss
new
york
city
s
lawsuit
on
numerous
grounds
including
that
the
federal
clean
air
act
authorizes
only
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
bring
lawsuits
over
pollution
