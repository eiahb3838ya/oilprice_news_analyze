the
dollar
weakened
on
friday
against
key
world
currencies
as
president
donald
trump
complained
again
about
its
strength
while
and
european
stock
markets
were
tepid
amid
fresh
tariff
talk
and
another
round
of
corporate
earnings
government
bond
yields
rose
as
trump
repeated
his
criticism
a
day
earlier
of
the
federal
reserve
s
policy
on
raising
interest
rates
saying
it
takes
away
from
the
united
states
big
competitive
he
also
lamented
the
strength
of
the
dollar
and
accused
the
european
union
and
china
of
manipulating
their
currencies
the
dollar
was
on
pace
for
its
biggest
drop
in
three
weeks
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
stalling
a
rally
that
had
driven
the
greenback
to
a
year
high
the
dollar
is
an
important
issue
today
especially
because
we
have
been
on
a
rise
for
quite
a
long
time

the
dollar
going

typically
tends
to

and
i
think
that
is
partly
why
we
have
seen
a
little
bit
of
a
turnaround
today
