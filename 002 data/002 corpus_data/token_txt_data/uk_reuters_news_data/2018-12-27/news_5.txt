russia
s
nuclear
power
company
rosatom
has
offered
chile
s
government
technology
it
says
can
boost
output
of
lithium
a
key
ingredient
in
electric
vehicle
batteries
according
to
lobbyist
transparency
filings
reviewed
by
reuters
in
separate
meetings
in
late
november
lobbyists
for
the
uranium
one
group
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
rosatom
told
officials
at
two
chilean
agencies
they
could
sustainably
boost
extraction
rates
of
the
ultralight
battery
metal
from
brine
improve
its
quality
and
net
more
money
in
royalties
for
chilean
coffers
if
the
russian
technology
meets
with
your
requirements
and
expectations
uranium
one
group
would
be
willing
to
introduce
it
for
projects
operated
by
sqm
albemarle
and
other
concessionaires
with
the
goal
of
increasing
their
production
quotas
the
lobbyists
told
chilean
officials
in
the
filings
sqm
and
albemarle
which
operate
in
chile
s
atacama
salt
flat
are
the
world
s
top
producers
of
lithium
both
have
recently
won
approvals
to
boost
their
quotas
of
lithium
production
without
using
more
brine
or
saltwater
in
the
process
representatives
from
rosatom
pitched
their
plan
to
officials
with
chile
development
agency
corfo
and
the
andean
nation
s
ministry
of
mining
russia
s
interest
in
the
south
american
nation
s
lithium
industry
comes
as
electric
automakers
worldwide
seek
resources
for
their
batteries
chile
is
the
world
s
top
copper
producer
and
the
world
s
no
producer
of
lithium
both
metals
critical
for
the
industry
automakers
governments
miners
and
other
have
increasingly
lobbied
officials
here
for
access
to
chile
s
coveted
resources
rosatom
said
its
technology
would
utilize
residual
brines
left
over
after
processing
and
it
would
do
away
with
the
large
solar
evaporation
pools
that
chile
s
top
miners
use
to
produce
lithium
the
lobbyist
records
show
the
company
also
offered
several
other
options
to
chilean
officials
including
building
a
plant
to
convert
lithium
chloride
to
a
lithium
hydroxide
that
it
said
is
not
produced
in
chile
but
is
increasingly
coveted
by
automakers
a
more
efficient
technology
could
help
chile
stem
an
impending
environmental
crisis
uncertainty
over
just
how
much
water
remains
beneath
the
surface
of
chile
s
salt
flats
has
increasingly
sparked
conflict
between
lithium
and
copper
miners
and
between
industry
and
indigenous
communities
any
proposal
from
rosatom
one
of
the
world
s
largest
producers
of
nuclear
reactors
would
likely
face
close
scrutiny
from
chilean
regulators
chile
considers
lithium
a
strategic
mineral
limiting
its
production
and
restricting
use
in
nuclear
applications
