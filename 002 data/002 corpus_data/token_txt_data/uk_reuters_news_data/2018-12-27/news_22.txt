have
risen

the
data
showed
when
we
look
at
the
region
we
think
it
is
mainly
china
which
has
been
driving
the
north
asian
growth
over
november
to
december
said

this
was
likely
because
of
the

imports
into
china
have
risen
to
a
record
of
about
million
tonnes
so
far
in
december
up
percent
from
the
previous
high
in
november
as
households
and
businesses
crank
up
their
heating
with
the
start
of
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
china
s
government
has
ordered
residents
and
businesses
to
shift
to
natural
gas
for
heating
from
coal
to
reduce
air
pollution
to
avoid
shortages
chinese
companies
procured
supplies
ahead
of
the
winter
shipments
to
japan
also
rose
to
a
high
in
december
likely
due
to
colder
weather
but
this
could
be
a
temporary
increase
as
inventories
are
high
a
trader
said
he
added
that
buyers
have
largely
finished
their
spot
procurement
for
winter
temperatures
across
tokyo
beijing
and
seoul
are
expected
to
be
colder

a

china
over

forecasts
from

japan
is
likely
to
experience
weather
between
january
and
march
next
year
in
south
korea
lng
imports
also
rose
in
december
the
country
s
lng
imports
have
generally
been
strong
this
year
due
to
maintenance
at
nuclear
power
plants
and
a
delay
in
the
of
new
nuclear
plants
said
ken
lee
a
senior
analyst
at
fge
over
january
to
february
we
expect
these
relatively
high
imports
to
continue
but
the
recent
cold
spell
in
china
means
that
they
ll
be
able
to
absorb
more
volumes
over
first
quarter
of
as
stocks
diminish
