russia plays down idea of forming joint organisation with opec given u.s. sanctions risk
moscow
reuters
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
opec
and
other
oil
producers
would
set
up
a
joint
structure
due
to
the
additional
red
tape
it
would
create
as
well
as
the
risk
of
sanctions
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
thursday
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
top
oil
producers
led
by
russia
have
since
the
end
of
made
an
unprecedented
joint
effort
to
curb
output
and
support
prices
opec
and
russia
jointly
produce
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
russia
s
energy
ministry
had
said
that
moscow
and
opec
lynchpin
saudi
arabia
had
reached
a
general
agreement
that
the
format
should
be
institutionalised
and
extended
until
and
beyond
to
monitor
the
market
and
take
joint
action
if
needed
however
novak
said
such
an
idea
has
been
ditched
there
is
a
consensus
that
there
will
be
no
such
organisation
that
s
because
it
requires
additional
bureaucratic
brouhaha
in
relation
to
financing
cartel
with
the
side
novak
told
a
briefing
to
reporters
i
think
countries
will
not
agree
as
they
don
t
want
to
be
hit
by
proposed
legislation
known
as
nopec
could
open
opec
up
to
lawsuits
but
has
long
laid
dormant
with
previous
presidents
signalling
that
they
would
veto
any
move
to
make
it
law
however
president
donald
trump
has
been
a
vocal
critic
of
opec
blaming
it
for
high
oil
prices
and
urging
it
to
increase
output
this
won
t
be
an
organisation
this
is
some
mechanism
of
cooperation
to
convene
to
discuss
adopt
some
memorandums
joint
resolutions
novak
said
about
future
cooperation
with
opec
