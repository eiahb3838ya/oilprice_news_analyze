asian
shares
on
thursday
rode
a
dramatic
surge
on
wall
street
as
markets
battered
by
a
recent
drum
roll
of
deepening
political
and
economic
gloom
cheered
upbeat
data
and
the
trump
administration
s
effort
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
in
a
buying
frenzy
as
spectacular
as
the
recent
rout
stocks
soared
with
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
rocketing
more
than
points
for
the
first
time
on
wednesday
that
helped
push

european

are
set
to

it

closing

higher
while
australian

jumped

chinese
shares
did
not
join
asia
s
rebound
the
index
was
down
percent
as
was
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
there
was
no
single
trigger
for
the
overnight
relief
rally
on
wall
street
though
a
mastercard
inc
report
that
sales
during
the
holiday
shopping
season
rose
the
most
in
six
years
in
helped
allay
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
economy
there
were
also
some
attempts
by
the
white
house
to
temper
its
broadside
against
the
federal
reserve
kevin
hassett
chairman
of
the
white
house
council
of
economic
advisers
said
on
wednesday
that
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
s
job
was
not
in
jeopardy
his
comments
came
days
after
president
donald
trump
described
the
fed
as
the
only
problem
in
the
economy
after
the
central
bank
last
week
raised
rates
for
the
fourth
time
this
year
and
retained
plans
for
more
hikes
in
a
government
shutdown
concerns
over
slower
global
growth
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
convening
a
crisis
group
following
the
sharp
in
equities
have
also
rattled
investors
there
is
a
question
which
is
starting
to
unfold
whether
this
is
a
bear
market
rally
or
whether
this
is
something
more
sustainable
said
chris
weston
head
of
research
at
foreign
exchange
brokerage
pepperstone
we
probably
got
another
to
percent
in
these
market
rallies
before
we
see
people
looking
to
fade
into
faced
with
deepening
gloom
investors
were
quick
to
lap
up
media
reports
that
a
trade
team
will
travel
to
beijing
the
week
of
to
hold
talks
with
chinese
officials
i
think
worries
regarding
the
government
shutdown
as
well
as
lack
of
clarity
over
whether
the
negotiations
over
trade
will
go
well
or
not
still
remain
said
norihiro
fujito

investment

reuters
reported
on
thursday
that
the
trump
administration
is
considering
an
executive
order
in
the
new
year
to
declare
a
national
emergency
that
would
bar
companies
from
using
huawei
and
zte
products
not
all
signs
were
positive
overnight
with
the

bank
of

investors
a
reminder
of
the
underlying
global
risks
the
index
fell
the
most
on
record
refinitiv
data
going
back
to
showed
the
weak

fears
that
trade

are
weighing
on
producers
and
came
days
before
the
release
of
the
chicago
purchasing
managers
index
at
the
end
of
the
week
oil
also
caught
investors
attention
after
crude
and
brent
overnight
both
marked
their
largest
rises
since
late
november
crude
on
wednesday
rallied
almost
percent
while
brent
jumped
more
than
percent
in
a
partial
rebound
from
steep
losses
that
pushed
crude
benchmarks
to
lows
not
seen
since
last
year
crude
was
last
trading
percent
lower
at
a
barrel
while
brent
gave
up
percent
at
a
barrel
if
we
can
see
oil
prices
moving
up
in
the
low
end
of
the
range
which
is
around
to
then
we
ll
continue
to
see
equities
moving
higher
