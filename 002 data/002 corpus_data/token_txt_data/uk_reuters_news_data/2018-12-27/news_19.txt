world
stocks
bounced
off
a
near
low
on
thursday
lifted
by
a
dramatic
wall
street
surge
though
a
fall
in
chinese
industrial
profits
and
renewed
italian
banking
worries
offered
a
sobering
reminder
of
the
problems
weighing
on
the
world
economy
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
surged
more
than
points
for
the
first
time
on
wednesday
leading
a
broad
wall
street
rebound
after
a
report
that
holiday
sales
were
the
strongest
in
years
helped
mollify
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
economy
stocks
in
asia
and
europe
took
their
cue
from
this
rally
and
opened
strongly
pushing
the
msci
world
equity
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
percent
higher
the
index
had
already
spiked
percent
in
the
previous
session
rising
off
a
low
hit
on
christmas
eve
the
relentless
selling
which
prevailed
leading
up
to
christmas
has
mercifully
halted
as
stock
markets
recorded
significant
gains
said
stephen
innes
a
trader
at
online
fx
broker
oanda
he
attributed
the
rally
partly
to
a
mastercard
inc
report
that
sales
during
the
holiday
shopping
season
rose
the
most
in
six
years
in
helping
allay
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
economy
the
surge
in
online
purchases
over
the
holiday
season
should
be
a
reminder
for
the
markets
never
to
underestimate
the
purchasing
power
of
the
consumer
innes
said
there
were
also
some
attempts
by
the
white
house
to
temper
its
broadside
against
the
federal
reserve
kevin
hassett
chairman
of
the
white
house
council
of
economic
advisers
said
on
wednesday
that
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
s
job
was
not
in
jeopardy
however
the
rally
fizzled
somewhat
in
europe
where
shares
opened
higher
percent
then
erased
most
of
the
early
gains
france
s
cac
index
and
spain
s
ibex
stood
percent
higher
while
a
stock
index
was
flat
dragged
lower
by
italian
stocks
milan
was
hit
by
renewed
concerns
over
the
country
s
banking
sector
after
lender
banca
carige
was
denied
a
cash
call
by
its
largest
shareholder
the
news
weighed
on
italian
government
bonds
too
curbing
a
rally
and
pushing
yields
higher
on
the
day
earlier
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
rose
percent
and
away
from
lows
while
japan
s
nikkei
managed
to
pull
out
of
bear
market
territory
to
closing
percent
higher
australian
shares
jumped
percent
but
chinese
shares
did
not
join
the
rebound
with
mainland
shares
as
well
as
hong
kong
down
percent
earnings
at
china
s
industrial
firms
dropped
in
november
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
the
concerns
over
a
faltering
global
economy
and
signs
of
a
crude
oil
glut
pressured
oil
prices
sending
brent
futures
percent
lower
to
a
barrel
and
partly
reversing
the
previous
day
s
percent
jump
wednesday
s
rise
was
triggered
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreeing
to
limit
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
starting
in
january
treasury

too
reversed
direction
after
rising
sharply
on
wednesday
and
dropped
three
basis
points
to
percent
another
gold
was
up
percent
remaining
just
below
a
peak
hit
earlier
this
week
the
dollar
gave
up
some
of
its
overnight
gains
but
losses
were
limited
to
around
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
against
the
yen
a
perceived
safe
haven
it
was
off
percent
at

it
had
risen
nearly

overnight
booking
its
largest
