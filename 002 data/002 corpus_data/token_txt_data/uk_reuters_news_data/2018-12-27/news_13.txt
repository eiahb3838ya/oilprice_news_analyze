a
global
equity
rally
fuelled
by
a
dramatic
surge
on
wall
street
ran
out
of
steam
on
thursday
setting
shares
up
for
a
weak
opening
after
a
fall
in
chinese
industrial
profits
offered
a
reminder
of
the
pressures
on
the
world
economy
still
world
stocks
stayed
off
near
lows
lifted
by
wednesday
s
surge
on
the
dow
jones
index
which
was
triggered
partly
by
the
strongest
holiday
sales
in
years
stocks
in
asia
and
europe
initially
took
their
cue
from
this
rally
pushing
the
msci
world
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
percent
higher
adding
to
a
percent
spike
on
wednesday
when
the
previous
session
rising
off
a
low
hit
on
christmas
eve
but
the
gains
halved
by
gmt
as
a
equity
index
fell
percent
after
a
strong
open
and
german
shares
lost
percent
equity
futures
for
the
dow
jones
index
fell
percent
while
nasdaq
and
s
appeared
set
for
even
weaker
openings
yesterday
was
a
blowout
day
for
equity
markets
which
triggered
optimism
that
this
could
be
a
key
reversal
day
but
the
upward
momentum
has
not
really
followed
through
into
asia
and
europe
said
lee
hardman
an
analyst
at
mufg
in
london
one
reason
is
that
maybe
the
sharp
move
higher
was
driven
by
rebalancing
which
exaggerated
the
scale
of
the
rebound
and
now
we
have
reverted
to
the
trend
which
has
been
in
place
most
of
this
while
japanese
and
australian
shares
rose
strongly
markets
in
mainland
china
as
well
as
hong
kong
closed
percent
weaker
after
data
showed
earnings
at
china
s
industrial
firms
dropped
in
november
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
a
reuters
report
added
to
the
gloom
around
the
world
s
economy
saying
the
white
house
was
considering
barring
firms
from
buying
telecoms
equipment
from
china
s
huawei
and
zte
that
overshadowed
positive
noises
from
the
government
on
trade
talks
with
beijing
its
efforts
to
temper
the
white
house
s
recent
broadsides
against
the
federal
reserve
and
a
mastercard
inc
report
that
holiday
shopping
sales
had
risen
the
most
in
six
years
in
so
far
we
don
t
see
a
shift
in
fundamentals
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
remain
the
biggest
unknown
factor
for
said
hussein
sayed
a
strategist
at
online
brokerage
fxtm
there
were
also
renewed
concerns
in
italy
where
troubled
lender
banca
carige
was
denied
a
cash
call
by
its
largest
shareholder
pushing
its
shares
down
percent
the
concerns
over
a
faltering
global
economy
and
signs
of
a
crude
oil
glut
pressured
oil
prices
sending
brent
futures
percent
lower
to
a
barrel
and
partly
reversing
wednesday
s
percent
jump
that
rise
was
triggered
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreeing
to
limit
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
treasury
yields
also
reversed
direction
after
rising
sharply
on
wednesday
dropping
three
basis
points
to
percent
another
gold
was
up
percent
remaining
just
below
a
peak
hit
earlier
this
week
investors
also
bought
yen
pushing
the
dollar
percent
lower
versus
the
japanese
currency
and
forcing
it
to
cede
some
of
its
percent
overnight
rise
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
down
percent
we
have
started
to
see
the
yen
regain
its
place
as
the
safe
haven
of
choice
