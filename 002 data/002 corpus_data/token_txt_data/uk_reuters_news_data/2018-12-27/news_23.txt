asian
shares
on
thursday
latched
on
to
a
dramatic
surge
on
wall
street
as
markets
battered
by
a
recent
drum
roll
of
deepening
political
and
economic
gloom
cheered
upbeat
data
and
the
trump
administration
s
effort
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
in
a
buying
frenzy
that
was
as
spectacular
as
the
recent
rout
stocks
soared
with
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
rocketing
more
than
points
for
the
first
time
on
wednesday
that
helped
push
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
up
about
percent
and
away
from
lows
australian
shares
jumped
percent
as
trading
resumed
after
the
christmas
break
while
japan
s
nikkei
pulled
out
of
bear
market
territory
it
had
entered
on
tuesday
surging
percent
in
trading
there
was
no
single
trigger
for
the
overnight
relief
rally
on
wall
street
though
a
mastercard
inc
report
that
sales
during
the
holiday
shopping
season
rose
the
most
in
six
years
in
helped
clam
frayed
nerves
there
was
also
some
attempts
by
the
white
house
to
temper
its
broadside
against
the
federal
reserve
kevin
hassett
chairman
of
the
white
house
council
of
economic
advisers
said
on
wednesday
that
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
s
job
was
not
in
jeopardy
his
comments
came
just
days
after
president
donald
trump
described
the
fed
as
the
only
problem
to
the
economy
after
the
central
bank
last
week
raised
rates
for
the
fourth
time
this
year
and
retained
plans
for
more
hikes
in
a
government
shutdown
concerns
over
slower
global
growth
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
convening
a
crisis
group
following
the
sharp
in
equities
have
also
rattled
investors
faced
with
deepening
gloom
investors
were
quick
to
latch
on
to
media
reports
that
a
trade
team
will
travel
to
beijing
the
week
of
to
hold
talks
with
chinese
officials
investors
are
aware
of
negative
factors
but
they
aren
t
paying
attention
to
those
they
are
looking
at
the
dow
s
gain
will
likely
be
a
major
theme
today
said
norihiro
fujito
chief
investment
strategist
at
mitsubishi
ufj
morgan
stanley
securities
i
think
worries
regarding
the
government
shutdown
as
well
as
lack
of
clarity
over
whether
the
negotiations
over
trade
will
go
well
or
not
still
remain
he
said
after
the
overnight
rally
futures
for
the
s
p
were
last
down
nearly
half
a
percent
oil
also
caught
investors
attention
after
crude
and
brent
overnight
both
marked
their
largest
rises
since
late
november
crude
on
wednesday
rallied
almost
percent
while
brent
jumped
more
than
percent
in
a
partial
rebound
from
steep
losses
that
pushed
crude
benchmarks
to
lows
not
seen
since
last
year
crude
was
last
trading
percent
lower
at
a
barrel
while
brent
gave
up
percent
at
a
barrel
as
investors
moved
back
into
riskier
assets
overnight
treasury
yields
rose
and
last
stood
at
percent
about
basis
point
off
their
lowest
since
april
hit
in
asian
trading
on
wednesday
the
shift
into
riskier
assets
provided
support
to
the
dollar
which
rose
around
percent
against
the
yen
to
overnight
its
largest
gain
against
the
japanese
currency
since
late
april
the
dollar
gave
up
some
of
those
overnight
gains
in
early
asian
trade
on
thursday
last
off
percent
at
yen
the
currency
also
took
a
breather
against
the
euro
and
the
british
pound
losing
about
percent
against
both
currencies
to
and
respectively
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
was
a
shade
weaker
at
in
commodity
markets
gold
remained
below
a
peak
hit
during
the
previous
session
spot
gold
edged
higher
to
but
its
gains
were
capped
as
investors
ventured
back
into
riskier
assets
