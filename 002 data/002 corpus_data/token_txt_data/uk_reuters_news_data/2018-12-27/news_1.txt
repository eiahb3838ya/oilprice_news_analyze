a
dramatic
global
stock
rally
faded
on
thursday
after
a
fall
in
chinese
industrial
profits
and
in
consumer
confidence
offered
reminders
of
the
pressures
on
the
world
economy
still
an
index
of
world
stocks
stayed
off
near
lows
hit
earlier
this
week
before
wednesday
s
surge
on
the
dow
jones
index
which
was
attributed
to
the
strongest
holiday
sales
in
years
yesterday
was
a
blowout
day
for
equity
markets
which
triggered
optimism
that
this
could
be
a
key
reversal
day
but
the
upward
momentum
has
not
really
followed
through
said
lee
hardman
an
analyst
at
mufg
in
london
one
reason
is
that
maybe
the
sharp
move
higher
was
driven
by
rebalancing
which
exaggerated
the
scale
of
the
rebound
and
now
we
have
reverted
to
the
trend
which
has
been
in
place
most
of
this
that
trend
is
toward
weaker
stock
dollar
and
oil
prices
along
with
stronger
demand
for
government
bonds
gold
and
japanese
yen

for
the
first
time

three

a
reuters

added
to
the
gloom
around
the
world
s
economy
saying
the
white
house
was
considering
barring
firms
from
buying
telecoms

overshadowed
positive
noises
from

its
efforts
to
temper
the
white

recent
broadsides
against

far
we
don
t
see
a
shift
in

trade
tensions
between
the

china
remain
the
biggest
unknown
factor
for

there
were
also
renewed
concerns
in
italy
where
