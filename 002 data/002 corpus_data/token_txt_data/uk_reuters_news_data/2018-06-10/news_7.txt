and
acting
inconsistently

s
announcement
on
twitter
after
he
left
the
summit
in
canada
early
that
he
was
backing
out
of
the
joint
communique
torpedoed
what
appeared
to
be
a
fragile
consensus
on
a
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
its
top
allies
trump
also
took
aim
at
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
and
said
he
might
double
down
on
import
tariffs
by
hitting
the
sensitive
automobile
industry
throwing
efforts
to
show
a
united
front
into
disarray
members
germany
and
france
said
they
stood
by
the
communique
despite
trump
s
decision
in
a
matter
of
seconds
you
can
destroy
trust
with
twitter
characters
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
said
when
asked
about
trump
s
adding
it
would
take
much
longer
to
rebuild
lost
trust
trump
s
conduct
was
actually
not
a
real
surprise
we
have
seen
this
with
the
climate
agreement
or
the
iran
deal
maas
a
senior
member
of
the
social
democrats
spd
a
partner
in
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
governing
coalition
told
reporters
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
global
deal
reached
in
paris
in

to
curb
global
warming
and
last
month
from
world
powers
july
nuclear
deal
with
iran
asserting
that
it
was
in
tehran
s
favour
spd
leader
andrea
nahles
accused
trump
of
turning
the
summit
into
a
disaster
with
his
tweets
and
bowing
out
of
his
international
responsibilities
president
trump
is
creating
chaos
reasonable
and
reliable
policy
is
not
possible
that
france
and
europe
are
standing
by
the
communique
a
french
presidency
official
said
adding
anyone
departing
from
the
commitments
made
at
the
summit
would
be
showing
their
incoherence
and
inconsistency
international
cooperation
can
not
depend
on
being
angry
and
on
sound
bites
let
s
be
serious
the
french
official
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
told
reuters
trump
has
infuriated
the
european
union
canada
and
mexico
by
imposing
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
accusing
all
of
having
shortchanged
the
united
states
in
trade
deals
they
strongly
deny
this
trump
and
european
allies
are
also
at
odds
over
trump
s
decision
to
pull
the
united
states
out
of
the
deal
in
which
iran
curbed
its
disputed
nuclear
programme
in
exchange
for
sanctions
relief
and
the
paris
climate
change
accord
we
have
to
keep
a
cool
head
now
and
draw
the
right
conclusions
maas
said
europe
s
answer
must
be
to
stick
even
closer
together
defend
its
interests
and
strengthen
alliances
with
countries
such
as
japan
and
canada
he
said
europe
united
is
the
answer
to
america
first
maas
added
a
german
government
spokesman
also
said
that
berlin
stands
by
the
jointly
agreed
communique
in
which
leaders
underlined
the
crucial
role
of
a
international
trading
system
and
promised
to
fight
protectionism
in
washington
the
top
white
house
economic
adviser
accused
canada
s
prime
minister
on
sunday
of
betraying
trump
with
polarising
statements
on
trade
policy
that
risked
undermining
the
american
leader
on
the
eve
of
a
historic
summit
with
north
korea
larry
kudlow
director
of
the
national
economic
council
lashed
out
at
trudeau
as
amateurish
and
sophomoric
for
a
news
conference
the
prime
minister
gave
after
trump
left
the
summit
on
saturday
trudeau
told
reporters
that
he
had
spoken
of
retaliatory
measures
that
canada
would
take
next
month
in
response
to
trump
s
decision
to
slap
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
