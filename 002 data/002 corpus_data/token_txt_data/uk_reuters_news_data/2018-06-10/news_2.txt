update 1-merkel: eu will act against u.s. tariffs on steel, aluminium
berlin
reuters
europe
will
implement
against
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
just
like
canada
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
sunday
voicing
regret
about
president
donald
trump
s
abrupt
decision
to
withdraw
support
for
a
communique
trump
s
announcement
on
twitter
after
leaving
the
group
of
seven
summit
in
canada
early
that
he
was
backing
out
of
the
joint
communique
torpedoed
what
appeared
to
be
a
fragile
consensus
on
a
trade
dispute
between
washington
and
its
top
allies
the
withdrawal
so
to
speak
via
tweet
is
of
course
sobering
and
a
bit
depressing
merkel
said
in
an
ard
television
interview
following
the
summit
the
summit
did
not
mark
the
end
of
the
transatlantic
partnership
between
europe
and
the
merkel
said
but
she
repeated
that
europe
could
no
longer
rely
on
its
ally
and
should
take
its
fate
into
its
own
hands
like
canada
the
european
union
is
preparing
against
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
in
line
with
world
trade
organisation
rules
merkel
said
so
we
won
t
let
ourselves
be
ripped
off
again
and
again
instead
we
act
then
too
merkel
said
in
an
unusually
combative
tone
asked
if
she
was
concerned
that
trump
could
retaliate
against
eu
by
imposing
tariffs
on
cars
merkel
said
first
of
all
we
ll
try
and
see
if
we
can
prevent
this
and
then
hope
that
the
eu
will
respond
again
in
the
same
merkel
said
the
leaders
had
agreed
to
review
their
trade
ties
and
assess
the
scope
of
existing
tariffs
in
order
to
avoid
further
trade
barriers
the
leader
said
a
area
among
allies
would
be
an
ideal
outcome
but
she
made
clear
that
any
talks
about
such
a
trade
bloc
would
have
to
include
barriers
to
trade
as
well
as
free
access
to
public
tenders
turning
to
russia
merkel
said
she
could
imagine
moscow
the
format
at
some
point
but
there
first
had
to
be
progress
in
the
implementation
of
the
peace
plan
for
ukraine
russia
was
pushed
out
of
what
was
then
the
after
it
annexed
crimea
from
ukraine
in
merkel
said
she
expected
italy
s
new
coalition
government
to
vote
for
the
extension
of
european
sanctions
against
russia
touching
the
thorny
issue
of
germany
s
relatively
low
defence
spending
merkel
acknowledged
that
trump
s
criticism
was
partly
correct
and
that
berlin
had
to
do
more
to
reach
nato
s
goal
of
spending
to
percent
of
economic
output
on
defence
trump
is
in
a
way
right
and
that
s
why
we
need
to
increase
our
defence
spending
