energy
storage
is
becoming
increasingly
important
as
the
use
of
intermittent
renewable
sources
of
power
grows
combining
wind
solar
and
battery
technology
would
bring
down
cost
of
renewable
energy
and
help
power
grids
balance
supply
and
demand
asian
players
such
as
catl
samsung
and
lg
chem
have
taken
a
lead
in
the

of
uses
including
solar

wind
farms
as
well
as
in
the
shipping
industry
if
mankind

i
expect
europe

have
