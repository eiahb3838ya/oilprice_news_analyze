update 3-sse weighs options as innogy uk retail merger collapses
reuters
sse
and
innogy
scrapped
plans
to
merge
their
british
energy
retail
operations
on
monday
after
the
industry
regulator
proposed
a
cap
on
consumer
bills
leaving
sse
searching
for
new
options
for
its
struggling
business
this
now
at
least
clears
the
way
for
german
utility
to
consolidate
innogy
s
british
npower
division
it
will
receive
as
part
of
a
bigger
breakup
deal
with
innogy
s
parent
rwe
the
plan
more
than
a
year
in
the
making
collapsed
after
the
companies
failed
to
agree
on
new
commercial
terms
in
light
of
the
proposed
cap
on
energy
bills
sse
and
innogy
had
warned
last
month
the
deal
which
would
have
created
britain
s
second
biggest
retail
power
provider
behind
centrica
s
british
gas
would
be
delayed
britain
s
big
six
energy
suppliers
have
been
squeezed
by
efforts
to
cap
energy
bills
following
a
government
promise
to
tackle
prices
the
level
of
the
cap
was
tighter
than
expected
and
the
performance
of
both
companies
retail
businesses
had
changed
since
the
was
first
announced
sse
ceo
alistair
said
during
a
call
with
journalists
as
a
result
the
deal
was
not
in
the
best
interests
of
its
customers
employees
and
shareholders
sse
said
said
sse
would
take
time
to
consider
other
options
for
its
retail
unit
including
a
standalone
demerger
and
listing
an
outright
sale
or
an
alternative
transaction
but
said
no
specific
talks
had
taken
place
with
any
other
potential
buyers
a
source
close
to
the
deal
said
that
for
now
sse
is
more
likely
to
create
a
standalone
retail
business
innogy
cut
its
outlook
for
the
current
year
as
it
will
have
to
consolidate
npower
again
adding
this
would
also
hit
next

npower
has
struggled
among
competition
from
britain
s
near
smaller
energy
suppliers
an
october
report
from
regulator
ofgem
said
the
company
s
margin
for
supply
energy
was
minus
percent
said
the
collapse
of
the
venture
had
no
fundamental
impact
on
a
bigger
breakup
deal
which
will
result
in
it
taking
over
all
of
innogy
s
networks
and
retail
activities
including
npower
and
would
also
not
delay
it
and
fellow
german
utility
rwe
agreed
in
march
to
break
up
innogy
and
share
out
its
assets
a
complex
transaction
that
is
forecast
to
be
completed
by
the
end
of
shares
in
innogy
and
sse
were
all
down
to
percent
at
gmt
analysts
said
abandoning
the
deal
was
a
positive
move
for
sse
we
see
the
options
under
consideration
as
more
optimal
for
sse
than
a
merger
with
a
troublesome
npower
analysts
at
jefferies
said
would
likely
have
to
absorb
npower
and
would
likely
spend
several
painful
years
to
and
integrate
sse
s
latest
talks
with
innogy
covered
the
potential
impact
of
regulatory
caps
on
tariffs
the
new
company
s
requirement
to
post
collateral
against
its
credit
exposure
and
its
ability
to
obtain
and
retain
an
appropriate
credit
rating
these
implications
meant
the
new
company
would
have
faced
very
challenging
market
conditions
particularly
during
the
period
when
it
would
have
incurred
the
bulk
of
the
integration
costs
