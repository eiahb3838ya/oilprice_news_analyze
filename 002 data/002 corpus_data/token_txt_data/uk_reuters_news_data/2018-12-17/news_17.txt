new oil, gas projects to accelerate next year -report
london
reuters
the
number
of
new
oil
and
gas
projects
will
rise
next
year
from
a
trough
but
overall
spending
is
still
unlikely
to
be
enough
to
meet
future
demand
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
in
a
report
shaken
by
a
sharp
drop
in
oil
prices
in
recent
months
boards
are
generally
expected
to
stick
to
spending
discipline
imposed
following
the
price
crash
global
investment
in
oil
and
gas
production
known
as
upstream
is
expected
to
reach
around
billion
next
year
according
to
woodmac
analyst
angus
rodger
that
compares
with
a
total
spending
of
billion
billion
pounds
in
which
dropped
to
billion
in
and
although
spending
levels
have
slightly
recovered
since
then
next
year
s
capital
expenditure
will
still
fall
short
of
the
billion
required
to
meet
demand
growth
and
to
offset
the
natural
decline
of
output
from
fields
rodger
told
reuters
oil
and
gas
spending
a
handful
of
the
world
s
top
oil
companies
including
giants
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
said
they
would
boost
spending
next
year
as
they
accelerate
developments
of
shale
fields
but
overall
companies
will
seek
to
maintain
spending
largely
flat
in
order
to
return
cash
to
investors
after
years
of
pain
rodger
said
still
deep
cost
cuts
introduced
in
recent
years
and
lower
rates
for
drilling
rigs
and
services
mean
that
companies
can
do
more
with
their
money
in
the
number
of
large
new
oil
and
gas
projects
is
expected
to
reach
up
to
compared
with
in
and
around
in
according
to
woodmac
s
outlook
large
projects
hold
over
million
barrels
of
oil
or
gas
equivalent
many
of
the
new
projects
will
be
around
gas
with
a
record
number
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
projects
set
to
get
the
green
light
in
those
include
the
arctic
in
russia
at
least
one
project
in
mozambique
and
three
in
the
united
states
which
would
together
require
billion
according
to
the
report
the
stars
are
aligning
on
lng
sales
contracts
corporate
appetite
demand
and
costs
but
these
are
huge
investments
and
investor
confidence
could
waver
if
we
see
signs
of
cost
inflation
global
recession
and
falling
the
lng
projects
will
target
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
up
from
tcf
in
and
tcf
in
spending
could
see
a
strong
increase
in
if
oil
prices
continue
rising
steadily
and
as
rig
costs
are
expected
to
rise
