the
federal
reserve
is
widely
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
again
at
the
end
of
its
meeting
on

what
matters
more
for
investors
will
be
whether
it
cuts
its
guidance
on
rate
increases
in
the
fed
now
projects
three
more
increases
before
but
recent
weak
data
and
worries
over

protectionist
policies
have
fueled
expectations

central
bank
will
cut
its
guidance
a
final
key
rate
hike
for
is
almost
a
done
deal
but
what
is
more
important
is
how
the
fed

dot
plots
shift
in
and
beyond
if
monetary
policymakers
are
seeing
a
serious
risk
of
economic
slowdown
those
dots

be
pulled
