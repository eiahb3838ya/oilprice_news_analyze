cars
the

law
means
by
around
a
third
of
new
cars
will
be
electric

its
clean

said
that
s
progress
but
it
s
not
fast
enough
to
hit
our

compromise
was
tougher

the
original
eu
executive
proposal
of
an
emissions
decline
of
percent
compared
to
germany
had
endorsed
that
but
a
push
by

and
france
raised
the
target
for
eu

had
wanted
percent
so
in
the
end
they
split
the
difference
the

would
set

demands
while

once
again
our

commitment
to
the
