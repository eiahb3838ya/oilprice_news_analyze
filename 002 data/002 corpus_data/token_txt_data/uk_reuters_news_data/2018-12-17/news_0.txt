santiago

chilean
law
enforcement
officials
are
investigating
the
delivery
of
iranian
crude
oil
to
state
energy
company
enap
as
a
possible
source
of
the
noxious
fumes
that
caused
hundreds
of
people
to
seek
hospital
treatment
in
august
a
prosecutors
office
told
reuters
police
and
prosecutors
raided
enap
s
oil
refinery
and
maritime
port
in
hualpen
and
talcahuano
two
adjoining
towns
miles

south
of
santiago
early
on

enap
confirmed
enrique
pena
a
spokesman
for
the
bio
bio
region
prosecutors
office
said
the
prosecutor
was
examining
whether
there
was
a
link
between
the
company
s
transfer
of
iranian
crude
oil
to
its
refineries
in
hualpen
and
quintero
a
town
miles
km
northeast
of
santiago
with
chemical
intoxications
in
both
areas
at
this
stage
it
as
a
hypothesis
we
are
looking
at
pena
said
a
total
of
people
most
of
them
children
sought
medical
treatment
in
quintero
and
nearby
puchuncavi
in
august
after
residents
reported
a
strong
smell
in
the
air
according
to
health
ministry
figures
seen
by
reuters
the
environment
minister
blamed
a
chemical
leak
and
the
environmental
watchdog
has
said
enap
was
responsible
something
the
company
has
denied
the
bio
bio
prosecutors
office
gave
no
further
details
about
intoxications
it
said
had
also
taken
place
in
august
in
talcahuano
enap
denied
there
was
any
connection
between
the
delivery
of
iranian
crude
on
and
the
noxious
fumes
we
want
to
emphatically
rule
out
any
link
between
the
unloading
and
treatment
of
iranian
crude
oil
with
the
episodes
in
the
city
of
talcahuano
as
well
as
the
emergency
that
happened
in
august
and
september
in
the
quintero
area
enap
said
in
a
statement
the
whole
process
of
picking
up
and
unloading
was
carried
out
in
a
rigorous
and
professional
way
and
with
due
diligence
enap
added
enap
is
the
main
oil
refiner
in
chile
which
imports
nearly
all
the
fuel
it
consumes
the
united
states
reimposed
sanctions
on
iranian
oil
exports
last
month
to
punish
tehran
for
its
involvement
in
several
middle
eastern
conflicts
but
relaxed
restrictions
for
some
of
iran
s
biggest
buyers
china
india
south
korea
japan
italy
greece
taiwan
and
turkey
amid
fears
of
a
price
spike
