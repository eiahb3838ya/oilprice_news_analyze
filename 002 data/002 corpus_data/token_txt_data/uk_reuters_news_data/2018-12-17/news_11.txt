and

bought
the

offshore
field
for
about
billion
billion
pounds
in
a
deal
that
spawned
one
of
the
industry
s
largest
corruption
scandals

is
alleged
that
about
billion
of
the
total
was
siphoned
to
agents
and
middlemen
the
milan

have
been
used

a
role
in
this
matter
and
who
were
circling
their
prey
like
hungry
sharks
judge
giusy
barbara
said
in
her
reasoning
it
was
not
mere
connivance
but
a
conscious
adhesion
to
a
predatory
project
damaging
the
nigerian
state
she
added
she
also
said
money
was
given
to
some
managers
of
eni
the
biggest
foreign
energy
company
in
africa
things
look
even
more
serious
from
an
italian
point
of
view
with
the
involvement
of
the
country
s
leading
company
in
which
the
italian
state
is
the
biggest
shareholder
with
obvious
reputational
damage
for
the
whole
italian
community
she
said
obi
and
di
nardo
have
been
tried
separately
from
eni
and
shell
which
also
face
corruption
allegations
over
the
same
deal
in
a
hearing
that
is
expected
to
drag
on
for
months
eni
said
it
would
analyse
the
judge
s
remarks
noting
that
a
fuller
account
of
the
facts
and
evidence
surrounding
the
deal
would
emerge
only
from
the
main
trial
the
italian
company
has
previously
denied
any
wrongdoing
at
gmt
eni
shares
were
down

while

lower
under

eni
and
shell
jointly
acquired
the
opl
field
from
a
company
owned
by
former
nigerian
oil
minister
dan
etete
who
was
convicted
of
money
laundering
in
an
unrelated
case
in
france
in
shell
said
on
monday
that
neither
obi
nor
di
nardo
had
worked
for
shell
and
that
there
was
no
basis
to
convict
it
or
any
of
its
former
staff
of
alleged
offences
related
to
the
deal
in
her
reasonings
the
judge
said
two

s
bsi
and
lebanon
s
misr
had
sent
money
transferred
to
them
in
the
deal
back
for
compliance
reasons
due
to
etete
s
reputation
eni
chief
executive
claudio
descalzi
and
four
managers
including
former
shell
head
of
upstream
malcolm
brinded
are
also
accused
of
international
corruption
in
the
main
trial
they
have
all
denied
any
wrongdoing
brinded
s
lawyer
referred
requests
for
comment
to
shell
judge
barbara
alleged
that
shell
executives
including
brinded
had
known
that
etete
would
keep
part
of
the
purchase
price
for
himself
and
use
the
rest
to
pay
people
including
nigerian
politicians
and
public
officials
who
had
helped
him
to
take
possession
of
the
field
