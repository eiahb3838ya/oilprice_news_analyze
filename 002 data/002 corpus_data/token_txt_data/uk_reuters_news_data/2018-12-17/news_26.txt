after

close
since

last

on
friday
on
mounting
evidence
of
slowing
growth
in
europe
and
china
china
s
economy
has
been
losing
momentum
in
recent
quarters
as
a
government
campaign
to
curb
shadow
lending
put
increasing
financial
strains
on
companies
in
a
blow
to
production
and
investment
investors
are
now
looking
to
a
major
speech
by
president
xi
jinping
on
tuesday
to
mark
the
anniversary
of
china
s
reform
and
opening
up
china
is
also
expected
to
hold
its
annual
central
economic
work
conference
later
this
week
where
key
growth
targets
and
policy
goals
for
will
be
discussed
the
top
body
of
the
communist
party
the
politburo
said
last
week
china
will
keep
its
economic
growth
within
a
reasonable
range
next
year
striving
to
support
jobs
trade
and
investment
while
pushing
reforms
and
curbing
risks
it
s
generally
assumed
that
you
will
need
to
expand
fiscal
and
monetary
support
to
achieve
those
goals
the
market
sentiment
is
being
supported
by
expectations
that
there
could
be
an
announcement
in
that
direction
after
the
economic
work
conference
said
wang
shenshen
strategist
at
tokai
tokyo
research
in
the
united
states
the
federal
reserve
is
seen
as
almost
certain
to
raise
interest
rates
at
its
policy
meeting
starting
on
tuesday
further
enhancing
the
dollar
s
yield
attraction
at
the
same
time
many
market
players
also
expect
the
fed
to
lower
its
projections
for
future
interest
rate
hikes
given
increasing
headwinds
to
the
economy
you
could
argue
that
if
the
fed
lower
estimates
that
could
be
taken
as
a
further
sign
of
economic
slowdown
said
hirokazu
kabeya
chief
global
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
but
given
the
fragile
market
sentiment
i
would
think
it
would
be
more
dangerous
if
the
fed
sticks
to
the
view
that
it
would
raise
rates

times

dropped

from
its
record
close
the
worst
performance
since
it
fell
more
than
percent
between
may
and
january
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
held
firm
after
having
touched
a
high
against
a
basket
of
six
other
major
rivals
on
friday
as
the
economy
appeared
to
be
in
better
shape

services
rose
percent
last

after
an
upwardly
revised

increase
in

still
some
analysts
said
the
dollar
could
be
held
back
by
the
probability
of
a
partial
government
shutdown
as
president
donald
trump
and
federal
lawmakers
disagree
over
funding
for
a
border
wall

earlier
