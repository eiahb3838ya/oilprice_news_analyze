be
no

and
years

to
help

have
been
scrambling
to
reach
villages
stranded
by
landslides
and
collapsed
roads
tragically
the

earthquake
has
already
claimed
the
lives

an
estimated

be
down

the

said
its

stood
up

out
unscathed
exxonmobil
senior
vice

neil
chapman
told
analysts
in

on

said
the
main
challenge

was
moving

into
the

and
fixing
their
living
quarters
it
s
tough
to
get
people
in
and
out
in
the
highlands
right
now
accommodation
is
a
challenge
infrastructure
is
a
challenge
chapman
said
the
estimate
for
restarting

was
preliminary
he
said
it

be
shorter
