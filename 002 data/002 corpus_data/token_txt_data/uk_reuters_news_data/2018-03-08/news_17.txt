fisheries output to plunge unless global warming reeled in

global
fisheries
output
will
slump
by
percent
by
and
by
percent
in
the
north
atlantic
region
if
governments
fail
to
slow
global
warming
a
team
of
scientists
said
on
thursday
most
studies
of
climate
risks
extend
to
and
overlook
extra
catastrophic
effects
such
as
the
projected
slump
in
ocean
life
that
would
only
emerge
in
coming
centuries
they
said
unchecked
warming
would
thaw
sea
ice
around
antarctica
and
disrupt
ocean
currents
winds
and
the
growth
of
tiny
plankton
the
report
found
worldwide
ever
more
nutrients
would
sink
to
the
ocean
depths
away
from
fish
near
the
surface
marine
ecosystems
worldwide
will
be
increasingly
starved
for
nutrients
lead
author
keith
moore
of
the
university
of
california
irvine
told
reuters
of
the
findings
published
in
the
journal
science
the
shifts
would
cut
the
productivity
of
fisheries
in
by
an
average
percent
and
by
percent
in
the
north
atlantic
where
a
normal
upwelling
of
nutrients
from
deeper
waters
would
be
most
reduced
according
to
computer
simulations
exceptions
would
be
the
southern
ocean
near
antarctica
and
in
the
arctic
ocean
around
the
north
pole
where
higher
temperatures
and
shrinking
ice
allowing
more
sunlight
to
reach
the
water
would
boost
the
growth
of
tiny
plants
moore
said
such
projections
involve
many
uncertainties
but
add
to
existing
concerns
about
more
heat
waves
downpours
and
droughts
that
mainstream
scientists
link
to
a
of
greenhouse
gases
in
the
atmosphere
we
need
to
be
thinking
years
into
the
future
not
years
he
wrote
in
an
email
global
warming
isn
t
a
problem
our
children
can
solve
it
will
be
too
the
study
assumed
greenhouse
gases
will
continue
to
build
up
in
the
atmosphere
boosting
average
surface
temperatures
by
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
by
that
would
be
far
above
goals
set
in
by
almost
nations
under
the
paris
climate
agreement
to
limit
warming
to
well
below
above
times
by
phasing
out
fossil
fuels
this
century
the
report
did
not
factor
in
other
risks
such
as
an
acidification
of
the
oceans
caused
by
the
of
carbon
dioxide
that
could
undermine
the
ability
of
creatures
such
as
lobsters
and
oysters
to
build
protective
shells
charlotte
laufkoetter
a
scientist
at
the
university
of
bern
who
was
not
involved
in
the
study
praised
the
findings
as
based
on
the
best
existing
science
despite
the
difficulty
of
projecting
so
far
into
the
future
there
are
of
course
several
uncertainties
circulation
in
the
southern
ocean
is
very
difficult
to
model
