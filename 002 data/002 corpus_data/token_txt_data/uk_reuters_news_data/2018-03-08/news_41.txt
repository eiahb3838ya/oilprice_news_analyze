after
meeting
his

counterpart
in
london
today
we
have
agreed
to
strengthen
the
inspection
of
shipping
in
order
to
ensure
that
all
yemeni
ports
remain
open

the
humanitarian

people
so
desperately
need

without
providing
details
saudi
arabia
and
its
arab
allies
have
been
stationing
naval
forces
in
and
around
yemeni
waters
since
western
governments
approved
the
show
of
military
force
as
a
way
to
stop
arms
reaching
houthi
fighters
trying
to
overthrow
yemen
s
internationally
recognised
government
the
de
facto
blockade
has
exacted
a
dire
humanitarian
toll
the
coalition
s
ships
have
prevented
essential
supplies
from
entering
yemen
even
in
cases
where
vessels
are
carrying
no
weapons

reported
last
year
the
verification
and
inspection
mechanism
for
yemen
unvim
was
set
up
in
to
ease
delivery
of
commercial
goods
through
the
blockade
but
has
failed
to
ensure
the
yemeni
people
get
the
supplies
they
need
the

dead
london
already
supports
unvim
in
