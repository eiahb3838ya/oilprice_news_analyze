the

on

came
amid
a
crude
inventory
build
that
was
not
as
big
as

during
the
current
seasonal
demand
lull
at
the
end
of
winter
when
many
oil
refineries
shut
down
for

oil
prices
bounced
back
immediately
after
the
release
of
the
weekly
oil
inventories
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
where
the
headline
figure
was
better
than

said
fawad

market
analyst
at

brokerage
the

reported
late
on

that
crude
inventories
rose
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
march
to
million
barrels
less
than
the
million
barrel
increase
analysts
had
forecast
despite
this
oil
markets
remain
under
pressure
from
the
seasonal
trend
of
rising
inventories
which
in
the
united
states
have
climbed
back
above
the
average
of
million
barrels
also
looming
over
oil
markets
is
soaring
production
which
last
week
marked
another
record
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
crude
is
under
pressure
from
rising
production
which
hit
a
new
high
last
week
now
firmly
above
saudi
arabia
s
production
level
said
william
o
loughlin
investment
analyst
at
australia
s
rivkin
securities
at
just
below
million
bpd
only
russia
currently
produces
more
crude
oil
than
the
united
states
although
the
international
energy
agency
iea
expects
even
this
to
change
as
the
united
states
is
set
to
surge
past
million
bpd
by
late
with
output
outpacing
demand
growth
analysts
say
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
russia
who
together
with
some
other
producers
have
been
withholding
production
in
order
to
prop
up
prices
are
under
pressure
to
keep
up
the
supply
restraint
even
at
the
cost
of
market
share
opec
may
have
to
extend
its
production
agreement
with
russia
and
co
in
order
to
avoid
triggering
another
in

prices
