in

abroad
will
have
to
book
transmission

be
able
to
send
gas
to
poland
in
case
of
emergency
the
conditions
to
fulfil
the
obligation
by
storing
gas
abroad
in
practice
make
such
storage
less
attractive
and
more
cumbersome
than
storing
in
poland
the
european
commission
said
in
a
statement
the
commission
is
of
the
view
that
the
polish
gas
storage
obligation
is
incompatible
with
the
eu
measures
to
safeguard
the
security
of
gas
poland
once
viewed
as
a
champion
of
democratic
change
after
the
fall
of
communism
has
been
locked
in
disputes
with
brussels
since
the
ruling
nationalist
law
and
justice
pis
party
came
to
power
in
over
issues
ranging
from
immigration
and
environment
to
the
country

rule
of
law
poland
s
energy
ministry
played
down
the
commission
s
concerns
saying
they
were
part
of
a
routine
analysis
of
compliance
of
national
laws
with
eu
regulations
the
minister
of
energy
positively
assesses
the
functioning
of
the
current
system
of
security
of
supplies
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
on
its
website
the
recent
law
changes
have
positively
affected
the
level
of
energy
some
smaller
polish
players
in
the
gas
market
have
criticised
the
bill
saying
it
is
unfair
and
will
result
in
gas
prices
rising
in
poland
should
poland
fail
to
address
the
eu
concerns
the
commission
may
decide
to
send
a
reasoned
opinion
which
would
take
the
infringement
procedures
further
and
could
end
in
referring
the
case
to
the
european
court
of
justice
