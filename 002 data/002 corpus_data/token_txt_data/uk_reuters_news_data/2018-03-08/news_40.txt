eu and asset managers clash over "sustainable" investing plan
london
reuters
the
european
union
has
proposed
making
it
a
formal
requirement
for
asset
managers
to
consider
sustainability
when
picking
investments
a
move
the
eu
s
trillion
euro
trillion
funds
industry
swiftly
dismissed
as
a
exercise
the
eu
wants
more
money
going
into
sustainable
and
green
projects
that
help
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
as
part
of
a
wider
capital
markets
union
project
to
expand
funding
from
financial
markets
for
companies
and
growth
in
an
action
plan
published
on
thursday
the
european
commission
said
it
would
clarify
the
duty
of
asset
managers
and
big
investors
to
ensure
they
take
sustainability
into
account
in
the
process
of
investing
the
european
fund
and
asset
management
association
said
it
did
not
believe
such
legislation
was
needed
because
investment
in
sustainable
projects
had
to
be
driven
by
the
owners
of
the
assets
being
invested
any
mandatory
sustainability
requirement
especially
regarding
investments
would
turn
environmental
social
and
governance
into
a
tick
the
box
compliance
exercise
efama
said
pensionseurope
which
represents
national
pensions
trade
bodies
said
the
eu
s
proposals
needed
to
be
flexible
so
as
to
avoid
upsetting
the
role
of
trustees
or
social
partners
pension
funds
main
purpose
will
continue
to
be
serving
the
best
interests
of
their
members
and
to
delivering
adequate
pensions
at
low
costs
it
said
the
eu
s
proposal
also
includes
plans
for
a
checklist
of
what
qualifies
as
a
climate
friendly
and
sustainable
activities
definitions
which
could
be
used
for
creating
eu
labels
for
green
financial
products
the
commission
will
also
look
at
how
banks
and
insurers
could
benefit
from
lower
capital
charges
if
they
invested
in
green
projects
the
commission
has
retreated
from
an
initial
plan
to
go
ahead
with
implementing
these
reductions
after
opposition
from
an
advisory
panel
and
central
bankers
who
were
worried
about
a
green
bubble
being
created
markus
ferber
a
member
of
the
european
parliament
which
will
have
final
say
on
the
proposals
said
the
eu
should
focus
on
keeping
alive
the
bloc
s
capital
markets
project
given
that
britain
the
eu
s
biggest
market
is
leaving
what
we
need
is
bold
initiatives
tackling
obstacles
in
tax
and
insolvency
law
and
measures
that
facilitate
capital
market
financing
by
smaller
companies
ferber
said
sustainable
finance
however
is
only
a
diversion
from
the
fact
that
one
of
the
commission
s
flagship
projects
is
about
to
tank
he
said
referring
to
slow
progress
with
efforts
to
create
a
capital
market
that
can
provide
financing
for
businesses
