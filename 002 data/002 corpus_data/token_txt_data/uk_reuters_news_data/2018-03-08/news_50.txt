toxic particle linked to diesel kills 6,000 a year in germany - agency
berlin
reuters
some
early
deaths
linked
to
nitrogen
oxides
nox
are
recorded
each
year
in
germany
the
federal
environmental
agency
said
on
thursday
providing
more
evidence
of
the
health
hazards
posed
by
the
toxic
particles
mostly
produced
by
diesel
engines
the
figure
is
likely
to
add
pressure
on
carmakers
and
the
government
as
they
scramble
to
slow
the
demise
of
the
diesel
technology
in
which
germany
s
car
industry
invested
billions
the
environmental
agency
uba
also
said
that
nox
causes
one
million
people
to
fall
ill
each
year
and
that
levels
of
the
toxic
particle
are
higher
in
cities
than
the
limit
set
under
air
quality
standards
the
car
industry
has
relied
on
diesel
as
a
stopgap
technology
to
boost
efficiency
meet
emissions
goals
and
buy
time
for
a
shift
toward
electric
mobility
but
sales
of
diesel
cars
have
been
falling
since
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
on
emissions
tests
subsequent
studies
have
exposed
the
true
levels
of
nox
which
is
emitted
more
abundantly
by
diesel
vehicles
than
petrol
engines
a
german
court
ruled
last
month
that
german
cities
can
ban
the
most
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
from
their
streets
a
decision
that
could
accelerate
the
demise
of
the
combustion
engine
