the

awaited
more
clarity
on
president
donald
trump
s
plan
to
impose
import

while
the
ecb
took
a
small
step
toward
weaning
the

off
protracted
stimulus
by
dropping
its
easing
bias
ecb
president
mario
draghi
said

policy
would
remain
reactive
and
that
underlying
inflation
was
subdued

down

while
the

index
rose

they
toned
down
the
easing
bias
but
there
is
still
a
willingness
to
ease
and
the
tone
of
draghi
s
comments
was
still
dovish
stressing
that
there
is
still
not
a
