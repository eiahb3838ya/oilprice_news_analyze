relative
calm
returned
to
global
markets
on
thursday
as
traders
took
a
brief
break
from
worrying
about
a
global
trade
war
and
focused
back
on
how
fast
the
european
central
bank
will
end
its
trillion
euro
stimulus
programme
both
european
and
asian
share
markets
edged
higher
the
former
for
a
fourth
day
after
president
donald
trump
s
push
to
introduce
protectionist
tariffs
was
tempered
by
signs
he
could
spare
some
key
trade
partners
germany
s
dax
and
the
euro
both
lingered
in
the
red

as
a
drop

caution
after
the
weekend
s
inconclusive
italian
election
it
may
all
argue
for
a
more
neutral
message
from
ecb
chief
mario
draghi
later
markets
are
on
high
alert
for
any
signal
on
when
it
will
end
more
than
three
years
of
unprecedented
money
printing
they
have
stretched
out
the
buying
cycle
and
that
made
sense
to
us

of
the
global
portfolio
solutions
group
for
emea
and
asia
pacific
at
goldman
sachs
asset
management
we
would
expect
them
to
end
purchases
this
year
but
we
think
they
will
still
stay
flexible
if
there
is
any
change
to
the
growth
picture
in
highlighting
the
strength
of
the
global
economy
chinese
data
showed
both
exports
and
imports
rose
more
than
percent
in
the
first
two
months
of
this
year
from
a
year
earlier
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
stabilised
against
other
major
currencies
after
its
recent
hit
from
fears
about
the
tariff
plan
while
the
mexican
peso
and
canadian
dollar
recovered
from
their
steep
losses
the
euro
traded
flat
at
having
risen
to
on
wednesday
its
highest
levels
since
the
currency
has
been
rising
since
it
hit
a
low
of
hit
on
thursday
when
trump
unveiled
his
tariff
plan
bond
markets
were
also
broadly
steady
with
treasuries
stuck
at
percent
and
germany
s
benchmark
bond
yield
barely
budged
at
percent
having
hit
a
low
of

on
monday
the
ecb
will
publish
new
forecasts
for
its
main
target
of
euro
zone
inflation
and
for
growth
later
which
will
feed
the
debate
on
its
end
to
stimulus
in
asia

broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
had
risen
percent
while
in
japan

kong
s
hang
seng
led
the
region
with
rise
of
percent
after
china
s
surprisingly
strong
trade
data
on
wall
street
the

p
ended
down
just
percent
at
after
an
initial
loss
of
almost
one
percent
with
tech
shares
being
a
major
bright
spot
they
erased
most
losses
as
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
told
a
media
briefing
that
the
impending
hefty
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
could
exclude
canada
mexico
and
a
clutch
of
other
countries
that
soothed
worries
about
the
prospect
of
more
aggressive
trade
measures
after
the
departure
of
trump
s
top
economic
adviser
gary
cohn
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
said
the
issue
would
continue
to
hang
over
markets
however
investors
need
to
see
exactly
what
steps
trump
will
take
and
what
retaliatory
actions
other
countries
will
take
in
coming
trump
was
expected
to
sign
a
presidential
proclamation
to
establish
the
tariffs
during
a
ceremony
on

said

could
slide
into
friday

be
cleared
through
a
legal
process

trump
puts

place
the
measures
