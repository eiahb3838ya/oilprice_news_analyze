steinitz
told
reuters
the
pipeline
which
will
cross
from
israel
and
cyprus
into
greece
and
italy
in
deep

major
milestone
for
the
rapidly

in
the
levantine

in
the
east
corner
of
the
mediterranean
offering
access
to
a
large
market
the
european
union
considers

as
extremely
competitive
as
the
four
partner
countries
continue
construction
plans
for
the
technically
complex
line
steinitz
told
reuters
late
on

on
the

this

we
will
reach
a
detailed
agreement
between
the
four
founding
states
of
the

and
at
the
beginning
of
we
hope

investment
decision
he

more
than
bcm
of
gas
have
been
discovered
offshore
israel
while
cyprus
aphrodite
gas
field
holds
an
additional
bcm
both
areas
are
expected
to
hold
more
reserves
israel
where
gas
consumption
has
risen
sharply
over
the
past
decade
will
have
to
bcm
available
to
export
steinitz
said
the
vast
amounts
of
gas
discovered
since
the
early
in
israel
have
transformed
the
region
s
economic
reality
as
it
signed
a
number
of
deals
to
sell
natural
gas
to
neighbors
jordan
and
egypt
israel
is
also
considering
the
construction
of
a
pipeline
to
turkey
where
gas
demand
is
rapidly
growing
although
the
project
appears
to
have
stalled
in
recent
years
amid
political
tensions
between
the
two
countries
we
can
export
to
egypt
jordan
and
turkey
and
still
have
enough
extra
gas
for
the
pipeline
he
said
israel
plans
to
launch
this
summer
a
new
auction
for
to
exploration
offshore
blocks
to
trigger
the
development
of
further
gas
resources
steinitz
said
an
auction
late
last
year
nevertheless
attracted
limited
interest
with
greece
s
energean
and
a
consortium
of
indian
companies
picking
up
blocks
in
a
sign
of
israel
s
growing
efforts
to
attract
foreign
investors
into
the
budding
energy
industry
the
country
recently
opened
an
economic
mission
in
houston
