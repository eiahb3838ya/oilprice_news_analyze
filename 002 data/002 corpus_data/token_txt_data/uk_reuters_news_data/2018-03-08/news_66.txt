tepco's "ice wall" fails to freeze fukushima's toxic water buildup

a
costly
ice
wall
is
failing
to
keep
groundwater
from
seeping
into
the
stricken
fukushima
nuclear
plant
data
from
operator
tokyo
electric
power
co
shows
preventing
it
from
removing
radioactive
melted
fuel
at
the
site
seven
years
after
the
disaster
when
the
ice
wall
was
announced
in
tepco
assured
sceptics
that
it
would
limit
the
flow
of
groundwater
into
the
plant
s
basements
where
it
mixes
with
highly
radioactive
debris
from
the
site
s
reactors
to
nearly
however
since
the
ice
wall
became
fully
operational
at
the
end
of
august
an
average
of
metric
tonnes
a
day
of
water
has
seeped
into
the
reactor
and
turbine
areas
more
than
the
average
of
metric
tonnes
a
day
during
the
prior
nine
months
a
reuters
analysis
of
the
tepco
data
showed
the
groundwater
seepage
has
delayed
tepco
s
at
the
site
and
may
undermine
the
entire
decommissioning
process
for
the
plant
which
was
battered
by
a
tsunami
seven
years
ago
this
sunday
waves
knocked
out
power
and
triggered
meltdowns
at
three
of
the
site
s
six
reactors
that
spewed
radiation
forcing
residents
to
flee
many
of
whom
have
not
returned
to
this
coast
though
called
an
ice
wall
tepco
has
attempted
to
create
something
more
like
a
frozen
soil
barrier
using
billion
yen
million
in
public
funds
tepco
sunk
about
tubes
filled
with
brine
to
a
depth
of
metres
feet
in
a
perimeter
around
four
of
the
plant
s
reactors
it
then
cools
the
brine
to
minus
degrees
celsius
minus
fahrenheit
the
aim
is
to
freeze
the
soil
into
a
solid
mass
that
blocks
groundwater
flowing
from
the
hills
west
of
the
plant
to
the
coast
however
the
continuing
seepage
has
created
vast
amounts
of
toxic
water
that
tepco
must
pump
out
decontaminate
and
store
in
tanks
at
fukushima
that
now
number
holding
million
tonnes
it
says
it
will
run
out
of
space
by
early
i
believe
the
ice
wall
was
oversold
in
that
it
would
solve
all
the
release
and
storage
concerns
said
dale
klein
the
former
chairman
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
the
head
of
an
external
committee
advising
tepco
on
safety
issues
the
hydrology
of
the
fukushima
site
is
very
complicated
and
thus
the
exact
water
flow
is
hard
to
predict
he
said
especially
during
heavy
graphic
water
seepage
flows
at
fukushima
the
water
inflows
often
fluctuate
with
rainfall
the
dry
month
of
january
averaged
tons
a
day
tepco
data
showed
but
when
a
typhoon
struck
during
the
last
week
of
october
tons
a
day
poured
into
the
reactors
overall
tepco
says
a
combination
of
drains
pumps
and
the
ice
wall
has
cut
water
flows
by
from
tons
a
day
during
the
december
to
february
period
to
an
average
of
tons
a
day
for
december
to
february
it
is
hard
to
measure
exactly
how
much
the
ice
wall
is
contributing
tepco
officials
say
but
based
on
computer
analysis
the
utility
estimates
the
barrier
is
reducing
water
flows
by
about
tonnes
a
day
compared
to
two
years
ago
before
the
barrier
was
operating
our
assessment
is
that
the
ice
wall
has
been
effective
said
naohiro
masuda
tepco
s
chief
decommissioning
officer
adding
that
rain
falling
within
the
ice
wall
perimeter
contributed
to
surging
volumes
we
now
believe
we
have
a
system
in
place
to
manage
the
water
however
a
panel
on
wednesday
offered
a
mixed
assessment
of
the
ice
wall
saying
it
was
partially
effective
but
more
steps
were
needed
controlling
the
groundwater
seepage
using
the
ice
wall
has
been
central
to
japan
s
program
to
show
it
had
the
fukushima
decommissioning
in
hand
the
barrier
was
announced
just
days
before
tokyo
won
the
bid
to
host
the
summer
olympics
and
prime
minister
shinzo
abe
declared
that
fukushima
was
under
control
in
his
final
pitch
to
the
international
olympic
committee
in
addition
to
the
building
costs
the
ice
wall
needs
an
estimated
million
kilowatt
hours
of
electricity
a
year
to
run
enough
to
power

typical

meanwhile
tepco
must
decide
how
to
cope
with
the
growing
volume
of
water
stored
on
site
the
purification
process
removes
radioactive
elements
from
the
contaminated
water
but
it
leaves
tritium
a
mildly
radioactive
element
that
is
difficult
to
separate
from
water
not
considered
harmful
in
low
doses
tritium
is
released
into
oceans
and
rivers
by
nuclear
plants
around
the
world
at
various
national
standard
levels
but
local
residents
particularly
fishermen
oppose
ocean
releases
because
they
fear
it
will
keep
consumers
from
buying
fukushima
products
many
countries
including
south
korea
and
china
still
have
restrictions
on
produce
from
fukushima
and
neighbouring
areas
a
task
force
is
examining
five
options
for
disposing
of
the
water
including
ocean
releases
though
no
decision
has
been
made
ken
buesseler
a
radiochemist
at
the
woods
hole
oceanographic
institution
in
the
united
states
suggests
that
tepco
should
open
the
tanks
to
external
inspections
to
see
if
the
water
is
safe
from
the
public
s
viewpoint
i
think
they
d
want
a
bit
of
independent
confirmation
buesseler
said
it
s
no
harder
and
a
lot
cheaper
than
building
an
ice
