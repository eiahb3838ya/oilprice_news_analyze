the
white
house
has
made
preliminary
plans
for
a
meeting
on
monday
between
rivals
in
the
corn
and
oil
industries
to
discuss
potential
changes
to
the
nation
s
biofuels
policy
two
sources
familiar
with
the
planning
told
reuters
unlike
previous
meetings
on
the
issue
president
donald
trump
will
not
be
in
attendance
the
sources
said
on
thursday
though
agency
leaders
and
executives
from
the
oil
and
corn
industry
will
participate
and
key
lawmakers
may
also
attend
trump
is
expected
to
be
traveling
early
next
week
a

the
meeting
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
talks
between
big
corn
and
big
oil
arranged
by
the
white
house
since
late
last
year
amid
rising
concern
over
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
mix
biofuels
such
as
ethanol
into
their
fuel
the
battle
between
the
oil
industry
and
corn
growers
pits
two
traditionally
republican
constituencies
against
each
other
they
are
both
now
promoting
their
views
to
a
republican
president
over
a
program
started
under
the
administration
of
president
george
bush
that
was
designed
to
help
farmers
and
reduce
petroleum
imports
the
rfs
currently
requires
refiners
to
cover
the
cost
of
blending
increasing
volumes
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
each
year
to
prove
compliance
refiners
must
earn
or
purchase
tradable
blending
credits
known
as
rins
the
price
of
which
has
skyrocketed
in
recent
years
last
week
trump
supported
a
approach
to
reducing
credit
costs
that
had
the
backing
of
refiners
but
faced
resistance
from
the
corn
industry
which
supports
the
current
form
of
the
law
reuters
reported
the
plan
included
a
cap
on
credit
prices
as
well
as
a
concession
to
the
ethanol
industry
that
would
allow
blended
gasoline
to
be
sold
something
advocates
said
could
drive
down
credit
prices
in
the
long
term
