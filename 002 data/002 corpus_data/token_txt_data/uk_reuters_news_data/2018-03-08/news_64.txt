oslo
reuters
the
ethics
watchdog
for
norway
s
sovereign
wealth
may
blacklist
more
companies
that
produce
too
much
greenhouse
gas
by
scrutinising
more
industry
sectors
including
shipping
and
power
carbon
emissions
became
a
criteria
for
exclusion
from
the
fund
in
and
last
year
the
watchdog
recommended
that
a
small
handful
of
firms
be
excluded
from
the
fund
for
producing
too
much
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
either
the
oil
cement
and
steel
industries
those
recommendations
are
currently
under
review
with
the
board
of
the
central
bank
which
oversees
the
fund
and
a
public
announcement
is
expected
soon
the
bank
s
governor
told
reuters
on
johan
andresen
chair
of
the
fund
s
publicly
appointed
council
on
ethics
said
the
watchdog
would
look
at
more
firms
in
the
energy
steel
and
concrete
industries
and
add
more
sectors
including
shipping
and
power
producers
speaking
in
an
interview
ahead
of
publication
of
the
council
s
annual
report
on
thursday
he
said
i
expect
there
will
be
more
companies
recommended
for
exclusions
based
on
the
climate
shipping
and
power
producers
are
among
the
sectors
we
may
be
looking
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
was
created
from
the
proceeds
of
norway
s
oil
industry
and
operates
under
ethical
guidelines
set
by
parliament
it
owns
shares
in
companies
percent
of
the
world
s
listed
equity
so
its
decisions
to
drop
or
reinstate
companies
from
its
investments
carry
considerable
weight
among
investors
andresen
said
a
company
that
is
a
big
emitter
of
climate
gases
must
show
what
plans
it
has
to
cut
emissions
by
to
remain
in
the
fund
s
portfolio
revealing
for
the
first
time
what
factors
the
watchdog
takes
into
account
if
they
are
very
big
emitters
of
greenhouse
gas
on
an
aggregate
level
and
they
are
worst
in
class
they
will
really
have
to
move
said
the
norwegian
who
also
owns
private
investment
vehicle
ferd
they
will
need
to
have
very
credible
plans
to
reduce
emissions
that
they
have
said
they
are
going
to
do
not
only
to
us
but
to
their
the
fund
itself
has
proposed
dropping
oil
and
gas
stocks
from
its
benchmark
index
which
if
accepted
would
mean
the
fund
would
cut
stakes
in
oil
and
gas
companies
over
time
the
proposal
is
currently
under
review
at
norway
s
finance
ministry
and
will
be
voted
on
by
parliament
at
a
later
date
even
if
it
goes
ahead
the
ethics
watchdog
will
still
have
plenty
of
high
polluters
to
examine
it
would
reduce
the
number
of
suspects
we
are
looking
at
but
i
don
t
think
we
will
be
out
of
work
said
andresen
he
declined
to
name
specific
companies
the
fund
has
also
been
looking
at
blacklisting
companies
because
of
corruption
risks
one
is
brazil
s
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
which
is
on
a
watch
list
for
possible
exclusion
in
the
future
if
the
ethics
watchdog
deems
there
is
a
risk
of
corruption
in
january
petrobras
agreed
to
pay
billion
to
settle
a
class
action
corruption
lawsuit
the
fund
held
a
percent
stake
in
petrobras
worth
million
at
according
to
fund
data
andresen
said
that
while
there
were
parts
of
petrobras
that
were
trying
to
change
their
practice
to
a
more
sustainable
one
an
inherent
challenge
was
the
practice
of
changing
petrobras
board
members
whenever
a
new
government
came
to
power
it
is
going
to
take
some
time
for
companies
to
understand
that
they
must
adhere
to
these
compliance
practices
which
minority
shareholders
or
other
shareholders
expect
and
which
is
the
basis
for
which
they
are
listed
he
said
the
watchdog
has
an
ongoing
evaluation
under
the
watch
list
scheme
he
said
we
will
just
have
to
decide
what
kind
of
risk
that
entails
and
whether
it
makes
it
petrobras
more
or
less
likely
to
be
engaged
in
gross
corruption
in
the
the
fund
s
ethics
procedure
was
launched
at
the
start
of
the
millennium
and
companies
are
presently
excluded
on
recommendations
by
the
council
on
ethics
on
various
grounds
another
companies
are
excluded
directly
by
the
central
bank
based
on
their
dependence
on
thermal
coal
the
fund
gradually
sells
shares
in
any
company
it
wishes
to
drop
before
any
announcement
is
made
the
main
aim
is
to
remove
the
ethical
risk
the
fund
is
forbidden
by
law
from
investing
in
companies
that
produce
nuclear
weapons
or
landmines
or
are
involved
in
human
rights
violations
among
other
criteria
this
year
andresen
said
the
ethics
panel
would
definitely
make
a
recommendation
for
exclusion
due
to
the
risk
of
corruption
and
was
working
actively
on
recommending
exclusions
regarding
human
rights
violations
in
the
textile
industry
in
asia
he
also
anticipated
there
could
be
more
recommendations
against
shipping
companies
for
the
practice
of
beaching
running
old
vessels
aground
to
be
picked
apart
by
manual
labour
the
fund
excluded
four
shippers
on
these
grounds
in
january
