oil and corn tout dueling studies on future of u.s. biofuel program
new
york
reuters
big
oil
and
big
corn
are
touting
opposing
studies
released
this
week
on
proposed
biofuels
policy
reforms
under
consideration
by
the
trump
administration
part
of
an
ongoing
clash
between
the
two
sides
over
the
future
of
the
program
valero
energy
corp
a
major
oil
refiner
funded
a
study
by
charles
river
associates
that
supports
placing
a
cap
on
the
price
of
biofuel
blending
credits
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
a
change
meant
to
help
refiners
that
complain
the
rfs
now
costs
them
a
fortune
a
rival
report
from
iowa
state
university
also
released
this
week
said
such
a
cap
on
credits
would
backfire
by
eroding
demand
for
ethanol
and
potentially
lowering
corn
prices
already
under
pressure
from
a
supply
glut
the
corn
industry
did
not
directly
fund
the
iowa
state
study
but
does
provide
funding
to
the
university
the
studies
are
meant
to
inform
the
administration
s
deliberations
on
how
and
if
to
reform
the
rfs
which
has
become
a
major
point
of
tension
between
two
of
president
donald
trump
s
most
important
constituencies
the
rfs
requires
oil
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
mainly
ethanol
into
the
fuel
supply
each
year
or
buy
the
renewable
fuel
credits
called
rins
from
other
companies
that
do
the
blending
the
regulation
was
introduced
during
the
administration
of
president
george
bush
to
help
farmers
cut
petroleum
imports
and
improve
air
quality
but
a
surge
in
the
price
of
rins
in
recent
years
has
upset
merchant
refiners
who
say
the
policy
now
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
trump
waded
deeply
into
the
debate
last
week
urging
representatives
of
both
sides
to
accept
a
compromise
deal
that
caps
prices
for
the
credits
while
also
removing
seasonal
limits
on
blend
gasolines
to
expand
the
biofuels
market
a
cap
would
control
costs
for
small
refiners
and
help
them
stay
afloat
said
brendan
williams
vice
president
of
government
relations
for
refining
company
pbf
energy
the
biofuels
industry
likes
the
idea
of
expanding
blend
gasoline
sales
but
has
pushed
back
on
the
idea
of
a
cap
the
rfs
is
a
program
said
brooke
coleman
head
of
the
advanced
biofuels
business
council
part
of
the
whole
mechanism
working
is
that
the
price
of
rins
may
go
up
and
so
you
should
go
long
on
it
s
a
strategy
to
kill
the
rfs
and
to
kill
the
economic
incentive
to
blend
said
coleman
referring
to
a
cap
trump
has
not
pushed
a
particular
price
level
for
the
proposed
rin
price
cap
but
republican
senator
ted
cruz
of
texas
an
advocate
for
the
refining
industry
has
called
for
a
limit
of
cents
per
rin
a
fraction
of
their
current
value
the
iowa
state
study
said
such
a
cap
would
translate
to
percent
less
ethanol
blending
in
and
without
an
increase
in
exports
that
would
mean
a
drop
in
corn
prices
too
the
study
on
the
other
hand
said
a
price
cap
could
alleviate
several
of
the
most
pressing
issues
with
the
rfs
while
also
continuing
to
incentivize
investment
in
ethanol
blending
in
january
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
blamed
its
bankruptcy
on
rins
bad
deals
and
large
investor
payouts
also
played
key
roles
in
its
collapse
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
biofuel
manufacturers
sent
an
open
letter
to
trump
urging
him
to
protect
the
program
the
letter
came
as
a
delegation
of
refinery
workers
held
meetings
with
lawmakers
urging
changes
to
the
rfs
