the

those

a
columnist

it
s
safe
to
dismiss
any
impression
that
china
s
imports
of
major
commodities
such
as
crude
oil
and
iron
ore
were
weak
in
february
despite
the
numbers
suggesting
as
much
the
timing
of
the
lunar
new
year
holiday
usually
affects
when
imports
are
counted
as
having
arrived
in
the
world
s
largest
buyer
of
commodities
this
year
the
holiday
fell
entirely
in
february
likely
resulting
in
a
of
the
counting
of
imports
into
january
meaning
february
s
arrivals
appear
weaker
than
they
should
crude
oil
imports
in
february
were
million
tonnes
china
customs
said
on
thursday
equivalent
to
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
looks
like
a
massive
drop
from
january
s
million
bpd
which
was
the
strongest
month
on
record
putting
the
first
two
months
of
together
however
gives
an
import
rate
of
about
million
bpd
up
a
fairly
strong
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
it
s
a
similar
story
for
iron
ore
with
february
imports
plunging
percent
to
million
tonnes
from
january
s
million
which
was
the
month
on
record
again
taking
the
first
two
months
together
gives
an
import
total
of
million
tonnes
up
percent
on
the
same
period
last
year
and
port
data
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
tends
to
be
less
lumpy
than
the
official
customs
data
with
the
numbers
showing
january
arrivals
of
million
tonnes
of
iron
ore
and
february
pegged
at
million
giving
a
total
of
million
the
shipping
data
doesn
t
exactly
align
with
customs
data
as
it
doesn
t
include
any
iron
ore
china
imports
that
come
overland
such
as
from
neighbouring
mongolia
coal
imports
were
another
area
of
strength
in
the
first
two
months
of
rising
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
to
million
tonnes
despite
on
the
surface
looking
weak
after
they
dropped
percent
in
february
from
january
imports
of
unwrought
copper
also
dropped
in
february
falling
percent
from
january
to
tonnes
similar
to
other
major
commodities
though
the
copper
imports
were
quite
robust
on
a
basis
having
increased
by
percent
in
the
period
this
year
compared
to
the
same
period
in
the
conclusion
can
only
be
that
china
s
appetite
for
imported
commodities
remains
robust
and
consistent
with
the
current
narrative
of
an
economy
that
is
performing
fairly
well
notwithstanding
areas
of
concern
such
as
credit
quality
a
further
sign
of
this
is
steel
product
exports
one
of
the
few
areas
of
genuine
weakness
in
the
chinese
commodity
complex
steel
product
exports
are
down
percent
to
million
tonnes
in
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
compared
to
the
same
period
a
year
ago
this
is
largely
a
reflection
of
a
tighter
domestic
market
in
the
wake
of
enforced
closures
of
some
blast
furnaces
over
winter
as
part
of
measures
to
reduce
air
pollution
but
it
also
shows
that
domestic
steel
prices
are
high
enough
to
keep
what
is
being
produced
within
the
local
market
china
s
steel
exports
have
been
trending
lower
in
recent
months
having
slumped
percent
in
this
fact
sits
somewhat
uncomfortably
with
president
donald
trump
s
planned
new
percent
tariff
on
imports
with
china
s
exports
cited
by
his
administration
as
one
of
the
reasons
behind
the
decision
trump
is
on
somewhat
safer
ground
with
his
planned
percent
import
tariff
on
aluminium
given
china
s
exports
of
unwrought
aluminium
and
products
have
surged
percent
to
tonnes
in
the
first
two
months
of
from
the
same
period
last
year
