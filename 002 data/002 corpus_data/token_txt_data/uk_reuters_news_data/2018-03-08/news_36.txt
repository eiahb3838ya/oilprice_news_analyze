an
agreement
for
finland
s
fortum
to
buy
a
percent
stake
in
german
energy
group
uniper
from
could
face
intense
scrutiny
in
russia
uniper
s
chief
executive
klaus
schaefer
told
journalists
on
thursday
fortum
has
committed
to
seek
regulatory
approval
for
the
deal
from
relevant
jurisdictions
including
russia
by
at
the
latest
according
to
official
offer
documents
securing
approval
in
russia
where
uniper
operates
several
power
plants
could
be
challenging
schaefer
said
pointing
to
a
law
that
effectively
prohibits
foreign
states
or
entities
from
gaining
control
over
assets
deemed
as
strategic
and
that
is
the
case
for
our
activities
schaefer
said
this
law
has
a
high
relevance
and
therefore
you
have
to
consider
how
such
an
approval
could
look
like
or
a
fortum
spokeswoman
said
the
finnish
company
had
filed
for
merger
approval
in
russia
as
well
as
approval
under
the
russian
strategic
investment
act
and
expects
both
applications
to
be
s
federal
antimonopoly
service
in
october
voiced
concern
about
the
deal
which
would
involve
the
purchase
of
more
than
percent
of
uniper
s
russian
assets
fortum
was
offered
only
percent
of
uniper
shares
in
a
tender
that
expired
in
february
on
top
of
a
percent
stake
it
negotiated
separately
with
after
uniper
s
management
advised
shareholders
not
to
tender
their
shares
uniper
fought
against
the
bid
saying
it
was
hostile
and
too
low
and
that
the
combination
would
make
little
sense
given
its
heavy
exposure
to
gas
and
power
plants
while
fortum
s
focus
is
on
clean
technologies
separately
fortum
said
some
of
its
own
investors
had
complained
the
uniper
deal
would
raise
the
company
s
carbon
footprint
and
had
also
voiced
scepticism
over
the
involvement
in
building
the
nord
stream
pipeline
for
russian
gas
many
stakeholders
such
as
sri
socially
responsible
investors
have
contacted
fortum
to
discuss
the
bid
the
main
concern
has
been
the
strategic
fit
of
uniper
s
production
with
fortum
assets
it
said
the
company
defended
its
plans
however
arguing
conventional
energy
production
was
still
needed
to
ensure
affordable
security
of
supply
in
europe
fortum
acknowledges
that
not
only
the
use
of
coal
but
also
the
origin
of
coal
is
a
source
of
concern
to
some
stakeholders
uniper
is
much
more
than
a
coal
company
it
said
while
fortum
supports
a
of
power
generated
from
coal
this
should
be
achieved
within
the
european
union
s
emissions
trading
scheme
