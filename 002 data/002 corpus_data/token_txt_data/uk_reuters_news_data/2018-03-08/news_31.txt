the
euro
dropped
on
thursday
as
the
european
central
bank
signalled
caution
on
inflation
and
protectionism
while
world
stock
markets
edged
higher
as
president
donald
trump
vowed
flexibility
with
his
plan
to
impose
steep
import
tariffs
while
the
ecb
took
a
small
step
towards
weaning
the
euro
zone
economy
off
protracted
stimulus
by
dropping
its
easing
bias
ecb
president
mario
draghi
said
monetary
policy
would

they
toned
down
the
easing
bias
but
there
is
still
a
willingness
to
ease
and
the
tone
of
draghi
s
comments
was
still
dovish
stressing
that
there
is
still
not
a
convincing
uptrend
in
inflation

addressed
the

wonders

he
prepared
for
a

anything
that
would

roll
back
from
the
tariffs
is
viewed
as
positive
