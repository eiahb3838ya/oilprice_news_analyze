march
reuters
lebanon
and
israel
have
been
holding
talks
nearly
every
day
over
a
border
dispute
that
has
raised
tensions
between
the
two
enemy
states
according
to
the
peacekeeping
force
on
the
frontier
that
is
mediating
their
discussions
there
is
a
full
engagement
from
all
the
sides
and
there
have
been
meetings
almost
on
a
daily
basis
the
dialogue
is
open
no
one
has
ever
walked
out
from
these
meetings
said
andrea
tenenti
spokesman
for
the
united
nations
interim
force
in
lebanon
unifil
tensions
have
spiked
recently
over
an
israeli
border
wall
lebanese
offshore
energy
exploration
and
the
growing
arsenal
of
lebanon
s
hezbollah
group
which
israel
sees
as
the
biggest
threat
on
its
frontier
lebanon
israel
and
unifil
were
already
holding
talks
every
few
weeks
in
a
building
on
the
border
near
the
peacekeepers
base
at
naqoura
in
southern
lebanon
they
are
now
being
held
more
often
tenenti
said
along
with
indirect
talks
conducted
through
unifil
israel
is
building
a
border
wall
near
the
blue
line
as
the
frontier
demarcation
between
the
two
countries
in
lieu
of
a
formal
border
agreement
is
known
lebanon
has
described
the
wall
as
an
aggression
saying
it
intrudes
into
lebanese
territory
israel
says
the
wall
will
be
entirely
on
its
side
of
the
blue
line
and
in
israeli
territory
at
the
same
time
lebanon
has
begun
oil
and
gas
exploration
in
a
block
that
includes
a
small
area
of
sea
along
the
maritime
frontier
that
is
claimed
by
israel
there
is
a
will
to
keep
this
dialogue
open
i
think
now
beside
the
heightened
rhetoric
the
reality
on
the
ground
is
different
and
there
is
no
appetite
for
instability
or
for
war
tenenti
said
reuters
footage
from
a
recent
trip
to
the
border
area
showed
construction
work
in
areas
along
the
blue
line
including
cranes
erecting
concrete
blocks
and
bulldozers
working
at
a
fence
israel
occupied
southern
lebanon
from
to
and
in
it
waged
a
war
against
hezbollah
there
israel
says
the
shi
ite
muslim
group
has
grown
stronger
due
to
its
role
in
the
syrian
civil
war
and
has
attacked
it
there
the
last
years
have
seen
the
quietest
period
the
south
of
lebanon
has
witnessed
in
over
years
tenenti
said
but
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
things
along
the
blue
line
are
in
general
very
sensitive
anything
could
if
it
is
not
addressed
immediately
potentially
spark
into
something
bigger
and
increase
for
abu
moussa
taher
a
shop
owner
in
naqoura
the
idea
of
a
new
war
seems
distant
it
is
impossible
i
think
when
you
think
of
a
war
you
have
to
think
of
its
consequences
said
taher
who
says
he
has
witnessed
all
of
the
wars
to
hit
the
area
