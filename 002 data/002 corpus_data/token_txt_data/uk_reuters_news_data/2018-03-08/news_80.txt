update 2-as sanctions loom, venezuelan official seeks u.s. talks over prisoners
washington
reuters
a
venezuelan
state
governor
made
an
unusual
visit
to
washington
this
week
seeking
meetings
in
congress
to
discuss
the
fate
of
an
american
imprisoned
in
the
south
american
nation
sources
said
on
wednesday
as
the
country
faces
a
possible
new
round
of
sanctions
rafael
lacava
governor
of
venezuela
s
carabobo
state
requested
meetings
to
discuss
josh
holt
a
mormon
missionary
from
utah
he
and
his
venezuelan
wife
thamara
caleno
have
been
held
since
they
were
arrested
in
on
weapons
charges
after
holt
travelled
to
venezuela
for
their
wedding
we
are
aware
that
he
is
here
there
are
suspicions
that
the
venezuela
government
is
using
the
illegitimate
detention
of
holt
as
a
bargaining
chip
to
talk
about
sanctions
a
official
said
we
continue
to
call
for
the
immediate
and
unconditional
release
of
holt
and
until
he
is
released
we
continue
to
insist
on
regular
ongoing
consular
contacts
with
him
as
called
for
under
international
law
the
official
said
it
is
unusual
for
an
official
allied
with
venezuela
s
socialist
government
a
adversary
to
visit
washington
for
such
meetings
president
donald
trump
s
administration
is
considering
new
sanctions
targeting
venezuela
s
oil
sector
to
increase
pressure
on
president
nicolas
maduro
ahead
of
an
election
washington
and
its
allies
consider
a
sham
another
source
familiar
with
the
situation
confirmed
lacava
was
in
washington
to
discuss
holt
but
did
not
believe
sanctions
would
be
discussed
in
congress
since
lawmakers
would
defer
to
the
administration
on
any
such
matter
while
i
am
not
able
to
speculate
on
what
else
might
be
on
lacava
s
agenda
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
the
sole
purpose
of
such
meetings
would
be
to
encourage
the
release
of
holt
and
his
wife
the
source
said
there
would
be
no
negotiation
and
any
claim
to
the
contrary
is
simply
false
the
source
said
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
senator
orrin
hatch
of
utah
and
other
lawmakers
are
working
for
holt
s
release
while
senator
hatch
prefers
to
not
share
details
of
sensitive
meetings
related
to
his
nearly
two
year
effort
to
have
josh
holt
released
on
humanitarian
grounds
he
is
optimistic
he
is
making
progress
and
will
continue
to
work
with
the
state
department
and
colleagues
in
the
congress
to
identify
those
to
meet
and
work
with
who
can
get
it
done
