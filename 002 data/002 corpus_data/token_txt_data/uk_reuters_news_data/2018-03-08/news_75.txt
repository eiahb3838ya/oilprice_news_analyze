caution
chinese

early

can
be

by

exports

the

the

in

growth
for

may
be
payback
for
the
previous

s
unusual
strength
rather
than
a
sign
there
has
been
an
abrupt
weakening
in

robust
import
growth
in

was
mostly
led
by
commodities

trade
boom
in

since

drivers
behind
the

expansion
last

but
tough
trade
talk
last

is
now
turning
into
action
president
donald
trump
is
expected
to
sign
a
proclamation
on
thursday
or
friday
to
establish
the
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
to
counter
cheap
imports
especially
from
china
though
close
allies
may
get
exemptions
the
measures
are
expected
to
go
into
effect
in
two
months
but
economists
see
little
immediate
impact
on
china
it
has
already
reduced
steel
exports
to
the
to
a
trickle
and
while
aluminium
shipments
account
for
around
percent
of
its
total
global
exports
of
the
metal
the
number
is
still
small
compared
with
china
s
total
exports
according
to
ing
economist
iris
pang
all
in
all
the
direct
impact
on
china
is
minimal
pang
said
in
a
note
published
on
thursday
over
time
however
any
additional
punitive
measures
and
retaliations
by
china
or
its
other
major
trading
partners
would
reduce
global
trade
flows
disrupt
international
supply
chains
and
drag
on
global

plans

which
are

significant

chinese
foreign
minister
wang

said
on
thursday
that
china
would
make
a
necessary
response
in
the
event
of
a
trade
war
with
the
united

but
said
such
a
war
would
only
harm

annual
meeting
of
china

parliament
wang
said
china
had
no
intention
of
displacing
the
united
states
and
that
the
two
countries
did
not
have
to
be
rivals
but
should
strive
to
be
partners
