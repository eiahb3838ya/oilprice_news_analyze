china
s
exports
unexpectedly
surged
at
the
fastest
pace
in
three
years
in
february
suggesting
both
its
economy
and
global
growth
remain
resilient
even
as
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
rapidly
deteriorate
trade
tensions
have
jumped
to
the
top
of
the
list
of
risks
facing
china
this
year
with
planned
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminum
signaling
more
measures
may
be
on
the
way
zhou
hao
senior
emerging
markets
economist
at
commerzbank
told
the
reuters
global
markets
forum
this
week
china
s
february
exports
rose
percent
from
a
year
earlier
far
more
than
analysts
median
forecast
for
a
percent
increase
and
january
s
percent
gain
official
data
showed
on
thursday
imports
grew
percent
missing
forecasts
for
percent
growth
and
down
from
a
percent
jump
in
january
graphic
analysts
caution
that
chinese
data
early
in
the
year
can
be
heavily
distorted
by
the
timing
of
the
lunar
new
year
holiday
which
fell
in
february
this
year
but
in
january
in
but
combined
data
also
showed
a
dramatic
acceleration
in
export
growth
good
news
for
beijing
as
it
tries
to
crack
down
on
risks
in
the
financial
system
without
sharply
braking
economic
activity
exports
rose
percent
in
eclipsing
percent
in
december
and
up
from
growth
in
the
same
period
last
year
the
gains
came
despite
a
much
stronger
yuan
currency
which
is
worrying
the
country
s
exporters
the
recovery
in
china
s
major
export
markets
could
explain
part
of
the
reason
why
exports
were
still
quite
strong
said
betty
wang
senior
china
economist
at
anz
in
hong
kong
but
tension
with
the
is
definitely
a
concern
and
a
downside
risk
to
china
s
trade
outlook
she
added
china
s
goods
surplus
with
the
united
states
a
sore
spot
in
relations
between
the
two
nations
narrowed
slightly
last
month
but
is
higher
so
far
this
year
than
at
the
same
point
last
year
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
was
billion
in
february
compared
with
billion
in
january
boosted
by
a
global
trade
boom
china
s
exports
last
year
grew
the
fastest
since
and
served
as
one
of
the
key
drivers
behind
the
economy
s
percent
expansion
but
tough
trade
talk
last
year
is
now
turning
into
action
clouding
the
outlook
for
a
repeat
performance
president
donald
trump
is
expected
to
sign
a
proclamation
on
thursday
or
friday
to
establish
the
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
to
counter
cheap
imports
especially
from
china
though
close
allies
may
get
exemptions
the
measures
are
expected
to
go
into
effect
in
about
two
weeks
but
economists
see
little
immediate
impact
on
china
china
has
already
reduced
steel
exports
to
the
to
a
trickle
in
response
to
strong
demand
at
home
and
duties
and
while
aluminum
shipments
account
for
around
percent
of
its
global
exports
of
the
metal
the
number
is
still
small
compared
with
china
s
total
exports
according
to
ing
economist
iris
pang
all
in
all
the
direct
impact
on
china
is
minimal
pang
said
in
a
note
published
on
thursday
while
china
s
global
steel
exports
have
dropped
by
almost
a
third
this
year
tariffs
on
aluminum
may
be
an
easier
sell
for
trump
as
china
s
shipments
increased
over
percent
in
the
first
two
months
of
the
year
over
time
however
any
additional
punitive
measures
and
retaliations
by
china
or
its
other
major
trading
partners
would
reduce
global
trade
flows
disrupt
international
supply
chains
and
drag
on
global
growth
china
may
be
far
more
vulnerable
to
plans
to
combat
intellectual
property
theft
which
could
hit
its
sales
of
products
china
s
global
tech
exports
saw
strong
gains
in
the
first
two
months
of
this
year
foreign
minister
wang
yi
said
on
thursday
that
china
would
make
a
necessary
response
in
the
event
of
a
trade
war
with
the
but
said
such
a
war
would
only
harm
all
sides
on
paper
china
has
more
to
lose
from
a
trade
war
it
exports
far
more
to
the
than
it
imports
capital

said
but
for
the
there
are
few
alternative
sources
for
the
main
products
that
it
buys
from
china
such
as
mobile
phones
tablets
and
network
equipment
it
added
at
home
china
s
domestic
demand
also
appears
solid
despite
a
cooling
property
market
and
rising
borrowing
costs
that
are
expected
to
eventually
rob
the
economy
of
some
momentum
while

growth
