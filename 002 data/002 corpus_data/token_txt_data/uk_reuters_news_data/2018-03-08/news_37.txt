industry
sources
told
reuters
saudi
arabia
and
international
oil
companies
had
discussed
gas
venture
opportunities
inside
the

and
abroad
aramco
is
gearing
up
for
a
share
listing
later
this
year
aiming
to
get
a
valuation
of
up
to
trillion
in
what
could
be
the
world
s
biggest
initial
public
offering
ipo
the
kingdom
has
a
goal
of
increasing
the
use
of
gas
for
domestic
power
generation
thus
reducing
oil
burning
at
home
and
freeing
up
more
crude
for
export
expanding
its
gas
portfolio
inside
the
kingdom
as
well
as
abroad
could
help
increase
aramco
s
valuation
as
it
generates
more
revenue
from
exports
than
selling
oil
at
lower
domestic
prices
saudi
arabia
is
the
world
s
oil
consumer
despite
being
only
the
economy
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
who
is
also
aramco
s
chairman
had
said
aramco
was
interested
in
investing
in
international
upstream
ventures
particularly
gas
and
could
invest
in
importing
gas
into
the
kingdom
diversifying
gas
assets
abroad
would
help
aramco
achieve
a
better
valuation
and
is
attractive
for
investors
industry
sources
has
said
riyadh
also
plans
to
raise
domestic
gas
prices
a
move
seen
as
an
incentive
for
foreign
companies
aramco
controls
gas
reserves
in
excess
of
trillion
cubic
meters
according
to
bp
s
annual
energy
review
the
saudi
company
has
said
it
wants
to
explore
for
gas
in
the
shallow
waters
of
the
red
sea
as
well
as
onshore
shale
gas
aramco
s
gas
strategy
is
part
of
the
kingdom
s
push
to
diversify
its
economy
away
from
oil
a
strategy
known
as
vision
championed
by
prince
mohammed
amid
a
global
drive
to
phase
out
the
most
polluting
fossil
fuels
