sand
used
to
hold
open
tiny
cracks
in
shale
rocks
in
order
to
allow
oil
and
gas
to
escape
is
the
most
widely
used
proppant
for
hydraulic
fracking
so
far
the
industry
has
relied
upon
frack
sand
hauled
over
miles
from
wisconsin
at
a
cost
of
per

to
address
a
surge
in
demand
from
the
permian
it
local
sourcing
will
also
focus
attention
on
logistics
within
the

itself
which
will
also
drive
well
economics
