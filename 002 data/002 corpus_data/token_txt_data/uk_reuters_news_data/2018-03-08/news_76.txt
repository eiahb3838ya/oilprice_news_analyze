told

that
the

on

imports
could
exclude

mexico
and

of

still
the
issue
will

trump
will
take

what
retaliatory
actions
other

will
take
in

a
white
house
official
said
on
wednesday
trump
plans
to
offer
canada
and
mexico
a
exemption
from
planned
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
which
could
be
extended
based
on
progress
in
nafta
talks
trump
was
expected
to
sign
a
presidential
proclamation
to
establish
the
tariffs
during
a
ceremony
on
thursday
but
a
white
house
official
said
later
it
could
slide
into
friday
because
documents
had
to
be
cleared
through
a
legal
process
investors
worry
that
the
tariff
could
trigger
a

the
european
central
bank
is
all
but
certain
to
keep
policy
unchanged
on
thursday

may
tweak
its
communication
stance
to

a
few
clues
about
