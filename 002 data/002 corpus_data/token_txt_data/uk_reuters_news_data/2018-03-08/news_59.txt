china
plans
to
create
an
energy
ministry
to
oversee
the
country
s
vast
oil
natural
gas
coal
and
power
sectors
part
of
a
government
to
make
policymaking
more
efficient
four
sources
with
ties
to
the
country
s
leadership
said
this
week
the
new
ministry
would
replace
the
existing
regulator
the
national
energy
administration
nea
which
was
created
a
decade
ago
and
is
part
of
the
powerful
state
economic
planner
the
national
development
reform
commission
ndrc
the
new
ministry
would
not
be
under
the
ndrc
and
would
handle
duties
currently
scattered
across
many
government
agencies
the
sources
said
the
planned
is
part
of
a
broader
reshuffle
of
government
departments
which
will
be
presented
to
china
s
largely
parliament
on
tuesday
it
is
not
clear
if
details
of
the
changes
will
immediately
be
made
public
china
is
also
expected
to
overhaul
its
financial
regulatory
possibly
merging
different
agencies
to
improve
the
ability
to
control
financial
risk
said
four
additional
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
the
nea
declined
to
comment
and
the
ndrc
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
it
was
not
known
who
will
be
appointed
to
run
the
new
ministry
nur
bekri
heads
the
nea
and
is
a
vice
minister
of
the
ndrc
removing
energy
from
the
ndrc
s
portfolio
reflects
the
growing
importance
of
the
oil
gas
and
clean
fuel
sectors
in
the
world
s
biggest
energy
consumer
the
plan
comes
after
the
ruling
communist
party
agreed
in
late
february
to
deepen
reform
of
party
and
government
departments
to
improve
their
function
while
the
february
statement
did
not
say
which
departments
may
be
merged
or
eliminated
it
said
the
moves
would
strengthen
market
supervision
and
management
of
natural
resources
and
environmental
protection
the
new
ministry
will
be
responsible
for
major
ongoing
tasks
including
a
push
to
liberalise
china
s
electricity
market
opening
energy
infrastructure
such
as
gas
pipelines
and
oil
storage
to
private
and
foreign
players
boosting
renewable
energy
use
and
weaning
the
country
off
coal
its
favourite
fuel
the
reorganisation
comes
as
china
prepares
this
month
to
launch
its
crude
oil
futures
contract
which
will
be
asia
s
first
pricing
benchmark
giving
the
world
s
top
oil
importer
greater
clout
on
the
global
market
it
s
not
known
if
the
new
department
will
also
oversee
the
three
state
oil
majors
sinopec
and
china
national
petroleum
corp
and
cnooc
unifying
energy
supervision
under
a
standalone
regulator
may
also
help
to
reduce
overlaps
that
have
complicated
the
implementation
of
major
policy
in
recent
years
if
this
happened
the
energy
ministry
would
have
more
unified
power
to
push
through
reform
and
regulate
the
market
said
lin
boqiang
an
energy
expert
with
xiamen
university
he
did
not
know
about
the
plan
the
big
question
is
whether
the
ndrc
is
willing
to
hand
over
its
responsibility
for
the
energy
in
cuts
in
coal
mining
as
part
of
beijing
s
reform
and
war
on
smog
caused
shortages
of
the
fuel
and
a
surge
in
prices
hurting
utilities
later
the
ndrc
had
to
reverse
some
of
the
most
stringent
measures
this
past
winter
beijing
s
push
to
heat
homes
with
gas
and
electricity
created
chaos
as
some
homes
were
freezing
and
factories
were
forced
to
shut
due
to
lack
of
fuel
china
formed
its
first
energy
ministry
in
from
the
remnants
of
the
old
electricity
coal
and
oil
bureaus
but
dissolved
it
in
china
set
up
the
nea
in
to
improve
coordination
and
conduct
planning
but
it
has
no
policymaking
powers
and
its
decisions
remain
subject
to
the
ndrc
s
approval
