a
sense
of
calm
returned
to
global
markets
on
thursday
as
traders
took
a
break
from
worrying
about
a
global
trade
war
and
focused
instead
on
the
european
central
bank
s
plans
to
end
its
trillion
euro
stimulus
programme
european
and
asian
share
markets
all
edged
up
the
first
two
for
a
fourth
day
after
president
donald
trump
suggested
he
may
spare
some
key
trade
partners
in
his
push
to
introduce
protectionist
tariffs
the
euro
lingered
in
the
red
though
as
a
drop
in
german
industrial
orders
and
then
a
subdued
ecb
inflation
forecast
added
to
the
weekend
s
inconclusive
italian
election
reinforcing
caution
the
central
bank
did
however
drop
an
explicit
promise
on
its
bond
buying
which
has
been
running
for
three
years
and
there
was
some
pointed
criticism
from
ecb
chief
mario
draghi
for
trump
s
plans
for
more
trade
tariffs
if
you
put
tariffs
against
those
who
are
your
allies
one
wonders
who
the
enemies
are
he
said
wall
street
opened
higher
just
after
draghi
spoke
and
the
dollar
was
up
marginally
too
trump
is
expected
to
sign
a
document
to
establish
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
by
eastern
time
a
source
told
reuters
this
is
just
the
beginning
from
a
sector
perspective
as
far
as
protectionism
goes
said
michael
luckman
a
partner
a
law
firm
gowling
wlg
import
tariffs
could
be
applied
to
almost
anything
that
a
government
believes
will
harm
domestic
producers
so
this
is
likely
to
be
the
tip
of
the
highlighting
the
strength
of
the
global
economy
chinese
data
showed
both
exports
and
imports
rose
more
than
percent
in
the
first
two
months
of
this
year
from
a
year
earlier
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
stabilised
against
other
major
currencies
after
its
hit
from
fears
about
the
tariff
plan
while
the
mexican
peso
and
canadian
dollar
recovered
from
steep
losses
the
euro
traded
down
at
having
risen
to
on
wednesday
its
highest
since
the
currency
has
been
rising
since
it
hit
a
low
of
when
trump
unveiled
his
tariff
plan
last
week
bond
markets
were
also
steady
with
treasury
yields
stuck
at
percent
and
germany
s
benchmark
barely
budged
at
percent
having
hit
a
low
of
percent
on
monday
the
governing
council
expects
the
key
ecb
interest
rates
to
remain
at
their
present
levels
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
well
past

hong

led
the
region
with
rise
of

after
china
s
surprisingly
strong
trade
data
wall
street
started
with
a
percent
rise
for
the
s
p
and
dow
jones
which
had
both
seen
a
choppy
day
on
wednesday
they
had
swung
higher
when
white
house
spokeswoman
sarah
sanders
said
the
impending
hefty
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
may
exclude
canada
mexico
and
some
other
countries
that
soothed
worries
about
the
prospect
of
more
aggressive
trade
measures
after
the
departure
of
trump
s
top
economic
adviser
gary
cohn
masahiro
ichikawa
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
said
the
issue
would
hang
over
markets
however
investors
need
to
see
exactly
what
steps
trump
will
take
and
what
retaliatory
actions
other
countries
will
take
in
coming
draghi
wasn

the
only
one

europe

express
concerns
about
trump

plans
