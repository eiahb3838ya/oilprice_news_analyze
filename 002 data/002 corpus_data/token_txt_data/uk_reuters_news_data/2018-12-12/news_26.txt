failure
by

to
agree
rules
on
implementing
the
paris
climate
agreement
aimed
at
curbing

would
be
suicidal

antonio
guterres
said
on
wednesday
guterres
told
delegates
from
over
countries
meeting
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
that
they
had
less
than
three
days
to
find
the
political
will
to
reach
difficult
compromises
sacrifices
and
common
ground
needed
for
a
deal
failing
here
in
katowice
would
send
a
disastrous
message
to
those
who
stand
ready
to
shift
to
a
green
economy
he
said
to
waste
this
opportunity
would
compromise
our
last
best
chance
to
stop
runaway
climate
change
it
would
not
only
be
immoral
it
would
be
three
years
to
the
day
after
the
paris
climate
accord
was
adopted
by
over
countries
delegates
in
the
polish
city
are
still
grappling
with
how
the
accord
will
be
implemented
this
slow
progress
after
more
than
a
week
of
negotiations
prompted
michal
kurtyka
the
polish
president
of
the
talks
to
tell
delegates
time
was
precious
and
they
needed
to
find
wordings
which
were
acceptable
to
all
environmental
activists
and
some
developing
countries
have
also
raised
concern
that
the
rule
book
could
fall
short
of
pushing
countries
towards
curbing
their
emissions
to
meet
the
paris
targets
the
clock
is
ticking
while
we
spend
time
debating
texts
and
demanding
their
implementation
the
planet
outside
is
deteriorating
species
are
becoming
extinct
habitats
disappearing
emissions
piling
up
brazilian
environment
minister
edson
duarte
said
guterres
said
a
recent
report
by
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
acknowledged
what
global
warming
beyond
degrees
will
mean
for
billions
of
people
especially
those
who
live
in
small
island
states
the
report
outlined
a
catastrophic
future
if
no
action
was
taken
by
countries
immediately
he
said
adding
that
the
window
of
opportunity
was
closing
the
paris
agreement
aims
to
restrict
warming
to
well
below
two
degrees
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
this
may
sound
like
a
dramatic
appeal
but
it
is
exactly
this
a
dramatic
appeal
