opec
on
wednesday
said
it
replaced
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
as
sanctions
resumed
and
lowered
the
forecast
of
demand
for
its
crude
underlining
its
challenge
to
prevent
a
glut
building
even
after
last
week
s
decision
to
trim
output
in
a
monthly
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
fell
by
only
barrels
per
day
month
on
month
to
million
bpd
in
november
despite
president
donald
trump
s
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
as
saudi
arabia
pumped
at
a
record
rate
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
also
said
demand
for
its
crude
would
fall
to
million
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
as
rivals
pump
more
and
a
slowing
economy
curbs
demand
growth
opec
and
allies
last
week
agreed
to
return
to
supply
cuts
in
pledging
to
lower
output
by
million
bpd
