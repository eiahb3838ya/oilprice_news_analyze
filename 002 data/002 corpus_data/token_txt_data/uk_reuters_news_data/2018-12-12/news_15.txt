a
hack
on
italian
oil
services
firm
saipem
that
crippled
more
than
computers
was
likely
caused
by
a
variant
of
a
notorious
destructive
virus
known
as
shamoon
the
company
and
two
cybersecurity
firms
said
saipem
s
head
of
digital
and
innovation
mauro
piasere
told
reuters
on
wednesday
that
the
firm
suspects
that
a
shamoon
variant
caused
between
to
computers
to
stop
working
in
an
attack
that
was
disclosed
by
the
company
on
monday
and
primarily
affected
its
servers
in
the
middle
east
piasere
said
the
company
does
not
know
who
was
behind
the
attack
use
of
a
shamoon
variant
would
be
significant
because
related
viruses
have
been
used
in
some
of
the
most
damaging
attacks
in
history
beginning
in
when
it
crippled
tens
of
thousands
of
computers
at
middle
eastern
energy
firms
saudi
aramco
and
rasgas
co
shamoon
resurfaced
again
in
late
in
a
series
of
attacks
in
the
middle
east
that
continued
through
early
and
then
went
dormant
it
went
dark
for
a
long
time
and
it
seems
to
be
back
said
symantec
senior
researcher
eric
chien
the
question
is
whether
any
others
were
affected
by
security
researchers
widely
believe
that
people
working
on
behalf
of
the
iranian
government
were
behind
the
previous
shamoon
attacks
something
that
tehran
strongly
denies
imagery
was
found
in
the
code
researchers
have
said
crowdstrike
vice
president
of
intelligence
adam
meyers
said
early
technical
analysis
of
the
saipem
hack
showed
similarities
with
shamoon
and
that
it
was
likely
iran
was
also
responsible
though
the
specific
motive
was
not
immediately
apparent
officials
in
iran
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
shamoon
disables
computers
by
overwriting
a
crucial
file
known
as
the
master
boot
record
making
it
impossible
for
devices
to
start
up
former
defense
secretary
leon
panetta
has
said
the
shamoon
hack
on
saudi
aramco
was
probably
the
most
destructive
cyber
attack
to
date
on
a
private
business
saudi
aramco
is
the
biggest
client
of
saipem
one
of
the
world
s
largest
subsea
engineering
and
construction
firms
which
is
controlled
by
italian
state
lender
cdp
and
oil
firm
eni
the
saipem
attack
knocked
out
more
than
servers
and
dozens
of
personal
computers
in
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
kuwait
india
and
scotland
piasere
said
no
data
will
be
lost
because
the
company
had
backed
up
the
computers
that
were
affected
he
said
servers
are
slowly
being
brought
back
on
line
though
the
company
is
proceeding
carefully
to
prevent
further
infections
