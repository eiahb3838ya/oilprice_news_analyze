negotiating
teams
have
been
asked
to
produce
a
more
concise
draft
text
on
the
rules
for
implementing
the
paris
agreement
this
morning
but
work
continues
last
night
michal
kurtyka
the
polish
president
of
the
talks
said
time
was
precious
and
delegates
needed
to
find
language
which
was
acceptable
to
all
so
i
urge
you
look
at
the
big
picture
and
avoid
micro
issues
do
not
add
text
subtract
text
don
t
add
brackets
subtract
words
like
the
he
said
grappling
over
the
language
used
in
texts
usually
occurs
at
such
talks
but
time
is
running
out
to
get
a
draft
in
a
more
concise
format
for
ministers
to
work
with
in
their
negotiations
we
are
concerned
that
the
environmental
integrity
of
the
paris
rule
book
has
been
weakened
gradually
we
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
a
swiss
cheese
rule
book
is
unacceptable

shuo
anniversary
today
marks
the
anniversary
of
the

of
the
landmark
paris
agreement
around
countries
overcame
political
differences
to
agree
to
limit
global
warming
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
and
as
close
to
as
possible
to
prevent
dangerous
effects
of

antonio
guterres
returned
to
katowice
on
wednesday
for
the
talks
and
is
expected
to
try
to
fill
a
leadership
void
and
urge
countries
to
strengthen
their
national
targets
by
failing
here
in
katowice
would
send
a
disastrous
message
to
those
who
stand
ready
to
shift
to
a
green
economy
so
i
urge
you
to
find
common
ground
that
will
allow
us
to
show
the
world
that
we
are
listening
that
we
care
guterres
told
delegates
at
the
conference
to
waste
this
opportunity
would
compromise
our
last
best
chance
to
stop
runaway
climate
change
it
would
not
only
be
immoral
it
would
be
suicidal
he
said
