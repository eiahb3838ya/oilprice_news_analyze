joint
congressional
resolutions
must
be
signed
by
the
president
and
have
the
force
of
law
the
resolution
s
content
has
not
been
released
so
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
joint
resolution
would
prompt
any
specific
punishment
against
the
crown
prince
or
the
kingdom
beyond
a
statement
of
condemnation
corker
said
it
was
largely
similar
to
a
resolution
introduced
last
week
by
republican
senator
lindsey
graham
and
other
republicans
and
democrats
that
condemned
khashoggi
s
death
and
said
the
senate
has
a
high
level
of
confidence
that
the
saudi
crown
prince
was
complicit
in
his
murder
khashoggi
a
resident
who
was
a
columnist
for
