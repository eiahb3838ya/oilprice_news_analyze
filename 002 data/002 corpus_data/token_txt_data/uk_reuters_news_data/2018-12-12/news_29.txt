sao

dec
reuters
the
brazilian
government
approved
consultations
at
the
world
trade
organization
regarding
subsidies
it
says
india
gives
to
cane
producers
and
sugar
exporters
brazil
s
trade
ministry
said
brazil
said
it
has
decided
to
start
a
formal
action
at
the
wto
after
failing
to
receive
enough
information
from
india
following
letters
it
sent
to
the
indian
government
seeking
clarifications
on
sugar
policies
the
suspicion
is
that
indian
domestic
support
to
farmers
and
its
subsidies
to
sugar
exports
caused
significant
impacts
in
the
sugar
market
in
a
context
of
falling
prices
and
decreasing
production
in
the
main
centers
brazil
china
and
thailand
the
brazilian
trade
ministry
said
in
a
written
statement
late
tuesday
india
is
expected
to
surpass
brazil
as
the
world
s
largest
sugar
producer
in
the
current
global
sugar
crop
with
output
around
million
tonnes
while
brazil
s
production
is
expected
to
fall
almost
million
tonnes
to
below
million
tonnes
brazil
said
india
s
government
policy
to
guarantee
a
minimum
price
for
cane
to
farmers
has
caused
production
to
surge
it
says
this
policy
combined
with
subsidies
to
sugar
transportation
is
allowing
the
country
to
ship
excess
sugar
production
abroad
sugar
prices
in
new
york
reached
a
low
in
september
prices
have
recovered
a
bit
since
then
but
are
still
barely
covering
production
costs
for
most
companies
as
a
result
brazilian
mills
sharply
reduced
their
sugar
production
in
the
current
season
diverting
cane
to
ethanol
instead
and
leaving
sugar
equipment
idle
