asian
stock
markets
rallied
on
wednesday
as
president
donald
trump
sounded
upbeat
about
a
trade
deal
with
china
while
sterling
struggled
with
the
risk
of
an
imminent
party
coup
against
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
in
an
interview
with
reuters
trump
said
talks
were
taking
place
with
beijing
by
phone
and
he
would
not
raise
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
until
he
was
sure
about
a
deal
trump
also
said
he
would
intervene
in
the
justice
department
s
case
against
a
top
executive
at
china
s
huawei
technologies
if
it
would
serve
national
security
interests
or
help
close
a
trade
deal
a
canadian
court
on
tuesday
granted
bail
to
the
executive
in
a
move
that
could
help
placate
chinese
officials
angered
by
her
arrest
the
news
was
enough
to
prompt

finish
on

street
having
been
repeatedly
disappointed
before
analysts
were
careful
to
not
get
too
optimistic
from
the
huawei
case
it
is
increasingly
obvious
that
the
trade
war
is
about
the
exchange
of
technology
and
the
development
of
advanced
technologies
by
chinese
companies
said
analysts
at
ing
in
a
note
the
truce
will
not
address
these
issues
and
therefore
tension
between
china
and
will
sentiment
had
got
a
lift
on
tuesday
from
reports
china
was
considering
cutting
import
tariffs
on
cars
to
percent
from
the
current
percent
yet
there
were
also
reports
the
would
release
evidence
this
week
detailing
chinese
hacking
and
economic
espionage
even
if
this
auto
step
is
taken
it
just
removes
what
was
a
retaliatory
measure
to
begin

noted

david
plank
whatever
the

market
price
action
is
somewhat
of
a

now
as
it
swings

new
markets
had
also
been
jolted
when
trump
threatened
to
shut
down
the
government
over
funding
for
a
wall
he
has
promised
to
build
on
the
southern
border
with
mexico
in
currency
markets
sterling
was
pinned
near
lows
amid
reports
conservative
lawmakers
could
vote
on
a
no
confidence
motion
in
may
s
leadership
as
soon
as
wednesday
night
the
political
ructions
come
a
day
after
her
decision
to
delay
a
vote
in
parliament
on
her
brexit
deal
for
fear
of
a
rout
angered
many
in
her
party
the
risk
kept
the

at
having
shed

the
previous

as

about

survive
as

are
for

new
referendum
or

investors
were
also
looking
ahead
to
the
consumer

report
later
on
wednesday
where
an
expected
slowdown
in
headline
inflation
would
only
reinforce
speculation
of

still
expect

said
the
