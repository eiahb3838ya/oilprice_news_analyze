stock
markets
rallied
on
wednesday
as
president
donald
trump
sounded
upbeat
about
a
trade
deal
with
china
while
sterling
rose
off
month
lows
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
vowed
to
fight
a
challenge
to
her
leadership
in
an
interview
with
reuters
trump
said
talks
were
taking
place
with
beijing
by
phone
and
he
would
not
raise
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
until
he
was
sure
about
a
deal
trump
also
said
he
would
intervene
in
the
justice
department
s
case
against
a
top
executive
at
china
s
huawei
technologies
if
it
would
serve
national
security
interests
or
help
close
a
trade
deal
a
canadian
court
on
tuesday
granted
bail
to
the
executive
in
a
move
that
could
help
placate
chinese
officials
angered
by
her
arrest
the
news
was
enough
to
prompt
a
bounce
after
days
of
struggle
and
msci
s
broadest
index
of
world
stocks
advanced
nearly

japan
s
nikkei
had
led
the
way
in
asia
with
a
jump
of
percent
while
shanghai
blue

trailed
with
just
percent
london
frankfurt
and
paris
then

to

we

seeing

stabilising
a
bit
said
societe
generale
strategist
alvin
tan
firstly
we
had
news
that
china
was
considering
reducing
tariffs
on
us
car
then
the
huawei
cfo
was
released
on
bail
and
then
trump
said
could
he
intervene
in
the
case
if
it
helped
secure
a
trade
having
been
repeatedly
disappointed
before
analysts
were
still
being
careful
to
not
get
too
optimistic
about
prospects
of
a
trade
agreement
ing
said
the
huawei
case
made
it
increasingly
obvious
that
the
trade
war
is
about
the
exchange
of
technology
and
there
were
also
reports
the
united
states
would
release
evidence
this
week
detailing
chinese
hacking
and
economic
espionage
even
if
this
auto
step
is
taken
it
just
removes
what
was
a
retaliatory
measure
to
begin
with
noted
anz
economist
david
plank
whatever
the
case
market
price
action
is
somewhat
of
a
right
now
as
it
swings
around
on
each
new
markets
had
also
been
jolted
when
trump
threatened
to
shut
down
the
government
over
funding
for
a
wall
he
has
promised
to
build
on
the
southern
border
with
mexico
the
pound
had
fallen
to
lows
overnight
after
lawmakers
in
may
s
conservative
party
gathered
enough
support
to
trigger
a
vote
in
her
leadership
but
it
stabilised
as
some
investors
bet
that
may
would
win
wednesday
s
vote
and
in
the
process
isolate
opponents
in
her
party
who
want
a
clean
sudden
break
from
the
eu
neverthless
uncertainty
over
the
secret
ballot
capped
gains
keeping
the
pound
only
just
above
having
shed
percent
in
the
previous
two
sessions
to
a
trough
of
the
euro
softened
slightly
pence
but
was
flat
on
the
dollar
at
the
dollar
was
still
being
viewed
as
the
best
of
a
bad
bunch
and
stayed
at
on
a
basket
of
currencies
the
market
is
concerned
that
may
could
be
replaced
by
a
increasing
the
chance
of
a
scenario
said
rodrigo
catril
a
senior
fx
strategist
at
nab
investors
were
also
looking
ahead
to
the
consumer
price
report
later
on
wednesday
where
an
expected
slowdown
in
headline
inflation
would
only
reinforce
speculation
of
fewer
rate
hikes
from
the
federal
reserve
while
market
still
expect
the
fed
will
tighten
at
its
policy
meeting
next
week
trump
said
the
central
bank
would
be
foolish
to
do
so
wagers
on
a
more
restrained
fed
helped
gold
stay
near
a
peak
around
an
ounce
oil
bounced
after
industry
data
showed
a
surprisingly
large
draw
on
stockpiles
and
amid
talk
a
recent
supply
cut
could
support
prices
in
brent
futures
added
another
cents
