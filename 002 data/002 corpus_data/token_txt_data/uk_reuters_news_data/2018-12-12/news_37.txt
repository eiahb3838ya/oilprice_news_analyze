top
officials
and
advocates
are
pushing
at
talks
in
poland
to
ensure
governments
and
businesses
respect
human
rights
when
working
to
build
a
green
future
under
the
paris
climate
pact
the
climate
change
conference
due
to
end
on
friday
is
struggling
to
agree
rules
for
efforts
to
keep
global
temperature
rise
well
below
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
above
times
a
goal
enshrined
in
the
paris
accord
one
sticking
point
is
how
obligations
on
human
rights
should
be
incorporated
into
the
rule
book
for
implementing
the
paris
deal
climate
change
already
has
affected
the
lives
of
so
many
people
the
right
to
food
because
of
terrible
droughts
the
right
to
live
in
proper
ways
human
rights
chief
michelle
bachelet
said
at
the
talks
most
references
to
human
rights
have
been
stripped
out
of
the
text
now
under
negotiation
in
katowice
experts
said
however
it
remains
in
clauses
relating
to
carbon
markets
although
egypt
on
behalf
of
the
arab
group
of
nations
and
saudi
arabia
have
opposed
its
inclusion
they
added
the
wording
is
key
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
previous
rights
abuses
linked
to
carbon
credits
for
renewable
energy
projects
under
the
kyoto
protocol
said
sebastien
duyck
a
senior
attorney
at
the
center
for
international
environmental
law
ciel
the
kyoto
protocol
is
a
treaty
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
which
expires
in
when
the
paris
agreement
takes
off
in
panama
the
construction
of
a
hydroelectric
dam
had
been
eligible
to
receive
carbon
credits
under
the
clean
development
mechanism
cdm
a
scheme
for
rich
nations
to
offset
their
emissions
under
the
kyoto
protocol
despite
displacing
indigenous
people
ciel
said
the
barro
blanco
dam
had
forced
from
their
homes
indigenous
ngabe
who
lived
on
the
site
of
its
reservoir
said
duyck
in
builders
of
barro
blanco
finally
withdrew
the
dam
from
the
cdm
he
said
similar
problems
with
other
cdm
projects
have
been
reported
in
countries
including
honduras
guatemala
and
kenya
bachelet
said
her
organisation
had
collected
reports
of
such
abuses
but
relied
on
national
human
rights
watchdogs
for
that
information
it
was
important
to
strengthen
the
independence
of
those
national
agencies
typically
funded
by
governments
to
ensure
human
rights
and
green
development
go
hand
in
hand
she
said
it
is
a
political
issue
she
emphasised
sachs
lamented
that
links
between
human
rights
and
climate
change
were
not
more
central
in
the
paris
rule
book
draft
wild
weather
from
hurricanes
to
punishing
floods
and
drought
has
grown
stronger
around
the
world
as
the
planet
warms
with
dramatic
humanitarian
consequences
i
think
the
bigger
issue
with
climate
change
is
millions
are
being
displaced
not
because
of
projects
but
because
of
climate
change
and
so
we
should
focus
on
climate
change
as
a
violation
of
rights
he
said
bringing
to
court
those
most
responsible
for
global
warming
including
fossil
fuel
companies
a
growing
trend
in
the
united
states
was
a
large
part
of
respecting
human
rights
he
said
activists
said
they
were
running
out
of
patience
standing
in
front
of
a
banner
reading
protect
our
rights
new
zealand
climate
activist
kera
regan
urged
negotiators
gathered
in
a
corridor
to
call
their
ministers
and
tell
them
right
now
that
we
need
our
rights
in
the
text
if
the
inclusion
of
human
rights
in
relation
to
the
cdm
s
successor
mechanism
remains
in
the
rule
book
it
could
help
safeguard
groups
like
forest
dwellers
from
abuses
said
duyck
but
should
those
references
be
scrapped
the
risks
are
very
clear
