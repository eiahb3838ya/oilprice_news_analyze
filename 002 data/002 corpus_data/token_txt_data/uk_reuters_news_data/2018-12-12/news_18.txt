the

told

coal
practically
isn
t
coming
back
but
it
is
important
we
all
look
at
opportunities
and
recognize
we
need
to
talk
about
workers
and
communities
that
s
a
big
issue
here
in
poland
but
it
is
also
an
issue
in
germany
she
said
a
report
said
in
october
that
renewable
energy
would
need
to
supply
the
bulk
of
world
electricity
by
to
keep
global

degrees
limit

launched
the
powering
past
coal
alliance
a
coalition
of
countries
as
well
as
cities
provinces
states
and
businesses
it
aims
to
encourage
developed
nations
to
phase
out
power
by
but
several
countries
have
been
promoting
fossil

and
nations
pushing
for
alternative
power
sources
polish
president
andrzej
duda
said
last
week
that
poland
s
coal
industry
had
a
long
future
and
vowed
not

let
anyone
murder
coal
mining
the
country
relies
on
coal
for
around
percent
of
its
power
and
more
than
mining
jobs
while
calling
for
coal
to
be
phased
out
canada
has
been
criticized
as
one
of
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
producers
mckenna
said
canada
was
addressing
such
concerns
we
are
in
a
transition
and
transitions
are
not
going
to
happen
from
one
day
to
the
next
people
are
still
driving
cars
and
even
in
a
scenario
we
are
still
going
to
be
using
oil
and
gas
but
moving
as
quickly
as
we
all
can
towards
cleaner
sources
she
said
she
said
canada
was
investing
in
renewables
and
cited
efforts
in
the
canadian
province
of
alberta
which
relies
heavily
on
oil
and
gas
but
has
introduced
a
carbon
tax
and
aims
to
impose
a
limit
on
emissions
from
oil
sands
