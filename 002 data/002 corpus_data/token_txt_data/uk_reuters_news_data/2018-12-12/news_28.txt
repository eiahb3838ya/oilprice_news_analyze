stock
markets
rallied
on
wednesday
as
president
donald
trump
sounded
upbeat
about
doing
a
trade
deal
with
china
while
sterling
jumped
off
lows
as
prime
minister
theresa
may
vowed
to
fight
a
challenge
to
her
leadership
reports
that
italy
s
government
had
bowed
to
pressure
to
scale
back
its
spending
plans
put
a
spring
in
the
euro
s
step
and
wall
street
was
expected
to
open
strongly
due
to
the
trade
signals
in
an
interview
with
reuters
trump
said
talks
were
taking
place
with
beijing
by
phone
and
he
would
not
raise
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
until
he
knew
whether
the
two
sides
would
reach
a
deal
trump
also
said
he
would
intervene
in
the
justice
department
s
case
against
a
top
executive
at
china
s
huawei
technologies
if
it
served
national
security
interests
or
helped
to
close
a
trade
deal
a
canadian
court
granted
bail
on
tuesday
to
huawei
s
chief
financial
officer
in
a
move
that
could
help
placate
chinese
officials
angered
by
her
arrest
the
news
was
enough
to
prompt
a
global
bounce
in
sentiment
and
msci
s
broadest

of
world
stocks
advanced
nearly

japan
s
nikkei
had
led
asia
with
a
jump
of

and
while

trailed
with
just

europe
then

we
are
seeing

sentiment
stabilising
a
bit
said
societe
generale
strategist
alvin
tan
firstly
we
had
news
that
china
was
considering
reducing
tariffs
on
cars
then
the
huawei
cfo
was
released
on
bail
and
then
trump
said
he
could
intervene
in
the
case
if
it
helped
secure
a
trade
the
euro
rose
percent
on
the
day
to
after
the
news
having
been
repeatedly
disappointed
before
analysts
were
still
careful
not
to
get
too
optimistic
ing
said
the
huawei
case
had
made
it
increasingly
obvious
that
the
trade
war
was
about
technology
as
much
as
anything
else
and
there
were
also
reports
that
the
united
states
would
release
new
evidence
this
week
on
chinese
hacking
and
economic
espionage
markets
had
also
been
jolted
when
trump
threatened
to
shut
down
the
government
over
funding
for
a
wall
he
has
promised
to
build
on
the
border
with
mexico
the
pound
had
fallen
to
lows
overnight
as
lawmakers
in
may
s
conservative
party
gathered
enough
support
to
trigger
a
vote
in
her
leadership
but
it
bounced
back
percent
as
a
number
of
heavyweight
colleagues
backed
may
and
traders
started
wagering
that
she
would
survive
isolating
opponents
who
want
a
clean
sudden
break
from
the
eu
nevertheless
uncertainty
over
what
will
be
a
secret
ballot
on
wednesday
evening
capped
gains
keeping
the
pound
around
having
shed
percent
in
the
previous
two
sessions
to
a
trough
of
the
dollar
stayed
at
on
a
basket
of
currencies
while
the
euro
climbed
to
on
reports
that
italy
would
scale
down
its
budget
deficit
target
to
percent
that
would
be
well
below
the
previous
target
of
percent
and
likely
to
ease
tensions
the
spending
plans
had
created
with
the
european
commission

trump
said
the

on
