an
ineffective
safeguard
failed
to
prevent
an
explosive
mixing
of
air
and
fuel
at
a
husky
energy
refinery
in
superior
wisconsin
leading
to
a
blast
and
fire
in
the
plant
s
unit
in
april
a
industrial
safety
group
said
on
wednesday
air
seeped
through
a
hole
in
a
valve
within
a
fluidic
catalytic
cracking
unit
fccu
the
chemical
safety
board
csb
said
causing
an
april
explosion
that
led
to
a
massive
fire
and
a
evacuation
of
residents
living
within
miles
of
the
plant
the
board
said
people
sought
medical
treatment
after
the
blast
including
working
at
the
refinery
the
plant
was
undergoing
maintenance
at
the
time
husky
according
to
the
csb
had
only
considered
a
failure
of
the
valve
when
locked
open
not
a
failure
when
it
was
closed
according
to
an
updated
report
the
board
presented
of
its
investigation
at
a
meeting
in
superior
the
failures
leading
to
the
superior
refinery
explosion
were
similar
to
those
that
caused
a
explosion
in
an
fccu
at
a
torrance
california
refinery
then
owned
by
exxon
mobil
corp
exxon
sold
the
refinery
to
pbf
energy
in
prior
to
both
incidents
the
process
hazard
analyses
identified
scenarios
in
which
hydrocarbons
flowed
into
the
air
side
of
the
fccu
and
vice
versa
due
to
a
failure
of
the
spent
catalyst
slide
valve
scsv
but
the
safeguards
listed
to
protect
against
those
scenarios
were
ineffective
the
board
said
husky
did
not
dispute
the
csb
s
finding
and
will
continue
to
work
with
the
board
while
it
conducts
its
own
investigation
into
the
explosion
said
spokesman
mel
duvall
the
csb
s
investigation
is
important
to
understanding
what
happened
duvall
said
we
are
also
continuing
with
our
own
the
csb
created
by
the
clean
air
act
has
no
regulatory
or
enforcement
authority
but
is
charged
with
determining
the
causes
of
chemical
plant
explosions
and
fires
and
making
recommendations
to
government
and
industry
given
the
similarities
between
these
two
incidents
the
csb
will
be
examining
areas
of
further
improvement
that
need
to
be
taken
by
industry
the
board
said
fccus
use
a
fine
silica
catalyst
in
high
heat
to
make
gasoline
from
gas
oil
and
the
passage
of
the
catalyst
over
the
slide
valve
at
the
superior
refinery
wore
a
hole
in
it
a
mixture
of
air
and
hydrocarbon
within
the
unit
can
easily
find
an
ignition
source
in
the
degree
fahrenheit
celsius
operating
temperature
of
the
fccu
while
we
don
t
expect
to
resume
normal
operations
at
the
refinery
until
we
remain
committed
to
our
employees
and
the
community
duvall
said
duvall
said
the
company
is
reviewing
alternatives
to
hydrogen
flouride
as
it
prepares
to
rebuild
the
refinery
for
restart
