the
polish
president
of
the
talks
said
he
hoped
ministers
would
be
able
to
unlock
issues
that
technical
negotiators
have
been
unable
to
agree
on
a
new
text
has
been
released
today
and
ministers
are
engaged
on
a
number
of
subjects
in
order
to
solve
issues
which
could
not
have
been
solved
at
the
technical
level
and
require
a
political
arbitrage
said
michal
kurtyka
antonio
guterres
returned
to
katowice
on
wednesday
for
the
talks
and
said
failure
would
send
a
disastrous
message
to
waste
this
opportunity
would
compromise
our
last
best
chance
to
stop
runaway
climate
change
it
would
not
only
be
immoral
it
would
be
suicidal
guterres
told
delegates
at
the
conference
earlier
vanuatu
s
foreign
minister
ralph
regenvanu
told
reuters
the
technical
negotiators
were
exhausted
and
had
almost
given
up
members
of
gastivists
a
network
of
grassroots
movements
against
gas
disrupted
a
european
union
side
event
organized
by
gasnaturally
an
association
of
gas
industry
bodies
at
the
same
time
that
the
european
union
has
corporate
fossil
fuel
lobbyists
talking
on
their
stage
the
european
parliament
is
voting
to
extend
fossil
fuel
subsidies
for
another
years
said
kevin
buckland
one
of
the
activists
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
will
stop
financing
coal
projects
and
nearly
all
oil
projects
it
said
on
wednesday
as
part
of
a
global
effort
by
development
banks
to
reduce
climate
change
the
bank
was
already
prioritizing
renewable
energy
and
other
green
economy
work
but
the
move
will
now
eliminate
exceptions
like
mongolia
and
kazakhstan
which
get
over
percent
of
their
domestic
energy
from
coal
