the
brazilian
government
approved
consultations
at
the
world
trade
organization
regarding
subsidies
it
says
india
gives
to
cane
producers
and
sugar
exporters
brazil
s
trade
ministry
said
brazil
said
it
has
decided
to
start
a
formal
action
at
the
wto
after
failing
to
receive
enough
information
from
india
following
letters
it
sent
to
the
indian
government
seeking
clarifications
on
sugar
policies
the
suspicion
is
that
indian
domestic
support
to
farmers
and
its
subsidies
to
sugar
exports
caused
significant
impacts
in
the
sugar
market
in
a
context
of
falling
prices
and
decreasing
production
in
the
main
centers
brazil
china
and
thailand
the
brazilian
trade
ministry
said
in
a
written
statement
late
on
tuesday
india
is
expected
to
surpass
brazil
as
the
world
s
largest
sugar
producer
in
the
current
global
sugar
crop
with
output
around
million
tonnes
while
brazil
s
production
is
expected
to
fall
almost
million
tonnes
to
below
million
tonnes
brazil
said
india
s
government
policy
to
guarantee
a
minimum
price
for
cane
to
farmers
has
caused
production
to
surge
it
says
this
policy
combined
with
subsidies
to
sugar
transportation
is
allowing
the
country
to
ship
excess
sugar
production
abroad
sugar
prices
in
new
york
reached
a
low
in
september
prices
have
recovered
a
bit
since
then
but
are
still
barely
covering
production
costs
for
most
companies
as
a
result
brazilian
mills
sharply
reduced
their
sugar
production
in
the
current
season
diverting
cane
to
ethanol
instead
and
leaving
sugar
equipment
idle
brazil
s
cane
industry
group
unica
said
it
hopes
other
sugar
producing
countries
such
as
australia
would
join
the
brazilian
government
action
at
the
wto
as
interested
parties
it
said
indian
policies
led
brazilian
mills
to
lose
around
billion
in
revenue
considering
lost
sales
and
sugar
price
falls
in
the
season
alone
unica
estimates
that
losses
worldwide
reached
around
billion
dollars
this
is
the
second
wto
case
related
to
sugar
that
brazil
starts
this
year
in
october
it
had
opened
consultations
against
tariffs
implemented
by
china
unica
s
director
eduardo
leão
told
reuters
that
a
meeting
between
brazilian
and
chinese
negotiators
regarding
that
consultation
is
scheduled
for
in
geneva
