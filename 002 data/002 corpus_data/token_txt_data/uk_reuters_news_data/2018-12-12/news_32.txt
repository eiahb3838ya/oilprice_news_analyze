opec
said
on
wednesday
it
had
offset
a
drop
in
iranian
oil
exports
and
lowered
the
forecast
of
demand
for
its
crude
underlining
the
challenge
the
producer
group
faces
to
prevent
a
glut
even
after
last
week
s
decision
to
trim
output
in
a
monthly
report
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
demand
for
its
crude
would
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
and
million
less
than
it
currently
produces
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
and
rising
supplies
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
last
week
agreed
to
return
to
supply
cuts
next
year
they
pledged
to
lower
output
by
million
bpd
of
which
opec
s
share
is
bpd
opec
expects
global
oil
demand
to
slow
next
year
and
sees
little
support
from
the
economic
backdrop
rising
trade
tensions
monetary
tightening
and
geopolitical
challenges
are
among
the
issues
that
skew
economic
risks
even
further
to
the
downside
in
opec
said
in
the
report
the
upside
appears
the
supply
cut
was
a
policy
after
the
producer
alliance
known
as
had
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
amid
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
prices
and
cover
an
expected
shortfall
in
iranian
exports
opec
changed
course
after
prices
dropped
steeply
from
a
high
above
a
barrel
in
october
on
concern
that
demand
was
weakening
amid
adequate
supply
crude
rose
on
wednesday
to
trade
above
a
barrel
in
another
sign
of
excess
supply
opec
s
report
on
wednesday
said
oil
inventories
in
developed
economies
had
risen
back
above
the
average
in
october
supply
cuts
that
began
in
by
opec
and
its
allies
had
previously
erased
an
inventory
overhang
that
weighed
on
prices
in
the
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
fell
by
only
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
november
despite
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
iranian
output
posted
the
biggest
decline
of
bpd
this
was
offset
by
increases
of
bpd
from
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
an
extra
bpd
from
the
united
arab
emirates
saudi
arabia
told
opec
it
pumped
at
a
record
rate
of
million
bpd
the
figures
suggest
there
will
still
be
a
surplus
in
the
market
next
year
should
opec
fully
deliver
the
cut
and
other
things
remain
equal
although
this
could
be
eroded
by
a
further
decline
in
iran
or
unplanned
outages
in
other
nations
qatar
plans
to
leave
opec
in
but
for
now
remains
in

opec
