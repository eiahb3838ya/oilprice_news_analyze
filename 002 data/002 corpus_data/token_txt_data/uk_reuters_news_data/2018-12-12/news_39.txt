it

concerns
about
global
oversupply
of
crude
driven
largely
by
output
from
shale
formations
has
driven
the
market
lower
in
recent
weeks
and
prompted
opec
and
some
producers
including
russia
to
cut
supply
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
for
six
months
from
the
deal
from
last

allow
more
of
a
bullish
position
to
be
taken
up

some
market
participants

point
analysts

libya
declared

on

after
tribesmen
and
state
security
guards
seized

set
to

the
world
s
top
oil
producer
ahead
of
russia
and
saudi

we
are
quite
confident
that

be
successful
in
