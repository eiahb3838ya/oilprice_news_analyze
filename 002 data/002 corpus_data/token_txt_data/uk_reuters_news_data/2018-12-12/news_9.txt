a
hack
on
italian
oil
services
firm
saipem
that
crippled
more
than
of
the
company
s
computers
used
a
variant
of
the
notorious
shamoon
virus
saipem
said
a
development
that
links
the
case
to
a
massive
attack
in
on
saudi
aramco
the
cyber
attack
hit
servers
based
in
the
middle
east
india
aberdeen
and
in
a
limited
way
italy
through
a
variant
of
shamoon
malware
the
company
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
work
is
under
way
in
a
gradual
and
controlled
manner
to
fully
restore
operations
after
the
attack
it
said
the
shamoon
virus
was
used
in
some
of
the
most
damaging
cyber
attacks
in
history
starting
in
when
it
crippled
tens
of
thousands
of
computers
at
saudi
aramco
and
rasgas
co
ltd
in
the
middle
east
attacks
that
cybersecurity
researchers
said
were
conducted
on
behalf
of
iran
saudi
aramco
is
saipem
s
biggest
customer
the
attack
crippled
between
and
servers
and
up
to
personal
computers
out
of
a
total
of
about
saipem
machines
the
company
s
head
of
digital
and
innovation
mauro
piasere
told
reuters
no
data
will
be
lost
because
the
company
had
backed
up
the
affected
computers
he
said
the
company
said
it
first
identified
the
attack
on
monday
piasere
said
the
company
does
not
know
who
was
responsible
for
the
attack
however
adam
meyers
vice
president
with
cybersecurity
firm
crowdstrike
said
he
believed
iran
was
responsible
because
early
technical
analysis
of
the
new
shamoon
variant
showed
similarities
to
the
campaign
shamoon
disables
computers
by
overwriting
a
file
known
as
the
master
boot
record
making
it
impossible
for
devices
to
start
up
former
defense
secretary
leon
panetta
has
said
the
hack
of
saudi
aramco
was
probably
the
most
destructive
cyber
attack
on
a
private
business
shamoon
went
dormant
until
it
resurfaced
in
late
in
a
series
of
middle
east
attacks
that
continued
through
early
it
went
dark
for
a
long
time
and
it
seems
to
be
back
said
eric
chien
senior
researcher
at
cybersecurity
firm
symantec
the
question
is
whether
any
others
were
affected
by
security
researchers
widely
believe
that
people
working
on
behalf
of
the
iranian
government
were
behind
previous
shamoon
attacks
which
tehran
strongly
denies
imagery
was
found
in

have
said
officials
in
iran
could
not
be
reached
