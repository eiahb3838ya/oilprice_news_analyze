annual
marine

zhoushan
wants
to
go
after
the
fuelling
business
represented
by
this
traffic
and
many
shippers
and
analysts
expect
it
to
mount
the
first
serious
challenge

vitol

while

its

such

all
operating

they

zhoushan
is
gaining
some
traction
in

to

on

but
it
still
is
quite
a
distance
behind
singapore

infrastructure
said
an

with

s
nanjing
tanker
corp
which

some
of
its

at
the
port
a
ship
can
refuel
in
around
six
hours
in
singapore
while
in
zhoushan
it
can
take
much
longer
due
to
greater
bureaucracy
according
to
industry
participants
ships
take
bunkers
in
singapore
because
of
its
efficiency
transparency
and
strict
standards
which
translate
into
saved
costs
and

the
maritime
and
port
authority
of
singapore
continues
to
implement
and
uphold
high
standards
said
an

citing
the
