room
to
maneuver
what

the
pemex
rating
in
risk
aren
t
the
projects
that
have
been
announced
he
said
what
puts
it
at
risk
is
the
financial
if
the
government
wanted
to
push
projects
in
pemex
that
went

but
said
government
spending
on

would
increase

pay
for
oil
sector
plans
he
says
earlier
finance
minister

urzua
told
lawmakers
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
that
he
was
targeting
a
primary
budget
surplus
which
excludes
interest
payments
on
past
debt
of
around
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
gdp
for
the
government
is
due
to
present
the
budget
on
saturday
urzua
said
it
was
vital
mexico
retained
the
confidence
of
financial
markets
and
international
investors
i
think
it
will
be
a
great
signal
for
the
country
and
for
the
world
urzua
said
of
the
planned
primary
surplus
we
re
a
completely
open
economy
for
better
or
worse
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
how
the
rest
of
the
world
perceives
us
especially
in
the
financial
sector
he
added
lopez
obrador
who
took
office
on
has
pledged
to
increase
pensions
and
cut
taxes
along
the
northern
border
that
has
set
a
considerable
challenge
for
urzua
and
markets
are
following
the
budget
discussions
closely
the
previous
administration
targeted
a
primary
budget
surplus
of
percent
of
gdp
the
first
such
surplus
in
a
decade
markets
have
been
skeptical
of
the
lopez
obrador
administration
since
the
former
mexico
city
mayor
said
on
he
would
cancel
a
partly
built
billion
airport
for
the
capital
arguing
the
project
was
tainted
by
corruption
that
led
to
a
dispute
with
investors
holding
some
of
the
billion
in
bonds
issued
to
finance
the
hub
s
construction
the
government
last
week
offered
to
buy
back
billion
of
the
debt
before
sweetening
its
offer
on
tuesday
urzua
said
that
what
he
called
a
restructuring
of
the
airport
debt
would
not
have
any
negative
impact
on
the
budget
nevertheless
he
said
mexico
needed
to
respect
foreign
investment
as
well
as
attract
it
to
fuel
stronger
growth
