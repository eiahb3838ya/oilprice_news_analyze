people
at
the

s
largest
alumina
refinery
brazil
s
alunorte
which
has
been
operating
at
half
capacity
since
march
due
to
an
environmental
dispute
it
said
on
wednesday
the
decision
to
close
the
plant
indefinitely
is
a
major
setback
for
the
norwegian
metals
maker
which
only
last
month
signed
two
deals
with
brazilian
authorities
that
it
believed
would
help
it
resume
full
production
hydro

on
the
news
to

making
it
the

the
price
of
aluminium
the
product
made
from
alumina
climbed
percent
to
its
highest
since

the
decision
also
triggered
a
shutdown
of
hydro
s
paragominas
bauxite
mine
which
supplies
alunorte
and
will
lead
to
the
imminent
closure
of
the
nearby

hydro
chief
executive
svein
richard
brandtzaeg
told
a
conference
call
adding
that
about
of
those
were
employees
and
contractors
at
alunorte
and
were
workers
at
paragominas
he
did
not
give
a
number
for
how
many
could
be
laid
off
at
the
albras
smelter
the
closures
will
have
significant
operational
and
financial
consequences
hydro
said
in
a
statement
alunorte
made
million
tonnes
of
alumina
in
about
percent
of
global
production
outside
china
and
enough
to
make
some
million
tonnes
of
aluminium
its
partial
shutdown
earlier
this
year
drove
up
market
prices
for
alumina
and
aluminium
the
original
output
cut
occurred
after
the
company
admitted
making
unlicensed
emissions
of
untreated
water
during
heavy
rains
but
while
hydro
said
its
problems
have
been
fixed
it
has
yet
to
convince
authorities
to
allow
a
restart
the
decision
to
halt
all
production
was
taken
as
the
refinery
s
waste
deposit
area
is
close
to
full
capacity
and
the
ongoing
dispute
is
preventing
hydro
from
using
a
newly
created
residue
facility
it
said
the
company
declared
force
majeure
earlier
this
year
on
some
alumina
deliveries
from
brazil
and
now
plans
to
expand
this
declaration
brandtzaeg
said
we
will
continue
to
work
constructively
with
the
authorities
to
lift
the
embargo
and
to
resume
operations
in
order
to
alunorte
as
the
world
s
leading
alumina
refinery
hydro
added
shares
of
alcoa
a
major
producer
of
both
alumina
and
aluminium
rose
more
than
percent
in
early
trading
while
century
aluminium
which
outsources
alumina
production
initially
fell
by
percent
