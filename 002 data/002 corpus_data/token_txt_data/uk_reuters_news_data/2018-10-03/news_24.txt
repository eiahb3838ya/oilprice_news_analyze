france
will
adopt
a
approach
to
reducing
its
reliance
on
nuclear
energy
with
a
focus
on
cutting
carbon
emissions
in
its
new
energy
plan
this
month
industrial
sources
said
this
scenario
has
been
put
forward
in
order
to
maintain
a
high
share
of
nuclear
and
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
state
as
power
utility
edf
shareholder
an
energy
industry
executive
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
told
reuters
france
s
energy
plan
ppe
for
and
is
set
to
lay
out
how
and
by
when
it
will
cut
the
share
of
nuclear
in
its
overall
power
generation
to
percent
from
percent
and
to
detail
how
many
of
edf
s
nuclear
plants
will
have
to
close
to
achieve
that
target
several
sources
involved
with
drafting
the
plan
said
that
it
will
be
framed
by
the
energy
ministry
s
strategy
and
will
attempt
to
preserve
edf
s
nuclear
fleet
an
edf
source
said
that
the
strategy
is
set
to
protect
percent
edf
from
nuclear
closures
through
a
focus
on
phasing
out
stations
the
edf
source
said
it
was
unlikely
the
plan
would
require
any
closures
before
the
end
of
president
emmanuel
macron
s
term
in
apart
from
the
already
scheduled
shutdown
of
the
two
fessenheim
reactors
unless
regulator
asn
ordered
any
macron
is
a
staunch
defender
of
the
nuclear
industry
but
is
under
pressure
from
the
left
wing
of
his
centrist
movement
following
the
resignation
of
his
popular
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
and
ahead
of
european
elections
next
year
hulot
resigned
in
frustration
over
sluggish
progress
on
climate
goals
and
nuclear
energy
policy
the
ppe
could
possibly
buy
more
time
by
delaying
a
decision
on
which
reactors
will
have
to
be
closed
until
asn
has
given
a
generic
ruling
on
the
feasibility
of
lifespan
extension
which
is
not
expected
before
edf
has
repeatedly
said
it
wants
to
extend
the
lifespan
of
its
nuclear
plants
from
to
and
even
years
and
does
not
plan
any
reactor
closures
before
other
than
fessenheim
french
daily
les
echos
reported
on
wednesday
that
edf
proposes
closing
to
reactors
between
and
while
rte
considers
six
of
edf
s
oldest
reactors
could
be
closed
between
and
the
ppe
is
also
expected
to
advise
on
edf
s
request
to
build
a
new
nuclear
plant
once
it
completes
the
flamanville
reactor
