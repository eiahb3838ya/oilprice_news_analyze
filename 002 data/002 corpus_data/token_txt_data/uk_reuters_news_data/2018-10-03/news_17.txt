donald
trump
has
blamed
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
for

and
called
on
it
to
boost
output
to
bring
down

before
the

on
the
deal
underlines
how
russia
and
saudi

are
increasingly
deciding
oil

bilaterally

consulting
with
the
rest
of
opec
the

said
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
and
his
russian
counterpart
alexander
novak
agreed
during
a
series
of
meetings
to
lift
output
from
september
through
december
as
crude
headed
towards
a
barrel
it
is
now
over
the
russians
and
the
saudis
agreed
to
add
barrels
to
the
market
quietly
with
a
view
not
to
look
like
they
are
acting
on
trump
s
order
to
pump
more
one
source
said
the
saudi
minister
told
energy
secretary
rick

will
raise

and
russia
at
a
gathering
of
oil
ministers
in

at
the
end
of

but
with
opposition
from
some
in
opec
including
iran
which
is
subject
to
sanctions
they
decided
to
defer
any
formal
decision
until
a
full
opec
meeting
in
december
saudi
is
trying
to
thread
a
needle
with
a
rope
by
satisfying
customer
concerns
about
higher
oil
prices
but
also
wanting
to
keep
prices
from
falling
and
sending
the
wrong
price
signal
to
industry
which
absolutely
needs
to
continue
to
invest
to
