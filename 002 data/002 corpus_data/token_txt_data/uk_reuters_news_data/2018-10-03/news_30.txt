have
sharply
raised
their
forecasts
for
carbon

eu
emissions
trading
system
ets
to
after
the
market
surged
more
than
percent
over
the
past
three
months
but
warned
a
correction
may
be
on
the
horizon
in
the
short
term
eu
allowances
euas
are
expected
to
average
in
and
in
according
to
a
survey
of
eight
analysts
polled
by

the
forecasts
were
up
percent
and
percent
respectively
from
prices
given
in
july
when
the
projections
were
for
euros
in
and
euros
in
analysts
increased
their
forecasts
for
to
an
average
of
up

the
ets
charges
power
plants
and
factories
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
prices
have
more
than
doubled
this
year
with
utilities
ramping
up
hedging
ahead
of
supply
cuts
coming
into
effect
from
and
as
more
speculative
traders
entered
the
market
with
the
market
being
driven
upwards
by
speculative
capital
and
with
no
obvious
trigger
to
arrest
the
bull
run
we
expect
it
will
largely
continue

analyst
trevor
sikorski
said
the
ets
has
suffered
from
excess
supply
since
the
financial
crisis
but
this
will
be
addressed
by
new
measures
starting
next
year
such
as
the
market
stability
reserve
which
will
remove
some
surplus
allowances
from
the
market
in
the
shorter
term
several
analysts
warned
that
current
prices
around
could
undergo
a
correction
just
looking
at
the
number
of
options
in
the
money
you
get
the
idea
that
if
there
s
a
bubble
in
the
market
it
may
burst
out
soon
said
matteo
mazzoni
analyst
at
nomisma
energia
in
italy
mazzoni
and
analysts
at
refinitiv
said
there
were
nearly
million
tonnes
of
open
interest
call
options
with
a
december
expiry
date
this
is
a
main
bearish
risk
factor
for
the
price
we
might
even
see
the
take
place
before
december
since
a
after
option
expiry
is
widely
expected
