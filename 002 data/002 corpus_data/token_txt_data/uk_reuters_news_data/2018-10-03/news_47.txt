canada
said
global
lng
demand
is
expected
to
double
by
with
much
of
that
growth
coming
from
asia
where
gas
is
displacing
coal
it
said
at
the
same
time
output
from
older

is
set
to
decline
in

just
as

from

southeast

prime

justin
trudeau
said
at
a
vancouver
news
conference
the
announcement
provides
a
boost
for
trudeau
s
ruling
liberals
who
have
struggled
with
an
exodus
of
global
energy
firms
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
as
well
as
setbacks
in
building
a
crude
pipeline
expansion
to
canada
s
pacific
coast
we
can
t
build
energy
projects
like
we
did
in
the
old
days
where
the
environment
and
the

were
seen
as
opposing

it

within
that
broader
number
the

has
been
pegged
at

said
it
expects
to
start
construction
on
the

in

which
will
carry
natural

from
the
montney
region
of
british
columbia
and
alberta
to
the

the
project
owners
will
provide
their

trudeau
said
the

will
boost
canada
s
oilpatch
which
has
struggled
to
attract
investment
amid
pipeline
constraints
and
investor
malaise
over
a
recent

overturning
the
approval
of
the
trans

natural

the
