s
finance
minister
nhlanhla
nene
told
a
judicial
corruption
inquiry
on
wednesday
that
he
was
fired
by
former
president
jacob
zuma
for
refusing
to
approve
a
billion
nuclear
power
deal
with
russia
in
nene
is
the
highest
profile
figure
to
give
evidence
at
a
probe
into
alleged
by
the
gupta
family
friends
of
zuma
who
are
accused
of
using
their
relationship
with
the
former
leader
to
unduly
win
state
contracts
zuma
has
repeatedly
denied
accusations
by
his
opponents
that
he
pushed
for
a
deal
with
president
vladimir
putin
at
a
brics
summit
for
russia
to
build
a
fleet
of
nuclear
power
stations
opposition
politicians
and
local
investigative
journalists
say
the
proposed
deal
which
would
have
been
the
biggest
state
contract
in
south
africa
s
history
would
have
included
huge
kickbacks
for
zuma
and
the
gupta
family
the
brothers
ajay
atul
and
rajesh
have
been
accused
of
using
their
ties
with
zuma
to
siphon
off
billions
of
rand
in
state
funds
and
of
inappropriately
influencing
cabinet
appointments
they
left
south
africa
earlier
this
year
around
the
time
zuma
resigned
under
pressure
from
his
own
party
and
the
authorities
are
seeking
their
return
to
face
prosecution
nene
in
the
first
public
account
of
the
nuclear
negotiations
said
zuma
became
hostile
towards
him
at
a
meeting
at
the
summit
when
he
refused
to
sign
a
guarantee
letter
zuma
wanted
to
present
to
putin
while
in
russia
it
was
a
very
tense
meeting
that
ended
with
us
just
being
instructed
by
the
president
to
go
and
find
a
solution
which
we
didn
t
find
nene
told
the
inquiry
i
told
the
president
in
the
meeting
that
i
could
not
sign
the
letter
without
having
first
interrogated
the
financial
and
fiscal
implications
a
spokesman
for
zuma
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
the
kremlin
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
allegations
of
corruption
have
been
swirling
around
zuma
and
the
gupta
brothers
for
years
but
the
current
inquiry
is
for
the
first
time
allowing
senior
government
officials
to
give
their
accounts
to
the
public
nene
s
testimony
is
extraordinarily
important
this
is
the
person
who
was
ceo
when
it
comes
to
the
public
purse
political
analyst
ralph
mathekga
said
before
this
evidence
it
was
difficult
to
connect
the
dots
to
zuma
but
this
is
a
smoking
gun
which
shows
zuma
was
a
protagonist
in
this
zuma
fired
nene
in
december
and
replaced
him
with
largely
unknown
lawmaker
des
van
rooyen
sending
markets
into
a
tailspin
before
zuma
appointed
pravin
gordhan
as
his
third
finance
minister
in
the
space
of
four
days
zuma
s
successor
as
president
cyril
ramaphosa
nene
finance
minister
in
february
this
year
nene
told
the
inquiry
he
lost
his
job
for
not
approving
contracts
that
would
benefit
the
gupta
family
particularly
the
russian
nuclear
deal
his
decision
to
reject
a
proposed
national
airline
route
to
sudan
on
grounds
that
it
was
not
commercially
viable
also
contributed
to
his
sacking
i
do
believe
i
was
removed
as
minister
of
finance
for
my
refusal
to
toe
the
line
in
relation
to
certain
projects
he
said
nene
s
supporters
have
portrayed
him
as
a
principled
official
who
sought
to
defend
the
country
s
strained
public
finances
against
corrupt
attacks
from
zuma
and
his
allies
however
his
detractors
including
the
radical
opposition
economic
freedom
fighters
say
he
was
involved
in
corrupt
deals
with
the
guptas
when
he
was
deputy
finance
minister
and
head
of
the
state
pension
fund
from
nene
told
the
inquiry
he
met
the
gupta
brothers
several
times
including
four
visits
to
their
family
home
in
johannesburg
between
but
said
it
was
normal
practise
to
meet
business
leaders
as
a
deputy
finance
minister
