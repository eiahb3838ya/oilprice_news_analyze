global
energy
bosses
assembled
in
moscow
on
wednesday
said
the
world
needed
russian
gas
to
keep
the
lights
on
in
a
clear
message
to
president
donald
trump
who
has
warned
he
may
impose
sanctions
on
russian
gas
export
projects
trump
s
administration
citing
what
it
calls
russia
s
failure
to
act
as
a
good
global
citizen
has
said
it
may
take
steps
to
block
the
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
which
will
increase
the
volumes
russia
can
export
to
northern
europe
the
position
has
prompted
a
backlash
from
the
kremlin
and
from
business
groups
in
germany
and
on
wednesday
leading
figures
in
the
global
energy
industry
attending
a
forum
in
the
russian
capital
joined
the
chorus
while
not
explicitly
singling
out
trump
s
policies
for
criticism
they
said
russian
gas
was
a
vital
part
of
the
energy
mix
and
that
liquefied
natural
gas
touted
by
washington
as
a
viable
alternative
was
too
expensive
royal
dutch
shell
ceo
ben
van
beurden
said
if
the
imposes
sanctions
on
export
projects
his
company
will
have
no
choice
but
to
abide
by
those
restrictions
but
he
added
it
s
clear
that
europe
will
need
more
imports
indigenous
production
in
europe
is
in
decline
we
will
need
to
import
in
europe
from
multiplicity
of
russia
has
been
a
very
reliable
supplier
of
gas
for
many
decades
the
cost
of
supply
of
russian
gas
is
probably
one
of
the
most
competitive
he
said
at
the
forum
patrick
pouyanne
chief
executive
of
french
oil
major
total
said
lng
produced
at
russia
s
yamal
project
was
highly
competitive
with
more
competitive
projects
still
to
come
i
think
it
s
just
only
the
start
of
the
story
and
this
will
be
one
of
the
largest
provinces
for
natural
gas
in
the
both
shell
and
total
have
a
vested
interest
in
keeping
russian
gas
flowing
to
world
markets
shell
is
an
investor
with
russia
s
gazprom
in
the
lng
project
off
russia
s
pacific
coast
while
total
is
an
investor
in
the
yamal
project
saudi
arabia
is
russia
s
rival
on
the
global
oil
market
but
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
who
was
also
at
the
energy
forum
said
the
world
needed
russian
gas
he
said
national
energy
firm
saudi
aramco
wanted
to
be
involved
in
delivering
russian
lng
to
world
markets
including
to
saudi
arabia
there
are
great
resources
great
conditions
in
russia
and
the
market
forces
here
in
russia
are
very
conducive
to
globalisation
and
to
allowing
this
competitive
healthy
process
of
bringing
the
cheapest
resources
to
the
markets
he
said
the
trump
administration
has
sought
to
sanction
russian
export
pipelines
before
but
stayed
its
hand
after
intense
lobbying
from
the
european
union
eu
and
business
groups
but
the
issue
has
returned
to
washington
s
agenda
this
year
russian
president
vladimir
putin
told
the
forum
that
russian
gas
exports
to
the
eu
would
this
year
reach
a
record
level
of
billion
cubic
meters
he
said
that
lng
imports
from
the
united
states
were
percent
more
expensive
than
russian
gas
and
that
the
german
economy
would
be
rendered
uncompetitive
if
it
had
to
rely
on
the
imports
referring
to
the
president
s
warnings
of
sanctions
putin
said
i
understand
donald
he
s
fighting
for
his
country
s
interests
for
his
industry
and
he
s
right
to
do
but
in
this
case
american
lng
on
the
european
market
is
more
expensive
not
by
a
bit
but
by
percent
that
s
way
too
