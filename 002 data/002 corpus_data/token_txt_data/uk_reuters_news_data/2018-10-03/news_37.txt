the
launch
of
a
massive
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
export
project
in
canada
could
fire
the
starting
gun
on
a
wave
of
other
approvals
around
the
world
potentially
curbing
a
supply
crunch
expected
after
royal
dutch
shell
on
tuesday
said
it
would
export
lng
from
the
west
of
canada
by
after
approving
a
c
billion
billion
project
capable
of
initially
producing
million
tonnes
a
year
that
comes
just
weeks
after
qatar
the
world
s
top
lng
exporter
said
it
would
expand
its
already
huge
annual
output
of
million
tonnes
to
million
tonnes
in
the
coming
years
the
canada
and
qatar
developments
will
significantly
boost
the
around
million
tonnes
of
lng
traded
per
year
helping
ease
a
supply
shortage
expected
in
the
next
decade
amid
surging
appetite
for
cleaner
fuels
from
places
such
as
china
and
wider
asia
the
projects
are
seen
as
just
the
start
with
a
host
of
other
approvals
known
as
final
investment
decisions
fids
expected
to
follow
after
waiting
in
company
drawers
while

prices
recovered
from
a
slump
lng
canada
s
fid
signals
the
appetite
to
invest
in

is
back

almost
tripling

as

gathers
steam
the

has
regained
confidence
and
is
preparing
to
invest
in
new

again
another
million

per

of

is
expected
to
be
approved
by
the
end

we
believe
could
be
the
busiest

forecasts
vary
but
lng
demand
is
expected
to
jump
to
about
million
tonnes
by
the
international
energy
agency
has
said
while
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
expects
tonnes
a
year
as
well
as
china
appetite
is
also
expected
to
grow
strongly
in
south
asia
where
india
pakistan
and
bangladesh
are
all
driving
ahead
on
lng
import
developments
if
you
look
at
the
demand
curve
and
the
supply
coming
on
stream
there
are
simply
not
enough
supply
projects
that
are
being
sanctioned
or
under
development
to
meet
demand
by
shell
s
chief
financial
officer
jessica
uhl
said
on
tuesday
the
firm
is
the
world
s
biggest
single
lng
supplier
but
the
wave
of
projects
in
the
pipeline
will
go
some
way
to
crimping
any
shortage
projects
with
a
total
of
another
million
tonnes
per
year
of
production
capacity
in
the
united
states
have
already
been
approved
and
are
expected
to
start
operations
by
the
end
of
a
host
of
other
companies
are
also
looking
to
approvals
including
for
tellurian
s
million
tonnes
driftwood
project
other
large
project
approvals
on
the
horizon
include
novatek
s
arctic
project
with
million
tonnes
capacity
after
the
russian
gas
company
s
yamal
export
facility
started
operations
smoothly
and
quickly
at
the
end
of
last
year
several
projects
are
also
planned
in
africa
including
two
in
mozambique
one
led
by
exxon
mobil
corp
and
the
other
by
anadarko
petroleum
in

exxon
expects
to
expand
its
operations
in
papua
new
guinea
and
there
are
also
plans
to
extend
australia
s
huge
facilities
even
with
strong
demand
growth
many
analysts
warn
that
not
all
lng
projects
vying
for
fid
will
make
it
especially
as
renewable
energy
is
becoming
increasingly
consultancy
deloitte
warned
during
september
s
gastech
industry
gathering
that
projects
that
failed
to
lower
costs
to
compete
with
solar
plus
storage
would
likely
fail
similarly
rbc
capital
markets
said
the
test
for
canada
lng
will
be
whether
shell
can
deliver
the
project
on
the
stated
budget
without
cost
increases
and
on
time
rbc
said
it
estimated
canada
lng
s
cost
breakeven
was
around
per
mmbtu
that
s
below
the
average
spot
lng
price
of
around
per
mmbtu
since
but
only
on
a
par
with
