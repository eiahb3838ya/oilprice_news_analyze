european
shares
rose
and
italian
bonds
rallied
on
wednesday
as
some
of
the
worries
that
have
rippled
across
markets
this
week
were
soothed
by
signs
rome
was
amenable
to
cutting
budget
deficits
and
debt
in
coming
years
while
the
euro
ceded
some
earlier
gains
against
the
dollar
to
trade
flat
on
the
day
the
positive
sentiment
rippled
across
the
atlantic
where
wall
street
looks
set
for
a
stronger
session
markets
were
lifted
on
wednesday
by
a
report
in
the
milan
daily
corriere
della
serra
later
confirmed
to
reuters
by
an
italian
government
source
that
said
the
deficit
would
fall
to
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
in
and
to
percent
in
from
the
percent
earlier
outlined
that
relieves
some
fears
that
italy
s
decision
to
expand
budget
deficits
well
beyond
what
was
agreed
by
a
previous
government
would
deepen
its
debt
problems
and
stoke
conflict
with
the
european
union
it
s
all
about
italy
today
the
news
about
a
possible
reduction
in
budget
deficits
has
been
positively
taken
by
all
markets
said
bernd
berg
global
macro
and
fx
strategist
at
woodman
asset
management
in
zurich
italian
borrowing
costs
eased
off
highs
after
jumping
basis
points
since
budget
details
emerged
last
thursday
yields
fell
bps
the
improved
mood
towards
italy
also
reduced
the
premium
investors
demand
for
holding
italian
risk
relative
to
that
of
safer
germany
to
around
bps
down
from
a
high
over
bps
on
tuesday
and
sapped
demand
for
assets
such
as
german
bonds
and
swiss
franc
the
equity
index
rose
percent
while
the
milan
bourse
jumped
more
than
one
percent
the
moves
were
led
by
an
initial
percent
bounce
in
italian
banks
the
banks
huge
government
debt
holdings
make
them
particularly
vulnerable
to
bond
selloffs
and
have
pressured
italian
stock
markets
for
months
futures
for
the
s
p
and
the
dow
were
up
around
percent
the
euro
firmed
percent
before
yielding
gains
and
trading
flat
around
as
the
dollar
cut
earlier
losses
the
single
currency
hit
a
trough
of
on
tuesday
after
an
italian
lawmaker
said
his
country
might
be
better
off
with
its
own
currency
however
the
euro
held
onto
gains
against
the
swiss
franc
and
yen
rising
around
percent
that
the
italian
government
is
trying
to
appease
its
eu
partners
can
be
seen
as
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
therefore
justifies
some
reaction
thu
lan
nguyen
a
fx
strategist
at
commerzbank
said
but
she
added
the
devil
is
in
the
details
the
euro
s
recovery
will
only
continue
if
the
new
fiscal
plans
are
also
broader
world
market
sentiment
remains
jittery
partly
because
of
the
bellicose
rhetoric
still
emerging
from
the
populist
coalition
government
in
rome
but
also
due
to
fears
that
a
tariff
dispute
will
escalate
once
china
reopens
after
a
holiday
while
president
donald
trump
agreed
a
new
trade
pact
with
mexico
and
canada
a
disputed
clause
in
the
trilateral
agreement
forbidding
similar
deals
with
countries
was
seen
as
raising
risks
for
talks
volatility
in
tech
shares
is
also
making
investors
wary
with
facebook
down
almost
percent
in
the
past
three
sessions
after
disclosing
its
worst
security
breach
ever
world
shares
were
flat
near
lows
while
msci
s
index
of
shares
outside
japan
slipped
percent
and
japan
s
nikkei
closed
percent
lower
china
s
financial
markets
are
closed
and
will
resume
trade
on
that
s
the
day
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
are
due
to
attend
meetings
meaning
news
could
emerge
on
the
trade
front
the
dollar
index
measuring
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
inched
higher
but
is
off
tuesday
s
high
of
that
gave
some
relief
to
emerging
currencies
but
the
indian
rupee
hit
a
new
record
low
and
the
indonesian
rupiah
touched
a
more
than
low
as
oil
prices
near
highs
weighed
turkey
s
lira
also
weakened
percent
as
the
country
another
oil
importer
posted
data
showing
inflation
surpassing
percent
that
increases
pressure
for
another
interest
rate
rise
after
a
bps
move
in
august
woodman
asset
management
s
berg
said
however
that
the
worst
looked
to
be
over
for
turkey
the
currency
has
appreciated
and
the
central
bank
has
hiked
rates
aggressively
so
towards
the
end
of
the
year
inflation
numbers
should
stabilise
and
to
me
the
worst
of
the
currency
crisis
is
brent
crude
inched
up
to
per
barrel
close
to
highs
of
touched
earlier
this
week
