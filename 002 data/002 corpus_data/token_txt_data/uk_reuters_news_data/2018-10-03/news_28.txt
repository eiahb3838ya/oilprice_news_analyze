russia
is
setting
records
in
gas
pipeline
exports
despite
pressure
on
europe
to
reduce
imports
and
aims
to
become
the
world
s
leading
liquefied
gas
exporter
in
the
next
decade
thanks
to
technology
it
is
developing
at
home
russian
government
officials
and
executives
told
an
industry
conference
on
wednesday
they
expect
russia
export
a
record
amount
of
gas
this
year
potentially
exceeding
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
and
beating
last
year
s
high
of
bcm
the
development
comes
despite
repeated
calls
by
the
united
states
on
europe
to
diversify
its
gas
imports
away
from
the
kremlin
s
pipeline
monopoly
gazprom
which
washington
says
is
using
energy
as
a
tool
of
intimidation
gazprom
controls
percent
of
the
gas
market
in
europe
larger
than
any
other
supplier
and
aims
to
increase
its
share
to
percent
due
to
declining
european
production
and
the
lower
cost
of
extracting
gas
in
russia
we
have
been
hearing
about
the
reduction
in
russian
supplies
for
many
years
now
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
told
the
conference
but
in
spite
of
this
europe
keeps
increasing
russian
gas
novak
said
russia
could
double
gas
exports
by
to
meet
soaring
global
demand
that
would
require
gazprom
to
build
new
pipelines
to
china
and
europe
adding
some
bcm
to
its
exports
while
russian
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exports
could
reach
million
tonnes
that
would
put
russia
on
a
par
with
qatar
the
world
s
largest
lng
producer
which
plans
to
expand
its
capacity
to
million
tonnes
by
from
million
tonnes
now
russia
is
a
fairly
modest
lng
producer
its
output
comes
from
a
project
on
sakhalin
island
off
russia
s
pacific
coast
and
a
project
led
by
private
producer
novatek
in
the
arctic
yamal
peninsula
despite
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
reluctant
to
see
russian
gas
some
cargoes
of
lng
from
yamal
have
reached
the
united
states
itself
this
year
novak
said
novatek
s
chief
executive
leonid
mikhelson
said
his
company
had
the
resources
to
boost
output
far
above
current
targets
the
company
has
said
it
could
quadruple
output
to
as
much
as
million
tonnes
of
lng
we
are
seeing
the
birth
of
a
new
industry
in
russia
said
mikhelson
adding
that
novatek
has
developed
technology
to
liquefy
gas
russia
has
up
to
now
relied
on
companies
such
as
french
oil
major
total
to
build
new
plants
and
provide
technology
and
european
sanctions
on
moscow
over
its
actions
in
ukraine
have
made
exports
of
technology
to
russia
and
the
funding
of
projects
such
as
novatek
s
yamal
challenging
the
united
states
also
aims
to
become
a
large
lng
exporter
through
its
booming
shale
gas
industry
but
mikhelson
and
gazprom
s
deputy
chief
executive
alexander
medvedev
said
russian
gas
would
still
be
cheaper
in
europe
as
the
russian
saying
goes
they
try
to
scare
us
but
we
are
not
afraid
medvedev
told
the
conference
he
added
europe
may
need
as
much
as
bcm
of
new
gas
imports
by
because
its
own
production
is
falling
