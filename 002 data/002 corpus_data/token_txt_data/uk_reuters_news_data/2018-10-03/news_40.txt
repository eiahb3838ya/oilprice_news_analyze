the
big

mover
in

italy

so
the

is
being
considered
a

than
was
priced
into
the
market
said
kyle
roda
analyst
at

the
news
has
prompted
some
buying
we
re
seeing
a
bit
of
a
relief
globally
risk
appetite
was
hit
after
european
union
officials
expressed
concerns
about
italy
s
budget
plan
which
would
widen
the
deficit
significantly
generally
sentiment
was
still
jittery
though
even
as
a
new
trade
agreement
appeared
to
ease
global
trade
tensions
a
controversial
clause
in
the
trilateral
pact
put
the
focus
back
on
the
tariff
dispute
chinese
markets
have
taken
a
hammering
this
year
as
investors
fretted
the
trade
dispute
could
put
a
significant
dent
on
growth
many
deadlines
have
come
and
gone
and
the
trade
war
continues
said
ethan
harris
global
economist
lynch
however
in
this
case
we
have
marked
our
calendar
for
november
the
date
when
the
president
donald
trump
and
his
mexican
and
canadian
counterparts
are
likely
to
sign
the
new
trilateral
trade
pact
it
is
also
the
day
trump
and
chinese
president
xi
jinping
are
attending
the
meetings
we
continue
to
believe
that
is
the
first
plausible
date
for
serious

index

gold
