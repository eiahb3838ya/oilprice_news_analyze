there
is
ample
spare
capacity
in
other
oil
producers
and
strategic
reserves
to
compensate
for
a
loss
of
venezuela
s
crude
exports
helping
explain
the
tepid
reaction
of
global
oil
prices
to
sanctions
announced
a
week
ago
venezuela
exports
around
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
about
percent
of
global
production
of
which
half
heads
to
the
united
states
many
refineries
are
designed
to
run
heavier
sour
grades
of
crude
a
good
portion
of
which
comes
from
venezuela
top
oil
exporter
saudi
arabia
could
replace
this
volume
from
spare
capacity
of
about
million
bpd
and
other
members
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
such
as
the
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
are
also
able
to
pump

an

cut
began
in

venezuela
is
one
of
the
founding
opec
members
and
was
once
a
top
three
producer
but
production
has
been
in
decline
for
years
following
the
collapse
of
the
country
s
economy
together
with
libya
and
iran
it
is
exempt
from
the
latest
supply
cut
that
earlier
decline
makes
the
potential
loss
of
venezuelan
exports
less
significant
brent
crude
the
global
benchmark
was
trading
below
a
barrel
on
tuesday
compared
to
on
the
day
after
the
united
states
imposed
sanctions
on
venezuelan
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
cutting
out
venezuela
from
the
global
oil
markets
would
provide
a
short
term
positive
strength
to
oil
prices
but
its
significance
would
be
limited
said
mihir
kapadia
chief
executive
of

global

the
would
look
elsewhere
for
oil
imports
and
refiners
will
adapt
to
in
contrast
a
strike
against
former

hugo
chavez
s
government
cut
supplies
and
boosted
prices
to
then
outrageous
levels
above
a
barrel
prompting
saudi
arabia
to
step
in
to
avert
a
supply
shortage
in

other
producers
being
able
to
pump
more
oil
the
united
states
holds
about
million
barrels
of
crude
in
its
strategic
petroleum
reserve
which
oil
executives
expect
president
donald
trump
would
tap
if
prices
spiked

the
total
volume
in
the

sour
crude
the
market
reaction
is
quite
subdued
a
senior
oil
industry
official
said
there
is
plenty
of
spare
capacity
plus
the
spr
if
needed
trump
will
not
allow
prices
to
rise
