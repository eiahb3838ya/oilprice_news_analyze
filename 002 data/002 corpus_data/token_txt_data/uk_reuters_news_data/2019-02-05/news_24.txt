interim

step
down
after

a

european
union
nations

britain
germany
and
france
on
monday
joined
the
united

canada

a
group

latin
american
countries
in

called
on
venezuela

military
which
has
remained
loyal
to
maduro
to
support
a
transition

united
states
could
attempt
to
seek
the
approval
of
the
united
nations
security
council
to
deliver
aid
without
maduro
s
cooperation
but
russia
could
block
such
a
move
maduro
s
government
overseeing
an
economic
collapse
that
has
prompted
million
venezuelans
to
flee
the
country
lashed
out
at

would
affect
