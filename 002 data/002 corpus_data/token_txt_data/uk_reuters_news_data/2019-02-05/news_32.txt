kazakh
president
nursultan
nazarbayev
on
tuesday
dismissed
reports
that
he
was
planning
a
snap
election
after
he
sought
clarification
on
a
clause
in
the
constitution
covering
the
length
of
his
term
in
a
video
address
published
online
nazarbayev
said
his
request
to
the
constitutional
court
on
monday
had
been
a
routine
one
meant
to
clarify
gaps
in
sections
covering
the
replacement
of
a
president
an
incumbent
s
resignation
and
other
areas
of
course
everyone
is
interested
in
the
elections
political
transition
he
said
yes
the
president
has
the
right
to
call
an
early
election
but
this
is
not
something
we
should
be
worried
about
so
let
us
calm
down
and
work
as
usual

added
nazarbayev
has
run
the
central
asian

three
decades

no

of
the
vote
in
his
last
vote
in
kazakhstan
is
scheduled
to
hold
both
presidential

and
some
commentators
had
suggested
authorities
might
bring
one
of
the
votes
forward
to
avoid
a
clash
nazarbayev
s
government
has
also
pushed
through
a
number
of
popular
policies
in
recent
months
including
raising
salaries
and
forcing
utilities
to
cut
and
freeze
tariffs
stoking
speculation
that
he
was
preparing
for
a
vote

the
