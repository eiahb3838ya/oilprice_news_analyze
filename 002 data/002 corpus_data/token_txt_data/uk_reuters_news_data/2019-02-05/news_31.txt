analysis-in squeezed oil industry, some rethink hunt for new barrels
london
reuters
new
partnerships
are
emerging
in
the
global
hunt
for
oil
discoveries
with
some
explorers
essentially
offering
an
outsourcing
service
for
the
riskiest
part
of
the
energy
business
central
to
this
new
strategy
are
efforts
to
find
an
ally
earlier
in
the
process
of
discovering
new
fields
and
on
a
larger
scale
in
order
to
save
money
as
budgets
remain
tight
after
the
oil
price
slump
of
while
giants
such
as
total
and
eni
revamp
exploration
bp
and
royal
dutch
shell
have
been
more
open
to
having
partners
do
the
heavy
lifting
of
exploration
in
certain
geographies
kosmos
energy
and
bp
for
example
joined
forces
to
hoover
up
exploration
licenses
in
the
northern
part
of
the
african
atlantic
rather
than
competing
against
each
other
in
october
kosmos
entered
a
similar
partnership
with
shell
to
search
for
new
oil
off
southern
africa
having
a
partner
with
a
supermajor
from
the
beginning
is
very
different
and
allows
us
to
share
cost
and
share
risks
from
the
inception
of
a
project
said
kosmos
exploration
chief
tracey
henderson
that
differs
from
what
used
to
be
a
traditional
model
where
a
company
like
kosmos
would
pick
up
acreage
in
frontier
and
emerging
basins
and
take
more
risk
upfront
then
we
would
spend
a
year
and
a
half
identifying
and
maturing
that
prospectivity
and
then
go
through
a
farmout
process
to
sell
a
stake
in
such
partnerships
responsibilities
are
clearly
defined
kosmos
is
in
charge
of
exploration
and
bp
of
developing
discoveries
into
producing
fields
bp
gets
a
nimble
partner
with
a
proven
track
record
in
kosmos
which
employs
around
people
this
compares
to
bp
s
employees
in
hundreds
of
sites
around
the
globe
all
vying
for
budget
allocation
and
embedded
in
complex
structures
we
can
make
decisions
at
lightning
speed
because
we
re
all
within
two
floors
in
the
same
building
henderson
said
what
vendors
or
what
contractors
we
can
use
it
can
be
as
simple
as
taking
a
piece
of
paper
to
another
person
s
exploration
projects
move
between
two
and
three
years
faster
in
partnership
henderson
said
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
to
see
other
sorts
of
joint
ventures
announced
as
the
year
progresses
andrew
latham
vice
president
for
global
exploration
at
research
firm
woodmac
said
of
partnerships
targeting
acreage
together
from
the
outset
other
oil
firms
are
partnering
early
at
a
different
point
in
the
exploration
cycle
but
the
aim
is
the
same
to
cut
costs
private
equity
firm
seacrest
and
technology
provider
ipulse
backed
by
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
and
private
equity
founded
oil
exploration
venture
seapulse
the
three
entities
combined
employ
only
about
people
seapulse
in
december
teamed
up
with
maersk
drilling
in
a
contract
worth
several
hundred
million
dollars
to
drill
wells
such
an
services
contract
maersk
estimates
can
shave
at
least
percent
off
the
cost
of
drilling
seapulse
says
its
portfolio
targets
billion
barrels
of
gross
prospective
resources
according
to
an
external
estimate
stretching
across
the
north
sea
the
mediterranean
the
caribbean
latin
america
southern
africa
and
latin
america
over
the
next
two
years
its
wells
will
hone
in
on
billion
barrels
of
prospective
resources
a
volume
which
if
realised
would
rival
exxon
s
gargantuan
oil
find
offshore
guyana
oil
majors
bp
chevron
eni
equinor
exxon
shell
and
total
on
average
drilled
and
operated
around
offshore
wells
over
the
last
two
years
woodmac
data
shows
imagine
it
as
an
industrial
approach
to
exploration
said
seapulse
chief
scott
aitken
adding
he
put
the
cumulative
chance
of
success
of
the
campaign
at
over
percent
with
schedule
control
to
streamline
the
use
of
rigs
teams
and
vessels
maersk
is
the
single
contractor
in
the
alliance
and
they
manage
all
the
supply
chain
so
many
overlaps
are
the
venture
also
leaves
behind
the
traditional
model
that
contributes
to
gyrations
in
drilling
costs
whereby
low
rates
hurt
services
firms
when
prices
slump
and
high
rates
hit
operators
with
seapulse
maersk
gets
more
money
for
drilling
faster
and
shares
in
the
upside
of
a
discovery
global
exploration
spending
fell
from
more
than
billion
in
when
crude
oil
sold
for
over
a
barrel
to
under
billion
last
year
when
it
fell
below
a
barrel
according
to
woodmac
costs
per
well
also
slumped
as
service
companies
scrambled
for
contracts
but
the
number
of
wells
and
companies
drilling
them
have
shrunk
since
and
success
rates
stagnated
following
a
brief
spike
in
which
stemmed
largely
from
a
focus
on
wells
near
existing
discoveries
westwood
energy
data
shows
lots
of
smaller
exploration
companies
have
disappeared
since
a
barrel
new
players
are
emerging
often
private
rob
stevens
from
westwood
said
companies
such
as
marathon
chevron
and
conocophillips
have
shifted
away
from
conventional
exploration
to
focus
on
shale
at
home
in
the
north
sea
faroe
petroleum
was
bought
by
dno
while
dyas
and
one
merged
in
recent
months
finding
new
partnerships
to
make
everyone
s
budget
go
further
is
really
a
big
priority
for
everyone
in
the
sector
the
slump
has
forced
companies
to
consider
change
in
the
way
business
is
done
existentially
