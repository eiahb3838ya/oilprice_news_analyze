europe
s
miners
and
banks
helped
world
stocks
extend
their
white
hot
start
to
the
year
on
tuesday
while
the
dollar
was
straining
for
a
fourth
day
of
gains
as
traders
waited
for
president
donald
trump
s
state
of
the
union
address
the
federal
reserve
s
cautious
turn
last
month
was
continuing
to
drive
up
appetite
for
riskier
assets
but
there
were
also
a
number
of
idiosyncratic
factors
feeding
outsized
moves
news
that
oil
giant
bp
had
doubled
it
profits
and
another
tickup
in
crude
prices
overnight
pushed
the
oil
and
gas
sector
up
percent
miners
were
also
up
sharply
as
traders
digested
news
that
brazil
had
ordered
vale
the
world
s
largest
iron
ore
miner
to
close
eight
of
its
dams
following
a
deadly
collapse
that
killed
over
people
last
month
iron
ore
prices
surged
percent
at
the
end
of
last
week
in
anticipation
of
the
move
and
are
now
at
a
near
high
our
fundamental
view
is
there
no
reason
for
this
incredible
move
so
is
it
just
speculation
a
frenzy
about
possible
stimulus
in
china

what
should
we
do
with

i
don
t
know
but
it
should
be
china
and
large
parts
of
asia
were
closed
for
lunar
new
year
celebrations
overnight
but
the
bits
that
were
open
made
some
headway
too
japan
s
nikkei
average
marked
its
highest
level
in
seven
weeks
at
one
point
before
fading
to
finish
slightly
lower
australian
shares
suffered
no
such
fatigue
they
jumped
percent
with
financials
surging
on
after
a
special
misconduct
inquiry
left
the
structure
of
the
country

powerful
banks
in

on

msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
reached
a
high
it
has
just
had
its
best
january
on
record
rising
more
than
percent
from
a
near
low
hit
in
late
december
having
changed
tack
on
rate
rises
last
week
the
fed
took
the
unusual
step
of
issuing
a
statement
on
monday
saying
that
its
head
jerome
powell
had
told
president
donald
trump
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
that
the
path
of
policy
will
depend
entirely
on
incoming
economic
in
the
currency
markets
the
dollar
held
on
to
recent
gains
against
its
major
peers
as
investors
continued
to
friday

strong
payrolls

and
a
manufacturing
survey
the
dollar
index
against
six
major
currencies
was
a
fraction
higher
at
having
gained
percent
the
previous
day
the
euro
weakened
slightly
to
as
data
showing
euro
zone
business
growth
almost
stalled
in
january
knocked
it
further
away
from
a
high
of
set
last
week
the
australian
dollar
gained
percent
to
erasing
earlier
losses
after
the
reserve
bank
of
australia
left
policy
unchanged
at
its
first
meeting
this
year
but
sounded
less
dovish
than
the
markets
had
wagered
on
the

earlier
fallen

as
much
as
percent
after
a
slump
in
retail
sales
reinforced
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
economy
traders
focus
was
already
shifting
to
president
donald
trump
s
delayed
state
of
the
union
address
due
at
et
gmt
wednesday
as
well
as
ism
figures
also
due
later
in
the
day
trump
told
a
white
house
event
over
the
weekend
that
he
might
declare
a
national
emergency
because
democrats
in
congress
weren
t
moving
toward
a
deal
to
provide
money
to
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
such
a
step
would
likely
prompt
a
court
challenge
from
democrats
if
president
trump
persists
in
his
wall
along
the
border
in
the
upcoming
address
it
would
cap
the
