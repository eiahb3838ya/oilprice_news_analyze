steel
pipe
maker
tenaris
will
team
up
with
severstal
one
of
russia
s
largest
steel
producers
to
make
steel
pipes
in
the
heart
of
russia
s
oil
and
gas
sector
in
siberia
they
said
on
tuesday
new
industrial
projects
with
western
partners
have
been
rare
in
russia
in
the
last
five
years
because
of
sanctions
imposed
on
moscow
but
the
venture
between
tenaris
and
severstal
relies
on
the
main
source
of
russia
s
budget
revenue
oil
and
gas
exports
the
production
will
be
located
in
close
proximity
to
the
main
oil
and
gas
companies
which
will
ensure
cost
efficiency
both
for
us
and
our
customers
operations
alexey
mordashov
severstal
s
board
chairman
said
in
the
statement
tenaris
and
severstal
aim
to
serve
the
market
for
welded
octg
pipe
products
in
russia
and
neighbouring
countries
octg
stands
for
oil
country
tubular
goods
which
are
tubes
that
are
used
in
oil
and
gas
production
the
octg
market
is
dominated
by
seamless
pipes
but
welded
pipes
are
cheaper
and
the
partners
hope
to
turn
this
factor
to
their
competitive
advantage
mordashov
told
a
briefing
in
moscow
their
joint
venture
will
build
a
welded
pipe
plant
to
produce
octg
products
in
siberia
s
surgut
area
the
plant
with
annual
production
capacity
of
tonnes
will
require
an
investment
of
million
severstal
will
obtain
a
percent
interest
in
the
joint
venture
with
tenaris
owning
the
remaining
percent
partners
plan
to
share
the
investment
on
the
same
basis
and
do
not
expect
to
borrow
funds
for
it
the
plant
will
launch
production
in
but
will
reach
full
capacity
only
in
we
will
need
time
to
reach
the
required
level
of
quality
and
build
mutual
relationship
with
customers
at
the
same
time
of
course
we
will
try
to
make
it
faster
mordashov
said
once
running
at
full
capacity
the
plant
will
supply
between
and
percent
of
russian
octg
market
paolo
rocca
tenaris
chief
executive
told
the
same
briefing
the
final
market
share
will
depend
on
demand
for
welded
pipes
and
services
which
the
partners
plan
to
offer
to
the
market
mordashov
said
today
we
see
that
oil
companies
have
to
conduct
production
at
more
complex
fields
all
this
may
cause
additional
growth
in
demand
for
such
products
we
just
expect
that
our
production
in
surgut
will
be
the
answer
to
those
challenges
that
oil
companies
may
encounter
