participants

and

essen
germany
brexit
is
binding
many
resources
in
each
of
our
clients
organisations
as
well
as
with
the
clearing
banks
and
we
can
all
understand
that
it
has
the
highest
priority
that
there
is
seamless
cooperation
on
our
european
energy
markets
he
added
eex
the
world
s
biggest
power
exchange
hopes
the
contract
will
attract
interest
from
major
lng
participants
that
have
entered
the
asian
physical
spot
market
in
recent
years
as
it
widens
its
global
presence
in
other
products
the
move
will
pit
the
exchange
owned
by
deutsche
boerse
against
local
players
in
the
world
s
energy
region
as
it
looks
to
build
a
global
presence
lng
is
the
perfect
platform
to
move
from
regional
gas
to
global
gas
laege
said
it
is
very
natural
that
we
take
our
product
offering
to
the
region
where
the
demand
is
and
where
the
clients
are
he
added
the
eex
is
the
first
exchange
to
try
to
become
a
globally
integrated
power

its
lng
products
will
be
settled
against

published
by

global
platts
which
has
come
to
dominate
the
booming
physical
lng
spot
market
in
asia
together
with
its
gas
hub
prices
in
europe
eex
says
traders
will
be
able
to
hedge
their
lng
cargoes
and
optimise
their
energy
portfolio
up
to
two
years
in
advance
eex
hopes
this
will
attract
interest
from
major
lng
market
participants
who
have
entered
the
asian
physical
spot
market
in
recent
years
so
far
mostly
and
that
this
will
spread
more
to
local
players
eex
also
plans
to
start
offering
wholesale
power
products
in
japan
although
this
was
more
medium
term
it
also
plans
iron
ore
and
freight
futures
there
is
a
high
level
of
overlap
of
clients
interested
in
all
these
products
laege
said
eex
s
asian
expansion
flagged
by
deutsche
boerse
last
year
will
put
eex
into
competition
with
incumbents
in
a
market
where
a
number
of
contacts
have
failed
in
recent
years
due
to
a
lack
of
support
many
have
come
and
few
have
succeeded
in
this
area
what
is
required
is
a
set
of
committed
market
makers
across
products
who
are
given
a
natural
position
to
trade
from
the
start
said
andrew
koscharsky
director
for
energy
products
at
commodity
trading
house
rcma
group
in
singapore
the
singapore
exchange
sgx
launched
asian
lng
futures
in
but
trading
has
been
light
while
the
japan
electric
power
exchange
s
jepx
wholesale
electricity
futures
have
attracted
only
moderate
interest
since
launching
in
in
freight
and
iron
ore
eex
will
have
to
compete
with
sgx
and
china
s
dalian
commodity
exchange
dce
to
succeed
traders
say
the
german
group
needs
to
open
itself
to
smaller
participants
as
well
as
major
companies
that
can
act
as
market
makers
by
providing
constant
liquidity
china
s
exchanges
such
as
dalian
and
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
which
last
year
launched
crude
oil
futures
have
been
driven
by
local
traders
to
attract
liquidity
eex
says
it
will
exploit
the
and
netting
opportunities
that
exist
within
its
contract
range
cutting
down
payments
to
cover
open
liabilities
eex
