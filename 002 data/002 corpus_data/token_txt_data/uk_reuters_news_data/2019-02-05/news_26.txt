world
stocks
extended
their
start
to
the
year
on
tuesday
while
the
dollar
was
straining
for
a
fourth
day
of
gains
as
traders
awaited
president
donald
trump
s
state
of
the
union
address
the
federal
reserve
s
recent
caution
continued
to
feed
risk
appetite
but
there
were
a
number
of
idiosyncratic
factors
marching
markets
higher
news
that
oil
giant
bp
had
doubled
its
profits
saw
europe
s
oil
and
gas
sector
jump
percent
and
propelled
london
s
ftse
toward
its
longest
winning
streak
since
april
wall
street
futures
were
pointing
up
again
while
miners
were
strong
globally
as
well
after
news
that
brazil
had
ordered
the
world
s
largest
iron
ore
miner
vale
to
close
eight
of
its
dams
in
the
wake
of
a
deadly
collapse
last
month
iron
ore
prices
surged
percent
at
the
end
of
last
week
in
anticipation
of
the
move
and
are
now
at
a
near
high
our
fundamental
view
is
there
no
reason
for
this
incredible
move
so
is
it
just
speculation
a
frenzy
about
possible
stimulus
in
china
said
saxo

hardy
what
should
we
do
with

don

know

be
china
and
large
parts
of
asia
had
been
closed
for
lunar
new
year
celebrations
overnight
but
the
markets
that
were
open
made
some
headway
japan
s
nikkei
average
marked
its
highest
level
in
seven
weeks
before
fading
to
finish
slightly
lower
australian
shares
suffered
no
such
fatigue
they
jumped
percent
with
financials
surging
after
a
misconduct
inquiry
left
the
structure
of
the
country
s
powerful
banks
in
place
wall
street
was
still
being
cheered
after
technology
and
industrials
helped
the
s
p
and
nasdaq
break
through
moving
averages
on
monday
and
sent
the
vix
fear
gauge
to
a
low
futures
had
the
s
p
dow
and
nasdaq
opening
percent
higher
and
with
europe
still
rallying
msci
s
gauge
of
stocks
across
the
globe
scaled
fresh
highs
following
its
best
january
on
record
in
the
currency
markets
the
dollar
held
on
to
recent
gains
against
its
major
peers
as
investors
waited
on
monthly
ism
survey
data
having
lapped
up
friday
s
strong
payrolls
number
and
a
manufacturing
survey
after
reining
in
rate
hike
expectations
last
week
the
fed
took
the
unusual
step
of
issuing
a
statement
on
monday
saying
that
its
head
jerome
powell
had
told
president
donald
trump
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
that
the
path
of
policy
will
depend
entirely
on
incoming
economic
the
dollar
s
index
against
six
major
currencies
was
a
fraction
higher
at
having
gained
percent
on
monday
while
treasury
yields
were
also
creeping
up
again
the
euro
weakened
slightly
to
after
data
showing
euro
zone
business
growth
almost
stalled
in
january
but
the
bigger
moves
were
elsewhere
the
swiss
franc
looked
to
be
heading
for
another
spell
of
parity
against
the
dollar
after
falling
across
the
board
some
of
its
sharpest
losses
were
against
currencies
such
as
the
australian
dollar
which
was
lifted
to
overnight
when
the
central
bank
sounded
less
dovish
than
markets
had
wagered
as
it
kept
interest
rates
on
hold
with
the
franc
breaking
through
parity
some
stops
seem
to
have
triggered
in
a
broadly
market
said
kamal
sharma
director
of
fx
strategy
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
traders
attention
was
already
shifting
to
trump
s
delayed
state
of
the
union
address
due
at
et
gmt
wednesday
he
told
a
white
house
event
over
the
weekend
that
he
might
declare
a
national
emergency
because
democrats
in
congress
weren
t
moving
toward
a
deal
to
provide
money
to
build
a
wall
on
the
border
with
mexico
such
a
step
would
likely
prompt
a
court
challenge
from
democrats
but
there
will
also
be
focus
on
what
message
trump
sends
on
issues
like
the
ongoing
trade
war
with
china
and
potentially
some
other
parts
of
the
world
if
president
trump
persists
in
his
wall
along
the
border
in
the
upcoming
address
it
would
cap
the
dollar
s
rally
