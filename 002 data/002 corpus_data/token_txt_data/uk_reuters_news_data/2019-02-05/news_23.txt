president
dalia
grybauskaite

will
step
up
its
activity
during
the
election
cycle
the
agencies
wrote
in
a
joint
annual
assessment
published
on
tuesday
it
is
possible
that
russia
will
seek
to
sway
the
course
of
the
elections
by
information
and
cyber
moscow
could
disseminate
propaganda
and
disinformation
in
lithuanian
social
media
it
said
kremlin
spokesman
dmitry
peskov
said
the
suggestion
was
absolute
nonsense
adding
russia
does
not
interfere
in
elections
in
other
russia
is
also
suspected
of
carrying
out
a
number
of
notable
cyber
attacks

a
concerted
assault
on
the
information
systems
of
another
baltic
state
estonia

in

denies

to
help
him
win

in
allegations
that
both
sides
deny

report
said
russia
was
basing
more
tanks
and
bombers
in
the
kaliningrad
enclave
which
borders
lithuania
and
poland
and
upgrading
its
bases
there
to
be
able
to
deploy
missiles
including
the
iskander
the
report
also
said
there
was
a
growing
risk
of
unintentional
incidents
from
increased
military
manoeuvres
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
the
agencies
said
they
had
observed
russian
intelligence
targeting
people
in

s
energy
sector
and
trying
to
hack
into
control
systems
to
gain
the
ability
to
disrupt
lithuania
s
electricity
supply
this
is
far
from
our
priority

kremlin
s
peskov
said
recently

putin
opened
a
gas
liquefaction
plant
which
guaranteed
kaliningrad
s
in

expanding
its
liquefied
natural
