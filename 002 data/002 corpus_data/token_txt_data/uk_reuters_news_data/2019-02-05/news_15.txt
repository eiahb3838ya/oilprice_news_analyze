cut
local
reliance
on
wood
and
charcoal
the
fuels
most
households
and
tea
factories
use
in
the
east
african
nation
of
million
people
we
expect

have
affordable
gas
which
is
environmentally
friendly

can
use
gas
instead

charcoal
the

with
industries
like

firewood
they
use

the
shores
of

kivu
are
much
more
densely

it
would
finance
build
and
maintain
a
gas
extraction
processing
and
compression
plant
to
sell
methane
domestically

abroad
the
