washington
reuters
the
united
states
has
sent
food
and
medicine
to
colombia
s
border
with
venezuela
officials
said
on
tuesday
although
it
is
still
unclear
how
the
aid
will
get
past
the
objections
of
president
nicolas
maduro
who
has
blocked
shipments
in
the
past
two
officials
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
said
the
aid
will
be
staged
at
the
main
border
crossing
at
cucuta
one
official
said
more
supplies
would
be
staged
in
brazil
and
in
the
caribbean
i
anticipate
having
perhaps
a
dozen
locations
all
around
venezuela
where
such
aid
will
be
staged
the
official
said
the
officials
said
trucks
carrying
the
aid
including
foods
would
arrive
in
cucuta
this
week
at
the
request
of
venezuelan
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
who
last
month
declared
himself
to
be
the
south
american
nation
s
interim
president
opposition
lawmaker
miguel
pizarro
told
reporters
in
caracas
on
tuesday
that
guaido
s
team
would
talk
about
how
the
aid
would
move
once
it
was
in
place
shipments
were
also
coming
from
venezuelan
companies
abroad
colombia
canada
and
germany
a
senior
administration
official
said
it
was
up
to
guaido
to
decide
when
and
how
to
move
the
supplies
into
the
country
we
will
seek
to
help
him
to
do
so
by
whatever
means
possible
the
official
said
prepositioning
aid
in
warehouses
or
in
truck
convoys
at
border
posts
for
weeks
or
sometimes
months
is
common
while
officials
negotiate
safe
passage
franklin
graham
chief
executive
of
relief
group
samaritan
s
purse
and
the
son
of
renowned
christian
evangelist
billy
graham
said
until
humanitarian
groups
had
access
inside
venezuela
most
aid
likely
would
remain
outside
samaritan
s
purse
has
operated
for
the
past
three
years
in
cucuta
giving
food
medicine
and
backpacks
to
venezuelans
heading
to
colombia
on
foot
the
group
also
has
managed
to
get
a
small
amount
of
aid
inside
the
country
which
graham
called
a
drop
in
the
bucket
compared
to
what
is
needed
the
government
of
venezuela
needs
to
open
the
borders
that
s
it
open
the
borders
and
let
food
convoys
come
into
your
country
open
up
your
airports
and
let
food
flights
fly
in
said
graham
who
said
he
spoke
to
president
donald
trump
about
the
situation
in
december
we
are
preparing
to
fly
in
as
soon
as
we
get
the
green
light
he
said
the
cucuta
crossing
was
mainly
quiet
on
tuesday
but
police
officials
told
reuters
that
more
migrants
have
been
asking
where
humanitarian
aid
will
be
delivered
in
the
nearby
border
town
of
la
parada
hundreds
of
people
some
in
wheelchairs
lined
up
in
the
hot
sun
to
buy
medicine
maria
gomez
a
seamstress
arrived
from
san
cristobal
in
northern
venezuela
to
buy
her
elderly
mother
the
losartan
pills
she
needs
for
hypertension
it
s
cheap
here
i
always
come
she
said
as
a
pharmacist
handed
over
the
pills
we
can
not
buy
drugs
in
venezuela
you
die
before
you
get
pressure
is
growing
on
maduro
to
step
down
after
more
than
a
dozen
european
union
nations
on
monday
joined
the
united
states
canada
and
a
group
of
latin
american
countries
in
recognising
guaido
as
venezuela
s
legitimate
leader
however
russia
china
and
turkey
continue
to
back
maduro
accusing
western
nations
of
meddling
the
guaido
the
head
of
venezuela
s
national
assembly
has
galvanized
the
opposition
with
a
hopeful
message
he
has
repeatedly
called
on
venezuela
s
military
which
has
remained
loyal
to
maduro
to
support
a
transition
to
democracy
the
united
states
could
attempt
to
seek
the
approval
of
the
united
nations
security
council
to
deliver
aid
without
maduro
s
cooperation
but
russia
would
likely
block
such
a
move
so
far
maduro
has
rejected
foreign
aid
we
are
not
beggars
you
want
to
humiliate
venezuela
and
i
will
not
let
our
people
be
humiliated
he
said
on
monday
maduro
s
government
overseeing
an
economic
collapse
that
has
prompted
million
venezuelans
to
flee
the
country
lashed
out
at
the
eu
nations
for
recognising
guaido
accusing
them
of
submitting
to
a
strategy
to
overthrow
the
legitimate
with
maduro
in
control
of
venezuela
s
military
and
all
the
territory
getting
aid
in
will
be
hard
said
jeremy
konyndyk
a
senior
fellow
at
the
center
for
global
development
who
cautioned
against
politicizing
the
assistance
the
more
it
looks
like
an
overt
attack
on
the
authority
of
maduro
that
makes
the
aid
more
of
a
target
said
konyndyk
who
has
led
government
responses
to
international
disasters
