trump to press border wall fight in state of the union speech
washington
feb
reuters
president
donald
trump
on
tuesday
was
set
to
deliver
a
state
of
the
union
speech
challenging
democrats
to
approve
funding
for
his
border
wall
but
stopping
short
of
declaring
a
national
emergency
over
it
at
least
for
now
at
gmt
wednesday
before
a
joint
session
of
congress
trump
will
likely
stir
contention
with
remarks
on
immigration
policy
after
his
demand
for
billion
in
wall
funds
triggered
a
historic
partial
government
shutdown
that
more
than
half
of
americans
blamed
him
for
according
to
polling
millions
of
americans
were
expected
to
be
watching
the
address
on
television
giving
trump
his
biggest
opportunity
to
date
to
explain
why
he
believes
a
barrier
is
needed
on
the
southern
border
with
mexico
the
speech
was
delayed
for
a
week
because
of
the
shutdown
that
ended
on
when
he
takes
center
stage
in
the
chamber
of
the
house
of
representatives
for
the
big
speech
sitting
behind
him
over
his
shoulder
will
be
his
main
congressional
adversary
democrat
nancy
pelosi
who
became
house
speaker
after
her
party
won
control
of
the
chamber
in
november
s
elections
she
has
shown
no
sign
of
budging
from
her
opposition
to
trump
s
demand
that
has
led
trump
to
contemplate
declaring
a
national
emergency
which
he
says
would
let
him
reallocate
funding
from
elsewhere
without
congressional
action
but
a
source
close
to
trump
said
the
president
was
not
expected
to
take
that
step
which
would
likely
draw
a
swift
court
challenge
from
democrats
instead
he
will
urge
a
congressional
committee
to
do
a
border
security
deal
by
he
s
going
to
set
the
stage
the
source
said
he
ll
tell
people
here
s
why
i
should
but
say
i
m
giving
congress
another
chance
to
trump
s
speech
will
also
offer
an
olive
branch
to
opponents
as
he
looks
toward
the
election
targeting
areas
he
sees
for
potential
bipartisan
agreement
such
as
infrastructure
improvements
lowering
prescription
drug
costs
and
healthcare
a
senior
administration
official
said
trump
would
encourage
congress
to
reject
the
politics
of
resistance
and
retribution
and
instead
adopt
a
spirit
of
cooperation
and
compromise
so
we
can
achieve
but
that
message
could
be
undermined
with
trump
threatening
to
go
his
own
way
on
the
wall
if
he
can
not
get
congress
to
approve
the
funding
he
wants
on
sunday
trump
tweeted
if
there
is
no
wall
there
is
no
he
has
said
the
wall
which
he
promised
in
his
campaign
is
needed
to
deter
illegal
immigration
and
drugs
some
republicans
are
urging
trump
not
to
declare
an
emergency
i
m
for
whatever
works
that
prevents
the
level
of
dysfunction
we
ve
seen
on
full
display
here
the
last
month
and
also
doesn
t
bring
about
a
view
on
the
president
s
part
that
he
needs
to
declare
a
national
emergency
senate
majority
leader
mitch
mcconnell
told
reporters
last
week
trump
will
also
address
foreign
policy
including
support
for
an
effort
to
coax
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
into
leaving
power
declaring
the
islamic
state
militant
group
all
but
defeated
and
perhaps
announcing
where
he
will
next
meet
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
he
will
also
give
an
update
on
trade
talks
with
the
chinese
trump
vice
president
mike
pence
and
white
house
acting
chief
of
staff
mick
mulvaney
went
over
the
speech
on
monday
night
with
about
a
dozen
supporters
including
former
campaign
aides
corey
lewandowski
and
david
bossie
as
well
as
matt
schlapp
chairman
of
the
american
conservative
union
a
source
familiar
with
the
meeting
said
the
source
said
trump
would
discuss
troop
drawdowns
in
syria
and
afghanistan
and
that
about
half
the
speech
would
be
devoted
to
foreign
policy
trump
will
also
claim
success
on
economic
policy
including
cutting
federal
regulations
the
source
said
some
democrats
have
invited
guests
to
the
speech
to
highlight
various
causes
some
at
odds
with
trump
s
policies
making
a
raucous
atmosphere
possible
inside
the
house
chamber
representative
pramila
jayapal
said
on
monday
she
would
invite
climate
scientist
lisa
graumlich
dean
of
the
college
of
the
environment
at
the
university
of
washington
as
her
guest
to
underscore
the
climate
change
issue
one
thing
you
will
see
is
that
the
chamber
is
full
and
the
president
is
surrounded
by
women
by
people
of
color
by
individuals
who
have
really
been
hurt
by
this
president
and
many
of
the
actions
that
he
has
taken
jayapal
said
republican
strategist
and
former
white
house
official
raj
shah
said
the
speech
offered
trump
a
chance
to
turn
the
page
washington
right
now
looks
a
little
bit
petty
and
a
little
bit
small
and
the
state
of
the
union
is
an
opportunity
to
go
big
and
talk
in
broad
themes
about
what
s
good
about
america
and
look
beyond
some
of
the
issues
of
the
last
few
weeks
