update 2-bp's 2018 profit doubles to 5-year high as output soars
london
reuters
bp
joined
its
competitors
in
posting
a
strong
performance
with
a
doubling
of
profits
driven
by
strong
growth
in
oil
and
gas
output
following
a
large
shale
acquisition
record
utilization
of
its
oil
and
gas
fields
and
refining
capacity
further
helped
bp
seal
what
was
a
transformational
year
as
the
aftermath
of
the
deadly
deepwater
horizon
disaster
eased
but
while
the
firm
s
revenue
beat
forecasts
debt
rose
and
the
pace
of
its
share
buyback
scheme
slowed
in
the
last
quarter
after
it
paid
the
first
and
largest
tranche
of
the
billion
bhp
acquisition
bp
shares
rose
more
than
percent
in
early
trade
hitting
their
highest
since
early
december
we
now
have
a
powerful
track
record
of
safe
and
reliable
performance
efficient
execution
and
capital
discipline
and
we
re
doing
this
while
growing
the
business
bp
chief
executive
officer
bob
dudley
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
royal
dutch
shell
exxon
mobil
and
chevron
all
reported
earnings
last
week
driven
by
higher
production
in
shale
basins
where
oil
majors
have
invested
billions
in
recent
years
the
strong
gains
came
despite
a
sharp
drop
in
crude
prices
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
wiped
out
most
gains
made
in
share
prices
throughout
the
year
uncertainty
over
the
outlook
for
oil
prices
as
well
as
concerns
over
global
economic
growth
and
trade
tensions
are
likely
to
continue
to
weigh
on
the
sector
chief
financial
officer
brian
gilvary
told
reuters
he
expected
brent
crude
prices
to
hold
around
current
levels
of
a
barrel
in
while
demand
was
expected
to
rise
by
to
million
barrels
per
day
a
similar
pace
to
that
seen
in
capital
expenditure
will
be
to
billion
this
year
after
reaching
billion
in
gilvary
said
bp
plans
to
sell
billion
of
assets
over
the
next
two
years
to
help
pay
for
the
bhp
deal
including
a
suite
of
fields
in
the
united
states
as
it
focuses
on
the
most
attractive
basins
he
added
after
settling
the
vast
majority
of
payments
for
the
spill
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
totaling
nearly
billion
bp
has
more
recently
focused
on
growing
production
into
the
next
decade
including
the
bhp
deal
which
is
its
largest
in
years
for
the
year
bp
s
profit
rose
to
a
high
of
billion
double
the
previous
year
s
billion
and
above
analyst
expectations
of
billion
overall
we
see
this
as
a
strong
set
of
results
with
stronger
underlying

translating
