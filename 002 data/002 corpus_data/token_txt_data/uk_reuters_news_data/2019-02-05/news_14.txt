donald
trump
s
new
pick
to

the

a
step
closer
to
becoming
the
permanent
head
of
america
s
top
environmental
regulator
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
a
washington
insider
with
years
of
experience
in
congress
was
nominated
by
trump
last
month
to
replace
scott
pruitt
who
resigned
in
july
after
widespread
criticism
for
alleged
ethical
missteps
his
nomination
has
cheered
business
interests
keen
to
see
reduced
regulation
but
upset
democrats
and
conservation
groups
worried
that
environmental
rollbacks
under
the
trump
administration
are
going
too
far
the
senate
committee
on
environment
and
public
works
advanced
wheeler
s
nomination
with
republican
members
in
favor
and
democrats
against
a
full
senate
vote
must
now
be
scheduled
to
complete
his
confirmation
mr
wheeler
has
done
an
outstanding
job
as
the
acting
administrator
over
the
past
six
months
republican
senator
john
barrasso
chairman
of
the
committee
said
shelley
moore
capito
republican
senator
from
west
virginia
said
wheeler
worked
to
improve
transparency
at
the
agency
wheeler
was
not
present
at
the
meeting
democratic
senators
questioned
wheeler
s
years
of
past
experience
serving
for
the
interests
of
the
industries
that
he
would
be
regulating
in
many
instances
wheeler
has
gone
further
than
his
predecessor
in
his
rejection
of
important
measures
democrat
senator
tom
carper
ranking
member
of
the
committee
said
in
his
opening
remarks
while
running
epa
on
an
interim
basis
wheeler
oversaw
the
weakening
of
rules
limiting
carbon
and
mercury
emissions
from
power
plants
and
advanced
an
initiative
to
lift
a
summertime
ban
on
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
that
was
enacted
to
curb
smog
like
pruitt
he
held
nearly
times
more
meetings
with
industry
representatives
than
with
conservationists
during
his
first
two
months
on
the
job
according
to
a
copy
of
his
schedule
reviewed
by
reuters
and
during
his
confirmation
hearing
last
month
he
said
he
did
not
believe
climate
change
was
not
a
major
crisis
a
stance
that
resonates
with
trump
s
skepticism
but
which
clashes
with
the
scientific
consensus
that
global
warming
will
have
devastating
consequences
if
not
addressed
urgently
