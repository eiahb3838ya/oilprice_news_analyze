moves
by
the
european
commission
to
make
britain
charge
tax
on
commodity
derivatives
trading
will
include
ice

europe
the
london
platinum
and

lme
trading
sources
say
the
commission
has
been
looking
at
vat
on
commodity
derivatives
trading
in
the
uk
for
some
years
but
sources
say
recent
activity
is
part
of
a
drive
to
pressure
britain
ahead
of
its
european
union
withdrawal
in
march
last
month
the
commission
referred
britain
to
the
european
court
of
justice
for
extending
the
scope
of
measures
that
allow
commodity
derivatives
traded
on
terminal
markets
in
the
uk
to
be
zero
rated
for
vat
the
referral
follows
the
united
kingdom
s
failure
to
bring
its
legislation
into
line
with
eu
vat
law
following
the
commission
s
reasoned
opinion
in
july
the
commission
executive
arm
of
the
eu
said
on
its
website
if
britain
leaves
the
eu
without
an
exit
deal
there
will
be
no
case
to
answer
but
any
deal
that
keeps
the
uk
subject
to
eu
rules
could
mean
significantly
higher
costs
for
europe
s
commodity
trading
community
this
is
the
latest
stage
in
ongoing
discussions
with
the
commission
over
the
uk
s
vat
treatment
of
certain
commodity
derivatives
the
uk
treasury
said
this
does
not
have
any
immediate
effect
on
uk
tax
law
on
commodity
derivatives
we
will
respond
in
due
the
terminal
markets
order
tmo
which
allows
zero
vat
to
be
applied
to
commodity
derivatives
trading
was
agreed
in
why
hasn
t
this
come
up
before
they
are
trying
to
kill
our
commodity
markets
a
commodity
trading
source
said
the
source
added
that
uk
authorities
would
have
made
sure
everything
was
in
order
as
commodities
trading
had
expanded
over
the
years
futures
