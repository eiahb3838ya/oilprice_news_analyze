ukraine
and
russia
said
they
will
hold
further
european
talks
on
supplying
europe
with
russian
gas
in
a
key
first
step
towards

european
commission
maros
sefcovic
who
chaired
a
meeting
in
berlin
with
ukraine
s
foreign
minister
pavlo
klimkin
and
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
he
hoped
talks
will
continue
with
separate
political
and
expert
rounds
every
six
to
eight
weeks
the
talks
have
been
complicated
by
a
lengthy
legal
dispute
between
russian
and
ukraine
s
energy
companies
resulting
in
court
rulings
in
february
that
both
must
compensate
each
other
naftogaz
emerged
the
net
winner
however
gaining
billion
from
gazprom
with
russia
embroiled
in
conflict
with
kiev
over
breakaway
regions
in
ukraine
s
east
and
the
european
union
reliant
on
russian
gas
to
fuel
its
industries
the
future
of
gas
transit
seen
by
kiev
as
a
crucial
guarantor
of
its
independence
from
moscow
is
the
object
of
intricate
diplomacy
ukraine
has
been
a
key
route
for
carrying
russian
gas
to
europe
where
it
supplies
around
a
third
of
gas
needs
but
moscow
and
kiev
have
clashed
frequently
over
energy
leading
to
growing
concern
about
renewing
the
transit
agreement
the
clock
is
ticking
and
if
we
look
at
the
calendar
we
see
the
end
of
is
just
round
the
corner
sefcovic
told
a
news
conference
after
the
meeting
also
attended
by
the
heads
of
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
and
ukraine
s
naftogaz
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
who
had
invited
the
parties
to
berlin
said
he
was
optimistic
that
the
two
sides
would
eventually
agree
on
a
way
of
continuing
gas
transit
ukraine
a
sovereign
state
that
was
once
ruled
from
moscow
as
part
of
the
soviet
union
believes
its
role
in
transmitting
russian
gas
gives
it
leverage
to
help
guarantee
its
security
in
the
face
of
russia
s
annexation
of
the
crimean
peninsula
and
backing
for
separatists
in
the
east
but
the
talks
did
not
yield
agreement
on
the
volumes
that
russia
might
transmit
in
future
sefcovic
said
he
wanted
to
see
substantial
volumes
which
would
guarantee
commercially
viable
transit
from
onwards
last
year
the
transit
amounted
to
more
than
bcm
while
gazprom
s
total
exports
to
europe
and
turkey
reached
an
high
of
bcm
gazprom
plans
to
raise
gas
exports
to
europe
to
a
new
record
of
bcm
ukraine
s
transit
role
is
also
imperiled
by
the
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
which
would
directly
link
russia
with
germany
via
the
baltic
sea
bypassing
ukraine
but
altmaier
said
rising
gas
demand
meant
ukrainian
transit
would
be
needed
regardless
speaking
at
a
separate
berlin
news
conference
after
the
meeting
novak
was
bullish
on
growing
european
demand
we
see
that
consumption
in
europe
is
growing
it
was
around
percent
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
he
said
in
the
next
years
the
supply
volumes
to
the
european
consumers
will
be
higher
than
in
and
we
can
talk
about
additional
growth
of
russian
gas
giant
gazprom
and
ukraine
s
oil
and
gas
firm
naftogaz
have
been
involved
in
a
lengthy
legal
battle
over
transit
and
supply
deals
a
stockholm
court
found
in
naftogaz
s
favour
in
the
final
stage
in
february
gazprom
is
challenging
the
ruling
in
the
same
court
while
novak
said
on
tuesday
the
possibility
of
an
amicable
solution
has
been
touched
upon
which
irked
ukraine
the
russian
attempt
to
agree
on
an
settlement
of
the
cases
on
which
the
stockholm
tribunal
had
already
made
a
ruling
shall
not
pass
