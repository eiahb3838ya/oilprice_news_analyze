vast
quantities
of
raw
satellite
imagery
and
data
will
be
distilled
into
an
online
platform
showing
how
water
ecosystems
have
changed
and
how
countries
can
manage
them
to
prevent
further
loss
said
google
and
the
united
nations
focussing
initially
on
fresh
water
ecosystems
such
as
rivers
and
forests
google
will
produce
geospatial
maps
and
data
for
a
publicly
available
platform
to
be
launched
in
october
in
partnership
with
the
environment
program
unep
it
s
basically
a
time
slide
you
can
go
back
in
time
and
what
is
does
is
show
you
where
water
has
disappeared
said
elisabeth
mullin
bernhardt
a
programme
manager
at
unep
on
monday
it
can
show
you
where
water
never
was
and
now
is
there
it
can
show
you
where
water
is
for
africa
s
lake
chad
for
example
access
to
comprehensive
data
and
images
showing
surrounding
land
and
rivers
could
help
explain
why
the
lake
on
which
so
many
depend
is
drying
up
so
quickly
said
bernhardt
given
that
most
countries
share
water
sources
the
information
could
also
be
used
to
encourage
neighbouring
nations
to
work
together
on
strategies
to
manage
rivers
or
lakes
she
said
google
is
using
artificial
intelligence
and
cloud
computing
to
process
a
massive
amount
of
satellite
imagery
and
data
stretching
back
over
three
decades
before
it
can
be
analysed
said
rebecca
moore
director
of
google
earth
and
earth
engine
much
of
the
world
does
not
have
access
to
good
data
about
the
state
of
their
forests
their
rivers
and
lakes
and
coastal
and
how
they
ve
been
changing
over
time
moore
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
by
telephone
it
s
a
critically
important
time
because
there
are
dramatic
changes
going
on
due
to
climate
change
and
urbanisation
and
a
number
of
factors
that
are
in
some
cases
significantly
depleting
fresh
water
improved
information
could
lead
to
better
investment
in
environmental
services
as
countries
try
to
meet
their
sustainable
development
goals
said
unep
agreed
at
the
in
the
global
goals
include
targets
to
end
poverty
and
hunger
combat
climate
change
and
provide
universal
access
to
water
and
sanitation
by
governments
are
currently
reviewing
progress
on
the
goals
at
headquarters
in
new
york
where
unep
and
google
announced
the
satellite
initiative
while
researchers
will
focus
on
water
ecosystems
the
platform
could
be
expanded
to
include
issues
such
as
desertification
or
plastics
in
the
world
s
oceans
