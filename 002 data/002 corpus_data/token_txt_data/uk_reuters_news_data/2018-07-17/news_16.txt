talks
to
lay
ground

new

deal
ukraine
sees
gas
transit
as
guarantor
of
its
independence
very
little

german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
said
he
was
optimistic
that
russian
gas
would
continue
to
reach
europe
via
ukraine
in
future
after
he
hosted
talks
between
top
officials
from
the
two
countries
aimed
at
laying
the
ground
for
a
new
transit
contract
with
russia
embroiled
in
conflict
over
breakaway
regions
in
ukraine
s
east
and
the
european
union
reliant
on
russian
gas
to
fuel
its
industries
the
future
of
gas
transit
seen
by
kiev
as
a
crucial
guarantor
of
its
independence
from
moscow
is
the
object
of
intricate
diplomacy
we
expect
there
to
be
difficult
discussions
but
it
is
possible
to
find
solutions
that
the
security
interests
of
ukraine
can
be
justified
long
after
and
substantial
gas
transit
via
ukraine
to
europe
will
continue
altmaier
said
he
and
european
union
energy
commissioner
maros
sefcovic
hosted
the
meeting
between
russian
energy
minister
aleksandr
novak
and
ukrainian
foreign
minister
pavel
klimkin
that
was
intended
to
lead
to
further
meetings
but
highlighting
the
gulf
dividing
the
parties
very
little
emerged
from
the
first
round
of
meetings
on
tuesday
afternoon
with
altmaier
and
sefcovic
only
hoping
that
they
could
obtain
the
two
countries
agreement
to
further
discussions
ukraine
a
sovereign
state
that
was
once
ruled
from
moscow
as
part
of
the
soviet
union
believes
its
role
in
transmitting
russian
gas
gives
it
crucial
leverage
helping
it
guarantee
its
sovereignty
in
the
face
of
russia
s
annexation
of
the
crimean
peninsula
and
backing
for
separatists
in
the
east
but
sefkovic
said
parties
were
far
from
agreeing
on
how
much
gas
russia
would
continue
to
send
via
ukraine
we
will
not
go
into
concrete
figures
today
because
we
want
to
set
the
parameters
of
the
discussions
their
sequencing
and
the
frequency
of
these
meetings
he
said
adding
that
he
wanted
to
see
substantial
volumes
which
would
guarantee
commercially
viable
transit
from
onwards
he
was
optimistic
that
further
meetings
could
be
scheduled
from
september
ukraine
s
transit
role
is
also
imperiled
by
the
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
which
would
directly
link
russia
with
germany
via
the
baltic
sea
bypassing
ukraine
but
altmaier
said
this
topic
had
not
been
raised
and
that
rising
gas
demand
meant
ukrainian
transit
would
be
needed
regardless
falling
gas
production
in
the
netherlands
and
depleted
reserves
as
well
as
the
need
to
switch
from
coal
to
fuels
meant
that
europe
s
consumption
would
continue
rising
