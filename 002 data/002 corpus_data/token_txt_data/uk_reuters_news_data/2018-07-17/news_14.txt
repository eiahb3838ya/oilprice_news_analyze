the
dollar
held
gains
on
tuesday
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
following
an
upbeat
economic
assessment
from
the
head
of
the
federal
reserve
while

street
erasing
earlier
losses
in

for
the
senate
banking
committee
fed
chairman
jerome

were
generally
modest
following
powell
s
prepared
remarks
in
which
he
signalled
he
believed
the
economy
was
doing
well
and
that
an
era
of
stable
growth
may
continue

gets
its
policy
