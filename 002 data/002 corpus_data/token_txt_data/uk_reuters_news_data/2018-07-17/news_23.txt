expects
volatile
oil
prices
in
the
on
the
back
of
uncertainty
over
possible
disruptions
to
supply
with
benchmark
brent
crude
in
a
per
barrel
range
oil
prices
have
declined
sharply
the
past
week
as
the
trade
war
intensifies
and
were
hovering
below
per
barrel
on
tuesday
not
far
from
their
lowest
since
production
disruptions
and
large
supply
shifts
driven
by
political
decisions
are
the
drivers
of
this
new
fundamental
volatility
with
demand
remaining
robust
so
far
the
bank
said
in
a
note
dated
monday
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
is
pushing
countries
to
cut
all
imports
of
iranian
oil
from
november
as
it
reimposes
sanctions
over
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
but
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
monday
that
in
certain
cases
there
could
be
waivers
for
countries
that
need
more
time
to
wind
down
imports
of
oil
from
iran
the
uncertainty
on
the
magnitude
and
timing
of
the
supply
shifts
has
muddied
the
outlook
for
oil
fundamentals
goldman
said
adding
that
it
continued
to
expect
high
supply
volatility
with
potential
for
further
disruptions
these
supply
shifts
alongside
the
ongoing
surge
in
saudi
production
create
the
risk
that
the
oil
market
moves
into
surplus
in
the
bank
said
however
prices
are
expected
to
get
some
support
longer
term
as
global
oil
inventories
are
weak
according
to
the
bank
ultimately
global
inventories
are
low
oil
demand
remains
robust
and
we
still
expect
a
deficit
once
secondary
sanctions
are
goldman
said
it
still
expects
brent
to
retest
per
barrel
although
this
may
occur
only
late
this
year
depending
on
oil
policies
rather
than
this
summer
as
it
previously
expected
the
bank
added
that
the
recent
escalation
in
trade
tensions
was
unlikely
to
have
much
impact
on
its
oil
demand
growth
view
but
would
likely
create
downside
risks
to
its
oil
demand
growth
