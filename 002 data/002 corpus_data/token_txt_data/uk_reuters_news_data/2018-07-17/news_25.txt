electricity investments surpass oil, gas for second year running-iea

global
electricity
investments
exceeded
those
in
oil
and
gas
for
the
second
year
running
in
due
to
more
spending
on
grids
but
renewable
energy
investment
fell
after
years
of
growth
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
tuesday
global
energy
investment
totaled
trillion
last
year
down
percent
from
more
than
billion
was
spent
on
the
electricity
sector
while
billion
was
invested
in
oil
and
gas
supply
spending
on
the
power
sector
was
driven
by
grid
investments
as
it
moves
towards
more
electrification
the
iea
s
annual
world
energy
investment
report
said
many
countries
are
having
to
invest
more
in
upgrading
or
building
new
power
networks
to
balance
out
demand
and
supply
swings
due
to
the
rise
of
solar
and
wind
power
and
electric
vehicles
despite
rising
renewable
energy
production
investment
in
energy
efficiency
and
renewables
went
down
by
percent
last
year
after
several
years
of
growth
and
could
decline
further
this
year
the
iea
said
china
has
decided
to
cut
subsidies
for
new
solar
plants
and
restrict
the
number
of
new
projects
which
raises
the
risk
of
a
slowdown
in
investment
this
year
such
a
decline
in
global
investment
for
renewables
and
energy
efficiency
combined
is
worrying
said
fatih
birol
the
iea
s
executive
director
this
could
threaten
the
expansion
of
clean
energy
needed
to
meet
energy
security
climate
and
clean
air
goals
while
we
would
need
this
investment
to
go
up
rapidly
it
is
disappointing
to
find
that
it
might
be
falling
this
year
he
added
at
the
same
time
investment
in
fossil
fuels
increased
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
as
the
spending
power
of
the
oil
and
gas
industry
increased
the
share
of
national
oil
companies
in
total
oil
and
gas
upstream
investment
remained
near
record
highs
a
trend
expected
to
continue
this
year
the
iea
said
the
united
states
shale
industry
is
also
at
a
turning
point
after
a
long
period
of
operating
in
a
weak
financial
environment
the
industry
appears
on
track
to
achieve
positive
free
cash
flow
for
the
first
time
ever
this
year
turning
into
a
more
mature
and
financially
solid
industry
while
production
is
growing
at
its
fastest
pace
ever
birol
said
the
report
also
said
that
investment
in
the
nuclear
sector
sank
to
its
lowest
level
in
five
years
last
year
as
more
plants
were
retired
than
newly
built
final
investment
decisions
for
new
plants
declined
for
a
second
year
running
but
the
global
coal
fleet
continued
to
expand
in
mostly
due
to
markets

asia
