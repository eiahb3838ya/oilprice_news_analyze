qatar
airways
chief
executive
said
the
airline
was
adapting
to
a
regional
political
dispute
that
has
prevented
it
flying
some
routes
and
that
those
restrictions
would
not
necessarily
push
it
into
the
red
for
the
current
financial
year
there
is
a
possibility
that
we
will
post
also
a
loss
in
our
current
financial
year
but
it
s
only
a
possibility
akbar
told
reporters
at
the
farnborough
airshow
on
monday
the
airline
lost
access
to
cities
in
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
uae
egypt
and
bahrain
in
when
those
four
countries
cut
ties
with
qatar
after
accusing
it
of
supporting
terrorism
qatar
denies
the
allegation
the
restrictions
mean
the
company
is
set
to
post
what
has
said
will
be
a
very
large
loss
for
the
financial
year
ended
march
but
it
has
not
been
published
yet
said
this
would
be
made
public
in
the
coming
weeks
but
for
the
current
year
he
said
the
airline
might
be
able
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
the
boycott
which
includes
a
ban
on
using
airspace
over
the
four
countries
meaning
some
of
its
flights
have
to
take
much
longer
routes
qatar
airways
is
starting
up
to
new
routes
to
offset
the
impact
of
the
dispute
and
said
it
could
also
make
investments
to
help
boost
its
results
we
will
try
to
do
investments
which
will
give
us
returns
to
mitigate
the
negative
impact
on
the
bottom
line
of
our
company
said
without
giving
details
qatar
airways
is
already
an
investor
in
british
iag
for
example
owning
about
a
percent
stake
and
last
year
bought
a
stake
in
italian
carrier
meridiana
the
ceo
said
he
did
not
see
the
situation
with
the
regional
political
dispute
improving
any
time
soon
despite
that
said
his
airline
was
sticking
to
its
orders
for
new
plane
deliveries
and
was
confident
that
boeing
would
deliver
its
new
jet
for
which
qatar
has
made
a
big
order
on
schedule
despite
reported
delays
i
think
they
will
be
on
time
he
said
qatar
airways
was
only
moderately
hedged
on
fuel
and
might
need
to
hedge
more
in
future
as
the
price
of
oil
rises
said
i
am
concerned
about
the
oil
prices
for
the
time
being
qatar
airways
is
moderately
hedged
well
if
it
comes
i
may
have
to
hedge
he
told
reuters
referring
to
a
potential
rise
in
oil
prices
