chinese

crude

been
rising

some

was
due
from
this

the

inflation

therefore
the

in
tokyo
crude
prices
slumped
more
than
percent
on
monday
with
brent
futures
reaching
a
low
of
a
barrel
as
libyan
ports
reopened
and
traders
eyed
potential
supply
increases
by
russia
and
other
producers
concerns
over
china
s
economic
growth
also
weighed
on
oil
prices
the
country
s
economy
expanded
at
a
slower
pace
as
beijing
s
efforts
to
contain
debt
hurt
activity
while
june
factory
output
growth
weakened
to
a
low
but
brent
has
gained
about
percent
in
during
which
it
poked
above
a
barrel
in
may
to
a
high
as
supply
has
been
kept
in
check
while
a
relatively
strong
global
economy
has
supported
demand
the
stock
markets
have
been
quite
steady
recently
and
this
shows
that
investors
are
starting
to
look
beyond
the
midterm
elections
which
by
then
president
donald
trump
s
posturing
is
expected
to
have
peaked
out
said
monji
of

powell
will
testify
on
the

before
the
senate
banking
committee
on
tuesday
followed
by
an
appearance
on
wednesday
at
the
house
of
representatives
financial
services
committee
he
is
likely
to
reiterate
the
fed
s
stance
towards
gradual
monetary
policy
tightening
and
market
focus
will
be
on
his
views
on
recent
trade
tensions
in
short
we
expect
the
chairman
to
signal
optimism
on
growth
and
inflation
consistent
with
continued
gradual
tightening

he
will
undoubtedly
acknowledge
some
downside

associated
with
the
