grinding
poverty
and
climate
change
are
pushing
communities
in
west
africa
s
sahel
region
into
the
arms
of
extremist
groups
like
boko
haram
but
providing
people
with
clean
energy
could
help
slow
that
trend
said
a
top
international
official
rachel
kyte
ceo
of
sustainable
energy
for
all
set
up
by
the
united
nations
learned
on
a
trip
to
niger
this
month
how
women
and
girls
are
being
recruited
by
islamist
militants
who
offer
them
work
food
and
other
essentials
kyte
who
serves
as
the
s
special
representative
on
energy
access
said
boko
haram
is
moving
into
the
provision
of
basic
social
services
at
the
same
time
in
impoverished
niger
recurring
and
more
intense
drought
is
absolutely
punishing
she
said
the
islamist
group
is
based
in
northeast
nigeria
but
active
in
other
west
african
states
kyte
said
villagers
needed
better
ways
to
grow
crops
to
feed
their
families
and
boost
incomes
to
make
them
less
susceptible
to
the
extremists
targeting
them
deputy
amina
mohammed
who
visited
niger
with
kyte
last
week
spelled
out
the
links
between
climate
change
stresses
and
regional
insecurity
in
remarks
to
the
security
council
in
rural
niger
where
only
about
percent
of
people
have
access
to
electric
power
supplying
cheap
and
green
energy
mainly
from
the
sun
could
make
a
difference
kyte
said
for
example
solar
pumps
could
drive
simple
efficient
irrigation
systems
and
installing
local
grids
could
power
cold
storage
enabling
villagers
to
process
their
crops
and
earn
more
money
she
noted
it
just
became
very
very
clear
that
without
energy
there
s
no
way
to
improve
incomes
without
energy
it
s
going
to
be
difficult
to
bring
productivity
into
the
rural
economy
kyte
said
in
an
interview
from
new
york
after
the
visit
organised
by
the
united
nations
and
the
african
union
in
addition
equipping
hospitals
and
clinics
with
solar
systems
in
both
cities
and
rural
areas
could
reduce
patient
infections
and
increase
the
number
of
operations
for
common
problems
like
fistula
by
supplying
reliable
power
kyte
said
solar
energy
could
be
a
way
to
beat
back
and
build
the
resilience
of
a
community
to
climate
change
but
also
beat
back
violent
extremism
while
lifting
up
women
and
girls
whose
situation
there
is
just
dire
she
added
kyte
urged
government
donors
and
international
development
banks
to
think
about
how
access
to
clean
modern
energy
enables
people
to
get
sufficient
food
and
medical
treatment
and
earn
a
decent
living
in
a
place
like
niger
having
electricity
can
be
a
decisive
factor
in
whether
people
leave
their
homes
and
head
north
to
europe
seeking
a
better
life
she
added
it
can
also
reduce
the
financial
need
for
poor
families
to
marry
their
daughters
off
early
this
is
about
using
aid
money
and
development
finance
to
start
building
a
different
value
proposition
for
these
people
that
is
something
that
will
allow
them
to
stay
where
they
come
from
and
would
allow
girls
to
be
part
of
that
economic
future
