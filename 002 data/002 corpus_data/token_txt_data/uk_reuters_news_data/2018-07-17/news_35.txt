in parched afghanistan, drought sharpens water dispute with iran
kabul

rafiqullah
dawoodzai
says
his
fields
were
too
dry
to
sow
crops
this
year
the
first
time
he
has
skipped
a
growing
season
in
more
than
years
the
acres
he
farms
lie
along
the
banks
of
afghanistan
s
helmand
river
but
the
country
lacks
the
infrastructure
to
use
its
waters
for
irrigation
severe
drought
across
much
of
afghanistan
is
spurring
plans
to
build
new
dams
to
help
farmers
such
as
dawoodzai
it
is
also
aggravating
tensions
with
iran
over
supplies
from
the
helmand
a
dispute
that
has
fed
accusations
that
tehran
is
helping
the
taliban
insurgency
we
can
see
the
helmand
river
water
we
can
even
go
touch
it
but
we
can
t
bring
it
s
water
to
our
farmlands
said
dawoodzai
who
grows
wheat
and
lentils
in
the
southern
province
of
helmand
it
is
frustrating
for
every
farmer
to
see
large
amounts
of
helmand
river
water
flowing
into
afghan
officials
say
their
country
which
has
one
of
the
lowest
levels
of
water
storage
capacity
in
the
world
needs
the
extra
dams
to
feed
its
agriculture
sector
the
mainstay
of
the
billion
economy
which
has
been
brutally
hit
by
drought
with
drought
prevailing
across
the
region
and
protests
against
water
shortages
rocking
iran
afghanistan
s
announcement
in
april
that
it
would
press
ahead
with
plans
for
new
dams
and
reservoirs
prompted
objections
from
the
tehran
government
which
fears
its
supplies
will
be
cut
the
row
underscores
the
growing
strategic
importance
of
water
across
the
world
water
disputes
have
become
common
in
south
and
central
asia
and
elsewhere
earlier
this
year
the
taliban
threatened
to
overrun
afghanistan
s
western
province
of
farah
on
the
border
with
iran
drawing
angry
warnings
from
local
politicians
that
tehran
was
using
the
insurgents
to
fight
a
proxy
war
over
water
iran
is
supporting
the
taliban
to
disrupt
developmental
projects
in
afghanistan
including
water
dams
said
gul
nabi
ahmadzai
the
former
afghan
border
police
chief
they
benefit
from
keeping
afghanistan
unstable
and
want
to
control
our
resources
he
said
iranian
diplomats
in
kabul
declined
to
comment
tehran
has
repeatedly
denied
helping
the
taliban
the
dialogue
between
the
two
governments
for
resolving
water
issues
is
being
pursued
through
diplomatic
channels
and
linking
this
issue
with
afghanistan
s
internal
issues
has
no
logical
accurate
or
rational
basis
iranian
foreign
ministry
spokesman
bahram
qassemi
said
in
may
after
the
farah
attacks
according
to
a
report
from
the
iranian
students
news
agency
afghanistan
a
country
where
nearly
million
people
rely
on
farming
has
seen
a
per
cent
fall
in
agricultural
output
this
year
as
the
drought
has
bitten
officials
at
the
ministry
of
agriculture
said
we
have
to
protect
the
national
interest
said
fahimullah
ziaee
who
until
june
served
as
the
country
s
junior
minister
for
irrigation
and
natural
resources
and
who
participated
in
talks
with
iran
earlier
this
year
we
can
not
be
dictated
to
by
any
country
on
how
to
protect
our
natural
tehran
had
already
voiced
concern
that
the
huge
salma
dam
in
western
herat
province
inaugurated
in
would
see
its
water
supplies
reduced
recent
meetings
with
afghan
officials
over
plans
for
additional
dams
have
the
issue
according
to
two
senior
iranian
officials
one
based
in
tehran
and
the
second
in
kabul
plans
to
improve
afghanistan
s
water
storage
capacity
have
been
on
the
drawing
board
for
decades
but
now
the
government
is
actively
seeking
aid
from
international
donors
to
build
two
dams
and
increase
the
height
of
existing
dams
at
the
center
of
the
dispute
is
the
helmand
river
which
runs
through
much
of
afghanistan
from
its
source
in
the
mountains
north
of
kabul
feeding
the
sistan
wetlands
in
the
border
regions
of
the
two
countries
water
from
the
helmand
river
is
in
principle
shared
under
a
treaty
which
assigned
iran
million
cubic
meters
of
water
a
year
but
with
afghanistan
at
war
for
the
past
years
the
supply
has
been
erratic
it
is
not
like
we
are
forcing
afghanistan
to
give
us
water
said
a
senior
official
in
tehran
working
in
the
irrigation
department
they
have
to
honor
the
water
sharing
agreement
and
seek
our
consent
to
prevent
environmental
damage
caused
by
their
donors
such
as
india
which
has
expressed
interest
in
investing
on
two
dams
in
central
afghanistan
must
consult
iran
before
supporting
large
dam
building
projects
which
critics
say
cause
severe
environmental
damage
both
down
and
upstream
the
official
said
a
senior
indian
diplomat
in
kabul
said
it
planned
to
construct
dams
in
afghanistan
but
would
not
intervene
in
a
bilateral
water
dispute
between
tehran
and
kabul
afghanistan
s
government
wants
us
to
help
them
build
dams
we
will
go
ahead
with
the
plans
we
don
t
see
the
need
to
secure
iran
s
permission
for
such
projects
said
the
indian
official
iranian
diplomats
in
afghanistan
declined
to
comment
on
the
water
dispute
afghan
officials
say
a
lack
of
dams
on
their
side
of
the
border
has
made
it
impossible
to
control
the
into
iran
which
they
say
has
received
well
above
its
allotted
share
of
water
irrigation
ministry
officials
in
kabul
said
that
last
year
iran
received
more
than
billion
cubic
meters
at
a
time
when
the
effects
of
drought
which
now
afflicts
of
afghanistan
s
provinces
were
already
starting
to
be
felt
however
reaching
agreement
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
fact
that
the
dehravud
gauging
station
on
the
kajaki
dam
the
point
agreed
in
the
treaty
for
measuring
the
annual
flow
is
currently
under
taliban
control
and
no
official
has
been
able
to
visit
since
we
want
to
resolve
a
dispute
with
iran
but
there
are
some
security
issues
our
country
is
under
tremendous
stress
and
iran
must
understand
