president
donald
trump
said
at
the
weekend
there
was
no
need
to
keep
canada
in
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
and
warned
congress
not
to
meddle
with
the
trade
talks
worries
about
tensions
with
china
were
also
kept
alive
by
a
report
last
week
that
trump
had
told
aides
he
was
ready
to
impose
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
imports
from
china
as
soon
as
a
public
comment
period
on
the
plan
ends
on
thursday
that
would
be
a
major
escalation
given
the
united
states
has
already
applied
tariffs
on

of
exports
from

there
was
also
bad

on

trade
concerns
will
remain
front
and
center
of
investors
minds
along
with
increasing
concerns
about
stability
in
emerging
markets
after
the
sharp
declines
seen
in
argentina
and
turkey

currency
last

said
michael

turbulence
continued
the
indonesian
rupiah
fell
to
the
lowest
levels
against
the
dollar
since
the
country
s
economic
crisis
two
decades
ago
and
the
central
bank
said
it
was
intervening
in
foreign

markets

turkey
s

at

centre
of

turmoil
in

lifted
by
a
statement
from
the
central
bank
which
said
it
would
adjust
its
monetary
stance
at
its
upcoming
meeting
inflation
was
above
expectations
in
august
surging
percent
and
touching
the
highest
since
december
this
morning
s
inflation
number
was
very
high
and
the
authorities
still
haven
t
got
a
credible
strategy
to
deal
with
that
said
chris
scicluna
head
of
economic
research
at
daiwa
capital

turkish
finance
minister
berat
albayrak
told
reuters
that
the
central
bank
was
independent
of
government
and
it
would
take
all
necessary
steps
to
combat
inflation
among
major
currencies
the
british
pound
stood
out
as
the
big
underperformer
hurt
by
comments
by
the
european
union
s
chief
brexit
negotiator
michel
barnier
that
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
british
proposals
on
future
trade

also
weighed
on
sterling
which
fell
