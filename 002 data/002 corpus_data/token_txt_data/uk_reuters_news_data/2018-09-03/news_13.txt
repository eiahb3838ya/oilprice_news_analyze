though

to
a
market
holiday
on

it
looks
almost
certain
that
president
donald
trump
will
impose
percent
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
from
china

trump
said
last
week
he
was
ready
to
implement
the
new
tariffs
as
soon
as
a
public
comment
period
on
the
plan
ends
on
thursday
which
would
be
a
major
escalation
given
the
united
states
has
already
applied
tariffs
on
on
of
exports
from
china
shanghai

which
fell

last
month
on
worries
about
the
trade
war

percent
to
edging
back
at
the
low
of
set
two
weeks
ago
the
markets
tend
to
think
ahead
after
the
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
exports
they
will
worry
what
can
come
next
unless
the
trade
war
anxiety
is
dispelled
you
can
not
rule
out
the
possibility
of
shares
falling
further

shenshen
wan
strategist
at
tokai
tokyo
research
on
the
other
hand
stocks
especially
technology
shares
have
fared
better
thanks
in
part
to
the
strength
of
current
economic
data
and
corporate
profits
the
nasdaq
index
gained
percent
last
month
with
apple
gaining
almost
percent
the
biggest
percentage
gains
since
april
major
economic
data
due
this
week
such
as
a
manufacturing
survey
on
tuesday
and
an
employment
report
on
friday
is
also
expected
to
show
solid
conditions
possibly
underpinning
wall
street
shares
shares
and
only
a
handful
of
countries
are
likely
to
continue
to
attract
global
funds

trade
war
worries
have
lifted
the
swiss
franc
which
hit
a
high
of
franc
to
the
dollar
and
high
of
per

on
friday
it
last
stood
at
and
in
contrast
the
australian

sometimes
used
as
a
proxy
for
bets
on
china
hit
a
low
of
among
the
currencies
the
euro
which
is
generally
positively
correlated
to
risk
sentiment
tends
to
ease
on
trade
worries
while
the
yen
tends
to
gain
but
the
two
currencies
reactions
have
been
more
qualified
both
currencies
have
been
pinned
in
a
narrow
range
with
the
euro
trading

changed
at
the
yen

hands
at
per

also
flat
investors
remained
wary
of
emerging
market
currencies
after
sharp
in
the
argentine
s
peso
and
the
turkish
lira
last
month
on
worries
over
their
economic
management
big
current
account
deficits
and
inflation
that
spilled
over
to
a
few
other
emerging
countries
that
share
some
of
those
traits
albeit
to
a
less
degree
the
indonesian
rupiah
fell
to
to
the

its
lowest
levels
since
the
