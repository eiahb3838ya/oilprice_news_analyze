column-uranium's rally built on supply cuts, looks overcooked for now: russell

one
of
the
surprise
packets
in
the
commodity
space
this
year
has
been
uranium
with
the
spot
price
surging
percent
in
the
past
four
months
a
stellar
performance
that
may
not
be
justified
by
current
fundamentals
uranium
stood
at
per
pound
on
up
from
the
low
so
far
this
year
of
hit
in
the
gain
is
percent
and
the
metal
used
to
power
nuclear
reactors
is
on
track
to
record
a
second
annual
increase
this
looks
like
a
strong
performance
on
the
surface
but
uranium
isn
t
quite
like
other
commodity
markets
and
it
s
worth
delving
down
to
try
and
fathom
the
underlying
dynamics
the
most
obvious
factor
driving
the
spot
price
has
been
supply
cutbacks
by
major
producers
namely
canada
s
cameco
and
kazakhstan
s
producer
kazatomprom
cameco
said
in
july
it
would
extend
indefinitely
a
shutdown
of
its
mcarthur
river
and
key
lake
mines
in
saskatchewan
province
having
initially
announced
a
suspension
of
operations
in
november
last
year
kazatomprom
also
said
at
the
end
of
last
year
that
it
would
reduce
its
output
by
percent
for
three
years
starting
from
the
beginning
of
as
it
battled
a
market
that
has
been
oversupplied
since
the
nuclear
shutdowns
in
the
wake
of
the
fukushima
disaster
in
japan
the
cameco
and
kazatomprom
cutbacks
took
about
percent
of
annual
uranium
ore
supply
from
the
market
but
the
price
action
in
the
wake
of
the
cutbacks
is
instructive
the
spot
price
took
off
after
cameco
s
november
announcement
jumping
from
per
pound
to
a
high
of
by
a
date
that
coincided
with
the
news
of
the
kazatomprom
production
curbs
once
the
initial
surge
was
over
however
spot
uranium
drifted
back
down
to
the
april
low
of
per
pound
the
same
level
it
was
before
the
output
cuts
were
announced
it
did
recover
somewhat
thereafter
and
got
another
shot
in
the
arm
with
cameco
extending
the
idling
of
its
major
mines
indefinitely
in
july
but
it
does
appear
the
uranium
price
has
been
driven
by
the
news
flow
and
may
struggle
to
sustain
a
rally
it
s
also
the
case
that
rallies
built
on
supply
cuts
are
rarely
as
enduring
as
those
prompted
by
increases
in
demand
if
the
price
of
spot
uranium
does
rise
to
around
a
pound
as
some
analysts
forecast
it
s
likely
that
cameco
and
kazatomprom
will
simply
increase
output
from
their
idled
mines
but
is
there
a
positive
demand
case
to
be
made
for
uranium
the
news
headlines
in
recent
years
have
tended
to
focus
on
the
negatives
such
as
the
closure
of
japan
s
and
germany
s
reactors
after
fukushima
and
the
cost
blowouts
and
delays
on
several
new
power
plants
almost
quietly
though
substantial
nuclear
capacity
is
being
added
in
china
and
elsewhere
in
asia
data
from
the
world
nuclear
association
shows
that
reactors
with
a
capacity
of
gigawatts
gw
are
now
under
construction
which
compares
favourably
to
operating
reactors
that
produce
around
gw
annually
of
the
plants
being
built
china
is
leading
with
gw
under
construction
followed
by
the
united
arab
emirates
south
korea
india
and
russia
it
is
worth
noting
that
apart
from
south
korea
the
countries
expanding
their
capacity
have
far
less
organised
public
opposition
to
the
use
of
nuclear
energy
than
countries
where
activists
are
pushing
for
an
end
to
the
use
of
the
radioactive
form
of
power
generation
china
is
pushing
nuclear
power
as
part
of
its
efforts
to
lessen
reliance
on
polluting
generation
notwithstanding
the
issues
surrounding
the
safe
storage
of
spent
fuel
rods
the
data
does
point
to
solid
growth
in
demand
for
uranium
for
new
power
plants
but
this
increase
will
be
gradual
and
probably
can
be
met
from
existing
mining
operations
this
means
that
uranium
producers
some
of
whom
have
enjoyed
strong
rallies
in
tandem
with
the
spot
price
may
be
reaching
overvalued
territory
shares
in
paladin
energy
the
australian
producer
operating
mines
in
africa
have
gained
percent
since
a
recent
low
on
may
and
explorer
boss
resources
has
watched
its
stock
prices
jump
percent
since
march
these
gains
look
overcooked
and
paladin
and
boss
aren
t
the
only
players
in
the
uranium
space
that
have
enjoyed
rallies
that
appear
somewhat
disconnected
to
fundamentals
even
cameco
which
in
effect
has
become
a
much
smaller
uranium
producer
has
seen
its
share
price
improve
with
a
gain
of
percent
between
november
last
year
and
a
recent
closing
peak
of
c
in
june
but
cameco
has
failed
to
maintain
those
gains
and
its
share
price
has
eased
back
to
c
on
this
perhaps
just
goes
to
show
that
sustained
rallies
can
not
be
built
by
removing
supply
from
an
oversupplied
market
