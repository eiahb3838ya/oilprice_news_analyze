russia
s
oil
industry
is
awash
with
cash
and
will
be
able
to
withstand
the
planned
trillion
roubles
billion
in
extra
taxes
over
the
next
six
years
alexei
sazanov
the
head
of
the
tax
department
in
the
finance
ministry
said
in
an
interview
the
government
is
looking
for
extra
money
to
implement
president
vladimir
putin
s
pledges
of
higher
social
spending
and
better
infrastructure
over
the
next
six
years
expected
to
cost
around
trillion
roubles
the
new
oil
tax
changes
will
see
an
increase
in
the
mineral
extraction
tax
and
a
gradual
reduction
in
oil
and
oil
products
export
duty
the
changes
will
be
introduced
step
by
step
over
the
next
six
years
starting
from
the
oil
industry
expects
trillion
roubles
worth
of
free
cash
flow
this
year
this
is
the
money
which
they
may
send
either
for
dividends
share
buybacks
or
to
redeem
loans
those
are
huge
figures
sazanov
said
so
we
have
found
resources
to
additionally
finance
budget
spending
worth
trillion
roubles
over
six
years
from
oil
taxes
russia
s
top
oil
producers
rosneft
and
lukoil
both
recently
announced
share
buyback
plans
sazanov
said
the
oil
tax
reform
was
unlikely
to
affect
domestic
oil
production
which
is
close
to
a
high
of
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
as
a
protective
measure
against
western
sanctions
over
moscow
s
role
in
ukraine
s
conflict
and
alleged
hacking
in
the
united
states
and
part
of
the
tax
overhaul
oil
refineries
will
be
able
to
get
compensation
in
the
form
of
a
negative
excise
tax
sazanov
said
the
negative
excise
tax
would
amount
to
around
roubles
per
tonne
of
oil
on
average
under
a
scenario
where
the
oil
price
was
per
barrel
and
the
rouble
at
per
he
said
the
level
of
negative
excise
tax
as
well
as
some
other
components
of
the
tax
reform
were
still
subject
to
discussions
and
tweaks
the
government
in
may
decided
to
curb
excise
tax
on
fuel
to
rein
in
fast
rising
retail
gasoline
prices
which
led
to
protests
among
drivers
across
the
country
sazanov
said
excise
tax
on
fuel
would
rise
in
as
initially
planned
roubles
