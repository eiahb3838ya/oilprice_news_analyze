brent
crude

dipped
on

amid
rising
supply
from
opec
and
the

although
expectations
of
falling
iranian

once

bite
from

provided

between

to
a
of

a
reuters
survey
found
output
was
boosted
by
a
recovery
in
libyan
production
and
as
iraq
s

hit
a

meanwhile

energy

firm

hughes
reported
on
friday
increasing
the
rig
count
by
units
to
the
high
rig
count
has
helped
lift
crude
oil
production
by
more
than
percent
since
to
million
bpd
despite
the
dip
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
said
brent
was
supported
by
the
notion
that
sanctions
on
iranian
crude
oil
exports
will
eventually
lead
to
constricted
markets
which
he
said
would
likely
push
up
prices
iranian
production
is
already
showing
signs
of
decline
falling
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
last
month
as
importers
of
iranian
barrels
will
already
be
moving
away
from
taking
shipments
said
edward
bell
commodity
analyst
at
emirates
nbd
bank
in
dubai
many
analysts
have
warned
that
an
economic
slowdown
because
of
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
economies
including
china
and
the
european
union
would
drag
on
oil
demand
oanda
s
innes
said
it
was
too
early
to
say
whether
this
would
happen
while
the
analysts
continue
fretting
that
billion
in
tariffs
could
drag
down
oil
demand
it
isn
t
at
all
clear
that
such
type
of
economic
headwinds
will
topple
oil
prices
given
the
constant
barrage
of
supply
outages
