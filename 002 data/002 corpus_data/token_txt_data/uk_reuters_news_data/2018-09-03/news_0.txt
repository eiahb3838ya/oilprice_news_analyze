donating
white

to
democratic
republic

to
a
population
driven
to
extinction
by
poachers
a
decade
ago
zimbabwe
s

said
the
rhinos
were
being
captured
and
would
be

parks
and
wildlife
management
authority
zimparks
spokesman
tinashe
farawo
said
on
monday
congo
s
white
rhinos
lived
in
garamba
national
park
near
the
border
with
south
sudan
but
it
was
not
clear
where
the
animals
would
be
located
wildlife
protection
is
complicated
in
congo
by
lawlessness
and
militia
violence
that
endures
years
after
the
end
of
a
war
that
killed
millions
mainly
from
hunger
and
disease
the
zimbabwean
government
was
satisfied
that
the
pre
and
conditions
in
congo
met
the
requisite
standards
for
a
successful
of
rhinos
a
zimparks
statement
said
zimparks
and
conservationists
said
moving
the
rhinos
from
zimbabwe
would
strengthen
the
gene
pool
zimbabwe
had
about
black
and
white
rhinos
in
and
is
one
of
just
four
countries
with
nearly
all
the
world
s
white
rhinos
their
horns
are
prized
in
china
and
southeast
asia
moving
rhinos
from
one
place
to
another
is
essential
to
ensure
good
genetic
diversity
across
the
population
said
emma
pereira
a
spokeswoman
for
save
the
rhino
a
group
we
hope
any
move
between
countries
is
done
with
the
correct
expertise
and
thoughtful
poachers
also
target
mountain
gorillas
one
of
the
world
s
most
endangered
species
which
is
found
only
on
a
spine
of
volcanic
mountains
straddling
congo
uganda
and
rwanda
their
numbers
have
recovered
in
recent
years
thanks
to
intensive
conservation
efforts
