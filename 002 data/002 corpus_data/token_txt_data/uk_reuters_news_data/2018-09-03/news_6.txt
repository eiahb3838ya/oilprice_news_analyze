russia
wants
to
curtail
oil
product
flows
to
belarus
and
is
seeking
a
more
transparent
oil
deal
with
the
neighbouring
country
alexei
sazanov
head
of
the
tax
department
in
the
russian
finance
ministry
said
in
an
interview
russia
belarus
and
kazakhstan
have
a
arrangement
under
which
moscow
has
been
sending
crude
oil
and
oil
products
to
minsk
with
no
export
fee
belarus
then
some
of
those
goods
pocketing
the
associated
charges
russia
has
long
been
trying
to
renegotiate
the
deal
under
which
it
loses
billions
of
roubles
annually
moscow
s
finances
are
under
pressure
amid
mounting
western
sanctions
and
new
social
spending
orders
from
president
vladimir
putin
by
supplying
oil
products
to
belarus
the
russian
budget
loses
out
on
export
duties
sazanov
said
russia
supplies
belarus
each
year
with
around
million
tonnes
of
oil
products
but
wants
to
cut
that
to
tonnes
sazanov
said
he
did
not
say
from
when
russia
has
used
cheap
energy
exports
and
loans
to
belarus
as
a
way
of
keeping
its
former
soviet
neighbour
in
moscow
s
geopolitical
orbit
but
the
arrangement
has
become
harder
to
sustain
as
russia
s
budget
tightens
russia
is
now
seeking
effectively
to
curtail
of
its
refined
products
by
limiting
the
volumes
that
can
flow
to
belarus
it
has
also
introduced
a
new
tax
policy
that
will
see
oil
export
duty
abolished
within
the
next
six
years
meaning
there
will
be
no
window
for
companies
to
save
on
taxes
depending
on
shipment
destination
it
is
profitable
for
belarus
to
buy
russian
oil
products
and
it
is
exporting
products
and
transferring
the
duties
to
its
own
budget
sazanov
said
calling
the
scheme
a
covert
subsidising
of
the
belarus
economy
it
is
good
that
relations
are
becoming
more
transparent
he
said
belarus
expects
to
lose
around
million
from
russia
s
new
tax
policy
in
alone
sazanov
said
it
is
moscow
s
sovereign
right
to
change
its
tax
policy
despite
being
part
of
the
customs
union
