asked
for

on
a
special
land
deal
agreed
in
their
peace
treaty
that
the
jordanian
government
wants
to
end
under
the
peace
treaty
two
border
areas
were
recognised
to
be
under
jordanian
sovereignty
but
gave
israel
special
provisions
to
use
the
land
and
allow
israelis
free
access
jordan
formally
notified
israel
two
weeks
ago
it
would
not
renew
the
deal
over
baquora
where
the
yarmouk
river
flows
into
the
jordan
river
and
in
the

araba
desert
where

farmers
have
large
plantations
foreign

ayman
safadi
told
reuters
after
the
decision
the
kingdom
was
waiting
for
israel
to
invoke
a
provision
in
the
peace
treaty
to
hold
consultations
after
giving
notice
before
the
deadline
petra
state
news
agency
quoted
government

when
the
discussions
would
begin
israeli
prime

benjamin
netanyahu
acknowledged
jordan
s
move
and
said
his
country
sought
to
enter
negotiations
on
the
possibility
of
extending
the
arrangement
the
special
regime
would
be
automatically
renewed
unless
either
of
the
parties
notified
the
other
a
year
before
expiry
that
it
wished
to
terminate
the
agreement
safadi
said
the
deal
which
was
signed
in
november
had
been
conceived
as
a
temporary
arrangement
from
the
start
the
kingdom
had
contemplated
the
move
for
a
while
before
the
deadline
king
abdullah
who
stressed
the
territories
were
jordanian
lands
and
would
remain
so
said
the
move
was
made
in
the
national
interest
at
a
period
of
regional
turmoil
jordan
is
one
of
only
two
arab
states
that
has
a
peace
treaty
with
israel
and
the
two
countries
have
a
long
history
of
close
security
ties
but
the
treaty
is
unpopular
in
jordan
where
sentiment
is
widespread
