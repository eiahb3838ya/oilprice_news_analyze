oil rally faces tidal wave of supply
reuters
the
oil
market
s
bull
run
is
running
into
one
of
its
biggest
tests
in
months
facing
a
tidal
wave
of
supply
and
growing
worries
about
economic
weakness
sapping
demand
worldwide
after
topping
out
at
more
than
and
a
barrel
just
a
month
ago
both
crude
and
brent
benchmark
futures
have
grappled
with
selling
for
a
time
prices
had
some
support
on
hopes
that
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
would
force
barrels
off
the
market
that
changed
in
the
last
week
the
world
s
three
largest
producers
russia
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
all
indicated
they
were
pumping
at
record
or
levels
while
the
united
states
said
it
would
allow
waivers
that
could
allow
buyers
to
keep
importing
iranian
oil
lessening
the
threat
of
a
supply
crunch
those
factors
along
with
a
spate
of
recent
weak
economic
reports
out
of
china
and
other
emerging
markets
have
shifted
the
conversation
back
towards
worries
about
oversupply
and
pushed
futures
to
lows
not
seen
since
april
interrupting
an
upward
move
that
had
consistently
found
support
during
the
rally
s
modest
pullbacks
the
structure
of
the
crude
futures
curve
had
for
several
months
indicated
expectations
for
tighter
supply
but
contracts
now
suggest
investors
think
markets
could
be
awash
in
oil
over
the
coming
months
the
magnitude
of
recent
selling
is
strongly
suggesting
that
global
oil
demand
is
weaker
than
expected
as
a
result
of
tariff
issues
especially
between
the
and
china
said
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch
associates
there
has
been
an
exodus
among
speculators
as
well
in
the
last
two
weeks
net
bullish
bets
on
oil
have
declined
to
the
lowest
level
in
over
a
year
selling
notably
accelerated
on
thursday
after
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
fell
below
a
barrel
a
level
that
had
stood
firm
in
previous
selloffs
during
the
summer
and
fall
the
oil
market
ran
higher
in
anticipation
of
this
week
s
formal
of
sanctions
against
iran
by
the
united
states
and
on
concerns
that
supply
from
producers
like
saudi
arabia
would
not
be
able
to
make
up
the
difference
for

saudi

production

on
however
the
government
said
on
friday
it
will
temporarily
allow
several
countries
including
south
korea
and
turkey
to
keep
importing
iranian
oil
when
sanctions
come
back
into
force
on
monday
sparing
them
for
now
from
the
threat
of
economic
penalties
still
some
analysts
believe
the
current
selloff
has
come
too
far
too
quickly
major
opec
producers
won
t
be
able
to
add
more
supply
should
it
become
necessary
particularly
with
production
in
iran
venezuela
and
libya
still
at
risk
a
loss
of
million
bpd
from
iran
further
declines
in
venezuela
coupled
together
with
geopolitical
disruption
in
libya
and
nigeria
could
easily
wipe
out
what
little
spare
capacity
we
have
left
bernstein
analysts
said
this
week
output
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
led
by
saudi
arabia
rose
to
levels
not
seen
in
two
years
production
hit
a
record
million
barrels
a
day
in
august
and
russia
s
output
rose
to
million
bpd
a
era
peak
for
crude
the
key
area
to
watch
is
between
and
where
prices
had
found
support
in
the
past
said
fawad
razaqzada
analyst
at
futures
brokerage
if
oil
dips
below
this
point
the
path
of
least
resistance
would
be
to
the
downside
he
said
for
brent
razaqzada
is
watching
the
range
between
and
a
barrel
and
if
it
were
to
slip
below
that
we
could
see
a
much
larger
correction
