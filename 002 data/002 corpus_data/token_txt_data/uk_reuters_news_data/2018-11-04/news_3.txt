s
decision
in
may
to
withdraw
from
world
powers
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
the
deal
brought

the
lifting
of
most
international
financial

economic
sanctions
in
return
for
tehran
curbing
its
disputed
nuclear
activity
under

trump
said
the
deal
was
weak
and
favoured
iran
the
other
signatories
britain
france
germany
russia
and
china
remain
committed
to
the
accord

said
there
s
a
handful
of
places
where
countries
already
have
made
significant
reductions
in
their
crude
oil
exports
and
need
a
little
more
time
to
get
to
zero
and
we
re
going
to
provide
that
to
he
did
not
elaborate
pompeo
noted
that
oil
sanctions
would
be
coupled
with
financial
sanctions
involving

it
would
launch
two

its
threats
against
our
country
irna
quoted

as
saying
among

a
reference
to
the
close
ties
between
the
president
and
king
salman
ruler
of
iran
s
regional
rival
saudi
arabia
it
s
black
humour
but
the
audience
can
also
be
brought
to
reflect
on
the
contradictions
in
the
behaviour
of
trump

told
state

in
tehran
the
restoration
of
sanctions
on

is
part
of
an
effort
by
trump
to
force
iran
to
halt
its
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programmes
outright
as
well
as
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
conflicts
across
the
middle
east
in
a
speech
on
saturday
khamenei
said
trump
s
policies

goal
has
been
to
the
domination
it
had
but
it
has
failed
america

been
defeated
