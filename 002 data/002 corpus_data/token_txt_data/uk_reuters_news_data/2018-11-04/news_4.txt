the
ministry
s
director
general
last
year
s
auction
elicited
bids
from
only
two
groups
of
companies
and
the
ministry
said
it
expects
more
to
compete
this
time
as
conditions
have
improved
in
the
energy
market
was
weaker
and
companies
in
general
were
investing
less
there
was
also
concern
over
where
to
sell
any
newfound
gas
since
israel
is
a
small
market
there
is
strong
interest
in
this
tender
certainly
compared
to
the
previous
round
adiri
said
the
blocks
have
been
divvied
up
into
four
sectors
that
benefit
from
more
comprehensive
geological
studies
than
last
time
he
said
israel
has
also
signed
major
export
deals
with
jordan
and
egypt
over
the
past
two
years
opening
new
markets
to
companies
looking
to
sell
gas
from
israel
adiri
further
said
conditions
in
the
global
energy
market
had
improved
with
companies
more
willing
to
make
investments
the
exploration
licenses
will
be
for
three
years
with
options
to
extend
up
to
four
more
years
should
terms
be
met
there
have
been
seven
natural
gas
discoveries
in
israeli
waters
though
not
all
have
been
developed
the
tamar
field
has
been
producing
gas
since
and
the
huge
leviathan
project
as
well
as
two
smaller

are
expected
to
come

the
next
few
