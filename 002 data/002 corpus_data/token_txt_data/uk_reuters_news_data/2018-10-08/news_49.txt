bioenergy leads growth in renewable energy consumption to 2023-iea
london

bioenergy
from
liquid
biofuels
and
biogas
will
lead
growth
in
renewable
energy
consumption
to
due
to
its
rising
use
in
the
heating
and
transport
sectors
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
overall
renewable
energy
will
continue
to
grow
to
accounting
for
percent
of
energy
consumption
growth
as
countries
cut
their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
try
and
keep
global
warming
in
check
while
growth
in
solar
and
wind
power
is
set
to
continue
in
the
electricity
sector
bioenergy
will
remain
the
largest
source
of
renewable
energy
the
iea
said
in
an
annual
report
on
renewables
modern
bioenergy
is
the
overlooked
giant
of
the
renewable
energy
field
said
fatih
birol
the
iea
s
executive
director
its
share
in
the
world
s
total
renewables
consumption
is
about
percent
today
in
other
words
as
much
as
hydro
wind
solar
and
all
other
renewables
combined
he
added
modern
bioenergy
refers
to
liquid
biofuels
produced
from
pulpy
residue
from
sugar
other
plants
biogas
and
other
technologies
traditional
bioenergy
refers
to
the
burning
of
biomass
such
as
wood
animal
waste
and
traditional
charcoal
the
share
of
renewable
technologies
meeting
global
energy
demand
is
expected
to
increase
by
a
fifth
to
percent
in
china
will
lead
global
growth
in
renewable
energy
due
to
policies
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
all
sectors
and
lessen
harmful
air
pollution
and
will
surpass
the
european
union
as
the
largest
consumer
of
renewable
energy
by
the
report
said
of
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumers
brazil
will
have
the
highest
share
of
renewables
by
far
almost
percent
of
total
final
energy
consumption
in
driven
by
a
significant
contribution
of
bioenergy
and
hydropower
globally
solar
photovoltaic
capacity
is
forecast
to
expand
by
almost
gigawatts
gw
to
terrawatt
by
more
than
all
other
renewable
energy
technologies
combined
wind
energy
will
be
the
contributor
to
renewable
capacity
growth
growing
by
percent
but
hydropower
will
remain
the
largest
renewable
electricity
