on

equity
markets
around
the
world
came
under
pressure
last
week
after
a
steep
in
treasuries
prompted
by
hawkish
comments
from
federal
reserve
officials
and
data
widely
seen
as
bolstering
the
case
of
further
rate
hikes
whether
it
is
just
in
response
to
the
weight
of
evidence
from
the
strong
us
data
or
instead
an
active
decision
by
fed
officials
to
steer
the
market
more
towards
its
tightening
profile
the
dots
presented
at
its
rate
decision
last
month
there
is
little
doubt
that
officials
have
turned
more
hawkish
recently
analysts
at
anz
said
in
a
note
the
irony
in
all
this
is
that
with
the
us
yield
curve
steepening
meaningfully
that
is
only
likely
to
embolden
the
fed
that
it
can
continue
to
tighten
further

also
showed
a
rise
in
wages

could
keep
the
federal

on
track

more
