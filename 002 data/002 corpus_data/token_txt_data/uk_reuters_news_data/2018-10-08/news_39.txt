increased

the

said
matching
a
move
in

asian
shares
were
also
hit
on
monday
as
investors
in
chinese
stocks
reacted
for
the
first
time
to
new
pressure
from
washington
and
a
report
that
chinese
spies
had
compromised

china

james
mcglew
executive
director
of
corporate
stockbroking
at
argonaut
in
brisbane
said
chinese
investors
were
catching
up
after
global
markets
turned
lower
during
china
s
national
day
holiday
that
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
you
would
have
had
quite
a
few
long
positions
going
into
that
and
people
just
quit
them
and
were
hitting
the
bid
today
he
said
we
ve
been
expecting
for
some
time
now
the
market
to
start
delivering
volatility
we
find
it
quite
difficult
to
reconcile
the
political
machinations
that
are
going
on
over
there
being
friendly
to
on
thursday
vice
president
mike
pence
highlighted
disputes
with
china
on
issues
such
as
cyber
attacks
taiwan
freedom
of

and
human
rights
marking
a
sharpened
approach
toward
beijing
beyond
the

war
on
friday
chinese
technology
stocks
listed
in
hong
kong
slumped
on
a
bloomberg
report
that
the

of
multiple
companies
had
been
compromised
by
malicious
computer
chips
inserted
by

spies
on

hong

china
s
yuan
was
weaker
at
per

at
gmt
compared
with
a
previous
onshore
close
of
per

earlier
on
monday
the
pboc
set
the
midpoint
of
the
yuan
s
daily
trading
band
at
per
dollar
its
weakest
level
since
may
the
offshore
yuan
was
also
weaker
at
per
dollar
higher
yields
on
treasuries
are
likely
to
put
more
pressure
on
the
yuan
as
china
continues
to
make
use
of
targeted
policy
easing
to
energise
the
domestic
economy
we
expect
the
pboc
will
continue
its
easing
efforts
to
keep
liquidity
ample
and
loosen
its
credit
control
to
make
funds
more
accessible
to
the
broader
economy
bofa

lynch
analysts
said
in
a
note
moreover
there
is
still
room
for
further
rrr
cuts
when
necessary
though
the
chance
for
an
interest
rate
cut
is
limited
given
the
continued
fed
rate
hiking
cycle
in
our
on
monday
the

of

the

came
under
pressure
last
week
after
a

by
hawkish
comments
from
federal
reserve
officials
and
data
widely
seen
as
supporting
further
rate
hikes
friday
s
payrolls
showed
job
creation
slowed
in
september
likely
from
hurricane
florence
s
impact
on
restaurant
and
retail
payrolls
but
the
labor
department
report
also
showed
a
rise
in
wages
that
could
keep
the
federal
reserve
on
track
for
more
interest
rate
hikes
investors
are
also
keeping
an
eye
on
brazil
after
congressman
jair
bolsonaro
won
nearly
half
the
votes
in
brazil
s
presidential
election
on
sunday
marking
a
major
