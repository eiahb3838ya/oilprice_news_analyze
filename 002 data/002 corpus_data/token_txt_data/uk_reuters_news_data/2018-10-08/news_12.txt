rocked by trump's sanctions, iranian oil exports drop further
london
reuters
iran
s
crude
exports
fell
further
in
the
first
week
of
october
according
to
tanker
data
and
an
industry
source
taking
a
major
hit
from
sanctions
and
throwing
a
challenge
to
other
opec
oil
producers
as
they
seek
to
cover
the
shortfall
the
islamic
republic
exported
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
in
that
period
refinitiv
eikon
data
showed
an
industry
source
who
also
tracks
exports
said
october
shipments
were
so
far
below
million
bpd
that
s
down
from
at
least
million
bpd
in
april
before
president
donald
trump
in
may
withdrew
the
united
states
from
a
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
reimposed
sanctions
the
figure
also
marks
a
further
fall
from
million
bpd
in
september
tanker
schedules
are
often
adjusted
and
exports
can
vary
week
by
week
the
early
october
figures
add
to
signs
however
that
iranian
exports
are
falling
more
steeply
than
expected
stretching
the
ability
of
saudi
arabia
russia
and
other
producers
to
fill
the
gap
the
government
s
tough
stance
raised
the
stakes
for
a
more
significant
iran
export
loss
than
previously
foreseen
said
norbert
ruecker
head
of
macro
and
commodity
research
at
swiss
bank
julius
baer
oil
prices
have
extended
a
rally
on
expectations
the
sanctions
will
test
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
producers
brent
crude
on
wednesday
last
week
reached
a
barrel
the
highest
since
none
of
the
iranian
crude
exported
in
the
first
week
of
october
is
heading
for
europe
according
to
the
refinitiv
data
the
tankers
are
sailing
to
india
china
and
the
middle
east
while
washington
has
said
it
wants
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
iran
and
saudi
arabia
say
that
is
unlikely
the
trump
administration
is
considering
waivers
on
sanctions
for
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
india
a
major
buyer
has
ordered
iranian
oil
for
november
although
new
delhi
does
not
yet
know
whether
it
will
receive
such
a
waiver
iran
has
questioned
whether
the
market
needs
more
oil
and
says
its
output
is
holding
steady
at
about
million
bpd
iran
has
pledged
to
block
any
opec
supply
increase
that
the
country
deems
to
be
against
its
interest
the
market
does
not
want
a
single
barrel
iran
s
representative
on
opec
s
board
of
governors
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
reuters
in
late
september
but
figures
opec
compiles
from
secondary
sources
that
include
media
and
government
agencies
put
output
in
august
at
million
bpd
down
bpd
from
july
some
of
these
sources
say
output
fell
further
in
september
iran
may
indeed
have
not
cut
production
yet
to
match
the
rate
of
decline
in
its
exports
as
the
country
appears
to
be
storing
more
oil
on
ships
as
it
did
during
sanctions
that
applied
until
the
nuclear
deal
