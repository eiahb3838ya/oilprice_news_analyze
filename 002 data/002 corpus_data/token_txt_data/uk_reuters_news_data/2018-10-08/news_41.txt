shares
in
asia
staggered
on
monday
as
china
s
markets
stumbled
despite
its
central
bank
moving
to
pump
more
liquidity
into
the
broader
economy
as
worries
grow
of
a
sharp
knock
to
growth
from
an
escalating
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
the
people
s
bank
of
china
pboc
on
sunday
cut
the
level
of
cash
that
banks
must
hold
as
reserves
aimed
at
lowering
financing
costs
as
policy
makers
worry
about
fallout
from
the

with
the

reserve
requirement
ratios
rrrs
currently
percent
for
large
commercial
lenders

would
be
cut
by

points
effective
the
pboc
said
matching
a
move
in
april
asian
shares
were
also
hit
on
monday
as
investors
in
chinese
stocks
reacted
for
the
first
time
to
new
pressure
from
washington
and
a
report
that
chinese
spies
had
compromised
hardware
china

was
percent
lower
in
morning
trade
while
the
country
s
main
shanghai
composite
index
lost
percent
the
chinext
board
fell
percent
we
expect
the
pboc
will
continue
its
easing
efforts
to
keep
liquidity
ample
and
loosen
its
credit
control
to
make
funds
more
accessible
to
the
broader
economy
bofa

analysts
said
in
a
note
moreover
there
is
still
room
for
further
rrr
cuts
when
necessary
though
the
chance
for
an
interest
rate
cut
is
limited
given
the
continued
fed
rate
hiking
cycle
in
our
on
thursday
vice
president
mike
pence
highlighted
disputes
with
china
on
issues
such
as
cyber

taiwan
freedom
of

and
human

marking
a
sharpened
approach
toward

s
the
pboc
set
the
midpoint

band
at

its
weakest
level
since
may
the
offshore
yuan
was
also
weaker
at
per

higher
yields
on
treasuries
are
likely
to
put
more
pressure
on
the
yuan
as
china
continues
to
make
use
of
targeted
policy
easing
to
energise
the
domestic

friday
s
payrolls
showed
job
creation
slowed
in
september
likely
from
hurricane
florence
s
impact
on
restaurant
and
retail
payrolls
but
the
labor
department
report
also
showed
a
rise
in
wages
that
could
keep
the
federal
reserve
on
track
for
more
interest
rate
hikes
investors

also
keeping
an
eye
on
