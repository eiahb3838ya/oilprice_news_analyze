w
hen
theresa
walgraeve
and
her
husband
set
up
their
resort
in
puerto
princesa
a
city
on
the
philippine
island
of
palawan
they
worried
about
mosquitoes
and
monsoon
damp
and
the
high
cost
of
electricity
that
s
when
the
island
s
zero
carbon
resorts
programme
approached
them
with
suggestions
on
how
to
save
energy
and
costs
from
solar
panels
and
led
lights
to
rainwater
harvesting
refillable
bottles
and
bamboo
roofs
for
extra
cooling
the
walgraeves
enrolled
in
the
programme
made
the
changes
and
achieved
significant
savings
theresa
walgraeve
said
they
were
not
very
big
adjustments
but
we
were
able
to
cut
our
electricity
and
water
use
by
a
fair
amount
she
said
many
guests
are
also
mindful
and
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
are
zero
carbon
and
we
are
happy
that
we
make
a
difference
to
not
just
puerto
princesa
and
palawan
but
also
the
in
puerto
princesa
became
the
first
southeast
asian
city
to
earn
a
zero
carbon
label
meaning
it
produces
no
more
emissions
than
it
can
offset
according
to
an
audit
by
environmental
partnership
seed
and
the
manila
observatory
in
fact
by
preserving
its
forests
using
green
building
design
and
shunning
the
diesel
that
once
powered
generators
in
homes
and
hotels
the
city
is
carbon
negative
meaning
it
pulls
more
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
than
it
emits
according
to
the
audit
that
makes
it
an
outlier
in
the
philippines
but
it
like
other
philippines
cities
has
motivation
to
act
the
nation
is
one
of
those
most
severely
hit
by
wild
weather
triggered
by
climate
change
with
its
coastal
cities
particularly
vulnerable
to
rising
sea
levels
and
deadly
storms
a
report
by
the
world
s
leading
climate
scientists
released
monday
gives
a
stark
warning
that
such
threats
will
continue
to
grow
unless
the
world
can
hold
hikes
in
global
temperatures
to
degrees
celsius
just
a
half
degree
higher
than
today
around
the
world
cities
are
at
the
frontline
of
the
battle
to
curb
emissions
as
urbanisation
surges
more
than
of
the
world
s
population
is
forecast
to
live
in
cities
by
according
to
the
united
nations
cities
consume
also
more
than
of
the
world
s
energy
and
account
for
about
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
according
to
the
un
southeast
asian
cities
are
very
vulnerable
yet
lagging
behind
in
incorporating
more
renewable
energy
generation
in
their
plans
said
rob
roggema
a
professor
and
urban
sustainability
expert
at
the
university
of
technology
sydney
often
it
is
the
lack
of
political
will
that
is
the
reason
but
it
can
be
done
no
matter
how
big
or
small
the
city
with
the
participation
of
residents
and
the
private
sector
he
said
most
cities
around
the
world
are
already
dealing
with
the
effects
of
climate
change
from
hotter
and
more
humid
summers
to
deadlier
storms
and
frequent
flooding
a
growing
number
are
taking
action
leaders
of
some
of
the
biggest
cities
recently
vowed
to
make
all
buildings
carbon
neutral
by
more
than
cities
have
pledged
to
become
zero
carbon
by
admittedly
puerto
princesa
is
a
smaller
city
with
a
population
of
people
according
to
the
census
but
palawan
island
with
its
beaches
and
clear
blue
waters
is
seen
as
a
green
leader
in
the
country
years
ago
the
island
was
being
ravaged
by
illegal
logging
and
fishing
and
rampant
mining
said
edward
hagedorn
who
was
elected
mayor
of
puerto
princesa
in
hagedorn
who
hailed
from
a
family
of
loggers
vowed
in
his
victory
speech
to
make
the
city
clean
and
green
and
protect
its
natural
resources
in
two
decades
as
mayor
after
upending
term
limits
hagedorn
clamped
down
on
commercial
logging
and
mining
and
introduced
electric
tricycles
he
also
pushed
the
tourism
industry
towards
more
sustainable
practices
to
draw
more
responsible
visitors
to
its
attractions
which
include
a
subterranean
river
named
in
as
one
of
the
new
wonders
of
the
world
that
shift
has
helped
replace
jobs
lost
in
mining
and
logging
he
said
i
had
seen
firsthand
the
destruction
caused
by
rampant
logging
fishing
and
mining
hagedorn
said
when
i
won
the
election
i
had
an
epiphany
i
wanted
to
show
that
economic
development
is
possible
without
destroying
the
environment
a
low
carbon
pathway
is
the
morally
correct
one
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
at
his
urging
palawan
passed
a
strategic
environmental
plan
in
it
declares
the
state
must
protect
develop
and
conserve
its
natural
resources
and
enhance
the
environment
while
pursuing
goals
the
palawan
council
for
sustainable
development
was
set
up
to
oversee
this
goal
one
of
its
key
actions
was
launching
the
zero
carbon
resorts
programme
in
with
funding
from
the
european
union
while
member
resorts
did
not
receive
financial
assistance
they
could
request
an
audit
and
were
advised
on
how
to
make
improvements
to
increase
energy
efficiency
said
adelinea
who
leads
the
project
lessons
from
the
experience
now
have
been
incorporated
into
a
zero
carbon
and
green
building
policy
for
palawan
passed
last
month
we
are
an
island
so
we
are
particularly
vulnerable
to
climate
change
impact
said
the
measures
we
introduced
in
the
tourism
sector
renewable
energy
sources
use
of
local
materials
and
green
technologies
are
being
extended
to
other
sectors
as
the
push
for
zero
carbon
has
had
mixed
results
worldwide
while
some
cities
have
made
significant
progress
in
reducing
emissions
there
have
also
been
some
notable
failures
masdar
city
in
abu
dhabi
touted
as
the
world
s
first
city
remains
behind
schedule
and
sparsely
populated
south
korea
s
songdo
billed
as
the
world
s
greenest
city
also
has
faced
challenges
meeting
its
aims
cities
in
the
philippines
have
struggled
too
the
capital
manila
and
popular
tourist
destinations
including
cebu
are
battling
choked
streets
and
rising
pollution
president
rodrigo
duterte
earlier
this
year
called
boracay
island
a
popular
resort
a
cesspool
and
ordered
its
closure
for
six
months
warning
of
a
looming
environmental
disaster
in
contrast
puerto
princesa
s
popularity
as
a
favoured
destination
for
tourism
has
steadily
grown
with
more
than
visitors
last
year
compared
to
in
said
frances
victorio
who
worked
on
the
greenhouse
gas
audit
in
today
puerto
princesa
has
the
largest
forest
area
in
the
philippines
at
percent
and
boasts
one
of
the
healthiest
coral
reefs
said
victorio
a
former
chief
of
the
philippine
climate
change
commission
the
city
will
most
probably
remain
until
at
least
according
to
the
audit
when
population
growth
and
vehicle
emissions
threaten
to
outpace
efforts
to
cut
emissions
still
it
s
a
good
example
of
what
can
be
achieved
if
people
put
their
heads
together
and
work
for
a
common
goal
victorio
said
we
had
good
leadership
and
everyone
was
ready
to
pitch
in
for
the
greater
good
of
clean
air
and
clean
water
for
us
our
children
