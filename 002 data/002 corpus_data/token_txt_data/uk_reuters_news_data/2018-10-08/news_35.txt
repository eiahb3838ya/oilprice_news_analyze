poland expects u.s.to be "very active" at global climate talks
warsaw
reuters
the
united
states
will
be
very
active
at
december
s
climate
discussions
even
though
donald
trump
pulled
out
of
the
global
accord
the
incoming
polish
chairman
of
the
talks
said
the
delegation
will
appear
in
katowice
and
for
sure
will
be
very
active
that
was
confirmed
during
the
talks
i
had
on
this
subject
in
washington
michal
kurtyka
told
reuters
kurtyka
a
former
polish
deputy
energy
minister
said
that
although
the
united
states
had
said
it
would
quit
the
paris
agreement
this
would
formally
only
be
possible
in
while
the
accord
set
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
its
text
was
vague
on
details
a
report
on
monday
warned
that
temperatures
are
likely
to
rise
by
degrees
celsius
between
and
if
global
warming
continues
at
its
current
pace
and
if
the
world
fails
to
take
rapid
and
unprecedented
measures
to
stem
the
increase
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
met
last
week
in
incheon
south
korea
to
finalize
the
report
which
is
seen
as
the
main
scientific
guide
for
government
policymakers
on
how
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
this
will
form
a
key
part
of
the
agenda
for
environment
ministers
from
almost
governments
when
they
meet
in
katowice
the
heart
of
poland
s
region
silesia
kurtyka
said
that
a
meeting
in
bangkok
in
september
was
a
turning
point
when
it
comes
to
how
the
negotiating
parties
will
try
to
reach
a
good
result
in
katowice
but
a
number
of
sticking
points
still
has
to
be
resolved
including
how
to
finance
reducing
climate
change
a
surge
in
carbon
emission
prices
had
influenced
the
bangkok
talks
kurtyka
said
carbon
prices
have
more
than
doubled
this
year
with
utilities
ramping
up
hedging
ahead
of
supply
cuts
coming
into
effect
from
and
as
more
speculative
traders
entered
the
market
the
increase
itself
is
not
surprising
what
is
surprising
is
the
fact
that
it
happened
in
such
a
short
time
the
question
is
to
what
extent
it
reflects
the
economic
fundamentals
and
to
what
extend
this
is
a
pure
market
game
kurtyka
said
the
sudden
increase
of
carbon
price
is
unlikely
though
to
accelerate
decisions
regarding
new
energy
projects
in
poland
kurtyka
said
i
assume
that
a
energy
policy
will
be
presented
by
the
end
of
this
year
including
potential
decisions
regarding
photovoltaic
or
offshore
wind
he
added
poland
generates
most
of
its
electricity
from
coal
but
plans
to
reduce
it
to
percent
of
its
energy
mix
