temperatures
are
likely
to
rise
by
degrees
celsius
between
and
if
global
warming
continues
at
its
current
pace
and
if
the
world
fails
to
take
rapid
and
unprecedented
measures
to
stem
the
increase
a
report
said
on
monday
the
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
ipcc
met
last
week
in
incheon
south
korea
to
finalise
the
report
prepared
at
the
request
of
governments
in
when
a
global
pact
to
tackle
climate
change
was
agreed
the
report
is
seen
as
the
main
scientific
guide
for
government
policymakers
on
how
to
implement
the
paris
agreement
the
paris
pact
aims
to
limit
global
average
temperature
rise
to
well
below
above
levels
while
seeking
to
tighten
the
goal
to
there
has
already
been
a
rise
of
since
the
as
industrialisation
lifted
emissions
of
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
blamed
for
climate
change
a
rise
of
would
still
carry
risks
for
nature
and
mankind
but
the
risks
would
be
lower
than
a
rise
of
the
report
summary
said
meeting
the
limit
required
rapid
and
unprecedented
change
in
land
and
energy
use
industry
buildings
transport
and
cities
it
said
adding
temperatures
would
be
higher
between
and
at
the
current
pace
the
targets
agreed
in
paris
on
cutting
emissions
would
not
be
enough
even
if
there
were
larger
and
more
ambitious
cuts
after
it
said
to
contain
warming
at
manmade
global
net
carbon
dioxide
emissions
would
need
to
fall
by
about
percent
by
from
levels
and
reach
net
zero
by
any
additional
emissions
would
require
removing
from
the
air
limiting
warming
to
is
possible
within
the
laws
of
chemistry
and
physics
but
doing
so
would
require
unprecedented
changes
said
jim
skea
of
the
ipcc
working
group
which
assesses
climate
change
mitigation
the
summary
said
renewable
energy
would
need
to
supply
to
percent
of
electricity
by
to
stay
within
a
limit
compared
with
about
percent
now
using
carbon
capture
and
storage
ccs
technology
the
share
of
power
would
need
to
be
cut
to
percent
and
coal
to
between
and
percent
there
was
no
mention
of
oil
in
this
context
in
the
summary
if
the
average
global
temperature
temporarily
exceeded
additional
carbon
removal
techniques
would
be
required
to
return
warming
to
below
by
but
the
report
said
the
efficacy
of
measures
such
as
planting
forests
bioenergy
use
or
capturing
and
storing
were
unproven
at
a
large
scale
and
carried
some
risks
steps
like
reflecting
incoming
solar
radiation
back
into
space
were
not
assessed
because
of
the
uncertainties
about
using
such
technology
the
report
said
it
said
keeping
the
rise
in
temperature
to
would
mean
sea
levels
by
would
be
cm
lower
than
if
the
warming
was
the
likelihood
of
an
arctic
ocean
free
of
sea
ice
in
summer
would
be
once
per
century
not
at
least
once
a
decade
and
coral
reefs
would
decline
by
percent
instead
of
being
virtually
wiped
out
the
report
shows
that
we
only
have
the
slimmest
of
opportunities
remaining
to
avoid
unthinkable
damage
to
the
climate
system
that
supports
life
as
we
know
it
