polish
oil
refiner
pkn
orlen
expects
to
receive
a
first
ever
shipment
of
nigerian
crude
oil
next
month
its
ceo
said
as
poland
seeks
to
reduce
its
reliance
on
russian
supplies
pkn
orlen
poland
s
biggest
refiner
and
smaller
rival
lotos
which
it
is
taking
over
rely
mostly
on
russian
oil
delivered
via
pipelines
built
in
the
but
both
have
increased
purchases
from
other
sources
nigeria
is
our
new
source
of
supplies
we
are
exploring
currently
a
batch
of
tonnes
of
nigerian
oil
is
on
its
way
to
poland
it
is
expected
to
arrive
at
naftoport
in
gdansk
in
pkn
s
chief
executive
daniel
obajtek
told
reuters
in
an
interview
last
week
if
tests
confirm
the
assumed
yields
structure
and
margins
further
oil
supplies
from
nigeria
will
be
a
viable
option
he
said
pkn
orlen
signed
a
agreement
on
regular
oil
supplies
with
saudi
aramco
in
and
since
then
both
pkn
and
lotos
have
also
purchased
oil
from
iran
and
the
united
states
oil
supplies
from
russia
account
for
around
percent
of
all
oil
deliveries
to
pkn
down
from
around
percent
in
there
are
also
tankers
sailing
to
us
from
other
new
directions
but
at
this
stage
it
is
too
early
to
talk
about
it
we
are
holding
discussions
on
and
oil
supply
contracts
with
a
number
of
parties
including
us
partners
obajtek
also
said
obajtek
said
that
the
deteriorating
quality
of
russian
urals
crude
was
also
prompting
pkn
to
diversify
its
supplies
generally
the
lower
quality
may
impact
contract
prices
as
it
affects
our
yields
obajtek
said
but
declined
to
comment
on
whether
pkn
is
negotiating
new
contract
prices
pkn
orlen
is
taking
over
lotos
as
part
of
a
plan
announced
in
february
to
improve
its
negotiating
position
in
oil
purchases
and
to
increase
investment
capacity
obajtek
said
that
he
hoped
to
obtain
clearance
from
the
european
commission
by
we
are
in
the
phase
and
we
are
preparing
to
submit
a
merger
clearance
application
with
some
guidance
already
in
place
we
intend
to
file
a
draft
application
by
the
end
of
the
year
which
will
formally
trigger
the
process
of
negotiations
with
the
european
commission
obajtek
said
we
are
not
a
threat
to
the
european
market
we
have
a
market
share
of
around
four
percent
in
europe
while
companies
like
shell
bp
or
total
have
much
bigger
market
shares
and
these
companies
obtained
clearance
for
various
mergers
he
added
pkn
plans
to
buy
percent
of
lotos
shares
from
the
state
possibly
in
the
third
or
fourth
quarter
of
then
most
likely
by
the
end
of
pkn
will
announce
a
tender
offer
for
up
to
percent
of
lotos
shares
of
course
the
greatest
synergy
opportunities
will
come
after
the
consolidation
is
complete
and
after
we
have
taken
full
control
of
lotos
obajtek
said
pkn
orlen
has
been
working
on
the
construction
of
gigawatt
gw
offshore
wind
farms
at
the
baltic
sea
however
our
experience
in
this
area
is
limited
and
we
want
to
avoid
costly
mistakes
therefore
we
do
not
rule
out
cooperation
with
a
partner
that
would
bring
the
obajtek
said
i
would
rather
not
specify
whether
we
are
considering
a
polish
or
a
foreign
partner
but
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
there
is
no
polish
company
that
could
offer
much
valuable
experience
in
this
respect
obajtek
a
former
chief
executive
of
utility
energa
was
appointed
pkn
orlen
ceo
in
february
and
says
the
company
is
buying
a
greater
share
of
products
from
polish
manufacturers
being
a
champion
of
the
economy
is
a
commitment
obajtek
said
as
we
seek
to
build
our
business
in
a
way
that
would
strengthen
the
economy
of
our
country
