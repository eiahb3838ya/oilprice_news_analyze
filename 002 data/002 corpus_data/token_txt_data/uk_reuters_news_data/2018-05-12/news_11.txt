north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
s
trip
to
singapore
for
talks
with
president
donald
trump
poses
logistical
challenges
that
are
likely
to
include
using
aircraft
to
carry
him
and
his
limousine
as
well
as
dozens
of
security
and
other
support
staff
the
choice
of
singapore
as
the
site
of
the
meeting
of
a
sitting
president
and
a
north
korean
leader
was
as
much
because
it
was
within
reasonable
flight
time
and
distance
from
pyongyang
as
because
of
the
island
state
s
political
neutrality
a
south
korean
presidential
official
told
reporters
since
becoming
north
korea
s
leader
in
kim
has
only
taken
one
known
overseas
trip
by
air
and
that
was
earlier
this
week
to
dalian
in
china
to
hold
talks
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
he
flew
in
his
personal
jet
accompanied
by
a
cargo
plane
that
people
with
knowledge
of
north
korean
affairs
say
is
believed
to
have
carried
his
limousine
it
looks
very
much
like
the
trip
to
dalian
was
a
dry
run
said
andray
abrahamian
a
research
fellow
at
pacific
forum
csis
and
formerly
with
choson
exchange
a
group
that
trains
north
koreans
in
business
skills
at
km
from
pyongyang
s
sunan
airport
singapore
is
easily
in
the
range
of
the
aircraft
the
jet
with
four
engines
was
first
introduced
in
the
and
has
a
maximum
range
of
km
but
the
cargo
plane
can
not
fly
more
than
km
without
refuelling
if
carrying
a
full
load
it
will
therefore
have
to
stop
off
at
a
friendly
location
like
vietnam
s
capital
on
the
way
to
singapore
or
fly
with
a
reduced
load
the
originally
designed
for
moving
heavy
machinery
to
remote
parts
of
the
soviet
union
is
big
enough
to
fit
a
school
bus
or
two
shipping
containers
inside
it
according
to
passenger
and
cargo
flight
operator
antarctic
logistics
expeditions
but
the
cargo
plane
has
had
some
safety
issues
in
the
latest
incident
last
month
a
crash
killed
people
on
board
after
takeoff
from
an
algiers
air
base
unlike
his
father
kim
jong
il
who
died
in
and
who
travelled
by
armoured
train
on
his
rare
trips
abroad
because
he
feared
being
shot
down
according
to
a
north
korean
defector
familiar
with
his
security
details
the
younger
leader
is
not
known
to
be
averse
to
flying
but
air
travel
of
this
distance
does
pose
a
significantly
greater
challenge
in
transporting
communication
and
security
equipment
and
personnel
needed
to
back
up
a
summit
meeting
lee
a
defector
who
had
worked
for
the
north
s
government
and
now
heads
the
north
korea
strategic
information
service
center
in
seoul
said
the
trip
will
involve
dozens
of
security
personnel
and
equipment
including
possibly
a
personal
toilet
for
the
leader
it
will
also
mean
burning
a
large
quantity
of
jet
fuel
a
refined
oil
product
sharply
limited
by
sanctions
targeting
north
korea
imports
kim
s
two
planes
will
need
around
metric
tons
of
jet
fuel
per
aircraft
for
the
flight
from
pyongyang
to
singapore
china
the
main
source
of
fuel
for
the
north
exported
just
tons
of
jet
fuel
in
march
and
made
no
official
exports
the
two
previous
months
according
to
chinese
customs
data
but
the
north
s
planes
can
pick
up
extra
fuel
when
they
fly
to
china
and
russia
for
commercial
operations
and
international
security
experts
believe
the
north
may
have
been
stockpiling
the
fuel
which
it
has
also
used
for
its
missile
programme
the
united
states
had
preferred
geneva
the
south
korean
presidential
official
told
reporters
requesting
anonymity
to
discuss
the
arrangements
for
the
summit
meeting
but
singapore
was
selected
as
it
was
the
most
realistically
viable
destination
kim
jong
un
could
probably
travel
when
considering
the
travel
time
and
flight
the
two
sides
initially
considered
meeting
in
the
panmunjom
truce
village
straddling
the
korean
military
border
the
scene
of
the
third
summit
attended
by
kim
and
south
korean
president
moon
last
month
the
official
said
the
official
said
the
south
did
not
know
the
reason
why
panmunjom
was
dropped
there
was
no
confirmation
on
the
specific
location
for
the
meeting
between
kim
and
trump
although
there
are
a
number
of
sites
in
singapore
that
can
guarantee
security
protection
including
hotels
that
have
experience
hosting
events
singapore
media
and
a
singapore
government
official
said
singapore
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
said
the
country
was
honoured
to
host
it
and
would
do
our
best
to
facilitate
a
smooth
and
successful
meeting
in
a
telephone
call
with
trump
on
friday
trump
said
the
summit
would
contribute
to
resolving
the
long
outstanding
issue
of
securing
peace
and
stability
on
the
korean
peninsula
singapore
s
foreign
ministry
said
the
meeting
is
scheduled
for
one
day
on
june
but
if
either
or
both
of
the
leaders
decide
to
stay
overnight
there
is
only
one
hotel
room
in
all
of
the
city
that
meets
security
protocol
for
the
president
according
to
a
source
with
knowledge
of
previous
presidential
visits
that
is
the
meter
suite
in
the
valley
wing
of
the
hotel
of
