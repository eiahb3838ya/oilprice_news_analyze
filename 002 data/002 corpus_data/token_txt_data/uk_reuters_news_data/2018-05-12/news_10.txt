more
destructive
lava
flows
could
soon
hit
hawaii
s
big
island
as
the
kilauea
volcano
erupts
posing
a
greater
threat
than
oozing
magma
that
has
so
far
destroyed
dozens
of
homes
and
forced
thousands
to
evacuate
scientists
said
as
a
lava
lake
at
kilauea
s
summit
drains
inside
the
volcano
magma
is
running
underground
it
could
burst
to
the
surface
as
large
and
intensely
hot
lava
flows
and
produce
higher
levels
of
toxic
gases

neal
said
what
will
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
in
terms
of
hazard
is
if
hotter
fresher
magma
makes
it
to
the
surface
and
that
could
be
what
is
coming

kilauea
one
of
the
world
s
most
active
volcanoes
threatens
to
begin
a
series
of
explosive
eruptions
within
days
or
weeks
that
could
form
huge
clouds
of
volcanic
smog
or
vog
and
hurl
boulders
as
big
as
small
