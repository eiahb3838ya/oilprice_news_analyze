gas
pg
sites
around
the
world
large
gas
turbines
are
increasingly
unloved
as
the
world
shifts

renewable
energy
which
is
weighing
on
siemens
earnings
and
prompting
the
group
to
restructure
the
pg
business
in
november
siemens
said
it
would
cut
jobs
mainly
at
the
pg
division
which
once
thrived
on
supplying
turbines
for
electricity
generation
excluding
its
services
business
the
pg
division
has
around
employees
worldwide
of
which
are
based
in
germany
the
shutdowns
are
part
of
a
comprehensive
package
of
measures
which
also
includes
issues
such
as
travel
costs
sponsoring
participation
in
trade
fairs
and
investments
