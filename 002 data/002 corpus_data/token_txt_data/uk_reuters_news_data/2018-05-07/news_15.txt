seeks
to
boost
food

reduce
reliance

the
plan

expected
to
be

a
member

been
encouraging

incentives
such
as
low
interest
loans
in
a
bid
cut
the
state
s
billion
annual
bill
for
food
and
other
imports
the
government
relies
on
oil
exports
for
about
percent
of
its
revenues

are
only
now
starting
to
recover
after
a
crash
in
crude
prices

red

nation
of

were
allowed
to
enter
partnerships
with
foreigners
but
the
foreign
investors
were
not
allowed
to
directly
hold
a
concession
that
initiative
failed
to
