more
than

share
index
was
up
percent
the
dollar
rose
to
a
new
peak
extending
its
rally
as
investors
unwound
short
positions
against
the
currency
and
bet
that
the
relative
strength
of
the
economy
would
feed
through
to
a
stronger
greenback
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
which
has
enjoyed
a
sudden
reversal
in
fortunes
as
investors
bet
on
more
fed
rate
hikes
and
a
slower
pace
of
tightening
in
the
euro
zone
rose
percent
to
having
shrugged
off
friday

report
the
euro
slid
to
below
versus
the
dollar
down
half
a
percent
on
the
day

its
weakest
since

germany
industrial
orders
unexpectedly
dropped
for
the
third
month
running

the

ahead
includes
readings
on
the
health
of
the
chinese
economy
and
inflation
and
a
bank
of
england
monetary
policy
meeting
looking
at
the
economic
data
everything
is
looking
quite
positive
no
one
expects
higher
interest
rates
to
be
a
brake
on
economic
growth
said
christensen
the
soft
german
data
supported
euro
zone
government
bond
markets
as
investors
continued
to
bet
on
caution
from
the
european
central
bank
a
lot
has
been
repriced
in
terms
of
the
ecb
so
the
outlook
for
bonds
is
a
bit
more
mixed
