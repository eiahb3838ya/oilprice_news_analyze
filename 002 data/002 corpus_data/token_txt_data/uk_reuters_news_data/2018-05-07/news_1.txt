the
dollar
rose
to
fresh
highs
on
monday
while
oil
prices
climbed
to
their
highest
since
late
driven
by
declining
venezuelan
crude
production
and
worries
the
united
states
could
sanctions
on
iran
the
crude
surge
lifted
energy
stocks
in
europe
and
on
wall
street
with
european
shares
supported
by
strong
results
and
gains
in
nestle
after
the
swiss
company
agreed
to

to
starbucks
in
a
global
coffee
alliance

for
the
first
time

investor
sentiment
investors
increased
bets
that

interest
rates
would
continue
to
boost
the
dollar
while

unwound
their
bearish
positions
on
the
greenback
an
index
that
tracks
the
dollar
against
a
basket
of
leading
currencies
climbed
to
its
highest
since

the
index
was
last
up
percent
at
the
general
view
right
now
is
that
the
dollar
is
probably
going
to
continue
to
move
a
bit
higher
against
the
euro
in
particular
maybe
against
the
yen
as
well
said
larry
hatheway
chief
economist
at
gam
investment
solutions
the
euro
could
slip
to
or
even
as
a
support
level
as
the
federal
reserve
tightens
monetary
policy
and
the
european
economy
trends
weaker
he
said
there
s
a
general
appreciation
the
fed

going
to
move
at
least
twice
again

is
shifting
toward
three
more

could
further
crimp

and
exports

donald
trump
will
withdraw
the
