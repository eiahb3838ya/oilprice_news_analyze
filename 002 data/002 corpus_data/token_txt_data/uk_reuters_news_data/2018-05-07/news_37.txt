cyprus, israel seek gas-sharing formula to unlock east med energy hub
reuters
an
ownership
squabble
over
cyprus
main
natural
gas
field
is
threatening
to
delay
dollar
plans
to
turn
the
eastern
mediterranean
into
a
major
energy
hub
israeli
prime
minister
benjamin
netanyahu
and
energy
minister
yuval
steinitz
are
flying
to
cyprus
on
tuesday
to
spur
plans
to
join
the
two
countries
electricity
grids
and
construct
a
pipeline
to
link
newly
found
gas
fields
to
mainland
europe
standing
in
the
way
however
is
a
dispute
over
aphrodite
a
gas
field
discovered
in
at
the
edge
of
cyprus
economic
waters
one
tip
of
it
stretches
across
the
border
into
israel
s
maritime
zone
at
stake
is
billion
cubic
metres
of
gas
worth
close
to
billion
billion
pounds
according
to
one
recent
estimate
in
israel
that
is
less
than
percent
of
aphrodite
s
total
reserves
and
a
fraction
of
the
gas
already
discovered
in
israel
israel
says
it
will
not
give
up
on
the
gas
and
the
companies
operating
on
the
israeli
side
are
ready
for
legal
action
in
case
aphrodite
is
developed
without
them
i
assume
we
will
find
a
solution
in
good
spirit
so
we
can
keep
cooperating
on
bigger
more
important
things
steinitz
told
reuters
several
large
gas
fields
have
been
discovered
in
the
region
over
the
past
decade
and
israel
and
cyprus
have
grown
close
while
collaborating
in
their
development
steinitz
says
he
and
his
cypriot
counterpart
yiorgos
lakkotrypis
have
become
good
friends
but
that
does
not
guarantee
a
quick
solution
the
government
of
israel
can
not
give
up
not
even
as
a
gesture
of
friendship
on
its
territories
or
its
natural
resources
steinitz
said
he
said
the
governments
have
asked
the
companies
to
reach
an
understanding
among
themselves
on
how
much
gas
is
on
each
side
if
they
don
t
reach
an
understanding
then
we
will
ask
a
professional
arbiter
or
a
professional
group
to
examine
the
findings
from
both
sides
and
decide
on
the
proper
division
he
said
the
cypriot
energy
ministry
declined
to
comment
but
officials
in
nicosia
said
lakkotrypis
has
suggested
a
similar
course
of
action
steinitz
said
during
his
visit
that
the
countries
may
agree
on
a
general
format
to
solve
the
issue
but
a
final
agreement
could
take
weeks
or
months
charles
ellinas
ceo
of
energy
consultancy
said
this
should
not
be
a
deal
breaker
if
the
two
governments
between
them
agree
to
abide
by
the
findings
of
the
arbitration
then
it
takes
the
heat
out
of
it
and
that
s
what
they
need
to
do
at
this
meeting
this
week
he
said
aphrodite
is
smaller
than
two
huge
gas
fields
tamar
and
leviathan
discovered
in
israel
around
the
same
time
but
it
was
a
milestone
for
cyprus
developing
it
are
royal
dutch
shell
noble
energy
and
israel
s
delek
drilling
they
are
looking
to
sell
the
gas
domestically
and
abroad
with
a
focus
on
egypt
where
shell
has
a
liquefaction
plant
the
field
is
also
meant
to
be
a
link
in
the
km
pipeline
being
planned
by
igi
poseidon
a
joint
venture
between
greece
s
natural
gas
firm
depa
and
italian
energy
group
edison
to
carry
israeli
and
cypriot
gas
to
western
greece
a
final
investment
decision
on
the
pipeline
with
an
expected
price
tag
of
up
to
billion
euros
billion
could
come
next
year
exploration
in
both
countries
continues
and
many
current
and
future
discoveries
will
likely
be
connected
to
each
other
to
cut
costs
on
infrastructure
the
aphrodite
partners
would
not
comment
on
the
dispute
though
a
footnote
in
delek
s
financial
report
stated
that
the
vast
majority
of
gas
was
in
cyprus
and
a
minority
was
in
the
adjacent
yishai
prospect
on
the
israeli
side
the
yishai
consortium
which
includes
energy
firm
israel
opportunity
and
nammax
oil
and
gas
a
company
linked
to
billionaire
beny
steinmetz
has
already
spent
million
on
exploratory
drilling
the
group
commissioned
a
assessment
that
concluded
yishai
s
estimated
bcm
of
gas
could
be
worth
close
to
billion
production
will
have
to
happen
in
cyprus
since
that
is
where
most
of
the
gas
lies
said
rony
halman
chairman
of
israel
opportunity
but
he
envisions
the
yishai
group
being
like
smaller
partners
for
aphrodite
but
we
will
be
part
of
the
system
they
are
prepared
to
bring
a
legal
challenge
in
europe
in
case
of
any
opposition
we
as
a
company
will
bring
a
commercial
claim
that
will
stop
the
development
we
have
already
sat
with
lawyers
in
london
we
retained
lawyers
for
this
issue
halman
said
we
are
not
willing
to
give
up
