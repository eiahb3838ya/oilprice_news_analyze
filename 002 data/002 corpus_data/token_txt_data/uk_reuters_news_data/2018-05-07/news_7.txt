reuters
wind
farms
have
boosted
local
tax
bases
and
generated
new
revenue
as
they
expand
across
the
united
states
especially
for
rural
areas
moody
s
investors
service
said
in
a
report
on
monday
what
we
re
seeing
is
wind
farms
generate
new
operating
revenues
lower
the
tax
burden
for
local
residents
moody
s
analyst
frank
mamo
told
reuters
in
many
cases
local
governments
are
using
this
new
money
to
address
what
was
a
growing
backlog
of
deferred
capital
in
adair
county
iowa
construction
of
new
wind
farms
has
grown
the
tax
base
nearly
percent
over
the
last
decade
giving
it
money
to
fix
bridges
and
streets
wind
farm
taxes
are
also
paying
over
percent
of
debt
service
for
webb
consolidated
independent
school
district
in
texas
moody
s
noted
in
jackson
county
minnesota
a
wind
production
tax
generates
nearly
percent
of
the
county
s
annual
operating
revenues
and
helped
fund
construction
of
a
new
public
works
facility
nearly
half
of
the
country
s
installed
wind
power
capacity
is
located
in
texas
iowa
oklahoma
and
california
the
report
showed
yet
wind
power
is
growing
elsewhere
at
least
counties
in
states
had
wind
farms
as
of
january
more
than
double
the
number
that
had
them
years
ago
moody
s
found
the
developments
have
expanded
rapidly
in
kansas
and
minnesota
for
instance
the
primary
factor
for
placing
wind
farms
is
an
abundance
of
wind
but
government
tax
incentives
and
mandated
clean
energy
requirements
can
also
drive
their
location
the
tax
boost
is
especially
strong
in
counties
that
are
allowed
to
apply
their
locally
determined
property
tax
rate
to
the
valuation
of
wind
turbines
as
they
do
in
iowa
there
the
state
lets
wind
farms
be
phased
into
a
county
s
tax
base
starting
at
percent
of
a
turbine
s
assessed
valuation
annually
until
it
hits
a
maximum
of
percent
iowa
s
booming
wind
energy
sector
also
prompted
tech
companies
including
apple
alphabet
microsoft
and
facebook
to
invest
a
total
of
nearly
billion
on
data
centers
moody
s
said
counties
can
also
tax
annual
kilowatt
hours
of
wind
energy
produced
as
is
the
case
in
minnesota
moody
s
expects
demand
for
wind
energy
to
remain
strong
despite
the
of
a
federal
production
tax
credit
talk
of
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
waning
political
support
for
state
incentives
