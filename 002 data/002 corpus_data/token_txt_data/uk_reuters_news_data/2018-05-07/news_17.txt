tourism
is
responsible
for
a
twelfth
of
world
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
a
vacation
boom
is
complicating
a

scientists
said
on

emissions
from
tourism
mostly
by
domestic
travelers
were
highest
in
the
united

china
germany

a

tourism
including
flights
hotels

even
the
production
of
souvenirs
emitted
the
equivalent
of
billion
tonnes
of
carbon

in
the
most
recent
data
available
or
percent
of
all

up
from

was
far
above
many
previous
estimates
using
narrower
definitions
that
tourism
accounts
for
just
to
percent
of

emissions
it
said
and
on
current
trends
the
tourism
industry
will
emit
billion

of

the
