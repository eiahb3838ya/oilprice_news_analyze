saudi
arabia
would
supply
sudan
s
energy
needs
for
five
years
on
credit
under
an
agreement
being
discussed
by
both
governments
sudan
oil
minister
abdulrahman
othman
said
on
monday
othman
said
the
deal
would
provide
about
million
tonnes
of
oil
a
year
to
sudan
which
in
recent
months
has
been
hit
by
a
sharp
foreign
currency
crisis
and
an
acute
fuel
shortage
that
has
forced
people
to
queue
at
gas
stations
for
hours
once
an
oil
exporter
sudan
was
forced
to
begin
importing
it
after
the
south
seceded
in
taking
with
it
of
the
country
s
oil
output
and
its
main
source
of
foreign
currency
a
source
in
the
presidency
s
office
in
khartoum
said
the
final
agreement
is
expected
to
be
signed
within
days
sudan
s
foreign
currency
crunch
arose
from
decades
of
sanctions
that
were
lifted
last
year
but
new
sources
of
foreign
currency
have
failed
to
materialise
khartoum
has
been
expecting
financial
support
from
wealthy
gulf
arab
allies
but
little
has
trickled
into
the
sprawling
country
of
million
people
the
potential
oil
deal
comes
after
sudan
s
defence
minister
told
parliament
last
week
that
the
government
was
reconsidering
its
military
participation
in
yemen
where
sudan
has
sent
at
least
ground
troops
to
support
a
coalition
