indonesia
is
targeting
annual
production
of
million
tonnes
of
coal
this
year
and
next
a
mining
ministry
official
said
on
monday
as
producers
of
the
fuel
are
struggling
to
get
new
heavy
equipment
and
parts
that
s
up
around
percent
from
the
million
tonnes
indonesia
produced
in
indonesia
s
national
development
planning
board
bappenas
has
pushed
for
coal
output
to
be
capped
at
million
tonnes
in
but
according
to
coal
and
minerals
director
general
bambang
gatot
ariyono
that
target
needs
to
be
harmonised
with
other
considerations
otherwise
there
could
be
idle
capacity
or
miners
coal
production
could
be
he
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
coaltrans
asia
conference
ariyono
referred
to
environmental
permits
allowing
output
to
reach
million
tonnes
this
year
and
million
tonnes
in
and
feasibility
studies
presenting
other
figures
amid
concerns
indonesia
could
exhaust
existing
minable
coal
reserves
of
billion
tonnes
years
the
government
is
considering
measures
to
push
miners
to
carry
out
exploration
work
before
they
can
obtain
permits
to
increase
output
it
could
start
next
year
ariyono
said
indonesian
coal
exploration
has
increased
as
almost
all
miners
have
increased
their
capital
spending
this
year
pandu
sjahrir
chairman
of
the
indonesian
coal
mining
association
told
reporters
to
improve
the
mine
life
a
lot
of
miners
are
carrying
out
and
increasing
stripping
ratios
to
increase
reserves
that
s
a
saving
for
the
future
almost
all
players
he
said
however
heavy
equipment
shortages
are
limiting
expansion
particularly
for
smaller
miners
sjahrir
said
in
general
getting
equipment
parts
is
difficult
and
up
to
the
middle
of
it
will
be
difficult
to
increase
production
but
for
smaller
players
it
will
be
more
difficult
because
of
shortages
of
suppliers
remain
wary
of
providing
equipment
to
contractors
as
purchases
of
costly
heavy
equipment
are
often
repaid
over
a
period
of
up
to
five
years
sjahrir
said
according
to
andy
coles
president
director
of
mining
services
contractor
bis
industries
waiting
times
for
excavators
are
currently
around
months
everyone
is
looking
for
equipment
he
said
shortages
of
equipment
like
trucks
rollers
and
graders
made
by
caterpillar
inc
komatsu
and
volvo
mean
it
is
harder
for
miners
to
ramp
up
output
and
take
advantage
of
recent
improvements
in
coal
prices
he
said
the
shortages
also
threatened
to
disrupt
mining
operations
coles
added
when
you
get
rain
combined
with
no
maintenance
you
get
a
significant
deterioration
of
roads
and
that
impacts
your
hauling
equipment
destroys
the
springs
engines
everything
falls
according
to
indika
energy
group
managing
director
azis
armand
wet
weather
hit
operations
of
many
indonesian
miners
in
and
the
first
quarter
of

conditions
are
now
