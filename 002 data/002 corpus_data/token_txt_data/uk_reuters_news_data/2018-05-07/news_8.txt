ankara
reuters
the
iranian
oil
industry
will
continue
to
develop
even
if
the
united
states
pulls
out
of
the
nuclear
deal
and
tehran
would
see
the
accord
as
operational
as
long
as
it
can
sell
oil
the
oil
ministry
s
news
service
quoted
senior
officials
as
saying
on
monday
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
deal
by
not
extending
sanctions
waivers
when
they
expire
on
may
unless
european
signatories
of
the
accord
fix
what
he
calls
its
flaws
they
can
not
stop
iran
our
oil
industry
s
development
will
continue
even
if
new
sanctions
are
imposed
on
iran
shana
quoted
gholamreza
manouchehri
deputy
head
of
the
national
iranian
oil
company
as
saying
on
its
website
sanctions
imposed
on
iran
in
early
by
the
united
states
and
european
union
over
its
nuclear
programme
cut
iran
s
crude
exports
from
a
peak
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
before
the
sanctions
to
a
little
more
than
million
bpd
but
iran
as
a
major
oil
exporter
in
january
when
international
sanctions
were
suspended
in
return
for
curbs
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
manouchehri
said
iran
planned
to
finalise
seven
upstream
contracts
worth
around
billion
with
foreign
investors
shana
reported
these
contracts
will
be
finalised
under
the
current
challenging
circumstances
by
year
october
this
planning
has
been
made
with
the
assumption
of
delayed
presence
of
western
companies
he
added
major
european
companies
partly
fearing
harsh
penalties
because
of
the
remaining
sanctions
on
iran
have
been
reluctant
to
do
business
with
tehran
which
needs
to
attract
over
billion
in
foreign
investment
to
boost
its
crude
output
france
s
total
became
the
first
western
energy
firm
to
sign
a
deal
with
iran
after
the
easing
of
international
sanctions
in
agreeing
to
develop
phase
of
the
south
pars
offshore
gas
field
with
a
total
investment
of
billion
deputy
oil
minister
amirhossein
zamaninia
also
said
that
iran
considered
the
deal
alive
if
we
can
continue
to
sell
our
oil
and
its
products
even
if
the
united
states
pulls
out
also
we
should
be
able
to
maintain
iran
s
oil
market
receive
our
oil
money
and
secure
foreign
investment
in
our
oil
industry
he
added
iran
says
it
aims
to
raise
its
crude
oil
production
capacity
to
million
bpd
within
the
next
four
years
though
exports
might
be
disrupted
if
trump
refuses
to
renew
iran
s
sanctions
waivers
next
week
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
russia
and
several
other
producers
began
to
reduce
oil
output
in
january
in
an
attempt
to
erase
a
supply
glut
and
prop
up
prices
they
have
extended
the
pact
until
december
and
meet
in
june
to
review
policy
we
back
opec
s
decisions
under
normal
circumstances
but
iran
always
gives
priority
to
its
own
interests
whoever
produces
more
oil
has
more
power
in
the
market
zamaninia
said
iran
s
regional
rival
saudi
arabia
meanwhile
has
shown
a
willingness
to
keep
tightening
crude
markets
the
world
s
largest
crude
exporter
has
consistently
opposed
iran
s
nuclear
deal
fearing
that
it
will
strengthen
iran
economically
and
allow
it
to
increase
funding
for
proxy
conflicts
in
lebanon
syria
iraq
and
yemen
saudi
officials
want
to
limit
iran
s
oil
market
this
is
a
fight
over
controlling
the
crude
market
zamaninia
said
saleh
hendi
head
of
the
nioc
s
exploration
organisation
said
exploration
blocks
were
also
scheduled
to
be
tendered
in
july
of
the
exploration
blocks
six
blocks
for
which
development
agreements
will
be
signed
are
expected
to
be
attractive
to
foreign
investors
