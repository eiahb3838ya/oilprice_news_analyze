facebook
will
double
the
size
of
its
data
center
in
sweden
s
northern
city
of
lulea
raising
its
total
investments
in
the
region
to
about
billion
crowns
million
the
company
said
on
monday
the
campus
opened
in
is
the
first
facebook
data
center
set
up
outside
the
united
states
the
expansion
will
make
it
one
of
the
largest
data
centers
in
the
world

hub
partly
owned

promote

in

centers
sweden
and
its
nordic
neighbors
with
cheap
electricity
and
low
temperatures
are
attractive
for
data
centers
with
many
silicon
valley
giants
and
cryptocurrency
miners
rushing
to
move
in
facebook
will
add
a
third
building
to
the
existing
two
at
the
lulea
data
center
which
vattenfall
supplies
electricity
to
this
third
building
will
measure
nearly
square
meters
and
we
anticipate
will
start
serving
traffic
in
early
facebook
said
in
a
statement
the
expansion
will
increase
the
social
media
giant
s
total
cumulative
investment
in
the
region
to
around
billion
crowns
it
added
without
disclosing
the
exact
cost
of
the
new
project
lulea
s
mayor
niklas
nordstrom
said
the
new
building
would
double
the
size
of
the
data
center
to
more
than
square
meters
million
square
feet
and
double
its
capacity
of
operations
the
current
campus
consumes
more
than
one
percent
of
sweden
s
total
power
production
and
that
will
also
double
he
told
reuters
the
expansion
will
create
about
new
facebook
jobs
at
the
center
which
currently
employs
fewer
than
people
while
its
construction
will
create
about
temporary
jobs
nordstrom
said
in
sweden
cut
its
tax
rate
on
electricity
for
data
centers
by
percent
to
the
same
level
as
other
heavy
industries
such
as
steelworks
and
car
plants
making
it
attractive
for
new
investments
