technical
talks
between
egypt
sudan
and
ethiopia
over
a
disputed
dam
ethiopia
is
building
on
the
nile
river
failed
to
make
a
breakthrough
egypt
s
foreign
minister
said
on
monday
amid
pressure
for
a
deal
before
the
project
opens
this
year
egypt
and
ethiopia
are
at
loggerheads
over
the
construction
of
the
grand
renaissance
dam
a
project
that
cairo
fears
will
reduce
waters
that
run
to
its
fields
and
reservoirs
from
ethiopia
s
highlands
and
via
sudan
addis
ababa
hopes
the
dam
will
make
it
a
hub
for
the
region
and
denies
it
will
undermine
egypt
s
access
to
water
sameh
shoukry
said
technical
experts
who
met
in
addis
ababa
last
week
did
not
achieve
a
breakthrough
i
have
spoken
to
the
minister
of
irrigation
who
attended
this
meeting
and
what
has
reached
me
is
that
the
obstruction
that
has
bogged
down
this
path
for
more
than
a
year
has
not
been
overcome
shoukry
told
reporters
during
a
news
conference
in
cairo
with
his
visiting
ugandan
counterpart
he
said
both
ethiopia
and
sudan
continued
to
have
reservations
about
a
technical
report
by
a
french
firm
commissioned
to
assess
the
dam
s
environmental
and
economic
impact
ties
between
egypt
and
sudan
were
strained
when
khartoum
backed
the
dam
because
of
its
need
for
electricity
the
three
african
neighbours
are
set
to
meet
on
may
for
further
talks
shoukry
said
adding
egypt
had
initially
proposed
several
earlier
dates
for
negotiations
but
they
were
turned
down
by
the
two
other
countries
earlier
this
month
talks
in
khartoum
between
egypt
ethiopia
and
sudan
also
failed
to
reach
agreement
but
were
described
by
sudan
s
foreign
minister
as
constructive
