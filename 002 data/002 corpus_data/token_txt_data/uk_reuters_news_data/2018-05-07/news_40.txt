asian
jet
fuel
buyers
are
paying
the
highest
premiums
for
this
time
of
year
in
years
as
new

expanded

push
its

the

a

the
booming

has
also
pushed
up
the
profit
margins
known
as
cracks
refiners
make
from
producing
jet
fuel
to
their
highest
since
early
demand
for
jet
fuel
which
is
composed
of
the
middle
distillate
fuel
kerosene
that
is
also
used
for

was
expected
to
ease
after
the
winter
heating
season
but
consumption
has
stayed
strong
on
a
jump
in
orders
from
the
aviation
industry
the
demand
earlier
this
winter
drove
the
jet
premium
to
a
barrel
the
most
since

coming

said
last

the
current
run
of
seasonal
oil
refinery
maintenance
in
asia
has
added
to
the
pricing
pressure
by
curtailing
the
supply
of
jet

available
to
the
market
there
is
million
barrels
per

bpd
of

according
to

from

that
is
nearly
equal
to
the
crude

demand
of

this
supply
tightness
is
occurring
as
travel
demand
in
country
s
like
china
and
india
spur
more
jet

china

domestic
air

alone
climbed
percent
in

from
a
year

the
strongest
pace
in

months
iata
data
showed
india
s
march
domestic

rose
by
percent
marking
the
straight
month
of

embarks
on
an
ambitious
