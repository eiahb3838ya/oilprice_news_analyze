indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
ruling
party
is
struggling
to
change
a
perception
that
it
is
against
minority
muslims
and
people
a
political
ally
said
which
could
cost
it
votes
in
a
general
election
due
next
year
modi
s
hindu
nationalist
bharatiya
janata
party
bjp
trounced
the
opposition
at
the
last
election
in
but
it
has
lost
a
handful
of
recent
after
opposition
groups
banded
together
veteran
politician
ram
vilas
paswan
a
federal
minister
and
the
chief
of
the
lok
jan
shakti
people
s
power
party
which
is
allied
with
the
bjp
and
says
it
represents
india
s
socially
backward
classes
predicted
another
term
for
modi
but
he
said
the
bjp
would
have
to
work
towards
changing
its
image
as
a
group
that
caters
mainly
to
hindus
whatever
the
government
is
doing
it
is
doing
for
everyone
even
for
the
minority
community
it
has
done
a
lot
paswan
said
in
an
interview
in
his
bungalow
seated
on
a
couch
under
a
huge
oil
painting
of
himself
but
despite
everything
the
perception
is
not
changing
among
the
minorities
and
the
scheduled
castes
socially
backward
classes
irrespective
of
the
work
being
india
s
billion
people
are
about
percent
hindu
and
percent
muslim
according
to
the
latest
census
data
backward
classes
make
up
about
of
the
hindu
population
critics
say
the
bjp
s
hindu
nationalist
agenda
has
polarised
the
population
since
modi
came
to
power
in
hardline
hindu
groups
and
cow
protection
vigilantes
have
carried
out
numerous
attacks
on
muslims
accused
of
eating
beef
or
killing
cows
many
hindus
believe
cows
are
sacred
and
killing
them
is
banned
in
most
states
a
crackdown
on
abattoirs
tanneries
and
leather
factories
mostly
run
by
muslims
has
also
hit
a
large
number
of
hindus
who
transport
cattle
and
work
in
tanneries
paswan
said
the
opposition
could
take
advantage
of
the
bjp
s
class
hindu
image
and
it
needed
to
be
countered
aggressively
the
bjp
said
paswan
s
comment
was
a
observation
from
an
ally
but
that
the
party
has
foiled
repeated
attempts
of
the
opposition
congress
party
to
create
an
impression
that
the
bjp
is
losing
the
perception
battle
we
need
to
be
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
opposition
parties
have
been
raising
a
bogey
of
but
so
far
they
ve
failed
said
bjp
spokesman
narasimha
rao
when
modi
won
office
in
his
party
or
its
partners
ruled
only
seven
of
india
s
states
today
it
is
in
power
in
of
them
and
has
replaced
congress
as
the
party
with
strongest
nationwide
presence
but
in
for
parliamentary
seats
since
last
year
the
bjp
has
lost
all
of
them
and
two
small
regional
parties
have
walked
out
of
the
ruling
coalition
paswan
whose
party
enjoys
considerable
support
from
the
muslim
community
in
his
home
state
of
bihar
in
the
east
said
ending
ties
with
the
national
democratic
alliance
nda
was
unthinkable
this
is
essentially
a
government
of
the
bjp
they
have
an
absolute
majority
still
modi
has
given
space
to
allies
like
us
said
paswan
a
member
of
parliament
who
began
his
political
career
in
can
t
even
think
of
leaving
the
nda
no
one
has
approached
me
and
i
am
happy
