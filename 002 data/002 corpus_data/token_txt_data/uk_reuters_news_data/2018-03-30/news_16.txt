a
federal
judge
on
thursday
dismissed
exxon
mobil
corp
s
lawsuit
seeking
to
stop
new
york
and
massachusetts
from
probing
whether
the
oil
and
gas
company
covered
up
its
knowledge
about
climate
change
and
lied
to
investors
and
the
public
about
it
district
judge
valerie
caproni
in
manhattan
rejected
as
implausible
exxon
s
argument
that
the
states
democratic
attorneys
general
eric
schneiderman
and
maura
healey
were
pursuing
politically
motivated
bad
faith
fraud
investigations
in
order
to
violate
its
constitutional
rights
caproni
dismissed
the
lawsuit
with
prejudice
meaning
the
irving
company
can
not
bring
it
again
exxon
is
evaluating
its
legal
options
spokesman
scott
silvestri
said
in
an
email
we
believe
the
risk
of
climate
change
is
real
and
we
want
to
be
part
of
the
solution
he
added
we
ve
invested
about
billion
on
energy
efficiency
and
technologies
such
as
carbon
capture
and
next
generation
the
case
is
one
of
several
including
shareholder
and
employee
lawsuits
centered
on
whether
exxon
has
for
decades
lied
about
climate
change
including
its
impact
on
energy
prices
and
the
environment
and
its
ability
to
develop
reserves
and
taken
public
positions
inconsistent
with
what
it
knew
schneiderman
in
a
statement
welcomed
the
end
of
what
he
called
exxon
s
frivolous
nonsensical
lawsuit
that
wrongfully
attempted
to
thwart
a
serious
state
law
enforcement
healey
called
caproni
s
decision
a
turning
point
in
our
investigation
and
a
victory
for
the
exxon
sued
in
june
after
receiving
subpoenas
seeking
documents
about
its
historical
understanding
of
climate
change
and
communications
with
interest
groups
and
shareholders
the
company
accused
schneiderman
and
healey
of
conspiring
to
silence
and
intimidate
one
side
of
the
public
policy
debate
violating
its
rights
to
free
speech
and
due
process
and
against
unreasonable
searches
much
of
exxon
s
case
was
based
on
a
march
news
conference
with
the
attorneys
general
and
former
vice
president
al
gore
which
it
called
a
bid
to
coerce
its
adoption
of
policies
that
they
and
climate
change
activists
preferred
caproni
however
said
nothing
that
was
said
can
fairly
be
read
to
constitute
declaration
of
a
political
vendetta
against
she
said
the
belief
by
schneiderman
and
healey
apparently
shared
by
exxon
that
climate
change
is
real
does
not
mean
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
exxon
may
have
fraudulently
sowed
confusion
to
bolster
its
bottom
line
nowhere
she
said
did
exxon
suggest
that
the
attorneys
general
believed
the
company
was
itself
confused
about
the
causes
or
risks
of
climate
