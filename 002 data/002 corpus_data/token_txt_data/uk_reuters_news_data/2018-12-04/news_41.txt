deputy
minister
arcandra
tahar
said
a
spokesman
for
italy
s
eni
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
the
matter
the
targets
are
part
of
an
amended
development
plan
for
the
east
sepinggan
block
in
the
makassar
strait
under
a
new
production
sharing
contract
that
is
expected
to
be
completed
before
he
said
as
part
of
the
revision
the
contractors
have
agreed
to
adopt
a
gross
split
scheme
whereby
eni
and
its
partner
pertamina
would
take
percent
of
crude
oil
and
percent
of
natural
gas
production
from
the
project
and
the
indonesian
government
would
take
the
rest
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
split
was
set
previously
eni
said
in
april
it
had
obtained
approval
for
plans
to
pipe
natural
gas
from
merakes
to
the
bontang
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
processing
facility
in
east
kalimantan
the
amendment
would
be
first
time
a
conventional
contract
in
indonesia
is
converted
to
use
the
gross
split
scheme
tahar
said
by
using
the
gross
split
scheme
it
will
be
simpler
and
they
don
t
need
a
lengthy
tender
process
so
they
see
it
as
an
opportunity
tahar
said
referring
to
eni
s
proposal
to
make
the
switch
which
he
said
had
been
received
two
weeks
ago
indonesia
recently
adjusted
its
gross
split
mechanism
for
new
and
expiring
oil
and
gas
production
sharing
contracts
whereby
contractors
shoulder
the
cost
of
exploration
and
production
rather
than
being
reimbursed
by
the
government
the
changes
were
intended
to
attract
investment
amid
tepid
interest
in
indonesia
s
energy
tenders
and
after
the
industry
pointed
to
more
attractive
opportunities
in
other
countries
tahar
said
the
merakes
project
has
an
estimated
billion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
reserves
and
an
economic
lifetime
of
around
nine
years
eni
holds
an
percent
participating
interest
in
the
contract
via
its
local
unit
eni
east
sepinggan
limited
while
indonesia
s
pertamina
has
percent
with
the
revision
the
contract
duration
up
to
july
will
not
change
