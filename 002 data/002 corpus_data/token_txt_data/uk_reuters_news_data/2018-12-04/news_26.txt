french
independent

association
anode
is
considering
making
a
legal
challenge
to
a
government
freeze
on
edf
s
electricity
prices
it
said
on
tuesday
the
government
on
tuesday
suspended
increases
to
fuel
taxes
for
at
least
six
months
in
response
to
weeks
of
sometimes
violent
public
protests
and
said
it
would
keep
gas

power

unchanged

president
fabien
chone
said
the
proposed
freeze
on
edf
s
regulated
tariffs
threatens
the
survival
of
some
of
its
members
these
operators
all
compete
against
edf
which
has
an
percent
share
of
the
retail
power
market
the
government
should
lower
power
taxes
or
introduce
support
measures
for
anode
s
members
it
said
failing
that
we
may
have
to
initiate
a
legal
challenge
chone
told
reuters
anode
includes
direct
energie
engie
italy
s
eni
and
dozens
of
smaller
operators
government
attempts
to
freeze
power
prices
have
been
challenged
systematically
by
anode
in
recent
years
and
cancelled
by
the
state
council
france
s
highest
administrative
court
with
consumers
forced
to
pay
fees
retroactively
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
said
that
from
to
march
the
government
would
organise
a
nationwide
debate
on
energy
and
that
power
and
gas
prices
would
not
increase
in
the
meantime

specialist
colombus
consulting
expects
french
power
prices
to
rise
by
between
percent
and
percent
next
year
even
at
percent
it
would
be
the
highest
increase
in
years
energy
regulator
cre
has
said
it
would
make
a
proposal
to
the
government
in
february
with
a
view
to
introducing
new
tariffs
in
early
the
government
would
then
have
three
months
to
validate
the
cre
proposal
which
means
it
could
postpone
a
decision
until
after
the
may
european
parliament
elections
many
french
governments
have
postponed
tariff
increases
to
protect
consumers
and
their
own
approval
ratings
but
legally
the
government
has
no
authority
to
set
prices
the
tariffs
freeze
allows
the
government
to
buy
time
but
they
know
they
will
be
overruled
and
it
will
come
back
at
them
like
a
boomerang
said
colombus
consulting
s
nicolas
goldberg
unlike
power
prices
which
typically
move
once
a
year
gas
prices
move
every
month
