opec works on deal to cut output, still needs russia on board
vienna
dec
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
are
working
towards
a
deal
to
reduce
oil
output
by
at
least
million
barrels
per
day
four
sources
said
adding
that
russia
s
resistance
to
a
significant
production
cut
was
so
far
the
main
stumbling
block
opec
meets
on
thursday
in
vienna
followed
by
talks
with
allies
such
as
russia
on
friday
amid
a
drop
in
crude
prices
caused
by
global
economic
weakness
and
concerns
about
an
oil
glut
due
largely
to
a
rise
in
production
the
producer
group
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
has
indicated
a
need
for
steep
reductions
in
output
from
january
but
has
come
under
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
help
support
the
world
economy
with
lower
oil
prices
possibly
complicating
any
opec
decision
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
riyadh
the
sources
three
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
one
from
a
producer
said
the
meeting
was
taking
place
in
a
difficult
environment
and
that
russia
s
position
would
be
key
in
reaching
a
deal
russia
is
playing
tough
one
of
the
opec
sources
said
russian
sources
have
indicated
the
country
could
contribute
some
bpd
to
a
reduction
but
middle
opec
insists
moscow
cut
by
bpd
two
opec
sources
said
talks
were
focusing
on
a
cut
of
percent
from
october
output
levels
with
no
exemptions
for
any
member
until
those
main
criteria
are
met
opec
could
endure
a
fall
in
oil
prices
for
a
while
if
it
opted
to
delay
a
decision
on
a
cut
for
a
month
or
two
one
of
the
sources
said
opec
can
always
meet
again
in
february
and
decide
on
a
cut
then
those
who
were
not
able
or
willing
to
cooperate
will
be
wanting
to
cut
then
the
source
added
qatar
said
on
monday
it
would
quit
opec
to
focus
on
gas
in
a
swipe
at
saudi
arabia
which
is
trying
to
show
unity
in
tackling
the
slide
in
oil
prices
