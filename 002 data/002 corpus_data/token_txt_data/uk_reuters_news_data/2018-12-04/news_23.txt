carbon emissions from rich nations set to rise in 2018-iea
london

carbon
dioxide
emissions
from
the
world
s
advanced
economies
are
set
to
rise
slightly
in
breaking
a
decline
mainly
due
to
higher
oil
and
natural
gas
use
the
international
energy
agency
iea
says
based
on
the
latest
energy
data
available
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
north
america
the
european
union
and
other
advanced
economies
in
asia
pacific
are
set
to
increase
by
around
percent
in
this
is
lower
than
the
percent
rise
in
economic
growth
but
ends
the
declining
trend
of
the
past
five
years
the
iea
said
in
a
statement
on
tuesday
this
week
talks
began
in
katowice
poland
between
around
countries
to
work
out
guidelines
for
implementing
the
paris
agreement
which
aimed
at
limiting
a
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
between
and
degrees
celsius
global
emissions
need
to
peak
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
enter
a
steep
decline
for
countries
to
meet
their
climate
goals
under
this
pact
emerging
economies
are
also
expected
to
emit
more
carbon
dioxide
this
year
than
in
the
iea
said
the
agency
will
release
its
final
global
energy
and
data
for
next
march
current
data
suggests
emissions
growth
globally
the
iea
said
even
though
renewable
energy
deployment
is
growing
and
coal
consumption
declining
in
some
parts
of
the
world
oil
demand
and
natural
gas
use
have
been
growing
this
year
there
are
also
still
a
large
number
of
new
coal
plants
being
built
the
iea
expects
this
will
lead
to
a
rise
in
global
emissions
in
following
last
year
s
percent
increase
which
ended
a
period
of
flat
emissions
between
and
this
turnaround
should
be
another
warning
to
governments
as
they
meet
in
katowice
this
week
said
fatih
birol
the
iea
s
executive
director
increasing
efforts
are
needed
to
encourage
even
more
renewables
greater
energy
efficiency
more
nuclear
and
more
innovation
for
technologies
such
as
carbon
capture
utilization
and
storage
and
hydrogen

instance
