internal feud shakes french sugar group tereos as markets plunge
dec
reuters
french
cooperative
tereos
the
world
s
second
largest
sugar
maker
is
holding
extraordinary
elections
to
its
membership
council
this
week
which
the
group
hopes
will
end
an
internal
feud
at
the
group
already
struggling
with
an
slump
a
sharp
fall
in
sugar
prices
in
the
european
union
has
triggered
a
crisis
in
the
industry
that
has
also
hit
rivals
such
as
suedzucker
nordzucker
and
associated
british
foods
for
tereos
the
impact
of
low
sugar
prices
has
been
particularly
harsh
due
to
the
company
s
heavy
debt
burden
and
deep
exposure
to
sugar
tereos
posted
a
loss
last
season
and
is
likely
to
record
another
in
weighed
down
by
its
european
sugar
activities
chief
executive
alexis
duval
told
reuters
as
concern
over
tereos
financial
situation
grew
among
its
members
out
of
elected
members
of
the
council
of
regions
quit
over
the
summer
to
protest
at
management
strategy
council
members
are
designated
by
cooperative
members
to
represent
them
at
tereos
general
assembly
the
group
said
this
week
s
elections
to
replace
them
with
results
expected
on
wednesday
were
an
opportunity
for
unity
after
months
of
public
wrangling
make
no
mistake
the
temptation
to
pit
tereos
people
and
regions
against
each
other
and
the
chimera
to
turn
in
upon
ourselves
are
deadly
poisons
for
our
cooperative
francois
leroux
chairman
of
tereos
supervisory
board
told
cooperative
members
in
a
letter
last
week
tereos
held
regional
meetings
in
october
to
answer
cooperative
members
concerns
fueled
by
two
anonymous
letters
about
the
group
s
critical
financial
condition
and
an
internal
rebellion
by
three
resigning
board
members
the
company
has
been
under
pressure
to
reduce
its
billion
euro
billion
debt
burden
and
boost
cash
as
it
looks
to
offset
losses
from
its
sugar
operations
which
account
for
nearly
half
of
revenues
with
the
rest
mostly
from
ethanol
starch
and
sweeteners
tereos
has
been
growing
a
lot
but
it
was
mostly
funded
by
internal
cash
flows
or
from
debt
because
as
a
cooperative
they
can
not
raise
equity
said
maxime
puget
director
at
s
p
global
ratings
which
rates
tereos
bonds
they
have
high
levels
of
debt
due
to
previous
acquisitions
and
they
have
never
been
able
to
and
that
s
their
tereos
said
in
june
it
was
considering
selling
a
minority
stake
to
help
it
continue
growing
abroad
and
diversifying
its
activities
it
is
due
to
unveil
initial
details
of
its
capital
increase
around
spring
next
year
tereos
fast
expansion
notably
in
brazil
where
it
is
the
third
largest
sugar
maker
has
left
many
of
its
french
sugar
beet
farmers
frustrated
because
they
have
received
little
return
from
it
we
feel
we
need
to
change
strategy
away
from
internationalisation
and
expansion
at
all
costs
because
that
s
where
debt
came
from
benoit
mazure
a
grower
in
the
beauce
region
south
of
paris
three
former
members
of
tereos
supervisory
board
voiced
strong
concern
about
the
group
s
future
over
the
summer
asking
for
more
details
and
transparency
they
were
expelled
from
the
cooperative
for
defamation
in
august
a
move
seen
as
extreme
by
many
members
in
protest
the
dissidents
launched
a
petition
in
september
they
say
gathered
over
votes
to
request
an
extraordinary
general
meeting
reflection
about
the
group
s
future
has
been
seriously
slowed
down
by
this
fight
said
a
senior
tereos
employee
who
asked
not
to
be
named
plus
it
doesn
t
make
the
group
very
attractive
for
a
capital
industry
sources
told
reuters
that
a
representative
of
tereos
supervisory
board
had
approached
germany
s
nordzucker
this
summer
to
potentially
seek
capital
through
a
tereos
denied
that
the
supervisory
or
the
management
board
had
contacted
the
german
company
nordzucker
declined
to
comment
tereos
has
not
contacted
potential
investors
who
can
participate
in
this
project
today
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
because
we
will
have
to
do
some
study
first
and
because
it
is
a
project
for
the
future
there
is
no
rush
duval
said
european
sugar
companies
profits
have
plunged
as
world
sugar
prices
fell
to
their
lowest
in
a
decade
this
year
amid
a
surge
in
supplies
partly
driven
by
more
output
from
the
eu
after
it
scrapped
export
and
output
quotas
last
year
germany
s
suedzucker
the
world
s
leading
sugar
maker
slashed
its
earnings
forecast
on
expectations
that
sugar
prices
will
fail
to
recover
in
the
the
group
however
carries
less
debt
and
as
a
publicly
listed
company
has
been
able
to
raise
cash
through
equity
markets
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
company
say
it
is
unlikely
tereos
will
find
a
partner
or
go
public
until
sugar
prices
rebound
significantly
sugar
was
trading
at
a
tonne
on
tuesday
morning
up
percent
from
the
low
touched
in
august
but
still
well
below
the
traded
at
the
same
time
in
with
sugar
prices
at
or
we
would
not
be
in
the
mess
we
are
today
said
etienne
clabaut
one
of
the
tereos
supervisory
board
members
who
left
in
july
there
is
a
danger
but
we
can
still
bounce
