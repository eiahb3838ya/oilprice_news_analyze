public anger as air pollution in western balkan cities worsens
sarajevo
reuters
when
winter
arrives
in
the
western
balkans
it
is
not
unusual
for
dense
smog
to
envelop
its
cities
making
it
hard
to
breathe
and
impairing
visibility
but
this
year
pollution
levels
are
among
the
highest
in
the
world
and
public
anger
is
on
the
rise
in
recent
days
the
bosnian
macedonian
and
kosovar
capitals
topped
the
charts
of
the
world
s
most
polluted
cities
as
the
smog
intensified
due
to
heavy
traffic
excessive
use
of
coal
poor
spatial
planning
and
solid
fuel
based
heating
the
air
quality
index
measured
by
the
embassy
in
sarajevo
hit
on
tuesday
a
level
identified
by
the
world
health
organization
who
as
hazardous
to
health
and
almost
ten
times
the
average
in
pristina
the
index
registered
on
monday
night
and
marked
air
quality
in
several
macedonian
towns
as
very
poor
this
is
all
the
result
of
a
situation
in
which
political
elites
treat
the
city
as
a
construction
plot
which
should
be
occupied
at
all
costs
rather
than
a
place
where
people
live

sarajevo

eko
akcija
environmental
group
said
you
can
feel
how
bad
the
air
smells
even
inside
the
car
or
home
said
a
taxi
driver
mirsad
pobric
according
to
the
who
pollution
costs
bosnia
the
equivalent
of
more
than
a
fifth
of
its
annual
gross
domestic
product
gdp
every
year
around
billion
in
lost
work
and
school
days
healthcare
and
fuel
costs
macedonia
loses
an
equivalent
of
percent
of
gdp
a
year
to
pollution
the
world
bank
said
in
a
report
more
than
million
a
year
as
a
way
of
bringing
more
attention
to
the
issue
the
embassy
of
sweden
has
been
using
red
lighting
on
its
facade
in
central
sarajevo
to
reflect
air
quality
each
day
the
deeper
the
red
the
worse
the
pollution
according
to
the
who
bosnians
die
of
air
pollution
per
citizens
a
year
compared
to
in
sweden
the
world
bank
estimates
that
in
macedonia
there
are
deaths
related
to
air
pollution
per
year
pollution
is
killing
people
of
bosnia
and
herzegovina
therefore
something
really
needs
to
be
done
swedish
ambassador
anders
hagelberg
told
reuters
as
part
of
efforts
to
combat
the
issue
sweden
has
launched
a
project
in
bosnia
that
will
bring
together
experts
from
its
environmental
protection
agency
and
local
agencies
and
governments
the
aim
of
the
program
is
to
help
improve
air
quality
monitoring
but
also
to
bring
more
investment
into
energy
efficiency
macedonia
has
launched
its
own
program
to
combat
air
pollution
to
which
the
government
allocated
million
euros
million
in
next
year
s
budget
it
aims
to
halve
skopje
s
air
pollution
within
two
years
by
reducing
taxes
for
central
heating
restricting
traffic
and
introducing
stricter
control
of
industrial
emissions
activists
say
the
funds
allocated
are
insufficient
and
that
the
government
s
response
is
inadequate
