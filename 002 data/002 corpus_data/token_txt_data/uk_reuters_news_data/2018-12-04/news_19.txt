update 5-macron makes u-turn on fuel-tax increases in face of "yellow vest" protests
paris
reuters
france
s
prime
minister
on
tuesday
suspended
planned
increases
to
fuel
taxes
for
at
least
six
months
in
response
to
weeks
of
sometimes
violent
protests
the
first
major
by
president
emmanuel
macron
s
administration
in
months
in
office
in
announcing
the
decision
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
said
anyone
would
have
to
be
deaf
or
blind
not
to
see
or
hear
the
roiling
anger
on
the
streets
over
a
policy
that
macron
has
defended
as
critical
to
combating
climate
change
the
french
who
have
donned
yellow
vests
want
taxes
to
drop
and
work
to
pay
that
s
also
what
we
want
if
i
didn
t
manage
to
explain
it
if
the
ruling
majority
didn
t
manage
to
convince
the
french
then
something
must
change
said
philippe
no
tax
is
worth
jeopardising
the
unity
of
the
along
with
the
delay
to
the
tax
increases
that
were
set
for
january
philippe
said
the
time
would
be
used
to
discuss
other
measures
to
help
the
working
poor
and
squeezed
who
rely
on
vehicles
to
get
to
work
and
go
shopping
earlier
officials
had
hinted
at
a
possible
increase
to
the
minimum
wage
but
philippe
made
no
such
commitment
he
warned
citizens
however
that
they
could
not
expect
better
public
services
and
lower
taxes
if
the
events
of
recent
days
have
shown
us
one
thing
it
s
that
the
french
want
neither
an
increase
in
taxes
or
new
taxes
if
the
falls
then
spending
must
fall
because
we
don
t
want
to
pass
our
debts
on
to
our
children
and
those
debts
are
already
sizeable
he
said
the
measures
will
cost
around
billion
euros
billion
but
will
be
offset
by
corresponding
spending
cuts
a
government
source
said
the
yellow
vest
movement
which
started
on
as
a
protest
group
named
for
the
jackets
all
motorists
in
france
carry
in
their
cars
began
with
the
aim
of
highlighting
the
squeeze
on
household
spending
brought
about
by
macron
s
taxes
on
fuel
however
over
the
past
three
weeks
the
movement
has
evolved
into
a
wider
broadbrush
uprising
with
many
criticising
the
president
for
pursuing
policies
they
say
favour
the
rich
and
do
nothing
to
help
the
poor
despite
having
no
leader
and
sometimes
unclear
goals
the
movement
has
drawn
people
of
all
ages
and
backgrounds
and
tapped
into
a
growing
malaise
over
macron
s
leadership
over
the
past
two
days
ambulance
drivers
and
students
have
joined
in
and
launched
their
own
protests
two
unions
cgt
and
fo
called
lorry
drivers
to
start
a
strike
from
december
while
several
facebook
pages
were
also
urging
new
rounds
of
demonstrations
for
next
saturday
after
three
weeks
of
rising
frustration
there
was
scant
indication
philippe
s
measures
would
placate
the
yellow
vests
who
themselves
are
struggling
to
find
a
unified
position
the
french
don
t
want
crumbs
they
want
a
baguette
yellow
vest
spokesman
benjamin
cauchy
told
bfm
adding
that
the
movement
wanted
a
cancellation
of
the
taxes
another
one
christophe
chalencon
was
more
blunt
we
re
being
taken
for
idiots
he
told
reuters
using
a
stronger
expletive
the
timing
of
the
tax
is
uncomfortable
for
macron
it
comes
as
governments
meet
in
poland
to
try
to
agree
measures
to
avert
the
most
damaging
consequences
of
global
warming
an
issue
macron
has
made
a
central
part
of
his
agenda
his
carbon
taxes
were
designed
to
address
the
issue
but
the
scale
of
the
protests
against
his
policies
made
it
almost
impossible
to
plough
ahead
while
the
yellow
vest
movement
was
mostly
peaceful
to
begin
with
the
past
two
weekends
have
seen
outpourings
of
violence
and
rioting
in
paris
with
extreme
and
factions
joining
the
demos
on
saturday
the
arc
de
triomphe
national
monument
was
defaced
and
avenues
off
the
champs
elysees
were
damaged
cars
buildings
and
some
cafes
were
torched
the
unrest
is
estimated
to
have
cost
the
economy
millions
with
disruption
to
retailers
wholesalers
the
restaurant
and
hotel
trades
in
some
areas
manufacturing
has
been
hit
in
the
run
up
to
christmas
macron
a
former
investment
banker
and
economy
minister
came
to
office
in
promising
to
overhaul
the
economy
revitalise
growth
and
draw
foreign
investment
by
making
the
nation
a
more
attractive
place
to
do
business
in
the
process
he
earned
the
tag
president
of
the
rich
for
seeming
to
do
more
to
court
big
business
and
ease
the
tax
burden
on
the
wealthy
discontent
has
steadily
risen
among
workers
and
others
who
feel
he
represents
an
urban
elite
for
macron
who
is
sharply
down
in
the
polls
and
struggling
to
regain
the
initiative
a
further
risk
is
how
opposition
parties
leverage
the
anger
and
the
decision
to
shift
course
ahead
of
european
parliament
elections
next
may
support
for
the
under
marine
le
pen
and
the
of
melenchon
has
been
rising
macron
has
cast
those
elections
as
a
battle
between
his
progressive
ideas
and
what
he
sees
as
their
promotion
of
nationalist
or
agendas
le
pen
was
quick
to
point
out
that
the
postponement
of
the
increases
took
the
decision
beyond
the
european
elections
