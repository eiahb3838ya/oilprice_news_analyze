deflating

war
knocked
world
stocks
off
highs
on
tuesday
while
growing
fears
the
economy
could
be
headed
for
recession
sooner
than
expected
weighed
on
the
dollar
the
rapprochement
between
president
donald
trump
and
china
s
xi
jinping
at
the
weekend
meeting
had
fired
up
markets
on
monday
but
the
upbeat
mood
quickly
dissipated
on
scepticism
that
washington
and
beijing
can
resolve
differences
on
trade
in
the
agreed
negotiating
window
adding
to
market
woes
was
an
inversion
of
the
short
end
of
the
yield
curve
which
raised
the
spectre
of
a
possible
recession
following
declines
on
asian
bourses
where
japan
s

stock
index
closed

lower
the
mood
was

slipping

while

the
initial

rally
was
never
going
to
last
investors
need
more
detail
now
in
order
for
that
risk
on
sentiment
to
survive
said
jasper
lawler
head
of
research
at
london
capital
group
so
far
that
detail
has
not
been
coming
through
and
investors
have
more
questions
than
there
was
confusion
over
when
the
period
during
which
the
and
china
would
hold
off
on
imposing
more
tariffs
would
start
a
white
house
official
said
it
started
on
while
earlier
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
told
reporters
it
would
start
on
moreover
none
of
the
commitments
that
officials
said
had
been
given
by
china
including
reducing
its
percent
tariffs
on
autos
were
agreed
to
in
writing
and
specifics
had
yet
to
be
hammered
out
meanwhile
the
yield
curve
focussed
investors
minds
the
curve
between
and
and
between
and
paper
inverted
on
monday
the
first
parts
of
the
treasury
yield
curve
to
invert
since
the
financial
crisis
excluding
very
debt
analysts
expect
the
yield
curve
seen
as
a
predictor
of
a
recession
to
follow
suit
on
tuesday
the
yield
on
benchmark
treasury
notes
was
at
percent
compared
with
its
monday
close
of
percent
and
the
spread
between
and
treasury
yields
tightened
to
around
basis
points
hitting
its
narrowest
level
since
july
the
focus
is
now
shifting
to
the
inverted
bond
yield
curve
which
has
negative
connotations
while
implying
the
economy
is
heading
towards
what
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
an
improbable
economic
slowdown
said
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
apac
at
oanda
now
even
recessionary
fear
is
starting
to
raise
its
ugly
however
analysts
said
manufacturing
data
released
on
monday
pointed
to
a
stronger
economic
outlook
with
new
orders
a
key
driver
in
boosting
activity
meanwhile
oil
prices
extended
gains
adding
to
monday

surge

the

chairman
jerome
powell
was
scheduled
to
testify
on
wednesday
to
a

committee
but
the
hearing
was
postponed
because
of
a
national
day
of
mourning
for
president
george
bush
who
died
on
friday
the
dollar
came
under
pressure
last
week
on
powell
s
comments
that
rates
were
nearing
neutral
levels
which
markets
widely
interpreted
as
signalling
a
slowdown
in

sterling
was

rollercoaster
rallying
sharply
after
the
