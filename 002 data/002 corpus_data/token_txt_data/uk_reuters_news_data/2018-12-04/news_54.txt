the
northern
winter
usually
leads
to
a
demand
and
price
peak
for
several
major
commodities
in
asia
but
this
year
is
bucking
the
trend
for
coal
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
iron
ore
there
doesn
t
appear
to
be
one
single
driving
narrative
causing
the
break
with
the
usual
seasonal
patterns
rather
a
variety
of
unrelated
or
loosely
related
factors
are
at
work
but
with
china
as
a
common
thread
lng
provides
the
most
stark
example
with
the
spot
asian
price
actually
weakening
at
a
time
when
it
is
usually
strengthening
it
dropped
to
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
in
the
week
to
the
weakest
since
late
july
spot
lng
has
in
the
past
few
years
exhibited
a
strong
and
reliable
seasonal
pattern
in
asia
rising
to
a
before
slackening
into
summer
the
peak
so
far
in
has
been
in
summer
when
lng
reached
per
mmbtu
in
june
above
the
prior
of
from
lng
has
been
influenced
by
a
variety
of
factors
with
summer
prices
rising
because
of
demand
for
cooling
amid
weather
and
some
supply
issues
including
an
outage
at
malaysia
s
bintalu
project
the
winter
price
surge
hasn
t
happened
largely
because
china
the
world
s
lng
importer
and
a
major
driver
of
winter
demand
is
not
experiencing
the
same
demand
surge
as
it
did
last
year
in
chinese
demand
for
lng
soared
as
the
country
moved
sharply
to
cut
back
on
the
use
of
coal
for
residential
heating
over
winter
amid
efforts
to
mitigate
air
pollution
however
this
winter
china
appears
to
have
prepared
more
thoroughly
building
up
natural
gas
inventories
and
being
more
cautious
in
the
amount
of
switching
being
undertaken
a
winter
so
far
in
north
asia
has
also
limited
demand
for
spot
cargoes
from
major
buyers
such
as
japan
and
south
korea
in
coal
the
experienced
since
the
price
recovery
started
in
has
been
absent
in
part
because
of
the
warmer
weather
but
also
because
of
moves
in
china
to
restrict
imports
the
price
of
thermal
coal
at
australia
s
newcastle
port
as
assessed
by
argus
media
was
a
tonne
in
the
week
ended
while
this
was
up
a
touch
from
the
low
of
a
tonne
the
prior
week
it
s
still
well
below
the
peak
of
reached
in
in
common
with
lng
china
the
world
s
biggest
coal
importer
appears
to
be
playing
a
role
in
keeping
the
polluting
fuel
from
enjoying
a
chinese
trading
companies
said
the
authorities
in
beijing
have
indicated
that
coal
imports
are
to
be
wound
back
for
december
as
part
of
efforts
to
keep
imports
for
around
the
same
level
as
that
will
be
difficult
as
imports
for
the
first
months
of
at
million
tonnes
were
already
within
spitting
distance
of
the
total
of
million
for
the
whole
of
china
s
coal
utilities
have
plentiful
inventories
for
winter
amid
rising
domestic
production
and
it
s
believed
the
authorities
are
prioritising
the
consumption
of
local
supplies
iron
ore
is
another
commodity
that
usually
enjoys
a
strong
run
in
the
northern
winter
albeit
usually
toward
the
tail
end
as
chinese
steel
mills
start
to
ahead
of
the
summer
peak
demand
for
steel
this
year
iron
ore
peaked
in
late
february
with
the
grade
as
assessed
by
argus
media
reaching
a
tonne
on
but
the
steelmaking
ingredient
may
have
already
reached
its
having
hit
on
and
subsequently
dropping
sharply
to
a
low
of
on
it
has
recovered
somewhat
since
then
to
a
tonne
on
monday
but
that
was
most
likely
because
commodities
in
general
got
a
boost
from
news
of
the
trade
dispute
ceasefire
between
president
donald
trump
and
his
chinese
counterpart
xi
jinping
iron
ore
is
declining
in
tandem
with
chinese
steel
prices
which
have
been
suffering
because
of
a
poorer
demand
outlook
and
still
strong
production
whether
iron
ore
can
stage
a
late
winter
rally
will
likely
be
dependent
on
whether
the
market
takes
the
view
that
china
s
infrastructure
and
construction
spending
look
positive
for
overall
it
appears
that
without
any
deliberate
policy
moves
china
has
disrupted
the
normal
season
pattern
for
some
of
its
major
commodity
imports
this
is
perhaps
an
important
reminder
that
the
world
s
biggest
buyer
of
natural
resources
can
make
commodities
dance
to
its
tune
even
without
really
trying
