asian

fell
on

as
relief
over
a
pause

of
the

adding

an

the
temporary

on
further
hostilities
in
the

war
between

had
sparked

that

can
resolve

tariffs
on

were
agreed
to
in

and
specifics
had
yet
to
be
hammered
out
the
fear
across
global
markets
is
that
this
is
just
a
short

and
we
will
find
ourselves
back
where
we
were

inverted
on
monday
the
first
parts
of
the
treasury
yield
curve
to
invert
since
the
financial
crisis
excluding

analysts
expect
an
inversion
of
the

curve
seen
as
a
predictor
of
a
recession
to
follow
suit
on
tuesday
the

on

was
at

compared
with
its
close
of

on
monday
the

also
fell
but
by
a
narrower
margin
touching
percent
compared
with
a
close
of

that
put

between

around

reinforce
these

about
the

potentially
heading

said
prakash
sakpal
an
economist
at

he
added
