special report-wall street cleans up on 'clean' coal subsidies
reuters
earlier
this
year
the
chief
financial
officer
of
global
insurance
giant
arthur
gallagher
explained
to
analysts
how
the
company
had
turned
a
energy
subsidy
into
a
profit
machine
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
its
bottom
line
the
money
came
from
the
clean
coal
tax
credit
a
provision
of
the
american
jobs
act
of
meant
to
encourage
the
use
of
chemically
treated
coal
to
cut
pollution
in
the
nation
s
power
plants
to
capitalise
on
the
subsidy
gallagher
arranged
investor
partnerships
to
produce
vast
quantities
of
refined
coal
as
the
fuel
is
known
in
the
industry
for
utilities
across
the
nation
splitting
the
benefit
of
the
lucrative
government
incentive
now
worth
more
than
pounds
per
ton
our
return
on
investment
is
staggering

howell
told

in
the
march
call
oh
percent
percent

percent
i
mean
just
because
it
costs
so
little
to
develop
clean
coal
facilities
gallagher
s
experience
reflects
a
truth
about
the
refined
coal
tax
credit
a
subsidy
that
now
costs
taxpayers
about
billion
a
year
while
coal
mining
firms
utility
companies
and
power
consumers
can
benefit
indirectly
from
the
subsidy
the
big
winners
are
a
diverse
group
of
investors
ranging
from
wall
street
s
most
powerful
banks
to
insurers
meat
packers
and
drug
makers
who
identified
the
incentive
as
an
easy
way
to
make
money
over
the
past
decade
these
companies
have
financed
the
construction
of
facilities
to
produce
refined
coal
which
are
situated
next
to
power
plants
and
typically
cost
about
million
to
million
each
to
develop
they
then
sell
the
resulting
coal
to
utilities
below
cost
but
make
returns
from
the
subsidy
rather
than
the
underlying
business
according
to
regulatory
documents
and
interviews
gallagher
s
howell
took
credit
for
designing
a
business
model
to
maximize
profits
from
the
subsidy
in
his
march
call
with
analysts
it
is
our
machine
he
said
we
developed
it
we
pioneered
the
company
has
accumulated
about
million
worth
of
tax
credits
mostly
from
its
side
business
in
refined
coal
howell
said
on
an
conference
call
with
investors
and
analysts
and
at
current
production
levels
of
refined
coal
he
said
that
may
total
another
million
through
howell
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
gallagher
spokeswoman
linda
collins
minimized
the
importance
of
clean
coal
to
the
company
refined
coal
is
not
a
part
of
our
core
brokerage
and
risk
management
business
collins
said
in
an
email
refined
coal
activities
however
accounted
for
percent
of
the
company
s
billion
in
total
revenue
during
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
according
to
aj
gallagher
financial
statements
they
also
made
up
about
a
fifth
of
the
company
s
million
in
net
earnings
attributable
to
controlling
interests
during
that
period
while
the
subsidy
has
proven
a
boon
for
investors
it
has
often
failed
to
achieve
the
intended
reductions
of
nitrogen
oxides
or
nox
the
primary
contributor
to
smog
and
acid
rain
utilities
that
burn
refined
coal
have
trailed
competitors
burning
raw
coal
in
lowering
nox
emissions
and
of
plants
burning
refined
coal
have
seen
nox
emission
rates
rise
instead
of
fall
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
epa
emissions
data
vetted
by
industry
experts
the
refined
coal
tax
subsidy
is
scheduled
to
expire
in
but
lawmakers
including
republican
senator
john
hoeven
of
north
dakota
have
introduced
legislation
to
extend
it
another
years
they
argue
it
helps
the
environment
extends
the
life
of
the
ailing
coal
industry
a
centrepiece
of
the
trump
administration
s
energy
policy
and
reduces
power
prices
by
giving
utilities
a
cheap
subsidized
source
of
coal
this
is
really
an
incentive
to
operate
in
a
way
that
s
more
environmentally
friendly
while
keeping
power
costs
low
said
hoeven
whose
state
sits
atop
an
supply
of
lignite

if
the
extension
goes

these

investors
stand
to
gain
at
least
billion
in
tax
incentives
over
the
next
decade
if
the
law
is
extended
based
on
the
current
annual
consumption
of
refined
coal
and
the
existing
level
of
the
tax
credit
as
originally
drawn
in
the
refined
coal
tax
credit
required
producers
to
increase
raw
coal
s
market
value
by
percent
to
qualify
for
the
subsidy
the
clause
made
utilities
unwilling
to
buy
the
specialized
product
prospects
for
the
clean
coal
business
were
dim
but
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis
two
senators
changed
the
landscape
by
deleting
the
clause
a
subtle
tweak
tucked
away
in
the
massive
billion
financial
rescue
package
gallagher
along
with
utility
firms
ameren
corp
and
dte
energy
also
had
been
lobbying
on
the
issue
of
refined
coal
according
to
lobbying
disclosure
filings
though
it
is
unclear
if
they
lobbied
specifically
on
the
clause
officials
at
ameren
and
dte
declined
to
comment
on
the
lobbying
the
policy
edit
by
democrat
max
baucus
of
coal
mining
state
montana
and
republican
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
made
it
possible
for
refined
coal
producers
to
receive
the
subsidy
even
if
they
sold
their
product
to
utilities
below
cost
that
paved
the
way
for
investors
to
set
up
operations
and
to
ultimately
make
billions
of
dollars
building
refined
coal
to
its
current
share
of
about
a
fifth
of
the
coal
market
baucus
said
he
does
not
remember
the
change
to
the
refined
coal
tax
credit
it
was
a
blizzard
a
deluge
of
credits
was
being
discussed
baucus
said
it
s
very
easy
to
change
the
code
to
give
credit
to
companies
to
spur
investment
the
code
gets
crusted
with
barnacles
of
credits
and
then
they
re
removed
it
s
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
grassley
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
the
subsidy
is
now
worth
more
than
a
ton
an
amount
that
covers
losses
on
the
discounted
pricing
and
the
operations
that
produce
refined
coal
while
often
leaving
a
profit
that
can
amount
to
tens
or
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
per
year
per
investor
according
to
disclosures
by
tax
credit
investors
because
some
of
the
operating
expenses
of
running
a
refined
coal
facility
are
deductible
the
tax
credit

value
