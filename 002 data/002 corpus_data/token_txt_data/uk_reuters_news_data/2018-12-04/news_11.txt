larger
than

patrick
schorn
executive
vice
president
of
wells
at
schlumberger
said
at
a
conference
in
new
york
leading
to
a
bigger
decline
in
pricing
than
the
company
had
forecast
originally
oilfield
service
companies
this
year
have
been
hit
by
a
slowdown
in
demand
as
regional
oil
prices
have
fallen
with
transportation
bottlenecks
faced
by
producer
customers
a
recent
drop
in
the
benchmark
crude
to
around
a
barrel
also
has
stoked
concern
of
an
oil
glut

is
guiding

the
first

rock
oil
producers
have
been
pulling
back
on
fracking
and
completing
wells
because
of
the
pipeline
bottlenecks
and
price
weakness
schorn
said
recent
price
declines
would
likely
prompt
its
customers
to
take
a
more
conservative
approach
during
the
start
of
and
that
any
in
international
investment
also
could
be
tepid
looking
forward
to
next
year
the
recent
volatility
in
oil
prices
has
introduced
more
uncertainty
