update 5-opec works on deal to cut output, still needs russia on board
vienna
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
are
working
towards
a
deal
this
week
to
reduce
oil
output
by
at
least
million
barrels
per
day
four
sources
said
adding
that
russia
s
resistance
to
a
major
cut
was
so
far
the
main
stumbling
block
opec
meets
on
thursday
in
vienna
followed
by
talks
with
allies
such
as
russia
on
friday
amid
a
drop
in
crude
prices
caused
by
global
economic
weakness
and
fears
of
an
oil
glut
due
largely
to
a
rise
in
production
the
producer
group
s
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
has
indicated
a
need
for
steep
reductions
in
output
from
january
but
has
come
under
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
help
support
the
world
economy
with
lower
oil
prices
possibly
complicating
any
opec
decision
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
on
riyadh
the
sources
three
from
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
one
from
a
producer
said
the
meetings
were
taking
place
in
a
difficult
environment
and
that
russia
s
position
would
be
key
in
reaching
a
deal
russia
is
playing
tough
one
of
the
opec
sources
said
another
opec
source
said
the
saudis
are
working
hard
on
the
cut
but
if
russia
says
no
cut
then
we
opec
won
t
the
saudi
and
united
arab
emirates
energy
ministers
khalid
and
suhail
bin
mohammed
said
on
tuesday
that
an
adjustment
in
global
oil
output
was
required
but
all
producers
must
be
on
board
the
next
road
to
cross
is
whether
all
countries
are
willing
to
come
on
board
and
contribute
to
that
cut
falih
told
bloomberg
television
russian
sources
have
indicated
moscow
could
contribute
some
bpd
to
a
reduction
but
middle
opec
insists
russia
cut
by
bpd
two
sources
said
talks
were
focussing
on
a
cut
of
percent
from
october
output
levels
with
no
exemptions
for
any
member
sources
also
said
opec
could
delay
a
decision
to
cut
if
the
main
criteria
such
as
russia
s
involvement
were
not
met
even
though
doing
so
would
mean
a
further
fall
in
prices
opec
can
always
meet
again
in
february
for
example
and
decide
on
a
cut
then
those
who
were
not
able
or
willing
to
cooperate
will
be
wanting
to
cut
then
one
source
said
saudi
arabia
previously
insisted
on
a
need
to
reduce
production
it
was
unclear
whether
the
apparent
shift
in
position
was
caused
by
opec
using
negotiation
tactics
to
bring
russia
on
board
or
by
pressure
from
trump
to
refrain
from
cutting
output

iraq
s

minister
said
opec
must
come
up
with
a
to
strategy
to
achieve
crude
price
stability
and
minimise
damage
to
oil
markets
caused
by
geopolitics
thamer
ghadhban
said
iraq
would
work
to
help
balance
markets
and
bolster
prices

remained

an
agreement
to
cut

are
