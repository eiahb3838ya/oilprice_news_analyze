one
of
the
largest
utilities
on
tuesday
unveiled
plans
to
accelerate
its
carbon
reduction
goals
saying
sharply
lower
costs
for
renewable
energy
and
investments
in
new
technologies
will
allow
it
to
deliver
all
electricity
to
customers
by
the
company
which
currently
produces
percent
of
its
power
from
fossil
fuels
said
it
will
slash
carbon
emissions
by
percent
from
levels
by
from
a
previous
target
of
percent
before
going
to
zero
in
it
has
already
slashed
those
emissions
by
percent
the
company
s
ambitions
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
federal
government
s
agenda
under
president
donald
trump
because
they
will
likely
further
erode
flagging
demand
for
coal
the
energy
information
administration
said
on
tuesday
that
coal
demand
is
projected
to
hit
a
low
in
continuing
a
downward
trend
fueled
by
cheap
natural
gas
and
increasingly
competitive
wind
and
solar
energy
trump
has
vowed
to
revive
the
fossil
fuels
industries
by
rolling
back
environmental
protections
that
he
argues
kill
jobs
and
provide
no
tangible
benefits
xcel
s
announcement
also
coincides
with
international
climate
talks
taking
place
in
poland
to
hammer
out
the
rulebook
for
the
paris
agreement
a
global
accord
agreed
in
to
fight
climate
change
from
which
trump
has
pledged
to
withdraw
xcel
which
serves
million
customers
in
eight
midwestern
and
western
states
called
its
move
the
most
ambitious
ever
announced
in
the
electric
power
industry
in
a
statement
the
utility
said
its
goal
can
be
reached
affordably
with
renewable
energy
and
other
current
technologies
to
achieve
the
goal
of
all
electricity
however
requires
technologies
that
are
not
cost
effective
or
commercially
available
today
xcel
said
we
re
accelerating
our
carbon
reduction
goals
because
we
re
encouraged
by
advances
in
technology
motivated
by
customers
who
are
asking
for
it
and
committed
to
working
with
partners
to
make
it
happen
