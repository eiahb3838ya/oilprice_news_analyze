saudi
oil
minister
said
on
tuesday
it
was
too
soon
to
say
if
opec
and
its
allies
would
cut
production
as
the
terms
of
a
deal
remain
unresolved
bloomberg
reported
khalid
s
comments
come
as
opec
and
its
allies
are
working
towards
a
deal
this
week
to
reduce
oil
output
by
at
least
million
barrels
per
day
four
sources
told
reuters
adding
that
russia
s
resistance
to
a
major
cut
was
so
far
the
main
stumbling
block
told
bloomberg
that
he
saw
an
oversupplied
market
but
cautioned
that
all
the
members
of
the
opec
and
allies
group
needed
to
come
together
for
a
cut
to
go
ahead
