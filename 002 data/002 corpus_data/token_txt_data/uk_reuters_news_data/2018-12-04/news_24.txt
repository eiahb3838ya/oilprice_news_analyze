special report-little lab on the prairie clears path to big 'clean coal' profits
reuters
clean
coal
is
a
rich
vein
for
american
investors
to
mine
thanks
to
a
lucrative
subsidy
offered
by
the
government
for
many
producers
of
the
fuel
the
path
to
profit
leads
through
a
laboratory
at
the
university
of
north
dakota
the
school
s
energy
and
environmental
research
centre
reported
earning
about
million
in
fiscal
performing
laboratory
tests
that
qualify
producers
for
the
subsidy
on
any
given
day
eerc
technicians
take
a
sample
of
up
to
one
tonne
of
the
coal
from
a
producer
and
burn
it
in
a
miniature
boiler
to
determine
whether
it
reduces
a
specific
pollutant
enough
to
make
the
grade
a
stamp
of
approval
from
eerc
or
a
handful
of
other
labs
serving
the
industry
unlocks
a
tax
credit
worth
more
than
a
tonne
to
producers
and
their
investors
the
subsidy
enjoyed
by
more
than
operations
stretching
from
west
virginia
to
wyoming
costs
taxpayers
about
billion
annually
technically
speaking
eerc
s
services
aren
t
necessary
to
win
the
credit
producers
simply
need
to
prove
that
their
product
also
known
as
refined
coal
is
cutting
their
emissions
of
targeted
pollutants
a
percent
cut
in
nitrogen
oxide
output
plus
a
percent
reduction
in
mercury
to
do
that
they
can
submit
the
comprehensive
data
that
s
measured
at
america
s
smokestacks
in
conditions
instead
of
a
lab
and
reported
regularly
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
but
almost
all
investors
choose
instead
to
pay
laboratories
like
eerc
for
testing
that
lasts
one
day
according
to
industry
executives
and
disclosures
by
refined
coal
producers
to
environmental
regulators
the
reason
the
lab
results
almost
always
show
a
bigger
cut
in
pollution
than
the
data
and
the
reductions
demonstrated
in
the
labs
often
do
not
translate
to
actual
pollution
reductions
at
power
plants
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
epa
data
interviews
with
utility
executives
and
disclosures
by
power
plants
the
testing
regimen
casts
doubt
on
whether
the
subsidy
works
as
intended
said
ron
sahu
an
environmental
engineer
who
has
consulted
with
utilities
the
epa
and
the
justice
department
on
power
plant
emissions
that
s
a
huge
leap
to
give
a
tax
credit
based
on
results
from
a
highly
idealized
lab
test
he
said
john
harju
the
eerc
s
vice
president
of
strategic
partnerships
said
the
tests
are
valid
and
objective
measures
of
performance
we
do
the
tests
and
the
results
are
what
they
are
he
said
refined
coal
appears
effective
in
reducing
mercury
emissions
at
actual
power
plants
but
it
shows
little
sign
of
reducing
emissions
of
nitrogen
oxide
or
nox
a
key
element
in
creating
smog
and
acid
rain
and
a
primary
target
of
the
subsidy
programme
according
to
a
reuters
analysis
of
epa
data
interviews
with
industry
officials
and
regulatory
disclosures
between
before
utilities
began
burning
refined
coal
and
the
last
year
for
which
data
is
available
nox
pollution
rates
declined
percent
among
power
plants
burning
refined
coal
compared
to
percent
at
plants
burning
raw
coal
according
to
the
reuters
analysis
of
epa
emissions
data
over
the
same
period
of
the
utilities
that
burnt
refined
coal
actually
recorded
higher
nox
emissions
rates
only
of
them
recorded
a
cut
of
percent
or
more
it
s
one
of
those
things
that
should
come
with
a
label
that
says
mileage
may
vary
in
the
field
said
martin
hopper
general
manager
of
the
msr
public
power
agency
in
modesto
california
which
new
mexico
s
san
juan
generating
station
the
internal
revenue
service
which
administers
the
tax
credit
programme
agreed
to
accept
lab
results
from
subsidy
applicants
a
decade
ago
that
move
came
after
investors
argued
to
treasury
and
irs
officials
in
that
tests
make
it
easier
to
isolate
how
refined
coal
performs
eliminating
complicating
factors
at
play
in
a
boiler
according
to
david
lowman
a
partner
at
law
firm
hunton
andrews
kurth
llp
who
represented
the
industry
in
the
negotiations
the
irs
declined
to
comment
on
its
decision
when
issuing
guidance
the
irs
and
treasury
invite
comments
concerning
our
requirements
and
based
on
this
updates
can
be
made
to
better
administer
the
law
the
tax
agency
said
in
a
statement
failing
tests
over
the
past
decade
the
irs
has
handed
out
billions
of
dollars
of
refined
coal
subsidies
to
companies
on
the
basis
of
test
results
that
show
they
are
producing
a
form
of
coal
the
lab
tests
often
don
t
reflect
the
reality
at
power
plants
that
s
because
plants
generally
do
not
operate
under
optimal
conditions
for
reducing
nox
while
burning
refined
coal
according
utility
officials
and
power
plant
disclosures
to
environmental
regulators
a
typical
power
plant
s
nox
emission
rate
often
fluctuates
as
operators
adjust
the
flow
of
air
to
the
combustion
chamber
and
other
equipment
to
meet
demands
on
the
facility
to
produce
electricity
coal
that
burns
hot
and
fast
during
air
flow
for
example
a
setting
used
when
demand
surges
will
produce
more
nox
pollution
than
coal
burning
at
lower
temperatures
with
lower
air
flow
in
the
irs
said
it
altered
its
testing
requirements
in
a
way
that
allowed
labs
to
use
different
air
control
settings
in
the
two
different
tests
needed
to
compare
refined
coal
to
raw
coal
according
to
a
january
article
by
two
ernst
young
executives
in
the
tax
adviser
magazine
although
the
agency
s
reasoning
for
the
change
was
unclear
the
article
said
the
practical
effect
would
be
to
make
the
tests
easier
to
pass
the
irs
and
eerc
declined
to
comment
on
the
policy
change
the
eerc
said
in
a
statement
to
reuters
that
it
has
used
substantially
reduced
airflows
while
burning
refined
coal
resulting
in
lower
nox
emissions
for
the
same
energy
output
the
price
of
emissions
credits
under
the
cap
and
trade
programme
can
also
influence
a
power
plant
s
rate
of
pollution
coal
plants
that
purchase
the
credits
are
allowed
to
emit
more
pollution
and
in
recent
years
it
has
been
cheaper
to
buy
credits
than
to
run
equipment
at
peak
effectiveness
as
a
result
a
plant
burning
refined
coal
can
see
its
nox
levels
spike
if
pollution
controls
are
turned
down
or
off
regardless
of
the
type
of
coal
it
burns
epa
data
shows
refined
coal
is
just
one
of
many
factors
that
influence
nox
levels
said
erin
culbert
a
spokeswoman
for
duke
energy
the
largest
utility
and
when
utilities
decide
to
burn
refined
coal
tax
credit
investors
often
wall
street
firms
have
no
control
over
how
utility
owners
run
their
coal
plants
several
utilities
have
told
environmental
regulators
that
they
tried
to
demonstrate
pollution
reductions
big
enough
to
qualify
for
the
subsidy
at
actual
plants
but
failed
according
to
their
disclosures
during
a
trial
run
using
refined
coal
at
the
stanton
energy
centre
in
orlando
florida
in
nox
emission
rates
increased
by
percent
compared
to
raw
coal
instead
of
declining
two
other
trial
runs
at
stanton
that
year
proved
inconclusive
according
to
a
copy
of
the
results
viewed
by
reuters
the
plant
ultimately
decided
not
to
burn
refined
coal
according
to
regulatory
filings
stanton
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
coal
plants
achieve
most
of
their
reduction
in
smog
pollution
through
investments
in
other
technology
including
equipment
that
works
like
the
catalytic
converter
in
a
car
or
truck
to
convert
nox
into
benign
nitrogen
and
water
or
they
cut
pollutants
by
simply
switching
from
coal
to
cleaner
natural
gas
or
by
using
a
mix
of
both
fuels
the
brunner
island
power
plant
in
pennsylvania
for
example
reduced
its
nox
emission
rate
by
percent
in
compared
to

to

said
todd
martin

some

win
the

it
was
not
confident
that

ameren
said
it
uses
a
number
of
different
strategies
to
reduce

at
its

those

have
resulted
in

whelan

mainly
as

to

he

the

is
a
much
safer
bet
for

to
qualify
for
the

it
s

murray
said
plants
usually
can
t
reproduce
the

his

achieve
in

because

typically
run
their

with

it
