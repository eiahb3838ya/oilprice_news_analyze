gulf
if
washington
presses
ahead
with
efforts
to
halt
iranian
oil
exports
the
united
states
has
imposed
sanctions
on
iran
and
officials
say
they
aim
to
reduce
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
in
a
bid
to
curb
the
islamic
republic
s
missile
program
and
regional
influence
america
should
know
that
we
are
selling
our
oil
and
will
continue
to
sell
our
oil
and
they
are
not
able
to
stop
our
oil
exports
rouhani
said
in
a
televised
speech
during
a
trip
to
the
northern
iranian
city
of
shahroud
if
one
day
they
want
to
prevent
the
export
of
iran
s
oil
then
no
oil
will
be
exported
from
the
persian
gulf
he
said
rouhani
made
similar
comments
in
july
also
in

an
iranian
revolutionary
guards
commander
ismail
kowsari
was
quoted
as
saying
that
tehran
would
block
oil
shipments
through
the
strait
of
hormuz
lf
the
united
states
banned
iranian
oil
sales
tensions
have
risen
between
iran
and
the
united
states
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
a
multilateral
nuclear
deal
in
may
and
reimposed
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
rouhani
said
the
united
states
would
not
succeed
in
cutting
iran
s
economic
ties
with
the
region
and
the
world
the
most
hostile
group
in
america
with
relation
to
iran
has
taken
power
rouhani
said
according
to
the
islamic
republic
news
agency
irna
of
course
they
never
had
a
friendship
with
the
people
of
iran
and
we
never
trusted
america
or
others
earlier
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
denied
a
reuters
report
that
said
a
european
mechanism
to
set
up
an
account
to
trade
with
iran
and
beat
the
newly
reimposed
sanctions
may
not
cover
oil
sales
the
iranian
foreign
ministry
website
reported
based
on
the
information
we
have
it
s
not
so
because
if
iran
s
oil
money
is
not
deposited
into
the
account
it
s
not
clear
that
there
would
be
any
funds
for
trade
because
oil
is
a
major
part
of
iran
s
exports
zarif
said
according
to
the
website
this
appears
to
be
propaganda
aimed
at
discouraging
people
zarif
added
france
and
germany
are
to
take
joint
responsibility
for
the
trade
mechanism
reuters
reported
but
the
agency
quoted
diplomats
as
saying
that
with
threats
of
retribution
for
unrelenting
the
goals
of
the
nascent
trade
mechanism
could
be
scaled
back
to
encompass
only
less
sensitive
items
such
as
humanitarian
and
food
products
iranian
vice
president
eshaq
jahangiri
said
on
tuesday
that
sanctions
were
hitting
vulnerable
people
in
iran
when
americans
say
their
target
is
the
iranian
government
and
there
won
t
be
pressure
on
the
sick
the
elderly
and
the
weak
in
society
it
s
a
lie
