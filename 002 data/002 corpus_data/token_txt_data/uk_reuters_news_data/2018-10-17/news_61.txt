australian government braces for voter anger in make-or-break by-election
sydney
reuters
australian
prime
minister
scott
morrison
could
face
a
backlash
in
a
this
weekend
as
voters
in
a
seat
weigh
whether
to
strip
the
conservative
government
of
its
parliamentary
majority
the
saturday
in
sydney
s
diverse
affluent
wentworth
constituency
is
the
first
major
test
of
morrison
s
standing
with
voters
many
of
whom
are
angry
over
the
ousting
of
former
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
in
august
following
a
backbench
revolt
wentworth
was
turnbull
s
seat
he
quit
politics
days
after
his
removal
if
the
government
were
to
lose
the
seat
morrison
would
have
to
try
to
strike
a
deal
with
a
handful
of
independents
to
govern
with
a
minority
or
be
forced
into
an
early
general
election
morrison
s
liberal
party
won
the
seat
by
a
percent
margin
in
the
last
election
in
but
polls
indicate
it
will
be
a
tight
race
there
are
plenty
of
angry
voters
and
there
will
be
a
significant
protest
vote
over
the
treatment
of
turnbull
and
the
government
s
climate
polices
which
is
the
dominant
issue
john
hewson
a
former
leader
of
the
liberal
party
and
a
former
mp
for
wentworth
told
reuters
it
really
is
a
australians
mark
their
ballot
papers
in
order
of
their
candidate
preference
if
no
candidate
wins
percent
of
the
vote
the
candidate
with
the
fewest
votes
is
eliminated
and
their
votes
given
to
the
second
preference
candidate
this
continues
until
one
candidate
wins
with
the
too
close
to
call
morrison
on
tuesday
moved
to
win
favour
with
the
electorate
s
large
jewish
community
by
announcing
he
was
considering
moving
australia
s
embassy
in
israel
from
tel
aviv
to
jerusalem
according
to
census
data
percent
of
wentworth
s
electorate
is
jewish
and
morrison
said
the
idea
had
been
advanced
by
dave
sharma
a
former
australian
ambassador
to
israel
and
now
liberal
party
candidate
for
wentworth
sharma
denied
that
the
proposal
to
move
the
embassy
was
related
to
the
he
also
said
he
strongly
supported
the
emergence
of
an
independent
sovereign
palestinian
state
living
alongside
israel
in
peace
stretching
from
bondi
beach
to
sydney
s
harbour
the
liberal
party
s
economic
credentials
have
traditionally
been
the
dominant
lure
for
most
voters
while
the
scores
of
ocean
view
mansions
provide
evidence
of
the
electorate
s
wealth
it
also
belies
wentworth
s
progressive
voter
base
more
than
percent
of
the
electorate
voted
for
marriage
last
year
well
ahead
of
the
national
average
while
many
in
the
area
also
want
to
reject
fossil
fuels
in
favour
of
renewable
energy
while
nearly
of
voters
backed
turnbull
in
this
time
wentworth
looks
set
to
be
a
referendum
on
morrison
a
staunch
conservative
and
supporter
of
the
coal
industry
should
voters
reject
the
government
morrison
will
be
left
with
a
choice
of
either
trying
to
form
a
minority
government
or
calling
an
early
election
while
trailing
in
the
polls
bob
katter
one
of
two
former
ruling
party
members
who
are
now
independents
in
parliament
who
the
government
will
mostly
likely
have
to
rely
on
to
get
any
legislation
through
warned
he
would
exact
a
high
price
for
his
support
it
s
not
for
me
to
call
it
a
threat
but
when
i
don
t
get
a
fair
go
then
it
is
mayhem
time
said
katter
who
declined
to
specify
what
exactly
he
would
demand
