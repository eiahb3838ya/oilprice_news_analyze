stockholm
oct
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
said
on
wednesday
it
has
been
in
talks
with
volvo
over
the
last
few
weeks
about
an
issue
with
their
catalytic
converters
that
was
causing
some
vehicles
to
exceed
nitrogen
oxide
emission
limits
volvo
warned
a
day
earlier
that
some
of
its
truck
and
bus
engines
could
be
exceeding
limits
for
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
as
an
emissions
control
component
it
uses
was
degrading
more
quickly
than
expected
the
swedish
truckmaker
said
it
could
face
material
costs
to
deal
with
the
issue
largely
affecting
trucks
and
buses
sold
in
north
america
and
europe
its
two
largest
markets
and
that
it
was
working
with
authorities
to
find
a
solution
a
spokesperson
for
the
epa
told
reuters
via
email
on
wednesday
that
the
body
was
aware
of
the
situation
which
it
said
involved
volvo
heavy
duty
trucks
over
the
last
few
weeks
epa
and
the
california
air
resources
board
have
been
communicating
with
volvo
about
the
problem
and
are
now
continuing
to
meet
with
the
company
to
develop
plans
to
quickly
address
this
asked
why
volvo
had
waited
a
couple
of
weeks
before
informing
the
market
a
volvo
spokesman
said
the
company
needed
to
see
whether
this
would
be
a
large
issue
and
it
was
standard
protocol
to
inform
authorities
first
authorities
and
legal
bodies
are
normally
informed
prior
to
the
markets
because
we
inform
them
even
if
the
problem
is
very
very
small
he
said
volvo
has
not
detailed
when
the
affected
trucks
were
sold
or
how
many
trucks
are
impacted
but
has
said
only
that
all
products
equipped
with
the
component
met
emissions
limits
at
delivery
the
company
sold
trucks
in
north
america
last
year
and
another
in
europe
epa
and
carb
declined
to
comment
when
asked
how
many
trucks
were
involved
while
a
spokesman
for
volvo
said
it
was
too
early
to
know
we
are
working
with
the
company
to
more
fully
understand
what
s
going
on
a
spokesman
for
carb
said
in
a
brief
separate
comment
without
giving
more
details
