saudi
arabia
is
unlikely
to
employ
its
oil
weapon
in
the
diplomatic
crisis
over
the
disappearance
of
a

after
visiting
the
country
s
consulate
in
istanbul
experience
from
the
last
time
saudi
arabia
tried
to
use
oil
sales
as
a
diplomatic
instrument
in
shows
such
action
does
not
work
and
the
kingdom
itself
would
be
the
biggest
victim
despite
some
of
the
impassioned
rhetoric
in
saudi
media
makes
it
improbable
the
government
will
retaliate
by
reducing
oil
sales
or
trying
to
drive
up
prices
that
has
not
stopped
some
veiled
threats
to
weaponise
oil
production
and
prices
but
they
should
be
interpreted
as
an
urgent
plea
for
support
and
understanding
rather
than
a
serious
threat
if
sanctions
are
imposed
on
saudi
arabia
we
will
be
facing
an
economic
disaster
that
would
rock
the
entire
world
according
to
one
heated
editorial
sanctions
would
mean
washington
is
stabbing
itself
al
arabiya
riyadh
is
the
capital
of
global
oil
and
touching
this
would
affect
oil
production
before
any
other
vital
commodity
the
editorial
warned
if
the
price
of
oil
reaching
a
barrel
angered
president
donald
trump
no
one
should
rule
out
the
price
jumping
to
or
or
even
double
that
figure
the
author
said
bluntly
the
government
s
official
response
has
been
more
circumspect
but
it
nonetheless
warned
that
it
would
respond
to
any
action
with
even
greater
retaliation
and
pointed
to
the
kingdom
s
influential
and
vital
role
in
the
global
economy
in
october
saudi
arabia
and
the
other
arab
oil
producers
announced
that
they
would
start
cutting
production
by
percent
per
month
until
israeli
forces
evacuated
from
occupied
arab
territories
in
addition
saudi
arabia
and
the
other
arab
producers
announced
an
embargo
on
oil
sales
to
the
united
states
and
a
number
of
other
countries
opec
years
of
prices
and
politics
skeet
global
oil
supplies
had
already
become
tight
even
before
the
decisions
to
cut
production
and
embargo
the
united
states
mostly
as
a
result
of
low
real
prices
during
the
and
spare
production
capacity
in
the
united
states
which
had
been
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
in
had
been
used
up
by
march
in
this
context
the
production
cuts
and
embargo
made
an
already
tight
market
worse
sent
oil
prices
surging
and
produced
a
huge
revenue
windfall
for
saudi
arabia
and
other
oil
producers
but
the
policy
was
a
failure
in
its
own
terms
was
reversed
a
few
months
later
and
caused
immense
damage
to
saudi
arabia
and
opec
that
took
decades
to
reverse
at
the
most
basic
level
the
policy
failed
to
achieve
its
stated
objective
of
changing
support
for
israel
or
forcing
israel
to
withdraw
from
the
occupied
palestinian
territories
more
seriously
for
saudi
arabia
and
other
arab
oil
producers
the
surge
in
prices
which
rose
again
after
the
iranian
revolution
in
resulted
in
permanent
demand
destruction
and
encouragement
of
alternative
suppliers
rising
prices
helped
spur
the
development
of
new
supplies
in
alaska
the
north
sea
the
soviet
union
and
china
which
came
onstream
and
flooded
the
oil
market
in
the
rising
prices
also
encouraged
a
wholesale
switch
away
from
the
use
of
crude
oil
and
heavy
fuel
oil
in
residential
and
commercial
heating
boilers
as
well
as
in
power
generation
homes
and
offices
in
the
united
states
and
many
other
advanced
economies
switched
from
heavy
fuel
oil
to
cheaper
and
more
reliable

or
electricity

from

were
replaced
by
a
new
generation
of

in

in
the
late
and
the
ironically
the
same
coal
plants
that
are
now
being
closed
and
replaced
by
natural
gas
the
oil
shock
also
provided
the
impetus
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
nuclear
power
plants
in
the
united
states
france
japan
britain
and
other
countries
to
reduce
the
reliance
on
imported
crude
cheap
oil
had
been
on
the
way
to
becoming
the
dominant
fuel
for
power
generation
in
the
and
putting
the
coal
industry
under
pressure
by
the
late
however
expensive
and
unreliable
oil
had
been
largely
pushed
out
of
the
power
sector
by
cheaper
and
more
secure
coal
gas
and
nuclear
a
permanent
loss
of
markets
from
which
it
has
never
recovered
policymakers
in
the
united
states
europe
and
japan
also
enacted
new
standards
for
motor
vehicles
to
reduce
reliance
on
imports
for
the
transport
sector
taking
another
enduring
bite
out
of
demand
in
the
long
term
the
oil
embargo
created
the
conditions
for
the
oil
price
slump
that
hit
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
in
the
and
and
from
which
they
did
not
recover
until
the
the
oil
weapon
does
not
work
which
is
why
saudi
arabia
is
unlikely
to
employ
it
in
the
dispute
over
the
disappearance
of

journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
short
term
saudi
arabia
might
gain
more
revenue
from
a
rise
in
prices
than
it
lost
from
a
reduction
in
sales
but
rising
prices
would
hit
the
global
economy
and
consumption
hard
and
threaten
a
renewed
oil
market
slump
within
a
year
the
weapon
can
not
be
wielded
in
a
targeted
way
against
specific
consuming
countries
because
the
oil
market
is
global
and
fully
integrated
restricting
supplies
to
punish
some
countries
pushes
up
oil
prices
for
all
consumers
wielding
the
oil
weapon
to
pressure
the
united
states
would
impose
bigger
costs
on
china
and
india
which
are
the
largest
and
oil
importers
and
crucial
markets
for
the
future
saudi
arabia
has
spent
decades
marketing
itself
as
a
reliable
oil
supplier
especially
to
customers
in
asia
and
any
attempt
to
employ
the
oil
weapon
would
destroy
that
carefully
crafted
reputation
saudi
arabia
s
refining
customers
would
instead
turn
to
iran
russia
and
the
united
states
for
additional
supplies
and
likely
reconsider
their
dependence
on
the
kingdom
if
saudi
arabia
nonetheless
attempted
to
weaponise
oil
production
and
sales
the
resulting
surge
in
prices
would
prompt
another
round
of
conservation
measures
cutting
demand
for
its
main
product
sharp
rises
in
oil
prices
would
put
a
renewed
focus
on
vehicle
fuel
economy
standards
as
well
as
accelerating
the
deployment
of
electric
vehicles
rising
prices
and
concerns
about
unreliable
supplies
would
speed
the
diffusion
of
electric
vehicles
and
push
oil
out
of
the
transport
market
just
as
it
was
pushed
out
of
heating
and
power
generation
in
the
saudi
arabia
has
spent
years
urging
countries
to
remember
it
needs
security
of
demand
just
as
much
as
they
need
security
of
supply
but
weaponising
oil
production
would
break
that
understanding
and
provoke
a
backlash
from
consuming
countries
with
a
concerted
effort
to
reduce
their
oil
imports
finally
saudi
arabia
relies
heavily
on
the
united
states
for
security
including
the
provision
of
advanced
weapons
systems
training
intelligence
and
thousands
of
personnel
and
aircraft
stationed
in
and
around
the
gulf
there
is
no
way
to
wield
the
oil
weapon
which
would
not
shake
the
foundations
of
the
alliance
on
which
the
kingdom
s
defence
depends
leaving
it
vulnerable
to
regional
rivals
including
iran
for
all
these
reasons
the
oil
weapon
is
essentially
useless
an
unreliable
blunderbuss
more
likely
to
blow
up
the
user
than
its
intended
target
which
is
why
saudi
arabia
is
unlikely
to
deploy
it
