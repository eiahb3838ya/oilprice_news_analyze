u.s. eyes more venezuelan sanctions, but oil on backburner -u.s. official
washington
reuters
the
united
states
plans
to
turn
up
sanctions
pressure
on
venezuela
but
sees
less
need
to
immediately
target
its
energy
sector
given
sagging
production
from
the
opec
member
s
oil
company
a
senior
administration
official
said
on
wednesday
the
government
has
imposed
several
rounds
of
sanctions
on
venezuelan
military
and
political
figures
close
to
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
who
it
blames
for
trampling
on
human
rights
and
triggering
the
country
s
economic
collapse
earlier
this
year
the
trump
administration
had
weighed
escalating
sanctions
by
targeting
a
venezuelan
oil
services
company
or
restricting
insurance
coverage
for
oil
shipments
the
actions
would
have
built
upon
last
year
s
ban
for
banks
from
any
new
debt
deals
with
venezuelan
authorities
or
oil
giant
pdvsa
asked
by
reporters
whether
the
government
had
slowed
down
on
its
push
for
sectoral
sanctions
the
senior
official
described
them
as
some
of
the
many
tools
it
is
keeping
in
reserve
with
regards
to
venezuela
all
options
are
on
the
table
said
the
official
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
fact
is
that
the
greatest
sanction
on
venezuelan
oil
and
oil
production
is
called
nicolas
maduro
and
pdvsa
s
inefficiencies
the
official
said
venezuela
s
crude
oil
production
hit
a
low
in
a
slump
blamed
on
poor
management
and
corruption
at
the
end
of
the
day
nicolas
maduro
has
taken
care
of
really
running
pdvsa
to
the
ground
and
essentially
more
and
more
making
it
a
he
said
almost
million
venezuelans
have
fled
since
driven
out
by
food
and
medicine
shortages
hyperinflation
and
violent
crime
the
exodus
has
overwhelmed
neighboring
countries
maduro
who
denies
limiting
political
freedoms
has
said
he
is
the
victim
of
an
economic
war
led
by
adversaries
the
trump
administration
also
plans
to
ramp
up
economic
pressure
on
cuba
s
military
and
intelligence
services
the
official
said
in
his
speech
last
month
to
the
united
nations
president
donald
trump
linked
venezuela
s
crises
to
its
cuban
that
is
a
message
that
we
will
continue
to
put
out
but
frankly
its
a
message
that
the
region
needs
to
talk
about
the
official
said
noting
john
bolton
trump
s
national
security
adviser
is
expected
to
elaborate
on
the
issue
publicly
soon
the
issue
of
cuban
involvement
in
venezuela
is
a
fact
it
s
not
a
theory
it
s
not
a
story
