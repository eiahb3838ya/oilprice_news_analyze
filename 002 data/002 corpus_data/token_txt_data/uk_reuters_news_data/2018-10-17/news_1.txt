even
as

the

earlier
in

lawmakers
pointed
the

leadership
suggesting

could
be
possible

president
donald
trump
s
comments
suggested
that

trump
denied

such
a
move
would
roil

as
the
saudis
have
not
used
oil
as
a
policy
weapon
since
the
oil
embargo
of
the
early

is
already
anticipating
reduced
supply
