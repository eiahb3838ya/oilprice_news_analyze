the

of
and
are
now
mainly
remembered
for
the
disruption
and
hardship
they
caused
in
the
major
countries
but
they
marked
a
lasting
inflection
point
in
the
development
of
the
oil
market
and
almost
all
the
changes
were
adverse
to
opec
in
the
long
run
following
the
oil

global

members
of

exporting
countries
initially
benefited
from
a
gusher
of
windfall
revenues
but
in
the
long
term
the
oil
shocks
were
disastrous
opec
s
market
share
fell
and
its
members
were
left
with
excess
production
capacity
that
remained
a
problem
until
the
opec
s
responsibility
for
the
shocks
remains
debatable
the
market
was
on
an
unsustainable
trajectory
before
as
low
prices
boosted
consumption
without
encouraging
a
similar
increase
in
output

the
events
of

clearly
why
oil
can
not
be
employed
as
a
weapon

doing
damage

the

countries
opec
members
have
never
again
resorted
to
the
oil
weapon
not
out
of
goodwill
to
consumers
but
because
it
did
not
work
and
did
harm
to
their
own
economies
more
generally
the
oil
shocks
demonstrate
why
very
high
prices
are
damaging
to
the
interests
of
opec

a
lesson
that
was
painfully
when

petroleum

the

towards

evident
across

slowdown
in

after
