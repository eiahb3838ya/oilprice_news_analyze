washington
reuters
greenhouse
gases
emissions
from
the
largest
industrial
plants
fell
percent
in
the
trump
administration
said
as
coal
plants
shut
and
as
that
industry
competes
with
cheap
natural
gas
and
solar
and
wind
power
that
emit
less
pollution
the
drop
was
steeper
than
in
when
emissions
fell
percent
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
said
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
the
data
proves
that
federal
regulations
are
not
necessary
to
drive
carbon
dioxide
reductions
thanks
to
president
trump
s
regulatory
reform
agenda
the
economy
is
booming
energy
production
is
surging
and
we
are
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
major
industrial
sources
wheeler
said
in
a
release
while
wheeler
gave
the
administration
credit
for
the
reductions
which
mainly
came
from
the
power
sector
the
numbers
also
underscore
that
the
administration
has
not
been
able
to
stop
the
rapid
pace
of
coal
plant
shutdowns
voters
in
states
that
produce
and
burn
coal
form
a
large
part
of
president
donald
trump
s
base
but
the
administration
has
not
been
able
to
forge
a
path
for
subsidizing
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
despite
industrial
players
urging
the
administration
to
act
trump
has
said
that
the
climate
is
changing
but
he
does
not
know
the
extent
to
which
humans
are
causing
it
and
last
year
he
announced
his
intention
to
pull
the
country
out
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
natural
gas
releases
far
less
carbon
dioxide
when
burned
than
coal
and
a
domestic
abundance
of
gas
has
driven
a
wave
of
closures
of
coal
plants
in
utilities
shut
or
converted
from
nearly
megawatts
mw
of
coal
plants
energy
secretary
rick
perry
submitted
a
plan
months
ago
to
the
white
house
to
subsidize
the
plants
using
tools
that
would
support
industry
when
national
security
is
at
risk
perry
told
reporters
in
late
september
that
his
agency
s
ideas
were
still
being
bandied
about
at
the
white
house
a
report
in
politico
this
week
said
that
white
house
officials
have
put
the
plan
on
the
shelf
over
questions
over
who
would
pay
for
the
subsidies
a
coalition
of
natural
gas
drillers
consumer
advocates
some
grid
operators
and
renewable
power
interests
have
opposed
subsidizing
aging
coal
and
nuclear
plants
the
trend
of
coal
plant
shutdowns
is
expected
to
pick
up
this
year
with
power
companies
expecting
to
shut
mw
of
coal

in
