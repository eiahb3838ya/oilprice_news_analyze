update 3-nigerian politician ibori loses appeal against uk graft conviction
london
reuters
a
nigerian
politician
who
was
jailed
in
britain
for
laundering
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
in
stolen
public
funds
through
british
banks
and
properties
lost
an
appeal
against
his
conviction
in
london
on
wednesday
the
court
of
appeal
s
ruling
against
james
ibori
a
former
governor
of
delta
state
in
southern
nigeria
is
a
relief
for
the
british
authorities
at
a
time
when
they
are
trying
to
stem
the
flow
of
dirty
money
from
overseas
through
london
ibori
who
in
his
heyday
was
one
of
nigeria
s
richest
and
most
powerful
men
pleaded
guilty
in
a
london
court
in
to
counts
of
fraud
and
involving
sums
amounting
to
at
least
million
pounds
million
he
received
a
jail
sentence
of
which
he
served
half
as
is
common
in
the
british
system
and
is
now
back
in
nigeria
campaigners
had
hailed
the
case
as
a
milestone
for
nigeria
where
no
one
of
his
stature
had
been
successfully
prosecuted
and
for
its
former
colonial
ruler
britain
long
seen
as
too
complacent
about
the
proceeds
of
nigerian
corruption
being
laundered
in
the
uk
ibori
owned
homes
in
britain
south
africa
and
united
states
including
an
english
country
house
near
the
private
school
where
his
children
were
being
educated
he
also
owned
a
jaguar
and
a
bentley
and
was
buying
a
private
jet
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
this
contrasted
sharply
with
the
situation
in
delta
state
a
maze
of
mangrove
creeks
by
pipelines
and
plagued
by
violent
conflict
over
access
to
oil
money
where
most
people
make
do
without
electricity
or
clean
water
wednesday
s
ruling
will
allow
britain
to
resume
efforts
to
confiscate
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
assets
and
return
them
to
nigerian
public
coffers
the
assets
have
been
frozen
for
years
while
the
case
has
been
dragging
through
the
courts
despite
his
guilty
pleas
ibori
appealed
against
his
conviction
alleging
that
one
of
the
british
police
officers
who
investigated
him
had
taken
bribes
from
a
private
detective
in
return
for
inside
tips
about
the
probe
the
officer
denies
this
ibori
also
alleged
that
british
prosecutors
had
covered
up
the
corruption
tainting
the
judicial
process
these
allegations
had
threatened
to
turn
the
case
into
a
major
embarrassment
for
britain
but
three
senior
appeal
judges
said
the
bribery
was
not
proven
and
if
it
had
happened
ibori
himself
had
instigated
it
as
the
private
detective
was
working
for
him
as
ibori
was
instrumental
in
the
officer
s
corruption
if
corruption
there
was
he
can
not
even
arguably
rely
upon
it
to
escape
his
convictions
the
ruling
said
britain
is
currently
trying
to
crack
down
on
by
people
involved
in
corrupt
politics
or
business
abroad
police
say
about
billion
pounds
of
dirty
cash
moves
through
or
into
britain
each
year
the
ibori
case
which
the
current
crackdown
by
over
a
decade
relied
on
evidence
obtained
in
britain
and
nigeria
during
several
years
of
close
cooperation
between
the
british
police
and
nigeria
s
own
force
ibori
has
now
resumed
political
activities
in
delta
state
he
says
he
has
no
faith
in
british
justice
and
that
the
case
against
him
is
politically
motivated
