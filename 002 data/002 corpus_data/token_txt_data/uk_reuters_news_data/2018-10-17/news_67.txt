exclusive-don't mention the oil price: us legal threat prompts change at opec
reuters
opec
has
urged
its
members
not
to
mention
oil
prices
when
discussing
policy
in
a
break
from
the
past
as
the
oil
producing
group
seeks
to
avoid
the
risk
of
legal
action
for
manipulating
the
market
sources
close
to
opec
said
proposed
legislation
known
as
nopec
which
could
open
the
group
up
to
lawsuits
has
long
lain
dormant
with
previous
american
presidents
signaling
that
they
would
veto
any
move
to
make
it
law
but
president
donald
trump
has
been
a
vocal
critic
of
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
blaming
it
for
high
oil
prices
and
urging
it
to
increase
output
to
relieve
pressure
on
a
market
hovering
around
highs
that
has
made
opec
and
its
unofficial
leader
saudi
arabia
nervous
about
what
it
might
mean
for
nopec
or
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
the
decision
to
refrain
from
discussing
a
preferred
oil
price
level
one
way
the
group
can
guide
market
expectations
underlines
how
trump
s
aggressive
stance
on
the
oil
market
is
unsettling
opec
and
testing
ties
between
allies
riyadh
and
washington
in
july
senior
opec
officials
attended
a
workshop
in
vienna
with
international
law
firm
white
case
to
discuss
the
nopec
bill
and
the
lawyers
advised
avoiding
public
discussion
of
oil
prices
and
rather
talk
about
the
stability
of
the
oil
market
two
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
opec
officials
were
also
advised
to
explore
diplomatic
lobbying
channels
to
try
and
prevent
the
nopec
bill
from
becoming
law
one
of
the
sources
said
on
the
opec
secretariat
sent
a
letter
to
the
ministers
making
a
similar
recommendation
we
solemnly
believe
that
market
stability
and
not
prices
is
the
common
objective
of
our
actions
uae
energy
minister
suhail
who
holds
the
rotating
opec
presidency
this
year
wrote
in
the
letter
seen
by
reuters
i
would
like
to
call
upon
opec
member
countries
as
well
as
our
participating
colleagues
to
refrain
from
any
reference
to
prices
in
their
commentary
about
our
collective
efforts
or
oil
market
condition
he
added
white
case
did
not
respond
to
a
reuters
request
for
comment
specifying
oil
prices
is
not
the
only
way
opec
tries
to
guide
the
market
by
cutting
production
it
can
support
prices
and
by
raising
supplies
it
can
do
the
opposite
for
example
but
the
private
coordination
of
how
to
communicate
opec
s
message
to
the
market
represents
a
departure
from
past
practice
when
saudi
arabia
would
often
signal
a
preferred
price
level
when
speaking
about
opec
policy
and
seek
to
push
through
actions
to
achieve
that
while
chances
of
the
law
passing
this
year
appear
slim
concerns
among
opec
members
and
other
oil
producers
are
growing
that
it
may
ultimately
get
the
support
of
trump
given
his
open
criticism
of
opec
and
high
oil
prices
the
opec
letter
came
two
months
before
relations
were
further
strained
when
a
saudi
journalist
disappeared
during
a
visit
to
the
kingdom
s
consulate
in
istanbul
turkish
officials
say
they
believe
jamal
khashoggi
a
critic
of
saudi
policies
was
murdered
and
his
body
removed
saudi
arabia
has
strongly
denied
killing
khashoggi
some
members
of
the
congress
which
has
long
had
a
testy
relationship
with
saudi
arabia
have
criticized
the
kingdom
over
the
case
a
senate
source
familiar
with
the
bill
said
renewed
interest
in
nopec
was
likely
as
lawmakers
weigh
any
actions
in
response
to
khashoggi
s
disappearance
the
source
who
declined
to
be
named
said
that
with
lawmakers
out
of
town
for
the
next
several
weeks
it
was
difficult
to
measure
current
sentiment
over
much
of
the
last
year
saudi
arabia
irked
washington
by
pushing
opec
to
adopt
measures
to
boost
oil
prices
in
a
shift
from
its
previous
more
moderate
stance
industry
sources
have
linked
that
shift
to
a
desire
to
maximize
revenues
and
raise
the
valuation
of
state
energy
giant
saudi
aramco
ahead
of
a
planned
ipo
a
key
part
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
s
reforms
aimed
at
diversifying
the
economy
the
share
float
expected
by
some
to
be
worth
up
to
billion
has
been
put
on
hold
sources
have
told
reuters
prince
mohammed
said
this
month
the
float
was
postponed
to
and
several
industry
sources
say
the
delay
was
partly
because
of
litigation
risks
if
aramco
was
listed
in
new
york
a
preferred
venue
by
the
saudi
crown
prince
there
is
a
major
fear
nopec
could
turn
into
another
jasta
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
aramco
ipo
preparations
said
referring
to
the
justice
against
sponsors
of
terrorism
act
which
allows
victims
of
the
attacks
to
sue
riyadh
saudi
arabia
which
denies
involvement
in
the
attacks
had
long
had
broad
immunity
from
the
lawsuits
that
changed
in
when
the
congress
overrode
barack
obama
s
veto
of
jasta
with
close
to
trillion
in
investments
in
the
united
states
including
assets
owned
by
aramco
riyadh
has
a
lot
to
lose
if
the
nopec
bill
was
passed
into
law
it
would
revoke
the
sovereign
immunity
which
oil
producers
including
opec
members
currently
enjoy
from
legal
action
legal
firm
gibson
dunn
and
the
saudi
embassy
there
signed
a
contract
in
late
august
according
to
a
copy
of
the
contract
filed
to
the
department
of
justice
the
contract
outlines
that
among
its
other
responsibilities
gibson
dunn
would
be
opposing

saudi

also
raised
concerns
over
nopec
with
senior
