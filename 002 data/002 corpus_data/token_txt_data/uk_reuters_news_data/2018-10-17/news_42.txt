weakness
in
completing
wells
is
worrisome
because
such
services
have
carried
the
day
for
firms
still
waiting
for
offshore
drilling
to
pick
up
completing
a
well
by
fracking
and
tying
it
to
pipelines
represents
about
percent
of
onshore
well
expenditures
with
producers
holding
off
completions
until
new
pipelines
start
up
next
year
there
is
less
demand
for

soft

unwillingness
to
raise

also
is
taking
a
toll
analysts
at

estimate
that
more
than
percent

budgets
soon
will
be
tapped
out

estimate
there
could
be
a

decline
in

activity

they
expect
the
market
to
bottom
early
next

there
is
still

of
further
