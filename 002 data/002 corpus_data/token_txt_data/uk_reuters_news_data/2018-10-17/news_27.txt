global
carbon
emissions
will
rise
to
a
new
record
level
in
making
the
chances
of
reaching
a
target
to
keep
temperature
increases
to
or
degrees
celsius
remote
the
head
of
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
wednesday
iea
s
fatih
birol
told
a
conference
in
paris
that
data
for
the
first
nine
months
of
the
years
was
already
pointing
to
a
record
increase
in
carbon
emissions
a
united
nations
report
last
week
said
society
would
have
to
make
changes
to
how
it
consumes
energy
travels
and
builds
to
meet
a
lower
global
warming
target
sorry
i
have
very
bad
news
my
numbers
are
giving
me
some
despair
birol
told
the
conference
at
the
polish
embassy
in
paris
poland
will
host
united
nations
talks
in
december
which
will
lay
out
a
rule
book
to
implement
a
historic
accord
reached
in
paris
in
that
agreement
set
goals
to
phase
out
fossil
fuel
use
this
century
shift
towards
cleaner
energies
and
help
limit
a
rise
in
temperatures
looking
at
data
for
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
emissions
this
year
will
increase
once
again
global
emissions
will
reach
a
record
historical
high
birol
said
therefore
the
chances
of
reaching
such
ambitious
targets
in
my
view
are
becoming
weaker
and
weaker
every
year
every
month
