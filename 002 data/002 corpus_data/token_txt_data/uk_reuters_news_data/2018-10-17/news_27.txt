italy
s
eurosceptic
government
is
pushing
for
a
reduction
of
tensions
between
the
european
union
and
russia
but
risks
isolation
in
brussels
as
eu
partners
seek
instead
stronger
measures
to
deter
moscow
from
interfering
in
eu
affairs
russia
has
been
subjected
to
eu
sanctions
since
the
ukraine
crisis
and
rome
has
long
urged
a
relaxation
of
the
penalties
on
the
grounds
that
they
have
hit
italian
firms
trading
with
moscow
in
a
new
thrust
italy
is
now
calling
on
eu
partners
to
back
a
plan
to
channel
eu
money
to
small
russian
firms
that
operate
in
sectors
not
covered
by
existing
eu
sanctions
on
banking
defence
and
the
energy
industry
three
diplomats
told
reuters
that
initiative
preceded
a
summit
of
eu
leaders
due
to
start
later
on
wednesday
in
brussels
rome
is
also
resisting
eu
proposals
to
impose
sanctions
on
countries
that
carry
out
in
another
move
seen
as
being
in
favour
of
moscow
diplomats
said
the
new
eu
sanctions
regime
would
be
aimed
mostly
at
russia
which
has
been
in
recent
months
at
the
centre
of
allegations
of
elections
meddling
via
social
media
in
various
western
states
as
well
as
cyber
warfare
and
security
breaches
conducted
through
electronic
means
italy
was
the
only
eu
member
state
that
openly
resisted
the
new
sanctions
regime
according
to
a
confidential
eu
document
seen
by
reuters
italian
officials
declined
comment
the
diplomatic
push
in
brussels
coincides
with
a
visit
of
italy
s
far
right
deputy
prime
minister
matteo
salvini
to
russia
on
wednesday
the
second
since
he
was
sworn
in
four
months
ago
salvini
who
leads
italy
s
league
party
is
an
admirer
of
russian
president
vladimir
putin
and
has
rejected
allegations
of
russian
meddling
in
western
elections
polls
show
the
league
has
multiplied
its
supporters
in
recent
months
also
thanks
to
hardline
slogans
against
the
european
union
italian
prime
minister
giuseppe
conte
is
likely
to
repeat
calls
for
better
relations
with
russia
at
the
eu
summit
he
is
then
planning
to
fly
to
moscow
next
week
rome
s
calls
for
eu
funding
to
russian
small
firms
are
not
expected
to
be
reflected
in
the
joint
document
that
eu
leaders
will
approve
at
the
end
of
their
meeting
this
week
diplomats
said
but
the
eu
commission
could
be
asked
to
explore
the
feasibility
of
such
a
plan
the
move
is
likely
to
be
opposed
by
britain
and
eastern
european
countries
who
fear
that
existing
sanctions
could
be
one
diplomat
said
a
spokeswoman
for
the
eu
foreign
affairs
chief
was
not
immediately
available
for
comments
italy
s
opposition
to
cyber
sanctions
has
contributed
to
a
softening
of
the
wording
of
the
final
joint
summit
document
which
in
its
last
draft
version
says
work
should
be
taken
forward
on
cyber
defences
through
eu
restrictive
measures
britain
and
other
backers
of
the
sanctions
would
have
preferred
clearer
commitments
