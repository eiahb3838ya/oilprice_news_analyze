asian
equities
got
some
welcome
relief
on
wednesday
after
upbeat
earnings
reports
drove
a
rebound
on
wall
street
and
helped
restore
a
little
faith
in
emerging
market
stocks
and
currencies
japan
s
nikkei
galloped
out
of
the
gates
with
a
rise
of
percent
but
still
has
a
way
to
go
to
recoup
the
past
week
s
losses
the
nikkei
appears
to
have
bottomed
out
said
soichiro
monji
senior
economist
at
daiwa
sb
investments
the
latest
tumble
was
not
driven
by
convincing
factors
the
market
may
have
needed
to
adjust
after
its
sharp
rally
and
upcoming
corporate
earnings
should
provide
evidence
of
solid
economic
msci
s
broadest
index
of

japan
added
percent
and

percent
while
spreadbetters
pointed
to
opening

for
the

bourses
chinese
blue
chips
however
lagged
with
a
gain
of
only
percent
and
threatened
to
sour
the
mood
on
wall
street
the
three
major
indexes
had
tallied
their
biggest
percentage
gains
since
march
the
dow
jumped
percent
while
the

climbed
percent

netflix

shot
percent
higher
after
the
close
as
its

far
outstripped
market
expectations
with

the
blockbuster

sent
shares

up
about

the
four
make
up
the
fang
group
of
companies
that
in
recent
months
has
lost
some
of
its
momentum
following
gains
in
recent
years
most
have
blamed
last
week
s
volatility
spike
on
the
systematic
funds
liquidating
positions
as
the
short
volatility
trade
unwound
rapidly
said
chris
weston
head
of
research
at
broker
peppertsone
this
in
turn
has
allowed
traders
to
away
from
the
macro
towards
micro
and
predictably
solid
corporate
the
economic
news
was
also
robust
notably
a
sharp
rise
in
job
openings
to
a
fresh
high
all
this
cheer
favoured
currencies
in
emerging
markets
while
taking
some
steam
out
of
the
yen
the
msci
emerging
market
currency
index
rose
for
a
third
straight
session
the
latest
survey
of
global
fund
managers
by
bofa
merrill
lynch
found
they
saw
emerging
market
currencies
as
the
most
undervalued
ever
against
the
dollar
the
dollar
itself
was
up
on
the
yen
at
but
flat
on
the
euro
at
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
idled
at
having
touched
a
trough
overnight
not
helping
the
dollar
was
fresh
criticism
of
the
federal
reserve
from
president
donald
trump
who
told
fox
business
network
my
biggest
threat
is
the
trump
has
recently
castigated
the
central
bank
for
raising
interest
rates
while
such
name
calling
shouldn
t
mean
anything
in
terms
of
what
the
fed
actually
does
it
is
a
factor
which
somewhat
undermines
sentiment
towards
the
dollar
said
ray
attrill
head
of
fx
strategy
at
nab
it
s
a
contributory
factor
albeit
minor
to
recent
poor
performance
of

due
out
later
wednesday

there
was
also
a

that
