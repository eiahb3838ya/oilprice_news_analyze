proved
as
warnings
over
a

european
auto
sector
soured
an
upbeat
mood
while

its
best
session
in

the
previous
day
european
stocks
having
hit
a
high
in
early
trade
were
back
in
the
red
by
gmt
pulled
lower
by
a
percent
fall
in
an
index
of
auto
stocks
this
came
after
goldman
sachs
analysts
said
slowing
car
demand
in
china
and
new
regulations
on
emissions
testing
were
hurting
investors
sentiment
towards
european
autos
stocks
and
warned
this

season
could
be
challenging

stephen
innes
a
trader
at

said
in
a
note
to
clients
let
s
not
lose
sight
of
the
enormity
of
global
risks
which
suggests
the
isolated
us
growth
theme
will
come
to
a
not
so
subtle
end
just
like
the
synchronised
global

theme
did
at

shone

a

improved
the
mood
on
world
equity
markets
msci
s
share
index
added
percent
while
japan
s
nikkei
jumped
percent
the
gains
followed
a
scintillating
new
york
session
where
the
three
major
indexes
tallied
their
biggest
percentage
gains
since
march
rising
more
than
percent
each
but
even
that
only
marked
a
partial
recovery
from
a
recent
pullback
that
saw
the
s
p
index
post
its
biggest
weekly
drop
since
march
while
the
dollar
s
off
lows
checked
gains
they
were
supported
by
easing
tensions
between
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
as
well
as
signs
that
turkey
s
currency
crisis
had
been
laid
to
rest
there
are
negative
risks
in
the
short
term
but
on
the
positive
side
we
have
good
earnings
and
data
from
the
united
states
said
christoph
barraud
an
economist
at
brokerage
market
securities
last
week
s
correction
was
extreme
a
lot
of
people
became
short
the
market
so
this
is
a
bit
of
overall
earnings
for
s
p
companies
are
seen
growing
percent
according
to
refinitiv
tuesday
s
gains
were
triggered
by
netflix
which
shot
percent
higher
after
the
close
as
its
results
beat
market
expectations
that
sent
shares
of
alphabet
inc
facebook
inc
and
inc
up
about
percent
in
extended
trade
the
four
make
up
the
fang

which
in
recent
months
has
lost
some
of

soothing
fears
the
economy
may
be
running
out
of
steam
barraud
said
the
of
equities
was
likely
to
continue
people
want
to
put
money
where
there
is
best
visibility
in
the
you
have
growth
visibility
strong
earnings
as
well
as
buybacks
and
dividends
so
the
is
still
attractive
compared
to
peers
he
said
msci
s
global
equity
index
touched
a
high
but
was
flat
by
gmt
a
strengthening
dollar
meant
that

lost
some
steam
as
the
session
wore
on
turkey
s
lira
is
came
slightly
off
highs
having
rallied
percent
over
the

though
it
had
to
pay
a
substantial
premium
saudi

stabilised
after

he
told

my
biggest
threat
is
the
while
