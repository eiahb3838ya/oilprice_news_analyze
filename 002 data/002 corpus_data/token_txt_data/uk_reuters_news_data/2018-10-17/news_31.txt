the
crude
oil
price
appears
firmly
in
the
hands
of
geopolitical
concerns
with
veiled
saudi
threats
over
the
disappearance
of
a
journalist
and
the
ramping
up
of
sanctions
against
iran
getting
most
of
the
attention
however
it
s
always
worth
looking
at
what
is
happening
in
the
real
world
of
physical
oil
flows
and
pricing
as
this
can
often
tell
a
somewhat
different
narrative
to
what
is
driving
the
paper
market
the
disappearance
and
presumed
murder
of
saudi
arabian
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
kingdom
s
consulate
in
istanbul
and
the
ongoing
fallout
from
the
incident
has
raised
fears
of
riyadh
using
crude
oil
exports
as
some
sort
of
weapon
the
concern
is
that
saudi
arabia
which
has
so
far
denied
having
anything
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
khashoggi
will
restrict
its
oil
exports
if
other
nations
take
action
against
the
kingdom
in
punishment
for
what
is
currently
widely
viewed
as
a
likely
killing
the
debate
over
this
possibility
is
certain
to
get
the
market
s
attention
as
are
the
swings
and
roundabouts
connected
with
the
story
such
as
the
apparent
of
the
possible
murder
by
president
donald
trump
add
to
the
latest
saudi
intrigue
the
november
of
supposedly
total
sanctions
against
iran
s
exports
by
the
trump
administration
and
it
s
easy
to
see
why
many
market
participants
have
geopolitical
concerns
front
and
centre
however
the
physical
side
of
the
crude
oil
market
tells
a
more
relaxed
story
with
some
signs
that
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
is
so
far
being
adequately
compensated
the
latest
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
showed
that
exports
from
the
middle
east
reached
a
high
of
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
this
was
up
million
barrels
from
the
prior
week
and
was
led
by
strong
gains
by
kuwait
the
united
arab
emirates
and
oman
exports
from
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
were
down
slightly
last
week
compared
to
the
prior
week
but
higher
than
in
the
preceding
two
weeks
monitoring
exports
from
iran
is
becoming
increasingly
challenging
given
the
islamic
republic
s
tankers
are
turning
off
their
tracking
transponders
presumably
in
a
bid
to
thwart
efforts
to
see
where
their
cargoes
are
headed
given
the
caveats
now
surrounding
iranian
exports
it
still
appears
that
they
are
flowing
with
refinitiv
data
showing
shipments
of
million
barrels
last
week
up
million
from
the
previous
week
still
if
exports
from
iran
are
running
at
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
is
still
well
below
their
potential
of
closer
to
million
bpd
but
for
now
it
does
seem
the
market
for
middle
eastern
crude
is
relatively
and
the
pricing
backs
this
view
oman
crude
futures
for
december
on
the
dubai
mercantile
exchange
closed
at
a
barrel
on
tuesday
putting
them
at
a
premium
of
cents
to
dubai
swaps
for
december
this
premium
has
emerged
in
recent
days
as
the
imbroglio
over
the
fate
of
khashoggi
has
escalated
given
that
on
the
swaps
were
commanding
a
premium
of
cents
a
barrel
over
the
futures
while
both
oman
futures
and
physical
dubai
crudes
have
gained
in
recent
days
the
paper
oil
has
done
so
at
a
faster
pace
suggesting
investors
are
more
concerned
than
the
traders
refiners
and
producers
who
buy
and
sell
actual
cargoes
currently
there
isn
t
a
large
disconnect
between
the
paper
and
physical
crude
markets
in
the
middle
east
but
futures
trading
at
a
premium
to
physical
does
suggest
the
market
may
not
be
as
tight
as
feared
