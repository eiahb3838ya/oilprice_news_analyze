indian
prime
minister
narendra
modi
will
visit
china
this
week
for
an
informal
meeting
with
president
xi
jinping
as
efforts
at
rapprochement
gather
pace
following
a
testing
year
in
ties
between
the
two
giant
neighbours
the
chinese
government
s
top
diplomat
state
councillor
wang
yi
said
the
two
would
meet
on
friday
and
saturday
in
the
central
chinese
city
of
wuhan
our
common
interests
far
outweigh
our
differences
the
two
countries
have
no
choice
other
than
pursuing
everlasting
friendship
mutually
beneficial
cooperation
and
common
development
wang
told
reporters
after
meeting
indian
foreign
minister
sushma
swaraj
in
beijing
the
summit
will
go
a
long
way
towards
deepening
the
mutual
trust
between
the
two
great
neighbours
he
added
we
will
make
sure
that
the
informal
summit
will
be
a
complete
success
and
a
new
milestone
in
the
history
of
modi
has
sought
to
ties
after
disputes
over
issues
including
their
disputed
border
with
tibet
and
other
issues
the
discussion
with
wang
was
to
prepare
for
the
informal
summit
swaraj
said
it
will
be
an
important
occasion
for
them
modi
and
xi
to
exchange
views
on
bilateral
and
international
matters
from
an
overarching
and
perspective
with
the
objective
of
enhancing
mutual
communication
swaraj
said
the
asian
giants
were
locked
in
a
military
in
a
remote
stretch
of
that
boundary
last
year
at
one
point
soldiers
from
the
two
sides
threw
stones
and
punches
the
confrontation
between
the
powers
in
the
himalayas
underscored
indian
alarm
at
china
s
expanding
security
and
economic
links
in
south
asia
china
s
ambitious
belt
and
road
initiative
of
transport
and
energy
links
bypasses
india
apart
from
a
corner
of
the
disputed
kashmir
region
also
claimed
by
pakistan
but
involves
india
s
neighbours
sri
lanka
nepal
and
the
s
previously
unannounced
wuhan
trip
is
even
more
unusual
in
that
he
will
visit
china
again
in
june
for
a
summit
in
qingdao
of
the
china
and
security
grouping
the
shanghai
cooperation
organisation
which
india
joined
last
year
it
is
almost
unheard
of
for
foreign
leaders
to
visit
china
twice
in
such
close
succession
xi
is
also
extending
modi
the
rare
honour
of
a
meeting
outside
of
beijing
which
almost
never
happens
unless
there
is
a
multilateral
summit
taking
place
modi
s
nationalist
government
has
reversed
course
on
its
relationship
with
beijing
apparently
after
realising
its
hard
line
on
china
was
not
working
exiled
tibetan
spiritual
leader
the
dalai
lama
who
lives
in
india
and
who
china
considers
a
dangerous
separatist
is
also
facing
the
cold
shoulder
in
march
india
issued
an
unprecedented
ban
on
tibetans
holding
a
rally
with
the
dalai
lama
in
new
delhi
to
mark
the
anniversary
of
the
start
of
the
failed
uprising
against
chinese
rule
other
areas
of
disagreement
remain
however
between
beijing
and
new
delhi
china
has
blocked
india
s
membership
of
a
nuclear
cartel
and
it
has
also
been
blocking
sanctions
against
a
militant
leader
blamed
for
attacks
on
india
