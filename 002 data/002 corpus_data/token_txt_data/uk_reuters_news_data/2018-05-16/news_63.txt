interview-mexico's pemex says testing crude for import could start in july
seattle
may
reuters
mexican
oil
company
pemex
expects
to
begin
testing
light
crudes
as
soon
as
july
for
possible
import
looking
to
boost
margins
at
its
domestic
refineries
its
chief
executive
said
on
tuesday
pemex
has
for
decades
exported
crude
oil
but
has
hardly
ever
imported
the
commodity
preferring
to
process
domestic
crudes
at
its
six
refineries
in
mexico
pemex
chief
executive
officer
carlos
trevino
said
the
company
would
likely
seek
imports
resembling
its
proprietary
isthmus
grade
of
light
crude
the
production
of
which
has
been
declining
in
mexico
we
are
going
to
start
testing
maybe
in
the
third
quarter
trevino
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in
seattle
we
are
going
to
be
looking
for
the
cheaper
mix
we
may
be
using
the
west
texas
intermediate
something
from
the
he
said
what
i
personally
expect
is
that
we
can
find
something
very
similar
to
isthmus
the
company
one
of
the
largest
in
latin
america
has
said
it
was
looking
for
lighter
crude
grades
for
its
refining
network
which
is
currently
operating
at
around
percent
of
its
million
capacity
trevino
reiterated
that
importing
could
be
a
temporary
strategy
partly
because
of
the
oil
it
has
been
producing
at
its
new
ixachi
field
in
veracruz
it
s
a
lot
of
gas
and
very
very
light
crude
so
we
expect
to
get
more
oil
from
that
field
so
maybe
that
will
help
us
on
the
mix
we
are
using
for
our
refineries
he
said
trevino
also
said
pemex
s
annual
crude
oil
hedging
program
is
set
to
cover
about
a
third
of
annual
production
at
a
price
of
per
barrel
but
he
declined
to
elaborate
the
company
was
processing
between
bpd
as
of
sunday
but
expects
to
process
an
average
bpd
for
the
rest
of
the
year
pemex
has
increased
processing
levels
at
its
madero
refinery
and
expects
to
finish
the
starting
up
of
its
minatitlan
facility
this
month
trevino
said
it
may
begin
maintenance
at
its
cadereyta
and
tula
refineries
later
this
year
we
are
going
to
be
processing
around
bpd
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
added
trevino
also
said
he
expects
pemex
s
rate
of
replacement
for
its
proven
oil
reserves
in
to
be
pretty
much
the
same
or
a
little
above
the
rate
it
achieved
