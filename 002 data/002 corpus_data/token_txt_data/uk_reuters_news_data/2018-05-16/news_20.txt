italy
s
borrowing
costs
jumped
on
wednesday
and
the
country
s
stocks
slid
after
reports
that
the
two
parties
seeking
to
form
italy
s
next
government
might
seek
debt
forgiveness
while
the
dollar
rallied
further
to
a
high
investors
were
digesting
tuesday
s
surge
in
bond

on
the
heels
of

the
combination
of
higher
oil

higher

are
starting
to
potentially
weigh
on

sentiment
said
katie

of

while
italy

it
s
right
to
resonate
with
markets
because
it
tells
you
about
the
sense
of
the
wisdom
between
these
negotiating
parties

and
president
donald
trump
into
doubt
by
saying
it
may
reconsider
if

it
unilaterally
gives
up
its

investors
have
gotten
sort
of
used
to
this
whether
we
are
talking
about
north
korea
or
the
trade
discussions
with
china
i
think
investors
are
recognizing
we
are
at
the
beginning
of
the
beginning
of
this
so
it
s
not
anything
to
make
dramatic
portfolio
