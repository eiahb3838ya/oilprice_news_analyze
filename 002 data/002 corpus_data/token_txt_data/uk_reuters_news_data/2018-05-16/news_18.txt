agribusiness
group
bunge
said
on
wednesday
it
was
reducing
biodiesel
output
at
a
german
refinery
the
latest
in
a
series
of
production
cuts
in
germany
following
a
surge
of
cheap
imports
of
the
green
fuel
into
europe
bunge
expects
to
initially
cut
output
at
its
mannheim
biodiesel
plant
by
percent
in
the
second
quarter
of
a
bunge
spokeswoman
said
the
plant
has
capacity
to
produce
tonnes
of
biodiesel
annually
afterwards
we
will
review
production
periodically
and
adjust
as
necessary
the
spokeswoman
said
the
production
cut
is
another
sign
of
problems
in
europe
s
biofuel
industry
after
the
eu
in
march
removed
duties
on
biodiesel
imports
argentine
and
indonesian
producers
following
the
end
of
legal
proceedings
at
the
european
court
of
justice
the
eu
s
removal
of
duties
on
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
created
a
surge
in
eu
imports
forcing
european
producers
to
cut
production
in
coming
months
eu
producers
say
biodiesel
from
argentina
and
indonesia
gets
unfair
state
support
enabling
it
to
be
sold
at
low
prices
in
europe

daniels
midland
co
said
in
march
it
would
suspend

plant
in
germany
because
of
increasing
cheap
imports
in
april
german
renewable
fuel
producer
natural

it
was
reducing
biodiesel
output
by
percent
