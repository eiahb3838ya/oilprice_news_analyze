the

aruba
refinery

its
terminal
from

government
since

store
venezuelan

the
management
of

were
organizing
a
contingency
plan
to
avoid
a
situation
similar
to
curacao
and
bonaire
where
inventories
were
blocked
by
conoco
s
legal
actions
no
fuel
shortages
have
been

talks
with
conoco
to
free

what

belongs
to

but
a
judge
has
to
rule
on
it
said

beaudo
a
conoco
spokesman
said
on
tuesday
that
the
company
sent

to
the

this
week
to
meet
with
local
officials
and
address
their
concerns
over
conoco
s
efforts
to
enforce
the
arbitration
award
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
last
week
curacao
officials
said
the
isla
refinery
would
have
to
halt
refining
operations
once
its
available
inventories
were
exhausted
it
is
pdvsa
that
has
failed
to
honor
our
award
by
ignoring
the
judgement
of
the
icc
tribunal
and
other
local
court
orders
beaudo
said
in
a
statement
conoco
chief
executive
ryan

said
the

is
far
from
recovering
all
of
the
billion
icc
award
he
said
legal
actions
have
been
brought
in
hong
kong
and
london
to
have
the
ruling
recognized

a
similar
move
