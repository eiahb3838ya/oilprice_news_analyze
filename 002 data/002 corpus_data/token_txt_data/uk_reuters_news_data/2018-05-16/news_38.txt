some
old
arbitrages

barrels
of
crude
oil
per
month
we
plan
to
triple
this
over
the
next
months
our
key
to
success
has
been
in
developing
new
markets
for
either
established
grades

finding
new
niches
for
difficult
grades

we
have
been
the

we
reopened
the
arbitrage
into

managed
to
find
a
blend
for
it
to
take
into
the
chinese
market
we
also
sold
the
first
cargo
of

combination
of
low

price
volatility

market
transparency
