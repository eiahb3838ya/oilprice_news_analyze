wang

a

analyst
with

an

predicted
coal
futures
could
rise
to
as
high
as
yuan
per

in
june
surpassing
the
record
of
yuan
in

as

shore
up

before

peak
summer
demand
period
the
six
largest
coal
power
plants
on
the
coast
had
days
of
inventory
by
may
down
from
more
than
days
around
the
same
period
last
year
data
provided
by
hua
an
futures
showed
utilities
started
stockpiling
earlier
than
usual
this
year
but
it
is
not
enough
the
pace
of
stockpiling
will
accelerate
in
late
may
as
power
plants
bring
their
inventory
to
a
relative
high
level
before
summer
wang
said
plants
are
also
restocking
as
concerns
grow
about
a
customs
crackdown
on
imports
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
zhejiang
guangxi
and
fujian
which
have
limited
arrivals
of
foreign
coal
adding
to
concerns
about
the
early
heat
wave
are
low
reservoir
levels
limiting
hydro
power
output
data
on
tuesday
showed
that
volumes
at
major
reservoirs
have
fallen
for
six
consecutive
months
since
december
and
are
at
their
lowest
since
august
reservoir
levels
are
a
key
gauge
of
how
much
electricity
can
be
produced
by
hydro
power
stations
we
are
closely
watching
if
hydro
power
is
enough
to
support
overall
power
generation
said
the
trader
hydro
power
output
fell
to
billion
kilowatt
hours
kwh
in
march
the
ever
for
data
going
back
for
three
years
