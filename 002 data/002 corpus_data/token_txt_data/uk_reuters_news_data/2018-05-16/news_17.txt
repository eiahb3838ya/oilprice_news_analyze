brent
crude
prices
will
sustain
levels
above
a
barrel
for
longer
as
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
iran
is
likely
to
tighten
supply
a
reuters
poll
of
analysts
showed
on
wednesday
a
survey
of
analysts
showed
brent
crude
prices
were
likely
to
average
a
barrel
this
year
and
in
a
sharp
increase
from
the
and
levels
forecast
in
the
april
poll
brent
has
averaged
about
a
barrel
this
year
thus
far
and
nearly
touched
a
barrel
this
week
oil
markets
should
become
tighter
due
to
a
lower
output
from
iran
coupled
with
an
ongoing
contraction
in
venezuelan
output
and
opec
cuts
said
daniela
corsini
commodity
market
economist
at
intesa
sanpaolo
in
milan
light
crude
was
seen
averaging
a
barrel
this
year
and
a
barrel
in
this
compares
with
an
outlook
for
per

in
and
in
in
our
april
poll
last
week
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
a
international
nuclear
pact
with
iran
and
plans
to
reimpose
economic
sanctions
on
the
country
that
has
cast
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
and
investors
lately
have
been
betting
on
prices
exceeding
or
a
barrel
though
european
nations
are
not
likely
to
follow
suit
as
they
did
during
the
obama
administration
five
of
the
analysts
polled
expected
a
supply
reduction
from
iran
of
between
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
while
exports
from
the
country
were
expected
to
drop
by
a
maximum
of
bpd
by
the
first
half
of
the
nation
currently
produces
million
bpd
oil
prices
are
hovering
near
highs
having
jumped
over
percent
over
the
last
year
boosted
by
rising
demand
and
a
deal
to
curb
output
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
including
russia
the
international
energy
agency
on
wednesday
warned
that
demand
could
be
sapped
by
prices
global
oil
inventories
are
already
either
below
or
at
the
average
this
means
that
the
market
will
have
little
cushion
against
any
other
unexpected
production
outage
at
a
time
when
geopolitical
risks
abound
these
risks
can
come
from
libya
nigeria
and
venezuela

a
global
oil
glut
has
been
virtually
eliminated
figures
published
by
opec
showed
on
monday
with
venezuela
whose
output
has
plunged
due
to
an
economic
crisis
reporting
production
fell
to
million
bpd
in
april
lowest
in
decades
a
majority
of
analysts
said
opec
was
unlikely
to
prematurely
end
its
output
curbs
while
some
analysts
said
the
imposition
of
trade
restrictions
could
affect
compliance
levels
and
provide
countries
like
saudi
arabia
and
russia
an
opportunity
to
regain
