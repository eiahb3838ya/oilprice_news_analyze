states
withdrew
and
said
it
would
reinstate
sanctions
on
tehran
determined
to
keep

alive
european
leaders
need
to
find
a
way
to
assure
companies
that
their
investments
are
beyond
washington
s
reach
they
also
want
to
persuade
tehran
the
deal
which
lifted
earlier
sanctions
on
the
islamic
republic
in
exchange
for
it
curbing
its
nuclear
ambitions
is
worth
sticking
to
total

a

in
to
develop
phase
of
iran
s
south
pars
field
with
an
initial
investment
of
billion
million
a

tehran
repeatedly
hailed
as
a
symbol
of

success

not
continue
the
south
pars
project
and
will
have
to
unwind
all
related
operations
before
november
unless
total
is
granted
a
specific
project
waiver
by
authorities
with
the
support
of
the
french
and
european
authorities
the
french
oil
and
gas
major
said
in
a
statement
total
s
announcement
comes
after
german
insurer
allianz
and
danish
oil
product
tanker
operator
maersk
tankers
said
they
were
winding
down
their
businesses
in
iran
joe
kaeser
the
ceo
of
germany
s
siemens
told
cnn
his
company
would
not
be
able
to
do
any
new
business
with
tehran
iran
has
said
it
may
start
enriching
uranium
again
if
it
can
no
longer
see
any
economic
benefit
to
the
deal
total
said
any
waiver
would
need
to
include
protection
from
secondary
sanctions
that
washington
might
impose
on
companies
that
continue
to
do
business
with
iran
these
might
include
the
loss
of
financing
in
dollars
by
banks
the
loss
of
shareholders
and
the
inability
to
continue
its
operations
it
said
france
germany
and
britain
are
leading
a
european
effort
to
safeguard
europe
s
economic
interests
but
have
few
options
that
pose
any
threat
to
the
united
states
it
would
be
suicide
to
do
any
new
business
or
funding
for
iran
or
companies
without
explicit
guarantees
from
the
government
they
have
us
by
the
throat
because
so
much
business
is
conducted
and
cleared
in
dollars
one
european
investment
banker
said
the
fines
are
in
the
multibillions
these
days
so
it
s
just
not
worth
the
risk
for
a
small
piece
of
business
and
maybe
pleasing
a
european
an
official
in
the
french
finance
ministry
said
precise
requests
were
being
lodged
with
the
authorities
including
for
total
and
that
the
company
s
decision
was
not
a
surprise
a
european
diplomat
was
more
blunt
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
will
to
impose
sanctions
on
europeans
and
a
resentment
towards
european
companies
who
are
now
being
accused
of
supporting
a
terrorist
state
with
that
in
mind
it
s
a
logical
total
said
it
had
so
far
spent
less
than
million
euros
million
on
the
project
and
withdrawing
would
not
impact
the
company
s
production
growth
targets
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
the
french
firm
would
not
pay
a
penalty
if
it
pulled
out
of
the
project
italy
s
eni
which
last
june
signed
a
provisional
agreement
with
tehran

conduct
oil
and

feasibility
studies
said
after
washington
s
decision
to
quit
the
nuclear
deal
last
week
that
it
had
no
plans
for
new
projects
in
iran
in
an
unintended
twist
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
threaten
european
companies
that
continue
to
invest
in
iran
may
open
the
door
to
chinese
rivals
industry
sources
told
reuters
this
week
that
china
s
cnpc
which
holds
a
percent
stake
in
the
south
pars
project
was
ready
