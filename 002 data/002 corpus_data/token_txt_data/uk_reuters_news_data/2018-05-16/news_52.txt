update 1-iea warns global oil demand may suffer as crude nears $80
london
reuters
global
demand
for
oil
is
likely
to
moderate
this
year
as
the
price
of
crude
nears
a
barrel
and
many
key
importing
nations
no
longer
offer
consumers
generous
fuel
subsidies
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
the
iea
cut
its
forecast
for
global
demand
growth
to
million
barrels
per
day
for
from
a
previous
estimate
of
million
bpd
oil
has
risen
percent
in
the
last
year
driven
by
coordinated
supply
cuts
and
this
month
by
concern
over
iranian
supply
after
the
united
states
said
it
would
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
over
its
nuclear
activities
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
such
a
large
jump
did
not
affect
demand
growth
especially
as
subsidies
have
been
reduced
or
cut
in
several
emerging
economies
in
recent
years
the
iea
said
oil
inventories
in
the
world
s
richest
nations
the
most
transparent
and
easy
to
track
have
now
fallen
million
barrels
below
the
average
the
level
targeted
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
partners
as
the
group
restrains
crude
output
for
a
second
year
for
now
the
rapidly
changing
geopolitical
landscape
will
move
the
attention
away
from
stocks
as
producers
and
consumers
consider
how
to
limit
volatility
in
the
oil
market
the
iea
said
for
its
part
the
iea
will
monitor
developments
closely
and
is
ready
to
act
if
necessary
to
ensure
that
markets
remain
well
iran
which
produces
around
million
bpd
and
is
opec
s
supplier
behind
saudi
arabia
and
iraq
could
face
severe
disruption
to
its
exports
the
iea
said
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
which
were
lifted
in
early
cut
iran
s
crude
exports
by
more
than
million
bpd
it
is
too
soon
to
say
what
will
happen
this
time
but
we
should
examine
whether
other
producers
could
step
in
to
ensure
an
orderly
flow
of
oil
to
the
market
and
offset
a
disruption
to
iranian
exports
the
agency
said
iran
exported
million
bpd
of
crude
in
april
according
to
the
oil
ministry
s
news
agency
shana
the
iea
estimates
demand
for
opec
s
crude
will
average
million
bpd
for
the
rest
of
compared
with
output
of
million
bpd
in
april
world
supply
meanwhile
rose
million
bpd
in
april
from
a
year
earlier
driven
predominantly
by
production
economic
crisis
has
driven
venezuelan
production
to
its
lowest
in
years
while
natural
decline
in
mexico
cut
production
by
bpd
in
april
down
percent
the
largest
fall
for
any

record
output
from
the
united

pushed
supplies
up
by
million

outside

the
iea
said
noting
declines
in
the
north

and
brazil
the

which

western
governments
on

policy
expects
