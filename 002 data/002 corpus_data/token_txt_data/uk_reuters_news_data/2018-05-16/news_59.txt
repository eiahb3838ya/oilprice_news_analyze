the

held

a

of

on

the

largely
shrugged
off

asian

were
particularly
vulnerable

korean
won
was
steadier

the
country
s
bond
yields
rose
to
the
highest
level
since
late
some
market
participants
think
emerging
market
assets
would
be
better
placed
than
they
were
in
the
past
when
hints
the
fed
would
taper
its
quantitative
easing
knocked
their

what
we
see

of

yamamoto
he
also
said
he
does
not
see
