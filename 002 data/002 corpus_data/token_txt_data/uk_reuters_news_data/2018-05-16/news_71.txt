petroleum
imports
have
fallen
to
the
lowest
level
in
more
than
half
a
century
as
a
result
of
the
shale
revolution
which
is
profoundly
changing
the
impact
higher
oil
prices
have
on
the
economy
since
the
the
united
states
has
been
the
world
s
largest
producer
and
consumer
of
oil
which
means
it
has
a
complicated
relationship
with
oil
prices
rising
oil
prices
benefit
some
businesses
and
workers
at
the
expense
of
others
and
the
same
has
been
true
about
a
sharp
price
fall
until
after
world
war
two
the
country
was
a
net
exporter
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
first
era
of
energy
dominance
but
from
the
late
and
especially
the
the
united
states
turned
into
an
increasingly
major
oil
importer
since
then
the
principal
effect
of
a
rise
in
oil
prices
has
been
to
transfer
income
from
consumers
and
businesses
in
the
united
states
to
countries
in
latin
america
the
middle
east
and
africa
rising
prices
have
put
pressure
on
the
balance
of
payments
and
the
dollar
s
value
contributing
to
an
occasionally
negative
relationship
between
the
price
of
oil
and
the
exchange
rate
but
as
net
imports
have
declined
in
the
last
decade
the
picture
has
changed
again
and
the
main
transfers
of
income
are
now
occurring
within
the
united
states
rather
than
with
the
rest
of
the
world
the
impact
of
oil
prices
on
the
trade
deficit
and
the
exchange
rate
is
becoming
much
less
significant
than
before
instead
rising
prices
are
transferring
income
from
net
consuming
states
such
as
california
florida
new
york
and
illinois
to
net
producing
states
including
texas
oklahoma
new
mexico
and
north
dakota
rising
prices
are
also
transferring
income
from
households
motorists
the
transportation
sector
manufacturers
and
retailers
to
the
oil
industry
and
its
supply
chain
in
the
broadest
sense
rising
oil
prices
tend
to
depress
spending
by
consumers
while
enhancing
investment
by
the
oil
industry
how
rising
oil
prices
will
affect
the
united
states
barron
s
may
in
the
short
term
rising
oil
prices
have
provided
a
significant
boost
to
the
economic
expansion
as
the
positive
impact
on
investment
has
outweighed
the
negative
impact
on
consumer
spending
but
that
positive
scenario
may
not
last
if
oil
prices
continue
to
rise
over
the
next
two
years
domestic
crude
production
has
more
than
doubled
from
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
to
million
bpd
in
february
government
policies
have
also
cut
import
dependence
by
requiring
increases
in
vehicle
fuel
economy
and
mandating
the
addition
of
ethanol
and
biodiesel
to
the
fuel
supply
domestic
consumption
of
petroleum
products
peaked
at
million
bpd
in
and
was
averaging
million
bpd
in
the
result
has
been
a
transformation
in
petroleum
trade
with
the
country
becoming
an
increasingly
important
exporter
of
refined
products
such
as
diesel
and
more
recently
crude
oil
the
size
and
suddenness
of
this
shift
is
one
reason
why
the
rise
of
shale
production
in
the
united
states
qualifies
as
a
genuine
energy
revolution
net
imports
of
crude
oil
and
petroleum
products
peaked
at
more
than
million
bpd
in
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
by
net
imports
had
fallen
to
million
bpd
and
they
continued
to
shrink
in
the
first
three
months
of
the
united
states
remains
an
important
net
importer
of
crude
roughly
million
bpd
in
recent
months
but
has
become

exporter

the
balance
of
payments
is
now
much
more
insulated
from
the
impact
of
changing
oil
prices
than
during
the
oil
shock
between
january
and
march
the
trade

with
the
rest
of
the

worsened
by
almost

earlier
the

the
rise
in
oil
production
has
encouraged
some
policymakers
to
speak
about
achieving
energy
independence
or
even
a
second

the
reality
is
more
complicated
increased
domestic
energy
production
is
clearly
beneficial
for
the

but
sharp
increases
or
reductions
in
oil
prices
can
still
have
profound
distributional
effects
within
the

since

still
