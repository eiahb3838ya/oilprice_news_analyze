billion
coastal
gaslink
pipeline
will
start
in
early
pending
a
positive
final
investment
decision
on
the
linked
lng
canada
project
the
head
of
the
pipeline
project
said
on
wednesday
the
comments
followed
a
commitment
from
the
chief
executive
of
lng
canada
on
tuesday
that
the
c
billion
liquefied
natural
gas
export
terminal
would
be
under
construction
in
a
final
investment
decision
or
fid
from
the
project
partners
is
expected
this
year
we
would
be
looking
at
constructing
in
the
early
part
of
coastal
gaslink
president
richard
gateman
told
reporters
at
an
lng
conference
we
could
be
doing
a
little
bit
of
field
work
in
the
fall
of
if
there
s
an
fid
transcanada
s
coastal
gaslink
pipeline
will
cross
two
mountain
ranges
to
connect
rich
shale
fields
in
alberta
and
northeast
british
columbia
with
the
proposed
lng
canada
export
terminal
on
british
columbia
s
northwest
coast
if
the
project
goes
ahead
it
will
be
a
game
changer
for
canada
s
natural
gas
producers
which
currently
face
steep
discounts
for
their
product
because
of
sagging
demand
in
the
united
states
and
a
lack
of
other
export
markets
transcanada
expects
to
award
contracts
for
the
construction
to
four
consortiums
within
the
next
two
months
gateman
said
those
contractors
will
be
a
mix
of
local
and
international
players
with
experience
building
in
mountainous
terrain
he
said
the
company
also
expects
to
provide
a
cost
update
around
the
same
time
he
said
adding
i
ll
say
that
that
was
an
estimate
in
dollars
and
if
you
take
that
to
dollars
it
s
a
little
bit
more
but
it
s
not
substantially
the
c
billion
price
tag
in
dollars
would
equate
to
c
billion
now
according
to
the
bank
of
canada
inflation
calculator
bateman
also
said
transcanada
had
worked
hard
to
keep
costs
down
on
the
project
just
as
the
lng
canada
partners
have
worked
to
bring
down
costs
on
the
terminal
project
we
contributed
our
part
in
terms
of
the
pipeline
budget
and
they
did
their
part
on
the
facility
which
is
why
it
looks
like
it
is
successfully
coming
together
he
said
lng
canada
is
a
joint
venture
between
royal
dutch
shell
plc
petrochina
co
ltd
mitsubishi
corp
and
korea
gas
transcanada
will
own
and
operate
the
pipeline
