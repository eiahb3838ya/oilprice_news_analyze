a
legal
fund
in
place
to

told
the
senate
appropriations
committee
s
subcommittee
on
interior
environment
and
related
agencies
about
the
fund
he
was
speaking
during
a
hearing
that
was
meant
to
focus
on
the
epa
s
budget
but
that
centered
on
questions
about
his
conduct
including
an
allegation
he
had
sought
to
be
transported
through
traffic
with
flashing
lights
and
sirens
pruitt
has
been
under
pressure
from
lawmakers
in
recent
weeks
over
reports
about
his
routine
use
of
travel
his
security
detail
costly
office
renovations
and
ties
to
industry
criticisms
he
called
overblown
on
wednesday
he
is
still
supported
by
president
donald
trump
and
most
republicans
lawmakers
who
have
welcomed
his
efforts
to
roll
back
environmental
regulations
that
are
seen
by
industry
as
overly
burdensome
at
wednesday
s
hearing
with
the
panel
democratic
senators
lambasted
his
record
at
the
agency
patrick
leahy
of
vermont
called
his
regulatory
rollbacks
and
ethical
controversies
unconscionable
and
tom
udall
of
new
mexico
said
his
tenure
at
the
epa
was
a
betrayal
of
the
american
most
of
the
committee
s
six
democratic
members
have
vehemently
opposed
pruitt
s
efforts
to
roll
back
climate
and
pollution
regulations
introduced
under
democratic
former
president
barack
obama
and
have
seized
on
the
controversies
around
pruitt
s
conduct
to
call
for
his
resignation
udall
pressed
pruitt
on
reports
that
he
had
pushed
his
security
agents
to
use
flashing
lights
and
sirens
on
agency
vehicles
on
trips
that
were
not
emergencies
no
i
don
t
recall
that
said
pruitt
when
asked
if
he
had
personally
requested
the
use
of
lights
and
sirens
udall
submitted
for
the
record
on
an
email
released
on
wednesday
by
pruitt
s
former
security
chief
nino
perrotta
who
left
the
agency
weeks
ago
udall
said
perrotta
wrote
in
the
email
that
pruitt
had
encouraged
the
use
of
the
devices
the
controversies
around
pruitt
have
triggered
some
investigations
by
the
epa
s
inspector
general
congressional
committees
and
the
white
house
a
government
accountability
office
probe
concluded
last
month
that
the
epa
had
violated
the
law
by
spending
on
a
soundproof
phone
booth
for
pruitt
s
office
without
first
notifying
lawmakers
republican
senator
lisa
murkowski
chair
of
the
appropriations
subcommittee
said
in
her
opening
remarks
that
she
welcomed
some
of
pruitt
s
regulatory
agenda
but
the
ethics
issues
were
a
distraction
unfortunately
i
am
concerned
that
many
of
the
important
policy
efforts
you
are
engaged
in
are
being
overshadowed
she
said
there
are
some
legitimate
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
she
said
pruitt
told
the
panel
that
he
understood
the
concerns
but
added
that
some
of
the
criticism
is
unfounded
and
pruitt
has
also
faced
growing
pressure
from
some
republican
senators
who
are
not
on
the
panel
over
his
handling
of
biofuels
policy
senator
chuck
grassley
for
example
said
on
tuesday
he
would
join
lawmakers
calling
for
pruitt
s
ouster
unless
the
epa
chief
curbs
the
agency
s
use
of
waivers
exempting
refineries
from
their
obligation
to
mix
ethanol
into
fuel
the
epa
has
the
authority
to
exempt
small
refineries
if
they
can
prove
that
complying
would
cause
them
economic
hardship
but
biofuels
advocates
often
from
states
such
as
grassley
s
iowa
say
overusing
the
waivers
kills
demand
for
ethanol
pruitt
was
also
criticized
for
a
tweet
on
april
by
the
epa
s
official
account
that
cheered
senate
approval
of
former
coal
lobbyist
andrew
wheeler
as
deputy
administrator
of
the
epa
and
stated
that
the
democrats
couldn
t
block
the
udall
said
he
had
asked
the
nonpartisan
government
accountability
office
to
investigate
the
epa
s
use
of
social
media
to
send
a
politically
driven
tweet
under
the
hatch
act
federal
employees
are
banned
from
taking
part
in
political
activities
pruitt
said
the
agency
made
a
mistake
i
was
unaware
of
the
tweet
and
that
shouldn
t
have
occurred
there
shouldn
t
have
been
mocking
he
said
some
changes
have
been
implemented
at
the
epa
since
some
of
the
scandals
broke
including
the
addition
of
a
requirement
that
any
spending
over
needs
to
be
signed
off
by
several
senior
officials
pruitt
told
the
panel
pruitt
has
also
said
that
he
has
stopped
routinely
flying
first
class
something
the
agency
had
previously
defended
as
a
way
to
help
him
avoid
threats
from
the
public
on
the
legal
defense
fund
pruitt
said
his
attorney
was
working
with
the
government
accountability
office
to
make
sure
it
was
run
properly
all
donations
to
the
fund
would
be
published
and
available
to
the
public
he
said
and
he
committed
absolutely
not
to
accept
any
donations
from
lobbyists
or
companies
that
have
business
before
the
epa
when
asked
if
he
would
commit
to
not
accepting
anonymous
donations
for
the
fund
pruitt
said
his
lawyers
handle
them
and
would
follow
official
guidelines
