nigeria
s
parliament
passed
a
record
trillion
naira
billion
budget
for
on
wednesday
aimed
at
boosting
growth
in
west
africa
s
biggest
economy
nine
months
before
the
country
s
next
presidential
election
growth
remains
fragile
after
africa
s
top
crude
oil
producer
last
year
emerged
from
its
first
recession
in
years
the
recession
was
largely
caused
by
low
crude
prices
and
militant
attacks
on
energy
facilities
since
oil
sales
make
up
of
government
revenue
the
total
sum
laid
out
in
the
spending
plan
passed
by
the
senate
is
higher
than
the
trillion
naira
budget
presented
to
parliament
by
president
muhammadu
buhari
in
november
the
budget
was
passed
by
the
senate
the
upper
chamber
and
by
lawmakers
in
the
lower
house
of
representatives
shortly
afterwards
the
budget
still
needs
to
be
returned
to
buhari
to
be
signed
into
law
we
must
grow
our
economy
away
from
oil
hopefully
the
current
budget
when
signed
into
law
should
help
us
in
this
regard
said
senate
president
bukola
saraki
senate
lawmakers
said
the
increase
from
the
plan
presented
by
buhari
six
months
ago
was
due
to
the
assumed
oil
price
rising
to
per
barrel
up
from
in
buhari
s
earlier
version
the
budget
assumes
crude
oil
production
of
million
barrels
per
day
and
an
exchange
rate
of
naira
per
dollar
brent
crude
stood
at
per
barrel
by
gmt
we
still
consider
the
oil
price
benchmark
to
be
rather
conservative
given
this
year
s
oil
price
outlook
and
would
have
preferred
to
see
a
steeper
hike
accompanied
by
lower
borrowing

capital
the
budget
proposes
the
use
of
trillion
naira
to
service
debts
and
would
operate
a
deficit
of
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
this
year
delays
in
passing
budgets
amid
wrangling
between
the
executive
and
legislature
are
common
in
nigeria
and
hindered
the
implementation
of
buhari
s
previous
spending
plans
buhari
who
took
office
in
plans
to
seek
a
second
term
in
next
february
s
election
his
handling
the
economy
is
likely
to
be
a
major
campaign
issue
budgets
under
buhari
who
took
office
in
may
have
been
nigeria
s
largest
ever
but
economists
say
implementation
has
been
poor
and
failed
to
provide
the
type
of
capital
expenditure
needed
to
improve
infrastructure
the
implementation
of
fiscal
policy
is
still
weak
and
this
year
there
is
an
additional
risk
of
unproductive
spending
in
the
lead
up
to
the
election
