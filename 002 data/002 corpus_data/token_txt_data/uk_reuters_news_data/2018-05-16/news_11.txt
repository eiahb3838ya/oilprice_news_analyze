he
expected

the
nuclear
deal
and
support
western
companies
that
sign
deals
with

iran
is
a
nation
and
honors
its
contracts
he
added
zanganeh
also
said
oil
prices
at
per
barrel
would
be
logical
and
that
he
believed
the
united
states
was
trying
to
keep
prices
inflated
to
support
shale
oil
growth
despite
what
americans
say
that
they
do
not
support
high
oil
prices
the
high
prices
of
oil
can
justify
shale
production
increase
investment
and
create
more
jobs
in
the
united
states
