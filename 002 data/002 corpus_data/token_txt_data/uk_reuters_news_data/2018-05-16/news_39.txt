liquefied

lng
producers
around
the
globe
are
once
again
considering
new
investments
as
expectations
of
a
glut
in
supply
wither
away
in
the
face
of
strong
demand
growth
in
asia
given
it
takes
several
years
to
go
from
a
final
investment

fid
to
producing
cargoes
of
the
fuel
however
the
industry
may
be
acting
too
late
to
prevent
a
supply
shortfall
by
the
middle
of
next
decade
much
of
the
focus
this
week
at
an
annual
oil
and
gas
conference
in
australia
which
is
about
to
become
the
world
s
top
exporter
of
lng
was
on
what
projects
are
viable
and
how
quickly
can
they
be
developed
this
was
in
stark
contrast
to
the
mood
at
previous
events
hosted
by
the
australian
petroleum
production
and
exploration
association
appea
where
executives
had
talked
mainly
about
how
to
cut
costs
and
the
strategies
needed
to
survive
the
predicted
surplus
of
the
fuel
the
forecasts
for
a
global
glut
were
based
on
the
market
being
swamped
by
eight
new
australian
lng
projects
plus
at
least
four
in
the
united
states
as
well
a
handful
of
others
in
frontier
countries
such
as
mozambique
but
the
narrative
of
industry
in
capacity
has
been
turned
on
its
head
by
the
spectacular
growth
of
chinese
demand
which
leapt
percent
last
year
to
million
tonnes
china
is
now
the
world
s
lng
buyer
behind
japan
and
its
demand
has
continued
to
grow
rapidly
with
imports
up
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
million
tonnes
china
s
policy
to
replace
coal
with
natural
gas
for
uses
such
as
residential
heating
and
some
industries
is
expected
to
continue
to
drive
growth
in
lng
imports
although
some
moderation
in
the
rate
is
likely
in
coming
years
but
other
asian
countries
are
also
stepping
up
lng
imports
including
new
buyers
such
as
bangladesh
pakistan
and
sri
lanka
at
the
height
of
the
lng
construction
boom
of
the
past
decade
forecasts
of
a
surplus
of
as
much
as
million
tonnes
per
annum
around
the
start
of
the
were
not
uncommon
while
a
surplus
is
still
expected
by
most
analysts
size
estimates
have
been
shrinking
and
if
china
continues
to
grow
demand
at
anything
like
its
current
pace
the
surplus
will
likely
disappear
altogether
wood
mackenzie
analysts
saul
kavonic
and
nicholas
browne
speaking
on
tuesday
on
the
sidelines
of
the
appea
conference
said
the
surplus
was
likely
to
be
as
little
as
million
tonnes
in
the
early
years
of
the
in
a
total
market
of
more
than
million
tonnes
a
year
such
a
small
surplus
really
amounts
to
a
market
that
is
more
or
less
in
balance
kavonic
and
browne
also
said
that
by
the
market
was
likely
to
switch
to
an
annual
deficit
of
about
million
tonnes
and
there
simply
aren
t
enough
projects
being
approved
to
meet
the
potential
supply
gap
in
just
one
lng
project
reached
fid
that
being
the
relatively
small
coral
floating
lng
development
in
mozambique
there
is
also
a
dearth
of
projects
that
can
be
approved
and
developed
in
time
for
with
the
best
prospects
in
the
united
states
canada
and
east
africa
in
australia
the
likelihood
of
a
new
greenfield
development
is
slim
given
the
massive
capital
costs
of
developing
increasingly
remote
fields
there
is
instead
the
possibility
of
expanding
existing
operations
with
the
likely
best
bet
being
woodside
petroleum
s
plan
to
use
the
scarborough
field
off
the
western
australian
coast
to
feed
a
new
train
at
its
pluto
lng
plant
for
the
rest
of
australia
the
industry
seems
to
be
concentrating
on
developing
new
fields
to
replace
ones
that
are
depleting
thus
allowing
the
existing
million
tonnes
of
capacity
to
continue
operating
the
evaporation
of
the
expected
lng
surplus
may
also
have
implications
for
pricing
and
contracting
in
the
industry
lng
buyers
have
led
the
charge
in
recent
years
to
end
restrictive
contracts
linked
to
crude
oil
prices
in
favour
of
or
even
spot
deals
with
prices
linked
to
lng
indexes
or
other
natural
gas
prices
such
as
the
benchmark
henry
hub
the
buyers
did
this
because
they
believed
the
balance
of
market
power
was
shifting
in
their
favour
they
may
now
find
resurgent
producers
kicking
them
back
and
demanding
higher
prices
in
order
to
guarantee
supplies
