britain's strategy to meet climate change targets not sufficient -lawmakers
london

the
british
government
s
clean
growth
strategy
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
will
not
be
enough
to
meet
legally
binding
climate
change
targets
a
committee
of
lawmakers
said
on
wednesday
the
strategy
launched
last
year
outlines
investment
in
research
and
innovation
to
help
reduce
emissions
which
lead
to
global
warming
britain
has
committed
to
cut
emissions
by
percent
by
compared
to
levels
and
must
produce
proposals
on
how
to
reach
its
climate
targets
as
part
of
carbon
budgets
set
every
five
years
although
the
amount
of
electricity
generated
from
energy
doubled
to
a
record
percent
last
year
from
there
are
signs
that
investment
might
have
stalled
in
the
past
two
years
the
environmental
audit
committee
said
in
a
report
annual
clean
energy
investment
in
britain
is
now
at
its
lowest
level
since
threatening
the
country
s
ability
to
meet
its
carbon
budgets
from
the
report
also
said
that
changes
to
energy
policies
in
has
undermined
investor
confidence
and
reduced
the
number
of
renewable
energy
projects
in
development
added
to
that
disruption
from
the
privatisation
of
the
green
investment
bank
which
was
set
up
by
the
government
in
to
spur
private
investment
in
green
projects
but
sold
to
a
consortium
led
by
macquarie
bank
last
year
and
a
reduction
in
european
investment
bank
lending
following
a
vote
to
leave
the
eu
might
also
have
contributed
to
the
dip
in
clean
energy
investment
the
government
must
urgently
plug
this
policy
gap
and
publish
its
plan
to
secure
the
investment
required
to
meet
the
uk
s
climate
change
targets
said
mary
creagh
chair
of
the
environmental
audit
committee
it
should
provide
greater
clarity
on
how
it
intends
to
deliver
the
clean
growth
strategy
by
the
budget
and
explore
how
a
sovereign
green
bond
could
kickstart
its
clean
growth
strategy
