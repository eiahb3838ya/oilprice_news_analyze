western
naphtha
shipments
to
asia
are
likely
to
hit
their
lowest
in
three
months
in
june
at
around
million
tonnes
crimped
by
refinery
maintenance
in
europe
traders
said
on
wednesday
the
monthly
decline
in
western
supply
would
come
amid
strong
demand
in
asia
with
the
region
s
naphtha
refining
profits
known
as
cracks
this
week
hitting
their
highest
seasonal
level
since
at
almost
per
tonne
asia
is
structurally
short
of
naphtha
a
feedstock
used
to
make
plastics
and
other
petrochemical
products
and
is
dependent
on
the
west
and
the
middle
east
to
fill
the
gap
although
there
remains
time
to
book
western
cargoes
for
june
to
asia
volumes
were
not
expected
to
increase
by
much
we
have
been
seeing
this
amount
of
million
in
the
last
two
to
three
weeks
and
it
could
stay
at
that
level
said
a
trader
at
a
company
that
regularly
deals
in
naphtha
he
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
with
media
the
monthly
average
for
arrivals
stands
around
million
tonnes
the
trader
added
that
asia
could
need
around
million
tonnes
of
naphtha
in
june
but
most
of
the
barrels
coming
in
were
heavier
grades
traders
had
expected
high
prices
for
crude
oil
used
as
a
feedstock
for
making
naphtha
to
curb
appetite
for
naphtha
but
demand
has
remained
robust
economic
growth
means
that
petrochemical
players
have
been
able
to
pass
higher
feedstock
costs
for
naphtha
down
the
value
chain
and
this
factor
should
continue
to
offset
the
effect
of
higher
underlying
crude
prices
overall
said
michael
head
of
research
at
consulting
firm
jbc
energy
crude
prices
hit
their
highest
levels
since
late
this
month
as
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
has
been
withholding
supplies
since
to
push
up
prices
and
as
the
united
states
has
announced
new
sanctions
against
major
crude
exporter
iran
supplies
from
the
middle
east
have
also
been
slow
the
thomson
reuters
oil
research
team
said
a
weekly
report
may
shipments
from
the
middle
east
at
up
to
million
tonnes
were
below
the
monthly
average
of
million
tonnes
according
to
the
report
the
effects
of
a
tight
market
have
sent
spot
premiums
for
indian
cargoes
of
naphtha
to
a
high
at
more
than
a
tonne
over
middle
east
quotes
on
a
fob
basis
however
any
weakness
in
gasoline
markets
could
sap
the
recent
in
prices
for
naphtha
which
can
also
be
used
as
a
blending
component
for
the
fuel
should
seasonal
gasoline
strength
into
the
summer
fail
to
materialise
then
that
would
be
a
good
reason
for
more
naphtha
to
price
out
of
the
gasoline
pool
causing
renewed
weakness
in
cracks
said
since
the
start
of
the
year
asian
gasoline
has
largely
been
in
a
contango
structure
where
prices
are
lower
than
those
for
later
delivery
implying
oversupply
