portugal
s
environmental
agency
gave
its
tacit
approval
on
wednesday
to
a
consortium
of
galp
energia
and
italy
s
eni
to
drill
an
oil
exploration
well
off
the
alentejo
region
s
coast
a
project
that
environmental
activists
are
trying
to
block
it
would
mark
the
resumption
of
drilling
in
portugal
after
a
long
hiatus
with
opponents
arguing
the
risks
outweigh
the
chances
of
finding
any
significant
quantities
of
oil
the
agency
said
it
had
not
identified
any
potentially
significant
negative
effects
on
the
environment
from
the
planned
well
and
would
not
order
a
specific
study
which
opponents
of
the
project
have
been
demanding
various
local
municipalities
politicians
and
activists
have
filed
lawsuits
and
petitions
to
try
and
block
oil
exploration
off
the
vicentine
coast
in
alentejo
which
boasts
beautiful
beaches
and
a
large
natural
park
several
oil
companies
spudded
a
few
dozen
exploration
wells
in
portugal
in
the
century
but
all
were
either
dry
or
showed
just
traces
of
hydrocarbons
drilling
activity
petered
out
in
the
early
although
seismic
studies
have
continued
portugal
s
galp
and
its
partner
at
the
time
brazil
s
petrobras
won
an
exploration
licence
in
for
three
blocks
in
the

hopes
to
drill
the
well
in
the
last

of
after
the
government
last
january
extended
the
exploration
period
for
a
year
the
expresso
newspaper
said
last
month
an
internal
study
by
the
consortium
pointed
to
potential
oil
reserves
of
up
to
billion
barrels
in
the
area
but
the
companies
would
not
publicly
confirm
such
estimates
saying
only
they
expected
to
find
hydrocarbons

on
seismic
studies

europe
last

named
portugal
the
winner
of
its
european
fossil
fuel
subsidies
for
handing
out
the
drilling
licence
near
its
protected
biodiversity
area
and
a

hotspot
