eu leaders explore ways to save iran economic ties from us sanctions
sofia
reuters
european
union
leaders
will
explore
options
on
wednesday
for
keeping
the
iran
nuclear
deal
alive
and
shielding
their
reviving
economic
cooperation
with
tehran
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
from
the
pact
but
the
eu
leaders
are
not
expected
to
make
any
quick
decisions
during
their
first
meeting
on
the
matter
since
trump
quit
the
accord
highlighting
how
clout
in
international
trade
and
finance
limits
the
europeans
scope
for
action
i
would
like
our
debate
to
reconfirm
without
any
doubt
that
as
long
as
iran
respects
the
provisions
of
the
deal
the
eu
will
also
respect
it
the
chairman
of
the
gathering
donald
tusk
said
before
the
meeting
in
the
bulgarian
capital
sofia
the
leaders
of
britain
france
and
germany
the
three
eu
signatories
of
the
deal
which
gave
iran
sanctions
relief
in
exchange
for
curbing
its
nuclear
programme
but
which
trump
dismissed
as
the
worst
deal
ever
will
brief
their
peers
the
head
of
the
bloc
s
executive
juncker
of
the
european
commission
will
also
present
options
the
leaders
have
to
shield
european
investments
in
iran
and
the
economic
cooperation
which
many
eu
states
hope
to
benefit
from
these
include
protecting
european
companies
dealing
with
iran
from
sanctions
which
in
practice
would
be
very
difficult
allowing
the
european
investment
bank
to
invest
there
and
coordinating
credit
lines
from
eu
states
foreign
ministers
of
germany
france
and
britain
met
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
in
brussels
on
that
on
tuesday
and
tasked
their
experts
to
come
up
with
measures
for
a
meeting
of
their
deputies
in
vienna
next
week
but
a
senior
eu
official
admitted
there
was
no
solution
and
that
it
might
take
some
time
for
the
bloc
to
come
up
with
what
is
expected
to
be
a
complex
matrix
of
national
and
measures
we
would
stay
calm
here
there
is
no
need
for
the
meeting
on
wednesday
to
take
decisions
on
specific
modalities
of
the
mechanisms
that
are
to
shield
the
interests
of
european
companies
the
official
said
but
when
it
comes
to
consensus
to
shield
economic
interests
in
iran
it
is
there
and
will
be
reconfirmed
on
the
eu
s
top
energy
official
commissioner
miguel
arias
canete
is
heading
to
iran
on
may
for
talks
on
energy
cooperation
a
symbolic
gesture
from
the
eu
that
it
wants
to
stay
engaged
despite
the
withdrawal
in
his
criticism
of
the
accord
which
the
other
signatories
russia
and
china
also
want
to
uphold
trump
has
said
it
did
not
go
far
enough
in
restraining
iran
s
ability
to
develop
nuclear
weapons
while
not
addressing
its
missile
programme
and
involvement
in
various
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
the
eu
has
since
sought
to
address
some
of
his
concerns
but
trump
was
not
convinced
and
his
move
left
the
eu
scrambling
to
salvage
an
accord
they
see
as
a
key
element
of
international
security
and
a
diplomatic
success
as
well
as
wondering
about
their
future
cooperation
with
washington
it
s
the
leaders
first
meeting
since
trump
s
announcement
it
s
too
early
for
specific
decisions
they
have
to
see
where
they
are
said
a
senior
eu
diplomat
we
want
to
do
this
that
s
for
sure
but
it
s
still
in
the
making
we
don
t
have
all
the
answers
yet
it
will
take
a
bit
