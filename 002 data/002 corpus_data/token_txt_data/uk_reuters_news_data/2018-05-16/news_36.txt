saudi
arabia
s
alawwal
bank
soared
on
wednesday
after
the
announcement
of
its
planned
merger
with
saudi
british
bank
while
most
gulf
stock
markets
closed
in
negative
territory
on
the
back
of
rising
geopolitical
concerns
the
general
weakness
was
in
line
with
asian
markets
which
slipped
on
wednesday
after
north
korea
called
off
talks
with
seoul
throwing
a
korean
summit
into
doubt
oil
prices
were
also
not
supportive
down
because
of
a
rise
in
crude
inventory
and
despite
ongoing
output
cuts
by
producer
group
opec
and
the
looming
sanctions
against
iran
in
saudi
arabia
the

lost
percent
with

in
the
oil

saudi
basic

sabic

but
banks
were
in
the
spotlight
as
saudi
british
bank
sabb
and
alawwal
bank
agreed
on
a
merger
that
once
completed
will
create
the
country
s
bank
with
assets
of
around
billion
over
the
last
months
we
have
seen
a
wave
of
consolidation
announcements
across
the
gcc
banking
sector
as
the
industry
struggles
to
identify
areas
of
growth
following
reduced
economic
activity
due
to
lower
oil
prices
said
salman
bajwa
senior

if

billion
in
what
would
be
the
first
major
banking
merger
in
the
kingdom
in
two
decades
the
announcement
on
wednesday
implied
a
valuation
premium
of
around
percent
on
the
shares
of
alawwal
bank
shares
in
alawwal
jumped
percent
to
riyals
in
its
heaviest
trade
since
april
while
sabb
shares
sank
percent
as
some
investors
bet
the
bank
was
overpaying

exercises
the
smaller
parties
tend
to
benefit
from
being
paid
premiums
by
the
bigger

is
certainly
true
