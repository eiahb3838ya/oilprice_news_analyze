oil
prices
fell
on
wednesday
weighed
down
by
ample

despite
ongoing

by

looming

crude
futures
the
international

were
at
per

at

down

intermediate

crude
futures
were
at
a

down

from
their

despite
the
dips
both
financial
oil
benchmarks
remained
close
to
their
november
highs
of
and
a
barrel
respectively
reached
the
previous
day
but
there
are
signs
in
physical

that
may
give

crude
oil
cargo
prices
are
at
their
steepest
discounts
to
futures
prices
in
years
as
sellers
are
struggling
to
find
buyers
for
west
african
russian
and
kazakh
cargoes
while
pipeline
bottlenecks
trap
supply
in
west
texas
and
canada
the
bottleneck
in
north
america
likely
contributed
to
a
million
barrel
rise
in
crude
oil
inventories
to
million
barrels
that
the
american
petroleum
institute
reported
on
tuesday
the
api
inventory
data
in
the
fits
with
a
topping
pattern
or
at
least
a
decent
pause
for
oil
prices
at
the
moment
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at
futures
brokerage
axitrader
despite
wednesday
s
dips
and
some
indicators
implying
the
financial
oil
has
overshot
physical
oil
overall
crude
market
conditions
have
tightened
since
when
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
started
to
withhold
supplies
to
push
up
oil
prices
with
renewed
sanctions
looming
against
iran
and
oil
demand
strong
analysts
said
crude
markets
will
likely
remain
relatively
tight
for
much
of
the
year
stronger
oil
prices
are
also
spilling
into
other
markets
a
rising
oil
price
brings
upside
price
risk
to
all
commodities

this

the

said
rising
diesel
prices
contributed
percent
to
cash
costs
in
the

and
sectors
while
the
price
of

also
significantly
contributed
to
power
generation
finally
transport

percent
of

will
also
rise
