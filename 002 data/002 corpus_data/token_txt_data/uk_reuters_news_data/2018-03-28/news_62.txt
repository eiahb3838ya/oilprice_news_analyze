there

and
that
the

said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief

at

securities
the
fang
a
quartet
of
tech
stocks
that
include
facebook
netflix
and
alphabet
have
been
a
darling
of
many
investors
concerns
about
trade
frictions
between
china
and
the
united
states
also
lingered
although
reports
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
spurred
some
optimism
it
would
be
in
china
s
interest
to
pursue
trade
rather
than
taking
retaliatory
actions
so
eventually
they
are
likely
to
avert
a
trade
war
and
strike
a
deal
that
will
please
president
donald
trump
and
increase
trade
said
hiroshi
watanabe
economist
at
sony
financial
holdings
the
market
is
still
nervous
and
there
s
feeling
you
never
know
what
trump
will

but
excessive
wariness
is
likely
to
gradually
wane

governing
council
member
said
that
underlying
inflation
in
the
euro
zone
may
remain
lower
than
expected
even
if
growth
is
robust
so
the
central
bank
needs
to
remain
patient
in

another

struck
a
similarly
