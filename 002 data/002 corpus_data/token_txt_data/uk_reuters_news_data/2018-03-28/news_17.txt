fell
more
than

after
reports
that
president
donald
trump
is
looking
to
target
the
company
by
changing
its
tax
treatment
that
came
a
day
after

shares
fell
on
data

concerns
and
nvidia
dropped
after
the
chipmaker
temporarily
suspended
tests
across

after

killed
a

there
is
a
sense
that
there
will
be
more
regulations
on

that

will
increase
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
the
report
that
beijing
plans
to
announce
retaliatory
tariffs
against
president
donald
trump
s
plans
for
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
goods
was
also
rekindling
worries
about
a
trade
war
while
the
market
remains
highly
vulnerable
to
news
headlines
like
this
reports
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
spurred
some
optimism
it
would
be
in
china
s
interest
to
pursue
trade
rather
than
taking
retaliatory
actions
so
eventually
they
are
likely
to
avert
a
trade
war
and
strike
a
deal
that
will
please
president
donald
trump
and
increase
trade
said
hiroshi
watanabe
economist
at
sony
financial
holdings
the
market
is
still
nervous
and
there
s
a
feeling
you
never
know
what
trump
will
do
but
excessive
wariness
is
likely
to
gradually
wane
he
added
in
the
currency
market
the
dollar
get
some
respite
from
its
recent
