demand
for
high
octane
gasoline
could
decline
if
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
changes
fuel
efficiency
rules
established
under
the
obama
administration
analysts
said
the
rules
negotiated
with
automakers
in
sought
to
double
average
fuel
efficiency
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
by
the
epa
plans
to
declare
by
april
that
the
rules
are
not
appropriate
thereby
allowing
the
trump
administration
to
reopen
vehicle
emissions
rules
two
officials
briefed
on
the
matter
said
on
friday
changes
to
the
fuel
efficiency
rules
could
lead
to
more
gasoline
usage
said
andrew
linhardt
deputy
legislative
director
for
transportation
with
the
sierra
club
in
washington
more
gasoline
usage
means
more
more
pollutants
in
the
air
dirtier
air
and
causing
more
climate
change
linhardt
said
in
recent
years
automakers
have
manufactured
more
models
that
operate
better
with
premium
gasoline
said
sandy
fielden
director
of
oil
and
products
research
at
morningstar
commodities
in
austin
texas
premium
gasoline
which
has
higher
levels
of
octane
extends
the
mileage
for
a
gallon
of
gas
thereby
making
it
more
efficient
the
increased
use
of
premium
gasoline
has
raised
octane
demand
said
patrick
dehaan
head
of
petroleum
analysis
at
gasbuddy
in
chicago
sales
of
premium
gasoline
as
a
percentage
of
total
motor
gasoline
have
steadily
risen
since
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
showed
in
premium
gasoline
sales
were
percent
of
total
motor
gasoline
sales
by
prime
suppliers
the
data
showed
in
the
most
recent
annual
data
available
premium
gasoline
s
market
share
increased
to
percent

premium
gasoline
for
physical
delivery
on
the
gulf
coast
traded
at
cents
a
gallon
above
the
futures
contract
on
nymex
traders
said
by
comparison
conventional
gasoline
traded
cents
below
the
futures
benchmark
if
the
epa
were
to
ease
fuel
efficiency
rules
manufacturers
could
reduce
produce
of
vehicles
with
engines
fielden
said
that
would
increase
the
amount
of
regular
gasoline
versus
premium
and
that
would
have
a
negative
or
neutral
effect
on
this
increase
in
the
octane
demand
in
the
market
