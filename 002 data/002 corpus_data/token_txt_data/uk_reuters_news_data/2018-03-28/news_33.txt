with
the
organization

the
petroleum
exporting
countries
in
previous
oil
gluts
to
rein
in
supplies
and
push
up
prices
but
a
to
deal
between
the
two
would
be
unprecedented
we
are
looking
for
a
very
cooperation
between
opec
and
producing
countries
barkindo
told
an
energy
conference
in
baghdad
opec

producer
might
have
oil
reserves
twice
as
big

current
estimates
of
about
billion
barrels
he
said
the
crude
market
was
stabilising
and
prices
had
improved
adding
that
a
decision
on
whether
to

beyond
depended
on
meetings
to
be
held
by
the
exporters

end
of
this
year
barkindo
said
opec
was
evaluating
the
impact
of
the
supply
pact
to
determine
the
appropriate
action
when
it
expired
in
addition
he
said
investment
in
the
oil
industry
was
increasing
as
oil
prices
recovered
but
had
not
yet
reached
the
level
before
the
downturn
