an
billion

could
trigger
a
wave
of
consolidation
in
the
permian
basin
oilfield
the
proposed
deal
is
the
largest
in
the
shale
patch
since
and
adds
momentum
to

shale
hub
permian
oil
production
has
soared
now
running
about
million
barrels
per
day
and
expected
to
grow
by
another
million
bpd
by
corporate
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
the
shale
patch
have
been
rare
since
the
oil
price
collapse
in
although
there
have
been
large
land
purchases
by
exxon
mobil
corp
oasis
petroleum
inc
and
others
that
could
soon
change
analysts
say
with
crude
prices
rising
to
above
a
barrel
we
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
the
larger
permian
players
leverage
their
market
premium
to
go
after
the
smaller
permian
producers
said
andrew
dittmar
senior
analyst
at
pls
a
data
provider
that
tracks
oilfield
mergers
and
acquisitions
smaller
companies
operating
in
the
permian
including
abraxas
petroleum
lilis
energy
and
jagged
peak
energy
could
be
targets
for
consolidation
he
said
concho
resources
bid
is
a
percent
premium
to
rsp
permian
s
closing
price
on
tuesday
the
per
acre
price
is
more
than
one
of
the
highest
in
the
permian
according
to
pls
concho
s
shares
fell
percent
to
while
rsp
s
were
up
about
percent
both
in
morning
trading
on
wednesday
last
year
exxon
agreed
to
pay
up
to
billion
to
double
its
permian
basin
holdings
and
oasis
petroleum
paid
million
in
cash
and
stock
or
about
an
acre
to
gain
a
permian
foothold
the
acquisition
allows
us
to
consolidate
premier
assets
that
seamlessly
fold
into
our
drilling
program
and
enhance
our
scale
advantage
concho
chief
executive
tim
leach
said
a
deal
would
add
about
acres
in
the
permian
increasing
concho
s
total
to
and
lift
its
potential
resources
to
about
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
the
companies
said
the
combined
company
will
be
percent
owned
by
concho
and
have
rigs
in
the
permian
running
the
largest
drilling
and
completion
program
there
rsp
shareholders
will
get
of
concho
shares
for
each
of
their
shares
worth
about
per
share
the
deal
is
subject
to
approval
by
shareholders
of
both
companies
and
expected
to
close
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year
obviously
it
s
a
good
marker
for
the

chief

charles
stanley
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
the
scotia
howard
weil
energy
conference
in
new
orleans
his
company
recently
said
it
would
sell
assets
in
north
dakota
and
louisiana
and
focus
on
the
permian
basin
allowing
qep
to
more
quickly
cover
its
capital
expenses
by
production
the
oil
industry
has
been
discussing
the
merits
of
merging
resources
in
the
busy
permian
basin
as
a
way
to
reduce
operating
costs
and
increasing
shareholder
returns
costs
for
fracking
service
are
rising
about
percent
to
percent
as
more
companies
expand
drilling
to
take
advantage
of
higher
crude
prices
the
companies
said
including
debt
the
value
of
the
deal
is
billion
the
equity
value
of
the
deal
was
calculated
based
on
million
outstanding
shares
of
rsp
this
is
a
significant
acquisition
and
a
lot
of
synergies
that
make
sense
said
rbc
analyst
scott
hanold
adding
the
percent
premium
was
a
reasonable
price
to
pay
the
acquisition
is
likely
to
add
to
concho
s
earnings
in
the
first
year
after
the
deal
closes
