california attorney general says ready to defend vehicle efficiency standards
washington
march
reuters
california
is
prepared
to
sue
the
environmental
protection
agency
if
it
tries
to
weaken
vehicle
efficiency
standards
the
state
s
attorney
general
said
on
tuesday
setting
up
another
in
a
series
of
legal
fights
between
sacramento
and
the
trump
administration
the
epa
is
expected
to
declare
by
april
that
current
rules
aimed
at
doubling
average
fuel
efficiency
to
about
miles
km
per
gallon
by
are
not
appropriate
sources
told
reuters
last
week
the
declaration
would
enable
the
epa
to
take
steps
to
weaken
those
federal
standards
which
had
been
implemented
by
the
administration
of
former
president
barack
obama
a
democrat
with
the
backing
of
automakers
we
are
going
to
do
everything
that
can
been
done
to
defend
these
standards
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
told
reuters
in
an
interview
so
far
when
we
have
been
challenged
on
environmental
standards
we
have
had
a
good
record
in
court
we
haven
t
lost
a
in
california
s
air
emissions
regulator
and
the
obama
administration
reached
an
agreement
with
major
automakers
to
nearly
double
average
fleetwide
fuel
efficiency
by
but
included
a
midterm
review
to
determine
by
april
whether
the
final
requirements
were
feasible
but
if
the
administration
of
republican
president
donald
trump
weakens
federal
auto
efficiency
standards
then
california
the
most
populous
state
and
a
massive
market
for
automakers
could
enforce
its
own
stricter
rules
that
nearly
a
dozen
other
states
including
new
york
would
follow
carmakers
are
worried
that
such
a
dispute
would
lead
to
a
patchwork
of
different
standards
across
the
country
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
told
reuters
in
january
that
california
doesn
t
have
the
authority
to
set
the
standards
for
the
rest
of
the
country
leading
some
officials
in
the
state
to
worry
the
administration
could
attempt
to
revoke
sacramento
s
authority
to
set
its
own
rules
epa
spokeswoman
liz
bowman
confirmed
its
recommendation
is
under
interagency
review
and
will
be
completed
by
the
april
deadline
becerra
said
he
is
confident
courts
would
side
with
california
if
epa
tries
to
weaken
the
federal
standards
or
further
down
the
road
undercut
the
state
s
special
authority
under
the
federal
clean
air
act
to
set
its
own
we
are
not
yet
at
round
one
and
we
think
we
have
some
good
knockout
punches
for
the
next
rounds
