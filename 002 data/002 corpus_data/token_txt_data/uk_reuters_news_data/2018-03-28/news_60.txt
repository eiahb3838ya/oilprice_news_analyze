coking
coal
futures
in

peaked
at
a
tonne
in

when
china
s
pollution
controls
were
in
force
but
have
since
tailed
back
by
nearly
a
fifth
to
after
curbs
expired
mid
month
we
continue
to
see
coking
coal
as
a
beneficiary
of
the
chinese
reforms
both
from
a
lower
chinese
domestic
production
perspective
but
also
from
the
implications
from
environmental
reforms
