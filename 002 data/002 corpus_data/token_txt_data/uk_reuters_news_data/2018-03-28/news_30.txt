recent
price
gyrations
for
iron
ore
in
china
caused
by
swings
in
sentiment
over
president
donald
trump
s
tariffs
on
steel
are
masking
a
broader
downward
trend
in
recent
days
spot
iron
ore
prices
in
the
world
s
largest
importer
have
alternated
between
slumping
as
trade
war
fears
mount
or
rallying
as
these
same
fears
moderate
the
price
action
is
being
driven
by
the
news
cycle
and
the
seeming
chaotic
way
in
which
the
trump
administration
is
implementing
its
trade
policies
the
spot
price
at
china
s
qingdao
port
for
percent
iron
ore
as
assessed
by
argus
media
rose
percent
on
tuesday
to
close
at
a
tonne
while
the
price
for
the
same
grade
as
assessed
by
metal
bulletin
rose
percent
to
end
at
on
the
dalian
commodity
exchange
benchmark
iron
ore
futures
increased
percent
to
close
at
yuan
a
tonne
while
shanghai
steel
rebar
futures
gained
percent
to
yuan
these
small
gains
came
amid
signs
that
the
trump
administration
and
the
authorities
in
beijing
may
be
prepared
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
to
avoid
a
trade
war
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
told
visiting
lawmakers
on
tuesday
that
beijing
is
working
towards
dialogue
with
the
united
states
on
trade
but
is
prepared
for
a
trade
war
state
television
reported
the
gains
also
came
as
another
country
south
korea
appeared
to
reach
a
deal
to
avoid
the
implementation
of
the
trump
administration
s
tariffs
of
percent
on
steel
imports
and
percent
on
aluminium
a
pattern
seems
to
have
emerged
since
trump
first
announced
the
planned
tariffs
on
march
in
which
prices
for
the
targeted
commodities
first
decline
on
the
initial
news
then
recover
somewhat
as
it
becomes
clearer
that
the
united
states
will
provide
exemptions
to
certain
nations
but
it
s
also
important
to
note
that
prices
don
t
recover
nearly
as
much
as
they
slump
spot
iron
ore
was
at
a
tonne
on
march
the
day
before
trump
s
announcement
after
which
it
fell
for
straight
days
to
end
at
on
march
a
recovery
over
the
next
few
days
saw
it
end
a
tonne
on
march
before
starting
to
fall
again
this
time
dropping
to
on
march
a
small
increase
to
a
tonne
on
march
was
ended
by
trump
s
announcement
of
planned
tariffs
on
some
billion
of
chinese
goods
which
sparked
the
retreat
to
on
march
a
low
while
it
s
easy
to
be
caught
up
in
the
daily
news
cycle
especially
given
the
dramatic
nature
of
the
twists
and
turns
of
trump
s
announcements
and
subsequent
developments
it
should
not
distract
from
the
overall
picture
spot
iron
ore
prices
have
effectively
been
in
retreat
since
late
february
and
are
down
percent
since
the
peak
on
a
combination
of
a
market
and
some
easing
of
optimism
over
china
s
steel
demand
as
well
as
record
high
inventories
at
chinese
ports
have
contributed
to
the
overall
bearish
market
at
last
week
s
global
iron
ore
and
steel
forecast
conference
in
perth
a
poll
of
the
participants
found
that
the
average
price
forecast
for
was
around
a
tonne
an
average
price
of
for
suggests
that
the
price
may
be
below
that
level
for
some
time
during
the
year
given
it
has
spent
most
of
the
first
quarter
above
the
forecast
the
majority
of
the
delegates
were
either
iron
ore
miners
contractors
or
traders
with
not
many
buyers
in
evidence
meaning
that
those
making
the
forecasts
stood
to
benefit
most
from
higher
prices
the
modest
price
forecast
suggests
that
the
industry
is
bracing
itself
for
tougher
times
without
expecting
a
collapse
in
demand
this
reflects
the
view
that
china
s
steel
demand
will
be
relatively
stable
this
year
and
output
likely
to
remain
near
the
million
tonnes
