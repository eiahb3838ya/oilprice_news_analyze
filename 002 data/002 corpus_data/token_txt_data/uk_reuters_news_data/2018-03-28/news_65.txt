hedge
funds
had
turned
more
bullish
on
the
outlook
for
petroleum
prices
even
before
the
decision
to
replace
the
president
s
national
security
adviser
with
an
hawk
was
announced
on
thursday
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
increased
their
net
long
position
in
the
six
most
important
futures
and
options
contracts
linked
to
petroleum
prices
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
march
the
combined
increase
was
the
largest
since
the
end
of
october
and
reversed
a
draw
of
million
barrels
over
the
two
previous
weeks
according
to
records
published
by
regulators
and
exchanges
fund
managers
now
hold
a
net
long
position
of
billion
barrels
across
brent
nymex
and
ice
wti
gasoline
heating
oil
and
european

the
combined
net
long

is
million

below
the

billion

set
on

more
than
four
times
higher
than
the
recent
low
of
million

at
the
end

hedge

positioning
remains
extremely
lopsided
with
almost
all

expecting

for

the
ratio
on
record
after

almost
no
one
seems
willing
to
bet
against
the
trend
short
positions
across
the
complex
have
declined
to
just
million
barrels
the
lowest
level
since
may
in
some
parts
of
the
complex
positioning
has
become
even
more
extreme
in

long

million
barrels
outnumber
short

million
by
a
ratio
of
almost
the
current
positioning
across
the
complex
is
a
classic
example
of
a
market
that
has
become
locked
with
all
traders
trying
to
position
themselves
the
same
way
locking
often
precedes
a
sharp
reduction
in
liquidity
an
increase
in
volatility
and
an
eventual
reversal
in
the
price
trend

as

with

few
