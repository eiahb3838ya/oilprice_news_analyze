refile-saudis likely to show restraint as yemen crisis escalates
riyadh
reuters
a
missile
attack
this
week
on
riyadh
has
raised
the
risk
of
an
escalation
in
the
yemen
war
in
a
region
riven
with
interwoven
conflicts
but
a
direct
confrontation
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran
still
appears
unlikely
saudi
arabia
s
powerful
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
now
touring
the
united
states
must
balance
animosity
towards
iran
with
the
need
for
stability
as
he
pitches
the
kingdom
s
economic
transformation
plan
to
foreign
investors
and
drums
up
support
for
containing
iran
s
regional
influence
however
iranian
authorities
facing
the
prospect
of
a
more
hawkish
administration
with
donald
trump
s
appointments
last
week
of
john
bolton
and
mike
pompeo
as
national
security
adviser
and
secretary
of
state
might
crank
up
pressure
in
the
yemen
war
as
a
form
of
deterrence
diplomats
and
analysts
say
saudi
arabia
sharpened
its
rhetoric
against
tehran
after
saudi
forces
shot
down
a
flurry
of
missiles
launched
by
the
houthis
on
saudi
cities
late
on
sunday
one
of
the
missiles
caused
the
war
s
first
casualties
in
the
saudi
capital
riyadh
when
falling
debris
struck
a
home
and
killed
an
egyptian
man
and
injured
two
others
saudi
king
salman
in
comments
carried
by
state
media
pledged
on
tuesday
to
firmly
and
decisively
thwart
any
hostile
attempts
targeting
the
kingdom
s
security
and
stability
a
day
earlier
the
spokesman
for
the
coalition
fighting
the
houthi
movement
accused
it
of
using
missiles
and
said
that
saudi
arabia
reserved
the
right
to
respond
to
iran
when
and
how
it
deemed
appropriate
the
coalition
intervened
in
yemen
in
march
in
a
campaign
to
restore
its
internationally
recognised
government
after
it
was
driven
into
exile
by
houthi
forces
iran
is
the
appendicitis
in
the
body
of
the
world
and
should
fix
itself
or
else
the
world
will
fix
the
iranian
situation
spokesman
colonel
turki
said
iran
has
repeatedly
denied
giving
missiles
to
the
houthis
analysts
said
that
in
the
short
term
the
saudi
leadership
is
unlikely
to
respond
aggressively
amid
increased
international
scrutiny
of
the
yemen
conflict
which
has
given
rise
to
the
world
s
most
urgent
humanitarian
crisis
prince
mohammed
would
like
to
be
viewed
as
a
more
restrained
and
composed
leader
while
touring
his
closest
western
ally
the
united
states
according
to
ehsan
khomen
mena
strategist
at
mufg
consultancy
he
may
leverage
the
recent
houthi
missile
attacks
to
strengthen
his
narrative
that
iran
s
encroachment
is
undermining
regional
stability
and
that
a
more
concerted
international
effort
is
needed
to
contain
the
yemen
conflict
pits
a
coalition
of
states
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
against
the
houthis
who
are
sympathetic
to
iran
but
deny
being
a
pawn
of
its
shi
ite
muslim
theocracy
yemen
s
war
fits
into
a
broader
struggle
for
supremacy
between
middle
east
powerhouses
iran
and
saudi
arabia
which
fund
and
train
proxy
forces
in
iraq
syria
and
lebanon
and
accuse
each
other
of
backing
terrorism
military
escalation
in
response
to
the
latest
rocket
salvo
could
mean
more
coalition
air
strikes
which
have
been
widely
criticised
for
killing
civilians
or
mobilising
the
saudi
national
guard
from
a
mostly
static
position
along
the
border
to
undertake
a
concerted
ground
assault
inside
northern
yemen
diplomats
and
analysts
say
that
the
coalition
has
few
other
options
short
of
direct
action
against
an
iranian
target
something
that
remains
unlikely
unless
a
houthi
rocket
takes
out
a
valuable
saudi
asset
last
year
when
the
houthis
fired
missiles
at
riyadh
that
were
intercepted
the
coalition
responded
by
shutting
yemen
s
airports
and
ports
the
united
nations
said
that
blockade
raised
the
danger
of
mass
starvation
and
it
was
partially
lifted
they
may
make
similar
moves
in
order
to
be
seen
to
be
doing
something
but
it
won
t
really
change
the
dynamics
of
the
conflict
said
jane
kinninmont
middle
east
expert
at
chatham
house
in
london
my
concern
is
that
they
could
be
tempted
to
take
some
action
directly
against
some
iranian
target
and
that
any
such
course
of
action
could
escalate
consultancy
eurasia
group
said
that
a
successful
houthi
strike
on
a
prized
saudi
target
would
probably
prompt
a
firm
military
response
from
riyadh
to
try
to
deter
iran
analysts
said
that
while
a
direct
showdown
is
unlikely
miscalculation
remains
a
risk
western
countries
have
urged
saudi
arabia
and
its
gulf
arab
allies
to
protect
civilians
and
find
a
quick
end
to
yemen
s
war
but
they
also
support
riyadh
s
argument
that
it
needs
to
defend
itself
from
strikes
and
limit
the
spread
of
iran
s
imprint
in
territory
overlooking
important
trade
routes
the
united
nations
says
more
than
people
have
died
in
the
war
and
million
yemenis
of
the
population
need
relief
aid
more
than
million
cholera
cases
have
been
reported
the
worst
outbreak
in
modern
history
analysts
said
that
while
saudi
arabia
will
probably
double
down
on
its
military
campaign
in
yemen
to
oust
the
houthis
from
the
capital
sanaa
and
reinstate
president
abd
rabbu
mansour
it
may
continue
to
support
mediation
efforts
however
the
appointments
of
bolton
and
pompeo
in
washington
could
encourage
iran
to
ramp
up
activities
in
yemen
to
signal
its
ability
and
willingness
to
undermine
the
united
states
and
its
partners
eurasia
group
said
economists
have
played
down
the
impact
of
the
houthi
attacks
on
the
saudi
economy
which
prince
mohammed
is
trying
to
wean
off
oil
exports
with
a
slate
of
reforms
that
include
cutting
energy
subsidies
and
expanding
the
private
sector
investors
may
have
already
largely
priced
in
risks
from
houthi
missile
strikes
but
an
intensification
of
the
yemen
conflict
and
certainly
an
escalation
to
direct
conflict
between
iran
and
saudi
arabia
could
scare
off
foreign
investors
