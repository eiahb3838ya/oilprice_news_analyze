new brazil tests confirm heavy metals near alunorte; hydro pushes back
sao

march
reuters
a
brazilian
institute
said
on
wednesday
that
new
testing
confirmed
elevated
levels
of
heavy
metals
in
waters
near
the
world
s
largest
alumina
refinery
run
by
norsk
hydro
asa
but
the
company
for
the
first
time
questioned
the
validity
of
the
scientific
work
marcelo
lima
a
public
health
researcher
at
the
evandro
chagas
institute
a
research
facility
linked
to
brazil
s
health
ministry
told
reporters
the
testing
confirmed
earlier
findings
of
elevated
levels
of
aluminum
lead
and
other
contaminates
in
surface
waters
near
populated
areas
around
the
alunorte
plant
hydro
in
an
emailed
statement
pointed
to
serious
technical
and
methodological
failings
by
the
institute
and
noted
inconsistencies
in
the
data
on
chemical
levels
found
in
surface
water
in
a
february
study
run
by
lima
the
company
which
has
been
forced
to
cut
production
following
allegations
of
a
toxic
leak
and
could
soon
shut
down
three
of
seven
alumina
lines
also
questioned
the
readiness
of
the
chagas
institute
to
carry
out
such
testing
hydro
said
its
own
evaluations
had
found
no
evidence
of
pollution
the
evandro
chagas
institute
in
an
emailed
statement
acknowledged
errors
in
its
february
report
which
played
a
key
role
in
a
state
court
ruling
that
forced
alunorte
to
run
at
percent
of
its
capacity
but
the
institute
said
that
the
errors
were
typographical
the
testing
itself
was
correct
and
conclusions
drawn
from
their
work
remains
valid
a
february
thunderstorm
dropped
millimeters
inches
of
rain
in
hours
on
the
alunorte
plant
causing
red
water
to
flood
streets
homes
and
areas
of
the
amazon
rain
forest
near
the
plant
drawing
the
attention
of
authorities
hydro
said
it
was
undertaking
a
detailed
investigation
into
what
happened
in
alunorte
during
the
extreme
rainfall
in
february
and
would
release
its
own
evaluation
on
april
based
on
the
work
of
internal
and
outside
expert
groups
alunorte
transforms
bauxite
into
alumina
which
is
turned
into
aluminum
at
huge
smelters
hydro
declared
force
majeure
at
the
alunorte
unit

early
