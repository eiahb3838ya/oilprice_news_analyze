shanghai
crude
oil
futures
isc
slumped
on
wednesday
the
third
day
of
trading
since
their
launch
after
heavy
selling
overnight
as
traders
scrambled
to
follow
cues
from
the
main
international
markets
the
big
volumes
done
in
the
late
evening
in
china
underscore
the
complexity
of
trading
the
new
contract
when
london
s
brent
lco
and
wti
in
the
united
states
cl
are
in
full
swing
with
shanghai
s
relatively
low
liquidity
exaggerating
the
price
swings
in
the
first
two
hours
of
the
night
session
which
started
at
beijing
time
gmt
on
tuesday
and
marks
the
beginning
of
a
new
trading
day
prices
sank
percent
to
yuan
per
barrel
over
lots
of
barrels
each
of
shanghai
crude
changed
hands
in
that
time
more
than
half
the
turnover
for
the
day
the
price
drop
was
much
steeper
than
those
seen
in
europe
and
the
united
states
where
prices
were
down
under
percent
after
data
showed
a
surprising
rise
in
crude
inventories
it
was
all
the
more
jarring
for
many
traders
in
china
who
rushed
to
catch
up
with
the
overnight
action
on
wednesday
morning
as
shanghai
s
second
session
was
starting
at
that
highlighted
concerns
among
many
traders
about
the
of
the
contract
with
the
exchange
splitting
trading
into
three
slots
punctuated
by
long
breaks
while
brent
and
wti
keep
trading
it
s
early
days
for
shanghai
crude
exchange
it
should
have
a
good
potential
but
it
would
probably
be
good
if
opening
hours
were
extended

it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
caused
the
hefty
drop
although
some
traders
said
it
was
due
to
a
stronger
yuan
a
stronger
yuan
would
make
investing
in
the
contract
for
holders
of
other
currencies
more
expensive
other
traders
said
the
storage
data
also
hurt
sentiment
but
the
relatively
low
open
interest
which
measures
contracts
that
have
yet
to
be
settled
caused
big
gyrations
on
wednesday
september
open
interest
was
lots
the
exchange
counts
both
sides
of
the
trade
which
means
it
was
actually
lots
that
compares
with
half
a
million
lots
for
brent
given
the
limited
liquidity
and
also
the
perception
that
the
chinese
national
oil
companies
are
on
the
sell
side
were
emboldened
said
a
trader
with
a
western
trading
house
we
are
talking
about
only
thousands
of
lots
of
open
interest
not
hundreds
of
thousands
that
got
people
worried
that
deliveries
would
be

through
the
morning
and
afternoon
sessions
with
the

falling
almost

a
final
