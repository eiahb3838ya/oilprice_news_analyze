hamburg
reuters
demand
for
shipping
is
growing
and
could
outpace
the
supply
of
new
vessels
next
year
helping
to
boost
profits
at
as
it
also
reaps
the
benefits
of
a
recent
merger
the
german
company
said
on
wednesday
the
shipping
industry
has
been
in
the
doldrums
for
years
as
a
slump
in
trade
following
the
global
financial
crisis
coincided
with
the
delivery
of
scores
of
new
vessels
ordered
earlier
that
sparked
a
wave
of
deals
as
firms
looked
to
cut
costs
including
s
recent
purchase
of
gulf
peer
uasc
to
become
the
world
s
fifth
biggest
container
shipping
company
however
the
firm
s
ceo
rolf
habben
jansen
said
on
wednesday
that
order
books
for
new
vessels
were
now
relatively
small
compared
with
the
economic
growth
that
drives
seaborne
transport
demand
the
idle
fleet
is
also
small
and
demand
is
growing
that
makes
us
cautiously
optimistic
he
told
journalists
after
the
company
announced
a
surprise
dividend
and
forecast
a
rise
in
annual
earnings
in
we
are
confident
that
we
can
improve
profitability
further
and
reduce
our
debts
while
the
realization
of
synergies
from
the
uasc
deal
is
also
in
focus
he
added
habben
jansen
upheld
a
january
forecast
for
global
container
transport
demand
growth
of
percent
in
and
more
than
percent
in
demand
and
supply
could
be
balanced
this
year
even
though
the
first
half
will
see
more
ships
joining
the
fleet
but
supply
may
start
falling
short
of
demand
from
next
year
he
said
said
to
percent
of
the
million
in
annual
savings
targeted
over
the
long
term
from
its
with
uasc
were
due
to
be
realized
this
year
habben
jansen
reiterated
the
savings
could
eventually
exceed
the
target
but
he
would
only
be
able
to
provide
details
in
the
second
half
of
said
it
would
pay
shareholders
a
dividend
of
euro
per
share
for
after
its
core
profit
ebitda
nearly
doubled
to
billion
euros
billion
it
forecast
a
rise
in
ebitda
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortization
and
operating
profit
ebit
a
concern
however
is
rising
shipping
fuel
costs
driven
by
an
increase
in
crude
oil
prices
shipping
fuel
costs
are
currently
around
percent
above
