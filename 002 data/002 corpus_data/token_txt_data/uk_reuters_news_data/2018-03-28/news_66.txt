has
a
comfortable
lead
in

polls
said
that
if
he
wins
the
july
vote
he
would
review
more
than
contracts
signed
since

passed
legislation
in
ending
the
monopoly
of
state
energy
firm
pemex
running
for
office
for
a
third

future
of
the
oil

gas
opening
i
think
you
could
see
a
slowdown
if

i
think
they
will
see
the
benefits
of
the

coming
in

the
invigoration
of
new
ideas

new

the
patchy
interest
on
the
quantity
of
natural
gas
in
some
of
the

saying
companies

more
interested

this
will
continue
to
be
a
