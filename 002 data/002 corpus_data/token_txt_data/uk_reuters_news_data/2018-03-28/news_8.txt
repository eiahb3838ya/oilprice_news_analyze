reuters
germany
s
decision
to
expel
russian
diplomats
has
split
the
social
democrats
spd
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
coalition
partner
undermining
her
tough
stance
on
moscow
just
two
weeks
into
a
new
government
berlin
is
sending
four
diplomats
back
to
russia
joining
other
european
states
the
united
states
and
others
in
a
concerted
response
to
a
nerve
agent
attack
on
a
former
russian
spy
in
england
which
britain
blames
on
russia
moscow
denies
any
involvement
we
must
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
a
new
cold
war
with
russia
social
democrat
gernot
erler
government
coordinator
for
russia
told
the
passauer
neue
presse
he
said
germany
had
a
clear
and
unshakeable
position
but
we
want
to
stay
in
dialogue
with
moscow
while
there
is
broad
consensus
on
the
response
at
the
top
of
merkel
s
conservatives
and
the
spd
uneasiness
among
members
of
the
spd
is
growing
russia
will
likely
be
a
key
topic
when
merkel
gathers
her
cabinet
for
a
retreat
at
a
castle
about
km
miles
north
of
berlin
on
april
to
map
out
priorities
for
the
year
the
chancellor
has
regularly
convened
such
meetings
to
allow
deeper
discussions
far
from
the
berlin
limelight
the
alternative
for
germany
afd
and
radical
left
parties
have
already
criticised
the
government
s
stance
on
russia
and
german
business
groups
have
also
sounded
warnings
merkel
who
has
a
difficult
relationship
with
putin
and
her
spd
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
have
repeatedly
called
on
russia
to
cooperate
over
the
attack
in
england
merkel
says
it
is
almost
certain
russia
was
behind
the
attack
and
that
germany
stands
by
britain
some
prominent
spd
members
have
gone
further
than
erler
who
stopped
short
of
criticising
the
government
former
european
commissioner
guenter
verheugen
said
any
sanctions
should
be
based
on
facts
not
suspicions
the
view
that
if
in
doubt
putin
and
the
russians
are
responsible
for
everything
is
one
that
poisons
thought
and
must
stop
he
told
the
augsburger
allgemeine
daily
former
foreign
minister
sigmar
gabriel
said
verheugen
s
comment
showed
courage
and
a
cool
head
while
dissent
among
merkel
s
conservatives
was
muted
business
groups
are
worried
sales
to
russia
rose
last
year
for
the
first
time
since
when
sanctions
over
moscow
s
role
in
the
ukraine
crisis
dented
what
was
a
billion
export
trade
exports
in
the
first
months
of
last
year
were
billion
euros
germany
also
needs
russia
for
roughly
a
third
of
the
gas
it
uses
and
on
tuesday
it
said
it
had
approved
the
construction
and
operation
of
the
nordstream
gas
pipeline
the
german
committee
on
east
european
economic
relations
warned
against
