a
brazilian
court
has
blocked
the
inclusion
of
two
top
quality
blocks
in
an
oil
auction
this
week
the
mining
and
oil
ministry
said
on
wednesday
adding
that
it
plans
to
include
the
areas
in
future
auctions
this
year
oil
secretary
marcio
felix
said
the
government
would
seek
to
undo
the
decision
without
providing
details
but
he
said
success
was
unlikely
before
the
round
on
thursday
which
will
grant
companies
concessions
to
explore
and
produce
in
the
areas
the
move
casts
a
big
shadow
over
the
auction
by
removing
some
of
its
most
acreage
the
two
blocks
withdrawn
from
thursday
s
auction
are
located
in
the
offshore
santos
basin
and
boasted
minimum
signing
bonuses
of
billion
reais
million
and
billion
reias
each
both
areas
were
thought
to
include
geology
from
brazil
s
coveted
play
where
billions
of
barrels
of
oil
are
buried
under
thousands
of
feet
of
salt
beneath
the
ocean
floor
the
blocks
also
lie
close
to
the
saturno
block
which
is
slated
to
be
auctioned
in
june
by
law
blocks
within
the
polygon
must
be
auctioned
through
agreements
where
companies
compete
to
offer
the
government
the
biggest
share
of
profit
oil
after
costs
felix
said
the
court
s
rationale
was
centered
on
the
fact
that
the
government
could
make
more
money
if
it
auctioned
off
the
two
areas
through
production
sharing
arrangements
instead
of
concessions
