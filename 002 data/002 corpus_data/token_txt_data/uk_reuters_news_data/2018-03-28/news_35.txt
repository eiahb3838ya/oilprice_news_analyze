petroleum
corporation
ltd
bpcl
plans
to
build
a
billion
petrochemical
unit
to
serve
the
mumbai
region
a
company
official
said
to
profit
from
the
country
s
expected
surge
in
demand
for
petrochemicals
as
its
economy
expands
bpcl
s
expansion
is
part
of
a
national
plan
to
spend
billion
on
petrochemical
production
in
order
to
meet
the
expected
increase
in
consumption
of
the
chemicals
for
products
including
plastics
paints
and
adhesives
india
currently
only
produces
about
million
tonnes
a
year
of
petrochemicals
less
than
the
million
tonnes
of
demand
expected
for
the
financial
year
demand
is
expected
to
almost
double
again
within
a
decade
according
to
a
report
from
the
ministry
of
petroleum
and
natural
gas
bpcl
earlier
this
month
bought
acres
hectares
of
land
from
a
fertiliser
unit
of
hindustan
organic
chemicals
ltd
hindustan
organic
said
in
a
notice
to
the
bombay
stock
exchange
on
march
the
land
will
allow
bpcl
to
build
a
petrochemical
complex
that
will
use
feedstocks
from
its
mumbai
refinery
which
processes
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
ramachandran
head
of
refineries
at
bpcl
told
reuters
this
week
the
site
is
about
km
miles
from
the
refinery
this
land
deal
is
fundamental
to
enhancing
our
petrochemical
portfolio
said
ramachandran
going
forward
petchem
consumption
is
likely
to
be
higher
than
the
conventional
fuels
so
it
is
better
if
we
start
thinking
in
that
direction
to
transport
feedstock
to
the
new
petrochemical
complex
ramachandran
said
there
was
a
plan
to
build
a
pipeline
from
the
refinery
to
a
nearby
port
and
tankers
would
then
deliver
the
feedstock
to
the
facility
alternatively
he
said
a
direct
pipeline
between
the
mumbai
refinery
and
the
petrochemical
facility
could
be
built
he
said
the
facility
would
focus
on
producing
propylene
but
also
produce
polyethylene
at
lower
quantities
ramachandran
told
reuters
the
company
had
not
been
able
to
expand
the
mumbai
refinery
for
the
petrochemical
site
because
of
limited
land
availability
in
the
city
the
petrochemical
complex
will
be
ready
by
he
said
bpcl
plans
to
pump
feedstocks
from
the
mumbai
refinery
by
pipeline
to
a
nearby
port
to
load
onto
tankers
that
will
then
carry
it
to
the
petrochemical
complex
said
a
source
familiar
with
the
matter
bpcl
already
produces
petrochemicals
at
its
bpd
kochi
refinery
in
southern
india
bpcl
is
also
constructing
a
billion
rupees
million
project
at
kochi
to
produce
chemicals
like
acryl
and
acrylic
acid
used
in
products
like
paints
adhesives
or
textiles
which
ramachandran
said
would
be
commissioned
next
year
bpcl
also
plans
to
build
a
petrochemical
plant
at
its
bpd
bina
refinery
in
central
india
we
are
targeting
petrochemical
production
equivalent
to
to
percent
of
our
crude
processing
in
the
long
run
