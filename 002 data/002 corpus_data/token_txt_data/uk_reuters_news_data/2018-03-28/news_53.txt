reuters
softbank
group
corp
s
vision
fund
will
invest
in
creating
the
world
s
biggest
solar
power
project
in
saudi
arabia
it
said
on
tuesday
stepping
up
its
involvement
in
the
kingdom
and
expanding
beyond
technology
the
project
is
expected
to
have
the
capacity
to
produce
up
to
gigawatts
gw
by
softbank
chief
executive
masayoshi
son
told
reporters
in
new
york
that
would
add
to
around
gw
of
globally
installed
solar
power
capacity
and
is
comparable
to
the
world
s
total
nuclear
power
capacity
of
around
gw
as
of
the
end
of
by
investing
in
solar
power
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
biggest
oil
exporter
can
reduce
the
amount
of
crude
it
currently
uses
to
generate
power
and
increase
its
overseas
shipments
the
move
illustrates
the
commitment
by
the
de
facto
saudi
ruler
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
to
transform
the
country
s
economic
status
quo
the
final
investment
total
for
the
gw
of
generation
including
the
solar
panels
battery
storage
and
a
manufacturing
facility
for
panels
in
saudi
arabia
will
eventually
total
around
billion
billion
pounds
son
said
the
initial
phase
of
the
project
for
gw
of
solar
capacity
will
cost
billion
with
billion
coming
from
softbank
s
vision
fund
and
the
rest
from
project
financing
he
said
saudi
arabia
s
vision
reform
plan
which
aims
to
reduce
the
country
s
economic
dependence
on
oil
was
a
good
match
for
the
fund
s
vision
for
innovation
said
son
these
two
visions
have
come
together
to
create
clean
sustainable
and
productive
renewable
energy
he
said
the
kingdom
has
great
sunshine
great
size
of
available
land
and
great
engineers
despite
being
one
of
the
world
s
sunniest
countries
saudi
arabia
generates
most
of
its
electricity
from
power
plants
saudi
s
entire
installed
power
capacity
is
currently
around
gw
adding
gw
would
create
enormous
excess
capacity
that
could
be
exported
to
neighbours
or
used
by
industry
although
the
kingdom
will
still
require
other
forms
of
power
generation
for
industry
estimates
say
around
to
barrels
per
day
of
crude
oil
are
burnt
for
saudi
power
generation
exporting
that
oil
could
increase
saudi
s
annual
oil
revenues
by
between
billion
and
billion
at
the
current
price
for
benchmark
brent
oil
of
almost
per
barrel
fuel
saudi
arabia
is
clearly
preparing
for
a
fuel
dependent
economy
in
terms
of
domestic
energy
consumption
and
this
huge
bet
on
renewables
would
free
up
a
lot
of
domestic
output
of
oil
for
exports
while
probably
saving
domestic
gas
resources
as
well
said
peter
kiernan
lead
energy
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
in
singapore
up
until
now
progress
in
building
solar
capacity
in
the
kingdom
has
been
very
slow
but
this
deal
might
give
it
the
kick
start
it
needs
but
gw
by
though
that
s
another
question
kiernan
said
last
may
softbank
said
it
raised
over
billion
for
the
vision
fund
the
world
s
largest
private
equity
fund
with
backers
including
saudi
arabia
s
sovereign
wealth
fund
apple
inc
and
foxconn
formally
known
as
hon
hai
precision
industry
the
vision
fund
has
funnelled
billion
into
tech
firms
as
of
the
end
of
december
transforming
softbank
from
a
japanese
telecoms
upstart
into
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
technology
investors
the
saudi
investment
is
softbank
s
second
major
global
solar
project
the
company
has
said
it
will
invest
up
to
billion
along
with
foxconn
and
bharti
enterprises
in
solar
projects
in
india
which
has
an
ambitious
target
to
generate
gw
of
power
from
solar
by
softbank
estimated
the
electrification
drive
could
create
a
requirement
for
over
gw
of
additional
power
