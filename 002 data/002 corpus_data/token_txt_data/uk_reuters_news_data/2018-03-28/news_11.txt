houston
reuters
oil
and
gas
business
activity
continued
to
climb
last
quarter
driven
by
an
improved
oilfield
services
sector
but
costs
for
goods
and
labor
also
rose
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
dallas
said
on
wednesday
in
its
quarterly
energy
survey
about
percent
of
the
energy
firms
surveyed
in
texas
southern
new
mexico
and
northern
louisiana
reported
increased
activity
from
a
year
ago
during
that
time
oil
prices
have
climbed
more
than
percent
to
near
a
barrel
about
percent
of
the
respondents
reported
an
improved
company
outlook
with
over
percent
of
oilfield
services
firms
offering
a
better
view
for
the
future
the
uptick
in
activity
is
driving
up
costs
companies
said
with
the
fed
s
index
for
wages
and
benefits
climbing
to
from
last
year
its
index
for
service
firms
input
costs
rose
by
percent
from
a
year
ago
and
over
percent
from
last
quarter
despite
higher
costs
the
index
for
prices
received
for
oilfield
services
fell
to
from
a
year
ago
less
than
half
of
firms
reported
receiving
higher
prices
and
percent
reported
a
decrease
e
p
companies
are
still
holding
service
prices
down
at
every
turn
on
the
flip
side
our
costs
of
goods
fuel
and
wages
are
climbing
every
day
it
is
time
for
rate
increases
to
ensure
a
profit
and
sustainability
said
one
respondent
on
average
companies
said
they
needed
per
barrel
oil
prices
to
profitably
drill
new
wells
over
the
prior
year
s
breakeven
in
the
permian
basin
companies
said
they
needed
a
barrel
oil
for
new
wells
also
up
from
last
year
the
higher
breakevens
come
as
companies
are
paying
up
for
land
on
wednesday
concho
resources
said
it
would
buy
rival
rsp
permian
in
a
deal
valued
at
more
than
per
acre
around
percent
of
the
firms
reported
increased
uncertainty
from
last
quarter
driven
partly
by
the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
tax
steel
imports
the
recent
uncertainty
regarding
steel
tariffs
has
the
potential
to
create
a
major
immediate
shortfall
in
upstream
drill
pipe
and
to
add
significantly
to
costs
which
would
negatively
impact
the
internal
rate
of
return
on
many
plays
said
one
respondent
who
works
for
an
oilfield
services
firm
the
index
for
producer
capital
expenditures
fell
to
from
the
previous
year
a
signal
that
oil
and
gas
producers
may
be
heeding
calls
from
investors
to
boost
returns
rather
than
expand
drilling
at
all
cost
