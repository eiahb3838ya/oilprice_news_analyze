the
revival
of
germany
s
grand
coalition
should
aid
stability
and
keep
the
euro
zone
s
plans
for
tighter
fiscal
union
on
track
investors
and
analysts
said
as
months
of
political
uncertainty
ended
on
sunday
germany
s
social
democrats
spd
voted
decisively
for
another
with
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
clearing
the
way
for
a
new
government
in
europe
s
largest
economy
more
than
five
months
since
the
country
s
inconclusive
election
two
thirds
of
the
spd
membership
voted
yes
to
the
deal
a
party
official
said
meaning
merkel
could
be
sworn
in
for
a
fourth
term
by
in
a
repeat
of
the
grand
coalition
that
has
governed
since
financial
markets
won
t
be
open
in
any
meaningful
sense
until
asian
trading
begins
around
gmt
but
the
initial
reaction
from
investors
suggested
the
german
deal
should
support
the
euro
stock
and
bond
markets
this
is
the
outcome
that
markets
have
been
crossing
their
fingers
and
hoping
for
said
james
athey
a
senior
investment
manager
at
standard
life
aberdeen
adding
that
it
was
by
far
the
least
disruptive
outcome
while
it
by
no
means
answers
all
the
policy
questions
at
either
the
german
domestic
nor
european
level
it
certainly
provides
a
more
stable
base
from
which
to
address
the
many
issues
at
traders
went
into
the
weekend
betting
on
a
higher
euro
data
from
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
showed
on
friday
the
currency
is
seen
as
the
most
sensitive
gauge
to
euro
zone
politics
and
the
value
of
net
long
euro
positions
betting
on
the
currency
rising
climbed
to
its
highest
in
three
weeks
the
figures
showed
it
is
probably
good
news
in
terms
of
the
capacity
for
germany
to
open
up
to
french
president
emmanuel
macron
s
proposal
for
the
future
of
europe
said
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
s
chief
european
economist
gilles
moec
macron
s
office
in
paris
said
france
and
germany
will
work
together
on
new
initiatives
in
the
coming
weeks
to
bring
the
european
project
german
business
also
greeted
the
result
with
relief
the
wait
for
a
government
since
september
was
the
country
s
longest
interregnum
while
the
united
states
is
starting
a
trade
war
and
china
is
challenging
our
industrial
leadership
we
have
been
unnecessarily
said
engineering
trade
union
vdma
s
managing
director
thilo
brodtmann
it
wasn
t
only
germany
that
investors
were
looking
at
on
sunday
though
italy
was
holding
an
national
election
under
a
complex
new
voting
system
that
has
made
the
outcome
even
trickier
than
usual
to
predict
pollsters
generally
expect
a
hung
parliament
with
former
prime
minister
silvio
berlusconi
s
alliance
of
groups
emerging
as
the
largest
bloc
the
movement
looks
almost
certain
to
be
the
biggest
single
party
potentially
complicating
matters
with
the
various
party
leaders
all
having
ruled
out
alliances
with
rivals
italy
however
has
a
long
history
of
finding
a
way
out
of
apparently
intractable
political
stalemate
and
markets
have
shown
little
concern
in
recent
weeks
about
the
prospect
of
a
confused
result
italian
bond
yields
which
are
a
reflection
of
government
s
credit
market
borrowing
costs
fell
to
a
low
on
friday
the
gap
with
germany
s
borrowing
costs
also
narrowed
to
the
smallest
in
two
weeks
i
am
surprised
how
little
risk
the
market
is
pricing
from
this
said
cesar
perez
ruiz
chief
investment
officer
at
pictet
wealth
management
that
gap
between
italian
and
german
yields
could
shrink
a
little
further
with
an
alliance
though
there
would
be
a
heavy
in
italian
markets
if
the
most
parties
were
part
of
any
new
government
he
added
voting
in
italy
started
at
gmt
and
concludes
at
gmt
though
it
could
take
many
hours
before
the
outcome
is
clear
and
weeks
before
a
government
takes
shape
