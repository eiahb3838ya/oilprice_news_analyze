the
power
supply
in
syria
s
aleppo
will
be
boosted
this
year
thanks
to
new
capacity
installed
by
its
ally
iran
a
step
towards
reviving
the
industrial
hub
whose
electricity
grid
has
been
destroyed
in
seven
years
of
war
a
syrian
official
said
the
five
power
generation
plants
are
part
of
a
deal
penned
last
year
by
which
iran
a
vital
supporter
of
president
bashar
will
help
repair
the
syrian
power
grid
and
reflects
tehran
s
deepening
role
in
the
country
syrian
government
forces
with
critical
help
from
militias
and
the
russian
air
force
recovered
full
control
of
aleppo
some
months
ago
driving
out
rebels
who
had
held
the
city
s
eastern
districts
mohammed
the
director
general
of
the
aleppo
power
company
said
all
of
the
city
s
power
generation
capacity
amounting
to
megawatts
had
been
destroyed
in
the
conflict
that
erupted
in
he
said
the
new
capacity
being
installed
by
iran
at
a
cost
of
million
euros
would
produce
megawatts
once
it
comes
on
line
at
some
point
between
april
and
june
other
sources
will
enter
service
to
feed
aleppo
city
and
so
the
hours
of
provision
will
certainly
increase
after
april
said
saleh
speaking
to
reuters
as
he
inspected
work
to
restore
the
power
supply
to
one
part
of
the
city
industrialists
have
cited
power
supply
as
one
of
the
big
impediments
to
reviving
their
businesses
in
aleppo
a
city
which
enjoyed
electricity
before
the
war
power
provision
today
ranges
between
and
hours
a
day
in
parts
of
the
city
where
there
is
electricity
said
saleh
but
some
parts
of
the
city
specifically
areas
that
were
under
rebel
control
have
yet
to
be
reconnected
to
the
power
grid
he
said
the
government
aimed
to
restore
electricity
to
those
areas
this
year
there
is
cooperation
from
our
iranian
and
russian
friends
in
the
power
sector
he
said
when
asked
how
the
government
plans
to
restore
power
to
those
areas
western
states
some
of
which
have
backed
the
opposition
have
said
they
will
not
help
rebuild
syria
until
a
political
transition
is
in
place
the
syrian
government
hopes
china
will
help
it
rebuild
in
addition
to
iran
and
russia
while
assad
continues
to
recover
territory
from
rebels
the
main
highway
linking
aleppo
to
other
cities
such
as
hama
homs
latakia
and
damascus
still
runs
through
territory
held
by
insurgents
rendering
it
insecure
that
forced
the
government
last
year
to
extend
new
power
lines
out
into
the
desert
along
a
circuitous
but
secure
road
to
aleppo
more
than
towers
were
put
up
along
the
road
saleh
said
he
also
said
that
state
engineers
were
fixing
the
power
grid
in
kurdish
districts
of
aleppo
city
that
were
recently
restored
to
state
control
after
kurdish
militias
withdrew
