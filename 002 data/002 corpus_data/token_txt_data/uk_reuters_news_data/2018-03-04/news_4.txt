global markets-dollar slips on trade war fears, euro bounces after italian exit polls
sydney
march
reuters
the
dollar
stayed
on
a
slippery
slope
on
monday
amid
fears
of
a
global
trade
war
while
the
euro
dipped
briefly
but
rebounded
quickly
after
results
of
exit
polls
for
italy
s
elections
pointed
to
a
hung
parliament
a
coalition
is
set
to
win
the
most
seats
in
italy
s
parliament
ahead
of
the
movement
according
to
the
exit
polls
although
it
was
unlikely
to
produce
an
outright
winner
the
euro
level
rose
percent
to
after
going
as
low
as
as
the
polls
suggested
a
period
of
uncertainty
until
a
coalition
government
could
be
formed
also
helping
the
euro
was
the
revival
of
germany
s
grand
coalition
over
the
weekend
meaning
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
will
form
a
new
government
more
than
five
months
since
the
country
s
inconclusive
election
the
euro
also
got
a
bit
of
a
lift
from
flows
as
risk
sentiment
soured
after
president
donald
trump
proposed
tariffs
on
imported
steel
and
aluminium
rattling
financial
markets
last
week
the
dollar
fell
for
a
fourth
straight
session
to
go
as
deep
as
yen
but
was
slightly
above
friday
s
low
of
a
level
not
seen
since
november
still
wall
street
rebounded
late
on
friday
as
investors
who
were
initially
spooked
by
the
prospect
of
a
global
trade
war
clung
to
hopes
that
trump
was
just
rattling
sabres
as
a
negotiating
tactic
news
over
the
weekend
suggested
however
that
trump
was
going
ahead
with
his
plan
while
there
was
no
indication
that
allies
would
be
excluded
from
the
tariffs
canada
and
mexico
have
threatened
retaliation
and
the
european
union
said
it
would
apply
percent
tariffs
on
about
billion
of
imports
from
the
united
states
if
trump
carried
out
his
threat
trump
says
the
tariffs
are
needed
to
protect
domestic
industries
against
unfair
competition
from
china
and
elsewhere
analysts
were
not
sure
how
asian
markets
would
react
on
monday
although
sentiment
is
likely
to
remain
jittery
the
s
p
and
nasdaq
rebounded
from
losses
of
percent
or
more
to
close
higher
on
friday
the
dow
however
ended
lower
and
remained
in
negative
territory
for
the
year
so
far
