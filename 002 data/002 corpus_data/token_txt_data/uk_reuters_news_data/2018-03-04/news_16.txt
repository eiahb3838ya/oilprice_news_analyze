many
norwegian
companies
lag
high
standards
for
reporting
their
impact
on
the
environment
that
the
nordic
nation
s
trillion
wealth
fund
is
championing
abroad
in
the
world
s
biggest
sovereign
wealth
fund
which
is
barred
by
the
norwegian
government
from

and
climate

just
two

were
on
a

of
a

for

central

governor
oeystein
olsen
told
reuters
when
asked
if
oslo
was
pressing
higher
standards
abroad
than
at
home
the
wealth
fund
is
managed
by
a
unit
of
the
central
bank
cdp
said
there
were
no
norwegian
firms
for
instance
among
almost
companies
including
l
oreal
walmart
and
toyota
rated
as
leaders
in
tracking
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
their
supply
chains
if
norwegian
companies
want
to
take
a
leadership
role
on
climate
change
they
should
be
engaging
with
their
suppliers
on
these
issues
said
sonya

head
of

chain
at
cdp
norway
s
fund
built
from
the
nation
s
oil
and
gas
revenues
says
global
warming
is
stoking
downpours
droughts
and
rising
sea
levels
that
threaten
earnings
it
says
investors
need
harmonized
data
to
compare
risks
its
policies
such
as
restricting
investments
in
coal
companies
have
huge
influence
for
companies
and
investors

it

yngve
slyngstad
the
fund
s
ceo
said
it
encouraged
companies
abroad
to
strengthen
their
reporting
in
general
directly
to
the
investors
but
also
indirectly
through
the
cdp
few
companies
are
doing
enough
on
climate
change
he
said
statoil
spokesman
erik
haaland
said
the
company
did
not
take
part
in
the
cdp
fresh
water
survey
because
most
of
the
firm
s
operations
are
offshore
using
abundant
sea
water
statoil
has
shale
oil
and
gas
in
the
united
states
also
the
questionnaire
is
quite
extensive
and
since
the
issue
is
less
material
for
our
operations
we
made
the
decision
to
not
take
part
he
said
asked
if
the
government
had
a
double
standard
norway
s
deputy
finance
minister
geir
olsen
wrote
in

that
the
ministry
welcomes
efforts
to
standardize
climate
reporting
according
to
internationally
agreed
the
finance
ministry
oversees
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
martin
skancke
a
consultant
on
the
design
of
sovereign
wealth
funds
said
obviously
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
when
the
government
promotes
these
standards
through
the
fund
in
foreign
markets
that
it
also
promotes
them
internally
he
said
that
from
his
own
experience
on
boards
of
norwegian
companies
the
government
does
urge
companies
to
disclose
environmental
data
he
said
it
was
hard
to
estimate
the
extra
costs
of
such
reporting
among
other
norwegian
companies

said
it
had
reported

the
cdp
since
but
lost
marks
on
technicalities
when
filling
in
the
cdp
questionnaire
we
are
more
occupied
about
reporting
quality
information
requested
by
important
stakeholders
than
exactly
following

it
said
in

yara

kristin

said
the

halved
its
greenhouse

we

certainly
not

in
