the
visit
of
a
aircraft
carrier
to
vietnam
for
the
first
time
since
the
end
of
the
vietnam
war
is
a
powerful
symbol
of
the
growing
strategic
ties
between
the
former
foes
but
the
arrival
on
monday
of
the
uss
carl
vinson
also
illustrates
hanoi
s
complex
and
evolving
relationship
with
beijing
over
the
disputed
south
china
sea
for
months
now
vietnamese
envoys
have
been
working
to
ease
the
concerns
of
their
giant
chinese
neighbour
over
the
visit
and
the
prospect
of
broader
security
between
hanoi
and
washington
according
to
diplomats
and
others
familiar
with
discussions
vietnamese
diplomats
and
military
officers
have
repeatedly
stressed
the
country
s
independent
foreign
policy
and
its
desire
for
broad
foreign
relations
hoping
to
maintain
stable
ties
with
china
while
standing
up
to
it
over
the
south
china
sea
the
sources
said
the
vinson
will
mark
the
biggest
military
presence
in
the
country
since
when
it
berths
in
danang
for
a
stay
the
port
city
on
vietnam
s
central
coast
is
close
to
its
blue
whale
gas
field
now
being
developed
by
oil
major
exxon
mobil
as
well
as
the
increasingly
fortified
paracel
islands
which
china
occupies
and
vietnam
also
claims
china
s
rapid
construction
and
of
the
seven
features
it
holds
in
the
disputed
spratly
group
further
south
has
alarmed
vietnam
and
other
regional
governments
as
it
seeks
to
enforce
its
claims
to
much
of
the
south
china
sea
china
s
navy
and
coastguard
now
routinely
patrol
vast
swathes
of
the
area
through
which
some
trillion
in
trade
passes
annually
while
some
chinese
commentators
have
used
the
vinson
s
presence
to
demand
an
even
greater
chinese
military
in
the
waterway
official
reaction
from
beijing
has
been
relatively
muted
since
the
stop
was
confirmed
in
january
carriers
frequently
ply
the
south
china
sea
as
part
of
a
rising
pattern
of
naval
deployments
and
are
now
routinely
shadowed
by
chinese
naval
vessels
regional
naval
officers
say
even
as
it
moves
forward
with
the
vietnam
has
been
engaging
china
over
south

sea
tensions
said
le
hong
hiep
a
vietnam
expert
at
singapore
s
iseas
yusof
ishak
institute
they
might
be
irritated
but
gradualism
is
the
key
word
here
vietnam
will
only
embrace
the
at
a
pace
that
doesn

cause

from
zhang
baohui
a
mainland
security
expert
at
hong
kong
lingnan
university
said
he
believed
beijing
would
not
be
panicked
by
the
carrier
visit
in
part
due
to
quiet
but
successful
vietnamese
diplomacy
beijing
has
a
much
better
understanding
of
vietnam
s
balancing
formula
now
he
said
the
vinson
arrives
amid
repeated
signals
from
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
that
it
is
keen
to
further
develop
security
ties
with
vietnam
as
part
of
a
range
of
political
and
military
relationships
to
check
the
rise
of
china
given
historic
vietnamese
suspicions
of
beijing
hanoi
s
communist
party
leadership
has
forged
a
range
of
security
relationships
to
balance
its
own
ties
with
china
moscow
its
major
patron
through
the
cold
war
remains
the
key
supplier
to
the
modernising
vietnamese
military
and
india
and
israel
are
increasingly
important
suppliers
trump
himself
touted
possible
missile
and
other
advanced
weapons
sales
during
his
november
visit
to
vietnam
but
not
major
arms
deal
has
yet
been
completed
his
administration
s
national
security
strategy
published
in
december
listed
vietnam
as
a
maritime
partner
derek
grossman
a
senior
defence
analyst
at
the
rand
said
it
was
uncertain
just
how
fast
and
how
far
vietnam
was
prepared
to
go
even
as
it
sought
to
deter
china
in
the
south
china
sea
it
seems
the
side
is
still
not
sure
quite
what
vietnam
wants
but
the
focus
will
likely
be
on
ways
to
enhance
vietnam
s
maritime
domain
awareness
and
maritime
security
capabilities
he
said
a
recent
study
of
vietnam
s
military
modernisation
by
grossman
published
by
the
national
bureau
of
asian
research
found
that
hanoi
would
struggle
to
sustain
a
conflict
if
its
deterrence
strategy
failed
despite
the
acquisition
of
its
first
submarines
new
russian
jet
fighters
and
missiles
vietnam
faced
extensive
deployment
and
integration
hurdles
