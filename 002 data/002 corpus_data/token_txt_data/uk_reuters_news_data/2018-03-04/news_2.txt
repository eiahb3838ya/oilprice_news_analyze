china
s
palm

said

bought
record
volumes
of
the

in
as
the
country
s
demand
for
animal

ingredient
soymeal
grows
but
the
waning
of
china
s
appetite
for
palm
oil
as
well
as
its
implications
for
soybeans
is
set
to
be
a
key
theme
for
the
industry
this
year
and
likely
to
be
a
hot
topic

china
s
edible
oil
demand
is
not
growing
as
fast
as
meal
demand
so
they
have
excessive
supplies
of
soybeans
said
veteran

official
chandran
now
a
consultant
in
kuala

china
is
buying
more
soybeans
and
that
demand
is
essentially
driven
by
higher

after

months
market
watchers
have
ascribed
the
earlier

this

up
from

according

rapeseed

demand
will
increase
as
it

margins
