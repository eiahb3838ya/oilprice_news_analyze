could
further
depress
the
country
s
crude
output
it
s
been
going
down
for
a
bit
but
there
is
an
expectation
that
the
decline
will
accelerate
said
jamie
webster
senior
director
of
the
center
for
energy
impact
at
the
boston
consulting

there
s
increasingly
a
view
that
this
could
be
as
bad
as
libya
was

its
worst
days

the

try

that
hurdle
said
gene

energy
in
stamford
connecticut
it
seems
as
if
the
pull
backs
are
just
profit
taking
and
we
will
see
whether
people
are
going
to
be
willing
to
drive
the

through
again
he
said
beyond
venezuela
s
production
woes
geopolitical
concerns
that
sanctions
on
iran
could
curb
the

have
led

a
possible
trade
war
with
china
is
on

to
drop
their
tariff
threats

mcgillian
said
rising
output
from
shale

key
opec
producers
could
end
the

bp
chief

bob
dudley
told

dudley
said
he
expected
a
flood
of
shale

a
possible
reopening

taps
to
cool
oil
markets
after
crude
rose
above
a
barrel
last

dudley
said
he
saw
oil
prices
falling
to
between
and
because
of
surging
shale
output
and
opec
s
capacity
to
boost
production
to
cover
a
potential
shortfall
in
iranian
supplies
owing
to
sanctions
