said
on

giving
global

a
lift
in
early
trading
on
monday
the
and
china
agreeing
to
no
trade
war
will
be
positive
for

prices
given
that
the
possibility
of
a
trade

would
have
dealt

significant
blow
to

however
crude

some
way
off
the
november

reached
last

many

say
there
is
enough
supply
to
meet

ongoing
production
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
plunging
output
in
venezuela
and
looming
sanctions
against
major
oil
producer
iran
without
a
further
escalation
in
geopolitical
risk
oil
might
be
due
a
pullback
said
greg
mckenna
chief
market
strategist
at

axitrader
bp
s
chief
executive
bob
dudley
told
reuters
he
expected
a
flood
of
shale
and
a
possible
reopening
of
opec
taps
to
cool
oil
markets
after
crude
rose
above
a
barrel
last
week
dudley
said
he
saw
oil
prices
falling
to
between
and
a
barrel
due
to
surging
shale
output
and
opec
s
capacity
to
boost
production
to
replace
potential
falls
in
iranian
supplies
due
to
sanctions
