update 1-u.s. top court takes up challenge to virginia uranium mining ban
washington
reuters
the
supreme
court
on
monday
agreed
to
decide
whether
states
have
the
right
to
ban
uranium
mining
for
public
health
reasons
in
a
dispute
over
a
moratorium
virginia
put
in
place
on
the
radioactive
metal
in
the
court
will
hear
a
bid
by
a
virginia
energy
resources
inc
subsidiary
and
other
owners
of
the
largest
uranium
deposit
to
revive
a
lawsuit
thrown
out
by
a
lower
court
that
sought
to
invalidate
virginia
s
ban
because
it
conflicted
with
a
federal
law
that
regulates
nuclear
power
generation
uranium
a
main
source
of
fuel
for
nuclear
power
plants
and
material
in
nuclear
warheads
remains
a
strategic
resource
for
electricity
and
national
defense
the
case
could
clarify
how
far
states
can
go
in
regulating
access
to
uranium
resources
the
plaintiffs
virginia
uranium
inc
a
subsidiary
of
vancouver
british
virginia
energy
resources
cole
hill
llc
and
bowen
minerals
llc
value
the
southern
virginia
uranium
deposit
at
up
to
billion
according
to
court
papers
mining
it
could
inject
billions
of
dollars
into
the
local
economy
the
plaintiffs
said
the
dispute
concerns
whether
the
federal
atomic
energy
act
of
preempts
virginia
s
mining
ban
under
the
constitution
s
supremacy
clause
which
holds
that
federal
law
generally
trumps
state
law
the
atomic
energy
act
gives
the
federal
nuclear
regulatory
commission
the
sole
power
to
regulate
radiation
safety
standards
for
milling
uranium
ore
and
disposing
of
waste
byproducts
known
as
tailings
key
steps
in
the
production
of
nuclear
fuel
but
it
does
not
cover
conventional
uranium
mining
on
land
the
plaintiffs
said
the
ban
was
motivated
by
concerns
over
radiation
hazards
which
is
subject
to
exclusive
federal
oversight
virginia
enacted
its
ban
on
uranium
mining
amid
concerns
about
environmental
and
public
safety
hazards
after
unsuccessfully
lobbying
virginia
legislators
to
allow
it
the
plaintiffs
filed
suit
in
arguing
that
the
federal
law
regulates
nuclear
safety
and
preempts
state
laws
that
attempt
to
do
so
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
backed
the
companies
in
the
case
under
the
appeals
court
ruling
solicitor
general
noel
francisco
said
in
a
brief
states
could
for
example
pass
laws
that
impede
physical
access
to
nuclear
facilities
diminish
the
availability
of
source
materials
or
equipment
necessary
for
nuclear
development
or
erect
financial
barriers
to
the
development
of
nuclear
the
richmond
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
the
plaintiffs
last
year
prompting
their
supreme
court
appeal
the
justices
will
decide
the
case
in
