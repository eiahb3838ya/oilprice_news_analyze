trimming

focusing

in
the

of

by
a
total
of
million

according
to
records
published
by

and
exchanges
liquidation
has
been
concentrated
in
crude

where
the
net

in

has
been
reduced
by
a
total
of

over
the
last
four

net
long

fallen
by

over
five
consecutive
weeks
while
net
length
in
nymex
and

wti
has
dropped
by

over
four
weeks
but
while

have
been
reducing
their
bullish
exposure
to

they
have
been
boosting
their

in

net
length
in

has
risen
by

since
the
middle
of

with
increases
in

heating

european

million
portfolio
managers
have
accumulated
record
net
positions
of
million
barrels
in
gasoline
and
million
barrels
in
european
gasoil
as
well
as
a
million
barrels
in
heating
oil
the
rotation
of
positions
from
crude
to
fuels
reflects
strong
consumer
demand
and
shrinking
inventories
of
products
coupled
with
in
crude
oil
after
a
strong
rally
since
the
end
of
june
the
rotation
away
from
crude
also
likely
explains
the
weakening
of
the
nearby
calendar
spreads
in
brent
in
recent
trading
sessions
the
first
three
contract
months
nearest
to
expiry
account
for
more
than
percent
of
all
open
contracts
in
brent
futures
and
options
according
to
the
intercontinental
exchange
assuming
hedge
fund
positions
are
distributed
in
the
same
proportion
then
the
liquidation
of
hedge
fund
positions
will
have
been
concentrated
in
nearby
months
in
fact
hedge
funds
tend
to
focus
disproportionately
on
nearby
contracts
where
liquidity
and
turnover
is
greatest
so
the
impact
of
hedge
fund
selling
on
nearby
months
will
have
been
magnified
funds
are
especially
likely
to
focus
on
nearby
contract
months
because
of
the
greater
liquidity
as
hedge
funds
accumulated
a
record
long
position
in
brent
and
wti
between
june
and
the
first
three
months
of
the
concentration
of
buying
nearby
helped
push
futures
prices
deeper
into
backwardation
but
as
fund
managers
trim
those
positions
it
has
removed
much
of
the
support
for
nearby
prices
and
caused
the
backwardation
to
narrow
sharply
