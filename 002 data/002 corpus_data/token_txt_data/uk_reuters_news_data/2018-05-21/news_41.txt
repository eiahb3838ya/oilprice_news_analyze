stocks
oil
prices
and
the
dollar
were
on
the
rise
on
monday
after
the
trade
war
was
declared
on
hold
while
in
europe
italy
s
borrowing
costs
climbed
and
the
milan
bourse
fell
as
two
parties
got
closer
to
power
european
stocks
opened
higher
with
the

up
percent
while
s
p
mini
futures
rose
percent
following
a
positive
session
in
asia
led
by
strong
gains
in
greater
china
there
s
certainly
a
sentiment
on
risky
assets
due
to
the
trade
announcement
said
stephane
barbier
de
la
serre
a
strategist
at
makor
capital
markets
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
declared
the
trade
war
with
china
on
hold
following
an
agreement
to
drop
their
tariff
threats
that
had
roiled
global
markets
this
year
mnuchin
and
president
donald
trump
s
top
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
said
the
agreement
reached
by
chinese
and
american
negotiators
on
saturday
set
up
a
framework
for
addressing
trade
imbalances
in
the
future
barbier
de
la
serre
cautioned
however
that
given
the
lack
of
details
available
about
the
agreement
between
the
and
china
it
was
too
early
to
call
it
a
definitive
turning
point
he
added
that
a
number
of
question
marks
such
as
on
the
prospects
for
world
growth
inflation
and
rising
rates
should
also
keep
investors
on
their
toes
as
demand
for
debt
fell
bond
prices
were
under
pressure
keeping
their
yields
not
far
from
last
week
s
peaks
with
the
treasuries
yield
at
percent
near
a
high
of
percent
hit
on
friday
in
the
currency
market
higher
yields
helped
to
strengthen
the
dollar
about
percent
against
a
basket
of
currencies
while
the
euro
dipped
percent
to
the
common
currency
was
also
under
pressure
as
italy
s
league
and
the
movement
agreed
on
a
candidate
to
lead
their
planned
coalition
government
and
implement
spending
plans
which
some
investors
believe
threaten
the
sustainability
of
the
country
s
debt
pile
italy
s
bond
yield
rose
to
percent
their
highest
level
since
july
pushing
the
gap
with
the
benchmark
german
bund
to
percent
the
milan
bourse
also
suffered
down
percent
with
while
the
rest
of
europe
s
trading
centers
were
un
positive
territory
oil
prices
held
firm
near
highs
also
on
easing
trade
tensions
brent
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
up
percent
the
market
is
also
keeping
an
eye
on
venezuela
where
president
nicolas
maduro
faces
fresh
international
censure
after
his
in
a
vote
foes
denounced
as
a
farce
cementing
autocracy
in
the
opec
nation
oil
prices
have
been
supported
by
plummeting
venezuelan
production
in
addition
to
a
solid
global
demand
and
supply
concerns
stemming
from
tensions
in
