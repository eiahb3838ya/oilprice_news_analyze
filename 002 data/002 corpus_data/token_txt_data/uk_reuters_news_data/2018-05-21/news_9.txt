close

the
often
divided

appeared
more
united
after
the

and
said
its
boycott
had
worked
the
fraud
has
been
exposed
and
today
the
world
will
reject
it
tweeted
opposition
leader
julio
borges
it
was
not
clear
what
strategy
the
opposition
would
now
adopt
but
major
protests
seemed
unlikely
given
widespread
disillusionment
and
fatigue
demonstrators
did
barricade
some
streets
in
the

faces
a
colossal
task
turning
around
venezuela
s
moribund
economy
but
has
offered
no
specifics
on
changes
to
two
decades
of
policies
the
bolivar
currency
is
down
percent
over
the
past
year
and
inflation
is
at
an
annual

according
to
the
national
assembly
venezuela
s
multiple
creditors
are
considering
accelerating
claims
on
unpaid
foreign
debt
while
oil
major
conocophillips
has
been
taking
aggressive
action
in
recent
weeks
against
pdvsa
as
part
of
its
claim
for
compensation
over
a
nationalization
of
its
assets
in
venezuela
trading
of
venezuelan
government
and
pdvsa
debt
was
mixed
but
volumes
remained
thin
in

on
monday
with
election
results
considered
a
formality
and
offering
little
to
change
investor
viewpoints
the
benchmark
government
bond
due
was
bid
up
points
to
cents
on
the
dollar
while
the
benchmark
pdvsa
recovered
about
half
of
its
early
losses
to
trade
down
points
in
price
to
cents
on
the
dollar
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
i
would
have
been
surprised
if
we
had
seen
some
move
in
the
market
because
that
would
imply
that
some
bondholders
were
holding
out
for
a
positive
election
result
which
was
a
very
remote
possibility
