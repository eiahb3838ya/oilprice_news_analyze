up

following
a
positive

in

there
s
certainly
a
sentiment
on

due
to
the

announcement
said
stephane
barbier
de
la

a
strategist
at
makor
capital

treasury

declared
the

on
saturday
set
up
a
framework
for
addressing

imbalances
in
the

barbier
de
la
serre
cautioned
however
that
given
the
lack
of
details
available
about
the
agreement
between
washington
and
beijing
it
was
too
early
to
call
it
a
definitive
turning
point
he
added
that
a
number
of
question
marks
such
as
on
the
prospects
for
world
growth
inflation
and
rising
rates
should
also
keep
investors
on
their
toes
as
demand
for
debt
fell
bond

were
under
pressure
keeping
their

not
far
from

strengthen
the

about

while
the

to
italian
politics
contributed
to
the
pressure
on
the

agreed
on
a

lead
their
planned
coalition
government
and
implement
spending

seen
by
some
investors
as
threatening
the
sustainability
of
italy

pile
it
is
something
that
creates
a
lot
of
nervousness
but
of
course
on
the
other
hand
one
has
to
wait
