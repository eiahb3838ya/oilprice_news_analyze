of
natural

a
year
along
an
km

a
spokesman
for
the
governor
of
kandahar
province
said
the
demining
team
was
working
in
the
southern
province
s
maiwand
district
when
attacked
early
on
monday
the
victims
had
told
the
district
governor
and
district
police
that
they
had
no
problem
with
taliban
so
they
would
not
need
any
protection
he

the
route
of
the
turkmenistan
afghanistan
pakistan
india
tapi
pipeline
passes
through
large
areas
under
taliban
control
or
influence
but
when
the
afghan
section
of
the
project
was
launched
this
year
the
taliban
said
they
would
cooperate
because
of
its
importance
for
the
country
however
construction
work
will
still
have
to
pass
through
lawless
areas
of
southern
afghanistan
where
armed
groups
with
shifting
loyalties
operate
and
security
is
highly
uncertain
a
taliban
spokesman
said
the
incident
was
being
investigated
and
said
the
victims
were
not
wearing
the
usual
uniform
worn
by
tapi
workers
