russia
s
nuclear
power
plant
arrived
in
the
arctic
port
of
murmansk
over
the
weekend
in
preparation
for
its
maiden
mission
providing
electricity
to
an
isolated
russian
town
across
the
bering
strait
from
alaska
the
state
company
behind
the
plant
called
the
akademik
lomonosov
says
it
could
pioneer
a
new
power
source
for
remote
regions
of
the
planet
but
green
campaigners
have
expressed
concern
about
the
risk
of
nuclear
accidents
greenpeace
has
called
it
the
nuclear
titanic
russian
state
nuclear
company
rosatom
which
developed
the
floating
power
plant
said
that
it
docked
the
unit
in
murmansk
on
saturday
where
it
was
towed
from
st
petersburg
the
city
where
it
was
built
in
murmansk
it
will
take
on
board
a
supply
of
nuclear
fuel
it
will
then
will
be
towed
to
the
town
of
pevek
in
the
far
eastern
region
of
chukotka
separated
from
the
state
of
alaska
by
the
miles
wide
bering
strait
it
will
start
operations
there
next
year
the
plant
will
replace
a
power
plant
and
an
ageing
nuclear
power
plant
supplying
more
than
people
with
electricity
in
chukotka
rosatom
said
rosatom
has
long
planned
to
launch
the
power
units
which
with
their
mobile
small
capacity
plants
are
best
suited
to
remote
regions
it
says
they
can
help
the
environment
by
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
blamed
for
global
warming
the
small
plants
were
designed
to
make
it
possible
to
supply
electricity
to
areas
of
russia
they
can
operate
without
the
need
for
refuelling
for
years
environmental
protection
groups
including
greenpeace
have
sent
a
letter
to
rosatom
boss
alexei
likhachyov
demanding
strict
adherence
to
safety
standards
and
saying
they
were
watching
the
floating
facility
s
development
with
great
concern
the
letter
calls
for
full
and
unrestricted
regulatory
oversight
by
the
russian
nuclear
regulator
and
an
international
study
into
the
environmental
impact
before
the
reactors
are
loaded
with
fuel
and
tested
nuclear
reactors
bobbing
around
the
arctic
ocean
will
pose
a
shockingly
obvious
threat
to
a
fragile
environment
which
is
already
under
enormous
pressure
from
climate
change
jan
haverkamp
nuclear
expert
for
greenpeace
central
and
eastern
europe

in
a
