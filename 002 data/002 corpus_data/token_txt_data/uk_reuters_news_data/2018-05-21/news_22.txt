opec looking closely at venezuelan oil output drop - sources
london
reuters
opec
is
looking
closely
at
a
drop
in
oil
output
from
venezuela
to
see
if
the
loss
of
supply
from
the
member
state
warrants
action
by
the
group
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
this
marks
a
shift
from
earlier
this
year
when
opec
officials
downplayed
the
drop
in
venezuelan
production
and
it
follows
a
rise
in
prices
and
a
decline
in
global
inventories
that
is
making
tighter
supply
more
significant
falling
venezuelan
output
due
to
an
economic
crisis
has
helped
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
deliver
a
bigger
cut
than
intended
under
its
pact
with
russia
and
other
producers
to
curb
supplies
and
remove
a
global
glut
the
pact
which
began
in
january
and
runs
to
the
end
of
will
be
reviewed
when
opec
meets
on
june
to
review
policy
opec
s
compliance
with
the
deal
reached
an
unprecedented
percent
in
april
meaning
it
has
cut
well
above
its
target
maybe
if
the
market
is
tight
there
will
be
a
need
to
make
some
adjustment
one
opec
delegate
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
referring
to
the
june
meeting
global
inventories
have
eased
back
close
to
their
average
the
measure
originally
targeted
by
opec
and
its
allies
the
output
reductions
combined
with
worries
about
supply
disruptions
due
to
sanctions
on
iran
pushed
oil
prices
above
a
barrel
last
week
the
highest
since
november
brent
crude
the
global
benchmark
was
trading
at
on
monday
iranian
supply
has
not
yet
been
affected
by
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
an
international
nuclear
deal
and
its
warning
of
that
it
would
impose
touch
sanctions
the
energy
minister
for
the
united
arab
emirates
which
currently
holds
the
opec
presidency
said
last
week
that
opec
had
more
significant
issues
to
deal
with
than
iran
he
cited
venezuela
low
before
ministers
from
opec
and
its
allies
meet
venezuelan
output
will
feature
in
technical
meetings
including
the
joint
technical
committee
which
meets
in
jeddah
on
tuesday
and
wednesday
as
well
as
other
such
meetings
expected
in
june
oil
output
in
venezuela
hit
a
low
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
april
almost
bpd
below
its
opec
output
target
venezuela
s
leftist
leader
nicolas
maduro
won
a
new
term
on
sunday
it
will
be
discussed
at
the
next
meeting
for
sure
a
second
opec
delegate
said
of
venezuelan
production
opec
is
looking
more
closely
at
venezuelan
output
as
global
inventories
approach
the
supply
cut
deal
s
original
target
oil
inventories
in
oecd
industrialised
nations
in
march
fell
to
million
barrels
above
the
average
down
from
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
january
according
to
opec
figures
drawing
stocks
back
to
that
average
was
the
supply
deals
main
goal
but
officials
have
since
said
other
metrics
such
as
oil
industry
investment
need
to
be
considered
when
inventories
were
higher
earlier
this
year
officials
had
downplayed
lower
venezuelan
output
in
january
a
senior
opec
source
ruled
out
raising
output
even
if
there
was
a
supply
disruption
from
iran
or
venezuela
although
the
tone
has
now
shifted
opec
is
not
yet
convinced
a
change
in
june
to
the
deal
on
cutting
supplies
is
warranted
we
should
let
the
agreement
go
on
said
a
third
opec
delegate
adding
that
adjustments
could
be
made
later
in
the
year
if
needed
