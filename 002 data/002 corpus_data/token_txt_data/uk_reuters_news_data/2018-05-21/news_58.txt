nine
current
and
former
executives
or
contractors
from
italy
s
eni
and
giant
royal
dutch
shell
including
eni
chief
executive
claudio
descalzi
have
been
accused
by
italian
prosecutors
of
paying
bribes
to
secure
the
license
to
explore
a
large
offshore
oilfield
in
if
found
guilty
the
individuals
on
trial
face
possible
jail
terms
for

all
deny
wrongdoing
as
do
shell
and
eni
the
criminal
trial
will
proceed
in
milan
on
june
after
a
short
initial
hearing
on
may
some
of
the
key
issues
in
the
trial
came
to
light
during
the
two
separate
civil
suits
filed
by
a
nigerian
emeka
obi
and
a
former
russian
diplomat
ednan
agaev
a
reuters
review
of
court
filings
shows
both
men
said
they
were
owed
millions
of
dollars
by
a
nigerian
company
malabu
oil
and
gas
for
arranging
meetings
with
shell
and
eni
the
judge
in
obi
s
case
upheld
evidence
that
obi
arranged
meetings
between
former
nigerian
oil
minister
dan
etete
who
was
convicted
of
money
laundering
in
an
unrelated
case
in
france
in
and
representatives
of
eni
and
that
he
negotiated
on
etete
s
behalf
with
shell
in
addition
documents
produced
in
agaev
s
case
showed
that
when
eni
and
shell
paid
for
the
license
they
deposited
more
than
billion
into
a
nigerian
government
escrow
account
in
london
but
most
of
the
money
later
ended
up
with
malabu
which
was
controlled
by
etete
the
judge
said
the
judges
found
that
in
a
conflict
of
interests
etete
had
a
stake
in
malabu
and
was
also
oil
minister
when
the
nigerian
government
awarded
the
company
the
license
to
explore
the
field
in
a
decision
that
was
reversed
in
reinstated
in
and
later
challenged
by
shell
these
details
helped
italian
prosecutors
put
together
their
case
industry
insiders
say
etete
denies
charges
of
bribery
for
channeling
money
from
the
deal
to
nigerian
politicians
he
and
his
lawyers
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
by

shell
said
by
email
that
if
improper
payments
are
shown
to
have
taken
place
they
were
not
made
with
shell
s
knowledge
authorization
