cited
china

chief
negotiator
vice
premier
liu
he
as
saying
the
talks
had
proved
to
be
positive
pragmatic
constructive
and
productive
despite
all
the
pressure
china
didn
t
fold
as
president
donald
trump
observed
instead
it
stood
firm
and
continually
expressed
its
willingness
to
talk
the
newspaper
said
in
an
editorial
that
the
finally
shared
this
willingness
means
the
two
sides
have
successfully
averted
the
confrontation
that
at
one
point
seemed
inevitable
it
said
during
an
initial
round
of
talks
this
month
in
beijing
the
united
states
demanded
that
china
reduce
its
trade
surplus
by
billion
no
dollar
figure
was
cited
in
the
countries
joint
statement
on
saturday
the

s
people
s
daily
said
that
in
the
energy
and
agriculture
sectors
the
two
countries
had
obvious
synergies
with
the
united
states
having
the
capacity
to
satisfy
the
massive
chinese
market
the
ballast
stone
of
ties
are
an
equal
and
mutually
beneficial
trade
and
business
relationship
its
essence
is
cooperation
it
said
but
china
was
not
being
forced
to
increase
imports
as
a
way
to
ward
off
the
trade
tensions
or
because
the
country
had
submitted
to
outside
pressure
the
newspaper
said
in
a
commentary
china
will
naturally
need
to
import
more
to
satisfy
demand
from
its
increasingly
affluent
consumers
the
newspaper
wrote
trade
wars
have
no
winners
it
added
in
the
commentary
published
under
the
pen
name
zhong
sheng
meaning
voice
of
china
used
to
give
the
paper
s
view
on
foreign
policy
issues
however
some
people
in
business
groups
who
had
been
pushing
for
tougher
policies
to
pressure
china
to
reform
market
barriers
expressed
frustration
and
disappointment
saying
it
would
be
hard
for
the
administration
to
rebuild
momentum
to
take
on
chinese
industrial
policies
james
zimmerman
a
lawyer
and
a
former
chairman
of
the
american
chamber
of
commerce
in
china
said
the
trump
administration
s
move
to
walk
back
its
threatened
trade
actions
was
premature
and
a
lost
opportunity
for
american
companies
workers
and
consumers
the
chinese
are
in
a
state
of
quiet
glee
knowing
that
trump
s
trade
team
backed
off
on
sanctions
without
getting
any
real
and
meaningful
concessions
out
of
beijing
