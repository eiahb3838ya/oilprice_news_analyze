rampant
corruption
scandals
and
a
deep
recession
soured
many
foreign
investors
on
brazil
in
recent
years
but
one
canadian
group
saw
opportunity
brookfield
asset
management
inc
and
its
subsidiaries
have
made
nearly
a
dozen
major
acquisitions
there
since
the
companies
have
spent
about
billion
on
energy
infrastructure
and
real
estate
assets
few
others
would
touch
due
to
the
legal
political
and
economic
risks
involved
a
crisis
is
a
good
time
to
find
value
said
a
person
close
to
the
group
who
called
brookfield
a
contrarian
that
includes
buying
assets
from
companies
entangled
in
the
blockbuster
car
wash
investigation
which
jailed
dozens
of
businessmen
and
politicians
the
deals
confirmed
brookfield
s
reputation
as
one
of
the
investors
in
brazil
in
for
example
brookfield
infrastructure
partners
lp
led
a
billion
acquisition
of
a
pipeline
operator
from
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
the
oil
company
at
the
heart
of
the
car
wash
scandal
recently
another
petrobras
pipeline
network
with
half
the
capacity
fetched
a
top
bid
of
around
billion
from
other
investors
brookfield
gave
that
deal
a
pass
the
canadians
savvy
is
built
on
nearly
years
of
experience
in
south
america
s
largest
economy
but
the
recent
buying
spree
pushed
the
company
to
new
extremes
of
due
diligence
and
bulletproofing
according
to
interviews
with
six
people
involved
in
the
deals
the
company
declined
to
comment
on
investments
in
brazil
which
account
for
about
percent
of
its
billion
portfolio
and
represent
its
biggest
market
after
the
united
states
chief
executive
bruce
flatt
whom
some
call
the
warren
buffett
of
canada
for
his
approach
called
recent
brazil
acquisitions
quality
businesses
from
sellers
in
need
of
capital
in
a
february
letter
to
investors
brookfield
s
purchase
of
gas
pipeline
operator
nova
transportadora
do
sudeste
sa
nts
from
petrobras
was
part
of
a
controversial
divestment
program
aimed
at
trimming
the
oil
firm
s
massive
debt
load
critics
have
decried
the
privatizations
and
ciro
gomes
a
leading
leftist
presidential
candidate
has
pledged
to
reverse
sales
of
state
energy
assets
if
elected
this
year
foreseeing
the
risk
brookfield
tasked
dozens
of
lawyers
with
drafting
an
ironclad
agreement
brookfield
has
a
right
to
compensation
if
petrobras
changes
the
contracts
in
a
way
that
hurts
the
canadians
cash
flow
according
to
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
head
of
brazilian
investment
banking
at
a
global
bank
who
was
not
involved
in
the
nts
deal
said
it
was
an
example
of
brookfield
s
willingness
to
bet
big
while
protecting
itself
everyone
was
stunned
by
their
billion
bid
at
the
time
the
banker
said
that
successful
deal
persuaded
other
investors
to
consider
bidding
on
the
other
petrobras
pipeline
unit
the
person
added
analysts
at
saibus
research
raised
their
target
price
for
shares
in
brookfield
infrastructure
partners
after
the
nts
deal
citing
a
boost
to
its
recurring
profit
margins
shares
have
climbed
percent
to
more
than
in
new
york
since
the
deal
was
reported
started
in
as
the
sao
paulo
railway
light
and
power
company
brookfield
grew
into
a
diversified
global
investment
firm
until
it
went
by
the
name
brascan
a
reflection
of
its
roots
as
a
canadian
investment
firm
in
brazil
brookfield
too
has
grappled
with
graft
allegations
in
brazil
its
homebuilding
unit
was
among
around
developers
accused
of
paying
bribes
to
building
inspectors
in
sao

paying
bribes
and
were

in
the
trial
of
the
building
inspectors
brookfield
said
the
company

not
a

of
the

with
authorities

the
sec
dropped
the
case
in
without
bringing
any
enforcement
action
brookfield
denied
wrongdoing
one
of
brookfield
s
toughest
recent
deals
will
test
its
ability
to
avoid
fallout
from
another
municipal
graft
scandal
last
year
it
agreed
to
pay
billion
for
a
percent
stake

a
leniency
