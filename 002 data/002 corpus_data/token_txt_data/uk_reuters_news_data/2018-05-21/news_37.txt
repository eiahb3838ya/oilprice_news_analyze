china
has
pledged
to
buy
more
goods
to
reduce
america
s
huge
trade
deficit
and
help
avoid
exacerbating
a
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
with
energy
and
commodities
high
on
washington
s
list
of
products
for
sale
the
trade
war
with
china
is
on
hold
after
the
governments
agreed
to
drop
tariff
threats
and
work
on
a
wider
agreement
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
sunday
washington
is
especially
keen
to
sell
more
of
the
united
states
surging
oil
and
gas
production
yet
infrastructure
bottlenecks
mean
energy
and
commodity
exports
can
grow
only
gradually
and
only
if
oil
gas
and
other
goods
remain
cost
attractive
against
global
competition
morgan
stanley
estimates
it
could
take
up
to
three
years
to
increase
chinese
purchases
of
goods
by
billion
to
billion
with
a
rise
in
agricultural
imports
in
the
near
term
followed
by
energy
total
oil
and
gas
exports
to
china
in
were
worth
billion
based
on
average
prices
a
far
cry
from
a
deficit
reduction
target
of
billion
but
exports
are
rising
and
china
has
spent
billion
on
oil
in
the
first
quarter
of
alone
increased
purchases
of
oil
will
help
china
replace
iranian
supplies
which
are
expected
to
fall
as
the
united
states
sanctions
on
tehran
buying
crude
would
help
with
the
iranian
situation
in
that
these
barrels
from
the
would
provide
additional
supplies
at
a
time
when
buyers
will
be
expected
to
cut
iranian
volumes
said
michal
meidan
of
consultancy
energy
aspects
china
s
oil
import
bill
this
year
could
rise
to
billion
to
billion
with
purchases
rising
to
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
according
to
energy
aspects
that
would
still
be
only
a
fraction
of
china
s
import
needs
of
million
bpd
in
april
worth
around
billion
and
while
exports
may
grow
somewhat
infrastructure
bottlenecks
for
the
time
being
hold
back
sales
oil
export
terminals
are
small
by
global
standards
and
the
biggest
tankers
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
don
t
fit
through
the
panama
canal
having
to
take
the
detour
around
africa
they
are
at
a
cost
disadvantage
against
producers
from
the
middle
east
africa
and
europe
washington
also
wants
the
united
states
to
export
more
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
china
while
lng
shipments
have
increased
there
are
only
two
export
facilities
both
of
which
have
largely
contracted
out
their
supplies
there
are
also
restraints
in
china
due
to
pipeline
and
terminal
capacities
lng
exports
to
china
could
eventually
surge
if
chinese
companies
become
partners
in
many
of
the
export
projects
that
still
seek
financing
china
could
direct
its
soybean
crushers
to
buy
more
of
america
s
surplus
oilseed
said
paul
burke
north
asia
regional
director
for
the
soybean
export
council
that
would
potentially
add
million
tonnes
of
imports
worth
billion
to
this
year
s
trade
bill
at
the
expense
of
major
exporters
brazil
and
argentina
soybeans
were
the
united
states
export
to
china
by
value
worth
billion
last
year
china
easing
controls
on
processing
imports
of
genetically
modified
strains
of
corn
and
fully
allocating
its
import
quota
for
wheat
would
also
add
to
grain
shipments
analysts
reckon
buying
more
poultry
beef
and
pork
would
be
another
way
to
boost
trade
but
tough
import
regulations
would
likely
limit
volumes
without
big
concessions
from
beijing
beijing
removed
tariffs
on
poultry
in
february
after
eight
years
but
a
ban
due
to
avian
influenza
remains
in
place
without
the
ban
the
poultry
business
could
be
worth
up
to
million
an
industry
expert
estimated
china
has
in
the
past
made
large
purchases
of
american
pork
for
its
strategic
reserves
there
is
also
strong
demand
for
imported
meat
among
the
country
s
middle
class
consumers
but
china
has
zero
tolerance
on
the
use
of
growth
promoter
ractopamine
widely
used
by
pork
farmers
and
synthetic
hormones
used
in
beef
the
government
lifted
a
ban
on
beef
last
year
but
it
has
only
approved
a
dozen
processors
for
export
in
the
first
quarter
imports
accounted
for
less
than
pct
of
china
s
total
beef
imports
but
a
in
purchases
would
challenge
australia
brazil
and
uruguay
big
meat
purchases
and
shipments
need
time
to
put
together
you
can
t
just
turn
on
the
spigot
