analysis-race on to boost gas supply to australia's east coast

a
pipeline
across
australia
and
gas
imports
from
as
far
away
as
the
united
states
are
on
the
drawing
board
as
the
country
races
to
plug
a
domestic
supply
gap
that
is
driving
up
east
coast
gas
prices
and
threatening
jobs
although
australia
is
the
world
s
no
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exporter
much
of
its
east
coast
gas
is
tied
up
in
export
contracts
while
mainstay
supplies
in
the
populated
southeast
are
drying
up
more
quickly
than
expected
imports
will
be
needed
within
four
years
warn
industry
executives
and
experts
which
means
gas
prices
that
have
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
three
years
aren
t
going
to
fall
and
could
even
rise
another
percent
to
match
global
spot
prices
some
people
still
find
the
import
of
lng
to
what
is
meant
to
be
an
energy
superpower
absurd
and
they
have
a
point
it
does
seem
very
weird
said
tennant
reed
national
public
policy
adviser
at
the
australian
industry
group
the
government
is
under
fire
from
angry
household
gas
users
and
industry
particularly
big
gas
users
such
as
petrochemical
and
fertiliser
manufacturers
which
have
warned
that
high
prices
are
making
some
businesses
uncompetitive
coal
seam
gas
from
queensland
which
now
supplies
around
percent
of
the
east
coast
market
costs
around
a
a
gigajoule
gj
to
produce
then
has
to
be
piped
at
a
cost
of
around
a
per
gj
which
has
driven
up
gas
prices
to
well
above
a
shortages
will
grow
from
due
to
a
steep
output
decline
in
the
main
gas
field
that
has
supplied
southern
australia
for
five
decades
the
australian
energy
market
operator
has
warned
in
the
longer
term
gas
is
expected
to
flow
from
developments
around
the
country
including
more
coal
seam
gas
from
queensland
new
finds
off
the
coast
of
victoria
and
shale
gas
from
the
northern
territory
but
these
are
years
from
development

the
near
term
answer
is
to
import
lng
either
from
west
to
east
or
from
offshore
some
imports
will
be
necessary
said
graeme
bethune
chief
executive
of
advisory
firm
energyquest
at
least
two
groups
agl
energy
and
a
consortium
led
by
iron
ore
mining
tycoon
twiggy
forrest
are
looking
to
import
lng
to
eastern
australia
to
meet
demand
from
around
woodside
petroleum
and
chevron
corp
the
two
big
lng
producers
in
western
australia
have
expressed
interest
in
supplying
agl
s
proposed
floating
storage
and
regasification
facility
lng
could
also
come
from
fields
in
papua
new
guinea
and
indonesia
to
the
country
s
north
or
from
as
far
away
as
the
united
states
where
the
country
s
shale
boom
has
led
to
gas
exports
bethune
said
the
government
meanwhile
is
studying
the
feasibility
of
building
a
a
billion
km
mile
pipeline
from
western
australia
consultants
rystad
energy
estimated
gas
could
be
delivered
by
pipeline
from
west
to
east
for
around
a
a
gj
in
well
below
imported
lng
which
it
estimated
would
cost
a
including
regasification
costs
by
then
but
industry
executives
say
a
pipeline
could
only
be
built
with
government
subsidies
given
the
huge
cost
you
can
ship
australian
gas
around
to
the
east
coast
a
hell
of
a
lot
cheaper
than
building
a
pipeline
from
the
pilbara
to
moomba
in
south
australia
santos
ltd
chief
executive
kevin
gallagher
told
reporters
this
month
there
are
plenty
of
other
projects
in
the
pipeline
i
think
you
ll
start
to
see
the
upstream
industry
responding
to
higher
prices
said
beach
energy
chief
executive
matt
kay
whose
company
is
looking
to
beef
up
production
in
south
australia
and
possibly
offshore
victoria
shale
gas
in
the
northern
territory
which
recently
lifted
a
ban
on
fracking
is
seen
as
a
potential
powerhouse
source
but
experts
say
it
will
take
at
least
seven
years
to
develop
royal
dutch
shell
and
petrochina
could
bring
on
new
coal
seam
gas
in
queensland
from
their
arrow
energy
joint
venture
but
have
yet
to
hit
the
go
button
and
the
output
may
end
up
in
north
asia
to
fulfil
export
contracts
santos
wants
to
develop
a
huge
coal
seam
gas
project
at
narrabri
in
outback
new
south
wales
state
but
has
yet
to
get
state
approval
as
it
battles
opposition
from
green
groups
but
even
if
any
of
those
start
producing
within
the
next
five
years
their
high
costs
are
unlikely
to
drive
down
prices
