french
utility
edf
will
not
be
allowed
to
start
up
its
new
flamanville
nuclear
reactor
without
regulator
asn
s
approval
of
a
solution
to
problems
with
substandard
welding
the
asn
said
on
wednesday
last
week
edf
said
more
than
half
of
the
weldings
on
the
reactor
s
secondary
cooling
circuit
did
not
meet
required
specifications
it
said
that
did
not
affect
flamanville
s
safety
or
the
schedule
to
load
it
with
fuel
at
the
end
of
an
asn
spokeswoman
said
the
weldings
problem
could
have
an
impact
on
the
calendar
however
edf
will
have
to
present
solutions
in
a
report
to
the
asn
which
will
then
seek
input
from
experts
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
she
said
asn
will
then
rule
on
whether
the
reactor
is
fit
for
service
the
spokeswoman
said
it
seemed
unlikely
that
asn
would
receive
a
full
report
on
the
issue
from
edf
before
the
summer
