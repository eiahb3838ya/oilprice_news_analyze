also
slowed
suggesting
the
key

was
starting
to
display
signs
of

the
weakness
was
driven
by
disruption
due

the

there

julian
senior
china
economist
at

economics
said
the
the
risk
is
still
that
the
economy
fares
worse
this
year
than
is
generally
some
analysts
cautioned
the
timing

have

s

industrial
output
in

took
its

tumble

growth
in
india
s

slowed

in

sentiment
across
financial
markets
was
already
sour
after
fed
s
jerome
powell
gave
an
upbeat
view
of
the
economy
on
tuesday
and
said
recent
data
had
strengthened
his
confidence
on
inflation
when
asked
about
likely
catalysts
for
more
than
three
rate
hikes
in
he
said
each
member
would
write
a

ahead
of
the
march
meeting
and
that
he
wouldn
t
want

prejudge
that
outcome
rate
futures
fell
following
powell
s
remarks
as
traders
began
pricing
in
about
a
chance
of
a
fourth
hike
this
year
fears
of
faster
rate
hikes
have
caused
anxiety
that
other
central
banks
will
start
to
tighten
policy
and
raise
borrowing
costs
that
would
in
turn
hurt
corporate
earnings
clouding
the
outlook
for
what
had
been
expected
to
be
another
solid
year
of
global
economic
growth
today
s
comments
appear
to
open
the
door
for
others
on
the
fed
committee
to
revise
their
forecast
as
they
see
fit
and
that
powell
himself
may
be
inclined
to
look
for
four
hikes
this
year
jpmorgan
economist
michael
feroli
said
in
a
note
the
fed
moved
three
times
in
and
is
seen
as
certain
to
do
the
same
or
more
this
year
with
the
first
move
expected
as
early
as
march
the

held
on

against
most
major
currencies

hovered
near
a
recent

top
against
the
australian
dollar

near

analysts
are
predicting
a
stronger

this
year
despite
faster
rate
rises

japanese
retail

have
built
huge
