rome
one
of
europe
s
most
cities
and
home
to
thousands
of
ancient
outdoor
monuments
threatened
by
pollution
plans
to
ban
diesel
cars
from
the
center
by
its
mayor
said
virginia
raggi
announced
the
decision
on
her
facebook
page
on
tuesday
saying
if
we
want
to
intervene
seriously
we
have
to
have
the
courage
to
adopt
strong
measures
her
comments
followed
a
court
ruling
in
germany
that
cities
there
can
ban
the
most
heavily
polluting
diesel
cars
from
their
streets
about
of
the
million
new
cars
sold
in
italy
last
year
were
diesel
according
to
industry
figures
rome
has
no
major
industries
so
nearly
all
of
the
air
pollution
in
the
italian
capital
is
caused
by
motor
vehicles
the
city
regularly
tries
to
ban
older
more
polluting
vehicles
from
roads
on
days
when
pollution
reaches
critical
levels
it
has
also
tried
to
reduce
pollution
by
allowing
only
cars
whose
number
plates
end
in
either
odd
or
even
numbers
to
circulate
on
alternate
days
but
both
regulations
are
widely
flouted
and
lightly
enforced
by
traffic
police
to
skirt
the
alternate
days
regulation
many
families
buy
a
used
car
with
a
different
number
plate
apart
from
health
issues
pollution
from
combustion
engines
causes
severe
damage
to
rome
s
many
ancient
outdoor
monuments
according
to
a
study
last
year
by
a
branch
of
the
culture
ministry
stone
monuments
and
bronze
sculptures
risk
serious
deterioration
because
of
air
pollution
ahead
of
celebrations
marking
the
start
of
the
new
millennium
in
the
darkened
facade
of
peter
s
basilica
at
the
vatican
was
cleaned
as
part
of
a
project
that
lasted
several
years
but
fresh
signs
of
stains
are
visible
again
before
the
german
court
s
ruling
on
tuesday
officials
in
highly
industrialized
milan
in
northern
italy
had
already
announced
plans
to
make
the
city
diesel
