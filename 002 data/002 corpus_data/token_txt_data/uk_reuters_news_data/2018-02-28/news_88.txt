jerome
powell
noted
in
his
testimony
on
tuesday
that
the
economy
was
strong
inflation
was
ticking
higher
and
that
the
global
backdrop
was
better
than
in
december
when
asked
about
likely
catalysts
for
more
than
three
rate
hikes
in
he
said
each
member
would
write
a
new
dot
plot
rate
path
ahead
of
the
march
meeting
and
that
he
wouldn
t
want
to
prejudge
that
outcome
these
comments
highlighted
to
market
participants
the
possibility
that
at
the
march
meeting
the
fed
s
median
dot
could
move
up
signalling
that
four
rather
than
just
three
hikes
were
likely
to
be
appropriate
in
said
michelle
girard
chief
economist
at
natwest
markets
while
we
believe
the
possibility
exists
that
the
median
dot
for
moves
higher
that
is
not
yet
our
base
case
girard
added
whether
or
not
the
median
dot
shifts
we
are
sticking
with
our
view
that
the
fed
will
hike
rates
four
times
in
fears
of
faster
rate
hikes
have
fed
fears
that
other
central
banks
will
start
to
tighten
policy
and
raise
borrowing
costs
that
would
in
turn
hurt
corporate
earnings
clouding
the
outlook
for
what
had
been
expected
to
be
another
solid
year
of
global
economic
growth
the
fed
had
caused
a
so
called
taper
tantrum
in
may
when
it
signalled
it
was
time
to
stop
pumping
cash
into
the
economy
a
move
that
created
havoc
in
financial
markets
in
asia
asian
markets
have
so
far
taken
rate
rises
in
their
stride
the
fed
moved
three
times
in
and
is
seen
as
certain
to
do
the
same
or
more
this
year

the
first

as
early
as
