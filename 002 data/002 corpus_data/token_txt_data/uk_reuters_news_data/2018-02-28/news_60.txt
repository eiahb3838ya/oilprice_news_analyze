world
stocks
were
set
to
snap
a
record
long
winning
streak
on
wednesday
tumbling
another
quarter
percent
after
new
fed
boss
jerome
powell
s
comments
suggested
the
possibility
of
four
interest
rate
rises
this
year
rather
than
three
barely
recovered
from
an
equity
sentiment
has
been
shaken
by
powell
and
by
data
showing
china
s
manufacturing
sector
slowing
to
its
weakest
in
over
years
and
japanese
industrial
output
down
the
most
since

equity

signalled
wall
street
would
open
flat
after
declines
of
more
than
percent
on
tuesday
when
the
federal
reserve
chief
delivered
his
debut
testimony
to
congress
powell
had
struck
a
mildly
hawkish
note
noting
inflation
had
risen
since
december
and
vowing
to
prevent
the
economy
from
but
that
was
enough
for
traders
to
add
bets
on
the
fed
squeezing
in
another
rate
rise
this
year
with
futures
now
pricing
a
chance
of
a
fourth
hike
yields
retreated
after
rising
on
tuesday
towards
highs
though
the
dollar
hovered
near
three
week
peaks
and
is
set
for
a
monthly
rise
against
a
basket
of
currencies
after
three
months
of
declines
on
equities
msci

index
fell
percent
capping
a
turbulent
month
that
saw
trillions
of
dollars
wiped
off
share
markets
during
an
volatility
explosion
after
yesterday
the
market
is
contemplating
that
we
will
probably
get
four
rate
hikes
this
year
and
you
have
seen
the
reaction
in
equities
and
treasuries
said
peter
garnry
head
of
global
equities
at
saxo
bank
in
stockholm
powell
also
said
financial
conditions
remained
accommodative
despite

wall

the

closed
tuesday
with
its
biggest
daily
rise
since
easing
only
slightly
on
wednesday
the
fed
put
for
equities
is
likely
still
there
but
it
s
weaker
garnry
said
referring
to
investors
assumption
that
the
central
bank
would
intervene
to
prop
up
equity
markets
the
recent

hiccup
has
changed

emerging
equities
fell
percent
pulled
down
by
a
percent
tumble
in
hong
kong
and
set
for
their
biggest
monthly
loss
since
november
while
japan
s
nikkei
lost
percent
and
snapped
a
run
of
gains
a
fall
in
new
orders
for
capital
goods
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
plus
the
dismal
chinese
and
japanese
numbers
are
also
making
investors
fret
about
a
possible
setback
to
growth
especially
in
china
the
world
s
no
economy
not
everyone
is
bearish
however
equities
and
risk
assets
may
wobble
as
yields
rise
but
stronger
growth
should
be
good
for
corporate
earnings
and
offset
the
impact
from
the
expected
increase
in
central
bank
policy
rates
the
world
s
biggest
asset
manager
blackrock
said
unicredit
analysts
agreed
they
said
that
while
markets
might
price
in
higher
interest
rates
these
would
likely
remain
modest
and
also
hinge
on
economic
data
staying
robust
as
long
as
both
of
these
conditions
are
met
we
do
not
believe
that
powell
s
testimony
threatens
to
derail
risk
appetite
at
least
not
in
a
sustained
way
they
told
clients
markets
are
ending
february
pretty
much
as
they
began
it
on
a
sour
note
spooked
by
concerns
inflation
would
pick
up
and
that
central
banks
could
end
up
tightening
policy
further
and
faster
than
originally
anticipated
the
msci
index
remains
more
than
percent
below
record
highs
hit
at
the
end
of
january
equity
gains
from
here
may
be
hindered
by
bond
markets
with
yields
close
to
the
psychologically
key
percent
level
and
up
basis
points
this
month
ubs
wealth
management
predicted
that
gdp
data
later
in
the
day
would
reinforce
the
picture
of
an
economy
performing
at
or
above
trend
justifying
four
rate
hikes
this
year
but
the
bank
of
japan
and
european
central
bank
could
act
as
counterweights
euro
zone
inflation
for
february
at
percent
showed
on
wednesday
that
the
ecb
s
target
remains
years
away
german
bond
yields
meanwhile
are
set
for
their
first
monthly
fall
since
october
down
basis
points
in
february
while
japanese
yields
are
just
off
