french
utility
edf
will
not
be
allowed
to
start
up
its
new
flamanville
nuclear
reactor
without
the
approval
by
the
country
s
asn
regulator
of
a
solution
to
welding
edf
said
last
week
that
more
than
half
of
the
weldings
on
the
reactor
s
secondary
cooling
circuit
did
not
meet
the
required
specifications
it
said
this
would
not
affect
flamanville
s
safety
or
the
schedule
to
load
it
with
fuel
at
the
end
of
however
an
asn
spokeswoman
said
on
wednesday
the
weldings
problem
could
have
an
impact
on
the
calendar
edf
s
flamanville
reactor
the
same
epr
reactor
it
is
building
in
hinkley
point
britain
is
years
behind
schedule
and
billions
over
budget
the
utility
will
have
to
present
solutions
to
the
asn
which
will
then
seek
input
from
experts
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
before
deciding
whether
the
weldings
are
fit
for
service
the
spokeswoman
said
it
seemed
unlikely
that
asn
would
receive
a
full
report
on
the
issue
from
edf
before
the
summer
she
added
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
the
asn
said
that
this
report
would
have
to
measure
the
impact
on
reactor
safety
of
the
problems
with
the
welding
the
reactor
s
original
safety
documentation
does
not
address
the
impact
of
a
possible
rupture
of
the
weldings
because
they
were
designed
to
be
the
asn
said
it
had
also
asked
edf
to
study
the
possibility
of
repairing
the
weldings
or
replacing
the
piping
in
june
the
asn
ruled
that
flamanville
s
vessel
cover
would
have
to
be
replaced
just
six
years
after
startup
because
carbon
concentrations
in
its
steel
could
make
it
brittle
