reuters
ukrainian
energy
firm
naftogaz
said
on
wednesday
russia
s
gazprom
would
have
to
pay
it
billion
billion
pounds
after
a
stockholm
court
found
in
naftogaz
s
favour
in
the
final
stage
of
a
legal
battle
in
june
gazprom
and
naftogaz
lodged
claims
against
each
other
with
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
which
resolves
commercial
disputes
the
disagreement
was
a
of
the
worsening
relations
between
kiev
and
moscow
since
russia
s
annexation
of
crimea
and
the
eruption
of
separatist
violence
in
ukraine
s
donbass
region
which
has
killed
more
than
people
the
latest
ruling
in
stockholm
which
concludes
the
legal
dispute
centred
on
naftogaz
s
claims
that
it
was
owed
compensation
for
gazprom
not
pumping
a
certain
volume
of
gas
per
year
via
ukraine
and
paying
too
little
for
what
it
did
send
through
naftogaz
pipelines
naftogaz
was
awarded
damages
of
billion
for
gazprom
s
failure
to
deliver
the
agreed
transit
gas
volumes
naftogaz
spokeswoman
olena
osmolovska
said
there
was
no
immediate
comment
from
gazprom
since
the
court
previously
ordered
naftogaz
to
pay
gazprom
for
gas
supply
arrears
the
net
payment
gazprom
will
have
to
make
to
ukraine
is
billion
osmolovska
said
the
arbitration
institute
of
the
stockholm
chamber
of
commerce
does
not
publish
or
comment
on
its
rulings
leaving
it
up
to
parties
involved
to
go
public
if
they
want
to
in
previous
rulings
the
court
denied
gazprom
s
claim
linked
to
a
clause
that
required
buyers
to
pay
for
gas
whether
they
take
physical
delivery
or
not
and
found
in
naftogaz
s
favour
in
terms
of
pricing
but
it
also
ordered
naftogaz
to
pay
billion
to
gazprom
for
the
gas
arrears
and
ruled
that
it
should
buy
bcm
of
gas
from
gazprom
annually
