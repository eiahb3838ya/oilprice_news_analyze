an
early
resumption
of
peace
talks
on
cyprus
was
impossible
president
nicos
anastasiades
said
on
wednesday
accusing
rival
turkey
of
violating
international
law
in
a
row
over
offshore
oil
and
gas
exploration
cyprus
and
turkey
are
at
odds
in
a
race
to
tap
hydrocarbons
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
an
area
which
has
yielded
some
of
the
world
s
largest
natural
gas
finds
in
the
past
decade
but
which
has
also
brought
grievances
to
the
surface
a
vessel
charted
by
italy
s
eni
was
unable
to
reach
an
area
cyprus
has
licensed
for
drilling
because
of
turkish
military
manoeuvres
in
a
standoff
in
february
the
two
states
do
not
have
diplomatic
relations
and
ankara
maintains
that
greek
cypriots
who
run
cyprus
s
government
are
violating
either
turkish
or
turkish
cypriot
rights
greek
cypriots
say
the
same
about
turkey
and
the
dispute
appears
to
leave
little
room
for
compromise
unfortunately
turkey
and
our
turkish
cypriot
compatriots
appear
to
be
not
only
unwilling
to
in
talks
but
with
additional
violations
of
international
law
and
unacceptable
demands
render
the
resumption
of
talks
impossible
at
least
at
the
present
time
anastasiades
told
the
country
s
parliament
he
said
that
he
would
be
willing
to
in
dialogue
if
turkey
rescinded
its
unlawful
actions
and
turkish
cypriots
their
unacceptable
claims
the
veteran
conservative
started
a
second
term
at
the
helm
of
the
island
nation
on
wednesday
cyprus
was
split
in
a
turkish
invasion
in
triggered
by
a
brief
coup
and
repeated
attempts
at
reconciliation
have
failed
greek
cypriots
live
in
its
south
and
turkish
cypriots
in
the
north
natural
gas
discoveries
by
egypt
and
israel
in
areas
not
far
from
cyprus
have
given
sharper
focus
to
the
island
s
standoff
the
discoveries
could
either
add
impetus
to
a
deal
on
cyprus
or
impede
resolving
a
complex
conflict
on
and
boundaries
that
concern
tens
of
thousands
of
internally
displaced
people
on
either
side
of
the
divide
anastasiades
said
his
government
had
prepared
legislation
to
create
a
sovereign
hydrocarbons
fund
in
previous
consultations
the
two
sides
had
also
agreed
on
how
potential
revenue
would
be
distributed
he
said
eni
and
france
s
total
reported
in
early
february
a
promising
natural
gas
field
south
of
cyprus
which
they
said
looked
geologcally
similar
to
the
mammoth
zohr
field
off
egypt
