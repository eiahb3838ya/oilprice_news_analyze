oil
analysts
expect
the
price
of
crude
to
rise
steadily
this
year
but
remain
in
a
tight
band
dictated
by
shale
output
growth
on
one
side
and
opec
supply
restraint
on
the
other

projected
in
the

s
poll
opec
s
level
of
compliance
with
agreed
production
curbs
and
the
pace
of
shale
s
output
growth
are
likely
to
be
the
key
fundamental
price
drivers
in
ashley
petersen
of
stratas
advisors
said
prices
will
likely
be
more
volatile
in
than
driven
by
whipsawing
sentiment
around
the
pace
of
oil
production
could
surpass
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
with
production
already
near
a
record
above
million
bpd
the
has
stolen
the
show
somewhat
said
cailin
birch
an
analyst
at
the
economist
intelligence
unit
that
its
oil
market
is
dominated
by
a
large
number
of
uncoordinated
firms
many
of
whom
benefit
from
lower
production
costs
than
producers
elsewhere
means
the
will
remain
a
major
player
for
the
foreseeable
meanwhile
opec
is
closing
in
on
its
goal
of
reducing
oil
inventories
held
by
industrial
nations
to
their
average
figures
from
the
group
s
head
of
research
showed
this
month
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
producers
led
by
russia
have
agreed
to
cap
output
by
about
million
bpd
in
a
deal
running
from
january
last
year
until
the
end
of
saudi
arabia
last
week
said
it
hoped
opec
and
its
allies
would
be
able
to
relax
production
curbs
next
year
and
create
a
permanent
framework
to
stabilize
oil
markets
after
the
deal
expires
the
supply
deal
remains
a
key
uncertainty
for
the
oil
market
a
transition
of
the
deal
is
needed
but
not
yet
visible
with
both
an
and
an
orderly
unwinding
being
potential
scenarios

analysts
said
that
without
a
smooth
exit
from
the
pact
global
inventories
may
drop
sharply
and
trigger
a
potentially
damaging

rise
oil
output
in
venezuela
one
of
opec
s
larger

has
dropped
to
its
lowest

more
than

the

grapples
with
an

to
absorb
part
of
the

rising
global
oil
demand
will
be
driven
mainly
by
