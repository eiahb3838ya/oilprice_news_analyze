nigeria
s
people
are
getting
poorer
despite
the
country
s
slow
recovery
from
recession
and
economic
reforms
are
urgently
needed
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
said
in
a
report
seen
by
reuters
on
wednesday
the
fund
expects
the
government
to
muddle
through
in
the
medium
term
and
any
progress
could
also
be
threatened
if
elections
next
year
consume
political
energy
and
resources
the
report
said
since
emerging
from
recession
in
the
second
quarter
of
nigerian
officials
have
repeatedly
boasted
that
they
have
set
the
economy
back
on
track
but
critics
say
much
of
the
recovery
comes
from
a
return
to
oil
dependence
after
a
rise
in
global
oil
prices
and
a
rebound
in
crude
production
more
the
result
of
militants
in
the
niger
delta
halting
attacks
on
oil
facilities
than
of
economic
policy
under
president
muhammadu
buhari
s
administration
the
imf
said
in
the
report
that
the
outlook
for
growth
has
improved
but
remains
challenging
comprehensive
and
coherent
economic
policies
remain
urgent
and
must
not
be
delayed
by
approaching
elections
and
recovering
oil
prices
it
said
in
its
annual
article
iv
review
of
nigeria
s
economy
higher
oil
prices
would
support
a
recovery
in
but
a
outlook
is
projected
for
the
medium
term
under
current
policies
with
fiscal
dominance
and
structural
constraints
leading
to
continuing
falls
in
real
gdp
per
capita
the
imf
said
in
the
report
it
identified
risks
to
growth
including
additional
delays
to
implementing
policies
and
reforms
ahead
of
elections
security
tensions
and
oil
prices
a
fall
in
which
could
see
capital
flows
reversed
further
delays
in
policy
action
including
because
of
pressures
can
only
make
the
inevitable
adjustment
more
difficult
and
costlier
the
report
said
the
lender
repeated
its
call
for
nigeria
to
simplify
its
complex
foreign
exchange
system
a
bugbear
for
the
imf
for
more
than
a
year
which
has
left
large
gaps
between
official
rates
and
various
windows
that
certain
groups
can
use
to
get
other
rates
moving
towards
a
unified
exchange
rate
should
be
pursued
as
soon
as
possible
the
imf
said
imf
staff
does
not
support
the
exchange
measures
that
have
given
rise
to
the
exchange
restrictions
and
multiple
currency
the
fund
further
singled
out
the
central
bank
saying
it
should
discontinue
direct
interventions
in
the
economy
the
central
bank
of
nigeria
cbn
frequently
injects
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
into
the
foreign
exchange
market
to
keep
its
own
rates
stable
commercial
banks
struggling
to
remain
solvent
were
also
called
out
but
not
identified
by
the
imf
including
one
that
the
lender
said
was
already
insolvent
some
of
these
banks
are
kept
afloat
through
continuous
recourse
to
the
cbn
s
lending
the
imf
said
it
does
not
comment
on
purported
leaks
a
spokeswoman
for
the
fund
said
a
statement
would
be
issued
after
the
lender
s
board
meets
to
discuss
its
assessment
on
friday
a
nigerian
finance
ministry
spokeswoman
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
phone
call
and
email
requesting
comment
