that
any
reports

are
fake

with
cabinet
officials
and
senators
to
discuss
potential
changes
to
the
renewable

standard
to
help
refiners
who
say
they
are
struggling
under
the

like

with
he

perdue
said
a
spokesman
for
the
department
of
agriculture
confirmed
that
perdue
made
the
comments
trump
s
meeting
on
tuesday
reflected
rising
concern
in
the
white
house
over
the
current
state
of
the
rfs
which
has
increasingly
divided
two
of
trump
s
most
important
constituencies
the
energy
industry
and
rural
farmers
a
refining
company
in
pennsylvania
a
state
that
often
plays
a
key
role
deciding
the
outcome
in
national
elections
last
month
blamed
the
regulation
for
its
bankruptcy
this
bolstered
charges
by
the
industry
that
the
rfs
is
unfair
and
costly
the
white
house
meeting
was
held
at
the
request
of
republican
senator
ted
cruz
of
texas
and
was
intended
to
get
chuck
grassley
and
joni
ernst
both
republican
senators
from
the
corn
state
iowa
to
accept
significant
changes
to
the
program
aimed
at
providing
financial
relief
to
refiners
the
senators
said
on
tuesday
they
were
asked
to
support
placing
price
caps
at
the
center
of
the
program
in
exchange
for
greater
use
of
blended
gasoline
the
administration
was
also
considering
allowing
exported
ethanol
to
qualify
for
credits
under
the
program
the
senators
said
the
senators
said
the
proposals
would
gut
the
program
and
attempt
to
solve
a
problem
high
costs
for
refiners
that
does
not
exist
perdue
offered
a
different
perceptive
of
the
meeting
describing
it
more
as
a
listening
session
than
a
negotiation
he
listened
to
both
sides
and
told
senators
grassley
and
ernst
that
he
will
be
strong
for
farmers
and
maintain
the
rfs
grassley
said
the
white
house
is
expected
to
hold
another
meeting
on
thursday
with
merchant
refiners
and
biofuel
groups
though
a
full
list
of
participants
was
not
immediately
