british
foreign
minister
boris
johnson
praised
social
reforms
in
saudi
arabia
on
wednesday
seeking
to
neutralise
any
potential
criticism
over
human
rights
and
the
war
in
yemen
ahead
of
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
s
visit
to
london
next
week
prince
mohammed
will
arrive
in
london
on
march
for
talks
with
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
and
other
senior
ministers
his
first
trip
to
britain
since
being
named
heir
to
the
throne
last
summer
when
he
effectively
took
over
running
the
country
despite
him
enacting
a
programme
of
social
reforms
his
visit
is
expected
to
spark
protests
over
wider
rights
issues
including
saudi
arabia
s
role
in
yemen
where
more
than
people
have
been
killed
in
a
conflict
since
but
johnson
said
prince
mohammed
deserved
support
for
overturning
a
ban
on
women
driving
relaxing
gender
segregation
and
setting
a
target
to
get
more
women
into
the
saudi
workforce
if
you
are
inclined
to
dismiss
these
advances
then
i
will
respectfully
suggest
that
you
are
making
a
profound
mistake
he
wrote
in
an
article
for
the
times
newspaper
change
does
not
come
easily
in
saudi
arabia
in
a
matter
of
a
few
months
genuine
reform
has
taken
place
after
decades
of
describing
saudi
arabia
as
one
of
britain
s
oldest
friends
in
the
region
johnson
highlighted
the
importance
of
defence
cooperation
both
to
counter
islamic
state
militants
and
as
a
diplomatic
counterweight
to
iran
s
middle
east
influence
britain
has
openly
sought
to
woo
saudi
arabia
ahead
of
the
expected
stock
market
listing
of
state
oil
company
saudi
aramco
which
could
be
the
largest
such
offering
in
history
both
may
and
president
donald
trump
want
the
potentially
lucrative
listing
to
take
place
on
their
stock
exchanges
but
the
government
s
support
for
prince
mohammed
has
been
criticised
by
rights
groups
and
opposition
lawmakers
particularly
over
the
licensing
of
billion
pounds
worth
of
arms
sales
to
saudi
arabia
since
the
start
of
the
yemen
conflict
london
says
it
has
strict
controls
on
arms
sales
and
on
tuesday
may
said
she
would
be
discussing
the
conflict
and
humanitarian
situation
in
yemen
frankly
and
constructively
with
prince
mohammed
