crude
oil
production
shattered
a
output
record
in
november
and
retreated
slightly
in
december
the
energy
department
said
on
wednesday
as
oil
production
from
shale
continued
to
upend
global
supply
patterns
oil
output
rose
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
november
a
revision
from
earlier
estimates
the
eia
said
december
production
fell
bpd
to
million
bpd
it
said
november
s
figure
exceeded
the
million
barrels
produced
daily
in
november
output
has
surged
in
the
last
several
years
due
to
the
shale
boom
pushing
the
united
states
past
saudi
arabia
among
top
producers
only
russia
now
has
greater
daily
oil
output
the
new
record
probably
will
not
last
the
government
forecasts
production
will
hit
million
barrels
per
day
later
this
year
we
ve
got
a
lot
more
oil
to
produce
and
we
ll
be
through
that
million
threshold
much
sooner
than
expected
said
phillip
streible
senior
market
strategist
at
rjo
futures
in
chicago
the
gains
are
primarily
due
to
rising
production
in
shale
regions
in
texas
and
north
dakota
output
there
ramped
up
sharply
at
the
beginning
of
the
decade
as
new
techniques
involving
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
allowed
drillers
to
extract
vast
quantities
of
crude
from
oil
fields
the
increase
in
crude
output
has
cut
oil
imports
by
a
fifth
over
a
decade
and
boosted
energy
exports
soaring
production
kept
a
lid
on
oil
prices
this
year
even
though
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
russia
have
reduced
output
in
december
production
pulled
back
after
three
consecutive
increases
according
to
the
eia
the
decline
was
driven
by
offshore
gulf
of
mexico
output
which
dropped
by
bpd
in
the
month
four
gulf
of
mexico
platforms
were
shuttered
throughout
the
month
after
a

the
eia
said
total
crude
oil
and
products
demand
in
december
was
million
bpd
up
about
percent
from
million
bpd
a
year
earlier
and
down
about
percent
from
the
previous
month
americans
consumed
percent
less
gasoline
in
than
they
did
in
the
prior
year
eia
data
showed
marking
the
first
decrease
since
gasoline
demand
was
million
barrels
in
the
data
showed
demand
for
gasoline
hit
record
levels
in
averaging
million

natural

rose
to
a
monthly
high
of
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
in
december
from
the
prior
record
of
bcfd
in
november
the
eia
said
the
increase
was
driven
by
a
percent
gain
in
pennsylvania
to
a
record
bcfd
and
a
percent
gain
in
louisiana
to
bcfd
output
in
