a

said

said

that
it
was
appealing
the
ruling
environmentalists

local
fisherman
say
spoil
banks
created
during
pipeline
dredging
disrupt
natural
water
flow
in
the
basin
and
suffocate

many

the

confirmed
that
the
army
corps
can
t
just
keep
issuing
more
permits
for

in
the
atchafalaya
and
ignoring
the
fact
that
they
are
routinely
violated
jan
hasselman
an
attorney
for

the
group
representing
the
plaintiffs
said
on
wednesday
after
decades
of
noncompliance
with
the
law
which
has
devastated
the
basin
there
is
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
the
oil
and
gas
industry
will
start
being
held
accountable
he
added
the
association
of
oil
pipe
lines
an
industry
group
said
pipelines
have
the
least
amount
of
local
environmental
and
climate
change
impacts
compared
with
other
transport
methods
