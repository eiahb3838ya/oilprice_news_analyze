utility
eskom
to
from
on
wednesday
citing
liquidity
concerns
and
insufficient
government
support
that
left
it
at
risk
of
a
default
eskom
provides
virtually
all
of
south
africa
s
power
and
is
seen
as
a
risk
to
the
sovereign
rating
of
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
after
years
of
mismanagement
and
shoddy
governance
eskom
which
has
been
facing
serious
liquidity
issues
appointed
a
new
board
of
directors
last
month
to
resolve
a
leadership
crisis
new

appointed
former

as
public

in

of
state
firms
such
as
eskom
gordhan
who
has
been
part
of
a
parliamentary
probe
into
eskom
s
woes
is
a
popular
figure
with
investors
and
there
will
be
high
expectations
for
him
to
clean
up

s
p
s
latest
decision
on
eskom
takes
it
deeper
into
junk
status
seven
notches
below
investment
grade
into
territory
described
as
a
substantial
risk
the
ratings
agency
also
placed
eskom
on
a
negative
outlook
eskom
remains
at
risk
of
facing
a
distressed
exchange
situation
or
default
in
the
next
six
months
despite
securing
billion
rand
billion
in
funding
from
local
and
international
funders
so
far
this
year
s
p
said
we
now
believe
there
is
a
lower
likelihood
that
eskom
would
receive
extraordinary
support
from
the
government
reflecting
our
view
that
government
support
for
the
utility
over
the
past
few
months
has
been
insufficient
given
that
the
utility
s
liquidity
concerns
persist
it
said
in
a
statement
eskom
said
it
wanted
to
provide
enough
comfort
to
investors
and
would
continue
to
engage
with
the
rating
agencies
and
other
players
to
implement
a
turnaround
strategy
eskom
s
interim
group
chief
executive
phakamani
hadebe
said
the
state
had
provided
support
to
solve
its
liquidity
problems
acting
chief
financial
officer
calib
cassim
said
the
timing
of
the
downgrade
is
unfortunate
as
we
believe
that
we
are
starting
to
see
slight
improvements
in
market
eskom
also
said
it
had
agreed
a
billion
rand
credit
facility
with
seven
local
and
international
banks
eskom
s
eurobonds
fell
across
the
curve
after
the
downgrade
with
eskom
s
eurobond
falling
cent
to
cents
to
the
dollar
according
to
tradeweb
the
issue
fell
cents
to

investors
in
the
utility
s
bonds
were
confident
the
changes
in
government
would
help
the
utility
attract
funding
eskom
will
have
an
easier
time
than
in
december
to
finance
itself
to
get
bridge
financing
and
continue
on
this
is
a
more
market
friendly
government
than
the
previous
one

eskom
bonds
over
governance
concerns
said
it
would
before
deciding
to
reinvest
it
s
not
for
investors
to
prescribe
to
eskom
what
changes
to
make
but
decisions
do
need
to
be
made
by
the
board
to
put
eskom
back
on
to
sound
operational
footing
