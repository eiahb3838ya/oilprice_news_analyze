asian

after
data

growth
in

s
manufacturing
sector
in

slowed
more

the

in

also
slowed
suggesting

the

sector
accounts
for
over
half
of

s
economy
however
analysts
cautioned
the
timing
of
the
long
holiday
may
have
skewed
the
activity
readings
and
a
clearer
picture
of
conditions
in
china
may

sentiment
was
already
sour
after
fed
s
jerome
powell
gave
an
upbeat
view
of
the
economy
on
tuesday
and
said
recent
data
had
strengthened
his
confidence
on
inflation
when
asked
about
likely
catalysts
for
more
than
three
rate
hikes
in
he
said
each
member
would
write
a
new
dot
plot
rate
path
ahead
of
the
march
meeting
and
that
he
wouldn

want

rate
futures
fell
following
powell
s
remarks
as
traders
began
pricing
in
about
a
chance
of
a
fourth
hike
this
year
fears
of
faster
rate
hikes
have
caused
anxiety
that
other
central
banks
will
start
to
tighten
policy
and
raise
borrowing
costs
that
would
in
turn
hurt
corporate
earnings
clouding
the
outlook
for
what
had
been
expected
to
be
another
solid
year
of
global
economic
growth
today
s
comments
appear
to
open
the
door
for
others
on
the
fed
committee
to
revise
their
forecast
as
they
see
fit
and
that
powell
himself
may
be
inclined
to
look
for
four
hikes
this
year
jpmorgan

michael
feroli
said
in
a
note
we
are
naturally
more
confident
in
our
standing
call
for
four
hikes
this

another
four

is
