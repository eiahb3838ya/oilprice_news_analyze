update 2-germany weighs options to avoid diesel bans after ruling
berlin
reuters
germany
s
government
scrambled
on
wednesday
to
find
ways
to
avoid
bans
on
heavily
polluting
diesel
vehicles
in
major
cities
seeking
to
reassure
drivers
and
carmakers
after
a
court
ruled
that
local
authorities
were
allowed
to
bar
them
tuesday
s
ruling
to
allow
city
bans
embarrassed
angela
merkel
s
government
criticized
for
having
cosy
ties
with
the
auto
industry
which
employs
some
people
and
raises
pressure
on
manufacturers
to
make
costly
modifications
to
vehicles
in
germany
where
motorists
expect
to
drive
powerful
cars
in
cities
and
on
motorways
with
no
speed
limits
any
restrictions
will
be
unpopular
yet
air
quality
is
also
a
big
concern
with
green
and
consumer
groups
pushing
for
action
merkel
s
government
is
at
pains
to
play
down
the
prospect
of
widespread
bans
which
companies
say
could
cut
the
resale
value
of
up
to
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
biggest
car
market
bans
could
also
herald
the
end
of
the
combustion
engine
which
germans
pride
themselves
on
having
invented
this
is
a
complicated
topic
there
are
different
situations
in
different
cities
said
government
spokesman
steffen
seibert
overall
some
cities
including
hamburg
and
stuttgart
have
been
found
to
have
excess
levels
of
nitrogen
oxide
nox
seibert
said
nox
levels
had
fallen
in
recent
years
and
many
cities
would
not
have
to
resort
to
bans
but
he
acknowledged
solutions
were
needed
for
cities
with
significantly
higher
levels
of
the
gas
which
can
cause
respiratory
diseases
he
added
that
a
new
government
under
conservative
merkel
would
consider
the
option
of
introducing
a
nationwide
blue
badge
scheme
to
indicate
how
clean
a
car
is
details
of
any
such
schemes
have
not
been
agreed
until
now
the
environment
ministry
has
favored
this
option
arguing
it
would
help
local
authorities
control
bans
however
opposition
is
also
strong
blue
badges
are
a
more
positive
way
of
describing
a
driving
ban
and
i
am
very
doubtful
about
that
said
stephan
weil
premier
of
the
state
of
lower
saxony
home
to
volkswagen
europe
s
biggest
carmaker
since
vw
in
admitted
to
cheating
emissions
tests
german
carmakers
also
including
daimler
and
bmw
have
faced
a
backlash
against
diesel
technology
in
which
they
have
invested
billions
while
slowly
moving
toward
electric
cars
and
committing
to
software
changes
critics
accuse
the
government
of
skirting
bigger
steps
such
as
phasing
out
diesel
france
and
britain
will
ban
new
petrol
and
diesel
cars
by
rome
one
of
europe
s
most
cities
plans
to
ban
diesel
cars
from
its
center
by
its
mayor
said
and
a
number
of
other
european
cities
are
considering
curbs
carmakers
in
germany
are
also
trying
to
avoid
expensive
hardware
modifications
to
exhaust
systems
weil
said
refits
were
not
a
panacea
especially
not
for
smaller
cars
with
little
room
for
additional
equipment
i
prefer
a
modernization
of
the
diesel
fleet
he
told
die
welt
daily
the
solution
is
modern
vehicles
that
do
not
or
barely
pollute
the
air
and
an
expansion
of
electric
vehicles
he
said
one
factor
complicating
any
policymaking
on
a
national
basis
is
a
difference
in
emphasis
within
the
german
government
which
until
now
has
been
a
coalition
of
merkel
s
conservatives
and
the
social
democrats
spd
merkel
hopes
to
renew
that
coalition
but
needs
the
approval
of
spd
members
results
of
a
ballot
on
the
deal
will
be
announced
on
sunday
and
a
government
could
be
in
place
in
march
differences
were
evident
on
wednesday
when
a
spokesman
for
the
transport
ministry
run
by
conservatives
said
hardware
modifications
to
diesel
cars
could
be
very
expensive
and
must
bear
some
relation
to
the
value
of
the
vehicle
meanwhile
justice
and
consumer
affairs
minister
heiko
maas
of
the
spd
said
carmakers
must
take
responsibility
drivers
must
not
foot
the
bill
for
the
failures
of
the
auto
industry
maas
told
the
rheinische
post
daily
adding
software
upgrades
were
insufficient
he
also
said
the
possibility
of
lawsuits
outlined
in
the
coalition
deal
would
help
diesel
car
owners
a
measure
demanded
by
consumer
groups
after
the
vw
scandal
other
measures
floated
include
introducing
free
public
transport
in
some
cities
at
the
weekend
documents
seen
by
reuters
showed
the
government
was
considering
bans
on
certain
routes
on
an
emergency
basis
