the

suggesting
a
jump
in
prices
early
this
year
to
their
highest
since

not
weakened
commitment

opec
says
supply
restraints
should
be
maintained
to
ensure
the
end
of
a
glut
that
has
built
up
since
we
still
feel
that
the
job
is
not
complete
uae
energy
minister
suhail
told
reuters
this
month
the
price
is
one
thing
rebalancing
the
market
is
something
else
and
we
need
to
balance
the
opec
is
reducing
output
by
about
million
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
the
pact
started
in
january
and
will
run
until
the
end
of
in
february
the
biggest
decrease
in
supply
came
from
the
uae
which
holds
the
rotating
opec
presidency
this
year
and
was
slower
than
its
gulf
opec
allies
in
to
meet
its
commitments
fully
uae
output
has
fallen
by
bpd
to
below
its
opec
target
sources
in
the
survey
said
reflecting
an
effort
to
step
up
compliance
and
planned
oilfield
maintenance
the
drop
occurred
in
libya
where
output
fell
by
bpd
because
of
the
closure
of
the
el
feel
oilfield
after
a
protest
by
guards
this
set
back
a
recovery
in
libyan
supply
which
had
hit
million
bpd
in
january
production
has
fallen
further
in
venezuela
where
the
oil
industry
is
starved
of
funds
because
of
a
cash
crunch
the
survey
found
exports
fell
in
february
although
refinery
operations
increased
sources
in
the
survey
said
output
in
opec
s
two
largest
producers
was
little
changed
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
kept
output
steady
close
to
million
bpd
according
to
sources
in
the
survey
supply
remains
below
the
kingdom
s
opec
target
opec
s
no
producer
iraq
exported
fewer
barrels
from
the
south
the
outlet
for
most
of
its
crude
as
bad
weather
delayed
shipments
the
country
exported
more
from
the
north
northern
iraqi
exports
could
rise
following
an
agreement
by
the
government
with
kurdish
authorities
to
resume
kirkuk
oil
exports
through
turkey
s
ceyhan
port
although
a
specific
timeframe
was
not
disclosed
among
countries
with
higher
output
the
largest
gain
of
only
bpd
was
in
nigeria
the
survey
found
nigeria
and
libya
were
originally
exempt
from
cutting
supply
because
their
output
had
been
curbed
already
by
conflict
and
unrest
for
both
countries
told
opec
that
output
would
not
exceed
levels
ministers
and
delegates
said
opec
has
an
implied
production
target
for
of
million
bpd
based
on
cutbacks
detailed
in
late
and
taking
into
account
changes
of
membership
since
plus
nigeria
and
libya
s
expectations
of
output
according
to
the
survey
opec
pumped
bpd
below
this
implied
target
in
february
not
least
because
of
the
involuntary
decline
in
venezuela
