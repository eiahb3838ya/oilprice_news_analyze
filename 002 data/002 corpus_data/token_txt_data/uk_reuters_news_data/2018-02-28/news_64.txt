while
the

warned
of
up
to
cm
of
snow
in
parts
of
scotland
and
ireland
braced
for
what
could
be
its
biggest
snowfall
since
the
cold
snap
comes
just
days
after
a
law
was
introduced
in
britain
s
parliament
aimed
a
capping
consumers
energy
bills
a
move
which
british

centrica
said
could
hurt

the

is

their
highest
for
at

years
wholesale
power
prices
rose
percent
as
much
as
percent
of
britain
uses
natural
gas
for

heating
meaning
cold

can
have
a
big
impact
on

was
almost
percent
higher
than
normal
national

data
showed
an
outage
at
the
kollsnes
gas
processing
plant
sparked
concerns
about
imports
from
norway
which
over
the
past
two
years
has
provided
about
percent
of
britain
s
gas
some
of
which
is
to
ireland
thomson
reuters
data
showed
smaller
outages
at
british
sites
supplying
gas
from
the
north
sea
added
to
supply
concerns
britain
s
ability
to
respond
to
demand
shocks
has
been
hampered
by
the
closure
last
year
of
centrica
s
rough
gas
storage
site
the
country
s
largest
at
its
operational
peak
rough
could
store
around
percent
of
britain
s
gas
demand
very
high
demand
combined
with
some
supply
outages
is
underlying
the
impact
of
the
loss
of
flexibility
driven
by
the
closure
of
rough
and
the
big
reductions
in

showed
britain

utilities
typically
hedge

many
months
in

so
price
spikes
should
not
automatically
trigger
higher
prices
for
customers
but
smaller
suppliers
which
account
for
around
percent
of
the
