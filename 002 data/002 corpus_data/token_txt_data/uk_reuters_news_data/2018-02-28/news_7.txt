brazil
s
supreme
court
on
wednesday
upheld
major
changes
to
laws
that
protect
the
amazon
and
other
biomes
reducing
penalties
for
past
illegal
deforestation
in
a
blow
to
environmentalists
trying
to
protect
the
world
s
largest
rainforest
congress
agreed
to
sweeping
revisions
in
the
law
in
that
included
an
amnesty
program
for
illegal
deforestation
on
small
properties
that
occurred
before
and
reduced
restoration
requirements
in
others
the
changes
effectively
reduced
deforested
land
that
must
be
restored
under
previous
rules
by
square
miles
square
km
an
area
nearly
the
size
of
italy
according
to
a
study
published
in
the
journal
science
environmentalists
said
that
the
revised
laws
known
collectively
as
the
forest
code
would
create
a
culture
in
which
illegal
deforestation
is
acceptable
this
awards
the
guy
who
deforested
awards
the
guy
who
disobeyed
the
law
said
nurit
bensusan
policy
coordinator
at
the
brazilian
organization
instituto
socioambiental
with
this
amnesty
you
create
a
climate
that
invites
deforestation
in
the
future
it
creates
the
impression
that
if
you
deforest
today
tomorrow
you
ll
be
handed
farmers
and
the
agriculture
lobby
argue
that
the
new
laws
allowed
for
continued
growth
of
the
sector
key
to
the
brazilian
economy
without
bogging
it
down
in
ajudicating
crimes
of
the
past
the
court
decision
has
finally
brought
legal
certainty
to
rural
producers
by
forgiving
penalties
for
deforestation
before
provided
they
comply
with
the
law
as
rewritten
in
said
rodrigo
lima
director
of
agriculture
consultancy
agroicone
if
this
apparatus
had
been
struck
down
for
example
everyone
who
submits
information
on
the
rural
land
registry
could
be
fined
at
any
moment
even
as
they
are
complying
with
the
current
the
protections
in
question
include
those
that
apply
to
the
amazon
rainforest
the
majority
of
which
lies
in
brazil
which
is
vital
to
soaking
up
carbon
emissions
and
countering
climate
change
deforestation
in
the
amazon
fell
in
the
august
to
july
monitoring
period
for
the
first
time
in
three
years
although
the
square
km
square
miles
cleared
of
forest
remains
well
above
the
low
recorded
in
and
targets
for
slowing
climate
change
in
televised
oral
arguments
attorney
general
grace
mendonca
defended
the
revisions
as
constitutional
saying
that
they
had
been
designed
to
strike
a
balance
between
environmental
protection
and
economic
development
but
many
parts
of
the
law
designed
to
protect
the
environment
have
not
been
enforced
with
measures
such
as
a
national
registry
of
rural
land
still
not
fully
implemented
