factbox-wider impact of bans on diesel cars in german cities
berlin
feb
reuters
german
cities
are
able
to
ban
the
most
polluting
diesel
cars
after
a
landmark
court
ruling
allowing
them
to
decide
the
extent
to
which
any
curbs
should
be
implemented
if
at
all
tuesday
s
ruling
by
germany
s
highest
administrative
court
in
leipzig
is
expected
to
further
drive
the
shift
away
from
combustion
engines
and
could
force
carmakers
to
pay
to
improve
exhaust
systems
here
are
some
of
the
possible
consequences
for
german
automakers
and
drivers
after
the
ruling
which
may
hit
the
value
of
million
vehicles
in
europe
s
largest
car
market
any
driving
bans
would
probably
affect
vehicles
equipped
with
technology
and
older
models
of
the
million
diesel
cars
on
germany
s
roads
last
year
about
million
were
fitted
with
the
latest
standard
which
has
applied
to
all
new
cars
sold
since
september
according
to
the
kba
motor
vehicle
watchdog
the
court
said
there
will
be
no
right
to
financial
compensation
for
car
owners
in
the
wake
of
possible
driving
bans
but
it
called
for
proportionality
possible
bans
should
affect
only
older
models
with
the
highest
emissions
and
curbs
must
be
accompanied
by
sufficient
exceptions
for
groups
relying
heavily
on
diesel
cars
and
vans
including
city
residents
and
tradespeople
such
as
delivery
repair
and
emergency
workers
it
said
authorities
in
about
german
cities
including
munich
hamburg
and
stuttgart
which
were
found
to
have
excess
levels
of
toxic
nitrogen
oxide
nox
have
started
deliberating
if
and
how
they
will
adjust
clean
air
programmes
to
comply
with
the
ruling
hamburg
said
it
would
start
implementing
limits
on
diesel
vehicles
from
the
end
of
april
stuttgart
said
it
would
take
about
six
months
to
redraw
strategies
before
deciding
on
concrete
steps
civil
movements
and
environmentalists
have
reinforced
calls
on
the
government
to
end
their
cosy
ties
with
automakers
and
force
the
industry
to
swallow
the
costs
of
upgrading
diesel
exhaust
cleaning
systems
carmakers
have
so
far
rejected
costly
hardware
changes
saying
retrofitted
vehicles
would
end
up
consuming
more
fuel
and
emitting
more
carbon
dioxide
the
court
made
clear
that
uniform
nationwide
rules
on
tackling
diesel
pollution
are
not
necessary
but
with
the
ruling
seen
as
a
precedent
for
all
cities
in
germany
it
will
revive
discussion
about
introducing
ways
to
label
cleaner
diesel
cars
for
instance
via
blue
badges
germany
s
coalition
parties
the
christian
democrats
and
social
democrats
have
made
no
provisions
in
their
policy
platform
for
a
blue
badge
environmentalists
said
blue
badges
are
inexpensive
and
easy
to
implement
while
critics
including
germany
s
transport
minister
have
said
they
would
expropriate
millions
of
drivers
diesel
car
resale
values
in
germany
have
held
broadly
stable
in
the
aftermath
of
the
volkswagen
emissions
scandal
but
have
been
declining
since
last
july
while
values
for
gasoline
vehicles
started
to
rise
at
about
the
same
time
data
by
market
researcher
deutsche
automobil
treuhand
gmbh
showed
with
driving
bans
now
more
likely
analysts
expect
this
trend
to
continue
also
backed
by
rising
diesel
new
car
sales
across
europe
and
the
equivalent
drop
in
gasoline
registrations
