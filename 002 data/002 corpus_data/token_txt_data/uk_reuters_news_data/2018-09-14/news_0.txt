panama canal head expects fewer china, u.s. ships if trade war escalates
panama
city
reuters
fewer
ships
from
china
and
the
united
states
could
use
the
panama
canal
if
trade
tensions
escalate
between
the
two
economic
giants
but
the
dip
could
be
offset
by
grain
exports
from
north
brazil
the
head
of
the
organization
that
operates
the
waterway
said
the
canal
which
cuts
through
panama
creating
an
essential
shipping
route
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
is
a
major
source
of
revenue
for
the
central
american
country
most
cargoes
passing
through
the
panama
canal
come
from
or
go
to
the
united
states
and
china
panama
canal
authority
chief
jorge
quijano
told
reuters
late
on
thursday
tensions
between
them
could
ultimately
have
an
impact
on
the
amount
of
loadings
using
the
waterway
in
any
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
is
readying
a
list
of
billion
in
chinese
imports
on
which
it
plans
to
levy
tariffs
in
coming
days
stepping
up
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
however
quijano
said
he
expected
more
bulk
cargo
from
brazil
the
world
s
largest
soy
producer
would
boost
canal
traffic
brazilian
soy
has
traditionally
been
shipped
across
the
atlantic
and
indian
oceans
but
farmers
in
top
soy
state
mato
grosso
earlier
this
year
signed
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
canal
to
look
at
ways
to
cut
transport
costs
and
increase
grain
volumes
using
the
waterway
via
ports
in
the
north
of
brazil
new
demand
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
countries
including
japan
and
mexico
could
also
compensate
for
fewer
vessels
going
to
china
quijano
added
saying
the
canal
has
many
ways
to
ease
any
the
panama
canal
has
not
disclosed
updated
figures
on
vessel
transit
by
volume
in
its
fiscal
year
which
ended
in
september
it
handled
a
record
million
tonnes
including
million
tonnes
in
container
ships
and
million
tonnes
in
bulk
carriers
brazil
and
argentina
have
already
taken
a
greater
share
of
the
asian
grains
markets
leading
to
lower
traffic
through
the
canal
in
the
first
few
months
of
quijano
said
to
offset
that
panama
needs
to
convince
brazilian
exporters
to
use
the
canal
quijano
said
about
million
tonnes
of
brazilian
soy
went
through
the
canal
last
year
out
of
annual
soy
exports
of
around
million
tonnes
brazilian
data
shows
for
lng
exports
almost
percent
passing
through
the
canal
comes
from
the
united
states
according
to
figures
from
the
panama
canal
authority
if
china
eventually
imports
less
lng
from
the
united
states
we
will
see
more
imports
from
japan
korea
and
mexico
which
would
compensate
