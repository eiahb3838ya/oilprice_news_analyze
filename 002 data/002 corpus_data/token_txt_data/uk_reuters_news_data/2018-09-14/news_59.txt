asian
shares
rose
on
friday
as
the
united
states
and
china
looked
set
to
launch
a
new
round
of
trade
talks
amid
an
escalating
tariff
row
while
a
decisive
interest
rate
hike
by
turkey

also

with

shanghai
composite

falling
less

having
spent
much
of
the
day
wavering
between
gains
and
losses
investors
in
china
were
assessing
new
data
showing
industrial
output
and
retail
sales
data
for
august
alongside
falling
real
estate
investment
there
were
underlying
concerns
that
a
cooling
property
market
could
increase
risks
for
the
economic
outlook
as
the
trade
environment
worsens
china
s
index
turned
around
from
earlier
losses
to
gain
percent
what
the
market
wants
is
some
degree
of
certainty
said
jim
mccafferty
head
of
equity
research
asia
at
nomura
i
think
everyone
knows
that
the
trade
deal
might
not
be
as
optimistic
as
it
might
have
been
in
june
or
july
and
it
might
be
negative
for
many
chinese
companies
but
the
fact
that
there
s
no
certainty
there
is
one
reason
that
investors
are
staying
on
the
news
of
a
possible
new
round
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
comes
even
as
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
looks
set
to
escalate
chinese
officials
welcomed
an
invitation
from
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
for
new
talks
but
president
donald
trump
tempered
market
expectations
tweeting
on
thursday
that
the
is
under
no
pressure
to
make
a
deal
with
the
trump
administration
is
readying
a
final
list
of
billion
in
chinese
imports
on
which
it
plans
to
levy
tariffs
in
the
coming
days
a
move
that
many
fear
would
mark
a
severe
escalation
in
the
trade
war
and
put
a
significant
dent
in
global
growth
the
news
on
wednesday
that
us
officials
had
invited
china
to
restart
trade
talks
suggests
that
the
announcement
of
tariffs
on
of
chinese
imports
may
be
delayed
but
we
think
the
chance
that
fresh
talks
will
defuse
trade
tensions
is
low
capital
economics
analysts
said
in
a
note
the
analysts
noted
that
mnuchin
had
brokered
a
deal
with
china
in
may
that
was
scuppered
days
later
by
trump
as
a
result
he
has
little
credibility
with
chinese
policymakers
they
said
on
friday
the
china
daily
newspaper
said
in
an
editorial
that
china
would
not
surrender
to
demands
and
that
beijing
will
not
hesitate
to
take
countermeasures
against
tariffs
to
safeguard
china
s
chinese
state
councillor
wang
yi
the
country
s
top
diplomat
also
put
trade
into
the
spotlight
on
friday
commenting
that
the
current
world
trade
system
is
not
perfect
and
china
supports
reforms
to
it
uncertainty
around
the
global
outlook
for
trade
was
highlighted
by
the
european
central
bank
which
on
thursday
kept
policy
unchanged
as
expected
and
warned
that
risks
from
protectionism
were
gaining
prominence
but
a
sharp
interest
rate
hike
by
turkey
s
central
bank
to
support
a
tumbling
lira
boosted
risk
appetite
in
emerging
markets
in
a
rare
show
of
independence
the
bank
raised
its
benchmark
interest
rate
by
basis
points
to
percent
the
bank
raised
the
rate
even
after
it
came
under
criticism
by
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
who
repeated
his
opposition
to
high
interest
rates
on
thursday
and
said
high
inflation
was
a
result
of
the
central
bank
s
wrong
steps
currency
crises
both
in
turkey
and
argentina
have
stoked
fears
of
contagion
over
the
past
several
weeks
hammering
emerging
market
assets
from
indonesia
to
india
to
south
africa
after
rising
as
high
as
to
the
dollar
the
lira
was
at
on
friday
the
turkish
central
bank
seems
to
have
regained
some
credibility
after
hiking
rates
to
an
percent
this
move
looks
to
have
reset
investor
expectations
for
the
lira
and
let
some
investors
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
said
hannah
anderson
global
market
strategist
morgan

management
however
this
is
not
enough
to
assuage
all
investor
worries
about
em
individual
emerging

being
buffeted
by
highly
local
cross
currents

the
context

sentiment

thursday
the

sensitive

a

the

fell
thursday
after
data
showed
consumer

rose
less
than
expected
in
august
and
underlying

appeared
to
be
slowing
suggesting
the
