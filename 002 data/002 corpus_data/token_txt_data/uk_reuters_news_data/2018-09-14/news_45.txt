berlin
reuters
the
supervisory
board
of
volkswagen
will
meet
on
monday
to
discuss
the
future
of
rupert
stadler
the
suspended
chief
executive
of
its
premium
brand
audi
german
magazine
der
spiegel
reported
on
friday
the
magazine
said
the
board
was
due
to
decide
whether
stadler
who
has
been
in
police
custody
since
as
part
of
a
broader
probe
into
emissions
cheating
at
audi
should
give
up
his
position
citing
sources
close
to
the
company
spiegel
said
it
was
probable
that
stadler
would
be
asked
to
relinquish
the
role
seeing
as
he
was
unable
to
perform
the
duties
of
an
executive
both
vw
and
audi
have
said
that
stadler
is
presumed
innocent
unless
proven
otherwise
a
source
told
reuters
the
reason
for
the
supervisory
board
meeting
was
to
discuss
further
steps
towards
a
possible
listing
of
vw
s
truck
and
bus
subsidiary
and
not
stadler
however
sources
close
to
the
company
expect
that
the
board
will
also
talk
about
stadler
although
no
decisions
are
expected
volkswagen
declined
to
comment
on
the
report
in
july
volkswagen
recruited
bmw
engine
development
and
purchasing
expert
markus
duesmann
who
has
been
touted
as
a
potential
successor
to
stadler
as
vw
looks
for
expertise
to
help
it
shake
off
the
emissions
scandal
stadler
was
forced
to
step
down
temporarily
after
he
was
taken
into
custody
on
suspicion
of
interfering
with
an
emissions
investigation
