london

reuters
european
carbon
the
year
s
commodity
suffered
its
biggest
fall
in
a
decade
this
week
after
a
surge
in
prices
triggered
a
call
for
government
intervention
and
weak
auction
demand
losses
by
a
norwegian
power
trader
that
left
a
million
hole
in
the
nasdaq
clearing
house
s
contingency
plan
added
to
market
jitters
analysts
said
benchmark
eu
allowances
euas
jumped
percent
in
just
four
trading
sessions
hitting
a
high
above
euros
a
tonne
before
a
kicked
in
they
were
trading
at
at
gmt
on
friday
off
about
percent
on
the
week
after
euas
jumped
to
euros
poland
said
it
was
time
for
the
european
commission
to
act
the
situation
calls
for
intervention
we
need
to
ask
the
european
commission
to
look
into
it
energy
minister
krzysztof
tchorzewski
told
news
agency
pap
it
wasn
t
the
only
factor
but
the
call
from
poland
certainly
spooked
the
market
one
carbon
trader
said
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
poland
is
wary
of
high
carbon
prices
as
that
adds
costs
for
its
utilities
which
generate
most
of
their
power
from
polluting
coal
it
is
the
first
call
for
intervention
but
i
would
imagine
that
the
visgard
bloc
might
follow
suit
said
nick
campbell
a
director
at
consultancy
inspired
energy
referring
to
the
czech
republic
hungary
and
slovakia
the
high
prices
slowed
demand
at
thursday
s
eu
eua
auction
however
with
a
cover
ratio
of
lower
than
recent
sales
and
a
signal
to
traders
that
demand
was
dwindling
other
negatives
for
carbon
this
week
included
thursday
s
unwinding
of
positions
across
the
european
energy
complex
after
losses
by
the
norwegian
power
trader
this
will
make
a
lot
of
market
participants
unsure
about
trading
schemes
said
martin
andreas
vik
an
adviser
to
the
norwegian
water
resources
and
energy
directorate
while
analysts
doubted
poland
would
be
successful
in
prompting
the
eu
to
act
to
curb
carbon
prices
the
market
hitting
euros
did
reignite
analysis
of
reforms
set
to
start
next
year
including
the
market
stability
reserve
msr
which
will
remove
some
surplus
euas
from
the
market
the
eu
s
emissions
trading
system
ets
charges
more
than
factories
and
power
stations
for
every
tonne
of
carbon
dioxide
they
emit
it
was
set
up
in
as
part
of
eu
efforts
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
percent
by
yet
the
market
has
suffered
from
excess
supply
since
the
financial
crisis
a
problem
set
to
be
addressed
by
measures
such
as
the
msr
market
intervention
could
also
take
the
form
of
the
eu
actually
returning
surplus
euas
to
the
market
in
the
event
of
runaway
prices
reuters
analysts
estimated
prices
would
have
to
hold
at
euros
a
tonne
for
six
months
to
meet
intervention
criteria
under
article
of
the
eu
s
carbon
market
rules
however
under
article
intervention
to
return
allowances
would
only
be
triggered
if
the
price
rise
was
not
rooted
in
fundamental
reasons
it
would
be
a
tough
one
to
argue
that
the
eua
price
rise
is
purely
speculative
and
not
caused
by
the
anticipation
of
the
supply
squeeze
due
to
the
market
stability

thomson
reuters
carbon
analyst
hege
fjellheim
said
the
language
in
the
article
is
open
to
different
interpretations
fjellheim
said
the
european
commission
declined
to
elaborate
on
how
the
article
would
work
one
source
at
the
commission
said
it
welcomed
the
stronger
prices
and
that
conditions
to
trigger
intervention
have
not
been
met
