iran says oil market is too tight for u.s. zero exports target
london

the
will
find
it
difficult
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
completely
as
the
oil
market
is
already
tight
and
rival
producers
can
not
make
up
the
shortfall
a
top
iranian
official
said
on
friday
washington
is
seeking
to
cut
iranian
oil
exports
to
zero
by
november
as
it
reimposes
sanctions
and
is
encouraging
other
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
other
opec
members
and
russia
to
pump
more
to
meet
the
shortfall
even
so
the
expected
loss
of
iranian
oil
declining
supply
from
another
opec
member
venezuela
and
other
outages
are
boosting
crude
prices
which
this
week
hit
a
barrel
the
highest
since
may
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
said
in
comments
to
reuters
that
a
supply
shortage
meant
that
the
united
states
would
not
be
able
to
meet
its
zero
export
target
there
is
no
spare
capacity
anywhere
he
said
a
adviser
at
saudi
arabia
s
energy
ministry
also
said
last
month
that
current
sanctions
on
iran
were
unlikely
to
stop
iranian
oil
exports
completely
under
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
oil
prices
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
agreed
in
june
to
boost
production
having
participated
in
a
deal
in
place
since
while
opec
production
has
increased
since
then
saudi
arabia
has
added
less
crude
than
it
initially
indicated
kazempour
has
voiced
scepticism
that
other
producers
can
add
much
more
oil
the
opec
governor
is
typically
the
second
most
senior
post
in
a
country
s
opec
delegation
after
the
oil
minister
kazempour
has
represented
iran
in
that
position
for
many
years
