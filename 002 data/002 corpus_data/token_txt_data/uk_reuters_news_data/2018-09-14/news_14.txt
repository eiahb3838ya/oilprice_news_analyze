china
s
sinopec
corp
has
joined
a
group
planning
to
build
an
oil
refinery
in
alberta
an
enterprise
that
would
strengthen
demand
for
the
canadian
province
s
heavily
discounted
crude
sinopec
formally
known
as
china
petroleum
chemical
corp
along
with
an
alberta
indigenous
group
china
state
construction
engineering
corp
and
alberta
management
company
teedrum
plan
to
build
a
refinery
to
process
barrels
per
day
of
crude
into
gasoline
and
other
products
the
project
s
consulting
firm
stantec
inc
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
the
sinocan
global
refinery
would
cost
c
billion
with
a
financing
plan
still
to
be
worked
out
said
teedrum
president
ken
horn
who
is
leading
the
effort
ownership
has
not
been
determined
the
group
hopes
to
receive
regulatory
approval
from
the
alberta
and
canadian
governments
within
two
years
he
said
in
an
interview
on
friday
most
of
the
refined
products
will
be
exported
it
helps
create
value
for
the
bitumen
horn
said
referring
to
the
tarry
form
of
alberta
s
heavy
crude
right
now
we
ship
most
of
that
crude
out
of
the
province
we
should
do
a
lot
more
to
maximize
the
value
of
that
most
of
canada
s
crude
is
produced
in
landlocked
alberta
where
pipeline
capacity
has
not
expanded
as
rapidly
as
production
resulting
bottlenecks
have
hindered
transportation
to
refineries
steepening
an
already
deep
price
discount
for
the
province
s
crude
which
grew
to
a
high
this
week
sinopec
s
interest
is
encouraging
news
for
a
canadian
sector
that
has
seen
foreign
oil
majors
retreat
over
concerns
about
high
production
costs
and
the
oil
sands
environmental
toll
china
s
involvement
would
complement
its
existing
alberta
investments
horn
said
cnooc
ltd
bought
energy
producer
nexen
in
if
sinopec
plans
to
ship
refined
products
from
canada
to
china
it
would
likely
move
them
by
rail
to
the
pacific
coast
since
pipeline
space
is
limited
said
gmp
firstenergy
analyst
michael
dunn
it
may
make
more
sense
for
china
to
import
canadian
crude
and
refine
it
domestically
he
said
alberta
s
previous
government
declined
to
support
the
refinery
proposal
in
after
deciding
the
project
did
not
make
economic
sense
this
time
the
project
involves
china
and
is
not
soliciting
government
help
horn
said
a
spokesman
for
alberta
energy
minister
margaret
said
on
friday
that
building
a
refinery
is
ambitious
and
positive
for
the
economy
if
the
project
can
competitively
move
refined
products
offshore
sinopec
could
not
be
reached
