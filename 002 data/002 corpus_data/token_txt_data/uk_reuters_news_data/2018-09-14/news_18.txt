more
than
a
dozen
others
in
the
largest
natural

pipeline
incident
in
nearly
a
decade
the

could
provide
insight
into
the
nation
s
aging
pipeline
infrastructure
roughly
half
of
the
million
miles
of
pipelines
crisscrossing
the
united
states
were
installed

gas
a
unit
of
nisource

owns
and
operates
nearly
miles

the
oldest
in

with
sections
built
more

that
it
repairs
more
than
leaks
a
year
on
average
mostly
on
its
main
line
pipes
in
for
example
replacing
pipes
was
expected
to
cost
it
about
million

told
customers
it
was
conducting
upgrades
on
parts
of
its
system
shortly
before
the
explosions
the
company

not
available
for
comment
columbia
gas
has
had
a
clear
safety
record
for
more

the
utility
has
said
it
does
not
expect
to
have
all
of
pipes
replaced
until
democratic

a

into
the
