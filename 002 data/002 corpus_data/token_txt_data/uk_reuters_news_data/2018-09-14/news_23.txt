reuters
saudi
arabia
the
united
states
and
russia
can
between
them
raise
global
output
in
the
next
months
to
compensate
for
falling
oil
supplies
from
iran
and
elsewhere
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
a
visit
to
moscow
on
friday
speaking
in
an
interview
with
reuters
perry
said
he
had
a
positive
feeling
about
saudi
arabia
s
ability
to
maintain
and
even
increase
its
level
of
production
he
said
there
were
a
number
of
reasons
for
that
among
them
the
prospect
that
kuwait
and
saudi
arabia
would
soon
resolve
a
border
dispute
unlocking
access
to
an
oil
field
in
the
contested
area
perry
said
that
in
the
united
states
he
expected
a
more
substantial
increase
in
crude
output
over
the
next
months
than
the
increases
seen
so
far
as
new
pipeline
capacity
is
brought
on
stream
russia
meanwhile
was
working
diligently
to
deliver
output
to
the
world
market
perry
said
so
i
don
t
foresee
spikes
in
world
oil
prices
he
said
in
the
interview
some
analysts
have
expressed
concerns
about
saudi
arabia
s
long
term
ability
to
significantly
boost
output
on
washington
s
fraught
political
relationship
with
russia
perry
said
both
he
and
his
russian
counterpart
energy
minister
alexander
novak
would
rather
not
seen
an
expansion
of
sanctions
but
he
said
the
ball
was
in
russia
s
court
russia
has
the
opportunity
to
send
a
message
that
they
are
going
to
be
good
neighbours
they
are
going
to
be
civilised
in
the
way
they
deal
with
their
neighbours
that
has
yet
to
be
seen
from
our
perspective
in
dealing
with
russia
s
conduct
towards
other
countries
would
influence
whether
the
united
states
was
compelled
to
impose
sanctions
on
the
nord
stream
pipeline
project
until
those
signals
get
sent
the
potential
sanctions
of
nord
stream
are
still
very
real
