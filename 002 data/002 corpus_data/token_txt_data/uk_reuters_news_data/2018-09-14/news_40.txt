third
straight
day

million
rupees
worth
of

on

extending
the

to
billion
rupees
worth
of
shares
sentiment
was
also
weighed
down
by
the
local
currency
hitting
a
fresh
low
for
the
third
straight
session
the
colombo
stock
index
ended
percent
weaker

the

was
million
rupees
million
less
than
this
year
s
daily
average
of
million
rupees
market
is
down
dominated
by
foreign
selling
fear
of
rupee
depreciation
and
also
fuelled
by
the
nomura
report
said
reshan
kurukulasuriya
chief
operating
officer
richard
pieris
securities
pvt
japanese
bank
nomura
holdings
ranked
sri
lanka
among
seven
emerging
market
economies
that
were
at
risk
of
an
exchange
rate
crisis
however
the
central
bank
in
a
statement
said
nomura
holdings
has
made
a
serious
computational
error
with
regard
to
sri
lanka
s
external
vulnerability
and
its
external
debt
is
nowhere
near
the
billion
figure
that
nomura
analysts
quoted
nomura
later
corrected
the
figure
to
billion
but
said
its
analysts
have
used
the
same
figure
to
calculate
the
country
s
damocles
score
for
the
analysis
and
thus
it
is
unchanged
investors
have
been
raising
concerns
over
consistency
in
the
government
s
policy
after
it
changed
some
budget
policies
announced
last
year
analysts
said
the
fuel
price
increase
also
hurt
investor
confidence
as
it
could
hurt

of
companies
sri
lankan
fuel
retailers
raised
gasoline
and
diesel
prices
for
a
third
time
in
four
months
on
tuesday
due
to

global
oil
prices
and
a
