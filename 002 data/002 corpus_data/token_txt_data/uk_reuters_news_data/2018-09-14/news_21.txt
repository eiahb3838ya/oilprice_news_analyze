interview-big three oil states can offset fall in iran supplies: perry
moscow
reuters
saudi
arabia
the
united
states
and
russia
can
between
them
raise
global
output
in
the
next
months
to
compensate
for
falling
oil
supplies
from
iran
and
elsewhere
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
on
a
visit
to
moscow
on
friday
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
which
come
into
force
in
november
have
already
cut
supply
back
to
lows
while
falling
venezuelan
output
and
unplanned
outages
elsewhere
could
push
up
crude
prices
hurting
consumers
but
perry
in
an
interview
with
reuters
said
he
felt
comfortable
about
the
outlook
for
global
crude
output
and
for
oil
prices
i
don
t
foresee
spikes
perry
said
although
he
added
there
was
always
the
potential
for
unforeseen
events
some
analysts
have
expressed
concerns
about
saudi
arabia
s
ability
to
significantly
boost
output
but
perry
said
there
s
a
number
of
things
going
on
in
the
kingdom
that
continue
to
give
me
a
very
positive
feeling
about
their
ability
to
maintain
their
level
and
even
increase
their
level
of
crude
production
he
cited
the
prospect
that
kuwait
and
saudi
arabia
would
soon
resolve
a
border
dispute
unlocking
access
to
an
oil
field
in
a
contested
area
they
are
working
toward
a
solution
in
the
not
too
distant
future
he
said
on
production
which
has
already
been
growing
over
the
past
few
years
perry
said
you
look
out
months
and
i
think
you
ll
see
even
a
more
substantial
increase
in
the
united
states
because
of
pipeline
capacity
being
built
russia
meanwhile
was
working
diligently
to
deliver
its
oil
output
to
the
world
market
perry
said
perry
was
in
moscow
for
talks
with
his
russian
counterpart
energy
minister
alexander
novak
visits
by
senior
officials
are
a
rarity
after
relations
between
moscow
and
washington
nosedived
first
over
the
ukraine
crisis
and
later
over
allegations
of
russian
meddling
in
the
presidential
election
the
administration
of
president
donald
trump
has
imposed
sanctions
on
russia
and
perry
said
that
while
he
would
rather
not
see
any
more
that
was
a
real
prospect
you
avoid
that
by
being
a
good
citizen
you
avoid
that
by
obviously
tending
to
this
issue
with
ukraine
you
do
this
by
not
meddling
in
our
elections
you
do
this
by
not
engaging
in
activities
that
are
considered
to
be
uncivilized
for
instance
the
poisoning
of
the
people
in
the
uk
perry
said
russia
has
the
opportunity
to
send
a
message
that
they
are
going
to
be
good
neighbors
they
are
going
to
be
civilized
in
the
way
they
deal
with
their
neighbors
that
has
yet
to
be
seen
from
our
perspective
in
dealing
with
russia
s
conduct
toward
other
countries
would
influence
whether
the
united
states
was
compelled
to
impose
sanctions
on
the
nord
stream
pipeline
project
the
project
will
expand
the
capacity
for
pumping
russian
gas
to
northern
europe
trump
has
criticized
it
saying
it
will
increase
european
dependence
on
russian
energy
referring
to
an
roadmap
for
resolving
a
conflict
in
eastern
ukraine
between
kiev
and
separatists
perry
said
if
russia
deals
with
the
minsk
agreement
in
an
appropriate
way
there
are
some
signals
being
sent
to
the
rest
of
the
european
until
those
signals
get
sent
the
potential
sanctions
of
nordstream
are
still
very
real
i
ll
suggest
to
you
that
the
ball
is
in
russia
s
court
he
said
in
the
interview
perry
issued
a
message
for
the
european
union
saying
it
needed
to
wean
itself
off
its
dependence
on
russian
energy
supplies
if
you
re
a
country
in
the
european
union
and
you
see
how
ukraine
has
been
treated
by
russia
then
russia
being
the
sole
source
or
practically
the
sole
source
of
gas
to
your
country
will
give
you
a
pause
perry
told
reuters
and
i
think
that
s
an
appropriate
and
rightful
position
to
take
have
alternatives
have
competition
have
other
pipelines
he
said
so
europe
by
and
large
understand
that
they
need
multiple
sources
of
energy
and
we
agree
