shares
around
the
world
have
been
buoyed
by
news
of
a
possible
new
round
of
talks
between
washington
and
beijing
even
as
the
trade
war
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
looks
set
to
escalate
chinese
officials
welcomed
an
invitation
from
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
for
new
talks
but
president
donald
trump
tempered
market
expectations
tweeting
on
thursday
that
the
is
under
no
pressure
to
make
a
deal
with
the
trump
administration
is
readying
a
final
list
of
billion
in
chinese
imports
on
which
it
plans
to
levy
tariffs
in
the
coming
days
a
move
that
many
fear
would
mark
a
severe
escalation
in
the
trade
war
and
put
a
significant
dent
in
global
growth
the
news
on
wednesday
that
us
officials
had
invited
china
to
restart
trade
talks
suggests
that
the
announcement
of
tariffs
on
of
chinese
imports
may
be
delayed
but
we
think
the
chance
that
fresh
talks
will
defuse
trade
tensions
is
low
capital

analysts
said
in
a
note
the
analysts
noted
that
mnuchin
had
brokered
a
deal
with
china
in
may
that
was
scuppered
days
later
by
trump
as
a
result
he
has
little
credibility
with
chinese
policymakers
they
said
the
uncertainty
around
the
trade
tensions
was
highlighted
by
the
european
central
bank
which
on
thursday
kept
policy
unchanged
as
expected
and
warned
that
risks
from
protectionism
were
gaining
prominence

characterized

citi
analysts
said
in
a
