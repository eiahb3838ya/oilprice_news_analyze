china's squeezed 'teapots' eye petchem path to riches
beijing

several
independent
chinese
refineries
are
drawing
up
plans
to
build
petrochemical
complexes
in
east
china
s
shandong
province
aiming
to
join
an
investment
boom
in
the
world
s
top
chemicals
market
china
is
allowing
greater
access
by
global
players
and
independent
local
companies
to
build
new
plants
to
help
narrow
an
import
gap
of
plastics
rubber
and
polyester
as
consumers
chase
goods
from
cars
to
electronics
major
exxon
mobil
corp
and
germany
s
basf
have
announced
investments
over
the
past
two
months
as
they
look
to
rival
local
firms
like
hengli
group
and
zhejiang
rongsheng
facing
tight
cash
flows
and
fierce
competition
in
a
saturated
fuel
market
china
s
small
refiners
known
as
teapots
are
also
eyeing
petrochemicals
as
a
potential
growth
area
although
analysts
warn
they
will
face
big
challenges
in
logistics
and
funding
the
widely
accepted
notion
among
shandong
refiners
is
that
if
you
don
t
move
into
petrochemicals
quickly
enough
you
ll
die
faster
said
an
executive
at
a
shandong
refiner

each
hired

said
a
second
industry
executive
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
he
did
not
give
details
of
products
or
plant
size
being
considered
but
said
that
for
a
petrochemical
complex
to
be
competitive
it
needs
at
least
a
million
tonne
per
year
tpy
ethylene
plant
plus
about
a
dozen
units
making
products
from
polyethylene
to
aromatics

is
waiting
for

feedback
after

a

eyeing

said
a
company
official
china
s
nearly
independent
refineries
enjoyed
several
years
of
bumper
profits
after
they
were
allowed
to
process
imported
crude
oil
in
but
their
fortunes
have
dwindled
due
to
tighter
tax
scrutiny
and
a
ban
on
fuel
exports
while
looming
competition
from
newer
larger
private
refiners
is
set
to
squeeze
margins
further
some
have
already
moved
into
new
areas
shandong
haike
group
opened
a
new
factory
that
makes
electrolytes
used
in
lithium
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
in
april
the
push
into
petrochemicals
however
would
involve
a
minimum
spend
of
at
least
billion
analysts
said
which
would
pose
challenges
large
banks
will
be
reluctant
to
loan
to
teapots
for
such
large
fixed
asset
spending
because
of
the
uncertain
prospects
said
an
executive
at
a
lender
who
funds
teapots
for
oil
imports
located
inland
with
no
easy
access
to
berths
chambroad
and
luqing
and
similarly
located
shandong
refineries
are
at
a
logistical
disadvantage
compared
with
petrochemical
plants
in
coastal
areas
and
closer
to
consumers
i
doubt
any
teapot
in
shandong
can
invest
in
big
ethylene
plants
under
current
circumstances
it
needs
large
capex
