that
his

it
came
as
a
surprise
even
to
the
company
s
chief
sustainability
officer
anirban
ghosh
said
it
had
been
agreed
that
only
the
group
s
largest
company
would
strive
to
become
carbon
neutral
producing
no
more
emissions
than
it
could
offset
elsewhere
but
plans
appeared
to
change
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
said
ghosh
with
the
chairman
promising
that
all
of
mahindra
s
nearly
companies
would
be
carbon
neutral
by
now
this
is
not
something
we
prepared

the

an
increasing
buzz

a
concept
that
everybody
gets

a
panel

cities
are
increasingly
setting
carbon

cut
their
greenhouse

emissions
