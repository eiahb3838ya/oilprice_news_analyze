hokkaido races to secure power supplies before winter grips island
tokyo

japan
is
racing
to
secure
power
supplies
ahead
of
winter
after
a
devastating
quake
left
people
dead
and
damaged
generating
stations
on
the
northern
island
of
hokkaido
where
temperatures
regularly
drop
well
below
zero
in
colder
months
although
the
government
has
eased
an
initial
percent
target
for
residential
and
business
customers
on
the
island
of
million
japan
s
trade
and
industry
minister
hiroshige
seko
has
said
power
supplies
on
hokkaido
will
remain
tight
and
unspecified
savings
are
still
needed
regional
utility
hokkaido
electric
power
is
rushing
to
repair
broken
generators
and
bring
on
idle
power
plants
but
those
efforts
will
come
up
against
the
brutal
reality
of
winter
in
hokkaido
where
temperatures
can
reach
as
low
as
minus
celsius
minus
fahrenheit
power
demand
on
hokkaido
in
winter
is
typically
more
than
a
third
higher
than
in
the
warmer
months
before
the
quake
the
harsh
reality
is
that
we
have
to
ask
for
power
savings
every
winter
in
hokkaido
trade
and
industry
minister
seko
told
reporters
on
friday
asked
if
he
was
confident
there
would
be
enough
supply
to
cope
with
the
rise
in
demand
seko
said
it
was
too
early
to
say
temperatures
in
urban
areas
on
the
island
are
already
dropping
below
celsius
in
early
morning
hours
while
snow
was
recorded
in
the
mountains
of
northern
hokkaido
on
the
earliest
snowfall
since
local
press
have
reported
sufficient
power
supplies
for
winter
heating
may
depend
on
whether
hokkaido
electric
can
get
its
biggest
plant
fully
operational
after
the
quake
damaged
all
three
generators
at
the
station
seko
said
on
tuesday
seko
said
his
ministry
will
investigate
hokkaido
electric
s
response
to
the
quake
which
left
an
island
the
size
of
austria
without
power
after
was
shut
down
it
was
the
nation
s
worst
outage
since
the
march
earthquake
and
tsunami
that
devastated
northeastern
japan
map
earthquake
in
hokkaido
fully
restarting
the
power
station
will
take
more
than
a
month
seko
said
earlier
this
week
hokkaido
electric
engineers
can
not
inspect
its
no
unit
the
biggest
because
it
is
still
too
hot
after
a
fire
broke
out
in
its
turbine
a
company
spokesman
told
reuters
by
phone
depending
on
the
damage
repairing
or
replacing
turbines
can
take
weeks
or
months
to
cover
the
shortage
the
utility
brought
online
by
friday
afternoon
two
units
at
its
kyogoku
plant
by
november
hokkaido
electric
says
it
also
plans
to
restart
three
units
undergoing
maintenance
it
is
also
firing
up
a
coal
power
station
it
planned
to
mothball
early
next
year
and
another
station
it
had
planned
to
close
next
year
the
utility
has
said
the
utility
will
as
well
start
testing
a
new
power
station
next
month
but
the
spokesman
said
the
utility
was
not
sure
the
unit
would
be
ready
ahead
of
winter
hokkaido
can
count
only
on
limited
supplies
from
the
main
island
of
honshu
because
of
the
fragmented
nature
of
japan
s
power
grid
power
demand
on
hokkaido
peaked
at
gigawatts
last
winter
according
to
hokkaido
electric
that
compares
with
about
gigawatts
on
the
day
before
the
quake
struck
about
gw
of
power
are
now
available
including
from
the
honshu
connection
