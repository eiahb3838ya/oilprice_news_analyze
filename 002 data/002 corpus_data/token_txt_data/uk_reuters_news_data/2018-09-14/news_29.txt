reuters
energy
companies
this
week
added
oil
rigs
for
the
second
time
in
the
last
three
weeks
even
as
new
drilling
has
largely
stalled
since
june
due
to
pipeline
constraints
in
the
country
s
biggest
oilfield
drillers
added
seven
oil
rigs
in
the
week
to
the
biggest
weekly
increase
in
a
month
bringing
the
total
count
to
general
electric
co
s
baker
hughes
energy
services
firm
said
in
its
closely
followed
report
on
friday
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
as
energy
companies
have
been
ramping
up
production
in
anticipation
of
higher
prices
in
than
previous
years
but
the
rig
count
has
held
mostly
steady
around
rigs
since
the
start
of
june
as
crude
prices
in
the
permian
region
in
western
texas
and
eastern
new
mexico
have
collapsed
due
to
a
lack
of
pipeline
infrastructure
needed
to
transport
more
fuel
out
of
the
region
the
permian
is
the
biggest
shale
oil
formation
in
the
united
states
the
only
way
to
get
drillers
in
the
permian
to
slow
their
production
growth
is
a
lower
oil
price
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
have
got
said
bjarne
schieldrop
chief
commodities
analyst
at
seb
a
nordic
corporate
bank
a
shale
boom
has
helped
send
production
surging
above
million
barrels
per

bpd
this
year
for
the
first
time
since
the
with
the
united

surpassing
russia
and
saudi
arabia
as
the
top
crude
producer
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
this
week
the
eia
however
said
in
its
monthly
forecast
that
crude
oil
production
in
was
expected
to
grow
at
a
slower
rate
than
previously
forecast
crude
production
is
expected
to
rise
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
next
year
lower
than
last

forecast
growth
of
a
to
million
crude
prices
were
trading
at
about
per
barrel
on
track
to
increase
about
percent
this
week
on

of
sanctions
against
iran
that
boosted
the
global
benchmark
brent
futures
to
a
high
over
a
barrel
earlier
this
week
so
far
this
year
oil
futures
have
averaged
per
barrel
that
compares
with
averages
of
in
calendar
and
in
looking
ahead
crude
futures
were
trading
near
for
the

this

forecast
the
average
combined
oil
and
natural
gas
rig
count
would
rise
from
in
to
in
in
and
in
since
oil
and
gas
rigs
were
already
in
service
drillers
would
only
have
to
add
a
handful
of
rigs
during
the
rest
of
the
year
to
hit
simmons
forecast
for
so
far
this
year
the
total
number
of
oil
and
gas
rigs
active
in
the
united
states
has
averaged
that
keeps
the
total
count
for
on
track
to
be
the
highest
