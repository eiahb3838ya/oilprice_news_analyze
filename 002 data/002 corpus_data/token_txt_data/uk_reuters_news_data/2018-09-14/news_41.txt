dutch
cyclists
rode
down
the
world
s
first
bike
path
made
entirely
of
discarded
plastic
this
week
in
a
move
aimed
at
reducing
the
millions
of
tonnes
wasted
every
year
the
cycling
path
in
the
northern
town
of
zwolle
contains
the
equivalent
of
plastic
bottle
caps
and
is
estimated
to
be
two
to
three
times
more
durable
than
traditional
roads
eight
million
tonnes
of
plastic
bottles
packaging
and
other
waste
are
dumped
into
the
ocean
every
year
killing
marine
life
and
entering
the
human
food
chain
the
united
nations
environment
programme
has
said
this
first
pilot
is
a
big
step
towards
a
sustainable
and
road
made
of
recycled
plastic
waste
the
path
s
inventors
anne
koudstaal
and
simon
jorritsma
said
in
a
statement
leading
environmental
expert
guus
velders
welcomed
the
new
initiative
by
dutch
engineering
firm
kws
pipe
maker
wavin
and
french
oil
major
total
saying
it
was
a
positive
step
towards
a
more
circular
use
of
materials
however
emma
priestland
campaigner
with
friends
of
the
earth
said
the
solution
to
plastic
pollution
lay
in
preventing
its
unnecessary
use
in
the
first
place
using
plastic
to
make
bicycle
paths
may
help
to
keep
plastics
out
of
landfill
and
but
it
s
still
unclear
what
happens
to
this
plastic
as
the
surface
of
the
path
is
worn
away

cities
such
as
london
amsterdam
and
paris
are
looking
at
how
they
can
shift
to
a
circular
economy
reusing
products
parts
and
materials
producing
no
waste
or
pollution
and
using
fewer
new
resources
and
energy
the
dutch
government
has
pledged
to
halve
its
use
of
raw
materials
by
and
accelerate
its
shift
towards
a
circular
economy
a
second
bike
path
is
expected
to
open
in
the
northeastern
dutch
village
of
