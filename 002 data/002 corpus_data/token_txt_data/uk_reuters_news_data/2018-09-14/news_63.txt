background

beijing
sept
reuters
china
s
aluminium
producers
cut
output
by
percent
in
august
from
the
month
before
government
data
showed
on
friday
as
high
raw
material
costs
squeeze
their
profit
margins
china
the
world
s
biggest
aluminium
producer
churned
out
million
tonnes
of
the
metal
last
month
according
to
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
nbs
that
was
down
from
million
tonnes
in
july
which
matched
the
monthly
high
but
was
up
percent
from
a
year
earlier
the
nbs
said
on
a
daily
basis
china
produced
around
tonnes
of
primary
aluminium
last
month
the
lowest
since
may
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
the
data
aluminium
prices
on
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
climbed
percent
over
august
but
spot
prices
for
alumina
the
substance
used
to
make
the
metal
rose
by
percent
in
the
key
eastern
china
region
over
the
same
period
pressuring
smelters
the
global
alumina
market
has
been
tight
this
year
due
to
an
outage
at
norsk
hydro
s
alunorte
plant
in
brazil
sanctions
on
russian
producer
rusal
and
a
strike
at
alcoa
s
alumina
refineries
in
western
australia
chinese
alumina
producers
have
taken
advantage
of
skyrocketing
international
alumina
prices
to
make
rare
exports
of
the
material
which
has
reduced
availability
domestically
victor
you
an
analyst
at
clsa
in
hong
kong
said
he
had
heard
of
aluminium
production
cuts
being
made
in
central
china
s
henan
province
which
he
described
as
traditionally
a
very
place
to
run
aluminium
smelters
that
s
because
a
lot
of
the
smelters
do
not
have
an
integrated
alumina
operation
if
they
have
to
source
from
outside
it
is
going
to
be
pretty
rough
for
them
he
said
spot
alumina
prices
in
central
china
are
currently
at
their
highest
since
december
aluminium
margins
have
been
falling
sharply
so
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
if
some
curtailments
happened
you
added
over
the
first
eight
months
of
china
produced
million
tonnes
of
aluminium
up
percent
the
nbs
data
showed
on
friday
output
of
a
group
of
nonferrous
metals
including
copper
aluminium
lead
zinc
and
nickel
rose
percent
to
million
tonnes
but
was
down
percent
from
million
tonnes
in
july
output
from
this
group
in
the
first
eight
months
was
up
percent
at
million
tonnes
the
other
metals
in
the
group
are
tin
antimony
mercury
magnesium
and
titanium
