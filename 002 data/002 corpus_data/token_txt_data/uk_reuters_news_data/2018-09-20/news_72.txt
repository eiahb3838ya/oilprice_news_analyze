australia
holds
the

in
the
enfield
oilfield
is
located
about
kilometres
miles
northwest
of
exmouth
in

australia

has
been
producing

since
traders
said
they
did
not
expect
a
big
impact
from
the
move
as
the
crude
grade
does
not
feed
into
any
particular
refinery
the
volume
isn
t
very
big
as
well
i
am
not
sure
which
other
grade
is
a
direct
replacement
but
west
african
grades
can
be
an
easy
alternative
