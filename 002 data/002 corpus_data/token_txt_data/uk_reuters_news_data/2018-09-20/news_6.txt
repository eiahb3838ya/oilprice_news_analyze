new
york
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
published
new
data
detailing
how
it
drastically
expanded
a
biofuels
waiver
program
for
oil
refiners
since
president
donald
trump
s
administration
took
office
responding
to
pressure
from
the
corn
lobby
to
boost
transparency
over
the
opaque
program
the
details
published
on
the
epa
s
website
on
thursday
showed
the
agency
issued
exemptions
for
small
refineries
for
freeing
them
from
their
requirement
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
to
blend
biofuels
into
gasoline
and
diesel
according
to
agency
data
released
on
thursday
that
was
up
from
waivers
granted
for
and
in
the
epa
said
the
data
provides
the
most
complete
picture
of
the
epa
s
expansion
of
the
controversial
small
refinery
waiver
program
to
date
the
waivers
save
the
oil
industry
money
but
biofuels
groups
worry
they
also
cut
into
the
nation
s
demand
for
ethanol
and
other
biofuels
and
have
criticized
trump
s
epa
for
over
using
the
exemptions
increasing
transparency
will
improve
implementation
of
the
rfs
and
provide
stakeholders
and
the
regulated
community
the
certainty
and
clarity
they
need
to
make
important
business
and
compliance
decisions
epa
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
said
in
a
statement
the
data
showed
that
the
number
of
gallons
exempted
from
the
rfs
under
the
waivers
granted
in
amounted
to
billion
nearly
double
the
billion
exempted
in
more
details
of
the
gallons
waived
are
available
here
the
epa
is
still
considering
five
waiver
requests
for
and
has
received
a
total
of
requests
for
all
of
which
are
also
still
pending
according
to
the
data
epa
had
previously
been
more
stingy
with
its
waivers
it
granted
of
the
waivers
requested
for
the
compliance
year
with
some
of
those
decisions
made
in
but
only
seven
out
of
requests
for
the
rfs
requires
oil
refiners
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
each
year
or
purchase
credits
from
those
that
do
small
refineries
can
apply
for
and
receive
waivers
if
they
demonstrate
that
compliance
with
their
requirements
would
cause
them
financial
hardship
the
epa
does
not
divulge
information
on
who
applies
for
or
receives
the
waivers
arguing
the
information
is
and
until
now
it
has
been
sparing
with
details
on
the
numbers
of
waivers
and
quantities
of
fuel
exempted
the
expansion
of
the
program
occurred
mainly
under
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
who
left
the
post
in
july
his
management
of
the
program
had
prompted
calls
from
biofuels
supporters
that
the
agency
release
more
detail
on
the
waivers
pressure
mounted
after
reuters
reported
that
large
refining
companies
including
chevron
exxon
mobil
marathon
and
andeavor
all
had
applied
for
the
exemptions
which
can
be
granted
based
on
the
size
of
an
individual
refinery
unit
rather
than
the
whole
company
renewable
fuels
association
president
and
chief
executive
officer
bob
dinneen
described
the
epa
s
new
data
release
as
a
step
in
the
right
but
he
said
more
was
needed
market
participants
and
the
public
deserve
to
know
exactly
who
is
receiving
small
refinery
exemptions
and
what
criteria
is
being
used
by
epa
in
making
the
decision
to
grant
or
deny
a
waiver
request
he
said
in
an
emailed
statement
prices
of
blending
credits
known
as
renewable
identification
numbers
rins
have
plunged
as
a
result
of
policy
uncertainty
and
expansion
of
the
waiver
program
they
fetched
around
cents
each
on
thursday
traders
said
from
the
previous
session
and
matching
a
near
low
struck
in
june
after
pruitt
s
exit
wheeler
said
he
would
follow
up
on
the
work
of
his
predecessor
to
overhaul
the
rfs
in
a
way
that
would
satisfy
both
the
oil
industry
and
the
biofuels
sector
