reuters
global
miner
rio
tinto
will
return
billion
to
shareholders
from
its
sale
of
australian
coal
assets
this
year
in
addition
to
existing
buyback
programs
it
said
on
thursday
the
news
helped
to
drive
rio
tinto
s
london
share
price
nearly
percent
higher
by
gmt
and
pushed
up
the
australian
listing
by
percent
across
the
mining
sector
a
trend
to
hand
money
back
to
shareholders
has
gathered
steam
following
a
recovery
from
the
mining
and
commodity
crash
of
and
pressure
from
investors
not
to
waste
growing
piles
of
cash
on
buying
up
assets
that
may
never
deliver
returns
in
its
latest
move
rio
tinto
which
has
already
returned
more
money
to
shareholders
than
its
peers
said
it
will
conduct
an
share
buyback
for
up
to
million
shares
in
its
australian
entity
rio
tinto
ltd
worth
about
billion
and
further
purchases
of
london
s
rio
tinto
plc
shares
bringing
the
total
to
billion
previous
buybacks
have
favored
the
london
arm
of
the
company
but
industry
sources
said
it
balanced
out
over
time
rio
tinto
had
already
announced
plans
in
august
for
a
billion
buyback
returning
billion
of
coal
disposal
proceeds
demonstrates
our
commitment
to
capital
discipline
and
providing
shareholder
returns
rio
tinto
chief
executive
jacques
said
in
a
statement
on
thursday
the
funds
come
from
the
proceeds
of
rio
tinto
s
exit
from
coal
early
this
year
it
sold
the
hail
creek
coal
mine
and
valeria
coal
project
to
glencore
winchester
south
to
whitehaven
coal
and
the
kestrel
coal
mine
to
private
equity
manager
emr
capital
and
indonesia
s
adaro
energy
tbk
in
total
the
assets
raised
billion
jason
teh
chief
investment
officer
of
vertium
asset
management
said
the
buyback
would
be
taken
favorably
by
the
market
adding
that
there
could
be
more
to
come
because
their
balance
sheet
is
in
such
a
pristine
state
every
time
they
do
an
asset
sale
they
are
normally
just
returning
proceeds
back
to
shareholders
he
said
jacques
said
the
focus
would
remain
on
managing
the
company
s
portfolio
to
get
rid
of
assets
that
did
not
provide
the
best
returns
over
time
rio
tinto
has
agreed
to
sell
copper
assets
in
indonesia
to
inc
as
part
of
a
series
of
complex
deals
it
is
unclear
when
that
sale
will
be
completed
norsk
hydro
and
rio
announced
last
week
they
had
dropped
a
plan
for
hydro
to
buy
rio
tinto
assets
including
an
aluminum
plant
in
iceland
after
approval
from
european
regulators
took
longer
than
expected
rio
s
sale
of
its
dunkirk
aluminum
smelter
in
northern
france
announced
in
january
has
also
yet
to
be
finalised
bmo
capital
markets
said
in
a
note
rio
s
buybacks
amounted
to
a
shareholder
return
well
ahead
of
its
peers
and
the
company
was
its
top
pick
among
the
diversified
majors
but
would
eventually
have
to
find
other
options
to
drive
value
including
possible
acquisitions
big
miners
have
been
struggling
to
find
good
assets
to
buy
and
even
glencore
renowned
for
adventurous
merger
and
acquisition
activity
has
said
it
will
focus
on
buybacks
