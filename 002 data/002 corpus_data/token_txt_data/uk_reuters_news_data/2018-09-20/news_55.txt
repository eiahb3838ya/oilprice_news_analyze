opec unlikely to agree official output increase in algeria, but pressure mounts
dubai
reuters
opec
and
its
allies
are
unlikely
to
agree
an
official
increase
in
crude
output
when
they
meet
in
algeria
this
weekend
although
pressure
is
mounting
on
top
producers
to
prevent
a
spike
in
oil
prices
ahead
of
new
sanctions
on
iran
opec
sources
said
opec
kingpin
saudi
arabia
is
worried
that
any
spike
in
oil
prices
will
trigger
fresh
criticism
from
president
donald
trump
but
is
concerned
about
a
lack
of
spare
oil
capacity
to
offset
shortages
the
sources
said
the
kingdom
is
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
seeking
to
prevent
prices
from
rising
far
above
a
barrel
ahead
of
congressional
elections
while
fending
off
doubts
over
its
ability
to
compensate
for
a
drop
in
iranian
supply
it
s
complicated
saudi
arabia
has
to
balance
oil
supply
and
demand
and
it
has
to
balance
oil
prices
so
they
don
t
rise
too
much
before
the
elections
one
opec
source
said
it
s
also
political
because
the
saudis
don
t
want
to
pump
too
much
oil
then
the
iranians
complain
to
opec
that
it
saudi
arabia
is
taking
iran
s
market
share
they
also
don
t
want
oil
prices
to
fall
too
trump
took
aim
at
opec
on
thursday
writing
on
twitter
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
under
pressure
from
the
president
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
russia
and
other
allies
agreed
in
june
to
boost
production
by
million
barrels
per
day
having
participated
in
a
deal
since
the
coalition
meets
on
sunday
in
algeria
to
discuss
how
to
allocate
that
million
bpd
increase
within
its
quota
framework
opec
sources
say
there
is
no
immediate
plan
for
any
official
action
as
such
a
move
would
require
opec
to
hold
what
it
calls
an
extraordinary
meeting
which
is
not
on
the
table
the
weekend
gathering
will
discuss
how
to
share
the
previously
agreed
output
increase
and
examine
whether
the
market
needs
more
oil
to
offset
the
loss
of
iranian
supply
as
well
as
a
decline
in
venezuelan
output
the
sources
said
two
sources
said
the
meeting
could
produce
a
recommendation
on
dividing
the
increase
as
most
participating
countries
would
be
represented
there
are
no
proposals
for
an
extraordinary
meeting
in
algeria
another
opec
source
said
the
source
added
that
the
joint
opec
and
ministerial
committee
known
as
the
jmmc
which
meets
in
algiers
on
sunday
can
still
recommend
to
the
wider
coalition
a
further
increase
in
output
if
needed
a
separate
opec
source
said
to
make
a
decision
you
need
to
have
all
the
ministers
not
all
ministers
are
attending
but
most
delegations
will
be
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
come
into
force
in
november
with
supply
from
the
country
already
at
lows
falling
venezuelan
output
and
unplanned
outages
elsewhere
will
also
keep
the
balance
tight
fears
over
supply
shortages
have
boosted
crude
prices
in
recent
weeks
and
international
benchmark
brent
was
trading
above
a
barrel
on
thursday
washington
wants
to
cut
iranian
oil
exports
to
zero
by
november
and
is
pushing
saudi
arabia
other
opec
members
and
russia
to
pump
more
to
meet
the
shortfall
opec
and
industry
sources
told
reuters
that
chinese
indian
and
other
asian
refiners
had
been
asking
middle
eastern
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
iraq
the
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
for
more
cargoes
while
some
producers
face
supply
restrictions
due
to
infrastructure
constraints
or
a
desire
not
to
be
seen
as
flooding
the
market
others
are
quietly
boosting
exports
to
asia
the
sources
said
though
opec
production
has
increased
since
july
saudi
arabia
has
added
less
crude
than
it
initially
indicated
saudi
officials
believe
there
is
insufficient
oil
demand
so
far
to
justify
raising
saudi
output
much
beyond
the
roughly
bpd
that
it
has
pumped
above
its
million
bpd
target
opec
and
industry
sources
told
reuters
but
that
has
raised
some
doubt
over
whether
riyadh
can
quickly
boost
output
to
what
the
kingdom
says
is
its
maximum
sustainable
capacity
of
million
bpd
the
sources
said
though
saudi
arabia
has
never
tested
such
high
levels
it
has
said
it
pumped
million
bpd
in
the
past
industry
sources
familiar
with
saudi
oil
plans
say
state
energy
giant
aramco
can
raise
output
quickly
to
million
bpd
but
reaching
million
bpd
could
take
up
to
six
months
spare
capacity
refers
to
a
producer
s
ability
to
ramp
up
production
in
a
relatively
short
time
much
of
it
is
located
in
the
middle
east
opec
mohammad
barkindo
meanwhile
warned
this
week
of
underinvestment
in
the
global
oil
industry
we
have
seen
a
contraction
in
the
level
of
investments
in
the
last
couple
of
years
in
response
to
the
impact
of
the
downturn
barkindo
told
reuters
tv
in
an
interview
referring
to
a
drop
in
oil
prices
that
started
in
it
is
our
hope
that
with
the
gradual
return
of
confidence
in
the
market
we
will
be
able
to
see
a
higher
level
of
investment
in
the
industry
that
will
ensure
that
at
any
given
time
a
certain
level
of
spare
capacity
will
serve
us
as
a
buffer
