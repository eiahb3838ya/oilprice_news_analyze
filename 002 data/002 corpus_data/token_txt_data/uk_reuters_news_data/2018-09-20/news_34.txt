world
stock
markets
rallied
on
thursday
while
the
dollar
slipped
amid
expectations
that
fresh
and
chinese
tariffs
on
reciprocal
imports
will
be
less
harsh
than
feared
still
investors
remained
cautious
about
the
next
steps
in
the
trade
war
driving
treasury
yields
lower
but
the
equity
market
s
early
take
of
the
latest
trade
moves
was
that
it
was
mostly
benign
for
the
economy
larry
fink
chief
executive
of
blackrock
the
world
s
largest
asset
manager
said
the
united
states
was
a
big
winner
in
the
trade
spat
with
china
in
the
the
greenback
fell
amid
a
drop
in
demand
for
the
currency
and
a
resurgence
in
global
risk
appetite
on
relief
that
the
new
round
of
and
chinese
import
tariffs
was
less
harsh
than
feared
the
dow
industrials
index
became
the
last
of
key
stock
indexes
to
regain
record
territory
while
the
benchmark
s
p
opened
at
a
fresh
record
high
our
general
view
on
the
trade
issue
is
that
so
far
it
has
not
been
economically
significant

global
investors
in
new
york
some
market
participants
are
hoping
that
china
comes
to
the
table
and
negotiates
a
deal
so
perhaps
there
s
a
little
bit
more
of
that
mahajan
said
referring
to
the
bullish
sentiment
lifting
equities
the
msci
index
tracking
shares
in
countries
rose
percent
to
a
high
supported
by
gains
in
europe
and
asia
the
ftseurofirst
index
of
leading
regional
shares
closed
up
percent
as
investors
focused
on
bullish
macroeconomic
and
corporate
news
consumer
confidence
and
small
business
optimism
remain
near
highs
while
there
s
still
more
of
a
positive
impact
from
earnings
and
tax
reform
along
with
two
more
quarters
of
corporate
repatriation
of
money
held
abroad
mahajan
said
on
wall
street
the
dow

industrial
average
rose
points
or
percent

the
s
p
gained
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
added
points
or
percent
to
upbeat
economic
data
pushed
debt
yields
a
little
higher
but
that
was
as
investors
remained
focused
on
the
trade
conflict
some
analysts
were
concerned
china
would
resort
to
other
measures
to
fight
back
against
the
united
states
we
have
been
moving
higher
in
yields
ever
since
the
last
jobs
report
showed
higher
wages
and
now
with
the
increased
tension
between
the
and
china
there
are
some
concerns
that
the
chinese
would
back
away
from
owning
treasuries
said
lou
brien
market
strategist
at
drw
trading
in
chicago
the
dollar
index
tracking
it
against
six
major
currencies
fell
percent
with
the
euro
up
percent
to
the
japanese
yen
weakened
percent
versus
the
greenback
at

the
dollar
had
benefited
from
growing
tensions
in
recent
months
as
investors
bet
it
would
gain
at
the
expense
of
riskier
currencies
some
market
participants
believe
the
dollar
s
current
weakness
might
be
fleeting
as
the
federal
reserve
next
week
is
widely
expected
to
