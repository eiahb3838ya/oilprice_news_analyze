new
liquefied
natural
gas
terminals
with
enough
capacity
to
double
exports
have
either
begun
commissioning
their
facilities
or
are
waiting
for
approval
from
the
energy
regulator
a
review
of
their
documents
showed
this
week
although
long
planned
the
actual
commissioning
of
plants
has
been
a
moving
target
in
the
past
yet
the
process
not
only
kicks
off
a
new
era
for
the
global
industry
as
the
united
states
turns
into
a
significant
exporter
it
also
opens
the
taps
for
large
volumes
to
hit
the
spot
market
before
commercial
contracts
are
formerly
triggered
the
ramp
up
of
lng
production
comes
just
as
president
donald
trump
boasts
of
his
country
s
energy
dominance
across
the
world
stage
but
may
also
hit
a
wall
of
chinese
tariffs
set
on
the
fuel
earlier
this
week
activity
at
five
terminals
dotted
mainly
on
the
gulf
coast
means
some
production
will
start
ahead
of
schedule
with
two
or
three
plants
producing
their
first
cargoes
this
year
one
as
early
as
november
analysts
now
estimate
anywhere
between
and
million
tonnes
of
lng
will
hit
the
spot
market
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
year
a
significant
amount
in
an
industry
still
dominated
by
rigid
supply
contracts
while
china
is
the
second
largest
lng
importer
in
the
world
its
purchases
of
cargoes
is
low
at
percent
of
the
total
it
buys
japan
and
south
korea
are
the
other
top
importers
based
on
regulatory
filings
and
analysts
forecasts
the
first
lng
is
expected
in
december
from
kinder
morgan

elba
island
and

in

from

surprised
the

last

with

now
seeing
first
lng
from
the
texas
terminal
as
early
as
november
we
see
somewhere
between
to
million
tonnes
of
additional
supplies
in
the
first
quarter
said
trevor
sikorski
analyst
at
energy
aspects
we
think
probably
most
of
the
million
will
be
put
into
the
spot
spot
market
volumes
are
not
recorded
but
industry
group
giignl
calculates
around
million

or
million
a

were
traded
on

basis
or
in

last
year
exports
at
million
tonnes
so
far
this
year
have
exceeded
last
year
s
of
million
tonnes
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
capacity
has
been
million

a

since

when
the

came

cheniere
sempra

and
freeport
told

their
timetable
for
remained
unchanged
from
their
latest
announcements
the
four
new
terminals
and
one
extension
will
come
onstream
in
stages
over
the
next
two
years
and
at
capacity
they
will
constitute
percent
of
new
supplies
expected
to
be
added
to
the
global
market
by
the
first
trains
and
one
extension
alone
have
a
capacity
of
mtpa
commissioning
energy
facilities
involves
a
back
and
forth
process
with
ferc
which
reviews
and
approves
many
stages
of
the
the
last
major
milestone
before
production
is
ferc
s
approval
to
inject
feedgas
that
gets
chilled
into
lng
cheniere
s
corpus
christi
train
and
sabine
pass
train
both
received
that
ferc
approval
in
recent
weeks
at
mtpa
each
the
trains
add
mtpa
to
capacity
freeport
lng
has
been
given
permission
to
commission
utilities
at
its
mtpa
train
it
pushed
back
the
start
date
of
commercial
activities
to
september
leading
traders
and
analysts
to
expect
lng
exports
to
start
in
may
sempra
has
filed
all
its
documents
for
cameron
train
with
capacity
of
mtpa
allowing
it
to
move
ahead
with
initial
commissioning
kinder
morgan
appears
to
be
the
furthest
behind
in
the
regulatory
approval
and
commissioning
process
the
filings
show
but
traders
say
its
modular
design
with
much
smaller
units
of
mtpa
each
means
an
initial
cargo
is
possible
this
