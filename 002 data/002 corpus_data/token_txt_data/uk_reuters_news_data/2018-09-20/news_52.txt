a

said
on

the
mining
charter
which
was
introduced
to
redress
the

said
more
details
about
the

would
be
announced
on
friday
by
president
cyril
ramaphosa
when
he
unveils
a
new
economic
stimulus
package
to
economic
growth
policy
uncertainty
has
stifled
investment
in
the
mining
industry
of
africa
s
most
industrialised
economy
which
has
also
faced
a
wave
of
job
cuts
during
a
downturn
in
commodity
markets
high
wage
costs
and
a
volatile
labour
environment
the
mining
charter
was
deliberated
upon
and
indeed
cabinet
has
approved
the
mining
charter
mokonyane
told
reporters
in
a
briefing
on
thursday
following
a
cabinet
meeting
on
wednesday
mokonyane
also
said
the
cabinet
backed
the
withdrawal
of
the
mineral
and
petroleum
resources
development
amendment
mprda
bill
which
would
have
given
the
state
a
percent
minority
stake
in
new
gas
and
oil
exploration
and
production
ventures
which
the
industry
had
said
would
discourage
investment
analysts
say
addressing
policy
certainty
in
the
mining
sector
could
lead
to
billions
of
dollars
of
new
investment
on
both
scores
it
will
be
beneficial
to
the
investment
climate
because
until
now
there
has
been
hesitation
to
invest
in
the
sector
because
of
the
regulatory
uncertainty
said
lloyd
christie
a
mining
lawyer
at
ens
africa
the
minerals
council
which
represents
south
african
mining
companies
says
policy
and
regulatory
certainty
could
potentially
add
billion
rand
billion
in
capital
expenditure
to
the
struggling
mining
sector
over
the
next
four
years
we
will
be
able
to
comment
when
we
see
the
final
document
a
spokeswoman
for
the
minerals
council
said
amendments
to
the
mprda
bill
were
passed
by
parliament
four
years
ago
but
the
draft
law
was
sent
back
to
lawmakers
by
former
president
jacob
zuma
in
due
to
concerns
over
whether
they
were
constitutional
the
bill
would
have
allowed
the
mines
minister
to
require
that
a
portion
of
extracted
resources
be
processed
domestically
and
not
be
exported
in
raw
form
sean
lunn
chairman
of
the
offshore
petroleum
association
of

opasa
told

the

would
support
a

governing
