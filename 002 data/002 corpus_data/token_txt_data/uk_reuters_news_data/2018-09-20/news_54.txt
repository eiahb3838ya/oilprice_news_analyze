adds
background
washington
sept
reuters
president
donald
trump
linked
american
support
for
middle
eastern
countries
to
oil
prices
on
thursday
as
he
again
urged
opec
to
lower
prices
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
trump
wrote
on
twitter
the
republican
president
has
lashed
out
at
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
over
the
past
several
months
rising
gasoline
prices
could
create
a
political
headache
for
trump
before
november
congressional
elections
by
offsetting
republican
claims
that
his
tax
cuts
and
rollbacks
of
federal
regulations
have
helped
boost
the
economy
trump
has
called
on
saudi
arabia
opec
s
largest
producer
to
raise
output
saying
that
it
should
help
the
united
states
lower
fuel
prices
since
washington
is
aiding
riyadh
in
its
struggle
against
iran
opec
and
its
allies
are
unlikely
to
agree
to
an
official
increase
in
crude
output
when
they
meet
in
algeria
this
weekend
although
pressure
is
mounting
on
top
producers
to
prevent
a
spike
in
oil
prices
ahead
of
new
sanctions
on
iran
opec
sources
told
reuters
on
thursday
the
new
sanctions
take
effect
in
november
as
a
result
of
with
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
a
agreement
on
iran
s
nuclear
program
saudi
arabia
is
worried
that
any
spike
in
oil
prices
will
trigger
fresh
criticism
from
trump
but
it
also
faces
doubts
over
its
ability
to
compensate
for
a
drop
in
iranian
supply
the
sources
said
in
a
visit
to
moscow
this
month
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
saudi
arabia
the
united
states
and
russia
can
between
them
raise
global
output
in
the
next
months
to
compensate
for
falling
oil
supplies
from
iran
