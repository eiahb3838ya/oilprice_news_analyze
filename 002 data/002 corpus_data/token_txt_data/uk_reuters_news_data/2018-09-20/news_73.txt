tokyo
reuters
japanese
oil
refiners
have
temporarily
halted
iranian
oil
loadings
ahead
of
sanctions
and
are
buying
alternatives
as
it
remains
unclear
whether
japan
will
receive
an
exemption
the
head
of
the
country
s
refinery
association
said
on
thursday
the
united
states
has
demanded
that
nations
cut
all
their
iranian
oil
imports
when
sanctions
on
the
country
s
petroleum
sector
over
tehran
s
nuclear
program
are
on
it
is
my
view
that
each
firm
is
taking
the
same
stance
and
temporarily
suspending
the
loading
and
watching
the
situation
carefully
takashi
tsukioka
the
president
of
the
petroleum
association
of
japan
paj
said
when
asked
if
japanese
refiners
plan
to
halt
iranian
loadings
from
october
tsukioka
who
also
serves
as
chairman
of
refiner
idemitsu
kosan
however
did
not
comment
on
the
details
of
each
refiner
s
reaction
many
refiners
in
japan
the
world
s
oil
consumer
say
they
are
resigned
to
completely
halting
imports
from
one
of
their
historically
important
suppliers
unlike
during
a
previous
round
of
sanctions
when
they
only
reduced
imports
from
iran
iran
is
an
important
supplier
of
oil
to
japan
accounting
for
about
percent
of
its
crude
imports
and
japanese
refiners
together
with
the
government
will
try
to
maintain
its
good
relationship
with
the
middle
eastern
country
said
tsukioka
adding
that
the
sanctions
will
not
cause
a
major
impact
tsukioka
said
in
july
that
japanese
oil
refiners
would
likely
stop
loading
iranian
crude
oil
from
with
final
shipments
to
arrive
in
the
first
half
of
october
