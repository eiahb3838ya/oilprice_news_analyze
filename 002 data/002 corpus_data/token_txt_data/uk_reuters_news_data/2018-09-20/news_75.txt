when
magdalena
was
clearing
out
her
home
in
amsterdam
she
took
her
old
clothes
and
other
household
waste
to
a
recycling
hub
knowing
it
would
be
worth
her
while
the
zero
waste
lab
in
the
east
of
the
dutch
city
gave
her
discount
tokens
for
local
shops
and
market
stalls
in
exchange
for
two
bags
of
fabric
paper
and
plastic
it
s
great
you
are
rewarded
for
saving
the
planet
said
magdalena
who
did
not
want
to
give
her
full
name
zero
waste
lab
is
one
of
several
new
initiatives
in
dutch
cities
aiming
to
highlight
the
scourge
of
urban
waste
by
turning
trash
into
something
useful
or
artistic
magdalena
s
jeans
were
sent
to
firma
koos
a
local
social
enterprise
that
hires
people
struggling
to
find
work
and
upcycles
denim
to
make
cushions
and
bags
her
electronic
cables
fabric
and
plastic
bottles
were
destined
for
children
s
arts
and
crafts
workshops
we
need
to
reward
people
and
we
need
the
rewards
to
come
back
into
the
local
community
lab
manager
bonnie
joosten
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
since
it
started
in
local
businesses
and
households
have
joined
the
project
tom
leeflang
who
owns
a
pancake
stall
nearby
said
the
scheme
works
well
because
it
is
not
compulsory
if
it
s
voluntary
people
are
much
more
likely
to
participate
he
said
the
netherlands
two
largest
cities
have
both
pledged
to
become
circular
economies
reusing
waste
as
new
materials
to
extract
maximum
value
amsterdam
by
and
rotterdam
by
the
first
step
is
to
improve
the
cities
recycling
rates
which
are
far
lower
than
in
the
rest
of
the
country
the
average
person
in
the
netherlands
produces
kg
lb
of
waste
each
year
according
to
zero
waste
lab
just
over
half
of
that
is
recycled
in
amsterdam
where
most
residents
live
in
apartments
with
no
outdoor
space
only
percent
of
waste
is
recycled
joosten
said
the
municipality
hopes
to
boost
that
percentage
to
percent
by
besides
helping
raise
recycling
rates
joosten
and
her
team
at
zero
waste
lab
hope
to
improve
social
cohesion
in
the
area
the
goal
is
for
the
lab
to
serve
as
a
community
living
room
where
people
can
get
to
know
their
neighbours
and
find
out
about
local
projects
we
don
t
only
create
value
for
waste
we
also
create
value
for
people
said
joosten
the
lab
sends
some
of
the
waste
it
collects
to
libraries
that
recently
started
running
workshops
for
children
called
maker
spaces
the
creative
sessions
aim
to
show
you
can
create
something
beautiful
from
rubbish
said
project
manager
rob
van
der
burg
the
children
are
taught
how
to
make
bags
and
clothing
from
old
textiles
and
to
build
robots
using
electronic
waste
we
want
to
give
them
the
tools
they
need
in
the
century
to
consciously
reuse
the
materials
they
have
and
to
invent
creative
solutions
for
environmental
issues
van
der
burg
added
in
rotterdam
a
floating
park
opened
this
summer
built
entirely
from
plastic
waste
found
in
the
nieuwe
maas
river
recycled
park
is
a
green
oasis
teeming
with
small
water
birds
fish
and
algae
it
is
made
up
of
more
than
a
dozen
hexagonal
pods
where
people
can
sit
and
watch
ships
on
their
way
to
the
port
frustrated
by
the
plastic
soup
floating
in
the
river
architect
ramon
knoester
started
organising
two
years
ago
since
then
volunteers
have
used
large
litter
traps
to
retrieve
around
kg
of
plastic
from
the
water
knoester
had
not
realised
the
scale
of
the
problem
until
he
saw
the
contents
of
the
traps
which
included
large
containers
construction
helmets
and
many
footballs
every
year
to
kg
of
plastic
waste
dumped
in
the
nieuwe
maas
floats
out
to
the
north
sea
knoester
said
the
architect
convinced
rotterdam
municipality
to
use
the
waste
to
make
a
floating
park
in
its
centre
as
his
vision
fitted
with
the
city
s
ambition
to
become
a
circular
economy
waste
is
worth
gold
we
say
in
rotterdam
said
a
spokeswoman
for
the
municipality
as
a
city
we
are
working
together
to
move
from
trash
towards
beauty
we
are
aiming
to
turn
the
city
centre
and
port
into
a
circular
with
euros
from
the
municipality
and
investors
knoester
launched
the
park
in
june
the
architect
said
the
public
reaction
had
been
positive
and
he
plans
to
expand
the
park
as
well
as
create
an
educational
programme
to
teach
younger
people
to
think
about
products
we
can
make
from
this
waste
material
knoester
hopes
his
work
with
the
park
will
inspire
others
to
incorporate
waste
products
into
buildings
and
public
facilities
if
we
treat
and
collect
our
waste
well
then
we
can
make
beautiful
projects
like
this
