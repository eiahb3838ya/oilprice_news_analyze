reuters
saudi
arabian
utility
developer
acwa
power
has
delayed
plans
for
an
initial
public
offering
ipo
originally
envisaged
for
this
year
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
on
thursday
it
is
the
latest
company
to
delay
a
public
listing
in
saudi
arabia
at
a
time
when
the
government
is
focused
on
attracting
more
investment
to
the
stock
market
under
its
push
to
move
the
economy
away
from
a
dependence
on
oil
revenues
a
spokesman
for
acwa
power
declined
to
comment
the
company
has
billion
of
assets
under
management
and
counts
saudi
sovereign
wealth
fund
public
investment
fund
as
a
shareholder
acwa
power
which
develops
power
and
desalinated
water
plants
had
been
planning
to
sell
a
percent
stake
in
an
ipo
in
riyadh
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
hired
jp
morgan
citigroup
natixis
and
riyad
capital
to
advise
on
that
process
sources
told
reuters
in
march
but
sources
now
say
the
transaction
will
not
happen
this
year
with
one
saying
the
ipo
will
be
delayed
for
at
least
a
year
problems
relating
to
an
acwa
power
project
in
turkey
were
one
reason
for
the
delay
one
of
the
sources
said
last
year
acwa
power
launched
the
billion
kirikkale
power
plant
with
a
capacity
of
megawatts
and
capable
of
meeting
three
percent
of
turkey
s
total
electricity
demand
but
players
in
the
turkish
power
market
have
had
their
margins
squeezed
due
to
slow
reform
in
the
sector
and
turkey
s
recent
economic
plight
several
other
saudi
companies
have
delayed
ipo
plans
in
the
past
year
most
notably
saudi
arabia
recently
called
off
plans
for
the
domestic
and
international
listing
of
state
oil
giant
saudi
aramco
earlier
this
year
the
saudi
stock
exchange
also
delayed
plans
for
its
public
share
sale
partly
due
to
anticipation
that
a
msci
upgrade
could
lift
its
valuation
sources
previously
told
reuters
while
proposals
for
the
ipo
of
arabian
centres
also
stalled
msci
in
june
said
it
would
add
saudi
arabian
stocks
to
its
emerging
markets
benchmark
but
an
inflow
of
foreign
funds
as
a
result
of
the
move
is
expected
to
take
several
months
