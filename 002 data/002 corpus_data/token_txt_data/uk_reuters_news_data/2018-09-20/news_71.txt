the
global
gas
industry
boosted
by
a
host
of
new
projects
to
feed
booming
demand
is
in
better
shape
than
at
any
point
in
the
last
five
years
but
analysts
warn
it
is
getting
ahead
of
itself
pointing
to
the
rise
of
renewable
energy
as
a
threat
commodity

trade
in
liquefied
natural

to
double
to
million

annually

in
the
coming

reflecting
forecasts
by

which

meet
that
demand
companies
are
working
on
final
investment
decisions
for
a
new
wave
of
mega
projects
the
industry
is
confident
said
christian
brown
president
for
the
oil
and
gas
sector
at
snc
lavalin
an
industrial
project
management
company
so
far
this
year
we
have
bid
almost
twice
as
much
as
last
year
for
available
gas
projects
he
said
snc
lavalin
made
about
percent
of
its
billion
revenues
from
the
oil
and
gas
sector
last
year
brown
said
the
industry
was
in
its
best
shape
since
when
a
slump
in
oil
and
gas
prices
led
to
aggressive
cost
cutting
and
scrapping
of
projects
he
said
most
growth
was
coming
from
unconventional
oil
and
gas
they
are
fast
and
furious
decisions
are
made
quickly
he
told
reuters
during
the
gastech
trade
show
in
barcelona
still
not
everybody
is
buying
into
the
industry
s
confidence
warning
the
fast
rise
of
cheap
renewable
power
generation
backed
up
by
improving
battery
technology
would
increasingly
take
market
share
away
from
the
gas
industry
the
oil
and
gas
industry
are
undergoing
major
disruption
from
electrification
and
renewables
said
bernadette
cullinane
of
deloitte
consulting
lng
producers
must
lower
costs
to
compete
with
solar
plus
storage
she
said
warning
that
projects
vying
for
investment
but
unable
to
reduce
costs
enough
to
compete
with
renewables
were
likely
fail
following
a
sharp
price
falls
in
panel
costs
and
improvement
in
efficiency
global
solar
power
capacity
has
soared
from
just
gigawatt
gw
a
decade
ago
to
around
gw
now
data
from
the
international
renewable
energy
agency
irena
showed
most
forecasts
expect
capacity
to
double
again
by
the
we
are
an
industry
in
flux
there
are
public
policies
in
place
around
the
world
and
technology
developments
that
fundamentally
challenge
the
gas
industry
outlook
said
deepa
poduval
senior
managing
director
for
oil
and
gas
at
engineering
procurement
and
construction
firm
black
veatch
the
gas
industry
is
growing
by
just
to
percent
annually
said
dumitru
dediu
who
leads
the
global
gas
and
lng
group
at
consultancy
mckinsey
company
judging
by
sales
of
large
gas
turbines
growth
may
slow
further
with
orders
down
from
the
equivalent
of
gw
sold
at
the
start
of
the
decade
to
less
than
gw
this
year
according
to
ge
one
of
the
major
turbine
makers
siemens
another
leading
turbine
maker
said
growth
of
renewables
was
the
main
reason
for
a
percent
fall
in
profits
from
its
power
and
gas
division
in
the
third
quarter
given
how
fast
this
disruption
is
occurring
we
believe
the
oil
and
gas
industry
must
act
now
