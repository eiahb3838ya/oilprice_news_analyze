new

reuters
oil
prices
eased
on
thursday
pulling
back
after
president
donald
trump
urged
opec
to
increase
production
at
its
meeting
in
algeria
and
slowing
bullish
momentum
that
had
previously
propelled
the
market
toward
highs
brent
crude
oil
settled
down
cents
at
a
barrel
light
crude
was
down
cents
to
settle
at
a
barrel
after
rising
nearly
percent
on
wednesday
global
benchmark
brent
has
been
trading
just
below
a
barrel
near
its
highest
level
in
almost
four
years
on
expectations
that
sanctions
against
iran
opec
s
third
biggest
producer
will
reduce
global
supply
we
re
stuck
in
a
range
here
said
tariq
zahir
managing
member
at
tyche
capital
advisors
in
new
york
with
prices
supported
by
the
sanctions
on
iranian
supplies
and
pressured
by
the
potential
that
chinese
demand
could
wane
trump
has
imposed
sanctions
in
response
to
iran
s
nuclear
program
that
are
to
go
into
full
effect
on
many
buyers
have
already
cut
iranian
purchases
ahead
of
the
new
regulations
it
is
unclear
whether
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
iraq
and
russia
can
compensate
for
lost
supply
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
producers
including
russia
meet
on
sunday
in
algeria
to
discuss
how
to
allocate
supply
increases
to
offset
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
the
meeting
is
unlikely
to
agree
to
an
official
rise
in
crude
output
although
pressure
is
mounting
to
prevent
a
spike
in
prices
trump
weighed
into
the
debate
via
twitter
saying
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
trump
tweeted
in
the
market
trump
s
tweets
may
drive
prices
down
slightly
said
tyche
s
zahir
predicting
that
such
tweets
from
the
president
would
probably
continue
with
the
midterm
elections
fast
approaching
the
last
thing
that
he
is
going
to
want
to
have
happen
is
diesel
prices
and
oil
prices
hitting
highs
when
people
are
going
to
the
voting
booth
zahir
said
the
elections
on
will
determine
if
republicans
maintain
control
of
both
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
still
many
traders
and
analysts
expect
brent
to
move
above
soon
brent
is
definitely
fighting
the
line
wanting
to
break
above
said
seb
markets
chief
commodities
analyst
bjarne
schieldrop
but
this
is
likely
going
to
break
very
bnp
paribas
oil
strategist
harry
tchilinguirian
told
the
reuters
global
oil
forum
brent
is
a
psychological
level
and
unsurprisingly
as
we
approach
it
it
gets
sold
into
as
some
market
participants
take
profit
as
more
evidence
gathers
that
iranian
oil
exports
are
heading
sharply
down
tchilinguririan
said
the
more
emboldened
the
oil
market
is
likely
to
be
to
test
and
breach
