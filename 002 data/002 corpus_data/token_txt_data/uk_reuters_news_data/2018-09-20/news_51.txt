graphic-now near 100 million bpd, when will oil demand peak?
london

sometime
in
the
next
few
weeks
global
oil
consumption
will
reach
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
more
than
twice
what
it
was
years
ago
and
it
shows
no
immediate
sign
of
falling
despite
overwhelming
evidence
of
climate
change
and
billions
in
subsidies
for
alternative
technologies
such
as
wind
and
solar
power
oil
is
so
entrenched
in
the
modern
world
that
demand
is
still
rising
by
up
to
percent
a
year
there
is
no
consensus
on
when
world
oil
demand
will
peak
but
it
is
clear
much
depends
on
how
governments
respond
to
global
warming
that
s
the
view
of
the
international
energy
agency
iea
which
advises
western
economies
on
energy
policy
as
bassam
fattouh
and
anupama
sen
of
the
oxford
institute
for
energy
studies
said
in
a
presentation
last
month
the
debate
over
peak
demand
signifies
a
shift
in
perception
from
scarcity
to
abundance
which
is
already
changing
the
behavior
of
all
players
in
the
world
oil
market
including
exporters
taking
the
peak
demand
argument
forward
it
is
generally
thought
that
the
world
is
on
the
brink
of
another
energy
transition
in
which
conventional
sources
such
as
oil
will
eventually
be
substituted

favor

opec
mohammad
barkindo
told
a
conference
in
south
africa
on
that
global
consumption
would
hit
million
bpd
this
year
sooner
than
anyone
had
projected
with
a
sophisticated
global
infrastructure
for
extraction

and
distribution
oil
produces
such
a
powerful
burst
of
energy
that
it
is
invaluable
for
some
forms
of
transport
such
as

of
the
almost
million
barrels
of
oil
consumed
daily
more
than
million
bpd
goes
for
transport
and
alternative
fuel
systems
such
as
electric
cars
still
have
little
market

much
of
the
remaining
oil
is
used
to
make
plastics
by
a
petrochemicals
industry
that
has
few
alternative
feedstocks
although
government
pressure
to
limit
the
use
of
hydrocarbons
such
as
oil
gas
and
coal
is
increasing
few

believe

will
decrease

demand
to
rise
for
at

the
next
years

for
million

would
rise
less

if
governments
moved
some
way
toward
reducing

the
iea
says
but
it
warns
governments
that
existing
plans
are
unlikely
to
make
a
huge
dent
in
carbon
emissions
and
only
a
thorough
change
in
energy
use
will
bring
down

demand
the
problem
for
the
countries
the
iea
advises
is
that
they
are
no
longer
primarily
responsible
for
rising
oil
consumption

oil
demand
in
the
big
developed
economies
has
stalled

increasing
