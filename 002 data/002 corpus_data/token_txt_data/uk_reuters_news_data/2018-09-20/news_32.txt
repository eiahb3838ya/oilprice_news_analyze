metals-copper pulls back as economic growth worries return

refiners
have
processed
a
record
volume
of
crude
in
the
last
three
months
reversing
the
previous
shortage
of
distillate
but
leaving
the
country
with
record
gasoline
stocks
at
the
end
of
the
summer
driving
season
fuel
availability
has
been
helped
by
the
absence
of
a
direct
hurricane
hit
on
the
major
refining
centres
located
on
the
coasts
of
texas
and
louisiana
in
stark
contrast
to
the
refinery
closures
caused
by
hurricane
harvey
in
refiners
have
carried
on
processing
at
elevated
rates
well
after
the
end
of
the
normal
summer
driving
season
and
into
september
in
order
to
rebuild
previously
depleted
distillate
stocks

but
the
supply
of
gasoline
and
to
a
lesser
extent
distillate
implies
refiners
will
have
to
cut
processing
more
sharply
than
usual
over
the
next
couple
of
months
to
avoid
creating
a
glut
of
refined
products
refiners
processed
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
oil
in
the
week
to
up
from
million
bpd
in
impacted
by
hurricane
harvey
and
million
bpd

refiners
produced
a
seasonal
record
million
bpd
of
distillate
last
week
up
from
million
bpd

and
million

according
to
the

distillate

just

the

as
recently
as

distillate
availability
has
been
improving
significantly
over
the
last
eight
weeks
after
deteriorating
more
or
less
continuously
since
the
start
of
the
year
but
the
consequence
of
heavy
refining
activity
to
produce
distillate
has
been
the
emergence
of
a
potential
of
gasoline
gasoline
stocks
remained
plentiful
throughout
the
peak
summer
driving
season
and
are
now
at
a
record
for
the
time
of
year
gasoline
inventories
stood
at
million
barrels
at
the
end
of
last
week
up
from
million
at
the
same
point
in

in
and
a
average
of
million
refiners
use
the
shoulder
season
between
the
end
of
summer
driving
demand
and
the
onset
of
winter
heating
to
undertake
scheduled
maintenance
and
change
refinery
configurations
crude
processing
typically
declines
by
almost
million
bpd
between
the
middle
of
august
and
early
october
before
starting
to
pick
up
again
from
the
start
of
november
but
this
year
the
decline
may
need
to
be
deeper
longer
than
average
otherwise
the
market
will
head
into
the

too
much
fuel
especially
gasoline
