sell
its

oil
major
repsol
and
book
a

of
million
euros
in
the
third

caixabank
s
stake
in
repsol
has
a
market
value
of
more
than
billion
euros
like
other
spanish
and
european
banks
caixabank
is
trying
to
comply
with
harsher
solvency
requirements
and
regulators
are
demanding
banks
focus
on
their
core
banking
business
the
lender
which
first
entered
repsol
more
than
years
ago
said
it
expected
the
sale
of
its
stake
to
have
a
neutral
impact
on
its
core
fully
loaded
capital
ratio
following
the
transaction
the
lender
s
chairman
jordi
gual
and
its
chief
executive
gonzalo
gortázar
will
step
down
as
board
members
of
repsol
caixabank
said
it
would
sell
down
its
shareholding
in
repsol
through
a
disposal
programme

stake
in
repsol
at
euros
per
share
and
euros
per
share
respectively
to
be
settled
no
later
than
end
of
september
the
loss
is
partly
related
to
the
transaction
with
the
equity
swaps
as
repsol
s
current
shares
closed
on
thursday
much
higher
at
euros
per
share
the
remaining
percent
stake
in
repsol
would
be
accounted
for
as
financial
assets
at
fair
value
and
its
sale
would
begin
immediately
and
terminate
no
later
than
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
caixabank
reiterated
it
would
reach
a
profitability
target
or
return
on
tangible
equity
