bangladesh
has
put
aside
two
smaller
liquefied

projects
with
trading

gunvor
and
vitol
to
focus
on
two
larger
lng
import
terminals
one
of
which
is
already
in
use
while
the
second
will
start
up
in
march
bangladesh
has
turned
to
lng
to
offset
falling
domestic
gas
output
to
feed
industrial
demand
and
electricity
generation
in
a
nation
of
million
people
where
a
third
have
no
power

it
aims
to
import
million
tonnes
a
year
of
lng
by
which
in
today
s
terms
would
make
it
a
top
five
importer
this
attracted
commodity
merchants
vitol
gunvor
and
trafigura
in
their
bid
to
muscle
in
on
the
global
lng
business
bangladesh
began
importing
lng
on
a
regular
basis
this
month

will
start
operations
in

and
double
the

a

bangladesh
had
also
touted
several
smaller
projects
drawing
interest
from
vitol
gunvor
and
trafigura
as
well
as
energy
giants
like
exxon
mobil
it
is
now
changing
tack
these
small
projects
are
not
a
priority
anymore

managing
director
of
the
rupantarita
prakritik
gas
co
the
unit
in
charge
of
lng
imports
at
oil
firm
petrobangla
these
are
costlier
than
the
bigger
ones
why
should
we
go
for
the
costlier
option
when
there
is
no
urgency
right
now
one
fsru
has
started
operations
and
another
is
expected
to
be
commissioned

vitol
said
on
thursday
it
had
no
comment
when
asked
about
lng
plans
in
bangladesh
gunvor
appeared
to
have
progressed
the
farthest
with
its
plan
to
import
lng
for
a
fertiliser
complex
belgian
shipping
firm
exmar
said
in
may
that
gunvor
had
chartered
its
small
fsru
for
years
when
asked
about
the
gunvor
project
quamruzzaman
said
its
chances
were
very
slim
although
he
said
all
the
lng
projects
could
be
revived
at
anytime

said

not
been

said
this

the
fsru
was
at
a
shipyard
being
modified
a
senior
petrobangla

said
the
terms
for
the

deal
was
for

priced
at

of
brent
crude
plus
a
fixed

million
british

mmbtu
and
an
additional

as
infrastructure
cost
when
brent

are
at
a

that
translates
to
per

at

it
is
