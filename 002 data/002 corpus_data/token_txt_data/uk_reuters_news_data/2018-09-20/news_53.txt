a
bounce
in
world
stocks
on
relief
that
fresh
and
chinese
tariffs
on
reciprocal
imports
were
less
harsh
than
feared
continued
on
thursday
although
investors
remained
wary
about
the
next
steps
in
the
trade
war
an
msci
index
tracking
shares
in
countries
rose
percent
to
a
high
supported
by
gains
in
europe
and
asia
but
chinese
equities
dipped
after
a
rally
due
to
bets
of
government
stimulus
to
limit
the
economic
damage
of
new
trade
barriers
the
stoxx
benchmark
rose
percent
while
japan
s
nikkei
ended
little
changed
barely
moving

prime

she
needed
to

on
the
irish
border
before
they
will
agree
the

she
wants
to
avoid
britain
crashing
out
of
the
bloc
after
a
negative
reaction
to
the
new
tariffs
announced
by
washington
and
beijing
on
tuesday
markets
have
been
speculating
that
an
immediate
escalation
could
be
averted
president
donald
trump
has
not
made
fresh
threats
to
extend
tariffs
to
all
chinese
imports
making
forecasts
on
trump
is
always
a
risk
but
it
s
a
fact
that
at
the
moment
the
escalation
has
taken
a
break
said
anthilia
capital
fund
manager
and
strategist
giuseppe
sersale
for
his
part
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
said
this
week
he
would
not
would
not
weaken
the
yuan
to
boost
exports
broader
market
sentiment
was
at
odds
with
a
new
reuters
poll
that
showed
unanimous
agreement
that
an
escalating
trade
war
with
china
was
bad
economic
policy
for
the
united
states
and
could
slow
economic
growth
rob
carnell
chief
economist
and
head
of
research
at
ing
said
he
saw
more
reasons
to
take
a
approach
given
the
recent
emerging
market
selloff
the
consensus
of
the
poll
for
growth
showed
a
slowdown
to
percent
in
the
final
quarter
of
less
than
half
the
last
reported
rate
of
percent
meanwhile
s
p
futures
rose
percent
following
strong
gains
on
wall
street
on
wednesday
the
rally
in
global
stocks
has
been
accompanied
a
drop
in
demand
for
assets
boosting
treasuries
yields
and
sending
the
dollar
to
lows
the
japanese
yen
has
also
been
under
pressure
the
yield
on
benchmark
treasury
notes
edged
up
to
on
thursday
but
remained
below
the
highest
level
since
may
it
reached

this
move
comes
ahead
of
what
is
expected
to
be
a
hawkish
meeting
of
the
federal
reserve
next
week
all
economists
in
the
reuters

forecast
the
fed

hike
rates
when
it
meets
it
is
expected
to
follow
that
up
with
one
more
before
the
end
of
this
year
taking
the
fed
funds
rate
to
percent
the
dollar
index
which
tracks
the

against
a

a
fresh
seven

low

the
euro
rose
percent
against
the
greenback
at
the
pound

making
fresh

helped
by
growing

can
be
clinched
