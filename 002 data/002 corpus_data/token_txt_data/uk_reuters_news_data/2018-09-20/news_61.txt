over
the

he
urged
the

rather
than

everybody
is
being

how
to
proceed
he
said
ido
hutabarat
chairman
of
the
indonesia
mining

said
retaining
and
converting
export
revenue
would
put
pressure
on
cashflows
of
exporters
especially
those
repaying
offshore
debt
and
buying
imported
equipment

mostly
paid
for
in

togar
sitanggang
deputy

said
the
moves
could
lead
some
producers
to
reduce
exports
and
sell
as
much
as
they
can
domestically
to
avoid
having
to

urged
exporters
to
exchange
dollar
earnings
some
analysts
point
to
tougher
rules
in
malaysia
and
thailand
though
also
question
whether
copying
them
could
breach
indonesia
s
free
foreign
exchange
regime
malaysia
has
since
required
exporters
to
convert
percent
of
their
earnings

ringgit
while
thai
exporters
must
keep
export

a
certain

chief

said
the
