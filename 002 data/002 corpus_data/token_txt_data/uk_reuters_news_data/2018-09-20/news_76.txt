asian
stocks
edged
higher

european
markets
looked
set
to
follow
as
investors
bet
that
robust
economic
growth
will
offset
the
drag
from
the
trade
war
for
a
while
longer
after
a
reaction
to
new
tariffs
announced
by
washington

rob
carnell
chief
economist
and
head
of
research
at
ing
said
he
saw
more
reasons
to
take
a
approach
given
the
recent
selloff
in
emerging
markets
it
s
not
my
natural
state
of
being
at
all
but
i
m
always
looking
for
the
bad
in
things
and
there
s
plenty
out
there
and
the
markets
don
t
really
seem
to
be
responding
all
that
much
carnell
said
shares
had
been
boosted
on
wednesday
by
expectations
that
the
impact
of
the
trade
war
would
be
smaller
than
feared
with
tax
and
other
fiscal
policy
measures
potentially
outweighing
any
negative
impact
on

p
futures
were
slightly
lower
at
the
broader
market
sentiment
was
at
odds
with
a
new
reuters
poll
that
showed
unanimous
agreement
that
an
escalating
trade
war
with
china
was
bad
economic
policy
for
the
united
states
and
could
cause
economic
growth
to
slow
the
consensus
of
the
poll
for
growth
showed
a
slowdown
to
percent
in
the
final

less
than
half
