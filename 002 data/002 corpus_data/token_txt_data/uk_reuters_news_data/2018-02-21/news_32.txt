producer
eqt
corp
said
on
wednesday
it
would
spin
off
its
midstream
business
to
create
a
standalone
publicly
traded
company
yielding
to
months
of
pressure
from
shareholders
hedge
funds
shaw
co
and
jana
partners
had
pushed
for
a
of
the
company
ever
since
it
bought
rice
energy
for
billion
last
year
saying
a
separation
of
its
production
and
pipeline
assets
will
get
better
returns
for
shareholders
the
separation
will
also
narrow
eqt
s
focus
on
its
exploration
and
production
business
or
the
upstream
assets
at
a
time
when
shale
production
is
expected
to
top
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
in
late
under
the
deal
designed
to
be
for
its
shareholders
eqt
will
drop
its
midstream
assets
into
its
master
limited
partnership
eqt
midstream
following
this
eqt
midstream
and
rice
midstream
partners
rice
s
master
limited
partnership
will
merge
to
create
a
standalone
midstream
focused
company
by
moving
ahead
with
the
of
the
midstream
business
we
believe
the
company
has
put
itself
on
the
best
path
forward
for
itself
and
all
shareholders

a
portfolio
manager
at

had
hinted
at
the
last
year
when
it
said
it
would
address
the
discount
in
its
share
price
following
the
rice
energy
deal
master
limited
partnerships
and
exploration
and
production
are
such
different
types
of
investments
that
without
separation
plans
like
this
the
discount
will
always
persist
even
if
investors
understand
the
underlying
assets

the

company
will
become
the
natural
gas
gathering
hub
in
the
united
states
operating
in
the
appalachian
basin
the
heart
of

boom
midstream
companies
transport
oil

natural

through
pipelines
and
store
them
at
gathering
stations
or
hubs
bridging
the
gap
between
producers
and
refiners
the
company
expects
the
separation
to
complete
by
end
of

this
year

analysts
were
expecting
the
separation
of
units
to
take
longer

he
expected
the
by
