the
combination
of
a
new

running
from

hub
to
memphis
along
with
reduced

about
three

decreased
after

a
strengthening

which
hit

in

germany
the
divergence
in

kept
crude
s
discount
to
brent
near
a
low
after
widening
to
more
than
in

a
narrower
premium
of
brent
to
wti
means
it
is
less
attractive
for
consumers
in

europe
to
import
crude
especially
with
refiners
conducting

at

brent
s
premium
has
been
narrowing
it
s
more
so
that
wti
has
been
rising
and
brent
s
kind
of

opec

said
the
excess
of
oil
held
in

has
fallen
in
the

to
stand
million

above

this
compares
with
a
surplus
of
around
million
barrels
in

he
said
the
latest
discussions
of
the
joint
technical
committee
of
opec

concluded
that
the
