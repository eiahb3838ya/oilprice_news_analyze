houston
reuters
shares
of
general
electric
co
s
baker
hughes
rose
on
wednesday
after
the
parent
company
said
it
would
not
shed
its
holdings
in
the
oilfield
services
business
before
the
expiration
of
a
lockup
period
reversing
an
earlier
stance
that
had
cast
uncertainty
around
the

general
electric
last
november
said
it
was
considering
shedding
its
baker
hughes
holdings
to
refocus
its
business
and
boost
cash
flows
the
announcement
came
just
months
after
the
conglomerate
had
purchased
a
percent
stake
in
the
firm
under
a
deal
that
combined
its
oil
and
gas
services
and
equipment
business
with
baker
hughes
to
create
the
second
largest
oilfield
services
firm
by
revenue
a
recent
move
in
oil
prices
to
above
a
barrel
and
the
relative
low
valuation
of
baker
hughes
stock
had
some
investors
questioning
whether
general
electric
would
spin
off
the
company
before
a
lockup
period
the
companies
set
as
part
of
the
merger
agreement
given
today
s
valuation
levels
we
see
a
lot
of
upside
there
we
like
the
macro
trends
at
this
point
in
time
we
have
no
intent
to
change
anything
or
execute
prior
to
the
expiration
of
any
of
the
lockup
periods

under
the

agreement
general
electric
can
not
spin
off
its
investment
without
special
approval
from
a
committee
of
board
members
despite
complementary
offerings
and
the
recent
spike
in
oil
prices
shares
of
ge
s
baker
hughes
have
fallen
by
more
than
percent
since
the
close
of
the
merger
disappointing
fourth
quarter
results
and
lowered
guidance
prompted
analysts
to
lower
profit
targets
for
the
year
the
uncertainty
had
been
pressuring
the
shares
