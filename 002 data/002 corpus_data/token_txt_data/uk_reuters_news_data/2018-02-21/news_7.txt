corp
is
set
to
hire
international
oil
service
giants
for
the
first
time
to
boost
output
from
domestic
oil
fields
in
response
to
a
government
push
to
increase
local
supplies
and
cut
expensive
imports
ongc
india
s
biggest
explorer
has
oil
service
companies
halliburton
schlumberger
and
ge
subsidiary
baker
hughes
to
submit
proposals
on
boosting
production
from
two
onshore
fields
according
to
a
document
seen
by
reuters
the
three
companies
have
until
may
to
submit
their
proposals
for
what
ongc
is
calling
a
production
enhancement
contract
for
an
oilfield
in
assam
state
and
another
in
gujarat
the
shortlist
is
ready
we
will
now
share
our
data
on
the
two
fields
with
these
companies
an
ongc
executive
said
the
executive
who
did
not
wish
to
be
named
as
ongc
has
yet
to
make
an
official
announcement
said
the
final
contract
is
likely
to
be
awarded
by
may
emails
to
halliburton
schlumberger
and
baker
hughes
requesting
comment
on
their
participation
were
unanswered
outside
of

hours
the
government
last
september
proposed
selling
a
percent
stake
in
ongc
s
producing
fields
to
foreign
companies
to
ramp
up
domestic
oil
and
gas
output
and
meet
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
target
of
cutting
oil
imports
percent
by
india
s
oil
production
has
stalled
below
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
recent
years
even
as
oil
demand
has
surged
that
has
resulted
in
its
crude
oil
imports
soaring
making
it
the
world
s
importer
behind
china
and
the
united
states
in
january
india
s
imports
hit
a
record
of
almost
million
bpd
ongc
which
the
government
hopes
to
eventually
build
into
a
global
giant
like
exxon
mobil
or
a
oil
major
like
petrochina
has
often
been
criticized
by
analysts
and
new
delhi
for
failing
to
increase
its
production
ongc
s
output
most
of
it
from
fields
that
have
been
operating
for
more
than
years
is
declining
at
the
rate
of
to
percent
a
year
a
major
part
of
the
company
s
capital
expenditure
is
spent
in
efforts
to
pump
more
oil
and
gas
to
set
off
the
yearly
decline
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
march
ongc
s
standalone
crude
oil
production
stood
at
million
metric
tonnes
bpd
a
one
percent
fall
from
the
previous
year
once
the
final
contractor
is
chosen
in
may
the
winning
service
company
will
be
responsible
for
maintaining
production
at
current
levels
and
also
for
boosting
output
incrementally
from
the
two
mature
fields
the
ongc
executive
said
we
will
reimburse
the
operational
expenses
incurred
and
share
some
amount
on
each
barrel
of
incremental
crude
that
the
contractor
will
produce
the
executive
said
halliburton
schlumberger
and
baker
hughes
will
get
access
to
ongc
s
data
rooms
pertaining
to
its
kalol
field
in
gujarat
and
the
geleki
field
in
assam
before
submitting
a
final
bid
according
to
the
bidding
document
ongc
might
replicate
the
model
for
other
fields
if
this
pilot
exercise
is
a
success
the
executive
said
ongc
explored
a
similar
move
in
and
had
signed
agreements
with
halliburton
and
schlumberger
aimed
at
enhancing
production
but
the
agreements
were
later
cancelled
