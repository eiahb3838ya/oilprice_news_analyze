the
dollar
hit
its
highest
level
in
a
week
on
wednesday
and
stocks
rose
as
investors
waited
to
see
if
minutes
from
the
federal
reserve
s
last
policy
meeting
would
herald
more
rises

the

so
far
this
week
after
slumping
percent
the
previous
week
to
its
lowest
level
in
three
years
investor
attention
was
focused
on
minutes
of
the
fed
s
policy
meeting
in
late
january
due
at
gmt
the
latest
readings
of
wages
and
inflation
came
in
higher
than
expected
with
some
blaming
the
data
for
a
violent
selloff
in
stocks
earlier
in
february
markets
are
particularly
sensitive
to
inflation
and
we
think
the
odds
that
the
minutes
reinforce
the
narrative
of
firming
inflation
are
high
said
elsa
lignos
rbc
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
we
think
there
is
a
high
probability
that
the
fed
moves
the
dots
to
four
hikes
in
from
three
and
that
the
minutes
could
be
another
step
in
that
the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
this
year
by
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
strategy
and
by
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
finally
appeared
to
be
benefiting
from
rising
bond
yields
especially
as
the
treasury
department
issues
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
a
higher
deficit
from
last
year
s
tax
overhaul
and
plans
to
increase
federal
spending
as
markets
braced
for
the
next
wave
of
this
week
s
billion
deluge
of
new
debt
and
treasury
yields

a
touch
