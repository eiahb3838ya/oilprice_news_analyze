hit
a
high
the
dollar
rose
and
stocks
fell
on
wednesday
in
a
rocky
session
after
the
federal
reserve
at
its
latest
policy
meeting
showed
more
confidence
in
the
need
to
keep
raising
interest
rates
the
fed
s
more
upbeat
take
on
inflation
as
seen
in
the
minutes
of
the
policy
meeting
released
on
wednesday
will
likely
further
cement
expectations
that
new
fed
chief
jerome
powell
will
lead
his
colleagues
in
raising
rates
next
month
members
agreed
that
the
strengthening
in
the
economic
outlook
increased
the
likelihood
that
a
gradual
upward
trajectory
of
the
federal
funds
rate
would
be
appropriate

the

minutes
lined
up
with
market
expectations
for
future
rate
hikes
said
michael
skordeles
macro
strategist
at
suntrust
advisory
services
in
atlanta
the
market
view
is
that
we
ll
see
one
in
march
one
in
july
and
likely
something
later
in
the
year
november
or
december
he
said
the
minutes
reassured
that
there
won
t
really
be
a
whole
lot
of
change
despite
having
a
regime
the
minutes
also
showed
that
both
the
voting
members
of
the
fed
s
committee
and
the
wider
group
of
policymakers
had
upgraded
their
forecasts
for
the
economy
since
december
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
six
other
major
currencies
dipped
following
the
release
of
the
minutes
but
then
recovered
the
index
was
last
up
percent
at
a
high
the
dollar
has
been
weighed
down
this
year
by
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
strategy
and
by
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
finally
appeared
to
be
benefiting
from
rising
bond
yields
especially
as
the
treasury
department
issues
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
increased
federal
spending
and
a
higher
deficit
from
last
year
s
tax
overhaul
the
euro
