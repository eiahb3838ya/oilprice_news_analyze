french
opposition
leader
laurent
wauquiez
came
under
fire
on
wednesday
for
taped
comments
in
which
he
sniped
at
politicians
in
his
own
camp
and
government
often
using
rough
language
prompting
a
senior
party
member
to
quit
the
wauquiez
president
of
the
conservative
les
republicains
also
mocked
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
saying
she
had
no
charisma
while
canadian
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
he
said
was
too
politically
correct
wauquiez
whose
party
is
the
biggest
opposition
group
in
parliament
said
in
december
when
he
was
elected
that
he
intended
to
make
life
difficult
for
centrist
president
emmanuel
macron
in
parliament
but
his
hardline
views
on
immigration
and
europe
have
already
prompted
several
senior
moderate
party
officials
including
former
prime
minister
alain
juppe
to
take
their
distance
from
party
policy
since
his
election
the
new
controversy
now
grabbing
headlines
across
france
involves
recordings
broadcast
by
french
tv
tmc
in
which
wauquiez
apparently
seeks
to
impress
business
school
students
with
cool
language
he
names
a
senior
politician
in
his
party
as
always
saying
stupid
things
adding
that
he
himself
often
speaks
bullshit
in
interviews
he
resorted
to
sometimes
crude
terms
in
criticising
macron
s
lawmakers
the
powerful
employers
groups
and
other
veterans
in
his
party
when
i
heard
wauquiez
s
comments
i
first
thought
he
had
tried
to
act
as
the
trash
and
cash
cool
big
brother
in
front
of
the
students
and
would
later
say
he
regretted
his
comments
dominique
bussereau
a
former
transport
minister
told
reuters
on
wednesday
after
wauquiez
told
an
evening
tv
show
on
tuesday
that
he
was
standing
by
his
comments
in
the
name
of
free
speech
bussereau
decided
to
quit
les
republicains
he
wauquiez
has
given
a
very
rightwing
style
to
the
party
flattering
the
grassroots
but
if
the
party
wants
to
win
elections
again
one
day
it
needs
to
be
able
to
attract
a
wide
range
of
people
and
not
focus
on
such
a
narrow
line
bussereau
said
an
eu
lawmaker
and
a
mayor
in
eastern
france
have
also
said
they
are
quitting
the
party
in
protest
at
wauquiez
s
comments
wauquiez
could
be
heard
in
one
of
the
recordings
telling
the
lyon
business
school
students
that
they
would
get
in
trouble
if
one
of
them
leaked
his
comments
