against

macri
s

was
seen
as
a
test
of
the
president
s
ability
to
keep
pushing

macri
has

big
changes
to
labour
laws
widely
seen
as
among
the
most
costly
to
companies
in

a
leading
obstacle
to
investment
after
his
coalition
performed
unexpectedly
well
in

s

the
president
nonetheless
lacks
a
majority
in
congress
and
his
administration
was
rocked
by
violent
protests
over
pension
reforms
in
december
since
then
he
has
scaled
back
unpopular
legislation
as
he
prepares
to
run
for
next
year
he
is
now
taking
a
piecemeal
approach
to
labour
law
changes
