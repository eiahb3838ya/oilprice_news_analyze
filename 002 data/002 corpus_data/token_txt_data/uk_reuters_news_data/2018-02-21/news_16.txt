the
dollar
index
hit
a
fresh
high
after
briefly
turning
negative
and
stocks
gave
back
gains
on
wednesday
after
the
federal
reserve
s
committee
at
its
last
policy
meeting
showed
more
confidence
in
the
need
to
keep
raising
interest
rates
its
more
upbeat
take
on
inflation
in
the
minutes
of
the
policy
meeting
will
likely
further
cement
expectations
that
new
fed
chief
jerome
powell
will
lead
his
colleagues
in
raising
interest
rates
next
month
wall

positive
rose
further
as
the

minutes
contained
no
big
surprises

then

most
of
its
gains
it
lined
up
with
market
expectations
for

the
market
view
is
that
we

see

one
in
july

likely
something
later

december

said
the
minutes
reassured
that
there
won
t
really
be
a
whole

of
change
despite

the
minutes
also
showed
that
voting
members
and
the
wider
group
of
policymakers
had
upgraded
their
forecasts
for
the
economic
outlook
since

the

last

on

the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
this
year
by
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
strategy
and
by
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
finally
appeared
to
be
benefiting
from
rising
bond
yields
especially
as
the
treasury
department
issues
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
increased
federal
spending

a
