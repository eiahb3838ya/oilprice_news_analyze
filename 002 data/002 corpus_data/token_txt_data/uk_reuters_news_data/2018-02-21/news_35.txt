philadelphia
feb
reuters
republican
senator
ted
cruz
of
texas
will
speak
at
a
rally
against
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
on
wednesday
hosted
by
bankrupt
refiner
philadelphia
energy
solutions
inc
a
company
that
blames
the
controversial
biofuels
policy
for
its
financial
demise
the
rally
comes
as
the
oil
industry
and
the
corn
lobby
clash
over
the
causes
of
the
refiner
s
insolvency
which
has
become
a
touchstone
in
the
debate
over
whether
the
rfs
needs
to
be
rewritten
or
replaced
the
regulation
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
or
buy
credits
from
those
who
do
while
it
has
created
a
lucrative
market
for
corn
states
like
iowa
and
nebraska
refiners
like
pes
that
have
no
blending
facilities
say
it
is
unfair
and
costly
philadelphia
energy
solutions
pes
which
employs
more
than
a
thousand
people
in
the
philadelphia
area
declared
bankruptcy
in
january
and
placed
the
blame
squarely
at
the
feet
of
the
rfs
the
corn
industry
has
pushed
back
pointing
out
that
other
refining
companies
are
raking
in
their
biggest
profits
in
years
and
suggesting
pes
s
problems
may
have
had
more
to
do
with
regional
refining
economics
and
management
choices
reuters
reported
that
pes
s
investor
backers
led
by
the
carlyle
group
withdrew
more
than
million
in
a
series
of
distributions
from
pes
since
most
of
them
backed
by
loans
the
company
ultimately
could
not
repay
the
distributions
combined
with
a
shift
in
energy
economics
made
complying
with
rfs
challenging
for
pes
cruz
who
represents
the
big
refining
state
of
texas
has
been
leading
an
effort
to
reform
the
rfs
putting
holds
on
presidential
nominations
favored
by
lawmakers
and
organizing
meetings
with
administration
officials
the
oil
and
gas
industry
is
among
cruz
s
top
financial
backers
according
to
the
center
for
responsive
politics
cruz
has
suggested
putting
a
cap
of
cents
on
credit
prices
a
fraction
of
their
current
value
a
move
that
would
save
refiners
millions
of
dollars
but
which
was
roundly
rejected
as
unworkable
by
the
biofuels
industry
pes
is
asking
a
bankruptcy
judge
to
shed
roughly
million
of
its
current
rfs
compliance
costs
as
part
of
its
restructuring
package
complying
with
the
rfs
was
more
expensive
than
the
company
s
payroll
and
ranked
only
behind
purchasing
crude
oil
as
its
biggest
cost
