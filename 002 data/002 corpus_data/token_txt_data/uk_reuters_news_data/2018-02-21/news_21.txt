venezuela
s
opposition
coalition
said
on
wednesday
it
could
not
participate
in
a
fraudulent
illegitimate
presidential
election
on
april
due
to
unfair
conditions
created
by
president
nicolas
maduro
s
government
the
announcement
by
the
democratic
unity
movement
which
confirmed
a
reuters
story
on
monday
leaves
maduro
on
track
for
but
is
likely
to
fuel
international
condemnation
of
democratic
shortcomings
in
the
opec
nation
maduro
s
two
strongest
opposition
rivals
are
both
barred
from
running
against
him
leopoldo
lopez
is
under
house
arrest
while
henrique
capriles
is
prohibited
from
holding
office
due
to
accusations
of
misconduct
when
he
was
a
state
governor
furthermore
the
national
election
board
already
banned
the
democratic
unity
coalition
plus
some
of
its
main
parties
from
running
under
their
party
names
the
premature
event
announced
for
next
april
lacking
proper
conditions
is
a
show
by
the
government
to
give
an
impression
of
legitimacy
that
it
does
not
have
in
the
midst
of
venezuelans
agony
and
suffering
the
coalition
said
in
a
statement
referring
to
the
country
s
economic
crisis
in
the
name
of
the
immense
majority
of
venezuelans
we
challenge
the
maduro
government
to
measure
itself
against
the
people
in
real
elections
later
in
it
added
the
democratic
unity
s
decision
leaves
maduro
facing
just
one
confirmed
candidate
so
far
a
evangelical
pastor
named
javier
bertucci
another
likely
candidate
is
opposition
leader
henri
falcon
a
former
state
governor
who
parted
with
the
socialists
in
he
has
expressed
his
desire
to
run
against
maduro
and
may
break
with
the
coalition
decision
to
boycott
the
vote
falcon
s
candidacy
will
likely
infuriate
maduro
s
adversaries
many
of
whom
see
him
as
a
trojan
horse
seeking
to
help
maduro
legitimize
a
rigged
vote
maduro
has
faced
calls
in
latin
america
and
internationally
to
improve
conditions
for
the
vote
with
the
united
states
pondering
oil
sanctions
to
pressure
him
he
says
the
country
is
victim
of
an
economic
war
led
by
the
opposition
with
the
help
of
the
united
states
we
ll
get
to
the
elections
whether
there

rain
thunder
or

or
without
