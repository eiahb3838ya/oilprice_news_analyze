are
one

the

it

we
can
link
carbon
markets
across

lachapelle
told
the

the
merging
of
ontario
s
cap

authorities
in
quebec
said
north

s
joint
systems
set
up
over
the
last
six
years
have
face
some
questions
over
how
much
carbon
emissions
they
actually
hold
back
lachapelle
said
for
now
the
european
union
is
considered
the
world
largest
carbon
emission

china
market
is
