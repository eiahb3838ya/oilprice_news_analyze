technical
commodity
analyst
said
brent
could
fall
into
a
range
of
per
barrel
as
suggested
by
its
wave
pattern
and
a
projection
analysis
traders
said
the
declines
were
driven
by
a
recovery
in
the
dollar
which
potentially
hits
fuel
demand
as
it
makes
oil
imports
more
expensive
for
countries
using
other
currencies
at
home
the
dollar
steadied
against
a
basket
of
currencies
on
wednesday
having
pulled
up
from
lows
set
last
week
as
traders
shaved
off
some
of
the
bearish
bets
against
the
currency
the
dollar
continues
to
find
firmer
footing
said
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
in
singapore
overall
however
oil
markets
remain
well
supported
due
to
healthy
and
supply
restraint
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
which
started
last
year
to
draw
down
excess
global
inventories
