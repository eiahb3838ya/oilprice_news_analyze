washington
reuters
the
white
house
on
wednesday
praised
an
experimental
program
in
oregon
that
charges
a
mileage
tax
to
volunteer
drivers
adding
to
signals
that
president
donald
trump
is
open
to
finding
new
revenue
sources
to
pay
for
his
proposed
infrastructure
program
many
of
trump
s
fellow
republicans
however
dislike
the
idea
of
a
transportation
tax
as
it
would
go
against
the
grain
of
the
party
s
push
to
lower
taxes
and
could
hit
rural
areas
harder
than
cities
in
the
annual
economic
report
of
the
president
the
white
house
described
oregon
a
state
where
environmental
issues
are
a
priority
for
many
voters
as
a
pioneer
in
transportation
funding
and
highlighted
its
funding
initiative
which
began
in
volunteers
are
charged
a
fee
of
cents
for
each
mile
driven
on
state
roads
in
return
drivers
get
rebates
for
state
fuel
taxes
as
of
the
end
of
only
about
people
were
participating
in
the
program
which
is
intended
to
gather
data
and
generate
consumer
feedback
the
program
offers
tangible
evidence
that
a
tax
on
vehicle
miles
traveled
is
a
promising
alternative
to
relying
on
fuel
taxes
the
report
said
kevin
hassett
chairman
of
the
white
house
council
of
economic
advisers
described
oregon
s
mileage
tax
as
innovative
in
a
conference
call
with
reporters
and
made
clear
the
trump
administration
was
open
to
looking
at
ways
to
raise
revenue
for
infrastructure
projects
trump
last
week
called
for
using
billion
in
new
federal
spending
over
years
in
an
effort
to
stimulate
trillion
in
infrastructure
spending
it
would
largely
see
states
shoulder
most
costs
and
rely
on
unspecified
spending
cuts
to
pay
for
repairs
the
federal
tax
of
cents
per
gallon
of
gasoline
has
not
been
hiked
since
the
federal
tax
on
diesel
fuel
is
cents
a
gallon
the
money
raised
from
those
taxes
is
used
to
pay
for
infrastructure
repairs
but
has
failed
to
keep
up
with
costs
as
cars
became
more
hassett
said
the
administration
was
still
looking
at
the
pluses
and
minuses
of
different
ways
to
pay
for
infrastructure
there
s
a
lot
of
discussion
that
will
continue
to
evolve
i
m
sure
as
the
infrastructure
legislation
moves
forward
about
how
should
we
pay
for
this
stuff
hassett
said
in
a
private
meeting
with
lawmakers
last
week
to
discuss
infrastructure
trump
expressed
support
for
hiking
the
federal
gasoline
tax
by
cents
a
gallon
according
to
democratic
senator
tom
carper
who
attended
the
meeting
the
report
also
boosted
the
idea
of
driverless
cars
estimating
autonomous
cars
could
add
more
than
billion
to
gdp
million
jobs
and
billion
in
wages
to
the
labor
force
once
they
account
for
half
of
vehicles
