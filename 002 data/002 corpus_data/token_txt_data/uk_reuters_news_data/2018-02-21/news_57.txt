the
dollar
rose
to
its
highest
level
in
a
week
against
a
basket
of
currencies
on
wednesday
as
investor
focus
shifted
to
the
minutes
of
the
federal
reserve
s
last
policy
meeting
world
stocks
looked
set
to
fall
for
a
third
straight
day
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
peers
was
up
percent
the
index
has
bounced
almost
percent
so
far
this
week
after
slumping
percent
the
previous
week
to
its
lowest
level
in
three
years
msci
s
world
index
of
stocks
was
down
percent
set
for
its
third
straight
decline
this
week
as
a
down
day
in
europe
offset
earlier
gains
in
asia
investor
attention
is
on
the
minutes
of
the
fed
s
last
policy
meeting
in
late
january
due
later
in
the
day
the
last
readings
of
wages
and
inflation
came
in
higher
than
expected
with
some
blaming
the
numbers
for
prompting
a
violent
selloff
in
stocks
earlier
this
month
markets
are
particularly
sensitive
to
inflation
and
we
think
the
odds
that
the
minutes
reinforce
the
narrative
of
firming
inflation
are
high
said
elsa
lignos
rbc
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
we
think
there
is
a
high
probability
that
the
fed
moves
the
dots
to
four
hikes
in
from
three
and
that
the
minutes
could
be
another
step
in
that
the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
by
a
variety
of
factors
this
year
including
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
and
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
treasury
yields
helped
to
strengthen
the
dollar
rising
as
the
bond
market
braced
for
this
week
s
billion
deluge
of
new
government
debt
the
treasury
yield
touched
percent
the
highest
since
september
increased
government
borrowing
has
put
upward
pressure
on
treasury
yields
the
treasury
department
has
issued
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
a
higher
deficit
from
last
year
s
major
tax
overhaul
and
a
budget
deal
that
will
increase
federal
spending
over
the
next
two
years
the
stronger
dollar
weighed
on
commodities
with
brent
crude

losing
percent
to

barrel
and
crude
oil
futures
also
slipping

hit
a
near
high
the
previous

on

of
