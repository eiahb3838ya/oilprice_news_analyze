equities
pulled

sharply
from

earlier
this

as
a

in

raised
worries
that

hike

treasury

rose
overnight
with

peak
as
investors
made
room
for
this
week
s
billion
deluge
of
new
government
debt
treasury
yields
have
risen
in
the
wake
of
increased
government
borrowing
the
treasury
department
has
issued
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
a
higher
deficit
from
last
year
s
major
tax
overhaul
and
a
budget
deal
that
will
increase
federal
spending
over

the

bounced
percent
so
far
this

after
slumping

the

has
been
weighed
down
by
a
variety
of
factors
this
year
including
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
and
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
easy
money
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
managed
to
find
bids
once
the
dust
began
to
settle
after
last
week
s
tumble
we
are
seeing
the
dollar
being
bought
back
after
last
week
s
slide
the
steady
economy
and
the
possibility
of
the
fed
accelerating
its

increases
will
likely
keep
fuelling
the

rebound
particularly
against
the
euro
and
