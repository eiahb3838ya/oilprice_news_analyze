european
cities
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
may
face
significantly
worse
heatwaves
deepening
drought
and
more
river
floods
if
global
temperatures
continue
to
rise
something
they
need
to
begin
preparing
for
now
researchers
said
on
wednesday
global
temperatures
are
already
degree
celsius
above
levels
and
are
projected
to
rise
to
degrees
or
more
this
century
unless
emissions
are
rapidly
curbed
according
to
the
united
nations
if
that
rise
happens
central
european
cities
will
see
the
greatest
increase
in
temperature
during
heatwaves
of
between
degrees
and
degrees
celsius
depending
on
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
researchers
from
britain
s
newcastle
university
said
the
researchers
who
studied
the
impact
of
global
temperature
hikes
of
between
degrees
and
degrees
celsius
said
southern
european
cities
will
see
the
biggest
increases
in
the
number
of
heatwave
days
however
droughts
also
will
become
longer
and
drier
and
in
the
scenario
will
reach
northern
europe
they
said
we
are
already
starting
to
see
an
increase
in
heatwaves
and
drought
and
flooding
so
cities
need
to
start
thinking
about
adapting
now
or
even
yesterday
said
selma
guerreiro
lead
author
of
a
study
published
in
the
journal
environmental
research
letters
much
of
southern
europe
experienced
lengthy
droughts
last
year
which
caused
widespread
fires
and
decimated
crops
rome
turned
off
its
public
fountains
and
only
narrowly
avoided
rationing
water
supplies
to
homes
britain
and
germany
have
experienced
severe
flooding
in
recent
years
and
paris
was
forced
to
evacuate
people
when
the
seine
flooded
last
month
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
extreme
weather
hitting
us
said
richard
dawson
the
drought
now
threatening
water
supplies
in
cape
town
is
a
stark
example
of
how
cities
need
to
adapt
long
before
a
drought
or
flood
hits
once
a
drought
kicks
in
and
the
water
starts
to
run
dry
it
may
be
too
late
to
build
another
reservoir
or
desalination
plant
dawson
said
heatwaves
and
floods
pose
similar
problems
so
you
have
to
really
start
thinking
longterm
in
terms
of
preparing
and
adapting
cities
for
any
sort
of
climate
event
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
cities
can
build
large
infrastructure
such
as
reservoirs
or
flood
barriers
or
can
make
smaller
incremental
changes
repeatedly
he
said
buildings
also
could
be
designed
to
be
naturally
cooler
use
less
water
or
be
more
resilient
to
flooding
people
too
can
change
their
behaviour
to
use
less
water
he
said
a
combination
of
all
of
those
things
is
probably
the
best
way
to
adapt
dawson
said
if
a
city
can
reduce
its
need
for
water
or
its
exposure
to
climate
risks
by
cutting
the
number
of
people
living
in
flood
plains
for
example
then
its
overall
vulnerability
goes
down
he
said
and
if
we
make
buildings
more
resilient
to
floods
and
heat
and
more
effective
at
using
water
resources
then
we
can
create
more
headroom
for
adaptation
to
more
extreme
events
