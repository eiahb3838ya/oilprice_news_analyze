brasilia
reuters
brazil
environmental
agency
ibama
will
decide
on
french
oil
firm
total
s
application
to
drill
in
the
environmentally
sensitive
amazon
river
basin
before
the
end
of
may
and
possibly
as
soon
as
the
end
of
march
an
agency
official
told
reuters
on
wednesday
ibama
last
august
ordered
total
to
provide
information
missing
from
its
application
for
an
environmental
license
to
explore
for
oil
in
the
foz
do
amazonas
basin
warning
that
it
was
the
oil
company
s
last
chance
to
provide
necessary
details
before
the
application
is
scrapped
the
agency
received
total
s
response
at
the
end
of
january
and
has
four
months
to
evaluate
the
new
report
and
issue
a
ruling
said
antonio
celso
junqueira
borges
the
general
coordinator
for
oil
and
gas
licensing
but
ibama
could
rule
more
quickly
borges
said
total
filed
its
supplement
to
its
studies
at
the
end
of
january
it
s
in
analysis
he
said
the
timeline
for
finishing
the
analysis
is
the
end
of
march
but
could
be
delayed
a
bit
more
than
he
declined
to
comment
on
the
chances
of
the
application
to
explore
being
approved
all
of
the
blocks
offered
in
the
round
are
in
environmentally
sensitive
areas
in
many
regions
the
modeling
indicates
that
if
there
was
an
oil
spill
it
would
reach
the
coast
borges
said
beyond
that
it
s
a
sensitive
region
there
are
lots
of
fisherman
and
a
great
biodiversity
so
it
demands
greater
control
and
care
he
said
officials
at
ibama
said
areas
in
recent
auctions
thought
to
contain
vast
amounts
of
oil
were
unlikely
to
face
the
same
problem
because
of
their
greater
distance
from
the
coast
the
analysis
of
total
s
application
in
foz
do
amazonas
once
complete
must
then
pass
through
a
series
of
approvals
with
the
ultimate
decision
to
be
issued
by
the
president
of
ibama
total
did
not
respond
to
request
for

a
group
