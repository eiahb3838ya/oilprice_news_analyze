santos
ltd
australia
s
no
independent
gas
producer
reported
a
rise
in
annual
underlying
profit
on
wednesday
and
flagged
it
may
soon
be
in
a
position
to
revive
its
dividend
and
embark
on
growth
two
years
of
deep
cost
cuts
and
a
rebound
in
oil
and
gas
prices
have
helped
santos
escape
from
a
massive
debt
overhang
and
put
it
in
a
better
position
to
fend
off
predators
like
private
harbour
energy
chief
executive
kevin
gallagher
said
the
company
has
had
no
further
contact
with
harbour
since
it
rebuffed
a
a
billion
offer
last
year
and
noted
that
its
share
price
was
now
above
the
tentative
a
a
share
offer
we
can
t
shrink
our
way
to
success
gallagher
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
pointing
to
opportunities
to
develop
its
existing
assets
in
australia
and
papua
new
guinea
santos
is
also
looking
to
beef
up
ties
with
its
top
shareholder
china
s
enn
group
and
is
in
talks
to
set
up
a
trading
joint
venture
to
sell
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
to
china
the
world
s
fastest
growing
gas
market
with
an
end
user
like
enn
we
see
that
as
a
marriage
made
in
heaven
gallagher
said
santos
is
hoping
to
use
its
relationship
with
enn
to
tap
other
end
users
in
china
which
last
year
overtook
south
korea
to
become
the
world
s
lng
importer
santos
underlying
profit
for
rose
to
million
from
million
a
year
earlier
thanks
to
cost
cuts
higher
sales
volumes
and
higher
oil
and
gas
prices
the
result
was
below
analysts
forecasts
around
million
that
analysts
according
to
thomson
reuters
ubs
put
the
miss
down
to
bigger
than
expected
foreign
exchange
losses
santos
shares
fell
percent
to
a
underperforming
a
small
gain
in
the
broader
market
tribeca
investment
partners
analyst
james
eginton
said
the
fall
was
due
partly
to
the
earnings
miss
and
possibly
because
gallagher
said
there
had
been
no
contact
with
harbour
for
predators
eyeing
santos
the
big
prize
would
be
its
stake
in
the
png
lng
project
run
by
exxonmobil
corp
in
papua
new
guinea
which
is
set
to
double
exports
under
a
plan
broadly
agreed
by
the
project
partners
gallagher
said
santos
is
looking
to
buy
into
one
of
the
gas
fields
p
nyang
that
is
set
to
supply
the
png
lng
expansion
to
match
its
percent
equity
stake
in
the
project
santos
could
also
revive
its
dividend
this
year
given
net
debt
is
on
track
to
fall
below
billion
by
a
year
ahead
of
target
but
the
company
would
stay
disciplined
i
don
t
think
we
want
to
be
jumping
ahead
of
ourselves
and
drinking
our
own
until
we
get
there
