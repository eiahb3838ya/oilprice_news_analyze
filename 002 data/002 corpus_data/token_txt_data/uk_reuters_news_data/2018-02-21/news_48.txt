the
dollar
rose
to
its
highest
level
in
a
week
on
wednesday
and
world
stocks
fell
for
the
third
day
as
investors
braced
for
minutes
from
the
fed
s
last
policy
meeting
to
see
if
they
would
herald
more
rises
in
interest
rates
and
global

yields
wall
street
looked
set
for
a
weaker

down
around

the
index
has
bounced
almost
percent
so
far
this
week
after
slumping
percent
the
previous
week
to
its
lowest
level
in
three
years
msci

was
down

for
its

investor
attention
is
on
the
minutes
of
the
fed
s
last
policy
meeting
in
late
january
due
at
gmt
the
last
readings
of
wages
and
inflation
came
in
higher
than
expected
with
some
blaming
the
numbers
for
a
violent
in
stocks
earlier
this
month
markets
are
particularly
sensitive
to
inflation
and
we
think
the
odds
that
the
minutes
reinforce
the
narrative
of
firming
inflation
are
high
said
elsa
lignos
rbc
s
global
head
of
fx
strategy
we
think
there
is
a
high
probability
that
the
fed
moves
the
dots
to
four
hikes
in
from
three
and
that
the
minutes
could
be
another
step
in
that
the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
this
year
by
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
strategy
and
by
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage
as
other
countries
start
to
scale
back
their
strategies
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
appeared
finally
to
be
benefiting
from
rising
bond
yields
especially
as
the
treasury
department
is
issuing
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
a
higher
deficit
from
last
year
s
tax
overhaul
and
plans
to
increase
federal
spending
as
markets
braced
for
the
next
wave
of
this
week
s
billion
deluge
of
new
debt
and
yields
eased
a
touch
with
the
former
retreating
from

german
bond
yields
the
benchmark
for
europe
fell
to
lows
after
business
activity
data
in
the
two
biggest
euro
zone
economies
the
data
dampened
expectations
of
a
speedy
end
to
the
european
central
bank
s
monetary
policies
it
might
well
be
the
case
that
people
in
the
market
were
getting
carried
away
about
strength
of
recovery
and
what
that
means
for
the
ecb
