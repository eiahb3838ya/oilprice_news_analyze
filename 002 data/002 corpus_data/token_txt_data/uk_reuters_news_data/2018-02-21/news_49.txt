president
michel
temer
s
decision
to
throw
in
the
towel
on
reforming
brazil
s
pension
system
leaves
the
unpopular
measure
as
a
campaign
issue
for
october
s
elections
and
a
major
headache
for
his
successor
monday
s
announcement
that
temer
was
abandoning
an
overhaul
of
the
social
security
system
billed
as
the
centerpiece
of
his
efforts
at
fiscal
reform
sparked
immediate
concern
from
credit
rating
agencies
that
latin
america
s
largest
economy
was
failing
to
put
its
financial
house
in
order
brazil
s
generous
pension
system
is
at
the
heart
of
budget
deficit
that
ballooned
from
percent
of
gdp
in
to
a
massive
percent
in
before
edging
back
to
percent
last
year
as
the
trillion
economy
emerged
from
recession
the
official
reason
for
dropping
the
pension
bill
was
a
military
intervention
in
rio
de
janeiro
state
decreed
on
friday
after
unprecedented
violence
during
carnival
constitutional
amendments
such
as
the
pension
bill
are
blocked
during
federal
intervention
of
a
state
deploying
the
army
in
rio
will
go
down
well
with
voters
in
a
nation
where
polls
show
public
safety
is
the
top
concern
brazil
has
murders
a
year
and
its
cities
are
among
the
world
s
most
dangerous
temer
s
critics
however
said
he
merely
found
a
pretext
to
avoid
acknowledging
an
embarrassing
defeat
while
temer
came
close
to
the
super
majority
needed
to
pass
the
bill
last
year
he
lost
political
capital
fighting
off
corruption
charges
and
the
government
soon
discovered
it
had
run
out
of
time
as
lawmakers
seeking
this
year
refused
to
back
the
unpopular
legislation
now
the
government
does
not
have
to
admit
it
lost
the
battle
for
pension
reform
said
fabio
sousa
a
congressman
for
the
centrist
brazilian
social
democratic
party
which
backed
the
reform
the
next
president
will
have
to
do
the
fiscal
adjustment
which
is
fine
because
he
will
have
a
mandate
from
voters
to
do
something
about
it
sousa
said
in
an
interview
the
good
thing
is
that
pension
reform
will
now
be
an
election
campaign
temer
a
former
vice
president
replaced
impeached
leftist
dilma
rousseff
in
but
he
has
approval
ratings
that
rule
out
a
presidential
bid
of
his
own
brazilian
markets
were
stable
on
tuesday
with
sao
paulo
s
bovespa
stock
index
gaining
percent
in
as
investors
had
largely
expected
an
already
pension
reform
to
sink
in
congress
in
an
effort
to
reassure
investors
temer
s
cabinet
on
monday
announced
plans
to
accelerate
other
policies
ranging
from
tax
breaks
to
privatizing
brazil
s
largest
utility
and
strengthening
the
central
bank
s
autonomy
yet
moody
s
investors
service
promptly
warned
on
tuesday
that
the
government
s
pension
decision
was
credit
negative
and
would
restrict
its
ability
to
comply
with
a
spending
ceiling
approved
last
year
the
government
is
expected
to
meet
its
deficit
target
but
it
is
doubtful
it
can
do
so
in
as
a
sluggish
recovery
from
brazil
s
worst
recession
on
record
has
left
tax
revenues
struggling
according
to
the
main
industry
lobby
the
cni
the
reform
would
have
saved
government
coffers
about
trillion
reais
billion
over
the
next
decade
brazil
s
gross
public
debt
already
stands
at
trillion
reais
trillion
or
percent
of
gdp
relatively
high
for
an
emerging
economy
without
steps
to
reduce
heavy
mandatory
spending
it
will
continue
climbing
said
felipe
salto
head
of
the
independent
fiscal
institute
a
bipartisan
senate
office
that
aims
at
transparency
in
government
accounts
government
projections
have
the
debt
stabilizing
in
at
percent
of
gdp
but
without
pension
reform
that
is
in
doubt
you
have
to
show
investors
it
will
stabilize
if
there
is
no
horizon
of
stabilization
the
market
will
see
a
risk
of
insolvency
and
higher
interest
rates
will
be
needed
to
finance
a
snowballing
debt
