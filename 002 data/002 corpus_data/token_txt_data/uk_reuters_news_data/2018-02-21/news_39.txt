explainer-why syria's messy war keeps escalating
beirut
reuters
despite
the
collapse
of
islamic
state
last
year
and
a
widespread
international
perception
that
syria
s
president
bashar
is
winning
the
war
there
have
been
major
new
escalations
around
the
country
seven
years
in
syria
s
conflict
has
killed
hundreds
of
thousands
driven
millions
from
their
homes
disturbed
the
regional
balance
of
power
and
dragged
in
foreign
nations
whose
rivalry
has
upset
existing
alliances
it
is
that
international
element
that
has
helped
transform
the
war
from
a
straight
fight
between
assad
and
rebel
forces
trying
to
overthrow
the
president
into
a
mess
of
overlapping
conflicts
in
the
process
syria
has
become
a
battleground
for
geopolitical
rivalries
pitching
the
united
states
against
russia
and
iran
against
israel
while
inflaming
the
rift
between
sunni
and
shi
ite
muslims
in
the
middle
east

assad
s
goal
is
clear
the
complete
recapture
of
all
parts
of
syria
and
the
restoration
of
his
government
s
rule
his
strongest
ally
russia
turned
the
war
in
his
favour
by
sending
its
air
force
to
help
him
in
but
it
may
be
readier
than
assad
to
agree
concessions
with
his
adversaries
it
has
brought
iran
and
turkey
into
talks
to
stabilise
the
crisis
by
agreeing
zones
meant
to
stop
the
fighting
assad
s
other
main
backer
is
iran
along
with
allied
militias
such
as
hezbollah
from
lebanon
tehran
says
it
is
fighting
ite
sunni
militancy
but
iran
s
critics
say
it
wants
to
cement
regional
power
with
a
land
bridge
extending
from
iran
through
iraq
and
syria
to
lebanon
the
most
fearsome
sunni
militant
group
is
islamic
state
its
caliphate
is
now
in
tatters
but
it
still
holds
pockets
of
desert
and
will
take
advantage
of
any
new
conflict
to
undermine
stability
and
retake
ground
syria
s
rebel
groups
all
want
to
oust
assad
but
they
are
divided
internally
over
whether
they
want
a
state
based
on
islam
or
syrian
nationalism
and
sometimes
fight
each
other
they
want
to
keep
the
uprising
alive
maintain
foreign
support
and
defend
their
remaining
territory
turkey
was
one
of
the
biggest
rebel
supporters
its
main
focus
now
however
is
driving
the
kurdish
ypg
away
from
its
border
as
it
sees
the
militia
as
an
extension
of
the
pkk
a
group
that
has
waged
a
insurgency
against
ankara
kurdish
forces
sandwiched
between
turkey
and
syria
s
army
want
to
cement
their
autonomy
in
the
north
where
they
have
set
up
ruling
councils
and
held
elections
they
want
to
stop
turkey
or
assad
attacking
their
territory
the
united
states
helped
rebels
earlier
in
the
war
but
became
more
focused
on
fighting
islamic
state
it
backs
the
sdf
syrian
democratic
forces
alliance
whose
strongest
element
is
the
kurdish
ypg
however
washington
wants
to
smooth
the
outrage
this
has
caused
its
nato
ally
turkey
washington
also
wants
to
contain
iran
as
it
sees
the
country
s
growing
influence
across
the
region
as
threat
to
its
closest
middle
east
allies
israel
and
saudi
arabia
israel
wants
to
stop
any
expansion
of
power
for
its
mortal
foes
iran
and
hezbollah
and
keep
them
far
from
its
borders

assad
and
his
allies
want
to
hasten
the
end
of
the
rebels
by
pushing
them
from
eastern
ghouta
and
are
using
the
siege
and
bombardment
tactics
that
helped
them
crush
opposition
in
aleppo
homs
and
other
former
insurgent
strongholds
many
rebels
have
been
pushed
into
northwestern
idlib
province
and
neighbouring
areas
their
biggest
remaining
stronghold
turkey
has
sent
some
troops
to
idlib
to
monitor
a
zone
there
after
talks
with
russia
and
iran
but
a
recent
advance
by
assad
and
his
allies
took
ground
in
idlib
turkey
and
allied
rebels
launched
an
assault
last
month
against
the
kurdish
ypg
in
afrin
a
region
that
is
separated
from
a
much
bigger
area
controlled
by
the
kurds
further
east
while
the
united
states
backed
the
ypg
in
its
fight
against
islamic
state
it
has
not
supported
it
against
turkey
in
afrin
calling
only
for
turkish
restraint
russia
had
stationed
troops
in
afrin
to
help
stop
any
turkish
assault
but
it
also
wants
ankara
s
cooperation
in
its
wider
peacemaking
efforts
in
syria
and
pulled
them
out
the
kurds
then
turned
to
assad
for
help
despite
their
rivalry
assad
has
not
sent
his
army
there
but
did
dispatch
allied
militias
linked
to
iran
to
help
the
kurds
against
turkey
turkey
may
turn
next
to
attack
the
ypg
near
manbij
km
miles
to
the
east
of
afrin
it
is
the
only
area
west
of
the
euphrates
other
than
afrin
but
unlike
afrin
there
are
forces
in
manbij
who
have
fired
on
rebels
and
say
they
will
defend
themselves
and
their
sdf
allies
the
united
states
is
also
present
in
eastern
syria
where
the
sdf
and
a
rival
campaign
by
assad
and
his
allies
have
each
taken
swathes
of
ground
from
islamic
state
despite
the
ypg
s
request
for
assad
s
help
in
afrin
there
is
no
sign
of
agreement
between
them
in
the
east
where
jets
backing
forces
have
struck
assad
s
allies
potentially
the
most
explosive
area
of
conflict
in
syria
is
the
southwest
where
rebels
still
hold
a
swathe
of
territory
near
the
golan
heights
the
united
states
russia
and
jordan
whose
border
is
nearby
agreed
a
zone
there
last
year
but
assad
and
allied
militia
with
ties
to
iran
and
hezbollah
waged
a
ground
campaign
there
last
year
and
remain
stationed
in
the
area
this
is
anathema
to
israel
which
sees
the
militias
as
iranian
pawns
israel
shot
down
an
iranian
drone
this
month
and
responded
with
air
raids
in
which
one
of
its
jets
was
downed
it
showed
the
risk
of
fighting
in
syria
leading
to
a
wider
confrontation
between
israel
and
iran
that
could
also
expand
to
hezbollah
in
lebanon
any
war
between
israel
and
iran
and
its
allies
would
also
risk
dragging
in
the
united
states
