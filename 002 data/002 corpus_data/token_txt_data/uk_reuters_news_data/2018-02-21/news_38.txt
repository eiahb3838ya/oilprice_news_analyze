grain
merchant
archer
daniels
midland
co
would
need
to
issue
equity
to
help
finance
a
proposed
takeover
of
rival
bunge
ltd
according
to
investors
and
bond
analysts
as
a
slump
in
agricultural
commodity
prices
makes
a
deal
too
risky
issuing
equity
would
dilute
the
ownership
of
existing
adm
shareholders
in
what
would
be
the
biggest
grains
industry
deal
on
record
but
it
would
put
the
company
on
a
stronger
financial
footing
helping
it
preserve
cheap
access
to
credit
to
fund
its
regular
operations
of
buying
processing
and
selling
corn
soybeans
and
wheat
given
the
importance
for
capital
market
access
there
would
have
to
be
some
sort
of
equity
component
in
this
transaction
said
bill
densmore
senior
director
of
corporate
ratings
at
fitch
ratings
adm
s
proposed
acquisition
of
bunge
came
to
light
last
month
although
neither
side
has
confirmed
that
they
are
in
talks
the
deal
has
an
estimated
price
tag
above
billion
and
comes
as
years
of
bumper
harvests
keep
crop
prices
low
and
make
it
difficult
for
grains
merchants
to
turn
a
profit
that
downturn
means
creditors
may
keep
adm
on
a
short
leash
if
it
did
the
deal
for
example
fitch
would
potentially
give
adm
a
shorter
window
than
its
usual
to
months
to
reduce
the
ratio
of
its
or
leverage
after
a
deal
something
critical
to
maintaining
its
a
credit
rating
densmore
said
we
would
have
less
confidence
in
those
earnings
going
forward
densmore
said
companies
can
be
downgraded
if
leverage
exceeds
a
certain
ratio
range
for
too
long
like
fitch
s
p
global
ratings
has
assigned
adm
an
a
rating
indicating
a
corporate
bond
that
is
an
attractive
investment
with
a
relatively
low
risk
of
default
adm
has
a
comparable
rating
from
moody
s
investors
service
which
uses
slightly
different
labels
in
its
scale
adm
relies
on
the
good
ratings
for
easy
and
cheap
access
to
credit
to
buy
crops
from
farmers
make
improvements
to
processing
plants
and
build
new
grain
facilities
merchants
typically
pay
off
borrowings
after
processing
the
crops
and
selling
them
to
users
like
livestock
producers
volumes
are
huge
but
margins
are
typically
thin
which
makes
access
to
cheap
capital
essential
last
year
adm
processed
more
than
million
metric
tons
of
corn
and
oilseeds
and
exported
millions
of
tons
more
adm
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
but
chief
financial
officer
ray
young
said
on
a
conference
call
that
maintaining
strong
ratings
is
paramount
to
adm
he
suggested
there
were
other
ways
of
funding
a
deal
than
debt
we
ve
got
so
many
avenues
in
order
to
help
raise
capital
he
said
they
have
to
do
an
equity
deal
said
sam
halpert
a
senior
analyst
for
vaneck
s
natural
resources
equity
strategy
which
owns
bunge
shares
and
previously
owned
stock
in
to
be
sure
concerns
about
how
adm
would
finance
a
deal
for
bunge
could
dissipate
if
grain
supplies
tighten
and
earnings
improve
adm
which
has
a
market
capitalization
of
about
billion
would
also
likely
need
to
sell
some
of
bunge
s
assets
to
win
approval
from
regulators
due
to
an
overlap
of
their
businesses
particularly
in
the
united
states
cash
from
those
sales
would
help
pay
down
some
of
the
debt
said
john
rogers
senior
vice
president
at
moody
s
those
sales
would
be
material
he
added
but
could
come
at
a
time
when
they
may
not
fetch
the
highest
prices
rogers
said
the
estimated
price
for
bunge
may
be
too
high
for
it
just
seems
to
be
an
awfully
large
price
to
pay
given
what
you
might
get
for
some
of
these
assets
rogers
said
but
never
say
never
in
this
bunge
is
rated
bbb
by
fitch
and
s
p
and
by
moody
s
three
notches
below
adm
s
ratings
last
year
fitch
and
moody
s
cut
their
outlooks
for
bunge
due
to
weak
earnings
and
after
the
company
issued
billion
of
debt
to
buy
a
controlling
stake
in
a
malaysian
palm
oil
company
bunge
has
declined
to
comment
on
adm
s
approach
which
followed
a
wave
of
among
top
seed
and
crop
chemical
companies
including
dow
chemical
and
dupont
bunge
has
a
market
cap
of
about
billion
