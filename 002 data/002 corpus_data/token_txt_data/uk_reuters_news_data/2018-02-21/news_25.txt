the

which
is
essential
to
venezuelan

if
it
could

fulfill
regulators
maintenance
demands
the
authorities
had
asked
pdvsa
to
commit
to
a
remediation
project
that
involved
firm
financial
commitments
in
the
meantime
several
oil
tanks
were
shut
because
they
were
not
in
compliance
with
regulations
according
to
a
company
source
the
agency
said
on
wednesday
that
pdvsa
has
demonstrated
it
has
the
financial
resources
to
urgently
address
the
key
overdue
maintenance
the
first
payment
was
made
several
weeks
ago
according
to
the
source
the
ilt
will
not
impose
administrative
coercion
to
the
bonaire
petroleum
corporation
nv
bopec
for
the
time
being
it
will
not
shut
down
the
use
of
the
piers
at
the
company
the
agency
said
in
a
statement
but
sharpened
supervision
will
follow
to
ensure
the
maintenance
work
is
accomplished
in
a
proper
and
safe
way
the
agency
added
a
series
of
inspections
are
planned
this
year
to
verify
bopec
is
taking
steps
to
comply
with
the
regulations
penalties
and
new
restrictions
could
be
imposed
if
the
operator
does
not
comply
the
ilt
said
bopec
fully
owned
by
pdvsa
has
held
an
environmental
permit
since
but
suffered
serious
delays
in
the
maintenance
of
storage
tanks
pipes
piers
and
electrical
installations
according
to
the
ilt
the
oil
terminal
is
critical
to
pdvsa
s
logistics
in
the
caribbean
and
its
closure
could
hurt
fuel
shipments
to
customers
in
asia
at
a
time
when
the
country
is
desperate
for
export
revenue
