in
the
village
of
shikharpur
in
nepal
s
remote
himalayan
foothills
the
faint
sound
of
water
can
be
heard
trickling
through
a
large
metal
pump
standing
in
golden
mustard
fields
a
huge
solar
panel
powers
the
pump
that
provides
some
litres
of
water
daily
to
families
still
recovering
from
nepal
s
devastating
earthquake
before
the
pump
we
used
to
walk
two
or
three
hours
a
day
to
collect
water
said
daley
sarki
a
vegetable
farmer
whose
mud
home
still
bears
the
cracked
scars
of
the
disaster
a
massive
earthquake
struck
impoverished
nepal
home
to
famed
mount
everest
in
april
killing
nearly
people
and
disrupting
the
lives
of
more
than
million
helping
families
recover
has
proved
harder
than
expected
for
reasons
ranging
from
aid
funding
delays
to
a
fuel
blockade
in
shikharpur
located
about
km
miles
from
the
capital
the
earthquake
left
most
households
without
access
to
drinking
water
said
ram
prasad
bolakhe
a
community
leader
there
were
many
problems
he
said
listing
destroyed
homes
contaminated
water
and
frequent
power
outages
to
improve
access
to
clean
water
a
project
led
by
british
charity
renewable
world
set
up
a
pump
that
collects
underground
water
and
transfers
it
up
metres
ft
to
the
himalayan
village
where
it
is
stored
in
tanks
the
system
serves
about
households
and
a
school
said
bolakhe
with
each
family
paying
for
their
own
use
based
on
water
meter
readings
the
technology
has
significantly
improved
people
s
health
bolakhe
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
adding
that
better
sanitation
and
access
to
drinking
water
have
limited
the
spread
of
diseases
residents
say
it
has
boosted
incomes
too
sarki
a
widow
said
the
time
she
has
saved
by
no
longer
having
to
walk
far
to
fetch
water
has
allowed
her
and
other
women
farmers
to
take
up
second
jobs
in
her
case
as
a
labourer
on
a
dairy
farm
the
additional
water
also
means
she
can
grow
more
produce
not
just
to
feed
herself
but
to
sell
at
the
market
my
income
has
doubled
she
said
noting
proudly
that
she
can
now
grow
crops
including
tomatoes
and
cauliflowers
for
two
seasons
a
year
the
project
also
trains
farmers
to
use
water
more
efficiently
grow
vegetables
such
as
sweet
peppers
under
plastic
sheets
that
serve
as
makeshift
greenhouses
and
promote
their
produce
to
local
markets
and
traders
one
unintended
consequence
said
bolakhe
has
been
bringing
the
community
closer
together
as
neighbours
have
to
interact
to
manage
the
water
system
it
allows
for
equal
distribution
of
water
among
all
castes
including
dalits
like
sarki
and
encourages
villagers
to
meet
and
collaborate
he
said
rabindra
karki
from
international
development
enterprises
ide
nepal
a
partner
of
the
project
that
helps
poor
farmers
said
the
initiative
had
united
villagers
over
a
shared
resource
they
re
aware
of
the
system
as
theirs
they
perceive
that
it
s
for
them
to
fulfil
their
needs
he
said
karki
whose
organisation
has
set
up
other
water
systems
in
nepal
as
part
of
the
building
resilience
and
adaptation
to
climate
extremes
and
disasters
braced
programme
funded
by
the
british
government
said
access
to
water
is
crucial
for
villagers
to
get
back
on
their
feet
after
the
quake
solar
irrigation
is
more
reliable
and
efficient
than
traditional
water
systems
as
it
is
less
vulnerable
to
erratic
rainfall
and
high
altitudes
he
said
the
technology
should
be
rolled
out
to
more
remote
parts
of
the
country
to
help
disadvantaged
communities
