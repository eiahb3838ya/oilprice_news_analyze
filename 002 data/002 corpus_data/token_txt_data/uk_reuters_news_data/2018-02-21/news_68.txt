equities
pulled
back
sharply
from
record
highs
earlier
this

as
a
steady
rise
in
treasury
yields
raised
worries
that
the

could
hike
interest
rates
more
frequently
this

than
initially

billion
deluge
of
new
government
debt
treasury
yields
have
risen
in
the
wake
of
increased
government
borrowing
the
treasury
department
has
issued
more
debt
in
anticipation
of
a
higher
deficit
from
last

s
major
tax
overhaul

the

the
currency
has
been
weighed
down
by
a
variety
of
factors
this
year
including
concerns
that
washington
might
pursue
a
weak
dollar
strategy
and
the
perceived
erosion
of
its
yield
advantage

easy
monetary
policy
confidence
in
the
dollar
has
also
been
shaken
by
mounting
worries
over
the
budget
deficit
but
the
greenback
managed
to
find
bids
once
the
dust
began
to
settle
after
last

s
tumble
we
are
seeing
the
dollar
being
bought
back
after
last

the
possibility
of
