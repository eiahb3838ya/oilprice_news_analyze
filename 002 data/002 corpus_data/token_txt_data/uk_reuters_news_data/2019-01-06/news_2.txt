reuters
an
offensive
by
mexico
s
new
government
against
fuel
theft
at
one
of
the
country
s
main
refineries
has
led
to
days
of
shortages
at
gas
stations
in
several
central
states
as
authorities
move
more
fuel
by
tankers
and
less
by
vulnerable
pipelines
a
reuters
witness
said
many
gas
stations
in
the
city
of
guadalajara
in
jalisco
state
were
closed
on
sunday
including
those
operated
by
state
oil
firm
pemex
spain
s
repsol
and
bp
there
were
long
lines
of
motorists
at
those
that
were
operating
i
ve
gone
to
gas
stations
and
nothing
there
s
none
at
any
of
them
said
alan
delgado
trying
to
fill
his
buick
truck
at
a
bp
gas
station
in
guadalajara
this
is
a
serious
and
critical
situation
because
it
complicates
work
and
the
shortages
followed
the
closure
of
a
pipeline
from
the
salamanca
refinery
in
the
central
state
of
guanajuato
and
as
pemex
started
using
more
tankers
to
transport
fuel
theft
by
gangs
and
oil
industry
workers
from
mexico
s
refineries
is
a
major
drain
on
government
resources
but
the
measures
taken
to
tackle
the
crime
could
also
weigh
on
the
economy
if
shortages
drag
on
violent
criminal
gangs
have
for
years
used
fuel
theft
as
a
way
to
supplement
their
income
bleeding
money
from
state
coffers
and
driving
bloodshed
as
they
fight
rivals
and
extort
oil
workers
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
took
office
in
december
confirmed
on
friday
that
less
fuel
was
being
sent
through
pipelines
i
ask
citizens
for
understanding
and
support
because
we
need
to
solve
this
problem
together
we
are
trying
to
get
it
resolved
soon
lopez
obrador
said
in
a
televised
speech
obrador
has
vowed
to
tackle
theft
outside
and
inside
pemex
or
petroleos
mexicanos
which
estimates
that
fuel
worth
more
than
billion
pesos
billion
has
been
stolen
since
alone
the
president
said
last
month
that
mexico
s
armed
forces
would
take
part
in
security
at
pemex
installations
around
the
country
including
its
refinery
in
salamanca
fuel
theft
there
has
been
linked
to
a
surge
in
violence
according
to
guanajuato
state
governor
diego
sinhue
the
mexican
association
of
gasoline
station
business
owners
warned
its
members
on
that
no
fuel
was
being
transported
via
the
pipeline
from
the
salamanca
refinery
you
are
free
to
take
measures
that
benefit
your
customers
to
limit
the
sale
of
fuel
to
liters
per
car
or
whatever
you
consider
necessary
to
serve
the
public
the
association
said
guanajuato
governor
sinhue
took
to
twitter
on
sunday
saying
that
pemex
s
chief
executive
octavio
romero
confirmed
that
after
reopening
the
pipeline
he
expects
to
reestablish
service
to
percent
of
the
gasoline
stations
during
the
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
opening
that
pipeline
would
reduce
shortages
in
other
regions
pemex
said
on
saturday
that
it
is
preferring
the
use
of
safer
means
of
transport
which
means
changes
in
the
logistics
for
delivery
to
service
stations
leading
to
delays
in
the
states
of
hidalgo
mexico
jalisco
michoacan
guanajuato
and
queretaro
pemex
said
it
is
aiming
to
boost
distribution
in
the
affected
states
by
up
to
percent
transporting
fuel
by
tanker
trucks
and
trains
a
may
study
commissioned
by
the
national
energy
regulator
found
that
thieves
between
and
had
tapped
pipelines
roughly
every
kms
miles
along
pemex
s
approximately
km
pipeline
network
the
government
has
not
made
clear
if
they
see
road
and
rail
transport
as
a
long
term
solution
for
fuel
distribution
transporting
fuel
by
road
and
rail
is
to
times
more
expensive
than
by
pipeline
said
gonzalo
monroy
a
mexico
oil
analyst
if
this
keeps
happening
and
expanding
to
other
parts
of
the
country
the
mexican
economy
is
going
to
have
a
very
tough
first
quarter
