fears
of
a
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
battered
asian
shares
again
on
monday
keeping
the
safe
haven
yen
near
a
peak
as
investors
fretted
over
the
fate
of
global
growth
but
futures
for
the
s
p
leapt
percent
an
unusual
move
during
early
asian
hours
after
the
wall
street
journal
reported
the
united
states
and
china
have
quietly
started
negotiating
to
improve
access
to
chinese
markets
the
news
was
little
consolation
for
asian
shares
which
were
left
nursing
their
wounds
japan
s
nikkei
was
down
percent
after
falling
to
a
near
trough
at

chinese
shares
declined
about

in
early
trade
msci
s

slipped
percent
for
its
fourth
consecutive
day
in
the
red
the
index
is
headed
for
its
first
quarterly
decline
since
late
as
the
risk
of
faster
rate
rises
and
the
spectre
of
a
trade
war
spooked
investors
who
had
enjoyed
a
bull
run
protectionism
remains
a
source
of
volatility
and
downside
for
equities
analysts
at
jpmorgan
said
in
a
note
asia
equity
outperformance
is
in
part
a
function
of
faster
growth
and
capital
inflows
both
clearly
at
risk

south
korea
s
benchmark

index
was
the
lone
bright
spot
up
percent
on
reports
the
united
states
and
south
korea
were
on
the
verge
of
a
trade
deal
including
an
exemption
from
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
for
south
korea
the
korean
won
was
also
firmer
after
hitting
a
near
trough
on
the
dollar
last
week
president
donald
trump
signed
a
memorandum
on
friday
that
could
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
imports
from
china
although
the
measures
have
a
consultation
period
before
they
take
effect
the
tariffs
are
on
top
of
additional
duties
on
steel
and
aluminium
on
a
number
of
countries
including
china
which
has
already
hit
back
with
its
own
plans
to
slap
duties
on
up
to
billion
of
imports

around
