vitol
said
was
a
challenging
year
notwithstanding
robust
demand
growth
of
million
barrels
a
day
across
the
year
the
pattern
of
demand
and
supply
surprised
the
market
causing
prices
to
dip
in
before
rallying

the
latter
part
of
the
independent
traders
thrive
on
volatility
and
the
relative
steadiness
of
global
oil
prices
last
year
eroded
already

increased
global
market
transparency
and
data
access
in
recent
years

exclusivity
in
certain
areas

conditions
required
a
constant
focus
on
careful
risk
and
margin
management
