egyptian
president
abdel
fattah
has
revived
economic
growth
and
tackled
pressing
problems
in
power
and
gas
supply
but
as
he
heads
for
a
second
term
he
must
juggle
austerity
under
an
imf
programme
with
the
need
to
tame
inflation
sisi
inherited
an
economy
in
tatters
when
he
took
over
the
presidency
in
requiring
aggressive
reforms
that
have
largely
stopped
the
rot
while
hurting
most
egyptians
through
a
currency
devaluation
and
withdrawal
of
some
price
subsidies
he
s
now
at
the
crossroads
that
every
egyptian
president
has
found
himself
in
said
reham
eldesoki
an
independent
economist
long
focused
on
egypt
he
needs
to
push
forward
on
intensive
reforms
to
move
forward
in
building
services
and
industry
and
to
make
egypt
really
sisi
s
performance
in
consolidating
the
gains
over
the
next
four
years
he
is
set
to
cruise
to
victory
in
a
presidential
election
which
began
on
monday
will
be
watched
well
beyond
egypt
s
borders
european
nations
particularly
worry
that
any
faltering
of
reforms
could
worsen
unemployment
and
encourage
young
egyptians
to
cross
the
mediterranean
illegally
aggravating
already
sizeable
flows
of
migrants
from
north
africa
sisi
who
led
the
military
s
overthrow
of
egypt
s
first
president
in
was
elected
president
the
following
year
after
a
prolonged
period
of
popular
protests
had
scared
away
many
investors
and
foreign
tourists
successive
governments
reluctance
to
devalue
the
overpriced
currency
had
led
to
an
acute
foreign
exchange
shortage
dampening
imports
and
pricing
egyptian
exports
out
of
foreign
markets
sisi
s
signature
economic
achievement
so
far
has
been
concluding
a
deal
with
the
international
monetary
fund
in
under
this
the
government
has
raised
the
price
of
subsidised
fuel
to
ease
the
huge
burden
on
the
budget
increased
tax
to
percent
and
devalued
the
egyptian
pound
against
the
dollar
by
more
than
half
many
say
the
reforms
were
needed
to
stablise
egypt
as
it
recovers
from
the
chaos
and
tackles
an
islamist
insurgency
however
the
currency
reform
hit
the
middle
classes
particularly
hard
while
inflation
remains
high
poverty
has
increased
and
unemployment
is
not
going
down
as
quickly
as
people
had
hoped
economists
see
some
grounds
for
hope
gdp
growth
increased
to
percent
in
the
three
months
to
december
from
a
low
of
percent
in
according
to
the
central
bank
i
think
we
should
see
growth
continuing
to
escalate
said
mohamed
abu
basha
an
economist
with
egyptian
investment
bank
efg
hermes
tourism
has
space
to
recover
and
consumption
and
investment
should
continue
to
recover
over
the
next
few
egypt
once
a
net
energy
exporter
had
struggled
to
get
enough
fuel
to
run
its
antiquated
power
stations
with
the
country
of
million
people
suffering
regular
blackouts
under
sisi
the
government
signed
construction
contracts
for
new
plants
and
arranged
for
floating
gas
terminals
to
allow
more
imports
the
power
shortages
were
soon
brought
to
a
near
halt
sisi
has
also
acted
to
break
a
logjam
in
gas
exploration
and
development
likewise
he
moved
to
reduce
vast
arrears
in
payments
to
international
energy
companies
for
oil
and
gas
this
has
encouraged
them
to
revive
their
activities
in
egypt
leading
to
several
gas
discoveries
including
the
zohr
field
the
largest
in
the
mediterranean
region
zohr
operated
by
italy
s
eni
shipped
its
first
gas
at
the
end
of
other
fields
that
were
brought
on
stream
included
bp
s
atoll
and
west
nile
delta
the
government
says
the
country
will
be
in
gas
by
the
end
of
this
year
sisi
launched
a
series
of
large
infrastructure
projects
designed
partly
to
put
egyptians
back
to
work
many
won
praise
such
as
new
roads
and
expanded
electricity
capacity
more
controversially
sisi
has
begun
work
on
several
megaprojects
some
of
which
economists
say
will
produce
little
immediate
return
these
include
dredging
a
new
branch
of
the
suez
canal
sisi
insisted
the
project
be
completed
within
a
year
adding
to
the
cost
but
because
of
a
worldwide
trade
slowdown
canal
revenue
was
little
changed
he
has
begun
building
several
new
desert
cities
including
a
billion
new
administrative
capital
east
of
cairo
egypt
has
also
been
negotiating
with
russia
for
a
new
billion
nuclear
power
plant
many
investors
and
economists
worry
that
the
army
is
becoming
too
involved
in
these
projects
and
in
other
ventures
threatening
to
crowd
out
private
investors
austerity
measures
imposed
under
the
imf
deal
pushed
annual
inflation
to
percent
in
august
by
last
month
the
rate
had
dropped
back
to
percent
but
more
planned
measures
will
make
it
difficult
to
bring
it
down
further
the
government
is
widely
expected
to
raise
fuel
prices
again
at
the
start
of
the
new
fiscal
year
on
july
the
challenge
now
will
be
to
get
inflation
down
to
single
digits
abu
basha
said
we
know
that
they
will
eliminate
most
of
the
fuel
subsidies
by
the
end
of
the
imf
programme
