update 1-iter nuclear fusion project avoids delays as us doubles budget
paris
reuters
the
united
states
has
agreed
to
double
its
planned
budget
contribution
to
the
iter
project
to
build
a
prototype
nuclear
fusion
reactor
avoiding
delays
to
the
international
project
this
year
its
director
said
on
monday
washington
cut
the
united
states
contribution
from
a
scheduled
million
to
million
and
had
planned
to
cut
its
contribution
from
a
scheduled
million
to
million
but
in
talks
about
the
budget
last
week
the
congress
approved
a
draft
omnibus
spending
bill
with
a
million
contribution
for
iter
which
president
donald
trump
signed
into
law
on
friday
iter
said
this
is
a
very
positive
signal
it
will
prevent
iter
having
to
announce
project
delays
in
iter
bernard
bigot
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
he
added
that
if
the
united
states
would
make
up
for
missing
cash
contributions
of
about
million
for
the
period
iter
would
remain
on
track
in
future
years
the
international
thermonuclear
experimental
reactor
iter
project
is
a
cooperation
between
europe
the
united
states
china
india
japan
russia
and
south
korea
to
build
a
prototype
fusion
reactor
to
generate
electricity
in
a
process
similar
to
the
nuclear
fusion
that
powers
the
sun
with
an
estimated
cost
of
about
billion
euros
billion
the
project
is
more
than
halfway
towards
the
first
test
of
its
plasma
by
and
first
fusion
by
iter
member
countries
contributions
to
the
project
are
not
mainly
in
cash
but
in
kind
as
they
finance
the
manufacturing
of
iter
components
via
their
own
national
companies
these
parts
are
then
shipped
to
france
and
assembled
on
iter
s
cadarache
southern
france
site
but
there
is
also
a
cash
contribution
which
for
the
was
million
euros
per
year
in
the
to
period
or
about
million
euros
bigot
said
we
hope
that
at
least
maybe
a
small
part
of
the
contribution
could
be
in
cash
so
as
to
give
a
political
signal
to
the
other
iter
members
said
bigot
who
was
appointed
iter
director
in
iter
s
main
supplier
is
general
atomics
which
is
building
the
project
s
central
solenoid
an
tall
magnet
that
will
be
one
of
the
first
components
to
be
installed
by
the
united
states
has
given
about
billion
to
iter
so
far
and
had
been
planning
to
contribute
an
additional
million
through
euros
