it
s
not
quite
time
to
run
up
the
red
flags
but
some
recent
developments
in
commodity
markets
suggest
it
may
be
time
to
start
looking
for
them
in
the
locker
the
are
two
main
factors
that
appear
to
be
emerging
that
may
threaten
an
end
to
the
current
quite
rosy
picture
surrounding
demand
for
commodities
such
as
iron
ore
steel
and
the
metals
most
exposed
to
the
battery
boom
cobalt
lithium
and
nickel
on
the
supply
side
there
is
a
renewed
rush
of
optimism
that
may
set
off
another
round
of
mining
companies
for
assets
or
sinking
way
too
much
capital
into
projects
approved
on
the
back
of
too
bullish
forecasts
on
the
demand
side
the
drums
of
a
trade
war
are
starting
to
beat
a
little
louder
with
beijing
announcing
duties
on
up
to
billion
of
imports
on
march
that
came
after
the
trump
administration
announced
plans
for
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
goods
in
addition
to
import
taxes
on
steel
and
aluminium
while
equity
markets
take
the
first
hit
in
the
opening
salvoes
of
what
markets
fear
may
become
a
trade
war
it
is
most
likely
that
commodities
will
suffer
longer
and
harder
if
the
worst
does
come
to
pass
commodities
are
generally
seen
as
more
exposed
to
the
global
growth
outlook
and
a
trade
conflict
will
almost
certainly
result
in
economic
growth
being
downgraded
this
is
especially
important
for
commodities
as
they
also
tend
to
be
the
top
performers
when
an
economic
cycle
is
mature
as
is
the
case
with
the
current
global
recovery
in
the
decade
since
the
financial
crisis
however
there
is
still
a
chance
that
trade
wars
remain
mainly
in
the
sphere
of
rhetoric
rather
than
sustained
damaging
actions
whether
the
seeming
optimism
among
major
mining
companies
about
the
future
results
in
a
return
to
the
bad
old
days
of
and
poor
deals
remains
to
be
seen
certainly
the
company
bosses
seem
at
their
most
bullish
in
recent
years
with
the
world
s
biggest
miner
bhp
talking
up
prospects
for
demand
for
minerals
andrew
mackenzie
bhp
s
chief
executive
told
a
conference
in
switzerland
on
march
that
the
world
may
have
to
spend
trillion
annually
to
develop
and
upgrade
its
infrastructure
if
we
look
at
china
s
belt
and
road
initiative
demand
for
steel
is
expected
to
increase
by
an
additional
million
tonnes
over
the
next
decade
mackenzie
said
these
figures
were
echoed
by
bhp
s
president
of
iron
ore
edgar
basto
at
last
week
s
global
iron
ore
and
steel
forecast
conference
in
perth
in
a
presentation
that
went
a
long
way
toward
justifying
the
company
s
planned
billion
south
flank
iron
ore
project
in
western
australia
while
the
new
mine
is
mainly
planned
as
replacement
for
depleting
existing
operations
bhp
is
far
from
alone
in
planning
new
operations
with
rivals
rio
tinto
and
fortescue
metals
group
also
looking
at
signing
off
on
developments
the
industry
is
still
a
long
way
from
undertaking
the
same
sort
of
massive
expansion
it
did
in
the
years
from
in
the
flush
of
optimism
over
china
s
demand
for
ingredients
but
there
are
some
similarities
emerging
with
chinese
demand
once
again
at
the
forefront
both
mackenzie
and
basto
made
much
of
china
s
belt
and
road
initiative
bri
the
government
plan
to
build
infrastructure
and
energy
projects
across
asia
and
africa
as
part
of
a
new
silk
road
promoting
trade
and
development
the
problem
is
that
for
now
much
of
the
bri
remains
at
the
vision
stage
and
very
little
at
the
implementation
phase
if
china
was
really
undertaking
vast
infrastructure
projects
across
south
and
central
asia
as
well
as
in
africa
it
would
be
logical
to
expect
that
it
was
exporting
significantly
more
capital
machinery
and
materials
such
as
steel
instead
foreign
investment
fell
percent
in
from
the
year
earlier
and
this
accelerated
in
january
with
a
drop
of
percent
in
the
prior
months
according
to
official
figures
steel
exports
slumped
percent
last
year
and
were
down
percent
in
the
first
two
months
of
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
exports
of
cement
and
clinker
dropped
percent
in
from
the
prior
year
and
while
vehicle
shipments
did
jump
percent
last
year
this
was
mainly
because
of
an
percent
surge
in
car
exports
which
is
most
likely
not
related
to
bri
spending
bhp
rio
tinto
brazil
s
vale
and
fortescue
all
had
sunk
billions
into
expanding
iron
ore
capacity
resulting
in
a
collapse
of
the
material
s
price
it
has
since
recovered
with
argus
media
quoting
benchmark
percent
iron
ore
delivered
to
china
at
a
tonne
on
march
down
from
at
the
end
of
last
year
but
still
almost
double
the
low
of
hit
in
december
it
took
the
price
slump
for
bhp
and
rio
to
somewhat
reluctantly
back
away
from
their
forecasts
that
chinese
steel
output
would
rise
to
billion
tonnes
and
the
risk
is
now
once
again
the
bri
reality
may
be
somewhat
less
rosy
than
the
current
optimism
more
positive
for
miners
looking
to
enter
the
battery
metals
space
was
the
percent
increase
in
china
s
exports
of
storage
batteries
but
as
some
mining
executives
have
pointed
out
doing
deals
at
the
right
price
in
sectors
the
market
sees
as
hot
is
challenging
there
s
probably
about
percent
of
those
opportunities
out
there
that
you
can
really
add
value
with
mark
cutifani
chief
executive
of
anglo
american
told
the
ft
commodities
global
summit
in
switzerland
last
week
but
in
most
cases
you
are
going
to
pay
high
prices
for
assets
so
it
s
a
hard
way
to
make
money
he
added
it
s
too
early
to
say
that
the
major
miners
are
about
to
leap
headlong
into
the
old
cycle
of
expanding
supply
to
meet
forecasts
but
the
cash
generated
from
the
recovery
in
commodity
prices
over
the
past
two
years
may
be
starting
to
burn
holes
in
their
pockets
