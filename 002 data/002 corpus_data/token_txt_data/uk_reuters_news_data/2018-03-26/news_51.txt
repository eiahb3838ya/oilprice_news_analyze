keeping

japan

percent
for

fourth
consecutive
day
in

the
index
is
headed
for
its
first
quarterly
loss
since
late
as
the
risk
of
faster
rate
rises
and
the
spectre
of
a
trade
war
spooked
investors
who
had
enjoyed
a
bull
run
president
donald
trump
signed
a
memorandum
last
week
that
could
impose
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
imports
from
china
although
the
measures
have
a
consultation
period
before
they
take
effect
protectionism
remains
a
source
of
volatility
and
downside
for
equities
analysts
at
jpmorgan
said
in
a
note
asia
equity
outperformance
is
in
part
a
function
of
faster
growth
and
capital
inflows
both
clearly
at
risk
in
a
trade
china
urged
the
united
states
to
pull
back
from
the
brink
as
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
moved
closer
to
a
trade
war
with
potentially
dire
consequences
for
the
global
economy
the
tariffs
are
on
top
of
additional
duties
on
steel
and
aluminium
on
a
number
of
countries
including
china
which
has
already
hit
back
with
its
own
plans
to
slap
duties
on
up
to
billion
of
imports
tariffs
on
china
will
very
likely
cause
collateral
damage
in
asia
particularly
to
smaller
open
economies
said
alex
wolf
hong
senior
emerging

economist
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
a
greater
share
of
in
computer
imports
comes
from
asia
than
from
china
itself
wolf
added
and
the
integration
of
supply
chains
means
that
small
open
economies
like
korea
and
taiwan
would
be
highly
sensitive
to
us
