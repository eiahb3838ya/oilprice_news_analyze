billions
of
people
live
on
farmland
that
is
deteriorating
and
producing
less
food
and
this
situation
could
force
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
to
migrate
over
the
next
three
decades
a
major
report
said
on
monday
the
study
which
is
backed
by
the
united
nations
said
climate
change
and
worsening
land
quality
could
see
crop
yields
halve
in
some
regions
by
and
warned
that
larger
tracts
of
degraded
land
meant
conflict
over
resources
was
more
likely
decreasing
land
productivity
also
makes
societies
more
vulnerable
to
social
instability
particularly
in
dryland
areas
where
years
with
extremely
low
rainfall
have
been
associated
with
an
increase
of
up
to
percent
in
violent
conflict

scholes
the
report
s
the
report
was
written
by
more
than
experts
from
the
intergovernmental
platform
on
biodiversity
and
ecosystem
services
ipbes
a
global
scientific
group
the
body
said
that
as
degraded
land
becomes
less
productive
through
deforestation
overgrazing
flash
floods
or
drought
people
many
of
them
poor
farmers
are
forced
to
migrate
to
cities
or
abroad
and
it
warned
when
arid
or
dryland
areas
degrade
further
deserts
spread
which
means
lower
crop
yields
in
just
over
three
decades
from
now
an
estimated
billion
people
will
live
in
drylands
scholes
said
in
a
statement
by
then
it
is
likely
that
land
degradation
together
with
the
closely
related
problems
of
climate
change
will
have
forced
million
people
to
migrate
he
said
increasing
demand
for
food
has
led
to
the
rapid
expansion
and
unsustainable
management
of
crop
and
grazing
lands
which
are
key
factors
in
worsening
land
quality
the
report
said
it
said
the
problem
had
reached
critical
levels
in
many
areas
with
wetlands
particularly
badly
affected
land
degradation
drives
climate
change
with
deforestation
which
contributes
percent
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
soil
erosion
worsening
the
problem
it
said
land
degradation
biodiversity
loss
and
climate
change
are
three
different
faces
of
the
same
central
challenge
the
increasingly
dangerous
impact
of
our
choices
on
the
health
of
our
natural
environment
said
robert
watson
an
atmospheric
scientist
and
chair
of
ipbes
in
a
statement
the
report
said
land
could
be
restored
by
planting
trees
using
crops
and
drained
wetlands
