china
s
launch
on
monday
of
its
crude
futures
exchange
will
improve
the
clout
of
the
yuan
in
financial
markets
and
could
threaten
the
international
primacy
of
the
dollar
argues
a
new
report
by
hayden
briscoe
apac
head
of
fixed
income
at
ubs
asset
management
this
is
the
single
biggest
change
in
capital
markets
maybe
of
all
time
briscoe
said
in
a
telephone
interview
the
launch
of
the
oil
futures
denominated
in
china
s
renminbi
currency
also
known
as
the
yuan
is
china
s
first
commodity
derivative
open
to
foreign
investors
this
marked
the
culmination
of
a
push
by
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
shfe
to
give
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumer
more
power
in
pricing
crude
sold
to
asia
already
on
monday
unipec
the
trading
arm
of
asia
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
has
inked
a
deal
with
a
western
oil
major
to
buy
middle
east
crude
priced
against
the
shanghai
crude
futures
contract
this
helps
cement
the
exchange
s
viability
and
challenges
the
system
in
which
oil
deals
are
executed
in
dollars
this
would
decrease
demand
for
the
greenback
and
boost
inflation
china
surpassed
the
united
states
in
to
become
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
nevertheless
the
existing
price
benchmarks
brent
and
wti
crude
are
both
in
dollars
and
importers
across
the
world
must
buy
dollars
in
order
to
conduct
oil
deals
but
the
move
to
trade
oil
in
yuan
will
diminish
the
role
of
the
greenback
in
global
financial
markets
argues
briscoe
pricing
oil
in
renminbi
and
launching
a
trading
hub
will
raise
china
s
prominence
and
integrate
it
further
in
global
markets
and
demand
for
yuan
from
foreign
investors
eager
to
participate
in
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
will
boost
the
currency
s
value
and
divert
trading
away
from
the
dollar
appetite
for
dollars
would
shrink
driving
the
price
of
the
currency
down
the
renminbi
s
prominence
will
only
grow
with
china
s
consumption
demand
will
increase
percent
to
million
tons
per
year
in
according
to
bp
this
power
will
let
china
bypass
the
system
and
demand
that
its
oil
purchases
be
priced
in
yuan
as
seen
in
monday
morning
s
unipec
deal
this
may
be
even
more
likely
in
deals
in
which
china
has
outsized
leverage
such
as
their
offer
to
buy
percent
of
saudi
aramco
as
it
stands
oil
exporters
store
the
revenue
from
their
oil
sales
in
treasury
bonds
a
process
known
as
as
a
result
the
rise
of
the
would
also
jeopardize
a
key
source
of
financing
for
deficit
spending
