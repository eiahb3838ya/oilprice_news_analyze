reuters
china
s
crude
futures
kicked
off
to
a
roaring
start
on
monday
as
western
traders
and
chinese
majors
eagerly
traded
the
world
s
newest
financial
oil
instrument
which
many
expect
to
become
a
third
global
price
benchmark
alongside
brent
and
wti
crude
global
commodity
trader
and
miner
glencore
and
big
merchants
trafigura
freepoint
commodities
and
mercuria
were
among
the
first
to
trade
the
new
contract
even
as
concerns
remain
that
smaller
overseas
investors
may
struggle
with
unfamiliar
rules
and
complex
regulation
the
launch
of
the
oil
futures
isc
china
s
first
commodity
derivative
open
to
foreign
investors
marked
the
culmination
of
a
push
by
the
shanghai
futures
exchange
shfe
to
give
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumer
more
power
in
pricing
crude
sold
to
asia
china
is
the
world
s
oil
consumer
and
in
overtook
the
united
states
as
the
biggest
importer
of
crude
oil
its
demand
is
already
a
key
determinant
of
global
oil
prices
with
major
overseas
traders
displaying
a
strong
appetite
to
punt
in
china
s
vast
derivatives
market
shanghai
s
turnover
challenged
brent
volumes
during
asian
hours
reflecting
the
potential
for
arbitrage
trade
with
oil
markets
in
the
united
states
europe
and
oman
whether
this
will
have
any
real
bearing
on
the
other
crude
benchmarks
i
m
not
quite
sure
but
traders
love
a
new
toy
so
i
applaud
china
for
bringing
in
something
that
could
stoke
up
some
volatility

enthusiasm
saw
million
barrels
of
september
oil
changing
hands
in

by

but
it
s
not
clear
the
pace
will
hold
in
the
night
session
which
runs
from
pm
to
am
or
on
into
coming
days
the
million
barrels
done
in
shanghai
s
morning
session
initially
topped
the
brent
may
crude
contract
before
europe

benchmark
came
alive
around

we
ve
seen
already

analysts
said
western
oil
traders
were
attracted
to
shanghai
s
oil
contracts
for
the
potential
arbitrage
between
china

and
global

fundamentals
as
reflected

crude
is
the
main
benchmark
for
crude
grades
and

crucial
hedging
tool
for
the

priced
off
of
north

oil
and
is
a
primary
value
marker
for

despite
the
success
the

and
experts
involved
in

told

still
china
offers
the
potential
for
a
deep
liquid
market
buoyed
by
an
explosion
of
interest
from
investors
that

supported
its
vast

from

to

in

zhengzhou
and

the

will
also
help

said

a
surprise
to
many
was
that
glencore
executed
shanghai
s
first
crude
deal
commodity
traders
trafigura
and
mercuria
freepoint
and
independent
refiner
shandong
wonfull
were
other
early
participants
glencore
s
first
bid
reflected
the
high
participation
and
enthusiasm
of
foreign

for
chinese

futures
said
yang

general
manager
of
xinhu

co
we
were
active
with
glencore
today
and
i
ve
seen
trafigura
in
it
and
freepoint
we
take
the
view
that
the
contract
is
viable
and
adds
to
the
crude
oil
trading
value
chain
and
is
here
to
stay

it
brokered
the
first

for

and
cleared

through
xinhu
futures
chinese
trader
unipec
told
reuters
it
was
the
counterparty
for
the
glencore
deal
the
early
involvement
of
big
international
traders
was
a
morale
boost
to
the
fledging
market
but
state
oil
majors
like
petrochina
and
sinopec
are
expected
to
provide
a
significant
amount
of
liquidity
in
the
unipec
trading
arm
of
asia
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
has
inked
a
deal
with
a
western
oil
major
to
buy
middle
east
crude
priced
against
the
shanghai
futures
contract
a
senior
company
official
said
on
monday
this
could
be
seen
as
competition
to
the
dubai
mercantile
exchange
s
dme
crude
futures
dubsgefs
and
potentially
the
assessments
published
by

reporting
agency

speculative
retail
and
institutional
investors
also
propped
up
the

liquidity
said

analyst
at

in
the
we
believe
price
fluctuations
will
reflect
domestic
crude
oil
supply
and
demand

long
run
yuan
crude
price
will
mirror
the
moves
of
brent
he
said
the
september
contract
opened
at
yuan
per
barrel
versus
a
reference
point
of
yuan
jumping
as
high
as
yuan
in
the
first
few
minutes
the
jump
came
after
brent
futures
for

delivery
opened
above

for
the
first
time
since
january
on

saudi
arabia
may

as
over
concern
that
the
united

may
sanctions
against
iran
at
the
end
of

session
shanghai
prices
were
up
percent
at

with

were
down
by
that
time
weighed
down
by
concerns
over

dispute
with
china
chinese
exchanges
count
each
side
of
a

the
