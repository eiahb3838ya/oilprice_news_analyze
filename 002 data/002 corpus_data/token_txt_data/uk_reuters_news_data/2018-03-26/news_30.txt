will
install
scrubbers
on
its
fleet
of
newbuild
tankers
to
comply
with
new
regulations
from
that
will
slash
sulphur
levels
that
ships
are
allowed
to
burn
a
company
spokesperson
told
reuters
on
monday
trafigura
confirmed
an
order
announced
last
june
for
up
to
newbuild
crude
oil
and
product
tankers
for
delivery
from
late
this
year
although
most
will
arrive
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
first
vessels
will
be
delivered
in
october
this
year
all
will
be
equipped
with
scrubbers
the
trafigura
spokesperson
said
in
an
emailed
statement
the
spokesperson
declined
to
provide
further
details
on
the
cost
of
installing
the
scrubbers
the
new
international
maritime
organization
imo
rules
will
cut
the
amount
of
sulphur
emissions
that
ships
worldwide
are
allowed
to
percent
by
from
percent
currently
one
way
ships
can
comply
with
the
new
standards
is
to
retrofit
vessels
with
costly
scrubbers
which
can
reduce
sulphur
emissions
even
if
ships
continue
to
burn
dirty
fuel
oil
some
industry
analysts
initially
forecast
a
low
uptake
of
scrubbers
by
the
shipping
industry
due
to
high
upfront
investment
costs
associated
with
the
devices
as
well
as
uncertainties
around
possible
regulations
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
