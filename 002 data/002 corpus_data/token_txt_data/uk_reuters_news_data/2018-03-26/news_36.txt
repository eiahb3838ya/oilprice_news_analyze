uk north sea oil output to resume decline after brief respite
london

the
uk
north
sea
is
set
to
resume
a
decline
in
oil
production
next
year
snapping
a
brief
period
of
growth
since
consultancy
bernstein
said
in
a
report
on
monday
production
in
the
north
sea
home
to
the
brent
global
crude
benchmark
peaked
in
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
had
steadily
slipped
until
when
it
hit
around
bpd
in
the
past
four
years
output
has
stabilised
or
even
recovered
the
halt
to
the
decline
stemmed
from
the
of
several
new
fields
such
as
the
quad
west
of
the
shetland
islands
and
enquest
s
kraken
field
east
of
them
the
revival
was
due
also
to
improved
output
from
existing
fields
as
operators
slowed
the
natural
decline
of
reservoirs
by
accelerating
drilling
around
wells
a
process
known
as
infill
drilling
and
ran
platforms

in
the

output
from
fields
naturally
decreases
as
they
age
and
their

dwindle
the
stability
and

the

production
from
the
uk
north
sea
considered
the
world
s
first
deepwater

basin
is
expected
to
grow
by

or
roughly

in

accounting
for
a
gain
in
output
over
the
period
according
to
bernstein
the
decline
in
output
has
had
a
profound
impact
on
north
sea
producers
nimble
often
privately
owned
companies
such
as
siccar
point
neptune
and
chrysaor
that
specialise
in
extending
the
life
of
ageing
fields
are
gradually
replacing
large
producers
such
as
royal
dutch
shell
and
bp
which
were
among
the
first
to
develop
the
basin
but
see
less
opportunity
there
