american
farmers
are
getting
a
boost
as
china
s
oil
refiners
and
traders
imported
their
biggest
volume
of
ethanol
in
nearly
two
years
last
month
even
as
fears
grew
that
china
would
target
soybeans
in
an
escalating
trade
spate
the
data
is
the
strongest
sign
that
beijing
s
mandate
to
add
biofuel
into
the
nation
s
fuel
by
is
reviving
demand
for
foreign
ethanol
imports
slowed
to
a
trickle
after
beijing
increased
tariffs
in
january
last
year
independent
refiners
often
known
as
teapots
are
scooping
up
imports
to
blend
into
their
gasoline
because
the
country
does
not
produce
enough
to
meet
growing
consumption
rates
china
bought
cubic

customs

the
united
states
one
of
the
world
s
top
producers
alongside
brazil
according
to
data
from
the
general
administration
of
customs
while
the
value
of
the
ethanol
is
small
compared
with
the
those
of
soybeans
it
is
good
news
for
farmers
in
the
world
s
top
corn
grower
who
worry
china
will
retaliate
against
washington
s
recent
aggressive
trade
moves
by
curbing
soybean
imports
soybeans
were
the
biggest
agricultural
export
to
china
last
year
china

beijing
responded
to
the
