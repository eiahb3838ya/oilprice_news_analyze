buenos

march
reuters
a
labor
agreement
between
companies
workers
and
the
government
of
argentina
meant
to
reduce
production
costs
and
lure
investors
to
the
sprawling
vaca
muerta
shale
formation
is
facing
resistance
industry
sources
told
reuters
vaca
muerta
has
attracted
investment
from
chevron
corp
and
exxon
mobil
corp
but
the
formation
which
is
about
the
size
of
belgium
remains
mostly
unexplored
largely
due
to
high
production
costs
and
a
lack
of
labor
flexibility
oil
major
executives
have
said
the
landmark
january
labor
agreement
and
a
subsidy
deal
sought
to
change
the
dynamic
and
jumpstart
investment
promising
government
subsidized
prices
for
natural
gas
stable
taxes
and
more
attractive
labor
contracts
to
employers
but
it
has
yet
to
be
fully
implemented
and
companies
may
have
to
offer
pay
incentives
to
make
it
work
undermining
its
appeal
to
firms
eyeing
vaca
muerta
sources
told
reuters
rising
oil
prices
could
help
smooth
sources
said
but
for
now
the
labor
agreement
is
failing
to
live
up
to
expectations
if
you
don
t
do
anything
to
ensure
its
terms
are
applied
then
obviously
the
unions
are
going
to
refuse
to
cooperate
an
industry
source
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
the
source
said
that
modifications
to
labor
contracts
had
been
successfully
applied
to
unions
in
hydraulic
fracturing
but
had
yet
to
reach
other
areas
like
operations
and
maintenance
facing
pressure
from
workers
some
companies
operating
in
vaca
muerta
have
paid
bonuses
to
unions
in
exchange
for
signing
new
more
flexible
agreements
meaning
that
the
of
the
scale
initially
imagined
were
never
realized
said
daniel
gerold
director
of
g
g
energy
consultants
which
focuses
on
oil
and
gas
sectors
in
argentina
and
latin
america
some
parts
of
the
agreement
have
been
implemented
and
it
is
a
step
forward
but
there
s
more
to
be
done
gerold
said
a
union
representative
said
workers
were
holding
up
their
end
of
the
agreement
though
some
companies
had
made
voluntary
payments
beyond
those
agreed
upon
in
last
year
s
deal
if
there
s
a
company
that
pays
more
than
the
agreement
suggests
there
s
no
reason
to
question
them
that
s
their
prerogative
said
guillermo
pereyra
a
senator
from
the
patagonian
province
of
neuquen
and
secretary
general
of
the
oil
and
gas
workers
union

of

r√≠o
negro
and
chubut
sources
close
to
companies
operating
in
vaca
muerta
said
many
firms
still
found
themselves
in
continuous
negotiations
with
unions
despite
the
pact
the
important
thing
is
to
apply
the
agreement
as
it
s
written
and
not
have
to
negotiate
every
detail
today
you
still
have
to
negotiate
how
the
agreement
will
be
applied
said
an
industry
source
on
condition
of
anonymity
another
industry
source
said
the
deal
had
faced
a
rocky
start
but
its
implementation
had
improved
markedly
recently
with
rising
global
oil
prices
on
the
horizon
and
the
gas
subsidies
in
place
we
re
going
to
see
a
year
of
more
work
and
more
fluid
application
of
the
agreement
the
source
said
of
expectations
that
with
more
jobs
in
the
sector
unions
will
be
more
willing
to
apply
the
accord
as
part
of
the
pact
argentina
offered
a
subsidized
price
of
per
million
british
thermal
units
of
natural
gas
produced
at
new
wells
in
more
than
double
that
of
natural
gas
futures
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
the
subsidy
offered
by
the
macri
administration
was
seen
as
a
critical
element
in
bringing
firms
and
labor
unions
together
to
sign
the
agreement
