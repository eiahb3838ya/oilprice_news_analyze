asian
shares
were
hammered
again
on
monday
as
fears
of
a
trade
war
between
the
united
states
and
china
took
their
toll
but
the
safe
haven
yen
came
off
its
highs
and
stock
futures
climbed
as
investors
saw
some
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
global
markets
were
shaken
when
president
donald
trump
moved
to
slap
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
on
top
of
import
duties
on
steel
and
aluminium
prompting
a
defiant
response
from
beijing
but
futures
for
the
s
p
brushed
off
the
gloom
on
monday
to
leap
percent
on
reports
the
united
states
and
china
have
quietly
started
negotiating
to
improve
access
to
chinese
markets
the
united
states
also
agreed
to
exempt
south
korea
from
steel
tariffs
imposing
instead
a
quota
on
steel
imports
as
the
two
countries
renegotiate
their
trade
deal
if
we
do
start
to
hear
more
favourable
news
from
the
administration
and
indeed
from
the
chinese
side
over
the
next
few
trading
sessions
then
we
may
see
a
sharp
reversal
of
the
recent
moves
in
the
market
said
nick
twidale
chief
operating
officer
at
rakuten
securities
australia
the
positive
headlines
were
little
consolation
for
asian
shares
which
were
left
nursing
their
wounds
japan
s
nikkei
trimmed
early
losses
but
were
still
down
percent
chinese
shares
declined
about
percent
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
slipped
percent
for
its
fourth
consecutive
day
in
the
red
the
index
is
headed
for
its
first
quarterly
decline
since
late
as
the
risk
of
faster
rate
rises
and
a
trade
war
spooked
investors
who
had
enjoyed
a
bull
run
south
korea
s
benchmark

index
rose
percent
one
of
only
three
markets
in
positive
territory
protectionism
remains
a
source
of
volatility
and
downside
risk
for
equities
analysts
at
jpmorgan
said
in
a
note
asia
equity
outperformance
is
in
part
a
function
of
faster
growth
and
capital
inflows
both
clearly
at
risk
in
a
trade
in
the
uncertain
global
economic
climate
investors
looked
to
pile
into
the
japanese
yen
traditionally
a
safe
haven
asset
thanks
to
the
country
s
massive
current
account
surplus
speculators
added
short
dollar
bets
to
their
portfolios
taking
the
net
short
position
to
its
highest
in
more
than
a
year
according
to
calculations
by

and
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
for
the
week
to
march
short
yen
positions
were
cut
to
the
smallest
since
november
by
late
asian
trade
the
yen
had
eased
slightly
from
near
highs
to
per
dollar
while
the
australian
and
new
zealand
dollars
a
liquid
proxy
for
china
plays
staged
a
welcome
rebound
the
aussie
was
up
percent
while
the
kiwi
gained
percent
the
dollar
index
tracking
the
greenback
against
six
other
major
currencies
was
near
a
low
at
in
commodities
international
brent
crude
futures
opened
above
per
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
january
but
the
gains
could
not
be
sustained
as
the
ongoing
trade
disputes
weighed
on
global
markets
