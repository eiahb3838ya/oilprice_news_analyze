activity
and
interrupt
exports
of
grains
and
other
goods
thousands

harvest
in
an
effort
to
address

congressional

floated
a
plan
on

to
eliminate
the
cide
fuel
tax
and
put
additional
revenue
from
payroll
taxes
toward
reducing
fuel
prices
which
have
surged
nearly
percent
in
less
than
a
year
diesel
prices
ended
last

at
reais
per
liter
according
to
regulator
anp
however
the
trucking
group
organizing
the
protests
abcam
said
demonstrations
would
continue
on
wednesday
complaining
that
the
cide
accounted
for
only
a
fraction
of
the
taxes
on
diesel
fuel
according
to
petrobras
state
and
federal
taxes
make
up
percent
of
the
final

paid

that
doesn
t
solve
the
problem
we
want
to
be
heard
we
want
diesel
taxes
to
be
eliminated
abcam
president
josé
da
fonseca
lopes
told
reuters
his
comments
added
to
pressure
on
the
government
to
provide
relief
from
fuel
costs
giving
it
the
choice
of
backsliding
on
efforts
to
close
brazil
s
fiscal
deficit
or
interfering
in
the
oil
company
s
pricing
policy
a
small
diesel
price
cut
announced
on
tuesday
by
petroleo
brasileiro
sa
or
petrobras
did
nothing
to
reduce
protests
but
it
did
raise
concerns
about
interference
in
a
program
of
adjustments
to
track
global
markets
since
last
july
that
new
pricing
policy
which
has
allowed
the
company
to
sell
fuel
at
a
profit
after
absorbing
losses
for
years
has
been
key
to
the
operational
turnaround
at
petrobras
lifting
its
share
price
to
an
high
this
month
petrobras
chief
executive
pedro
parente
and
finance
minister
eduardo
guardia
both
denied
that
the
government
had
asked
the
company
to
change
its
pricing
policy
on
tuesday
petrobras
shares
fell
as
much
as
percent
on
concerns
of
political
interference
but
pared
losses
to
percent
on
news
of
the
proposal
to
lower
pump
prices
through
tax
policy
abcam
said
truckers
protested
in
states
as
participation
rose
from
around
drivers
on
monday
the
first
day
of
demonstrations
to
an
estimated
on
tuesday
that
would
represent
around
a
tenth
