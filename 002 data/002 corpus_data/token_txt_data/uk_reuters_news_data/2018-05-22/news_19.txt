significant
gains
in

fiercely
opposed
to
israel
and
underlining
tehran
s
growing
regional
clout
the
leader
of
shi
ite
hezbollah
sayyed
hassan
nasrallah
called
the
result
a
a
very
big
political
parliamentary
and
moral
victory
for
the
choice
of
resistance
the
number
of
hezbollah
mps
was
the

or
little

in
major
cities
hezbollah
and
its
political
allies
won
just
over
half
the

s
electoral
districts
branded

armed
shi
ite
hezbollah
has
grown
in
strength
since
joining
the
war
in
syria
in
support
of
president
bashar
in
the
strong
showing
by
parties
and
politicians
who
support
hezbollah
s
possession
of
weapons
risk
complicating
western
policy
in
lebanon
which
is
banking
on
foreign
aid
and
loans
to
revive
its
stagnant
economy
and
receives
military
support
an
israeli
minister
said
the
outcome
showed
the
lebanese
state
was
indistinguishable
from
hezbollah
signalling
the
risk
of
israel
hitting
lebanon
s
government
in
a
future
war
prime
minister
saad
lost
over

third
of
his
seats

new
voting
law
and
gaps
in
his
party
s
performance
but
with
mps
down
from
in
the
last
parliament
he
still
emerged
as
the
sunni
muslim
leader
with
the
biggest
bloc
in
the
house
making
him
the
frontrunner
to
form
the
next
government
the
staunchly
lebanese
forces
a
christian
party
emerged
as
a
big
winner
nearly
doubling
its
lawmakers
to
around
according
to
initial
indications
lebanon
s
prime
minister
must
be
a
sunni
under
its
sectarian
system
the
new
government
like
the
outgoing
one
is
expected
to
include
all
the
main
parties
talks
over
cabinet
posts
are
expected
to
take
time
hariri
is
going
to
be
further
weakened
in
any
kind
of
government
going
forward
said
andrew
tabler
of
the
washington
institute
his
ability
to
substantially
tame
or
restrain
hezbollah
in

is
going
to
be
very

movement
led
by
parliament
speaker
nabih
berri
and
the
christian
free
patriotic
movement
of
president
michel
aoun
a
hezbollah
ally
since
who
has
said
its
arsenal
is
needed
to
defend
lebanon
while
hezbollah
and
its
allies
do
not
always
see
eye
to
eye
their
support
for
its
arsenal
is
vital
to
the
group
in
lebanon
where
its
weapons
have
been
a
major
point
of
friction
for
years
hezbollah
lost
ground
in
the
constituency
one
of
its
strongholds
two
of
seats
there
were
won
by
its
opponents
one
by
the
lebanese
forces
and
the
other
by
future
it
also
failed
to
take
a
shi
ite
seat
in
byblos
turnout
was
percent
down
from
percent
the
last
time
legislative
elections
were
held
nine
years
ago
an
independent
candidate
running
against
the
political
establishment
won
a
seat
in
beirut
an
coalition
led
by
hariri
and
backed
by
saudi
arabia
won
a
majority
in
parliament
in
but
that
march
alliance
disintegrated
and
riyadh
has
switched
its
attention
to
confronting
iran
in
other
parts
of
the
region
notably
yemen
samir
geagea
the
lebanese
forces
leader
said
the
results
showed
there
was
still
a
popular
ground
that
backs
march
and
would
give
us
strength
to
fix
the
path
much
more
than
we
were
able
to
in
past
years
geagea
is
hezbollah
s
most
prominent
lebanese
christian
opponent
he
led
the
lebanese
forces
militia
in
the
last
years
of
the
civil
war
during
which
he
was
an
adversary
of
aoun
hariri
has
urged
the
quick
formation
of
a
government
after
the
election
so
it
can
press
ahead
with
reforms
needed
to
reduce
state
debt
levels
among
the
highest
in
the
world
he
said
the
international
community
should
look
at
the
election
result
in
a
very
positive
way
donors
want
to
see
reforms
before
they
release
some
of
the
billion
of
aid
and
soft
loans
pledged
in
april
lebanon
has
been
a
big
recipient
of
foreign
aid
to
help
it
cope
with
hosting
one
million
refugees
from
neighbouring
syria
nasrallah
called
for
the
quick
formation
of
a
new
government
and
said
it
should
be
done
in
a
spirit
of
cooperation
putting
aside
differences
lebanon
should
have
held
a
parliamentary
election
in
but
mps
instead
voted
to
extend
their
own
term
because
leaders
could
not
agree
on
a
new
parliamentary
election
law
the
question
of
hezbollah
s
weapons
has
slipped
down
on
lebanon
s
political
agenda
in
recent
years
hariri
who
led
years
of
political
conflict
with
the
group
says
it
is
an
issue
to
be
resolved
regionally
through
dialogue
the
lebanon
vote
is
to
be
followed
on
may
by
an
iraqi
election
that
is
also
set
to
underline
iran
s
reach
with
one
of
three
shi
ite
leaders
set
to
become
prime
minister
iran
said
it
respected
lebanon
s
election
while
france
said
the
vote
was
an
important
step
