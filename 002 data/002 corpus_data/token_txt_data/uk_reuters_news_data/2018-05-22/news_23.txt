europe
s
energy
chief
will
seek
to
reassure
iran
s
top
ministers
on
saturday
that
the
european
union
wants
to
keep
trade
open
despite
the
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
deal
miguel
arias
canete
european
commissioner
for
energy
and
climate
will
meet
with
five
top
iranian
minister
over
two
days
including
the
islamic
republic
s
nuclear
chief
oil
minister
and
foreign
minister
eu
leaders
have
united
behind
the
accord
with
brussels
considering
banning
firms
from
complying
with
the
sanctions
that
president
donald
trump
has
reimposed
and
urging
governments
to
make
money
transfers
to
iran
s
central
bank
to
avoid
fines
but
eu
officials
admit
there
is
a
limit
to
what
they
can
do
to
parry
sanctions
as
a
wave
of
european
companies
quit
business
with
tehran
fearing
the
global
reach
of
sanctions
there
is
no
magic
wand
beyond
trying
to
offer
iran
a
bit
of
reassurance
a
senior
eu
official
involved
in
iran
talks
told
reuters
the
mission
led
by
canete
is
a
symbolic
gesture
to
urge
iran
s
leadership
to
stick
to
the
nuclear
deal
and
shore
up
support
for
the
relatively
moderate
president
hassan
rouhani
against
hardliners
looking
to
constrain
his
ability
to
open
up
to
the
west
eu
officials
said
the
mission
is
very
important
to
us
because
it
shows
the
eu
s
determination
to
stand
by
its
commitment
a
senior
iranian
official
said
europe
sees
the
pact
limiting
iran
s
nuclear
activities
in
exchange
for
the
relaxation
of
economic
sanctions
as
vital
for
international
security
trump
denounced
it
as
the
worst
deal
ever
for
failing
to
curb
iran
s
separate
ballistic
missile
programme
and
its
influence
in
syria
yemen
iraq
and
lebanon
with
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
threatening
the
accord
s
economic
payoff
for
tehran
eu
diplomats
worry
they
will
lose
what
little
sway
they
have
in
the
islamic
republic
canete
will
raise
with
tehran
the
possibility
of
eu
governments
bypassing
the
financial
system
by
making
direct
payments
to
iran
for
oil
exports
and
to
repatriate
iranian
funds
in
europe
though
the
move
will
be
up
to
member
states
in
other
efforts
to
shield
european
firms
the
eu
s
blocking
statute
would
ban
eu
companies
from
complying
with
sanctions
and
does
not
recognise
any
court
rulings
that
enforce
american
penalties
the
eu
is
also
seeking
to
allow
the
european
investment
bank
to
do
business
in
iran
and
to
scale
up
credit
lines
from
eu
states
but
some
big
names
are
already
heading
for
the
door
french
energy
group
total
said
it
may
quit
a
gas
project
that
tehran
had
repeatedly
hailed
as
a
symbol
of
the
nuclear
accord
s
success
the
first
sanctions
to
snap
back
into
place
are
limits
on
iranian
oil
exports
that
choked
off
more
than
half
of
iran
s
oil
exports
after
largely
due
to
european
and
asian
buyers
cutting
back
one
of
the
big
factors
for
how
the
iranians
will
react
is
what
oil
importers
will
do
and
how
well
the
energy
system
can
cope
another
eu
official
said
it
will
be
difficult
for
us
to
deliver
on
the
benefits
the
iranians
are
sanctions
