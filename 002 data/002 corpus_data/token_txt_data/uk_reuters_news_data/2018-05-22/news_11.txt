london
reuters
lawyers
for
the
bodo
community
in
nigeria
s
niger
delta
which
was
devastated
by
two
major
oil
spills
a
decade
ago
went
to
court
in
london
on
tuesday
to
fend
off
what
they
said
was
an
attempt
by
shell
to
kill
off
their
litigation
the
bodo
oil
spills
have
been
the
subject
of
years
of
legal
wrangling
in
shell
accepted
liability
for
the
spills
agreeing
to
pay
million
pounds
million
at
the
time
to
bodo
villagers
and
to
clean
up
their
lands
and
waterways
oil
spills
sometimes
due
to
vandalism
sometimes
to
corrosion
are
common
in
the
niger
delta
a
vast
maze
of
creeks
and
mangrove
swamps
by
pipelines
and
blighted
by
poverty
pollution
corruption
and
violence
the
spills
have
had
a
catastrophic
impact
on
many
communities
where
people
have
no
other
water
supply
than
the
creeks
and
rely
on
farming
and
fishing
for
survival
at
the
same
time
oil
companies
have
run
into
problems
trying
to
clean
up
spills
sometimes
because
of
obstruction
and
even
violence
by
local
gangs
trying
to
extract
bigger
payouts
or
to
obtain
contracts
after
years
of
delays
the
in
bodo
is
currently
underway
and
litigation
in
the
london
high
court
is
stayed
or
on
hold
lawyers
for
spdc
the
nigerian
arm
of
shell
argued
on
tuesday
that
the
litigation
should
be
struck
off
in
october
or
at
the
latest
a
year
later
and
that
it
should
only
be
if
spdc
failed
to
comply
with
its
obligation
to
pay
for
the
lawyers
for
the
bodo
community
said
that
was
unacceptable
because
the
could
go
wrong
for
any
number
of
reasons
and
that
under
shell
s
proposal
the
villagers
would
be
left
without
the
recourse
of
going
back
to
court
the
effect
of
what
shell
is
trying
to
do
is
to
kill
off
the
case
said
dan
leader
the
bodo
community
s
lead
lawyer
on
the
sidelines
of
the
hearing
it
s
only
because
of
the
pressure
of
litigation
that
the
is
getting
back
on
but
shell
s
lawyers
citing
an
earlier
judgment
compared
the
stayed
litigation
to
a
gun
in
the
cupboard
that
the
bodo
community
s
lawyers
wanted
to
be
able
to
hold
to
shell
s
head
at
their
convenience
for
years
on
end
they
said
the
litigation
was
a
hindrance
to
the
because
it
gave
some
local
community
members
the
impression
that
there
was
still
the
possibility
of
a
bigger
payout
incentivising
them
to
block
the
rather
than
cooperate
the
previous
persistent
delays
to
the
process
clearly
demonstrate
that
litigating
nigerian
oil
spill
cases
in
the
english
courts
does
little
to
resolve
the
complex
underlying
security
and
community
issues
which
can
frustrate
attempts
to
clean
up
areas
impacted
by
oil
pollution
an
spdc
spokeswoman
said
we
hope
that
the
community
will
continue
to
grant
the
access
needed
for
to
progress
as
a
judgment
on
the
litigation
issues
is
expected
on
friday
