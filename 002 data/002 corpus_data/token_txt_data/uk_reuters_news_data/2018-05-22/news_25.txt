reuters
hedge
funds
are
rolling
forward
long
positions
in
the
brent
futures
contract
and
in
the
absence
of
offsetting
factors
this
is
depressing
the
value
of
expiring
contracts
pushing
futures
prices
into
contango
since
the
end
of
june
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
have
built
up
a
net
long
position
in
brent
in
the
expectation
that
prices
will
continue
to
rise
hedge
funds
held
long
futures
and
options
positions
equivalent
to
almost
million
barrels
on
may
according
to
position
reports
published
by
the
intercontinental
exchange
these
were
partially
offset
by
short
positions
amounting
to
million
barrels
giving
a
net
long
of
almost
million
barrels
fund
managers
also
held
million
barrels
of
positions
in
the
calendar
spreads
offsetting
long
and
short
positions
in
different
contract
months
some
positions
were
held
in
the
form
of
options
but
most
were
futures
with
a
net
long
position
in
futures
alone
amounting
to
million
barrels
for
the
brent
contract
as
a
whole
the
total
number
of
open
positions
in
futures
across
all
maturities
and
all
market
participants
was
equivalent
to
million
barrels
of
all
the
open
positions
almost
percent
were
concentrated
in
the
first
three
contracts
expiring
in
july
million
barrels
august
million
barrels
and
september
million
barrels
unless
the
hedge
fund
positions
were
distributed
very
differently
to
other
market
participants
a
substantial
number
must
have
been
held
in
the
first
three
months
in
fact
many
fund
managers
especially
those
following
strategies
have
a
strong
preference
for
liquidity
so
they
tend
to
hold
their
position
in
the
closest
and
most
liquid
contract
months
but
as
those
contracts
approach
expiry
positions
must
be
rolled
forward
or
allowed
to
terminate
automatically
with
the
passage
of
time
chart
chart
the
rolling
forward
of
long
positions
tends
to
push
the
front
end
of
the
futures
curve
from
backwardation
towards
contango
because
they
involve
the
simultaneous
sale
of
a
contract
and
purchase
of
one
further
forward
of
course
for
every
long
position
there
is
a
short
and
the
rolling
of
short
positions
tends
to
have
the
opposite
effect
pushing
the
market
from
contango
towards
backwardation
in
theory
the
impact
of
rolling
forward
long
and
short
positions
should
be
neutral
in
practice
different
groups
of
market
participants
employ
different
strategies
and
have
a
different
impact
on
price
formation
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
tend
to
be
dynamic
rather
than
passive
because
they
trade
on
expectations
of
where
prices
will
move
in
future
the
sheer
number
of
hedge
fund
long
positions
already
established
in
the
market
and
needing
to
be
rolled
forward
each
month
is
now
weighing
on
prices
at
the
front
end
of
the
curve
while
fund
managers
were
still
accumulating
net
longs
between
june
and
march
the
negative
impact
on
calendar
spreads
was
masked
by
the
amount
of
new
buying
each
month
but
hedge
funds
have
been
reducing
their
net
position
in
brent
since
the
middle
of
april
the
net
position
has
been
cut
by
million
barrels
or
percent
since
april
if
the
problem
of
rolled
longs
persists
many
more
hedge
funds
are
likely
to
try
to
escape
it
by
shifting
positions
further
along
the
curve
towards
contracts
