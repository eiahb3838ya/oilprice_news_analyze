drop
to

pdvsa
last

started
requesting
crude
from
its
joint
ventures
in
the
orinoco
belt
venezuela
s
largest
producing
region
to
supply
its
domestic
refineries
which
also
has
reduced
the
volume
of
oil
available
to
customers
including
citgo
since
financial
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
pdvsa
and
quality
problems
with
some
pdvsa
s
crude
grades
also
have
created
obstacles
for
customers
to
import
or
pay
for
oil
shipments
from
the
south
american
country
affecting
refiners
such
as
pbf
and
phillips
but
the
export
drop
has
not
stopped
valero
from
receiving
more
venezuelan
oil
through
its
existing
supply
contracts
with
pdvsa
most
of
its
purchases
are
made
under
terms
that
have
not
been
affected
by
financial
sanctions
according
to
traders
in
april
valero
received
cargoes
of
venezuelan
crude
for
its
gulf
refineries
compared
with
