mumbai

reuters
indian
oil
corp
ioc
the
country
s
top
refiner
will
turn
to
its
traditional
oil
suppliers
mostly
in
the
middle
east
if
sanctions
against
iran
result
in
supply
disruptions
its
head
of
finance
said
president
donald
trump
earlier
this
month
pulled
out
of
a
international
nuclear
pact
with
iran
and
said
he
would
impose
sanctions
on
tehran
and
companies
that
continue
to
work
with
it
unless
it
curbed
its
influence
in
the
middle
east
other
signatories
of
the
pact
france
germany
britain
russia
and
china
said
they
would
try
to
salvage
the
deal
and
keep
iran
s
oil
trade
and
investment
flowing
so
far
we
haven
t
cut
any
volumes
from
iran
we
have
to
see
how
strongly
the
takes
up
sanctions
from
our
side
we
would
like
to
continue
otherwise
we
will
look
to
our
traditional
suppliers
sharma
said
ioc
which
controls
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
refining
capacity
or
about
a
third
of
the
country
s
overall
capacity
plans
to
buy
bpd
of
iranian
oil
in
and
has
an
option
to
buy
an
additional
bpd
state
refiners
such
as
ioc
have
raised
imports
after
iran
agreed
to
steep
shipping
discounts
iran
s
high
sulphur
oil
can
be
replaced
with
other
crudes
it
is
just
a
case
of
economics
replacing
will
mean
slightly
cost
disadvantage
sharma
added
ioc
chairman
sanjiv
singh
said
the
government
had
so
far
not
directed
refiners
to
cut
imports
from
iran
we
have
to
see
how
situation
unfolds
in
future
he
said
previously
india
obtained
a
waiver
from
western
sanctions
as
the
country
had
cut
imports
from
the
islamic
republic
we
are
working
on
a
strategy
we
are
working
on
alternate
plans
if
those
volumes
go
down
then
how
do
we
manage
the
situation
singh
said
ioc
is
iran
s
biggest
indian
oil
client
the
company
meets
about
percent
of
its
oil
needs
through
annual
contracts
deals
mainly
with
middle
eastern
producers
it
makes
sense
for
ioc
to
look
for
alternatives
to
iranian
oil
from
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
due
to
geographical
proximity
and
similarities
in
the
oil
produced
however
an
ioc
official
said
separately
the
company
could
also
tap
the
spot
market
to
buy
oil
there
is
an
option
to
buy
oil
like
mars
but
we
will
do
that
if
arbitrage
is
favorable
the
official
said
ioc
recently
bought
million
barrels
of
oil
via
a
tender
