a
monitoring
group
wants
to
enlist
the
help
of
the
world
s
biggest
oil
trading
companies
to
enforce
sanctions
that
cap
the
amount
of
crude
and
related
products
north
korea
can
import
the
coordinator
said
the
security
council
ramped
up
sanctions
last
year
after
north
korea
said
it
had
conducted
missile
tests
that
put
the
mainland
in
range
of
its
nuclear
weapons
under
the
restrictions
pyongyang
is
limited
to
importing
million
barrels
of
crude
and
barrels
of
products
a
year
but
the
panel
of
experts
appointed
by
the
security
council
said
in
march
that
additional
fuel
was
being
sold
to
north
korea
via
illicit
deals
involving
transfers
of
petroleum
from
large
ships
to
smaller
vessels
at
sea
to
evade
detection
the
panel
said
in
its
march
report
that
it
had
investigated
at
least
four
such
transfers
and
was
also
investigating
several
multinational
oil
companies
for
their
roles
in
the
supply
chain
of
petroleum
products
hugh
griffiths
the
monitoring
group
coordinator
told
reuters
he
was
seeking
support
from
the
top
traders
to
help
implement
sanctions
and
proposed
clauses
that
they
could
add
to
their
oil
deals
to
prevent
fuel
ending
up
in
north
korea
he
said
the
big
traders
represent
the
choke
point
in
the
supply
chain
and
if
all
the
big
ones
sign
up
and
make
this
the
industry
standard
all
smaller
players
will
have
to
comply
the
panel
sent
a
letter
in
may
to
major
traders
operating
in
the
region
outlining
the
recommended
contract
clauses
the
letter
was
also
sent
to
regional
refiners
and
some
specialist
firms
mainly
in
singapore
griffiths
who
did
not
identify
the
firms
or
the
other
companies
targeted
said
all
the
firms
had
been
asked
to
respond
within
a
month
of
receiving
the
letter
a
list
of
those
that
failed
to
reply
would
be
published
after
that
period
he
said
in
its
march
report
the
panel
named
trafigura
as
a
trader
that
initially
handled
fuel
that
eventually
ended
up
in
north
korea
in
transfers
it
was
the
only
multinational
named
in
the
report
on
the
issue
trafigura
denied
involvement
in
the
illicit
trade
and
said
it
had
no
knowledge
that
its
fuel
would
end
up
in
north
korea
ben
luckock
trafigura
s
of
risk
said
his
firm
had
consulted
with
officials
and
had
added
new
clauses
requiring
proof
of
a
cargo
s
final
discharge
we
are
also
stipulating
that
buyers
require
that
vessels
they
use
for
such
cargoes
do
not
switch
off
their
automatic
identifier
system
ais
he
said
referring
to
a
ship
s
satellite
tracking
system
several
major
firms
active
in
asian
trading
said
they
already
had
measures
in
place
to
prevent
a
spokeswoman
for
royal
dutch
shell
who
did
not
say
whether
the
firm
had
been
sent
a
letter
from
the
panel
said
the
company
had
clauses
prohibiting
clients
selling
to
countries
under
sanctions
while
bp
said
it
complied
with
all
sanctions
requirements
vitol
said
it
had
robust
compliance
procedures
in
place
while
mercuria
said
it
was
always
happy
to
help
international
bodies
to
bring
additional
transparency
on
these
issues
glencore
and
gunvor
two
other
major
oil
traders
in
the
region
had
no
immediate
comment
griffiths
said
the
main
focus
was
on
fob
contracts
in
which
a
seller
hands
responsibility
to
the
buyer
once
a
cargo
is
loaded
on
a
ship
typically
the
contracts
have
a
final
destination
clause
but
no
further
proof
of
a
cargo
s
fate
is
usually
required
after
the
sale
once
the
product
is
sold
they
don
t
really
pay
attention
to
what
happens
afterward
griffiths
said
he
said
traders
or
those
selling
the
cargoes
should
be
implementing
verification
measures
which
means
that
if
a
product
is
delivered
to
another
ship
all
details
of
the
shipment
are
provided
including
official
documents
showing
that
a
cargo
s
entire
volume
was
delivered
to
a
ship
or
port
he
said
clauses
should
prevent
a
ship
with
a
fuel
cargo
from
turning
off
its
ais
and
an
insurer
could
invalidate
a
policy
if
the
ais
was
switched
off
in
march
the
security
council
blacklisted
dozens
of
ships
and
shipping
firms
over
oil
and
coal
smuggling
by
north
korea
the
united
states
also
imposed
sanctions
on
dozens
of
firms
to
shut
down
what
it
said
was
illicit
oil
and
coal
smuggling
activities
griffiths
said
the
panel
was
also
investigating
multiple
companies
particularly
down
the
supply
chain
smaller
brokers
over
suspected
violations
he
did
not
name
the
firms
