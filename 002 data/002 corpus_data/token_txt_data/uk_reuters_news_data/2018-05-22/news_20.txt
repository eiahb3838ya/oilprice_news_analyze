global markets-european shares eye four-month high, italy sell-off relents
london
reuters
european
shares
inched
toward
highs
on
tuesday
as
an
easing
of
pressure
on
italy
s
debt
markets
coincided
with
china
s
latest
move
to
open
up
its
giant
economy
to
the
rest
of
the
world
a
pause
in
the
dollar
s
recent
rally
also
meant
respite
for
some
battered
emerging
markets
though
still
not
turkey
while
signs
of
better
and
china
trade
relations
had
wall
street
futures
pointing
higher
early
european
trading
saw
italian
government
bond
yields
come
off
highs
after
six
days
of
heavy
selling
on
concerns
over
policies
mooted
by
a
potential
new
ruling
coalition
the
proposed
of
the
movement
and
the
league
has
pushed
rome
s
yields
up
nearly
basis
points
since
the
start
of
the
month
and
plenty
of
questions
remain
who
will
be
the
next
finance
minister
in
italy
that
is
the
question
in
the
market
at
the
moment
said
rabobank
s
head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
one
of
the
names
in
the
frame
is
paolo
savona
an
economist
and
former
industry
minister
he
is
seen
as
quite
a
eurosceptic
de
groot
added
it
would
be
quite
tough
for
the
market
to
italy
s
main
bourse
also
outperformed
as
the
news
flow
eased
europe
s
big
carmakers
volkswagen
bmw
and
daimler
jumped
to
percent
too
after
china
said
it
would
cut
import
duty
on
passenger
cars
and
car
parts
from
july
shares
of
ford
general
motors
and
electric
car
maker
tesla
were
up
between
percent
and
percent
in
market
trading
in
asia
overnight
japan
s
nikkei
had
ended
percent
lower
and
australian
shares
fell
percent
chinese
stocks
also
finished
in
the
red
with
the
off
percent
analysts
said
investors
in
the
region
were
worried
about
the
growth
outlook
with
the
federal
reserve
s
plans
to
increase
its
interest
rates
pushing
up
global
borrowing
costs
stocks
have
rallied
several
times
on
the
belief
that
trade
tensions
were
easing
only
to
fall
back
down
as
investors
took
the
opposite
view
said
james
mcglew
executive
director
of
stockbroking
at
argonaut
a
total
of
three
hikes
is
almost
fully
by
the
market
for
although
some
investors
expect
the
fed
to
be
more
aggressive
the
central
bank
will
publish
minutes
of
its
may
meeting
when
it
held
rates
steady
later
this
week
emerging
market
stocks
snapped
a
losing
streak
and
many
of
the
more
currencies
such
as
the
south
african
rand
mexican
peso
and
indian
rupee
pulled
out
of
their
recent
dives
as
the
dollar
eased
back
turkey
s
lira
had
initially
clawed
higher
too
only
to
fall
sharply
again
to
a
fresh
record
low
after
another
warning
about
the
country
s
credit
rating
it
has
now
plunged
over
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
the
market
is
clearly
screaming
out
for
a
massive
rate
hike
but
it
s
not
getting
it
and
the
rising
oil
price
is
killing
them
too
said
standard
life
aberdeen
s
kevin
daly
we
are
short
the
lira
and
short
turkish
bonds
so
we
are
certainly
not
being
tempted
at
this
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
currency
against
the
other
main
world
currencies
was
last
down
percent
at
from
monday
s
top
of
as
the
euro
clawed
back
above
elsewhere
oil
prices
bobbed
just
under
highs
last
seen
in
after
venezuela
s
weekend
presidential
election
heightened
persistent
worries
about
falls
in
global
oil
output
the
market
is
bracing
for
the
possibility
of
additional
sanctions
on
the
country
following
president
nicolas
maduro
s
crude
added
cents
to
per
barrel
and
brent
rose
cents
to
the
combination
of
higher
oil
and
conciliatory
actions
on
the
trade
front
boosted
the
australian
dollar
a
liquid
proxy
for
risk
to
a
peak
as
the
dollar
edged
back
gold
prices
eased
off
december
lows
to
get
to
an
ounce
