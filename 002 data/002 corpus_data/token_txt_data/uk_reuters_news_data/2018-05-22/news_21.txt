reuters
iran
poured
scorn
on
threatened
sanctions
on
tuesday
and
told
european
powers
to
step
up
and
salvage
its
international
nuclear
deal
though
germany
signalled
there
was
only
so
much
it
could
do
to
fend
off
washington
s
economic
clout
senior
iranian
military
and
political
figures
queued
up
to
issue
defiant
statements
a
day
after
washington
threatened
the
strongest
sanctions
in
history
if
iran
failed
to
make
a
series
of
sweeping
changes
two
weeks
on
from
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
nuclear
pact
his
administration
told
iran
to
drop
its
nuclear
programme
and
pull
out
of
the
syrian
civil
war
among
other
demands
setting
washington
and
tehran
further
on
a
course
of
confrontation
the
people
of
iran
should
stand
united
in
the
face
of
this
and
they
will
deliver
a
strong
punch
to
the
mouth
of
the
american
secretary
of
state
and
anyone
who
backs
them
ismail
kowsari
a
senior
commander
with
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
said
according
to
the
iranian
labour
news
agency
the
nuclear
agreement
worked
out
by
the
united
states
france
germany
britain
russia
china
and
iran
lifted
sanctions
on
iran
in
exchange
for
tehran
limiting
its
atomic
programme
trump
called
it
the
worst
deal
ever
negotiated
but
european
powers
see
it
as
the
best
chance
of
stopping
iran
developing
a
nuclear
bomb
after
trump
pulled
out
the
other
signatories
said
they
would
try
to
salvage
the
deal
and
keep
iran
s
oil
trade
and
investment
flowing
but
european
companies
say
they
are
worried
about
getting
caught
up
in
the
new
sanctions
given
the
extent
of
washington
s
global
reach
and
some
have
already
started
pulling
out
the
head
of
iran
s
national
security
and
foreign
policy
committee
in
parliament
said
that
the
only
way
to
salvage
the
nuclear
deal
would
be
for
the
european
signatories
to
stand
up
to
the
united
states
today
they
must
show
their
strength
in
the
face
of
american
pressure
alaeddin
borujerdi
said
according
to
the
iranian
students
news
agency
german
foreign
minister
heiko
maas
on
monday
told
reporters
in
argentina
he
would
travel
on
from
there
to
washington
to
discuss
the
nuclear
deal
with
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
he
gave
no
date
for
his
meeting
germany
s
economy
minister
earlier
told
a
newspaper
the
berlin
government
would
help
german
firms
with
business
in
iran
where
it
could
but
could
not
entirely
shield
them
from
the
decision
to
quit
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
reimpose
sanctions
asked
how
the
german
government
could
assist
german
firms
feeling
nervous
in
the
wake
of
the
decision
peter
altmaier
told
the
passauer
neue
presse
newspaper
that
berlin
would
help
them
assess
the
situation
and
developments
while
also
urging
the
to
grant
exemptions
and
deadline
extensions
we
will
help
where
we
can
but
there
is
no
way
of
completely
averting
the
consequences
of
this
unilateral
withdrawal
he
said
his
statement
was
echoed
by
luxembourg
s
foreign
minister
jean
asselborn
who
said
there
were
limits
to
the
european
union
s
powers
to
persuade
its
larger
firms
to
stay
in
iran
in
the
face
of
threatened
sanctions
we
know
there
are
hardly
any
larger
companies
in
europe
that
do
not
also
trade
with
the
united
states
the
pressure
on
european
companies
from
the
is
quite
large
he
told
reporters
in
brussels
we
are
in
the
situation
that
we
re
i
believe
we
should
not
give
up
we
should
try
until
the
end
to
show
with
our
heads
held
high
that
we
are
right
and
trump
is
wrong
he
added
french
president
emmanuel
macron
last
week
acknowledged
the
dilemma
faced
by
firms
choosing
between
trading
with
the
biggest
economy
in
the
world
the
united
states
and
risking
sanctions
and
massive
fines
by
trading
with
iran
