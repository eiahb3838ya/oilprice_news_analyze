the

well
below
an
peak
of
points
hit
in
january
and
is
flat
so
far
this
year
after
a
percent
gain
in
we
are
seeing
dollar
strength
and
that
is
causing
money
to
flow
out
from
emerging
markets
to
the
there
is
some
sort
of
risk
aversion
going
on
said
yoshinori
shigemi
global
market
strategist
at
jpmorgan
asset
management
people
are
cautious
about
taking
exposure
in
emerging
those
concerns
offset
the
boost
to
sentiment
from
overnight
gains
on
wall
street
over
the
apparent
reconciliation
between
the
united
states
and
china
over
import
duties
analysts
said
investors
in
the
region
were
worried
about
the
growth
outlook
with
the
federal
reserve
staying
on
its
policy
tightening
path
stocks
have
rallied
several
times
on
the
belief
that
trade
tensions
were
easing
only
to
fall
back
down
as
investors
took
the
opposite
view
said
james
mcglew
executive
director
of
stockbroking
at
argonaut
while
the
global
economy
remains
robust
and
earnings
have
been
strong
stock
markets
have
mostly
traded
sideways
this
year
because
many
investors
have
started
to
fear
that
the
pace
of
the
expansion
has
already
jpmorgan
s
shigemi
said
investors
will
now
turn
their
focus
to
the
next
fed
meeting
on
june
where
it
is
widely
expected
to
raise
rates
for
a
second
time
this
year
a
total
of
three
hikes
is
almost
fully
by
the
market
for
although
some
investors
expect
the
fed
to
be
more
aggressive
it
was
the
fear
of
higher
inflation
and
thus
faster
fed
rate
rises
that
caused
a
bond
market
rout
earlier
this
year
sending
yields
sharply
higher
and
triggering
a
share
market
the
dollar
hovered
near

against
a
basket
