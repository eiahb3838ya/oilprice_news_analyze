venezuela
s
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
faced
widespread
international
condemnation
on
monday
after
his
in
a
weekend
vote
his
critics
denounced
as
a
farce
cementing
autocracy
in
the
oil
producer
the
united

is
actively
considering
oil
sanctions
on
venezuela
where
output
has
dropped
by
a
third
in
two
years
to
its
lowest
in

tightening
the

that
looming

will
curb
that
country

crude
exports
have
also
been
boosting

oanda
s
innes
said
that
and
the
impact
of
output
curbs
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
had
created
supply
conditions
with
any
