the
dollar
hovered
near
highs
on
tuesday
on
renewed
optimism
about
global
growth
as
the
united
states
and
china
agreed
to
drop
their
tariff
threats
while
oil
stayed
at
peaks
over
potential
sanctions
in
venezuela
beijing
and
washington
both
claimed
victory
on
monday
as
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
stepped
back
from
the
brink
of
a
global
trade
war
and
agreed
to
hold
further
talks
to
boost
exports
to
china
while
the
apparent
truce
over
their
trade
disagreements
bolstered
sentiment
on
wall
street
it
failed
to
excite
stock
markets
in
asia
japan
s
nikkei
was
barely
changed

the

was
still
well
below
an
peak
of

in

stocks
have
generally
been
volatile
this
year
on
a
combination
of
factors
including
the
prospect
of
faster
rate
rises
by
the
federal
reserve
and
worries
about
a
trade
war
wall
street
indices
rose

the

in
the
analysts
expect
stocks
to
trend
higher
as
trade
tensions
settle
and
peak
anxieties
subside
the
clouds
are
lifting
for
stocks
jpmorgan
analysts
said
in
a
note
however
obstacles
still
exist
on
the
horizon
they
added
pointing
to
the
future
path
of
fed
tightening
it
was
the
fear
of
higher
inflation
and
thus
faster
fed
rate
rises
that
caused
a
bond
market
rout
earlier
this
year
sending
yields
sharply
higher
and
causing
a
share
market
thus
any
china
trade
celebration
may
only
last
a
couple
of
weeks
as
investors
turn
their
focus
to
the
june
fed
two
more
rate
hikes
are
almost
fully
by
the
market
for
this
year
taking
the
tally
for
to
three

some
investors
expect
the
fed
to
be
more
aggressive
