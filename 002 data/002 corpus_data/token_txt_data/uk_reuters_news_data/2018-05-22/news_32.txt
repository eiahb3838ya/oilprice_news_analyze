european
shares
inched
to
a
near
high
on
tuesday
as
an
easing
of
pressure
on
italian
markets
coincided
with
china
s
latest
move
to
open
up
its
giant
economy
to
the
rest
of
the
world
a
pause
in
the
dollar
s
recent
rally
also
meant
some
respite
for
emerging
markets
tempting
some
investors
back
into
assets
of
countries
like
turkey
and
south
africa
early
european
trading
saw
italian
government
bond
yields
come
off
highs
after
six
days
of
heavy
selling
on
concerns
over
policies
mooted
by
a
potential
new
ruling
coalition
the
proposed
of
the
movement
and
the
league
has
pushed
rome
s
yields
up
nearly
basis
points
since
the
start
of
the
month
and
plenty
of
questions
remain
who
will
be
the
next
finance
minister
in
italy
that
is
the
question
in
the
market
at
the
moment
said
rabobank
s
head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
one
of
the
names
in
the
frame
is
paolo
savona
an
economist
and
former
industry
minister
he
is
seen
as
quite
a
eurosceptic
de
groot
added
it
would
be
quite
tough
for
the
market
to
italy

main
bourse

outperformed

the

flow
eased
europe
s
big
carmakers
volkswagen
bmw
and

to
percent
too
after
china
said
it
would
cut
import
duty
on
passenger
cars
and
car
parts
from
july
in
asia
overnight
japan

chinese
stocks
finished
in
the

too
with
the
off
percent
analysts
said
investors
in
the
region
were
worried
about
the
growth
outlook
with
the
federal
reserve
s
plans
to
increase
its
interest
rates
pushing
up
global
borrowing
costs
stocks
have
rallied
several
times
on
the
belief
that
trade
tensions
were
easing
only
to
fall
back
down
as
investors
took
the
opposite
view
said
james
mcglew
executive
director
of
stockbroking
at
argonaut
a
total
of
three
hikes
is
almost
fully

the

for
although
some
investors
expect
the

be
more
aggressive
emerging

stocks
snapped
a
losing
streak
and
many
of
the
more
currencies
such
as
the
turkish
lira
and
south
african
rand
pulled
out
of
their
recent
dives
as
the
