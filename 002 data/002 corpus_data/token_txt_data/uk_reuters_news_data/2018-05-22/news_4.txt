china
s
interest
in
reducing
its
trade
surplus
with
the
united

through
increased
energy
imports
could
advance

for
liquefied
natural

plants
and
ethanol
sales

facilities
said
washington
and
beijing
stepped
back
from
the
brink
of
a
trade
war
after
talks
last
week
with
the
united
states
appearing
to
set
aside
for
now
its
demands
that
china
revamp
key
planks
of
its
industrial
policy
china
represents
an
enormous
economic
opportunity
for
lng
and
ethanol
exports
as
both
products
will
likely
see
dramatic
demand
growth
in
the
coming
years
during
which
time
the
united
states
is
also
expected
to
dominate
global
export
markets
katie
bays
energy
analyst
at

securities
in
washington
said
in
a
note
on
tuesday
bays
estimated
that
substantial
lng
sales
commitments
could
bring
in
between
billion
and
billion
annually
and
ethanol
sales
could
reach
billion
to
billion
annually
she
noted
however
that
the
lng
and
ethanol
markets
are
not
big
enough
by
themselves
to
meet
president
donald
trump
s
goal
of
reducing
the
chinese
trade
deficit
by
billion
per
year
on
tuesday
cheniere
energy
inc
said
its
board
approved
financing
for
an
lng
unit
the
first
new
approval
in
the
united

since
the

adds
a
third
unit
capable
of
producing
cubic
feet
per

of
liquefied
natural
gas
to
its
corpus

texas
plant
there
are
more
than
two
dozen
proposed
lng
plants
waiting
for
customer
commitments
to
reach
a
final
investment
decision
many
of
them
looking
to
china
for
deals
china
overtook
south
korea
in
as
the
world
s
second
biggest
buyer
of
lng
behind
japan
the
country
which
imported
billion
cubic
feet
per
day
last
year
is
looking
to
buy
more
sources
of
energy
like
gas
to
reduce
its
use
of
coal
and
cut
pollution
charlie
cone
lng
proprietary
analyst
for
energy
data
provider
genscape
said
at
least
percent
of
total
lng
cargoes
currently
go
to
china
we
expect
this
number
to
grow
as
more
firms
sign
agreements
with
chinese
buyers
as
their
nation
continues
to
develop
its
gas
infrastructure
cone
said
bays
said
a
hold
on
the

war
could
drive
chinese

proposing
a

in
the
gulf
of

and
aiming
for
a

as
early
as
this
year
to
go
ahead
and
produce
up
to
million
metric
tons
per

for

it
s
strictly
been
about

to

said
greg

chief
executive
of

which
is
developing
an
lng
plant
in
louisiana
and
another
in
nova

it
hopes
to
reach
a
final

decision
on
the

begin

said
if
you
look
at
some
forecasts
for

are
really
only
two
places
that
have
significant
increases
in
lng
imports
europe
goes
up
about
mtpa
and
china
goes
up
about

vesey
said
texas
lng
which
is
proposing
a
export
facility
in
brownsville
texas
and
has
five
agreements
with
chinese
customers
hopes
to
make
a
final
decision
next
year
about
six
months
behind
its
original
goal
sentiment
in
the
lng
markets
is
heating
up
again
said
langtry
meyer
of
the
company
he
added
however
that
texas
lng
was
not
considering
developing
an
import
terminal
in
china
which
would
likely
be
needed
to
expand
exports
as
for
ethanol
bays

securities
said
ethanol
producers
like
archer
daniels
midland
co
and
green
plains
inc
could
benefit
from
negotiations
with
china
given
the
political
importance
of
corn
producers
to
trump
coupled
with
china
s
need
to
increase
ethanol
imports
dramatically
to
meet
its
renewable
fuel
objectives
