we

she

virtually
all
the

to

for

will
be
influenced
by

she
added
wallace

has
committed
to
put

investments
in

to

a

which
organised
the
lisbon
forum
said
entrepreneurs
trying
to
build
local
markets
for
solar
systems
in
developing
countries
are
struggling
to
find
capital
including
from
development
banks
the
money
is
beginning
to
flow
from
the
top
but
it
s
not
reaching
some
markets
and
in
other
markets
it
s
reaching
there
but
it
s
too
expensive
she
said
in
an
interview
this
week
shine
in
which
seforall
is
a
partner
hopes
to
attract
new
funders
that
could
contribute
to
filling
those
gaps
whether
in
geographical
locations
or
supply
chains
with
patient
capital
which
is
invested
for
at
least
three
years
we
need
to
stay
committed
until
we
get
the
job
done
said
dorsey
this
can
t
be
a
some
governments
including
in
mexico
and
rwanda
have
set
up
funds
dedicated
to
boosting
investment
in
renewables
and
getting
electricity
to
those
without
and
are
those
efforts
with
levies
on
large
power
consumers
meanwhile
energy
investment
businesses
like
sunfunder
are
starting
to
raise
larger
amounts
of
debt
finance
for
companies
that
are
building
solar
systems
in
africa
often
based
on
technology
in
a
report
this
month
sunfunder
said
catalytic
capital
from
foundations
and
impact
investors
including
facebook
and
the
rockefeller
foundation
had
been
critical
in
helping
attract
institutional
investors
to
its
debt
funds
by
bearing
upfront
risks
yet
despite
a
rise
in
investor
interest
development
and
energy
experts
in
lisbon
agreed
that
commercial
dollars
are
unlikely
to
reach
the
most
marginalised
communities
any
time
soon
especially
impoverished
women
there
is
a
crying
need
among
financiers
to
better
understand
the
needs
of
small
enterprises
doing
the
last
mile
said
lucy
stevens
of
development
charity
practical
action
referring
to
companies
bringing
clean
energy
to
remote
areas
researchers
spoke
about
the
importance
of
helping
local
people
develop
businesses
that
will
stimulate
demand
for
the
power
generated
by
using
renewable
energy
sources
in
south
tanzania
for
example
a
hydropower
utility
set
up
agricultural
processing
plants
whose
revenues
go
towards
maintenance
costs
and
subsidising
cheaper
power
but
in
some
cases
where
a
sustainable
business
model
is
simply
not
possible
governments
and
development
agencies
may
need
to
look
at
bundling
access
to
energy
into
social
safety
nets
for
the
poorest
said
seforall
s
kyte
and
others
andrew
scott
of
the
overseas
development
institute
said
there
would
always
be
a
proportion
of
people
who
can
not
afford
to
pay
for
electricity
or
cleaner
cooking
fuels
under
social
protection
programmes
they
could
be
given
cash
transfers
and
vouchers
or
free
power
connections
and
equipment
he
added
kyte
said
all
kinds
of
new
capital
would
be
needed
to
meet
the
world
s
energy
access
targets
to
that
end
the
shine
campaign
can
link
the
growing
ranks
of
philanthropists
and
investors
looking
to
make
a
social
impact
with
evidence
on
how
to
achieve
that
by
supplying
clean
energy
to
the
poor
she
said
we
ve
been
able
to
converge
these
different
conversations
around
this
is
the
