feature-growing up - why the uae's first vertical farm could be a regional gamechanger

when
people
picture
the
united
arab
emirates
what
likely
comes
to
mind
are
desert
sands
skyscrapers
and
a
blue
sea
under
a
shimmering
sun
agriculture
does
not
there
are
good
reasons
for
this
the
federation
of
seven
emirates
is
hampered
by
high
temperatures
a
lack
of
arable
land
salty
soil
and
steep
production
costs
and
that
is
without
accounting
for
the
occasional
voracious
locust
swarm
so
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
the
uae
imports
nearly
percent
of
its
food
needs
according
to
the
abu
dhabi
global
environmental
data
initiative
a
data
research
organization
this
reliance
on
the
global
food
trade
brings
opportunity
said
saudi
arabian
entrepreneur
omar
al
jundi
who
has
built
the
middle
east
s
first
commercial
vertical
farm
in
dubai
badia
farm
the
word
means
oasis
in
arabic
grows
greens
like
radish
kale
mustard
basil
and
arugula
in
a
controlled
indoors
environment
using
hydroponic
technology
and
led
lights
as
a
region
that
has
struggled
to
grow
crops
due
to
largely
hostile
desert
landscapes
our
farm
offers
a
viable
solution
to
farming
that
produces
harvests
days
of
the
year
he
said
the
produce
will
not
only
be
cheaper
than
imported
goods
but
fresher
too
as
the
farms
will
be
producing
all
year
the
farm
which
began
production
late
last
year
is
on
an
plot
of
land
in
one
of
dubai
s
main
industrial
areas
and
produces
two
hundred
boxes
of
green
vegetables
a
day
though
this
pales
in
comparison
to
the
world
s
largest
vertical
farm
which
operates
on
square
metres
of
a
former
steel
factory
in
new
jersey
in
the
united
states
it
marks
a
big
step
for
alternative
farming
in
this
region
vertical
farming
is
taking
off
elsewhere
too
europe
s
first
commercial
farm
opened
near
amsterdam
last
year
and
shanghai
will
next
year
start
a
agricultural
district
with
skyscrapers
dedicated
to
growing
fruit
and
vegetables
vertical
farming
brings
some
important
benefits
said
al
jundi
because
produce
is
grown
in
a
controlled
environment
there
is
no
need
for
pesticides
or
chemicals
and
they
use
much
less
water
percent
less
than
farming
growing
food
locally
for
the
firm
s
uae
clients
mainly
restaurants
and
hotels
means
a
smaller
carbon
footprint
and
saves
on
transport
costs
it
makes
no
sense
to
order
produce
that
arrives
in
boxes
in
the
back
of
a
ship
from
as
far
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
away
when
it
can
be
grown
at
home
he
said
even
though
the
uae
imports
most
of
its
food
the
emirates
are
food
secure
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
however
its
food
security
is
not
without
risk
said
hina
kamal
a
research
analyst
at
the
uae
university
s
college
of
food
agriculture
as
it
is
reliant
on
vulnerabilities
in
supplier
countries
and
on
the
international
food
trade
market
another
concern
is
climate
change
which
is
likely
to
increase
food
prices
in
the
years
ahead
said
majid
sultan
al
qassimi
of
the
uae
s
ministry
of
climate
change
and
environment
although
the
uae
has
strategic
reserves
in
place
to
protect
it
from
disruptions
he
said
ensuring
global
food
security
will
be
challenging
in
the
future
due
to
impacts
of
climate
change
part
of
the
solution
he
said
is
to
boost
domestic
production
through
sustainable
means
another
is
to
diversify
imports
and
investments
to
ensure
that
the
country
is
food
secure
in
the
other
solutions
include
setting
up
storage
facilities
abroad
and
acquiring
farmland
in
africa
europe
and
asia
emirates
nbd
a
large
regional
bank
says
uae
investors
were
part
of
at
least
deals
in
the
past
years
covering
about
million
hectares
of
farmland
globally
the
emirates
drive
to
secure
land
abroad
to
assure
its
food
supply
is
not
kamal
said
and
could
be
undone
by
political
conditions
in
those
countries
or
by
climate
change
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
countries
will
be
highly
affected
by
climate
change
both
through
more
extreme
weather
events
and
reduced
productivity
over
droughts
or
food
shortages
could
for
example
see
host
governments
impose
export
bans
she
said
which
is
why
boosting
productivity
at
home
is
the
way
to
ensure
food
security
in
the
decades
to
come
it
is
also
more
sustainable
the
uae
will
need
to
improve
its
agricultural
productivity
in
the
coming
decades
to
meet
demand
said
qassimi
and
to
do
so
in
the
face
of
rising
global
temperatures
that
are
expected
to
worsen
extreme
weather
events
all
of
this
has
a
direct
impact
on
agricultural
production
affecting
both
food
producers
and
those
who
depend
on
them
the
uae
is
no
exception
he
said
nor
for
that
matter
is
the
gulf
region
noted
a
report
last
year
from
the
emirates
wildlife
society
and
world
wildlife
fund
which
evaluated
the
likely
effects
of
climate
change
on
food
security
the
uae
is
a
major
regional
hub
for
the
of
food
commodities
it
pointed
out
and
the
consequences
of
climate
change
including
hotter
weather
could
affect
those
facilities
any
resultant
food
price
spikes
would
hurt
the
poorest
the
most
and
that
could
drive
a
need
for
food
subsidies
there
are
other
factors
too
not
least
water
the
uae
s
agricultural
sector
accounts
for
just
percent
of
its
economy
the
report
noted
yet
uses
about
of
its
water
vastly
disproportionate
to
its
gdp
contribution
said
fanack
water
a
research
group
given
that
water
is
more
expensive
than
electricity
in
the
uae
and
given
that
regular
farmers
benefit
from
subsidies
for
water
al
jundi
of
badia
farm
said
ending
such
breaks
would
make
vertical
farming
a
cheaper
solution
the
money
spent
on
powering
vertical
farms
is
relatively
much
lower
than
of
the
cost
of
water
used
in
open
that
said
badia
does
use
plenty
of
electricity
from
pumping
water
to
powering
the
artificial
lighting
and
computers
that
monitor
temperatures
but
looking
ahead
said
al
jundi
it
is
working
with
the
government
on
a
shift
to
renewable
energy
the
impact
one
vertical
farm
can
have
though
is
limited
and
will
be
felt
only
on
the
margins
it
will
not
change
the
uae
s
reliance
on
countries
such
as
brazil
india
iran
and
south
africa
for
cereals
sugar
and
food
oils
for
example
but
what
it
represents
a
better
way
of
growing
produce
in
a
region
that
is
facing
significant
challenges
from
climate
change
is
important
al
jundi
said
this
technology
will
be
a
major
contributor
to
agriculture
sustainability
food
diversity
and
security
as
it
enhances
crop
production
and
lowers
their
cost
