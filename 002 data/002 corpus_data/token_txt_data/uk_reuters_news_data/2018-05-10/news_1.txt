he
is
seeking
to
lift

from
future

close
to

compared
with
percent
under
existing
arrangements
with
shell
shell
s
deal
inherited
after
it
acquired
bg
group
in
was
amended
in
under
government
pressure
to
include
a
percent
share
of
profits
but
it
is
still
among
the
most
lucrative
contracts
for
any
lng
exporter
we
invited
possible
lng
buyers
so
they
are
aware
of
the
opportunities
lima
said
adding
that
talks
are
progressing
with
china
national
offshore

cnooc
russia

said
equatorial
guinea
s
lng
plant
operated
by
marathon
oil
corporation
is
currently
fed
by
the
depleting
alba
gas
field
which
faces
a
dip
in
output
from
he
said
future
production
will
be
underpinned
by
pooling
supply
from
stranded
gas
fields
in
equatorial
guinea
and
the
wider
region
raising
the
prospect
of
eventually
boosting
lng
output
and
state
energy
revenue
lima
s
sales
pitch
shows
how
producers
from
fully
projects
can
afford
to
release
supply
to
unconventional
buyers
such
as
trade
houses
under
short
tenors
stimulating
global
lng
market
liquidity
brunei
qatar
malaysia
algeria
and
nigeria
all
have
lng
contracts
expiring
in
coming
years
in
signing
up
to
buy
all
of
equatorial
guinea
s
million
tonnes
of
annual
lng
output
for
years
bg
group
later
acquired
by
shell
sealed
one
of
the
industry
s
most
lucrative
lng
deals
it
paid
a
fixed
discount
to
henry
hub
gas
prices
now
one
of
the
cheapest
gas
benchmarks
in
the
world
as
it
initially
planned
to
sell
supply
into
that
market
as
the
shale
gas
revolution
killed
demand
for
lng
imports
bg
group
benefited
from
paying
prices
for
the
lng
as
it
diverted
supply
to
asia
where
prices
were
up
to
five
times
higher
the
original
contract
made
no
provision
for
profit
sharing
on
cargo
diversions
with
the
government
highlighting
how
america
s
transformation
from
gas
importer
to
exporter
blindsided

players

of
three
trillion

only
provided
for
the
first
years
of
the
plant
s
output
leaving
the
later
part
of
bg
s
contract
uncovered
this
may
have
allowed
the
government
to
exit
the
deal
early
in
an
industry
source
said
but
new
gas
supplies
are
being
lined
up
in
a
statement
on
thursday
noble
energy
announced
a
pact
with
equatorial
guinea
to
make
available
of
gas
from
its
offshore
alen
field
for
the

plant
the
proposal
envisages
a
platform
and
pipeline
miles
to
punta
europa
big
enough
to
carry
gas
from
other
nearby
fields
in
a
concession
to
lima

vision
for
equatorial
guinea
to
be
a
regional
