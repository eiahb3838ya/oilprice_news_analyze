column-oil price rise poses challenge for sanctions policy: kemp
london
reuters
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
seem
to
have
an
understanding
to
keep
the
oil
market
well
supplied
and
avoid
a
significant
price
rise
after
the
of
sanctions
on
iran
but
exactly
what
this
involves
is
not
clear
to
the
market
and
may
not
even
be
clear
to
the
two
governments
themselves
sowing
uncertainty
in
the
weeks
ahead
we
have
had
various
conversations
with
various
parties
about
different
parties
that
would
be
willing
to
increase
oil
supply
to
offset
the
impact
of
sanctions

my
expectation
is
not
that
oil
prices
go
higher
to
a
certain
extent
some
of
this
was
already
in
the
market
on
oil
prices
mnuchin
added
he
declined
to
name
the
countries
or
companies
involved
but
since
saudi
arabia
holds
most
of
the
world
s
spare
production
capacity
it
is
likely
to
have
been
included
in
retrospect
the
president
s
april
tweet
blaming
opec
for
high
oil
prices
can
be
seen
as
part
of
the
negotiating
the
basic
bargain
appears
to
be
that
the
united
states
will
impose
tough
sanctions
that
curb
iran
s
oil
exports
and
in
return
saudi
arabia
will
avoid
a
damaging
and
politically
controversial
spike
in
prices
saudi
arabia
appeared
to
confirm
the
existence
of
an
understanding
by
committing
to
maintain
the
stability
of
oil
markets
and
more
specifically
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
any
potential
supply
shortages
the
kingdom
committed
to
work
with
major
producers
within
and
outside
opec
as
well
as
major
consumers
to
limit
the
impact
from
possible
supply
disruptions
the
comments
were
made
in
an
unusual
statement
issued
by
the
kingdom
s
ministry
of
energy
and
carried
by
the
official
news
agency
shortly
after
the
sanctions
were
announced
they
were
subsequently
confirmed
by
the
energy
minister
in
a
statement
on
twitter
and
in
briefings
with
news
organisations
while
the
existence
of
an
understanding
seems
fairly
well
confirmed
its
content
remains
a
mystery
neither
saudi
arabia
nor
the
united
states
have
indicated
a
specific
price
level
that
would
trigger
a
production
increase
and
the
kingdom
has
declined
to
give
a
specific
commitment
to
replace
any
fall
in
iranian
oil
exports
now
or
in
the
future
instead
saudi
sources
have
briefed
the
media
to
say
the
kingdom
would
not
act
alone
to
increase
production
and
intends
to
consult
with
other
opec
and
members
opec
sources
have
indicated
the
organisation
has
up
to
days
until
the
end
of
the
sanctions
period
before
needing
to
decide
whether
to
increase
output
elsewhere
to
compensate
for
iran
the
safest
thing
for
opec
may
be
to
leave
output
unchanged
in
the
near
term
and
monitor
the
situation
opec
in
no
hurry
to
decide
if
extra
oil
needed
to
offset
iran
reuters
may
in
the
past
saudi
arabia
has
usually
been
slow
to
raise
production
in
response
to
rising
prices
preferring
the
extra
revenue
to
using
spare
capacity
to
put
a
lid
on
prices
but
in
a
market
like
oil
traders
will
respond
to
the
prospect
of
supply
curbs
in
future
by
driving
up
the
price
now
so
if
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
stall
the
market
will
reach
its
own
judgement
about
the
impact
on
the
balance
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
may
have
reached
a
detailed
agreement
on
how
to
handle
the
prospective
reduction
of
iranian
oil
exports
and
its
impact
on
oil
prices
but
it
is
also
possible
that
they
have
reached
nothing
more
than
a
vague
political
consensus
or
gentleman
s
agreement
and
plan
to
improvise
if
so
that
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
misunderstandings
and
uncertainty
the
recent
rise
in
crude
oil
prices
will
very
likely
push
average
gasoline
prices
above
the
psychologically
important
threshold
of
per
gallon
next
week
for
the
first
time
since
and
if
prices
continue
to
escalate
they
could
become
a
political
issue
in
the
united
states
ahead
of
congressional
elections
in
november
neither
the
trump
administration
nor
saudi
arabia
will
want
to
be
blamed
for
driving
oil
prices
significantly
higher
the
president
has
already
said
that
oil
prices
are
artificially
very
high
and
this
will
not
be
accepted
while
saudi
arabia
has
been
trying
to
push
prices
higher
and
resisting
calls
for
it
to
ease
production
curbs
saudi
officials
have
said
that
the
market
can
absorb
higher
prices
though
they
do
not
want
them
to
rise
too
much
but
there
is
a
lot
of
uncertainty
about
how
much
is
too
much
in
the
end
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
may
have
differing
views
about
what
would
constitute
an
unacceptable
spike
in
prices
in
response
to
sanctions
whatever
they
may
want
benchmark
brent
futures
prices
have
risen
by
almost
per
barrel
or
percent
over
the
last
week
and
more
than

percent
higher
over

and
