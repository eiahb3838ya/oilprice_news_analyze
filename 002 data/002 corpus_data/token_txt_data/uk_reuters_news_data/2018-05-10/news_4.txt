reuters
venezuela
on
thursday
rejected
conocophillips
s
moves
to
seize
the
country
s
caribbean
assets
to
collect
on
a
billion
arbitration
award
but
in
a
sign
the
oil
company
s
pressure
might
be
working
caracas
also
suggested
it
was
ready
to
pay
in
its
first
official
comments
since
reuters
revealed
conoco
s
actions
over
the
weekend
venezuela
s
leftist
government
said
pdvsa
wanted
to
solve
the
dispute
through
legal
means
the
dispute
stems
from
venezuela
s
nationalization
of
conoco
s
assets
a
decade
ago
under
late
leader
hugo
chavez
pdvsa
is
committed
to
honoring
the
decisions
stemming
from
the
arbitration
award
the
oil
ministry
said
in
a
series
of
tweets
the
tweets
disappeared
about
an
hour
later
venezuela
s
oil
ministry
and
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
conoco
is
looking
forward
to
pdvsa
s
proposals
to
resolve
this
matter
said
janet
langford
carrig
conocophillips
senior
vice
president
general
counsel
and
corporate
secretary
in
an
email
but
absent
any
agreement
and
payment
of
the
icc
award
we
will
continue
our
enforcement
venezuela
would
be
hard
pressed
to
cough
up
billion
as
it
faces
a
brutal
recession
hefty
debt
payments
to
bondholders
and
an
upcoming
presidential
election
nicolas
maduro
s
leftist
administration
is
also
battling
more
than
a
dozen
other
arbitration
cases
triggered
by
a
wave
of
nationalizations
under
chavez
who
died
of
cancer
in
venezuela
has
requested
annulments
or
shown
little
willingness
to
pay
recent
awards
leading
creditors
to
pursue
its
overseas
assets
as
a
form
of
payment
in
the
most
aggressive
move
to
date
conocophillips
last
week
moved
to
temporarily
seize
pdvsa
s
assets
on
aruba
bonaire
curacao
and
eustatius
that
threw
venezuela
s
oil
export
chain
into
a
tailspin
just
as
venezuela
s
crude
production
has
crumbled
to
an
over
low
due
to
underinvestment
theft
a
brain
drain
and
mismanagement
pdvsa
was
forced
to
suspend
oil
storage
and
shipping
from
its
caribbean
facilities
and
has
concentrated
most
shipping
in
its
main
crude
terminal
of
jose
which
is
suffering
from
a
backlog
conoco
s
actions
may
have
also
spurred
action
from
other
creditors
who
fear
ending
up
at
the
end
of
the
line
mining
company
rusoro
filed
a
lawsuit
seeking
to
attach
assets
of
pdvsa
s
citgo
petroleum
as
payment
for
a
billion
arbitration
award
and
a
firm
that
received
the
venezuelan
promissory
notes
from
canadian
contractor
on
wednesday
sued
pdvsa
for
over
million
over
nonpayment
