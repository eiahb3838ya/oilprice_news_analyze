hawaii
authorities
scrambled
to
move
tens
of
thousands
of
gallons
of
highly
flammable
chemicals
from
the
path
of
lava
on
thursday
and
the
state
s
governor
warned
mass
evacuations
might
be
needed
as
the
kilauea
volcano
s
eruption
became
more
violent
after
a
new
fissure
opened
on
wednesday
about
half
a
mile
from
a
geothermal
power
plant
hawaii
governor
david
ige
set
up
an
emergency
task
force
to
remove
the
pentane
used
in
the
plant
s
turbines
he
cited
estimates
that
if
the
fluid
ignites
the
resulting
explosion
could
create
a
blast
radius
of
up
to
one
mile
km
the
puna
geothermal
venture
plant
sits
at
the
edge
of
the
leilani
estates
residential
area
on
hawaii
s
big
island
where
lava
from
volcanic
fissures
has
so
far
destroyed
structures
most
of
them
homes
and
forced
the
evacuation
of
around
residents
as
more
fissures
open
and
toxic
gas
exposure
increases
the
potential
of
a
larger
scale
evacuation
increases
ige
said
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
evening
a
mass
evacuation
of
the
lower
puna
district
would
be
beyond
current
county
and
state
capabilities
and
would
quickly
overwhelm
our
collective
resources
ige
tweeted
saying
in
a
separate
post
that
he
signed
a
request
for
federal
disaster
assistance
the
lower
part
of
the
puna
district
of
which
leilani
gardens
is
a
part
covers
dozens
of
square
miles
and
is
home
to
many
thousands
of
residents
it
has
the
highest
possible
hazard
risks
for
lava
flows
according
to
the
geological
survey
exposure
to
very
high
levels
of
the
sulfur
dioxide
gas
emitted
from
the
fissures
can
be
experts
say
geologists
warned
on
wednesday
that
kilauea
may
be
entering
a
more
violent
phase
of
explosive
eruptions
the
likes
of
which
hawaii
has
not
seen
in
nearly
a
century
explosive
eruptions
could
hurl
ballistic
blocks
weighing
several
tons
upwards
of
half
a
mile
and
dust
towns
as
far
away
as
hilo
some
miles
km
distant

volcanic
ash
and
smog
hawaii
volcanoes
national
park
where
kilauea
is
located
said
on
wednesday
it
would
close
most
of
the
park
on
friday
due
to
the
threat
of
a
possible
explosive
eruption
magma
is
draining
out
of
the
volcano
s
sinking
lava
pool
and
flowing
underground
tens
of
miles
eastward
before
bursting
to
the
surface
on
kilauea
s
eastern
flank
in
the
lower
puna
area
there
s
still
quite
a
fair
bit
of
magma
under
the
ground
that
s
available
to
erupt

neal
the
scientist
in
charge
of
the
usgs
hawaiian
volcano
observatory
said
in
a
conference
call
adding
that
she
saw
no
end
to
activity
in
the
east
rift
zone
kilauea
has
been
in
a
state
of
nearly
constant
eruption
for
years
it
predominantly
oozes
out
lava
from
fissures
that
flows
into
the
ocean
but
occasionally
experiences
more
explosive
eruptions
