conocophillips
said
on
thursday
it
would
continue
enforcing
legal
actions
against
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
until
it
receives
a
payment
to
satisfy
a
billion
arbitration
award
recently
issued
by
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
icc
the
oil
firm
s
actions
so
far
have
included
the
seizure
of
oil
inventories
and
assets
in
the
caribbean
islands
where
pdvsa
operates
the
measures
have
forced
the
company
to
halt
storage
and
shipping
from
at
least
four
terminals
creating
a
bottleneck
of
tankers
around
its
venezuelan
ports
we
look
forward
to
hearing
pdvsa
s
proposals
to
resolve
this
matter
but
absent
any
agreement
and
payment
of
the
icc
award
we
will
continue
our
enforcement
actions
