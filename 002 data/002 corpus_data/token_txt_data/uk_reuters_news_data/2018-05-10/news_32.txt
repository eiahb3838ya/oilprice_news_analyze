a
year
by

help
developing
nations
cope
with
rising

and

we
can
t

having
slow
progress

poor

delegates
agreed
to
hold
an
extra

in

from
september
before
environment
ministers
meet
in
katowice
poland
in
december
when
the
rule
book
for
the
paris
pact
is
due
to
be
agreed
the
paris
agreement
set
a
sweeping
goal
of
ending
the
fossil
fuel
era
this
century
with
a
shift
towards
cleaner
energies
such
as
wind
or
solar
power
to
help
limit
a
rise
in
temperatures
but
it
was
vague
on
the
details
such
as
how
to
measure
financial
flows
to
developing
nations
and
how
countries
will
report
and
monitor
curbs
on
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
ratchet
up
national
goals
every
five
years
to
limit
global
warming
we
have
to
be
very
very
clear
that
we
have
a
lot
of
work
in
the
months
ahead
and
that
we
have
to
improve
the
pace
of
progress
to
achieve
a
good
outcome

a
news
conference
she
said
progress
had
been
satisfactory
in
bonn
writing
the
rule
book
formally
known
as
implementation
guidelines
is
the
biggest
test
of
the
international
commitment
to
the
paris
agreement
since
president
donald
trump
said
in
june
he
will
pull
out
doubting
that
climate
change
has
a
human
cause
elina
bardram
of
the
european
commission
said
clear
rules
on
curbing
emissions
adapting
to
climate
change
and
finance
were
vital
in
to
bring
the
paris
agreement
to
life
but
she
said
some
elements
were
likely
to
need
more
time
we
have
to
accept
that
not
all
the
nitty
gritty
details
can
be
agreed
by
katowice

how
thick
or
how
thin

an
open

the
moment

will
become
a
little
clearer
