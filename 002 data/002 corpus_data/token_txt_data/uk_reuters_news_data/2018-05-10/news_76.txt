oil
prices
clocked
up
more
highs
on
thursday
as
traders
adjusted
to
the
prospects
of
renewed
sanctions
against
major
crude
exporter
iran
amid
an
already
tightening
market
the
united
states
plans
to
impose
new
sanctions
against
iran
which
produces
around
percent
of
global
oil
supplies
after
abandoning
an
agreement
reached
in
late
which
limited
tehran
s
nuclear
ambitions
in
exchange
for
removing
sanctions
oil
prices
rose
sharply
in
response
to
the
announced
measures
brent

the
international
benchmark
for
oil
prices
hit
their
strongest
since
november
at
per

on
thursday
west

wti
crude

also
marked
a
high
at
a
barrel
and
they
still
stood
at
a
barrel
at
gmt
up
over
half
a
dollar
or
percent
from
their
last
settlement
in
china
which
is
iran
s
single
biggest
buyer

shanghai
crude

posted
their
biggest
rally
since
their
launch
in
march
rising
more
than
percent
to
a
record
of
around
per

goldman
sachs
said
the
planned
unilateral
sanctions
against
iran
would
likely
have
a
high
level
of
efficiency
as
a
result
of
sanctions
and
because
of
risks
to
supplies
elsewhere
especially
in
venezuela
the
bank
said
this
leaves
risk
our
summer
per
barrel
brent
price
forecast
is
squarely
skewed
to
the
upside
analysts
had
little
hope
that
opposition
to
the
action
would
prevent
sanctions
from
going
ahead
europe
and
china
will
not
fight
against
the
sanctions
they
will
grumble
and
accept
it
there
is
no
one
who
will
realistically
choose
iran
over
the
said
energy
consultancy
fge
we
believe
the
previous
million
bpd
limit
for
exports
imposed
during
previous
sanctions
will
be
reimposed
as
before
it
may
take
several
rounds
of
reductions
to
reach
target
levels
fge
s
founder
and
chairman
fereidun
fesharaki
wrote
in
a
note
he
added
that
condensate
a
form
of
crude
oil
that
was
excluded
in
the
last
round
of
sanctions
may
well
be
included
despite
this
fesharaki
said
the
impact
on
the
oil
market
would
be
limited
due
to
a
wind
down
period
as
planned
sanctions
are
implemented
but
the
impact
will
escalate
as
we
approach
november
the
end
of
wind
down
period
oil
prices
will
certainly
move
up
and
per
barrel
prices
may
again
be
on
the
sanctions
come
amid
an
oil
market
that
has
already
been
tightening
due
to
strong
demand
especially
in
asia
and
as
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
top
producer
russia
have
led
efforts
since
to
withhold
oil
supplies
to
prop
up
prices
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
may
to
million
barrels
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
eia
slightly
above
the
million
barrels
average
level
one
factor
that
could
prevent
markets
from
tightening
further
is
soaring
oil
output
weekly
crude
oil
production
hit
another
record
last
week
climbing
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
s
up
percent
since
and
means
output
is
creeping
ever
closer
to
that
of
top
producer
russia
which
pumps
around
million
