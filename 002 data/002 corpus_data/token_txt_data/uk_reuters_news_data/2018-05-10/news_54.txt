morocco
s
only
refinery
will
find
it
tougher
to
find
a
buyer
the
longer
it
stays
closed
as
equipment
ages
and
qualified
staff
move

industry
sources
say
almost
three
years
after
operations
were
halted
due
to
heavy
debts
one
source
said
trustees
had
received
offers
for
the
samir
plant
controlled
by
saudi
billionaire
mohammed
s
corral
holdings
and
shut
by
the
government
in
over
unpaid
taxes
but
he
said
trustees
had
failed
to
agree
terms
with
potential
buyers
of
the
plant
which
has
total
debts
estimated
at
billion
dirhams
billion
the
equivalent
of
about
percent
of
the
north
african
nation
s
gross
domestic
product
the
source
did
not
say
why
terms
were
not
agreed
for
samir
which
was
a
victim
of
the
crash
in
oil
prices
from
their
peaks
that
left
the
plant
struggling
to
service
debts
some
of
which
were
linked
to
crude
loaned
when
prices
were
higher
shuttering
the
plant
which
experts
value
at
billion
dirhams
has
left
morocco
reliant
on
imported
refined
products
and
sparked
protests
by
workers
energy
imports
cost
morocco
billion
dirhams
last
year
the
longer
the
crisis
drags
on
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
for
samir
to
find
a
buyer
said
the
source
who
asked
not
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
subject
he
said
this
was
not
only
due
to
the
piling
up
of
debt
but
also
because
equipment
is
getting
old
and
some
of
the
best
human
resources
are
tired
of
waiting
and
have
sought
other
other
industry
sources
and
parties
interested
in
the
plant
have
previously
said
idling
the
refinery
which
the
government
said
owed
billion
dirhams
in
unpaid
taxes
made
it
more
difficult
to
find
a
buyer
hussain
head
of
oil
and
gas
industries
at
the
cdt
union
said
the
government
should
work
faster
to
sell
the
plant
in
mohammedia
about
km
miles
north
of
casablanca
saying
jobs
at
the
plant
and
in
related
industries
were
at
stake
he
also
said
delays
would
make
a
sale
tougher
some
staff
at
the
refinery
which
had
directly
employed
people
still
show
up
for
work
mainly
to
maintain
the
plant
but
salaries
have
been
slashed
hurting
the
economy
of
the
town
and
prompting
protests
and
over
the
shutdown
we
live
in
acute
uncertainty
said
farid
baroudi
an
employee
whose
wages
were
halved
trustees
first
invited
bids
for
the
refinery
in
february
and
have
extended
the
deadline
for
offers
industry

said
in
may
that
swiss

teamed
up
to
bid
aiming
to
recoup
about
million
in
loans
a
banking
source
familiar
with
the
situation
said
talks
had
not
progressed
while
the
firms
and
trustees
have
not
commented
a
diplomatic
source
said
an
iraqi
oil
ministry
delegation
visited
samir
in

year
local
website
said
opec
member
iraq
might
be
interested
in
the
refinery
to
boost
refined
product
exports
to
europe
and
north
africa
no
further
developments
have
been
reported
most
offers
are
from
parties
whose
capacity
to
relaunch
samir
is
shrouded
in
doubt
said
energy
expert
el
mehdi
fakir
the
complicated
legal
proceedings
and

are
making
it
hard
to
corral
with

the

to
liquidate
samir
yamani
head
of

industries
at
the

the
state
should
nationalise
samir
to
safeguard
thousands
of
jobs
and
save
morocco
s
refining
industry
if
no
sale
was
agreed
he
said
the
shutdown
was
costing
mohammedia
about
billion
dirhams
a
year
as
a
result
of
unpaid
salaries
and
lost
fees
from
services
linked
to
the
plant

said
the

would
ensure
