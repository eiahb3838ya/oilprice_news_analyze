opec in no hurry to decide if extra oil needed to offset iran - sources
reuters
opec
is
in
no
hurry
to
decide
whether
to
pump
more
oil
to
make
up
for
an
expected
drop
in
exports
from
iran
after
the
imposition
of
new
sanctions
four
sources
familiar
with
the
issue
said
saying
any
loss
in
supply
would
take
time
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
a
deal
with
russia
and
producers
to
cut
supplies
that
has
helped
erase
a
global
glut
and
boosted
oil
prices
to
their
highest
since
officials
are
considering
whether
a
drop
in
iranian
exports
and
a
decline
in
supply
from
another
opec
member
venezuela
demands
adjusting
the
deal
that
runs
to
the
end
of
ministers
meet
in
june
to
review
the
policy
sanctions
on
iran
will
have
a
period
during
which
buyers
should
wind
down
oil
purchases
meaning
any
loss
of
supply
will
not
be
immediately
felt
in
the
market
i
think
we
have
days
before
any
supply
impact
an
opec
source
said
when
asked
about
any
plans
for
action
a
second
opec
source
said
that
while
the
need
to
add
extra
supply
was
being
considered
the
safest
thing
for
the
group
to
do
for
now
was
to
sit
tight
and
monitor
the
situation
oil
reached
a
barrel
on
thursday
its
highest
since
november
two
days
after
president
donald
trump
said
the
united
states
was
abandoning
an
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
and
would
impose
new
sanctions
iran
which
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
exports
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
europe
and
around
million
bpd
to
asia
sales
to
europe
are
seen
by
analysts
as
the
more
likely
to
be
reduced
by
the
sanctions
it
s
too
early
to
know
now
the
impact
said
a
third
opec
source
we
need
to
wait
and
see
what
china
will
do
what
japan
will
do
who
will
buy
iranian
oil
and
who
will
side
with
as
part
of
the
supply
deal
opec
pledged
to
cut
million
bpd
from
supplies
from
its
members
in
practice
the
group
has
overshot
this
partly
because
venezuelan
output
has
plunged
due
an
economic
crisis
oil
ministers
from
opec
and
its
partners
meet
on
june
in
vienna
to
review
the
existing
agreement
before
that
technical
officials
meet
in
jeddah
saudi
arabia
on
may
when
the
issue
of
whether
extra
barrels
are
needed
to
offset
any
iranian
loss
will
likely
come
up
the
second
source
said
a
fourth
opec
source
also
said
it
was
too
soon
to
tell
if
extra
oil
was
needed
citing
iran
s
ability
to
keep
much
of
its
exports
flowing
under
a
previous
round
of
sanctions
too
early
to
judge
he
said
on
wednesday
a
separate
opec
source
had
said
saudi
arabia
was
monitoring
the
impact
of
the
move
on
oil
supplies
and
was
ready
to
offset
any
shortage
but
would
not
act
alone
this
source
had
also
said
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iranian
supplies
needed
to
be
assessed
first
and
saudi
arabia
did
not
expect
any
physical
impact
on
the
market
until
the
third
or
fourth
quarters
analysts
also
expect
saudi
arabia
to
be
cautious
and
step
in
only
to
offset
an
actual
supply
loss
not
an
anticipated
one
saudi
will
remain
reactive
and
not
forward
fundamentals
if
a
supply
dislocation
emerges
and
inventories
get
abnormally
low
then
opec
and
russia
may
act
