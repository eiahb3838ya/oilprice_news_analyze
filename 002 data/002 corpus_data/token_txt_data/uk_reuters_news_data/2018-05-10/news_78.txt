wrapup 8-europeans work to save iran deal, and business, after trump pulls out
reuters
dismayed
european
allies
sought
on
wednesday
to
salvage
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
preserve
their
iranian
trade
after
president
donald
trump
withdrew
the
united
states
from
the
landmark
accord
and
ordered
sanctions
reimposed
on
tehran
the
deal
is
not
dead
there
s
an
american
withdrawal
from
the
deal
but
the
deal
is
still
there
french
foreign
minister
le
drian
said
but
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
a
pragmatist
who
helped
engineer
the
deal
to
ease
iran
s
economically
crippling
isolation
told
french
counterpart
emmanuel
macron
in
a
phone
call
that
europe
had
only
a
limited
opportunity
to
preserve
the
pact
the
iranian
students
news
agency
reported
europe
must
as
quickly
as
possible
clarify
its
position
and
specify
and
announce
its
intentions
with
regard
to
its
obligations
isna
quoted
rouhani
as
telling
macron
macron
who
like
other
european
leaders
had
lobbied
trump
to
keep
the
agreement
that
was
struck
before
the
republican
president
took
office
in
january
urged
rouhani
to
adhere
to
the
deal
and
to
consider
broader
negotiations
trump
said
on
tuesday
he
would
revive
economic
sanctions
which
would
penalize
foreign
firms
doing
business
with
tehran
to
undermine
what
he
called
a
horrible
deal
that
should
have
never
ever
been
made
on
wednesday
he
said
iran
would
now
either
negotiate
or
something
will
it
was
not
immediately
clear
what
actions
he
was
suggesting
would
take
place
the
white
house
said
later
that
trump
was
preparing
to
impose
new
sanctions
on
iran
perhaps
as
early
as
next
week
but
gave
no
details
iran
has
drafted
a
proportional
plan
to
cope
with
the
withdrawal
the
official
news
agency
irna
quoted
government
spokesman
mohammad
baqer
nobakht
as
saying
he
said
without
elaborating
that
budgets
had
been
drawn
up
to
handle
various
scenarios
the
fruit
of
more
than
a
decade
of
diplomacy
the
nuclear
agreement
was
clinched
in
july
by
the
united
states
france
britain
germany
russia
china
and
iran
it
was
designed
to
prevent
iran
developing
a
nuclear
bomb
in
return
for
the
removal
of
sanctions
that
had
crippled
its
economy
not
least
by
washington
threatening
to
penalize
businesses
anywhere
in
the
world
that
traded
with
iran
trump
complained
that
the
deal
the
signature
foreign
policy
achievement
of
his
democratic
predecessor
barack
obama
did
not
address
iran
s
ballistic
missile
program
its
nuclear
activities
beyond
or
its
role
in
conflicts
in
yemen
and
syria
his
decision
raises
the
risk
of
deepening
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
puts
the
united
states
at
odds
with
european
diplomatic
and
business
interests
and
casts
uncertainty
over
global
oil
supplies
oil
prices
rose
more
than
percent
with
brent
touching
a
high
in
the
latest
violence
iranian
forces
on
the
side
of
the
golan
heights
shelled
israeli
army
outposts
on
the
strategic
plateau
but
caused
no
casualties
an
israeli
military
spokesman
said
saying
israel
had
retaliated
syrian
air
defences
confronted
israeli
rockets
on
syrian
territory
without
specifying
the
location
syrian
state
media
reported
quoting
a
military
source
the
pullout
could
strengthen
hardliners
in
iranian
politics
at
the
expense
of
moderates
like
rouhani
who
had
pinned
their
hopes
on
the
deal
to
boost
living
standards
in
iran
with
limited
success
so
far
iranian
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
a
hardliner
said
mr
trump
i
tell
you
on
behalf
of
the
iranian
people
you
ve
made
a
mistake
i
said
many
times
from
the
first
day
don
t
trust
le
drian
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
and
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
iaea
all
said
iran
was
honouring
its
commitments
under
the
accord
the
region
deserves
better
than
further
destabilisation
provoked
by
american
withdrawal
le
drian
said
later
on
wednesday
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
sought
to
allay
concerns
that
washington
had
alienated
itself
from
close
allies
with
trump
s
decision
the
president
could
not
affirm
as
required
that
this
agreement
was
being
lived
up
to
mattis
told
a
senate
hearing
we
now
have
the
opportunity
to
move
forward
to
address
those
shortcomings
and
make
it
more
the
european
union
said
it
would
ensure
sanctions
on
iran
remain
lifted
as
long
as
tehran
meets
its
commitments
the
kremlin
said
russian
president
vladimir
putin
was
deeply
concerned
by
the
withdrawal
the
ria
news
agency
said
merkel
said
that
while
the
existing
deal
should
not
be
called
into
question
there
should
be
discussion
of
a
broader
deal
that
goes
beyond
it
british
foreign
secretary
boris
johnson
spoke
of
a
agreement
but
said
it
was
up
to
washington
to
come
up
with
concrete
proposals
macron
said
he
wanted
a
broader
discussion
with
all
relevant
parties
on
the
development
of
iran
s
nuclear
programme
after
when
key
elements
of
the
current
deal
start
to
expire
as
well
as
iran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
and
wider
middle
east
issues
iranian
officials
will
next
week
meet
counterparts
from
france
britain
and
germany
khamenei
appeared
sceptical
whether
they
could
deliver
i
don
t
trust
these
three
the
chances
of
saving
the
deal
without
washington
depend
largely
on
whether
international
firms
are
willing
and
able
to
keep
trading
with
iran
despite
the
threat
of
sanctions
in
a
sign
of
what
may
be
in
store
trump
s
ambassador
to
berlin
tweeted
within
hours
of
taking
up
his
post
that
german
businesses
should
halt
activities
in
iran
at
once
french
finance
minister
bruno
le
maire
said
the
united
states
should
not
consider
itself
the
world
s
economic
policeman
britain
france
and
germany
said
they
would
do
all
they
could
to
protect
their
business
interests
in
iran
yet
it
was
unclear
how
much
they
can
shield
firms
from
sanctions
brussels
has
a
blocking
statute
at
its
disposal
that
bans
any
eu
company
from
complying
with
sanctions
and
does
not
recognise
any
court
rulings
that
enforce
american
penalties
but
the
statute
has
never
been
used
and
is
seen
by
european
governments
more
as
a
political
weapon
than
a
regulation
because
its
rules
are
vague
and
difficult
to
enforce
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
spokesman
made
the
limits
of
potential
action
clear
uk
businesses
may
wish
to
consider
the
implications
for
their
business
activities
in
iran
and
where
necessary
seek
appropriate
legal
european
companies
including
carmaker
psa
plane
manufacturer
airbus
and
engineering
group
siemens
all
said
they
were
watching
the
situation
a
senior
french
diplomat
said
businesses
would
ultimately
be
forced
to
choose
between
their
iranian
economic
interests
and
their
potential
interests
adding
generally
that
decision
is
quickly
made
in
favour
of
the
hardliner
lawmakers
in
iran
s
parliament
burned
a
flag
and
a
symbolic
copy
of
the
deal
known
officially
as
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
jcpoa
chanting
death
to
america
rouhani
who
could
be
weakened
by
a
blow
to
iran
s
economy
struck
a
more
conciliatory
tone
in
a
televised
speech
saying
iran
would
negotiate
with
eu
countries
china
and
russia
if
at
the
end
of
this
short
period
we
conclude
that
we
can
fully
benefit
from
the
jcpoa
with
the
cooperation
of
all
countries
the
deal
will
remain
he
said
the
trump
administration
kept
the
door
open
to
negotiating
another
deal
but
it
is
far
from
clear
whether
the
europeans
would
pursue
that
option
or
be
able
to
win
iran
over
abandoning
the
pact
was
one
of
the
most
consequential
decisions
of
trump
s
america
first
policy
which
has
led
him
to
quit
the
global
paris
climate
accord
come
close
to
a
trade
war
with
china
and
pull
out
of
an
trade
deal
iran
denies
western
suspicions
that
it
tried
in
the
past
to
develop
atomic
weapons
and
says
its
nuclear
energy
program
has
been
for
peaceful
purposes
senior
officials
themselves
have
said
several
times
that
iran
is
in
technical
compliance
with
the
nuclear
pact
renewing
sanctions
would
make
it
much
harder
for
iran
to
sell
its
oil
abroad
or
use
the
international
banking
system
iran
is
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
s
member
pumping
about
million
barrels
per
day
of
crude
or
just
under
percent
of
global
supply
china
india
japan
and
south
korea
buy
most
of
its
million
bpd
of
exports
iran
s
rial
currency
plunged
to
a
record
low
against
the
dollar
in
the
free
market
after
sliding
for
months
because
of
a
weak
economy
financial
difficulties
at
local
banks
and
heavy
demand
for
dollars
among
iranians
who
feared
that
renewed
sanctions
would
hit
iranian
exports
hard
among
the
few
nations
to
welcome
trump

decision
were
