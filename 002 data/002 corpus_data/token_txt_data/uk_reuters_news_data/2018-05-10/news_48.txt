analysis-trump's iran decision puts iraq leaders to the test
baghdad
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
has
cast
a
shadow
over
an
already
fraught
election
in
iraq
where
tehran
and
washington
have
vied
for
influence
since
the
invasion
toppled
saddam
hussein
in
the
removal
of
a
sunni
dictatorship
cleared
the
path
for
the
country
s
shi
ite
majority
from
which
the
three
top
contenders
for
the
premiership
including
incumbent
haider
are
drawn
the
outcome
of
the
may
ballot
is
too
close
to
call
whoever
wins
must
balance
iraq
s
interests
and
the
need
to
reduce
the
struggling
economy
s
dependence
on
oil
with
those
of
the
united
states
and
iran
whose
intensifying
rivalry
makes
that
more
difficult
abadi
and
his
main
rivals
predecessor
nuri
and
new
challenger
hadi
a
hardline
militia
commander
at
the
head
of
a
powerful
paramilitary
coalition
aligned
with
iran
tilt
heavily
towards
tehran
with
trump
increasing
pressure
on
iran
its
shi
ite
clerical
leadership
will
be
even
more
determined
to
maintain
its
patronage
in
iraq
for
iran
iraq
is
the
most
important
arab
state
even
more
than
syria
and
lebanon
where
it
also
holds
political
and
military
sway
that
is
because
iran
and
iraq
share
a
border
and
iraq
is
positioned
in
the
heart
of
the
gulf
region
iraq
is
also
iran
s
main
route
for
supplying
arms
and
fighters
to
syria
where
it
has
deployed
with
allied
iraqi
and
lebanese
shi
ite
militias
to
back
president
bashar
in
the
civil
war
one
concern
for
iraq
is
the
risk
of
clashes
between
the
troops
there
and
shi
ite
paramilitaries
notionally
under
baghdad
s
command
but
answering
to
iran
s
revolutionary
guards
and
to
supreme
leader
ayatollah
ali
khamenei
the
iraqis
are
very
worried
they
don
t
want
iraq
to
become
a
new
theatre
of
war
between
iran
and
the
united
states
said
one
senior
western
envoy
if
there
is
a
war
between
iran
and
the
united
states
part
of
it
will
be
the
and
iran
had
found
a
common
enemy
in
islamic
state
which
at
one
point
held
about
a
third
of
iraq
mainly
in
the
north
and
the
west
its
rapid
advance
owed
much
to
the
collapse
of
iraq
s
army
hollowed
out
by
the
sectarian
policies
of
the
maliki
government
many
iraqis
attribute
the
jihadis
subsequent
defeat
to
men
like
amiri
and
the
militias
rather
than
to
coalition
forces
america
mainly
provided
air
power
while
relying
on
kurdish
fighters
on
the
ground
in
both
syria
and
iraq
but
while
iran
sees
iraq
as
the
most
strategically
important
arab
state
some
experts
believe
tehran
will
focus
more
on
israel
and
the
syrian
battlefield
the
conflict
there
threatens
to
draw
in
israel
only
hours
after
trump
s
announcement
on
the
iran
nuclear
deal
it
launched
air
strikes
against
what
it
says
were
iranian
and
hezbollah
assets
creeping
closer
to
israel
s
borders
iranian
forces
in
syria
shelled
israeli
army
outposts
across
the
syrian
frontier
overnight
israel
said
prompting
one
of
the
heaviest
israeli
strikes
in
syria
since
the
war
began
in
iraq
s
foreign
ministry
called
trump
s
decision
hasty
and
rash
and
said
washington
s
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
accord
goes
in
the
direction
of
escalation
which
would
bring
nothing
but
destruction
and
the
desolation
of
war
in
the
middle
east
in
the
scenario
diplomats
in
the
region
said
iran
would
target
interests
in
iraq
as
their
militias
did
in
by
firing
rockets
into
the
embassy
in
baghdad
but
iran
might
prefer
to
steer
clear
of
iraq
and
use
syria
instead
iraq
s
shi
ite
leaders
nonetheless
face
a
dilemma
about
how
to
balance
policy
between
the
united
states
and
iran
some
iraqi
leaders
among
them
abadi
say
they
want
to
steer
clear
of
rivalries
they
would
want
to
follow
the
model
of
policies
friends
of
all
said
another
western
diplomat
others
including
amiri
believe
that
iraq
s
single
most
important
relationship
is
with
iran
and
that
they
have
to
reinforce
that
relationship
also
important
to
iraq
is
building
bridges
with
the
minority
sunni
community
although
some
politicians
are
wary
of
abadi
s
tentative
rapprochement
with
sunni
saudi
arabia
nurtured
after
decades
of
estrangement
their
greatest
nightmare
is
to
wake
up
and
have
the
sunnis
or
arabs
undermine
their
ascendancy
and
dominance
in
the
system
as
happened
with
daesh
said
the
second
western
diplomat
referring
to
islamic
state
s
advances
in
they
are
reminded
that
iran
will
be
their
ultimate
resort
when
that
nightmare
happens
when
the
islamic
state
caliphate
was
declared
they
the
iranians
were
the
first
to
come
to
their
rescue
not
the
or
anybody
iraq
s
shi
ites
do
not
want
to
be
dominated
by
iran
but
trump
s
move
this
week
against
tehran
may
make
that
harder
after
trump
s
decision
the
question
is
how
do
you
implement
a
balanced
policy
when
iran
will
use
iraq
s
airspace
to
arm
its
militias
in
syria
what
will
they
do
said
the
diplomat
powerful
militias
trained
funded
and
armed
by
iran
and
led
by
amiri
might
answer
to
tehran
rather
than
baghdad
iran
s
islamic
revolutionary
guard
corps
has
built
shi
ite
militias
at
the
heart
of
the
popular
mobilisation
forces
pmf
into
a
structure
to
rival
the
iraqi
army
and
security
forces
it
did
something
similar
within
lebanon
s
shi
ite
hezbollah
movement
which
has
helped
tehran
project
military
strength
across
the
region
