world
stocks
hit
a
high
on
thursday
and
turned
positive
for
the
year
as
rising
oil
prices
gave
energy
firms
a
shot
in
the
arm
that
countered
the
effects
of
increased
political
uncertainty

it
s
difficult
to
know
what
the
principal
drivers

given
there

a
whole

of
events

it
could
well
be
that
the
effect
of
oil
prices
on
resources
companies
is
outweighing
negatives
elsewhere
said
investec
economist
philip
shaw
but
i
think
the
main
thing
the
market
is
looking
out
for
is
whether
growth
in
the
global
economy
has
peaked
and
is
slowing
down
he
said
citing
reduced
growth
data
in
the
euro
