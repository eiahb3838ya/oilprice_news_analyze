german
foreign

heiko
maas
said
it
was
crucial

sticks
to
its
obligations
under
the
international
deal
despite
trump
promising
to
impose
new
sanctions
on
tehran
moscow
he
said
could
use
its
influence
on
tehran
to
that
end
it
is
necessary
that
iran
stays
in
the

it
is
in
iran
s
interest
too
to
keep
the
agreement
alive

out

deeply
flawed
a
stance
at
odds
with
major
allies
and
russia
and
china
under
the

reached
before

what
does
it
mean
for
a
european
company
s
america
business
if
it
continues
to
do
business

any
new
sanctions
on
iran
did
not
scuttle
the
deal
officially
known
as
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
without
doubt
we
will
make
sure
firstly
that
this
does
not
destroy
the
jcpoa

is
our
common
objective

confirmed
this
lavrov
