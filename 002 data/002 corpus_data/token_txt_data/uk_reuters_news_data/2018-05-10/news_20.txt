india
has
scrapped
a
duty
on
solar
modules
making
it
easier
to
import
the
products
after
a
sudden
change
in
customs
policy
last
year
led
to
a
logjam
of
shipments
at
indian
ports
several
consignments
of
solar
modules
worth
more
than
million
in
total
were
held
up
for
more
than
three
months
at
ports
after
indian
customs
officials
in
august
demanded
that
some
of
them
be
classified
as
electric
motors
and
generators
carrying
a
percent
import
duty
previously
they
were
subject
to
no
duty
the
finance
ministry
reversed
the
policy
last
month
stating
in
a
notice
seen
by
reuters
that
most
solar
modules
should
revert
to
their
original
classification
and
that
no
tax
should
be
levied
on
them
indian
component
makers
have
struggled
to
compete
with
chinese
companies
such
as
trina
solar
and
yingli
and
have
sought
duties
as
well
as
safeguards
but
the
logjam
of
shipments
at
ports
posed
a
headache
for
solar
power
producers
and
threatened
to
delay
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
plan
of
nearly
tripling
the
country
s
total
renewable
energy
capacity
to
gigawatt
gw
by
the
plan
has
spurred
foreign
investment
in
the
sector
with
japan
s
softbank
and
goldman
sachs
among
others
investing
in
solar
projects
in
india
any
duty
is
bad
news
for
solar
power
producers
such
as
sb
energy
but
good
for
local
solar
component
makers
such
as
indosolar
and
moser
baer
the
change
in
policy
last
august
led
to
logjams
as
it
was
not
immediately
clear
which
modules
belonged
to
the
new
classification
to
ease
the
situation
customs
officials
agreed
to
release
shipments
if
importers
paid
a
bank
guarantee
to
cover
any
duty
they
may
be
required
to
pay
an
executive
at
the
indian
unit
of
germany
s
enerparc
which
had
of
its
containers
stuck
at
the
port
of
chennai
said
there
was
still
some
uncertainty
about
the
process
even
though
the
duty
had
been
scrapped
looks
like
it
will
take
a
month
before
we
get
our
money
bank
guarantees
back
but
we
are
happy
that
the
issue
has
been
resolved
enerparc
s
managing
director
santosh
khatelsal
said
customs
officials
were
not
available
for
comment
outside
of
regular
business
hours
