prices
in

concerns
the
federal
reserve
might
raise
interest
rates
more
than
expected
this
year
the
labor
department
said
its
consumer
price
index
rose
percent
last
month
less
than

inflation
is
going
to
rise
in
terms
over
the
summer
but
the
rise
remains
moderate
rather
than
sharp
said
eric
winograd
senior
economist
at
alliancebernstein
lp
the
soft
read
on
inflation
should
give
the
fed
comfort
that
their
gradual
approach
to
raising
rates
is
the
correct
one
and
ease
market
concerns
he
said
i
view
today
s
number
as
a
slight
positive
for
risk
assets
in
the
near
term
winograd
said
however
the
underlying
inflation
gauge
released
by
staff
at
the
new
york
fed
later
in
the
session
showed
inflation
at
percent
in
april
we
did
have
a
miss
on
cpi
for
this
particular
month
but
i
don
t
think
the
overall
trend
for
higher
inflation
has
materially
changed

hard
for
me
to
