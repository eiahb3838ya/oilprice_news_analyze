on
its
existing
stake
before
it
bought
more
three
sources
familiar
with
the
deal
said
qatar
s
request
was
one
of
the
triggers
which
prompted
igor
sechin
rosneft
s
boss
and
a
close
ally
of
president
vladimir
putin
to
propose
last
week
a
billion
share
buyback
and
an
billion
debt
reduction
marking
a
significant
shift
in
the

strategy
days

fund
qatar
investment
authority
one
of
the

largest
raised
its
stake
in
rosneft
to
just

bringing

total
investment
to

euros
the
pledge
to
reduce

and
embark
on
a
buyback
was
taken
by
rosneft

directors
as
part
of
preparations
for
qatar
s
investment
one
of
the
three
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
said
rosneft
and
the
qia
declined
to
comment
rosneft
s
shift
to
focus
on
shareholder
returns
and
debt
reduction
is
its
biggest
in
years
after
a
decade
of
expansion
which
turned
the
group
into
russia
s
most
indebted
company
with
borrowings
of
more
than
billion
as
of
the
end
of
this
has
had
an
impact
in
terms
of
rosneft
s
valuation
versus
its
rivals
rosneft
s
market
value
is
currently
around
billion
while
its
production
is
at
more

equivalent
per

biggest
oil
company
by
market
value
has
a
market
cap
of
billion
while
producing
less
than
million
boe
investors
say
this
partly
reflects
the
impact
of
rosneft
s
heavy
debts
rosneft
is
just
plain
cheap
look
at
where
it
value
stands
versus
peers
and
compare
it
with
its
production
one
of
the
sources
involved
in
negotiation

reuters
asking
not
to
be
named
as
the
matter
is
not
public
