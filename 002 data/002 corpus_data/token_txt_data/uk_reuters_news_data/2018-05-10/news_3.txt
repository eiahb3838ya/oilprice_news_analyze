the

disruption
to

iran
in
the

of

the

with

bank
of
america
said
due
to
the
ongoing
collapse
of
venezuelan
output
and
risks
to
iranian
crude
exports
the

also
lifted
its
average
brent
forecast
to

and
in
oil
prices
are
on
track
for
their
fourth
consecutive
quarterly
gain
the
longest
such
stretch
for
more
than
years
boosted
largely
in
the
past
month
by
fears
of
disruption
in
supplies
from
iran
which
pumps
about
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
and
exports
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
europe
and
around
million
bpd
to

are
seen
by

as
the

likely
to
be
reduced
by
the
sanctions
analysts
had
little
hope
that
opposition
to
the
action
would
prevent
sanctions
from
going
ahead
european
allies
have
said
they
remain
committed
to
maintaining
the
nuclear
deal
with
german
chancellor
merkel
reiterating
her
support
of
the
accord
thursday
europe
and
china
will
not
fight
against
the
sanctions
they
will
grumble
and
accept
it
there
is
no
one
who
will
realistically
choose
iran
over
the

consultancy
fge
we
believe
the
previous
limit
for
exports
imposed
during
previous
sanctions
will
be
reimposed
as
before
it
may
take
several
rounds
of
reductions
to
reach
target
levels
fge
s
founder
and
chairman
fereidun
fesharaki
wrote
in
a
note
even
without
disruption
to
iran
s
crude
flows
the
balance
between
supply
and
demand
in
the
oil
market
has
been
tightening
steadily
especially
in
asia
with
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
and
producer
russia
having
led
efforts
since
to
cap
output
to
prop
up
prices
saudi
arabia
is
ready
to
offset
any
supply
shortage
but
it
will
not
act
alone
to
fill
the
gap
an
opec
source
familiar
with
the
kingdom
s
oil
thinking
said
on
wednesday
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
however
is
in
no
hurry
to
decide
whether
to
pump
more
oil
to
make
up
for
an
expected
drop
in
exports
from
iran
four
sources
familiar
with
the
issue
said
saying
any
loss
in
supply
would
take
time
what
the
full
impact
on
iranian
flows
will
be
is
still
difficult
to
estimate
said
petromatrix
strategist
olivier
jakob
one
thing
that
has
changed
and
which
i
think
is
clearly
a
new
development
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
white
house
administration
has
really
pushed
saudi
arabia
to
do
something
about
price
and
to
put
supply
back
into
the
market
to
make
sure
prices
do
not
run
up
before
when
sanctions
were
last
in
place
saudi
arabia
was
driving
its
own
oil
one
factor
that
could
partially
mitigate
any
shortfall
from
iran
is
soaring
oil
output
the
eia
on
tuesday
raised
its
forecast
for
output
in
its
monthly
report
to
million
bpd
late
next
year
the
agency
has
raised
its
forecasts
every
month
since
last
august
this
would
make
the
united
states
the
world
s
largest
producer
ahead
of
both
russia
and
saudi
arabia
