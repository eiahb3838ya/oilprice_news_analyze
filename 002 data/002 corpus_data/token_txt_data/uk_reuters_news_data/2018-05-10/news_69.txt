exclusive-pge picks baltic wind over nuclear as poland embraces green power
reuters
pge
has
abandoned
its
leading
role
in
plans
to
build
poland
s
first
nuclear
power
station
as
it
focuses
on
new
wind
farms
in
the
baltic
sea
two
sources
said
two
other
sources
said
refiner
pkn
orlen
could
take
on
pge
s
role
pge
the
largest
polish
power
group
announced
a
nearly
billion
offshore
wind
project
in
march
but
has
also
been
responsible
for
the
nuclear
project
both
plans
are
part
of
a
major
change
in
polish
policy
coal
mining
provides
around
percent
of
its
energy
and
thousands
of
jobs
but
makes
it
one
of
europe
s
biggest
polluters
the
government
promised
to
defend
coal
from
competition
but
has
been
forced
to
look
for
alternatives
to
fill
an
electricity
shortfall
and
to
meet
european
union
emissions
targets
one
source
said
pge
could
not
fund
both
projects
and
cheap
technology
had
swung
the
decision
in
favour
of
wind
pge
could
still
play
a
smaller
role
in
the
nuclear
project
which
has
been
delayed
and
still
needs
government
approval
pge
can
not
afford
both
offshore
wind
and
nuclear
the
decision
was
taken
to
go
for
offshore
the
source
said
a
government
source
also
said
that
pge
would
focus
on
offshore
a
spokesmen
for
pge
declined
to
comment
for
a
graphic
on
change
in
market
value
of
polenergia
and
pge
click
asked
whether
it
could
take
the
project
on
pkn
orlen
s
press
office
said
in
an
emailed
statement
that
the
company
continuously
analyses
a
number
of
different
projects
that
could
be
part
of
the
development
plans
of
the
poland
s
ruling
conservative
law
and
justice
pis
party
promised
before
elections
in
to
defend
the
coal
industry
and
put
in
place
laws
to
prevent
new
investment
in
both
onshore
and
offshore
windfarms
but
in
march
it
changed
tack
and
proposed
a
law
to
make
it
easier
to
build
wind
turbines
that
is
currently
being
debated
in
parliament
if
the
law
is
passed
as
expected
several
other
wind
farm
projects
could
also
proceed
polenergia
owned
by
the
kulczyk
family
has
said
it
would
like
to
build
a
wind
farm
in
the
baltic
by
pkn
orlen
is
also
considering
building
one
pge
said
in
march
that
it
wants
to
build
offshore
windfarms
with
a
capacity
of
gigawatts
gw
by
pge
did
not
say
how
this
would
be
financed
the
state
owns
pct
and
there
are
over
a
hundred
other
small
shareholders
according
to
thomson
reuters
eikon
data
the
group
s
cash
amounted
to
billion
zlotys
million
at
the
end
of
it
could
issue
more
bonds
as
part
of
its
billion
euros
and
billion
zlotys
bond
programs
analysts
and
investors
say
that
offshore
wind
farms
are
the
easiest
and
fastest
way
for
poland
to
fill
the
expected
capacity
gap
from
coal
and
reduce
emissions
in
line
with
eu
s
targets
as
poland
seeks
improved
ties
with
brussels
they
provide
more
electricity
than
onshore
windfarms
which
poland
already
has
and
can
be
built
more
quickly
than
a
nuclear
power
plant
the
decision
to
open
up
the
offshore
power
industry
could
also
draw
in
investors
statoil
said
in
april
it
would
join
polenergia
s
offshore
project
which
has
drawn
interest
from
other
international
wind
companies
we
received
phone
calls
from
all
over
europe
after
statoil
s
decision
was
announced
if
such
a
player
has
entered
we
need
to
be
in
too
many
investors
say
said
maciej
stryjecki
the
president
of
the
board
at
smdi
advisory
group
some
investors
will
also
be
waiting
to
see
if
poland
offers
subsidies
in
cash
or
payments
for
getting
connected
to
the
grid
even
if
we
take
into
account
the
very
positive
trend
in
the
decline
in
offshore
technology
costs
offshore
wind
farms
will
not
be
built
without
support
said
michal
michalski
polenergia
management
board
member
the
government
s
official
position
on
this
is
not
clear
officials
in
the
energy
ministry
were
not
available
to
comment
the
pis
minister
responsible
for
poland
s
power
and
gas
infrastructure
who
reports
directly
to
the
prime
minister
said
companies
should
not
need
such
incentives
we
expect
that
offshore
windfarms
will
be
built
without
support
but
the
falling
cost
trend
is
very
encouraging
piotr
naimski
told
reuters
he
has
been
a
strong
advocate
of
coal
but
said
offshore
would
be
a
part
of
poland
s
energy
mix
in
reducing
the
dependence
on
coal
is
an
emotional
issue
in
poland
the
coal
industry
still
employs
people
and
some
are
worried
the
shift
in
strategy
could
lead
to
job
cuts
i
do
not
believe
that
offshore
wind
can
be
profitable
said
jaroslaw
grzesik
the
head
of
one
of
the
biggest
trade
unions
in
polish
coal
industry
we
are
definitely
against
but
other
industries
could
benefit
from
the
development
of
offshore
power
the
polish
wind
energy
association
pwea
estimates
that
offshore
windfarms
with
a
total
capacity
of
gw
would
help
create
around
new
jobs
and
add
around
billion
zlotys
to
economic
growth
local
authorities
in
the
windy
baltic
resort
and
port
of
leba
which
is
close
to
the
future
offshore
sites
are
hoping
the
industry
could
provide
employment
as
a
balance
to
seasonal
jobs
if
investors
choose
leba
a
base
and
functional
and
technical
facilities
for
wind
farms
could
be
created
here
the
mayor
of
leba
andrzej
strzechminski
said
pwea
has
identified
around
potential
polish
suppliers
to
the
offshore
industry
including
shipyards
crist
sa
and
gsg
towers
their
workers
skills
can
be
transferred
to
make
windmill
components
gsg
towers
a
unit
of
gdansk
shipyard
group
is
looking
forward
to
poland
s
first
offshore
windmills
and
contracts
with
new
clients
we
are
not
talking
anymore
about
whether
poland
needs
to
develop
offshore
wind
projects
there
are
no
more
question
marks
and
we
only
talk
about
when
and
how
to
do
it
right
said
liudmyla
buimister
who
was
the
ceo
of
gsg
towers
a
unit
of
gdansk
shipyard
group
until
april
it
has
approached
pge
and
polenergia
about
building
a
device
to
send
electricity
generated
at
sea
to
the
onshore
grid
