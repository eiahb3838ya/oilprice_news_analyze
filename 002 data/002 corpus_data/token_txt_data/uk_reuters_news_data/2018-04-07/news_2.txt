s
trillion
sovereign
wealth
fund
should
be
allowed
to
invest
in
unlisted
renewable
projects
such
as
solar
parks
and
wind
farms
the
ruling
conservative
party
voted
on
saturday
the
world
s
largest
sovereign
wealth
fund
which
invests
norway
s
oil
and
gas
revenues
in
stocks
bonds
and
real
estate
has
for
many
years
sought
permission
to
invest
in
unlisted
infrastructure
assets
let
the
fund
invest
in
unlisted
infrastructure
for
renewable
energy
with
the
same
demand
for
profitability
as
for
other
investments
said
the
motion
the
decision
strengthens
the
possibility
the
fund
could
invest
in
the
new
asset
class
as
the
conservatives
are
the
leading
party
in
norway
s
minority
coalition
government
the
other
parties
are
the
progress
party
and
the
centrist
liberals
opening
for
infrastructure
gives
the
fund
the
possibility
to
diversify
which
will
be
good
for
the
fund
tina
bru
a
conservative
lawmaker
who
voted
in
favour
told
reuters
in
addition
it
is
a
good
bonus
that
it
will
contribute
towards
a
shift
to
a
society
which
must
happen
globally
if
we
are
to
achieve
climate
bru
said
the
conservatives
had
also
voted
in
favour
of
a
motion
that
said
the
government
should
consider
whether
to
let
the
fund
invest
in
unlisted
infrastructure
and
unlisted
firms
with
the
same
demand
for
transparency
return
and
risk
as
for
other
the
fund
s
management
is
allowed
to
invest
in
unlisted
firms
that
are
imminently
seeking
stock
exchange
listing
it
has
complained
in
the
past
that
it
was
missing
good
opportunities
because
it
could
not
invest
in
them
at
an
earlier
stage
this
move
by
the
ruling
conservatives
will
act
as
a
strong
signal
to
other
investors
and
sovereign
funds
from
london
and

to
tokyo

told

this
prudent
conservative
party
decision
is
a
major
turning
point
which
should
now
pave
the
way
for
the
parliament
to
instruct
the
fund
to
enter
and
profit
from
the
trillion
dollar
unlisted
renewable
infrastructure
market

finance
minister
siv
jensen
will
present
a
white
paper
on
the
fund
on
tuesday
she
has
in
the
past
rejected
the
possibility
to
allow
the
fund
to
invest
in
unlisted
infrastructure
as
a
whole
not
just
for
renewables
citing
political
risk
now
parliament
needs
to
follow
up
i
can
t
see
any
good
reasons
why
the
finance
ministry
should
come
to
a
different
conclusion
