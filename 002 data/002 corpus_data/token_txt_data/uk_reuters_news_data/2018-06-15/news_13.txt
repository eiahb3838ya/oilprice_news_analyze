un aviation agency may include fossil fuels in emissions deal -sources
reuters
the
aviation
agency
is
expected
to
include
fossil
fuels
in
a
landmark
global
agreement
to
limit
aircraft
emissions
a
move
that
could
encourage
airlines
to
purchase
crude
over
more
costly
biojet
fuels
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
countries
at
the
international
civil
aviation
organisation
icao
are
seeking
to
agree
on
rules
that
will
govern
how
the
overall
deal
brokered
by
the
icao
in
will
be
implemented
the
united
states
backed
by
saudi
arabia
and
other
countries
has
proposed
giving
airlines
credit
for
using
crude
oil
as
well
as
aviation
fuels
from
renewable
sources
like
corn
provided
they
meet
the
deal
s
criteria
two
industry
sources
said
europe
will
back
the
proposal
next
week
at
an
icao
meeting
in
montreal
as
long
as
the
fossil
fuels
eligible
under
the
deal
deliver
actual
carbon
savings
two
european
commission
officials
said
separately
icao
experts
would
determine
how
many
emissions
each
fuel
emits
to
avoid
any
confusion
the
emission
levels
of
individual
fuels
need
to
be
very
robust
so
there
is
no
fooling
around
with
what
is
the
actual
performance
of
one
fuel
over
another
one
of
the
officials
said
oil
giant
saudi
arabia
for
example
has
previously
argued
that
the
agreement
should
be
fuel
neutral
whereby
it
does
not
discriminate
between
different
types
of
fuels
because
technological
advances
could
one
day
enable
crude
to
be
produced
with
percent
fewer
emissions
as
the
deal
requires
according
to
a
saudi
presentation
seen
by
reuters
what
they
the
saudis
are
saying
is
don
t
rule
it
out
for
us
said
the
first
industry
source
all
of
the
sources
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
because
talks
on
how
to
implement
the
deal
known
as
the
carbon
offset
and
reduction
scheme
for
international
aviation
corsia
are
private
representatives
from
saudi
arabia
and
the
state
department
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
an
icao
spokesman
declined
to
comment
the
european
commission
sent
a
letter
to
eu
ministers
this
week
reiterating
concerns
that
any
attempts
to
weaken
the
deal
which
will
go
into
effect
in
should
be
strongly
the
agreement
aims
to
cap
airline
emissions
at
levels
and
airlines
would
be
required
to
limit
their
emissions
or
offset
them
by
buying
carbon
credits
from
designated
environmental
projects
around
the
world
airlines
would
receive
credit
toward
lowering
their
emissions
if
they
use
eligible
fuels
haldane
dodd
spokesman
for
the
air
transport
action
group
which
represents
members
of
the
aviation
industry
would
not
take
a
position
on
the
use
of
crudes
but
advocated
strong
sustainability
standards
for
our
europe
hopes
that
airlines
will
still
be
encouraged
to
use
more
costly
biojet
fuels
if
they
deliver
bigger
emissions
savings
but
with
aviation
biofuels
now
only
produced
in
small
quantities
lowering
the
emissions
of
conventional
jet
fuel
may
prove
a
better
option
for
the
environment
said
a
fifth
source
who
works
in
the
aviation
industry
if
we
can
develop
technologies
that
are
going
to
make
fossil
fuels
with
lower
emissions
isn
t
that
a
carbon
savings
