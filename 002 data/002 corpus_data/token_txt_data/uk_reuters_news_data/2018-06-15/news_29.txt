russian state reinsurer shoulders more risk after u.s. sanctions
moscow
reuters
dozens
of
industrial
plants
in
russia
have
turned
to
the
state
s
reinsurance
company
for
cover
after
an
extension
of
sanctions
made
it
difficult
to
get
reinsurance
elsewhere
the
head
of
that
firm
told
reuters
the
russian
national
reinsurance
company
rnrc
has
signed
the
new
contracts
for
dozens
of
industrial
plants
since
new
sanctions
took
effect
in
early
april
to
cover
risks
including
a
halt
in
production
or
shipping
he
said
nikolay
galushin
s
comments
underscore
the
impact
of
fresh
sanctions
on
the
russian
economy
as
it
chokes
off
access
to
regular
reinsurance
a
critical
process
that
backstops
insurance
by
sharing
large
risks
rnrc
was
set
up
chiefly
to
offer
reinsurance
to
firms
barred
from
using
western
providers
on
april
the
treasury
department
imposed
sanctions
against
russian
magnate
oleg
deripaska
and
companies
in
which
he
is
a
large
shareholder
including
the
world
s
aluminum
producer
rusal
in
response
to
what
it
called
malign
activities
by
russia
the
firms
owned
by
billionaire
viktor
vekselberg
were
also
sanctioned
as
the
united
states
responded
to
suspected
russian
meddling
in
the
election
the
insurance
company
which
was
covering
these
risks
asked
the
foreign
market
counterparts
where
these
risks
were
offloaded
are
you
with
us
or
with
the
sanctions
galushin
said
basically
each
single
reinsurer
said
we
ve
pulled
out
we
can
t
do
it
he
said
galushin
did
not
name
any
companies
whose
risks
rnrc
has
taken
since
april
galushin
said
that
previously
such
risks
had
been
almost
entirely
offloaded
in
the
west
we
have
taken
the
risks
of
all
who
had
pulled
out
he
said
relations
between
russia
and
the
west
have
worsened
after
moscow
annexed
the
crimea
peninsula
from
ukraine
since
then
a
wide
range
of
sanctions
on
companies
banks
and
individuals
were
imposed
on
russia
by
the
european
union
the
united
states
and
other
western
nations
washington
suggested
it
might
lift
the
sanctions
against
rusal
and
its
parent
if
deripaska
cuts
his
stake
to
below
percent
and
introduces
independent
board
members
the
firms
are
set
until
to
come
up
with
a
plan
to
meet
requirements
to
escape
sanctions
there
are
a
couple
of
dozen
industrial
plants
which
are
insuring
their
property
potential
losses
from
stoppage
in
production
cargoes
liability
etc
galushin
said
deripaska
s
business
empire
includes
insurer
ingosstrakh
as
well
as
eurosibenergo
the
treasury
gave
deripaska
s
counterparts
until
to
wind
down
business
with
rusal
galushin
said
that
the
reinsurance
liability
limit
on
the
single
event
on
the
new
sanctioned
risks
exceeds
billion
rubles
million
rnrc
s
capital
is
billion
rubles
and
it
also
has
central
bank
guarantee
worth
billion
rubles
he
said
that
the
current
capital
was
enough
to
cover
for
any
potential
payouts
under
the
commercial
contracts
it
has
while
in
an
event
of
a
sanctioned
company
payout
the
central
bank
was
ready
to
provide
more
funds
