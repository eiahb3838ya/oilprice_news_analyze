middle

african
nations
must
prepare
better
for
drought
as
water
shortages
look
set
to
worsen
the
united
nations
said
on
friday
over
the
past
years
droughts
have
become
longer
and
more
frequent
in
the
region
where
fresh
water
resources
are
among
the
world
s
lowest
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
that
will
likely
worsen
due
to
climate
change
it
added
the
region
must
move
away
from
simply
responding
to
the
effects
of
drought
and
instead
implement
robust
plans
that
prepare
for
the
worst
it
said
we
need
to
perceive
and
manage
droughts
differently
and
shift
from
emergency
response
to
more
proactive
policy
and
planning
to
reduce
risks
and
build
greater
resilience

said
in

the

recommended
growing
crops
that
need
less
water
using
more
irrigation
systems

lowering
the
amount
of
livestock
to
prevent
some
villages
in

on
the
edge
of
the
sahara
desert
have
also
been
using
a
fog
collection
project
to
turn
mist
into
water
to
tackle
water
shortages
swelling
populations
and
food
demands
combined
with
even
scarcer
water
and
land
resources
could
lead
to
a
doubling
of
food
prices
and
trigger
civil
unrest
in
some
developing
countries
the
united
nations
has
said
water
scarcity
already
affects
more
than
percent
of
the
world
s
population
according
to
the
s
world
water
development
report
that
number
is
expected
to
rise
due
to
global
warming
with
one
