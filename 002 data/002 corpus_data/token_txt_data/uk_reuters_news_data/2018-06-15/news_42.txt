sour brew: new tax rules take steam out of china's teapot refiners
beijing

china
s
independent
oil
refiners
are
suffering
a
drastic
change
of
fortune
as
new
tax
rules
shrinking
diesel
demand
and
higher
crude
prices
threaten
their
nearly
profit
bonanza
industry
executives
and
analysts
said
nearly
private
refiners
often
called
teapots
which
account
for
a
fifth
of
china
s
almost
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
crude
oil
imports
are
losing
money
and
market
share
several
have
shut
for
maintenance
to
cut
exposure
to
the
market
and
some
teapots
may
have
to
shut
for
good
if
the
conditions
continue
the
gains
in
retail
prices
at
pumps
in
recent
weeks
have
been
completely
wiped
out
by
higher
costs
of
crude
and
a
hefty
consumption
tax

we
expect
much

in

as

arrive
gao
said
asian
refining
margins
have
thinned
as
crude
prices
surged
amid

led
by
the

supply
disruptions
and
looming
sanctions
against
major

iran
but
china

independents
have
also
been
hit
hard
by
new

a
response
to
the
alleged
use
of
illicit

by
many
of
the
teapots

evade

the

plight
throws
into
sharp
relief
the
performances
of
their
state
rivals
including
top
refiners
petrochina
and
sinopec
where
profits
so
far
are
running
at
their
best
in
two
or
more
years
state
refiners
have
to
pay
the
consumption
tax
as
well
but
their
massive
local
marketing
networks
and
control
of
china

fuel
exports
help

the
teapots
influence
and
size
has
grown
significantly
since
they
began
winning
crude
import
licenses
in
last
year
was
a
blockbuster
as
they
churned
out
record
earnings
expanded
into
petrochemicals
and
beefed
up
trading
teams
this
year
in
contrast
has
been
one
of
deepening
trouble
with
several
teapots
shutting
for
maintenance
to
avoid
losses
jincheng
petrochemical
co
launched
a
month
of
maintenance
in
may
at
its
bpd
refinery
after
losing
money
on
rising
crude
prices
since
late
march
said
a
marketing
manager
with
the
refinery
declining
to
be
named
due
to
company
policy
at
an
oil

show
late
last
month
in
dongying
in

to
many
teapots
sales
managers
from

jostling
about

state
refiners

other
teapots
several
including
wudi
xinyue

co
and
fuhai
group
plan
to
keep
product
inventories
low
fearing
that
domestic
oversupply
could
further
dampen
fuel
prices
according
to
interviews
with
sales
managers
at
the
trade
show
we
barely
keep
any
inventory
for
diesel
and
gasoline
there
are
more
uncertainties
in
the
market
with
more
refineries
coming
online
this
year
said
an
executive
with
a
teapot
in
dongying
others
like
the
haike
group
were
retreating
from
the
northeastern
provinces
of
heilongjiang
jilin
and
liaoning
where
last

s
strong

not

state
refiners
have
access
to
a
surging
export
market
and
dominate
china
s
retail
fuel
market
making
it
easier
for
them
to
pass
higher
crude
costs
and
tax
burdens
on
to
consumers
teapots
however
have
to
offer
more
competitive
prices
and
their
margins
are
much
thinner

said
petrochina
and
sinopec
were
paying
for
products
only
at
steep
discounts
to
market
values
and
were
also
reducing
purchases
a
manager
at
kelida
a
major

to
petrochina
said
his
firm
was
now
struggling
to
break
even
compared
with
a

a

last

wholesale
prices
offered
by
petrochina
are
so
cheap
that
we
will
be

sinopec

halted

the

said
they
are
urging
the

to
give

leeway
in

we
urged

to
reconsider
the

otherwise
some
of

are
going
to
fail
