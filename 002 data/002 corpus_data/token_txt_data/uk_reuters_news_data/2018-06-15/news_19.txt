europe
s
largest
intraday
power
market
launched
on
tuesday
to
trade
electricity
between
countries
has
had
a
smooth
start
and
offers
traders
better
access
to
energy
resources
and
volumes
norway
s
statnett
power
grid
told
reuters
the
new
market
called
intraday
or
xbid
came
online
after
years
of
development
and
testing
and
is
a
collaboration
between
a
number
of
power
exchanges
and
transmission
system
operators
across
europe
in
principle
trades
can
be
made
directly
from
portugal
to
norway
if
transmission
capacities
are
available
increasing
the
market
allows
for
more
trading
and
better
access
to
resources
for
doing
that
statnett
s
spokesman
henrik
glette
said
xbid
allows
electricity
trading
between
austria
belgium
denmark
estonia
finland
france
germany
latvia
lithuania
norway
the
netherlands
portugal
spain
and
sweden
and
more
countries
are
due
to
join
it
in
the
first
days
have
shown
positive
results
and
the
system
has
performed
well
this
is
a
major
step
towards
an
integrated
european
power
market
said
glette
the
new
intraday
market
will
not
only
ensure
better
utilisation
of
europe
s
resources
but
will
also
create
a
wider
balancing
mechanism
for
its
members
when
they
need
more
electricity
than
they
have
expected
said
statnett
the
nordpool
power
exchange
received
xbid
s
first
bid
in
denmark
and
the
first
deliveries
were
made
on
wednesday
said
the
exchange
xbid
relies
on
a
common
it
system
and
a
shared
order
book
a
capacity
management
system
and
a
transmission
system
it
allows
the
matching
of
orders
entered
by
market
participants
in
the
different
countries
it
covers
if
capacity
allows
after
its
first
week
project
members
expect
trading
volumes
to
increase
said
power
exchange
nordpool
the
system
is
designed
to
handle
up
to
trades
per
day
and
will
be
developed
to
process
both
more
trades
and
more
products
said
statnett
xbid
is
so
far
backed
by
system
operators
including
statnett
as
well
as
power
exchanges
in
finland
a
country
that
had
struggled
to
agree
with
its
nordic
neighbours
a
new
balancing
market
in
the
