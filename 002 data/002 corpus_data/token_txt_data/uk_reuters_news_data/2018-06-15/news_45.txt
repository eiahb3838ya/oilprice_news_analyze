focus-pipe dream? chevron, woodside vie to shape australia's lng sector
melbourne
reuters
after
spending
a
decade
and
billions
of
dollars
developing
australia
s
vast
gas
reserves
energy
giant
chevron
corp
and
local
firm
woodside
petroleum
are
at
odds
over
the
pace
and
timing
of
the
next
leg
of
expansion
shipments
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
have
become
one
of
australia
s
biggest
exports
and
a
key
source
of
revenue
for
many
energy
majors
so
any
hurdles
in
the
sector
s
development
could
strike
a
substantial
blow
the
issue
comes
down
to
how
quickly
to
build
a
shared
infrastructure
system
that
would
include
a
major
trunk
pipeline
for
transporting
gas
from
mammoth
new
offshore
fields
owned
by
various
companies
in
northwest
australia
woodside
wants
to
take
the
lead
in
such
a
project
pushing
to
build
soon
so
it
can
go
ahead
with
its
billion
scarborough
development
the
only
new
gas
field
in
the
region
that
is
primed
for
a
final
investment
decision
by
but
chevron
would
prefer
to
spend
more
time
planning
and
building
such
a
system
which
it
says
could
be
led
by
it
or
other
companies
i
don
t
think
there
are
any
showstoppers
in
changing
to
a
more
shared
infrastructure
model
chevron

exploration
and
production
president
stephen
green
said
in
a
group
interview
it
s
just
getting
the
alignment
of
all
the
different
parties
that
want
to
participate
in
that
value
chain
and
coming
up
with
the
structure
that
satisfies
each
party
s
firms
with
stakes
in
the
region
s
gas
fields
including
royal
dutch
shell
bp
and
bhp
billiton
will
need
to
decide
which
option
to
pursue
within
the
next
months
to
ensure
untapped
reserves
are
available
ahead
of
a
supply
shortfall
that
some
industry
analysts
see
emerging
from
around
putting
pressure
on
his
peers
woodside
chief
executive
peter
coleman
said
last
month
that
any
rival
would
need
to
negotiate
with
him
by
september
to
get
their
gas
into
an
infrastructure
system
led
by
woodside
they
really
need
to
get
to
us
in
the
third
quarter
and
be
very
serious
about
what
they
re
doing
because
that
window
will
close
he
said
at
an
investor
briefing
chevron
has
not
put
a
cost
estimate
on
its
infrastructure
plan
saying
it
depends
on
how
big
any
trunkline
is
and
how
many
fields
it
connects
to
woodside
has
not
given
an
exact
estimate
of
costs
for
a
shared
project
that
it
would
lead
talk
of
collaboration
is
good
rhetoric
but
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
moving
parts
said
wood
mackenzie
analyst
saul
kavonic
bhp
and
bp
declined
to
comment
shell
declined
to
comment
except
to
reiterate
that
its
australian
head
zoe
yujnovich
has
called
for
greater
cooperation
between
ventures
to
reduce
waste
and
duplication
chevron
and
woodside
are
key
in
australia
s
lng
sector
as
they
operate
the
four
lng
plants
in
western
australia
and
between
them
have
a
total
of
more
than
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
undeveloped
gas
resources
in
the
region

offshore
carnarvon
and

basins

fields
around
woodside
pluto
scarborough
fields
click
until
now
all
of
australia
s
lng
developments
have
been
built
as
megaprojects
with
the
owners
constructing
pipelines
and
lng
plants
dedicated
to
their
own
fields
critics
say
that
has
wasted
huge
amounts
of
money
as
infrastructure
has
been
duplicated
helping
push
total
development
costs
to
an
billion
burnt
by
a
cost
of
billion
in
developing
its
huge
gorgon
project
off
australia
s
northwest
coast
chevron
wants
to
change
strategy
it
s
our
view
that
that
s
not
the
most
cost
efficient
way
to
see
resources
developed
across
a
large
prolific
basin
like
the
carnarvon
said
chevron
s
green
cost
control
is
key
in
a
competitive
industry
in
which
australia
and
qatar
vie
for
position
as
the
world
s
biggest
producers
and
in
which
major
new
output
is
seen
coming
online
in
places
such
as
the
united
states
canada
east
africa
and
southeast
asia
after
years
of
lng
prices
prior
to
when
asian
spot
cargoes
sold
for
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
prices
are
languishing
at
half
of
that
and
the
fate
of
the
biggest
undeveloped
gas
resource
off
western
australia
the
browse
project
where
woodside
is
operator
will
likely
remain
in
limbo
until
a
common
infrastructure
is
built
but
both
coleman
and
green
expect
each
other
s
companies
to
come
around
eventually
i
absolutely
am
confident
we
ll
work
things
out
green
said
noting
that
chevron
and
woodside
have
long
been
partners
in
energy
projects
and
the
possibility
of
chevron
or
woodside
buying
out
additional
stakes
in
the
region
s
gas
fields
and
lng
projects
could
help
align
interests
better
to
speed
up
a
resolution
m
a
can
play
a
key
role
in
helping
to
create
alignment
across
the
joint
ventures
