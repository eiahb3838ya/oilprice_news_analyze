the
battle
for
the
western
yemeni
port
of
hodeidah
could
be
an
important
milestone
in
the
civil
war
but
analysts
say
the
conflict
is
so
complex
that
even
a
decisive
outcome
there
might
not
bring
peace
why
is
yemen
so
divided
yemen
s
internal
splits
have
festered
for
years
north
and
south
yemen
united
into
a
single
state
in
but
separatists
in
the
south
tried
to
secede
from
the
north
in
their
forces
were
swiftly
beaten
and
more
power
and
resources
flowed
to
the
northern
capital
of
sanaa
angering
many
southerners
former
president
ali
abdullah
saleh
had
ruled
north
yemen
since
and
the
unified
state
after
but
he
alienated
many
yemenis
his
relatives
controlled
core
parts
of
the
army
and
economy
and
critics
said
corruption
was
rife
in
the
far
north
some
of
the
zaydi
sect
of
shi
ite
islam
also
chafed
zaydis
had
ruled
northern
yemen
until
the
revolution
but
their
heartland
was
now
impoverished
in
the
late
some
zaydis
formed
the
houthi
group
which
fought
yemen
s
army
and
grew
friendly
with
iran
though
allied
to
saleh
the
muslim
brotherhood
and
other
sunni
islamists
were
also
gaining
strength
particularly
under
general
ali
mohsen
who
built
a
power
base
in
the
army
taking
advantage
of
factional
rivalries
jihadist
fugitives
set
up
al
qaeda
in
the
arabian
peninsula
aqap
one
of
the
group
s
most
powerful
wings
and
began
staging
attacks
how
did
arab
spring
protests
lead
to
war
when
mass
protests
broke
out
in
some
of
saleh
s
former
allies
turned
on
him
the
army
split
between
units
loyal
to
saleh
and
those
who
followed
ahmar
separatists
rallied
in
the
south
the
houthis
seized
more
areas
aqap
attacks
increased
after
a
year
of
crisis
including
a
bombing
that
nearly
killed
saleh
yemen
s
gulf
neighbours
persuaded
him
to
step
down
but
he
stayed
in
yemen
deputy
president
mansour
hadi
was
elected
in
to
a
term
to
oversee
a
democratic
transition
a
national
dialogue
meeting
of
all
yemen
s
opposing
groups
began
hashing
out
a
new
constitution
but
despite
the
dialogue
things
were
falling
apart
hadi
was
widely
seen
as
weak
and
his
administration
corrupt
saleh
s
allies
in
the
army
and
government
undermined
the
transition
aqap
set
up
a
and
hit
sanaa
with
ever
bloodier
bombings
in
the
houthis
seized
sanaa
with
help
from
army
units
loyal
to
saleh
forcing
hadi
to
share
power
when
the
national
dialogue
proposed
a
federal
constitution
both
houthis
and
southern
separatists
rejected
it
for
blunting
their
sway
the
houthis
arrested
hadi
in
early
but
he
escaped
and
fled
to
aden
the
houthis
pursued
him
battling
loyalists
of
the
transitional
government
days
later
saudi
arabia
entered
the
war
on
hadi
s
side
backed
by
a
coalition
of
arab
allies
to
prevent
iran
from
gaining
influence
via
the
houthis
on
its
border
and
to
preserve
the
transition
they
plucked
hadi
from
aden
and
took
him
to
riyadh
notionally
preserving
his
internationally
recognised
government
and
the
democratic
transition
plan
why
was
there
deadlock
for
so
long
the
crisis
was
now
a
war
between
two
unstable
coalitions
the
houthis
and
saleh
were
old
enemies
jointly
ruling
the
populous
highlands
and
red
sea
coast
hadi
had
no
personal
power
base
but
became
a
nominal
figurehead
for
southern
separatists
tribes
in
the
northeast
sunni
islamists
and
army
remnants
loyal
to
ahmar
internal
rivalries
even
emerged
in
the
coalition
set
up
by
saudi
arabia
to
back
hadi
riyadh
and
its
main
ally
the
united
arab
emirates
differed
over
local
allies
and
tactics
the
houthis
and
saleh
s
forces
were
driven
from
aden
and
its
environs
in
south
yemen
and
from
central
marib
and
the
desert
area
to
its
east
in
years
of
military
stalemate
followed
the
houthis
held
most
of
the
easily
defended
highlands
they
also
held
the
flat
red
sea
coast
and
its
port
of
hodeidah
the
last
entry
point
for
supplying
northern
yemen
the
coalition
kept
up
intense
air
strikes
aiming
to
split
the
houthis
and
saleh
they
imposed
a
partial
blockade
to
stop
iran
arming
the
houthis
something
it
denies
doing
but
despite
this
pressure
talks
went
nowhere
how
have
internal
divisions
played
out
then
last
year
saleh
finally
abandoned
his
houthi
allies
hoping
to
cut
a
deal
and
regain
power
for
his
family
but
he
was
killed
fleeing
sanaa
in
december
his
loyalists
turned
on
the
houthis
helping
the
advance
towards
hodeidah
that
culminated
in
this
week
s
assault
divisions
widened
on
the
other
side
too
the
uae
supported
separatists
in
the
south
who
sometimes
clashed
with
fighters
backed
by
saudi
arabia
in
the
north
the
saudis
brought
in
ahmar
to
command
forces
around
marib
a
red
flag
for
the
uae
because
of
his
connection
to
the
muslim
brotherhood
its
biggest
bugbear
meanwhile
the
death
toll
from
air
strikes
and
the
near
famine
aggravated
by
the
partial
blockade
prompted
international
outrage
making
it
harder
for
gulf
states
key
western
allies
to
maintain
military
aid
if
the
hodeidah
fighting
lasts
long
causing
big
coalition
casualties
and
an
outcry
over
a
humanitarian
catastrophe
the
houthis
may
hope
the
advance
will
fail
if
the
houthis
are
driven
out
and
lose
all
ability
to
keep
supply
lines
open
they
might
lose
the
war
but
there
is
no
guarantee
the
victors
could
put
aside
their
own
divisions
and
build
a
real
peace
