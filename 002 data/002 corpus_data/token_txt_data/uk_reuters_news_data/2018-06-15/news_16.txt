colombians
will
choose
either
a
protégé
of
a
powerful
or
a
leftist
former
guerrilla
as
their
new
head
of
state
on
sunday
with
the
future
of
a
historic
peace
accord
and
the
nation
s
economic
model
hanging
in
the
balance
ivan
duque
by
former
hardline
president
alvaro
uribe
is
predicted
to
win
sunday
s
runoff
as
he
is
polling
about
points
ahead
of
gustavo
petro
a
former
mayor
of
bogota
and
member
of
the
rebel
group
at
stake
is
the
implementation
of
a
peace
agreement
with
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
farc
which
brought
an
end
to
five
decades
of
conflict
with
the
marxist
rebel
group
and
whether
latin
america
s
economy
will
abandon
its
traditionally
posture
a
duque
victory
wouldn
t
mean
the
end
of
the
peace
agreement
but
it
could
mean
it
s
reduced
to
a
minimum
said
yann
basset
of
rosario
university
a
petro
victory
would
probably
mean
a
difficult
period
of
economic
the
duque
made
a
name
as
senator
for
his
staunch
opposition
to
the
peace
deal
negotiated
by
outgoing
president
juan
manuel
santos
who
once
counted
uribe
among
his
backers
before
falling
out
with
him
over
the
talks
duque
has
promised
changes
to
the
accord
which
he
slams
as
far
too
lenient
on
former
rebels
his
pledge
to
jail
commanders
for
war
crimes
has
sparked
concern
among
some
colombians
that
he
could
upset
the
deal
and
send
fighters
back
to
the
trenches
petro
has
criticized
the
deal
as
not
resolving
deep
rural
inequality
but
says
he
will
keep
it
intact
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
changes
if
any
duque
can
make
to
the
deal
which
was
upheld
by
the
constitutional
court
whoever
takes
office
as
president
on
faces
a
tough
time
the
billion
billion
pounds
economy
remains
weak
a
new
wave
of
drug
trafficking
crime
gangs
have
moved
into
areas
once
controlled
by
the
farc
and
almost
a
million
venezuelan
migrants
have
crossed
into
colombia
looking
for
food
and
work
here
though
he
was
never
a
combatant
petro
belonged
to
the
urban
rebel
group
which
demobilized
in
he
has
been
hailed
as
an
example
of
how
can
transition
to
politics
but
his
tenure
as
mayor
was
criticized
and
he
failed
to
win
over
bogota
voters
in
the
may
first
round
he
was
ousted
from
office
for
allowing
garbage
to
pile
on
bogota
s
streets
when
he
was
mayor
before
being
reinstated
he
was
a
very
bad
leader
bogota
was
too
big
for
him
to
govern
the
whole
country
would
be
too
said
fidel
hernandez
standing
outside
a
bogota
bicycle
shop
where
he
works
his
opponents
accuse
him
of
wanting
to
turn
colombia
into
socialist
venezuela
which
is
suffering
a
punishing
economic
crisis
the
denies
his
plans
to
redistribute
land
amounts
to
expropriation
and
says
power
has
remained
too
long
in
the
hands
of
elites
petro
would
likely
struggle
to
get
his
policies
through
a
conservative
congress
duque
who
worked
at
the
development
bank
until
is
considered
by
some
to
be
too
inexperienced
and
beholden
to
uribe
the
former
president
is
loved
and
hated
in
equal
measure
by
millions
who
either
believe
he
safeguarded
colombians
by
crushing
the
farc
or
supported
paramilitary
death
squads
that
killed
thousands
duque
is
counselled
by
uribe
he
s
his
puppet
said
deliveryman
francisco
roballo
who
plans
to
vote
for
petro
colombia
may
struggle
to
maintain
its
prized
investment
grade
credit
rating
whoever
wins
petro
s
pledges
to
hike
taxes
on
the
rich
and
raise
social
spending
have
unsettled
investors
but
there
are
concerns
that
duque
s
agenda
of
cutting
taxes
could
also
worsen
the
deficit
duque
has
promised
policies
friendly
to
the
oil
and
mining
industries
colombia
s
top
exporters
in
a
bid
to
revive
production
petro
wants
to
ban
gold
mining
and
not
renew
coal
contracts
as
well
as
transition
