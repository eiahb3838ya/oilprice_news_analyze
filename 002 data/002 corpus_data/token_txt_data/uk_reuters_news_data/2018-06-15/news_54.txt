a
group
that

and
advance
on

been
fully
controlled
by

the

ibrahim
jathran
who
headed
an
armed
group
that
blockaded
oil
crescent
terminals
for
three
years
before
being
forced
out
by
the
lna
and
who
appeared
in
a
video
posted
on

on
thursday
announcing
the
start
of
a
campaign
we
announce
the
preparation
of
our
ground
forces
and
supporting
forces
in
the
oil
region
and
our
objective
is
to
overturn
the
injustice
for
our
people
over
the
past
two
years
he
said
standing

jacket
in
an
unidentified
desert
area
the
past
two
years
have
been
catastrophic
for
people
in
the
oil
crescent
because
of
the
presence
of
the
system
of
injustice
which
is
the
other
face
of
terrorism
and
the
noc
says
jathran
s
previous
blockades
cost
libya
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
lost
revenue

attempts
to
export
oil
independently
repeated
previous
attempts
by
the
lna
s
opponents
to
retake
the
oil
crescent
have
failed
and
it
is
unclear
how
much
military
and
local
tribal
support
jathran
or
bdb
forces
currently
have
however
the
lna
which
is
the
dominant
force
in
eastern
libya

rejects
an
