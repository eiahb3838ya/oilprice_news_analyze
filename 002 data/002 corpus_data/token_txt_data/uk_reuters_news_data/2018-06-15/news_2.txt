china surprises with threat on u.s. energy exports
june
reuters
beijing
surprised
oil
markets
with
threats
to
levy
tariffs
on
imports
of
crude
oil
natural
gas
and
other
energy
products
on
friday
just
as
china
has
risen
to
the
top
of
the
list
of
importers
of
oil
from
the
united
states
china
responded
to
billion
in
tariffs
imposed
by
president
donald
trump
with
a
similar
amount
of
levies
on
a
variety
of
goods
but
china
also
said
it
would
impose
tariffs
on
energy
products
which
analysts
considered
a
surprise
as
previous
tariff
threats
had
centered
on
agricultural
goods
and
automobiles
this
is
a
big
deal
china
is
essentially
the
largest
customer
for
crude
now
and
so
for
crude
it
s
an
issue
let
alone
when
you
involve
refined
products
too
this
is
obviously
a
big
development
said
matt
smith
director
of
commodity
research
at
clipperdata
china
currently
imports
about
barrels
of
crude
daily
on
par
with
canada
as
the
biggest
crude
importer
according
to
energy
department
figures
it
also
takes
in
an
additional
barrels
a
day
bpd
of
other
products
like
propane
the
energy
industry
has
been
buoyed
by
production
from
the
nation
s
shale
fields
boosting
overall
daily
oil
production
to
a
record
million
bpd
of
that
the
united
states
is
now
exporting
about
million
bpd
and
trump
has
touted
dominance
in
energy
production
and
export
as
key
to
american
global
influence
the
united
states
has
also
been
urging
other
nations
including
china
to
buy
more
energy
and
limit
purchases
of
iranian
crude
after
trump
pulled
out
of
a
nuclear
arms
agreement
with
tehran
china
is
the
largest
buyer
of
iranian
oil
purchasing
bpd
in
the
first
quarter
of
and
it
is
unclear
if
it
plans
to
reduce
those
purchases
a
tariff
would
discourage
chinese
refiners
from
buying
crude
imports
the
threatened
tariff
by
china
comes
just
as
major
producers
including
saudi
arabia
and
russia
look
set
to
increase
production
at
next
week
s
meeting
of
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
along
with
other
states
china
is
also
a
major
importer
of
other
products
such
as
propane
and
tariffs
would
boost
prices
for
that
and
several
other
petroleum
products
said
bernadette
johnson
vice
president
at
drillinginfo
in
denver
she
also
said
sellers
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
also
emerging
as
a
export
to
china
have
been
worried
about
tariffs
the
constant
about
the
tariffs
creates
a
lot
of
market
uncertainty
that
makes
it
harder
to
sell
cargoes
or
sign
trade
deals
