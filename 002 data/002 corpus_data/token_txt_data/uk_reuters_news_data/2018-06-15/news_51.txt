growth
in
global
oil
consumption
has
accelerated
significantly
since
prices
slumped
in
highlighting
the
critical
role
demand
plays
in

lower

stimulated
oecd

and
played
a
big
role
in
eliminating
the
global
oil
market
surplus
during
the
rebalancing
phase
of
the
cycle
with
oil
prices
up
percent
over
the
last
months
however
higher
prices
are
set
to
moderate
oecd
consumption
and
thereby
global
demand
growth
in
economists
often
observe
that
the
of
oil
demand
is
low
meaning
a
small
change
in
prices
does
not
have
much
impact
on
the
amount
consumed
in
the
short
term
but
low
impact
does
not
mean
no
impact
in
the
case
of
a
large
and
sustained
change
such
as
occurred
in
consumption
has
proved
significantly
flexible
and
plays
a
key
role
in
rebalancing
the
market
according
to
the
latest
estimates
from
bp
global
consumption
increased
by
almost
million
barrels

in

bp
consumption
has
risen
by
an
average
of
million
bpd
in
the
last
three
years
since
oil
prices
slumped
compared
with
an
average
of
just

the
three
previous
years
real
crude

prices
averaged
per

between

from
between
and
according
to
bp
lower
oil
prices
have
helped
stimulate
faster
consumption
growth
especially
in
the
industrialised
countries
of
the

cooperation

oecd
consumption
rose
by
an

an

by

growth
in
the

slowed
slightly
to
an
average
annual
rate
of
million
bpd
from

earlier
faster
growth
in
the
oecd
economies
has
accounted
for
all
the
acceleration
in
global
fuel
consumption
since
the

the
bp
data
underscores
the
important
role
that
oil
price
and
consumption
changes
in
the
advanced
economies
play
in
balancing
the
market
consumption
in
the
rapidly
developing
economies
tends
to
be
more
strongly
influenced
by
incomes
and
economic
growth
in
the
more
mature
oecd
economies
however
consumption
is
more
strongly

by
large

sustained

changes

strongly
rising
oil
demand
linked
to
their
economic
development
has
been
the
principal
driver
of
increasing
oil
consumption
at
global
level
but
on
a
basis
consumption
changes
in
the
more
oecd
have
played
a
critical
role
in
stimulating
or
moderating
the
growth
rate
in
other
words
the
economies
are
responsible
for
the
overall
rising
trend
in
consumption
but
the
economies
are
significantly
responsible
for
variations
in
growth
around
that
trend
oecd
oil
consumption
may
now
account
for
a
minority
of
global
demand
and
the
annual
changes
may
be
relatively
small
but
they
still
play
a
critical
role
in
market
balancing
the
impact
is
clear
in
consumption
statistics
at
national
level
especially
for
the
united
states
where
low
levels
of
taxation
ensure
changes
in
crude
prices
have
a
big
impact
on
