norway
s
energy
minister
will
meet
with
companies
on
wednesday
to
discuss
the
potential
construction
of
offshore
floating
wind
farms
he
told
reuters
on
friday
the
meeting
is
the
first
concrete
step
to
spur
development
of
offshore
floating
power
generation
after
the
government
said
last
december
it
would
seek
to
accommodate
such
plans
wednesday
next
week
i
will
have
a
meeting
with
different
stakeholders
in
offshore
wind
and
discuss
both
the
opening
process
and
the
regulatory
framework
terje
soeviknes
said
unlike
offshore
wind
turbines
that
are
fixed
to
the
seabed
floating
wind
parks
are
seen
as
potentially
more
feasible
for
use
in
deeper
waters
the
minister
didn
t
name
any
firms
but
norway
s
equinor
which
recently
changed
its
name
from
statoil
to
increase
its
focus
in
renewable
energy
has
said
it
will
take
part
in
the
country
s
first
such
tender
if
there
are
subsidies
the
company
said
in
may
it
expected
about
gigawatt
gw
of
floating
offshore
wind
to
be
installed
globally
by
and
aimed
to
take
a
fair
share
of
that
equinor
is
also
the
owner
of
the
world
s
first
floating
offshore
wind
farm
project
a
megawatt
farm
called
hywind
off
the
coast
of
scotland
and
is
already
maturing
a
project
in
norway
to
combine
floating
wind
with
oil
platforms
norway
s
energy
minister
expected
to
conclude
the
discussions
within
a
few
months
by
autumn
i
hope
we
will
have
a
proposal
perhaps
we
need
to
go
through
the
parliament
with
this
he
said
norway
is
western
europe
s
top
producer
of
oil
and
natural
gas
and
has
so
far
lagged
nordic
neighbors
denmark
and
sweden
in
wind
power
developments
