enough
over

the
united
states
the

at
the

model
procedure
pending
at
the
court
the
court
said
in
a
statement
lawyers
for
vw
have
said
the
carmaker
had
no
obligation
to
disclose
the
possible
financial
damage
of
its
emissions
manipulations
prior
to
when
it
specified
the
implications
of
its
use
of
illicit
software
because
it
believed
the
financial
costs
of
the
cheating
would
be
insignificant
this
move
by
the
braunschweig
court
is
giving
investors
another
chance
to
submit
further
claims

axel
wegner
of

firm
tilp
which
represents
deka
investment
gmbh
deka
lost
money
on
its
vw
shares
when
they
fell
sharply
after
the
emissions
cheating
but
says
the
purpose
of
its
legal
action
is
to
provide
a
test
case
resolving
generic
or
common
issues
for
other
related
cases
however
unlike
in
a
class
action
suit
this
case
does
not
have
the
legal
effect
of
resolving
all
individual
claims
public
hearings
of
the
braunschweig
case
are
due
to
start
in
early
september
