donald

has
decided
to
impose
pretty
significant
tariffs
and

on

up
protectionist
rhetoric
and
measures
by
the
administration
it
is
not
clear
when
trump
will
activate
the
measures
but
rising
trade
tensions
will
put
more
pressure
on
china
s
economy

show
signs
of
cooling

andrew
milligan
head
of
global
strategy
at
aberdeen
standard
investments
said
that
in
the
context
of
trade
flows
the
sum
of
goods
targeted
was
small
the
big
question
is
do
we
fall
into
tit
for
tat
what
s
the
response
going
to
be
from
china
and
the
eu
can
it
remain
at
a
technical
level
or
will
we
see
a
series
of
failing
conversations
between
mr
trump
and
other
leaders
that
may
not
affect
gdp
growth
all
that
much
in
the
short
term
but
it
will
have
a
noticeable
impact
on
capital
flows
and
business
sentiment

many

chinese
stocks
led
the

with

european
shares
were
set
for
their
best
week
in
more
than
three
months
as
investors
pushed
back
expectations
for
an
interest
rate
increase
after
thursday
s
european
central
bank
meeting
the
stoxx
index
fell
percent
as
a
recovering
euro
weighed
both
stocks
and
the
euro
dipped
briefly
on
a
report
said
germany

christian
social

party
would
dissolve
its

recovered
after

was
denied
and
found
to
be
a
hoax
the
single
currency
was
headed
for
its
worst
weekly
loss
in

after
the
ecb
on

signalled
interest

would
be
left
at
record
lows
into
at
least
the
currency
had
shed
percent
to
the
dollar
its
biggest
daily
decline
since
britain
voted
to
quit
the
eu
in
the
overall
weakness
in
the
euro
gave
a
lift
to
the
dollar
which
hit
its
highest
against
a
basket
of
currencies
since
november
i
think
the
biggest
concern
at
the
moment
more
than
talk
about
trade
is
the
tightening
of
monetary
conditions
in
emerging
markets
caused
by
a
stronger
dollar

hewson
chief

analyst
