gustavo
petro
a
former
insurgent
turned
mayor
is
fighting
to
become
colombia
s
first
leftist
president
turning
his
humble
beginnings
and
revolutionary
past
into
a
rallying
cry
for
millions
of
the
nation
s
youth
and
poor
the
economist
is
about
points
behind
candidate
ivan
duque
to
replace
president
juan
manuel
santos
but
his
presence
in
the
second
round
has
worried
many
in
the
traditionally
conservative
nation
where
the
right
has
kept
a
grip
on
power
proposals
from
petro
to
change
the
nation
s
economic
model
by
piling
taxes
on
unproductive
landowners
and
abandoning
oil
and
coal
for
clean
energy
have
spooked
investors
some
fear
his
efforts
to
shift
wealth
from
rich
to
poor
could
turn
colombia
into
another
venezuela
known
for
his
fiery
speeches
from
the
senate
against
corruption
and
paramilitary
groups
petro
says
his
political
awakening
began
in
with
the
military
coup
that
ended
the
rule
of
chile
s
socialist
president
salvador
allende
colombia
was
descending
into
violence
around
the
same
time
as
guerrilla
groups
began
a
wave
of
kidnappings
and
attacks
on
civilians
it
was
then
that
petro
the
son
of
a
teacher
pledged
to
fight
the
feudal
oligarchy
enriching
itself
at
the
expense
of
colombia
s
poor
the
former
member
of
the
guerilla
group
said
century
politics
is
between
the
politics
of
life
and
the
politics
of
death
the
father
of
six
told
reuters
in
april
i
represent
the
politics
of
inspired
as
a
child
by
political
biographies
petro
reportedly
raised
the
ire
of
his
catholic
teachers
by
reading
books
by
karl
marx
and
friedrich
engels
although
never
a
combatant
petro
s
years
in
the
rebel
group
which
stormed
the
supreme
court
in
leading
to
the
deaths
of
more
than
people
have
created
fodder
for
critics
he
was
arrested
that
year
for
weapons
possession
and
served
months
in
prison
where
he
has
said
he
was
tortured
petro
s
election
as
mayor
of
bogota
colombia
s
powerful
post
after
the
presidency
was
seen
as
proof
that
politics
was
the
way
forward
for
insurgent
movements
like
the
revolutionary
armed
forces
of
colombia
farc
which
demobilized
last
year
and
formed
a
political
party
he
won
million
votes
in
the
first
round
petro
represents
a
clearly
populist
project
said
andres
molano
director
of
the
hernan
echavarria
olozaga
institute
of
political
science
he
presents
himself
as
an
outsider
an
enemy
of
the
elites
and
has
elaborated
a
messianic
and
discourse
that
promises
a
kind
of
revolution
both
politically
and
a
win
for
petro
may
help
shore
up
colombia
s
fragile
peace
process
that
ended
five
decades
of
war
with
the
farc
but
angered
many
by
giving
their
commanders
a
political
voice
instead
of
a
jail
cell
petro
promises
latin
america
s
economy
will
include
all
of
society
creating
a
public
banking
system
that
guarantees
cheap
credit
to
sized
businesses
and
expanding
free
education
that
may
be
difficult
the
economy
remains
weak
a
new
wave
of
drug
trafficking
crime
gangs
have
moved
into
areas
once
controlled
by
the
farc
and
half
a
million
venezuelan
migrants
have
crossed
into
colombia
looking
for
food
and
work
critics
say
his
ideas
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
early
days
of
late
socialist
leader
hugo
chavez
s
government
in
venezuela
there
are
many
echoes
of
the
century
socialism
that
flourished
in
latin
america
during
the
last
two
decades
said
molano
petro
has
said
he
does
not
plan
to
expropriate
property
but
he
raised
eyebrows
with
his
recent
offer
to
buy
a
huge
piece
of
productive
land
from
billionaire
sugar
baron
and
media
mogul
carlos
ardila
lulle
to
give
to
the
poor
while
it
may
be
tough
for
petro
to
push
radical
change
through
congress
his
colombia
humana
party
won
just
six
seats
in
march
s
legislative
election
he
said
he
would
seek
alliances
with
center
left
and
other
minority
parties
or
attempt
a
change
to
the
constitution
through
a
constituent
assembly
known
for
his
stubborn
management
style
and
ruling
by
decree
the
bespectacled
petro
has
taken
flack
for
living
in
a
gated
community
and
wearing
shoes
but
his
expensive
lifestyle
has
not
swayed
voters
or
his
discourse
because
i
m
from
the
left
i
have
to
wear
espadrilles
he
responded
wryly
in
a
recent
radio
interview
