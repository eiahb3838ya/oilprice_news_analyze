traffic

the
previous

from

is

as

the
volume
of
traffic
on
roads
was
down
by
almost
percent
in
april
compared
with
the
same
month
a
year
earlier
after
seasonal
adjustments
according
to
statistics
released
on

traffic

volumes

month
can
be
distorted
by
the
timing
of
public
holidays
the
distribution
of

and

patterns
but
the
rate
of
growth
in

has
been

since

the
rise
in
gasoline
prices
after

during

traffic
volume
growth
has
been
correlated
with
the
rise
and
fall
in
retail
gasoline
prices
over
at
least
the
past
years
among
other
factors
cheap
gasoline
provided
a
significant
stimulus
to
driving
during
the
latter
part
of
and
throughout
but
the
impact
has
faded
as
average
pump
prices
have
climbed
back
towards
per

the
slowdown
in
traffic
volume
growth
is
consistent
with
separate

showing
a
levelling
off
in
the
quantity
of

over

a

growth
rates
which
has
been
confirmed
during
the
most
recent
cycle
oil
consumption
is
normally
led
by
gasoline
during
the
first
phase
of
each
cyclical
upswing
until
distillates
become
the
primary
driver
in
the
second
phase
during
the
first
phase
of
the
current
cyclical
recovery
the
rise
in
oil
consumption
was
led
by
gasoline
consumption
by
private
motorists
but
that
impact
is
now
fading
as
gasoline
prices
climb
further
consumption
growth
increasingly
relies
on
the
distillate
fuels
used
in
freight
transport
as
well
as
the
industrial
sector
and
on
oil
and
gas
drilling
sites
notwithstanding
strong
demand
for
distillates
rising
oil
prices
are
already
starting
to
