the

we
have
the
issue
of
micron
just
when
technology
shares
started
to
lose
momentum
after
their
stellar
performance
so
far
this
year
if
we
see
further
in
the
sector
that
would
be
worrying
given
their
heavy
weighting
in
major
indexes
said
nobuhiko
kuramochi
chief
strategist
at
mizuho
securities
many
investors
fear
washington
will
go
ahead
with
its
plan
to
levy
a
percent
tariff
on
product
categories
from
china
including
cars
on
friday
which
beijing
has
vowed
to
match
with
tariffs
on
products
they
worry
the
move
could
spark
a
international
trade
war
and
harm
the
global
economy
especially
as
the
trump
administration
has
threatened
tariffs
on
imports
from
many
other
major
economies
the
has
listed
another
product
lines
valued
at
billion
targeting
semiconductors
and
a
broad
range
of
electronics
which
it
has
said
will
go
into
effect
after
a
public
comment
period
and
threatened
another
percent
tariffs
on
up
to
billion
of
chinese
goods
washington
has
also
launched
a
national
security
investigation
into
car
and
truck
imports
with
trump
threatening
europe
with
a
percent
tariff
on
car
imports
while
various
countries
have
also
already
taken
retaliatory
steps
against
tariffs
on
steels
and
aluminium
products
over
countries
have
voiced
deep
concern
at
the
world
trade
organization
wto
about
possible
measures
investors
fret
that
global
trade
could
shrink
as
countries
impose
tariffs
one
after
another
they
need
to
be
defensive
for
the
time
being
said
yukino
yamada
senior
strategist
at
daiwa
securities
in
the
currency
market
the
yuan
bounced
back
from
an
low
following
moves
by
china
s
central
bank
on
tuesday
to
calm
jittery
financial
markets
the
chinese
currency
fetched
per
dollar
in
onshore
trade
off
tuesday
s
low
of
major
currencies
were
treading
water
as
traders
fretted
about
the
fallout
of
the
intensifying
trade
frictions
between
washington
and
the
rest
of
the
world
the
euro
stood
little
changed
at
while
the

changed
hands
at
yen
down

oil
prices

light
crude
futures
traded
up
percent
at
per
barrel
after
rising
above
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
three
years
on
tuesday
international
benchmark
brent

rose
percent
to

copper
sometimes
seen
as
barometer
of
the
global
economic
strength
given
its
wide
use
in
power
and
construction
was
soft
however
hitting
low
on
tuesday
it
fell
to
as
low
as
per
tonne
on
tuesday
before
bouncing
back
to
on
wednesday
the
price
ratio
of
copper
and
oil
can
be
seen
as
a
leading
indicator
of
global
growth
said
masanori
takada
quantitative
strategist
at
nomura
securities
that
ratio
is
now
at
a
year
low
the
latest
divergence
appears
to
be
driven
in
part
by
trading
by
ctas
commodity
trading
advisors
if
that
is
based
on
expectations
of
global
slowdown
this
could
be
an
ominous
sign
for
the
global
economy
