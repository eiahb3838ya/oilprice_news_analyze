norway turns to power imports after dry spring hits hydropower reserves
oslo
july
reuters
norway
has
become
a
net
power
importer
from
denmark
and
sweden
this
summer
after
a
warm
and
dry
spring
reduced
the
nation
s
hydropower
reserves
and
drove
up
norwegian
power
prices
the
grid
operator
said
on
wednesday
norway
s
reservoirs
have
received
rainfall
in
that
is
equivalent
to
terrawatt
hours
twh
less
than
a
normal
year
a
shortfall
equivalent
to
the
energy
needs
of
million
households
or
half
of
norway
s
population
most
of
the
imported
power
comes
from
denmark
and
sweden
which
had
a
surplus
of
wind
power
norway
s
grid
statnett
said
in
a
statement
adding
that
it
was
the
first
summer
in
several
years
that
norway
was
a
net
power
importer
given
the
snowy
winter
we
had
it
may
seem
strange
that
we
are
in
such
a
situation
it
said
although
norway
s
reservoirs
at
percent
full
last
week
are
at
a
marginally
higher
level
than
the
same
period
last
year
most
of
the
snow
has
already
melted
due
to
the
unusually
warm
spring
so
there
is
less
water
being
added
warm
dry
conditions
have
also
led
to
more
evaporation
dry
weather
is
still
expected
and
the
hydrological
balance
is
expected
to
deteriorate
further
in
the
short
term
it
said
last
year
norway
s
reservoirs
peaked
at
percent
full
experts
say
the
peak
this
year
is
likely
to
be
far
lower
lower
water
levels
mean
electricity
will
cost
much
more
for
consumers
making
it
cheaper
to
import
power
the
price
of
norwegian
power
this
summer
exceeded
euros
per
megawatt
hour
nearly
double
last
year
s
level
the
fact
that
we
have
the
opportunity
to
import
surplus
power
from
our
neighbouring
countries
means
that
we
can
exploit
each
other
s
energy
systems
and
save
on
norwegian
water
resources
when
needed
