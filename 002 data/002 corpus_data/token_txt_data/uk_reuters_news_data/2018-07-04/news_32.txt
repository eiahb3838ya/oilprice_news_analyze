exclusive-japan's inpex delays output from giant offshore gas project in australia
tokyo
reuters
japan
s
inpex
corp
has
delayed
gas
production
from
its
giant
ichthys
field
off
the
coast
of
australia
just
weeks
after
giving
assurances
that
output
would
start
imminently
inpex
s
new
chief
executive
officer
told
reuters
the
company
was
yet
to
start
churning
out
gas
from
the
billion
billion
project
and
did
not
give
a
timetable
for
when
that
would
happen
japan
s
biggest
oil
and
gas
producer
had
said
on
june
that
commissioning
of
all
onshore
and
offshore
facilities
at
the
project
was
complete
and
that
gas
would
start
flowing
within
a
week
or
two
there
are
various
minor
issues
to
address
in
the
final
safety
checks
but
there
are
no
major
problems
with
the
facilities
ueda
said
on
tuesday
in
his
first
interview
with
overseas
media
since
taking
the
helm
at
inpex
last
month
the
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
already
hit
by
multiple
delays
is
a
major
test
for
inpex
as
it
marks
the
first
time
it
has
operated
a
major
energy
development
on
its
own
we
can
start
production
in
the
not
too
distant
future
ueda
said
without
giving
details
he
added
that
the
company
is
keeping
its
target
to
ship
its
first
lng
cargo
by
the
end
of
september
ichthys
will
send
gas
from
an
offshore
central
processing
facility
through
an
pipeline
to
the
mainland
near
the
city
of
darwin
where
it
will
be
processed
into
lng
for
export
delays
are
common
with
large
projects
like
ichthys
but
the
development
has
been
plagued
by
a
wide
range
of
issues
including
contractor
disputes
technical
difficulties
and
bad
weather
inpex
aims
to
start
the
project
s
second
liquefaction
train
by
a
few
months
after
the
first
unit
starts
operating
at
full
operation
ichthys
is
expected
to
produce
million
tonnes
of
lng
a
year
along
with
about
million
tonnes
of
liquefied
petroleum
gas
and
around
barrels
per
day
of
condensate
an
form
of
crude
oil
ichthys
will
likely
take
two
or
three
years
to
reach
full
production
ueda
said
after
that
inpex
will
assess
market
demand
for
a
possible
doubling
of
the
project
s
capacity
using
known
gas
reserves
in
the
area
he
said
should
it
expand
the
project
further
major
pipelines
will
likely
be
unnecessary
ueda
added
getting
ichthys
up
and
running
will
be
a
significant
boost
for
inpex
as
the
project
is
expected
to
account
for
half
of
its
billion
yen
million
profit
forecast
for
this
business
year
inpex
holds
percent
of
ichthys
france
s
total
percent
with
the
rest
spread
amongst
taiwan
s
cpc
corp
and
japanese
utilities
ueda
said
inpex
has
accumulated
valuable
experience
from
ichthys
that
it
would
apply
to
its
abadi
lng
project
in
indonesia
where
it
hopes
to
start
production
in
the
late
yen
