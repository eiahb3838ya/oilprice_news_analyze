trying
to
create
the
shortest
supply
chain
possible
a
supermarket
in
brussels
is
selling
produce
grown
on
its
own
roof
only
hours
after
being
harvested
delhaize
a
belgian
supermarket
chain
part
of
ahold
delhaize
said
it
launched
the
urban
farm
project
to
satisfy
the
growing
number
of
consumers
who
are
concerned
about
where
their
food
is
sourced
and
eating
healthy
the
products
are
harvested
in
the
morning
at
o
clock
and
an
hour
later
they
re
in
the
store
store
employee
marie
delvaulx
said
the
garden
on
the
roof
also
generates
its
energy
sustainably
with
solar
panels
and
by
recuperating
heat
from
the
store
building
the
farm
which
this
year
produced
tomatoes
lettuces
and
strawberries
operates
year
round
and
can
withstand
the
cold
months
thanks
to
a
greenhouse
creating
a
farm
in
a
roof
on
city
comes
with
some
challenges
the
produce
can
easily
be
destroyed
because
the
farm
lacks
biodiversity
to
mitigate
the
damage
from
insects
and
there
also
is
the
question
of
the
weight
constraints
while
the
farm
the
first
of
its
kind
in
delhaize
stores
currently
only
produces
a
fraction
of
the
supply
needs
it
will
serve
as
a
test
for
expanding
the
program
to
other
stores
