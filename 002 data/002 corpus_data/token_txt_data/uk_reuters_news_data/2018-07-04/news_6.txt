iranian

appeared

exports
force
majeure
in
libya
and
unplanned
pipeline
outages
in
nigeria
have
been
clouding
the
supply
outlook
despite
rising
output
by
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
in
an
ideal
world
an
increase
in
global
or
regional
oil
production
would
have
downward
pressure
on
prices
these
are
however
no
normal
times
as
supply
outages
are
almost
weekly
occurrences
pvm
oil
associates
strategist
tamas
varga
said
under
these
circumstances
it
is
justified
to
argue
for
higher
prices
when
production
increases
are
announced
he
said
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
in
the

to
june
to
million
compared
with

expectations
for
a
decrease

volatility
a
way
of
measuring
uncertainty
among
crude
oil
traders
and
investors
is
at
its
highest
since
the
to
last
month
s
opec
meeting
where
an
agreement
was
reached
to
ease
output
curbs
in
place
since
january
with
the
outlook
unclear
investors
were
turning
to
options
to
protect
themselves
against
any
sudden
move
said
harry
tchilinguirian
head
of
commodities
strategy
at
bnp
paribas
when
there
is
consolidation
in
the
market
there
is
also
the
expectation
of
an
eventual
price
breakout
in
either
direction
so
in
the
options
market
the
volatility
gets
bid
up
he
told
the
reuters
global
oil
forum
investors
can
bet
on
various
aspects
of
an
option
from
the
premium
to
the
price
to
how
much
that
option
might
move
