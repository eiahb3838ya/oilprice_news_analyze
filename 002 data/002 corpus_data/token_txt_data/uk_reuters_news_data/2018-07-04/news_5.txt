says
contracts
worth
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
have
been

obrador
was
an
opponent
of
the
energy
reform
and
has
threatened
to
reverse
it
however
his
business
advisers
say
they
have
persuaded

romo

more
contracts

be
awarded
before
taking
office
the
new

will
negotiate
the
federal
budget
for
with
the
outgoing
administration
when
asked
to
sum
up
the
economic
outlook
for
urzua
said
he
expected
growth
of
about
percent
and
that
inflation
would
be
about
between
and
he
saw
the
peso
trading
around
pesos
per
dollar
and
the
price
of
mexican
crude
at
about
per
barrel
the
peso
which
was
under
pressure
before
the
election
strengthened
on
tuesday
after
lopez
obrador
vowed
to
work
closely
with
pena
nieto
for
an
orderly
transition
urzua
said
the
currency
could
appreciate
if
mexico
concluded
the
renegotiation
of
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
with
the
united
states
and
canada
this
year
that
could
see
the
peso
trade
below
per
dollar
he
forecast
lopez
obrador
has
also
criticized
the
new
billion
mexico
city
airport
which
is
already
under
construction
he
had
threatened
to
scrap
it
but
has
since
held
out
the
possibility
of
turning
into
a
concession
urzua
who
was
lopez
obrador
s
finance
minister
for
part
of
his
term
as
mayor
said
it
was
too
early
to
predict
what
would
happen
with
the
airport
but
noted
a
concession
might
prove
the
easiest
option
gasoline
prices
would
rise
in
future
in
accordance
with
inflation
