delhi
reuters
at
the
international
energy
forum
in
delhi
in
april
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
saudi
aramco
inked
a
preliminary
deal
to
partner
with
a
consortium
of
indian
players
to
build
a
billion
refinery
and
petrochemical
project
on
india
s
west
coast
the
huge
project
was
touted
as
a
gamechanger
for
both
parties
offering
india
steady
fuel
supplies
and
meeting
saudi
arabia
s
need
to
secure
regular
buyers
for
its
oil
despite
the
obvious
benefits
though
the
prospects
for
the
plan
in
the
works
since
are
growing
dimmer
by
the
day
thousands
of
farmers
oppose
the
refinery
and
are
refusing
to
surrender
land
fearing
it
could
damage
a
region
famed
for
its
alphonso
mangoes
vast
cashew
plantations
and
fishing
hamlets
that
boast
bountiful
catches
of
seafood
we
earn
enough
to
fulfil
our
needs
and
we
do
not
want
to
surrender
our
lands
for
a
refinery
at
any
cost

of
mumbai
land
acquisition
has
always
been
a
contentious
issue
in
rural
india
where
a
majority
of
the
population
depends
on
farming
for
their
livelihood
in
for
example
india
s
tata
motors
had
to
shelve
plans
for
a
car
factory
in
an
eastern
state
after
facing
widespread
protests
from
farmers
and
while
prime
minister
narendra
modi
has
tried
to
ease
land
acquisition
rules
to
jumpstart
delayed
projects
worth
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
the
government
has
faced
resistance
to
amending
populist
laws
enacted
by
his
predecessors
like
desai
a
majority
of
the
farmers
from
villages
around
ratnagiri
that
need
to
be
relocated
for
the
refinery
project
firmly
oppose
the
plan
a
state
government
official
told
reuters
opposition
politicians
and
even
a
local
ally
of
modi
s
bhartiya
janta
party
bjp
support
the
farmer
movement
complicating
matters
further
for
the
government
ahead
of
state
and
general
elections
in
the
state
government
which
is
responsible
for
acquiring
the
land
for
the
project
has
so
far
failed
to
secure
even
one
acre
of
the
roughly
acres
needed
for
the
refinery
maharashtra
industries
minister
subhash
desai
told
reuters
the
state
is
not
going
to
acquire
land
as
a
majority
of
the
farmers
are
against
the
plan
said
desai
the
minister
who
is
a
member
of
the
shiv
sena
a
regional
party
allied
with
the
bjp
in
the
maharashtra
state
government
under
land
acquisition
rules
at
least
percent
of
the
land
owners
need
to
provide
consent
for
a
project
he
said
still
some
believe
that
the
opponents
are
only
objecting
to
get
better
compensation
packages
for
their
land
eventually
all
stakeholders
will
give
their
consent
but
it
will
take
time
said
ajay
singh
sengar
who
heads
a
rival
forum
that
supports
the
refinery
project
a
local
government
official
in
the
area
said
he
thought
many
farmers
would
agree
to
a
deal
once
a
compensation
package
was
announced
the
ratnagiri
refinery
petrochemicals
ltd
rrpl
which
is
running
the
project
says
the
bpd
refinery
and
an
integrated
petrochemical
site
with
a
capacity
of
million
tonnes
per
year
will
help
create
direct
and
indirect
employment
for
up
to
people
with
jobs
that
pay
better
than
agriculture
or
fishing
but
farmers
say
they
have
sufficient
work
in
their
orchards
and
fields
we
don
t
have
enough
people
to
maintain
our
mango
orchards
that
s
why
every
year
we
employ
migrant
labour
from
nepal
says
arvind
samant
the
secretary
of
a
farmers
and
fishermen
s
group
that
was
created
to
organise
opposition
to
the
project
samant
says
instead
of
a
refinery
the
government
should
bring
plants
or
other
industries
that
suit
local
needs
rrpl
a
joint
venture
between
indian
oil
corp
ioc
hindustan
petroleum
and
bharat
petroleum
said
suggestions
the
refinery
would
hurt
the
environment
were
baseless
it
says
it
will
continue
to
cultivate
mangoes
and
cashews
on
some
acres
of
land
around
the
project
despite
the
opposition
rrpl
is
hopeful
the
project
will
proceed
some
people
misguided
farmers
and
created
fear
we
re
now
trying
to
answer
each
and
every
doubt
said
anil
nagwekar
a
spokesman
for
the
rrpl
adding
rrpl
was
struggling
to
convince
farmers
as
they
refused
to
even
discuss
the
plan
with
the
company
hundreds
of
people
have
joined
protests
blocking
surveyors
from
even
measuring
land
needed
for
the
site
said
omkar
prabhudesai
who
heads
the
local
group
opposing
the
project
there
is
no
point
in
listening
to
the
company
s
views
we
have
already
decided
not
to
give
our
land
said
prabhudesai
the
refinery
announced
in
was
to
be
commissioned
by
but
delays
in
land
acquisition
mean
the
deadline
is
likely
to
be
pushed
back
ideally
the
state
government
should
have
acquired
land
by
now
and
the
work
for
the
project
should
have
started
the
delay
could
impact
deadlines
said
rrpl
s
nagwekar
saudi
aramco
declined
to
comment
while
india
s
oil
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
reuters
email
seeking
comment
even
if
the
government
wanted
to
implement
the
project
it
would
not
start
any
land
acquisition
process
before
elections
in
conceded
a
senior
state
government
official
who
asked
not
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
matter
sensing
political
mileage
every
political
party
is
opposing
the
project
for
the
next
one
year
there
won
t
be
any
progress
the
official
said
workers
of
the
maharashtra
navnirman
sena
mns
a
regional
party
vandalised
offices
of
rrpl
in
mumbai
in
april
an
mns
spokesman
confirmed
reports
of
the
incident
and
said
the
party
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
refinery
plan
parties
like
the
indian
national
congress
and
the
nationalist
congress
party
also
oppose
the
plan
still
some
officials
remain
hopeful
building
a
large
project
such
as
this
in
india
was
possible
but
could
take
years
said

the
paradip
refinery
project
in
he
said
referring
to
a
plant
it
runs
on
the
east
coast
but
for
various
reasons
the
project
got
delayed
and
it
was
finally
only
commissioned
