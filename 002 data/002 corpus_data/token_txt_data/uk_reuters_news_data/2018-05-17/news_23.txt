peskov
told

rosneft
vietnam
had
wanted

little
attention
as
possible
despite
the
statement
by

the
sources
said
on

its

both

that

claimed
by

said
ian
storey
a
regional
security
expert
at
singapore

although
russian
diplomats
have
privately
expressed
concerns
to
their
counterparts
that
china
may
one
day
put
pressure
on
moscow
to
terminate
those
projects
so
far
beijing
has
refrained
from
doing
so
because
of
the
strategic
partnership
between
the
two
countries
said
storey
it
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
burgeoning
entente
if
beijing
asked
moscow
to
end
its
energy
projects
in
china
has
become
russia
s
top
destination
for
exports
largely
because
russia
is
the
largest
supplier
of
oil
and
gas
to
china
mainly
through
pipelines
the
drilling

the
drilling
is
significant
for
vietnam
which
has
been
struggling
to
maintain
its
crude
oil
and
gas
output
amid
already
declining
production
from
its
key
fields
and
the
continuing
pressure
from
china
in
the
disputed
waters
vietnam
already
gets
about
percent
of
its
gas
needs
from

because
of
oil
and

operations
that
were
first
established
there
more
