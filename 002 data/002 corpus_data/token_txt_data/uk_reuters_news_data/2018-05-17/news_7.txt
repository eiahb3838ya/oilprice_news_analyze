the
canadian
government
s
optimism
that
outside
investors
would
be
interested
in
taking
over
a
kinder
morgan
canada
oil
pipeline
project
if
the
company
pulls
out
might
be
misplaced
said
energy
industry
sources
and
analysts
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
on
wednesday
that
canada
was
prepared
to
cover
some
losses
the
firm
might
suffer
if
the
proposed
c
billion
billion
expansion
of
its
trans
mountain
line
was
delayed
and
predicted
plenty
of
investors
would
be
interested
in
stepping
in
if
need
be
kinder
morgan
canada
has
said
it
will
ditch
the
trans
mountain
expansion
by
may
unless
ottawa
dispels
the
uncertainties
over
the
project
which
the
provincial
government
in
british
columbia
strongly
opposes
on
environmental
grounds
a
canadian
energy
industry
source
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
about
the
matter
said
morneau
s
comments
about
potential
new
investors
were
puzzling
companies
are
likely
more
focused
on
easing
pipeline
bottlenecks
south
of
the
border
and
are
not
interested
in
taking
on
the
trans
mountain
project
which
still
faces
fierce
opposition
the
source
said
hundreds
of
people
have
been
arrested
in
burnaby
the
british
columbia
port
where
the
pipeline
ends
it
doesn
t
matter
who
the
owner
is
even
if
it
s
the
federal
government
you
re
not
getting
the
grandma
off
the
picket
line
in
burnaby
said
the
source
a
calgary
oil
trader
said
morneau
s
assurances
struck
the
wrong
chord
i
don
t
want
the
government
involved
in
owning
or
funding
a
pipeline
two
governments
from
now
who
knows
what
they
would
do
with
it
just
the
wrong
message
to
the
industry
kinder
morgan
canada
already
operates
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
and
it
is
unclear
whether
it
would
welcome
a
rival
taking
over
the
expansion
or
if
it
would
make
practical
sense
although
one
option
might
be
to
let
an
overseas
company
to
step
in
foreign
investment
in
canada
s
energy
sector
could
be
a
sensitive
issue
andrew
botterill
national
oil
and
gas
leader
at
deloitte
which
advises
energy
companies
said
investors
think
canadian
pipelines
and
other
resource
projects
generally
face
high
political
risk
that
s
the
type
of
risk
that
makes
it
very
difficult
for
companies
to
come
in
and
invest
in
canada
when
they
re
looking
globally
for
stability
he
said
if
outside
investors
shy
away
the
obvious
option
would
be
for
the
federal
government
to
look
at
taking
a
stake
in
the
expansion
or
buying
it
outright
a
source
with
deep
ties
to
the
natural
resources
sector
who
was
not
authorized
to
speak
publicly
about
the
matter
suggested
canada
s
recently
created
infrastructure
bank
might
be
the
best
way
to
invest
the
agency
is
open
for
business
but
has
yet
to
facilitate
financing
for
any
project
infrastructure
bank
