africa
is
sometimes
better
known
for
its
vulnerability
to
climate
change
than
its
action
on
the
problem
but
a
set
of
african
cities
intend
to
change
that
eight
cities
from
accra
to
dar
es
salaam
pledged
this
week
to
deliver
their
share
of
emissions
cuts
needed
to
meet
paris
agreement
targets
to
limit
climate
change
that
means
achieving
zero
carbon
city
economies
by
with
climate
changing
emissions
eliminated
or
dramatically
reduced
and
any
small
remaining
emissions
offset
by
other
green
actions
we
can
not
ignore
the
implications
of
what
will
befall
us
if
we
do
not
act
now
said
mohammed
adjei
sowah
the
mayor
of
accra
ghana
s
capital
at
a
planning
meeting
in
nigeria
on
urban
climate
action
in
africa
pursuing
development
in
the
way
it
s
traditionally
been
done
is
no
longer
feasible
he
said
in
lagos
at
the
launch
of
the
emissions
cutting
push
achieving
the
aim
will
require
significant
work
according
to
the
world
bank
of
the
top
big
world
cities
with
the
lowest
emissions
only
one
johannesburg
is
in
africa
under
the
new
commitments
cities
will
work
to
reduce
emissions
from
things
such
as
transport
buildings
energy
production
and
waste
management
an
effort
some
have
already
started
the
city
of
tshwane
formerly
pretoria
in
south
africa
for
instance
has
carried
out
an
inventory
of
its
emissions
to
better
understand
which
areas
need
the
most
urgent
work
the
city
s
mayor
also
has
for
four
years
organised
the
african
capital
cities
sustainability
forum
which
led
to
the
creation
of
a
sustainability
unit
in
tshwane
s
mayoral
office
we
started
this
climate
action
trajectory
in
putting
together
the
carbon
emission
inventory
and
vulnerability
assessment
out
of
which
we
then
started
to
take
action
based
on
the
data
sello
mphaga
head
of
the
tshwane
mayor
s
sustainability
unit
the
city
s
emissions
come
from
three
main
sectors
energy
waste
management
and
transport
from
the
study
we
see
how
much
each
sector
is
emitting
and
that
assists
us
in
planning
to
reduce
or
act
upon
these
emissions
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
on
the
sidelines
of
the
lagos
meeting
besides
accra
tshwane
and
dar
es
salaam
other
african
cities
that
have
signed
the
new
pledge
include
addis
ababa
lagos
dakar
cape
town
durban
and
johannesburg
two
other
cities
nairobi
and
abidjan
are
expected
to
submit
their
plans
to
take
part
soon
said
mark
watts
executive
director
of
the
cities
alliance
a
global
network
of
cities
tackling
climate
change
to
try
to
achieve
the
paris
agreement
goals
cities
signed
on
to
the
new
african
effort
commit
to
reduce
their
carbon
emissions
to
zero
by
sowah
of
accra
said
he
believes
it
is
possible
to
dramatically
cut
urban
african
emissions
particularly
as
more
african
cities
become
aware
of
the
impact
of
worsening
climate
extremes
from
recurring
droughts
and
floods
to
failed
crops
and
more
migration
but
african
cities
will
need
to
hold
the
line
on
emissions
even
as
their
populations
grow
substantially
in
coming
decades
the
world
bank
projects
that
percent
of
the
world
s
population
could
live
in
cities
by
and
africa
is
expected
to
account
for
half
of
the
world
s
population
growth
by
here
lagos
for
instance
struggles
with
heavy
pollution
from
its
infamous
traffic
jams
while
its
population
of
million
produces
large
volumes
of
waste
nigeria
is
also
home
to
onitsha
which
the
world
health
organization
in
named
as
a
city
with
some
of
the
world
s
worst
air
pollution
and
port
harcourt
an
oil
port
that
is
often
blanketed
in
soot
in
a
country
where
power
failures
are
a
regular
problem
many
households
regularly
use
polluting
diesel
generators
to
produce
power
nigeria
in
signed
the
paris
agreement
which
aims
to
hold
global
warming
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
under
pressure
from
activists
for
cleaner
energy
and
sustainability
groups
who
have
said
better
incentives
and
penalties
are
needed
to
drive
effective
green
action
but
the
transition
to
lower
emissions
will
require
capital
officials
warned
each
sector
like
agriculture
power
transport
has
its
own
strategies
to
encourage
cleaner
energy
rather
than
use
of
fossil
fuels
but
these
solutions
are
capital
intensive
warned
ikenna
ofoegbu
of
the
german
heinrich
boll
foundation
for
instance
it
is
cheaper
for
international
oil
companies
iocs
to
flare
natural
gas
than
recycling
it
because
there
is
no
extensive
infrastructure
and
it
is
hard
to
find
a
market
for
people
to
buy
flared
gas
he
said
legislation
in
nigeria
also
favours
electrical
distribution
companies
that
rely
on
fossil
fuels
over
operators
using
solar
panels
ofoegbu
said
that
s
in
part
because
powerful
elites
own
the
traditional
distribution
companies
and
regularly
lobby
to
keep
the
existing
system
in
place
he
said
for
instance
a
operator
who
wants
to
generate
more
than
a
megawatt
of
clean
power
has
to
do
so
at
least
km
away
from
distribution
lines
he
said
solar
panels
also
can
be
expensive
to
import
nigeria
has
no
customs
duty
on
renewable
energy
devices
but
the
economic
community
of
west
african
states
ecowas
of
which
it
is
a
member
stipulates
a
percent
customs
duty
on
some
types
of
devices
ofeogbu
said
if
better
incentives
for
clean
energy
were
put
in
place
more
people
will
pack
up
their
generators
and
get
solar
panels
ofoegbu
said
but
people
need
to
be
able
to
afford
it
and
one
of
the
biggest
issues
is
the
cost
of
import
to
achieve
its
emissions
goals
nigeria
also
needs
to
look
at
things
like
tree
planting
perhaps
requiring
that
a
tree
be
planted
for
each
one
cut
and
encouraging
the
use
of
clean
cooking
stoves
to
cut
firewood
use
he
said
but
sowah
added
significant
political
willpower
will
be
needed
to
enforce
any
policy
