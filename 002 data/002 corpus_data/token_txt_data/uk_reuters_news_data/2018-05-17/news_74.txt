desert
khadija
ghouate
never
imagined
that
the
fog
enveloping
the
nearby
peaks
would
change
her
life
for
hours
every
day
and
often
before
sunrise
ghouate
and
other
women
from
nearby
villages
would
walk
km
miles
to
fetch
water
from
open
wells
with
girls
pulled
out
of
school
to
help
and
at
risk
of
violence
on
the
lonely
treks
but
with
groundwater
levels
dropping
due
to
overuse
drought
and
climate
change
the
challenge
to
get
enough
water
daily
was
becoming
harder
and
almost
half
of
people
in
the
local
area
sold
up
and
quit
rural
life
after
generations
for
the
city
as
the
future
of
the
traditional
berber
region
by
mount
boutmezguida
floundered
a
mathematician
whose
family
came
from
the
area
had
a
eureka
moment
gleaned
from
living
overseas
using
fog
to
make
water
now
ghouate
s
village
is
connected
to
the
world
s
largest
functioning
fog
collection
project
alleviating
the
need
to
collect
water
that
fell
mainly
on
women
and
with
equipment
setting
an
example
for
other
projects
globally
you
always
had
to
go
to
the
wells
always
be
there

said
ghouate
a
as
she
prepared
lunch
for
her
family
showing
off
the
tap
in
her
home
but
now
water
has
arrived
in
our
house
i
like
fog
a
lot
the
project
running
since
after
nine
years
of
surveys
and
tests
was
founded
by
the
moroccan
organisation
dar
si
hmad
which
works
to
promote
and
preserve
local
culture
history
and
heritage
it
was
the
brainchild
of
mathematician
and
businessman
aissa
derhem
whose
parents
were
originally
from
mount
boutmezguida
where
the
slopes
are
covered
in
mist
on
average
days
a
year
derhem
first
came
across
fog
collection
when
he
learnt
of
one
of
the
world
s
first
projects
in
chile
s
atacama
desert
while
he
living
in
canada
in
the
studying
for
his
phd
but
it
was
not
until
visiting
his
parents
village
years
later
that
he
realised
the
mountainous
location
situated
at
the
edge
of
the
sahara
and
about
km
miles
from
the
atlantic
ocean
was
perfect
for
fog
mist
accumulates
in
coastal
areas
where
a
cold
sea
current
an
anticyclone
and
a
land
obstacle
such
as
a
mountain
range
combine
when
the
sea
water
evaporates
the
anticyclone
stops
it
from
becoming
rain
and
when
it
hits
the
mountain
that
s
where
it
can
be
gathered
derhem
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
looking
out
from
the
top
of
mount
boutmezguida
besides
a
small
building
used
as
a
fog
observatory
and
tool
deposit
if
we
look
at
the
planet
we
see
this
happening
in
all
tropical
regions
in
chile
and
peru
in
latin
america
the
kalahari
desert
in
africa
in
western
australia
around
the
thar
desert
in
india
and
in
california
he
listed
as
examples
developed
in
south
america
in
the
fog
collection
projects
have
since
spread
globally
to
countries
including
guatemala
ghana
eritrea
nepal
and
the
united
states
in
morocco
dar
si
hmad
has
built
a
system
of
nets
stretching
about
square
metres
about
tennis
courts
these
nets
are
hung
between
two
poles
and
when
wind
pushes
the
fog
through
the
mesh
water
droplets
are
trapped
condense
and
fall
into
a
container
at
the
bottom
of
the
unit
with
pipes
connecting
the
water
to
reservoirs
derhem
hopes
the
success
of
the
mount
boutmezguida
scheme
can
help
other
areas
in
west
africa
and
in
north
africa
where
the
united
nation
s
food
and
agriculture
organization
fao
says
fresh
water
resources
are
among
the
world
s
lowest
studies
show
climate
change
impacting
water
patterns
globally
and
derhem
said
in
morocco
levels
have
dropped
to
about
cubic
metres
a
person
a
year
from
about
cubic
metres
a
person
in
the
on
calculations
based
on
government
figures
the
principles
behind
fog
collection
are
simple
and
throughout
nature
examples
exist
of
creatures
capturing
moisture
from
the
air
in
the
most
arid
conditions
ranging
from
beetles
in
the
namib
desert
to
lizards
in
the
australian
outback
but
creating
a
water
collection
project
on
a
large
scale
comes
with
challenges
as
the
research
and
development
as
well
as
the
infrastructure
and
technology
involved
in
expanding
and
developing
fog
collection
projects
can
be
costly
the
project
at
mount
boutmezguida
however
has
been
a
trailblazer
for
other
projects
due
to
its
equipment
according
to
its
founders
the
original
nets
used
were
insufficiently
resistant
to
the
high
winds
and
tore
but
a
partnership
with
the
german
waterfoundation
allowed
dar
si
hmad
to
develop
a
stronger
net
the
cloudfisher
was
described
by
the
waterfoundation
as
the
first
fog
collector
that
can
withstand
wind
speeds
of
up
kph
with
flexible
troughs
following
the
movement
of
the
net
in
the
wind
now
collected
water
is
filtered
and
combined
with
underground
water
before
being
distributed
to
villages
on
the
grid
with
homes
paying
for
water
through
a
system
the
initial
pilot
project
served
five
villages
at
present
the
square
metres
of
nets
installed
reach
about
families
villages
while
a
second
set
of
nets
is
being
built
fog
is
like
aeroplanes
at
the
start
at
the
beginning
they
were
only
little
toys
but
with
some
effort
things
have
changed
but
it
needs
investment
said
derhem
along
the
coast
there
is
three
times
as
much
fog
as
there
is
available
on
mount
boutmezguida
the
government
spends
millions
for
water
desalination
processes
this
is
something
that
is
worth
for
with
dry
wells
comes
anxiety
and
risk
but
also
the
unravelling
of
traditional
livelihoods
and
communities
mohamed
zabour
president
of
the
local
municipality
said
more
than
percent
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
live
without
running
water
in
their
homes
between
and
of
the
local
residents
moved
to
cities
our
region
is
rich
but
it
needs
infrastructure
and
water
is
one
of
the
priorities
said
zabour
if
we
don
t
find
a
solution
in
the
next
years
it
s
going
to
be
a
catastrophe
it
s
going
to
be
like
a
desert
for
ghouate
the
fog
scheme
has
improved
village
life
when
we
were
kids
we
didn
t
even
know
what
it
meant
to
need
water
now
there
is
less
rain
and
if
i
still
had
to
go
to
the
wells
i
wouldn
t
find
much
water
now
she
said
everything
is
about
water
everything
i
do
have
to
worry
about
it
anymore
