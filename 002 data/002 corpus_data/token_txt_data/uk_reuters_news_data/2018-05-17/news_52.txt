french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
thursday
europe
would
try
to
protect
its
companies
doing
business
with
iran
from
sanctions
reimposed
over
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
but
said
giants
like
total
would
make
their
own
choices
macron
s
spoke
as
the
world
s
largest
container
shipping
firm
followed
the
french
oil
major
in
saying
it
would
quit
iran
denting
eu
efforts
to
save
the
nuclear
accord
with
tehran
and
protect
european
companies
doing
business
with
the
islamic
republic
international
companies
with
interests
in
many
countries
make
their
own
choices
according
to
their
own
interests
they
should
continue
to
have
this
freedom
he
said
on
arriving
for
a
second
day
of
eu
leaders
talks
in
the
bulgarian
capital
but
what
is
important
is
that
companies
and
especially
companies
which
are
perhaps
less
exposed
to
other
markets
american
or
others
can
make
this
choice
the
eu
wants
to
salvage
the
iran
nuclear
deal
which
offers
the
islamic
republic
relief
from
economic
sanctions
in
exchange
for
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
and
europe
sees
as
an
important
element
of
international
security
however
eu
officials
say
there
is
no
easy
way
to
protect
eu
firms
from
sanctions
and
that
it
will
take
time
for
the
bloc
to
devise
what
will
likely
be
a
complex
mix
of
national
and
measures
ignoring
european
support
for
the
nuclear
pact
president
donald
trump
branded
the
agreement
as
the
worst
deal
ever
and
announced
on
may
the
united
states
was
pulling
out
total
on
wednesday
said
it
might
quit
a
gas
project
unless
it
secured
a
waiver
from
sanctions
tehran
had
repeatedly
hailed
the
project
as
a
symbol
of
the
nuclear
accord
s
success
ceo
soren
skou
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
was
following
suit
with
the
sanctions
the
americans
are
to
impose
you
can
t
do
business
in
iran
if
you
also
have
business
in
the
and
we
have
that
on
a
large
scale
skou
told
reuters
in
an
interview
following
the
firm
s
report
i
don
t
know
the
exact
timing
details
but
i
am
certain
that
we
re
also
going
to
shut
down
in
iran
skou
said
finnish
mining
technology
company
outotec
said
sanctions
would
slow
down
and
complicate
its
ties
with
iran
but
it
was
too
early
to
say
if
it
would
leave
macron
voicing
understanding
for
big
companies
anxious
to
protect
their
sales
said
france
backed
proposals
by
the
european
commission
to
protect
and
compensate
european
companies
that
might
be
hit
by
sanctions
for
trading
with
iran
they
are
all
but
certain
to
fall
short
of
the
type
of
firm
guarantees
that
the
iranian
authorities
have
been
seeking
president
hassan
rouhani
has
said
iran
would
remain
committed
to
the
deal
which
china
russia
britain
france
and
germany
also
signed
provided
those
powers
ensured
iran
was
protected
from
sanctions
