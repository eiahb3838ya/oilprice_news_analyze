mexico's landmark energy reforms are mired in regulatory delays
mexico
city
may
reuters
oil
firms
that
have
won
drilling
rights
during
mexico
s
landmark
energy
reforms
have
made
little
progress
on
developing
about
of
the
projects
because
of
the
nation
s
tangled
regulatory
regime
according
to
company
executives
and
government
data
mexico
has
auctioned
off
more
than
contracts
to
foreign
and
local
companies
since
president
enrique
pena
nieto
started
opening
the
nation
s
oil
fields
to
foreign
investment
in
a
new
oil
regulatory
framework
much
of
it
adapted
from
existing
rules
has
kept
most
of
that
oil
in
the
ground
the
data
show
that
s
delaying
potential
benefits
to
mexico
and
could
make
the
reforms
that
much
easier
to
unwind
if
voters
elect
an
candidate
for
president
when
pena
nieto
leaves
office
at
the
end
of
november
securing
approvals
is
a
cumbersome
and
arduous
process
resulting
in
a
significant
choke
point
for
drilling
wells
said
craig
steinke
chief
executive
of
renaissance
oil
corp
which
has
five
projects
in
mexico
three
of
them
stalled
in
permitting
it
takes
three
days
to
get
needed
drilling
permits
for
a
well
in
alberta
canada
compared
to
the
more
than
a
year
in
mexico
steinke
said
through
the
life
of
a
project
oil
firms
are
required
to
submit
more
than
separate
documents
to
about
a
dozen
government
agencies
overseeing
offshore
and
onshore
developments
before
mexico
s
energy
reforms
oil
firm
petroleos
mexicanos
known
as
pemex
was
the
sole
operator
and
largely
regulated
itself
the
opening
of
development
rights
to
private
firms
ushered
in
a
new
regulator
known
as
asea
operating
under
a
presidential
appointee
with
sweeping
powers
but
also
a
legacy
of
bureaucratic
constraints
asea
mexico
s
safety
energy
and
environment
regulator
must
decide
on
about
permits
for
each
project
according
to
marco
cota
a
former
head
of
exploration
and
production
for
the
energy
ministry
who
now
advises
oil
companies
on
regulatory
compliance
many
of
the
agency
s
industrial
safety
regulations
were
inherited
from
the
environment
ministry
and
duplicate
paperwork
required
by
other
agencies
he
said
asea
director
carlos
de
regules
a
former
pemex
official
conceded
in
an
interview
that
the
agency
s
has
been
too
slow
he
said
he
is
working
to
cut
permit
reviews
to
days
by
september
compared
to
the
current
process
that
can
stretch
nearly
a
the
regulatory
framework
is
very
complicated
and
it
forces
us
to
take
more
time
than
in
principle
should
be
necessary
to
evaluate
a
project
he
said
of
rules
in
place
since
the
energy
reform
laws
were
enacted
we
are
obligated
to
ask
seven
times
for
the
same
evaluations
can
take
about
six
months
for
environmental
impacts
and
three
months
for
a
final
drilling
permit
just
two
of
the
approvals
required
before
work
can
begin
on
a
new
well
companies
also
must
show
they
have
insurance
policies
and
industrial
safety
and
environmental
protection
plans
approved
and
in
place
for
each
project
the
latter
requires
companies
to
submit
reams
of
supplemental
documents
such
as
safety
manuals
the
delays
stem
in
large
part
from
the
fact
that
asea
is
adapting
and
interpreting
laws
originally
written
for
general
environmental
protections
and
were
not
specific
to
the
energy
industry
said
layla
vargas
who
works
with
oil
companies
to
meet
government
regulations
what
they
ve
had
to
do
is
to
fit
the
energy
sector
said
cota
staffing
shortages
are
another
major
bottleneck
the
regulator
has
employees
who
handle
approvals
for
more
than
project
applications
since
the
opening
ranging
from
retail
gas
stations
to
dollar
drilling
projects
permits
for
a
service
station
can
take
as
much
as
seven
months
to
approve
according
to
the
agency
the
organization
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
which
promotes
economic
development
last
fall
called
for
asea
to
have
more
institutional
agility
and
autonomy
in
its
evaluation
of
mexico
s
energy
regulators
asea
s
administrative
complexity
is
the
biggest
challenge
to
getting
oil
and
gas
projects
underway
said
renaissance
oil
s
steinke
and
other
oil
company
executives
so
far
asea
has
signed
off
on
insurance
policies
for
of
oil
and
gas
contracts
awarded
the
companies
management
system
a
custom
plan
for
mitigating
risks
in
environmental
health
and
safety
areas
has
been
authorized
for
projects
approvals
for
both
are
needed
before
drilling
can
begin
to
date
exploration
and
production
projects
won
at
auction
by
international
oil
firms
including
exxon
mobil
and
royal
dutch
shell
are
in
various
stages
of
regulatory
process
the
numbers
of
approvals
are
not
great
said
a
senior
executive
at
an
oil
major
who
oversees
contracts
in
mexico
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
at
least
one
oil
company
said
it
has
not
had
problems
with
unreasonable
delays
we
ve
had
a
good
experience
in
mexico
said
felipe
arbalaez
bp
plc
s
president
for
latin
america
the
regulators
have
given
us
approvals
at
the
appropriate
time
he
added
referring
to
the
british
company
s
shallow
water
hokchi
project
which
is
run
by
its
argentine
unit
pan
american
energy
but
john
padilla
a
oil
consultant
with
ipd
latin
america
said
oil
companies
who
bet
big
on
the
mexican
opening
are
increasingly
concerned
about
the
political
and
regulatory
risks
no
one
s
jumping
ship
he
said
but
when
you
have
billions
of
dollars
of
investment
at
stake
you
can
be
damn
sure
that
every
board
out
there
around
the
globe
that
has
investments
in
mexico
is
going
to
be
paying
close
attention
to
additional
reporting
