rosneft
is
concerned
that
its
recent
drilling
in
an

that
is
claimed
by

could
upset
beijing
two

its

without
the

of
the
chinese
government
carry
out
oil

exploration

soverign
and
jurisdictional
rights
and
not
do
anything
that
could
impact
bilateral
relations
or
this

china

marks
a
vast
expanses
of
the
south
china
sea
that
it
claims
including
large
swathes
of
vietnam
s
exclusive
economic
zone
maps
of
the
area
indicate
the
block
is
around
kms
miles
inside
the
contested
area
a
series
of
dashes
the
line
is
not
continuous
making
china
s
claims
often
ambiguous
in
recent
years
though
china
has
increasingly
patrolled
and
enforced
the
area
claiming
historic
rights
to
the
resources
and
features
within
it
in
march
vietnam
halted
an
oil
drilling
project
in
the
nearby
red

block
following
pressure
from
china
sources
told
reuters
that
block
is
licensed
to
spanish
energy
firm
repsol
which
has
asked
vietnam
to
pay
compensation
over
the
issue
the

russia

foreign
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request

fearing
repercussions
and
pressure
from
china
rosneft
vietnam
had
wanted
to
begin
drilling
with
as
little
attention
as
possible
despite
the
statement
by
its
parent
company
on
tuesday
the
sources
said
on
thursday
its
parent
company
said
its
drilling
in
the
block
was
within
vietnam
s
territorial
waters
and
in
accordance
with
vietnamese
legislation
both
rosneft
and
russia
s
gazprom
have
significant
development
projects
in
vietnamese
waters
that
fall
within
the
area
claimed
by
china
said
ian
storey
a
region
security
expert
at
singapore
s
ishak
institute
although
russian
diplomats
have
privately
expressed
concerns
to
their
counterparts
that
china
may
one
day
put
pressure
on
moscow
to
terminate
those
projects
so
far
beijing
has
refrained
from
doing
so
because
of
the
strategic
partnership
between
the
two
countries
said
storey
it
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
burgeoning
entente
if
beijing
asked
moscow
to
end
its
energy
projects
in
china
has
become
russia
s
top
destination
for
exports
largely
because
russia
is
the
largest
supplier
of
oil
and
gas
to
china
mainly
through
pipelines
the
drilling
in
the
red
orchid
gas
field
within
the
block
will
be
undertaken
using
the
equipment
made
by
japanese

the
drilling
is
significant
for
vietnam
which
has
been
struggling
to
maintain
its
crude
oil
and
gas
output
amid
already
declining
production
from
its
key
fields
and
the
continuing
pressure
from
