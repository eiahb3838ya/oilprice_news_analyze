as oil rises, warnings emerge from u.s. retailers
new
york
reuters
worries
about
rising
oil
prices
have
begun
to
creep
into
retailers
earnings
calls
and
investors
are
raising
concerns
that
those
costs
may
slow
discretionary
spending
among
americans
and
push
down
the
performance
of
the
retailers
shares
oil
prices
climbed
on
thursday
to
their
highest
levels
since
november
with
brent
crude
touching
per
barrel
and
west
texas
intermediate
wti
surpassing
per
barrel
retailers
have
begun
to
address
the
possible
impact
of
oil
s
rise
on
their
businesses
in
a
media
call
after
its
quarterly
report
on
thursday
walmart
inc
said
some
consumers
may
be
feeling
pressure
from
higher
gas
prices
though
demand
remained
strong
walmart
and
home
depot
inc
also
have
pointed
to
increased
transportation
costs
stemming
from
more
expensive
fuel
and
a
shortage
of
drivers
factors
that
have
put
pressure
on
their
margins
walmart
s
lower
margins
sent
its
shares
falling
percent
on
thursday
though
consumer
sentiment
remains
strong
for
now
several
investors
said
oil
prices
could
threaten
consumer
spending
if
they
continue
to
rise
offsetting
the
positive
effects
of
s
tax
overhaul
the
numbers
now
are
pretty
dramatic
in
terms
of
the
price
of
oil
so
it
is
going
to
continuously
feed
in
over
the
next
few
months
and
people
are
going
to
notice
said
david
joy
chief
market
strategist
at
ameriprise
financial
in
boston
several
investors
pointed
to
per
barrel
for
wti
crude
as
the
threshold
that
could
dampen
consumer
spending
i
think
another
would
put
the
issue
into
sharper
perspective
for
more
people
said
john
carey
a
portfolio
manager
at
amundi
pioneer
asset
management
in
boston
but
the
effects
of
more
expensive
oil
may
vary
from
retailer
to
retailer
a
store
like
walmart
will
feel
it
before
a
store
like
macy
s
said
kinahan
chief
market
strategist
at
td
ameritrade
in
chicago
because
macy
s
attracts
comparatively
more
wealthy
customers
macy
s
inc
shares
jumped
percent
on
wednesday
after
the
department
store
reported
robust
sales
growth
in
its
results
discount
retailers
such
as
dollar
general
corp
may
also
be
among
the
first
to
feel
a
pinch
from
rising
oil
as
shoppers
cut
back
on
spending
kinahan
said
but
if
oil
continues
to
climb
those
stores
along
with
walmart
may
eventually
see
benefits
as
consumers
tighten
their
belts
and
look
for
deals
he
added
indeed
other
investors
said
some
retailers
may
show
resilience
as
oil
takes
up
more
of
consumers
budgets
you
have
to
look
at
each
company
individually
said
oliver
pursche
chief
market
strategist
at
bruderman
asset
management
in
new
york
i
continue
to
think
that
consumer
discretionary
companies
with
pricing
power
should
fare
