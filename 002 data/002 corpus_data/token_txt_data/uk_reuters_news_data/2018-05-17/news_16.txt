reuters
the
planned
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
from
russia
to
germany
raises
intelligence
and
military
concerns
since
it
would
allow
moscow
to
place
new
listening
and
monitoring
technology
in
the
baltic
sea
a
senior
official
said
on
thursday
sandra
oudkirk
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
energy
diplomacy
said
in
berlin
that
she
would
meet
german
officials
to
voice
washington
s
concerns
about
the
subsea
project
a
consortium
of
western
companies
and
russia
s
gazprom
said
this
week
it
was
starting
preparatory
work
on
the
project
off
germany
s
baltic
coast
oudkirk
told
reporters
that
the
congress
had
given
the
president
new
authorities
to
impose
sanctions
against
a
variety
of
russian
pipeline
projects
any
companies
involved
in
such
projects
were
in
an
elevated
position
of
sanctions
risk
she
said
however
she
added
that
washington
was
focused
on
using
diplomatic
means
to
halt
nord
stream
one
of
several
russian
projects
to
export
gas
to
western
europe
via
routes
avoiding
ukraine
with
which
moscow
is
involved
in
a
series
of
disputes
oudkirk
said
washington
s
objections
included
past
russian
moves
to
turn
off
gas
supplies
to
ukraine
and
other
countries
adding
that
it
perpetuate
vulnerabilities
in
ties
for
another
to
years
the
united
states
also
opposes
the
turkstream
land
pipeline
that
would
run
through
turkey
for
the
same
reasons
she
said
she
said
the
baltic
was
a
congested
sensitive
military
area
when
we
look
at
the
ability
of
governments
and
companies
to
use
infrastructure
deployments
as
a
means
to
convey
devices
and
technologies
that
can
listen
and
follow
and
monitor
that
is
a
concern
with
regard
to
this
particular
undersea
pipeline
project
in
the
baltic
the
new
project
would
permit
new
technologies
to
be
placed
along
the
pipeline
route
and
that
is
a
threat
she
said
oudkirk
rejected
speculation
that
washington
was
opposing
the
pipeline
to
help
liquefied
natural
gas
exports
the
nord
stream
project
has
said
it
will
tap
banks
for
financing
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
or
early
next
year
denmark
must
still
rule
whether
the
pipeline
can
be
built
near
its
coast
and
other
routine
permissioning
processes
are
still
under
way
in
sweden
and
russia
oudkirk
said
washington
supported
a
baltic
pipe
pipeline
project
because
it
would
diversify
sources
and
routes
the
project
to
be
built
by
is
poland
s
flagship
project
aimed
at
reducing
reliance
on
russian
gas
gazprom
s
western
partners
are
energy
companies
