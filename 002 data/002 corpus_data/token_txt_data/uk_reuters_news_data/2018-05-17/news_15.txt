to
see
it
was
pretty
simple
to
show
we
hadn
t
taken
an
increase
in
a
few
years
the
hikes
should
cover
the
new
freight
costs
which
are
likely
to
remain
high
romanzi
said
changes
in
trade
promotions
have
been
underway
for
months
and
the
company
does
not
anticipate
any
further
price
increases
this
year
he
added
costs
for
making
canned
goods
have
also
risen
due
to
new
tariffs
from
the
trump
administration
on
steel
and
aluminum
those
have
largely
been
tempered
by
relatively
benign
inflation
in
other
key
commodities
