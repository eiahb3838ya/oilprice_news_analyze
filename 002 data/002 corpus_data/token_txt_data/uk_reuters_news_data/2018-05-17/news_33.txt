phoenix from the ashes: investors pile into smaller european oil groups
london
reuters
investors
have
sent
shares
in
european
oil
exploration
and
production
e
p
focussed
companies
like
premier
tullow
enquest
and
faroe
soaring
and
some
fund
managers
say
they
have
not
peaked
yet
shares
in
smaller
and
british
oil
companies
are
outperforming
the
london
ftse
blue
chip
index
and
their
larger
competitors
riding
the
wave
of
rising
oil
prices
much
higher
than
oil
majors
the
sector
has
performed
quite
well
but
not
as
well
as
it
might
have
done
we
ve
only
just
started
the
rally
said
paul
mumford
senior
fund
manager
at
cavendish
asset
management
who
is
invested
in
faroe
enquest
tullow
hurricane
energy
and
cairn
energy
and
other
smaller
e
p
groups
i
tend
not
to
do
majors
you
re
not
going
to
make
ten
times
your
money
with
bp
and
shell
whereas
with
some
of
the
smaller
companies
you
will
do
that
it
s
a
very
interesting
undervalued
part
of
the
smaller
e
p
companies
have
direct
exposure
to
oil
prices
reflected
in
benchmark
brent
futures
which
have
risen
by
around
a
quarter
towards
a
barrel
in
the
past
three
months
levels
last
seen
in
late
morgan
stanley
which
sees
oil
prices
rising
to
a
barrel
in
said
in
a
note
this
week
it
was
time
to
increase
e
p
exposure
raising
e
ps
rating
to
attractive
an
index
of
larger
european
oil
and
gas
companies
most
of
which
include
refining
and
marketing
operations
known
as
downstream
rose
by
around
a
fifth
in
the
past
three
months
meanwhile
pure
e
ps
like
premier
rose
by
around
percent
tullow
by
percent
faroe
by
percent
and
enquest
by
almost
percent
an
index
of
smaller
oil
and
gas
groups
rose
by
around
percent
low
oil
prices
hit
e
ps
harder
than
integrated
oil
companies
like
the
majors
whose
downstream
activities
worked
as
a
natural
hedge
when
oil
prices
slumped
starting
in
with
projects
planned
at
a
time
of
high
oil
prices
balance
sheets
came
under
pressure
and
debt
mushroomed
our
sector
has
been
unloved
for
a
long
time
said
nathan
piper
who
analyses
oil
companies
for
rbc
now
they
are
loved
with
some
of
these
companies
which
people
thought
would
go
out
of
business
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
oil
prices
were
low
cost
cuts
and
asset
sales
were
the
main
way
for
companies
trying
to
juggle
rising
debt
operating
expenditure
and
lower
revenues
higher
oil
prices
will
allow
debt
piles
to
shrink
faster
a
focus
for
investors
barclays
said
this
week
that
higher
oil
price
assumptions
had
led
it
to
raise
cash
flow
and
price
targets
across
our
coverage
group
with
oil
producers
benefiting
the
most
current
positive
momentum
is
encouraging
investors
to
revisit
the
tullow
with
debt
still
at
billion
announced
last
month
it
swung
back
to
profit
after
three
years
in
the
red
and
is
considering
resuming
dividend
payments
frozen
in
companies
can
carry
forward
tax
losses
allowing
groups
to
offset
rising
revenue
in
periods
against
previous
years
losses
a
double
advantage
for
oil
companies
solely
or
mainly
operating
in
britain
enquest
which
is
saddled
with
around
billion
in
debt
had
corporate
tax
losses
of
over
billion
at
the
end
of
so
it
will
most
likely
not
pay
any
material
corporate
tax
on
british
operations
for
the
foreseeable
future
a
spokesman
said
premier
carrying
billion
in
debt
had
billion
of
uk
tax
losses
and
allowances
to
carry
forward
it
is
ramping
up
its

looking
to

premier
chief
executive
tony
durrant
told
reuters
investors
are
starting
to
realise
the
sector
is
undervalued
and
that
he
sees
rising
interest
from
generalist
fund
managers
investor
sentiment
towards
the
sector
is
only
just
recovering
we
were
hit
very
hard
on
the
downturn
because
we
were
leveraged
the
logic
is
we
ve
got
further
to
go
on
the
way
back
up
over
the
coming
weeks
you
ll
see
some
disclosable
interest
from
some
quite
large
institutional
but
some
investors
are
more
reserved
allianz

he
would
like
to
see

valuations
underpinned
by
