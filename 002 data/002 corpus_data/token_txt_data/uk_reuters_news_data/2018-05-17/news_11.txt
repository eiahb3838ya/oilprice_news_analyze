u.s. power grid ready for summer, but calif. & texas are concerns -ferc
reuters
most
regions
are
prepared
to
meet
power
and
natural
gas
demand
this
summer
but
shortages
are
possible
in
southern
california
due
to
low
hydropower
and
gas
supplies
and
texas
following
the
retirement
of
several
coal
plants
federal
energy
regulators
said
in
a
report
on
thursday
in
southern
california
staff
at
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
said
hydro
generation
may
create
challenges
as
natural
generation
the
replacement
for
hydro
production
shortfalls
in
past
years
may
be
limited
due
to
reduced
gas
storage
capacity
and
local
pipeline
outages
in
the
region
nationwide
the
staff
said
north
american
reliability
coordinators
forecast
demand
for
electricity
from
the
grid
would
be
about
the
same
as
last
summer
due
to
increased
use
of
demand
response
programs
to
reduce
usage
and
distributed
energy
resources
like
home
solar
panels
if
the
forecasts
for
warmer
than
normal
weather
this
summer
are
correct
the
report
said
gas
burned
to
produce
electricity
could
top
s
record
high
due
to
the
addition
of
over
megawatts
of
new
generation
and
low
gas
prices
making
gas
a
cheaper
fuel
than
coal
in
many
regions
one
megawatt
can
power
about
homes
the
report
said
energy
firms
were
expected
to
add
over
mw
of
mostly
gas
and
renewable
generation
through
the
end
of
the
summer
that
new
capacity
will
replace
much
of
the
roughly
mw
of
generation
that
has
retired
since
may
including
about
mw
of
capacity
but
the
new
plants
are
not
necessarily
located
where
the
old
plants
retired
the
shutdown
over
the
past
six
months
of
the
big
brown
monticello
and
sandow
coal
plants
in
texas
helped
cut
its
reserve
margin
to
percent
which
is
below
the
grid
s
percent
target
the
texas
grid
operator
the
electric
reliability
council
of
texas
ercot
said
it
expects
to
have
sufficient
operational
tools
to
manage
tight
reserves
and
maintain
system
reliability
those
tools
include
using
a
previously
mothballed
power
plant
imports
from
other
regions
and
consumer
conservation
and
demand
response
efforts
in
california
the
grid
operator
said
it
also
expects
to
use
demand
response
programs
and
consumer
conservation
to
mitigate
tight
supply
conditions
this
summer
gas
supplies
in
southern
california
are
expected
to
remain
tight
this
summer
due
to
limitations
on
aliso
canyon
the
biggest
gas
storage
field
in
the
state
and
gas
pipeline
outages
and
reductions
