update 4-maersk warns on trade risks as disappointing q1 earnings hit share price
copenhagen
reuters
missed
profit
expectations
on
thursday
and
warned
that
political
and
trade
tensions
clouded
the
outlook
sending
shares
in
the
world
s
biggest
container
shipper
sharply
lower
earnings
before
interest
tax
depreciation
and
amortisation
ebitda
for
the
three
months
to
march
rose
percent
to
million
million
but
came
in
well
below
the
million
forecast
by
analysts
in
a
reuters
poll
chief
executive
soren
skou
called
the
result
unsatisfactory
but
said
he
still
expected
ebitda
for
the
year
at
billion
maersk
shares
fell
almost
percent
after
the
results
to
near
lows
although
quarterly
revenue
at
billion
topped
analysts
forecasts
of
billion
by
gmt
the
shares
were
down
percent
at
danish
crowns
analysts
at
jefferies
said
disappointment
stemmed
in
part
from
relatively
sluggish
underlying
volume
growth
of
percent
short
of
an
expected
increase
of
percent
container
freight
rates
rose
percent
but
the
cost
of
shipping
a
container
increased
percent
partly
as
a
result
of
higher
oil
prices
skou
said
skou
in
previous
quarters
played
down
the
risk
of
a
global
trade
war
hurting
the
group
s
business
but
on
thursday
noted
increased
uncertainties
due
to
geopolitical
risks
and
trade
we
have
to
admit
that
the
americans
have
taken
a
number
of
initiatives
recently
that
have
caught
us
by
surprise
skou
told
reuters
in
an
interview
the
trade
situation
has
become
more
intense
he
said
adding
it
would
hurt
maersk
s
business
if
trade
talks
between
the
united
states
and
china
ended
in
failure
the
whole
situation
regarding
iran
which
is
pushing
oil
prices
up
is
certainly
also
not
good
for
our
container
business
skou
said
he
added
that
maersk
was
winding
down
its
business
in
iran
following
new
sanctions
i
don
t
know
the
timing
details
exactly
but
i
am
certain
that
we
re
also
going
to
shut
down
in
iran
after
a
slump
in
shipping
and
oil
maersk
is
restructuring
and
divesting
its
energy
businesses
including
oil
exploration
oil
tankers
and
supply
services
to
focus
on
shipping
ports
and
logistics
skou
said
he
would
implement
initiatives
to
improve
profitability
and
lower
unit
costs
which
would
include
keeping
fleet
capacity
unchanged
in
the
next
months
and
no
orders
for
new
ships
for
at
least
months
he
said
he
expected
the
global
fleet
supply
balance
to
improve
significantly
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
and
in
rival
german
container
shipping
line
reported
higher
profits
on
monday
maersk
said
it
still
aimed
to
spin
off
its
oil
drilling
and
oil
supply
services
units
before
the
end
of
the
year
reuters
reported
last
week
that
the
company
is
likely
to
shelve
plans
to
list
the
offshore
drilling
division
because
of
weak
market
conditions
and
extend
the
timeline
to
divest
the
unit
beyond
its
initial
target
of
before
thursday
s
results
maersk
shares
had
already
fallen
percent
from
a
july
peak
when
optimism
about
freight
rates
and
a
turnaround
in
global
container
shipping
began
to
fade
