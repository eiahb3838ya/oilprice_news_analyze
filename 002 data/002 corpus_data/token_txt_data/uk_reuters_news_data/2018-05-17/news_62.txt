explainer-new rules on ship emissions herald sea change for oil market
london

new
rules
coming
into
force
from
to
curb
pollution
produced
by
the
world
s
ships
are
worrying
everyone
from
opec
oil
producers
to
bunker
fuel
sellers
and
shipping
companies
the
regulations
will
slash
emissions
of
sulfur
which
is
blamed
for
causing
respiratory
diseases
and
is
a
component
of
acid
rain
that
damages
vegetation
and
wildlife
but
the
energy
and
shipping
industries
are
say
analysts
with
refiners
likely
to
struggle
to
meet
higher
demand
for
cleaner
fuel
and
few
ships
fitted
with
equipment
to
reduce
sulfur
emissions
this
raises
the
risk
of
a
chaotic
shift
when
the
new
rules
are
implemented
alongside
more
volatility
in
the
oil
market
the
reality
is
that
the
industry
has
already
passed
the
date
beyond
the
smooth
transition
neil
atkinson
head
of
the
oil
industry
and
market
division
at
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
in
april
the
rules
drawn
up
by
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
ban
ships
using
fuel
with
a
sulfur
content
higher
than
percent
compared
to
percent
now
unless
a
vessel
has
equipment
to
clean
up
its
sulfur
emissions
any
vessels
failing
to
comply
will
face
fines
could
find
their
insurance
stops
being
valid
and
might
be
declared
unseaworthy
which
would
bar
them
from
sailing
the
global
shipping
fleet
now
consumes
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
high
sulfur
fuel
oil
but
about
million
bpd
of
that
demand
will
disappear
overnight
according
to
the
average
market
forecast
calculated
by
norway
s
seb
bank
most
demand
is
expected
to
shift
to
marine
gasoil
a
lower
sulfur
distillate
fuel
morgan
stanley
predicts
this
will
generate
at
least
million
bpd
in
extra
demand
for
distillate
in
the
next
three
years
pushing
up
total
distillate
demand
growth
for
the
period
to
million
bpd
that
in
turn
will
drive
up
prices
gasoil
now
trades
at
a
premium
of
about
a
ton
to
fuel
oil
but
the
forward
curve
forecasts
this
will
balloon
to
per
ton
by
early
thomson
reuters
research
estimates
fuel
accounts
for
about
half
a
ship
s
daily
operating
cost
based
on
average
fuel
consumption
of
to
tonnes
a
day
a
ship
using
cleaner
fuel
faces
extra
daily
expenses
of
about
to
for
example
a
vlcc
one
of
the
biggest
oil
tankers
at
sea
will
pay
percent
more
for
its
fuel
or
an
extra
on
top
of
normal
bill
of
million
for
a
typical
voyage
from
the
middle
east
to
japan
shipowners
can
install
kit
called
a
scrubber
that
strips
out
sulfur
emissions
and
allowing
them
to
use
the
dirtier
fuel
oil
some
ships
already
have
them
global
trading
firm
trafigura
has
ordered
scrubbers
for
its
fleet
of
ships
but
the
equipment
alone
can
cost
million
to
million
according
to
manufacturer
wartsila
putting
it
out
of
reach
of
many
operators
by
about
ships
could
have
scrubbers
according
to
wartsila
seb
bank
and
industry
analyst
alphatanker
but
alphatankers
andrew
wilson
called
this
a
drop
in
the
ocean
given
there
are
about
vessels
in
the
global
fleet
of
which
about
ply
international
routes
based
on
the
limited
number
of
manufacturers
and
time
constraints
on
facilities
to
install
scrubbers
alphatanker
estimates
no
more
than
ships
could
be
fitted
each
year
wartsila
puts
the
figure
closer
to
so
it
would
take
more
than
years
to
fit
the
global
fleet
many
vessels
may
try
to
dodge
the
new
rules
unable
to
afford
the
cost
of
scrubbers
and
reluctant
to
pay
the
premium
for
cleaner
fuel
but
how
much
of
the
industry
will
cheat
is
open
to
debate
with
estimates
ranging
from
to
percent
the
imo
says
it
will
ban
ships
that
do
not
have
scrubbers
from
carrying
any
fuel
oil
making
it
easier
to
catch
cheaters
oil
major
bp
expects
percent
of
ships
could
cheat
while
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
expects
a
figure
of
about
percent
when
the
rules
launch
in
consultant
citac
says
industry
polls
indicate
cheating
could
be
in
a
range
of
to
percent
the
global
refining
industry
needs
to
process
an
extra
million
bpd
of
crude
to
make
distillates
for
cleaner
fuel
says
robert
herman
refining
executive
at
phillips
some
refiners
have
invested
in
cutting
sulfur
in
their
output
but
fitting
hydrocracker
or
coker
unit
so
that
a
refinery
produces
more
distillates
with
lower
sulfur
content
while
reducing
fuel
oil
output
can
cost
about
billion
analysts
say
small
refineries
unable
to
afford
the
upgrade
may
find
they
are
churning
out
fuel
oil
without
finding
buyers
a
kbc
consultancy
survey
showed
percent
of
middle
eastern
and
european
refineries
are
not
prepared
european
plants
which
tend
to
be
less
complex
than
those
in
other
regions
produce
more
fuel
oil
and
may
face
the
biggest
challenge
morgan
stanley
says
refineries
of
spain
s
repsol
turkey
s
tupras
india
s
reliance
and
independent
valero
are
among
the
best
prepared
because
they
already
produce
high
middle
distillate
and
low
fuel
oil
the
simplest
way
for
refineries
to
produce
fuel
with
less
sulfur
is
to
buy
and
process
crude
that
contains
less
sulfur
a
shift
that
could
change
demand
for
different
oil
grades
and
lead
to
greater
oil
market
volatility
for
example
processing
iraq
s
basra
heavy
grade
with
high
sulfur
content
produces
as
much
as
percent
fuel
oil
while
using
light
sweet
north
sea
crude
with
less
sulfur
produces
about
percent
fuel
oil
there
will
be
a
bidding
war
for
sweet
crude
said
stephen
george
chief
economist
with
kbc
advanced
technologies
this
could
hike
the
price
of
sweeter
crudes
including
several
grades
used
to
make
dated
brent
the
benchmark
for
three
quarters
of
the
world
s
oil
meanwhile
the
cost
of
refining
sour
crudes
with
more
sulfur
such
as
those
from
venezuela
mexico
and
ecuador
could
be
more
than
its
value
he
said
energy
firms
and
shippers
may
face
a
squeeze
on
margins
but
ultimately
extra
costs
are
likely
to
fall
on
consumers
of
everything
from
household
appliances
to
gasoline
that
are
shipped
around
the
world
roughly
percent
of
world
trade
is
by
sea
wood
mackenzie
estimates
that
global
shipping
fuel
costs
are
likely
to
rise
by
a
quarter
or
billion
in
others
estimate
extra
costs
for
container
shipping
alone
will
be
billion
to
billion
in
addition
a
surge
in
distillate
demand
by
shippers
could
push
up
prices
of
other
products
such
as
jet
fuel
and
diesel
it
s
going
to
make
moving
anything
more
expensive
