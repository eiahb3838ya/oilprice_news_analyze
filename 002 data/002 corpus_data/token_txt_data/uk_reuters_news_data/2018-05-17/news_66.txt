as

from

triggered

on

worries
about
political
risks
had
jolted
italian
markets
and
pressured
the
euro
on
wednesday
following
reports
that
italy
s
movement
and
league
may
ask
the
european
central
bank
to
forgive
billion
euros
of
debt
as
the
parties
worked
to
draft
a
coalition
programme
that
was
enough
to
spook
italian
markets
even
though
the
league
s
economic
spokesman
told
reuters
that
debt
cancellation
was
never
in
an
official
draft
of
a
government
programme
the
two
populist
parties
have
been
holding
talks
aimed
at
forming
a
coalition
government
and
ending
weeks
of
stalemate
following
an
inconclusive

the

yield
set
a
fresh
high
of
percent
in

on
thursday
it
last
stood
near
percent
yields
on
treasuries
have
risen
above
percent
this
week
for
the
firs
time
since
july
continuing
to
weigh
on
stocks
as
investors
considered
whether
government
bonds
might
be
more
attractive
than
riskier
equities
the
rise
in
bond
yields
have
helped
buoy
the
dollar
which
has
gained
percent
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
so
far
in
may
if
the
market
continues
to
trade
off
yields
and
diverging
economic
data
between
the
and
eu
it
s
hard
to
argue
against
the
current
direction
in
yields
or
the
dollar
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
in
for
oanda
in
singapore
said
in
a
note
on
the
economic
data
front
the
consumer
remains
the
economy
s
backbone
and
if
this
robust
trend
in
the
retail
space
continues
to
build
factor
in
a
bit
of
wage
growth
pressure
and
the
dollar
will
continue
to
move
higher
on
the
back
of
higher
yields
innes
added
bond
yields
have
risen
after
data
this
week
showed
a
solid
rise
in
retail
sales
suggesting
the
economy
is
on
a
stronger
footing
