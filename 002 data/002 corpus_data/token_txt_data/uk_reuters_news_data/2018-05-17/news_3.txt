the
rising
treasury
yields
have
been
a
driver
across
financial
markets
this
week
and
come
as
data
shows
a
strong
economy
that
could
indicate
firming
inflation
the
benchmark
treasury
note
yield
rose
above
percent
continuing
a
surge
from
earlier
in
the
week
i
think
it
s
the
same
thing
we
have
had
really
for
the
past
couple
of
weeks
the
inflation
trade
is
being
put
on

todd

the
rise
in

being
driven
by
the
same
backdrop

is
the

hitting
on
all
cylinders

the
rise
in

has
added
a
little
bit
of
volatility
in

question
but
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
enough
to
derail
