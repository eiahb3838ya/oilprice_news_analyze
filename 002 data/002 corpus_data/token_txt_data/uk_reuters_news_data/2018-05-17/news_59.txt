reuters
french
president
emmanuel
macron
said
on
thursday
that
the
european
union
must
protect
eu
companies
doing
business
with
iran
from
sanctions
being
reimposed
over
tehran
s
nuclear
programme
asked
on
arrival
at
a
summit
of
eu
leaders
in
bulgaria
if
he
was
concerned
about
an
announcement
by
french
oil
major
total
that
it
may
pull
out
of
iran
after
washington
pulled
out
of
an
nuclear
accord
macron
said
it
was
up
to
firms
active
in
various
markets
to
make
their
own
decisions
but
while
voicing
understanding
for
big
companies
anxious
to
protect
their
sales
he
added
that
the
eu
must
stand
by
smaller
companies
which
were
willing
to
carry
on
iran
business
international
companies
with
interests
in
many
countries
make
their
own
choices
according
to
their
own
interests
they
should
continue
to
have
this
freedom
he
said
but
what
is
important
is
that
companies
and
especially
companies
which
are
perhaps
less
exposed
to
other
markets
american
or
others
can
make
this
choice
france
macron
said
backed
proposals
by
the
european
commission
to
protect
and
compensate
european
companies
that
might
be
hit
by
sanctions
for
trading
with
iran
in
broader
trade
disputes
with
washington
he
also
called
for
a
complete
exemption
for
the
eu
from
new
steel
tariffs
and
said
europe
must
preserve
its
trade
sovereignty
