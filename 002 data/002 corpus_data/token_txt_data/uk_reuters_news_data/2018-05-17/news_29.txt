dubai
aerospace
enterprise
dae
one
of
the
world
s
largest
aircraft
lessors
is
in
talks
to
buy
jetliners
from
airbus
and
boeing
and
is
prepared
to
expand
its
fleet
through
acquisition
if
talks
fall
through
its
ceo
told
reuters
the
move
comes
months
after
a
leading
airline
investor
orchestrated
a
record
deal
last
november
for
a
group
of
airlines
to
buy
more
than
planes
from
airbus
as
economists
project
strong
growth
for
air
travel
dae
is
interested
in
buying
airbus
and
boeing
max
planes
after
its
acquisition
last
year
of
lessor
awas
dae
chief
executive
firoz
tarapore
said
on
thursday
any
deal
would
not
necessarily
be
evenly
split
between
the
two
planemakers
tarapore
said
adding
that
dae
was
nowhere
near
where
we
thought
we
would
be
in
finalising
an
order
we
are
not
happy
with
the
price
he
said
in
an
interview
at
dae
s
offices
in
dubai
s
financial
district
an
order
for
jets
would
be
worth
more
than
billion
at
list
prices
though
discounts
are
common
for
large
orders
boeing
declined
to
comment
and
airbus
did
not
immediately
respond
to
an
emailed
request
for
comment
a
huge
deal
would
give
dae
a
pipeline
of
directly
ordered
aircraft
on
par
with
its
rivals
though
it
may
have
to
wait
several
years
for
deliveries
to
start
because
manufactures
are
heavily
sold
out
tarapore
told
reuters
last
june
that
dae
was
considering
a
large
order
for
more
than
new
aircraft
with
deliveries
to
start
from
dae
would
look
at
other
options
to
acquire
new
aircraft
if
it
does
not
reach
an
agreement
with
airbus
or
boeing
which
tarapore
said
could
include
acquiring
a
rival
to
gain
access
to
its
order
book
for
aircraft
dae
jetted
into
the
top
tier
of
aircraft
lessors
last
year
when
it
acquired
awas
the
industry
s
firm
at
the
time
the
acquisition
tripled
dae
s
portfolio
to
about
owned
and
managed
aircraft
worth
over
billion
dae
is
operating
very
smoothly
tarapore
said
adding
that
the
integration
of
awas
was
completed
in
february
in
the
meantime
dae
is
considering
issuing
a
million
sukuk
this
year
or
in
and
a
conventional
dollar
bond
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
tarapore
said
the
bond
issues
are
not
dependent
on
finalising
an
aircraft
order
he
added
dae
intends
to
be
a
repeat
benchmark
issuer
in
the
debt
market
he
told
reuters
in
october
a
benchmark
issue
conventionally
means
upwards
of
million
dae
raised
billion
in
the
united
states
through
a
senior
bond
issue
in
to
finance

awas
