while
making
up

the
reduction
levels
proposed
were
far
too
aggressive
it
would
seem
as
though
the

has
simply
taken
the
exact
reduction
levels
it
already
proposed
for
cars
and
vans
and
applied
them
directly
to
vehicles
without
fully
recognising
the
fundamental
differences

for

said
the

fell
short
of
what
was
needed
to
hit
the
eu
s
own
climate
goals
some
eu
countries
and
hauliers
had
called
for
a
target
of

the
proposed
standards
mean
a

which
will
result
in

and
the

missing
out
on

the
commission
expects
its
targets
to
save
around
million
tonnes

of
sweden
the
proposal
will
need
to
be
approved
by
eu
governments
and
the
european
parliament
before
becoming
law
the

also
proposed
an
action
plan
for
the
production
of
battery
cells
for
electric
cars
as
part
of
its
drive
to
slash
transport
emissions
europe
lags
behind
countries
such
as
china
south
korea
and
japan
in
the
production
of
batteries
for
electric
vehicles
and
the
european
car
industry
has
warned
that
the
rush
to
electric
cars
would
hand
even
more
business
to
those
countries
the
commission
s
measures
include
support
for
securing
access
to
the
raw
materials
needed
to
build
batteries
developing
the
necessary
skills
for
the
manufacturing
processes
and
