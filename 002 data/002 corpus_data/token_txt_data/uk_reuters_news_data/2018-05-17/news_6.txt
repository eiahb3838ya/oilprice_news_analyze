analysis-asia oil bill to top $1 trillion a year as crude hits $80
reuters
the
cost
of
asia
s
growing
thirst
for
oil
will
surpass
trillion
billion
this
year
about
twice
as
much
as
in
and
as
oil
prices
touch
per
barrel
and
continental
demand
hits
a
record
oil
prices
have
risen
nearly
percent
since
january
and
topped
per
barrel
in
intraday
trading
on
thursday
for
the
first
time
since
with
the
dollar
in
which
most
oil
is
traded
strengthening
concerns
are
rising
about
the
size
of
the
hit
to
economies
from
higher
energy
prices
especially
in
asia
surging
costs
could
feed
inflation
and
hurt
both
consumers
and
companies
asia
is
most
vulnerable
to
an
oil
price
spike
canadian

capital
markets
warned
in
a
note
this
month
after
oil
prices
hit
their
highest
since
november
consumes
more
than
percent
of
the
million
barrels
of
oil
the
world
uses
each
day
according
to
industry
data
and
its
share
is
steadily
rising
asia
is
also
the
world
s
smallest
region
accounting
for
less
than
percent
of
output

bank
morgan
stanley
said
this
week
that
diesel
use
contributes
percent
to
cash
costs
for
miners
while
oil
contributes
from
percent
to
percent
to
the
cost
of
power
generation
depending
on
a
company
s
or
country
s
fuel
mix
a
rising
oil
price
therefore
shifts
the
entire
cost
curve
higher
it
said
china
is
by
far
asia
s
and
the
world
s
biggest
importer
of
oil
ordering
million
barrels
per
day
in
april
that
s
almost
percent
of
global
consumption
at
current
prices
this
amounts
to
a
chinese
oil
import
bill
of
million
per
day
billion
per
month
a
whopping
billion
a
year
other
asian
countries
are
even
more
exposed
to
rising
oil
prices
most
damage
will
be
done
to
countries
like
india
and
vietnam
which
not
only
rely
heavily
on
imports
but
also
where
national
wealth
is
not
yet
large
enough
to
absorb
sudden
increases
in
fuel
costs
poorer
countries
with
limited
borrowing
capacity
may
face
financing
difficulty
amid
higher
import
bills
rbc
said
unless
fuel
is
heavily
subsidized
households
and
businesses
in
poorer
countries
are
also
more
vulnerable
to
rising
oil
prices
than
they
are
in
wealthier
nations
in
developing
economies
such
as
india
vietnam
or
the
philippines
fuel
costs
eat
up
around
percent
of
an
average
person
salary
according
to
reuters
research
and
figures
from
statistics
portal
numbeo
that
compares
to
just
percent
in
wealthy

the
surge

lbc
has
been
intently
watching
the
movement
of

what
we
at

are
preparing
for
are
the

an

may
have
on
our
carriers

its

said
the
high
oil
price
challenges
us
to
improve
our
own
efficiencies
to
achieve
better
economies
of
scale
and
maintain
our
margins
he
said
some

say
they
will
pass
on
any
higher
costs
to
consumers

said
his
firm
could
be
affected
by
higher
oil
prices
but
we
can
pass
on
the
effect
to
consumer
via
price
others
said
if
they
burden
consumers
with
higher
costs
they
will
lose
clients
ashish

india
said
diesel
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
his
company
s
expenses
and
that
it
was
difficult
to
pass
rising
expenses
on
to
customers
diesel
prices
have
jumped
percent
in
a
year
but
i
couldn
t
raise
freight
charges
by
percent
if
i
charge
more
clients
will
use
cheaper
railroads

company

member
of
bombay

transport
association
said
his
firm
was
already
operating
at
margins
before
prices
rose
the
diesel
price
hike
has
hit
our
business
hard
he
said
many
small
transport
firms
like
his
are
struggling
to
pay
back
bank
loans
they
took
to
buy
given
the
economic
costs
and
its
reliance
on
imports
economists
say
it
is
time
for
asia
to
limit
its
exposure
to
oil
it
is
very
important
for
asia
to
reduce
its
oil
dependency
and
increase
its
energy
efficiency
to
protect
itself
from
future
oil
shocks
