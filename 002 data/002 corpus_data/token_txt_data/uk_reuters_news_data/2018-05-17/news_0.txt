challenge
for

for
their
services
oilfield
executives
said
on
thursday
at
a
conference
in
houston
oilfield
service
suppliers
cut
tens
of
thousands
of
workers
following
the
collapse
and
skilled
employees
have
moved
to
other
industries
or
are
no
longer
interested
a
worker
shortage
is
helping
drive
up
service
costs
for
oil
producers
especially
in
the
hottest
shale
fields
recruitment
and
staffing
is
a
big
challenge
we
re
aggressively
focused
on
recruiting
people
said
kevin
neveu
chief
executive
at
precision
drilling
corp
the
calgary
company
added
about
workers
last
year
oil
prices
have
rebounded
to
over
a
barrel
from
lows
of
around
a
barrel
in
aided
by
rising
global
demand
and
supply
cuts
from
countries
and
other
exporters
that
has
spurred
a
rush
to
drill
new
wells
in
the
permian
basin
of
west
texas
and
new
mexico
and
the
bakken
shale
of
north
dakota
in
texas
the
unemployment
rate
was
percent
in
march
near
its
historic
low
versus
percent
a
year
ago
according
to
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
i
was
quite
shocked
at
how
fast
we
ran
out
of
people
from
our
recall
list
said
mike
nuss
an
executive
vice
president
at
driller
ensign
energy
services
we
ve
had
to
scramble
and
resurrect
our
training
he
said
in
an
interview
at
the
international
association
of
drilling
contractors
conference
a
study
led
last
year
by
the
university
of
houston
found
percent
of
dismissed
workers
had
moved
to
another
industry
and
percent
were
considering
it
while
drillers
hustle
to
secure
more
workers
they
also
need
employees
with
skills
noble
corp
and
general
electric
co
for
example
recently
announced
plans
for
a
fully
digitized
drilling
vessel
we
re
moving
to
an
era
where
the
machines
do
the
work
they
run
the
analysis
and
they
ultimately
do
the
learning
said
bob
newhouse
ceo
of
newhouse
consultants
which
advises
oil
and
gas
companies
we
ve
got
to
have
the
right
people
who
can
look
at
the
data
look
at
the
information
and
make
the
right
although
precision
drilling
fielded
thousands
of
resumes
last
year
neveu
said
he
worries
younger
workers
may
shun
the
industry
due
to
its
reputation
a
big
for
us
is
making
our
industry
attractive
for
the
next
generation
of
people
working
on
rigs
