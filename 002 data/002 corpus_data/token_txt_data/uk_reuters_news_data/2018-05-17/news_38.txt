kazakhstan
aims
to
settle
its
dispute
with
energy
majors
developing
the
karachaganak
gas
condensate
field
within
a
month
the
energy
minister
said
on
thursday
the
former
soviet
republic
expects
a
large
payment
from
the
companies
and
a
higher
share
of
future
revenues
from
the
development
of
one
of
the
central
asian
nation
s
biggest
hydrocarbon
fields
kanat
bozumbayev
told
reuters
kazakhstan
said
in
it
disagreed
with
how
the
consortium
led
by
italy
s
eni
and
bg
which
has
since
been
taken
over
by
firm
shell
calculated
the
parties
shares
in
the
income
from
the
karachaganak
field
settling
the
dispute
which
according
to
lukoil
another
partner
in
the
project
involved
a
billion
claim
could
pave
way
for
expanding
the
project
at
karachaganak
and
secure
higher
revenue
for
the
kazakh
government
the
talks
are
in
the
final
stage
there
are
optimistic
expectations
that
they
will
be
concluded
within
a
month
the
minister
said
in
an
interview
we
have
agreed
the
key
principles
but
there
are
technical
foreign
firms
are
developing
karachaganak
under
a
production
sharing
agreement
that
allows
them
to
recover
some
costs
before
sharing
a
part
of
the
remaining
revenue
with
the
state
but
arguments
about
what
costs
are
eligible
for
recovery
can
become
tricky
and
technical
bozumbayev
said
that
kazakhstan
was
seeking
compensation
for
the
past
years
saying
the
figure
was
more
than
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
without
naming
a
precise
number
he
said
kazakhstan
had
also
demanded
that
they
change
the
way
profit
share
for
the
parties
was
calculated
in
future
we
can
say
we
have
almost
agreed
the
sum
of
the
compensation
and
reached
a
compromise
on
the
calculation
method
some
of
our
demands
are
being
met
roughly
a
half
of
them
the
minister
said
bozumbayev
said
there
could
also
be
other
forms
of
compensation
such
as
a
loan
for
constructing
an
oil
refinery
and
supplies
of
oil
and
gas
for
the
domestic
market
in
addition
he
said
there
could
be
other
investment
commitments
