german
environment
minister
svenja
schulze
urged
carmakers
to
speed
up
technical
refits
of
diesel
cars
to
improve
air
quality
after
the
european
commission
said
on
thursday
it
was
taking
the
country
to
court
for
failing
to
respect
air
quality
limits
the
european
commission
has
decided
to
take
france
germany
hungary
italy
romania
and
britain
to
the
eu
court
of
justice
over
the
issue
if
we
are
to
survive
in
court
we
need
more
and
faster
progress
to
make
the
air
clean
schulze
said
in
a
statement
we
need
refits
for
diesel
as
soon
as
possible
and
at
the
expense
of
carmakers
as
they
caused
the
problem
she
added
german
carmaker
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
installing
secret
software
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
diesel
cars
to
cheat
exhaust
emissions
tests
and
make
them
appear
cleaner
the
scandal
also
known
as
dieselgate
led
to
a
regulatory
crackdown
that
is
threatening
thousands
of
jobs
as
customers
increasingly
shun
cars
schulze
a
member
of
the
social
democrats
said
the
commission
s
decision
showed
that
the
government
had
to
change
it
strategy
to
hope
that
the
problem
will
be
solved
by
itself
as
some
apparently
do
is
now
no
longer
an
option
she
warned
chancellor
angela
merkel
s
conservatives
are
more
cautious
though
warning
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
make
the
car
cover
the
whole
cost
of
refits
as
this
would
weaken
their
ability
to
invest
in
greener
technologies
merkel
told
lawmakers
on
wednesday
that
the
government
had
a
responsibility
to
tell
the
industry
that
it
had
to
restore
trust
but
she
opposed
calls
to
further
increase
the
burden
on
carmakers
to
retrofit
vehicles
that
produce
excessive
emissions
merkel
also
called
for
europe
to
support
the
development
of
the
battery
and
software
technologies
needed
if
electric
vehicles
become
the
cars
of
the
future
since
otherwise
europe
risks
losing
its
manufacturing
abilities
to
asia
and
north
america
