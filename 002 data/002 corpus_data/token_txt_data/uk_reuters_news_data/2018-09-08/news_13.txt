china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
widened
to
a
record
in
august
even
as
the
country
s
export
growth
slowed
slightly
an
outcome
that
could
push
president
donald
trump
to
turn
up
the
heat
on
beijing
in
their
cantankerous
trade
dispute
the
politically
sensitive
surplus
hit
billion
in
august
up
from
billion
in
july
customs
data
showed
on
saturday
surpassing
the
previous
record
set
in
june
over
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
china
s
surplus
with
its
largest
export
market
has
risen
nearly
percent
adding
to
tensions
in
the
trade
relationship
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
china
s
annual
export
growth
in
august
moderated
slightly
to
percent
the
data
showed
the
weakest
rate
since
march
but
only
slightly
below
recent
trends
the
number
missed
analysts
forecasts
that
shipments
from
the
world
s
largest
exporter
would
rise
percent
slowing
only
slightly
from
percent
in
july
even
with
tariffs
targeting
billion
of
chinese
exports
in
effect
for
their
first
full
month
in
august
china
s
exports
to
the
united
states
still
accelerated
growing
percent
from
a
year
earlier
from
percent
in
july
there
is
still
an
impact
from
of
exports
but
the
main
reason
for
export
growth
is
strong
growth
in
the
economy
said
zhang
yi
an
economist
at
zhonghai
shengrong
capital
management
zhang
said
the
impact
from
tariffs
on
china
s
exports
would
likely
be
limited
over
the
next
few
months
china
s
imports
from
the
united
states
grew
only
percent
in
august
a
slowdown
from
percent
in
july
the
world
s
largest
trading
nation
got
off
to
a
strong
start
this
year
but
its
economic
outlook
is
being
clouded
by
the
rapidly
escalating
trade
dispute
and
cooling
domestic
demand
trump
upped
the
ante
on
friday
warning
he
was
ready
to
slap
tariffs
on
nearly
all
chinese
imports
to
the
united
states
threatening
duties
on
another
billion
of
goods
on
top
of
billion
in
imports
primed
for
levies
in
coming
days
washington
has
long
criticised
china
s
huge
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
and
has
demanded
beijing
reduce
it
still
disagreements
between
the
two
major
economic
powers
run
deeper
than
just
the
trade
balance
and
tensions
remain
over
limits
on
firms
access
to
chinese
markets
intellectual
property
protection
technology
transfers
and
investment
imports
a
key
gauge
of
the
strength
of
china
s
domestic
demand
grew
percent
beating
forecasts
analysts
had
expected
growth
of
percent
slowing
from
july
s
surprisingly
high
percent
that
resulted
in
china
posting
a
smaller
overall
trade
surplus
of
billion
for
the
month
analysts
had
expected
the
surplus
would
rise
to
billion
from
billion
in
july
the
surplus
with
the
united
states
was
larger
than
china
s
net
surplus
for
the
month
indicating
china
would
be
running
a
deficit
if
trade
with
the
world
s
largest
economy
was
excluded
while
no
one
predicted
a
sudden
sharp
blow
from
tariffs
china
s
official
export
data
has
been
surprisingly
resilient
so
far
with
growth
exceeding
analysts
expectations
for
five
months
in
a
row
chinese
officials
acknowledged
chinese
exporters
have
been
rushing
out
shipments
to
beat
new
tariffs
buoying
the
headline
growth
readings
while
some
companies
such
as
steel
mills
are
diversifying
and
selling
more
products
to
other
countries
economists
have
noted
that
disruptions
in
supply
chains
are
likely
to
be
more
company
specific
and
will
take
time
to
be
reflected
in
broad
economic
data
and
corporate
earnings
reports
however
anecdotal
evidence
of
mounting
trade
damage
on
both
sides
of
the
pacific
is
on
the
rise
official
and
private
manufacturing
surveys
for
china
show
global
demand
for
chinese
goods
is
clearly
on
the
wane
with
export
orders
shrinking
for
months
in
a
row
risks
have
increased
due
to
the
negative
impacts
of
trade
friction
the
impact
on
exports
may
gradually
start
to
show
up
with
future
export
growth
possible
declining
said
liu
xuezhi
an
analyst
with
bank
of
communications
policymakers
have
shifted
their
focus
in
recent
months
to
improving
credit
conditions
and
shoring
up
business
confidence
beijing
is
ramping
up
spending
on
infrastructure
projects
to
spur
domestic
demand
and
the
central
bank
is
tamping
down
borrowing
costs
and
leaning
on
commercial
banks
to
continue
lending
to
struggling
firms
hit
by
trade
troubles
but
such
steps
will
take
time
to
arrest
the
economy
s
slide
and
analysts
expect
the
government
to
unveil
more
stimulus
measures
if
business
conditions
continue
to
deteriorate
