reuters
president
donald
trump
warned
on
friday
he
was
ready
to
slap
tariffs
on
virtually
all
chinese
imports
into
the
united
states
threatening
duties
on
another
billion
billion
of
goods
on
top
of
billion
in
imports
primed
for
levies
in
coming
days
the
moves
would
sharply
escalate
trump
s
trade
war
with
beijing
over
his
demands
for
major
changes
in
economic
trade
and
technology
policy
china
has
threatened
retaliation
which
could
include
action
against
companies
operating
there
hours
after
a
public
comment
period
closed
on
his
billion
china
tariff
list
trump
told
reporters
aboard
air
force
one
that
he
was
being
strong
on
china
because
i
have
to
the
billion
we
are
talking
about
could
take
place
very
soon
depending
on
what
happens
with
them
to
a
certain
extent
it
s
going
to
be
up
to
china
trump
said
and
i
hate
to
say
this
but
behind
that
is
another
billion
ready
to
go
on
short
notice
if
i
want
that
totally
changes
the
stock
prices
slipped
after
his
comments
with
the
s
p
off
percent
while
china
s
trade
yuan
currency
fell
against
the
dollar
there
was
no
immediate
reaction
to
trump
s
comments
from
the
chinese
government
and
the
threat
of
more
tariffs
had
not
been
reported
by
mainstream
chinese
media
as
of
saturday
evening
trump
has
already
imposed
percent
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
mostly
industrial
machinery
and
intermediate
electronics
parts
including
semiconductors
the
billion
list
which
includes
some
consumer
products
such
as
cameras
and
recording
devices
luggage
handbags
tires
and
vacuum
cleaners
would
be
subject
to
tariffs
of
percent
to
percent
cell
phones
the
biggest
import
from
china
have
so
far
been
spared
but
would
be
engulfed
if
trump
activates
the
billion
tariff
list
trump
s
threatened
tariffs
now
totalling
billion
in
chinese
goods
would
exceed
the
billion
in
goods
imported
from
china
last
year
but
imports
from
china
through
july
were
up
nearly
percent
over
the
same
period
of
according
to
census
bureau
data
earlier
on
friday
white
house
economic
adviser
larry
kudlow
told
bloomberg
television
the
administration
would
evaluate
public
comments
before
making
decisions
on
the
billion
tariff
list
the
trade
representative
s
office
received
nearly
comments
and
held
seven
days
of
public
hearings
on
the
proposed
levies
most
comments
were
from
companies
seeking
to
remove
products
from
the
tariff
list
arguing
there
were
few
if
any
alternative
sources
and
the
duties
would
cause
financial
hardship
comparatively
few
applauded
the
tariffs
major
technology
company
apple
inc
said
a
wide
range
of
its
products
would
be
hit
by
the
tariffs
but
not
its
iphone
it
said
in
a
late
submission
that
its
airpods
headphones
some
of
apple
s
beats
headphones
and
its
new
homepod
smart
speaker
would
face
levies
causing
its
shares
to
slip
in
late
trading
our
concern
with
these
tariffs
is
that
the
will
be
hardest
hit
and
that
will
result
in
lower
growth
and
competitiveness
and
higher
prices
for
consumers
apple
said
in
the
letter
retailers
had
successfully
kept
consumer
electronics
such
as
cell
phones
and
television
sets
off
of
previous
tariff
lists
but
david
french
top
lobbyist
for
the
national
retail
federation
whose
members
include
bj
s
wholesale
club
and
macy
s
said
nearly
every
consumer
good
could
be
affected
if
trump
follows
through
on
all
threatened
tariffs
the
chinese
aren
t
paying
these
tariffs
american
families
are
going
to
pay
these
tariffs
these
are
taxes
and
they
re
going
to
find
their
way
into
the
pocket
book
of
folks
around
the
country
french
said
kudlow
who
heads
the
national
economic
council
told
cnbc
the
administration
was
still
talking
with
china
about
trade
issues
but
so
far
china
had
not
met
requests
the
united
states
has
demanded
that
china
better
protect
american
intellectual
property
cut
its
trade
surplus
allow
companies
greater
access
to
its
markets
and
roll
back
its
industrial
subsidy
programs
we
are
still
talking
with
china
on
a
number
of
issues
those
talks
will
continue
to
go
on
we
want
lower
trade
barriers
across
the
board
kudlow
said
specifically
kudlow
said
the
united
states
was
seeking
zero
tariffs
zero
barriers
zero
subsidies
stop
the
ip
theft
stop
the
technology
transfer
allow
americans
to
own
their
own
those
have
been
our
asks
for
many
months
and
so
far
those
asks
have
not
been
satisfied
he
said
however
hope
springs
