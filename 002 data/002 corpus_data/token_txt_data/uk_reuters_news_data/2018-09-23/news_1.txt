blow
at
its
security
establishment
at
a
time
when
the
united
states
and
its
gulf
allies
are
working
to
isolate
tehran
considering
the
guards
full
knowledge
about
the
centres
of
deployment
of
the
criminal
terrorists
leaders
they
will
face
a
deadly
and
unforgettable
vengeance
in
the
near
future
the
guards
said
in
a
statement
carried
by
state
media
four
assailants
fired
on
a
viewing
stand
in
the
southwestern
city
of
ahvaz
where
iranian
officials
had
gathered
to
watch
an
annual

who
it
said
were
on
their
way
to
carry
out
the

a

to
be
a

discussed
the

national
resistance
an
iranian
ethnic
arab
opposition
movement
which
seeks
a
separate
state
in
khuzestan
province
also
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
neither
of
them
provided
evidence
there
has
been
a
blizzard
of
furious
statements
from
top
iranian
officials
including
president
hassan
rouhani
accusing
iran
s
adversaries
the
united
states
and
gulf
states
of
provoking
the
bloodshed
and
threatening
a
tough
response
nikki
haley
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
rejected
rouhani
s
accusations
he
s
got
the
iranian
people
protesting
every
ounce
of
money
that
goes
into
iran
goes
into
his
military
he
has
oppressed
his
people
for
a
long
time
and
he
needs
to
look
at
his
own
base
to
figure
out
where
that
s
coming
from
she
told
cnn
senior
commanders
of
the
islamic
revolutionary
guards
corps
irgc
have
said
the
ahvaz
attack
was
carried
out
by
militants
trained
by
gulf
states
and
israel
and
backed
by
america
but
it
is
unlikely
the
irgc
will
strike
any
of
these
foes
directly
the
guards
could
put
on
a
show
of
strength
by
firing
missiles
at
opposition
groups
operating
in
iraq
or
syria
that
may
be
linked
to
the
militants
who
staged
the
attack
they
are
also
likely
to
enforce
a
tight
security
policy
in
khuzestan
province
arresting
any
perceived
domestic
opponents
including
civil
rights
activists
three
arab
activists
told
reuters
that
security
forces
especially
the
intelligence
branch
of
the
revolutionary
guards
had
detained
more
activists
in
ahvaz
rouhani
engineered
iran
s
nuclear
deal
with
world
powers
that
ushered
in
a
cautious
detente
with
washington
before
tensions
flared
anew
with
president
donald
trump
s
decision
in
may
to
pull
out
of
the
accord
and
reimpose
sanctions
on
tehran
the
attack
on
the
military
parade
is
likely
to
give
security
hardliners
like
the
guards
more
political
ammunition
because
they
did
not
endorse
the
pragmatist
rouhani
s
pursuit
of
the
nuclear
deal
with
the
west
analysts

in

rudy

that

were
inflicting
economic
pain
on
iran
that

a
successful

the

has
said
that
changing
iran
s
system
of
government
is
not
policy
