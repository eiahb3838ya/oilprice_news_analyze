n.korea's push to use more coal clouds environmental future
seoul
reuters
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
sees
coal
as
a
key
way
to
boost
the
economy
but
burning
more
coal
may
worsen
pollution
in
a
country
already
choking
on
some
of
the
world
s
most
toxic
air
with
the
country
staggering
under
the
weight
of
international
sanctions
over
its
nuclear
weapons
programme
and
human
rights
violations
defectors
and
analysts
say
pyongyang
has
increased
the
domestic
use
of
coal
which
is
blocked
for
export
seven
coal
power
plants
and
one
plant
produce
nearly
percent
of
north
korea
s
electricity
with
the
rest
coming
from
hydro
power
according
to
south
korean
government
data
for
households
coal
is
also
a
key
fuel
source
for
cooking
and
heating
but
an
increased
reliance
which
kim
announced
in
his
new
year
address
may
have
deadly
implications
per
capita
north
korea
s
air
pollution
mortality
rate
was
the
world
s
highest
at
deaths
per
population
as
of
a
report
from
the
world
health
organization
who
showed
that
was
times
higher
than
the
rate
in
south
korea
and
higher
than
those
of
china
and
india
where
smog
often
envelops
major
cities
north
korea
has
acknowledged
the
correlation
between
coal
and
polluted
air
but
said
it
has
had
limited
access
to
cleaner
options
a
combination
of
limited
capital
investment
in
infrastructure
limited
access
to
efficient
and
low
emission
technologies
and
reliance
on
energy
produced
from
coal
in
low
efficiency
thermal
power
plants
has
impacted
air
quality
in
urban
and
industrial
areas
north
korea
s
report
on
environment
and
climate
change
outlook
submitted
to
united
nations
environment
programme
unep
said
according
to
the
report
coal
is
the
main
fuel
used
by
homes
in
north
korean
cities
in
rural
areas
wood
is
the
main
source
while
coal
comes
in
second
many
rural
north
koreans
say
they
re
aware
of
the
pollution
but
have
more
pressing
problems
from
the
moment
we
woke
up
we
had
to
think
about
how
much
rice
was
left
in
our
jar
and
how
much
firewood
we
had
said
ji
a
north
korean
defector
who
lived
in
a
coal
mine
town
in
north
hamgyong
province
before
fleeing
to
the
south
in
we
don
t
die
right
away
from
eating
dust
but
we
do
if
we
don
t
eat
food
said
ji
now
an
official
at
nauh
a
human
rights
activist
group
who
regularly
talks
to
sources
inside
the
north
analysts
say
north
korea
has
typically
reserved
its
coal
for
export
using
it
domestically
instead
would
have
at
least
a
small
impact
on
minimising
additional
pollution
experts
say
using
good
quality
of
coal
would
reduce
emissions
said
kim
professor
of
chemical
engineering
material
science
at
ewha
womans
university
in
seoul
but
north
korean
facilities
lack
sufficient
filtering
so
using
more
coal
of
any
kind
would
likely
lead
to
more
carbon
dioxide
sulphur
dioxide
and
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
he
said
reuters
journalists
in
pyongyang
late
last
year
observed
thick
smoke
pouring
from
the
stacks
of
several
facilities
often
covering
parts
of
the
capital
in
smog
to
raise
public
awareness
about
air
pollution
in
north
korea
s
state
television
aired
a
special
warning
about
it
and
provided
tips
such
as
wearing
masks
in
north
korea
set
goals
to
address
air
pollution
and
is
working
to
upgrade
older
thermal
power
plants
according
to
reports
the
country
submitted
to
unep
and
the
united
nations
framework
convention
on
climate
change
but
limited
technical
and
financial
resources
prevented
detailed
monitoring
of
air
quality
the
report
said
and
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
north
korean
government
followed
through
on
its
recommendations
experts
say
a
lack
of
reliable
data
make
it
difficult
to
gauge
exactly
how
much
damage
kim
jong
un
s
coal
plan
might
do
to
the
environment
and
air
quality
but
they
agree
it
will
have
an
impact
outside
his
country
s
borders
especially
in
south
korea
kim
said
air
pollution
harms
and
kills
millions
of
people
every
year
especially
in
asia
according
to
the
who
in
south
korea
up
to
percent
of
air
pollutants
are
estimated
to
originate
in
the
north
experts
say
in
a
survey
by
the
korea
institute
for
health
and
social
affairs
south
korean
respondents
said
air
pollution
was
their
biggest
concern
eclipsing
even
north
korea
s
nuclear
threats
kim
and
south
korean
president
moon
promised
last
year
to
restore
the
north
s
damaged
forests
in
an
effort
to
fight
air
pollution
some
air
pollutants
travel
over
to
the
south
from
the
north
if
forests
are
built
well
those
could
be
reduced
south
korea
s
forest
service
minister
kim
who
visited
pyongyang
last
year
to
discuss
the
matter
told
reporters
in
january
kim
a
professor
of
environment
and
safety
engineering
at
ajou
university
who
has
studied
the
impact
of
north
korean
pollutants
said
better
data
from
the
north
is
essential
to
devising
air
pollution
policies
in
the
south
north
korea
s
air
quality
is
our
homework
to
do
and
we
have
to
think
about
north
korean
people
s
health
as
well
