german onshore wind industry warns of sharp drop in new turbines
frankfurt

germany
saw
a
sharp
fall
in
the
number
of
new
onshore
wind
turbines
installed
last
year
industry
groups
said
on
tuesday
and
warned
there
was
little
prospect
of
a
recovery
without
government
help
wind
power
is
one
of
the
most
important
drivers
of
germany
s
transition
to
renewable
energy
accounting
for
nearly
percent
of
total
power
generation
sent
to
public
grids
in
according
to
fraunhofer
institute
research
however
the
rapid
expansion
in
onshore
wind
energy
achieved
from
to
came
to
a
halt
last
year
due
to
red
tape
opposition
from
local
communities
and
uncertainty
among
operators
after
the
government
abandoned
fixed
payments
for
new
projects
in
favor
of
an
auction
system
germany
installed
megawatts
mw
worth
of
onshore
wind
turbines
in
down
percent
from
engineering
group
vdma
and
wind
energy
association
bwe
said
in
a
joint
statement
the
groups
had
expected
mw
of
additional
capacity
the
stop
and
go
must
end
said
matthias
zelinger
managing
director
at
vdma
power
systems
of
government
policy
towards
wind
power
a
sustained
and
faster
expansion
of
renewables
would
be
logical
given
that
costs
have
been
reduced
and
a
plan
to
go
without
brown
and
hard
generation
has
just
been
zelinger
said
germany
risked
falling
behind
eu
rivals
and
overseas
competitors
in
the
battle
to
lead
the
global
wind
industry
vdma
represents
companies
such
as
siemens
gamesa
nordex
and
senvion
wind
has
become
all
the
more
important
as
germany
wants
to
produce
percent
of
power
from
renewable
sources
by
zelinger
said
a
commission
at
the
weekend
recommended
a
halving
of
coal
plant
capacity
by
that
date
as
well
as
faster
renewables
growth
among
a
raft
of
related
measures
to
meet
that
target
and
exit
coal
fully
by
a
recovery
in
the
wind
industry
could
perhaps
build
from
after
parliament
two
months
ago
approved
special
mw
tenders
for
wind
and
solar
energy
plus
an
unspecified
amount
of
offshore
wind
between
and
on
top
of
regular
tenders
this
legislation
was
brought
in
to
compensate
for
the
ruling
coalition
s
move
to
shelve
strict
emissions
targets
for
and
instead
push
for
more
aggressive
ones
