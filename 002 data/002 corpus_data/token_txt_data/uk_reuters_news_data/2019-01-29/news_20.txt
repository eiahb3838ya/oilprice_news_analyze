thousands
of
coffee
farmers
in
peru
hope
to
produce
higher
and
more
profitable
crop
yields
to
better
cope
with
the
impact
of
climate
change
under
a
landmark
united
project
more
than
billion
people
live
on
farmland
that
is
deteriorating
and
producing
less
putting
them
at
risk
of
worsening
hunger
water
shortages
and
poverty
the
says
land
degradation
could
displace
million
people
by
unless
action
is
taken
to
restore
their
land
says
the
the
million
peru
project
involves
small
coffee
farmers
and
is
the
first
by
a
investment
set
up
with
the
called
the
land
degradation
neutrality
fund
what
we
re
trying
to
do
with
this
fund
is
to
finance
the
transition
to
a
more
sustainable
use
of
land
said
gautier
queru
head
of
the
fund
which
is
run
by
investment
manager
mirova
this
translates
in
producing
more
and
better
with
less
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
project
set
to
start
within
weeks
runs
for
years
four
coffee
in
northern
peru
will
be
trained
in
sustainable
farming
learning
about
the
best
use
of
organic
fertiliser
and
robust
seeds
it
s
a
matter
of
selecting
the
seeds
that
are
well
adapted
to
the
local
conditions
and
future
conditions
taking
into
account
climate
change
to
make
the
coffee
plantations
more
resilient
and
also
to
ensure
good
quality
coffee
is
produced
to
drive
prices
up
for
farmers
queru
said
the
project
also
focuses
on
reforestation
covering
nearly
hectares
of
degraded
land
trees
will
be
planted
in
and
around
plantations
providing
shade
it
is
hoped
this
may
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
metric
tons
land
degradation
drives
climate
change
with
deforestation
which
contributes
percent
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
worsening
the
problem
the
says
the
fund
aims
to
invest
million
in
land
management
and
restoration
projects
worldwide
to
meet
global
goals
known
as
the
sustainable
development
goals
on
land
degradation
by
if
you
want
to
meet
the
sustainable
development
goals
we
can
t
only
rely
on
small
pilot
projects
queru
said
we
need
this
program
to
scale
queru
said
the
aim
is
to
expand
the
pilot
project
to
other
coffee
cooperatives
in
peru
and
other
nations
in
latin
america
as
well
as
to
cocoa
