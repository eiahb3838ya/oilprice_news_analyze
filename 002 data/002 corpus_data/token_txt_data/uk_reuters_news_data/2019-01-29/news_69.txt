focus-oil major total plans biggest exploration drive in years
town
reuters
total
is
launching
its
biggest
exploration
campaign
for
years
in
as
part
of
a
turnaround
plan
that
is
ditching
the
company
s
focus
on
risky
in
favour
of
areas
known
to
contain
commercial
levels
of
oil
or
gas
the
french
major
aims
to
drill
wells
this
year
its
senior
vice
president
for
exploration
kevin
mclachlan
told
reuters
in
waters
off
mauritania
senegal
namibia
south
africa
guyana
and
brazil
while
the
company
declined
to
say
how
many
wells
it
drilled
in
mclachlan
said
would
be
total
s
largest
programme
in
years
the
wells
planned
represent
about
a
trebling
of
the
levels
of
and
and
is
higher
even
than
the
drilled
in
before
the
oil
price
crash
the
company
s
new
game
plan
is
to
concentrate
efforts
on
emerging
and
mature
basins
which
offer
a
greater
chance
of
exploration
success
it
is
moving
away
from
its
strategy
of
targeting
frontier
areas
that
have
not
been
commercially
exploited
an
approach
which
yielded
scant
rewards
and
saw
outlier
total
fall
behind
rivals
as
a
result
the
proportion
of
its
exploration
capital
the
company
is
spending
on
frontier
areas
has
dropped
to
percent
from
percent
five
years
ago
we
were
spending
a
lot
of
money
in
frontier
said
mclachlan
a
canadian
geophysicist
who
joined
total
in
to
lead
the
revamp
of
its
exploration
strategy
now
we
want
most
of
the
wells
it
aims
to
drill
this
year
will
target
known
giant
fields
he
added
total
has
broken
ranks
with
some
rivals
in
recent
years
and
largely
ignored
the
rush
to
shale
it
is
looking
to
eke
out
conventional
resources
particularly
in
africa
where
it
has
the
biggest
industry
presence
the
strategy
carries
risks
though
and
has
left
the
company
exposed
to
the
kind
of
political
instability
that
has
deterred
others
mclachlan
said
total
s
exploration
budget
would
remain
broadly
in
line
with
when
it
was
billion
and
when
it
was
billion
that
is
still
less
than
half
the
level
of
when
the
price
crash
forced
all
majors
to
cut
spending
appraisals
of
discoveries
in
could
offer
signs
that
total
s
shift
in
exploration
strategy
is
paying
off
the
company
announced
a
trillion
cubic
feet
gas
discovery
off
shetland
in
the
north
sea
last
year
appraisals
are
ongoing
for
the
ballymore
discovery
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
with
chevron
and
calypso
in
cyprus
with
eni
a
major
discovery
in
could
cement
the
turnaround
after
a
drought
between
and
when
it
spent
billions
in
exploration
with
little
barrels
to
show
for
it
while
rivals
eni
exxon
mobil
and
bp
racked
up
successes
yet
there
is
still
work
to
do
in
terms
of
converting
exploration
dollars
into
commercial
success
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
total
had
aggressively
snapped
up
exploration
blocks
in
and
which
took
it
to
the
top
of
the
industry
table
with
over
square
km
added
since
around
higher
than
its
nearest
competitor
but
in
terms
of
discoveries
since
total
still
lags
some
peers
said
wood
mackenzie
analyst
andrew
latham
it
is
clearly
behind
exxon
mobil
exxon
s
success
in
guyana
marks
them
out
as
industry
leader
said
latham
adding
that
eni
s
zohr
gas
discovery
in
egypt
was
the
next
top
find
thereafter
it
is
competing
well
with
the
other
majors
it
has
been
involved
in
a
string
of
million
barrel
big
new
finds
whereas
in
the
previous
four
years
it
would
have
been
one
of
the
weaker
or
weakest
of
the
as
part
of
its
turnaround
plan
total
has
created
five
regional
exploration
hubs
with
a
concentration
of
geoscientists
instead
of
teams
spread
out
in
countries
a
new
central
leadership
team
reviews
and
chooses
projects
compared
with
decisions
being
made
locally
before
while
people
with
exploration
track
records
have
been
placed
in
executive
positions
for
the
first
time
like
some
competitors
including
exxon
and
bp
total
is
looking
to
deepwater
exploration
at
a
time
when
technological
advances
particularly
in
digital
seismic
imaging
is
aiding
a
comeback
in
that
area
following
a
decade
when
industry
advances
have
been
focused
on
onshore
shale
of
the
wells
in
total
s
drill
programme
this
year
it
has
already
started
work
at
the
deepwater
brulpadda
field
off
south
africa
two
industry
sources
close
to
the
project
say
the
potential
for
a
discovery
is
high
and
could
signal
a
not
only
for
total
but
also
for
the
country
we
are
expecting
the
results
in
the
coming
days
total
s
chairman
and
chief
executive
patrick
pouyanne
said
while
total
has
said
the
field
could
hold
between
million
to
over
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
one
of
its
partner
in
the
project
is
more
upbeat
the
outlook
for
finding
hydrocarbons
is
extremely
high
the
question
is
whether
it
is
gas
or
oil
and
whether
it
is
a
reservoir
keith
hill
ceo
of
africa
oil
corp
a
minority
stakeholder
in
the
field
told
reuters
adding
that
the
field
could
hold
to
billion
barrels
other
oil
companies
and
south
african
authorities
are
likely
to
be
watching
closing
any
potential
discovery
will
ultimately
result
in
the
attraction
of
other
oil
companies
and
the
growing
of
the
oil
and
exploration
and
production
industry
in
south
africa
