paris
reuters
total
and
partners
including
china
s
cnooc
have
made
a
significant
new
gas
discovery
off
the
coast
of
britain
at
the
north
sea
glengorm
prospect
with
recoverable
resources
estimated
at
around
million
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
boe
total
said
further
drilling
and
testing
would
be
carried
out
to
appraise
the
resources
and
productivity
of
the
reservoir
glengorm
is
another
great
success
for
total
in
the
north
sea
with
results
at
the
top
end
of
expectations
and
a
high
condensate
yield
in
addition
to
the
gas
said
kevin
mclachlan
total
s
senior
vice
president
for
exploration
in
a
statement
the
discovery
is
close
to
existing
infrastructures
operated
by
total
and
offers
possibilities
such
as
the
platform
and
the
culzean
project
scheduled
to
start
production
this
year
the
company
said
it
also
presents
upside
potential
with
several
other
prospects
identified
on
the
same
block
it
added
britain
s
oil
and
gas
authority
oga
welcomed
the
discovery
as
it
underlined
the
area
s
potential
our
official
estimate
is
that
there
still
remains
between
and
billion
barrels
plus
to
be
recovered
so
there
is
every
chance
of
yet
more
significant
finds
provided
industry
can
increase
exploration
drilling
said
andy
samuel
chief
executive
of
the
oil
gas
authority
kevin
swann
senior
analyst
at
wood
mackenzie
said
that
at
million
boe
glengorm
was
the
largest
gas
discovery
in
the
united
kingdom
since
culzean
in
this
was
third
time
lucky
for
cnooc
at
glengorm
technical
problems
saw
it
try
and
fail
to
drill
the
prospect
twice
in
so
persistence
has
paid
off
this
is
a
good
start
to
what
could
prove
to
be
a
pivotal
year
for
uk
exploration
with
several
high
impact
wells
in
the
plan
