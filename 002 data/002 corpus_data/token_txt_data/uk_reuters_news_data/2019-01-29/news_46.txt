reuters
french
utility
edf
s
nuclear
reactor
under
construction
in
flamanville
northern
france
could
suffer
further
delays
if
certain
weldings
need
to
be
redone
the
country
s
nuclear
regulator
asn
said
on
tuesday
at
asn
s
annual
nuclear
safety
review
its
chief
regulator
said
there
were
questions
about
the
quality
of
eight
weldings
on
pipes
between
the
flamanville
reactor
and
the
turbine
building
and
that
there
was
a
problem
with
one
of
the
weldings
if
the
asn
were
to
rule
that
those
weldings
need
to
be
redone
it
is
possible
that
edf
s
calendar
may
not
be
respected
bernard
doroszczuk
who
took
up
his
post
two
months
ago
told
reporters
edf
said
last
week
it
would
make
further
tests
next
month
on
faulty
weldings
at
flamanville
but
added
it
still
targeted
loading
nuclear
fuel
at
the
plant
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
edf
first
reported
problems
with
flamanville
weldings
in
february
when
it
said
that
more
than
half
of
the
weldings
on
the
reactor
s
secondary
circuit
were
not
in
line
with
standards
aimed
at
making
them
in
april
edf
said
additional
controls
on
weldings
had
shown
that
some
were
not
in
line
with
asn
requirements
at
the
end
of
july
it
said
the
welding
problems
had
forced
it
to
delay
of
the
reactor
to
the
second
quarter
of
with
first
fuel
loading
set
for
the
end
of
it
then
said
weldings
would
have
to
be
redone
while
for
another
it
was
confident
that
it
could
convince
the
asn
they
were
fit
for
service
doroszczuk
a
welding
engineer
by
training
a
happy
coincidence
he
said
raised
doubts
about
that
on
tuesday
the
flaws
in
the
weldings
are
a
serious
issue
he
said
he
said
there
were
questions
about
the
quality
of
eight
weldings
which
are
in
places
hard
to
access
he
added
that
edf
s
strategy
was
not
to
repair
these
eight
weldings
but
to
prove
to
the
regulator
with
technical
calculations
that
the
weldings
are
safe
we
are
awaiting
these
calculations
and
will
rule
on
the
weldings
early
may
we
may
ask
edf
to
redo
them
he
said
doroszczuk
said
the
overall
safety
of
edf
s
reactors
was
satisfactory
but
urged
the
industry
to
maintain
appropriate
safety
margins
and
not
cut
corners
for
financial
reasons
he
said
the
nuclear
industry
needed
to
improve
its
skills
base
to
prevent
technical
problems
