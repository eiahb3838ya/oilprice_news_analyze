a
top
myanmar
investment
official
on
tuesday
suggested
alternatives
such
as
scaling
back
or
relocating
a
stalled
dam
project
that
has
strained
ties
between
the
neighbours
myanmar
angered
china
in
when
its
former
government
suspended
the
billion
myitsone
dam
in
the
country
s
north
amid
environmental
concerns
asked
about
the
dam
at
an
investment
conference
thaung
tun
chairman
of
myanmar
s
investment
commission
listed
several
problems
from
an
earthquake
fault
line
running
under
the
project
site
to
a
large
catchment
area
affecting
residents
catchment
area
would
be
twice
the
size
of
singapore
this
would
mean
that
a
lot
of
villages
will
have
been
displaced
from
their
accessible
land
that
is
the
issue
thaung
tun
told
reporters
at
the
conference
in
the
capital
naypyitaw
thaung
tun
listed
several
alternatives
including
scaling
back
the
dam
moving
it
to
a
different
location
or
offering
the
operator
an
alternative
project
he
did
not
say
if
the
government
had
a
preferred
option
myanmar
had
to
consider
its
relations
with
china
its
largest
trade
partner
and
was
working
hard
to
find
the
solution
he
said
spearheading
these
efforts
is
a
commission
launched
by
aung
san
suu
kyi
s
government
which
came
to
power
in
to
review
the
dam
myanmar
also
began
informal
talks
with
beijing
and
dam
operator
yunnan
international
power
investment
a
unit
of
state
power
investment
china
s
foreign
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
beijing
has
previously
said
it
would
maintain
communication
with
myanmar
over
the
project
finding
a
solution
is
critical
for
suu
kyi
who
has
benefited
from
beijing
s
support
at
the
united
nations
following
a
army
crackdown
that
drove
rohingya
muslims
out
of
the
former
burma
myanmar
also
needs
beijing
s
help
in
peace
talks
with
several
ethnic
armed
groups
operating
along
northern
and
eastern
borders
with
china
thaung
tun
said
original
plans
for
the
dam
were
not
thought
out
and
failed
to
consider
the
impact
on
the
community
and
the
environment
the
dam
in
the
northern
state
of
kachin
is
very
unpopular
suu
kyi
s
ruling
national
league
for
democracy
nld
lost
a
seat
in
kachin
last
year
and
party
officials
have
voiced
concern
about
their
popularity
in
ethnic
minority
areas
ahead
of
the
general
election
china
s
yunnan
province
the
planned
destination
for
about
percent
of
the
dam
s
electricity
now
has
a
power
surplus
thaung
tun
said
there
s
no
need
for
this
dam
now
he
said
on
monday
nobel
laureate
suu
kyi
opened
the
first
investment
conference
by
calling
on
global
investors
to
put
their
money
in
myanmar
seeking
to
offset
the
negative
impact
of
the
rohingya
crisis
and
slow
pace
of
economic
reforms
