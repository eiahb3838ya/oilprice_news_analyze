the
jump

was
more

in

s
strategy
as
our

for
revising

south

threatened
to
renegotiate
or
scrap
what
he
called
a
horrible
bilateral
trade
deal
that
had
doubled
the
trade
deficit
with
south
korea
since
the
two
countries
agreed
to
revise
the
deal
last

with
seoul
capping
its
steel
exports
to
the
united

to
avoid
hefty
tariffs
and
giving
greater

the
revision
took

said
improving
trade
ties
between
south
korea

will
also
support
their
shared
goal
of
north
korea
s
denuclearisation
any
help
from
the
united

regarding
north
korea
is
critical
so
good
trade
relations
will

it
also
helps
