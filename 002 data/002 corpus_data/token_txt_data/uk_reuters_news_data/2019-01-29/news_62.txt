told
reuters
president
donald
trump
s
administration
in
a
move
aimed
at
limiting
embattled
president
nicolas
maduro
s
access
to
oil
revenues
stopped
pdvsa
from
collecting
the
proceeds
of
oil
exported
to
customers
while
freezing
assets
of
pdvsa

maduro
whose
authority
is
being
challenged
by
the
president
and
head
of
the
congress
juan
guaido
said
earlier
his
government
would
start
legal
action
to
protect
citgo
he
did
not
mention
if
pdvsa
planned
changes
to
its
exports
they
are
not
allowing
tankers
bound
for
valero
citgo
and
chevron
to
leave
venezuelan
ports
if
not
prepaid
a
pdvsa

said
referring
to
a

by
the

venezuela
exports
about
barrels
per

bpd
of

to

citgo
valero
energy
corp
and
chevron
corp
are
the
three
largest
buyers
of
venezuelan
crude
in
the
united
states
valero
said
it
planned
to
comply
with
the
sanctions
and
diversify
oil
purchases
to
reduce
the
impact
on
its
business
valero
will
continue
to
support
the
administration
and
will
provide
officials
with
relevant
information
that
will
help
the
refining
system
to
function
efficiently
it
said
in
a
statement
refining
firm
phillips
another
buyer
of
venezuelan
oil
until
last
year
said
it
expected
to
be
able
to
obtain
alternative
crude
grades
and
mitigate
any
disruption
in
crude
supply
for
our
traders
and
shippers
with
tankers
anchored
around
venezuelan
ports
said
they
saw
no
clear
way
for
customers
to
pay
for
venezuelan
crude
after
sanctions
even
if
payments
are
intended
to
be
made
before
loading
according
to
the
new
sanctions
any
proceeds
from
venezuelan
crude
exported
to
companies
will
stay
in
special
bank
accounts
in
the
united
states
the
trading
sources
said
they
feared
the
european
union
may
follow
with
similar
measures
freezing
pdvsa
s
accounts
in
europe
several
years
ago
pdvsa
moved
its
bank
accounts
that
receive
money
from
oil
exports
mainly
to
china
it
also
has
accounts
in
europe
but
firms
willing
to
transfer
money
to
those
foreign
accounts
still
need
to
find
correspondent
banks
in
the
united
states
willing
to
authorize
the
transactions
which
is
difficult
because
of
sanctions
