graphic-sanctions on venezuela's oil firm sends u.s. refiners scrambling
reuters
venezuela
s
revenues
from
oil
sales
to
the
united
states
have
come
under
severe
threat
as
sweeping
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
firm
has
sent
buyers
scrambling
for
replacements
the
united
states
on
monday
imposed
sanctions
on
petr√≥leos
de
venezuela
known
as
pdvsa
to
cripple
the
opec
member
s
oil
shipments
which
account
for
nearly
all
of
venezuela
s
exports
in
response
to
the
reelection
of
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
a
vote
widely
viewed
as
fraudulent
washington
has
recognised
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
venezuela
s
head
of
state
refineries
that
depend
on
venezuela
s
heavy
crude
are
turning
to
domestic
sour
crude
grades
to
offset
the
impact
sending
prices
to
the
strongest
in
about
five
years
traders
said
other
potential
alternatives
from
canada
mexico
or
elsewhere
in
latin
america
are
hard
to
secure
amid
slowing
production
limited
spare
capacity
and
transportation
bottlenecks
traders
said
broader
oil
futures
prices
found
some
support
on
news
of
sanctions
but
the
market
reaction
was
largely
muted
as
a
lack
of
investment
mismanagement
and
fleeing
workers
have
already
driven
the
s
oil
production
to
the
lowest
in
almost
seven
decades
pdvsa
is
seeking
to
sidestep
trump
administration
sanctions
restricting
payments
for
its
oil
by
asking
major
buyers
including
refiners
to
renegotiate
contracts
four
sources
involved
in
the
talks
said
the
united
states
is
venezuela
s
biggest
oil
customer
importing
on
average
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
in
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
the
region
with
the
biggest
shortfall
of
venezuelan
crudes
either
through
sanctions
or
inadvertently
through
further
production
declines
is
the
said
michael
tran
commodity
strategist
at
rbc
capital
markets
in
a
note
for
an
interactive
graphic
on
top
importers
of
venezuelan
crude
see
the
trump
administration
sanctions
allow
companies
to
buy
venezuelan
oil
but
the
proceeds
of
such
sales
will
be
put
in
a
blocked
because
of
this
pdvsa
is
likely
to
quickly
stop
shipping
much
crude
to
the
united
states
its
top
client
overnight
maduro
said
cargoes
loaded
for
the
united
states
that
had
not
already
been
paid
for
could
not
depart
there
s
going
to
be
appetite
around
the
world
to
take
venezuelan
oil
zachary
rogers
an
oil
markets
analyst
at
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
venezuela
will
likely
be
forced
to
offer
steep
discounts
and
increase
shipments
to
russia
china
and
india
to
try
and
make
up
for
lost
revenues
from
its
top
market
traders
and
analysts
said
its
output
has
been
cut
in
half
since
to
near
lows
to
less
than
million
bpd
according
to
figures
from
opec
secondary
sources
due
to
a
major
cash
crunch
as
a
result
the
share
of
its
exports
has
declined
in
recent
years
with
more
shipments
going
to
russia
and
china
made
largely
through
repayment
structures
venezuela
can
prioritise
exports
to
asia
but
it
is
the
most
competitive
battleground
on
the
planet
rbc
capital
s
tran
said
adding
that
while
they
remain
the
second
largest
market
for
venezuelan
crudes
the
chinese
have
also
tapered
its
buying
from
caracas
over
the
past
two
years

see
shipments
to
the
united
states
account
for
about
percent
of
the
cash
venezuela
gets
for
crude
shipments
according
to
a
barclays
research
note
published
earlier
this
month
citgo
petroleum
the
refining
arm
of
pdvsa
and
the
biggest
importer
of
venezuelan
crude
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
the
other
primary
importers
valero
energy
corp
and
chevron
corp
said
they
will
comply
with
laws
though
the
united
states
is
the
top
oil
producer
with
output
of
nearly
million
bpd
complex
gulf
coast
refineries
need
heavier
crude
grades
to
produce
diesel
and
other
products
and
can
not
simply
substitute
it
with
light
crude
the
easiest
substitute
for
now
is
domestic
sour
grades
prices
of
heavier
grades
like
mars
sour
an
offshore
medium
crude
and
west
texas
sour
crude
have
risen
as
buyers
scramble
for
supply
on
tuesday
mars
crude
traded
at
about
a
barrel
premium
to
the
crude
futures
benchmark
up
from
a
a
barrel
premium
on
monday
and
remained
near
a
high
traders
said
while
west
texas
sour
was
near
the
strongest
level
in
a
year
it
s
nuts
everything
with
sulphur
in
it
is
getting
bid
said
one
crude
trader
said
referring
to
crude
s
sulphur
content
that
is
known
in
the
market
as
sour
some
traders
said
much
of
the
impact
had
already
been
priced
in
i
actually
think
it
may
end
up
being
bearish
medium
to
longer
term
if
guaido
takes
power
and
foreign
investment
flows
into
venezuela
then
their
production
has
a
lot
of
room
to
go
back
up
over
time
a
trader
at
a
merchant
said
currently
alternatives
to
venezuela
s
heavy
sour
crudes
are
becoming
increasingly
scarce
in
the
americas
due
to
challenges
facing
heavy
crude
producers
canada
and
mexico
canada
produces
more
than
million
bpd
much
of
it
heavy
crude
that
could
replace
venezuelan
grades
but
pipeline
bottlenecks
are
hampering
its
exports
until
the
ongoing
canadian
pipeline
issues
are
addressed
crude
by
rail
is
simply
not
as
scalable
as
increased
shipments
from
mexico
or
iraq
said
tran
however
mexico
s
crude
output
levels
are
among
the
lowest
on
record
dating
back
several
decades
as
its
fields
have
aged
and
new
ones
to
replace
them
have
not
been
developed
the
trump
administration
is
considering
tapping
the
country
s
emergency
reserve
of
crude
as
it
imposed
sanctions
on
pdvsa
but
no
decision
has
been
made
a
government
source
said
the
reserve
currently
holds
million
barrels
of
crude
about
million
of
which
is
classified
as
sour
oil
