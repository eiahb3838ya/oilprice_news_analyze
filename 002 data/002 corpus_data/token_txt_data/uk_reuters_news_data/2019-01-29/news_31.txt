public
anger
in
france
over
increasing
fuel
prices
which
gave
rise
to
the
yellow
vest
movement
has
further
boosted
demand
for
ethanol
fuel
from
motorists
seeking
cheaper
deals
industry
representatives
said
on
tuesday
ethanol
which
is
blended
with
gasoline
as
part
of
renewable
energy
policy
targets
had
already
benefited
from
a
favourable
environment
in
france
in
the
past
two
years
a
decline
in
diesel
demand
and
the
licensing
of
kits
to
allow
cars
to
run
on
fuel
have
contributed
to
an
increase
in
its
use
ethanol
in
france
is
made
using
sugar
beet
or
cereal
fuel
containing
up
to
percent
ethanol
known
as
reinforced
its
position
last
year
as
the
gasoline
type
in
france
claiming
an
average
percent
market
share
compared
with
about
percent
in
ethanol
producer
group
snpaa
said
the
mix
containing
up
to
percent
ethanol
saw
consumption
jump
by
percent
although
it
remained
a
small
part
of
the
gasoline
market
with
a
share
of
about
percent
ethanol
fuel
has
also
benefited
from
french
tax
breaks
that
increase
with
higher
blending
levels
making
and
cheaper
than
other
blends
even
when
factoring
in
ethanol
s
lower
fuel
efficiency
compared
with
traditional
petrol
selling
at
about
half
the
price
of
the
blend
has
attracted
growing
attention
as
rising
fuel
costs
coincided
with
the
spread
of
kits
snpaa
said
demand
picked
up
from
october
when
people
heard
about
the
authorisation
for
kits
snpaa
sylvain
demoures
told
a
news
conference
with
the
increase
in
fuel
prices
last
summer
more
people
became
interested
and
the
trend
was
reinforced
by
the
current
yellow
vest
debate

french
motorists
are
required
to
carry

onto
the

november
before
their
movement

developed
into
a
broader
revolt

buying
and
installing
a
kit
typically
costs
around

with
payback
in
two
years
for
an
average
french

or
in
a
year
or
less
for
heavy

users
kit
suppliers

at
the
conference
sales
at
kit
supplier
biomotors
climbed
to
more
than
units
in
january
compared
with
about
per
month
on
average
last
year
its
managing
director
alexis
landrieu
said
several
french
regions
have
offered
aid
to
motorists
to
acquire
kits
amid
criticism
that
a

to
