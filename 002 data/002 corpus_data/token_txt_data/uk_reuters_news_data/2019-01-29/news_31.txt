venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
is
seeking
to
sidestep
trump
administration
sanctions
restricting
payments
for
its
oil
by
asking
major
buyers
including
refiners
to
renegotiate
contracts
four
sources
involved
in
the
talks
said
the
government
issued
an
executive
order
on
monday
freezing
pdvsa
assets
and
requiring
firms
to
pay
for
pdvsa
oil
using
accounts
controlled
by
the
country
s
congress
head
and
president
juan
guaido
the
sanctions
were
aimed
at
pressuring
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
into
stepping
down
pdvsa
began
calling
customers
ahead
of
the
sanctions
urging
them
to
swap
foreign
fuel
and
other
products
for
its
venezuelan
crude
cargoes
the
sources
said
it
is
also
considering
asking
trading
houses
to
act
as
intermediaries
for
a
portion
of
its
oil
sales
to
indirectly
supply
customers
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
we
are
trying
to
redo
the
contracts
it
is
not
yet
entirely
clear
how
because
customers
are
being
individually
called
but
we
are
studying
alternatives
said
a
pdvsa
source
familiar
with
the
efforts
it
was
unclear
on
tuesday
whether
the
approach
of
using
intermediaries
or
swaps
would
avoid
violating
sanctions
the
sources
said
oil
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
venezuela
s
export
revenue
falling
output
corruption
and
mismanagement
have
battered
the
nation
s
economy
leading
to
hyperinflation
and
malnutrition
that
have
prompted
some
million
people
to
leave
the
country
the
south
american
country
exports
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
including
bpd
to
the
united
states
and
imports
over
bpd
of
refined
products
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
washington
said
on
monday
proceeds
from
pdvsa
s
sales
to
companies
in
the
united
states
will
be
frozen
until
a
new
government
can
take
control
of
the
accounts
the
sanctions
did
not
directly
mention
swaps
and
indirect
trade
with
pdvsa
that
began
in
recent
years
with
customers
including
pdvsa
s
unit
citgo
petroleum
india
s
reliance
and
russia
s
rosneft
oil
firms
that
had
sent
tankers
to
venezuela
to
lift
crude
bound
for
the
united
states
were
ordered
by
pdvsa
on
monday
to
pay
for
cargoes
before
departure
sources
told
reuters
but
such
prepayment
could
violate
the
sanctions
setting
the
stage
for
a
standoff
at
venezuelan
ports
regular
buyers
of
venezuelan
crude
especially
in
the
united
states
have
started
hunting
for
alternative
supplies
of
heavy
oil
a
difficult
task
as
other
latin
american
exporters
from
mexico
to
colombia
do
not
have
surplus
capacity
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
several
refiners
including
chevron
corp
phillips
and
valero
energy
said
they
were
studying
the
sanctions
and
would
comply
with
laws
valero
the
buyer
of
venezuelan
crude
after
citgo
said
it
will
its
crude
supply
washington
s
fast
action
on
venezuela
and
efforts
by
maduro
s
government
to
defend
its
grip
on
pdvsa
have
sent
shockwaves
around
the
world
triggering
higher
global
oil
prices
and
angry
responses
from
china
and
russia
swaps
and
trades
have
become
routine
due
to
pdvsa
s
pacts
and
sanctions
first
imposed
in
according
to
internal
pdvsa
documents
and
trading
sources
the
company
s
barrels
typically
go
through
several
hands
before
reaching
a
refinery
its
fuel
imports
mostly
come
from
swaps
according
to
pdvsa
s
internal
documents
and
refinitiv
eikon
data
pdvsa
approached
an
indian
refiner
seeking
to
modify
terms
of
its
contracts
including
adding
partial
payment
in
the
form
of
refined
products
through
swaps
a
source
from
the
refining
company
said
with
other
customers
payments
in
medicines
or
food
for
settling
outstanding
balances
also
are
on
the
table
one
of
the
pdvsa
sources
said
india
s
reliance
and
nayara
energy
partially
owned
by
rosneft
did
not
respond
to
emails
requesting
comment
swaps
are
one
response
to
sanctions
but
dealing
with
traders
for
triangulating
venezuelan
oil
sales
could
be
pdvsa
s
last
resort
as
intermediaries
make
a
profit
from
buying
cheap
barrels
storing
them
and
then
offering
them
to
refiners
traders
buy
our
oil
at
obscene
prices
