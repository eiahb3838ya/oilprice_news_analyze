venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
is
seeking
to
sidestep
trump
administration
sanctions
restricting
payments
for
its
oil
by
asking
major
buyers
including
refiners
to
renegotiate
contracts
four
sources
involved
in
the
talks
said
the
government
on
monday
issued
an
executive
order
freezing
pdvsa
assets
and
requiring
firms
to
pay
for
pdvsa
oil
using
accounts
controlled
by
the
country
s
congress
head
and
president
juan
guaido
a
move
to
pressure
socialist
nicolas
maduro
into
stepping
down
pdvsa
began
calling
customers
ahead
of
the
sanctions
urging
them
to
swap
foreign
fuel
and
other
products
for
its
venezuelan
crude
cargoes
the
sources
said
it
is
also
considering
asking
trading
houses
to
act
as
intermediaries
for
a
portion
of
its
crude
sales
to
indirectly
supply
customers
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
we
are
trying
to
redo
the
contracts
it
is
not
yet
entirely
clear
how
because
customers
are
being
individually
called
but
we
are
studying
alternatives
said
a
pdvsa
source
familiar
with
the
efforts
the
proposals
were
still
being
offered
but
it
was
unclear
on
tuesday
whether
the
approach
of
using
intermediaries
or
swaps
would
avoid
violating
sanctions
the
sources
said
oil
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
venezuela
s
export
revenue
falling
output
corruption
and
mismanagement
have
battered
the
nation
s
economy
leading
to
hyperinflation
and
malnutrition
that
have
sparked
an
exodus
of
million
people
the
south
american
country
exports
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
including
bpd
to
the
united
states
and
imports
over
bpd
of
refined
products
according
to
refinitiv
eikon
data
as
recently
as
it
exported
million
bpd
of
oil
and
fuel
washington
on
monday
said
proceeds
from
pdvsa
s
sales
to
companies
in
the
united
states
will
be
frozen
until
a
new
government
can
take
control
of
the
accounts
the
sanctions
did
not
directly
mention
swaps
and
indirect
trade
with
pdvsa
that
began
in
recent
years
with
customers
including
pdvsa
s
unit
citgo
petroleum
india
s
reliance
and
russia
s
rosneft
oil
firms
that
had
sent
tankers
to
venezuela
to
lift
crude
bound
for
the
united
states
were
ordered
by
pdvsa
on
monday
to
pay
for
cargoes
before
departure
sources
told
reuters
such
prepayment
could
be
in
violation
of
the
sanctions
setting
the
stage
for
a
standoff
at
venezuelan
ports
pdvsa
did
not
immediately
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
several
refiners
including
chevron
corp
phillips
and
valero
energy
said
they
were
studying
the
sanctions
and
would
comply
with
laws
valero
the
buyer
of
venezuelan
crude
after
citgo
said
it
will
its
crude
supply
to
minimize
any
impacts
washington
s
fast
action
on
venezuela
and
efforts
by
maduro
s
government
to
defend
its
grip
on
pdvsa
have
sent
shockwaves
around
the
world
triggering
higher
global
oil
prices
and
angry
responses
from
china
and
russia
