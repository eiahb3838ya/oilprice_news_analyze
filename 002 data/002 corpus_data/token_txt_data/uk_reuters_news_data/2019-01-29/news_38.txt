forecast
better

and
said
prices
were
stabilising
on

sending
its
shares

much
as
percent
higher
the
company
formed
by
a
merger
between
spain
s
gamesa
and
the
wind
power
business
of
siemens
stuck
to
its
guidance
for
an

ebit
margin
of
to
percent
for
the
full
year
chief
executive
marcus
tacke
told
analysts
on
a
conference
call
he
expects
a
stronger
second
half
to
the

after
the
company
said
its

margin
for
the

fell
to

siemens

vies
with
denmark

vestas

lead
the
global
wind
turbine
sector
said
revenue
for
the
period
rose
to
billion
euros
billion
pounds
from
billion
a
year
earlier
although
shares
in
siemens
gamesa
initially
fell
by
percent
on
ebit
and
net
profit
being
below
some
expectations
they
rebounded
on
the
firm
s
outlook
and
were
up
percent
at
gmt
leading
spain
s
ibex
index
the
company
said
profitability
had
been
dragged
down
by
pricing
on
a
backlog
of
orders
struck
in
a
year
in
which
they
fell
percent
and
a
worse
performance
by
its
onshore
unit
wind
businesses
around
the
world
have
faced
margin
pressure
as
governments
phase
out
subsidies
and
move
towards
more
competitive
contract
tenders
siemens
gamesa
said
market
prices
for
turbines
were
stabilising
and
new
orders
in
the
first
quarter
were
pricing
broadly
in
line
with
those
at
the
end
of
last
year
banco
sabadell
analysts
said
in
a
note
that
this
explained
some
of
the
share
gains
especially
in
view
of
a
percent
fall
in
the
firm
s
shares
the
previous
day
we
take
a
positive
view
of
the
messages
given
by
the
company
especially
those
related
to
stability
in
prices
and
their
confidence
that
they
can
reach
the
middle
of
the
guidance
range
given
for
the
year
the
analysts
said
a
trade
row
during
which
the
united
states
and
china
imposed
tariffs
on
each
other
s
imports
has
driven
up
the
cost
of
steel
the
main
raw
material
for
wind
turbine
parts
tacke
said
siemens
gamesa
had
taken
this
into
account
in
giving
guidance
for
future
performance
but
discussions
between
the
two
major
economies
now
needed
to
play
out
we
still
need
to
see
how
the
recent
discussion
is
going
to
be
concluded
depending
on
if
there
is
an
upside
or
a
downside
opportunity
out
of
it
he
said
he
reiterated
an
earlier
calculation
given
by
the
company
of
an
increase
of
percent
in
the
costs
of
projects
depending
on
the
product
