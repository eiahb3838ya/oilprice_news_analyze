u.s. weighs oil release as it tightens vice on venezuela-source
washington
jan
reuters
the
trump
administration
is
considering
tapping
the
country
s
emergency
reserve
of
crude
as
it
imposes
new
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
business
but
no
decision
has
been
made
a
government
source
said
the
administration
on
monday
imposed
sweeping
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
company
pdvsa
aimed
at
pressuring
socialist
president
nicholas
maduro
to
step
down
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
a
series
of
underground
caverns
on
the
coasts
of
louisiana
and
texas
currently
holds
million
barrels
of
crude
about
million
of
which
is
classified
as
sour
oil
the
rest
being
sweet
a
release
is
likely
not
imminent
but
the
reserve
s
role
is
often
a
consideration
when
the
administration
looks
at
the
global
oil
market
balance
as
it
holds
more
oil
than
required
under
international
agreements
said
the
government
source
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
under
law
the
department
of
energy
can
do
a
test
sale
of
up
to
million
barrels
or
larger
releases
to
loan
oil
to
refiners
while
the
president
can
order
draw
downs
to
counter
severe
supply
interruptions
but
the
reserve
mostly
lacks
heavy
oil
supplied
by
opec
member
venezuela
and
used
by
pdvsa
s
refining
arm
citgo
valero
energy
corp
and
chevron
in
coming
months
the
energy
department
could
announce
a
sale
of
oil
from
the
reserve
mandated
by
laws
signed
by
former
president
barack
obama
to
fund
the
federal
government
and
a
medical
program
last
year
the
department
held
two
such
sales
releasing
about
million
barrels
an
energy
analyst
discounted
the
effectiveness
of
using
the
reserve
as
a
way
to
protect
against
any
price
spikes
i
m
not
sure
a
mandated
sale
or
even
a
new
auction
really
helps
the
refiners
affected
an
auction
would
just
price
up
the
oil
said
joe
mcmonigle
senior
energy
policy
analyst
at
hedgeye
in
washington
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
in
late
september
ahead
of
midterm
elections
and
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
that
the
administration
was
not
considering
a
release
from
the
reserve
a
release
would
have
a
fairly
minor
and
analyst
kevin
book
of
clearview
energy
partners
said
if
the
sanctions
force
refiners
to
look
for
other
sources
they
could
likely
get
some
of
the
oil
from
canada
although
doing
so
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
rail
traffic
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
on
monday
oil
supplies
were
sufficient
to
ensure
no
significant
impact
on
gas
prices
in
the
short
term
a
spokesman
for
the
national
security
council
said
the
administration
would
not
comment
on
deliberations
about
venezuela
the
department
of
energy
did
not
comment
