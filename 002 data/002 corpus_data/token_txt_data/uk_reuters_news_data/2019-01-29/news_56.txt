hovered
near

souring

roiled
global

for

have
kept
investors
on
the
back
foot
this

the
trade
war
s
broadening
impact
on

growth
is
one
reason
the

has
signalled
it

be
patient
on

after

four
times
in

many
economists
including
the
international
monetary

have
cut
their
forecasts
for
global

this

citing
the

war
slowdown
is
feeding
into
some
acute
areas
of
economic
unease

said
in

data
out
of
europe
and
china
it
noted
that
investors
were
pricing
in
a
percent
contraction
in

earnings
per

eps
this
year
this
would
be
the
worst

likely
to
be
much
higher
this
year
than
seen

the

p
each
closed
down
percent
and
the
nasdaq
was
off
more
than
percent
the
losses
came
as
shares
of
caterpillar
and
nvidia
corp
nosedived
after
the
two
manufacturers
joined
a
growing
list
of
companies
cautioning
about
the
crippling
effects
of
softening
chinese
demand
both
companies
are
seen
as
industry
bellwethers
and
their
disappointing

provide
further
evidence
that
