miles

downstream
from
where
a
dam
owned
by
miner
vale
sa
burst
on
friday
killing
hundreds
a
small
indigenous
village
in
brazil
faces
doubts
about
its
very
existence
as
the
river
at
the
center
of
life
here
runs
dark
with
mining
waste
for
members
of
the
tribe
living
at
the
end
of
a
sinuous
dirt
road
fish
from
the
paraopeba
river
are
the
principal
source
of
food
villagers
bathe
and
wash
their
clothes
in
its
waters
but
after
a
tailings
dam
at
vale
s
corrego
do
feijao
mine
burst
upstream
burying
communities
and
turning
the
river
s
waters
a
muddy
brown
the
or
so
residents
of
the
village
of
nao
xoha
say
they
are
unsure
if
they
will
be
forced
to
uproot
their
families
while
there
were
no
among
the
confirmed
dead
or
disappeared
the
disaster
they
fear
could
be
the
end
of
their
way
of
life
on
thursday
i
was
here
washing
my
clothes
bathing
with
my
children
and
now
i
can
t
even
touch
the
river

holding
back
tears
our
hearts
are
so
sad
knowing
that
nothing
can
be
the
s
plight
comes
as
brazil
s
current
government
which
took
office
earlier
in
january
has
signaled
it
wants
to
cut
mining
regulations
and
shrink
protections
currently
afforded
to
indigenous
communities
for
critics
the
dam
burst
reveals
the
danger
of
both
policies
brazil
s
indigenous
affairs
agency
funai
said
it
is
committed
to
helping
nao
xoha
by
ensuring
potable
water
among
other
measures
but
in
the
wake
of
the
disaster
trust
in
the
authorities
here
is
low
you
think
some
mining
company
is
worried
about
this
do
you
think
some
mayor
is
worried
about
this
area
