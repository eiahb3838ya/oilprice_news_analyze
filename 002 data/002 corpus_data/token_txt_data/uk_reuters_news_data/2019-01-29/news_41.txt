brussels
jan
reuters
the
european
commission
said
on
tuesday
it
had
concluded
that
soybeans
can
be
used
in
biofuels
in
the
european
union
part
of
the
bloc
s
push
to
improve
strained
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
president
donald
trump
agreed
in
july
not
to
impose
tariffs
on
eu
car
imports
while
the
two
sides
explored
ways
to
boost
trade
including
a
possible
deal
to
remove
tariffs
on
industrial
goods
and
to
boost
eu
imports
of
soybeans
and
liquefied
natural
gas
the
commission
said
in
a
statement
the
recognition
of
soybeans
for
use
in
biofuels
was
valid
until
july
but
could
extend
beyond
that
date
as
long
as
they
met
sustainability
criteria
set
in
new
eu
rules
in
the
period
today
s
decision
is
new
proof
that
the
european
union
is
delivering
on
our
commitments
a
commission
spokesman
said
the
commission
which
negotiates
trade
deals
for
the
eu
has
said
the
july
agreement
led
to
a
percent
rise
in
soybean
imports
in
the
second
half
of
the
share
of
the
eu
market
is
now
about
percent
the
increase
has
been
driven
by
a
slide
in
the
soybean
price
which
slid
after
china
imposed
higher
tariffs
on
beans
in
its
trade
row
with
washington
rather
than
because
of
any
concerted
action
by
the
eu
analysts
said
the
eu
imports
about
million
tonnes
of
soybeans
per
year
as
feed
for
animals
