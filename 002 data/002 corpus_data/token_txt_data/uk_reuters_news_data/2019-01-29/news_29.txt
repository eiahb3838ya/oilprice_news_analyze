traffic
growth
has
been
closely
correlated
with
both
the
state
of
the

and
changes
in
the

while
the

has
remained
supportive
higher
oil
prices
have
been
strongly
negative
for
gasoline
consumption
falling
prices

provided
a
stimulus
to
consumption
but
subsequent
rises
have
caused
that
effect
to
unwind
the
deceleration
in
gasoline
consumption
is
one
reason
climbing
oil
prices
helped
push
the
global
oil
market
towards
a
surplus
in
and
why
prices
needed
to
fall
to
rebalance
production
and
consumption
the
impact
of
rising
prices
on
motorists

explains
why
they

so
sensitive

why

aggressively
pressed

global
oil
consumption
growth
and
prices
have
become
increasingly
sensitive
to
changes
in
economic
growth
outside
the
united

and
the
other
advanced
economies
as
signs
of
a
global
slowdown
in
trade
became
evident
in
the
second

third
quarters
of
it
became
increasingly
clear
consumption
growth
would
decelerate
and
prices
would
have
to
decline
once
the

decided
to
grant
generous
sanctions
waivers
to
iran

most
important

the

removed
and

fell
lower
prices
are
a
necessary
part
of
the

rebalancing
process
and
over

should
help
restore
some

growth

and
more
importantly
in
emerging

but
with
so
much
consumption
growth
now
geared
towards
china
