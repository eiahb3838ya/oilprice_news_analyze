managers
the

by

are
set
to
ratchet
up
the
pressure
on
venezuela
s
socialist

nicolas
maduro
and

effectively
prevent

for

manager
said
most
of
the
banks
had
stopped
to
give
compliance
departments
time
to
go
through
the
details
of
the
sanctions
a
fund
manager
at
one
major
bank
who
requested
anonymity
added
we
have
asked
for
runs
quotes
to
see
where
the
market
is
opening
and
all
we
are
hearing
in
unison
from
the
street
is
that
we
are
not
allowed
to
trade
them
until
further
notice
we
heard
this
from
all
the
major

washington
officials
had
said
on
monday
that
the
sanctions
were
intended
to
prevent
maduro
s
government
from
siphoning
off
funds
from
the
oil
company
to
maintain
his
grip
on
power
there
were
some
nuances
in
terms
of
timing
of
sanctions
and
how
pdvsa
s
refining
offshoot
citgo
would
be
impacted
but
investors
were
gradually
digesting
the
various
permutations
torino
economics
said
in
a
note
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
banning
the
buying
and
selling
of
pdvsa
s
bonds
on
the
secondary
market
was
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
venezuelan
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
in
any
future
debt
restructuring
the
logic
of
this
reasoning
is
that
the
larger
the
haircuts
for
bondholders
the
less
funds
will
the
either
directly
or
through
international
financial
institutions
have
to
provide
for
venezuela
s
reconstruction
torino
s
chief
economist
francisco
rodriguez
said
bond
markets
were
also
on
alert
for
any
sign
that

the

has
mounted
on

been
a

for
