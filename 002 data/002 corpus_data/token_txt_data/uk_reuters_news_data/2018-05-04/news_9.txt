new
york
may
reuters
a
recent
agency
ruling
limiting
certain
tax
benefits
for
energy
master
limited
partnerships
mlps
dealt
a
blow
to
a
security
class
investors
had
loved
for
their
income
but
now
look
likely
to
steer
clear
of
even
though
they
look
cheap
mlps
are
corporate
structures
that
pay
out
profit
to
investors
in
distributions
many
of
which
are
oil
and
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
the
alerian
mlp
index
plunged
percent
after
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
said
in
march
they
will
no
longer
be
allowed
to
recover
an
income
tax
allowance
as
part
of
the
fees
they
charge
to
shippers
under
a
cost
of
service
rate
structure
a
appeals
court
in
ruled
that
energy
regulators
were
allowing
them
to
benefit
from
a
double
recovery
of
taxes
leading
to
the
ferc
ruling
the
index
is
down
nearly
percent
for
the
year
after
a
drop
of
almost
percent
in
as
expectations
of
higher
interest
rates
depressed
commodity
prices
and
the
recent
ruling
have
combined
to
keep
investors
wary
the
sentiment
around
mlps
at
this
point
is
just
so
negative
it
doesn
t
matter
what
pops
up
said
john
laforge
head
of
real
asset
strategy
at
wells
fargo
investment
institute
in
sarasota
florida
maybe
you
would
ve
expected
even
after
the
ferc
decision
you
would
get
the
initial
reaction
of
the
negative
and
then
the
value
guys
step
up
and
say
this
is
crazy
but
they
didn
t
do
it
you
don
t
even
have
the
value
guys
interested
at
this
high
dividend
yields
are
a
hallmark
of
mlps
leading
many
investors
to
use
them
as
sources
of
income
while
the
dividend
yield
of
the
alerian
index
was
at
percent
at
the
end
of
april
it
has
been
on
a
downward
slope
since
hitting
a
high
of
percent
on
march
the
mlp
index
reached
a
record
high
in
september
as
oil
prices
hovered
near
a
barrel
and
their
high
dividends
made
them
attractive
to
investors
in
a
low
interest
rate
environment
bond
yields
are
rising
undermining
the
interest
rate
premium
of
mlps
and
reducing
demand
and
the
federal
reserve
has
shown
no
signs
of
deviating
from
its
path
of
tightening
benchmark
notes
hit
a
high
yield
just
over
percent
in
april
while
yields
recently
crossed
the
percent
mark
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
decade
for
the
last
decade
or
so
easy
monetary
policy
has
led
a
lot
of
money
to
income
substitutes
and
bond
proxies
said
michael
arone
chief
investment
strategist
at
state
street
global
advisors
in
boston
as
rates
have
been
moving
up
particularly
on
the
short
end
you
are
seeing
a
lot
of
the
kind
of
weak
money
leave
pretty
still
jeremy
held
director
of
research
at
alps
portfolio
solutions
in
denver
which
is
the
issuer
of
the
alerian
mlp
etf
notes
there
was
a
weak
correlation
between
mlps
and
interest
rates
over
the
period
between
and
when
rates
rise
initially
they
sort
of
sell
off
any
asset
class
utilities
bonds
mlps
telecoms
said
held
then
when
the
dust
settles
people
actually
look
and
say
it
matters
if
you
can
grow
your
dividend
distribution
faster
than
rates
are
rising
or
is
there
still
a
mlps
have
shown
some
signs
of
life
recently
after
selling
off
on
the
ferc
ruling
the
alerian
index
was
up
percent
through
thursday
since
march
compared
with
a
percent
drop
in
the
s
p
oil
prices
have
also
continued
to
climb
with
wti
up
more
than
percent
and
brent
crude
up
more
than
percent
since
the
announcement
as
mlps
generally
track
closely
or
above
oil
prices
they
could
be
poised
to
regain
their
cachet
if
you
look
at
the
demand
numbers
out
there
demand
is
very
good
said
stephen
massocca
senior
vice
president
at
wedbush

in
san
francisco
there
is
some
catching
up
to
do
these
things
