world
stocks
were
set
for
their
biggest
weekly
loss
since
on
friday
while
the
dollar
hovered
just
below
recent
highs
as
investors
awaited
crucial
jobs
data
that
could
cement
expectations
of
further

this
year
msci
s
world
index
a
gauge
of
stocks
across
countries
was
up
less
than
percent
on
the
day
it
was
set
for
a
percent
loss
this
week
its
biggest
since
the
week
ended
march
investors
were
cautious
after
a
largely
weak
performance
on
wall
street
overnight
as
disappointments
on
the
earnings
front
hit
stocks
in
companies
such
as
spotify
and
aig
bond
yields
meanwhile
slid
following
a
surprising
slowdown
in
euro
zone
inflation
the
other
issue
preying
on
markets
is
the
trade
tension
between
the
united
states
and
china
top
officials
from
beijing
and
washington
have
reached
a
consensus
on
some
aspects
of
the
countries
trade
row
but
disagreements
over
other
issues
remain
relatively
big
according
to
china
s
xinhua
news
agency
the
talks
over
the
past
two
days
have
involved
a
trade
delegation
led
by
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
and
top
chinese
officials
following
months
of
threats
and
counter
threats
from
both
sides
in
a
series
of
disputes
over
trade
practices
concerns
about
the
ongoing
meeting
between
and
chinese
officials
over
trade
policy
have
been
cited
as
one
factor
contributing
to
some
of
yesterday
s
investor
nervousness
however
these
worries
aren
t
likely
to
dissipate
any
time
soon
said
michael
hewson
chief
markets
analyst
at
cmc
markets
in
london
meanwhile
the
dollar
rose
against
a
basket
of
currencies
hugging
recent
highs
posted
on
the
back
of
a
sharp
rally
that
has
fully
reversed
its
losses
it
could
get
more
fuel
should
april
payrolls
data
due
at
gmt
underscore
labour
market
strength
payrolls
were
likely
to
have
increased
by
about
last
month
according
to
a
reuters
survey
of
economists
after
rising
only
in
march
but
it
will
be
the
wages
figure
that
analysts
will
focus
on
a
further
in
the
pace
of
wage
gains
could
be
the
smoking
gun
for
the
fed
federal
reserve
to
express
any
shift
away
from
roughly
balanced
risks
to
inflation
said
mizuho
analyst
vishnu
varathan
while
the
federal
reserve
is
seen
raising
interest
rates
at
least
two
more
times
this
year
expectations
of
policy
tightening
from
the
european
central
bank
and
the
bank
of
england
are
receding
that
has
driven
the
difference
between
german
and
government
bond
yields
to
near
the
highest
in
nearly
three
decades
with
the
and
transatlantic
spread
standing
at
and
basis
points
respectively
currency
markets
are
betting
the
relative
interest
rate
advantage
will
continue
to
push
the
dollar
higher
however
analysts
at
ing
reckon
the
dollar
s
recent
reversal
is
likely
to
be
when
dissecting
the
anatomy
of
this
dollar
correction
we
feel
it
exhibits
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
short
squeeze
positioning
had
clearly
been
stretched
they
wrote
in
a
research
note
while
short
dollar
bets
have
receded
somewhat
they
are
still
holding
near
a
record
billion
registered
in
late
april
the
euro
meanwhile
stood
just
above
lows
against
the
dollar
a
level
hit
after
inflation
in
the
euro
zone
fell
short
of
expectations
according
to
data
on
thursday
the
euro
weakness
has
lifted
european
stocks
however
with
a
euro
zone
index
set
for
its
sixth
straight
week
of
gains
a
equity
benchmark
meanwhile
was
up
percent
thanks
to
a
flurry
of
robust
earnings
reports
from
companies
such
as
chemicals
firm
lanxess
british
airways
owner
iag
and
sports
car
maker
ferrari
however
banking
stocks
lagged
following
poor
updates
including
from
hsbc
and
societe
generale
oil
prices
steadied
as
global
supplies
remained
tight
and
