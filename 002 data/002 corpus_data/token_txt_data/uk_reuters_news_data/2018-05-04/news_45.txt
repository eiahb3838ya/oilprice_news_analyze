asian
shares
fell
on
friday
while
the
dollar
ran
into
some
after
several
weeks
of
strong
gains
as
financial
markets
turned
their
attention
to
looming
payrolls
data
for
fresh
catalysts
spreadbetters
pointed
to
a
firm
start
for
european
shares
although
wall

was
poised
for
another
wobbly

off

climbed

regional
trading
was
relatively
quieter

on

msci
s
broadest

fell
percent
and

set
for
a
third
straight
weekly
loss
indonesian
stocks
led
the
declines
falling
as
much
as
percent
in
early
trading
before
recouping
some
of
those
losses
south

were
down
percent
and
australian

eased
percent
the
focus
for
markets
will
be
on
the
jobs
data
due
later
in
the
global
day
with
the
april
report
likely
to
underscore
labour
market
strength
nonfarm
payrolls
probably
increased
by
jobs
last
month
according
to
a
reuters
survey
of
economists
after
rising
only
in
march
but
it
will
be
the
wages
figure
that
analysts
will
closely
watch
a
further
in
the
pace
of
wage
gains
could
be
the
smoking
gun
for
the
fed
to
express
any
shift
away
from
roughly
balanced
risks
to
inflation
said
mizuho
analyst
vishnu
varathan
in
a
note
for
now
we
expect
that
reactions
may
still
be
subdued
given
that
the
runway
of
evidence
remains
short
and
so
the
bearish
ust
and
bullish
usd
trades
may
not
be
taking
off
aggressively
just
investors
were
also
keeping
a
close
watch
on
trade
talks
though
analysts
said
they
had
little
confidence
that
the
delegation
in
beijing
led
by
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
will
achieve
any
breakthrough
on
the
tariff
standoff
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
chinese
shares
stumbled
with
the
index
off
percent
and
shanghai
s
sse
composite
down
percent
investors
were
cautious
after
a
largely
weak
performance
on
wall
street
on
thursday
as
some
disappointing
earnings
reports
offset
strong
economic
data
while
bond
yields
slid
after
a
surprising
slowdown
in
eurozone
inflation
the
dollar
weakened
from
a
recent
peak
against
major
currencies
during
a
choppy
session
a
day
after
the
federal
reserve
ended
a
policy
meeting
with
no
change
in
rates
and
a
less
hawkish
statement
than
investors
had
anticipated
disappointing
company
earnings
upbeat
data
on
factory
orders
and
the
trade
balance
as
well
as
the
underwhelming
eurozone
inflation
data
made
for
a
challenging
trading
environment
the
price
action
since
the
fomc
statement
indicates
a
real
division
of
opinion
in
markets
over
the
dollar
outlook
said
sean
callow
a
strategist
at
westpac
the
fed
s
reminder
that
its
inflation
target
was
symmetric
was
a
clear
negative
for
treasury
yields
and
so
the
currency
s
recovery
was
encouraging
for
dollar
bulls
callow
said
yet
the
dollar
had
failed
to
breach
key
levels
such
as
versus
the
yen
against
the
euro
and
versus
the
australian
dollar
he
added
it
was
last
down
percent
against
the
yen
to
but
was
still
set
for
a
tiny
weekly
gain
a
low
in
eurozone
inflation
should
have
been
a
big
boost
for
the
dollar
index
it
was
not
the
payrolls
report
may
not
resolve
this
market
battle
callow
added
the
dollar
had
erased
all
its
losses
in
the
past
two
weeks
on
expectations
the
fed
will
continue
to
raise
rates
even
as
other
major
central
banks
around
the
world
including
the
european
central
bank
take
longer
to
reduce
stimulus
the
dollar
index
has
risen
about
percent
so
far
this
week
and
is
on
track
for
a
third
straight
weekly
gain
the
euro
took
a
small
dip
to
be
last
at
and
is
so
far
down
percent
this
week
elsewhere
crude
dipped
cents
to
a
barrel
while
brent
crude
down
a
shade
at
gold
was
slightly
higher
with

gold
at
