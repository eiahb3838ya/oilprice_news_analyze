sources
close
to
the
qia
have
said
rosneft
could
prove
a
profitable
investment
given
the
giant
firm
is
worth
only
billion

the
fate
of
the
cefc
deal
one
of
the
largest
investments
by
china
in

was
seen
as
a
litmus
test
of
how
far
president
xi
jinping
s
government
was
prepared
to
go
with
a
crackdown
on
financially
risky
activities
among
conglomerates
rosneft
said
it
continued
to
consider
china
as
a
strategic
market
and
said
it
believed
that
qatar
s
direct
ownership
would
develop
into
new
bilateral
international
joint
projects
a
source
close
to
the
deal
said
glencore
would
keep
its
crude
offtake
agreement
with
rosneft
under
the
new
arrangement
