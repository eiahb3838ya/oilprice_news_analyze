european
powers
still
want
to
hand
donald
trump
next
week
a
plan
to
save
the
iran
nuclear
deal
but
they
have
also
started
work
on
protecting
business
ties
if
the
president
makes
good
on
a
threat
to
withdraw
six
sources
told
reuters
trump
who
says
the
accord
is
a
disaster
has
all
but
decided
to
withdraw
by
may
officials
say
and
looks
set
to
reject
four
months
of
european
efforts
to
address
his
concerns
but
france
britain
and
germany
aim
to
present
to
the
white
house
a
separate
political
agreement
that
commits
to
taking
a
tougher
stance
on
iran
if
they
can
agree
it
in
time
with
the
state
department
their
american
interlocutors
several
of
the
sources
said
they
were
sceptical
the
effort
would
succeed
and
all
said
the
europeans
were
also
working
on
damage
limitation
scenarios
if
it
fails
we
have
a
week
to
continue
talking
to
the
americans
to
see
if
we
can
find
an
agreement
on
the
deal
said
a
senior
european
diplomat
but
i
don
t
think
there
is
any
reason
to
be
overly
the
political
agreement
which
is
a
culmination
of
transatlantic
diplomacy
does
not
include
iran
or
russia
and
china
the
other
parties
to
the
accord
it
seeks
to
spell
out
to
trump
that
europe
will
seek
to
contain
tehran
s
ballistic
missile
programme
its
influence
in
syria
and
yemen
the
terms
by
which
inspectors
visit
suspect
iranian
sites
and
sunset
clauses
under
which
some
of
its
terms
expire
while
the
europeans
and
the
americans
have
narrowed
their
differences
they
are
struggling
to
agree
on
how
to
handle
a
desire
to
extend
some
of
the
limits
on
iran
s
nuclear
programme
without
reopening
the
july
accord
we
re
trying
to
find
the
right
formulas
that
respond
to
the
expectations
of
the
americans
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
go
against
the
deal
said
a
second
senior
european
diplomat
there
is
a
chance
of
getting
an
agreement
but
even
if
we
have
we
one
i
m
not
convinced
that
it
will
be
enough
to
stop
the
withdrawing
the
diplomat
said
in
their
package
for
trump
the
europeans
are
also
grappling
with
a
desire
to
make
explicit
that
iran
must
give
international
inspectors
access
to
military
sites
the
europeans
say
this
is
already
implicit
in
the
original
deal
there
s
a
view
that
the
inspection
provisions
aren
t
strong
enough
which
is
not
a
view
that
is
shared
by
the
europeans
said
a
third
diplomat
involved
in
the
discussions
france
s
president
emmanuel
macron
and
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
are
continuing
to
lobby
trump
but
with
the
prospect
of
him
changing
his
mind
remote
the
focus
has
shifted
to
managing
the
fallout
and
avoiding
a
dangerous
vacuum
macron
in
washington
last
week
proposed
that
irrespective
of
trump
s
decision
there
should
be
a
wider
discussion
between
iran
and
the
powers
behind
the
original
deal
which
took
years
to
negotiate
working
towards
a
grand
bargain
that
would
incorporate
the
existing
nuclear
deal
and
the
issues
currently
discussed
between
europeans
and
americans
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
iran
could
be
brought
back
to
the
table
tehran
says
it
is
abiding
by
the
terms
of
the
deal
and
has
no
intention
to
renegotiate
it
iranian
foreign
minister
mohammad
javad
zarif
on
thursday
rejected
any
form
of
renegotiation
france
britain
and
germany
all
say
they
will
stay
in
the
deal
even
if
the
united
states
withdraws
and
try
to
protect
and
foster
trade
with
iran
that
has
soared
since
the
european
union
lifted
most
of
its
economic
sanctions
on
iran
iran
s
exports
of
mainly
fuel
and
other
energy
products
to
the
eu
in
jumped
percent
to
billion
euros
billion
compared
to
the
previous
year
while
investment
in
iran
jumped
to
more
than
billion
euros
if
trump
can
t
be
persuaded
not
to
withdraw
the
solution
is
to
encourage
the
americans
to
keep
conditions
that
enable
our
companies
in
related
sectors
to
continue
to
trade
said
a
french
official
the
german
economy
ministry
said
it
was
waiting
for
a
formal
decision
on
the
iran
deal
before
deciding
whether
to
stop
offering
german
firms
export
guarantees
for
business
deals
with
tehran
such
guarantees
provide
state
protection
for
companies
doing
business
abroad
when
foreign
debtors
fail
to
pay
the
prospect
of
trade
with
europe
would
provide
the
europeans
with
a
chance
to
assuage
the
iranians
and
dissuade
them
from
rash
decisions
such
as
leaving
the
deal
or
reviving
the
nuclear
activities
they
agreed
to
give
up
countermeasures
could
include
a
special
eu
blocking
statute
developed
in
the
but
never
fully
used
to
shield
european
firms
doing
business
with
iran
from
legal
action
if
washington
reimposes
sanctions
but
eu
plans
to
keep
money
flowing
to
iran
would
require
the
united
states
to
approve
export
credit
facilities
and
other
funding
support
to
help
firms
enter
iran
without
fear
of
american
legal
ramifications
two
european
officials
said
reviving
the
blocking
statutes
would
still
be
mostly
a
symbolic
step
to
show
the
iranians
that
europe
was
committed
to
the
deal
in
practice
companies
would
fear
that
investing
in
iran
would
harm
their
commercial
interests
with
the
united
states
a
senior
iranian
official
agreed
these
are
good
ideas
to
show
the
europeans
are
committed
to
the
agreement
but
we
think
that
if
they
have
to
choose
between
iran
and
the
united
states
they
will
choose
the
america
