providing
clean
energy
to
somalis
including
those
uprooted
from
their
homes
in
the
country
could
both
improve
lives
there
and
provide
new
opportunities
for
entrepreneurs
the
envoy
to
somalia
said
despite
persistent
violence
somalia
is
slowly
sorting
its
problems
out
with
efforts
underway
to
rebuild
the
state
raise
more
tax
revenue
and
improve
security
said
michael
keating
the
highest
united
nations
official
in
the
horn
of
africa
nation
that
image
of
somalia
that
is
dominated
by
bombs
and
hunger
is
really
out
of
date
keating
said
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
on
energy
access
in
lisbon
this
week
the
issue
is
how
can
energy
contribute
to
moving
the
country
forward
as
the
population
grows
climate
change
and
environmental
degradation
are
contributing
to
the
many
problems
faced
by
somalis
who
are
competing
for
natural
resources
such
as
land
wood
and
water
keating
said
that
in
turn
is
fuelling
tensions
people
are
drifting
into
cities
where
they
can
t
sustain
themselves
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
in
an
interview
some
million
people
have
been
displaced
from
their
homes
inside
somalia
and
another
are
registered
as
refugees
in
other
countries
according
to
figures
some
have
fled
fighting
while
others
have
been
forced
to
abandon
their
farms
due
to
drought
but
the
legacy
of
years
of
civil
war
is
not
all
bad
keating
noted
left
with
little
functioning
electricity
infrastructure
somalia
has
the
chance
to
leapfrog
to
a
more
nimble
approach
using
local
grids
powered
by
renewable
energy
the
need
is
pressing
with
a
report
on
progress
towards
global
energy
goals
this
week
showing
only
percent
of
somalis
had
access
to
electricity
in
up
from
percent
in
just
percent
are
able
to
use
clean
fuels
for
cooking
with
the
rest
resorting
to
dirtier
forms
of
energy
such
as
kerosene
and
charcoal
which
are
damaging
to
health
keating
has
been
talking
to
the
government
about
whether
somalia
can
make
itself
into
a
clean
energy
country
drawing
on
solar
wind
and
hydropower
from
its
two
big
rivers
he
said
in
to
local
energy
providers
banded
together
to
form
a
power
generation
transmission
and
distribution
company
called
beco
which
is
slowly
shifting
to
solar
energy
he
noted
beco
supplies
megawatts
mw
of
power
operating
in
the
capital
mogadishu
and
other
cities
including
afgooye
and
kismayo
the
company
aims
to
boost
its
solar
power
generation
capacity
by
mw
annually
eventually
reducing
the
share
of
power
produced
from
fossil
fuels
mainly
diesel
to
less
than
percent
according
to
the
united
nations
other
smaller
enterprises
such
as
power
offgrid
in
jowhar
are
providing
solar
home
systems
and
solar
equipment
to
run
irrigation
pumps
for
farmers
and
cold
storage
for
clinics
and
local
businesses
ironically
somalia
is
a
great
place
to
try
and
get
things
going
said
keating
however
people
are
concerned
about
security
and
at
a
certain
point
you
do
need
more
government
few
market
restrictions
are
imposed
on
businesses
but
that
can
lead
to
overlapping
provision
in
some
places
and
inconsistent
standards
he
noted
agencies
and
other
development
organisations
can
support
somalia
s
push
for
clean
energy
and
universal
access
by
bringing
together
government
business
and
communities
to
chart
a
way
forward
and
providing
information
about
what
has
worked
in
similar
environments
keating
said
the
international
community
can
also
mobilise
finance
but
attracting
investment
from
the
somali
diaspora
around
the
world
is
key
he
added
for
somalia
s
large
displaced
population
many
crammed
into
informal
settlements
in
the
capital
gaining
access
to
clean
energy
is
a
question
of
dignity
as
well
as
safety
he
said
it
about
giving
people
who
live
in
very
tough
circumstances
the
opportunity
to
contribute
to
their
own
welfare
and
make
a
living
at
the
same
time
