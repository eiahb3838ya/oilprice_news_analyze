the

we
see
growing
potential
for
floating
wind
projects
rummelhoff
said
we
expect
about
gw
floating
offshore
wind
to
be
installed
by
on
a
global
basis
we
hope
to
take
a
fair
share
of
floating
turbines
could
help
to
harness
wind
energy
beyond
the
shallow
waters
where
turbines
stand
on
fixed

rummelhoff
said
we
see
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
use
our
engineers
but
we
have
not
decided
to
go
all
in
