russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
oil
prices
should
be
taken
into
consideration
when
any
decision
is
taken
by
countries
and
no
emergency
action
to
stem
a
decline
in
oil
prices
is
warranted
he
was
talking
as
oil
markets
fell
again
on
wednesday
extending
losses
from
a
percent
plunge
the
previous
session
as
surging
supply
and
the
spectre
of
faltering
demand
scared
off
investors
novak
said
oil
prices
have
averaged
around
per
barrel
this
year
the
market
is
quite
volatile
today
we
remember
that
the
oil
price
was
sharply
rising
in
the
same
way
now
it
is
going
down
we
have
to
look
into
development
into
how
the
price
will
be
stabilised
he
told
reporters
on
the
sideline
of
an
international
conference
in
singapore
it
s
not
right
for
market
participants
to
react
to
any
fluctuations
he
said
he
also
said
that
the
oil
market
still
does
not
fully
understand
the
fallout
from
the
sanctions
against
iran
and
how
buyers
will
behave
he
said
that
russia
has
been
cutting
oil
production
by
around
barrels
per
day
so
far
in
november
