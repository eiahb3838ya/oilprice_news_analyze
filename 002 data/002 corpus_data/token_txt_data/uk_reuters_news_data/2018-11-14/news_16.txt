biofuel groups ask federal judge to freeze u.s. refinery waiver program
new
york
reuters
a
group
representing
biofuel
companies
asked
a
federal
judge
on
tuesday
to
force
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
stop
exempting
small
refineries
from
renewable
fuel
laws
until
a
lawsuit
challenging
the
agency
s
actions
is
resolved
producers
united
argued
among
other
things
the
epa
violated
the
law
when
it
issued
retroactive
biofuel
credits
to
hollyfrontier
and
sinclair
oil
this
year
as
part
of
a
legal
settlement
the
epa
s
decision
first
reported
by
reuters
lowers
statutory
renewable
fuel
mandates
without
any
required
public
notice
the
group
alleges
in
the
challenge
filed
in
appelate
court
in
washington
several
biofuel
organizations
have
brought
similar
lawsuits
against
the
epa
related
to
small
refinery
hardship
waivers
but
producers
united
is
the
first
to
ask
a
judge
to
freeze
the
program
the
group
did
not
disclose
its
members
the
epa
declined
to
comment
we
don
t
comment
on
pending
litigation
an
agency
spokesman
said
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
requires
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
their
fuel
pool
or
buy
compliance
credits
from
competitors
who
do
refineries
with
a
capacity
less
than
can
receive
waivers
if
they
prove
compliance
would
cause
them
disproportionate
hardship
the
epa
under
president
donald
trump
has
greatly
expanded
the
waiver
program
awarding
exemptions
for
the
calendar
year
up
from
in
and
just
seven
in
epa
data
shows
the
epa
says
lawsuits
brought
by
hollyfrontier
and
sinclair
forced
the
agency
to
expand
the
definition
of
hardship
but
biofuel
groups
say
the
shift
was
politically
motivated
and
driven
by
former
epa
administrator
scott
pruitt
the
epa
gave
hollyfrontier
nearly
million
worth
of
credits
for
this
year
to
reverse
denial
of
a
waiver
for
one
of
its
wyoming
plants
dating
back
to
sinclair
received
waivers
worth
undisclosed
millions
for
two
facilities
in
the
same
state
for
and
both
companies
had
challenged
epa
s
denials
in
a
federal
appellate
court
in
colorado
in
producers
united
claims
the
epa
s
expansion
of
the
program
was
done
largely
in
secret
and
must
be
legally
scrutinized
before
it
can
be
allowed
to
continue
it
also
argues
the
judges
in
the
holly
and
sinclair
cases
did
not
require
the
epa
to
issue
retroactive
credits
nor
did
they
say
the
refineries
deserved
to
be
exempted
the
epa
lacks
the
authority
to
issue
the
retroactive
credits
the
group
argued
the
epa
is
still
considering
one
application
for
a
hardship
waiver
according
to
the
group
which
wants
to
ensure
it
does
not
result
in
more
retroactive
credits
