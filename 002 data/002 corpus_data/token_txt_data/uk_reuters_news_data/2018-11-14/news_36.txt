global
oil
supply
will
outpace
demand
throughout
as
a
relentless
rise
in
output
swamps
growth
in
consumption
that
is
at
risk
from
a
slowing
economy
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
wednesday
in
its
monthly
report
the
iea
left
its
forecast
for
global
demand
growth
for
and
unchanged
from
last
month
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
but
cut
its
forecast
for
demand
growth
the
engine
of
expansion
in
world
oil
consumption
for
the
first
half
of
based
on
its
outlook
for
production
and
global
demand
and
assuming
flat
opec
production
the

said
the

million
bpd
output
around
the
world
has
swelled
since
the
middle
of
the
year
while
an
escalating
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
threatens
global
economic
growth
on
wednesday
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
told
reuters
that
opec
and
its
partners
are
discussing
a
proposal
to
cut
oil
output
by
up
to
million
bpd
for
to
avert
an
oversupply
that
would
weaken
prices
since
early
october
the
oil
price
has
fallen
by
a
quarter
to
below
a
barrel
its
lowest
in
eight
months
which
may
protect
demand
to
an
extent
the
iea
said
while
slower
economic
growth
in
some
countries
reduces
the
outlook
for
oil
demand
a
significant
downward
revision
to
our
price
assumption
is
supportive
it
added
the
agency
raised
its
forecast
for
oil
output
growth
from
countries
outside
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
million
bpd
this
year
and
million
bpd
next
year
versus
its
previous
estimate
of
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
the
united
states
will
lead
output
growth
the
iea
estimates
total
oil
supply
will
rise
by
million
bpd
this
year
and
another
million
bpd
in
from
a
current
record
of
more
than
million
bpd
opec
crude
output
rose
by
bpd
in
october
to
million
bpd
up
bpd
on
a
year
ago
as
losses
of
bpd
from
iran
and
bpd
from
venezuela
were
easily
offset
by
increases
from
others
such
as
saudi
arabia
or
the
united
arab
emirates
next
year
there
is
expected
to
be
even
less
need
for
opec
oil
due
to
relentless
growth
in
supply
the
iea
said
adding
that
it
had
cut
its
forecast
for
demand
for
opec
crude
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
inventories
of
oil
in
oecd
countries
rose
by
million
barrels
in
september
to
billion
barrels
the
iea
said
adding
that
for
the
third
quarter
as
a
whole
stocks
rose
million
barrels
or
at
a
rate
of
bpd
the
biggest
increase
since
