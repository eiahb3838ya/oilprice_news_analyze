colau
added
georgios
kaminis
mayor
of
athens
which
is
also
feeling
the

the
eu
should
provide
direct

discussed
as
cities

the
european

work

how

he
added
at
national
level
colau
called
on
the
spanish
government
to
support
cities
by
boosting
investment
in
infrastructure
for
public
transport
and
cutting
subsidies
for
diesel
immediately
the
government
on
tuesday
published
a
draft

energy
transition
that
it
hopes
to
present

the
document
proposes
setting
a
timetable
to
phase
out
subsidies

with
an
overall
goal
of
decarbonising
the
economy
as
well
as
a
ban
on
sales
of
petrol
diesel
and
hybrid
cars
from
minister
for
ecological
transition
teresa
ribera
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
government
wanted
to
work
with
cities
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
achieve
emissions
reductions
and
build
resilience
to
climate
change
impacts
alone
but
putting
together
their
own
plans
would
enable
them
to
identify
where
cooperation
with
different
institutions
is
needed
she
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
barcelona
conference
the
spanish
government
wants
to
assist
and
is
working
on
reforms
to
help
finance
flow
to
the
municipal
level
she
added
mayors
stressed
the
urgency
for
all
levels
of
government
to
move
faster
in
line
with
a
recent
report
from
the
climate
science
panel
on
ways
the
world
can
keep
warming
to
degrees
celsius

change
said
cities
worldwide
had
pledged
to
develop
plans
by
the
end
of
to
help
meet
the
lower
warming
goal
in
the
paris
agreement
we
are
strongly
committed
the
people
of
milan
strongly
understand
that
if
we
go
beyond
it
will
be
a
disaster
sala
said
the
italian
city
is
taking
measures
on
a
large
scale
to
get
people
out
of
cars
and
onto
public
transport
such
as
building
a
fifth
metro
line
connecting
the
airport
to
the
city
centre
and
changing
its
fleet
of
buses
to
run
on
electricity
athens
meanwhile
is
rolling
out
ways
to
protect
residents
from
heatwaves
such
as
an
app
to
alert
them
and
directing
elderly
people
in
poorer
neighbourhoods
to
green
spaces
and
public
buildings
where
they
can

s
governing
mayor
michael
muller
said
the
german
city
had
been
taking
back
control
of
energy
housing
and
transport
in
the
city
after
many
operations
were
privatised
in
the
so
that
it
can
move
them
onto
a
cleaner
path
faster
colau
noted
that
barcelona
is
setting
up
its
own
power
company
to
drive
a
shift
towards
percent
renewable
sources
if
a
city
can
do
this
what
can
a
state
do
if
they
put
the
political
will
to
it
it
is
time
to
be
brave
