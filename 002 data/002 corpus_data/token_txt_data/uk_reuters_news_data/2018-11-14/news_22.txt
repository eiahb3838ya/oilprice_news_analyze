fish and chips under threat from plastic-clogged seas, uk charity warns
london

britain
s
fish
and
chips
one
of
the
nation
s
favourite
staples
is
under
threat
from
the
deluge
of
plastic
waste
that
is
choking
seas
and
endangering
marine
life
a
leading
environmental
charity
warned
on
wednesday
to
highlight
the
risk
plastic
oceans
uk
teamed
up
with
a
chippie
in
the
northern
city
of
blackburn
to
serve
hungry
customers
battered
plastic
instead
of
the
usual
cod
with
their
chips
the
amount
of
plastic
reaching
the
ocean
threatens
not
only
the
future
of
fish
but
our
future
too
if
we
continue
at
this
rate
not
only
will
our
beloved
national
dish
be
a
thing
of
the
past
but
we
ll
be
facing
other
catastrophic
problems
for
our
planet
said
geoff
brighty
technical
director
of

uk
plastic
oceans
futurefishandchips
campaign
is
the
latest
in
a
string
of
global
efforts
by
environmental
groups
and
the
united
nations
to
pare
back
use
that
is
also
clogging
landfills
big
brands
from
coke
to
kellogs
have
also
pledged
to
cut
all
plastic
waste
from
their
operations
as
public
pressure
mounts
for
manufacturers
and
retailers
when
you
look
at
how
much
plastic
is
now
believed
to
be
entering
into
the
environment
it
s
somewhere
between
four
and
million
tons
every
year
and
it
s
projected
to
grow
to
over
million
tons
by
which
is
a
considerable
amount
of
material
to
go
into
the
oceans
and
we
can
already
see
it
s
causing
impacts
on
beaches
and
in
fisheries
brighty
said
so
it
s
not
too
much
of
a
stretch
of
imagination
to
think
that
if
we
don
t
stop
this
it
will
start
to
impact
on
fish
populations
and
fish
the
hungry
customers
served
up
battered
plastic
were
initially
irate
but
appreciated
the
stunt
when
it
was
explained
to
them
you
watch
television
and
you
see
the
oceans
and
go
on
social
media
and
see
all
these
bottles
all
over
the
place
but
then
until
it
s
actually
served
on
a
plate
to
you
it
s
just
kind
of
it
s
a
bit
of
an
eye
opener
when
you
find
out
what
it
s
really
about
one
of
the
customers
