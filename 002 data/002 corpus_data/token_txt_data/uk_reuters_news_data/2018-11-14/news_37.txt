geneva
reuters
the
united
states
has
chosen
the
wrong
path
in
reimposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
will
be
defeated
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
said
wednesday
according
to
the
tasnim
news
agency
washington
reinstated
sanctions
targeting
iran
s
oil
industry
on
as
it
seeks
to
force
the
islamic
republic
to
accept
tougher
curbs
on
its
nuclear
programme
halt
its
development
of
ballistic
missiles
as
well
as
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
syria
iraq
lebanon
and
yemen
the
americans
will
definitely
be
defeated
in
this
path
the
path
they
have
chosen
is
wrong
and
incorrect
rouhani
said
if
they
are
being
honest
and
they
are
looking
for
regional
security
this
is
not
the
path
if
they
are
being
honest
and
respect
the
iranian
people
this
is
not
the
he
added
they
have
made
themselves
more
infamous
in
the
world
and
in
front
of
our
people
it
s
clear
for
everyone
that
the
incorrect
and
cruel
sanctions
of
america
will
harm
the
dear
and
honourable
people
of
our
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
said
tuesday
that
washington
intends
to
step
up
enforcement
of
sanctions
on
iran
and
squeeze
them
very
bolton
also
reiterated
that
the
united
states
aims
to
reduce
iranian
oil
exports
to
zero
that
objective
will
not
be
achieved
rouhani
said
they
thought
they
could
completely
cut
iran
s
oil
but
in
recent
days
they
understood
that
this
is
not
practical
or
possible
both
because
of
their
internal
issues
and
because
of
the
price
of
oil
rouhani
said
according
to
the
iranian
students
news
agency
isna
he
added
more
than
anything
the
americans
understood
that
we
will
sell
our
oil
we
have
so
many
ways
and
paths
to
sell
oil
that
their
sanctions
are
president
donald
trump
reimposed
sanctions
after
withdrew
the
united
states
from
world
powers
nuclear
deal
with
iran
reached
before
he
took
office
the
other
signatories
germany
france
britain
russia
and
china
remain
committed
to
the
deal
iran
has
said
it
will
stay
in
it
only
if
the
other
powers
preserve
its
economic
benefits
against
pressure
iranian
officials
and
some
independent
analysts
said
last
week
that
iran
is
likely
to
ride
out
the
storm
from
oil
sanctions
suffering
recession
but
no
economic
meltdown
thanks
to
rising
crude
prices
and
deepening
divisions
between
the
united
states
and
other
major
powers
