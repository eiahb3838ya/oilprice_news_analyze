war

for
container
shipping
in

maersk
s
data
indicated
that
imports
into
the
united
states
from
china
had
grown
to

in
the
third
quarter
as
companies
such
as
walmart
and
home
depot
built
up
inventories
to
avoid
new
import
tariffs
chief
executive
soren
skou
said
the
irony
is
that
after
president
donald
trump
has
turned
up
the
rhetoric
the
united
states
has
started
importing
even
more
from
china
skou
told
reporters
but
there
will
definitely
be
a
price
for
the
container
industry
to
be
paid
he
said
noting
that
the
recent
spike
in
shipments
would
be
followed
by
a
slowdown
