recouping
some
of
the
previous
session
s
heavy
on
growing
prospects
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allied
producers
would
cut
output
at
a
meeting
next
month
to
prop
up
prices
after
a
record
straight
days
of
losses
and
the
steepest
loss
in
more
than
three
years
the
oil
market
reversed
course
after
reuters
reported
that
opec
and
its
partners
were
discussing
a
proposal
to
cut
output
by
up
to
million
barrels
per
day

than

had
mentioned
previously

for
straight
sessions
to
the

pared

in

as
the

said

oil
markets
are
being
pressured
by
surging
supply
from
opec
russia
the
unites
states
and
other
producers
and
worries
that
a
global
economic
slowdown
could
cut
into
energy
demand
this
has
pushed
the
price
of
global
benchmark
brent
down
more
than
percent
since
early
october
one
of
the
biggest
declines
since
a
price
collapse
in
the
market
has
cratered
over
the
last
few
weeks
and
the
pop
today
is
related
to
the
chatter
that
producers
could
cut
up
to
million
bpd
in
said
gene
mcgillian
vice
president
of

research
for
tradition
energy
in
stamford
connecticut
maybe
some
of
the
fears
of
extra
supplies
and
reduced
demand
have
finally
been
priced
into
the
market
but
i
wouldn
t
say
that
a
bottom
has
set
in
as
oil
has
crashed
from
its
october
high
natural
gas
futures
soared
as
much
as
percent
during
that
time
to
a
year
high
oil
s
latest
was
exacerbated
as
traders
unwound
long
natural
gas
trades
market
participants
said
the
relative
strength
index
rsi
for
both
brent
and
crude
remained
below
a
technical
level
often
regarded
as
signaling
a
market
that
has
fallen
too
far
financial
firms
hedging
the
risk
incurred
by
selling
put
options
to
oil
producers
generated
added
downward
pressure
when
prices
fell
toward
option
strikes
goldman

said
in

this
market
is
attempting
to
find
a
price
bottom
following
an
unprecedented
consecutive
days
of
decline
jim
ritterbusch
president
of
ritterbusch

said
in
a
note
although
the
supply
surplus
is
still
relatively
modest
the
market
is
focusing
on
the
dynamic
of
expansion
in
the
overhang
that
will
need
to
show
signs
of
reversal

a
