russia
s
energy
minister
said
on
wednesday
no
emergency
action
was
warranted
to
stem
a
decline
in
oil
prices
as
crude
benchmarks
fell
again
alexander
novak
reporters
on
the
sideline
of
an
international
conference
in
singapore
that
oil
prices
should
be
taken
into
consideration
when
any
decision
was
taken
by
oil
producing
countries
he
was
talking
as
oil
markets
fell
again
extending
losses
from
a
percent
plunge
the
previous
session
as
surging
supply
and
the
spectre
of
faltering
demand
scared
off
investors
novak
said
oil
prices
had
averaged
around
per
barrel
this
year
the
market
is
quite
volatile
today
we
remember
that
the
oil
price
was
sharply
rising
in
the
same
way
now
it
is
going
down
we
have
to
look
into
development
into
how
the
price
will
be
stabilised
he
said
it
s
not
right
for
market
participants
to
react
to
any
fluctuations
he
said
novak
also
said
the
oil
market
still
did
not
fully
understand
the
fallout
from
sanctions
against
iran
and
how
buyers
would
behave
the
united
states
announced
the
reinstatement
of
sanctions
earlier
this
month
against
iran
over
tehran
s
activities
in
the
middle
east
eight
importing
countries
have
been
given
temporary
exemptions
by
the
united
states
to
keep
buying
iranian
oil
prompting
iranian
president
hassan
rouhani
to
say
washington
would
not
be
able
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
i
think
the
market
is
volatile
due
to
a
lot
of
uncertainty
novak
said
he
said
russia
had
been
cutting
oil
production
by
around
barrels
per
day
so
far
in
november
from
the
record
high
of
million
bpd
in
october
