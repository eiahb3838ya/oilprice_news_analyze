wrapup 2-u.s. consumer inflation rises; oil prices may slow momentum
washington
reuters
consumer
prices
increased
by
the
most
in
nine
months
in
october
amid
gains
in
the
cost
of
gasoline
and
rents
pointing
to
steadily
rising
inflation
that
likely
will
keep
the
federal
reserve
on
track
to
raise
interest
rates
again
next
month
though
overall
inflation
could
slow
in
the
months
ahead
following
a
recent
slump
in
oil
prices
economists
said
fed
officials
were
likely
to
regard
any
retreat
as
temporary
and
focus
on
underlying
price
pressures
the
central
bank
which
has
a
percent
inflation
target
left
interest
rates
unchanged
last
thursday
after
a
policy
meeting
in
its
policy
statement
the
fed
noted
that
annual
inflation
measures
remain
near
fed
officials
are
likely
to
look
past
the
swings
in
energy
prices
that
could
slow
the
overall
cpi
in
coming
months
to
see
further
upward
pressure
on
underlying
prices
said
ben
ayers
senior
economist
at
nationwide
in
columbus
ohio
as
such
we
still
expect
the
fed
to
raise
interest
rates
in
the
labor
department
said
on
wednesday
its
consumer
price
index
rose
percent
last
month
the
biggest
gain
since
january
after
edging
up
percent
in
september
in
the
months
through
october
the
cpi
increased
percent
picking
up
from
september
s
percent
rise
excluding
the
volatile
food
and
energy
components
the
cpi
climbed
percent
the
core
cpi
had
gained
percent
for
two
straight
months
in
the
months
through
october
the
core
cpi
increased
percent
after
advancing
percent
in
september
economists
polled
by
reuters
had
forecast
the
cpi
climbing
percent
and
the
core
cpi
gaining
percent
in
october
the
dollar
was
weaker
against
a
basket
of
currencies
after
touching
a
high
earlier
this
week
while
treasury
yields
fell
stocks
on
wall
street
initially
rose
on
the
inflation
data
and
a
rebound
in
oil
prices
which
tumbled
more
than
percent
on
tuesday
before
moving
lower
oil
prices
have
lost
more
than
a
quarter
of
their
value
since
early
october
amid
a
surge
in
supply
and
increasing
concerns
about
an
economic
slowdown
the
drag
on
inflation
from
oil
prices
is
likely
to
be
offset
by
a
tightening
labour
market
which
is
spurring
faster
wage
growth
the
unemployment
rate
is
at
nearly
a
low
of
percent
and
annual
wage
growth
recorded
its
largest
increase
in
years
in
october
in
the
to
we
believe
this
increase
in
wage
growth
will
both
push
up
business
costs
as
well
as
support
demand
leading
to
firming
price
inflation
said
michael
feroli
an
economist
at
jpmorgan
in
new
york
in
the
however
the
consumer
price
outlook
will
be
challenged
by
the
stronger
dollar
and
weaker
energy
the
fed
s
preferred
inflation
measure
the
personal
consumption
expenditures
pce
price
index
excluding
food
and
energy
increased
percent
for
five
straight
months
economists
believe
the
core
pce
price
index
slipped
just
below
percent
in
october
the
government
will
publish
the
pce
price
index
data
at
the
end
of
the
month
core
inflation
that
is
close
to
but
just
below
target
will
not
prevent
the
fed
from
raising
rates
in
december
said
andrew
hollenhorst
an
economist
at
citigroup
in
new
york
however
it
strengthens
the
argument
that
aggressive
hikes
are
unnecessary
despite
continued
strong
last
month
gasoline
prices
rebounded
percent
accounting
for
more
than
of
the
increase
in
the
cpi
after
slipping
percent
in
september
food
prices
fell
percent
after
being
unchanged
in
september
food
consumed
at
home
declined
for
a
second
straight
month
in
october
held
down
by
cheaper

owners
equivalent

percent
in
october
after
advancing
percent
in
the
prior
month
healthcare
costs
increased
percent
last
month
after
a
similar
gain
in
september
apparel
prices
edged
up
percent
after
jumping
percent
in
september
there
were
also
increases
in
the
costs
of
household
furnishings
and
used
motor
vehicles
and
trucks
as
well
as

insurance
and
tobacco
