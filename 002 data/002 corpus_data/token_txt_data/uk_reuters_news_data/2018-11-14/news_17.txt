pakistan
s
engro
said
on
wednesday
it
will
be
a
year
before
it
can
go
ahead
with
a
new
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
import
terminal
as
domestic
gas
regulations
need
clarifying
and
new
pipeline
commitments
are
required
the
conglomerate
also
said
friction
with
the
new
government
of
prime
minister
imran
khan
over
the
terms
of
the
country
s
first
lng
import
terminal
which
the
company
operates
has
had
no
impact
on
the
progress
of
its
lng
plans
royal
dutch
shell
trading
house
gunvor
and
local
company
fatima
are
partners
in
engro
s
second
planned
terminal
which
would
be
located
at
port
qasim
with
a
floating
storage
and
regasification
unit
fsru
vessel
processing
the
gas
my
best
guess
is
we
need
at
least
another
year
said
syed
ammar
shah
head
of
business
development
at
engro
elengy
terminal
adding
his
company
was
in
advanced
talks
with
a
provider
of
the
fsru
we
re
working
with
someone
the
term
sheets
have
been
signed
we
have
conducted
due
diligence
of
the
vessel
but
i
can
not
say
the
name
of
the
provider
he
told
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in
london
engro
would
then
need
around
to
months
to
bring
the
project
into
operation
making
a
date
more
realistic
than
as
previously
expected
pakistan
imported
million
tonnes
of
lng
this
year
thanks
to
two
import
terminals
that
began
operations
in
and
together
with
india
and
bangladesh
it
is
seen
as
a
huge
market
opportunity
owing
to
its
large
population
and
high
gas
usage
however
meeting
the
growing
demand
for
gas
as
pakistan
s
indigenous
supplies
fall
is
complex
pipelines
from
the
coastal
south
to
northern
regions
are
full
and
new
ones
are
needed
such
as
a
pipeline
discussed
with
russia
s
rostec
in
addition
there
is
confusion
about
which
sectors
get
which
gas
at
what
price
with
domestic
gas
subsidised
and
cheaper
than
imported
lng
although
the
lack
of
clarity
may
not
be
a
stumbling
block
shah
said
there
are
two
sectors
right
now
that
do
not
need
that
clarity
which
is
the
power
sector
and
the
cng
compressed
natural
gas
sector
and
there
is
enough
demand
in
both
to
support
these
terminals
he
said
pakistan
s
new
government
has
targeted
for
investigation
business
deals
struck
by
the
government
of
ousted
premier
nawaz
sharif
the
petroleum
minister
said
last
month
the
previous
administration
had
paid
too
much
for
the
first
terminal
however
on
wednesday
engro
maintained
its
stance
that
not
only
the
terminal
partly
financed
by
the
world
bank
s
international
finance
corp
was
globally
competitive
but
that
the
contract
could
not
be
renegotiated
they
the
government
said
they
want
a
discussion
but
they
haven
t
actually
contacted
us
jahangir
piracha
chief
executive
of
engro
elengy
terminal
said
also
speaking
in
london
asked
if
the
spat
delayed
or
influenced
plans
for
the
second
terminal
he
said
i
don
t
think
so
because
i
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
the
pakistani
government
they
have
generally
honoured
all
