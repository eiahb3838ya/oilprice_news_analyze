a

told
reuters
on
wednesday
the
money
to

area
off
the

according
to
the

part

the

working
on
the
transition
to
a
new
government
in
brazil
the

next

clears
congress
american
depositary

added

brazil
s
senate
has
a
bill
that
would
open
the
way
for
the
auction
and
possibly
for
the
payment
to
petrobras
a
dispute
over
the
oil
in
question
dates
back
to
when
the
brazilian
government
granted
petrobras
the
right
to
extract
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
gas
in
the
offshore
santos
basin
the
government
received
additional
shares
in
petrobras
in
return
based
on
oil
prices
at
the
time
but
volume
of
oil
is
now
estimated
to
be
much
larger
and
the
government
wants
to
sell
the
rights
to
extract
the
extra
oil
in
the
area
the
choice
reserves
can
not
be
auctioned
until
the
government
and
petrobras
resolve
a
dispute
over
the
transaction
among
other
things
the
contract
stipulated
that
costs
would
be
reviewed
after
the
area
was
declared
commercially
viable
in
which
has
led
to
years
of
sparring
as
oil
prices
have
fluctuated
the
senate
bill
also
includes
a
provision
allowing
petrobras
to
cede
up
to
a
percent
stake
in
the
area
to
other
oil
firms
