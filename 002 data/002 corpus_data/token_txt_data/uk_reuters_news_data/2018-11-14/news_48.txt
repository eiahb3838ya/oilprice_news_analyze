oil
prices
have
fallen
sharply
since
passing
a
cyclical
peak
at
the
start
of
october
amid
surging
production
and
mounting
concerns
about
the
state
of
the
global
economy
and
the
outlook
for
consumption
growth
in
brent
futures
prices
have
dropped
by
more
than
per
barrel
percent
over
the
last
five
weeks
while
wti
futures
prices
have
declined
for
a
record
days
in
a
row
opec
and
its
allies
who
were
talking
about
increasing
production
as
recently
as
october
to
offset
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iran
are
now
openly
discussing
the
need
for
output
cuts
to
avert
a
in
stocks
some
commentators
have
expressed
surprise
at
the
rapid
turn
round
in
the
market
outlook
for
to
oversupply
but
in
fact
such
shifts
have
been
fairly
common
the
prospective
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
masked
a
big
shift
in
the
market
outlook
in
recent
months
as
oil
production
accelerated
while
consumption
growth
showed
signs
of
slowing
once
the
threat
of
severe
sanctions
was
lifted
at
least
for
the
time
being
the
market
refocused
on
the
deteriorating
background
and
prices
have
adjusted
downwards
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
played
the
same
role
in
as
the
disruption
of
libya
s
oil
exports
and
advance
of
islamist
fighters
across
northern
iraq
played
in
the
initial
risk
of
tough
sanctions
on
iran
kept
oil
prices
elevated
even
as
surging
shale
production
and
sluggish
growth
in
oil
consumption
pointed
towards
an
emerging
surplus
in
the
event
the
united
states
offered
more
generous
waivers
to
enable
iran
s
customers
to
continue
purchasing
crude
backing
away
from
an
earlier
strategy
of
cutting
iran
s
exports
to
zero
much
the
same
thing
happened
in
june
when
islamist
fighters
failed
to
capture
the
oilfields
around
kirkuk
and
iraqi
kurdistan
or
advance
towards
the
oilfields
in
the
south
contrary
to
earlier
fears
with
the
resumption
of
oil
exports
from
libya
and
the
continuation
of
shipments
from
iraq
oil
traders
turned
their
attention
to
the
accelerating
shale
production
and
fading
consumption
growth
in
the
second
half
of
crude
and
condensates
production
surged
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
months
to
august
even
more
than
the
million
bpd
increase
in
the
months
to
june
opec
is
again
forecasting
that
production
increases
will
outstrip
global
consumption
growth
in
reducing
the
need
for
its
own
oil
a
of
conditions
in
the
middle
of
faced
with
accelerating
production
and
decelerating
consumption
opec
and
its
allies
face
the
same
dilemma
as
in
june
cut
output
to
support
prices
or
allow
prices
to
fall
to
protect
market
share
in
opec
opted
to
leave
output
unchanged
and
allow
prices
to
fall
in
a
bid
to
curb
surging
shale
production
a
strategy
that
proved
successful
ultimately
but
ravaged
the
finances
of
its
members
opec
ministers
must
decide
whether
to
pursue
a
similar
course
in
or
cut
their
own
output
at
the
risk
of
prolonging
the
shale
boom
and
sacrificing
more
market
share
the
oil
market
is
a
complex
adaptive
system
which
exhibits
highly
dynamics
and
regularly
cycles
between
periods
of
and
oversupply
like
other
complex
systems
the
market
can
shift
from
one
phase
undersupply
to
another
oversupply
very
rapidly
and
with
little
warning
cyclical
behaviour
of
the
oil
market
reuters
june
so
the
switch
from
fears
about
prospective
undersupply
in
august
and
september
to
concerns
about
emerging
oversupply
in
october
and
november
should
not
really
come
as
a
surprise
there
have
been
strong
indications
for
some
time
that
the
oil
market
was
nearing
a
cyclical
peak
based
on
accelerating
production
and
decelerating
consumption
trends
hedge
fund
managers
have
cut
their
bullish
positions
in
crude
to
close
to
the
lowest
level
for
two
years
in
a
sign
that
sentiment
has
shifted
decisively
the
critical
question
is
whether
the
price
surge
will
now
be
followed
by
a
period
of
consolidation
just
below
the
recent
peak
as
in
and
or
a
deep
slump
and
at
this
point
it
is
impossible
to
determine
which
outcome
is
more
likely
but
it
will
most
likely
depend
on
the
interplay
between
four
main
factors
opec
and
russia
s
decision
on
whether
to
focus
on
protecting
prices
or
market
share
shale
production
s
responsiveness

moderately
