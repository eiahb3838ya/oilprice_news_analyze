said
on

she
assumes
the
united
states
will
not
slap
auto
tariffs
on
the
eu
while
the
two
sides
are
negotiating
on
trade
even
as
the
trump
administration
considers
options
to
shield
the
auto
industry
from
imports
malmstrom
told
an
audience
at
the
german
marshall
fund
in
washington
that
any
move
by
the
united
states
to
impose
auto
tariffs
would
not
apply
to
the
eu
due
to
an
agreement
in
july
between
president
donald
trump
and
european
commission
president
juncker
we
assume
that
if
that
auto
tariffs
were
to
happen
that
would
not
be
for
the
european
union
she
said
senior
trump
administration
officials
on
tuesday
discussed
the
commerce
department
s
draft
recommendations
on
its
section
national
security
probe
into
the
autos
sector
which
have
been
submitted
to

the

have
not
been
disclosed
the
advancement
of
commerce
s
autos
report
which
trump
has
said
could
lead
to
tariffs
on
imported
cars
and
parts
of
up
to
percent
was
seen
as
a
way
to
ramp
up
pressure
for
better
trade
terms
with
the
eu
and
japan
one
administration
official
told
reuters
on
monday
malmstrom
who
is
meeting
with
trade
representative
robert
lighthizer
on
wednesday
to
pursue
more
regulatory
cooperation
and
discuss
what
future
trade
negotiations
might
cover
said
she
would
be
willing
to
include
autos
but
made
clear
that
any
trade
deal
would
be
limited
in
scope
covering
industrial
goods
it
would
be
limited
and
let
me
state
and
be
very
clear
it
will
not
include
agriculture
she
said
any
deal
on
regulatory
cooperation
to
facilitate
more
trade
or
on
eu
purchases
of
soybeans
and
liquefied
natural
gas
would
be
done
outside
of
the
trade
negotiations
as
a
voluntary
arrangement
malmstrom
said
these
areas
were
outlined
during
the
meeting
in
july
malmstrom
said
she
would
need
a
mandate
from
eu
governments
to
launch
formal
negotiations
with
the
united
states
and
many
eu
members
notably
france
are
opposed
to
including
agriculture
in
the
talks
lighthizer
is
now
consulting
with
congress
on
eu
negotiations
which
can
not
begin
until
a
fast
track
notification
period
expires
in
january
