dozens
of
montenegrin
environmental
activists
and
fishermen
took
to
the
water
in
the
adriatic
port
of
bar
on
monday
to
protest
at
undersea
oil
prospecting
which
they
say
will
endanger
marine
wildlife
and
fisheries
the
demonstrators
had
already
spent
the
previous
four
days
walking
km
miles
along
montenegro
s
coast
from
herceg
novi
what
they
are
doing
is
illegal
this
is
a
crime
against
the
adriatic
sea
against
nature
said
mirsad
kurgas
from
the
sos
for
montenegro
watchdog
in
montenegro
awarded
a
offshore
exploration
concession
for
oil
and
gas
to
a
consortium
of
italy
s
eni
and
russia
s
novatek
the
survey
which
begins
next
week
is
set
to
cover
an
area
of
sq
km
sq
miles
and
last
days
it
involves
a
ship
towing
powerful
air
guns
that
cause
a
seismic
reaction
under
the
seabed
which
can
reveal
the
presence
of
oil
and
gas
pockets
the
activists
say
the
noise
from
the
guns
can
injure
or
seriously
disturb
marine
animals
that
rely
on
sound
to
find
food
communicate
and
travel
potentially
preventing
spawning
or
driving
them
away
altogether
the
ministry
of
agriculture
which
approved
the
exploration
banned
all
vessels
from
approaching
the
main
prospecting
ship
whose
arrival
on
wednesday
was
postponed
because
of
the
protest
eni
said
it
would
use
the
advanced
technology
to
minimize
impact
on
the
environment
and
try
to
keep
disruption
of
fishing
to
a
minimum
in
a
separate
statement
novatek
said
montenegro
s
environmental
protection
office
would
be
monitoring
the
operation
and
could
order
an
immediate
suspension
if
marine
mammals
or
turtles
were
found
the
head
of
the
national
association
of
fishermen
dragoljub
bajkovic
said
eni
had
offered
a
total
of
euros
to
fishermen
but
that
this
was
not
enough
to
cover
disruption
to
montenegro
s
main
fishing
grounds
we
will
be
suffering
consequences
for
at
least
years
spawning
will
be
disrupted
fish
will
be
annihilated
he
said
montenegro
a
candidate
for
european
union
membership
produces
no
oil
but
initial
data
has
indicated
it
might
have
enough
untapped
reserves
to
cover
its
oil
and
gas
needs
they
will
probably
find
what
they
want
said
milos
dasic
a
sport
fisherman
and
we
shall
lose
what
we
have
and
love
our
sea
fish
