said
in
an

on
tuesday
that
the
incoming

wanted
to

fiscal
regime
to
grant
pemex
greater
autonomy
in
how
it
operates
ramirez
said
adding
that
the
government
needed
to
curb
its
reliance
on
income
from
pemex
pemex
executives
have
long
complained
that
the
company
s
heavy
tax
burden
has
prevented
it
from
making
enough
investments
to
staunch
a
long
decline
in
crude
output
ramirez
declined
to
provide
more
details
and
said
lawmakers
were
still
looking
at
whether
they
would
include
tax
changes
for
pemex
in
the
budget
morena
and
its
allies
have
a
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
maybe
we
don
t
go
as
far
as
we
want
in
the
first
year
in
but
we
will
follow
this
trajectory

were
waiting
to
see
the
budget
proposal
of
lopez
obrador

eyeing
a
fiscal
surplus
target
between

discipline
is
guaranteed
