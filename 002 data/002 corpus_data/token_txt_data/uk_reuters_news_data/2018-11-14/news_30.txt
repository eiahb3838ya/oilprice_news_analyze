paris
reuters
france
set
out
plans
on
wednesday
to
tackle
deforestation
around
the
world
saying
it
would
look
to
curb
imports
of
products
such
as
palm
oil
soy
and
beef
which
it
said
contributed
to
the
problem
of
forest
areas
disappearing
palm
oil
a
type
of
vegetable
oil
used
in
confectionery
and
other
goods
is
controversial
because
of
the
environmental
impact
of
clearing
forests
to
make
way
for
plantations
the
majority
of
the
world
s
palm
oil
comes
from
malaysia
and
indonesia
where
deforestation
has
threatened
orangutan
populations
in
a
joint
statement
five
french
ministries
said
that
in
between
and
the
world
s
forest
area
fell
by
million
hectares
million
acres
eight
times
the
size
of
france
s
mainland
forest
this
lead
to
an
percent
increase
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
significant
consequences
in
terms
of
preserving
biodiversity
and
natural
habitats
they
said
european
countries
bear
an
important
responsibility
since
a
third
of
this
deforestation
is
due
to
the
consumption
of
agricultural
products
by
the
countries
of
the
european
companies
and
governments
including
the
european
union
made
multiple
pledges
to
halt
deforestation
in
recent
years
but
progress
in
dealing
with
the
issue
has
been
slow
france
proposed
measures
aimed
at
putting
a
halt
by
to
deforestation
caused
by
imports
of
forest
or
agricultural
products
these
include
financial
aid
to
encourage
developing
countries
to
respect
criteria
the
launch
of
a
zero
deforestation
label
for
consumers
by
and
a
push
next
year
for
a
european
policy
on
imports
posing
a
risk
for
forests
as
part
of
a
renewable
energy
bill
adopted
on
tuesday
the
eu
said
it
would
phase
out
biofuels
containing
feedstock
that
contribute
to
deforestation
by
france
echoed
this
measure
on
wednesday
in
may
france
had
allowed
a
limited
use
of
palm
oil
at
total
s
planned
la
mede
biofuel
refinery
a
move
that
prompted
an
outcry
from
environment
activists
and
farmers
who
said
the
palm
oil
would
be
imported
former
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
said
soon
after
his
appointment
last
year
he
would
limit
the
use
of
palm
oil
in
biofuels
in
france
to
reduce
deforestation
in
the
countries
of
origin
raising
outcry
from
indonesia
and
