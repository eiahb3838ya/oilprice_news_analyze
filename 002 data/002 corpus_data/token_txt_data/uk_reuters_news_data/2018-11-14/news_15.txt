national
guard
troops
were
due
to
arrive
on
wednesday
to
help
search
for
more
victims
in
the
charred
ruins
where
the
northern
california
town
of
paradise
stood
before
it
was
erased
in
the
deadliest
most
destructive
wildfire
in
state
history
the
guard
contingent
about
military
police
trained
to
look
for
and
identify
human
remains
will
reinforce
the
recovery
teams
cadaver
dogs
and
forensic
anthropologists
already
scouring
the
ghostly
landscape
of
a
fire
that
has
killed
at
least
people
the
grim
painstaking
search
is
concentrated
in
what
little
is
left
of
paradise
a
sierra
foothills
town
in
butte
county
california
about
miles
km
north
of
san
francisco
that
was
overrun
by
flames
and
largely
incinerated
last
thursday
the
killer
blaze
fueled
by
thick
scrub
and
fanned
by
fierce
winds
capped
a
catastrophic
california
wildfire
season
that
experts
largely
attribute
to
prolonged
dry
spells
they
say
are
symptomatic
of
global
climate
change
the
butte
county
disaster
coincided
with
a
flurry
of
blazes
in
southern
california
most
notably
the
woolsey
fire
which
has
killed
two
people
destroyed
over
structures
and
displaced
about
people
in
the
mountains
and
foothills
near
the
malibu
coast
west
of
los
angeles
the
origins
of
both
the
camp
and
woolsey
fires
were
listed
as
under
investigation
but
two
utility
companies
southern
california
edison
and
pacific
gas
electric
reported
to
regulators
they
experienced
problems
with
transmission
lines
or
substations
in
areas
around
the
time
the
blazes
were
reported
to
have
started
by
late
tuesday
with
the
help
of
diminished
winds
and
rising
humidity
levels
fire
crews
had
managed
to
carve
containment
lines
around
more
than
a
third
of
both
fires
easing
further
the
immediate
threat
to
life
and
property
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
and
california
governor
jerry
brown
were
scheduled
on
wednesday
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
areas
which
president
donald
trump
declared
a
disaster
areas
making
federal
emergency
assistance
more
readily
available
after
touring
some
of
california
s
earlier
wildfire
zones
in
august
zinke
blamed
gross
mismanagement
of
forests
because
of
timber
harvest
restrictions
that
he
said
were
supported
by
environmental
terrorist
groups
while
prospects
for
suppressing
the
flames
grew
more
hopeful
authorities
pressed
on
with
the
task
of
accounting
for
those
listed
as
missing
county
sheriff
kory
honea
said
he
requested
the
guard
troops
along
with
disaster
mortuary
crew
portable
military
morgue
teams
and
specialists
from
a
private
dna
laboratory
to
speed
the
detection
and
identification
of
additional
remains
we
want
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
we
can
honea
said
at
a
tuesday
evening
news
conference
where
he
announced
that
the
six
latest
sets
of
remains
had
been
recovered
in
paradise
earlier
in
the
day
the
fatality
count
of

far
exceeds
the
previous
record
for
the
greatest
loss
of

a
single
wildfire
in
california
history
people

that
in
some
cases
victims
were
burned
beyond
recognition
or
even
beyond
the
use
of
fingerprint
ids
dental
records
will
be
needed
to
positively
identify
some
but
dental
records
might
not
be
available
if
the
dentist
office
burned
to
the
ground
he
said
we
re
finding
remains
in
various
states
he
told
reporters
people
have
been
badly
burned
some
of
them
i
assume
have
been
he
said
it
was
possible
that
some
remains
might
turn
up
only
once
residents
with
homes
still
intact
are
able
to
return
more
than
remained
under
evacuation
orders
honea

previously
said
people
were
listed
as

he
said
on

numbers
were
highly
fluid
and
that
his

planned
to
publish
a
new
list
of
missing
persons
soon
and
would
ask
the
public
to
help
account
for
them
he
said
it
remained
unclear
how
many
individuals
whose
whereabouts
were
unknown
had
perished
or
fallen
out
of
touch
in
chaotic
evacuations
flames
roared
through
paradise
so
swiftly
that
residents
were
forced
to
flee
for
their
lives
with
little
or
no
warning
bodies
of
some
victims
were
found
in
and
around
the
wreckage
of

through
the
barren
lots
in
a
town
once

in
paradise

with
obliterated
