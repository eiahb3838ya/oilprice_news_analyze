the

coinciding
with
a

in
china
and
emerging

putting
pressure
on

assets
have
come
under
strong

pressure
over
the

as
worries
about
a
peak
in

growth
added
to
international
trade
tensions
and
signs
of
slowing

the

in

data

the
world
s
economy
contracted
in
the
third
quarter
adding
to
growing
signs
of
weakness
globally
with
china
and
europe
losing
momentum
germany
is
expected
to
report
later
in
the
day
that
its
economy
also
shrank
last

the

makoto

chief

strategist
at

nikko
securities
in
tokyo
but
currently
there
is
more
focus
on
the
possibility
of
both
the

chinese
leaders
maintaining
their
tough
stance
with
a
compromise

the

prime

then

of
brushed
on
monday
the
euro
s

however
were
tempered
by
concerns
over
italy
s
budget
proposals
the
european
commission
rejected
italy
s
plan
last
month
and
has
threatened
to
impose
penalties
if
it
is
not
revised
to
conform
with
eu
regulations
something
rome
has
indicated
it
is

rates
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
warned
on
tuesday
that
a
supply
glut
could
emerge
in
as
the
world
economy
slows
and
rivals
increase
production
more
quickly
than
expected
opec
member
states
rely
on
high
oil
prices
to
finance
government
budgets
and
they
have
been
watching
the
increase
in
supply
and
the
corresponding
price
slump
with
concern
led
by
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
opec
has
been
making
increasingly
frequent
public
statements
that
it
would
start
withholding
crude
in
to
tighten
supply
and
prop
up
prices
opec
and
russia
are
under
pressure
to
reduce
current
production
levels
which
is
a
decision
that
we
expect
to
be
taken
at
the
next
opec
meeting
on
said
jon
andersson
head
of
commodities
at
vontobel
asset
management
such
a
stance
however
has
caused
friction
with
president
donald
trump
who
supports
low
oil
prices
and
has
called
on
opec
not
to
cut
production
