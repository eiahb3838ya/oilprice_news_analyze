accept
the

agreement
that
opponents
said

imperil
her

and
threaten
the

of

after
days
of
bickering
point
scoring
intransigence
on
both

seemingly
irreconcilable

we
finally
have
a

said

now
this
easy
part
is
out
of
the
way
along
comes
the
hard
part
of
selling
it
to
a
divided
parliament
full
of
vested
interests
and
factions
he
added
in
a
note
the
british
cabinet
will
meet
at

the
deal
must
go
through
parliament
for
approval

crystallise
said
neil
wilson
analysts
at
the

will
likely
pass
it
but
with
assault
from
all

of
the
house
and

it

impossible
parliament

it

at

in

it

straight
sessions
of

we
went
through
our

yesterday
and
found
a
bit
more

we
still
can
t
find

brent
crude
oil
futures
also
bounced
percent
at

in
the

they
hit
an

following
a

slide
from
the
high
reached
early
in
october
the
dow
and

p
ended
slightly
lower
on

as

stocks
and
renewed

the

countries
opec
warned
on
tuesday
that
a
supply
glut
could
emerge
in
as
the
world
economy
slows
and
rivals
increase
production
more
quickly
than
expected
the
oil
plunge
underlined
cracks
in
the
global
economy
the
german
economy
shrank
percent
in
the
third

as
global
trade
disputes
and
problems
in
the
auto
industry
threw
the
traditional
export
growth
engine

the

italy
its
draft
budget
for

to
the
european
commission
with
the
same
growth
and
deficit
assumptions
that
had
been
rejected
by
brussels
while
boosting
its
privatisation
plan
and
committing
to
mitigate
spending
overshoots
the
italian
government
did
not
change
its
deficit
targets
this
will
likely
lead
the
european

to
recommend
an
infringement
procedure
said
morgan
stanley
analysts
concerns
over
the
italian
budget
also
spread
