singapore
airlines
ltd
is
facing
no
problem
selling
business
class
tickets
on
its
flights
to
the
united
states
but
is
having
to
price
premium
economy
seats
very
attractively
a
senior
executive
said
on
wednesday
the
carrier
last
month
resumed
after
five
years
the
world
s
longest
commercial
flight
a
hour
journey
from
singapore
to
new
york
the
airline
ordered
seven
new
range
airbus
se
fitted
with
just
business
class
and
premium
economy
seats
for
those
flights
and
for
services
to
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
these
flights
have
no
economy
class
seats
it
represents
a
major
expansion
in
the
market
for
singapore
airlines
and
a
test
of
whether
the
carrier
can
charge
the
percent
price
premium
that
travel
industry
data
shows
is
typical
for
services
due
to
their
popularity
with
business
travellers
singapore
airlines
executive
vice
president
commercial
mak
swee
wah
said
there
was
existing
demand
for
business
class
which
he
expected
would
continue
to
pick
up
for
premium
economy
however
he
said
some
markets
were
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
product
which
offers
more
leg
room
and
other
amenities
than
economy
class
i
think
we
need
to
continue
to
stimulate
and
encourage
the
market
to
consider
this
product
initially
with
very
attractive
pricing
but
eventually
i
think
people
will
see
that
even
at
prices
which
we
offer
it
is
a
good
product
to
purchase
because
it
is
a
very
long
flight
he
said
at
an
analyst
and
media
briefing
his
comments
came
after
singapore
airlines
reported
on
tuesday
an
percent
plunge
in
net
profit
hurt
by
higher
fuel
prices
lower
airfares
and
losses
at
its
virgin
australia
holdings
ltd
yields
a
proxy
for
ticket
prices
fell
percent
in
the
second
quarter
compared
with
a
year
earlier
failing
to
help
offset
the
impact
of
a
percent
rise
in
fuel
prices
singapore
airlines
is
offering
premium
economy
fares
as
low
as
s
return
from
singapore
to
new
york
for
weekday
travel
over
part
of
the
peak
christmas
travel
period
according
to
its
website
that
is
in
line
with
economy
class
fares
from
premium
rivals
like
hong
kong
s
cathay
pacific
airways
ltd
and
emirates
that
require
a
stop
and
a
longer
travel
time
according
to
a
reuters
search
on
expedia
mak
declined
to
comment
on
whether
singapore
airlines
could
consider
changing
the
configuration
of
the
plane
to
include
more
business
class
seats
when
it
previously
flew
to
new
york
and
los
angeles
on
jets
that
used
more
fuel
it
had
initially
offered
both
executive
economy
and
business
class
but
later
switched
to
an
class
configuration
those
flights
were
abandoned
in
when
high
fuel
prices
made
them
uneconomic
