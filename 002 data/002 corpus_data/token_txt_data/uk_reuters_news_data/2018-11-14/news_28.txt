oil
prices
bounced
from
lows
on
wednesday
but
stocks
fell
as
disappointing
data
heightened
worries
over
slowing
global
growth
while
the

wavered
as

the
hard

deal
european
shares
hit
a
low
after
data
showed
the
german
economy
contracted
for
the
first
time
since
tracking
similar
losses
in
asia
where
data
in
japan
and
china
underscored
worries
about
weaker
growth
they
later
pared
some
losses
after
reuters
reported
that
opec
and
its
partners
were
discussing
a
proposal
to
cut
output
helping
oil
prices
reverse
opening
losses
and
putting
an
end
to
their
longest
losing
streak
in
decades
the
msci
s
world
equity
index
remained
on
track
for
its
fifth
day
of
losses
in
a
row
but
reduced
its
decline
to
percent
by
gmt
the
stoxx
benchmark
index
was
down
percent
while
stock
index
futures
pointed
to
a
flat
open
sterling
fell
from
the
high
versus
the
euro
and
eased
below
in
volatile
trading
after
being
boosted
from
news
that
britain
and
the
european
union
agreed
on
the
text
of
a
brexit
divorce
deal
after
days
of
bickering
point
scoring
intransigence
on
both
sides
and
seemingly
irreconcilable
differences
we
finally
have
a
deal
said
deutsche
bank
strategist
jim
reid
now
this
easy
part
is
out
of
the
way
along
comes
the
hard
part
of
selling
it
to
a
divided
parliament
full
of
vested
interests
and
factions
he
added
in
a
note
before
seeking
uk
parliamentary
approval
before
exiting
the
bloc
on
march
may
will
try
to
persuade
senior
ministers
to
accept
the
deal
that
opponents
said
would
imperil
her
own
government
and
threaten
national
unity
the
british
cabinet
is
due
to
meet
at
gmt
although
sterling
softened
from
peaks
hit
in
the
previous
session
investors
were
anticipating
wild
swings
ahead
for
the
british
currency
implied
overnight
volatility
jumped
to
percent
its
highest
since
a
general
election
in
june
we
are
cognisant
that
the
recent
provisional
deal
is
only
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
if
it
does
not
pass
the
meaningful
vote
the
opposite
scenario
is
likely
to
play
out
said
richard
larner
head
of
research
at
brooks
macdonald
in
this
event
investors
will
begin
to
price
a
situation
into
investment
markets
he
added
meanwhile
oil
attempted
to
rebound
after
plunging
around
percent
the
previous
session
with
surging
supply
and
the
spectre
of
faltering
demand
scaring
off
investors
the
growing
prospect
of
opec
and
allied
producers
cutting
output
at
a
meeting
next
month
however
propped
up
the
market
helping
west

intermediate
wti
crude
futures
trade
percent
at
a
barrel
and
reverse
opening
losses
according
to
three
sources
familiar
with
the
issue
opec
and
its
partners
are
discussing
a
proposal
to
cut
oil
output
by
up
to
million
barrels
per
day
for
to
avert
an
oversupply
that
would
weaken
prices
in
the
previous
session
crude
futures
suffered
straight
sessions
of
losses
we
went
through
our
archives
yesterday
and
found
a
bit
more
daily
data
back
to
and
we
still
can
t
find
a
losing
run
of
this
magnitude
said
deutsche
bank
s
reid
brent
crude
oil
futures
also
bounced
up
percent
at
per
barrel
in
the
previous
session
they
hit
an
eight
month
low
following
a
percent
slide
from
the
high
reached
early
in
october
energy
stocks
in
europe
also
recovered
ground
but
remained
in
negative
territory
down
percent
the
oil
plunge
underlined
cracks
in
the
global
economy
the
german
economy
shrank
percent
in
the
third
quarter
as
global
trade
disputes
and
problems
in
the
auto
industry
threw
the
traditional
export
growth
engine
into
reverse
earlier
in
the
day
data
from
japan
confirmed
the
world
s
economy
contracted
in
the
third
quarter
still
in
currency
markets
the
euro
struggled
below
as
italy
its
draft
budget
for
next
year
to
the
european
commission
with
the
same
growth
and
deficit
assumptions
that
had
been
rejected
by
brussels
while
boosting
its
privatisation
plan
and
committing
to
mitigate
spending
overshoots
the
italian
government
did
not
change
its
deficit
targets
this
will
likely
lead
the
european
commission
to
recommend
an
infringement
procedure
said
morgan
stanley
analysts
concerns
over
the
italian
budget
also
spread
to
debt
markets
with
yields
on
italian
government
bonds
hitting
highs
widening
the
gap
over
german
peers
while
