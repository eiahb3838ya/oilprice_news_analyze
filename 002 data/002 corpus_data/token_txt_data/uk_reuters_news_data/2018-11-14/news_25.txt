natural
gas
prices
have
leapt
to
the
highest
level
for
more
than
four
years
as
the
market
tries
to
conserve
scarce
gas
stocks
in
the
face
of
unusually
cold
weather
settling
across
much
of
the
country
futures
prices
for
gas
delivered
at
henry
hub
in
january
have
surged
to
more
than
per
million
british
thermal
units
up
from
just
at
the
start
of
the
month
and
the
highest
since
july
gas
stocks
are
at
the
lowest
seasonal
level
for
years
and
around
percent
lower
than
at
the
same
point
last
year
and
the
average
according
to
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
while
most
forecasters
have
been
predicting
a
relatively
mild
winter
across
the
northern
united
states
because
of
the
el
niño
developing
over
the
pacific
temperatures
have
recently
fallen
far
below
the
seasonal
average
until
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
november
temperatures
had
been
slightly
milder
than
the
average
and
in
line
with
the
start
of
winter
in
and
since
then
however
temperatures
have
plunged
well
below
normal
across
most
of
the
lower
states
pushing
cumulative
heating
demand
up
sharply
colder
than
average
weather
is
expected
to
persist
across
most
northern
and
eastern
population
centres
for
the
next
week
according
to
the
government
s
climate
prediction
center
if
the
forecast
is
correct
this
will
be
the
first
colder
than
average
start
for
over
three
years
and
increase
the
pressure
on
gas
supplies
the
confluence
of
unusually
cold
weather
with
very
low
gas
stocks
has
sent
gas
prices
surging
as
the
market
tries
to
limit
consumption
as
much
as
possible
rising
prices
should
encourage
power
producers
to
limit
the
number
of
hours
they
run
in
the
next
few
weeks
to
conserve
stocks
while
price
differentials
should
result
in
maximum
switching
to
coal
generation
if
benchmark
gas
prices
rise
high
enough
they
could
also
discourage
lng
exports
but
low
inventories
have
left
the
market
very
vulnerable
with
price
spikes
likely
to
recur
later
in
the
winter
to
cope
with
any
extended
periods
of
cold
weather
as
a
result
hedge
fund
managers
have
a
clear
bullish
bias
on
prices
this
winter
with
long
positions
still
outnumbering
short
ones
by
a
ratio
of
more
than
