british
government
plans
to
transfer
shale
oil
and
gas
exploration
planning
decisions
from
local
authorities
to
the
national
level
will
be
a
backward
step
and
harm
local
democracy
a
committee
of
uk
lawmakers
warned
on
thursday
in
may
the
uk
government
announced
plans
to
speed
up
planning
applications
to
support
development
of
the
country
s
shale
gas
industry
which
it
believes
will
reduce
britain
s
dependence
on
imported
gas
in
the
future
among
the
measures
is
a
proposal
for
fracking
sites
to
be
classified
as
nationally
significant
infrastructure
which
would
mean
approval
for
planning
applications
would
be
done
at
a
national
rather
than
local
level
changing
the
process
in
this
way
would
likely
exacerbate
existing
mistrust
between
communities
and
the
fracking
industry
the
housing
communities
and
local
government
committee
said
in
a
report
taking
powers
away
from
local
planning
authorities
would
be
a
backward
step
it
would
remove
the
important
link
between
fracking
applications
and
local
plans
and
be
hugely
harmful
to
local
democracy
and
the
principles
and
spirit
of
localism
said
clive
betts
chair
of
the
committee
instead
local
mineral
planning
authorities
have
the
best
knowledge
of
their
areas
to
determine
the
impacts
of
fracking
the
report
said
hydraulic
fracturing
involves
extracting
gas
obtained
from
rocks
broken
up
or
fractured
with
water
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
it
has
become
a
contentious
issue
in
europe
after
it
helped
reverse
a
fall
in
oil
output
transformed
its
gas
sector
and
boosted
the
economy
of
several
states
despite
that
critics
argue
that
fracking
can
be
associated
with
environmental
issues
such
as
increased
industrial
activity
and
water
contamination
and
boost
fossil
fuel
production
when
more
renewable
energy
should
be
encouraged
commercial
production
of
shale
gas
in
britain
has
not
yet
started
as
developers
complain
that
progress
has
been
slowed
by
protests
and
regulatory
processes
british
shale
gas
developer
caudrilla
expects
to
fracture
its
first
two
horizontal
wells
in
blackpool
later
this
year
subject
to
approvals
the
scottish
government
has
in
effect
banned
fracking
by
ordering
local
authorities
to
reject
planning
applications
from
companies
seeking
to
do
shale
gas
exploration
after
a
public
consultation
found
overwhelming
opposition
to
it
