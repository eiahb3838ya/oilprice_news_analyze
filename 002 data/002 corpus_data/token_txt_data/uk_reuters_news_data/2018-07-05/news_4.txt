a
further

with
these
stories
coming
out

have
a

we
heading
for
a
trade
war
in
which
case
it
is
very
bad
news
for
risk
assets
or
do
we
walk
away
from
it
in
which
case
as
we
have
seen
today

rates
for
the

signal
that
the

was
advanced
enough
that

no
longer

the
market
s
expectation
always
was
that
when
we
get
back
to
neutral
the
fed
would
stop

s
the
type
of
statement

of
a
