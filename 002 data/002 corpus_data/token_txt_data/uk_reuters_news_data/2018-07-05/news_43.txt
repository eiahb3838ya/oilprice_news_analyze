norway
s
electricity
prices
usually
among
the
cheapest
in
europe
have
doubled
for
the
third
quarter
as
a
lack
of
rainfall
makes
hydropower
dam
output
as
costly
as
german
power
the
country
s
regulator
said
norway
s
electricity
price
for
the
third
quarter
was
trading
at
crowns
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
twice
s
level
according
to
norway
s
water
resources
and
energy
directorate
nve
that
continued
a
trend
of
high
norwegian
power
prices
this
year
with
the
spot
energy
price
during
spring
and
early
summer
also
double
levels
norway
counts
on
competitive
electricity
prices
to
attract
international
investors
who
seek
regions
to
build
their
factories
and
data
centres
the
country
was
also
planning
three
interconnectors
to
export
its
cheap
power
but
the
price
is
now
not
as
cheap
as
it
used
to
be
the
lack
of
rainfall
is
the
main
reason
why
the
price
is
about
twice
as
high
as
at
the
same
time
last
year
the
nve
said
in
a
report
it
also
corresponds
to
the
cost
of
producing
power
from
coal
it
added
to
add
to
the
lack
of
rainfall
norway
s
wind
power
production
fell
sharply
it
added
while
consumption
in
the
nordic
countries
increased
simultaneously
norway
which
usually
exports
surpluses
during
the
warmer
summer
time
is
seeing
imports
exceed
exports
this
summer
the
country
s
grid
said
on
wednesday
norway
s
reservoirs
have
received
rainfall
in
that
is
equivalent
to
terrawatt
hours
twh
less
than
a
normal
year
a
shortfall
equivalent
to
the
energy
needs
of
million
households
or
half
of
norway
s
population
it
said
in
a
separate
report
produced
by
the

ssb
on
thursday
may
s
power
imports
grew
by
percent
from
the

month
last
year
while
exports
fell
by
percent
total
energy
production
in
norway
also
declined
by

norway
s

is
coming
from
