said
masahiro

senior

at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
the
united
states
plans
to
implement
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
from
china
as
both

remained
locked

a
bitter
trade
dispute
that
has
convulsed
global
financial
markets
in
recent
weeks
on
july
tariffs
on
billion

will
take

retaliate
in

did
say
on

that
it
will
absolutely
not
fire
the
first
shot
in
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
and

not
be
the

china
has
put
pressure
on
the
european
union
to

a
strong
joint

donald
trump
s
trade
policies
european
officials
told
reuters
the
billion
tariffs
figure
has
been
mostly
factored
by
the
markets
and
focus
is
now
on
what
the
united
states
says
on
the
remaining
billion
ichikawa
said
in
currencies
the
euro
was
little
changed
at
the
single

fell
to
as
low
as
overnight
after
weaker
confidence
in
the
euro
zone
overshadowed
data
on
business
activity
the
chinese
yuan
managed
a
strong
bounce
on
wednesday
as
it
extended
a
recovery
from
an
low
after
the
central
bank
sought
calm
nervous
markets
and
stem
the
currency
s
recent
tumble
the
offshore
yuan
was
marginally
higher
after
gaining
percent
against
the
dollar
the
previous
day
the
dollar
was
flat
at
yen
trapped
in
a
narrow
range
the
previous
day
due
to
the
holiday
the
dollar
index
against
a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
was
percent
lower
at
brent
crude
futures
were
down
percent
at
a
barrel
losing
some
steam
after
two
successive
days
of
gains
brent
had
risen
on
wednesday
on
a
threat
from
an
iranian
commander
and
a
drop
in
crude
inventories
