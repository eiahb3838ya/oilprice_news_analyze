china
s
omission
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
from
its
vast
list
of
products
that
face
hefty
import
duties
from
friday
has
preserved
a
potential
weapon
should
the
trade
war
with
washington
deepen
it
also
underscores
beijing
s
desire
to
ensure
supplies
of
gas
as
it
pushes
to
switch
millions
of
households
and
businesses
away
from
using
coal
as
a
key
part
of
its
war
on
pollution
china
will
on
friday
impose
tariffs
on
billion
of
goods
from
pork
to
soybeans
to
cotton
in
retaliation
for
a
similar
move
by
washington
as
trade
relations
sour
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
if
the
trade
war
escalates

expect
the

will
not

add

company
executive
said
declining
to
be
identified
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
issue
although
lng
supplies
to
china
have
so
far
been
tiny
in
volume
and
value
compared
with
the
around
billion
per
year
of
crude
that
arrives
in
the
country
analysts
say
those
levels
could
be
set
to
shoot
up
as
beijing
forges
ahead
with
its
battle
to
clear
its
skies
morgan
stanley
has
estimated
annual
chinese
imports
of
lng
could
rise
to
as
much
as
billion
within
two
or
three
years
from
billion
in
the
amount
could
be
even
larger
if
the
united
states
resolves
a
logistics
bottleneck
that
would
go
a
long
way
to
helping
balance
china
s
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
a
major
bugbear
of
washington
s
in
the
trade
dispute
but
the
strategy
also
hands
beijing
another
weapon
in
its
arsenal
if
the
spat
deteriorates
further
china
s
commerce
ministry
did
not
immediately
respond
to
requests
for
comment
however
some
industry
sources
said
the
country
would
feel
the
impact
of
any
increased
tariffs
on
lng
as
there
are
a
limited
number
of
major
alternative
suppliers
if
we
impose
tariffs
on
lng
we
pay
a
much
higher
opportunity
cost
mei
xinyu
a
researcher
at
a
think
tank
affiliated
with
the
commerce
ministry
told
reuters
it
is
easier
for
china
to
switch
into
other
suppliers
in
the
soybean
market
duties
on
soybeans
hurt
the
more
but
duties
on
energy
products
would
hurt
both
at
a
meeting
between
the
government
and
china
s
three
oil
and
gas
majors
ahead
of
president
s
visit
to
the
country
last
september
the
companies
underlined
that
china
would
have
limited
alternative
sources
for
lng
imports
an
official
from
one
of
the
firms
told
reuters
the
conclusion
at
that
time
was
that
oil
is
not
competitive
the
official
said
in
the
gas
market
we
don
t
have
much
choice
mainly
qatar
australia
and
the
and
china
is
eager
to
avoid
any
repeat
of
last
winter

crunch
when
plunging

drove
people
to
crank
up
their
heating

we
need
