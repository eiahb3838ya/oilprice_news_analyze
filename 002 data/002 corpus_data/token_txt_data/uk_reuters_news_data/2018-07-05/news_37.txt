update 1-shell ceo says "foolhardy" to set carbon reduction targets
london
reuters
royal
dutch
shell
s
boss
said
it
would
be
foolhardy
for
the
oil
and
gas
producer
to
set
hard
targets
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
as
it
risked
exposing
the
energy
giant
to
legal
challenges
the
energy
industry
has
struggled
in
recent
years
to
find
a
clear
path
to
secure
its
role
as
the
world
shifts
from
fossil
fuels
in
order
to
meet
the
paris
climate
agreement
goals
shell
chief
executive
officer
ben
van
beurden
last
year
set
out
ambitions
last
year
to
halve
its
carbon
emissions
by
far
exceeding
rivals
but
the
dutch
ceo
resisted
calls
by
activists
and
some
investors
to
set
binding
targets
it
would
be
somewhat
foolhardy
to
put
ourselves
in
a
legal
bind
by
saying
these
are
the
targets
we
will
adopt
van
beurden
said
at
a
company
event
before
we
put
ourselves
at
the
mercy
of
a
legal
challenge
i
want
to
make
sure
we
are
doing
the
right
thing
van
beurden
a
vocal
proponent
of
the
world
s
need
to
meet
the
paris
goals
urged
investors
to
trust
him
you
have
to
believe
us
that
setting
an
ambition
sticking
my
neck
out
my
personal
reputation
the
reputation
of
the
company
is
a
big
enough
incentive
to
get
it
right
he
told
reporters
oil
companies
have
faced
a
growing
number
of
legal
challenges
over
climate
change
in
recent
years
on
monday
the
state
of
rhode
island
sued
several
major
oil
companies
including
exxon
mobil
corp
shell
and
bp
accusing
them
of
contributing
to
climate
change
that
is
damaging
infrastructure
and
coastal
communities
bp
this
year
announced
plans
to
keep
carbon
emissions
from
its
operations
flat
until
but
bp
ceo
bob
dudley
echoed
van
beurden
s
concerns
at
the
company
s
annual
general
meeting
in
may
and
refused
to
disclose
details
of
the
plan
you
want
to
get
us
to
make
statements
here
in
front
of
you
that
you
can
document
that
will
lead
to
a
class
action
dudley
said
in
response
to
a
question
from
a
shareholder
shell
spends
the
most
among
the
world
s
top
oil
and
gas
companies
on
energies
investing
up
to
billion
per
year
in
renewables
and
clean
fuel
technology
out
of
a
total
spending
budget
of
billion
to
billion
per
year
it
is
more
sensible
to
say
we
will
go
faster
than
society
we
will
catch
up
with
society
on
its
way
to
meeting
paris
van
beurden
said
on
thursday
it
is
a
very
clear
ambition
we
will
articulate
this
ambitions
in
steps
as
we
go
along
the
way
we
will
be
