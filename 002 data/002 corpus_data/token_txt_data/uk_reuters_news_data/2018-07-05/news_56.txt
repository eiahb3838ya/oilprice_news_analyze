trump
late
on
wednesday
said
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
producer
cartel
was
driving
up
fuel
prices
the
opec
monopoly
must
remember
that
gas
prices
are
up
they
are
doing
little
to
help
if
anything
they
are
driving
prices
higher
as
the
united

defends
many
of
their
members
for
very
little
s
this
must
be
a
two

street
reduce
pricing
now
trump
wrote
on
twitter
opec
together
with
a
group
of
producers
led
by
russia
started
to
withhold
output
in
to
prop
up
prices
recent
price
rises
have
also
been
spurred
by
a
announcement
that
it
plans
to
sanctions
against
iran
from
november
which
will
also
target
its
oil
industry
a
key
driver
of
the
rise
in
prices
has
been
the
deal
to
cut
oil
output
compounded
by
collapsing
venezuelan
production
and
the
decision
to
end
the
iran
deal

nab

in
its

outlook
ship
brokerage
banchero
costa
said
iran
s
crude
oil
production
was
currently
around
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
but
added
there
is
the
risk
of
production
decreasing
going
forward
as
exports
are
again
affected
by
renewed
sanctions
implemented
by
the
opec
and
russia
announced
in
june
they
were
willing
to
raise
output
to
address
concerns
of
emerging
supply
shortages
due
to
unplanned
disruptions
from
venezuela
to
libya
and
likely
also
to
replace
a
potential
fall
in
iranian
supplies
due
to
sanctions
nab
said
its
oil
price
forecasts
point
to
brent
spending
the
next
few
months
largely
in
the
per
barrel
range
although
meaningful
output
increases
could
push
prices
lower
later
in
the
year
and
higher
shale
production
should
impose
an
upside
limit
on
meanwhile
crude
oil
production
has
soared
by
percent
in
the
last
two
years
to
million
bpd
that
means
just
three
countries
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
meet
a
third
of
global
oil
demand
