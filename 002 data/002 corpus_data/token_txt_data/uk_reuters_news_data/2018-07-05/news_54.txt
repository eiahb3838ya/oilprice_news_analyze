asian

were

barely

in

said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
the
united
states
plans
to
implement
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
from
china
as
both
nations
remained
locked
in
a
bitter
trade
dispute
that
has
convulsed
global
financial
markets
in
recent
weeks
on
july
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
imports
will
take
effect
and
beijing
has
promised
to
retaliate
in
kind
however
china
s
finance
ministry
did
say
on
wednesday
that
it
will
absolutely
not
fire
the
first
shot
in
a
trade
war
with
the
united
states
and
will
not
be
the
first
to
levy
tariffs
china
has
put
pressure
on
the
european
union
to
issue
a
strong
joint
statement
against
president
donald
trump
s
trade
policies
european
officials
told
reuters
the
billion
tariffs
figure
has
been
mostly
factored
by
the
markets
and
focus
is
now
on
what
the
united
states
says
on
the
remaining
billion
ichikawa
said
in
currencies
the
euro
was
little
changed
at
the
single
currency
fell
to
as
low
as
overnight
after
weaker
confidence
in
the
euro
zone
overshadowed
data
on
business
activity
the
chinese
yuan
was
slightly
lower
its
recovery
from
an
low
stalling
a
rebound
in
the
yuan
was
triggered
in
the
past
two
sessions
after
the
central
bank
sought
to
calm
nervous
markets
midweek
and
stem
the
currency
s
recent
tumble
the
yuan
was
percent
lower
after
gaining
percent
against
the
dollar
on
wednesday
the
longer
term
direction
for
the
yuan
was
still
unclear
china
appears
broadly
comfortable
with
a
weakening
yuan
and
would
intervene
only
to
prevent
any
destabilising
declines
or
to
restore
market
confidence
policy
insiders
told
reuters
the

nearly
flat

in
a
narrow

the
previous

to
the

awaiting
the
minutes
from

meeting
due
later
in
the
day
for
immediate
cues
the

a
basket
of
six
major
currencies
was
percent
lower
at
copper
and
zinc
were
stuck
near
lows
having
declined
steadily
over
the
past
month

fears
that
the
