china
s
ambitious
push
to
use
biofuel
in
cars
nationwide
by
is
in
doubt
amid
concerns
about
supplies
of
raw
material
such
as
corn
complicated
by
an
escalating
trade
dispute
with
washington
producers
and
analysts
say
in
september
last
year
the
government
outlined
radical
plans
to
roll
out
the
use
of
ethanol
in
gasoline
nationally
by
in
part
to
digest
its
huge
corn
stocks
producers
like
china
s
state
development
investment
corporation
sdic
agribusiness
cofco
and
jilin
fuel
rushed
to
draw
up
plans
to
invest
billions
of
yuan
to
double
output
in
the
world
s
largest
car
market
but
since
then
only
one
major
project

in
liaoning
province
in
china
s
northeast
has
received
the
to
start
construction
three
big
expansion
plans
by
major
producers
are
stalled
because
the
companies
haven
t
got
approval
from
the
government
three
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
situation
say
they
declined
to
be
named
as
they
are
not
authorised
to
speak
to
the
media
the
government
has
not
revised
its
timeline
or
commented
publicly
on
a
change
in
policy
but
executives
at
two
producers
three
policy
experts
and
market
analysts
say
the
drawn
out
approval
process
and
project
delays
suggest
beijing
is
quietly
rethinking
its
initial
plans
the
slowdown
comes
as
a
brewing
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
intensifies
raising
the
threat
of
further
tariffs
that
could
make
imports
of
corn
or
ethanol
to
meet
any
shortfall
in
domestic
supplies
uneconomic
the
plan
was
too
ambitious
and
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
whole
industry
chain
it
was
too
big
a
step
forward
there
might
be
change
to
the
policy

michael
mao
analyst
with
zhuochuang
a
consultancy
based
in
shandong
province
the
commerce
ministry
ministry
of
agriculture
and
rural
affairs
and
the
national
development
reform
commission
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
building
enough
capacity
to
meet
the
target
was
always
going
to
be
tough
for
the
country
s
nascent
ethanol
industry
in
fuel
ethanol
capacity
was
million
tonnes
according
to
zhuochuang
far
short
of
the
million
tonnes
needed
for
a
national
of
gasoline
known
as
containing
percent
ethanol
with
just
months
to
go
there
is
little
sign
of
the
building
boom
the
sector
anticipated
in
the
northeastern
region
of
heilongjiang
the
local
government
said
it
would
launch
a
bidding
process
to
apply
for
approval
to
build
new
ethanol
plants
but
interested
companies
are
still
waiting
to
hear
i
have
been
mainly
doing
some
paperwork
since
i
got
here
said
a
manager
in
charge
of
the
building
of
his
company
s
new
plants
in
the
cornbelt
province
i
meet
with
local
government
officials
frequently
but
there
s
no
news
about
what
s
an
executive
at
another
major
producer
said
his
company
also
wanted
to
expand
output
following
the
mandate
but
could
not
get
permits
from
the
government
cofco
has
not
started
building
new
ethanol
plants
it
had
planned
waiting
on
further
announcements
on
government
policy
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
the
slowdown
comes
amid
concerns
that
the
world
s
most
populous
country
may
struggle
to
secure
enough
corn
to
produce
biofuel
without
disrupting
food
supplies
and
prices
of
the
grain
some
million
tonnes
of
corn
almost
a
quarter
of
the
country
s
current
annual
demand
would
be
needed
to
make
enough
ethanol
for
a
national
domestic
corn
supplies
have
dwindled
in
recent
years
leaving
little
cushion
for
the
extra
demand
just
as
beijing
ratchets
up
pressure
on
washington
in
their
escalating
trade
dispute
beijing
will
hit
corn
imports
from
the
united
states
one
of
its
top
suppliers
with
hefty
extra
tariffs
from
friday
china
already
imposes
a
percent
tariff
on
all
ethanol
imports
keeping
arrivals
to
a
trickle
in
april
it
slapped
an
extra
percent
tariff
on
imports
from
the
united
states
the
world
s
top
producer
and
is
set
to
impose
another
percent
on
friday
and
after
years
of
selling
off
its
million
tonne
corn
stockpile
the
state
reserves
which
were
expected
to
help
feed
the
new
factories
will
run
out
of
corn
by
the
end
of
next
year
according
to
reuters
calculations
the
chinese
government
expects
the
supply
deficit
from
domestically
grown
corn
to
balloon
to
million
tonnes
from
million
in
as
the
crop
shrinks
percent
and
demand
grows
once
we
run
out
of
stocks
in
the
reserves
where
can
you
get
extra
corn
to
make
fuel
ethanol
