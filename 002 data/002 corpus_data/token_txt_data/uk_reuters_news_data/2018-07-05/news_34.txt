global markets-full-throttle car rally drives back trade gloom
london
reuters
european
shares
headed
for
a
third
day
of
gains
on
thursday
as
reassuring
economic
data
from
germany
and
a
report
that
its
big
carmakers
could
be
spared
from
tariffs
offset
another
gloomy
session
for
asia
trade
nerves
had
pegged
asia
s
bourses
back
with
a
deadline
to
impose
tariffs
on
chinese
imports
just
a
day
away
but
it
was
another
target
the
german
car
sector
that
spurred
europe
s
rally
and
pushed
up
wall
street
futures
daimler
bmw
porsche
and
volkswagen
raced
up
as
much
as
percent
after
reports
of
a
offer
to
suspend
tariff
threats
on
cars
if
the
bloc
lifts
its
duties
on
ones
it
fuelled
the
wider
european
auto
sector
s
best
day
in
more
than
two
years
with
the
mood
also
been
helped
by
a
jump
in
german
industrial
orders
after
four
months
of
falls
with
these
stories
coming
out
about
car
tariffs
you
have
a
sector
which
has
been
very
oversold
meeting
some
potential
good
news
on
the
trade
war
front
said
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
european
equity
strategist
james
barty
this
is
going
to
be
the
dominant
issue
of
the
summer
are
we
heading
for
a
trade
war
in
which
case
it
is
very
bad
news
for
risk
assets
or
do
we
walk
away
from
it
in
which
case
as
we
have
seen
today
markets
are
likely
to
rebound
quite
the
euro
briefly
topped
and
bond
yields
rose
after
the
brighter
german
data
and
after
a
report
that
the
ecb
thinks
markets
are
now
too
cautious
on
when
it
will
raise
euro
zone
interest
rates
next
year
sterling
gained
ground
too
as
the
head
of
the
bank
of
england
confirmed
it
was
still
planning
to
raise
uk
rates
this
year
later
in
the
day
traders
will
get
the
minutes
from
last
month
federal
reserve
meeting
when
it
raised
rates
for
a
second
time
this
year
the
euro
is
getting
a
bit
of
a
lift
on
the
german
data
though
the
trade
concerns
will
continue
to
dominate
markets
with
the
fed
minutes
being
the
key
data
point
said
kenneth
broux
a
currency
strategist
at
societe
generale
in
london
the
ongoing
angst
over
president
donald
trump
s
trade
tariffs
had
extended
the
recent
slide
in
asian
markets
overnight
in
particular
chinese
shares
which
are
now
deep
into
bear
market
territory
on
friday
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
will
take
effect
beijing
has
promised
to
retaliate
in
kind
though
it
said
overnight
that
it
would
absolutely
not
fire
the
first
shot
in
a
trade
war
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
which
has
dropped
every
day
except
three
since
mid
june
ended
down
percent
the
index
has
lost
about
percent
this
week
plumbing
a
low
in
the
process
japan
nikkei
shed
percent
south
korea
kospi
slipped
percent
hong
kong
hang
seng
was
off
percent
and
the
shanghai
composite
index
fell
percent
to
take
its
dive
since
late
january
to
percent
with
europe
advancing
though
wall
street
s
s
p
futures
and
dow
and
nasdaq
futures
were
all
up
percent
pointing
to
a
solid
start
following
wednesday
s
independence
day
holiday
the
billion
tariffs
figure
has
been
mostly
factored
by
the
markets
and
focus
is
now
on
what
the
united
states
says
on
the
remaining
billion
of
a
promised
billion
tariff
plan
said
masahiro
ichikawa
senior
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
asset
management
in
tokyo
in
currencies
the
euro
gain
was
the
dollar
loss
that
also
helped
ease
some
of
the
pressure
on
volatile
emerging
market
currencies
even
turkey
battered
lira
recovered
from
an
early
slip
triggered
by
its
prime
minister
saying
cutting
interest
rates
was
a
top
priority
the
chinese
yuan
was
slightly
lower
though
its
recovery
from
an
low
stalling
a
rebound
was
triggered
in
the
past
two
sessions
after
the
country
central
bank
sought
to
calm
nervous
markets
and
stem
the
recent
tumble
the
longer
term
direction
for
the
yuan
was
still
unclear
china
appears
broadly
comfortable
with
a
weakening
yuan
and
would
intervene
only
to
prevent
any
destabilising
declines
or
to
restore
market
confidence
policy
insiders
told
reuters
although
we
do
not
believe
china
will
weaponise
its
currency
we
do
believe
the
current
trajectory
of
chinese
yuan
depreciation
is
justified

wrote
in

the
dollar
was
percent
higher
against
the
yen
at

though
it
was
sticking
within
a
narrow
range
ahead
of
the
federal

minutes
that
could
give
fresh
clues
on

brent

were
on
the
rise
again
at
a
barrel
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
sent
a
tweet
demanding
that
opec
reduce
prices
for
crude
brent
had
risen
on
wednesday
on
a
threat
from
an
iranian
commander
to
disrupt
oil
shipments
from
neighbouring
states
if
washington
continued
to
press
all
countries
to
stop
buying
iranian
oil
and
a
drop
in
crude
inventories
if
trump
continues
to
believe
that
opec
are
not
doing
enough
we
would
not
rule
