ukraine
s
parliament
on
thursday
passed
a
law
requiring
banks
to
appoint
a
majority
of
independent
members
to
their
supervisory
boards
a
commitment
made
to
the
backers
of
its
billion
bailout
the
law
aims
to
bring
corporate
governance
at
the
banks
into
line
with
international
standards
and
help
the
lenders
resist
political
pressure
the
finance
ministry
said
in
a
statement
after
the
vote
the
international
monetary
fund
has
propped
up
ukraine
s
economy
with
an
aid
programme
since
though
the
fund
has
not
disbursed
any
money
since
last
year
as
the
pace
of
reforms
slowed
it
has
pressed
the
government
to
clean
up
a
financial
sector
where
loans
make
up
more
than
percent
of
portfolios
in
state
banks
as
a
result
of
risky
and
opaque
lending
practices
we
currently
do
not
have
effective
control
under
hundreds
of
billions
of
hryvnias
that
we
send
from
the
state
budget
in
order
to
support
banks
we
have
to
bring
order
here
and
the
law
will
help

committee
on

of
its
banks
since
as
part

of
the
financial
sector
and
in
nationalised
the
country
s
largest
lender
privatbank
the
government
says
percent
of
privatbank
s
portfolio
is
made
up
of
loans
though
privatbank
s
former
owners
dispute
this
assessment
and
are
contesting
the
decision
to
nationalise
it
after
privatbank
was
taken
into
state
hands
the
of
banks
doubled
to
percent
increasing
the
need
for
better
management
at
such
banks
the
central
bank
said
the
new
law
says
that
six
of
nine
members
of
a
supervisory
board

a
bank
are
to
be
chosen

years
of
international
experience
the
