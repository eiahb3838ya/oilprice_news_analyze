explainer-what the failed glencore-tohoku coal talks mean for the market
reuters
electric
utilities
in
japan
and
other
asian
countries
are
driving
blind
when
it
comes
to
coal
prices
after
the
failure
of
japan
s
tohoku
electric
and
glencore
to
agree
on
an
annual
thermal
coal
contract
that
is
used
to
set
prices
for
the
region
tohoku
electric
a
major
japanese
utility
and
glencore
the
world
s
biggest
exporter
of
seaborne
thermal
coal
abandoned
the
talks
last
month
on
their
annual
australian
supply
contract
both
parties
seem
to
have
tried
hard
to
come
to
a
consensus
but
always
had
large
difference
in
price
expectations
this
year

mackenzie
said
in
a
note
to
clients
coal
prices
spiked
as
japanese
and
asian
utilities
jumped
into
the
spot
market
to
cover
their
needs
after
the
talks
broke
down
companies
that
were
relying
on
the
talks
to
set
a
price
for
their
previously
delivered
cargoes
and
future
shipments
under
their
april
to
march
contracts
now
lack
a
reference
for
netting
out
prior
payments
based
on
temporary
prices
the
collapse
of
this
year
s
talks
has
raised
questions
about
the
industry
s
dependence
on
this
method
of
setting
prices
japan
s
utilities
which
buy
about
percent
of
australia
s
thermal
coal
exports
have
a
relationship
with
glencore
and
its
predecessors
that
goes
back
over
years
the
two
sides
typically
sit
down
early
in
the
year
to
negotiate
fixed
prices
for
annual
supplies
for
april
to
march
those
prices
are
published
by
media
and
used
by
utilities
in
thailand
taiwan
and
malaysia
for
their
own
contracts
however
during
the
talks
this
year
spot
coal
prices
rose
making
it
difficult
for
the
sides
to
settle
on
a
contract
because
tohoku
already
signed
some
deals
with
smaller
suppliers
when
spot
prices
were
lower
they
were
not
willing
to
pay
significantly
more
for
coal
from
their
biggest
supplier
glencore
said
one
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
who
declined
to
be
named
as
he
was
not
authorised
to
speak
publicly
about
commercial
deals
glencore
had
the
opposite
view
they
were
unwilling
to
agree
to
a
supply
deal
significantly
below
spot
market
prices
the
source
added
without
this
year
s
deal
utilities
need
to
find
another
reference
price
for
their
annual
supplies
or
they
can
buy
in
the
spot
market
finding
another
benchmark
is
difficult
because
the
coal
market
is
more
opaque
than
other
commodities
such
as
crude
oil
where
exchanges
readily
publish
futures
prices
rising
prices
have
made
going
into
the
spot
market
expensive
spot
thermal
coal
prices
at
australia
s
newcastle
terminal
have
climbed
by
percent
from
their
lows
to
over
per
tonne
the
highest
since
but
buying
from
newcastle
supports
glencore
which
exported
million
tonnes
of
coal
from
australia
in
a
quarter
of
the
country
s
overseas
sales
according
to
government
and
company
data
market
participants
are
divided
on
the
industry
s
next
steps
some
traders
expect
another
japanese
utility
to
become
an
alternative
negotiator
for
this
year
or
tohoku
will
renew
negotiations
for
another
term
contract
as
it
wants
to
reduce
its
exposure
to
the
volatile
spot
market
others
expect
the
failed
talks
to
mark
a
more
significant
change
power
market
liberalization
in
japan
now
demands
that
utilities
have
more
flexibility
in
coal
prices
in
their
ability
to
fuel
costs

national
australia
bank
said
in
its
july
commodity
outlook
published
this
week
that
spot
prices
for
thermal
coal
may
become
increasingly
important
given
the
breakdown
of
the
traditional
japanese
financial
year
contract
some
japanese
companies
are
improving
their
ability
to
operate
in
the
spot
market
jera
a
between
tokyo
electric
power
and
chubu
electric
power
and
one
of
the
world
s
biggest
fuel
importers
has
taken
over
the
coal
operations
of
europe
s
edf
trading
and
plans
to
buy
its
liquefied

operations
jera
president
yuji
kakimi
said
the
company
has
reduced
its
coal
requirements
using
contracts
to
only
a
few
percent
from
as
much
as
percent
a
decade
ago
another
option
is
to
use
spot
price
indexes
japan
s
steel
sector
moved
to
this
model
last

after

ended
their

mechanism
settled
through
talks
with
australian
miners
for
coking
coal
however
a
senior
official
at
glencore
said
that
is
