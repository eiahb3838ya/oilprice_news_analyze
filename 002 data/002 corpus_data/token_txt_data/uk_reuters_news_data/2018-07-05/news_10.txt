reuters
stock
markets
in
europe
and
the
advanced
on
thursday
as
reassuring
economic
data
from
germany
and
a
report
that
its
big
carmakers
could
be
spared
from
tariffs
offset
another
gloomy
session
for
asia
shares
of
daimler
bmw
porsche
and
volkswagen
surged
as
much
as
percent
after
reports
of
a
offer
to
suspend
tariff
threats
on
cars
if
the
bloc
lifts
duties
on
vehicles
that
fueled
wider
gains
with
the
european
auto
sector
enjoying
its
best
day
in
more
than
two
years
the
mood
was
also
helped
by
a
jump
in
german
industrial
orders
after
four
months
of
declines
with
these
stories
coming
out
you
have
a
sector
which
has
been
very
oversold
meeting
some
potential
good
news
on
the
trade
war
front
said
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
european
equity
strategist
james
barty
this
is
going
to
be
the
dominant
issue
of
the
summer
are
we
heading
for
a
trade
war
in
which
case
it
is
very
bad
news
for
risk
assets
or
do
we
walk
away
from
it
in
which
case
as
we
have
seen
today
markets
are
likely
to
rebound
quite
on
wall
street
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
rose
points
or
percent
to
the
s
p
gained
points
or
percent
to
and
the
nasdaq
composite
added
points
or
percent
to
benchmarks
gave
up
some
of
their
gains
in
trading
after
minutes
from
the
federal
reserve
s
last
meeting
on
june
showed
that
central
bankers
discussed
whether
trade
tensions
could
dent
the
economy
the
minutes
which
described
a
meeting
in
with
the
fed
raised
interest
rates
for
the
second
time
this
year
also
suggested
policymakers
might
soon
signal
that
the
fed
s
rate
hiking
cycle
was
advanced
enough
that
policy
was
no
longer
significantly
affecting
the
economy
obviously
that
was
a
hawkish
meeting
said
michael
o
rourke
chief
market
strategist
at
jonestrading
in
greenwich
connecticut
the
market
s
expectation
always
was
that
when
we
get
back
to
neutral
the
fed
would
stop
raising
rates
that
s
the
type
of
statement
that
will
spook
investors
knowing
the
fed
may
tighten
beyond
the
neutral
level

gained

the
euro
briefly
topped
and
bond
yields
rose
after
the
brighter
german
data
and
a
report
that
the
ecb
thinks
markets
are
now
too
cautious
on
when
it
will
raise
euro
zone
interest
rates
next
year
the
euro
is
getting
a
bit
of
a
lift
on
the
german
data
though
the
trade
concerns
will
continue
to
dominate
markets
with
the
fed
minutes
being
the
key
data
point

broux
a
currency
strategist
at
