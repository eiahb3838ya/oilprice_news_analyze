trump effort to lift u.s. offshore wind sector sparks interest - from europe
reuters
the
trump
administration
wants
to
fire
up
development
of
the
offshore
wind
industry
by
streamlining
permitting
and
carving
out
vast
areas
off
the
coast
for
leasing
part
of
its
america
first
policy
to
boost
domestic
energy
production
and
jobs
the
europeans
have
taken
note
the
drive
to
open
america
s
offshore
wind
industry
has
attracted
europe
s
biggest
renewable
energy
companies
who
see
the
east
coast
as
a
new
frontier
after
years
of
success
across
the
atlantic
less
experienced
wind
power
companies
meanwhile
have
struggled
to
compete
in
their
own
backyard
according
to
lease
data
and
interviews
with
industry
executives
many
are
steering
clear
of
the
opportunity
altogether
concerned
by
development
costs
and
attracted
to
cheaper
options
on
land
the
trump
administration
hopes
the
industry
will
help
supply
power
to
the
northeast
eventually
creating
american
jobs
in
manufacturing
turbines
towers
and
other
components
its
efforts
are
part
of
a
broader
push
to
relax
regulations
and
spur
development
across
the
energy
complex
this
would
be
american
produced
energy
and
american
jobs
said
vincent
devito
energy
policy
advisor
to
interior
secretary
ryan
zinke
it
fits
well
with
the
america
first
for
the
moment
however
europe
s
renewable
energy
companies
are
the
ones
using
the
opportunity
to
advance
their
already
sizable
headstart
in
offshore
wind
projects
since
companies
have
won
all
eight
of
the
government
s
competitive
offshore
wind
lease
auctions
with
aggressive
bids
that
have
pumped
up
prices
into
the
tens
of
millions
of

europeans
claimed
another
victory
in

when
a

between

and
avangrid
the

jonathan

iberdrola
s
managing
director
of
offshore
wind
told
reuters
trump
s
interior
department
gave
the
industry
a
boost
this
year
when
it
announced
major
lease
sales
off
massachusetts
sought
input
on
potential
lease
areas
off
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
began
a
study
of
all
atlantic
coast
waters
for
wind
energy
potential
it
also
proposed
easing
permitting
including
by
allowing
developers
to
get
some
permits
before
making
key
decisions
like
what
size
of
turbines
they
would
use
such
aggressive
leasing
and
flexible
permitting
helped
europe
become
the
world
s
largest
offshore
wind
market
with
thousands
of
wind
turbines
installed
in
the
last
two
decades
and
more
than
billion
euros
in
investment
expected
this
year
according
to
trade
group
windeurope
while
the
east
coast
has
wind
conditions
and
sea
depths
similar
to
the
north
sea
it
boasts
just
one
wind
farm
off
the
coast
of
rhode
island
that
wind
farm
was
developed
by
firm
deepwater
wind
llc
which
is
backed
by
hedge
fund
shaw
group
deepwater
wind
s
chief
executive
jeff
grybowski
called
the
wind
industry
s
hesitation
to
move
offshore
outdated
i
m
sure
that
we
will
see
more
american
entrants
in
this
business
as
time
goes
on
he
said
until
then
we
re
happy
to
fly
the
other
chief
executives
are
less
sanguine
jim
robo
ceo
of
leading
renewable
energy
company
nextera
told
investors
on
a
recent
conference
call
that
development
time
of
to
years
and
uncertainty
around
permitting
raised
serious
questions
about
prospects
offshore
it
is
a
moon
shot
in
terms
of
building
in
terms
of
finding
people
who
actually
know
what
they
re
doing
from
a
construction
standpoint
robo
said
nextera
which
owns
wind
farms
in
the
united
states
and
canada
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
additional
comment
those
concerns
are
echoed
across
much
of
the
industry
there
are
so
many
opportunities
to
do
onshore
at
substantially
lower
cost
said
mike
garland
the
ceo
of
pattern
energy
group
it
makes
more
sense
for
us
to
be
focused
in
that
foreign
companies
are
not
just
dominating
the
offshore
leases
most
of
the
early
projects
according
to
executives
will
rely
almost
exclusively
on
imports
of
everything
from
subsea
cables
to
turbines
that
are
not
currently
made
domestically
meaning
much
of
the
work
will
be
overseas
components
for
deepwater
wind
s
five
turbines
off
rhode
island
for
example
were
shipped
from
spain
denmark
and
france
according
to
grybowski
their
steel
foundations
were
made
in
louisiana
if
construction
demand
picks
up
the
picture
could
change
according
to
a
report
by
consultants
bvg
associates
limited
the
report
said
building
gigawatts
of
offshore
wind
projects
by
would
likely
justify
making
most
turbine
components
on
soil
helping
support
up
jobs
the
interior
department
s
devito
said
he
saw
the
possibilities
first
hand
during
a
visit
to
an
offshore
wind
component
manufacturing
site
in
copenhagen
he
said
he
was
he
was
amazed
by
the
level
of
activity
the
blades
the
steel
towers
the
cranes
the
opportunity
is
to
make
them
here
