australia
the
world
s
biggest
coal
exporter
and
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
exporter
wants
to
build
its
next
big
energy
industry
around
exploiting
solar
and
wind
power
along
with
brown
coal
to
produce
hydrogen
the
same
fuel
used
to
power
rockets
into
space
hydrogen
has
untapped
energy
potential
without
the
downside
of
the
carbon
emissions
from
natural
gas
and
coal
australia
is
seeking
to
supply
what
could
be
a
billion
market
for
hydrogen
to
china
japan
south
korea
and
singapore
by
according
to
a
report
done
for
the
australian
renewable
energy
agency
by
consultants
acil
allen
while
initially
just
a
fraction
of
australia
s
lng
exports
forecast
at
a
billion
billion
in
hydrogen
exports
could
grow
the
same
way
that
australia
s
lng
industry
has
over
the
past
years
according
to
acil
allen
the
australian
government
and
local
gas
producer
woodside
petroleum
the
global
drive
to
cut
carbon
emissions
and
the
falling
cost
of
wind
and
solar
power
has
turned
hydrogen
fuel
into
an
opportunity
now
after
the
idea
was
mooted
more
than
four
decades
ago
many
of
our
traditional
gas
markets
japan
korea
have
adopted
strategies
that
put
hydrogen
and
ultimately
renewable
hydrogen
at
the
core
of
their
energy
future
so
we
want
to
make
sure
we
ve
got
the
capability
of
providing
for
that
market
western
australia
s
regional
development
minister
alannah
mactiernan
told
reuters
the
state
on
launched
a
renewable
hydrogen
council
including
woodside
french
power
producer
engie
sa
and
norway
s
yara
international
to
form
a
plan
to
use
land
wind
and
solar
resources
to
produce
hydrogen
the
development
of
a
hydrogen
business
is
similar
to
the
early
days
of
the
lng
business
said
shaun
gregory
woodside
s
executive
vice
president
for
exploration
and
technology
to
reduce
global
warming
hydrogen
could
be
used
in
fuel
cells
for
vehicles
and
manufacturing
plants
and
could
eventually
replace
natural
gas
for
space
heating
water
heating
and
cooking
in
homes
output
may
start
through
the
gasification
of
brown
coal
with
the
hydrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
separated
out
but
eventually
wind
and
solar
power
would
be
used
to
crack
water
to
become
the
biggest
hydrogen
source
currently
hydrogen
derived
from
coal
gasification
is
cheaper
to
produce
than
from
water
the
goal
is
drive
down
the
costs
of
a
hydrogen
cargo
by
to
a
level
that
japanese
buyers
would
accept
said
australia
s
chief
scientist
alan
finkel
who
is
advising
the
government
on
a
hydrogen
strategy
the
biggest
potential
is
that
we
can
t
meet
the
price
target
he
told
reuters
japan
s
kawasaki
heavy
industries
khi
is
leading
a
a
million
demonstration
project
to
produce
hydrogen
from
brown
coal
from
australia
s
largest
coal
mine
loy
yang
in
victoria
at
this
point
it
is
clearly
cheaper
than
hydrogen
from
renewables
but
in
the
future
they
might
be
the
same
khi
executive
officer
eiichi
harada
told
reuters
at
the
conference
in
melbourne
on
meanwhile
woodside
is
working
with
korea
gas
corp
to
potentially
produce
blue
hydrogen
in
a
process
of
reforming
methane
from
natural
gas
while
eventually
shifting
to
solar
or
wind
to
crack
water
to
make
green
hydrogen
we
believe
blue
hydrogen
carbon
neutral
hydrogen
sourced
from
gas
is
the
key
to
building
scale
and
lowering
costs
in
hydrogen
transport
and
distribution
which
will
enable
an
earlier
transition
to
green
hydrogen
