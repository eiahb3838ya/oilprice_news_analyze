aims
to
increase

a
third
of
its
demand
eventually
the
jordanian
energy
minister
said
on
tuesday
jordan
began
importing
natural
gas
from
egypt
two
months
ago
but
increasing
imports
significantly
would
depend
on
construction
of
a
pipeline
between
jordan
and
iraq
which
has
yet
to
be
built
hala
zawati
jordanian
minister
of
energy
and
mineral
resources
estimated
jordan
s
gas
demands
in
at
around
million
cubic
feet
per
day
jordan
started
receiving
natural
gas
from
egypt
since
september
it
s
on
an
experimental
basis
for
the
pipeline
but
we
hope
in
the
beginning
of
to
increase
these
amounts
she
told
reporters
we
have
not
yet
agreed
with
egypt
now
there
are
negotiations
on
how
much
will
be
pumped
but
we
hope
at
least
one
third
of
the
country
s
requirements
will
be
taken
from
egypt
she
added
without
giving
a
timeframe
for
reaching
that
goal

will
eventually

in
iraq
with
jordan

red
sea
port
of
aqaba
zawati
said
we
ve
had
discussions
with
iraq
that
started
years
ago
it
was
approved
by
the
jordanian
cabinet
and
now
we
are
waiting
for
the
iraqi
side
to
start
working
on
the
it
s
still
there
as
an
idea
but
has
not
yet
materialized
the
political
situation
