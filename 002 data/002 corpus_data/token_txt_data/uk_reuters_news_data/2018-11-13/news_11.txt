a
low
the
latest
sign
that
investors
are
losing
confidence
in
its
turnaround
plan
the
stock
which
peaked
at
almost
in
has
fallen
sharply
since
oil
prices
crashed
in

billion
in
debt
pressures
on
its
share
price
intensified
in
the
past
two
weeks
after
the

flow
targets
in

having
trouble
finding
buyers
the

fell
percent
to
close
at
cents

analysts
said
the
decline
would
not
result
in
a
breach
of

can
trigger
a
nasdaq
deficiency
notice
potentially
leading
to
delisting

judge
him
so
far
the
numbers
aren

in
his
favor

wrote
in
a
note
last
month
the
company
was
million
cash
flow
negative
at

its
plan
to

bottlenecks
markets
aren
t
helping
them
a
whole
lot
