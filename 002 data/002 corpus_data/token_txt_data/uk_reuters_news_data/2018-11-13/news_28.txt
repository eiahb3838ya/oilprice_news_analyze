the
commercial
of
turkey
s
new
billion
oil
refinery
has
been
delayed
until
early
next
year
and
the
plant
is
not
expected
to
reach
full
capacity
until
three
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
as
tests
revealed
minor
faults
the
star
refinery
built
by
azerbaijan
s
state
oil
firm
socar
is
set
to
be
a
game
changer
for
mediterranean
oil
markets
and
will
increase
the
country
s
total
refining
capacity
by
just
over
a
third
the
plant
was
officially
opened
by
turkish
president
tayyip
erdogan
in
october
but
it
is
not
expected
to
start
processing
crude
commercially
until
january
one
of
the
sources
close
to
the
refinery
said
as
tests
are
still
being
carried
out
they
plan
to
ramp
up
slowly
through
the
first
quarter
and
it
is
expected
to
reach
full
processing
capacity
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
source
said
adding
that
the
has
been
delayed
a
few
times
as
tests
had
revealed
small
faults
a
second
source
familiar
with
socar
s
plans
said
that
reaching
full
capacity
could
slip
even
further
into
the
third
quarter
commercial
production
at
new
refineries
particularly
large
ones
often
falls
behind
schedule
as
testing
of
the
various
units
reveals
minor
issues
that
need
ironing
out
a
socar
spokesman
said
full
refining
capacity
would
be
reached
next
year
we
ve
received
two
crude
oil
cargoes
and
refining
is
in
progress
on
the
plant
the
spokesman
said
socar
said
at
the
start
of
this
year
the
refinery
would
start
up
in
the
third
quarter
of
with
commissioning
or
testing
to
be
complete
by
the
end
of
october
star
is
the
biggest
new
refinery
to
start
up
in
europe
for
decades
and
turkey
s
first
in
years
it
will
transform
traditional
mediterranean
crude
flows
once
it
reaches
full
capacity
traders
said
erdogan
said
at
last
month
s
opening
ceremony
that
the
plant
s
output
would
cut
ankara
s
fuel
import
bill
by
about
billion
per
year
socar
plans
to
supply
the
refinery
with
oil
from
different
producers
in
europe
the
black
sea
region
and
the
gulf
the
head
of
socar
s
trading
arm
said
in
an
interview
last
week
it
may
absorb
a
significant
volume
of
local
sour
grades
and
given
an
outage
of
iranian
barrels
and
kirkuk
flow
in
the
market
it
may
become
really
tight
on
the
sour
side
but
the
question
is
how
things
will
look
when
the
actual
happens
a
european
trading
source
said
in
september
socar
signed
a
contract
with
russia
s
rosneft
to
supply
star
with
million
tonnes
of
urals
crude
per
year
or
about
bpd
socar
trading
has
already
delivered
a
barrel
cargo
of
azeri
light
and
a
million
barrel
cargo
of
russian
urals
