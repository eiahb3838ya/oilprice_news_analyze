pakistan
risks
scaring
off
investment
from
global
energy
giants
eyeing
one
of
asia
s
energy
markets
if
it
pursues
renegotiation
of
contracts
for
two
liquefied
natural
gas
terminals
an
architect
of
its
energy
policy
said
shahid
khaqan
abbasi
who
ended
a
stint
as
premier
in
late
may
championed
a
vast
lng
infrastructure
to
ease
energy
shortages
that
throttled
economic
growth
and
brought
hours
of
darkness
every
day
for
nearly
a
decade
it
will
scare
off
foreign
investors
it
s
stupidity
abbasi
told
reuters
in
an
interview
on
monday
this
is
not
a
joke
this
is
not
some
small
company
this
is
engro
the
number
one
corporation
in
he
was
referring
to
a
terminal
built
by
private
conglomerate
engro
corp
which
the
new
government
of
prime
minister
imran
khan
has
said
was
too
costly
and
vowed
to
renegotiate
the
deals
for
pakistan
s
two
lng
terminals
the
second
terminal
was
built
by
pakistan
s
associated
group
and
energy
trading
firm
trafigura
but
such
a
move
will
endanger
pakistan
s
position
as
a
hot
lng
investment
destination
and
deter
producers
such
as
exxon
mobil
and
traders
like
trafigura
and
vitol
all
hunting
for
partners
to
build
more
terminals
said
abbasi

lng
terminal
built
in
pakistan

first
such
facility
rewards
the
company
with
returns
that
are
too
high
engro
responded
by
saying
the
bidding
was
done
in
a
fair
and
transparent
manner
and
it
was
under
no
obligation
to
renegotiate
abbasi
said
engro
s
terminal
offered
one
of
the
lowest
regasification
rates
for
a
floating
lng
terminal
in
the
world
with
the
terminal
operator
charging
cents
per
mmbtu
million
british
thermal
units
for
the
transfer
of
gas
including
five
cents
to
be
paid
to
the
port
engro

to
comment
on

s
remarks
pakistan

agency
announced
an
inquiry
against
abbasi
in

over
an
unspecified

said
he
had
repeatedly
asked
the

to
talk
to
him
or
explain
its
accusations
