spain
plans
to
propose
a
ban
on
sales
of
petrol
diesel
and
hybrid
cars
from
government
sources
said
on
tuesday
joining
a
string
of
countries
taking
aim
at
polluting
vehicles
to
help
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
plan
is
included
in
a
draft
document
for
a
law
on
climate
change
which
socialist
prime
minister
pedro
sanchez
s
government
hopes
to
present
to
parliament
by
the
end
of
the
year
some
of
the
most
important
necessary
changes
affect
transport
the
document
said
from
the
registration
and
sale
in
spain
of
passenger
cars
and
light
commercial
vehicles
that
directly
emit
carbon
dioxide
will
not
be
once
finalised
the
climate
change
law
will
require
approval
by
parliament
where
sanchez
holds
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
seats
sanchez
has
struggled
to
find
support
for
any
major
proposals
including
next
year
s
budget
in
the
face
of
opposition
led
by
the
conservative
people
s
party
which
dominates
the
upper
and
lower
houses
britain
and
france
have
already
pledged
to
ban
petrol
and
diesel
cars
from
which
will
mean
big
changes
for
the
global
car
industry
and
put
a
squeeze
on
oil
producers
profits
some
british
politicians
have
said
london
should
bring
the
ban
forward
to
a
more
ambitious
deadline
already
adopted
by
scotland
while
denmark
wants
to
make
the
move
by
underlining
his
green
ambitions
sanchez
brought
environment
and
energy
together
into
one
ministry
which
has
since
passed
measures
aimed
at
reducing
electricity
prices
and
favors
promoting
renewable
energy
under
the
current
climate
change
plan
madrid
aims
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
to
at
least
percent
