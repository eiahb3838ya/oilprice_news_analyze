leading

analysts
earlier
this

said
palm
oil
prices
would
improve
next

as
production
growth
eases
and
china
shifts
some
of
its
vegetable
oil
demand
to
palm
due
to
its
trade
dispute
with
the
united
states
but
the
possibility
of
rebound
in
prices
is
failing
to
lift
indian
demand
as
banks
have
cut
lending
to
refiners
and
traders

a

a
mountain
of
bad

has
led

been
inflicting
most
pain
on

raised

have
raised

said
he
slashed

due

the
credit
crunch

the
correction
