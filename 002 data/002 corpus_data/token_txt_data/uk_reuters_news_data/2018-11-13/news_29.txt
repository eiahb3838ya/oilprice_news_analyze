update 3-risking trump ire, opec builds case for oil supply cut
london
reuters
opec
built
a
case
on
tuesday
for
cutting
oil
output
when
it
meets
next
month
warning
that
a
supply
glut
could
emerge
in
as
the
world
economy
slows
and
rivals
increase
production
more
quickly
than
expected
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
and
rising
supplies
opec
is
talking
again
of
reducing
production
just
months
after
increasing
it
such
a
shift
would
anger
president
donald
trump
who
on
monday
urged
opec
not
to
cut
supply
in
a
monthly
report
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
world
oil
demand
next
year
would
rise
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
and
the
fourth
consecutive
reduction
in
its
forecast
oil
prices
have
dropped
steeply
from
a
high
above
a
barrel
in
october
pressured
by
concern
that
global
demand
is
weakening
amid
adequate
supply
offsetting
sanctions
on
iran
that
have
started
to
cut
the
opec
country
s
oil
exports
although
the
oil
market
has
reached
a
balance
now
the
forecasts
for
for
supply
growth
indicate
higher
volumes
outpacing
the
expansion
in
world
oil
demand
leading
to
widening
excess
supply
in
the
market
opec
said
in
the
report
the
recent
downward
revision
to
the
global
economic
growth
forecast
and
associated
uncertainties
confirm
the
emerging
pressure
on
oil
demand
observed
in
recent
crude
extended
an
earlier
decline
after
the
release
of
the
opec
report
trading
as
low
as
a
barrel
the
lowest
since
march
together
with
russia
and
other
allies
opec
had
agreed
in
june
to
boost
supply
after
pressure
from
trump
to
lower
prices
the
move
partially
unwound
output
cuts
that
began
in
january
in
an
effort
to
clear
a
glut
that
formed
in
the
group
meets
on
to
set
policy
for
in
the
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
rose
further
in
october
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
after
the
june
deal
the
biggest
rises
came
from
the
united
arab
emirates
and
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
these
helped
offset
declines
in
venezuela
where
economic
crisis
has
curbed
output
and
iran
as
buyers
walked
away
before
sanctions
started
this
month
the
october
production
rate
is
considerably
more
than
opec
expects
consumers
will
require
next
year
opec
said
the
world
would
need
million
bpd
from
its
members
in
down
bpd
from
last
month
this
suggests
there
will
be
a
million
bpd
surplus
in
the
market
should
opec
keep
pumping
the
same
amount
and
other
things
remain
equal
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
on
monday
had
outlined
a
case
for
supply
restraint
saying
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
that
analysis
showed
a
need
to
cut
output
next
year
by
around
million
bpd
from
october
levels
oil
demand
is
slowing
as
the
world
economy
decelerates
opec
nudged
down
its
growth
forecast
in
the
report
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
that
followed
the
supply
cut
is
still
prompting
more
growth
in
rival
production
supply
will
rise
in
by
million
bpd
the
organisation
said
bpd
more
than
previously
thought
and
far
more
than
the
increase
in
world
demand
