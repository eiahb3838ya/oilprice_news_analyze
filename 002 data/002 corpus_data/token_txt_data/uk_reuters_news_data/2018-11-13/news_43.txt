iaea pushes japan for urgent disposal of contaminated fukushima water
tokyo

japan
must
urgently
tackle
a
buildup
of
contaminated
water
at
its
fukushima
nuclear
plant
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
and
tsunami
more
than
seven
years
ago
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
iaea
said
on
tuesday
the
call
after
a
site
visit
by
iaea
experts
follows
last
month
s
admission
by
plant
owner
tokyo
electric
power
tepco
that
water
treated
there
still
contained
radioactive
material
despite
having
said
for
years
it
had
been
removed
a
decision
on
disposing
of
the
water
must
be
taken
urgently
engaging
all
stakeholders
to
ensure
the
sustainability
of
the
decommissioning
activities
the
iaea
said
after
its
team
spent
about
a
week
reviewing
cleanup
efforts
in
its
statement
the
agency
said
dealing
with
the
water
was
critical
to
the
after
three
reactors
had
meltdowns
following
explosions
in
the
wake
of
the
loss
of
power
and
cooling
arrangements
after
the
march
quake
and
tsunami
tepco
s
admission
could
ruin
its
chances
of
releasing
the
water
into
the
ocean
a
move
japan
s
nuclear
regulator
says
is
the
preferred
method
and
is
safe
but
which
local
fishermen
oppose
the
roughly
one
million
tonnes
of
water
stored
at
the
plant
sufficient
for
about
olympic
swimming
pools
still
contains
detectable
levels
of
potentially
harmful
radioactive
particles
