'megafire' that torched town now common in california
nov
reuters
paradise
california
had
long
prepared
for
wildfires
but
only
in
its
worst
nightmares
did
it
imagine
the
kind
of
megafire
that
last
week
destroyed
most
of
the
town
and
killed
at
least
people
born
of
tinder
dry
conditions
and
erratic
winds
the
camp
fire
was
the
latest
california
megafire
a
huge
blaze
that
burns
more
intensely
and
quickly
than
anything
the
state
has
experienced
before
in
recent
years
authorities
in
california
have
reported
an
increase
in
such
large
explosive
and
swiftly
spreading
wildfires
over
a
virtually
fire
season
four
out
of
the
five
largest
fires
in
california
history
have
occurred
in
the
last
six
years
paradise
had
not
seen
significant
rain
for
days
and
the
town
on
a
ridge
in
the
foothills
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
was
surrounded
by
a
potential
bonfire
of
dry
or
dead
trees
following
a
drought
that
ended
in
less
rain
and
longer
droughts
are
the
major
cause
of
the
blazes
which
consume
more
than
acres
hectares
according
to
recent
research
by
the
forest
service
and
university
of
montana
after
a
wildfire
destroyed
homes
in
paradise
in
the
town
of
put
evacuation
plans
in
place
and
fined
homeowners
if
they
did
not
clear
brush
and
prune
trees
to
reduce
fire
risk
but
all
it
took
was
some
kind
of
spark
on
camp
creek
road
west
of
paradise
and
el
diablo
fall
winds
gusting
up
to
mph
kph
to
unleash
the
most
destructive
and
deadly
wildfire
in
california
history
as
the
blaze
roared
west
devouring
nearly
homes
it
created
its
own
fire
whirlwinds
or
firenados
incinerating
an
area
equivalent
to
american
football
fields
acres
per
minute
this
event
was
the
worst
case
scenario
it
was
the
event
we
have
feared
for
a
long
time
local
sheriff
kory
honea
told
reporters
this
has
been
one
of
the
state
s
worst
fire
years
with
nearly
twice
the
acreage
burned
so
far
compared
with
in
areas
managed
by
the
california
department
of
forestry
and
fire
protection
cal
fire
former
forest
service
officials
such
as
jerry
williams
say
too
much
emphasis
is
put
on
fighting
fires
instead
of
accepting
that
they
are
a
natural
part
of
the
environment
and
minimizing
their
impact
forests
that
for
millennia
had
fire
as
part
of
their
ecosystems
have
become
choked
with
growth
and
unhealthy
and
ultimately
tinder
for
megafires
he
said
every
year
we
set
a
new
record
we
invest
more
in
suppression
invest
less
in
mitigation
and
wonder
why
we
re
not
getting
on
top
of
it
williams
a
former
director
of
fire
and
aviation
for
the
forest
service
said
in
an
interview
fire
officials
say
the
trend
to
larger
more
destructive
fires
is
driven
by
vegetation
erratic
winds
and
temperatures
that
are
part
of
climate
change
president
donald
trump
has
blamed
california
s
failure
to
thin
forests
cal
fire
spokeswoman
lia
parker
said
there
were
a
lot
more
factors
at
play
than
cutting
down
trees
a
lot
of
it
is
climate
related
we
ve
seen
a
significant
increase
in
temperatures
we
ve
seen
an
increase
in
dry
and
dead
conditions
parker
said
as
the
camp
fire
raged
similar
conditions
nearly
miles
to
the
south
were
fueling
the
woolsey
fire
which
killed
two
people
and
destroyed
homes
near
los
angeles
it
was
a
fire
storm
the
worst
i
ve
ever
seen
