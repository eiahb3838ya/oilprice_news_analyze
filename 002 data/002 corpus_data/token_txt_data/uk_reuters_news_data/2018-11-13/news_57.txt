is
being
perceived
as
a
positive
outcome
said

catril
markets
strategist
at
national
australia
bank
so
we
have
seen
a
broad
improvement
in
sentiment
across
this
is
good
news
but
there
is
still
some
caution
we
obviously
need
more
detail
on
it
this
should
also
be
taken
in
the
context
of
new
retaliatory
measures
that
the
is
considering
against
earlier
the

the

other

fears

softening

we
