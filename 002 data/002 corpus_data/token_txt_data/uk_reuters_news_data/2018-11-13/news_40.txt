hedge
funds
have
sold
the
equivalent
of
almost
half
a
billion
barrels
of
crude
oil
and
refined
products
in
the
last
six
weeks
as
worries
about
slowing
demand
replaced
earlier
concern
over
sanctions
on
iran
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
cut
their
combined
net
long
position
in
the
six
major
petroleum
futures
and
options
contracts
by
another
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
portfolio
managers
have
sold
million
barrels
of
crude
and
products
since
the
end
of
september
the
largest
reduction
in
any
period
since
at
least
and
probably
the
largest
ever
in
a
comparable
timeframe
funds
now
hold
fewer
than
four
bullish
long
positions
for
every
short
bearish
one
down
from
more
than
at
the
end
of
september
and
the
lowest
ratio
since
august
most
of
the
adjustment
has
come
from
the
long
side
of
the
market
as
formerly
bullish
hedge
funds
liquidate
positions
accumulated
in
the
second
half
of
and
earlier
in
the
number
of
bullish
long
positions
has
fallen
to
just
million
barrels
from
billion
six
weeks
ago
and
a
record
billion
at
the
start
of
the
year
bullish
positions
are
now
at
the
lowest
level
since
september
according
to
an
analysis
of
position
data
published
by
regulators
and
exchanges
but
some
fund
managers
have
begun
to
turn
outright
bearish
with
short
positions
now
up
to
million
barrels
from
just
million
barrels
six
weeks
ago
heavy
selling
by
funds
has
helped
push
oil
prices
down
more
than
per
barrel
percent
since
and
since
most
hedge
fund
positions
are
held
in
contracts
near
to
maturity
the
selling
has
had
a
disproportionate
impact
at
the
front
end
of
the
futures
curve
pushing
crude
futures
prices
deep
into
contango
portfolio
managers
have
reacted
to
an
increasingly
bearish
news
flow
amid
signs
the
oil
market
has
passed
its
current
cyclical
peak
production
growth
is
accelerating
while
consumption
growth
is
slowing
conditions
reminiscent
of
cyclical
peaks
in
and
opec
members
and
their
allies
have
been
boosting
output
partly
in
response
to
political
pressure
from
the
white
house
shale
producers
have
ramped
up
their
own
production
at
the
fastest
rate
on
record
with
output
up
by
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
months
to
august
and
the
united
states
has
issued
waivers
to
allow
some
of
iran
s
most
important
customers
to
continue
buying
oil
despite
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
waivers
that
have
been
more
generous
than
previously
expected
at
the
same
time
oil
traders
have
become
increasingly
worried
about
the
possibility
of
a
global
economic
slowdown
or
even
a
recession
hitting
oil
demand
next
year
and
there
are
signs
higher
oil
prices
have
begun
to
prompt
increased
interest
in
fuel
efficiency
and
other
behavioural
changes
among
consumers
with
consumption
growth
slowing
from
rapid
rates
in
and
with
the
market
on
course
for
oversupply
oil
prices
needed
to
fall
from
recent
highs
to
curb
production
boost
consumption
and
avert
a
large
buildup
in
excess
inventories
in
price
falls
have
already
begun
to
enforce
the
rebalancing
process
with
opec
and
its
allies
starting
to
discuss
production
cuts
of
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
some
observers
have
expressed
surprise
at
how
quickly
market
commentary
has
shifted
from
the
need
for
more
oil
to
concerns
about
oversupply
but
the
speed
of
the
shift
is
not
unusual
in
and
market
commentary
shifted
from
fears
about
undersupply
to
oversupply
within
three
to
four
months
around
the
peak
and
something
similar
appears
to
be
happening
this
time
