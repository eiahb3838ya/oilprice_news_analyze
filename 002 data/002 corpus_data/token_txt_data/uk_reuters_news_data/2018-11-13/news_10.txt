feature-fuel shortages the new normal in venezuela as oil industry unravels
reuters
with
chronic
shortages
of
basic
goods
afflicting
her
native
venezuela
veronica
perez
used
to
drive
from
supermarket
to
supermarket
in
her
gray
chevrolet
aveo
searching
for
food
but
the
engineer
has
abandoned
the
practice
because
of
shortages
of
something
that
should
be
abundant
in
a
country
with
the
world
s
largest
oil
reserves
gasoline
i
only
do
what
is
absolutely
necessary
nothing
else
said
perez
who
lives
in
the
industrial
city
of
valencia
she
said
she
had
stopped
going
to
venezuela
s
caribbean
coast
just
miles
km
away
snaking
lines
and
gas
station
closures
have
long
afflicted
venezuela
s
border
regions
fuel
smuggling
to
neighboring
countries
is
common
the
result
of
generous
subsidies
from
oil
company
pdvsa
that
allow
venezuelans
to
fill
their
tank
times
for
the
price
of
one
kilo
pounds
of
cheese
but
in
late
october
and
early
november
cities
in
the
populous
central
region
of
the
country
like
valencia
and
the
capital
caracas
were
hit
by
a
rare
wave
of
shortages
due
to
plunging
crude
production
and
a
dramatic
drop
in
refineries
fuel
output
as
the
economy
suffers
its
fifth
year
of
recession
venezuela
produced
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
last
year
but
by
september
output
had
fallen
to
just
million
bpd
so
far
in
venezuela
produced
an
average
of
million
bpd
the
lowest
in
nearly
seven
decades
according
to
figures
reported
to
opec
bottlenecks
for
transporting
fuel
from
refineries
distribution
centers
and
ports
to
gas
stations
have
also
worsened
exacerbating
the
shortages
pdvsa
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
neither
did
venezuela
s
oil
and
communications
ministries
relatively
normal
supply
has
since
been
restored
in
caracas
and
valencia
after
unusually
long
outages
but
the
episode
has
forced
venezuelans
to
alter
their
daily
habits
that
could
hit
an
economy
seen
shrinking
by
double
digits
in
for
venezuelans
coping
with
a
lack
of
food
and
medicine
blackouts
and
hyperinflation
the
gasoline
shortages
could
also
increase
frustration
with
president
nicolas
maduro
my
new
headache
is
fearing
i
might
run
out
of
gasoline
said
elena
bustamante
a
english
teacher
in
valencia
it
has
changed
my
life
venezuela
s
economy
has
shrunk
by
more
than
half
since
maduro
took
office
in
the
contraction
has
been
driven
by
a
collapse
in
the
price
of
crude
and
falling
oil
sales
which
account
for
more
than
percent
of
venezuelan
exports
three
million
venezuelans
have
emigrated
or
around
of
the
population
mostly
in
the
past
three
years
according
to
the
united
nations
despite
a
sharp
drop
in
domestic
demand
due
to
the
recession
venezuela
s
collapsing
oil
industry
is
struggling
to
produce
enough
gasoline
fuel
demand
was
expected
to
fall
to
bpd
in
october
half
the
volume
of
a
decade
ago
but
pdvsa
expected
to
be
able
to
supply
only
bpd
according
to
a
company
planning
document
seen
by
reuters
a
gasoline
price
hike
promised
by
maduro
in
august
under
a
reform
package
could
further
reduce
demand
but
it
has
yet
to
take
effect
venezuela
s
declining
oil
production
has
its
roots
in
years
of
underinvestment
sanctions
have
complicated
financing
the
refining
sector
designed
to
produce
million
bpd
of
fuel
is
severely
hobbled
it
is
operating
at
just
of
capacity
according
to
experts
and
union
sources
its
largest
refinery
amuay
is
delivering
just
bpd
of
gasoline
despite
having
the
capacity
to
produce
bpd
of
fuel
according
to
union
leader
ivan
freites
and
another
person
close
to
pdvsa
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
pdvsa
has
tried
to
make
up
for
this
by
boosting
fuel
imports
buying
about
half
of
the
gasoline
the
country
needs
according
to
internal
company
figures
in
the
first
eight
months
of
venezuela
imported
an
average
of
bpd
from
the
united
states
up
percent
from
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
show
but
delays
in
unloading
fuel
cargoes
have
contributed
to
shortages
since
venezuelan
oil
ports
are
more
oriented
toward
exports
than
imports
according
to
traders
shippers
pdvsa
sources
and
refinitiv
eikon
data
one
tanker
bringing
imported
gasoline
mixed
with
ethanol
was
contaminated
with
high
levels
of
water
forcing
pdvsa
to
withdraw
the
product
from
distribution
centers
a
company
source
said
directly
contributing
to
the
shortages
in
caracas
the
incident
was
the
result
of
pdvsa
seeking
fuel
from
unreliable
suppliers
in
part
because
the
sanctions
have
left
many
companies
unwilling
to
do
business
with
venezuela
said
the
source
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
the
shortages
last
week
prevented
andres
merida
a
freelance
publicist
in
valencia
from
attending
client
meetings
i
had
someone
who
used
to
take
me
from
place
to
place
but
in
light
of
the
gasoline
issue
he
would
not
give
me
a
lift
even
when
i
offered
to
pay
him
he
said
he
said
he
would
prefer
to
save
the
gasoline
and
guarantee
it
