washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
may
issue
fewer
biofuel
waivers
to
small
refineries
under
acting
administrator
andrew
wheeler
than
it
did
under
its
previous
leadership
republican
senator
chuck
grassley
of
iowa
said
on
tuesday
i
sense
that
wheeler
has
a
feeling
that
former
administrator
scott
pruitt
was
very
liberal
on
his
issuing
of
waivers
grassley
told
a
conference
call
asked
if
he
thought
such
an
attitude
change
could
lead
to
fewer
waivers
grassley
one
of
the
most
powerful
voices
for
agriculture
interests
said
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
is
among
the
most
controversial
issues
dividing
the
corn
industry
and
big
oil
under
the
renewable
fuel
standard
rfs
refiners
are
required
to
blend
increasing
amounts
of
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
fuel
supply
each
year
to
help
expand
the
market
for
farm
products
but
small
refineries
can
apply
for
waivers
if
they
demonstrate
that
complying
would
cause
them
hardship
under
pruitt
the
number
of
waivers
granted
to
small
refiners
soared
angering
the
biofuels
industry
which
argued
the
program
was
being
used
to
benefit
energy
companies
while
undermining
demand
for
fuel
wheeler
took
over
the
epa
in
july
after
pruitt
resigned
in
a
flurry
of
ethical
controversies
while
wheeler
has
said
little
about
his
approach
to
the
small
refinery
waiver
program
he
has
said
he
would
like
to
introduce
reforms
to
the
rfs
that
can
please
both
the
energy
and
agriculture
industries
at
trump
s
direction
the
epa
is
currently
working
on
a
proposal
to
expand
sales
of
higher
ethanol
gasoline
blends
year
round
a
move
meant
to
help
corn
growers
stung
by
soft
domestic
demand
and
a
loss
of
export
markets
from
trade
disputes
