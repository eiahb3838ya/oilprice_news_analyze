us envoy warns sanctions still an option against nord stream 2
brussels
reuters
the
united
states
could
yet
impose
new
sanctions
to
try
to
block
construction
of
the
russian
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
across
the
baltic
sea
to
the
european
union
the
ambassador
to
the
eu
said
on
tuesday
asked
if
donald
trump
could
take
further
measures
to
thwart
a
project
which
the
president
has
said
would
leave
eu
countries
even
more
beholden
to
moscow
for
their
energy
gordon
sondland
said
we
have
not
deployed
the
full
set
of
tools
yet
that
could
significantly
undermine
if
not
outright
stop
the
addressing
an
audience
at
the
european
policy
centre
in
brussels
sondland
added
we
re
hoping
that
the
opposition
to
the
project
works
organically
because
the
eu
and
its
member
countries
agree
that
dependence
on
russian
energy
is
not
a
good
geopolitical
decision
if
that
philosophy
is
not
adopted
and
nord
stream
continues
then
the
president
has
many
many
other
tools
at
his
disposal
i
m
not
going
to
go
through
the
litany
to
try
and
curb
and
stop
the
in
august
trump
signed
new
sanctions
on
russia
into
law
that
the
pipeline
s
promoter
gazprom
said
could
hold
up
some
of
its
projects
for
now
construction
is
continuing
with
the
participation
of
some
major
eu
companies
despite
opposition
from
many
eu
states
and
from
the
eu
executive
germany
the
pipeline
s
destination
refuses
to
join
eu
opposition
describing
it
as
a
private
enterprise
last
week
on
a
visit
to
poland
which
is
a
vocal
critic
of
nord
stream
energy
secretary
rick
perry
said
trump
was
maintaining
the
option
of
imposing
sanctions
washington
has
not
detailed
potential
actions
but
one
way
in
which
the
united
states
could
undermine
the
project
would
be
by
penalizing
big
multinational
firms
working
on
it
sondland
stressed
that
opposition
was
not
based
on
hopes
of
exporting
more
gas
to
europe
but
on
concern
that
russia
could
increase
its
leverage
on
key
allies
in
the
nato
alliance
through
its
control
of
their
energy
supplies
we
don
t
want
to
see
someone
s
gas
turned
off
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
when
there
is
a
political
crisis
he
said
when
europe
is
vulnerable
the
united
states
is
vulnerable
and
we
don
t
want
to
put
ourselves
in
that
gazprom
is
the
sole
shareholder
in
nord
stream
shouldering
half
of
the
billion
euro
billion
construction
cost
gazprom

western
partners
are
