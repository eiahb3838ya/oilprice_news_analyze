natural
gas
is
expected
to
overtake
coal
as
the
world
s
second
largest
energy
source
after
oil
by
due
to
a
drive
to
cut
air
pollution
and
the
rise
in
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
use
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
tuesday
the
iea
said
in
its
world
energy
outlook
that
energy
demand
would
grow
by
more
than
a
quarter
between
and
assuming
more
efficient
use
of
energy
but
would
rise
by
twice
that
much
without
such
improvements
global
gas
demand
would
increase
by
percent
a
year
to
and
would
be
percent
higher
by
then
than
today
it
said
the
estimates
are
based
on
the
iea
s
new
policies
scenario
that
takes
into
account
legislation
and
policies
to
reduce
emissions
and
fight
climate
change
they
also
assume
more
energy
efficiencies
in
fuel
use
buildings
and
other
factors
natural
gas
is
the
fastest
growing
fossil
fuel
in
the
new
policies
scenario
overtaking
coal
by
to
become
the
source
of
energy
after
oil
the
report
said
china
already
the
world
s
biggest
oil
and
coal
importer
would
soon
become
the
largest
importer
of
gas
and
net
imports
would
approach
the
level
of
the
european
union
by
the
iea
said
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
china
s
general
administration
of
customs
data
china
has
already
overtaken
japan
as
the
world
s
top
natural
gas
importer
although
china
is
the
world
s
user
of
natural
gas
behind
the
united
states
and
russia
it
has
to
import
about
percent
of
its
needs
as
local
production
can
not
keep
pace
emerging
economies
in
asia
would
account
for
about
half
of
total
global
gas
demand
growth
and
their
share
of
lng
imports
would
double
to
percent
by
the
iea
report
said
although
talk
of
a
global
gas
market
similar
to
that
of
oil
is
premature
lng
trade
has
expanded
substantially
in
volume
since
and
has
reached
previously
isolated
markets
it
said
lng
involves
cooling
gas
to
a
liquid
so
it
can
transported
by
ship
the
united
states
would
account
for
percent
of
total
gas
production
growth
to
the
iea
said
while
other
sources
would
take
over
as
shale
gas
output
flattened
and
other
nations
started
turning
to
unconventional
methods
of
gas
production
such
as
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
global
electricity
demand
will
grow
percent
a
year
mostly
driven
by
rising
use
in
developing
economies
electricity
will
account
for
a
quarter
of
energy
used
by
end
users
such
as
consumers
and
industry
by
it
said
coal
and
renewables
will
swap
their
positions
in
the
power
generation
mix
the
share
of
coal
is
forecast
to
fall
from
about
percent
today
to
a
quarter
in
while
renewables
would
grow
to
just
over
percent
from
a
quarter
now
carbon
dioxide
emissions
will
continue
to
grow
at
a
slow
but
steady
pace
to
from
levels
the
iea
said
emissions
would
rise
by
percent
to
gigatonnes
in
mostly
driven
by
growth
in
oil
and
gas
this
trajectory
was
far
out
of
step
with
what
scientific
knowledge
says
would
be
required
to
tackle
climate
change
