as
venezuela
collapses
one
investment
fund
is
poised
to
win
big
from
litigation
against
its
socialist
government
tenor
capital
management
since
the
new
york
firm
has
invested
million
in
canadian
mining
firm
crystallex
international
corp
largely
to
fund
a
lawsuit
being
waged
against
venezuela
for
expropriating
a
gold
mine
now
tenor
stands
to
claim
around
million
of
a
billion
international
arbitration
award
that
crystallex
has
been
trying
to
collect
since
tenor
s
cash
allowed
crystallex
to
force
venezuela
to
pay
up
by
attempting
a
seizure
of
citgo
petroleum
corp
the
country
s
overseas
crown
jewel
the
case
is
part
of
wave
of
lawsuits
bankrolled
by
firms
specializing
in
litigation
finance
providing
funding
to
plaintiffs
in
return
for
a
slice
of
any
financial
winnings
while
the
practice
dates
back
centuries
the
business
has
boomed
over
the
past
decade
fueled
by
favorable
court
rulings
and
investors
seeking
juicy
returns
not
correlated
to
stock
markets
between
and
the
money
committed
to
cases
grew
percent
a
year
and
is
expected
to
top
billion
annually
by
according
to
litigation
financing
firm
vannin
capital
these
companies
have
backed
a
slew
of
corporate
lawsuits
including
investor
litigation
in
volkswagen
s
emissions
scandal
and
a
million
unjust
enrichment
case
against
billionaire
ira
rennert
but
foreign
governments
are
emerging
as
popular
targets
as
well
putting
taxpayers
at
risk
for
claims
in
addition
to
tenor
firms
working
this
niche
include
london
stock
burford
capital
imf
bentham
ltd
of

and
therium
group

ltd
of
the
uk
litigation
finance
companies
typically
seek
returns
of
three
to
times
their
initial
investment
industry
players
said
now
a
market
is
developing
for
these
firms
to
begin
cashing
out
before
a
suit
concludes
by
selling
portions
of
their
portfolios
or
even
slices
of
individual
cases
to
other
investors
burford
for
example
scored
a
percent
return
by
selling
for
million
its
entitlement
in
a
case
against
argentina
over
two
expropriated
airlines
burford
said
it
invested
million
in
the
litigation
critics
fear
this
financing
will
embolden
companies
to
bring
weaker
cases
and
that
developing
countries
will
be
more
likely
to
be
sued
for
adopting
regulations
to
protect
public
health
or
the
environment
money
from
funders
also
discourages
companies
from
sticking
with
commitments
in
foreign
markets
according
to
lise
johnson
the
head
of
the
columbia
center
on
sustainable
investment
at
columbia
university
in
new
york
with

there
is
an
incentive
to
sell

and
leave

said
litigation
finance
companies
say
they
are
helping
the
underdogs
small
companies
wronged
by
governments
it
s
an
easy
story
to
tell
that
these
are
rapacious
hedge
funds
trying
to
bring
a
struggling
country
to
its
knees
said
zachary
krug
senior
investment
officer
with

in

that
s
not
what
we
eric
blinderman
who
heads
the
north
american
business
of
funding
firm
therium
said
funders
guard
against
weak
cases
by
providing
a
neutral
opinion
on
the
strength
of
claims
he
said
his
firm
backs
less
than
percent
of
the
cases
brought
to
it
and
requires
a
percent
chance
of
success
otherwise
he
said
we
d
lose
a
lot
of
cases
we
funded
and
therium
would
be
out

the
crystallex
case
started
in
when
caracas
expropriated
the
company
s
mining
project
at
las
cristinas
one
of
the
world
s
largest
gold
deposits
located
in
southeastern
venezuela
crystallex
sought
compensation
through
what
is
known
as
dispute
settlement
or
isds
by
bringing
an
arbitration
case
registered
with
the
world
bank
effectively
bankrupted
by
the
loss
of
its

crystallex
turned
to
tenor
tenor
and
crystallex
declined
to
comment
court
records
show
tenor
eventually
provided
million
to
fund
the
litigation
in
return
crystallex
agreed
to
give
tenor
at
least
percent
of
any
payments
it
could
collect
from
venezuela
once
crystallex
paid
off
tenor
s
loan
and
other
creditors

that
has
grown
to

crystallex
said
in
november
it
had
already
received
million
just
weeks
later
the
company
accused
venezuela
of
breaching
the
agreement
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
will
receive
a
full
payout
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
companies
increasingly
are
taking
on
foreign
governments
in
the
icsid
and
other
tribunals
including
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
united
nations
in
the
there
were
typically
around
cases
per
year
but
since
the
number
has
jumped
to
an
average
of
cases
annually
according
to
a
united
nations
report
the
un
noted
that
figure
could
be
even
higher
as
some
cases
remain
entirely
confidential
funding
arrangements
generally
are
not
disclosed
the
world
bank
has
proposed
changing
that
in
part
to
shed
light
on
potential
conflicts
of
interest
between
arbitrators
and
funders
for
now
it
is
unclear
how
many
companies
are
funding
such
cases
using
litigation
financing
also
known
funding
but
industry
executives
and
lawyers
say
the
practice
is
common
in
some
respects
every
claimant
in
isds
cases
has
considered
the
use
of
funding
said
krug
of
woodsford
litigation
funding
tenor
for
example
is
financing
two
other
arbitration
cases
for
canadian
companies
with
allegedly
expropriated
mining
projects
a
billion
claim
by
gabriel
resources
ltd
against
romania
and
a
million
claim
by
eco
oro
minerals
corp
against
colombia
according
to
company
records
the
firm
also
invested
in
a
case
against
uruguay
over
the
demise
of
that
nation
s
former
flagship
airline
pluna
while
payouts
are
potentially
the
risks
are
considerable
industry
veterans
say
three
of
every
cases
is
a
complete
loss
said
mick
smith
the
of
litigation
financing
firm
calunius
capital
speaking
at
an
industry
conference
in
europe
this
year
even
successful
cases
can
tie
up
capital
for
years
a
calunius
client
rusoro
mining
ltd
of
canada
settled
with
venezuela
in
october
on
a
billion
arbitration
award
six
years
after
calunius
first
extended
the
money
according
to
a
statement
from
rusoro
venezuela
s
final
payment
on
the
settlement
is
not
due
for
five
years
rusoro
said
meanwhile
backlash
against
the
arbitration
system
is
growing
south
africa
india
indonesia
and
several
latin
american
nations
have
terminated
investment
treaties
containing
isds
clauses
with
a
number
of
countries
some
clients
too
have
been
left
disgruntled
by
financing
terms
that
leave
them
with
pennies
on
the
dollar
from
big
settlements
crystallex
shareholders
sought
to
reduce
tenor
s
share
of
the
venezuela
arbitration
settlement
alleging
in
court
documents
that
tenor
violated
canadian
laws
against
excessive
interest
rates
a
canadian
judge
rejected
their
argument
this
year
he
said
there
would
have
been
no
payout
at
all
if
not
for
tenor
s
cash
