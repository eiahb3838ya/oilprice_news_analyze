the
giant
solar
panels
mounted
on
the
roof
of
budiriro
polyclinic
a
public
health
centre
in
harare
bring
a
smile
to
the
faces
of
patients
including
alen
tafirei
the
steady
power
supply
from
the
sun
means
vaccines
can
be
refrigerated
for
example
without
disruption
from
frequent
outages
as
in
the
past
we
are
now
no
longer
inconvenienced
with
excuses
from
nurses
of
the
unavailability
of
electricity
to
cater
for
some
services
said
tafirei
who
was
suffering
from
a
bad
headache
solar
helps
us
quite
a
so
far
healthcare
facilities
have
been
equipped
with
solar
systems
across
zimbabwe
s
provinces
in
a
partnership
between
the
united
nations
development
programme
undp
and
zimbabwe
s
ministry
of
health
and
child
care
the
global
fund
to
fight
aids
tuberculosis
and
malaria
is
funding
the
project
amid
a
global
trend
to
equip
health
facilities
in
developing
countries
with
solar
power
systems
zimbabwe
is
one
of
the
first
to
benefit
in
southern
africa
installations
under
the
programme
started
in
early
then
zimbabwe
had
been
experiencing
power
cuts
of
up
to
hours
a
day
for
about
two
years
as
drought
shrank
water
levels
for
hydro
and
electricity
imports
were
unable
to
fill
the
gap
the
outages
were
damaging
for
pharmaceuticals
and
laboratories
that
must
be
kept
at
certain
temperatures
said
emmanuel
boadi
a
undp
programme
manager
in
zimbabwe
it
was
creating
problems
affecting
the
quality
of
health
products
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
barbara
mashonga
a
at
budiriro
polyclinic
said
the
health
centre
s
electricity
bill
had
dropped
sharply
since
it
started
producing
its
own
solar
power
mothers
no
longer
have
to
give
birth
by
candlelight
and
vaccines
do
not
need
to
be
sent
for
storage
elsewhere
during
power
cuts
she
added
undp
s
boadi
said
other
facilities
had
also
experienced
similar
benefits
in
a
letter
to
undp
the
regina
coeli
mission
hospital
in
manicaland
province
for
example
said
its
solar
system
had
gone
a
long
way
in
supporting
and
enhancing
quality
service
delivery
as
well
as
saving
on
electricity
costs
the
solar
power
supply
serves
as
a
for
the
maternity
ward
operating
theatre
outpatients
women
s
and
child
health
departments
and
the
administration
block
it
added
despite
the
benefits
of
the
new
clean
energy
systems
there
have
been
teething
troubles
which
project
officers
have
sought
to
address
boadi
said
panel
breakdowns
and
tampering
could
be
detected
using
remote
monitoring
systems
on
rooftops
engineer
clive
marimo
director
for
hospital
planning
and
infrastructure
at
the
ministry
of
health
and
child
care
said
theft
of
solar
panels
was
a
major
issue
as
was
maintenance
to
protect
the
equipment
metal
fences
have
been
provided
and
the
ministry
has
also
employed
security
guards
at
some
sites
he
added
other
clinics
have
hired
private
guards
or
are
working
with
local
police
what
to
do
with
expired
solar
batteries
which
last
for
eight
to
years
is
another
challenge
undp
is
working
with
a
sustainability
consultant
to
find
an
environmentally
friendly
way
to
dispose
of
them
said
boadi
before
the
new
solar
systems
were
installed
the
vast
majority
of
the
clinics
used
grid
power
when
it
was
available
a
few
without
a
grid
connection
had
solar
systems
provided
by
the
rural
electrification
agency
but
those
had
broken
down
forcing
them
to
rely
on
candles
and
small
petrol
generators
the
children
s
agency
unicef
is
also
now
planning
to
install
solar
systems
in
clinics
and
schools
said
undp
zimbabwe
country
director
georges
van
montfort
an
evaluation
of
the
project
in
will
be
used
as
a
basis
to
seek
funding
from
companies
to
expand
the
initiative
he
added
data
from
is
not
yet
available
but
initial
feedback
from
sites
with
solar
power
is
very
positive
he
noted
for
activists
like
melvin
chinovava
a
member
of
the
mudavanhu
support
group
in
mwenezi
district
masvingo
province
the
scheme
has
made
it
easier
and
quicker
to
get
his
antiretrovirals
with
access
to
solar
power
nurses
just
turn
on
their
computers
to
see
which
line
of
drugs
i
m
supposed
to
get
as
per
my
medical
records
he
said
in
the
past
patients
had
to
wait
for
nurses
to
go
through
piles
of
records
manually
to
find
out
which
treatment
regime
suited
them
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
the
online
data
system
enables
patients
who
need
to
move
for
their
work
to
continue
treatment
uninterrupted
at
a
new
healthcare
centre
said
undp
spokesman
anesu
freddy
it
was
while
helping
the
health
ministry
computerise
its
data
on
patients
that
undp
understood
the
need
for
a
constant
electricity
supply
which
was
a
key
driver
of
the
initiative
freddy
added
besides
improving
access
to
health
services
the
project
also
aims
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
from
the
health
sector
said
undp
s
boadi
the
programme
can
help
zimbabwe
meet
its
goals
under
the
paris
agreement
to
curb
global
warming
which
include
boosting
renewable
energy
officials
said
eventually
undp
hopes
solar
systems
can
be
installed
to
power
schools
local
government
offices
farms
and
homes
too
setting
up
solar
for
clean
energy
in
communities
remains
an
idea
which
we
will
implement
on
getting
more
funding
