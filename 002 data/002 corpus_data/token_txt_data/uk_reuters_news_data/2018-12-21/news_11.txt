reuters
poland
promised
to
give
tax
relief
to
energy
consumers
and
asked
its
utilities
to
cut
costs
as
part
of
measures
designed
to
prevent
surging
electricity
prices
next
year
when
the
country
holds
a
general
election
the
measures
proposed
by
the
government
ruled
by
the
conservative
law
and
justice
party
pis
will
help
keep
power
prices
at
the
level
seen
in
the
first
half
of
prime
minister
mateusz
morawiecki
said
in
a
televised
press
conference
wholesale
power
prices
in
poland
surged
earlier
this
year
mostly
driven
by
rising
coal
prices
and
carbon
emission
costs
as
poland
generates
most
of
its
electricity
in
polluting
power
plants
as
a
result
of
the
eu
climate
policies
and
mistakes
by
our
predecessors
there
are
some
mechanisms
which
are
pushing
power
prices
up
but
we
are
launching
mechanisms
which
will
help
keep
prices
stable
morawiecki
said
the
draft
law
says
that
the
excise
tax
paid
by
all
electricity
consumers
in
poland
will
be
cut
to
zlotys
per
megawatt
hour
mwh
from
zlotys
morawiecki
also
called
on
power
producers
which
include
pge
enea
energa
and
tauron
to
cut
costs
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
tax
relief
the
government
plans
to
sell
extra
emission
allowances
to
the
tune
of
around
billion
zlotys
the
sum
of
all
these
assumptions
will
result
in
prices
being
stable
at
the
level
in
the
first
half
of
morawiecki
also
said
while
the
head
of
the
energy
market
regulator
said
earlier
this
year
that
higher
energy
prices
would
have
to
be
reflected
in
household
bills
the
energy
minister
has
said
prices
will
remain
unchanged
the
expected
rise
in
power
prices
has
prompted
the
central
bank
to
increase
its
inflation
