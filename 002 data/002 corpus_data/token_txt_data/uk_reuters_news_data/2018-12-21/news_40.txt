london
reuters
centrica
owner
of
britain
s
largest
energy
supplier
british
gas
said
it
is
seeking
a
judicial
review
of
the
way
regulator
ofgem
has
calculated
part
of
its
price
cap
although
it
does
not
plan
to
delay
the
cap
coming
into
effect
ofgem
is
due
to
impose
a
price
cap
from
on
the
most
commonly
used
default
tariffs
as
the
government
seeks
to
limit
household
utility
bills
the
cap
is
expected
to
save
uk
households
around
billion
pounds
a
year
centrica
said
it
sought
to
challenge
the
way
ofgem
treated
suppliers
ability
to
recover
wholesale
energy
costs
when
calculating
the
cap
through
this
action
centrica
has
no
intention
to
delay
implementation
of
the
cap
and
does
not
expect
the
cap
to
be
deferred
in
any
way
centrica
said
in
a
statement
published
late
on
thursday
ofgem
set
the
cap
at
pounds
a
year
for
a
typical
use
customer
pounds
lower
than
british
gas
s
current
standard
variable
tariff
and
well
below
the
average
prices
of
all
of
the
big
six
energy
firms
ofgem
carried
out
an
extensive
consultation
process
when
setting
the
price
cap
and
we
believe
that
it
offers
consumers
on
poor
value
tariffs
a
fairer
deal
a
spokesman
for
the
regulator
said
via
email
when
it
announced
the
plan
in
september
the
regulator
said
it
would
review
the
cap
to
take
into
account
any
changes
in
wholesale
prices
and
other
costs
with
the
first
review
to
take
place
in
february
and
any
changes
to
take
effect
in
april
wholesale
energy
costs
have
soared
since
the
cap
was
calculated
leading
analysts
to
forecast
ofgem
will
need
to
hike
the
level
next
year
britain

other
