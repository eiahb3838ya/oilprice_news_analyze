abandoned
due
to
conditions
in
the
shaft
unfortunately
we
have
reached
a
point
where
it
was
impossible
to
move
forward
because
there
was
a
fire
raging
and
zero
visibility
okd
managing

boleslav
kowalczyk
said
the
affected
part
of
the
mine
was
being
sealed
off

would
only
be
able
to
return
to
recover
the
victims
at
an
unspecified
date
when
conditions
allowed

said
a
network
of
methane
sensors
deployed
in
the
mine
had
not
detected
anything
unusual
prior
to
the

victims
were

without

the
lives
of
the

was
looking
into
ways

compensate
the
victims
