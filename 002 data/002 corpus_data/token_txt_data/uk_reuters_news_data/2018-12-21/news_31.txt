reuters
political
instability
and
low
credit
ratings
in
emerging
economies
are
putting
some
shipowners
off
ordering
new
floating
storage
and
regasification
units
fsrus
as
they
shift
focus
to
more
mature
gas
markets
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
demand
from
emerging
markets
in
asia
africa
and
south
america
was
expected
to
be
boosted
by
fsru
technologies
that
are
less
expensive
and
than
onshore
import
terminals
but
a
boom
in
speculative
fsru
orders
from
shipowners
led
to
an
oversupply
of
units
this
year
as
import
projects
across
the
world
were
delayed
or
cancelled
suggesting
demand
had
been
overestimated
norway
s
hoegh
lng
announced
on
friday
a
second
contract
for
an
fsru
in
australia
this
year
the
fsru
project
for
the
import
of
lng
at
crib
point
in
victoria
developed
by
australia
s
agl
energy
ltd
will
allow
hoegh
to
charter
out
its
fsru
for
years
the
move
comes
as
australia
s
eastern
states
suffer
from
gas
shortages
even
though
lng
production
on
the
west
coast
made
the
country
the
largest
lng
producer
in
november
in
august
hoegh
lng
won
a
tender
for
an
import
project
in
new
south
wales
developed
by
australian
industrial
energy
a
consortium
that
includes
japan
s
jera
and
marubeni
we
will
only
work
with
either
major
energy
or
state
companies
now
hoegh
s
chief
executive
sveinung
stoehle
told
reuters
hoegh
has
pulled
out
of
fsru
projects
in
ghana
chile
and
pakistan
due
to
delays
and
cancellations
stoehle
said
he
sees
asia
as
the
main
market
for
hoegh
fsrus
now
the
fsru
hoegh
esperanza
started
a
contract
for
china
s
cnooc
this
year
stoehle
hopes
to
deliver
one
more
fsru
to
china
in
the
next
two
years
we
will
not
place
new
orders
until
we
have
deals
for
our
existing
fsrus
he
added
with
the
australian
deals
concluded
hoegh
is
thought
to
have
two
fsrus
still
not
committed
to
a
contract
however
the
company
is
a
frontrunner
for
an
import
project
in
an
asian
country
with
a
decision
due
within
a
year
stoehle
said
hoegh
is
also
in
advanced
talks
with
germany
s
uniper
on
the
sharjah
fsru
project
in
the
united
arab
emirates
a
source
familiar
with
the
talks
said
other
shipowners
appear
to
be
taking
a
similar
strategy
belgium
s
exmar
said
it
also
would
look
for
contracts
before
ordering
new
vessels
after
the
sale
of
a
percent
stake
in
its
four
units
to

excelerate

in
the
company

only
one
fsru
a

chartered
for
years
to
swiss

house
gunvor
for
a
bangladesh
import
project
now
halted
by
political
uncertainty
in
the
country
we
have
not
taken
any
final
decision
yet
but
its
chances
are
very
thin

spokesman
said
we
will
order

for
the

lng
shipping
consultancy
said
he
would
be
surprised
to
see
any
fsru
orders

from
the
mol
germany
fsru
in
the
oversupply
of
units
led
to
around
seven
fsrus
being
employed
as
lng
carriers
this
year
shipbrokers
said
the
problem
of
oversupply
goes
back
to
domestic
politics
in
