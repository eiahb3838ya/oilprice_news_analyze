crude refusal: china shuns u.s. oil despite trade war truce
singapore
reuters
china
the
world
s
top
oil
importer
is
set
to
start
buying
little
or
no
crude
from
the
united
states
despite
a
truce
in
a
trade
scrap
between
the
two
nations
with
relatively
high
freight
costs
and
political
uncertainty
choking
demand
that
muted
appetite
means
the
united
states
which
became
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
this
year
as
its
shale
output
hit
record
levels
will
continue
to
hold
only
a
sliver
of
china
s
market
even
as
a
wave
of
new
refining
capacity
starts
up
there
it
also
suggests
that
china
is
unlikely
to
use
crude
purchases
to
help
plug
a
widening
trade
gap
with
the
united
states
which
remains
a
core
source
of
tensions
between
the
world
s
top
two
economies
the
trade
deficit
with
beijing
hit
a
record
billion
in
october
as
its
firms
stockpiled
inventory
from
china
to
avoid
higher
tariffs
that
may
kick
in
next
year

chinese

have

incentive

chinese
refineries
that
used
to
purchase
oil
regularly
said
they
had
not
resumed
buying
due
to
uncertainty
over
the
outlook
for
trade
relations
between
washington
and
beijing
as
well
as
rising
freight
costs
and

a

official
with

said
his
plant
had
stopped
buying
oil
from
october
and
had
not
booked
any
cargoes
for
delivery
in
the
first
quarter
because
of
the
great

earlier
on

actually
readjusted
back
to
using

to

they
just

he
said
he
added
that
his
plant
had
shifted
to
replacements
such
as
north

crude
australian

and
oil

maybe
teapots
will
take
some
cargoes
