accused
beijing
of
orchestrating
the
hacking
of
government
agencies
and
companies
around
the
world
sentiment
had
turned
sour
on
thursday
when
the
federal
reserve
largely
retained
plans
to
increase
interest
rates
despite
mounting
risks
to
growth
markets
were
further
spooked
when
president
donald
trump
refused
to
sign
legislation
to
fund
the
government
unless
he
got
money
for
a
border
wall
thus
risking

on

political
brinkmanship
in
washington
is
further
heightening

uncertainty
said
westpac
economist
elliot
clarke
friday
will
be
a
tense
day
in
washington
and
for
financial
markets
as
a
compromise
is
adding
to
the
air
of
crisis
was
news
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
had
resigned
after
trump
proposed
withdrawing
troops
from
syria
and
sources
said
a
military
pullback
from
afghanistan
was
on
the
cards
the
brittle
mood
showed
on
wall
street
where
the
dow
ended
thursday
with
a
loss
of
percent
the
s
p
dived
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
mood
change
has
triggered
a
rush
out
of
crowded
trades
including
massive
long
positions
in
equities
and
the
dollar
and
short
positions
in
treasuries
lipper
data
on
thursday
showed
investors
pulled
nearly
billion
out
of
stock
funds
in
the
latest
week
and
were
heading
for
the
biggest
month
of
net
withdrawals
on
record
there
was
also
a
sense
of
capitulation
in
currency
markets
as
the
dollar
dived
percent
on
the
yen
on
thursday
to
hit
a
trough
at
it
was
last
changing
hands
at
having
shattered
several
layers
of
chart
support
the
euro
stood
at
having
jumped
to
its
highest
in
over
six
weeks
at
against
a
basket
of
currencies
the
dollar
stood
at
after
suffering
its
largest
fall
in
two
months
the
flight
from
risk
was
a
boon
to
sovereign
bonds
where
yields
struck
their
lowest
since
early
april
at
percent
as
recently
as
october
they
had
been
at
a
top
of
percent
the
gap
between
and
yields
shrank
to
just
basis
points
at
one
stage
the
kind
of
flattening
that
has
heralded
recessions
in
the
past
the
rally
in
bonds
has
been
fuelled
by
the
huge
slide
in
oil
prices
which
will
pile
downward
pressure
on
inflation
at
a
time
when
the
global
economy
is
already
slowing
both
brent
and
crude
futures
reached
their
lowest
in
more
than
a
year
overnight
but

friday
on

cuts
by

be
larger
than
first
thought
crude

out
a

bounce
to
a
barrel
while
brent
rose
cents
to

was
underpinned
by
the
reversal
in
the
dollar
to
hold
