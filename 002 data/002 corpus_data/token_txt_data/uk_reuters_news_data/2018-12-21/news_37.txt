exclusive-nigerian energy sector's crippling debts delay next power plant

reuters
plans
to
build
another
power
station
in
nigeria
to
help
end
decades
of
chronic
blackouts
have
been
delayed
because
of
concerns
about
persistent
shortfalls
in
payments
for
electricity
across
the
sector
the
billion
qua
iboe
power
plant
being
developed
by
energy
infrastructure
company
black
rhino
and
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
won
t
get
a
green
light
by
the
end
of
as
planned
and
it
was
unclear
when
the
deal
might
close
nnpc
told
reuters
the
delay
is
a
setback
for
africa
s
biggest
oil
producer
where
million
people
don
t
have
access
to
grid
power
supplies
and
it
exposes
the
difficulties
in
attracting
private
investment
to
a
sector
that
successive
governments
have
tried
to
reform
the
uncertainty
surrounding
the
qua
iboe
plant
stems
from
the
difficulties
nigeria
s
first
independent
power
project
the
plant
has
encountered
since
it
came
online
this
year
azura
was
meant
to
be
a
model
for
a
string
of
independent
power
plants
financed
by
international
investors
to
give
them
confidence
to
invest
in
the
first
major
plant
since
the
power
sector
was
privatised
in
the
world
bank
provided
a
safeguard
known
as
a
partial
risk
guarantee
meaning
the
lender
would
step
in
if
nigeria
defaulted
on
payments
under
the
current
system
the
nigerian
bulk
electricity
trading
company
nbet
buys
power
from
generators
and
passes
it
on
to
distributors
who
then
collect
money
from
customers
and
reimburse
nbet
but
because
nbet
is
not
paid
in
full
for
the
power
it
buys
generators
such
as
azura
have
been
partly
reimbursed
from
an
emergency
central
bank
loan
fund
created
to
keep
the
sector
afloat
nnpc
told
reuters
one
of
the
reasons
the
qua
iboe
plant
qipp
which
is
due
to
be
built
in
the
southern
state
of
akwa
ibom
had
been
delayed
was
because
nbet
appeared
reluctant
to
commit
to
new
projects
to
avoid
increasing
its
liabilities
the
continued
delay
relates
to
the
current
cashflow
challenges
at
nbet
as
highlighted
by
the
azura
project
a
spokesman
for
nnpc
said
in
an
emailed
statement
this
concern
is
justified
by
the
fact
that
nbet
is
yet
to
see
an
improvement
in
collections
from
discos
distribution
companies
nbet
did
not
immediately
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
on
nnpc
s
statement
about
qipp
nbet
chief
executive
marilyn
amobi
told
reuters
in
november
that
it
was
hard
for
the
company
to
work
because
of
poor
infrastructure
and
shortfalls
in
cash
from
distributors
needed
to
reimburse
generators
you
don
t
have
the
infrastructure
you
don
t
have
the
financial
position
to
do
it
you
don
t
actually
have
the
products
and
you
don
t
have
the
grid
she
said
nnpc
said
another
problem
for
qipp
was
that
the
world
bank
had
made
a
partial
risk
guarantee
similar
to
the
one
that
helped
azura
attract
investors
contingent
on
the
government
s
implementation
of
an
agreed
power
sector
recovery
plan
in
theory
it
is
okay
but
the
risk
is
there
are
delays
in
the
approvals
which
may
impact
qipp
nnpc
said
power
ministry
officials
and
the
world
bank
have
been
in
talks
about
structural
changes
needed
to
trigger
the
release
of
a
billion
loan
to
help
pay
for
reforms
a
world
bank
spokeswoman
said
the
loan
had
yet
to
be
submitted
to
its
board
for
approval
and
that
the
lender
considered
the
recovery
plan
to
be
critical
for
the
sector
for
private
investments
problems
that
need
to
be
tackled
include
decaying
infrastructure
mounting
debts
low
tariffs
for
electricity
and
a
dilapidated
grid
that
would
collapse
if
all
the
country
s
power
generators
operated
at
full
tilt
even
though
nbet
has
an
agreement
to
buy
gigawatts
gw
from
power
generators
the
system
can
only
cope
with
distributors
sending
out
an
average
of
gw
according
to
the
ministry
of
power
the
world
bank
spokeswoman
confirmed
any
future
guarantees
for
independent
power
plants
ipps
would
be
linked
to
the
plan
s
implementation
because
the
economic
and
financial
viability
of
generation
capacity
expansion
was
at
risk
a
spokeswoman
for
black
rhino
which
is
one
of
private
equity
firm
blackstone
s
portfolio
companies
declined
to
comment
on
nnpc
s
announcement
of
a
delay
to
qipp
when
the
project
was
unveiled
nigerian
cement
giant
dangote
group
was
named
as
a
joint
venture
partner
along
with
black
rhino
and
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
but
a
dangote
executive
told
reuters
on
condition
of
anonymity
that
the
company
owned
by
africa
s
richest
man
aliko
dangote
had
pulled
out
the
huge
debt
level
and
the
fact
the
ipps
are
not
making
profits
is
another
reason
for
prospective
investors
to
be
deterred
he
said
further
collecting
revenue
from
the
distribution
companies
is
also
becoming
a
a
dangote
group
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
the
delay
to
qipp
or
whether
the
company
had
pulled
out
the
payment
problems
in
the
nigerian
power
sector
were
thrust
into
the
spotlight
in
march
when
four
generating
companies
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
government
and
azura
to
ensure
the
generating
companies
were
paid
in
full
throughout
and
the
government
created
a
billion
naira
billion
loan
fund
at
the
central
bank
to
guarantee
payments
when
the
fund
was
established
in
azura
wasn
t
part
of
the
calculations
but
when
azura
started
producing
electricity
the
fund
was
also
used
to
pay
the
new
plant
to
ensure
the
terms
of
loan
deals
guaranteed
by
the
world
bank
were
not
breached
as
a
result
the
other
companies
were
told
they
would
only
receive
percent
of
the
sums
owed
according
to
the
lawsuit
filed
in
march
the
four
energy
companies
want
the
fund
to
reimburse
them
in
full
rather
than
allocating
part
of
the
money
to
the
new
plant
azura
declined
to
comment
on
payments
for
power
generated
if
the
central
bank
wasn
t
paying
the
system
would
collapse
an
official
at
a
multilateral
lender
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
qua
iboe
ipp
would
enter
a
system
that
is
illiquid
and
insolvent
the
liquidity
is
being
provided
by
the
central
the
official
said
qipp
would
need
the
same
partial
risk
guarantee
azura
received
to
get
off
the
ground
but
the
handling
of
payments
to
azura
by
the
nigerian
authorities
so
far
meant
there
was
little
appetite
to
offer
the
same
support
fola
fagbule
senior
vice
president
and
head
of
advisory
at
africa
finance
corporation
afc
one
of
the
multilateral
lenders
that
invested
in
azura
agreed
that
the
qua
iboe
project
would
struggle
without
payment
guarantees
what
you
have
is
an
insolvent
system
he
said
it
is
really
difficult
to
make
a
case
for
a
project
on
that
a
person
with
direct
knowledge
of
qipp
who
declined
to
be
named
said
azura
s
experience
was
damaging
international
investors
view
of
nigeria
africa
s
most
populous
nation
there
has
to
be
some
understanding
of
how
the
sector
is
going
to
be
able
to
afford
new
electrons
coming
into
the
grid
the
person
said
those
involved
do
not
want
qipp
to
build
a
project
that
could
just
end
up
in
a
default
nigeria
s
privatised
power
sector
typically
does
not
use
meters
to
provide
invoices
bill
collections
are
low
and
energy
tariffs
have
remained
fixed
for
three
years
meaning
customers
receive
unsustainably
cheap
electricity
the
effect
say
industry
experts
is
that
electricity
distribution
companies
recover
so
little
revenue
from
customers
that
they
pay
less
than
a
third
of
what
they
owe
to
generating
companies
and
that
s
why
debts
have
ballooned
sunday
oduntan
spokesman
for
the
association
of
nigerian
electricity
distributors
said
debt
levels
in
the
sector
were
caused
by
the
artificial
suppression
of
tariffs
he
said
there
was
a
trillion
naira
billion
market
shortfall
that
meant
distributors
were
unable
to
invest
in
improvements
you
can
not
be
selling
a
product
below
cost
price
and
expect
high
remittance
the
shortfall
in
the
sector
is
because
of
the
lack
of
a
tariff
said
oduntan
who
speaks
on
behalf
of
nigeria
s
electricity
distribution
companies
debts
across
the
sector
partly
stem
from
a
currency
crisis
that
took
hold
in
just
months
after
azura
secured
its
financing
the
bulk
of
power
company
costs
are
in
dollars
but
customers
pay
for
power
in
naira
the
naira
lost
about
percent
of
its
value
against
the
dollar
in
june
but
the
devaluation
was
not
factored
into
a
government
tariff
structure
that
has
remained
unchanged
louis
edozien
permanent
secretary
in
the
ministry
of
power
told
reuters
there
was
evidence
tariffs
must
rise
but
it
was
also
the
responsibility
of
distributors
to
improve
their
collections
partly
through
better
metering
and
infrastructure
as
for
the
future
of
qipp
the
state
oil
company
said
it
would
take
six
to
eight
months
from
whenever
nbet
executes
an
agreement
to
purchase
power
from
the
plant
before
a
final
investment
decision
could
be
taken
the
nnpc
spokesman
said
there
were
a
number
of
other
knotty
issues
including
the
completion
of
a
transmission
line
from
the
project
site
he
said
qipp
had
now
agreed
in
a
major
concession
to
pay
million
for
it
to
be
finished
he
also
said
there
was
a
disagreement
between
qipp
and
the
central
bank
about
the
exchange
rate
at
which
power
producers
could
buy
dollars
with
naira
he
said
this
had
been
escalated
to
the
minister
of
finance
with
the
billion
world
bank
power
sector
loan
on
hold
for
now
the
government
is
considering
putting
another
billion
naira
into
the
central
bank
fund
to
pay
generators
when
the
initial
amount
runs
out
early
next
year
sources
said
it
was
not
clear
how
the
central
bank
loans
to
the
sector
would
be
repaid
central
bank
governor
godwin
emefiele
told
reuters
that
payments
from
the
fund
could
be
made
up
to
february
and
that
the
bank
was
holding
talks
with
world
bank
officials
the
loan
negotiations
are
still
in
progress
with
no
terminal
