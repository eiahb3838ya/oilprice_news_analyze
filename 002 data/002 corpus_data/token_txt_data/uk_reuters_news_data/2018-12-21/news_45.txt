refile-in indonesia, splits emerge over efforts to stem plastic tide
jakarta
reuters
as
indonesia
struggles
with
mountains
of
plastic
waste
going
into
landfill
and
polluting
its
rivers
and
oceans
business
groups
are
pushing
to
overturn
restrictions
on
importing
plastic
scrap
into
southeast
asia
s
biggest
economy
indonesia
an
archipelago
of
more
than
islands
is
estimated
to
be
the
world
s
contributor
of
plastic
pollutants
in
the
oceans
after
china
according
to
a
study
published
in
science
journal
to
tackle
this
the
government
last
year
pledged
up
to
billion
a
year
to
reduce
marine
plastic
debris
by
percent
by
but
emerging
divisions
in
the
government
on
the
issue
of
waste
pose
a
fresh
challenge
to
these
targets
partly
driving
this
rift
is
a
push
by
the
plastics
industry
to
overturn
a
halt
in
scrap
imports
which
was
introduced
in
june
on
concerns
about
a
flood
of
waste
from
western
countries
arriving
after
china
barred
such
imports
industry
minister
airlangga
hartarto
last
month
sent
a
letter
urging
the
environment
ministry
to
lift
its
bar
on
imports
because
indonesia
does
not
currently
produce
enough
suitable
plastic
waste
to
feed
its
recycling
industry
in
the
letter
reviewed
by
reuters
hartarto
argued
indonesia
needs
tonnes
of
imported
scrap
a
year
much
bigger
than
its
usual
tonnes
he
said
the
country
enjoyed
about
a
million
trade
surplus
by
exporting
recycled
plastics
this
is
a
potential
industry
that
creates
a
lot
of
jobs
said
taufiek
bawazier
director
of
downstream
chemical
industry
at
the
industry
ministry
cautioning
that
focusing
only
on
the
environmental
risks
could
harm
the
industry
according
to
the
science
journal
report
almost
half
of
the
million
tonnes
of
plastic
waste
indonesia
produces
in
a
year
ends
up
in
the
sea
the
issue
was
graphically
highlighted
in
november
when
a
sperm
whale
was
found
dead
with
kg
of
plastic
waste
in
its
stomach
on
an
indonesian
beach
but
the
government
s
waste
reduction
targets
are
complicated
by
a
lack
of
recycling
culture
or
awareness
of
environmental
damage
in
the
developing
country
of
million
people
poor
waste
management
means
plastic
trash
that
goes
to
landfills
is
too
dirty
to
feed
indonesia
s
recycling
industry
bawazier
said
adding
that
business
would
take
more
than
the
annual
million
tonnes
of
local
scrap
if
it
was
available
plastics
lobby
groups
say
downstream
to
upstream
plastic
industries
employ
directly
while
millions
make
a
livelihood
by
scavenging
for
waste
like
plastic
bottles
for
a
small
bit
of
cash
we
must
not
hate
plastic
said
christine
halim
chairwoman
of
indonesia
s
recycling
association
noting
that
buying
foreign
scrap
was
much
cheaper
than
making
products
with
virgin
plastic
and
as
long
as
the
environment
was
protected
should
be
seen
as
a
business
opportunity
safri
burhanuddin
deputy
coordinating
minister
of
maritime
affairs
which
overseas
the
environment
ministry
said
there
were
no
plans
to
reopen
scrap
imports
nonetheless
the
industry
ministry
argues
there
is
no
legal
basis
to
stop
imports
while
the
plastic
industry
has
successfully
lobbied
policymakers
before
a
plan
to
slap
excise
on
all
plastic
packaging
was
watered
down
to
only
apply
to
plastic
bags
and
even
this
has
not
been
implemented
yet
the
industry
is
currently
also
fighting
a
ban
on
plastic
bags
in
supermarkets
by
some
city
governments
the
indonesia
olefin
aromatic
and
plastic
industry
association
was
cited
in
media
saying
the
move
had
led
to
an
oversupply
of
bags
burhanuddin
of
the
maritime
affairs
ministry
however
applauded
local
action
on
waste
management
pledging
to
award
the
best
regional
performers
and
shame
laggards
on
social
media
tiza
mafira
director
of
the
indonesia
plastic
bags
diet
movement
a
group
pushing
to
cut
use
of
plastic
said
it
was
a
ridiculous
idea
to
import
waste
it
is
proven
that
we
can
not
handle
plastic
trash
it
will
end
up
in
the
landfill
