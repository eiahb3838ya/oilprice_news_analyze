cpc
s
company
statement
on
saturday
did
not
provide
a
monetary
figure
for
the
deal
most
importantly
it
helps
to
further
achieve
the
diversification
of
lng
sources
and
stability
of
energy
supply
into
the
taiwan
market
that
are
among
cpc
s
key
objectives
cpc
chairman
tai
chein
said
in
a
statement
on
saturday
chein
said
that
lng
buyers
see
qatar
australia
and
the
united
states
as
leading
suppliers
in
the
future
cpc
has
already
been
importing
substantial
volumes
from
qatar
and
australia
the
deal
is
also
viewed
as
an
important
part
of
taiwan
s
efforts
to
reduce
its
trade
surplus
with
the
united
states
according
to
a
source
familiar
with
the
government
s
thinking
the
contract
is
a
significant
boost
to
taiwan
s
trade
relations
with
the
united
states
particularly
given
the
trump
administration
s
focus
on
trade
with
asia
the
source
said
the
united
states
has
become
a
major
lng
exporter
in
the
last
two
years
mostly
due
to
the
ramp
up
of
cheniere
s
sabine
pass
terminal
in
louisiana
the
company
is
also
building
the
corpus
christi
terminal
in
texas
the
cpc
deal
which
is
through
cheniere
s
marketing
arm
is
not
tied
to
a
particular
project
or
liquefaction
train
cheniere
said
the
agreement
ties
up
a
portion
of
its
portfolio
volume
on
a
basis
with
a
investment
grade
counterparty
the
company
also
retains
the
ability
to
use
those
volumes
to
support
a
future
train
or
expansion
project
cheniere
announced
in
may
that
it
was
moving
ahead
with
a
third
liquefaction
train
at
its
corpus
christi
project
it
is
currently
marketing
its
sixth
train
at
sabine
pass
with
an
investment
decision
expected
next
year
taiwan
is
the
world
s
fifth
biggest
importer
of
lng
shipping
in
almost
million
tonnes
in
according
to
the
international
gas
union
giving
the
island
a
global
import
market
share
of
almost
percent
the
deal
comes
just
a
day
before
taiwan
president
tsai
embarks
on
an
overseas
trip
to
visit
diplomatic
allies
via
transit
stops
in
the
united
states
which
will
be
in
los
angeles
and
houston
where
many
taiwan
businesspeople
work
in
the
energy
sector
