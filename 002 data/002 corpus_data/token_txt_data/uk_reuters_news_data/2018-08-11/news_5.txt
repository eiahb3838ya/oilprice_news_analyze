china
s
business
and
energy
ties
with
iran
do
not
harm
the
interests
of
any
other
country
the
country
s
foreign
ministry
said
after
president
donald
trump
said
companies
doing
business
with
iran
would
be
barred
from
the
united
states
china
has
already
defended
its
commercial
relations
with
iran
as
open
and
transparent
as
sanctions
on
iran
took
effect
despite
pleas
from
washington
s
allies
in
a
statement
released
late
on
friday
china
s
foreign
ministry
reiterated
its
opposition
to
unilateral
sanctions
and
jurisdiction
for
a
long
time
china
and
iran
have
had
open
transparent
and
normal
commercial
cooperation
in
the
fields
of
business
trade
and
energy
which
is
reasonable
fair
and
lawful
it
said
this
does
not
violate
united
nations
security
council
resolutions
or
china
s
promised
international
obligations
nor
does
it
harm
the
interests
of
any
other
country
and
should
be
respected
and
protected
the
ministry
added
using
sanctions
at
the
slightest
pretext
or
to
threaten
anyone
won
t
resolve
the
problem
it
said
only
dialogue
and
negotiations
are
the
true
path
to
resolving
the
issue
the
ministry
added
china
iran
s
top
oil
customer
buys
roughly
barrels
a
day
of
crude
oil
from
tehran
or
percent
of
china
s
total
crude
oil
imports
at
current
market
rates
the
imports
are
worth
some
billion
a
year
state
energy
firms
cnpc
and
sinopec
have
invested
billions
of
dollars
in
key
iranian
oil
fields
such
as
yadavaran
and
north
azadegan
and
have
been
sending
oil
to
china
european
countries
hoping
to
persuade
tehran
to
continue
to
respect
the
nuclear
deal
have
promised
to
try
to
lessen
the
blow
of
sanctions
and
to
urge
their
firms
not
to
pull
out
but
that
has
proven
difficult
and
european
companies
have
quit
iran
arguing
that
they
can
not
risk
their
business
few
american
companies
do
much
business
in
iran
so
the
impact
of
sanctions
mainly
stems
from
washington
s
ability
to
block
european
and
asian
firms
from
trading
there
