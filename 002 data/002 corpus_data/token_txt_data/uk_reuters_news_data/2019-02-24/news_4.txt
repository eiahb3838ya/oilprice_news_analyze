nicholas
voted
for
muhammadu
buhari
in
nigeria
s
presidential
election
but
the
factory
worker
in
the
northern
city
of
kano
was
casting
his
ballot
on
saturday
for
the
president
s
challenger
atiku
abubakar
most
of
the
workers
can
not
feed
their
families
nicholas
said
as
he
queued
in
a
dusty
schoolyard
to
vote
people
are
suffering
he
said
there
is
no
if
buhari
is
turfed
out
of
office
when
the
results
are
tallied
this
week
a
major
cause
is
likely
to
be
defections
by
voters
in
the
northwest
once
buhari
s
most
important
electoral
stronghold
where
anger
over
a
feeble
economy
and
disaffection
from
local
bigwigs
has
loosened
his
grip
a
quarter
of
nigeria
s
nearly
million
eligible
voters
are
in
the
northwest
the
country
s
most
region
buhari
received
nearly
percent
of
kano
state
s
vote
in
running
up
a
million
vote
edge
that
accounted
for
more
than
half
of
his
final
margin
of
victory
over
goodluck
jonathan
but
he
faces
stiffer
headwinds
this
time
around
many
voters
are
dissatisfied
with
an
economy
still
sputtering
after
a
recession
and
his
main
opponent
atiku
is
also
a
northern
muslim
rather
than
a
southern
christian
like
jonathan
atiku
stands
to
benefit
from
the
support
of
influential
local
powerbrokers
who
have
rallied
behind
the
opposition
candidate
after
falling
out
with
buhari
and
his
allies
the
most
important
among
them
rabiu
kwankwaso
is
a
senator
governor
of
kano
state
and
godfather
a
term
for
local
nigerian
kingmakers
who
draw
their
influence
from
elaborate
patronage
networks
the
kwankwaso
has
a
loyal
core
of
supporters
known
as
kwankwasiyya
who
are
readily
identifiable
by
their
woven
red
caps
he
quit
buhari
s
ruling
all
progressives
congress
apc
last
year
amid
a
wave
of
defections
to
the
opposition
people
s
democratic
party
pdp
in
a
sign
of
kano
s
newfound
battleground
status
kwankwasiyya
members
on
their
way
to
a
rally
outside
kano
city
clashed
with
apc
members
on
thursday
leading
to
several
injuries
and
torched
vehicles
each
side
blamed
the
other
pdp
officials
say
atiku
could
net
as
much
as
or
even
percent
of
the
vote
in
kano
state
apc
supporters
dismiss
that
although
they
concede
that
atiku
will
make
some
inroads
it
will
not
be
like
what
happened
in
said
baballe
hayatu
an
actor
in
the
local
film
industry
who
was
waiting
to
vote
for
buhari
there
was
this
security
challenge
so
everyone
was
desperate
in
he
said
referring
to
surging
violence
by
militant
group
boko
haram
at
the
time
that
fed
widespread
rejection
of
jonathan
but
even
if
his
four
years
in
office
have
taken
some
of
the
lustre
off
buhari
he
remains
popular
in
kano
perceived
by
many
as
an
incorruptible
foe
of
the
rampant
graft
that
has
plagued
nigerian
politics
for
decades
he
s
an
honest
man
he
s
a
correct
leader
