as
pakistan
faces
worsening
water
scarcity
and
trouble
sourcing
international
cash
for
hydropower
dams
it
says
it
needs
it
has
turned
to
an
unlikely
source
of
cash
a
fundraising
campaign
backed
by
the
country
s
top
court
judges
last
year
mian
saqib
nisar
then
the
country
s
chief
supreme
court
judge
donated
a
million
pakistani
rupees
of
his
own
money
to
start
the
drive
calling
water
shortages
a
major
national
threat
the
drive
aims
to
raise
as
much
as
a
staggering
billion
toward
the
cost
of
installing
water
reservoirs
and
other
equipment
for
two
major
dams
nisar
retired
in
january
from
the
court
but
the
current
panel
of
top
judges
have
taken
over
the
push
some
politicians
from
government
opposition
parties
have
dismissed
the
effort
calling
it
inappropriate
and
doomed
to
fail
building
dams
is
not
the
responsibility
of
the
court
said
bilawal
bhutto
zardari
chairman
of
party
pakistan
peoples
party
but
efforts
to
solicit
donations
from
as
far
away
as
the
united
states
and
britain
largely
from
expatriate
pakistanis
have
raised
million
as
of
toward
the
chief
justice
dam
fund
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
pakistan
s
website
the
country
s
prime
minister
imran
khan
backs
the
effort
water
scarcity
has
been
pakistan
s
number
one
issue
and
the
country
may
face
shortages
by
if
dams
are
not
built
khan
warned
in
a
state
television
address
last
september
he
has
urged
pakistanis
living
overseas
to
donate
generously
to
the
effort
comparing
the
battle
to
combat
water
scarcity
to
a
holy
war
pakistanis
do
take
part
in
this
jihad
the
prime
minister
urged
nisar
has
said
he
took
up
pakistan
s
water
worries
as
a
personal
campaign
after
syed
mehar
ali
commissioner
of
the
country
s
indus
water
treaty
testified
in
a
court
hearing
last
july
about
worsening
water
scarcity
risks
in
the
country
ali
told
the
court
that
the
country
s
three
western
rivers
the
indus
jhelum
and
chenab
carry
nearly
million
acre
feet
maf
of
water
but
the
country
has
water
storage
capacity
for
less
than
maf
much
of
the
water
flowing
down
the
river
ends
up
in
irrigation
channels
but
at
least
maf
simply
flows
to
sea
he
said
pakistan
needs
to
store
maf
of
water
each
year
to
help
shore
up
water
security
the
commissioner
said
and
that
would
require
a
series
of
new
large
dams
he
said
but
building
them
has
proved
difficult
an
effort
to
construct
a
hydropower
dam
in
gilgit
baltistan
a
kashmir
border
region
disputed
with
india
for
instance
has
had
trouble
attracting
multinational
funding
the
proposed
diamer
basha
also
has
proved
controversial
within
the
country
facing
opposition
from
some
environmental
and
farmer
groups
development
experts
as
well
say
charity
won
t
be
enough
to
build
the
volume
of
dams
pakistan
needs
sardar
riaz
ahmed
khan
a
former
development
secretary
in
kashmir
said
donations
can
give
citizens
a
sense
of
ownership
in
solving
the
water
crisis
but
it
s
useless
to
say
that
dams
will
be
built
by
contribution
muzammal
hussain
chairman
of
pakista
s
water
and
power
development
authority
wapda
however
has
said
work
on
the
daimer
basha
dam
which
could
store
more
than
maf
of
water
and
generate
clean
electricity
will
begin
in
may
initial
work
on
a
second
less
controversial
dam
the
mohmand
on
the
swat
river
near
peshawar
started
last
month
pakistan
s
government
has
provided
funding
for
acquisition
of
land
for
both
projects
dozens
of
farmers
from
sindh
province
marched
to
karachi
last
october
to
protest
construction
of
the
diamer
basha
dam
on
the
indus
river
a
leading
organisation
of
fishermen
also
has
objected
to
the
dam
saying
it
will
hurt
their
business
salman
shah
a
former
pakistani
finace
minister
said
in
a
televised
interview
that
completing
the
diamer
basha
dam
could
take
more
than
years
as
the
dam
site
is
mountainous
and
falls
in
an
earthquake
risk
zone
necessitating
strong
and
extra
stable
construction
but
he
believes
that
if
the
water
storage
dam
can
be
built
international
investors
will
come
in
to
provide
the
infrastructure
for
power
generation
from
the
dam
energy
generation
is
a
good
source
in
pakistan
