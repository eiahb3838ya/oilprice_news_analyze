s
departure
was
making
it
harder

its
sunderland
factory
in

the
continued

ficchy
britain
s
business
minister
greg
clark

was
a
blow
to
the

leave
the
european
union
on

she
would
seek
a
pragmatic
solution
in
a
letter
to
workers
de
ficchy
said
nissan
has
a
task
force
that
reports
to
him
and
is
considering
all
of
the
possible
scenarios

the
potential
impact
on
the
nissan
builds
roughly
percent
of
the
country
s
million
cars
and

the
vast
majority
to
the

said
four
months
after

voted
to
leave
the
eu
in
june
that
it
would
manufacture
the
new
in
britain
a
major
vote
of
confidence
in
the
country
and
may
shortly
after
she
took
office
a
source
told
reuters
at
the
time
that
nissan
received
a
letter
from
the
government
promising
extra
support
in
the
event
that
brexit
hit
the
competitiveness
of
the
sunderland
plant
according
to
the
sunday
times
newspaper
ministers
are
now
considering
whether
to
withdraw
a
million
pounds
million
package
of
support
for
the
company
this
kind
of
support
package
to
help
in
areas
such
as
training
and
skills
is
typical
across
the
industry
clearly
we
will
be
reviewing
it
in
the
light
of
this
decision
a
government
source
told
the
newspaper
the
new
could
have
created
hundreds
of
jobs
the
carmaker
s
planned
investment
in
the
juke
and
qashqai
models
which
was
also
announced
in
was
unaffected
nissan
said
on
sunday
the
announcement
came
just
two
days
after
an
free
trade
agreement
kicked
in
which
includes
the
european
union
s
commitment
to
removing
tariffs
of
percent
on
imported
japanese
cars
many
japanese
companies
had
long
seen
britain
as
the
gateway
to
europe
after
being
encouraged
to
open
factories
in
the
country
by
former
prime
minister
margaret
thatcher
brexit
has
thrown
that
into
doubt
prompting
consternation
in
tokyo
sunday
s
announcement
also
came
as
the
carmaker
continues
to
deal
with
the
fallout
from
the
arrest
of
its
former
boss
carlos
ghosn
which
has
clouded
the
outlook
for
the
automaking
