saudi
arabia
has
held
preliminary
discussions
with
foreign
firms
about
manufacturing
buses
domestically
and
plans
to
convert
part
of
its
highway
system
into
toll
roads
to
help
make
its
transport
system
more
efficient
the
transport
minister
said
we
are
developing
the
public
transport
system
with
a
lot
of
buses
so
we
want
to
see
how
we
can
leverage
this
to
develop
domestic
industry
nabeel
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
a
business
conference
in
jeddah
on
sunday
he
declined
to
name
the
companies
with
which
saudi
arabia
had
been
talking
the
kingdom
which
does
not
have
a
significant
auto
manufacturing
industry
is
spending
billions
of
dollars
to
expand
public
transport
systems
in
the
capital
riyadh
and
other
big
cities
and
has
imported
thousands
of
buses
in
the
last
few
years
last
may
german
vehicle
maker
daimler
received
an
order
from
riyadh
for
citaro
buses
the
largest
order
for
the
vehicles
in
the
history
of
its
bus
division
china
yuchai
international
last
month
announced
the
delivery
of
buses
to
saudi
arabia
producing
the
vehicles
locally
would
allow
saudi
arabia
to
save
on
import
costs
while
creating
jobs
and
expanding
domestic
industry
key
goals
of
an
economic
reform
programme
designed
to
reduce
the
economy
s
dependence
on
oil
exports
amudi
said
the
potential
bus
project
was
separate
from
a
memorandum
of
understanding
signed
by
toyota
motor
corp
in
march
last
year
to
conduct
a
feasibility
study
on
producing
vehicles
and
parts
in
saudi
arabia
the
reform
programme
features
plans
to
have
the
private
sector
operate
much
of
the
kingdom
s
transport
infrastructure
including
airports
and
sea
ports
with
the
government
keeping
a
role
as
regulator
amudi
said
that
approach
would
be
extended
to
the
highway
network
the
government
hopes
to
establish
between
four
and
six
toll
roads
which
private
companies
would
operate
in
exchange
for
fees
although
this
may
be
difficult
because
of
the
need
to
give
road
users
the
option
of
taking
a
route
in
each
case
amudi
said
draft
plans
for
this
project
may
be
ready
in
six
months
