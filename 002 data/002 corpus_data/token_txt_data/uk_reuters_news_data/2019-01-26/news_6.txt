the

proposals
will
serve
as
the
basis
for
turning

and
means
several
power
stations

close
earlier
than

the
commission
recommends
a

the

too
soon
urging

to
consider
extending

during
a
review
in

are
obliged
to
protect
the
interests
of
our
employees
as
well
as
our

the
report
by

said
if
there
are

avoiding
forced

as
well
as
unfair
social

never
enter

in
light
of
the
enormous

obligations
related
to

this
requires
substantial
talks
including
with

is
central
to
