however
he
still
has
no
control
over
the
venezuelan
state
and
the
military
which
has
so
far
remained
loyal
to
maduro

deep
economic
and

has
said
it
would
not
take
sides
mexican
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
said
on
friday
his
administration
would
be
willing
to
mediate
guaido
said
he
would
reject
any
negotiations
that
did
not
include
maduro
s
exit
the
setting
up
of
a
transition
government
and
free
elections
to
pick
a
new
president
no
one
wants
fake
dialogue
the
only
thing
we
want
to
negotiate
is
the
end
of
the
usurpation
he
told
a
crowd
clustered
in
a
plaza
in
caracas
chacao
district
an
opposition
stronghold
to
ratchet
up
pressure
on
maduro
who
began
a
second
term
on
following
an
election
last
year
widely
considered
to
be
a
fraud
the
united
states
is
seeking
to
cut
off
funds
for
his
government
and
is
considering
introducing
fresh
sanctions
including
on
its
vital
oil
sector
maduro
warned
off
any
attempt
to
take
control
of
refiner
citgo
the
country
s
primary
offshore
asset
it
is
the
property
of
the
venezuelan
people
and
we
will
defend
it
he
said
the
board
of
citgo
is
preparing
a
legal
strategy
to
defend
itself
against
any
attempts
to
divert
its
funds
or
change
its
board
sources
said
oil
prices
edged
higher
on
friday
as
the
political
turmoil
in
the
opec
member
threatened
to
tighten
the
global
supply
of
crude
the
has
until
now
resisted
significant
oil
sanctions
because
of
the
impact
it
would
have
on
venezuelan
citizens
already
struggling
with
shortages
the
oil
situation
has
been
an
ethical
moral
dilemma
for
us
said
senator
richard
durbin
the
democrat
in
the
senate
in
an
interview
cutting
off
all
trade
in
oil
would
be
the
last
step
it
would
make
it
even
worse
for
the
average
the
trump
administration
is
trying
to
make
sure
that
any
measures
to
restrict
oil
revenues
to
maduro
do
not
cause
spikes
in
prices
that
would
be
felt
by
consumers
said
scott
modell
managing
director
of
rapidan
energy
group
who
advises
energy
clients
on
geopolitical
risks
how
do
they
allow
venezuelan
oil
to
continue
to
flow
while
cutting
off
the
flow
of
money
back
to
maduro
and
the
government
that
s
the
general
playbook
they
have
been
using
for
iran
and
the
one
they
are
trying
to
adapt
to
venezuela
now
