authorities
and
private

had
not
learned
anything
from
the

near
the
city
of
mariana
and
called
it
unacceptable
operations
at
samarco
remain
halted
over
new
licensing
while
the

have
worked
to
pay

out
of
court
including
an
agreement
that
quashed
a
billion
reais
billion
civil
lawsuit
last
year
federal
prosecutors
suspended
but
have
still
not
closed
an
even
larger
lawsuit
three
years
after
the
serious
environmental
crime
in
mariana
with
investigations
still
ongoing
and
no
one
punished
history
repeats
itself
as
tragedy
in
brumadinho
silva
said
on
twitter
iron
ore
prices
are
likely
to
rise
in
the
wake
of
the
disaster
as
there
may
be
less
supply
on
the
market
for
the
short
term
said
chris
lafemina
a
jefferies
mining
industry
analyst
that
could
boost
the
share
price
of
rivals
rio
tinto
plc
and
anglo
american
plc
while
weighing
on
vale
he
said
shares
of
vale
closed
percent
lower
on
friday
while
we
hope
the
reports
of
fatalities
are
inaccurate
we
do
believe
this
is
a
material
negative
for
vale
lafemina
said
the
full
extent
of
the
damage
and
the
potential
impact
on
