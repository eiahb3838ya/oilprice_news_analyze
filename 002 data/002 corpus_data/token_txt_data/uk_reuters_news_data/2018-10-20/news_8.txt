trump administration wants phase-in of un rules on maritime fuel
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
wants
pollution
limits
on
ship
fuels
that
a
united
nations
maritime
agency
will
implement
in
to
be
phased
in
to
protect
consumers
from
any
price
spikes
in
heating
and
trucking
fuels
a
white
house
spokesman
said
on
friday
under
the
international
maritime
organization
rule
ships
can
not
use
fuels
with
more
than
percent
of
sulfur
compared
with
percent
now
unless
equipped
with
scrubbers
limiting
the
emissions
the
rule
will
be
enforced
through
fines
levied
by
imo
member
states
the
imo
said
last
month
it
would
not
delay
implementation
after
some
shipping
groups
as
well
as
the
bahamas
panama
liberia
and
the
marshall
islands
supported
a
implementation
of
the
rules
if
refiners
are
unprepared
for
the
changes
some
analysts
have
said
prices
for
related
fuels
such
as
diesel
and
heating
oil
could
rise
a
spike
in
fuel
prices
ahead
of
the
elections
would
be
a
political
risk
for
trump
the
united
states
supports
an
experience
building
phase
which
has
been
proposed
by
several
other
countries
in
imo
in
order
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
precipitous
fuel
cost
increases
on
consumers
the
white
house
spokesman
said
the
administration
was
not
seeking
a
delay
of
the
rules
the
spokesman
said
a
would
mean
that
the
rule
would
not
have
to
be
fully
complied
with
until
a
later
unspecified
date
jason
bordoff
founding
director
of
columbia
university
s
center
on
global
energy
policy
and
a
former
white
house
adviser
on
energy
to
former
president
barack
obama
indicated
that
a
would
be
unnecessary
reducing
emissions
from
ships
brings
huge
health
benefits
and
the
industry
has
known
about
the
upcoming
rules
for
years
bordoff
tweeted
many
refineries
and
shippers
have
already
spent
billions
of
dollars
on
preparing
for
cleaner
fuel
and
the
rules
already
have
opportunities
for
waivers
he
added
the
administration
wants
to
ensure
that
imo
occurs
in
a
manner
that
is
not
harmful
to
consumers
and
the
global
economy
the
white
house
spokesman
said
his
comments
were
first
reported
by
the
wall
street
journal
analysts
at
energy
aspects
were
skeptical
the
trump
administration
could
change
the
process
given
that
the
imo
rulemaking
process
takes
nearly
two
years
to
run
its
course
it
is
unclear
how
any
proposed
phased
implementation
could
be
accomplished
at
an
international
level
