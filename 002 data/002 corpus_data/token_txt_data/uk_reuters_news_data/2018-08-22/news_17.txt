canada
s
province
of
alberta
is
looking
to
recreate
the
building
boom
spreading
along
the
gulf
coast
where
inexpensive
natural
gas
generated
billions
of
dollars
in
investment
by
petrochemical
companies
the
adoption
by
drillers
of
fracking
technology
to
unlock
oil
and
gas
from
shale

expanded
production
dramatically
starting
a
decade
ago
that
abundance
has
generated
billion

in
announced
capital
investment
to
build
or
expand
chemical
plants
that
use
gas
to
make
plastics

and
fuel
according
to
the
american
chemistry
council
alberta
hopes
to
do
the
same
thing
turning
prices
that
are
about
those
at
the
gulf
coast
into
a
competitive
advantage
to
attract
petrochemical
companies
such
investment
would
provide
a
badly
needed
market
for
oil
and
gas
within
the
landlocked
province
where
energy
companies
struggle
to
reach
buyers
farther
away

in
an
interview
as
attractive
as
cheap

is
skeptics
say
alberta
s
incentives
fall
short
of
those
in
the
gulf
and
the
province
also
has
the
disadvantages
of
higher
costs
and
inadequate
infrastructure
but
companies
are
chasing
opportunities

chief

chuck

said
he
expects
the
abundance
of
cheap

to
persist
even
if
the

terminal
for
liquified

is
built
in
coming
years
creating
a
new

outlet
our
analysis
is
you
would
need
to
build
several
lng
terminals
before
we
would
see
much
higher
gas
prices

much
of
the

it
used

been
displaced
by
expanding

an

up

a
