small
to
renewable
energy
companies
in
india
are
starting
to
look
like
attractive
takeover
targets
as
lenders
and
investors
withhold
funds
worried
by
the
stiff
competition
weak
bond
markets
low
tariffs
and
high
debt
besetting
the
sector
the
small
companies
difficulty
in
raising
cash
is
keeping
them
away
from
government
power
project
auctions
restricting
their
growth
and
crippling
their
ability
to
refinance
loans
said
a
consultant
from
a
top
global
consultancy
firm
with
many
smaller
operators
being
gobbled
up
or
offering
themselves
for
sale
the
number
of
projects
being
developed
could
fall
potentially
keeping
india
from
its
renewable
energy
targets
said
the
consultant
who
did
not
wish
to
be
named
as
he
is
directly
involved
with
a
company
that
cancelled
a
bond
issue
india
s
solar
industry
is
becoming
a
big
boys
club
said
rahul
goswami
managing
director
of
greenstone
energy
advisors
in
a
few
years
there
may
be
only
a
few
big
companies
and
a
few
regional
firms
active
in
india
s
renewable
sector
he
said
the
trend
goes
back
at
least
to
when
tata
power
bought
solar
and
wind
company
welspun
renewable
energy
but
the
pace
is
expected
to
pick
up
smaller
players
are
being
squeezed
out
due
to
two
main
factors
cost
of
equipment
and
financing
said
alok
verma
executive
director
at
kotak
investment
banking
an
arm
of
kotak
mahindra
bank
one
of
india
s
largest
renewables
companies
greenko
group
said
in
june
that
it
was
buying
megawatts
mws
of
solar
and
wind
assets
from
orange
renewables
because
the
company
saw
few
opportunities
for
growth
the
deal
has
yet
to
be
closed
essel
infra
with
a
renewable
power
capacity
of
mws
and
shapoorji
pallonji
group
s
solar
arm
are
also
in
talks
to
sell
off
their
assets
one
firm
and
two
banks
doing
the
due
diligence
for
these
companies
have
said
besides
loans
other
funding
options
have
also
been
dead
ends
for
the
smaller
companies
further
limiting
growth
opportunities
acme
solar
postponed
an
initial
public
offering
ipo
announced
in
september
last
year
as
the
proposed
share
issue
did
not
generate
enough
interest
from
investors
confirmed
a
banker
who
was
directly
involved
in
the
listing
attempt
mytrah
energy
a
major
renewables
company
called
off
a
million
to
million
bond
issue
earlier
this
year
as
that
option
also
went
dry
for
the
sector
and
it
canned
ipo
plans
as
well
said
a
separate
banker
directly
involved
there
the
companies
have
all
declined
to
comment
this
dearth
of
financing
and
trend
towards
consolidation
could
be
a
significant
threat
to
india
s
target
of
gigawatts
gws
of
renewables
capacity
by
up
from
gws
now
some
analysts
said
others
said
a
concentration
of
bigger
players
with
more
cash
and
better
financing
could
mean
things
move
faster
consolidation
in
the
renewable
energy
industry
augurs
well
for
the
overall
success
of
the
programme
large
players
have
access
to
required
capital
at
reasonable
rates
and
can
procure
the
latest
technology
said
debasish
mishra
head
of
energy
resources
and
industrials
at
deloitte
touche
tohmatsu
india
tata
power
one
of
india
s
largest
power
generators
said
in
may
it
plans
to
invest
billion
to
increase
its
renewable
capacity
in
india
fourfold
over
the
next
decade
to
gws
more
than
doubling
india
s
renewables
capacity
by
will
require
billion
including
debt
of
billion
the
ministry
of
new
and
renewable
energy
said
in
july
another
problem
in
india
s
renewable
sector
is
debt
many
firms
have
taken
debt
to
fund
their
equity
the
partner
of
an
investment
firm
said
adding
that
many
such
companies
will
need
financial
restructuring
or
have
to
put
themselves
up
for
auction
this
model
of
financing
debt
through
equity
is
called
mezzanine
financing
and
tends
to
involve
high
interest
rates
and
an
option
to
convert
debt
to
equity
in
future
both
acme
and
mytrah
are
funded
by
piramal
finance
ltd
via
mezzanine
financing
according
to
statements
by
the
companies
at
the
time
of
funding
for
lending
banks
this
is
seen
as
debt
making
the
liabilities
of
these
companies
look
higher
than
usual
said
the
partner
who
asked
not
to
be
named
the
investment
firm
handles
all
kinds
of
financing
including
mezzanine
when
companies
with
mezzanine
financing
go
to
banks
for
funds
for
upcoming
projects
banks
ask
them
for
higher
collateral
or
offer
less
cash
in
loan
said
kotak
s
verma
fitch
solutions
said
in
a
note
last
week
that
india
would
likely
miss
its
renewable
capacity
targets
due
to
risks
stemming
from
bureaucratic
financing
and
logistical
