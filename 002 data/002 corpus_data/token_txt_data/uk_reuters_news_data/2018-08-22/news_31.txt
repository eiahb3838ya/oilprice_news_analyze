imagine
a
country
that
is
one
the
world
s
largest
exporters
of
energy
but
can
t
agree
on
a
domestic
policy
to
end
electricity
blackouts
imagine
a
country
on
the
verge
of
losing
a
fourth
prime
minister
within
a
decade
to
internal
party
squabbles
mainly
over
energy
policy
imagine
a
country
that
is
likely
to
start
importing
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
even
though
it
is
about
to
become
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
the
fuel
the
problem
for
australia
is
that
this
isn
t
something
being
imagined
it
s
the
reality
of
a
country
that
can
t
find
political
and
social
consensus
on
climate
politics
and
the
role
of
its
vast
reserves
of
coal
natural
gas
and
even
uranium
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
narrowly
survived
a
vote
this
week
for
the
leadership
of
his
liberal
party
held
by
the
party
s
parliamentarians
amid
over
his
signature
energy
policy
known
as
the
national
energy
guarantee
neg
turnbull
whose
liberals
and
junior
coalition
partner
national
party
hold
a
narrow
majority
in
the
country
s
lower
house
of
parliament
had
hoped
to
use
the
neg
as
the
platform
to
end
policy
uncertainty
over
power
generation
and
ensure
that
australia
met
its
obligations
under
the
paris
accord
on
climate
change
the
problem
for
turnbull
is
that
a
significant
number
of
his
are
either
climate
change
deniers
or
sceptics
or
strong
promoters
of
the
coal
industry
this
group
already
forced
turnbull
to
scrap
the
part
of
neg
which
would
have
legislated
emissions
reduction
targets
effectively
neutering
a
large
part
of
the
proposed
policy
while
turnbull
survived
the
vote
most
political
pundits
believe
it
s
now
only
a
matter
of
time
before
his
rival
peter
dutton
gathers
enough
support
to
topple
him
and
claim
the
prime
ministership
dutton
who
quit
as
home
affairs
minister
after
losing
the
internal
vote
was
once
caught
unaware
on
tape
joking
about
climate
change
swamping
australia
s
pacific
island
neighbours
through
rising
seas
turnbull
appears
set
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
former
labor
party
prime
ministers
kevin
rudd
and
julia
gillard
and
his
liberal
predecessor
tony
abbott
in
being
knifed
by
their
own
parties
rudd
who
won
a
landslide
victory
in
was
dumped
in
by
gillard
with
part
of
the
reason
being
his
decision
to
abandon
a
planned
emissions
cap
and
trade
system
gillard
was
then
toppled
by
rudd
in
partly
because
of
public
anger
at
rising
electricity
prices
which
then
liberal
leader
abbott
managed
to
link
to
the
price
on
carbon
her
government
introduced
abbott
won
a
general
election
over
the
resurrected
rudd
in
before
losing
the
prime
ministership
to
turnbull
in
mainly
because
of
his
rising
unpopularity
following
a
harsh
budget
that
was
viewed
as
unfairly
targeting
those
less
well
off
while
abbott
may
not
have
been
axed
because
of
his
energy
policy
there
is
little
doubt
that
his
plan
to
reduce
emissions
by
paying
polluters
not
to
pollute
as
much
was
largely
an
expensive
farce
the
upshot
is
that
australia
s
energy
policy
has
been
a
mess
for
the
last
years
at
a
time
when
retail
electricity
prices
have
more
than
doubled
and
the
country
has
experienced
widescale
blackouts
in
the
wake
of
the
closure
of
several
old
power
plants
with
the
neg
all
but
dead
and
buried
it
seems
that
a
comprehensive
energy
policy
will
not
be
delivered
any
time
soon
under
australia
s
federal
system
this
means
the
six
state
and
two
territory
governments
will
largely
be
responsible
for
their
own
energy
policies
however
there
are
a
few
things
that
are
probably
clear
for
the
future
of
energy
policy
the
first
is
that
its
highly
unlikely
a
new
power
plants
will
ever
be
built
in
australia
despite
the
country
being
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
the
polluting
fuel
and
its
role
in
providing
more
than
percent
of
current
power
generation
no
major
utility
has
any
interest
in
investing
billions
of
dollars
into
a
coal
plant
especially
given
policy
uncertainty
and
the
certainty
of
public
opposition
and
protests
to
such
a
move
this
leaves
state
governments
as
the
only
players
likely
to
build
generators
and
while
it
is
possible
they
may
seek
to
extend
the
life
of
some
existing
plants
they
too
would
be
wary
of
investing
in
a
fuel
that
takes
the
blame
for
much
of
the
current
concern
over
climate
change
natural
gas
also
presents
problems
given
the
difficulty
in
getting
the
fuel
from
where
it
is
produced
mainly
northern
and
central
australia
to
where
it
is
needed
mainly
the
southeast
the
last
of
eight
projects
is
due
to
start
this
year
which
will
make
australia
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
the
fuel
however
the
rapid
scaling
up
of
lng
exporters
has
also
meant
that
domestic
gas
prices
have
risen
to
reflect
international
lng
prices
and
local
consumers
are
struggling
to
secure
supplies
under
contracts
this
has
raised
the
possibility
of
lng
imports
to
cities
like
melbourne
australia
s
and
home
to
much
of
the
country
s
manufacturing
base
what
initially
seemed
like
a
fix
may
end
up
being
a
structural
feature
of
the
lng
market
in
which
australia
ships
lng
to
asia
but
buys
from
other
countries
to
meet
its
domestic
needs
the
other
thing
that
appears
virtually
certain
is
that
the
main
investment
in
electricity
generation
in
australia
is
going
to
be
in
the
form
of
renewables
both
and
small
rooftop
systems
solar
and
wind
farms
with
battery
backups
are
already
in
existence
in
south
australia
state
and
several
more
are
planned
pumped
hydropower
using
wind
and
solar
to
pump
water
from
a
lower
reservoir
back
to
a
higher
one
to
be
used
to
generate
power
in
periods
of
higher
demand
is
also
likely
with
extensions
to
existing
projects
in
tasmania
state
and
the
snowy
mountains
that
straddle
victoria
and
new
south
wales
states
the
seemingly
retail
power
bills
are
also
driving
consumers
to
rooftop
solar
with
battery
storage
which
could
result
in
lower
demand
from
the
grid
but
also
could
serve
as
a
for
the
grid
assuming
consumers
are
encouraged
to
make
their
excess
power
and
battery
storage
available
the
ultimate
irony
is
that
australia
is
on
the
verge
of
losing
a
fourth
prime
minister
in
a
decade
partly
because
of
his
attempts
to
deliver
an
energy
policy
that
reduced
the
role
of
coal
the
coal
proponents
circling
turnbull
like
sharks
don
t
seem
to
realise
or
care
that
their
preferred
fuel
is
likely
to
be
replaced
over
time
not
only
by
cheaper
alternatives
but
also
by
a
community
that
can
see
the
devastating
effects
of
climate
change
as
witnessed
by
the
drought
currently
gripping
much
of
australia
