compared

the

a

according

traffic
growth
has
been
correlated
with
changes
in
gasoline
prices
for
the
past
quarter
century
and
recent
fuel
price
increases
have
resulted
in

retail
gasoline

are
up
by
more
than
percent
from
their
cyclical
low
in
february
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
traffic
volumes
have
levelled
out
despite
continued
strong
growth
in
economic
output
incomes
and
employment
indicating
that
motoring
demand
has
been
hit
by
rising
fuel
prices
slower
traffic
growth
has
been
mirrored
in
flattening
gasoline
consumption
with
sales
to
domestic
customers
at
or
slightly
below

for
most

this

gasoline
supplied

was
marginally
down
from
the

is
now
forecasting
gasoline
consumption
will
be
essentially
unchanged

around

if

it

use
surged
by

lack

was
up
by

bpd
