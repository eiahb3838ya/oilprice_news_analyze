nairobi
reuters
the
united
states
doubts
whether
south
sudan
s
president
salva
kiir
and
rebel
leader
riek
machar
have
the
leadership
qualities
needed
to
deliver
peace
to
the
country
at
war
since
the
white
house
said
on
sunday
peace
talks
last
week
in
the
south
sudanese
capital
juba
need
to
be
more
inclusive
to
succeed
the
white
house
said
adding
that
it
will
impose
fresh
sanctions
on
anyone
who
threatens
the
country
s
stability
the
statement
constitutes
tough
language
about
south
sudan
a
country
whose
independence
in
washington
backed
after
a
war
with
sudan
that
lasted
decades
since
then
tens
of
thousands
have
been
killed
in
a
civil
war
we
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
direction
of
the
current
peace
process
a
narrow
agreement
between
elites
will
not
solve
the
problems
plaguing
south
sudan
said
the
statement
it
implored
the
warring
parties
to
implement
a
ceasefire
as
a
first
step
and
condemned
a
move
by
the
country
s
parliament
to
extend
the
government
s
term
in
office
south
sudan
s
political
leaders
have
not
demonstrated
the
leadership
required
to
bring
genuine
peace
we
remain
sceptical
that
they
can
oversee
a
peaceful
and
timely
transition
to
democracy
and
good
governance
it
said
on
june
a
resolution
at
the
united
nations
security
council
imposed
an
arms
embargo
south
sudan
s
parliament
voted
this
month
to
extend
kiir
s
mandate
until
a
move
likely
to
undermine
the
peace
talks
as
opposition
groups
say
the
change
is
illegal
last
week
kiir
said
he
is
ready
to
accept
a
peace
deal
to
end
the
war
and
set
up
an
inclusive
new
government
the
proposed
deal
would
give
the
country
five
vice
presidents
and
also
covers
security
and
power
sharing
arrangements
