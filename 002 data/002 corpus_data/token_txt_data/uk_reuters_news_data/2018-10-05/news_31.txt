jeffrey
gundlach
chief
executive
of
doubleline
capital
told
reuters
on
thursday
that
the
treasury
bond
yield
has
broken
above
a
base
which
should
lead
to
significantly
higher
in
financial
markets

i
have
been
saying
two
consecutive
closes
above
percent
on
the

said
on
thursday
the

closed
at
percent
compared
with

on
wednesday
the
surge
in
treasury
yields
has
also
prompted
a
rise
in
government
bond
yields
across
the
globe
with
a
major
exception
being
italy
where
borrowing
costs
dropped

the
spread
between
junk
bonds
and
treasuries
shrank
to
the
narrowest
since
on
wednesday
as
government
debt
was
sold
off
heavily
with
analysts
closely
watching
to
see
if
that
could
signal
a
imminent
end
to
the
credit
cycle
