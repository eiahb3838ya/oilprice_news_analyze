plastics
and
other
petrochemical
products
will
drive
global
oil
demand
to
offsetting
slower
consumption
of
motor
fuel
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
on
friday
despite
government
efforts
to
cut
pollution
and
carbon
emissions
from
oil
and
gas
the
agency
said
it
expected
the
rapid
growth
of
emerging
economies
such
as
india
and
china
to
propel
demand
for
petrochemical
products
petrochemicals
that
are
derived
from
oil
and
gas
feedstocks
form
the
building
blocks
for
products
that
range
from
plastic
bottles
and
beauty
products
to
fertilisers
and
explosives
oil
demand
for
transport
is
expected
to
slow
by
due
to
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
and
more
efficient
combustion
engines
but
that
would
be
offset
by
rising
demand
for
petrochemicals
the
iea
said
in
a
report
the
petrochemical
sector
is
one
of
the
blind
spots
of
the
global
energy
debate
and
there
is
no
question
that
it
will
be
the
key
driver
of
oil
demand

for
many
years
to

petrochemicals
are
expected
to
account
for
more
than
a
third

oil

by

nearly
half
of

growth
by
according
to
the
world
s
energy
watchdog
global
demand
for
petrochemical
feedstock
accounted
for
million
barrels

bpd
or
roughly
percent
of
total
demand
for
oil
in
the
figure
is
forecast
to
grow
to
almost
million
bpd
in
most
demand
growth
will
take
place
in
the
middle
east

china
where
big
petrochemical
plants
are

oil
companies
such
as
exxon

plastics
use
has
come
under
increased
scrutiny
as
waste
makes
its
way
into
the
oceans
where
it
harms
marine
life
prompting
several
countries
to

use
plastic
bags
but
the
iea
report
said
government
efforts
to
encourage
recycling
in
order
to
curb
carbon
emissions
would
have
only
a
minor
impact
on
petrochemical
growth
although
substantial
increases
in
recycling
and
efforts
to
curb
plastics
take
place
especially
led
by
europe
japan
and
korea
these
efforts
will
be
far
outweighed
by
the
sharp
increase
in
developing
economies
of
plastic
consumption
it
said
under
the
iea
s
most
aggressive
scenario
recycling
could
hit
around
percent
of
chemical
demand
petrochemical
plants
mainly
run
on
light
oil
products
such
as
naphtha
and
liquefied
petroleum
gas
lpg
but
natural
gas
is
becoming
an
increasingly
favoured
feedstock
particularly
in
the
united
states
where
shale
gas
production
has
risen
the
report
said
petrochemical
projects
would
account
for
percent
of
