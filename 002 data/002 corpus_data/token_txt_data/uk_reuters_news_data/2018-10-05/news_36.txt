feature-cycling city copenhagen sprints to become first carbon-neutral capital

around
the
world
more
than
major
cities
have
pledged
to
end
their
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
and
stop
pumping
out
emissions
by
but
copenhagen
a
city
of
wind
turbines
bicycles
and
reliable
public
transportation
thinks
it
can
go
even
further
it
intends
to
accomplish
that
shift
in
just
seven
years
it
will
require
a
complete
reimagining
of
how
the
danish
capital
is
powered
and
designed
and
a
lot
of
cyclists
officials
admit
why
are
we
going
for
that
people
might
say
what
we
do
in
copenhagen
doesn
t
really
matter
on
the
global
stage
at
all
we
are
tiny
said
jørgen
abildgaard
director
of
the
city
s
climate
programme
but
with
cities
and
countries
around
the
world
still
searching
for
ways
to
turn
the
paris
agreement
on
climate
change
into
a
reality
it
s
important
to
show
that
it
s
possible
to
make
this
transition
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
scandinavian
cities
have
long
been
seen
as
green
leaders
and
copenhagen
is
no
exception
while
other
cities
have
parking
garages
for
cars
copenhagen
has
them
for
bicycles
virtually
all
its
residents
own
a
bicycle
and
the
city
has
kilometres
of
dedicated
cycle
lanes
the
municipality
also
is
mostly
powered
by
clean
energy
and
it
has
its
own
renewable
energy
company
and
wind
turbines
running
its
own
energy
systems
is
one
of
the
reasons
copenhagen
is
already
well
on
track
to
being
carbon
neutral
meaning
it
will
produce
no
more
carbon
emissions
than
it
can
offset
elsewhere
by
the
city
s
concerted
efforts
to
go
green
put
it
firmly
ahead
of
the
schedule
set
by
almost
nations
in
paris
to
effectively
phase
out
greenhouse
gases
between
and
leading
climate
scientists
will
warn
next
week
that
global
carbon
emissions
from
energy
use
will
have
to
plunge
by
up
to
seven
percent
a
year
to
meet
paris
toughest
goals
unless
technologies
to
suck
carbon
from
the
air
and
store
it
are
developed
according
to
a
draft
report
obtained
by
reuters
copenhagen
s
officials
are
confident
the
city
can
largely
achieve
its
ambitious
goals
we
want
to
be
percent
carbon
neutral
by
but
if
we
are
percent
or
around
that
it
s
still
a
big
success
said
abildgaard
who
has
overseen
the
city
s
efforts
toward
carbon
neutrality
ever
since
it
made
its
pledge
in
when
it
hosted
climate
talks
in
copenhagen
produced
about
million
tonnes
of
gases
down
percent
from
according
to
city
figures
that
s
about
tonnes
of
emissions
per
capita
one
of
the
lowest
rates
for
a
european
city
the
city
said
the
reduction
in
emissions
was
largely
due
to
a
switch
to
wind
energy
under
hofor
the
city
s
own
utility
company
we
are
some
of
the
muscle
that
the
city
has
to
be
able
to
use
to
reach
its
goals
said
jörgen
edström
head
of
strategy
and
business
development
at
hofor
one
of
many
energy
companies
in
the
city
the
city
wanted
to
build
windmills
to
compensate
for
its
electricity
consumption
so
we
built
windmills
they
have
a
company
to
do
the
things
they
want
to
do
he
said
hofor
has
invested
billions
of
euros
to
build
wind
turbines
by
to
power
most
of
the
city
and
will
soon
replace
its
power
plants
with
units
that
burn
sustainable
wood
pellets
the
company
says
around
the
world
cities
consume
more
than
of
the
world
s
energy
and
account
for
about
of
carbon
dioxide
emissions
according
to
the
united
nations
that
means
finding
ways
for
cities
to
become
carbon
neutral
will
be
key
to
meeting
the
paris
commitment
to
keep
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
well
below
degrees
celsius
above
levels
cities
are
where
the
emissions
are
the
largest
so
if
cities
can
solve
the
problems
then
that
s
part
of
the
way
to
a
more
carbon
neutral
world
edström
said
in
its
quest
to
cut
emissions
copenhagen
has
another
distinct
advantage
for
over
years
the
city
and
denmark
as
a
whole
has
relied
on
district
heating
a
system
where
heat
is
produced
and
supplied
from
one
neighbourhood
or
area
plant
instead
of
per
household
that
means
the
city
itself
can
make
the
switch
to
cleaner
energy
for
large
numbers
of
residents
cutting
carbon
emissions
by
over
half
compared
to
the
use
of
individual
gas
or
oil
boilers
hofor
says
the
city
also
has
a
district
cooling
system
which
uses
seawater
to
cool
buildings
and
households
cutting
energy
consumption
up
to
percent
compared
to
traditional
methods
of
hofor
said
by
the
city
aims
to
be
powered
entirely
by
wind
sun
geothermal
energy
waste
and
wood
and
other
biomass
yet
despite
its
huge
investment
in
new
clean
technologies
one
of
the
city
s
big
priorities
is
cutting
prices
for
energy
users
the
municipality
didn
t
say
spend
all
the
money
to
achieve
the
they
said
we
want
lower
prices
and
we
want
carbon
neutrality
edström
said
that
aim
looks
to
be
within
reach
a
couple
living
in
a
flat
will
save
an
average
of
danish
krones
euros
each
year
on
energy
consumption
if
the
city
reaches
its
climate
goals
the
city
says
abildgaard
copenhagen
s
climate
director
said
it
was
crucial
to
work
closely
with
industries
such
as
construction
and
transport
to
devise
business
models
and
technologies
that
work
both
to
meet
business
goals
and
cut
emissions
we
want
to
keep
our
economic
growth
and
improve
our
infrastructure
and
make
that
transition
without
extra
costs
abildgaard
said
lower
higher
as
the
city
s
commitments
have
grown
so
has
its
economy
which
has
seen
percent
growth
over
the
past
two
decades
according
to
research
by
the
london
school
of
economics
and
political
science
strong
action
to
combat
climate
change
could
cumulatively
add
at
least
trillion
to
the
world
economy
by
according
to
a
september
study
by
the
global
commission
on
the
economy
and
climate
which
includes
former
heads
of
government
business
leaders
and
economists
copenhagen
plans
to
spend
at
least
billion
danish
krones
million
euros
by
to
roll
out
its
plan
to
achieve
carbon
neutrality
but
that
should
attract
nearly
billion
krones
billion
euros
in
private
green
investment
according
to
the
city
council
the
city
s
efforts
includes
expanding
its
public
transport
system
and
cycle
paths
retrofitting
buildings
with
poor
energy
efficiency
investing
in
research
for
cleaner
technologies
and
boosting
the
use
of
electric
vehicles
abildgaard
who
cycles
kilometres
a
day
to
his
harbourside
offices
in
central
copenhagen
said
transport
remained
a
major
challenge
both
because
most
residents
still
own
a
car
and
because
freight
trucks
are
commonly
used
to
deliver
goods
he
said
he
is
pushing
for
a
congestion
charge
system
similar
to
those
in
london
and
oslo
where
vehicles
are
charged
a
fee
when
they
enter
zones
in
the
city
centre
still
abildgaard
is
confident
copenhagen
will
be
the
first
big
capital
to
become
carbon
neutral
so
confident
in
fact
that
he
now
wants
residents
to
take
another
big
step
that
is
taking
into
account
not
just
emissions
generated
in
copenhagen
but
those
produced
when
residents
buy
things
made
or
grown
elsewhere
from
clothing
to
food
the
whole
holistic
view
is
important
environment
issues
are
part
of
the
dna
here
but
we
also
have
to
recognise
that
this
is
not
the
situation
around
the
world
