wall st week ahead-are transportation stocks the market's canary in a coal mine?
new
york
reuters
the
transportation
sector
which
many
see
as
a
proxy
indicator
of
the
economy
s
health
has
retreated
percent
from
its
record
hinting
to
some
analysts
that
the
longest
bull
market
on
record
has
entered
its
late
stages
railways
freight
carriers
and
package
deliverers
get
less
attention
than
momentum
stocks
like
apple
inc
and
but
the
sector
could
be
showing
cracks
in
what
analysts
and
the
federal
reserve
characterize
as
a
robust
economy
several
constituents
of
the
dow
jones
transportation
average
djt
have
provided
disappointing
guidance
in
recent
months
as
the
reporting
season
approaches
investors
will
watch
to
gauge
whether
trade
fuel
and
dollar
risks
are
affecting
the
sector
s
bottom
line
the
djt
has
recently
diverged
from
the
broader
market
after
a
strong
run
since
late
june
suggesting
these
headwinds
could
be
taking
a
toll
as
the
djt
has
retreated
the
broader
dow
jones
industrial
average
has
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
the
dow
reached
its
most
recent
high
on
tuesday
trading
days
after
the
djt
s
record
diverging
highs
between
the
two
indexes
can
signal
growing
market
instability
similar
divergences
occurred
leading
into
the
recessions
of
and
and
most
recently
heading
into
the
market
correction
that
began
in
late
january
the
transports
have
been
going
sideways
and
haven
t
confirmed
the
new
highs
in
the
industrials
said
michael
o
rourke
chief
market
strategist
at
jonestrading
in
greenwich
connecticut
if
the
transports
were
to
break
down
further
from
these
levels
if
you
saw
them
declining
another
or
percent
in
the
near
future
you
would
call
that
a
bearish
on
friday
both
indexes
closed
lower
with
the
djt
slipping
percent
and
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
dropping
percent
delta
air
lines
inc
is
due
to
report
on
a
week
after
lackluster
forecasts
from
the
company
and
its
peer
united
continental
pulled
airline
stocks
lower
the
bulk
of
the
companies
in
the
djt
are
expected
to
post
results
in
the
latter
half
of
october
fedex
corp
the
first
in
the
group
to
post
quarterly
earnings
on
missed
wall
street
estimates
as
costs
weighed
on
margins
the
global
package
delivery
company
has
been
challenged
this
year
by
the
ongoing
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
its
major
bilateral
trading
partners
notably
china
and
europe
although
a
preliminary
deal
to
replace
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
has
boosted
railway
stocks
looming
tariffs
threaten
to
increase
the
cost
of
transporting
goods
and
services
further
testing
other
djt
constituents
there
may
well
be
blood
in
the
water
before
we
actually
get
some
kind
of
agreement
on
trade
between
the
us
and
china
said
bernard
baumohl
managing
director
and
chief
global
economist
at
the
economic
outlook
group
in
princeton
new
jersey
it
could
do
some
serious
damage
in
the
long
run
as
china
seeks
to
establish
new
supply
chain
routes
from
other
countries
and
rely
less
on
the
united
analysts
see
costs
of
transportation
fuels
which
include
gasoline
diesel
and
jet
fuel
continuing
to
climb
due
to
tightening
supply
and
increasing
demand
rising
fuel
costs
are
depressing
stocks
that
make
up
the
transportation
index
baumohl
added
brent
crude
prices
have
risen
nearly
percent
since
the
beginning
up
the
year
and
energy
analysts
see
the
trend
continuing
well
into
in
the
we
ve
seen
prices
increase
as
a
result
of
iranian
sanctions
reducing
the
supply
of
crude
oil
to
the
market
said
andrew
lipow
consultant
at
lipow
oil
associates
in
houston
i
expect
that
over
the
next
year
the
price
in
transportation
fuel
is
going
to
be
the
climbing
dollar
could
also
pressure
transportation
companies
as
goods
grow
less
affordable
to
foreign
consumers
which
might
result
in
fewer
shipments
abroad
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
major
world
currencies
has
risen
almost
percent
so
far
this
year
the
net
effect
is
that
the
strong
dollar
could
impact
the
transportation
index
over
the
course
of
the
next
months
baumohl
said
meanwhile
investors
will
get
a
clearer
picture
in
coming
weeks
of
the
extent
to
which
trade
jitters
fuel
costs
and
the
rising
dollar
may
have
turned
transports
into
a
warning
sign
there
are
a
lot
of
wild
cards
out
there
now
