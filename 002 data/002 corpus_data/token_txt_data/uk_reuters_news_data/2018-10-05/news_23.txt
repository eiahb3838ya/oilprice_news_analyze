berlin

germany
s
environment
ministry
will
try
to
overcome
resistance
from
carmakers
to
fitting
older
diesel
cars
with
expensive
new
exhaust
filtering
systems
as
politicians
and
carmakers
scramble
to
avoid
outright
bans
on
vehicles
german
carmakers
and
politicians
were
forced
to
hash
out
a
compromise
deal
to
cut
pollution
this
week
after
environmental
groups
won
a
key
victory
in
february
which
allowed
cities
to
ban
older
diesel
cars
carmakers
are
now
scrambling
to
avert
bans
while
seeking
to
avoid
costly
of
old
cars
as
a
way
to
cut
nitrogen
dioxide
and
fine
particulate
pollution
levels
in
cities
volkswagen
on
friday
reiterated
it
would
back
retrofits
as
the
hardware
fixes
are
known
and
offer
to
shoulder
percent
of
the
costs
but
only
on
the
condition
that
other
carmakers
would
do
the
same
bmw
and
peugeot
have
said
they
don
t
see
them
as
a
viable
solution
that
statement
refers
to
the
early
reactions
of
bmw
or
the
vda
automotive
industry
association
that
can
not
be
the
end
of
it
the
environment
ministry
spokesman
said
in
a
regular
government
news
conference
the
issue
is
an
urgent
one
authorities
in
berlin
are
looking
at
imposing
bans
on
older
diesel
cars
on
streets
including
major
routes
in
the
german
capital
local
broadcaster
rbb
said
on
friday
a
ban
is
due
to
take
effect
in
frankfurt
germany
s
financial
capital
from
february
the
city
of
hamburg
this
year
voluntarily
blocked
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
emissions
standard
from
selected
trunk
roads
bmw
said
on
tuesday
it
did
not
see
hardware
retrofits
for
diesel
vehicles
as
a
sensible
way
for
cities
to
quickly
meet
european
union
clean
air
rules
the
time
it
takes
to
get
new
exhaust
filters
certified
for
roadworthiness
means
retrofits
take
longer
to
implement
than
immediate
incentives
which
allow
clients
to
buy
lower
polluting
cars
bmw
said
carlos
tavares
the
chief
executive
of
france
s
psa
group
said
the
retrofit
approach
doesn
t
work
because
carmakers
would
balk
at
having
to
make
a
financial
contribution
toward
rebuilding
older
cars
who
s
going
to
pay
is
not
clear
we
believe
it
s
not
the
carmakers
responsibility
because
at
the
time
when
those
cars
were
sold
they
met
all
legal
requirements
carlos
tavares
told
reuters
at
the
paris
motor
show
bmw
said
it
would
offer
a
incentive
of
euros
in
the
most
polluted
parts
of
the
country
