crude

continue
to

despite
attempts
by
oil
producers
to
reassure
the
market
about
availability
and
the
existence
of
enough
spare
capacity
to
offset
oil
lost

a
result
of

it
is
now
high
time
for
all
the
players

those

in

sanctions
output
restrictions
by
opec
and
its
allies
strong
consumption
growth
and
position
building
among
the
hedge

have
all
contributed
to
the

aggressive
implementation
of
sanctions
on
iran
has
left
refiners
and
traders
concerned
about
the
future
availability
of
crude
and
questioning
whether
opec
will
still
have
enough
spare
capacity
to
offset
any
other
losses
opec
and
its
allies
became
fixated
on
cutting
oil
inventories
down
to
the
average
and
waited
far
too
long
to
start
exiting
from
production
curbs
causing
the
market
to
overtighten
and
oil
consumption
has
grown
much
faster
than
most
analysts
forecast
at
the
start
of
the
year
while
many
sources
of
supply
have
risen
more
slowly
than
expected
despite
communications
between
policymakers
in
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
and
russia
to
synchronise
output
increases
with
the
of
sanctions
there
seem
to
have
been
a
series
of
misunderstandings
policymakers
appear
to
have
misjudged
how
quickly
the
united
states
would
try
to
cut
iran
s
exports
and
how
rapidly
other
opec
and
producers
could
fill
the
gap
sensing
the
market
is
moving
into
a
cyclical
period
of
and
low
spare
capacity
hedge

other
money

have
built
bullish
long
positions
accelerating
and
exaggerating
the
price
adjustment
the
oil
market
has
become
locked
in
an
upward
price
trend
as
hedge
funds
and
market
makers
all
try
to
maintain
neutral
or
long
positions
and
few
speculative
players
are
willing
to
take
the
short
side
of
the
market
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
have
accumulated
bullish
long
positions
betting
on
a
further
rise
in
prices
amounting
to
almost
billion
barrels
of
oil
at
the
same
time
the
number
of
short
positions
in
the
six
most
important
petroleum
futures

options
contracts
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
level
since
before
the
imbalance
between
bullish
and
bearish
positions
is
close
to
a
record
an
analysis
of
regulatory
and
exchange
data
showed
lopsided
positioning
has
often
been
the
precursor
to
a
sharp
reversal
in
the
price
trend
when
fund
managers
attempt
to
realise
profits
by
closing
some
positions
the
impact
of
lopsided
positioning
on
the
evolution
of

has
been
explored
by
researchers

the

while
lopsided

that

will
take
place

level
it
will
occur
in

prices
continued
