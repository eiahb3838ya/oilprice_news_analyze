on

including

routes
in
the
german
capital
local
broadcaster
rbb
said
on
friday
an
administrative

in

is
due
to
hear
a
case
brought
against
the
of
berlin
by
the
duh
environmental
group
next
tuesday
duh
wants
the

to
reduce

by
banning

to
the
euro

from

the
rbb
report
cited
internal
documents
on
cleaner
air
from
the
berlin
senate
administration
for
environment
transport
and
climate
protection
it
said
those
documents
showed
almost
one
in
six
drivers
in
berlin
would
be
affected
the
department
could
not
immediately
be
reached
for
comment
the
federal
german
government
this
week
outlined
plans
to
cut
pollution
from
diesel
vehicles
by
asking
carmakers
to
offer
owners
incentives
and
hardware
fixes
prompting
objections
from
environmental
groups
and
grudging
concessions
from
the
industry
the
german
environment
agency
uba
does
not
think
the
measures
agreed
at
the
diesel
summit
will
suffice
to
avoid
driving
bans
in
all
german
cities
magazine
der
spiegel
reported
on
friday
it
said
the
uba
germany
s
main
environmental
protection
agency
was
particularly
skeptical
about
whether
the
incentives
to
get
owners
of
older
diesel
cars
to
switch
to
newer
cleaner
ones
would
be
effective
volkswagen
s
admission
in
that
it
cheated
diesel
emissions
tests
led
to
the
discovery
that
diesel
vehicles
from
several
manufacturers
routinely
exceeded
pollution
limits
in
normal
driving
conditions
prompting
a
regulatory
crackdown
environmental
groups
have
been
encouraged
by
a
court
ruling
in
february
that
allowed
cities
to
ban
older
diesel
cars
a
ban
is
due
to
take
effect
in
frankfurt
germany
s
financial
capital
from
february
the
city
of
hamburg
this
year
voluntarily
blocked
diesel
models
that
fail
to
meet
the
emissions
standard
from
selected
trunk
roads
