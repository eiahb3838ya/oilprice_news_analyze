steadied
ahead
of
jobs
numbers
on
friday
as
a
high
in
oil
prices
and
the
biggest
weekly
jump
in
treasury
yields
since
february
left
investors
wondering
where
to
go
next
the
usual
drop
in
activity
ahead
of
the
monthly
payrolls
couldn
t
prevent
europe
s
main
bourses
following
asia
into
the
red
but
it
wasn
t
the
deep
shade
of
crimson
of
the
previous
day
lingering
worries
about
italy
s
finances
pushed
milan
down
percent
while
london
s
ftse
frankfurt
s
dax
and
the
cac
in
paris
were
off
percent
and
wall
street
futures
were
modestly
weaker
it
was
the
bond
and
currency
markets
though
where
the
attention
was
really
trained
the
dollar
barely
budged
against
its
main
sparring
partners
the
euro
and
the
japanese
yen
after
testing
a
high
but
rising
bond
yields
which
drive
the
global
cost
of
borrowing
were
causing
a
headache
again
benchmark
treasury
yields
were
at
a
top
and
on
their
way
to
their
biggest
weekly
yield
rise
since
february
while
european
yields
were
adding
to
their
biggest
rise
in
months
as
well
and
with
talk
of
plenty
more
interest
rate
hikes
growing
louder
it
put
all
the
more
focus
on
the

portfolio
manager
justin
bourgette
said
though
there
was
too
much
hype
around
the
payrolls
figures
whichever
way
you
approach
it
the
labour
market
is
currently
super
strong
the
latest
reuters
poll
sees
new
jobs
and
average
hourly
earnings
increasing
percent
in
september
after
leaping
percent
in
august
whatever
the
fed
s
concept
of
the
neutral
interest
rate
is
it
must
be
rising
bourgette
said
and
it
is
going
to
be
trial
and
error
to
some
degree
on
how
high
rates
go
because
you
just
don
t
know
where
the
choking
point
tied
in
with
the
rise
in
borrowing
costs
has
been
the
latest
spike
in
oil
prices
as
energy
costs
tend
to
have
an
outsized
impact
on
inflation
which
is
what
most
major
central
banks
focus
on
when
setting
interest
rates
brent
crude
futures
gained
percent
to
barrel
and
crude
rose
percent
to
barrel
that
kept
both
just
under
highs
they
have
also
risen
an
staggering
percent
since
iranian
exports
could
fall
below
million
barrels
per
day
in
november
bank
jefferies
said
referring
to
looming
sanctions
on
tehran
the
investment
bank
said
there
was
enough
oil
to
meet
demand
but
global
spare
capacity
is
dwindling
to
the
lowest
level
that
we
can
document
meaning
any
further
supply
disruptions
would
be
difficult
for
the
market
to
manage
and
could
lead
to
spiking
crude
oil
prices
the
painful
combination
of
rising
oil
prices
borrowing
costs
and
a
climbing
dollar
have
also
been
rocking
emerging
markets
which
tend
to
be
vulnerable
to
all
three
msci
s
emerging
market
equity
index
was
down
percent
and
headed
for
its
worst
week
since
february
and
plenty
of
currencies
were
carrying
heavy
losses
too
the
indian
rupee
fell
to
new
record
low
after
the
central
bank
kept
its
interest
rates
on
hold
the
rupee
has
been
hammered
by
higher
oil
prices
and
is
the
worst
performer
in
asia
this
year
indian
stocks
also
fell
for
a
third
straight
session
dragged
down
by
energy
firms
a
day
after
the
government
announced
a
cut
in
fuel
prices
that
cut
sparked
fears
of
the
country
going
back
towards
the
regulated
regime
where
the
prices
of
diesel
and
petrol
were
controlled
by
the
government
petrol
prices
were
regulated
until
while
diesel
prices
remained
so
until
in
general
what
s
driving
emerging
market
weakness
is
a
stronger
economy
there
is
a
lack
of
clarity
on
the
effectiveness
of
rate
hikes
as
a
currency
defence
