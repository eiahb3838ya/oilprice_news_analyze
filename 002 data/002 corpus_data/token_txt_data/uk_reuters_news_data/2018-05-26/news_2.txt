saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
discussing
raising
opec
and
oil
production
by
some
million
barrels
a
day
sources
said
weeks
after
president
donald
trump
complained
about
artificially
high
prices
riyadh
and
moscow
are
prepared
to
ease
output
cuts
to
calm
consumer
worries
about
supply
adequacy
their
energy
ministers
said
on
friday
with
saudi
arabia
s
khalid
adding
that
any
such
move
would
be
gradual
so
as
not
to
shock
the
market
raising
production
would
ease
months
of
strict
supply
curbs
amid
concerns
that
a
price
rally
has
gone
too
far
with
oil
having
hit
its
highest
since
late
at
a
barrel
this
month
trump
tweeted
last
month
that
opec
had
artificially
boosted
oil
prices
we
were
in
the
meeting
in
jeddah
when
we
read
the
tweet
opec
secretary
general
mohammad
barkindo
said
referring
to
a
meeting
in
saudi
arabia
on
april
i
think
i
was
prodded
by
his
excellency
khalid
that
probably
there
was
a
need
for
us
to
respond
we
in
opec
always
pride
ourselves
as
friends
of
the
united
states
barkindo
told
a
panel
with
the
saudi
and
russian
energy
ministers
in
petersburg
at
russia
s
main
economic
forum
opec
officials
said
by
the
need
to
respond
barkindo
was
referring
to
a
tweet
he
sent
the
same
day
rather
than
the
need
to
act
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
allies
led
by
russia
have
agreed
to
curb
output
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
through
to
reduce
global
stocks
but
the
inventory
overhang
is
now
near
opec
s
target
in
april
pact
participants
cut
production
by
percent
more
than
required
with
falling
output
from
venezuela
helping
opec
deliver
a
bigger
reduction
than
intended
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
an
increase
of
about
million
bpd
would
lower
compliance
to
percent
of
the
agreed
level
barkindo
also
said
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
united
states
to
put
pressure
on
opec
as
some
energy
secretaries
had
asked
the
producer
group
to
help
lower
prices
in
the
past
oil
prices
fell
more
than
percent
towards
a
barrel
on
friday
as
saudi
arabia
and
russia
said
they
were
ready
to
ease
supply
curbs
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
current
cuts
were
in
reality
million
bpd
due
to
a
drop
in
venezuelan
production
somewhere
around
million
bpd
higher
than
the
initially
agreed
reductions
novak
declined
to
say
however
whether
opec
and
russia
would
decide
to
boost
output
by
million
bpd
at
their
next
meeting
in
june
the
moment
is
coming
when
we
should
consider
assessing
ways
to
exit
the
deal
very
seriously
and
gradually
ease
quotas
on
output
cuts
novak
said
in
televised
comments
initial
talks
are
being
led
by
the
energy
ministers
of
opec
kingpin
saudi
arabia
and
russia
at
petersburg
this
week
along
with
their
counterpart
from
the
united
arab
emirates
which
holds
the
opec
presidency
this
year
the
sources
said
opec
and
ministers
meet
in
vienna
on
june
and
the
final
decision
will
be
taken
there
current
discussions
are
aimed
at
relaxing
compliance
with
the
production
cuts
the
sources
said
in
an
effort
to
cool
the
market
after
oil
hit
a
barrel
on
concerns
over
a
supply
shortage
china
has
also
raised
concerns
about
whether
enough
oil
is
being
pumped
according
to
a
saudi
statement
issued
after
energy
minister
falih
called
china
s
energy
chief
on
friday
to
discuss
cooperation
between
their
countries
and
to
review
the
oil
market
nur
bekri
administrator
of
china
s
national
energy
administration
told
falih
he
hopes
saudi
arabia
can
take
further
substantial
actions
to
guarantee
adequate
supply
in
the
crude
oil
market
the
saudi
energy
ministry
statement
said
while
russia
and
opec
benefit
from
higher
oil
prices
up
almost
percent
since
the
end
of
last
year
their
voluntary
output
cuts
have
opened
the
door
to
other
producers
such
as
the
shale
sector
to
ramp
up
production
and
gain
market
share
the
final
production
number
is
not
set
yet
as
dividing
up
the
extra
barrels
among
deal
participants
could
be
tricky
the
sources
said
the
talks
now
are
to
bring
compliance
down
to
the
percent
level
more
for
opec
rather
than
for
one
source
said
opec
may
decide
to
raise
oil
output
as
soon
as
june
due
to
worries
over
iranian
and
venezuelan
supply
and
after
washington
raised
concerns
the
oil
rally
was
going
too
far
opec
and
oil
industry
sources
told
reuters
on
tuesday
however
it
is
unclear
which
countries
have
the
capacity
to
raise
output
and
fill
any
supply
gap
other
than
gulf
oil
producers
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
sources
said
only
a
few
members
have
the
capability
to
increase
production
so
implementation
will
be
complicated
one
opec
source
said
so
far
opec
had
said
it
saw
no
need
to
ease
output
restrictions
despite
concerns
among
consuming
nations
that
the
price
rally
could
undermine
demand
the
rapid
decline
in
oil
inventories
and
worries
about
supplies
after
the
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
international
nuclear
deal
with
iran
as
well
as
venezuela
s
collapsing
output
were
behind
the
change
in
opec
s
thinking
