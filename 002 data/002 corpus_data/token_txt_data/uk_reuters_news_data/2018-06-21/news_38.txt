june
reuters
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
on
thursday
increasing
oil
supply
by
million
barrels
per
day
would
be
a
good
target
as
the
organization
of
the
oil
exporting
countries
and
allies
such
as
russia
meet
in
vienna
this
week
below
are
highlights
from
falih
s
speech
at
an
opec
seminar
what
strikes
me
most
is
the
great
alignment
the
very
strong
alignment
between
the
interests
of
producers
and
consumers
and
many
people
underestimate
how
much
alignment
of
interests
there
is
between
producers
and
consumers
of
we
ve
seen
investments
start
flowing
back
certainly
it
s
flowing
back
in
the
united
states
with
oil
the
shale
we
still
want
more
investment
my
concern
is
really
to
be
able
to
look
forward
in
terms
of
five
to
years
in
the
future
and
see
enough
projects
coming
back
we
want
to
prevent
the
shortage
and
the
squeeze
that
we
saw
in
we
saw
it
again
a
few
years
ago
as
a
result
of
lack
of
investment
but
at
the
same
time
we
want
to
prevent
the
severe
downturns
that
choke
the
industry
cause
bankruptcies
jobs
being
lost
across
the
our
opec
secretariat
will
share
with
us
today
in
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
their
report
i
ve
looked
at
the
report
flying
in
and
i
think
it
shows
that
there
will
be
a
deficit
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
of
million
barrels
assuming
that
the
main
production
continues
that
will
continue
to
drive
inventories
down
we
think
that
that
will
be
probably
too
short
of
a
supply
situation
we
can
not
allow
it
to
happen
so
what
level
of
supply
release
we
will
have
to
come
to
a
at
the
end
of
the
day
our
first
and
foremost
responsibility
is
to
our
consumers
and
to
our
how
much
do
we
distribute
amongst
the
countries
and
how
much
of
it
actually
is
delivered
i
think
is
the
debate
in
the
next
couple
of
one
thing
you
can
be
assured
of
is
we
will
be
responsible
we
will
release
supplies
to
make
sure
that
no
shortage
coming
close
or
even
below
the
million
cut
is
called
for
by
the
fundamentals
how
to
achieve
it
is
the
tricky
question
because
not
every
country
can
respond
to
an
allocation
for
a
higher
production
reallocating
output
to
other
countries
like
saudi
arabia
may
be
a
technical
solution
but
it
may
not
be
politically
acceptable
to
i
can
speak
for
saudi
arabia
we
do
have
a
couple
of
million
barrels
of
spare
capacity
how
much
oil
do
we
need
it
s
not
going
to
be
anything
close
to
that
level
but
volumes
around
million
probably
given
the
fact
that
we
will
see
demand
in
the
second
half
rise
significantly
above
the
first
half
i
think
million
sounds
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
good
target
to
work
in
the
mid
to
long
term
we
are
concerned
about
global
trade
and
global
economic
growth
obviously
when
the
major
economies
clash
it
s
difficult
for
me
to
see
that
we
re
going
to
see
a
significant
drop
in
demand
in
the
next
months
