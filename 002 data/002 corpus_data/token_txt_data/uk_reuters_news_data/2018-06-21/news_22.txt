south
africa
s
richards
bay
coal
terminal
rbct
has
boosted
productivity
and
improved
turnaround
times
after
a
billion
rand
million
machinery
upgrade
the
firm
said
on
thursday
as
it
reiterated
forecasts
for
record
exports
this
year
rbct
africa
s
largest
coal
export
facility
launched
the
project
to
replace
its
ageing
machines
with
the
aim
of
sustaining
the
terminal
s
million
tonne
capacity
but
the
process
has
also
increased
efficiencies
it
said
we
are
already
enjoying
several
operational
efficiencies
of
the
new
machines
said
rbct
chief
executive
officer
alan
waller
the
project
installed
two
new
stacker
reclaimers
which
scoop
up
and
transfer
coal
into
and
out
of
the
yard
and
its
shiploaders
they
in
turn
transport
coal
along
a
conveyer
into
a
ship
s
hold
the
two
new
reclaimers
are
expected
to
have
a
capacity
of
tonnes
per
hour
compared
to
the
previous
machines
tonnes
per
hour
while
the
shiploader
will
have
tonnes
per
hour
capacity
compared
with
tonnes
per
hour
previously
the
reclaimers
have
also
cut
the
amount
of
bulldozing
needed
after
its
arm
was
extended
further
into
the
coal
yard
from
metres
to
metres
said
rbct
project
general
manager
bill
murphy
that
means
it
has
a
longer
reach
and
there
is
less
bulldozing
time
it
increases
the
productivity
at
rbct
said
murphy
the
project
also
reconfigured
the
terminal
s
five
existing
electrical
substations
and
added
a
new
substation
rbct
said
it
is
well
on
track
to
reach
its
export
target
of
million
tonnes
this
year
and
has
already
surpassed
the
levels
it
had
reached
last
year
this
time
we
are
probably
million
tonnes
ahead
compared
to
this
time
last
year
said
waller
without
giving
specific
figures
the
terminal
exported
a
record
million
tonnes
of
coal
in
and
aims
to
export
million
tonnes
this
year
