as fukushima residents return, some see hope in nuclear tourism
fukushima
japan
reuters
on
a
cold
day
in
february
takuto
okamoto
guided
his
first
tour
group
to
a
sight
few
outsiders
had
witnessed
in
person
the
construction
cranes
looming
over
japan
s
fukushima
daiichi
nuclear
plant
seven
years
after
a
deadly
tsunami
ripped
through
the
tokyo
electric
power
plant
okamoto
and
other
tour
organisers
are
bringing
curious
sightseers
to
the
region
as
residents
who
fled
the
nuclear
catastrophe
trickle
back
many
returnees
hope
tourism
will
help
resuscitate
their
towns
and
ease
radiation
fears
but
some
worry
about
drawing
a
line
under
a
disaster
whose
impact
will
be
felt
far
into
the
future
the
cleanup
including
the
removal
of
melted
uranium
fuel
may
take
four
decades
and
cost
several
billion
dollars
a
year
the
disaster
happened
and
the
issue
now
is
how
people
rebuild
their
lives
okamoto
said
after
his
group
stopped
in
tomioka
kilometres
miles
south
of
the
nuclear
plant
he
wants
to
bring
groups
twice
a
week
compared
with
only
twice
a
month
now
electronic
signs
on
the
highway
to
tomioka
showed
radiation
around
times
normal
background
levels
as
okamoto
s
passengers
peered
out
tour
bus
windows
at
the
cranes
poking
above
fukushima
daiichi
for
me
it
s
more
for
bragging
rights
to
be
perfectly
honest
said
louie
ching
a
filipino
programmer
ching
two
other
filipinos
and
a
japanese
man
who
visited
chernobyl
last
year
each
paid
yen
for
a
day
trip
from
tokyo
the
group
had
earlier
wandered
around
namie
a
town
kilometres
north
of
the
plant
to
which
residents
began
returning
last
year
after
authorities
lifted
restrictions
so
far
only
about
of
people
are
back
a
ratio
similar
to
that
of
other
ghost
towns
near
the
nuclear
site
former
residents
mitsuru
watanabe
and
his
wife
rumeko
have
no
plans
to
return
they
were
only
in
town
to
clear
out
their
shuttered
restaurant
before
it
is
demolished
and
they
chatted
with
tourists
while
they
worked
we
used
to
pull
in
around
million
yen
a
year
mitsuru
said
as
he
invited
the
tourists
inside
a
calendar
hung
on
the
wall
and
unfilled
orders
from
the
evacuation
day
remained
on
a
whiteboard
in
the
kitchen
we
want
people
to
come
they
can
go
home
and
tell
other
people
about
us
mitsuru
said
among
the
dusty
tables
okamoto
s
group
later
visited
the
nearby
coastline
where
the
tsunami
killed
hundreds
of
people
abandoned
rice
paddies
a
few
derelict
houses
that
withstood
the
wave
and
the
gutted
ukedo
elementary
school
are
all
that
remain
it
s
here
behind
a
new
sea
wall
at
the
edge
of
the
restricted
radiation
zone
that
fukushima
prefecture
plans
to
build
a
memorial
park
and
archive
centre
with
video
displays
and
exhibits
about
the
quake
tsunami
and
nuclear
calamity
it
will
be
a
starting
point
for
visitors
kazuhiro
ono
the
prefecture
s
deputy
director
for
tourism
said
of
the
centre
the
japan
tourism
agency
will
fund
the
project
ono
added
ono
wants
tourists
to
come
to
fukushima
particularly
foreigners
who
have
so
far
steered
clear
overseas
visitors
spent
more
than
million
days
in
japan
last
year
triple
the
number
in
about
of
those
were
in
fukushima
tokyo
electric
will
provide
material
for
the
archive
although
the
final
budget
for
the
project
has
yet
to
be
finalised
he
said
some
people
have
suggested
a
barbecue
area
or
a
promenade
said
hidezo
sato
a
former
seed
merchant
in
namie
who
leads
a
residents
group
a
sticker
on
the
radiation
metre
around
his
neck
identified
him
as
being
the
first
to
return
to
the
town
if
people
come
to
brag
about
getting
close
to
the
plant
that
can
t
be
helped
but
at
least
they
ll
come
sato
said
the
archive
will
help
ease
radiation
fears
he
added
standing
outside
a
farmhouse
as
workmen
refurbished
it
so
her
family
could
return
mayumi
matsumoto
said
she
was
uneasy
about
the
park
and
archive
we
haven
t
gotten
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
at
the
plant
and
now
is
not
the
time
she
said
matsumoto
had
come
back
for
a
day
to
host
a
event
for
about
university
students
later
they
toured
namie
on
two
buses
including
a
stop
at
scaffolding
near
the
planned
memorial
park
site
to
view
fukushima
daiichi
s
cranes
matsumoto
described
her
feelings
toward
tokyo
electric
as
complicated
because
it
is
responsible
for
the
disaster
but
also
helped
her
family
cope
its
aftermath
one
of
her
sons
works
for
the
utility
and
has
faced
abuse
from
angry
locals
she
added
it
s
good
that
people
want
to
come
to
namie
but
not
if
they
just
want
to
get
close
to
the
nuclear
plant
i
don
t
want
it
to
become
a
spectacle
matsumoto
said
okamoto
is
not
the
only
guide
offering
tours
in
the
area
although
visits
of
any
kind
remain
rare
he
said
he
hoped
his
clients
would
come
away
with
more
than
a
few
photographs
if
people
can
see
for
themselves
the
damage
caused
by
tsunami
and
nuclear
plant
they
will
understand
that
we
need
to
stop
it
from
happening
again
said
okamoto
who
attended
university
in
a
neighbouring
prefecture
so
far
we
haven
t
come
across
any
opposition
from
the
local
yen
