simmering
trade
and
political
tensions
and
a
dollar
weighed
on
world
shares
on
thursday
while
oil
prices
were
under
pressure
before
an
opec
meeting
expected
to
increase
the
world
s
supply
of
crude
europe
s
main
stock
markets
were
back
near
lows
and
wall
street
s
s
p
and
dow
jones
started
lower
as
the
jitters
that
have
dominated
markets
for
months
overshadowed
a
new
record
high
for
the
nasdaq
a
dollar
also
caused
confusion
it
had
roared
to
an
peak
during
european
trading
only
to
fall
back
in
opening
deals
despite
another
drop
in
jobless
claims
figures
europe
s
big
move
was
a
percent
drop
in
car
shares
to
lows
after
maker
daimler
warned
the
global
trade
tensions
were
slowing
its
sales
italian
stocks
and
bonds
also
suffered
as
two
eurosceptics
were
given
key
parliamentary
finance
roles
by
the
country
s
new
coalition
the
reaction
of
the
dollar
has
been
very
interesting
this
week
said
state
street
global
markets
head
of
macro
strategy
michael
metcalfe
in
previous
periods
this
year
fears
of
a
trade
war
have
been
but
that
has
been
different
this
week
we
have
had
this
potential
escalation
in
the
trade
war
and
it
has
asia
had
been
mixed
too
with
japan
s
nikkei
adding
percent
and
australia
s
main
index
enjoying
another
strong
day
before
the
end
of
its
financial
year
next
week
china
however
finished
more
than
percent
lower
and
at
year
closing
lows
due
to
the
trade
strains
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
ended
down
too
have
been
percent
higher
at
one
point
gyrations
were
compounded
by
the
dollar
s
surge
to
an
high
that
raises
inflation
outside
the
and
puts
pressure
on
any
country
or
company
that
has
gorged
itself
on
debt
the
mere
absence
of
new
trade
threats
from
president
donald
trump
on
tariffs
was
nevertheless
enough
to
keep
hopes
alive
that
all
the
bluster
was
a
ploy
which
would
stop
short
of
an
outright
trade
war
markets
had
also
been
encouraged
by
the
people
s
bank
of
china
s
move
to
set
firm
fixings
for
its
yuan
along
with
the
addition
of
extra
liquidity
though
the
spot
yuan
rate
did
hit
a
fresh
low
there
was
also
much
speculation
the
central
bank
would
cut
bank
reserve
requirements
thus
boosting
lending
power
in
the
economy
wall
street
was
clearly
still
harbouring
worries
about
trade
as
it
opened
the
dow
jones
which
includes
caterpillar
and
boeing
both
with
big
chinese

will
rack
up
an
eighth
straight
session
of
losses
if
it
ends
in
the
red

even
though
there
was
nothing
directly
from

commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
did
give
a
cnbc
interview
what
we
have
to
do
is
create
an
environment
where
it
s
more
painful
for
these
parties
that
have
these
huge
trade
barriers
ross
said
the

swings
made
for
a
busy
day
for

an
high
against
a
basket
of

before
losing
steam
and
briefly
sent
the

sterling
had
hit
a
low
only
to
jump
back
up
to

unexpectedly
joined

minority
of

calling

rate
hike
at
its
latest
meeting
it
wasn
t
enough
to
stop
the
boe
keeping
everything
on
hold
but
it
did
revive
talk
of
an
august
rate
rise
while
the
european
central
bank
has
signalled
an
end
to
it
has
pledged
to
keep
euro

rates
low

next
summer
and
the
bank
of
japan
shows
no
sign
of
unwinding
its
stimulus
switzerland
s
central
bank
kept
its
rates
deep
in
negative
territory
on
thursday
and
warned
that
risks
to
the
economy
were
rising
amid
all
the
trade
war
noise
it
feels
like
the
yellow
warning
lights
are
flashing
for
the
global
economic
system
noted
analysts
at
citi
however
with
the
ecb
and
boj
still
pumping
in
liquidity
and
keeping
rates
lower
for
longer
the
chances
of
a
systemic

are
