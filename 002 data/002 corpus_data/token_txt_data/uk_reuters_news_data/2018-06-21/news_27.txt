iaea labs do the meticulous, unsung work behind nuclear inspections

while
the
atomic
watchdog
s
inspectors
travel
the
globe
to
check
that
countries
are
not
secretly
developing
nuclear
weapons
that
work
hinges
on
meticulous
analysis
by
two
laboratories
nestled
in
the
austrian
countryside
samples
taken
in
countries
including
iran
where
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
is
policing
the
country
s
nuclear
deal
with
major
powers
are
sent
to
the
iaea
s
labs
in
seibersdorf
near
vienna
there
equipment
scours
them
for
minute
traces
of
uranium
and
other
chemicals
on
their
visits
inspectors
swipe
surfaces
to
check
for
those
telltale
particles
they
also
take
samples
of
chemicals
produced
and
stored
at
declared
facilities
the
iaea
then
checks
that
what
it
has
found
matches
what
the
country
has
said
it
is
doing
if
you
are
for
example
in
your
kitchen
and
you
cook
something
you
will
always
splatter
something
around
like
particles
from
an
aerosol
said
stephan
vogt
head
of
the
iaea
s
environmental
sample
laboratory
describing
how
nuclear
work
leaves
telltale
particles
behind
afterwards
you
clean
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
clean
percent
there
will
always
be
a
little
bit
of
material
sticking
to
the
surfaces
and
if
someone
else
comes
later
on
and
takes
a
sample
they
can
tell
you
what
you
had
for
dinner
said
vogt
whose
lab
analyses
the
cloth
squares
swiped
on
surfaces
his
lab
s
equipment
includes
powerful
mass
spectrometers
which
break
down
particles
to
determine
the
precise
level
to
which
uranium
has
been
enriched
or
their
specific
isotope
we
re
here
to
basically
serve
as
an
auditor
independently
verifying
states
declarations
said
steve
balsley
head
of
the
nuclear
material
laboratory
which
analyses
uranium
and
plutonium
samples
from
declared
nuclear
sites
none
of
the
samples
come
in
with
their
geographical
origin
specified
ensuring
that
the
scientists
analysis
is
completely
unbiased
the
labs
are
also
part
of
a
broader
network
with
facilities
in
member
states
performing
their
own
analyses
and
duplicate
samples
laboratory
experts
need
to
confirm
that
the
uranium
and
plutonium
content
in
the
samples
matches
what
a
state
has
declared
to
the
agency
