three

bank
said
last
week
it
still
has
not
decided
whether
to
support
the
project
the
kosovo
government
had
asked
the
lender
earlier
to
provide
partial
risk
guarantees
for
the
project
that
would
enable
cheaper
loans
for
construction
kosovo
has
more

give
its

could
lock
kosovo

a
future
powered
by
lignite
the
dirtiest
form
of
coal
but
contourglobal
said
the
new
plant
will
improve
air
quality
by
reducing
the
emissions
from
the
two
plants
that
are
polluting
the
area
one

be
reduced
