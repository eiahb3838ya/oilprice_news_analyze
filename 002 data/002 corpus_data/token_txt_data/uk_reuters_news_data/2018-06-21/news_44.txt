a
historically
low

and
allegations
of

parliament
which
had
mandated
the
recount
after
a
government
report
found
serious
violations
had
taken
place
had
also
cancelled
some
results
such
as
overseas
and
displaced
votes
by
amending
the
election
law
this
month
the
verdict
from
the
supreme
federal
court
confirms
the
recount
process
which
was
opposed
by
the
elections
commission
and
some
parties
who
made
significant
gains
in
the
election
the
supreme
federal
court
finds
that
parliament
s
decision
was
to
organise
the
electoral
process
and
restore
voter
confidence
in
the
electoral
process
it
was
within
parliament
s
constitutional
rights
and
does
not
contradict
the
constitution
said
chief
justice
medhat
attending
lawmakers
cheered
as
mahmoud
read
out
the
verdict
the
recount
process
has
already
begun
after
judges
took
over
leadership
of
iraq
s
independent
high
elections
commission
the
verdict
is
final
and
not
subject
to
appeal
the
court
was
tasked
with
ruling
on
the
matter
after
the
law
amendment
was
challenged
by
iraq
s
president
the
election
commission
chief
and
a
kurdish
party
on
multiple
grounds
this
cancellation
presents
a
squandering
of
votes
and
confiscation
of
the
will
of
voters
in
these
areas
which
violates
constitutional
articles
that
guarantee
the
right
to
equality
and
voting
said
mahmoud
the
amendment
had
stipulated
that
votes
by
iraqis
abroad
those
displaced
in
the
war
against
islamic
state
in
sunni
arab
provinces
and
security
forces
in
the
kurdistan
region
would
be
cancelled
the
remainder
of
the
election
law
was
constitutional
the
chief
justice
said
plaintiffs
had
claimed
the
amendment
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
passed
by
a
parliament
in
which
most
lawmakers
failed
to
retain
their
seats
the
court
said
the
current
parliament
s
term
has
not
expired
yet
and
thus
it
was
within
its
rights
to
legislate
nationalist
cleric
moqtada
and
militia
chief
hadi
who
won
first
and
second
place
respectively
in
the
polls
have
announced
an
alliance
between
their
political
blocs
but
the
formation
of
a
new
government
is
still
a
long
way
as
parties
engage
in
the
traditional
horse
trading
that
follows
iraqi
elections
as
they
wait
for
the
results
to
be
formally
ratified
after
the
recount
