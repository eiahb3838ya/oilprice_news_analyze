update 3-after gazprom probe, eu investigates qatar's long-term lng contracts
reuters
the
european
commission
is
investigating
the
bloc
s
biggest
gas
supplier
qatar
petroleum
over
potentially
restrictive
supply
agreements
inhibiting
development
of
a
single
gas
market
its
latest
challenge
to
a
major
gas
supplier
the
bloc
having
just
wrapped
up
a
market
abuse
probe
into
russian
giant
gazprom
said
it
sought
to
determine
if
qatar
s
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
supply
deals
with
european
utilities
barred
them
from
diverting
shipments
within
the
region
destination
clauses
are
a
fixture
of
lng
deals
that
tie
buyers
to
receiving
shipments
at
a
specific
port
thereby
preventing
cargo
diversions
that
could
undercut
qatar
in
a
third
market
qatar
is
the
world
s
biggest
lng
producer
and
its
geographical
location
between
europe
and
asia
also
allows
it
to
swing
supply
to
the
most
lucrative
market
which
causes
periodic
supply
shortages
particularly
in
northwest
europe
roughly
speaking
qatar
offers
two
types
of
lng
supply
arrangements
in
europe
the
classic
deal
prevalent
across
southern
europe
forces
the
buyer
to
take
or
pay
for
a
fixed
annual
quantity
of
lng
even
if
they
do
not
need
it
in
such
cases
diversion
curbs
may
limit
the
benefit
to
europe
given
that
italy
s
edison
for
example
couldn
t
freely
send
emergency
supplies
of
qatari
lng
to
plug
potential
shortfalls
in
southern
france
the
second
contract
type
confined
to
northwest
europe
leaves
it
largely
up
to
qatar
as
to
how
much
lng
arrives
at
port
the
world
s
biggest
lng
importer
japan
has
led
the
backlash
against
destination
curbs
in
lng
deals
a
throwback
to
a
time
when
producers
held
the
upper
hand
after
its
fair
trade
commission
last
year
banned
the
practice
in
any
new
deals
the
probe
into
qatar
s
lng
deals
follows
extensive
consultation
between
the
european
commission
and
japan
s
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
in
recent
months
exploring
the
impact
of
such
curbs
on
gas
market
development
and
price
transparency
workshop
presentations
seen
by
reuters
show
we
have
opened
an
investigation
to
look
at
whether
there
are
problematic
territorial
restriction
clauses
in
gas
supply
contracts
with
qatar
petroleum
commissioner
margrethe
vestager
in
charge
of
competition
policy
said
in
a
statement
such
clauses
may
harm
competition
and
prevent
consumers
from
enjoying
the
benefits
of
an
integrated
european
energy
market
she
said
in
a
statement
qatar
petroleum
said
the
investigation
will
focus
on
five
of
its
lng
subsidiaries
operated
by
qatargas
qatar
petroleum
wishes
to
stress
that
it
gives
the
highest
importance
to
compliance
with
regulatory
authorities
in
all
geographical
areas
in
which
it
operates
it
said
trevor
sikorski
analyst
at
energy
aspects
said
the
producer
could
face
fines
of
up
to
percent
of
global
turnover
if
found
guilty
of
behaviour
the
more
likely
outcome
is
they
agree
to
remove
all
restrictive
destination
clauses
in
their
supply
agreements
with
european
buyers
he
said
eu
regulators
ultimately
decided
against
fining
gazprom
after
finishing
the
probe
in
may
but
it
did
force
gazprom
to
reform
its
pricing
structure
and
allow
buyers
in
eastern
and
central
europe
greater
control
over
supply
under
eu
rules
destination
restrictions
hold
no
sway
once
pipeline
gas
or
lng
shipments
arrive
at
european
ports
while
this
has
liberated
piped
gas
flows
across
the
region
lng
is
more
cumbersome
to
from
one
port
to
another
heightening
market
divisions
qatar
supplied
percent
of
the
eu
s
lng
last
year
at
million
tonnes
compared
to
million
tonnes
in
total
according
to
data
from
the
international
group
of
lng
importers
nigeria
and
algeria
were
the
next
biggest
suppliers
with
just
over
million
tonnes
