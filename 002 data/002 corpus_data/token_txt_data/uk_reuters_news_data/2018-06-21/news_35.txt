attention
is
focused
this
week
on
vienna
where
ministers
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
must
decide
whether
to
increase
their
output
in
the
second
half
of
but
the
direction
of
prices
over
the
next
year
will
be
more
influenced
by
less
visible
developments
in
the
major
countries
especially
the
united
states
europe
china
and
india
with
available
production
capacity
fairly
fixed
in
the
oil
market
rebalancing
will
depend
on
consumer
reactions
to
higher
prices
stocks
of
crude
oil
and
refined
products
are
now
below
their
averages
and
expected
to
continue
falling
in
the
second
half
of
and
through
opec
s
spare
production
capacity
has
shrunk
to
less
than
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
is
expected
to
fall
to
less
than
million
bpd
by
the
end
of
opec
and
its
allies
are
discussing
an
output
increase
of
million
bpd
or
more
to
avert
future
shortages
and
stock
declines
by
adding
barrels
to
the
market
now
opec
can
stabilise
or
even
increase
inventories
and
ease
shortages
later
in
but
the
cushion
of
spare
capacity
is
already
low
and
will
shrink
further
as
opec
boosts
its
output
leaving
the
market
without
much
capacity
to
absorb
further
disruptions
oil
production
is
expected
to
rise
by
million
bpd
in
and
another
million
bpd
in
but
may
not
be
able
to
rise
much
faster
because
of
pipeline
bottlenecks
from
the
supply
side
therefore
the
oil
market
s
production
capability
now
appears
fairly
fixed
for
the
rest
of
and
into
any
further
rebalancing
will
have
to
come
from
the
demand
side
where
prices
will
have
to
rise
high
enough
to
moderate
consumption
growth
global
consumption
has
increased
by
an
average
of
million
bpd
for
the
last
three
years
accelerating
from
an
average
of
million
bpd
in
the
three
previous
years
slower
growth
in
consumption
will
almost
certainly
have
to
play
a
significant
role
in
pushing
the
oil
market
back
towards
balance
benchmark
oil
prices
have
already
risen
by
around
percent
over
the
last
year
which
should
help
restrain
consumption
growth
the
critical
question
is
whether
the
rise
in
prices
has
already
been
enough
to
promote
a
slowdown
or
whether
prices
will
have
to
rise
even
further
the
problem
for
traders
and
ministers
trying
to
estimate
the
price
needed
to
rebalance
the
market
is
that
consumption
responds
to
price
changes
with
a
delay
of
six
to
months
and
in
most
important
consuming
countries
reliable
statistics
on
consumption
are
available
only
with
a
delay
of
three
to
four
months
a
sharp
rise
in
prices
almost
always
leads
to
a
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
especially
in
the
advanced
economies
but
the
slowdown
is
always
more
apparent
in
retrospect
than
at
the
time
by
the
time
a
slowdown
shows
up
in
official
statistics
it
will
already
be
too
late
and
prices
will
probably
have
risen
too
high
to
be
sustainable
in
and
again
in
surging
oil
prices
resulted
in
a
sharp
slowdown
in
consumption
growth
in
the
advanced
economies
though
at
the
time
many
analysts
dismissed
signs
of
a
slowdown
in
both
cases
the
oil
market
was
eventually
forced
back
to
balance
but
not
before
prices
had
overshot
on
the
upside
creating
conditions
for
the
subsequent
collapse
