oil
and
gas
drilling
and
related
operations
give
off
much
more
of
the
powerful
greenhouse
gas
methane
than
the
federal
government
estimates
wasting
about
billion
of
fuel
a
year
scientists
said
on
thursday
methane
the
main
component
of
natural
gas
is
colorless
and
odorless
it
is
a
major
force
in
global
warming
because
it
has
more
than
times
the
warming
potential
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
first
years
after
it
escapes
to
the
atmosphere
in
high
concentrations
it
can
also
lead
to
formations
of
smog
which
is
linked
to
heart
and
lung
damage
the
amount
of
methane
leaked
from
oil
and
gas
wells
and
related
infrastructure
in
equaled
about
percent
of
the
country
s
overall
natural
gas
output
a
study
led
by
the
environmental
defense
fund
advocacy
group
said
that
was
much
more
than
the
percent
the
environmental
protection
agency
estimated
for
in
a
report
last
year
due
to
the
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
fuel
that
vanishes
in
the
air
some
energy
companies
are
expected
to
cut
down
on
emissions
using
better
monitoring
equipment
in
drones
and
vehicles
this
is
a
solvable
problem
because
you
are
losing
product
that
you
could
sell
said
steven
hamburg
the
edf
s
chief
scientist
and
a
of
the
study
but
the
entire
industry
has
to
take
action
to
stop
the
problem
he
added
once
leaks
are
detected
stopping
them
becomes
a
matter
of
routine
maintenance
that
cuts
down
on
well
breakdowns
which
are
more
expensive
to
fix
he
said
the
study
integrating
five
years
of
research
by
scientists
from
universities
and
institutions
including
stanford
harvard
and
purdue
said
it
was
the
most
comprehensive
look
ever
at
fugitive
methane
emissions
from
energy
development
the
research
was
published
in
the
journal
science
while
president
donald
trump
s
administration
has
been
trying
to
roll
back
methane
rules
on
energy
operations
set
by
former
president
barack
obama
s
administration
the
epa
s
underestimation
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics
said
hamburg
the
agency
likely
underestimates
the
emissions
because
it
seeks
permission
from
oil
and
gas
operators
to
take
measurements
and
workers
may
avoid
errors
or
fix
problems
when
measurement
teams
arrive
the
study
said
the
study
relied
on
both
measurements
such
as
aircraft
observations
and
measurements
made
directly
at
or
downwind
of
energy
facilities
most
of
the
emissions
come
from
malfunctioning
well
pads
that
are
not
fixed
because
the
leaks
are
not
detected
the
study
said
leaks
can
be
found
at
both
young
and
mature
wells
and
at
fracking
and
conventional
wells
the
malfunctioning
wells
were
largely
absent
from
epa
s
inventory
hamburg
said
the
study
did
not
consider
leaks
from
local
distribution
and
power
plants
that
burn
natural
gas
or
chemical
plants
that
use
it
to
make
products
but
scientists
say
those
leaks
are
significant
