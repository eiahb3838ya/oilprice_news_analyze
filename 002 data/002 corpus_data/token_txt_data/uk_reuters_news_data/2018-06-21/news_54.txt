opec
s
leader
saudi
arabia
and
russia
were
trying
on
thursday
to
convince
fellow
oil
producers
to
raise
output
from
july
to
meet
rising
global
demand
with
iran
still
signalling
it
would
support
only
a
modest
increase
in
supply
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
meets
on
friday
to
decide
output
policy
amid
calls
from
top
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
china
and
india
to
cool
down
oil
prices
and
support
the
world
economy
by
producing
more
crude
russia
which
is
not
in
opec
has
proposed
producers
raise
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
effectively
wiping
out
supply
cuts
of
million
bpd
that
have
helped
rebalance
the
market
in
the
past
months
and
lifted
oil
to
around
per
barrel
oil
traded
as
low
as
in
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
also
said
on
wednesday
that
the
market
demanded
more
oil
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
and
that
opec
was
moving
towards
a
good
decision
opec
s
producer
iran
has
so
far
been
the
main
barrier
to
a
deal
as
it
said
on
tuesday
opec
was
unlikely
to
reach
an
agreement
and
should
reject
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
pump
more
oil
but
on
wednesday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
opec
members
that
had
overdelivered
on
cuts
in
recent
months
should
comply
with
agreed
quotas
that
would
effectively
mean
a
modest
boost
from
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
that
have
been
cutting
more
deeply
than
planned
despite
production
outages
in
venezuela
and
libya
iran
s
production
is
also
likely
to
fall
in
the
second
half
of
due
to
new
sanctions
ecuador
said
opec
and
its
allies
could
agree
to
a
compromise
increase
in
output
of
around
million
bpd
zanganeh
was
due
to
attend
a
ministerial
committee
on
thursday
iran
is
usually
not
part
of
the
committee
which
includes
russia
saudi
arabia
the
united
arab
emirates
oman
kuwait
algeria
and
venezuela
before
the
committee
meeting
zanganeh
was
also
scheduled
to
meet
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
for
separate
talks
iraq
and
venezuela
have
also
opposed
a
relaxation
of
production
cuts
fearing
a
slump
in
prices
for
possible
scenarios
