coal in the crossfire: chinese traders wary of being burnt by trade war
beijing
reuters
at
least
three
coal
shipments
on
their
way
to
china
may
end
up
casualties
of
the
escalating
trade
dispute
after
beijing
said
it
would
impose
steep
tariffs
that
may
kick
in
before
the
ships
reach
their
destinations
the
addition
of
coal
to
the
list
of
more
than
items
facing
higher
tariffs
came
as
a
shock
to
chinese
steel
mills
and
trading
firms
that
just
last
month
were
encouraged
by
beijing
to
buy
more
coal
to
narrow
the
trade
gap
four
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
plan
said
although
items
on
the
list
face
higher
tariffs
starting
july
beijing
did
not
specify
when
coal
and
the
other
remaining
items
would
be
hit
but
coal
s
presence
on
the
list
has
sent
shudders
through
the
market
i
am
really
worried
i
haven
t
found
buyers
interested
in
these
cargoes
now
said
the
manager
of
shanghai
runhe
international
trade
co
which
has
three
shipments
of
coking
coal
en
route
to
china
he
said
runhe
had
paid
for
the
coal
up
front
rather
than
using
letters
of
credit
from
banks
who
knows
what
trump
is
going
to
do
next
in
the
worst
scenario
we
lost
some
money
he
added
he
declined
to
be
named
because
of
company
policy
a
cargo
of
coking
coal
depending
on
the
size
of
the
vessel
can
be
worth
million
to
million
from
late
until
january
china
bought
no
coal
from
the
united
states
as
it
typically
costs
more
takes
longer
to
arrive
and
is
of
lower
quality
than
australian
coal
purchases
resumed
at
a
lower
level
after
president
donald
trump
took
office
thomson
reuters
eikon
data
show
replacing
american
shipments
with
coal
from
other
places
would
not
be
difficult
the
sources
said
wang
a
private
coal
trader
who
had
planned
to
buy
coal
from
runhe
said
he
was
changing
course
that
plan
is
now
completely
off
the
table
said
wang
who
is
based
in
rizhao
we
were
mystified
by
the
trade
policies
in
may
my
reading
of
the
policy
was
that
china
is
to
step
up
coal
buying
to
contribute
to
imports
he
added
wang
declined
to
be
named
because
of
the
sensitivity
of
the
topic
he
is
not
the
only
one
alarmed
an
executive
with
the
trading
arm
of
a
major
chinese
building
materials
company
said
it
had
stopped
talks
with
coal
producers
we
resumed
our
talks
with
coal
producers
recently
the
executive
said
but
our
talks
are
stopped
she
added
that
the
company
had
not
been
prepared
for
the
policy
reversal
she
declined
to
be
named
due
to
company
policy
trade
flow
data
from
thomson
reuters
eikon
showed
that
the
three
coal
shipments
the
only
confirmed
cargoes
in
transit
from
the
united
states
to
china
are
heading
to
jintang
port
in
hebei
province
one
vessel
the
navios
taurus
loaded
tonnes
in
late
may
in
mobile
and
is
estimated
to
arrive
on
july
days
after
some
of
the
proposed
tariffs
are
set
to
kick
in
another
vessel
named
partnership
carrying
tonnes
of
coal
from
virginia
is
due
to
arrive
at
jingtang
port
on
june
to
view
a

of
coal
cargoes
heading
for
china
click
the
cargoes
owners
might
risk
a
credit
downgrade
if
they
can
not
find
buyers
fast
enough
making
it
harder
to
borrow
in
the
future
the
building
materials
executive
said
the
owners
of
those
two
cargoes
must
be
on
a
hot
pan
now
she
said
a
third
vessel
the
west
trader
completed
loading
of
tonnes
of
coal
in
baltimore
on
monday
its
listed
destination
is
china
and
it
is
scheduled
to
arrive
on
reuters
was
not
able
to
identify
the
buyer
of
that
cargo
shanghai
runhe
declined
to
say
whether
it
owned
any
of
the
three
vessels
some
steel
mills
did
not
buy
coking
coal
from
the
despite
political
pressure
we
are
much
relieved
that
we
don
t
need
to
buy
coal
now
an
executive
from
one
of
china
s
largest
steel
producers
said
she
declined
to
be
named
because
of
company
policy
she
said
that
authorities
told
her
mill
in
late
may
to
buy
more
coking
coal
from
the
united
states
but
that
the
company
couldn
t
make
any
deals
because
of
unattractive
prices
and
higher
shipping
costs
coking
coal
typically
costs
three
times
more
and
takes
three
times
longer
to
arrive
than
coal
from
australia
data
show
supplies
can
also
be
of
poorer
quality
because
of
high
sulphur
content
and
low
heating
efficiency
we
could
only
afford
a
small
volume
of
coal
even
if
we
are
asked
to
buy
more
but
i
am
glad
it
s
not
a
concern
for
us
anymore
she
said
china
bought
million
tonnes
of
coking
coal
in
of
which
percent
came
from
the
united
states
