reuters
the
mongolian
government
on
thursday
submitted
plans
to
parliament
to
list
a
chunk
of
the
company
that
holds
the
giant
tavan
tolgoi
coal
mine
the
potential
initial
public
offering
comes
as
the
country
looks
to
kickstart
the
development
of
one
of
the
world
s
largest
coking
coal
deposits
with
international
coal
prices
picking
up
after
years
in
the
doldrums
mining
minister
sumiyabazar
dolgorsuren
presented
a
bill
to
parliament
proposing
the
sale
of
up
to
percent
of
the
project
on
domestic
and
international
stock
markets
according
to
a
notice
on
mongolia
s
official
parliamentary
website
the
potential
value
of
an
ipo
was
not
mentioned
the
government
said
in
a
statement
on
wednesday
that
it
would
also
speed
up
plans
to
build
a
billion
power
plant
near
the
mine
as
well
as
a
railway
that
would
help
deliver
tavan
tolgoi
s
coal
to
the
chinese
border
the
government
believes
that
the
economic
benefits
of
the
deposit
will
increase
it
said
in
the
statement
tavan
tolgoi
in
the
gobi
desert
about
kilometres
miles
from
the
chinese
border
has
an
estimated
billion
tonnes
of
reserves
and
is
considered
one
of
mongolia
s
flagship
mining
projects
it
is
run
by
erdenes
tavan
tolgoi
however
it
has
been
held
back
by
poor
infrastructure
and
weak
coal
prices
as
well
as
disputes
over
the
role
foreign
investment
should
play
in
mongolia
s
economic
development
as
early
as
mongolia
appointed
bnp
paribas
deutsche
bank
and
goldman
sachs
and
macquarie
to
lead
an
ipo
for
tavan
tolgoi
said
to
be
worth
as
much
as
billion
and
previous
administrations
have
discussed
a
triple
listing
for
the
project
in
london
hong
kong
and
ulaanbaatar
mongolia
also
allowed
international
investors
to
bid
to
develop
the
mine
s
western
block
in
but
shelved
the
plan
amid
complaints
from
japan
and
south
korea
that
the
process
was
unfair
in
late
a
consortium
consisting
of
mongolia
s
energy
resources
china
s
shenhua
energy
and
the
sumitomo
corporation
of
japan
was
selected
to
invest
billion
in
the
project
however
talks
with
the
government
collapsed
in
after
a
plunge
in
coal
prices
some
analysts
still
doubt
mongolia
is
ready
to
launch
the
ipo
i
am
still
not
convinced
tavan
tolgoi
is
moving
any
time
soon
as
unresolved
major
issues
still
remain
such
as
funding
for
the
railway
and
coal
washing
plant
said
mogi
badral
bontoi
head
of
cover
mongolia
an
market
intelligence
firm
will
the
chinese
be
involved
again
without
resolving
these
issues
both
on
paper
and
politically
the
tavan
tolgoi
ipo
is
still
far
from
reality
