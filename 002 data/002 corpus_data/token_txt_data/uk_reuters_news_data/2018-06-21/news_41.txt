china to reduce u.s. oil imports post-sept amid trade spat -sources
reuters
chinese
oil
buyers
will
keep
taking
crude
from
the
united
states
through
september
but
plan
to
reduce
future
purchases
to
avoid
a
likely
import
tariff
amid
a
trade
spat
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
multiple
industry
sources
said
beijing
has
put
energy
products
including
crude
oil
and
refined
products
on
lists
of
goods
that
it
will
hit
with
import
taxes
in
retaliation
for
similar
moves
by
washington
beijing
did
not
specify
when
it
will
impose
a
percent
tax
on
oil
and
that
gives
buyers
time
to
adjust
purchases
while
waiting
for
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
the
sources
said
unipec
trading
arm
of
sinopec
asia
s
largest
refiner
and
biggest
buyer
of
oil
has
been
offering
crude
such
as
west
texas
intermediate
wti
midland
to
other
asian
buyers
for
july
said
three
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
offers
they
unipec
only
offer
crude
for
september
arrival
that
means
cargoes
one
of
the
sources
said
although
adding
that
the
offer
was
quite
expensive
unipec
officials
said
this
was
normal
trading
activity
as
the
trading
unit
often
excess
crude
from
its
refining
system
depending
on
economics
and
the
state
of
its
supplies
a
top
trading
executive
with
sinopec
told
reuters
the
state
refiner
will
maintain
its
usual
import
volumes
for
but
can
t
commit
to
bookings
further
out
future
purchases
from
onwards
will
depend
on
developments
said
the
executive
who
asked
not
to
be
named
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
subject
a
sinopec
spokesman
declined
to
comment
unipec
said
early
this
year
that
the
company
expects
to
trade
up
to
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
by
the
end
of
the
year
about
triple
the
trading
volume
last
year
that
will
be
worth
roughly
billion
over
the
whole
year
based
on
per
barrel
of
oil
if
the
tariff
is
a
problem
the
is
going
to
struggle
to
find
a
market
as
big
as
china

said
at
a
thomson
reuters
industry
seminar
on
thursday
i
don
t
see
a
major
impact
on
our
purchasing
program
cargoes
for
july
loadings
are
unlikely
be
affected
said
a
planning
executive
with
a
sinopec
plant
that
buys
million
to
million
barrels
of
oil
every
month
his
plant
this
week
nominated
internally
with
unipec
for
an
august
loading
plan
that
is
expected
to
be
finalised
a
month
later
said

planning
executive

crude
oil
exports

china
shipped
in
million
tonnes
or
about
bpd
of
crude
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
nearly
eight
times
the
amount
a
year
earlier
and
percent
of
china
s
top
crude
oil
imports
according
to
chinese
customs
the
grades
include
wti
mars
and
southern
green
canyon
nevertheless
uncertainty
over
the
timing
of
the
tariff
and
the
outcome
of
trade
talks
has
kept
some
buyers
from
booking
further
ahead
chinese
refineries
typically
order
oil
three
months
in
advance
due
to
shipping
distances
we
don
t
even
know
whether
it
will
eventually
be
carried
out
what
if
the
and
china
compromise
and
things
change
overnight
said
a
third
source
who
deals
oil
with
an
independent
refiner
adding
that
his
company
will
stop
booking
crude
for
september
deliveries
into
china
sinopec
refinery
sources
said
finding
alternative
supplies
won
t
be
an
issue
as
oil
is
relatively
new
to
the
chinese
market
and
can
be
replaced
by
north
sea
grades
like
forties
middle
eastern
