world bank says tajik rogun power plant financing off the table
dushanbe
reuters
tajikistan
has
chosen
not
to
borrow
from
the
world
bank
to
finance
the
construction
of
the
rogun
hydroelectric
power
plant
a
bank
executive
told
reuters
the
former
soviet
republic
issued
its
debut
million
eurobond
last
year
to
raise
money
for
the
billion
megaproject
but
it
remains
unclear
where
further
funding
will
come
from
cyrill
muller
world
bank
vice
president
for
europe
and
central
asia
said
in
an
interview
on
the
sidelines
of
a
water
management
conference
in
dushanbe
that
the
bank
would
instead
focus
on
upgrading
another
major
tajik
hydro
plant
the
reason
for
us
not
financing
rogun
is
that
the
government
had
a
number
of
choices
on
how
to
proceed
with
rogun
and
they
wanted
to
accelerate
the
process
and
it
was
felt
that
the
world
bank
would
be
more
helpful
supporting
other
investments
in
the
energy
sector
he
said
in
cooperation
with
the
government
we
decided
to
finance
the
refurbishing
of
the
nurek
power
plant
and
that
will
be
our
major
investment
in
the
energy
sector
at
this
mountainous
tajikistan
one
of
the
poorest
nations
believes
it
ranks
eighth
in
the
world
with
regards
to
hydroelectric
power
potential
but
the
central
asian
country
currently
utilizes
less
than
five
percent
of
that
the
dushanbe
government
has
hired
italy
s
salini
impregilo
to
build
the
world
s
tallest
dam
on
the
vakhsh
river
which
will
power
six
turbines
eliminating
domestic
energy
shortages
and
enabling
exports
of
electric
power
to
countries
such
as
pakistan
and
afghanistan
it
plans
to
launch
the
first
turbine
in
december
and
start
making
cash
from
power
sales
to
finance
further
construction
but
the
project
may
require
additional
financing
before
it
starts
paying
for
itself
tajikistan
indicated
in
february
it
could
issue
more
bonds
to
fund
rogun
and
the
absence
of
world
bank
financing
makes
such
borrowing
more
likely
at
the
same
time
muller
said
improved
relations
between
tajikistan
and
its
neighbor
uzbekistan
which
had
previously
flatly
objected
to
the
dam
construction
create
good
prospects
for
power
exports
the
nurek
power
plant
whose
refurbishment
the
bank
has
agreed
to
partly
finance
with
a
soft
million
loan
produces
of
tajikistan
s
power
