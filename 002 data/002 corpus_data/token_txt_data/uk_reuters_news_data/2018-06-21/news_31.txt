explainer-opec's challenge - to pump more oil and keep deal in place
adds

vienna
june
reuters
for
opec
with
its
oil
deal
is
a
nice
problem
to
have
once
known
for
rampant
cheating
on
agreed
oil
output
targets
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
has
been
on
a
pact
in
place
since
january
cutting
around
one
and
a
half
times
the
promised
amount
the
producer
group
meets
on
friday
to
decide
on
output
policy
amid
calls
from
major
consumers
such
as
the
united
states
india
and
china
to
cool
down
oil
prices
by
producing
more
crude
opec
and
including
russia
have
been
participating
since
last
year
in
a
deal
to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
the
arrangement
runs
to
the
end
of
opec
ministers
meet
their
counterparts
on
saturday
in
practice
the
cut
has
approached
million
bpd
delegates
and
ministers
say
because
of
involuntary
declines
in
countries
including
venezuela
and
angola
as
well
as
voluntary
reductions
by
saudi
arabia
iran
has
so
far
been
the
main
barrier
to
a
new
pact
objecting
to
calls
for
increased
output
but
opec
officials
are
increasingly
confident
a
deal
will
be
reached
sources
said
a
production
rise
of
about
million
bpd
was
emerging
as
a
possible
consensus
for
opec
and
its
allies
adding
that
iran
could
assent
under
certain
conditions
since
an
increase
of
million
bpd
would
shrink
the
cut
to
about
million
bpd
from
million
bpd
it
could
provide
a
compromise
by
keeping
the
existing
deal
while
raising
output
a
key
challenge
is
how
to
share
out
the
million
bpd
or
whatever
increase
is
eventually
agreed
below
are
some
of
the
sums
being
considered
by
opec
and
its
allies
if
all
opec
members
produced
as
much
as
they
were
allowed
under
the
current
deal
opec
output
would
in
theory
rise
by
about
bpd
based
on
reuters
estimates
of
the
group
s
production
in
may
but
in
practice
it
would
mean
a
boost
of
less
than
a
of
that
amount
effectively
from
saudi
arabia
riyadh
is
considered
the
only
opec
member
pumping
that
could
add
significantly
more
at
short
notice
the
current
ratio
of
agreed
opec
cuts
versus
agreed
cuts
is
around
percent
versus
percent
that
means
if
a
million
bpd
output
rise
were
agreed
opec
would
be
allowed
to
increase
output
by
around
bpd
of
which
saudi
arabia
could
contribute
over
bpd
however
questions
remain
over
venezuela
libya
and
angola
whose
declines
can
not
be
reversed
at
short
notice
opec
could
distribute
the
increase
unevenly
to
allow
those
that
can
produce
more
saudi
arabia
kuwait
and
the
united
arab
emirates
to
fill
in
for
those
that
can
not
although
this
could
face
resistance
from
countries
reluctant
to
give
up
market
share
such
as
iran
iran
has
signalled
that
it
would
oppose
any
saudi
move
to
fill
other
producers
supply
gaps
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
wednesday
that
an
opec
output
increase
could
total
around
bpd
opec
s
secretariat
is
looking
at
new
quotas
under
various
scenarios
opec
sources
said
if
the
existing
deal
were
retained
and
the
saudis
felt
a
need
to
add
more
oil
riyadh
could
increase
output
unilaterally
as
it
did
after
a
meeting
in
june
ended
with
no
decision
