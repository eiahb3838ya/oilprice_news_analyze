asian
shares
were
subdued
on
thursday
as
a
lull
in
the
trade
tussle
helped
calm
nerves
enough
for
the
nasdaq
to
reach
a
record
high
while
tensions
in
the
oil
market
grew
ahead
of
an
opec

as
traders
waited
for
new
developments
on
global
trade
the
mere
absence
of
new
threats
from
president
donald
trump
on
tariffs
was
enough
to
stem
recent
selling
with
investors
clinging
to
the
hope
that
all
the
bluster
was
a
ploy
which
would
stop
short
of
an
outright
trade
war
many
participants
see
the
trump
administration
s
hard
line
as
part
of
the
negotiating
strategy
said
richard
grace
chief
currency
strategist
at
cba
markets
had
also
been
encouraged
by
the
people
s
bank
of
china
s
move
to
set
a
strong
fixing
for
its
yuan
on
wednesday
along
with
the
addition
of
extra
liquidity
the
pboc
set
the

rate
stronger
than
expected
yesterday
implying
they
are
not
concerned
and
have
no
intention
of
entering
into
a
currency
war
said
grace
he
noted
there
was
much
speculation
the
central
bank
would
also
cut
bank
reserve
requirements
thus
boosting
lending

the
economy
on

the

not
a
single
analyst
polled
by

expects
a

some
are
getting
