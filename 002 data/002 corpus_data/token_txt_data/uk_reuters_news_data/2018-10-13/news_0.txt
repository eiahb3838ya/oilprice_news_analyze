update 5-trump says u.s. would be 'punishing' itself if it halts saudi arms sales
washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
saturday
the
united
states
would
be
punishing
itself
by
halting
military
sales
to
saudi
arabia
even
if
it
is
proven
that
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
was
killed
inside
the
country
s
consulate
in
istanbul
khashoggi
a
prominent
critic
of
riyadh
and
a
resident
disappeared
on
after
visiting
the
saudi
consulate
turkey
s
government
believes
he
was
deliberately
killed
inside
the
building
and
his
body
removed
trump
has
forged
closer
ties
with
saudi
arabia
and
is
under
international
and
domestic
pressure
to
help
determine
what
happened
to
khashoggi
and
punish
saudi
arabia
if
investigations
show
its
government
had
him
killed
republican
and
democratic
lawmakers
alike
have
demanded
firm
action
there
was
already
mounting
concern
over
civilian
deaths
caused
by
a
military
coalition
in
yemen
s
civil
war
and
some
lawmakers
have
said
washington
should
block
military
sales
to
riyadh
if
the
allegations
over
khashoggi
are
proven
but
trump
is
firmly
opposed
i
actually
think
we
d
be
punishing
ourselves
if
we
did
that
trump
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
there
are
other
things
we
can
do
that
are
very
very
powerful
very
strong
and
we
ll
do
them
he
added
without
saying
what
those
measures
might
be
under
law
major
foreign
military
sales
can
be
blocked
by
congress
an
informal
review
process
lets
key
lawmakers
use
a
practice
known
as
a
hold
to
stall
deals
if
they
have
concerns
such
as
whether
the
weapons
being
supplied
would
be
used
to
kill
civilians
major
defence
contractors
including
lockheed
martin
corp
and
raytheon
co
are
among
the
beneficiaries
of
washington
s
close
ties
to
riyadh
and
would
be
hurt
by
the
halting
of
major
arms
deals
trump
said
on
saturday
his
administration
won
a
billion
military
order
from
saudi
arabia
and
that
the
deal
combined
with
saudi
commitments
to
invest
heavily
in
the
united
states
was
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
if
they
don
t
buy
it
from
us
they
re
going
to
buy
it
from
russia
or
they
re
going
to
buy
it
from
china
he
said
think
of
that
billion
all
they
re
going
to
do
is
give
it
to
other
countries
and
i
think
that
would
be
very
it
was
unclear
what
specific
measures
if
any
trump
is
considering
against
saudi
arabia
which
is
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
and
one
of
his
top
allies
the
trump
administration
plans
to
reimpose
sanctions
on
oil
exports
from
iran
on
and
trump
has
urged
saudi
arabia
to
boost
oil
output
to
help
make
up
for
the
loss
trump
said
he
would
probably
speak
to
saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
over
the
weekend
because
i
think
it
s
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
him
what
s
going
