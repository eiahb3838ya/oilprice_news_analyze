british
energy
company
cuadrilla
said
on
saturday
the
planned
start
of
fracking
a
shale
gas
well
at
its
lancashire
north
west
england
site
has
been
delayed
by
poor
weather
the
privately
owned
company
had
said
on
friday
it
would
commence
fracking
at
the
site
on
saturday
after
a
court
removed
the
final
hurdle
to
the
first
hydraulic
fracturing
in
britain
in
seven
years
but
heavy
rain
and
strong
winds
halted
the
works
we
won
t
actually
be
starting
the
hydraulic
fracturing
pumps
today
due
to
a
brief
delay
with
the
weather
conditions
yesterday
and
this
morning
so
we
ll
therefore
be
starting
on
monday
said
a
cuadrilla
spokesman
the
firm
will
spend
three
months
fracking
two
horizontal
wells
which
involves
injecting
sand
water
and
chemicals
to
split
the
tightly
packed
shale
rock
and
induce
gas
to
flow
out
this
will
be
the
first
fracking
of
a
horizontal
shale
gas
well
since
a
attempt
by
cuadrilla
caused
earth
tremors
prompting
protests
tighter
regulations
and
delays
a
local
resident
wanted
the
fracking
suspended
to
allow
for
a
judicial
review
of
the
local
council
s
safety
procedures
but
a
high
court
judge
dismissed
the
case
on
friday
about
protesters
and
a
small
police
presence
were
at
the
site
on
saturday
