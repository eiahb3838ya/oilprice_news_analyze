german
utility
rwe
might
have
to
cut
jobs
at
its
hambach
site
following
a
court
ruling
that
will
delay
plans
to
expand
the
mine
by
clearing
an
ancient
forest
its
chief
executive
was
quoted
as
saying
on
saturday
ceo
rolf
martin
schmitz
told
the
rheinische
post
newspaper
that
it
was
not
yet
clear
how
many
jobs
would
go
but
it
would
discuss
the
matter
with
trade
unions
and
the
works
council
adding
he
could
not
rule
out
forced
redundancies
a
court
in
the
german
city
of
muenster
ruled
last
week
that
rwe
could
not
start
logging
in
the
hambach
forest
until
a
separate
court
had
reviewed
environmental
claims
which
rwe
said
would
push
back
mining
until
after
and
hit
its
earnings
the
rwe
mine
at
hambach
employs
people
earlier
this
week
rwe
said
output
at
the
mine
would
decline
by
to
million
tonnes
a
year
from
its
current
level
of
million
tonnes
due
to
the
ruling
in
a
separate
interview
published
by
the
frankfurter
allgemeine
zeitung
on
saturday
schmitz
said
the
hit
to
earnings
would
probably
be
about
to
million
euros
million
million
a
year
even
if
the
clearing
is
allowed
to
go
ahead
the
lignite
output
of
the
mine
will
probably
not
reach
previous
levels
with
schmitz
forecasting
a
permanent
reduction
of
about
million
tonnes
a
year
due
to
the
delay
