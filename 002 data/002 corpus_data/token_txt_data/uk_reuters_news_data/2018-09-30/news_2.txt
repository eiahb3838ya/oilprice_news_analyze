iraq
reuters
one
of
the
dominant
kurdish
parties
in
northern
iraq
said
it
would
not
recognise
the
results
of
sunday
s
parliamentary
election
injecting
political
uncertainty
into
a
region
still
demoralised
by
a
failed
independence
bid
the
patriotic
union
of
kurdistan
puk
said
its
decision
to
ignore
the
results
which
have
yet
to
be
announced
was
based
on
what
it
described
as
fraud
in
the
voting
process
the
puk
is
competing
with
its
rival
the
kurdistan
democratic
party
kdp
in
the
election
as
discontent
grows
with
perceived
corruption
and
economic
hardship
with
a
weak
opposition
the
political
dynasties
were
expected
to
extend
their
arrangement
in
the
land
of
six
million
people
which
gained
status
after
the
gulf
war
veteran
kdp
leader
masoud
barzani
has
managed
to
retain
a
support
base
even
though
he
led
an
independence
bid
that
brought
humilition
and
hardship
for
the
kurds
after
military
and
economic
retaliation
from
baghdad
splits
within
the
puk
could
give
the
kdp
an
upper
hand
in
their
arrangement
which
has
been
fraught
with
tensions
while
criticism
of
the
ruling
kurdish
establishment
dominated
for
decades
by
the
barzani
and
the
talabani
families
has
grown
more
vocal
a
weak
opposition
means
many
voters
may
stick
to
traditional
leaders
i
don
t
know
who
i
will
vote
for
but
our
family
has
always
supported
the
kdp
my
son
will
pick
a
candidate
for
me

the

very
weak
said
lawyer
and
independent
observer
belnd
omar
the
number
of
voters
has
shrunk
in
recent
elections
as
the
region
s
stagnant
politics
unpaid
public
sector
salaries
and
corruption
have
undermined
the
population
s
faith
in
politics
observers
from
two
opposition
parties
said
that
some
people
tried
to
use
fake
identification
to
vote
but
were
stopped
though
this
could
not
be
verified
independently
by

kurdish
opposition
parties
did
poorly
when
iraq
held
federal
elections
in
may
but
multiple
allegations
that
the
kdp
and
puk
had
committed
election
fraud
not
confirmed
in
a
subsequent
recount
may
sway
some
voters
in
their
favour
gorran
the
main
opposition
movement
has
been
weakened
by
infighting
and
the
death
of
its
founder
and
leader
nechirvan
mustafa
last
year
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
voted
early
i
gave
my
vote
to
gorran
and
hope
for
the
best

lawyer
hassan
dalloush
also
said
he
was
voting
for
the
opposition
if
there
s
no
fraud
in
this
election
i
ll
feel
good
about
it
but
the
parties
in
power
always
want
to
commit
fraud
it
s
the
only
way
they
stay
in

said
i
will
