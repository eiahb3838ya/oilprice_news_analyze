oil
companies
are
looking
to
expand
refining
operations
to
handle
rising
volumes
of
crude
flowing
from
the
country
s
shale
fields
a
deal
for
prsi
would
give
chevron

oil

that
can
process
about

discussing
a

petrobras
which
is
deeply
in
debt
has
been
seeking
to
divest
billion
in
assets
by
but
has
faced
union
resistance
and
legal
obstacles
a
presidential
election
on
sunday
could
raise
obstacles
for
a
sale
with
jair
bolsonaro
promising
to
install
new
managers
at
the
company
the
prsi
refinery
has
been
limited
in
the
type
of
crude
it
can
run
since
a
fire
which
left
one
of
its
processing
units
idle
a
buyer
would
have
to
invest
to
upgrade
the
refinery
one
of
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
but
prsi
includes
open
land
that
could
enable
a
future
owner
to
easily
expand
the
plant
petrobras
put
the
plant
which
is
on
the
houston
ship
channel
leading
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
has
its
own
export
docks
on
the
market
earlier
this
year
after
sinking
more
than
billion
into
the
operation
since
garfield
miller
chief
executive
of
energy
investment
bank
aegis
energy
advisors
said
the
boom
has
given
a
second
chance
to
plants
designed
to
process
lighter
crudes
several
years
ago
petrobras
would
not
have
been
able
to
sell
prsi
because
of
its
age
and
inability
to
process
heavy
crudes
he
said
that
has
changed
with
the
growth
of
the
permian
basin
the
nation
s
largest
oilfield
which
now
produces
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
according
to
government
figures
anyone
with
crude
in
the
permian
might
logically
want
to
own
it
said
miller
this
refinery
today
has
value
whereas
eight
or
nine
years
ago
it
had
pierre
breber
chevron
s
head
of
refining
and
chemicals
this
month
said
the
company
wanted
to
build
or
buy
a
refinery
along
the
gulf
coast
to
process
oil
from
its
west
texas
operations
chevron
s
shale
output
from
the
region
jumped
percent
in
the
second
quarter
to
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
by
expanding
its
refining
capacity
to
houston
it
would
be
able
to
process
the
crude
closer
to
where
it
is
produced
