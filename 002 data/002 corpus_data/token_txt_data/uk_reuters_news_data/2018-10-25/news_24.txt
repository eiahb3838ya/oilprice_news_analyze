the
crude
oil
market
is
still
uncertain
over
the
likely
impact
of
the
renewed
sanctions
against
iran
but
two
things
seem
to
be
becoming
clearer
iran
is
struggling
to
keep
buyers
and
much
of
the
crude
it
is
shipping
is
being
stored
while
not
quite
a
death
knell
for
iranian
exports
news
that
china
s
two
biggest
state
refiners
sinopec
group
and
china
national
petroleum
corp
cnpc
have
decided
not
to
take
any
cargoes
from
tehran
is
a
serious
blow
china
is
the
biggest
buyer
of
iranian
crude
and
largely
stood
with
the
islamic
republic
during
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
against
its
exports
sinopec
and
cnpc
though
are
now
skipping
bookings
for
november
because
of
uncertainty
over
whether
they
can
secure
waivers
that
allow
their
purchases
to
continue
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
from
the
united
states
will
sanctions
against
iranian
crude
exports
as
part
of
president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
force
tehran
to
accede
to
a
more
restrictive
deal
on
limiting
its
nuclear
and
missile
programmes
while
crude
oil
market
participants
don
t
expect
that
sanctions
will
shut
down
iran
s
exports
completely
there
is
still
debate
over
how
much
oil
is
likely
to
be
lost
and
for
how
long
the
situation
will
persist
what
china
does
is
key
in
this
regard
given
that
it
imported
about
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
according
to
and
port
data
compiled
by
refinitiv
iran
s
crude
exports
have
been
in
the
region
of
about
million
bpd
in
recent
months
and
it
appears
to
be
on
track
to
record
shipments
around
that
level
in
october
iranian
tankers
are
routinely
turning
off
their
tracking
transponders
presumably
to
disguise
their
destinations
making
it
challenging
to
monitor
the
true
state
of
the
nation
s
exports
even
taking
that
into
account
it
s
worth
noting
that
of
the
nine
cargoes
shown
as
arriving
at
their
destinations
in
november
six
are
heading
to
china
one
each
to
india
and
greece
and
one
to
an
as
yet
undetermined
asian
port
there
are
also
questions
over
what
exactly
is
happening
to
the
iranian
crude
arriving
in
china
much
of
the
crude
is
heading
to
the
northern
port
of
dalian
where
it
is
likely
to
end
up
in
bonded
storage
that
would
mean
it
would
be
in
china
but
wouldn
t
have
cleared
customs
and
therefore
unavailable
to
domestic
refiners
this
raises
the
possibility
that
some
of
iran
s
crude
exports
are
in
or
are
headed
into
storage
tanks
and
are
effectively
lost
to
the
market
this
leads
to
a
couple
of
points
to
consider
firstly
that
the
market
is
adjusting
quite
well
already
to
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
and
secondly
that
the
oil
in
storage
at
some
point
will
come
to
market
which
may
depress
demand
from
other
suppliers
when
this
happens
iran
s
other
key
customer
is
india
which
took
about
bpd
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
according
to
the
refinitiv
data
this
has
yet
to
decline
with
october
on
track
for
about
bpd
but
there
are
indications
this
may
be
the
mark
for
a
while
reliance
industries
which
owns
the
world
s
largest
refining
complex
said
on
that
it
has
halted
imports
of
iranian
crude
and
would
buy
from
other
middle
eastern
producers
and
the
united
states
instead
other
indian
refiners
are
still
aiming
to
secure
waivers
for
iranian
imports
but
questions
over
insurance
coverage
may
also
force
them
to
limit
those
shipments
overall
it
appears
both
china
and
india
are
cutting
back
on
buying
crude
from
iran
but
by
how
much
and
for
how
long
still
has
to
be
determined
it
also
appears
that
much
of
iran
s
crude
is
headed
into
storage
and
not
really
available
to
the
market
while
this
will
put
pressure
on
iranian
government
revenues
it
raises
the
possibility
too
of
a
crude
glut
once
the
sanctions
are
finally
eased
