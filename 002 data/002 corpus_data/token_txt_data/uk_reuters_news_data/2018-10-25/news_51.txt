british

fell
by
percent
last
month
hit
by
new
emissions
regulations
model
changes
trade
tensions
and
uncertainty
over
diesel
policy
and
brexit
an
industry
body
said
on
thursday
production
stood
at
units
following
a
percent
drop
in
domestic
demand
and
a
percent
slump
in
exports
the
society
of
motor
manufacturers
and
traders
smmt
said
stricter
emissions
rules
known
as
the
worldwide
harmonised
light
vehicle
test
procedure
wltp
became
mandatory
on
forcing
certain
carmakers
across
europe
to
halt
deliveries
of
some
models
that
had
yet
to
be
britain
s
car
industry
is
also
worried
that
when
the
country
leaves
the
european
union
next
year
customs
checks
and
tariffs
could
be
imposed
if
london
and
brussels
fail
to
strike
a
brexit
deal
adding
more
costs
and
red
tape
it
has
been
a
turbulent
year
and
the
industry
needs
stability
something
which
appears
elusive
given
the
lack
of
resolution
to
brexit
negotiations
said
smmt
ceo
mike
hawes
the
sector
has
also
suffered
due
to
nosediving
demand
for
diesel
and
was
angered
by
a
british
government
announcement
ahead
of
next
week
s
budget
statement
that
subsidies
offered
to
those
buying
hybrid
vehicles
will
be
cut
the
budget
next
week
is
the
perfect
opportunity
to
stimulate
the
market
sending
consumers
and
businesses
the
right
signals
to
encourage
the
purchase
of
new
cars
which
would
help
bolster
economic
performance
as
well
as
delivering
environmental
goals
