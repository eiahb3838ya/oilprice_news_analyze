said
it
supported
a
of
the
rules
to
protect
consumers
from
any
price
spikes
in
heating
and
trucking
fuels
although
it
did
not

some

associations
together
with
the

the
marshall
islands
this

proposed
an
phase

marine
environment

committee
mepc

it
would
require
more
definition
the
proposal
s
backers
were
told
they
could
submit
further
concrete
proposals
for
the
next
mepc
in
may
that
will
leave
little
time
for
deliberations
before
the
regulations
kick
in
nadeau
said
that
to
his
knowledge
there
was
no
discussion
this
week
of
delaying
implementation
of
the
rules
conversations
have
focused
around
problems
that
might
arise
from
the
start
date
including
issues
surrounding
fuel
oil
quality
he
told
reuters
at
a
conference
held
by
the
north
american
marine
environment
protection
association
we
welcome
and
invite
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
mepc
in
may
with
proposals
that
we
ve
developed
working
with
countries
to
help
make
sure
we
have
a
pragmatic
compliance
regime
in
place
as
we
go
forward
