the

where
to
invest
it
some
companies
including
industrial
bellwether
caterpillar
have
already
warned
about
the
impact
on
business
from
import
tariffs
now
that
markets
have
some
element
of
the
confirmation
that
tariffs
are
bringing
actual
impact
to
corporates
there
may
be
a
snowflake
causing
the
avalanche
scenario
as
just
another
factor
of
worry
that
now
needs
to
be
taken
into
consideration

james
stanley
