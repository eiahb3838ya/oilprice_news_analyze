considering
liquidating
its
british
nuclear
unit
nugen
two
people
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
on
thursday
leaving
britain
to
seek
alternatives
for
a
project
that
was
meant
to
provide
percent
of
the
country
s
electricity
the
move
comes
as
toshiba
believes
talks
to
sell
the
unit
have
dragged
on
too
long
the
sources
told
reuters
toshiba
is
eager
to
shut
off
potential
risks
associated
with
nugen
soon
one
of
them
said
both
sources
declined
to
be
identified
as
the
talks
are
private
britain
needs
to
invest
in
new
capacity
to
replace
aging
coal
and
nuclear
reactors
that
are
due
to
close
in
the
but
large
new
plants
especially
nuclear
have
struggled
to
get
off
the
ground
due
to
high
costs
and
weak
electricity
prices
the
nugen
project
in
moorside
northwest
england
faced
setbacks
after
toshiba
s
nuclear
arm
westinghouse
went
bankrupt
last
year
korea
electric
power
corp
kepco
was
initially
the
preferred
bidder
but
lost
that
status
in
july
toshiba
then
negotiated
with
canada
s
brookfield
asset
management
inc
but
the
talks
fell
through
one
of
the
sources
said
the
japanese
conglomerate
is
still
in
discussions
with
kepco
but
as
prospects
for
the
talks
are
unclear
toshiba
has
decided
to
consider
liquidating
nugen
one
of
the
sources
said
when
contacted
by
reuters
toshiba
said
in
a
statement
it
continues
to
consider
additional
options
including
sale
of
its
shares
in
nugen
to
we
are
carefully
monitoring
the
situation
in
consultation
with
stakeholders
including
the
uk
government
it
added
a
kepco
spokesman
said
the
company
is
not
aware
of
toshiba
s
plan
to
liquidate
nugen
toshiba
has
already
written
down
the
value
of
nugen
s
assets
but
has
been
constantly
injecting
cash
in
order
to
keep
the
project
running
operations
at
the
project
have
already
been
scaled
down
and
the
headcount
at
the
project
was
slashed
last
month
to
fewer
than
people
a
spokesman
for
nugen
said
there
is
a
limited
window
of
time
and
the
of
nugen
and
the
moorside
project
remains
a
very
real
prospect
with
toshiba
indicating
clearly
its
intention
to
withdraw
from
the
project
by
the
end
of
the
financial
everything
is
being
done
by
the
teams
at
nugen
and
toshiba
to
minimise
that
prospect
to
enable
toshiba
to
achieve
a
clean
exit
and
to
enable
nugen
and
the
moorside
project
to
continue
the
spokesman
said
