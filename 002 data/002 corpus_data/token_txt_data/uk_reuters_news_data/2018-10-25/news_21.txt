british
investor
martin
taylor
who
closed
his
billion
hedge
fund
nevsky
capital
and
retired
at
plans
to
get
back
in
the
market
with
a
fresh
perspective
and
a
new
firm
in
december
taylor
and
nick
barnes
who
he
considers
a
of
nevsky
told
investors
it
was
not
likely
they
could
reproduce
past
gains
and
gave
clients
their
money
back
it
was
a
rare
move
in
the
industry
and
it
came
after
a
volatile
year
in
financial
markets
with
falls
in
oil
commodities
and
emerging
markets
in
a
colourful
letter
to
investors
taylor
said
nevsky
s
future
returns
would
be
hampered
by
distorted
macroeconomic
data
the
rise
of
highly
unpredictable
nationalist
governments
and
algorithmic
funds
exacerbating
volatility
in
stocks
but
after
nearly
three
years
out
he
is
launching
global
equities
hedge
fund
crake
asset
management
in
october
to
bet
on
shares
and
trade
underlying
commodities
the
strategy
mirrors
that
of
nevsky
i
did
retire
and
i
did
say
i
was
never
going
to
come
back
and
i
absolutely
did
mean
it
at
the
time
but
obviously
i
ve
now
changed
my
mind
said
taylor
who
has
spent
the
past
two
years
teaching
and
trading
his
own
money
with
hindsight
what
i
realised
is
i
was
exhausted
i
d
been
running
a
hedge
fund
manager
for
more
than
years
he
told
reuters
now
i
ve
had
a
sabbatical
it
s
left
me
refreshed
and
i
want
to
do
this
for
another
two
investors
who
declined
to
be
identified
told
reuters
they
welcomed
the
move
the
rise
of
algorithmic
trading
during
his
break
meant
that
by
the
time
he
returns
markets
may
be
closer
to
a
tipping
point
at
which
it
will
become
easier
for
a
fund
like
his
to
make
money
he
said
the
increasing
dominance
of
passive
investors
will
eventually
make
underlying
markets
more
inefficient
because
there
will
be
fewer
and
fewer
genuinely
active
managers
in
the
market
he
said
at
his
new
firm
taylor
will
be
joined
by
yuri
maslov
a
former
partner
at
nevsky
and
richard
walker
who
has
previously
worked
at
societe
generale

to

investment
officer

while
maslov

of
research
and
walker
chief
operating
officer
and
crake
will
also
be
adding
four
to
five
analysts

the
next
several
months
and
aims
to
have
the
team

accepting
outside
money
from
having
had
years
off
i
m
very
keen
to
get
back
to
my
first
love
but
i
want
to

it
properly
that
is
why
it

money
from
clients
