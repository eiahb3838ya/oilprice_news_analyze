with brexit talks in gridlock, british truckers plan for the worst
birmingham
england
reuters
transport
company
boss
chris
blackburn
is
contemplating
spending
almost
a
million
pounds
for
a
chance
to
keep
his
trucks
on
european
roads
if
britain
leaves
the
eu
without
a
deal
in
march
upgrading
the
emissions
standards
of
his
fleet
would
allow
him
to
compete
for
the
annual
european
travel
permits
allocated
for
british
trucks
next
year
competition
will
be
fierce
some
british
trucks
routinely
drive
in
the
eu
and
if
there
is
no
brexit
deal
they
will
only
be
able
to
carry
on
with
a
permit
britain
s
eu
membership
meant
they
have
never
needed
one
before
even
if
blackburn
funds
the
upgrade
there
is
no
guarantee
the
government
will
consider
his
business
moving
industrial
and
construction
equipment
important
enough
to
give
him
permits
losing
access
would
put
a
major
strain
on
his
family
firm
chambers
cook
which
has
annual
revenue
of
around
million
pounds
with
barely
five
months
to
go
britain
has
yet
to
agree
exit
terms
and
companies
do
not
know
how
they
will
trade
with
the
world
s
largest
trading
bloc
blackburn
s
predicament
highlights
the
uncertainty
of
an
industry
which
moves
around
billion
pounds
billion
of
goods
between
britain
and
europe
each
year
to
support
manufacturers
retailers
and
even
musicians
no
or
too
few
permits
would
be
catastrophic
the
said
at
his
birmingham
base
overlooking
the
motorway
it
is
a
gamble
it
s
a
massive
many
businesses
are
preparing
for
the
worst
a
where
newly
installed
customs
checks
delay
the
movement
of
goods
leading
to
tailbacks
and
shattering
supply
chains
for
the
haulage
and
freight
industry
that
means
applying
for
permits
and
international
driving
licenses
increasing
warehouse
space
in
britain
and
europe
ramping
up
customs
capabilities
and
looking
into
european
vehicle
registration
they
are
also
trialing
different
ports
in
case
dover
britain
s
main
gateway
to
europe
becomes
gridlocked
delaying
the
daily
movement
of
up
to
trucks
under
government
plans
two
motorways
and
an
airport
in
the
south
of
england
will
be
used
as
car
parks
if
needed
every
hour
that
a
vehicle
is
standing
costs
pounds
because
they
re
not

richard
burnett
chief
executive
of
the
road
haulage
association
told
reuters
within
weeks
we
would
see
haulage
companies
go
out
of
the
government
says
it
is
confident
of
securing
a
deal
but
that
the
industry
should
prepare
to
use
permits
it
will
also
seek
new
bilateral
agreements
as
quickly
as
possible
if
needed
for
blackburn
the
priority
is
to
get
his
company
into
shape
to
win
as
many
permits
as
possible
so
he
can
then
juggle
his
resources
by
for
instance
allowing
a
driver
set
for
europe
to
pick
up
a
permit
from
one
returning
to
the
uk
the
annual
ecmt
permits
are
issued
by
the
international
transport
forum
each
year
for
travel
in
countries
including
russia
turkey
albania
and
armenia
and
eu
member
states
the
annual
permits
only
for
trucks
meeting
euro
emissions
standards
have
rarely
been
used
by
british
trucks
as
they
typically
only
travel
in
the
eu
britain
will
allocate
them
to
hauliers
based
on
goods
and
travel
frequency
chambers
cook
sends
up
to
trucks
into
europe
a
day
mostly
through
dover
but
it
also
has
operations
in
the
north
east
port
of
immingham
while
the
vast
majority
of
goods
go
via
dover
s
fast
ships
immingham
and
other
ports
offer
unaccompanied
trade
where
loaded
trailers
are
picked
up
around
the
country
dropped
at
the
port
and
left
to
be
loaded
onto
vessels
the
service
is
slower
and
limited
in
its
capacity
however
but
the
fact
that
hauliers
used
to
fast
trade
are
considering
such
options
show
the
level
of
concern
james
colson
overseeing
brexit
planning
for
yusen
logistics
and
its
uk
staff
could
use
portsmouth
and
poole
on
the
south
coast
for
france
and
the
iberian
peninsula
or
harwich
hull
and
newcastle
for
northern
europe
and
scandinavia
they
re
already
pretty
full
hence
why
we
re
starting
now
he
said
of
their
early
trials
colson
hopes
to
get
permits
as
yusen
moves
goods
for
mainstream
sectors
including
automotive
aerospace
pharmaceuticals
and
retail
businesses
operating
in
more
niche
areas
are
worried
that
they
will
not
be
considered
important
enough
for
the
permits
transam
trucking
s
fleet
of
black
trucks
are
built
for
moving
the
stages
screens
and
sound
equipment
used
by
the
likes
of
elton
john
and
iron
maiden
people
are
looking
for
tours
next
summer
and
customers
are
asking
questions
transam
s
natasha
highcroft
told
reuters
only
of
transam
s
trucks
are
euro
emissions
standard
so
this
would
also
limit
permit
use
the
value
of
the
goods
they
move
and
the
tight
timeframes
required
mean
they
could
not
do
unaccompanied
shipping
david
rogers
and
his
em
rogers
moves
cars
all
over
europe
for
testing
he
hopes
they
would
be
a
priority
due
to
britain
s
leading
role
in
the
global
automotive
chain
but
nothing
is
clear
it
s
frightening
he
said
there
aren
t
many
people
who
can
do
what
we
re
doing
rogers
has
a
business
in
the
netherlands
and
could
increase
the
number
of
trucks
registered
there
but
that
is
not
an
option
available
to
many
the
alarm
comes
at
a
difficult
time
for
the
industry
with
many
british
firms
saying
they
have
struggled
to
compete
against
european
companies
with
cheaper
labor
and
diesel
supporters
of
leaving
the
eu
have
always
acknowledged
it
could
cause
short
term
disruption
but
say
ultimately
britain
will
be
freed
of
red
tape
and
able
to
trade
more
widely
a
survey
of
truck
drivers
taken
before
the
referendum
showed
a
majority
backed
brexit
blackburn
talking
next
to
photographs
showing
chambers
cook
trucks
from
the
and
said
he
could
not
understand
why
politicians
were
taking
so
long
to
agree
a
deal
they
ve
had
a
lot
of
time
and
haven
t
achieved
anything
he
said
as
it
s
looking
like
there
s
a
significant
chance
of
no
deal
our
current
plan
is
to
assume
