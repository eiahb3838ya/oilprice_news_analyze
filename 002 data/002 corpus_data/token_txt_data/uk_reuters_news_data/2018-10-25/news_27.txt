injury rates jump at coal giant murray's west virginia mines
oct
reuters
injury
rates
have
more
than
doubled
at
five
west
virginia
coal
mines
acquired
by
murray
energy
in
according
to
a
reuters
review
of
federal
data
as
the
firm
sharply
increased
the
amount
of
coal
produced
per
manhour
although
injuries
and
productivity
rates
rose
over
the
same
period
the
causes
of
the
increase
in
injuries
remain
unknown
and
could
include
a
host
of
factors
in
the
complex
business
of
underground
coal
mining
murray
the
nation
s
largest
underground
coal
mining
company
with
about
employees
producing
more
than
million
tonnes
of
coal
annually
bought
the
mines
from
rival
consol
energy
those
mines
now
account
for
more
than
half
the
firm
s
production
the
injury
rate
at
the
five
mines
averaged
per
work
hours
last
year
up
from
in
the
last
year
consol
operated
them
according
to
data
from
the
mine
safety
and
health
administration
that
s
the
highest
injury
rate
for
the
group
in
a
decade
and
percent
above
the
national
average
for
underground
mines
the
data
show
at
the
same
time
coal
output
per
manhour
at
the
five
mines
rose
nearly
percent
since
to
tons
in
according
to
msha
figures
by
comparison
the
industry
average
in
the
last
year
for
which
data
is
available
was
tons
per
manhour
murray
spokesman
cody
nett
said
that
productivity
has
no
correlation
to
injury
rates
strategies
that
murray
has
used
to
increase
output
at
the
mines
such
as
continuing
production
through
the
overnight
maintenance
shift
and
keeping
machinery
and
vehicles
running
during
shift
changes
are
standard
practices
widely
utilized
throughout
the
industry
nett
said
nett
said
the
injury
rate
at
the
former
consol
mines
was
inflated
by
false
claims
from
workers
who
took
time
off
for
other
reasons
he
also
attributed
the
doubling
of
injury
rates
since
murray
acquired
the
mines
to
by
the
previous
owner
during
the
preceding
years
an
assertion
disputed
by
the
department
of
labor
and
its
mines
safety
and
health
administration
msha
which
collects
the
data
regulators
did
cite
consol
for
in
a
audit
but
msha
later
revised
the
company
s
data
to
include
injuries
that
consol
initially
failed
to
properly
report
said
msha
spokeswoman
amy
louviere
asked
about
the
agency
s
adjustments
nett
said
it
was
flat
out
incorrect
that
the
mine
safety
agency
had
corrected
consol
s
data
consol
spokesman
zach
smith
declined
to
comment
on
the
company
s
reporting
violations
the
injury
rate
at
the
five
mines
translated
to
about
injuries
requiring
days
off
work
in
workers
at
the
five
sites
have
suffered
injuries
so
far
in
according
to
the
msha
data
murray
controls
six
other
mines
in
kentucky
ohio
illinois
and
utah
and
each
has
an
injury
rate
below
the
national
average
according
to
the
data
the
company
has
won
numerous
safety
awards
in
recent
years
including
from
the
government
s
national
institute
of
occupational
safety
and
health
in
davitt
mcateer
a
mine
safety
expert
in
west
virginia
who
had
directed
msha
under
former
president
bill
clinton
said
that
many
factors
could
have
played
into
the
increased
injury
rates
at
the
murray
mines
in
west
virginia
those
particular
mines
are
decades
old
meaning
miners
are
having
to
work
deeper
more
complicated
coal
seams
with
aging
equipment
and
infrastructure
he
said
adding
that
such
conditions
are
more
dangerous
for
workers
the
company
s
ceo
robert
murray
is
among
the
coal
sector
s
most
vocal
advocates
for
rollbacks
of
environmental
and
safety
oversight
frequently
arguing
that
government
regulation
is
unnecessarily
onerous
and
costly
for
companies
murray
energy
has
also
sued
the
government
to
invalidate
an
rule
called
the
pattern
of
violations
rule
intended
to
beef
up
enforcement
of
safety
standards
against
repeat
offenders
that
case
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
is
now
in
settlement
negotiations
with
the
trump
administration
