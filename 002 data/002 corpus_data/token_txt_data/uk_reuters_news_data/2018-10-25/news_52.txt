asian
shares
plunged
on
thursday
as
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
haemorrhaged
from
global

after
a
rout
in

stocks
inflicted
the
largest
daily
decline
on

since
wiping
out
all
its

chinese
shares
were
in
the
red
too
with
the
sse
composite
index
plummeting
percent
as
fresh

by
the
chinese

failed
to
ease

worries
about

sank
percent
if
you
re
a
company
and
you
re
in
charge
of
a
capex
budget
there
is
so
much
uncertainty
about
the
next
few
years
in
terms
of
a
trade
war
in
terms
of
brexit
said
jim
mccafferty
head
of
equity
research
asia
at
nomura
how
as
a
management
team
will
you
decide
how
much
capex
to
invest
and
where
to
invest
it
some
analysts
feel
equity
bears
may
be
better
off
focusing
outside
the
united
states
at
least
for
now
the
pressure
points
in
europe
have
been
flagging
bearish
conditions
for
the
better
part
of
the
past
two
months
said
james
stanley
market
strategist
at
dailyfx
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
larger
equity
then
markets
would
likely
see
some
element
of
correlation
amongst
equity
indices
and
picking
on
the
particularly
weak
areas
of
the
market
may
prove
to
be
a
more
amenable
the
return
of
the
bears
has
already
been
more
pronounced
outside
the
united
states
according
to
data
analysed
by
reuters
in

a
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
study
recently
found
that
percent
of
the
stocks
in
msci
s
global
index
are
now
in
bear
market
territory
weak
readings
on
manufacturing
in
europe
have
added
to
angst
over
world
growth
as
has
a
surprise
slump
in
home
sales
which
suggested
rising
mortgage
rates
were
sapping
demand
for
housing
adding
to
the
air
of
tension
police

suspected

mailed
to

barack
obama
hillary
clinton
and
other
democrats
as
well
as
to
cnn
in
what
new
york
officials
branded
an
act
of
terrorism
the
growing
international
pressure
on
saudi
arabia
over
the
death
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
also
weighed
on
investor
sentiment
on
the
trade
front
disappointing
forecasts
from
industrial
bellwether
caterpillar
weighed
on
wall
street
as
the
giant
warned
of
rising
costs
due
to
import
tariffs
now
that
markets
have
some
element
of
the
confirmation
that
tariffs
are
bringing
actual
impact
to
corporates
there
may
be
a
snowflake
causing
the
avalanche
scenario
as
just
another
factor
of
worry
that
now
needs
to
be
taken
into
consideration
