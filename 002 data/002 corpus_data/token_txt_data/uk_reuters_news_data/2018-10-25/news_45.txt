a
fleet
of
half
a
dozen
tankers
carrying
unsold
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
has
been
floating
in
singapore
and
malaysian
waters
for
up
to
two
weeks
as
winter
demand
in
asia
looks
weaker
than
initially
expected
traders
said
on
thursday
the
ships
together
carry
around
a
million
cubic
metres
of
lng
worth
more
than
million
at
current
spot
market
prices
one
of
them
adam
lng
is
carrying
cubic
metres
of
lng
that
originated
from
the
arctic
yamal
project
in
russia
with
refinitiv
eikon
ship
tracking
data
showing
the
cargo
to
be
open
for
orders
the
lng
cargoes
were
purchased
ahead
of
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
season
said
several
traders
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
declining
to
be
named
as
they
were
not
allowed
to
speak
publicly
about
commercial
operations
everyone
floated
cargoes
last
month
with
a
steep
contango
over
october
to
november
and
they
now
can
t
find
homes
for
these
floating
cargoes
an
lng
broker
said
contango
means
prices
for
future
delivery
are
higher
than
those
for
immediate
dispatch
making
it
attractive
for
traders
to
hold
on
to
cargoes
for
later
sale
many
traders
were
also
hoping
for
a
repeat
of
last
winter
when
lng
spiked
to
highs
of
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
as
the
top
three
importers
japan
china
and
south
korea
scrambled
to
meet
demand
amid
china
s
gasification
programme
unusually
cold
weather
and
widespread
nuclear
power
outages
some
merchants
were
hoping
for
another
price
this
year
and
hoped
importers
would
stock
up
more
to
prevent
being
caught
short
said
one
trader
in
singapore
that
s
not
happened
at
least
yet
as
weather
outlooks
suggest
a
relatively
mild
winter
and
because
a
lot
of
nuclear
reactors
especially
in
japan
have
returned
to
service
he
said
japan
is
expected
to
experience
weather
between
november
and
january
the
country
s
official
forecaster
said
this
week
implying
low
demand
for
heating
the
japan
meteorological
agency
as
well
as
australia
s
bureau
of
meteorology
both
said
this
month
there
was
a
percent
chance
an
el
nino
weather
pattern
could
emerge
this
year
causing
unusually
warm
winters
in
the
northern
hemisphere
japan
is
the
world
s
top
lng
importer
but
its
purchases
could
also
fall
as
it
restarts
nuclear
power
plants
that
were
shut
down
after
the
reactor
meltdown
at
fukushima
in
nine
reactors
have
received
regulatory
approval
to
restart
with
seven
of
them
already
in
operation
more
than
most
analysts
had
expected
storing
unsold
lng
tankers
is
costly
as
these
are
among
the
most
expensive
merchant
vessels
to
hire
and
operate
there
is
still
a
contango
for
january
prices
over
december
which
is
around
per
mmbtu
a
trader
said
but
with
lng
freight
rates
at
highs
of
more
than
per
day
up
from
a
day
in
september
storing
lng
on
tankers
would
eat
up
any
profit
from
the
spread
