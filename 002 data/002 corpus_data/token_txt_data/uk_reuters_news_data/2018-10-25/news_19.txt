attempted
a
rebound
on
thursday
after
wall
street
s

day
since
and
heavy
losses
in

another
boot
towards
their
worst

a

was
emerging
the

out
of
positive
territory
while

remain
prominent
draghi
said
at
the
ecb
s
news
conference
significant
monetary
policy
stimulus
is
still
needed
he
said
but
there
was
also
an
important
summary
is
this
turbulence
enough
to
change
our
baseline
scenario
no
adding
that
he
expected
an
agreement
between
italy
and

investors
have

increasingly
nervous
about

faster

hikes
in
the

italy
and
a

that
threatens
to

almost
percent
of

in

are
now
in

down
percent
or
more
from
their
most
recent

there
has
also
been
growing
concerns
about

by
italy

trillion
pan
shares
skidded
more
than
percent
while
japan
s
nikkei
tumbled
as
much
as
percent
to

the
one
relief
was
that
chinese
shares
managed
to
close
in
the
black
after
dropping
as
much
as
percent
at
one
point
fresh
government
support
measures
had
failed
to
ease
worries
about
high
leverage
and
the
tariff
war
with
the
united
states
if
you
re
a
company
and
you
re
in
charge
of
a
capex
budget
there
is
so
much
uncertainty
about
the
next
few
years
in

of
a

in
terms
of

said
jim
mccafferty
head

asia
at

europe
s
stabilisation
was
aided
by
results
from
swiss
bank
ubs
and
engineering
giant
abb
which
helped
take
the
edge
off
jitters
caused
this
week
by
a
gloomy
tariffs
warning
from
the
behemoth
caterpillar
wall
street
snapped
its
losing
streak
as
reassuring
results
from
microsoft
and
strong
advertising
revenues
from
twitter
brought
some
timely
cheer
to
tech
stocks
alphabet
and
amazon
were
both
up
more
than
percent
ahead
of
their
results
later
too
while
wider
economy
watchers
were
reassured
as
the
number
of
americans
receiving
benefits
fell
to
a
more
than
low
the
ecb
s
steady

she
goes
message
came
after
weak
euro
zone
economic
data
this
week
added
to
angst
over
world
growth
and
a
surprising
slump
in
home
sales
which
suggested
rising
mortgage
rates
were
sapping
demand
for

it
was
not
just
the
ecb
in

either
turkey
which
has
stabilised
in
recent
weeks
after
having
been
at
the
centre
of
emerging
market
troubles
halted
its
recent
rate
hikes
in
a
move
that
for
once
did
not
unsettle
markets
in
fact
the
lira
gained
the

has
almost
doubled
its

already
this
year
to

after
a
percent

in
the
turkish

pushed
ankara
to
the
brink
of
a

crisis
in
the
main
foreign

markets
the
euro
recovered
to
having
breached
a
bulwark
of

a
basket
of

the

eased
from
near
a
peak
to
for
the
first
time
in
days
it
was
barely
budged
against
the
japanese

inched
off
a
trough
to
having
dropped
percent
overnight
and

began
to
tick
up
again

been
dragged
down
in
