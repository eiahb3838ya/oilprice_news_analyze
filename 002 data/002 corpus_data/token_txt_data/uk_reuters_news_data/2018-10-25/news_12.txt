reported
a
bigger
third
quarter
profit
on
thursday
topping
expectations
with
a
boost
from
higher
crude
oil
prices
canadian
oil
producers
have
struggled
with
transportation
bottlenecks
to
refineries
as
output
has
surged
pushing
canadian
prices
to
discounts

light
crude

ka
shing
is
an
integrated
producer
however
and
owns
refineries
dedicated
pipeline
space
and
some
production
offshore
where
crude
transport
is
less
congested
that
integration
allowed
husky
to
tap
into
higher
global
oil
prices
leaving
it
essentially
unaffected
by
the
wide
differential
between
canadian
heavy
and
light
crude
chief
executive
rob
peabody
said
on
a
conference
call
such
differentials
are
likely
to
remain
large
through
until
added
pipeline
capacity
is
available
he
said
even
with
big
discounts
on
canadian
crude
it
does
not
necessarily
make
sense
to
reduce
production
and
instead
buy
barrels
cheaply
from
other
producers
struggling
to
transport
them
peabody
said
shutting
down
oil

projects
can
damage

peabody
said
husky
and
meg

board
have
not
spoken
directly
about
a

since
making
the
offer
that
doesn
t
surprise
me
there
is
a
bit
of
a
i
don
t
want
to
say
dance
it
is
incumbent
on
their

to
understand
if
there
is
any
potential
for
