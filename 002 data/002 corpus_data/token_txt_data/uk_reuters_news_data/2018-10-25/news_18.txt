making
progress
in
increasing

with

to
lift
oil

not

including
the
international
energy
agency
expect
slower
growth
in

oil
demand
next

rising
supplies
from

could
further

top
exporter
saudi
arabia
said
the
oil
market
could
be
oversupplied
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
year
as
stocks
rise
and
demand
slows
it
said
it
will
mirror
such
changes
in
its
production
we
are
of
the
view
that
the
market
in
the
fourth
quarter
could
be
shifting
towards
an
oversupply
situation
as
evidenced
by
rising
inventories
over
the
past
few
weeks
