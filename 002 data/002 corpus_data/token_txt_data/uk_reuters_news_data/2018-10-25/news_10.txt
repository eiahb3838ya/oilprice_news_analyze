analysis-u.s. shale producers eye global pricing as exports surge
new
york
reuters
three
years
after
a
ban
on
crude
oil
exports
was
lifted
some
shale
producers
are
doing
something
they
have
never
done
before
lock
in
prices
for
their
barrels
that
will
find
a
home
overseas
shale
companies
primarily
those
operating
in
the
permian
basin
the
biggest
oilpatch
are
finding
new
ways
of
insulating
themselves
from
the
wide
discount
of
west
texas
intermediate
crude
futures
wti
to
the
global
benchmark
brent
in
the
second
quarter
as
wti
s
discount
to
brent
whipsawed
and
widened
to
the
most
in
over
three
years
wpx
energy
inc
sm
energy
co
and
oasis
petroleum
inc
began
quietly
erecting
specialized
hedges
a
reuters
analysis
of
company
filings
found
the
hedges
the
first
of
their
kind
for
these
producers
protect
against
that
discount
widening
as
their
oil
increasingly
gets
sold
to
foreign
buyers
the
hedged
volumes
are
relatively
small
but
indicate
the
rising
importance
of
export
revenues
as
the
plays
an
increasingly
dominant
role
as
a
global
oil
supplier
oil
production
is
near
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
depressing
the
price
of
wti
versus
brent
while
also
spurring
an
export
boom
since
the
lifting
of
a
ban
in
crude
exports
surged
to
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
june
traders
closely
watch
the
spread
between
the
two
benchmarks
to
gauge
export
economics
while
a
wider
discount
makes
oil
attractive
to
foreign
buyers
for
producers
it
means
weaker
revenues
locking
the
spread
in
protects
revenues
permian
producers
have
long
protected
future
revenue
through
financial
instruments
but
they
have
typically
been
solely
linked
to
wti
that
is
changing
according
to
filings
and
interviews
with
brokers
bankers
hedging
consultants
and
company
executives
previously
all
of
our
sales
would
be
really
tied
to
domestic
indices
said
todd
scruggs
vice
president
and
treasurer
of
wpx
energy
the
fact
that
we
can
have
our
barrels
sold
internationally
is
a
new
thing
and
we
re
happy
to
take
advantage
of
companies
identified
a
price
in
this
case
for
wti
to
trade
at
a
discount
of
around
a
barrel
to
brent
and
use
contracts
known
as
basis
swaps
to
lock
in
prices
at
that
level
basis
swaps
have
become
popular
among
permian
producers
to
manage
the
spread
between
regional
oil
prices
in
west
texas
against
futures
but
now
companies
are
using
the
swaps
to
hedge
brent
versus
wti
in
the
second
quarter
wpx
used
basis
swaps
to
hedge
bpd
of
production
at
a
wti
discount
to
brent
if
two
years
from
now
brent
trades
at
a
barrel
and
wti
at
wpx
effective
price
will
be
when
we
lock
in
the
spread
we
re
effectively
ensuring
that
the
sales
arrangements
that
we
ve
made
will
stay
in
the
money
going
forward
said
scruggs
wpx
however
could
be
exposed
if
that
spread
were
to
contract
to
a
level
narrower
than
the
fixed
price
wti
currently
trades
at
about
below
brent
during
the
second
quarter
the
spread
went
from
about
to
as
much
as
this
hedging
practice
is
likely
to
gain
prominence
given
rising
crude
exports
and
shale
producers
looking
to
capture
the
higher
prices
available
on
world
markets
said
john
saucer
a
vice
president
at
advisers
mobius
risk
group
sm
energy
hedged
about
million
barrels
for
at
a
discount
with
additional
volumes
hedged
through
an
sm
energy
spokeswoman
said
such
swaps
are
a
small
component
of
its
overall
hedging
strategy
sm
energy
s
basis
swaps
cover
a
portion
of
its
midland
production
with
sales
contracts
that
settle
at
ice
brent
prices
according
to
a
securities
filing
oasis
petroleum
hedged
barrels
or
nearly
percent
of
production
at
a
differential
and
slightly
more
volumes
in
at
the
same
price
the
company
which
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
recently
acquired
acreage
in
the
permian
and
operates
in
north
dakota
s
bakken
region
there
may
be
soon
be
more
efficient
ways
to
lock
in
prices
for
oil
exports
as
new
gulf
coast
futures
which
are
based
on
pricing
in
houston
rather
than
at
the
cushing
oklahoma
storage
hub
are
launched
however
infrastructure
bottlenecks
at
coastal
ports
could
cap
exports
keeping
wti
depressed
banks
are
making
a
big
push
to
offer
differentiated
hedging
solutions
