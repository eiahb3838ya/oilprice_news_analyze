china
s
diesel
demand
has
peaked
and
gasoline
will
peak
in
while
natural
gas
demand
will
increase
over
the
next
two
decades
to
feed
a
massive
gasification
campaign
according
to
a
forecast
released
on
tuesday
by
a
research
arm
on
a
state
energy
group
the
research
unit
of
china
national
petroleum
corp
cnpc
also
said
that
china
s
total
oil
demand
will
top
out
at
around
million
tonnes
a
year
or
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
china
the
world
s
top
crude
oil
importer
will
maintain
annual
crude
oil
production
of
million
tonnes
or
about
million
barrels
per
day
before
cnpc
said
demand
for
diesel
is
waning
amid
moderating
economic
growth
and
tighter
environmental
scrutiny
while
gasoline
demand
is
capped
by
slowing
growth
in
private
car
sales
and
the
rise
of
electric
and
natural
vehicles
one
of
the
government
s
recent
plans
is
to
replace
a
million
diesel
trucks
almost
percent
of
the
national
fleet
with
ones
that
burn
cleaner
fuels
such
as
natural
gas
and
diesel
as
beijing
ramps
up
its
war
on
pollution
this
would
be
a
blow
to
china
s
oil
refineries
as
diesel
is
a
main
contributor
to
its
fuel
sales
revenue
as
additions
to
china
s
refining
capacity
outpace
the
nation
s
fuel
demand
growth
more
than
million
tonnes
of
surplus
fuel
is
forecast
for
cnpc
said
the
country
s
natural
gas
demand
will
reach
billion
cubic
metres
bcm
by
cnpc
also
said
that
represents
percent
growth
from
the
consumption
level
for
domestic
gas
production
is
expected
to
reach
bcm
by
the
forecast
said
more
than
doubling
the
bcm
produced
last
year
china
s
campaign
to
clear
its
skies
has
increased
demand
for
the
fuel
and
will
keep
it
reliant
on
imports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
and
piped
gas
demand
for
the
fuel
has
risen
nearly
percent
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
cnpc
also
brought
forward
the
timeline
for
peak
total
energy
demand
for
the
world
s
economy
to
from
a
previous
forecast
of
