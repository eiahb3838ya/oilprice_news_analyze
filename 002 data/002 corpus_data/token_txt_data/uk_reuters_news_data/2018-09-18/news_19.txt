eu countries agree to explore hydrogen as energy source
brussels
reuters
european
union
energy
ministers
agreed
on
tuesday
to
pool
efforts
to
increase
the
use
of
hydrogen
in
transport
and
power
as
part
of
the
bloc
s
attempt
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
percent
by
the
initiative
seen
by
reuters
and
endorsed
by
eu
nations
calls
for
governments
to
increase
cooperation
on
research
into
the
potential
for
hydrogen
use
in
energy
storage
transport
power
and
heating
the
acceleration
of
early
implementation
and
wider
application
of
sustainable
hydrogen
technology
is
able
to
contribute
to
the
economic
competitiveness
of
the
energy
union
the
document
said
agreed
by
energy
ministers
at
an
informal
meeting
in
linz
austria
the
document
highlights
the
need
for
renewable
energy
such
as
hydrogen
to
reduce
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
for
which
europe
is
reliant
on
imports
from
russia
technologies
fuelled
by
hydrogen
one
of
the
world
s
most
abundant
elements
have
long
held
promise
but
uptake
has
been
slow
germany
on
monday
began
running
the
world
s
first
passenger
trains
powered
by
hydrogen
fuel
cells
replacing
two
trains
on
a
line
of
nearly
km
miles
between
cuxhaven
and
buxtehude
in
lower
saxony
germany
is
leading
efforts
in
the
eu
to
explore
ways
to
use
and
store
renewable
energy
at
a
number
of
and
sites
as
a
boom
in
wind
and
solar
power
in
the
country
has
led
to
excess
production
running
renewable
power
through
water
to
split
it
into
oxygen
and
hydrogen
via
electrolysis
produces
green
hydrogen
that
can
be
used
in
transport
or
gas
grids
which
can
absorb
percent
hydrogen
as
a
complementary
fuel
to
natural
gas
carmakers
such
as
toyota
have
touted
the
benefits
of
hydrogen
vehicles
which
take
less
time
to
refuel
than
the
recharging
of
battery
electric
cars
but
are
expensive
and
suffer
from
a
lack
of
refuelling
stations
so
far
the
technology
has
mostly
been
used
in
buses
and
trucks
