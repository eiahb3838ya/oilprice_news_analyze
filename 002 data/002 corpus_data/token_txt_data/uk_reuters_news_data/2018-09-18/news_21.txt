who
s
afraid
of
the
big
bad
trade
war
not
world
stock
markets
it
seems
the
response
to
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
go
ahead
next
week
with
collecting
percent
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
ratcheting
up
to
percent
in
january
was
unusual
and
unexpected
on
tuesday
trump
s
measures
initially
hit
stocks
treasuries
and
the
dollar
while
stirring
a
rally
in
chinese
equities
and
the
yuan
china
then
retaliated
just
before
markets
were
due
to
open
with
billion
worth
of
tariffs
of
its
own
but
still
traders
barely
flinched
european
stocks
wobbled
slightly
but
wall
street
futures
still
pointed
to
a
steady
start
and
even
copper
and
the
aussie
dollar
which
have
been
highly
sensitive
to
the
trade
tensions
made
good
ground
in
a
way
it
is
remarkable
that
the
market
is
holding
up
so
well
said
rabobank
s
head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
this
is
clearly
a
further
ratcheting
up
of
the
trade
war
and
we
are
now
getting
close
to
a
situation
where
you
can
almost
speak
of
a
trade
war
clearly
that
is
not
one
theory
for
the
becalmed
reaction
was
that
the
billion
move
had
been
largely
priced
in
to
markets
following
weeks
of
hinting
reports
and
social
media
speculation
chinese
shares
had
initially
dipped
as
asia
digested
the
details
but
then
rallied
to
close
up
percent
as
some
locals
bet
on
beijing
stepping
up
infrastructure
investment
to
keep
the
economy
humming
japan
s
nikkei
also
ended
percent
higher
and
msci
s
emerging
market
index
was
up
for
the
fourth
day
in
the
last
five
as
percent
gains
in
poland
and
russia
added
to
asia
s
rebound
trump
s
announcement
is
largely
consistent
with
the
claims
made
earlier
citi
analysts
said
in
a
note
estimating
a
basis
point
drag
on
china
s
economic
growth
from
the
percent
tariff
taking
a
bigger
picture
view
dutch
bank
ing
estimated
that
percent
of
world
trade
was
now
affected
by
the
tariffs
and
it
will
be
percent
if
trump
carries
out
threats
to
put
levies
on
all
of
the
s
chinese
imports
although
this
percentage
may
seem
small
the
tariffs
will
disrupt
supply
chains
and
may
therefore
triple
the
effects
on
world
trade
ing
also
warned
stock
exchange
futures
were
all
around
percent
higher
with
a
rise
in
oil
prices
expected
to
lift
oil
majors
and
on
relief
that
the
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
had
spared
gadgets
like
smart
watches
china
s
promise
to
respond
to
the
moves
also
came
as
the
south
china
morning
post
newspaper
reported
that
beijing
was
reviewing
plans
to
send
a
delegation
headed
by
vice
premier
liu
he
to
washington
for
trade
talks
foreign
ministry
spokesman
geng
shuang
told
a
daily
news
briefing
later
that
the
steps
had
brought
new
uncertainty
to
talks
between
the
two
countries
china
has
always
emphasised
that
the
only
correct
way
to
resolve
the
trade
issue
is
via
talks
and
consultations
held
on
an
equal
sincere
and
mutually
respectful
basis
but
at
this
time
everything
the
united
states
does
does
not
give
the
impression
of
sincerity
or
goodwill
he
added
not
to
be
outdone
trump
later
tweeted
there
will
be
great
and
fast
economic
retaliation
against
china
if
our
farmers
ranchers
industrial
workers
are
targeted
despite
all
the
noise
the
dollar
currency
index
was
broadly
flat
at
although
on
an
individual
basis
it
rose
against
the
japanese
yen
to
just
over
and
took
percent
off
turkey
s
troubled
lira
at
the
same
time
it
was
down
slightly
against
the
chinese
yuan
in
offshore
markets
the
sensitive
australian
dollar
also
moved
up
percent
to
having
also
initially
been
hit
when
the
tariff
details
broke
with
fx
participants
wary
that
beijing
authorities
may
quickly
step
in
to
markets
at
any
point
investors
were
spontaneously
liquidating
their
short
yuan
positions
said
a
trader
at
one
chinese
bank
china
is
likely
to
reject
the
invitation
from
the
treasury
for
the
new
round
of
trade
talk
ocbc
bank
also
said
in
a
note
on
tuesday
oil
prices
had
been
down
in
asia
and
through
most
of
the
european
morning
session
but
then
went
on
a
tear
as
fresh
signs
emerged
that
opec
doesn
t
plan
to
raise
output
to
offset
shrinking
supplies
from
iran
international
benchmark
brent
futures
jumped
over
a
dollar
to
per
barrel
while
crude
futures
bounced
up
to
just
shy
of
a
barrel
copper
prices
surged
percent
too
and
gold
had
also
clawed
itself
into
positive
territory
at
having
been
struggling
for
most
of
the
day
