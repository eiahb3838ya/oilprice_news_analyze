kottmann
said
it
was
important

and
said
the
billion
in
sales
the

was
still
the
number
which
is
important

us
the
move
now
is
a
first
move
into

direction
i
m
sure
that
we
will
have
more
opportunities
in

to
come
to
further
go
into
higher
value
specialities
and
to
strengthen
our
business
areas

middle
eastern

have
been
eager
to
expand

advanced
downstream
chemicals
operations

the
catalysts
that

oil
company
saudi
aramco
in
bought
half
the
synthetic
rubber
business
of
germany
s
lanxess
for
around
billion
euros
the
moves
show
that
saudi
companies
are
increasingly
trying
to
raise
their
influence
outside
the
kingdom
as
part
of
the
ambitious
vision
plan
which
was

generate
annual
synergies
of
around
million
swiss
francs
over
three
years
from
the
deal
s
closing
it
would
cost

of
and
significantly
boost

in
the
first
year
under
the
governance
agreement
clariant

directors
will
expand

rating
untouched
it
said
