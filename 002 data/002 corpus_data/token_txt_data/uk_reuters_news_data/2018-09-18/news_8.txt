the
world
agency
wada
should
postpone
this
week
s
decision
on
whether
to
reinstate
russia
s
agency
rusada
leaders
said
on
tuesday
national
bodies
from
around
the
world
including
ones
from
the
united
states
britain
and
australia
said
in
a
joint
statement
that
wada
should
not
reinstate
rusada
until
russia
can
prove
it
has
fulfilled
the
wada
roadmap
to
code
compliance
wada
s
executive
committee
is
set
to
meet
on
thursday
to
review
rusada
s
efforts
towards
reinstatement
rusada
was
suspended
in
november
over
a
wada
report
outlining
evidence
of
systematic
doping
in
russian
athletics
it
has
since
undertaken
broad
reforms
in
a
bid
to
revamp
russia
s
system
and
restore
international
trust
in
the
country
s
sport
according
to
the
wada
roadmap
for
the
agency
to
regain
accreditation
russian
authorities
must
acknowledge
the
findings
of
a
report
that
found
more
than
russian
athletes
benefited
from
a
scheme
to
conceal
positive
tests
over
a
period
russia
has
vehemently
denied
those
allegations
the
authorities
must
also
provide
access
to
urine
samples
stored
at
the
suspended
moscow
laboratory
wada
said
last
week
that
its
compliance
review
committee
had
reviewed
a
letter
from
the
russian
sports
ministry
it
said
had
sufficiently
acknowledged
the
issues
identified
in
russia
thus
fulfilling
the
first
of
two
remaining
criteria
for
its
reinstatement
but
the
group
of
leaders
which
also
includes
austria
canada
finland
germany
ireland
japan
netherlands
new
zealand
norway
and
poland
said
it
was
dismayed
by
what
it
called
a
compromise
by
wada
s
compliance
review
committee
we
can
not
understand
or
accept
that
the
simple
fact
that
the
two
remaining
conditions
regarding
russian
acceptance
of
the
mclaren
report
and
access
for
wada
to
the
moscow
laboratory
remain
unfulfilled
and
yet
wada
s
leading
compliance
body
is
recommending
the
reinstatement
of
a
country
that
perpetrated
the
worst
doping
system
ever
seen
in
international
sport
the
bodies
said
in
a
statement
the
statement
added
we
the
international
leaders
wish
to
place
on
record
that
the
goal
posts
have
been
moved
the
roadmap
has
changed
this
is
quite
simply
unacceptable
and
will
not
restore
confidence
in
global
sport
at
a
time
when
athletes
and
sports
fans
need
it
the
group
also
said
wada
should
postpone
any
decision
until
russia
has
clearly
and
publicly
met
the
outstanding
conditions
of
the
roadmap
to
code
compliance
and
until
it
is
in
possession
of
the
data
from
the
moscow
lab
now
is
not
the
time
for
wada
to
on
its
roadmap
the
group
said
it
is
not
the
time
for
wada
to
turn
its
back
on
the
majority
the
clean
athletes
and
sports
