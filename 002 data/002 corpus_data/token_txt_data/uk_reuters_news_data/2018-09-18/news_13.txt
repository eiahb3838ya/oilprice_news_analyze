germany
will
chose
where
to
build
a
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
terminal
by
the
end
of
as
a
gesture
to
the
united
states
which
wants
to
ship
more
gas
to
europe
the
economy
minister
said
on
tuesday
in
a
bid
to
deter
president
donald
trump
from
imposing
hefty
new
trade
tariffs
on
european
union
goods
the
eu
said
in
july
it
would
work
to
increase
imports
of
soybeans
and
lng
trump
wants
lng
to
compete
with
russian
natural
gas
exports
in
europe
he
has
accused
germany
of
being
a
captive
to
moscow
because
of
its
heavy
reliance
on
russian
gas
and
has
called
for
berlin
to
drop
support
for
the
billion
nord
stream
pipeline
plan
to
pump
more
gas
from
russia
to
germany
this
is
a
gesture
to
our
american
friends
peter
altmaier
said
of
plans
to
decide
on
a
site
for
the
lng
terminal
we
have
three
competing
cities
and
we
will
take
a
decision
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
said
after
meeting
maros
sefcovic
the
european
commission
vice
president
and
eu
energy
chief
but
altmaier
said
the
lng
plan
was
not
related
to
germany
s
support
for
nord
stream
which
he
told
reporters
was
a
project
that
has
a
long
life
already
and
much
money
has
been
at
talks
in
brussels
altmaier
and
sefcovic
discussed
the
future
of
gas
transit
via
ukraine
the
traditional
route
for
russian
gas
supplies
that
make
up
more
than
a
third
of
eu
needs
critics
of
the
nord
stream
pipeline
say
it
will
deprive
ukraine
of
lucrative
gas
transit
fees
and
increase
dominance
of
russian
gas
monopoly
gazprom
altmaier
repeated
germany
s
request
for
moscow
to
continue
to
send
substantial
supplies
via
ukraine
after
their
contract
expires
in
but
did
not
put
a
figure
on
volumes
sefcovic
said
volumes
had
to
be
substantial
enough
to
pay
for
maintenance
of
ukraine
s
gas
pipeline
infrastructure
he
also
said
the
united
states
had
to
do
more
to
make
its
gas
exports
competitive
on
european
markets
german
firms
are
considering
building
an
lng
terminal
as
gas
demand
rises
in
europe
and
the
netherlands
one
of
germany
s
crucial
suppliers
which
is
winding
down
its
giant
groningen
field
and
plans
to
close
it
in
german
utility
uniper
said
on
monday
it
was
ready
to
import
lng
and
distribute
it
should
a
terminal
be
built
at
wilhelmshaven
close
to
its
storage
facilities
