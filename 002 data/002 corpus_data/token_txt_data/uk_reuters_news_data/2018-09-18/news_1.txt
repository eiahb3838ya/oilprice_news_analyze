update 1-trump administration eases rule on methane leaks on public land
washington
reuters
the
trump
administration
on
tuesday
rolled
back
an
rule
on
emissions
of
the
greenhouse
gas
methane
from
oil
and
gas
operations
on
public
lands
in
its
latest
step
to
ease
regulations
on
the
industry
the
waste
prevention
rule
was
aimed
at
reducing
leaks
of
natural
gas
or
methane
that
occur
through
venting
and
flaring
during
oil
and
gas
production
on
federal
land
david
bernhardt
the
interior
department
s
deputy
secretary
said
revisions
to
the
rule
reflect
president
donald
trump
s
policy
avoiding
regulatory
burdens
that
unnecessarily
encumber
energy
production
constrain
growth
and
prevent
job
environmentalists
slammed
the
rollback
of
the
rule
which
will
not
be
implemented
until
after
a
comment
period
the
trump
administration
is
relentless
in
its
push
to
give
the
oil
and
gas
industry
handouts
at
the
expense
of
americans
health
and
environment
said
david
doniger
the
natural
resource
defense
council
s
senior
strategic
director
for
climate
and
clean
energy
revisions
to
the
plan
include
changes
to
the
percentage
of
methane
that
must
be
captured
at
drilling
locations
and
measures
on
well
completions
and
leak
detections
the
department
said
the
obama
administration
had
said
that
venting
of
methane
cost
taxpayers
over
million
a
year
in
lost
revenue
from
natural
gas
but
industry
complained
that
the
waste
prevention
rule
would
be
costly
on
public
lands
where
percent
of
oil
and
percent
of
gas
is
produced
and
that
states
with
public
lands
already
had
their
own
regulations
on
the
emissions
the
rule
was
challenged
in
court
by
the
industry
and
some
states
including
wyoming
the
interior
department
said
the
rule
would
have
had
a
net
cost
of
billion
to
billion
over
years
the
trump
administration
s
revisions
would
save
drillers
about
million
to
billion
over
years
and
lead
to
more
royalty
payments
that
benefit
the
public
the
department
said
methane
is
a
major
force
in
global
warming
because
it
has
more
than
times
the
potential
of
carbon
dioxide
in
the
first
years
after
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
scientists
say
the
oil
and
gas
business
is
the
largest
single
source
of
the
emissions
according
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
last
week
trump
s
epa
proposed
weakening
requirements
for
testing
and
repairing
methane
leaks
in
drilling
operations
the
latest
step
toward
rolling
back
regulations
to
combat
climate
change
california
attorney
general
xavier
becerra
who
has
sued
the
administration
over
delays
in
implementation
of
the
rules
said
his
state
will
do
everything
in
our
power
to
hold
them
accountable
to
our
people
