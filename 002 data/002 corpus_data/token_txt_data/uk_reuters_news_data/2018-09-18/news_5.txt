china
set
a
percent
tariff
on
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
imports
extending
a
trade
dispute
into
energy
and
casting
a
shadow
over
export
terminals
that
would
propel
the
united
states
into
the
world
s
lng
seller
beijing
on
tuesday
said
it
would
tax
products
worth
billion
effective
in
retaliation
for
tariffs
imposed
by
president
donald
trump
in
an
escalating
trade
war
the
rate
was
smaller
than
the
percent
tariff
china
had
touted
earlier
which
offered
some
relief
and
helped
shares
in
listed
lng
companies
climb
the
tariffs
undermine
trump
s
drive
to
use
shale
oil
and
natural
gas
to
turn
the
united
states
into
a
global
energy
leader
the
is
on
track
to
export
over
billion
cubic
feet
bcf
of
gas
as
lng
in
one
billion
cubic
feet
is
enough
to
fuel
about
million
homes
for
a
day
but
china
which
purchased
about
percent
of
all
lng
shipped
in
is
now
on
track
to
buy
less
than
bcf
of
lng
in
less
than
last
year
according

the

proposed
export
terminals
many
expected
to
supply
chinese
customers
were
expected
to
account
for
percent
of
all
new

production
coming
to

according
to

data
lng
which
involves
natural
gas
so
it
can
be
transported
by
ship
rather
than
pipeline
has
become
one
of
the
fastest
growing
commodity
trades
as
nations
seek
cleaner
fuels
the
tariff
s
extension
to
an
energy
commodity
much
in
demand
in
china
was
a
worrisome
sign
for
trade
relations
and
for
billions
of
dollars
in
proposed
terminals
said
trade
group
executives
including
lng
is
a
good
indicator
of
how
serious
things
have
gotten
between
the
and
china
on
this
trade
issue
said
charlie
riedl
executive
director
of
center
for
liquefied
natural
gas
a
group
whose
members
include
cheniere
energy
chevron
and
exxon
mobil
while
we
would
like
to
see
this
resolved
quickly
i
don
t
see
that
happening
right
now
said
riedl
speaking
by
phone
from
a
natural
gas
conference
in
spain
the
longer
the
dispute
lasts
the
less
likely
proposed
projects
will
find
financial
backers
he
said
analysts
say
the
tariffs
will
particularly
hit
plans
by
companies
such
as
cheniere
energy
sempra
and
kinder
morgan
to
build
new
terminals
or
expand
existing
ones
by
adding
processing
units
some
commercial
agreements
may
be
on
hold
until
there
is
more
visibility
said
stacey
morris
director
of
energy
research
at
alerian
indexes
cheniere
kinder
morgan
and
dominion
energy
declined
to
comment
but
the
chinese
tariff
helped
lift
cheniere
energy
whose
shares
on
tuesday
were
up
percent
and
golar

whose
stock
rose

china
imported
million
tonnes
or
percent
of
the
million
tonnes
of
lng
exported
from
the
united
states
so
far
this
year
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
that
accounted
for
percent
of
total
chinese
lng
imports
the
has
been
looking
to
europe
to
take
on
more
of
its
natural
gas
as
the
china
dispute
continues
germany
said
on
tuesday
the
country
would
decide
by
where
to
locate
a
new
lng
receiving
terminal
as
a
gesture
to
the
trump
administration
