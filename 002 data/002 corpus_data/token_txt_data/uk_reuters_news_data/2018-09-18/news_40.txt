stock
futures
and
asian
shares
fell
on
tuesday
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
will
impose
tariffs
on
an
additional
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
in
a
sharp
escalation
of
the
trade
conflict
between
the
world
s
two
biggest
economies
the
tariffs
will
be
set
at
percent
trump
spared
smart
watches
from
apple
and
some
other
consumer
products
such
as
bicycle
helmets
but
he
warned
that
if
china
takes
retaliatory
action
he
will
pursue
tariffs
on
approximately
billion
of
goods
considering
his
latest
comments
as
well
as
recent
falls
in
his
support
it
is
hard
to
expect
trump
to
soften
his
stance
on

still
many

players
expect
the

ride
out

impact
for
now
tariffs
on
another
billion
will
mean
about
percent
of

have
seen
a
