on

russia

said

plane
was
shot
down
by

systems
but
accused
israel
of
indirectly
causing
the
incident
saying
israeli
jets
nearby
had
put
the
russian
plane
in
the
path
of
danger
russia
has
told
israel
it
will
take
all
necessary
measures
to
protect
its
military
personnel
in
syria
the
foreign
ministry
in
moscow
said
the
outlook
remains
weighed
down
however
by
an
escalation
in
the
trade
war
that
has
clouded
the
outlook
for
crude
demand
china
one
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
consumers
on
tuesday
added
billion
of
products
to
its

tariff
list
the
move
was
in
retaliation
for

donald
trump
s

levies
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
on
monday
the
trump
administration
said
it
would
begin
to
levy
new
tariffs
of
percent
on
about
billion
of
chinese
products
next
monday
with
the
tariffs
to
go
up
to
percent
by
the
end
of
the
tariffs
are
likely
to
limit
economic
activity
in
both
china
and
the
united
states
the
brinkmanship
between
beijing
and
washington
has
the
potential
to
severely
impact
the
competitiveness
of
crude
oil
and
petroleum
products
in
the
chinese
market
and
it
will
also
deter
chinese
investment
in
the
energy
sector
