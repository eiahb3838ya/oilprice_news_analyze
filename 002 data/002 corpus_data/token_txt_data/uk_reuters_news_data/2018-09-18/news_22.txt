sweden
s
largest
utility
vattenfall
said
on
tuesday
it
was
struggling
to
find
enough
skilled
staff
to
fill
engineering
and
technical
positions
at
power
plants
across
sweden
vattenfall
which
employs
around
people
is
growing
its
operations
while
facing
a
wave
of
retirements
and
needs
to
recruit
some
employees
to
operate
nuclear
plants
and
other
facilities
it
s
hard
to
find
this
in
a
time
when
there
is
a
major
shortage
of
skilled
labour
in
a
competitive
market
for
this
reason
starting
today
vattenfall
is
carrying
out
a
new
recruitment
campaign
the
company
said
in
a
statement
since
sweden
s
overall
rate
of
unemployment
has
fallen
to
percent
from
percent
while
the
number
of
jobs
that
went
unfilled
almost
doubled
statistics
sweden
data
showed
vattenfall
is
offering
various
positions
for
instance
engineers
project
managers
service
technicians
and
project
planners
mainly
for
the
nuclear
power
sector
but
also
in
distribution
maintenance
hydro
power
and
wind
power
the
staff
shortage
was
not
affecting
power
production
vattenfall
s
human
resources
chief
dag
svensson
told
reuters
we
are
recruiting
to
build
long
term
in
march
vattenfall
said
it
would
cut
jobs
by
in
an
effort
to
reduce
costs
mostly
support
positions
unrelated
to
the
recruitment
drive
for
skilled
technicians
and
engineers
