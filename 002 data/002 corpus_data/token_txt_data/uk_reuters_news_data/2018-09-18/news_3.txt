global
equity
markets
rallied
on

as
the

denting

china
has
limited
retaliatory
levers
it
can
pull
on
the
tariff
front
said
anthony
saglimbene
global
market
strategist
at
ameriprise
financial
services
in
troy
michigan
any
escalation
is
likely
to
involve
its
currency
or
making
it
harder
for
companies
to
operate
in
china
but
the
immediate
dent
on
the
economic
picture
is
likely
to
be
small
he
said
we
anticipate
this
last
round
of
tariffs
the
billion
it
s
only
probably
going
to
add
percentage
points
to
consumer
prices
that
s
nothing
saglimbene
said
the
market
is
smart
and
it
s
sniffing
out
through
the
end
of
the
year
the
tariff
impact
is
likely
to
be
small
on
economic
growth
and
it
s
small
on
corporate
profits
he
added
the
united
states
took
consumer
products
off
its
original
list
of
products
to
receive
tariff
hikes
which
will
blunt
the
impact
on
the
consumer
saglimbene
said
dutch
bank
ing
estimated
that
percent
of
world
trade
was
now
affected
by
the
tariffs
and
it
will
be
percent
if
trump
carries
out
threats
to
put
