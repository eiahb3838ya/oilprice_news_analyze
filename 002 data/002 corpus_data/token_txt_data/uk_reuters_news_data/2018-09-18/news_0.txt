washington
reuters
president
donald
trump
said
on
tuesday
the
united
states
is
considering
a
request
from
poland
for
a
permanent
military
presence
in
the
fellow
nato
country
acknowledging
that
he
shares
poland
s
concerns
about
possible
russian
aggression
polish
president
andrzej
duda
asked
trump
for
a
permanent
base
during
a
white
house
meeting
offering
to
name
it
fort
trump
and
explaining
it
would
be
a
bulwark
against
what
he
considers
a
threat
from
russia
trump
said
he
agreed
with
duda
that
moscow
had
acted
aggressively
in
the
region
and
said
the
request
for
a
base
was
under
consideration
he
said
he
appreciated
duda
s
offer
to
put
more
than
billion
into
the
project
we
re
looking
at
it
very
seriously
i
know
poland
likes
the
idea
very
much
and
it
s
something
that
we
are
considering
yes
trump
told
reporters
moscow
expressed
concern
in
may
over
reports
about
poland
s
request
saying
nato
s
expansion
towards
russia
s
borders
undermined
stability
in
europe
poland
joined
nato
in
along
with
hungary
and
the
czech
republic
and
since
then
other
former
communist
states
including
baltic
republics
bordering
russia
have
joined
despite
moscow
s
strong
opposition
poland
has
repeatedly
requested
a
permanent
military
presence
on
its
soil
the
united
states
currently
rotates
troops
through
poland
temporarily
but
permanently
stationing
forces
there
would
be
expensive
because
of
costs
that
can
include
housing
for
families
schools
and
hospitals
defense
secretary
jim
mattis
said
the
military
was
studying
options
with
poland
but
cautioned
that
no
decisions
had
been
made
it
s
not
just
about
a
base
it
s
about
training
ranges
it
s
about
maintenance
facilities
at
the
base
all
these
kinds
of
things
there
s
a
host
of
details
we
ve
got
to
study
alongside
the
poles
mattis
told
reporters
at
the
pentagon
trump
and
duda
also
expressed
shared
concerns
about
russia
s
nord
stream
gas
pipeline
which
they
said
could
make
europe
overly
reliant
on
moscow
for
energy
and
expose
it
to
the
risks
of
what
duda
called
political
blackmail
with
shipments
but
trump
said
the
united
states
was
not
looking
to
sanction
companies
that
participated
in
the
project
with
russia
we
just
think
it
s
very
unfortunate
for
the
people
of
germany
that
germany
is
paying
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
a
year
for
their
energy
to
russia
he
said
in
a
joint
statement
released
later
on
tuesday
after
the
press
conference
trump
and
duda
said
they
will
continue
coordinating
efforts
to
counter
energy
projects
that
threaten
our
mutual
security
such
as
nord
stream
trump
also
said
the
united
states
was
considering
a
visa
waiver
programme
for
poland
