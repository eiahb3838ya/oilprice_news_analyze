who
s
afraid
of
the
big
bad
trade
war
not
world
stock
markets
it
seems
the
response
to
president
donald
trump
s
decision
to
go
ahead
next
week
with
collecting
percent
tariffs
on
another
billion
of
chinese
goods
ratcheting
up
to
percent
in
january
was
unusual
and
unexpected
on
tuesday
it
initially
hit
stocks
treasuries
and
the
dollar
while
stirring
a
rally
in
chinese
equities
and
the
yuan
in
asia
china
then
confirmed
it
would
retaliate
but
still
traders
barely
flinched
european
stocks
gained
over
a
third
of
one
percent
on
course
for
a
third
day
of
gains
wall
street
futures
climbed
and
even
copper
and
the
aussie
dollar
which
have
been
highly
sensitive
to
the
trade
tensions
in
recent
months
held
firm
in
a
way
it
is
remarkable
that
the
market
is
holding
up
so
well
said
rabobank
s
head
of
macro
strategy
elwin
de
groot
this
is
clearly
a
further
ratcheting
up
of
the
trade
war
and
we
are
now
getting
close
to
a
situation
where
you
can
almost
speak
of
a
trade
war
clearly
that
is
not
one
theory
for
the
becalmed
reaction
was
that
the
billion
move
had
been
largely
priced
in
to
markets
following
weeks
of
reports
and
social
media
speculation
chinese
shares
did
dip
initially
as
asia
digested
the
details
but
then
rallied
to
push
the
csi
index
up
percent
some
locals
were
betting
that
beijing
will
step
up
infrastructure
investment
to
keep
the
economy
humming
japan
s
nikkei
also
ended
percent
higher
and
msci
s
emerging
market
index
was
up
for
the
fourth
day
in
the
last
five
as
percent
gains
in
poland
and
a
percent
rise
in
russia
added
to
asia
s
rebound
trump
s
announcement
is
largely
consistent
with
the
claims
made
earlier
citi
analysts
said
in
a
note
estimating
a
basis
point
drag
on
china
s
economic
growth
from
the
percent
tariff
the
trade
war
may
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
a
trade
war
looms
closer
now
they
added
however
china
s
promise
to
respond
to
the
new
tariffs
also
came
as
the
south
china
morning
post
newspaper
reported
beijing
was
reviewing
plans
to
send
a
delegation
headed
by
vice
premier
liu
he
to
washington
for
trade
talks
in
currencies
the
dollar
was
broadly
flat
at
although
on
an
individual
basis
it
was
a
fraction
firmer
against
the
japanese
yen
at
just
shy
of
at
the
same
time
it
was
down
slightly
against
the
chinese
yuan
in
offshore
markets
the
sensitive
australian
dollar
also
moved
up
percent
to
having
also
initially
been
hit
when
the
tariff
details
broke
with
fx
participants
wary
that
beijing
authorities
may
quickly
step
in
to
markets
at
any
point
investors
were
spontaneously
liquidating
their
short
yuan
positions
said
a
trader
at
one
chinese
bank
china
is
likely
to
reject
the
invitation
from
the
treasury
for
the
new
round
of
trade
talk
ocbc
bank
also
said
in
a
note
on
tuesday
oil
prices
fell
on
worries
rising
trade
tensions
could
dent
global
demand
for
crude
crude
futures
fell
cents
to
a
barrel
while
international
benchmark
brent
futures
lost
cents
to

gold
was
weaker
too
with

prices
down
