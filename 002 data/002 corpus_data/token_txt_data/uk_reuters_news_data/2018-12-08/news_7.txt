air
fares
in
sudan
skyrocketed
this
week
after
aviation
authorities
ordered
airlines
to
price
tickets
in
line
with
a
new
exchange
rate
mechanism
that
sharply
devalued
the
local
currency
under
the
exchange
regime
introduced
in
october
in
a
bid
to
tackle
an
acute
shortage
of
foreign
currency
the
sudanese
pound
was
devalued
to
per
dollar
from
pounds
per
dollar
previously
that
has
led
to
a
surge
in
the
cost
of
many
goods
and
services
but
air
ticket
prices
had
been
set
according
to
the
customs
exchange
rate
pounds
per
dollar
until
wednesday
when
the
country
s
civil
aviation
authority
announced
the
hike
in
a
memo
sent
to
airlines
the
order
caused
prices
to
jump
about
percent
according
to
travel
agencies
estimates
prices
in
dollars
were
not
affected
but
only
foreigners
and
sudanese
residents
of
other
countries
may
buy
tickets
in
dollars
this
decision
has
led
to
a
drastic
percent
drop
in
travel
in
the
last
two
days
this
situation
puts
the
aviation
industry
in
sudan
and
travel
agencies
at
risk
of
unbearable
losses
said
mahjoub
almack
head
of
the
sudanese
association
of
travel
and
tourism
agents
despite
october
s
devaluation
the
pound
remains
under
pressure
and
the
gap
between
the
official
and
black
market
rates
has
continued
to
widen
a
dollar
cost

the
black
