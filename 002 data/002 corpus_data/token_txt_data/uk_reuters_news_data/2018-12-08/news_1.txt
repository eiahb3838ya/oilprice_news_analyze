flavour

rooms
next

a

negotiations
continue
to
clean
up
a
messy
text
ahead

saturday
night
deadline
to
have
a
document
ready
for
ministers
to
wrestle
over
in
the
second
and
final
week
of
the
conference
negotiators
say
there
has
been
progress
but
it
is
slow
and
as
ever
finance
is
a
stumbling
block
although
highly
technical
negotiators
say
the
katowice
talks
are
an
essential
to
the
paris
agreement
which
agreed
on
the
aim
of
limiting
global
warming
but
did
not
provide
rules
on
how
to
achieve
that
a
spokesman
said
a
record
number
more
than
had
registered
to
attend
the
conference
those
arriving
at
the
start
of
next
week
will
include
former
maldives

mohamed
nasheed
who
will
be
returning
from
exile
in
britain
to
lead
his
country
s
delegation
at
noon
demonstrators
accompanied
by
a
heavy
police
presence
took
to
the
streets
of
katowice
to
demand
an
agreement
that
will
prevent
temperatures
rising
by
more
than
degrees
celsius
the
marchers
symbol
is
an
alarm
clock
as
organisers
seek
to
wake
governments
up
to
the
urgency
of
action
our
message
for
the
politicians
and
the
companies
is
that
they
should
stop
making
money
at
our
expense
at
the
expense
of
our
health
said
one
of
the
demonstrators
who
gave
his
name
only
as
jeremi
they
shouldn
t
just
think
about
the
next
years
but
see
that
it
s
possible
to
live
on
our
planet
for
much
longer
he
said
a
police
spokesman
estimated
that
people
took
part
in
the
march
environmental
campaigners
in
katowice
said
violent
protests
by
yellow
vest
demonstrators
in
paris
about
fuel
costs
were
about
social
justice
and
should
not
be
confused
with
the
need
for
a
price
on
carbon
to
help
shift
the
energy
mix
away
from
fossil
fuel
french
president
emmanuel
macron
was
forced
to
scrap
a
planned
fuel
tax
because
of
the
angry
demonstrations
about
living
costs
numbers
on
the
streets
of
katowice
could
have

reduced
by
at
least
a
dozen
after
polish
border
guards
refused
to
let
some
environmental
campaigners
enter
the
country
organisations
said
one
of
those
stopped
was
nugzar

email
environment
organisation
said
in
an
email
that
those
denied
entrance
had
been
told
they
were
a
threat
to
national
security
which
as
you
can
imagine
is
ludicrous
a
spokeswoman
for
the
polish
border
guard
said
people
had
been
forbidden
entry
to
poland
on
friday
for
many
reasons
including
a
lack
of

documents
and
being
on
