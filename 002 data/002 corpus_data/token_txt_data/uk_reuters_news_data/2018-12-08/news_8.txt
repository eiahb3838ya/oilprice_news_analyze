concerned
about
planet
sees
need

poland
not
ready
to

until
has

polish
pgg
the
european
union
s
biggest
producer
of
thermal
coal
said
it
plans
to
sink
a
new
mine
near
where
talks
to
wean
the
world
off
fossil
fuels
are
taking
place
the
imielin
north
project
around
kilometres
from
katowice
would
cost
at
least
billion
zloty
million
with
up
to
half
the
funding
provided
by
pgg
its
chief
executives
tomasz
rogala
told
reuters
poland
s
president
said
this
week
he
would
not
allow
anyone
to
murder
coal
outraging
many
of
the
thousands
of
delegates
representing
nearly
countries
at
the
conference
rogala
expects
the
new
mine
to
be
completed
in
around
five
years
time
and
have
a
reserve
base
of
million
tonnes
that
compares
with
pgg
s
annual
output
of
around
million
tonnes
while
coking
coal
is
on
the
eu
list
of
strategic
minerals
because
of
its
use
in
steel
coal
for
power
generation
is
more
difficult
to
justify
rogala
said
he
understands
the
need
to
move
on
from
coal
but
alternative
sources
must
be
in
place
first
i
have
pressure
to
find
new
business
he
said
adding
that
when
effective
electricity
storage
was
developed
coal
generation
would
be
obsolete
battery
storage
is
a
holy
grail
for
those
who
favour
green
energy
as
it
would
make
wind
and
solar
power
as
reliable
as
coal
nuclear
and
gas
it
battery
storage
can
change
everything
the
first
effective
electricity
storage
will
end
coal
generation
rogala
said
we
have
to
stop
climate
change
but
i
don
t
agree
that
european
coal
is
responsible
alone
as
the
greatest
use
of
coal
is
elsewhere
he
added
poland
s
coal
output
has
shrunk
by
million
tonnes
over
the
last
years
rogala
said
while
global
production
has
at
least
doubled
and
electricity
demand
has
kept
rising
for
now
rogala
said
poland
needs
the
fuel
because
it
does
not
have
nuclear
generation
and
it
does
not
want
to
depend
on
imports
from
russia
which
have
been
rising
pgg
has
a
transition
plan
which
includes
supplying
its
technical
services
such
as
precision
welding
to
other
polish
industries
and
producing
gas
from
coal
for
energy
and
as
a
feedstock
for
the
chemical
industry
rogala
said
the
aim
is
a
transition
that
will
create
jobs
with
salaries
equivalent
to
coal
which
in
silesia
are
around
percent
better
paid
than
the
average
