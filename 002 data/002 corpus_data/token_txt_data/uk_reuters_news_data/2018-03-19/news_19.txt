beirut
reuters
the
european
bank
for
reconstruction
and
development
sees
enormous
prospects
in
lebanon
but
potential
investors
need
to
see
progress
on
reform
and
over
the
border
a
process
towards
a
settlement
of
syria
s
war
the
bank
s
president
said
on
his
first
visit
since
the
ebrd
began
operating
in
lebanon
in
september
ebrd
president
suma
chakrabarti
said
he
saw
a
role
for
the
bank
in
financing
small
and
enterprises
and
renewable
energy
energy
efficiency
and
infrastructure
projects
on
thursday
lebanon
agreed
its
first
two
ebrd
deals
a
percent
equity
investment
in
lebanon
s
largest
lender
bank
audi
and
a
million
trade
finance
line
with
fransabank
the
i
think
the
prospects
for
the
ebrd
in
lebanon
are
enormous
he
told
reuters
and
added
that
the
bank
has
not
set
an
upper
limit
on
investment
in
lebanon
it
depends
on
the
demand
we
get
from
private
sector
while
the
war
in
syria
continues
lebanon
s
biggest
challenge
will
remain
regional
risk
providing
lebanon
continues
with
that
economic
reform
process
provided
there
is
a
process
towards
a
settlement
in
syria
i
think
the
prospects
are
really
good
chakrabarti
said
set
up
by
governments
in
to
invest
in
the
economies
of
eastern
europe
and
owned
mainly
by
developed
countries
the
ebrd
has
expanded
its
mandate
in
the
last
decade
to
operate
in
almost
countries
lebanon
joins
egypt
jordan
morocco
and
tunisia
in
the
ebrd
s
southern
and
eastern
mediterranean
semed
region
where
it
has
invested
more
than
billion
euros
billion
in
projects
since
lebanon
has
one
of
the
highest
ratios
in
the
world
at
about
percent
growth
and
state
revenues
have
been
low
for
years
undermined
by
war
in
neighbor
syria
and
domestic
political
inertia
to
help
stimulate
the
economy
lebanon
is
seeking
up
to
billion
for
infrastructure
this
year
from
investors
and
donors
fundraising
will
begin
with
an
april
conference
in
paris
chakrabarti
said
the
ebrd
will
voice
support
for
lebanon
in
paris
and
is
keen
to
invest
further
especially
in
public
private
partnership
ppp
projects
the
billion
can
not
be
financed
unless
there
are
more
ppps
he
said
chakrabarti
said
the
ebrd
and
other
lenders
will
be
very
much
focussed
on
how
lebanon
implements
promised
reforms
and
projects
should
believe
that
just
having
a
conference
in
paris
is
a
success
in
after
agreeing
a
president
and
prime
minister
in
late
after
years
of
political
paralysis
lebanon
has
passed
its
first
budget
since
signed
it
first
offshore
oil
and
gas
deals
and
signed
a
ppp
law
chakrabarti
said
these
developments
have
made
him
more
confident
than
i
would
have
been
a
couple
of
years
ago
conversations
we
ve
had
suggest
there
actually
is
a
consensus
building
that
more
reform
is
going
to
be
lebanon
is
due
to
hold
its
first
parliamentary
elections
since
in
early
may
they
will
be
held
under
a
new
electoral
law
making
it
harder
to
predict
the
outcome
people
are
talking
very
openly
that
they
don
t
think
the
parliamentary
elections
will
derail
this
process
even
after
the
election
we
can
expect
a
continued
push
in
the
right
through
equity
in
its
investment
in
bank
audi
chakrabarti
said
the
ebrd
hopes
to
establish
itself
in
lebanon
s
banking
sector
where
it
wants
to
help
banks
reach
new
customers
if
lebanon
is
to
achieve
the
rates
of
growth
economic
growth
that
it
can
do
lending
has
to
increase
in
the
medium
term
without
a
doubt
he
said
a
group
of
customers
chakrabarti
is
passionate
about
reaching
is
women
entrepreneurs
we
have
our
women
in
business
programs
in
countries
we
have
learned
how
to
do
this
really
well
he
said
chakrabarti
said
the
ebrd
can
work
well
with
lebanon
s
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
its
move
towards
a
private
development
model
lebanon
s
capital
investment
plan
also
focuses
on
ebrd
strengths
energy
infrastructure
and
smes
lebanon
has
hosted
over
a
million
refugees
fleeing
syria
s
conflict
straining
public
services
around
the
country
chakrabarti
said
the
bank
has
been
talking
to
the
lebanese
government
about
projects
to
help
host
communities
and
refugees
but
this
will
require
donors
to
contribute
funds
alongside
the
ebrd
s
loans
euros
