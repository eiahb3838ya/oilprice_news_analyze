asian
share
markets
slipped
into
the
red
on
monday
as
caution
gripped
investors
in
a
week
in
which
the
federal
reserve
is
likely
to
hike
interest
rates
and
perhaps
signal
that
as
many
as
three
more
lie
in
store
for
the
rest
of
the
year
japan
s
nikkei
extended
early
losses
to
drop
percent
as
exporters
were
undermined
by
recent
gains
in
the
yen
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
eased
percent
while
australia
s
main
index
lost
percent
the
pain
was
not
confined
to
asia
with
the
june
contract
for
futures
on
the
s
p
down
percent
and
ftse
futures
off
percent
while
wall
street
had
bounced
on
friday
the
major
indices
still
ended
lower
for
the
week
the
dow
lost
percent
the
s
p
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
decline
was
surprising
given
figures
from
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
showed
a
record
billion
of
inflows
into
equities
last
week
outpacing
bond
flows
for
the
first
time
since
for
the
year
so
far
billion
has
gone
into
tech
stocks
and
billion
into
financials
while
billion
has
flowed
into
emerging
markets
and
billion
into
japan
whether
the
cash
continues
to
flow
could
depend
on
what
the
fed
decides
on
wednesday
all
analysts
polled
by
reuters
expected
the
fed
would
raise
rates
to
between
percent
and
percent
on
wednesday
they
were
less
certain
on
whether
the
dot
plot
forecasts
of
committee
members
will
stay
at
three
hikes
this
year
or
shift
higher
it
will
also
be
the
first
press
conference
for
new
fed
chair
jerome
powell
expected
is
a
confident
fed
chair
both
with
respect
to
the
economy
s
strength
and
the
fed
s
approach
to
policy
said
analysts
at
westpac
in
a
note
while
growth
forecasts
and
the
distribution
of
rate
projections
are
likely
to
drift
up
the
median
fed
funds
forecast
should
remain
unchanged
at
three
in
and
three
more
in
they
added
gradual
and
timely
are
the
operative
words
for
any
nod
to
four
hikes
would
normally
be
considered
as
bullish
for
the
dollar
yet
the
currency
has
shown
scant
correlation
to
interest
rates
in
recent
months
falling
even
as
policy
tightened
reasons
cited
by
dealers
include
concerns
about
the
budget
and
current
account
deficits
political
chaos
at
the
white
house
better
growth
in
competing
countries
particularly
europe
and
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
trade
will
be
top
of
the
agenda
at
a
meeting
starting
later
on
monday
in
buenos
aires
and
any
signs
of
escalating
stress
between
the
and
china
could
make
investors
in
asia
nervous
the
cautious
mood
was
evident
in
demand
for
the
japanese
yen
which
climbed
against
a
raft
of
currencies
last
week
on
monday
the
dollar
was
off
percent
at
yen
and
not
far
from
its
recent
trough
at
the
dollar
was
a
fraction
firmer
against
a
basket
of
currencies
at
while
the
euro
eased
percent
to
the
prospect
of
higher
interest
rates
was
been
a
burden
for
gold
which
slipped
percent
last
week
early
monday
the
metal
was
down
at
per
ounce
oil
prices
eased
after
ending
last
week
with
a
solid
bounce
brent
futures
were
down
cents
at
a
barrel
while
crude
futures
for
april
which
expire
on
tuesday
dipped
cents
to
a
barrel
