factbox-norway confidence vote may trigger change of government
oslo

reuters
norway
s
parliament
votes
on
tuesday
on
a
motion
of
no
confidence
in
the
justice
minister
and
the
government
is
expected
to
resign
if
it
is
passed
sylvi
listhaug
of
the
progress
party
has
caused
a
political
storm
by
accusing
the
opposition
labour
party
the
target
of
a
massacre
of
putting
terrorists
rights
before
national
security
the
outcome
of
the
vote
will
depend
on
the
small
christian
democratic
party
cdp
traditionally
a
supporter
of
the
government
which
on
monday
held
meetings
to
decide
its
position
snap
elections
are
not
allowed
and
norway
s
next
is
not
due
until
conservative
prime
minister
erna
solberg
might
be
able
to
form
a
new
cabinet
but
the
task
could
fall
to
labour
leader
jonas
gahr
stoere
if
the
cdp
switches
sides
below
is
a
summary
of
key
policy
issues
with
more
than
trillion
saved
from
norway
s
oil
and
gas
industry
parliament
faces
key
questions
over
how
to
organise
the
fund
and
whether
to
allow
investments
beyond
the
foreign
stocks
bonds
and
real
estate
it
currently
holds
the
government
is
due
to
present
a
white
paper
on
the
fund
in
april
but
a
change
of
power
would
almost
certainly
lead
to
a
postponement
parliament
must
also
decide
on
whether
to
back
the
fund
s
wish
to
drop
the
shares
of
oil
and
gas
companies
from
its
benchmark
index
though
this
issue
is
unlikely
to
come
to
a
vote
until
or
later
the
conservatives
are
open
to
reducing
the
state
s
stakes
in
several
companies
notably
in
telecoms
firm
telenor
where
it
has
permission
from
parliament
to
cut
its
holding
to
percent
from
percent
labour
said
ahead
of
last
year
s
election
it
would
ask
parliament
to
reverse
the
telenor
sales
permit
a
plan
to
change
the
name
of
oil
firm
statoil
could
be
at
stake
the
current
oil
minister
backs
the
board
s
plan
to
rename
the
company
equinor
but
labour
has
voiced
scepticism
the
conservatives
seek
cuts
in
taxes
for
corporations
on
personal
incomes
and
in
wealth
and
property
taxes
they
want
tariff
cuts
to
promote
free
trade
labour
vowed
in
last
year
s
general
election
to
raise
taxes
for
earners
and
the
wealthy
by
up
to
billion
to
improve
public
services
and
reduce
reliance
on
the
sovereign
wealth
fund
it
blamed
its
defeat
partly
on
the
tax
strategy
and
said
it
might
be
more
reluctant
to
hike
income
taxes
in
the
future
the
party
has
backed
a
government
plan
to
cut
corporate
taxes
in
return
for
support
from
the
centrist
christian
democrats
and
the
liberals
solberg
agreed
last
year
to
extend
a
moratorium
on
oil
and
gas
exploration
around
the
arctic
lofoten
archipelago
for
another
four
years
if
the
government
collapses
the
agreement
will
be
void
and
the
fate
of
drilling
in
the
area
thought
to
hold
vast
resources
will
ultimately
be
decided
by
parliament
if
the
conservatives
were
to
rule
alone
solberg
could
seek
the
support
of
progress
and
labour
to
move
towards
exploration
this
would
further
sour
relations
with
the
two
centrist
parties
so
solberg
may
instead
use
the
question
of
drilling
as
leverage
to
win
continued
support
labour
has
sought
a
compromise
that
could
see
some
of
the
area
opened
for
drilling
but
faces
a
tricky
dilemma
because
opposition
within
the
party
to
lofoten
exploration
is
growing
