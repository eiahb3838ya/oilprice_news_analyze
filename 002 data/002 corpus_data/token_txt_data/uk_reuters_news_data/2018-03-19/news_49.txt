if
the
oil
market
has
felt
unusually
quiet
in
recent
weeks
and
months
that
probably
reflects
the
almost
complete
lack
of
sharp
daily
price
movements
while
prices
have
soared
by
more
than
percent
since
the
middle
of
volatility
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
level
since
with
a
relatively
smooth
and
orderly
upward
adjustment
in
prices
volatility
has
been
trending
downwards
since
early
and
in
january
fell
to
its
lowest
since
august
the
standard
deviation
of
daily
price
moves
expressed
at
an
annualised
rate
one
common
measure
of
volatility
dropped
to
only
percent
in
january
from
percent
almost
two
year
earlier
volatility
in
early
and
was
in
the
bottom
fifth
percentile
for
any
period
since
the
start
of
the
relatively
sharp
drop
in
oil
prices
at
the
start
of
february
has
since
pushed
volatility
slightly
higher
at
least
temporarily
but
even
that
decline
was
relatively
smooth
volatility
is
still
only
in
the
percentile
of
the
distribution
and
is
set
to
decline
again
if
the
market
s
more
recent
calm
is
sustained
there
have
been
no
significantly
large
daily
price
movements
in
brent
up
or
down
since
june
which
was
the
last
time
there
was
a
daily
move
exceeding
standard
deviations
the
last
really
abnormal
price
move
exceeding
standard
deviations
and
nearing
was
all
the
way
back
in
november
when
opec
announced
that
it
had
reached
agreement
on
cutting
production
french
mathematician
benoit
mandelbrot
noted
the
average
level
of
volatility
in
commodity
prices
as
well
as
other
assets
is
itself
volatile
the
variation
of
certain
speculative

between
mild
and

since
opec
and

announced
their
declaration
of
cooperation
in
late
the
oil
market
has
been
in
a
mild
state
and
the
absence
of
volatility
has
been
especially
pronounced
in
the
past
nine
months
strong
growth
in
global
oil
consumption
has
been
accompanied
by
large
upward
revisions
in
forecast
oil
production
global
oil
inventories
have
shrunk
sharply
but
there
is
broad
optimism
that
future
production
will
grow
fast
enough
to
meet
demand
record
buying
of
futures
and
options
linked
to
petroleum
by
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
has
been
matched
by
strong
interest
in
and
hedging
from
producers
the
result
is
that
market
liquidity
has
been
very
high
with
the
accumulation
of
relatively
large
futures
and
options
positions
and
heavy
turnover
inducing
only
modest
price
changes
the
critical
question
for
traders
and
investors
is
whether
this
relatively
suppressed
level
of
volatility
will
continue
and
if
so
for
how
long
the
shift
from
mild
to
wild
usually
occurs
abruptly
and
without
warning
there
isn
t
usually
a
gradual
transition
from
one
state
to
the
other
several
risk
factors
could
cause
an
upsurge
in
volatility
in
the
next
few
months
including
the
unwinding
of
concentrated
hedge
fund
positions
uncertainty
surrounding
future
growth
of
shale
production
and
macroeconomic
risks
to
oil
consumption
volatility
could
also
come
from
within
the
market
itself
in
the
form
of
flash
crashes
that
arise
from
the
positioning
of
market
participants
and
do
not
need
any
external
fundamental
trigger
periods
of
low
volatility
tend
to
breed
complacency
and
excessive
among
traders
which
sows
the
seeds
of
their
own
demise
while
various
risk
factors
can
be
identified
in
the
current
market
periods
of
low

can
persist
for
a
surprisingly
long
time
the
previous

extended

years

the
