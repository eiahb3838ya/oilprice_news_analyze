the
supreme
court
on
monday
declined
to
consider
rolling
back
the
wide
latitude
federal
agencies
are
given
to
interpret
their
own
regulations
in
a
case
that
could
have
bolstered
president
donald
trump
s
push
toward
deregulation
and
curbing
agency
power
the
court
turned
away
an
appeal
by
garco
construction
inc
of
a
lower
court
ruling
that
deferred
to
the
interpretation
of
officials
at
malmstrom
air
force
base
a
nuclear
weapons
facility
in
great
falls
montana
of
its
contractor
policy
conservative
justices
clarence
thomas
and
neil
gorsuch
who
was
appointed
by
trump
last
year
dissented
from
the
court
s
action
saying
they
would
have
heard
the
case
the
spokane
company
which
had
a
contract
to
building
housing
at
the
base
objected
after
officials
refused
to
admit
workers
with
criminal
records
who
a
subcontractor
had
hired
for
the
job
although
the
case
could
have
boosted
the
trump
administration
s
plan
for
broad
deregulation
the
justice
department
urged
the
supreme
court
not
to
hear
it
because
although
garco
s
criticism
has
merits
in
other
contexts
the
air
force
s
reading
of
its
rules
was
correct
the
case
involves
a
legal
doctrine
known
as
auer
deference
that
lets
courts
defer
to
an
agency
s
interpretation
of
its
own
rules
unless
the
interpretation
is
plainly
wrong
or
inconsistent
or
incompatible
with
the
regulation
garco
said
the
base
did
not
follow
its
own
rules
in
violation
of
the
construction
contract
and
thus
were
owed
no
deference
in
their
interpretation
the
dispute
had
attracted
the
attention
of
various
states
and
business
groups
as
it
could
have
undermined
the
power
of
federal
agencies
and
departments
to
write
and
enforce
their
own
regulations
conservative
justices
including
john
roberts
and
samuel
alito
have
questioned
such
deference
in
the
past
noting
the
prior
skepticism
thomas
wrote
in
his
dissent
joined
by
gorsuch
that
the
court
should
have
reviewed
whether
its
precedents
allowing
for
deference
should
be
overruled
calling
such
deference
constitutionally
malmstrom
air
force
base
is
one
of
three
bases
that
operate
minuteman
iii
intercontinental
ballistic
nuclear
missiles
the
august
contract
allowed
for
the
use
of
employees
with
criminal
records
according
to
court
papers
but
a
subcontractor
found
some
of
its
workers
were
barred
entry
garco
said
this
exclusion
amounted
to
an
abrupt
change
that
added
full
background
checks
well
before
a
new
written
policy
on
such
checks
was
implemented
in
october
the
air
force
disagreed
and
said
there
was
no
change
in
policy
over
that
time
because
its
prior
policy
encompassed
full
background
checks
it
denied
garco
s
request
for
additional
payments
of
more
than
to
account
for
locating
hiring
and
training
personnel
to
replace
the
workers
with
prior
criminal
convictions
conservative
and
business
groups
say
administrative
agencies
have
accumulated
tremendous
power
and
judicial
deference
is
part
of
the
reason
why
judges
should
not
cede
their
jobs
to
these
agencies
