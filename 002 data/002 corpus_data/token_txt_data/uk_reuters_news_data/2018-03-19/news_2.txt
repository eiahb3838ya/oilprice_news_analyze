policy
to

refiners
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with

matter
the
meeting

marks
the

development
in
the

s
efforts
to
find

ground
between
the
rival
oil

corn
industries
over
the
future
of
the
renewable
fuel
standard
a
law
requiring
refiners
to
blend
biofuels
like
ethanol
into
the
nation
s
gasoline
and
diesel
the
program
has
created
a
vast
new
market
for
midwest
corn
farmers
but
refiners
have
complained
the
regulation
costs
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
creating
a
rift
between
two
of
trump
s
key
electoral
constituencies

meeting
on

the

list
will
include
a
broad
range
of
options
mooted
by
both
sides
during
recent
negotiations
hosted
by
the
white
house
or
whether

will
provide
narrower
recommendations

told

cap
on
the
price
of
rins
at
cents
each
according
to
a
source
who
attended
but
asked
not
to
be
named
but
a
group
of
lawmakers
told
trump
in
a
letter
last
week
that
a
cap
would
have
severe
and
immediate
consequences
to
farmers
and
the
biofuels
industry
by
reducing
incentives
for
blending
trump
also
said
he
supported
expanding
sales
of
gasoline
a
tweak
long
sought
by
ethanol
producers
according
to
the
source
