foundation
as
the
maasai
of
kenya
s
great
rift
valley
prepare
to
lose
more
land
to
a
geothermal
plant
they
hope
to
win
a
better
deal
this
time
after
meeting
the
maori
in
new
zealand
protests
by
the
maasai
known
for
dressing
in
red
blankets
and
colourful
beads
halted
construction
in
of
kenya
s
olkaria
v
plant
about
km
miles
northwest
of
the
capital
nairobi
on
ancestral
land
sacred
to
community
rituals
although
building
resumed
after
negotiations
both
sides
are
keen
to
improve
relations
so
that
the
hot
water
under
the
soil
can
help
to
lift
the
maasai
community
who
farm
and
herd
cattle
on
the
land
above
it
out
of
poverty
the
maori
have
conflicts
but
they
ve
found
better
ways
to
solve
them
said
mwangi
sururu
who
travelled
to
down
south
in
november
to
see
how
the
indigenous
new
zealanders
kept
their
culture
intact
by
partnering
with
energy
firms
they
were
given
a
share
in
the
power
plants
and
the
areas
that
were
already
being
used
for
power
production
were
leased
directly
from
them
said
the
maasai
elder
who
was
one
of
more
than
people
evicted
from
their
rift
valley
land
in
kenya
is
africa
s
biggest
geothermal
producer
it
aims
by
to
triple
its
output
of
clean
electricity
made
from
generating
stations
that
harness
natural
underground
heat
this
will
require
more
geothermal
plants
but
further
encroachment
on
land
claimed
by
the
maasai
could
cause
conflicts
if
the
process
is
not
managed
carefully
said
john
maina
of
the
renewable
energy
department
at
kenya
s
energy
ministry
problems
arise
when
the
investor
doesn
t
do
thorough
community
engagement
and
participation
maina
told
a
public
forum
hosted
by
the
university
of
nairobi
geothermal
projects
are
very
sensitive
and
people
have
to
be
moved
because
of
the
nature
of
the
steam
but
this
sometimes
causes
friction
with
the
the
exchange
was
arranged
by
power
africa
former
president
barack
obama
s
signature
africa
energy
initiative
which
aims
to
boost
access
to
electricity
in
a
continent
where
two
in
three
people
live
without
it
the
maasai
and
the
maori
consider
geothermal
springs
as
critical
to
their
way
of
life
offering
heat
for
cooking
a
place
to
treat
ailments
and
a
venue
for
traditional
rituals
the
maori
said
they
faced
similar
threats
to
their
lands
but
found
ways
to
work
with
the
plant
operators
we
are
an
indigenous
community
over
here
and
we
ve
had
some
projects
just
like
the
maasai
said
desterney
mana
newton
chairman
of
new
zealand
s
ngati
tahu
tribal
lands
trust
which
administers
blocks
of
maori
land
used
for
geothermal
projects
we
feel
we
can
learn
from
each
other
he
said
by
phone
benefits
included
taking
up
shares
in
companies
investing
in
geothermal
plants
and
monitoring
their
activities
so
that
the
maori
way
of
life
was
not
affected
said
newton
who
was
part
of
the
exchange
programme
the
maori
also
received
dividends
and
revenue
from
annual
rates
paid
for
leases
on
their
land
he
added
the
maori
have
one
key
advantage
over
the
maasai
under
new
zealand
law
they
own
the
resources
mined
in
their
land
sururu
said
while
the
maasai
do
not
have
the
right
to
any
underground
resources
all
of
which
belong
to
the
state
when
the
olkaria
iv
plant
was
being
built
kenya
electricity
generating
company
kengen
relocated
more
than
families
including
sururu
s
to
a
plot
on
kedong
ranch
about
km
away
the
exercise
was
marred
with
controversy
an
investigation
by
the
world
bank
one
of
several
international
lenders
found
that
evicted
families
were
adversely
affected
people
were
resettled
to
land
which
was
less
suitable
for
them
than
their
older
habitats
its
report
said
kengen
the
country
s
biggest
electricity
generator
said
it
has
been
holding
meetings
with
maasai
leaders
every
two
months
since
to
address
community
concerns
we
are
trying
to
find
common
meeting
points
said
moses
wekesa
kengen
s
business
development
director
adding
that
kengen
can
not
ignore
community
concerns
because
it
plans
to
build
at
least
three
more
geothermal
plants
in
olkaria
the
east
african
nation
is
ramping
up
electricity
production
to
keep
up
with
growing
demand
for
power
and
to
reduce
frequent
blackouts
given
the
challenges
in
compensating
the
maasai
with
alternative
plots
of
land
kengen
is
vesting
its
hopes
in
other
approaches
including
a
bill
tabled
in
parliament
last
month
it
lays
out
a
regime
under
which
geothermal
companies
pay
up
to
percent
of
revenue
from
a
site
into
a
fund
for
a
decade
with
higher
royalties
in
later
years
the
national
government
would
take
at
least
percent
with
percent
for
local
governments
and
percent
for
the
local
community
the
energy
bill
says
the
bill
will
help
sururu
said
kengen
is
already
negotiating
resettlement
with
people
living
on
the
proposed
olkaria
vi
site
said
cyrus
karingithi
a
resource
development
manager
for
the
company
eventually
they
will
have
to
move
because
the
plant
is
something
that
benefits
more
than
just
a
few
people
he
said
pointing
at
a
plain
beyond
the
olkaria
iv
plant
but
negotiations
have
not
been
completed
added
maasai
elder
maenga
kisotu
the
maori
have
shown
us
how
they
live
with
the
energy
companies
