australian
shares
erased
early
gains
to
slip
on
monday
as
financials
and

dragged
the

lower
with
broader
asian

jittery
ahead
of
the
federal

meeting
later
in

biggest
loser
on
the
wesfarmers
came
out
on
friday
and
said
they
were
going
to
sell
off
their
coles
supermarket
division
the
stock
was
up
very
strongly
and
it
just
seems
as
though
it
is
giving
back
some
of
those
gains
that
would
be
the
major
reason
why
consumer
staples
are
weaker
said
christopher
conway
at
the
australian

meanwhile
energy
stocks
edged
as
much
as
percent
higher

numbers
materials
are
a
bit
of
a
funny
one
and
that
is
because
it
has
bhp
in
it
of
course
bhp
has
a
lot
of
exposure
to
oil
it
is
the
biggest
oil
producer
in
australia
bigger
than
wooodside
and
all
the
other
commodities
companies
and
we
all
know
it
has
got
a
huge
weight
said
conway
it
is
bhp
s
oil
exposure
which
is
giving
it
a
gain
and
driving
the
rest
of
the
materials
sector
overcoming
the
