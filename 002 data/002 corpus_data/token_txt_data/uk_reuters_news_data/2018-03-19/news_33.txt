interview-varo bets on european refining despite peak oil demand fears
london
reuters
electric
vehicles
and
stricter
marine
fuel
regulations
are
generally
not
perceived
as
good
news
for
the
oil
refining
industry
but
the
head
of
european
downstream
firm
varo
energy
roger
brown
says
he
believes
the
complete
opposite
at
least
for
the
varo
which
has
refineries
and
storage
assets
in
western
europe
announced
on
monday
that
it
would
list
in
amsterdam
this
year
its
shareholders
which
include
private
equity
firm
carlyle
and
oil
trading
merchant
vitol
plan
to
sell
a
combined
percent
of
stock
on
euronext
the
company
could
be
valued
at
billion
euros
billion
according
to
banking
sources
brown
a
veteran
bp
trader
who
was
hired
as
varo
chief
executive
in
believes
some
refiners
could
benefit
from
forecasts
of
a
peak
in
oil
demand
within
a
generation
i
don
t
think
many
people
will
build
new
refineries
amid
all
the
talk
about
peak
oil
demand
so
hence
current
refiners
will
have
to
run
at
full
capacity
said
brown
many
commodity
traders
oil
companies
and
analysts
expect
oil
consumption
to
slow
in
years
to
come
as
sales
of
electric
vehicles
accelerate
and
wind
and
solar
power
provide
more
of
the
world
s
electricity
some
predict
oil
demand
will
peak
some
time
after
another
challenge
for
the
refining
industry
is
upcoming
stricter
regulations
for
marine
fuel
which
will
drastically
reduce
the
use
of
fuel
oil
for
shipping
but
increase
the
use
of
diesel
brown
says
that
too
would
present
an
opportunity
for
the
refining
industry
in
europe
as
existing
refineries
would
need
to
fill
the
additional
demand
for
diesel
in
the
shipping
sector
varo
which
saw
underlying
earnings
rise
to
million
last
year
from
million
in
owns
two
refineries
in
switzerland
and
germany
and
storage
blending
and
distribution
assets
in
those
two
countries
as
well
as
the
benelux
nations
and
france
varo
has
made
nine
acquisitions
since
being
set
up
in
and
brown
says
more
are
coming
on
monday
varo
said
it
intended
to
pay
out
a
dividend
of
percent
of
its
profit
after
tax
and
achieve
over
the
medium
term
high
growth
in
underlying
earnings
the
company
wants
to
invest
percent
of
its
free
cashflow
in
organic
and
inorganic
growth
the
company
had
revenues
of
billion
in
up
from
billion
in
varo
run
as
a
standalone
business
from
vitol
has
the
trader
as
its
sole
crude
supplier
brown
says
the
deal
with
vitol
was
extended
until
and
the
trader
is
obliged
to
supply
varo
at
the
lowest
available
price
in
the
market
while
varo
will
also
fully
hedge
oil
price
refining
margins
and
foreign
exchange
risks
brown
says
he
sees
a
lot
of
scope
for
growth
as
several
storage
businesses
in
europe
are
considering
selling
out
due
to
a
lack
of
succession
planning
and
the
high
costs
of
keeping
assets
in
compliance
with
stringent
regulations
in
europe
varo
has
focused
on
upgrading
refineries
developing
biofuel
terminals
and
optimising
value
chains
a
lot
of
us
at
varo
remember
bp
s
integration
days
under
former
ceo
john
browne
we
worked
on
integrating
castrol
mobil
europe
and
veba
oil
what
we
learnt
is
that
you
can
not
build
bridges
you
need
full
integration
said
brown
margins
tend
to
move
up
and
down
from
refiner
to
terminal
so
having
an
integrated
business
model
helps
taking
a
lot
of
market
volatility
out
of
your
results
