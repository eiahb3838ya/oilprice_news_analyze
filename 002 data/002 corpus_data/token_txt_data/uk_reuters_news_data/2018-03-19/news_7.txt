fifteen
cities
in
asia
and
africa
could
each
see
at
least
a
million
fewer
premature
deaths
this
century
if
they
cut
toxic
carbon
dioxide
emissions
along
the
levels
promoted
in
the
global
climate
change
agreement
scientists
said
on
monday
the
metropolis
of
kolkata
in
india
stands
to
benefit
most
from
cutting
carbon
pollution
a
of
burning
fossil
fuels
like
oil
gas
and
coal
with
million
fewer
early
deaths
by
the
findings
come
as
nearly
countries
are
looking
at
ways
to
uphold
pledges
they
made
as
part
of
the
paris
accord
to
slash
emissions
of
gases
the
study
by
scientists
which
was
published
in
the
journal
nature
climate
change
showed
of
the
cities
are
on
the
indian
subcontinent
india
s
capital
delhi
and
its
northeastern
city
of
patna
along
with
bangladesh
s
capital
dhaka
and
pakistan
s
lahore
could
each
avoid
between
and
million
deaths
according
to
computer
models
applied
to
large
cities
they
have
very
weak
regulations
currently
said
drew
shindell
the
study
s
lead
author
and
a
professor
at
duke
university
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
ibadan
in
nigeria
bandung
and
jakarta
in
indonesia
and
dongguan
in
china
are
the
only
four
megacities
located
in
other
regions
of
the
world
that
could
also
see
more
than
a
million
people
s
lives
saved
with
less
air
pollution
the
study
said
to
arrive
at
their
conclusions
the
scientists
considered
deaths
indirectly
tied
to
carbon
dioxide
namely
those
due
to
and
ozone
gas
that
form
with
high
concentrations
of
carbon
shindell
said
by
phone
those
deaths
are
typically
caused
by
respiratory
ailments
and
cardiovascular
diseases
such
as
strokes
and
lung
cancer
the
researchers
said
our
cars
still
give
out
that
pollution
that
leads
to
particles
and
ozone
our
power
plants
do
our
furnaces
shindell
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
you
see
that
black
smoke
when
people
fire
up
their
oil
burners
in
the
winter
it
s
black
because
there
are
the
scientists
estimates
are
based
on
nations
achieving
the
carbon
emissions
cuts
necessary
to
meet
the
paris
accord
s
most
ambitious
target
of
keeping
the
global
temperature
hike
to
celsius
fahrenheit
above
times
but
according
to
a
draft
united
nations
report
seen
by
reuters
earlier
this
year
unless
governments
make
unprecedented
economic
shifts
from
fossil
fuels
temperatures
are
on
track
to
breach
the
limit
