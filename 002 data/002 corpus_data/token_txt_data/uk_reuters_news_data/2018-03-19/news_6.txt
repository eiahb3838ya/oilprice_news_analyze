france
and
its
arms
suppliers
face
heightened
legal
risks
for
supplying
weapons
to
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
despite
warnings
such
arms
could
be
used
in
the
war
in
yemen
a
law
firm
s
report
commissioned
by
human
rights
groups
said
on
monday
the
two
gulf
arab
states
are
leading
a
coalition
fighting
the
houthi
group
that
controls
most
of
northern
yemen
and
the
capital
sanaa
the
conflict
has
killed
more
than
people
and
displaced
more
than
three
million
the
report
follows
criticism
of
president
emmanuel
macron
by
rights
groups
and
french
lawmakers
over
his
support
for
the
coalition
opaque
arms
sales
and
inadequate
safeguards
to
prevent
its
weapons
being
used
in
yemen
operations
this
study
shows
a
legally
high
risk
that
france
s
arms
transfers
are
contrary
to
its
international
commitments

the
french
government
has
authorised
exports
of
military
equipment
to
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
in
circumstances
where
these
weapons
can
be
used
in
the
conflict
in
yemen
and
could
be
used
to
carry
out
war
asked
about
the
export
licensing
system
france
s
foreign
ministry
said
government
processes
are
robust
and
transparent
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
are
among
the
biggest
buyers
of
french
arms
receiving
tanks
armoured
vehicles
munitions
artillery
and
in
the
uae
s
case
fighter
jets
while
some
other
european
states
have
scaled
back
their
military
ties
with
the
coalition
britain
and
the
united
states
continue
to
pursue
them
the
report
came
at
an
awkward
time
for
macron
who
is
due
to
host
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
in
early
april
relations
are
more
strained
than
in
recent
years
however
french
officials
say
privately
they
have
already
told
weapons
suppliers
that
they
should
refrain
from
seeking
new
export
licences
for
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
i
don
t
think
you
ll
see
a
clear
pushback
from
us
what
s
more
likely
is
an
informal
message
to
companies
to
not
bother
asking
for
licences
said
a
french
diplomat
it
will
be
a
de
facto
restriction
but
without
saying
it
publicly
so
as
not
to
annoy
the
export
licensing
procedures
however
have
no
parliamentary
checks
or
balances
some
french
diplomats
and
aid
officials
say
there
is
no
evidence
paris
has
halted
or
reduced
its
arms
exports
to
the
two
countries
