the
world
should
look
to
nature
for
better
ways
to
maintain
supplies
of
water
keep
it
clean
and
protect
people
from
droughts
and
floods
the
united
nations
said
on
monday
as
the
global
population
expands
and
the
planet
warms
demand
for
water
is
rising
while
the
quality
and
reliability
of
our
water
supply
is
declining
the
edition
of
the
world
water
development
report
has
warned
one
response
is
to
invest
more
in
protecting
ecosystems
that
recycle
water
such
as
wetlands
and
vegetation
and
spend
less
on
concrete
flood
barriers
or
wastewater
treatment
plants
audrey
azoulay
of
the
educational
scientific
and
cultural
organization
unesco
which
coordinates
the
report
called
for
new
solutions
to
tackle
emerging
challenges
to
water
security
caused
by
population
growth
and
climate
change
if
we
do
nothing
some
five
billion
people
will
be
living
in
areas
with
poor
access
to
water
by
she
said
in
a
statement
demand
for
water
is
expected
to
increase
by
nearly
by
said
gilbert
houngbo
chair
of
in
the
report
s
foreword
to
help
manage
competing
demands
for
freshwater
whether
to
quench
human
thirst
water
crops
or
produce
electricity
the
report
recommended
working
with
nature
rather
than
against
it
in
a
bid
to
make
water
use
more
efficient
and
healthier
for
people
and
the
environment
for
too
long
the
world
has
turned
first
to
or
grey
infrastructure
to
improve
water
management
wrote
houngbo
in
so
doing
it
has
often
brushed
aside
traditional
and
indigenous
knowledge
that
embraces
greener
the
report
outlined
the
benefits
of
solutions
which
use
or
mimic
natural
processes
to
increase
water
availability
improve
its
quality
and
reduce
risks
linked
to
disasters
and
climate
change
those
solutions
include
changing
farming
practices
so
the
soil
retains
more
moisture
and
nutrients
harvesting
rainwater
aquifers
conserving
wetlands
that
capture
runoff
and
decontaminate
water
restoring
floodplains
and
turning
rooftops
into
gardens
the
report
cited
estimates
that
agricultural
production
could
be
increased
by
nearly
percent
worldwide
if
greener
water
management
practices
were
used
richard
connor
of
the
report
said
switching
to
a
conservation
agriculture
model
could
bring
high
and
rapid
returns
but
achieving
it
on
a
large
scale
would
require
political
will
at
the
national
level
agriculture
internationally
remains
dominated
by
industrial
farming
and
it
can
be
a
little
more
difficult
to
influence
the
interests
that
are
involved
he
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
but
some
companies
were
adopting
more
sustainable
practices
while
consumers
mainly
in
europe
and
north
america
increasingly
prefer
organic
locally
grown
food
he
added
inside
cities
the
challenge
is
to
capture
and
filter
more
water
using
green
infrastructure
from
water
retention
ponds
to
wild
spaces
that
double
up
for
leisure
activities
and
out
of
town
in
the
basins
on
which
cities
rely
water
users
like
farmers
need
to
cooperate
with
municipal
authorities
to
ensure
enough
clean
water
for
all
new
york
for
example
has
protected
its
three
biggest
watersheds
since
the
late
resulting
in
an
unfiltered
water
supply
that
brings
savings
of
more
than
million
per
year
on
water
treatment
and
maintenance
costs
the
report
said
grey
infrastructure
such
as
piped
water
to
slums
dams
to
control
water
flow
on
rivers
or
concrete
walls
to
keep
out
big
storm
surges
and
floods
would
still
be
needed
connor
said
yet
while
growing
amounts
are
spent
on
green
infrastructure
and
other
solutions
evidence
suggests
they
account
for
less
than
percent
of
total
investment
in
infrastructure
to
manage
water
resources
the
report
said
connor
pointed
to
the
extra
advantages
of
using
natural
ways
to
manage
water
including
the
potential
to
boost
biodiversity
jobs
health
and
carbon
storage
if
you
start
to
look
at
these
that
often
do
not
exist
with
grey
infrastructure
it
should
tip
the
investment
decisions
towards
more
solutions
