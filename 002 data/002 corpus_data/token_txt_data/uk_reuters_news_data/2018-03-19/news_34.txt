exclusive-rough justice? uk snubs call for gas storage capacity review
london
reuters
britain
has
rebuffed
calls
from
the
gas
industry
for
an
urgent
review
of
the
country
s
gas
storage
capacity
after
a
cold
snap
this
month
triggered
warnings
of
supply
shortages
and
gas
prices
spiked
to
their
highest
in
at
least
a
decade
operators
of
gas
storage
sites
industries
reliant
on
gas
and
developers
of
new
storage
projects
have
been
asking
for
an
inquiry
since
november
following
the
closure
of
the
rough
site
that
provided
percent
of
britain
s
gas
storage
capacity
they
met
officials
from
the
department
for
business
energy
and
industrial
strategy
beis
on
friday
but
the
government
declined
to
open
an
inquiry
saying
market
forces
would
ensure
there
was
enough
gas
according
to
two
people
who
attended
the
meeting
and
a
third
who
was
briefed
on
the
outcome
the
government
says
it
is
up
to
the
market
to
determine
whether
it
makes
sense
to
invest
in
new
gas
storage
and
if
there
are
any
supply
shortages
prices
will
rise
sufficiently
to
attract
more
gas
from
elsewhere
there
is
still
a
level
of
complacency
in
the
government
that
despite
recent
events
the
best
course
of
action
is
to
just
accept
these
price
shocks
said
clive
moffatt
of
consultancy
moffatt
associates
who
attended
the
meeting
and
represents
several
storage
developers
and
industry
associations
a
spokeswoman
for
beis
said
the
march
meeting
was
not
in
response
to
any
recent
events
and
no
inquiry
into
gas
price
and
supply
security
was
planned
we
take
gas
security
of
supply
seriously
which
is
why
we
regularly
and
comprehensively
test
our
assumptions
and
the
latest
evidence
she
said
the
surge
in
gas
prices
on
march
came
days
after
the
government
which
is
under
pressure
to
lower
heating
bills
introduced
a
law
in
parliament
that
would
cap
energy
costs
for
million
households
for
up
to
five
years
the
price
spikes
also
come
at
a
time
of
increased
focus
on
the
security
of
imports
following
tension
with
one
of
europe
s
main
gas
suppliers
russia
as
well
as
fears
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
could
hit
gas
imports
at
crunch
times
home
power
bills
have
doubled
in
britain
over
the
past
decade
to
an
average
of
about
pounds
a
year
wholesale
energy
prices
make
up
about
percent
of
domestic
bills
meaning
price
rises
are
likely
to
affect
some
consumers
utility
company
centrica
closed
rough
in
june
saying
it
had
become
too
costly
to
maintain
the
offshore
site
leaving
britain
with
storage
capacity
equivalent
to
four
to
five
days
of
winter
demand
down
from
days
previously
natural
gas
is
used
to
heat
about
percent
of
britain
s
homes
fuels
as
much
as
half
of
the
country
s
electricity
generation
at
times
and
is
vital
for
several
industries
such
as
ceramics
and
chemicals
britain
s
storage
levels
however
are
well
below
most
european
countries
germany
has
the
largest
capacity
with
some
billion
cubic
meters
times
that
of
britain
while
other
european
countries
such
as
italy
keep
strategic
gas
reserves
for
the
size
of
our
gas
market
we
have
pitifully
low
storage
levels
said
trevor
sikorski
analyst
at
consultancy
energy
aspects
a
decade
ago
domestic
north
sea
production
provided
almost
of
britain
s
gas
meaning
storage
was
less
of
an
issue
but
dwindling
reserves
mean
britain
provided
less
than
half
of
the
gas
it
used
in
and
that
could
drop
to
under
percent
by
according
to
national
grid
the
rough
closure
means
when
gas
demand
peaks
or
supplies
falter
there
is
no
large
buffer
to
ensure
all
immediate
needs
can
be
met
leading
to
huge
spikes
in
wholesale
prices
when
national
grid
issued
a
deficit
warning
on
march
the
wholesale
price
for
gas
for
immediate
delivery
trgbnbpwkd
hit
pence
per
therm
up
from
pence
the
previous
week
data
compiled
by
reuters
shows
the
closing
price
for
the
contract
has
averaged
pence
per
therm
over
the
current
winter
season
the
first
since
rough
closed
more
than
percent
higher
than
the
average
price
for
the
winter
season
britain
s
national
grid
the
company
that
owns
the
transmission
network
for
electricity
and
gas
and
balances
supply
and
demand
argues
that
storage
is
no
panacea
you
can
only
withdraw
a
certain
amount
of
storage
in
one
day
so
the
day
s
demand
would
never
be
met
by
storage
alone
a
spokeswoman
for
national
grid
said
she
said
on
any
given
day
britain
could
get
gas
from
its
north
sea
reserves
from
norway
via
pipelines
linked
to
continental
europe
from
shipments
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
or
from
storage
it
is
this
mix
that
enables
security
of
supply
she
said
operators
of
existing
sites
have
warned
that
britain
s
storage
capacity
could
get
even
tighter
in
the
coming
years
without
government
intervention
either
to
help
keep
sites
operating
or
to
subsidise
the
construction
of
new
ones
the
difference
between
gas
prices
in
summer
and
winter
has
narrowed
over
the
last
few
years
in
britain
making
it
less
profitable
to
buy
gas
in
the
warmer
months
store
it
and
sell
when
temperatures
fall
and
prices
rise
operators
said
the
economics
of
the
uk
s
gas
storage
sites
are
challenging
putting
a
question
mark
over
the
remaining
sites
said
a
spokesman
for
utility
sse
whose
aldbrough
and
hornsea
sites
provide
about
percent
the
remaining
capacity
companies
planning
new
storage
sites
want
the
government
to
determine
how
much
capacity
britain
needs
to
ensure
supply
and
prevent
price
spikes
and
then
find
ways
to
maintain
it
if
the
need
for
a
certain
level
of
storage
is
identified
then
the
government
could
create
something
similar
to
its
power
capacity
auction
which
pays
electricity
generators
a
subsidy
to
ensure
they
have
availability
when
needed
stag
energy
founder
and
managing
director
george
grant
said
stag
energy
a
power
generation
and
infrastructure
company
is
planning
to
build
an
million
pound
underground
gas
storage
site
in
the
irish
sea
connected
to
britain
s
gas
market
we
are
seeking
a
comprehensive
study
into
gas
price
security
and
what
the
appropriate
level
of
storage
for
the
uk
should
be
grant
said
proponents
of
greater
gas
storage
have
also
raised
concerns
about
britain
s
reliance
on
imports
in
the
light
of
increased
political
tensions
with
russia
following
a
nerve
toxin
attack
on
a
former
russian
double
agent
on
british
soil
prime
minister
theresa
may
said
last
week
britain
was
looking
to
countries
other
than
russia
for
gas
as
part
of
steps
being
taken
by
london
following
the
attack
the
energy
department
says
britain
typically
receives
less
than
percent
of
its
gas
from
russia
which
comes
via
pipelines
from
europe
but
this
year
supplies
of
lng
which
are
seen
as
one
of
the
major
sources
of
supply
flexibility
in
the
future
are
increasingly
coming
from
russia
so
far
this
year
two
russian
lng
cargoes
have
unloaded
at
british
terminals
for
domestic
consumption
accounting
for
about
a
third
of
britain
s
lng
imports
in
other
gas
imports
making
up
about
half
of
total
supply
come
via
interconnectors
with
norway
and
continental
europe
but
the
latter
could
be
affected
by
britain
s
departure
from
the
european
union
in
march
if
there
remains
frictionless
trade
with
the
eu
via
the
interconnectors
following
brexit
then
it
diminishes
the
case
for
domestic
storage
but
this
isn
t
certain
thierry
bros
senior
research
fellow
at
the
oxford
institute
for
energy
studies
said
the
eu
operates
a
solidarity
principle
regarding
gas
which
means
in
the
event
of
a
serious
crisis
member
states
are
expected
to
help
each
other
maintain
supplies
if
there
is
a
crisis
member
states
could
hold
on
to
gas
stocks
for
their
own
supplies
and
there
would
be
no
obligation
to
ship
to
britain
even
if
prices
are
higher
