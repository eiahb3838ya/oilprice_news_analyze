which

on

back
of
concerns
over

despite

supply
headlines
oil
prices
remain
firm
as
the
odds
that

will
pull
out
of

continue
to
run
very
high
said

brokerage
oanda
in

on
a
simple
supply
versus
demand
basis
however
global
oil
markets
are
facing
the
risk
of
returning
into
oversupply
after
being
in
a
slight
deficit
for
much
of
last
year
drillers
added
four
oil
rigs
in
the
week
to

bringing
the
total
count
to
the

hughes
drilling
report
said
on
friday
the
rig
count
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
much
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
as
energy
companies
have
continued
to
boost
spending
since
when
crude
prices
began
recovering
from
a
crash
thanks
to
the
high
drilling
activity
crude
oil
production
has
risen
by
more
than
a
fifth
since
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
pushing
it
past
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
only
russia
produces
more
at
around
million
bpd
although
output
is
expected
to
overtake
russia
s
later
this
year
as
well
soaring
output
as
well
as
rising
output
in
canada
and
brazil
is
undermining
efforts
by
the
middle
east
dominated
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
to
curb
supplies
and
bolster
prices
many
analysts
expect
global
oil
markets
to
flip
from
slight
undersupply
in
and
early
this
year
into
oversupply
