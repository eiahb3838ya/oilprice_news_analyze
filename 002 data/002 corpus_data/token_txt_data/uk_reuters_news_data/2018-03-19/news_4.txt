warsaw
reuters
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
monday
she
hoped
authorities
in
warsaw
would
satisfy
europe
s
concerns
over
the
rule
of
law
in
poland
as
the
two
countries
also
faced
gaps
to
bridge
over
migration
and
a
new
gas
pipeline
merkel
travelled
to
warsaw
on
her
second
foreign
trip
since
being
sworn
in
for
a
fourth
term
to
highlight
germany
s
commitment
to
poland
at
a
time
of
tension
relations
with
both
russia
and
the
united
states
following
a
meeting
with
prime
minister
mateusz
morawiecki
she
said
she
hoped
talks
between
poland
and
eu
authorities
would
be
successful
in
december
the
european
commission
launched
a
procedure
known
as
article
against
poland
over
reforms
that
brussels
says
undermine
the
independence
of
the
country
s
judiciary
i
hope
that
the
issue
of
article
proceedings
can
be
settled
merkel
said
via
a
translator
at
a
joint
conference
with
morawiecki
brussels
has
given
poland
three
months
to
address
its
concerns
morawiecki
said
poland
had
entered
a
constructive
dialogue
with
the
european
commission
i
can
say
that
there
is
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
that
we
will
reach
an
agreement
he
said
merkel
must
pull
off
a
delicate
balancing
act
reassuring
warsaw
about
berlin
s
commitment
to
nato
military
spending
targets
while
not
backing
away
from
the
eu
core
principles
that
the
european
commission
says
poland
has
undermined
neither
leader
mentioned
the
planned
nord
stream
pipeline
designed
to
ship
russian
gas
to
germany
avoiding
transit
through
ukraine
it
has
germany
s
approval
but
poland
has
urged
that
western
sanctions
be
imposed
on
it
ties
between
germany
and
poland
have
worsened
since
the
law
and
justice
party
pis
came
to
power
in
warsaw
in
with
the
two
countries
also
at
odds
over
poland
s
refusal
to
take
in
asylum
seekers
under
an
quota
system
i
am
confident
that
this
new
federal
government
will
approach
the
relations
with
new
energy
merkel
said
we
on
the
german
side
would
wish
good
intensive
friendly
relations
with
poland
for
the
good
of
europe
and
our
two
