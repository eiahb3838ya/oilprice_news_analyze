iraq
sent
money
to
pay
salaries
of
state
employees
in
the
kurdish
region
on
monday
for
the
first
time
since
the
baghdad
government
said
although
a
dispute
over
how
much
it
will
send
the
kurds
in
future
remains
unresolved
monday
s
agreement
represents
a
step
towards
normalising
relations
between
the
central
government
and
the
autonomous
kurdish
region
which
held
a
vote
for
independence
last
year
that
the
central
government
swiftly
crushed
under
the
constitution
the
kurdish
region
is
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
national
budget
but
that
arrangement
collapsed
in
when
iraq
s
army
fled
the
north
in
the
face
of
an
advance
by
islamic
state
militants
the
kurds
seized
control
of
iraq
s
main
northern
oil
fields
at
kirkuk
from
islamic
state
and
began
selling
kirkuk
s
oil
independently
baghdad
stopped
sending
money
to
the
kurds
last
year
after
islamic
state
was
driven
out
of
the
north
the
kurds
held
an
independence
referendum
voting
overwhelmingly
to
secede
but
the
central
government
responded
by
swiftly
launching
a
military
offensive
and
recapturing
control
of
kirkuk
which
quashed
the
kurdish
independence
bid
the
central
government
and
the
kurds
have
yet
to
agree
on
a
full
plan
to
resume
payments
from
baghdad
to
the
kurdish
region
the
budget
passed
in
parliament
earlier
this
month
despite
a
boycott
by
kurdish
lawmakers
calls
for
the
percent
of
total
revenue
allocated
to
the
kurds
to
be
cut
in
line
with
the
region
s
share
of
iraq
s
population
which
is
disputed
the
kurdish
region
still
conducts
independent
oil
sales
although
it
has
far
less
oil
to
sell
now
that
it
no
longer
controls
kirkuk
the
federal
finance
ministry
transferred
a
cash
sum
of
billion
iraqi
dinars
million
to
the
region
s
finance
ministry
baghdad
government
spokesman
saad

hadithi
said
the

regional
government
s
krg
salaries
for
a
month
for
employees
of
all
ministries
and
for
the
peshmerga
kurdish
security
forces
in
a
statement
the
krg
said
its
finance
ministry
had
received
the
transfer
and
would
distribute
it
asked
about
future
payments
to
the
krg
to
cover
salaries
hadithi
said
the
federal
government
would
agree
to
pay
a
portion
while
the
rest
should
be
covered
by
the
krg
from
its
oil
sales
other
measures
imposed
by
baghdad
to
curtail
the
kurdish
region
s
autonomy
in
the
wake
of
last
year
s
referendum
are
gradually
being
eased
including
a
ban
on
direct
international
flights
which
was
lifted
last
week
the
first
international
flight
landed
at
erbil
airport
on
monday
morning
however
the
issues
of
the
krg
s
independent
oil
sales
and
share
of
the
budget
remain
unresolved
baghdad
has
sent
teams
of
auditors
to
kurdistan
in
recent
months
to
assess
the
number
of
employees
on
the
region
s
payroll
a
statement
