london
march
reuters
share
markets
were
stuck
on
their
worst
run
since
november
on
monday
as
caution
gripped
traders
in
a
week
in
which
the
federal
reserve
is
likely
to
raise
interest
rates
and
perhaps
signal
as
many
as
three
more
lie
in
store
this
year
a
percent
drop
for
europe
s
main
bourses
amid
a
flurry
of
gloomy
company
news
and
weaker
wall
street
futures
meant
msci
s
main
world
stocks
index
was
down
for
a
fifth
day
the
caution
also
came
against
the
backdrop
of
global
trade
war
worries
which
are
set
to
dominate
a
meeting
starting
later
in
argentina
as
well
as
plenty
of
idiosyncratic
factors
facebook
shares
slumped
percent
in
premarket
trading
after
reports
that
million
of
its
users
data
had
been
misused
by
a
political
consultancy
firm
ahead
of
the
election
and
brexit
vote
london
s
ftse
was
down
double
the
rest
of
europe
as
a
savage
profit
warning
wiped
more
than
half
the
value
off
one
of
its
big
tech
firms
even
as
a
brexit
transition
deal
gave
the
pound
its
best
day
in
almost
two
months
against
the
euro
a
reuters
report
that
the
ecb
is
starting
to
think
a
bit
more
about
the
future
pace
of
euro
zone
interest
rate
rises
helped
the
euro
recover
from
a
difficult
morning
against
the
dollar
it
had
struggled
as
the
gap
between
german
and
government
yields
referred
to
as
the
transatlantic
spread
ratcheted
out
to
its
widest
since
december
many
analysts
had
been
expecting
that
spread
to
be
narrowing
as
the
ecb
nears
the
end
of
its
stimulus
programme
but
it
hasn
t
proved
the
case
the
borrowing
cost
gap
is
near
its
widest
level
in
over
years
there
has
been
the
narrative
of
supposed
policy
convergence
between
the
ecb
and
the
fed
but
that
is
just
not
the
reality
said
saxo
bank
s
head
of
fx
strategy
john
hardy
with
as
many
as
four
hikes
seen
this
year
expectations
were
chomping
at
the
max
he
added
weakness
in
equity
markets
was
almost
worldwide
meanwhile
japan
s
nikkei
had
ended
down
almost
percent
as
its
exporters
were
hit
by
more
overnight
strength
in
the
yen
which
eventually
reversed
in
early
trading
the
rest
of
asia
had
struggled
too
though
china
did
manage
to
eke
out
some
gains
as
beijing
announced
a
new
economic
team
it
included
a
surprise
new
central
bank
chief
but
for
the
most
part
was
largely
as
anticipated
and
is
expected
to
keep
the
focus
on
halting
riskier
types
of
lending
in
the
giant
economy
wall
street
look
set
to
lose
more
ground
when
new
york
reopens
having
seen
the
dow
lose
percent
last
week
the
s
p
drop
percent
and
the
nasdaq
percent
the
decline
was
somewhat
surprising
given
figures
from
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
showed
a
record
billion
of
inflows
into
equities
last
week
outpacing
bond
flows
for
the
first
time
since
whether
the
cash
continues
to
flow
could
depend
on
what
the
fed
decides
on
wednesday
all
analysts
polled
by
reuters
expected
the
fed
would
raise
rates
to
between
percent
and
percent
on
wednesday
they
were
less
certain
on
whether
the
dot
plot
forecasts
of
committee
members
will
stay
at
three
hikes
this
year
or
shift
higher
it
will
also
be
the
first
press
conference
for
new
fed
chair
jerome
powell
expected
is
a
confident
fed
chair
both
with
respect
to
the
economy
s
strength
and
the
fed
s
approach
to
policy
said
analysts
at
westpac
in
a
note
gradual
and
timely
are
the
operative
words
for
analysts
at
jpmorgan
however
see
a
risk
the
fed
might
not
only
add
one
more
rate
rise
for
this
year
but
for
as
well
the
worst
case
is
the
and
dots
both
move
up
the
fed
is
currently
guiding
to
five
hikes
in
and
combined
but
under
this
scenario
that
would
shift
to
seven
hikes
they
warned
in
a
note
to
clients
stocks
would
probably
tolerate
one
net
dot
increase
over
and
but
a
bump
in
both
years
could
create
any
nod
to
four
hikes
would
normally
be
considered
as
bullish
for
the
dollar
yet
the
currency
has
shown
scant
overall
correlation
to
interest
rates
in
recent
months
reasons
cited
by
dealers
include
concerns
about
the
budget
and
current
account
deficits
political
chaos
at
the
white
house
better
growth
in
competing
countries
particularly
europe
and
the
risk
of
a
trade
war
trade
will
be
top
of
the
agenda
at
a
meeting
starting
later
on
monday
in
buenos
aires
and
any
signs
of
escalating
stress
between
the
and
china
could
make
investors
in
asia
nervous
as
trading
began
the
dollar
had
recovered
to
yen
having
been
as
low
as
overnight
though
its
wilt
against
the
euro
left
it
around
percent
weaker
against
a
basket
of
currencies
at
just
below
the
prospect
of
higher
interest
rates
was
been
a
burden
for
gold
which
slipped
percent
last
week
on
the
day
the
metal
was
down
at
per
ounce
oil
prices
eased
after
ending
last
week
with
a
solid
bounce
brent
futures
dropped
as
much
as
cents
to
a
barrel
while
crude
futures
for
april
which
expire
on
tuesday
dipped
as
far
as
cents
to
a
barrel
