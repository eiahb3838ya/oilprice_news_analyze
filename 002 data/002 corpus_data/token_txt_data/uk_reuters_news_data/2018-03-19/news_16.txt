told

the
plan
was
to
replicate
this
with
other
mining
projects
it
s
gathering
pace
in
terms
of
interest
in
all
the
discussions
we
ve
had
with
our
contacts
in
the
mining
industry
fleurence
said
he
declined
to
give
details
of
potential
future
deals
mining
companies
operating
in
remote
areas
have
long
relied
on
thermal
power
plants
making
their
operations
and
their
costs
vulnerable
to
fluctuations
in
world
oil
prices
as
the
price
of
photovoltaic
panels
has
dropped
in
recent
years
several
mining
operations
have
added
solar
capacity
to
help
cut
power
costs
however
most
of
those
projects
have
been
relatively
small
the
essakane
plant
made
up
of
nearly
solar
panels
is
expected
to
decrease
the
mine
s
fuel
consumption
by
some
million
litres
per
year
and
reduce
emissions
by
around
tonnes
per
year
the
gold
mine
will
buy
the
entirety
of
the
plant
s
production
via
a
power
purchasing
agreement
signed
with
a
company
in
which
total
eren
owns
a
percent
stake
aemp
total
eren
s
strategic
partner
for
its
industrial
and
mining
business
in
africa
holds
the
remaining
percent
we
do
see
this
as
likely
to
be
adopted
more
and
more
going
