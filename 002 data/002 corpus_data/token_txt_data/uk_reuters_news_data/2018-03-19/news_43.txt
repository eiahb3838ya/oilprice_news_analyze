the
market
narrative
consuming
crude
oil
markets
currently
is
the
interplay
between
supply
cuts
by
opec
and
its
allies
and
rising
shale
output
with
a
side
helping
of
chinese
imports
driving
demand
while
there
are
solid
reasons
for
industry
participants
to
focus
on
these
dynamics
there
is
also
the
risk
of
missing
out
on
other
factors
that
help
shape
the
market
such
a
factor
is
india
which
has
long
flown
below
the
radar
of
the
crude
oil
market
despite
becoming
the
importer
in
the
asian
market
behind
china
and
the
in
the
world
after
the
united
states
india
is
also
a
market
where
there
is
virtually
no
direct
influence
being
exerted
by
shale
oil
as
the
south
asian
nation
hardly
imports
any
crude
from
the
united
states
it
also
imports
a
relatively
small
amount
from
russia
the
main
ally
in
the
agreement
between
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
countries
and
other
producers
to
limit
output
in
order
to
drain
excess
global
inventories
thereby
boosting
crude
prices
but
what
makes
india
important
is
that
it
s
a
major
importer
of
middle
eastern
crudes
and
one
of
the
demand
centres
in
the
world
and
there
are
currently
some
worrying
trends
for
middle
eastern
exporters
to
india
especially
for
the
region
s
top
shipper
saudi
arabia
the
international
energy
agency
iea
put
india
s
crude
oil
demand
at
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
in
its
report
released
last
month
and
estimated
that
this
year
will
see
demand
rise
to
million
bpd
an
increase
of
percent
the
iea
expects
total
world
oil
demand
to
increase
by
million
bpd
which
makes
india
s
expected
growth
of
some
bpd
the
most
significant
source
of
growth
for
crude
producers
outside
of
china
s
expected
lift
in
demand
of
about
bpd
india
has
traditionally
bought
the
bulk
of
its
crude
oil
from
the
middle
east
which
makes
sense
give
the
geographic
proximity
and
the
decision
of
india
s
refiners
to
focus
on
processing
heavier
grades
through
complex
plants
in
order
to
maximise
the
value
of
fuels
produced
however
despite
the
overall
growth
in
india
s
crude
demand
in
the
volume
of
imports
from
the
middle
east
dropped
by
percent
to
around
million
bpd
according
to
data
obtained
from
sources
and
compiled
by
thomson
reuters
oil
research
and
forecasts
saudi
arabia
lost
its
status
as
india
s
biggest
oil
supplier
with
imports
from
the
kingdom
dropping
percent
to
around
bpd
the
data
showed
other
losers
from
the
middle
east
included
iran
with
a
percent
drop
to
bpd
and
the
united
arab
emirates
with
a
percent
slump
to
bpd
the
region
s
winner
in
exporting
to
india
was
iraq
which
increased
percent
to
bpd
most
likely
as
a
result
of
baghdad
s
willingness
to
offer
deeper
discounts
on
its
heavier
grades
of
crude
compared
to
similar
grades
from
other
exporters
if
the
middle
east
overall
was
surrendering
market
share
in
india
the
main
gainers
were
two
latin
american
exporters
with
brazil
s
shipments
jumping
percent
to
bpd
and
those
from
mexico
by
percent
to
bpd
among
smaller
suppliers
to
india
there
were
some
impressive
gains
from
countries
such
as
egypt
which
was
up
percent
to
bpd
sudan
with
a
gain
of
percent
to
bpd
and
algeria
which
rose
percent
to
bpd
while
many
of
these
increases
were
off
very
small
volumes
they
have
the
potential
to
become
more
important
in
coming
years
if
brazil
and
mexico
can
compete
in
india
despite
a
sea
voyage
of
at
least
four
times
the
distance
when
compared
to
cargoes
from
the
persian
gulf
that
should
be
a
worry
for
middle
east
producers
india
s
refineries
have
shown
they
can
be
quite
flexible
in
the
crude
slates
they
process
and
it
appears
that
the
output
cuts
instituted
by
opec
and
its
allies
is
encouraging
more
diverse
sources
of
supply
the
risk
for
opec
and
its
allies
is
that
this
sort
of
market
share
is
hard
to
recover
once
the
production
cuts
are
lifted
and
as
india
shows
the
battle
is
far
more
than
just
a
simple
opec
and
allies
versus
shale
producers
