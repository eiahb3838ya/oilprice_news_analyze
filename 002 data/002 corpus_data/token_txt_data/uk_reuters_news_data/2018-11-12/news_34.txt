the
dollar
surged
to
nearly
highs
on
monday
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
as
investors
sought
out
the
liquid
and
asset
against
a
backdrop
of
global
growth
worries
and
rising
political
risk
in
italy
and
britain
world
stocks
fell
percent
for
a
third
straight
day
in
the
red
receiving
no
respite
from
a
rise
in
oil
prices
while
initial
european
equity
gains
fizzled
amid
growing
fears
for
italian
lender
carige
whose
shares
were
suspended
after
reports
of
a

investors
are
fretting
about
signs
of
slowing
growth
worldwide
but
especially
in
china
where
giant
alibaba
was
the
latest
to
raise
alarm
bells
with
the
slowest
ever
annual
sales
growth
during
its
singles
day
shopping
event
many
also
reckon
that
president
donald
trump
could
turn
up
the
heat
over

further
damaging
china
s
economy
all
that
coupled
with
european
political

king

has
staged

valentin
marinov
head
of

said
adding
that
investors
had
piled
back
into
the

after
last

a
path
euro
and

are
both
hurt
by

and
that

marinov
said
sterling
lost
more
than
one
percent
at
one
point
holding
near
a
low
hit
earlier
while
the
euro
comprising
more
than
percent
of
the

index
fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since
july
british
prime
minister
theresa
may
s
brexit
strategy
came
under
attack
from
all
sides
increasing
the
risk
that
her
plan
for
leaving
the
european
union
will
be
voted
down
by
parliament
thrusting
the
united
kingdom
towards
a
potentially
chaotic
brexit
the
opposition
labour
party
said
that
if
may
s
brexit
deal
was
voted
down
in
parliament
it
would
push
for
a
national
election
and
possibly
also
another
referendum

italy
faces
a
tuesday
deadline
to
submit
a
revised

spooked
by
reports
that
banca
carige
would
need
around
million
euros
million
to
plug
a
hole
in
its
capital
base
and
italy
s
deposit
protection
fund
could
fill
only
part
of
it
that

spectre
of
