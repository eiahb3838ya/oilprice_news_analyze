hailed

from

the
country
could
still
attract

nearly
two
years
after
the
sale
was
first
announced
nine
sources
with
knowledge
of
the
transaction
have
told
reuters
that
vtb
a
russian
bank
itself
financed
a
large
share
of
the
acquisition
undermining
the

stated
aim
to
bring
foreign
money
into
the
country
based
on
accounts
from
five
of
the
sources
the
value
of
the
russian
loan
to
the
qatari
sovereign
wealth
fund
is
around
billion

denied
it
issued

authority
qia
vtb
has
not
issued
and
is
not
planning
to
issue
a
loan
to

finance
the
vtb
data
for
september
published
by
the
russian
central
bank
showed
that
vtb
loaned
billion
roubles
billion
for
up
to
three
years
to
unnamed
foreign
borrowers
after
having
raised
billion
roubles
via
loans
from
the
central
bank
itself
vtb
s
financial
results
published
on
showed
that
during
the
third
quarter
the
volume
of
loans
to
its
biggest
borrowers
had
gone
up
by
billion
roubles
or
approximately
billion

rosneft
the
world
s
biggest
listed
oil
company
by
output
is
the
jewel
in
russia
s
corporate
crown
but
with
russia
under
sanctions
and
facing
the
prospect
of
more
sanctions
to
come
sechin
faced
an
uphill
task
in
finding
buyers
or
creditors
willing
to
risk
their
own
money
to
acquire
a
stake
in
rosneft
the
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
and
european
union
in
the
aftermath
of
russia
s
annexation
of
ukraine
s
crimea
region
limit
the
access
of
russian
firms
to
international
debt
markets
in
the
end
to
get
foreign
investors
on
board
russia
has
had
to
loan
them
billions
according
to
the
sources
account
two
sources
familiar
with
the
deal
said
that
having
a
third
party
finance
a
large
part
of
the
acquisition
was
a
condition
for
qatar
taking
the
stake
with
oil
prices
today
significantly
higher
than
in
late
russia
s
need
for
foreign
money
has
subsided
but
should
it
need
to
tap
international
markets
again
the
story
of
the
rosneft
sale
points
to
the
challenges
it
could
face
in
bringing
investors
on
board
especially
as
the
united
states
levies
more
sanctions
against
russia
the
nine
sources
who
told
reuters
about
the
vtb
loan
to
qatar
included
a
source
close
to
vtb
management
a
russian
central
bank
official
and
a
russian
government
source
familiar
with
foreign
investments
in
russia
at
least
four
of
the
sources
were
directly
involved
in
preparations
for
the
loan
all
the
sources
requested
anonymity
because
they
are
not
authorised
to
discuss
the
deal
in
response
to
questions
about
how
the
privatisation
of
its
stake
as
a
whole
was
conducted
rosneft
said
the
deal
was
and
transparent
and
in
the
interests
of
all
shareholders
it
said
all
decisions
relating
to
the
deal
underwent
the
relevant
procedures
for
corporate
approval
that
the
deal
was
supported
by
governments
where
participants
are
based
and
was
subject
to
compliance
procedures
in
the
relevant
jurisdictions
this
is
a
unique
example
of
an
effective
privatisation
rosneft
said
in
a
statement
as
the
end
of
drew
nearer
sechin
one
of
putin
s
closest
lieutenants
was
under
pressure
the
government
had
publicly
announced
it
would
sell
a
percent
stake
in
rosneft
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
state
budget
battered
by
a
collapse
in
oil
prices
an
economic
slump
and
the
impact
of
western
sanctions
was
showing
a
deficit
of
percent
russia
s
economy
was
in
its
second
year
of
recession
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
a
quick
improvement
in
public
finances
by
the
autumn
sechin
who
is
now
thought
he
had
a
buyer
the
united
arab
emirates
sovereign
wealth
fund
mubadala
according
to
two
sources
familiar
with
the
developments
mubadala
agreed
to
buy
the
stake
but
negotiations
hit
a
snag
after
rosneft
twice
changed
the
price
tag
the
two
sources
said
prompting
the
emiratis
to
walk
away
from
the
deal
mubadala
declined
to
comment
rosneft
did
not
address
questions
about
the
mubadala
discussions
sechin
turned
east
and
started
talks
with
japanese
officials
according
to
a
russian
government
official
a
source
close
to
rosneft
and
a
recording
of
a
conversation
involving
sechin
that
emerged
as
part
of
an
unrelated
court
case
in
which
sechin
was
a
witness
the
talks
were
held
primarily
with
the
japanese
economy
trade
and
industry
minister
hiroshige
seko
if
the
deal
was
agreed
the
owner
of
the
stake
would
have
become
a
large
state
japanese
investment
fund
such
as
gpif
the
government
pension
investment
fund
which
has
over
trillion
assets
under
management
or
japan
oil
gas
and
metals
national
corp
jogmec
three
sources
familiar
with
the
discussions
told
reuters
that
deal
also
ran
into
difficulties
according
to
sechin
s
account
in
the
recording
played
in
court
when
japan
insisted
on
linking
it
to
progress
in
a
territorial
dispute
with
russia
dating
back
to
the
end
of
world
war
two
eventually
the
deal
collapsed
japan
s
ministry
of
economy
trade
and
industry
did
not
respond
to
questions
rosneft
did
not
address
reuters
questions
about
discussions
with
japan
jogmec
s
press
service
said
it
could
not
comment
gpif
said
it
could
not
comment
on
a
discussion
between
governments
because
it
was
not
directly
involved
still
without
a
buyer
sechin
focused
on
two
new
potential
suitors
qatar
s
investment
fund
qia
and
global
commodities
trader
glencore
neither
was
prepared
to
put
up
all
of
the
asking
price
according
to
three
sources
in
the
past
rosneft
had
gone
to
major
western
banks
such
as
deutsche
bank
and
jp
morgan
to
finance
transactions
but
the
big
international
lenders
have
announced
no
major
new
loan
deals
with
rosneft
since
sanctions
were
imposed
in
in
stepped
intesa
sanpaolo
a
italian
lender
which
had
little
experience
in
large
russian
corporate
deals
by
early
december
financing
for
the
deal
was
falling
into
place
the
buyers
put
in
some
of
their
own
money
qatar
gave
billion
euros
and
glencore
million
euros
the
rest
was
debt
of
which
intesa
put
up
billion
euros
the
balance
according
to
glencore
at
the
time
would
come
from
unnamed
russian
banks
the
amount
coming
from
the
russian
banks
was
about
billion
two
banking
sources
close
to
rosneft
told
reuters
that
vtb
was
one
of
the
banks
that
between
them
put
up
billion
in
loans
back
in
those
sources
said
the
other
russian
banks
involved
were
gazprombank
and
otkritie
which
like
vtb
have
kremlin
connections
although
otkritie
was
privately
held
at
the
time
it
is
not
clear
what
share
of
the
billion
each
of
the
three
banks
contributed
that
contribution
from
vtb
towards
the
billion
was
separate
to
around
billion
that
according
to
the
nine
sources
vtb
provided
to
qatar
this
year
in
response
to
questions
about
the
initial
billion
in
loans
vtb
said
it
did
not
provide
financing
but
it
was
the
coordinating
bank
on
behalf
of
rosneft
otkritie
declined
to
comment
gazprombank
did
not
respond
to
questions
for
the
larger
portion
of
the
financing
the
billion
euros
loaned
by
intesa
the
italian
bank
s
intention
was
to
syndicate
the
loan
a
common
industry
practice
designed
to
spread
the
risk
and
dilute
the
burden
on
the
bank
s
own
capital
but
two
banking
sources
and
a
source
familiar
with
the
italian
side
of
the
deal
said
the
syndication
failed
because
european
banks
approached
by
intesa
were
worried
about
the
risk
that
providing
finance
for
rosneft
even
if
indirectly
would
result
in
them
falling
foul
of
western
sanctions
on
russia
rosneft
and
sechin
are
both
subject
to
sanctions
intesa
declined
to
comment
at
the
time
of
the
december
announcement
and
in
the
weeks
afterwards
russian
officials
spoke
publicly
of
a
partnership
with
the
new
rosneft
shareholders
qatar
and
glencore
but
it
became
clear
that
the
agreement
was
still
in
flux
when
in
september
sechin
said
a
deal
had
been
signed
for
chinese
energy
firm
cefc
to
buy
percent
of
rosneft
from
qatar
and
glencore
explaining
why
the
original
deal
had
not
stuck
he
told
russian
state
television
the
new
shareholders
were
finding
the
cost
of
servicing
the
debt
too
high
the
chinese
deal
though
was
never
closed
before
it
was
sealed
cefc
s
founder
and
chairman
ye
jianming
was
taken
in
for
questioning
and
investigated
by
chinese
authorities
for
suspected
economic
crimes
since
then
there
has
been
no
word
on
the
status
of
the
investigation
or
if
ye
has
been
charged
he
was
named
however
in
a
graft
trial
of
a
senior
communist
party
official
state
broadcaster
cctv
reported
last
month
neither
ye
nor
cefc
responded
to
calls
from
reuters
seeking
comment
once
again
sechin
was
in
search
of
a
buyer
finally
in
may
this
year
qatar
agreed
to
take
on
the
part
of
the
stake
that
had
been
covered
by
intesa
officially
no
one
has
said
how
the
new
deal
with
qatar
is
being
financed
or
who
is
providing
the
finance
it
is
clear
that
intesa
s
role
has
ended
a
document
dated
and
lodged
with
singapore
s
official
business
register
where
the
vehicle
that
held
the
stake
on
behalf
of
qatar
and
glencore
is
registered
stated
that
intesa
had
ceased
to
be
the
creditor
for
the
stake
and
no
longer
held
shares
as
collateral
the
document
did
not
state
who
was
the
new
creditor
according
to
the
nine
sources
familiar
with
the
arrangement
that
new
creditor
is
vtb
