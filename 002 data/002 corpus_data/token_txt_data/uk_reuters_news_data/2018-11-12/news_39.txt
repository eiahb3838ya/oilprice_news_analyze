the
envoy
for
libya
hopes
another
attempt
to
hold
an
election
will
take
place
by
june
after
he
scrapped
a
december
plan
but
said
libyans
should
first
use
a
national
conference
in
early
to
decide
on
the
poll
s
format
special
envoy
ghassan
salame
decided
to
abandon
a
plan
to
hold
elections
on
after
a
spike
in
violence
in
libya
which
has
been
gripped
by
conflict
and
paralysed
by
political
deadlock
since
the
overthrow
of
muammar
gaddafi
in
salame
was
speaking
to
reuters
before
the
start
of
a
conference
in
palermo
organised
by
rome
with
the
aim
of
pushing
forward
a
new
plan
salame
said
last
week
this
plan
would
include
an
election
in
the
spring
without
elaborating
at
monday
s
interview
the
envoy
said
this
meant
the
vote
would
be
held
between
late
march
and
late
june
but
that
the
format
of
the
poll
would
depend
on
what
was
decided
at
the
national
conference
scheduled
for
early
we
want
to
ask
at
the
national
conference
what
type
of
election
do
you
want
parliamentary
or
presidential
and
what
kind
of
law
salame
said
the
envoy
said
the
national
conference
should
preferably
take
place
on
libyan
soil
he
said
surveys
had
shown
that
percent
of
libyans
want
elections
to
end
the
stalemate
between
libya
s
rival
administrations
both
of
which
are
backed
by
armed
groups
salame
said
he
hoped
the
palermo
conference
would
put
pressure
on
libya
s
internationally
recognised
parliament
the
house
of
representatives
hor
which
has
refused
to
approve
an
election
law
the
hor
has
been
sterile
has
produced
no
law
i
think
we
need
wider
representation
of
the
libyans
he
said
salame
also
called
on
the
central
bank
to
unify
the
exchange
rate
of
the
dinar
to
the
dollar
to
prevent
armed
groups
with
access
to
cheap
dollars
from
selling
them
on
the
black
market
at
a
premium
libya
had
introduced
a
fee
on
hard
currency
transactions
which
had
helped
to
lower
the
spread
between
official
and
black
market
rate
but
a
unified
rate
was
needed
we
applaud
the
results
we
want
this
exchange
rate
to
go
even
lower
