washington
reuters
the
environmental
protection
agency
will
announce
plans
to
propose
new
rules
to
significantly
decrease
emissions
of
nitrogen
oxide
from
trucks
an
agency
official
said
industry
groups
and
state
environmental
officials
have
urged
the
epa
to
set
new
nationwide
rules
as
the
state
of
california
has
been
moving
forward
with
plans
to
set
new
state
emissions
limits
california
also
wants
nationwide
rules
in
part
because
more
than
half
of
all
trucks
delivering
goods
in
the
state
are
registered
in
other
states
the
epa
said
in
a
statement
it
had
scheduled
a
formal
announcement
on
tuesday
with
industry
executives
and
state
environmental
officials
regarding
its
cleaner
trucks
initiative
but
did
not
immediately
disclose
details
the
effort
to
impose
a
new
regulatory
limit
by
the
epa
comes
as
the
trump
administration
has
generally
touted
its
efforts
to
eliminate
regulations
but
the
effort
on
nitrogen
oxide
nox
is
backed
by
industry
which
wants
to
avoid
a
patchwork
of
federal
and
state
standards
the
official
said
the
official
asked
not
to
be
identified
because
the
announcement
was
still
pending
in
december
the
epa
said
in
response
to
petitions
to
impose
new
standards
that
it
acknowledged
a
need
for
additional
nox
reductions
from
engines
particularly
in
areas
of
the
country
with
elevated
levels
of
air
pollution
and
said
it
planned
to
propose
new
rules
that
could
begin
in
the
model
year
local
and
state
air
quality
and
other
agencies
including
new
york
city
new
hampshire
rhode
island
los
angeles
washington
state
had
petitioned
for
the
rules
another
administration
official
said
monday
the
new
proposed
emissions
rules
may
not
be
written
and
announced
until
nitrogen
oxide
emissions
are
linked
to
significant
health
impacts
and
can
exacerbate
asthma
attacks
the
epa
has
said
the
current
truck
rules
for
nox
were
adopted
in
and
took
effect
over
the
following
decade
in
the
aftermath
of
volkswagen
ag
s
diesel
emissions
scandal
in
which
the
german
automaker
admitted
to
secretly
using
software
to
evade
emissions
rules
the
epa
has
taken
steps
to
insure
that
diesel
cars
and
suvs
are
meeting
emissions
requirements
in
use
the
new
nox
truck
rules
may
also
include
new
tests
or
other
regulatory
steps
to
ensure
that
vehicles
and
their
engines
are
complying
during
driving
