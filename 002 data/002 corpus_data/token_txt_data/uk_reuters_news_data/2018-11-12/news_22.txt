billion

the

comes

developers
have
run

problems
lining
up
agreements
to

due

on

making
it

new

a

the

this

by
the
existing

much
more
geared
to

from

plants
while
new
solar
and

farms
are
generally
being
built
in
outlying
areas
with

federal

facing

over

are
also
desperate
to
drive
down

sensitive

avert

the
rise

retailers
better

harwin
told

transgrid
owned
by
a
consortium
led
by
spark
infrastructure
group
said
the
state
had
agreed
to
provide
a
funding
guarantee
for
early
planning
work
for
the
four
transmission
projects
while
the
company
seeks
regulatory
approval
for
its
plans
although
these
projects
have
a
construction
cost
the
benefits
they
deliver
through
increased
competition
and
reduced
wholesale
prices
will
deliver
greater
benefits
and
therefore
savings
to
new
south

consumers
