recording
the

its

has
weakened
amid
rising
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the
united
states
that
have
taken
a
bite
out
of
china
s
economy
an

even
as
the

rebounded
from
last

string
of

gain
percent
risk
asset
markets
have
been
under
intense
pressure
of
late
as
fears
of
a
peak
in

growth
added
to
anxiety
about
slowing
global
trade
and
investment
a
spike
in
bond
yields
driven
by
the
federal
reserve
s
commitment
to
keep
raising

costs
has
also
shaken
emerging

losses
came
after
the
fed
held
rates
steady
earlier
in
the
week
but
stayed
on
track
to
tighten
policy
next

the
fed
s
stance
disappointed
some
investors
who
had
hoped
that
october
s
rout
in

might
have
prompted
policy
makers
to
take
a
more
cautious

saudi

s
energy
minister
said
on
sunday
that
riyadh
plans
to
reduce
its
oil
supply
to
world
markets
by
barrels
per
day
in
december
a
global
reduction
of
about
percent
that
helped
to
lift
oil
prices
on
monday
with
crude
rising

to
a
barrel
and
brent
crude
gaining
percent
to
per

however
saudi
arabia
s
supply
cut
may
prove
to
be
a
temporary
solution
to
falling
prices
as
global

slows
