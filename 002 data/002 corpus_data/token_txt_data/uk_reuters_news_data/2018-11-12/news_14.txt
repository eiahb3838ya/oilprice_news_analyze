and
a

of

the

said
some
staff
from
edf
s
nuclear
plants
would
gather
at
the
firm
s
paris
headquarters
for
a
protest
on
tuesday
and
added
that
power
output
was
expected
to
be
reduced
due
to
the
action
from
monday
night
another
strike
is
scheduled
for
with
the
aim
of
keeping
pressure
on
edf
and
the
government
over
salary
negotiations
and
the
future
of
the
utility
the
government
is
expected
to
present
a
new
energy
policy
at
the
end
of
the
month
which
is
expected
to
outline
how
france
will
reduce
its
dependence
on
nuclear
power
boost
renewables
and
curb
carbon
emissions
and
which
might
indicate
how
edf
could
be
restructured
we
are
in
a
period
of
uncertainty
with
regards
to
french
energy
policy
and
this
concern
is
very
high
among
workers
in
gas
and
electricity
companies
sebastien
menesplier
secretary
general
of
cgt
s
mines
and
energy
branch
fmne
told
a
news
conference
he
added
that
edf
had
offered
a
percent
salary
increase
which
the
cgt
had
rejected
because
inflation
is
expected
at
percent
to
keep
the
pressure
on
edf
the
union
has
been
delaying
the
restart
of
several
reactors
during
planned
maintenance
costing
edf
several
millions
of
euros
for
every
day
of
delay
sources
have
said
that
there
are
various
scenarios
under
consideration
for
a
possible
restructuring
of
edf
which
could
involve
putting
its
nuclear
activities
in
a
separate
entity
breaking
up
the
edf
model
would
be
a
purely
capitalistic
move
which
we
are
against
menesplier
said
french
environment
minister
francois
de
rugy
has
said
the
government
was
considering
all
options
for
edf
including
the
status
quo
cgt
warned
that
just
as
it
has
done
with
partially
energy
group
engie
a
former
gas
monopoly
the
government
wants
to
break
up
edf
so
as
to
get
cash
from
the
sale
of
various
units
such
a
breakup
could
be
harmful
to
consumers
workers
and
france
s
security
of
power
supply

union
