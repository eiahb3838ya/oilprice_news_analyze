after
saudi
arabia
said
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
partners
believed
demand
was
softening
enough
to
warrant
an
output
cut
of
million
barrels
per
day
next

saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
opec
and
its
allies
agree
that
technical
analysis
shows
a
need
to
cut
oil
supply
next
year
by
around
million
bpd
from
october
levels
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
largest
oil
exporter
said
on
sunday
it
would
cut
its

by
half
a
million
bpd
in

a

capital
management
in
new

referring
to
the
time
period
when
opec
and
its
allies
agreed
to
initiate
production
cuts
the
saudis
and
russians
especially
rushed
production
to
market
to
offset
losses
that
aren
t
the
market
had
anticipated
that
exports
from
opec
member
iran
would
fall
precipitously
following
the
institution
of
sanctions
in
november
however
the
has
granted
waivers
to
certain
major

diminishing
the
expected
cuts
opec
and
the
international
energy
agency
release
their
respective
monthly
reports
on
the
outlook
for
oil
supply
and
demand
later
this
week
oil
prices
have
fallen
around
percent
in
the
last
month
hit
by
an
increase
in
global
supply
and
the
threat
of
a
slowdown
in
demand
especially
from
customers
whose
currencies
have
weakened
against
the
dollar
and
eroded
their
purchasing
power
output
from
the
world
s
top
oil
producers
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
has
risen
by
million
bpd
in
the
last
three
months
based
on
official
output
figures
this
has
left
opec
scrambling
to
adjust
its
own
output
which
at
around
million
bpd
accounts
for
roughly
a
third
of
global
supply
an
official
from
group
member
kuwait
said
on
monday
major
oil
exporters
had
over
the
weekend
discussed
a
proposal
for
some
kind
of
cut
in
crude
supply
next
year
although
the
official
did
not
provide
any
detail
one
of
opec
s
biggest
problems
is
the
surge
in
output
one
thing
that
is
abundantly
clear
opec
is
in
for
a
shale
shocker
as
crude
production
increased
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
and
will
cross
the
million
threshold
next
year
