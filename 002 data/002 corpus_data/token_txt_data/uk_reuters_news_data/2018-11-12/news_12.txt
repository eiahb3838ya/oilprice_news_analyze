iran
has
continued
to
implement
the
main
nuclear
restrictions
set
by
its
deal
with
major
powers
even
as
the
united
states
reimposed
sanctions
against
tehran
a
atomic
watchdog
report
showed
on
monday
iran
has
kept
its
stock
of
uranium
as
well
as
the
level
to
which
it
refines
uranium
within
the
limits
set
by
the
landmark
deal
according
to
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
report
to
iaea
member
states
obtained
by
reuters
several
of
the
main
items
curbed
under
the
deal
designed
to
lengthen
the
time
iran
would
need
to
build
a
nuclear
bomb
if
it
ever
chose
to
do
so
were
verified
shortly
before
sanctions
were
reimposed
on
as
a
to
washington
s
withdrawal
from
the
nuclear
accord
announced
in
may
a
senior
diplomat
however
later
said
that
there
was
no
sign
iranian
behaviour
had
changed
since
that
date
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
that
iranian
cooperation
or
the
iranian
attitude
has
changed
since
the
of
iran
s
reserve
of
uranium
remained
well
below
the
deal
s
kg
limit
at
kg
the
quarterly
report
by
the
iaea
showed
its
stock
of
heavy
water
a
less
sensitive
material
that
can
be
used
as
a
moderator
in
nuclear
reactors
but
is
still
restricted
under
the
deal
was
roughly
unchanged
at
tonnes
iran
continued
production
but
tonnes
were
shipped
abroad
while
tonnes
were
used
to
make
medical
compounds
the
report
said
the
restoration
of
sanctions
is
part
of
a
wider
effort
by
president
donald
trump
to
force
iran
into
stricter
limits
on
its
nuclear
programme
and
a
halt
to
its
development
of
ballistic
missiles
as
well
as
to
its
support
for
proxy
forces
in
conflicts
around
the
middle
east
iran
has
said
it
will
stick
with
the
deal
which
lifted
most
international
sanctions
but
only
if
the
other
signatories
three
european
powers
russia
and
china
make
good
on
pledges
to
preserve
its
trade
benefits
britain
germany
and
france
have
been
scrambling
to
shield
companies
from
the
effects
of
new
sanctions
and
protect
iranian
oil
revenues
though
many
diplomats
doubt
those
efforts
will
be
enough
to
ultimately
save
the
deal
