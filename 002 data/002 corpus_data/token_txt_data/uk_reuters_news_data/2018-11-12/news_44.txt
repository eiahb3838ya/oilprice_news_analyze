the
dollar
surged
to
nearly
highs
on
monday
against
a
basket
of
major
currencies
as
investors
sought
out
the
liquid
and
currency
against
a
backdrop
of
global
growth
worry
and
rising
political
risk
in
italy
and
britain
a
oil
price
jump
initially
supported
european
equities
but
the
gains
fizzled
rapidly
as
fears
grew
for
italian
lender
carige
whose
shares
were
suspended
after
reports
of
a
capital
hole
while
shanghai
was
lifted
one
percent
by
regulators
promise
to
simplify

buybacks
msci
s
world
equity
index
was
down
percent
and
asian
markets
broadly
weakened
following
friday
s
weak
wall
street
close
investors
fretted
about
signs
of
slowing
growth
in
china
where
giant
alibaba
was
the
latest
to
raise
alarm
bells
with
the
slowest
ever
annual
sales
growth
during
its
singles
day
shopping
event
many
also
reckon
that
president
donald
trump
could
turn
up
the
heat
over
trade
further
damaging
china
s
economy
all
that
coupled
with
european
political
risks
conspired
to
push
the
dollar
percent
higher
against
a
basket
of
currencies
sterling
fell
percent
while
the
euro
which
comprises
more
than
percent
of
the
dollar
index
fell
percent
to
its
lowest
since
july
king
dollar
has
staged
a
return
valentin
marinov
head
of
fx
strategy
at
credit
agricole
said
adding
that
investors
had
piled
back
into
the
dollar
after
last
week
s
federal
reserve
meeting
confirmed
a
path
euro
and
pound
are
both
hurt
by
political
risk
and
that
is
aggravating
underperformance
versus
the
dollar
marinov
said
in
britain
prime
minister
theresa
may
was
forced
to
abandon
plans
for
an
emergency
cabinet
meeting
to
approve
a
brexit
agreement
the
independent
news
website
reported
stoking
fears
that
the
government
might
not
be
able
to
secure
a
deal
that
satisfied
both
the
european
union
and
members
of
the
ruling
party
the
opposition
labour
party
said
that
if
may
s
brexit
deal
was
voted
down
in
parliament
it
would
push
for
a
national
election
and
possibly
also
another
referendum
latest

net
short
sterling
positions
registered
their
biggest
weekly
rise
in
months
deutsche
bank
analysts
however
predicted
more
pain
telling
clients
not
enough
risk
is
priced
into
sterling
given
the
parliamentary
problems
ahead
for
the
euro
italy
was
the
main
focus
with
rome
facing
a
tuesday
deadline
to
submit
a
revised
budget
to
the
eu
though
it
has
so
far
refused
to
cut
the
draft
budget
deficit
setting
the
stage
for
a
collision
with
brussels
markets
were
also
spooked
by
reports
that
banca
carige
would
need
around
million
euros
million
to
plug
a
hole
in
its
capital
base
and
italy
s
deposit
protection
fund
could
fill
only
part
of
it
that
raises
the
spectre
of
a
banking
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
s
economy
keeping
italy
s
bond
yield
spread
over
germany
the
risk
premium
attached
to
italian
assets
around
the
psychologically
key
mark
italian
bank
shares
fell
percent
bernd
berg
global
macro
strategist
at
woodman
asset
management
predicted
the
euro
would
tumble
below
from
the
current
as
renewed
eurozone
and
brexit
angst
and
a
diverging
economic
outlook
with
a
strong
economy
versus
a
weakening
eurozone
economy
will
trigger
further
euro
selling
all
of
this
has
been
good
news
for
dollar
bulls
who
have
benefited
from
flows
against
the
japanese
yen
the
dollar
gained
percent
touching
its
weakest
since
while
it
also
rose
percent
to
the
swiss
franc
speculators
net
long
dollar
positions
rose
last
week
to
the
highest
since
january
calculations
by
reuters
and
commodity
futures
trading
commission
show
trade
is
likely
to
be
thinned
by
the
veterans
day
holiday
with
treasury
bond
markets
shuttered
futures
for
the
s
were
flat
while
the
dow
jones
was
marginally
lower
and
the
nasdaq
was
indicated
percent
firmer
after
sharp
falls
on
friday
the
other
big
move
was
in
commodities
where
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
took
some
pressure
off
last
week
s
oil
price
drop
saying
on
sunday
that
riyadh
could
reduce
supply
to
world
markets
by
barrels
per
day
in
december
a
global
reduction
of
about
percent
that
jolted
brent
crude
futures
up
more
than
percent
to
a
high
of
per
barrel
however
the
supply
cut
may
prove
to
be
a
temporary
solution
to
falling
prices
as
global
growth
slows
with
two
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
germany
and
japan
expected
to
report
a
contraction
in
output
in
coming
days
surprises
appear
to
be
the
main
culprit
but
concern
that
global
demand
is
slowing
may
also
be
creeping
into
markets
and
weighing
on
risk
appetite
