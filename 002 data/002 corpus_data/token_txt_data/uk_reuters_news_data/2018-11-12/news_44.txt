extending
weakness
in

asset
markets
have
been
under
intense
pressure
recently
as
worries
about
a
peak
in

growth
added
to
anxiety
about
slowing
global
trade
and
investment
a
spike
in
bond
yields
driven
by
the
federal
reserve
s
commitment
to

came
after

earlier
in

held

steady
but
stayed
on
track
to
tighten
policy
next

the
fed
s
stance
disappointed
some
investors
who
had
hoped
that
the
rout
in

in

might
have
prompted
policy
makers
to
take
a
more
cautious

a
morning
note
taking
some
pressure
off
a
sharp
drop
in

prices
last
week
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
said
on
sunday
that
the
country
plans
to
reduce
its
oil
supply
to
world
markets
by
barrels
per
day
in
december
representing
a
global
reduction
of
about
percent
that
helped
to
lift
oil
prices
with
crude
rising
percent
to
a
barrel
and
brent
crude
gaining
percent
to
per
barrel
however
the
saudi
supply
cut
may
prove
to
be
a
temporary
solution
to
falling
prices
as
global
growth
slows
with
two
of
the
world
s
biggest
economies
germany
and
japan
expected
to
report
a
contraction
in
output
in
the
coming
days
surprises
appear
to
be
the
main
culprit
but
concern
that
global
demand
is
slowing
may
also
be
creeping
into
