analysis-in race to fill lng supply gap, project goalposts have changed
london
reuters
the
race
is
on
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
producers
to
build
export
terminals
as
demand
soars
but
the
criteria
for
financing
such
have
shifted
as
traditional
relationships
with
lng
consumers
have
begun
to
disintegrate
royal
dutch
shell
s
final
investment
decision
fid
taken
last
month
for
a
billion
lng
canada
project
was
a
shot
in
the
arm
for
the
lng
industry
which
is
emerging
from
almost
three
years
of
low
prices
and
investment
as
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
lng
market
shell
s
decision
is
expected
to
get
the
ball
rolling
on
a
wave
of
approvals
for
dozens
of
similar
projects
around
the
world
that
have
been
planned
for
years
but
not
yet
finalized
but
the
fid
represented
a
different
financing
structure
unreliant
on
commitments
from
large
buyers
as
previous
had
been
such
as
the
recently
commissioned
ichthys
facility
in
australia
or
the
sabine
pass
plant
instead
shell
will
absorb
the
cost
into
its
budget
and
will
effectively
worry
about
the
ultimate
buyers
later
as
one
of
the
largest
corporate
purchasers
of
lng
in
the
world
it
can
absorb
the
new
volumes
into
its
global
portfolio
demand
for
lng
is
there
it
is
expected
almost
to
double
to
million
tonnes
a
year
mtpa
by
leaving
room
for
plenty
more
export
terminals
despite
an
influx
of
fresh
supply
from
new
mostly
terminals
but
projects
have
struggled
to
find
offtakers
as
the
world
s
biggest
buyers
in
japan
and
south
korea
seek
nimbler
terms
while
others
such
as
india
and
pakistan
are
less
creditworthy
projects
that
require
buying
commitments
are
really
struggling
to
find
buyers
to
sign
up
i
don
t
see
a
lot
that
is
happening
said
vivek
chandra
chief
executive
of
texas
lng
which
plans
a
project
of
the
same
name
i
don
t
know
what
the
buyers
are
waiting
for
because
the
golden
opportunity
to
sign
up
for
deals
was
yesterday
he
told
a
conference
this
month
referring
to
historically
low
lng
prices
in
recent
years
before
they
began
rising
last
winter
aside
from
mtpa
of
supply
due
from
projects
under
construction
new
terminals
like
texas
lng
need
fids
other
plans
dot
the
world
from
qatar
s
expansion
to
plants
in
russia
and
mozambique
as
well
as
southeast
asia
of
all
these
projects
only
a
handful
in
the
united
states
will
ultimately
be
built
and
for
others
the
ability
for
the
operator
to
absorb
lng
into
its
portfolio
will
be
key
the
projects
that
we
might
see
now
are
the
ones
that
don
t
rely
on
offtake
agreements
said
frank
konertz
lng
analyst
at
s
p
global
irrespective
of
price
offtake
commitments
are
risky
today
because
the
global
lng
market
is
undergoing
fundamental
changes
as
it
grows
and
increases
liquidity
it
needs
to
solve
quandaries
such
as
the
pricing
mechanism
for
lng
traditionally
linked
to
oil
and
absorb
new
technology
that
shifts
the
commercial
calculations
of
trading
the
gas
the
whole
market
is
in
an
phase
lng
analyst
emma
richards
at
fitch
solutions
said
lng
is
becoming
more
akin
to
oil
with
greater
spot
and
liquidity
trading
referencing
benchmarks
but
it
s
a
long
process
and
it
s
creating
partly
as
a
result
of
these
uncertainties
and
because
the
market
is
gaining
liquidity
the
average
duration
of
offtake
deals
has
halved
to
less
than
eight
years
from
almost
years
in
with
volumes
per
contract
falling
to
mtpa
from
mtpa
according
to
data
from
shell
s
lng
outlook
crucially
about
percent
of
such
contracts
have
no
credit
rating
at
all
compared
to
percent
in
being
or
shell
s
outlook
showed
shorter
smaller
less
creditworthy
contracts
make
financing
projects
simply
more
difficult
this
makes
projects
by
large
portfolio
players
such
as
shell
total
and
exxon
which
has
promised
fids
in
mozambique
and
texas
next
year
easier
to
finalize
for
projects
the
field
is
getting
tighter
qatar
petroleum
the
world
s
largest
exporter
of
lng
said
an
fid
for
the
golden
pass
project
with
exxon
was
due
in
the
next
few
months
qatar
s
own
huge
expansion
expected
to
get
fid
next
year
would
increase
capacity
to
mtpa
from
current
production
rates
of
mtpa
and
some
projects
have
become
attractive
in
light
of
china
s
tariffs
on
lng
imposed
in
the
midst
of
a
trade
war
canadian
projects
in
particular
there
are
five
planned
will
come
at
a
cost
to
the
gulf
coast
plans
for
a
lot
of
projects
looking
to
sanction
now
it
s
a
race
against
time
