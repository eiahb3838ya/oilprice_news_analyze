china
has
overtaken
japan
to
become
the
world
s
top
importer
of
natural
gas
as
beijing
s
crackdown
on
pollution
boosts
its
demand
for
the
more
environmentally
friendly
fuel
while
the
restart
of
nuclear
reactors
in
japan
reduces
its
lng
imports
china
s
total
natural
gas
imports
over
january
to
october
this
year
via
pipeline
and
as
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
were
at
million
tonnes
up
a
third
from
the
same
period
last
year
according
to
reuters
calculations
based
on
general
administration
of
customs
data
japan
on
the
other
hand
imported
about
tonnes
of
lng
over
that
period
according
to
data
from
refinitiv
eikon
down
percent
for
the

months
of
japan
imports
all
of
its
gas
as
lng
china
s
push
to
switch
away
from
coal
to
natural
gas
is
key
to
its
rapid
gas
demand
growth
said

analyst

fge
meanwhile
nuclear
reactors
continue
to
restart
in
japan
which
reduces
demand
for
power
generation
and
consequently
lng
demand
siau
said
china
already
the
biggest
importer
of
oil
and
coal
is
the
world
s
user
of
natural
gas
behind
the
united
states
and
russia
but
it
has
to
import
around
percent
of
its
total
needs
as
domestic
production
can
t
keep
up
with
demand
china
still
lags
behind
japan
on
lng
imports
but
could
overtake
its
north
asia
neighbour
in
the
early
fge
s
siau
said
china
s
surging
demand
pushed
it
past
south
korea
as
the
world
s
lng
importer
in
china
last
year
started
to
move
millions
of
households
and
many
industrial
facilities
from
coal
to
gas
as
part
of
efforts
to
clean
its
skies
sparking
an
unprecedented
rally
in
overseas
import
orders
its
three
biggest
lng
suppliers
are
australia
qatar
and
malaysia
pipeline
imports
come
from
central
asia
and
myanmar
and
a
pipeline
connecting
china
to
russia
is
under
construction
china
has
become
a
hotbed
of
contracting
activity
with
many
suppliers
courting
the
large
chinese
national
oil
companies
as
well
as
the
emerging
buyers
for
contracts
siau
said
china
s
natural
gas
demand
is
expected
to
grow
about
percent
next
year
