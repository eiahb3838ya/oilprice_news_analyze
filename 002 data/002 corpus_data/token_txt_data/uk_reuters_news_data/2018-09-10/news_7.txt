and
wildlife
counts
and
deadlocked
on
a

death
a
california
jury
on
friday
found
the
plains
all
american
pipeline
company
guilty
on
criminal
charges
of
fouling
state
waters
and
harming
wildlife
in
a
major
oil
spill
three
years
ago
along
the
pacific
shoreline
near
santa
barbara
the
verdict
closed
a
chapter
in
the
state
s
bid
to
hold
plains
all
american
criminally
responsible
for
an
oil
spill
that
ranked
as
the
largest
in
more
than
four
decades
to
hit
the
but
ecologically
sensitive
coast
northwest
of
los
angeles
the
spill
linked
to
the
deaths
of
hundreds
of
sea
birds
and
marine
mammals
occurred
when
an
underground
pipeline
badly
worn
by
corrosion
ruptured
along
a
coastal
highway
west
of
santa
barbara
on
may
sending
crude
oil
gushing
onto
the
shore
of
refugio
state
beach
and
into
the
pacific
by
the
company
s
own
estimates
as
much
as
barrels
of
crude
oil
escaped
into
the
environment
at
the
edge
of
a
national
marine
sanctuary
and
underwater
preserve
teeming
with
whales
dolphins
sea
lions
and
marine
birds
that
stands
as
the
biggest
spill
since
s
blowout
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
an
area
that
also
hosts
nearly
two
dozen
offshore
oil
platforms
the
company
faces
at
least
million
in
penalties
if
friday
s
conviction
is
sustained
according
to
john
savrnoch
the
chief
deputy
district
attorney
for
santa
barbara
county
but
that
sum
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
million
that
plains
said
it
had
spent
on
spill
response
and
cleanup
costs
by
the
time
the
criminal
case
was
brought
in
plains
was
convicted
of
discharging
crude
oil
into
state
waters
a
felony
and
for
eight
misdemeanor
offenses
including
the
failure
to
immediately
report
the
spill
savrnoch
told
reuters
the
remaining
misdemeanors
convictions
were
mostly
for
state
wildlife
code
violations
stemming
from
deaths
of
sea
lions
and
brown
pelicans
in
the
spill
the
jury
was
deadlocked
on
two
additional
felonies
and
one
wildlife
misdemeanor
and
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
on
a
misdemeanor
count
related
to
a
dolphin
death
one
of
plains
employees
an
environmental
and
regulatory
compliance
specialist
was
originally
charged
in
the
case
as
well
but
those
charges
and
dozens
of
others
against
the
company
were
dismissed
before
the
trial
in
a
statement
issued
after
the
verdict
plains
said
the
outcome
exonerated
the
company
of
any
knowing
misconduct
in
operating
the
failed
pipeline
the
company
has
maintained
that
its
pipeline
operations
exceeded
legal
and
industry
standards
the
transportation
department
report
concluded
a
year
after
the
spill
that
numerous
lapses
in
safety
measures
judgment
and
planning
by
plains
led
to
and
worsened
the
disaster
it
specifically
found
the
company
at
fault
for
failing
to
protect
the
pipeline
from
corrosion
beforehand
and
to
promptly
detect
and
respond
to
the
spill
once
it
occurred
oil
industry
critics
seized
on
the
spill
as
an
example
of
how
the
aging
infrastructure
of
america
s
fossil
fuels
production
and
transport
networks
pose
a
grave
threat
to
the
environment
