to
show
a
new
generation
nuclear
reactors
work
well
which
is
not
for
now
the
case
new
environment
minister
francois
de
rugy
said
in
remarks
published
on
monday
de
rugy
signalled
that
any
decision
on
whether
to
build
more
plants
using
the
european
pressurised
reactor
epr
design
would
be
based
on
economic
factors
the
french
government
is
expected
to
outline
in
late
october
a
plan
to
cut
the
share
of
nuclear
energy
in
its
electricity
production
to
percent
from
the
current
percent
the
highest
level
in
the
world
it
has
already
said
it
could
take
a
decade
more
to
get
there
than
an
initial
target
of
whether
that
includes
the
construction
of
new
nuclear
reactors
has
emerged
as
a
politically
sensitive
issue
for
president
emmanuel
macron
last
month
the
previous
environment
minister
nicolas
hulot
who
was
widely
viewed
as
an
impediment
to
the
nuclear
industry
s
drive
to
remain
as
france
s
main
power
supplier
resigned
abruptly
de
rugy
a
former
green
lawmaker
told
le
monde
in
the
interview
his
gut
feeling
was
that
nuclear
power
was
not
an
energy
source
for
the
future
but
added
that
there
should
be
no
war
of
religions
on
the
issue
the
important
thing
is
to
know
the
economic
data
for
both
nuclear
and
renewable
energies
he
said
construction
of
the
first
plant
in
france
to
use
an
epr
reactor
has
run
billions
of
euros
over
budget
and
is
years
behind
schedule
asked
whether
edf
should
build
another
such
plant
after
it
completes
the
station
in
normandy
de
rugy
said
edf
should
demonstrate
that
the
epr
works
which
is
not
the
case
yet
nobody
is
able
to
guarantee
a
date
for
its
connection
to
the
grid
it
also
needs
to
demonstrate
the
epr
is
competitive
in
terms
of
de
rugy
also
questioned
edf
s
corporate
structure
i
have
a
few
ideas
on
the
issue
he
said
i
don
t
like
change
for
the
sake
of
it
but
i
think
the
status
quo
is
neither
in
the
state

not
