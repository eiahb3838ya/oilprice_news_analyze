once darling of foreign investors, turkey's power market struggles
istanbul
reuters
when
austrian
energy
company
omv
started
operating
its
power
plant
in
turkey
in
the
country
s
electricity
sector
was
the
darling
of
foreign
investors
lured
by
promises
of
market
liberalization
and
the
highest
growth
forecasts
outside
china
five
years
later
omv
has
sold
off
its
turkish
plant
for
barely
half
of
the
million
euros
it
initially
invested
and
turkey
s
power
companies
are
in
debt
restructuring
talks
with
banks
amid
a
tumbling
lira
and
rising
energy
costs
with
the
promised
liberalization
only
partly
delivered
and
plants
at
times
undercutting
market
prices
private
sector
firms
found
their
margins
squeezed
even
before
the
lira
crisis
drove
up
repayment
costs
on
foreign
currency
loans
turkey
no
longer
fits
our
product
portfolio
said
an
omv
spokesperson
in
vienna
omv
also
sold
off
its
wholly
owned
fuel
retailer
petrol
ofisi
in
two
years
after
its
former
ceo
described
the
turkey
investments
as
a
disappointment
with
their
margins
squeezed
many
power
companies
are
fighting
to
keep
cash
flows
stable
and
struggling
to
find
buyers
as
the
outlook
darkens
for
the
turkish
economy
and
for
a
still
heavily
electricity
market
we
will
be
seeing
cash
tightness
more
frequently
i
don
t
want
to
think
of
a
scenario
where
the
private
sector
or
the
state
is
not
able
to
deliver
on
its
pledges
said
an
industry
source
who
works
in
a
power
generation
company
according
to
a
report
by
boston
consulting
group
and
turkish
business
group
tusiad
a
total
of
billion
of
investments
have
been
poured
into
the
turkish
electricity
market
over
the
past
years
largely
funded
by
cheap
credit
of
this
around
billion
is
yet
to
be
repaid
several
turkish
companies
including
power
firms
are
seeking
to
restructure
their
debt
after
the
lira
lost
percent
this
year
due
to
concerns
over
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
opposition
to
higher
interest
rates
and
a
bitter
diplomatic
dispute
with
the
united
states
conglomerate
gama
holding
is
among
the
latest
in
talks
to
sell
some
of
its
assets
including
a
stake
in
its
gama
energy
which
produces
electricity
from
hydro
wind
and
natural
gas
with
around
mw
installed
power
across
turkey
such
financing
issues
risk
clouding
the
outlook
even
for
the
renewables
sector
a
relative
bright
spot
in
turkey
s
power
market
fitch
ratings
last
month
downgraded
its
forecasts
for
turkish
solar
and
wind
capacity
as
it
expected
fewer
projects
to
gain
financing
in
the
short
run
it
should
not
be
a
surprise
for
power
companies
to
file
for
bankruptcy
one
after
the
other
said
a
senior
manager
at
a
turkish
energy
firm
many
companies
are
really
in
a
dire
situation
and
they
are
in
a
panic
to
restructure
he
said
turkish
energy
officials
declined
to
comment
for
this
story
turkey
has
reduced
the
state
s
role
in
power
production
through
privatizations
and
also
brought
power
trading
onto
an
exchange
to
boost
transparency
but
the
government
still
holds
percent
of
total
installed
power
supply
and
often
offers
prices
below
market
levels
effectively
setting
a
ceiling
that
can
defy
market
fundamentals
the
natural
gas
market
has
remained
largely
under
state
control
hampering
further
development
of
the
power
market
more
than
percent
of
the
mw
electricity
generation
uses
natural
gas
as
a
result
power
plants
fed
by
natural
gas
which
have
more
flexible
production
levels
than
renewables
and
plants
are
the
hardest
hit
turkey
s
state
pipeline
operator
botas
has
more
than
doubled
prices
for
gas
supplied
to
power
plants
to
lira
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
this
month
from
lira
last
year
but
electricity
sale
prices
for
those
power
plants
have
risen
much
less
the
market
clearing
price
at
turkey
s
energy
bourse
epias
rose
percent
over
the
same
period
while
household
power
prices
only
rose
percent
our
margins
have
evaporated
there
is
no
predictability
or
visibility
in
the
market
which
makes
it
even
more
difficult
for
restructuring
and
that
jeopardizes
the
financial
stability
of
these
companies
said
selim
guven
commercial
director
of
acwa
power
in
turkey
when
you
are
indirectly
subsidizing
the
manufacturing
sector
and
consumers
with
cheap
electricity
you
are
damaging
the
financial
sustainability
predictability
and
the
foreign
investor
appetite
in
the
power
when
omv
and
other
foreign
investors
flocked
to
turkey
its
power
market
looked
to
be
the
only
one
in
europe
promising
returns
with
energy
demand
forecasts
second
only
to
china
turkey
s
overall
energy
demand
still
grew
at
percent
a
year
in
the
decade
to
more
than
twice
the
global
average
bp
s
statistical
review
of
world
energy
said
but
turkey
s
recent
economic
woes
have
prompted
economists
to
downgrade
growth
forecasts
and
some
now
see
prolonged
economic
contraction
into
some
government
measures
including
incentives
for
power
plants
to
use
domestic
coal
to
help
reduce
a
billion
energy
import
bill
have
damaged
price
predictability
you
need
predictability
consistent
state
policies
financial
stability
and
access
to
longer
term
funding
guven
said
at
the
moment
we
are
struggling

all
