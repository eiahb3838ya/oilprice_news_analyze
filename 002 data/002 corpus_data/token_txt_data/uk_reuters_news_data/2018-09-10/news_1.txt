french
nuclear
group

on

inaugurated
a
billion
euro
billion
pounds
uranium
conversion
plant
despite
huge
global
overcapacity
for
nuclear
reactor
fuel
orano
s
new
plant
in
tricastin
southern
france
will
account
for
a
quarter
of
the
world
s
annual
uranium
hexafluoride
production
capacity
when
it
fully
ramps
up
in
and
is
set
to
have
the
industry
s
lowest
costs
the
company
said
produced
by
combining
yellowcake
uranium
ore
concentrate
with
fluorine
is
a
precursor
of
enriched
uranium
which
fuels
the
world
s
nuclear
plants
following
the
fukushima
disaster
in
japan
uranium
prices
are
near
decade
lows
as
several
countries
reduced
their
reliance
on
nuclear
energy
in
november
honeywell
international
inc
suspended
production
at
its
capacity
metropolis
illinois
plant
the
only
such
conversion
plant
in
the
united
states
orano
formerly
called
areva
in
december
also
halted
production
at
its
aging
capacity
comurhex
conversion
plant
in
tricastin
and
will
serve
utilities
from
its
stockpiles
until
the
new
plant
comes
online
and
global
overcapacity
subsides
from
orano
s
new
conversion
facility
to
be
called
the
philippe
coste
plant
will
have
capacity
of
tonnes
and
output
of
about
tonnes
when
construction
is
completed
early
it
will
reach
full
capacity
of
tonnes
orano
chief
executive
philippe
knoche
told
reporters
that
the
new
plant
s
order
book
was
full
for
the
next
years
but
added
that
profitability
would
remain
challenging
at
current
conversion
rates
following
the
plant
closures
those
rates
have
doubled
to
about
per
kilogram
over
the
past
year
but
are
still
too
low
for
the
industry
s
profitability
knoche
said
french
utility
edf
had
committed
to
buy
about
one
third
of
the
new
plant
s
output
while
the
rest
would
be
sold
mainly
under
contracts
to
about
utilities
in
the
united
states
china
japan
south
korea
and
several
european
countries
ten
to
percent
of
the
plant
s
output
will
be
sold
under
contracts
of
less
than
three
years
the
uranium
will
come
from
areva
and
other
companies
mines
in
niger
kazakhstan
canada
south
africa
and
namibia
orano
board
chairman
philippe
varin
said
the
firm
s
new
conversion
plant
had
been
under
development
for
years
and
that
orano
upgraded
it
as
part
of
the
modernization
of
its
fuel
facilities
this
new
facility
is
a
commitment
he
said
orano
and
canada
s
cameco
corp
each
have
about
a
quarter
of
global
uranium
conversion
capacity
with
russia
s
rosatom
a
bit
more
and
china
s
cnnc
a
bit
less
than
a
quarter
each
