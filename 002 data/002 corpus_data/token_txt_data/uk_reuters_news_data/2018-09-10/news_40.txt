on

the
rig
count
has
stagnated
since
may
after
staging
a
recovery
since
which
followed
a
steep
slump
the
previous
year
amid
plummeting
crude
prices
outside
the
united

new
sanctions
against
iran
s
crude

from

were

several
major
iran
customers
like
india

and

were
already
cutting

crude
governments
can
talk
tough
they
can
say
they
are
going
to
stand
up
to
trump
push
for
waivers
but
generally
the
companies
we
speak
to
say
they
won
t
risk
it
fge
said
financial
penalties
and
the
loss
of
shipping
insurance
scares
everyone
it
said
in
a
note
to
clients
with
rig
activity
stalling
and
iran
sanctions
looming
the
oil
market
outlook
is
tightening
investors
have
largely
turned
positive
again
likely
welcoming
the
return
of
backwardation

backwardation
describes
a
market
in
which
prices
for
immediate
delivery
are
higher
than
those
for
later
dispatch
it
is
considered
a
sign
of
tight
conditions
giving
traders
an
incentive
to
sell
oil
immediately
instead
of
storing
it
the
brent
backwardation
between
october
this
year
and
is
currently
around
per
barrel
one
key
question
going
forward
is
how
demand
develops
amid
the
trade
disputes
between
the
united
states
and
china
as
well
as
general
emerging
market
weakness
nbd
s
bell
said
we
don
t
expect
that
currency
weakness
in
several
emerging
markets
will
pose
a
risk
to
oil
market
fundamentals
as
the
weakness
in
both
india
and
china
the
two
markets
most
vital
from
an
oil
market
perspective
has
been
relatively
consultancy
fge
however
warned
that
trade
wars
and
especially
rising
interest
rates
can
spell
trouble
for
the
emerging
markets
that
drive
oil
demand
growth
despite
this
fge
said
the
likelihood
of
significantly
weaker
oil
prices
was
relatively
low
as
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
would
withhold
output
to
prevent
prices
from
plunging
we
feel
confident
opec
can
and
will
deal
with
slowing
demand
we
see
per
barrel
as
a
trigger
for
cuts
