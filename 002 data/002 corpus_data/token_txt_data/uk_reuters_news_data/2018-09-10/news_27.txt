rpc
group
is
in
talks
on
a
possible
sale
to
apollo
global
management
and
bain
capital
with
the
private
equity
interest
in
the
fast
consolidating
market
lifting
shares
in
europe

biggest
plastics
packaging
maker
by
percent
private
equity
has
long
been
drawn
by
reliable
cashflow
and
growing
demand
from
online
shopping
with
a
spate
of
takeovers
by
bigger
packaging
players
further
spurring
their
interest
apollo
and
bain
have
until
to
make
a
firm
offer
britain
s
rpc
said
after
a
bloomberg
report
that
it
was
exploring
options
including
a
sale
the
european
plastic
packaging
market
is
considerably
less
consolidated
and
so
therefore
there
are
opportunities
to
use
people
like
rpc
as
a
platform
in
order
to
consolidate

gordon
analyst
adrian
kearsey
said
kearsey
added
that
the
more
than
percent
drop
in
rpc
s
share
price
in
the
past
year
provided
a
value
opportunity
for
the
private
equity
players
and
analysts
at
peel
hunt
who
have
a
buy
rating
on
rpc
expect
other
private
equity
bids
although
the
interest
comes
amid
increased
scrutiny
of
plastic
waste
brokerage
jefferies
said
last
month
that
possible
british
regulations
play
to
rpc
strengths
including
its
limited
exposure
to
single
use
items
like
straws
and
cutlery
rpc
which
operates
in
countries
had
a
market
capitalisation
of
billion
pounds
as

although
this
rose

analyst
paul
moran
who
has
a
sell
rating
on
the
stock
remained
sceptical
of
rpc
being
acquired
by
private
equity
firms
given
the
importance
to
buyout
firms
of
cash
generation
and
stable
profit
growth
our
central
view
remains
a
detailed
look
at
the
cash
generation
at
rpc
will
not
lead
to
an
acquisition
rpc
which
has
more
than
billion
pounds

seen
its

flow
dip
percent
to
million

in

to
march
in

has
been
under
investor
pressure
to
raise
cash
and
cut
capital
spending
said
it
would
prioritise
the
proposed
disposal
of
some
assets
as
it
looked
to
generate
capital
for
expansion
or
to
return
money
to
shareholders

said
it
would
raise
