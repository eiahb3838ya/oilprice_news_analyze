earlier
reported
that

the

said

had
pressed

to
take
over
construction
company
polimex
from
other

including
gas
firm
pgnig
and
utilities
pge
enea
and
energa
which
helped
rescue
polimex
from

last

i
was

many
times
to

money
investments

are
completely

operations
as
the

i
am
to

its

rzeczpospolita
quoted

saying
dziennik

said
the

had
also
wanted
jsw
to
help
finance
the
construction
of
a
power
plant
in
ostroleka
northeast
poland
built
by
energa
and
enea
at
the

it
is
difficult
for
me
to
talk
about
the
potential
change
of
the
ceo
there
is
an
audit
at
jsw
at
this
stage
i
do
not
understand
the
ceo
s
behaviour
tchorzewski
told
reuters
in
a
telephone
interview
referring
to
ozon
s
comments
to
rzeczpospolita
he
declined
to
say
whether
ozon
would

he
was
not
engaged
in
any
talks
regarding
jsw
s
potential
investment
in
polimex
a
jsw
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
trade
unions
at
jsw
sent
an
open
letter
to
tchorzewski
and
prime
minister
mateusz
morawiecki
defending
the
ceo
and
protesting
against
his
potential
dismissal
jsw
can
not
be
a
life
ring
for
other
companies
that
are
not
doing
well
they
said
in
the
letter
last
week
reuters
reported
jsw
was
considering
a
purchase
of
australia
s
prairie
mining
poland
