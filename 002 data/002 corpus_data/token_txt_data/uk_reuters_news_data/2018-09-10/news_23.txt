on

after
rising
anxiety
about
the
trade
war
and
further
fed

gave
asia

it

dragged
asia
to
a
new
low
traders
were
bracing
for
a
potential
escalation
in
the
row
after
president
donald
trump
raised
the
stakes
on
friday
he
said
he
was
ready
to
impose
tariffs
on
virtually
all
chinese
imports
into
the
united

threatening

rates
it
s
more
of

continue
to

pressure
from
a
whole
host
of
headwinds
said

manager
gam

investment
director
of
emerging

equities
tim
love
he
pointed
to
the
latest
fall
in
china
s
currency
the
yuan
which
is
now
down
almost
percent
versus
the
dollar
since
april
you
are
back
to
the
highly
politically
charged
question
is
this
currency
manipulation
or
not
europe
s
resistance
to
the
gloom
was
led
by
the
jump
in
milan
after
economy
minister
giovanni
tria
said
over
the
weekend
that
the
country
s
upcoming
budget
would
help
push
down
the
government
s
bond
market
borrowing
costs
stockholm
and
the
swedish
crown
strengthened
after
the
nationalist
sweden
democrats
gained
less
ground
than
polls
had
predicted
in
elections
on
sunday
the
crown
rose
about
percent
to
against
the
euro
while
the
neighbouring
norwegian
crown
surged
after
higher
august
inflation
data
cemented
expectations
that
interest
rates
will
go
up
there
next
week
the
euro
made
percent
against
the
dollar
at
after
falling
more
than
half
a
percent
on
friday
following
the
jobs
data
figures
on
friday
showed
traders
overall
dollar
positions
making
their
biggest
drop
in
nearly
six
months
the
pullback
comes
after
speculators
had
boosted
net
long
bets
on
the
greenback
to
the
highest
for
more
than
years
in
late
august
there
is
an
awareness
that
it
is
a
very
crowded
trade
said
karl
schamotta
director
of
global
markets
strategy
at
cambridge
global
payments
there
are
some
major
uncertainties
about
just
how
far
growth
outperformance
and
monetary
divergence
will
go
he
said
the
most
eyecatching
action
was
in
asia
again
msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
fell
percent
to
the
lowest
since
july
extending
losses
from
last
week
when
it
dropped
percent
for
its
worst
weekly
showing
since
beijing
had
warned
of
retaliation
if
washington
launched
any
new
trade
measures
but
it
is
running
out
of
room
to
match
them
raising
concern
it
will
resort
to
other
measures
such
as
weakening
the
yuan
or
taking
action
against
companies
in
china
chinese
shares
were
battered
with
the
index
off
percent
shanghai
s
sse
composite
fell
percent
and
hong
kong
s
hang
seng
index
shed
percent
japan
s
nikkei
ended
percent
higher
after
revised
data
showed
the
world
s
economy
grew
at
its
fastest
pace
since
trump
who
is
challenging
china
mexico
canada
and
the
european
union
on
trade
issues
has
also
expressed
displeasure
about
the
large
trade
deficit
with
japan
the
latest
low
for
shares
came
amid
turbulence
in
argentina
turkey
brazil
russia
and
south
africa
where
currencies
have
been
routed
recently
some
asian
economies
are
vulnerable
too
nomura
analysts
said
with
many
countries
burdened
by
high
private
debt
they
also
noted
a
concentration
risk
from
some
of
the
world
s
largest
funds
heavy
investments
in
assets
the
indian
rupee
hit
a
record
low
of
per
dollar
and
indonesia
s
rupiah
asia
s
performer
this
year
weakened
percent
near
an
low
given
the
latest
comments
from
trump
investors
are
likely
to
see
the
potential
for
further
depreciation
in
em
currencies
with
the
trade
war
cranking
up
yet
another
notch
said
nick
twidale
analyst
at
rakuten
securities
australia
there
were
other
areas
of
fallout
from
the
global
trade
worries
too
the
australian
dollar
a
proxy
for
chinese
growth
because
of
the
large
volume
of
metals
australia
sells
to
china
hovered
near
its
lowest
in
years
and
was
last
at
copper
which
china
hoovers
up
ferociously
tumbled
percent
after
seeing
a
percent
drop
already
this
year
gold
was
lower
at
but
oil
prices
bucked
the
trend
climbing
after
three
straight
days
of
losses
as
data
showed
drilling
stalling
and
with
sanctions
against
iran
s
crude
exports
looming
in
november
crude
futures
were
up
cents
at
per
barrel
and
brent
crude
futures
added
cents
to
a
barrel
