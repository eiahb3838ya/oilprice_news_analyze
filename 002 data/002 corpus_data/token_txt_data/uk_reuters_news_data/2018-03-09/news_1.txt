wrapup 4-u.s. eases way to more tariff exemptions under pressure from allies
reuters
the
united
states
opened
the
way
for
more
exemptions
from
its
steel
and
aluminium
tariffs
on
friday
after
pressure
from
allies
and
intense
lobbying
from
lawmakers
further
diluting
the
measures
just
a
day
after
they
were
formally
announced
president
donald
trump
who
has
broad
powers
to
impose
the
tariffs
of
percent
on
steel
imports
and
percent
on
aluminium
at
the
outset
granted
exemptions
to
canada
and
mexico
and
said
there
would
be
the
possibility
of
industry
exemptions
although
he
has
not
been
specific
after
trump
opened
the
door
brazil
japan
south
korea
australia
and
europe
clamoured
for
special
treatment
while
chinese
producers
called
on
beijing
to
retaliate
in
kind
trump
tweeted
on
friday
that
he
spoke
with
australian
prime
minister
malcolm
turnbull
about
trade
and
military
cooperation
working
very
quickly
on
a
security
agreement
so
we
don
t
have
to
impose
steel
or
aluminium
tariffs
on
our
ally
the
great
nation
of
australia
trump
said
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
earlier
said
he
expects
countries
in
addition
to
mexico
and
canada
to
be
exempted
in
the
next
couple
of
weeks
when
proposed
tariffs
were
initially
announced
stock
markets
went
into
a
tail
spin
on
concerns
they
would
ignite
a
global
trade
war
but
since
trump
signalled
that
exemptions
were
possible
reaction
has
been
measured
and
counter
threats
have
been
carefully
calibrated
so
far
those
threats
have
been
overblown
according
to
dani
rodrik
professor
of
international
political
economy
at
harvard
university
s
john
kennedy
school
of
government
and
one
of
the
world
s
leading
experts
on
trade
the
reality
is
that
trump
s
trade
measures
to
date
amount
to
small
potatoes
in
particular
they
pale
in
comparison
to
the
scale
and
scope
of
the
protectionist
policies
of
president
ronald
reagan
s
administration
in
the
rodrik
wrote
on
friday
tokyo
and
brussels
rejected
any
suggestion
that
their
exports
to
the
united
states
threatened
the
country
s
national
security
trump
s
justification
for
imposing
the
tariffs
despite
warnings
at
home
and
abroad
that
they
could
provoke
a
global
trade
war
we
are
an
ally
not
a
threat
european
commission
vice
president
jyrki
katainen
said
china
s
metals
industry
issued
the
country
s
most
explicit
threat
yet
in
the
row
urging
the
government
to
retaliate
by
targeting
coal
a
sector
that
is
central
to
trump
s
political
base
and
his
election
pledge
to
restore
american
industries
and
jobs
brazil
which
after
canada
is
the
biggest
steel
supplier
to
the
market
said
it
wanted
to
join
the
exemption
list
and
argentina
made
a
similar
case
japan
the
united
states
top
economic
and
military
ally
in
asia
was
next
in
line
chief
cabinet
secretary
yoshihide
suga
told
a
news
conference
that
japan
s
steel
and
aluminium
shipments
posed
no
threat
to
national
security
the
european
union
the
world
s
biggest
trade
bloc
chimed
in
europe
is
certainly
not
a
threat
to
american
internal
security
so
we
expect
to
be
excluded

cecilia
malmstrom
said
in
brussels
malmstrom
told
reporters
the
eu
was
ready
to
complain
to
the
world
trade
organization
and
retaliate
within
days
she
will
meet
with

robert
lighthizer
and

hiroshige
seko
in
brussels
on
saturday
when
she
will
ask
whether
the

is
to
be
included
in
the
tariffs
malmstrom
won
support
from
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
shares
in
european
steel
makers
fell
although
germany
s
two
biggest
producers
thyssenkrupp
and
salzgitter
have
insisted
the
impact
on
them
will
be
limited
the
target
of
trump
s
ire
is
china
whose
capacity
expansions
have
helped
add
to
global
surpluses
of
steel
china
is
also
the
potential
target
of
far
more
action
over
what
washington
says
is
its
theft
of
intellectual
property
and
coercion
of
firms
to
share
commercial
secrets
beijing
vowed
to
firmly
defend
its
legitimate
rights
and
tariffs
would
seriously
impact
the
normal
order
of
international
trade
the
commerce
ministry
said
last
year
china
imported
million
tonnes
of
coal
worth
about
million
and
nearly
five
times
the
amount
it
took
in
trump
has
championed
coal
exports
as
demand
from
power
firms
at
home
weakens
the
dispute
has
fuelled
concerns
that
soybeans
the
united
states
most
valuable
export
to
china
might
be
caught
up
in
the
row
after
beijing
launched
an
inquiry
into

of
