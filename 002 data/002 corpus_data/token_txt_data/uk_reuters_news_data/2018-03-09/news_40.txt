china's energy giants return to asian lng market as sellers
march
reuters
falling
industrial
demand
and
mild
weather
have
turned
china
s
energy
giants
into
sellers
of
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
in
asia
for
the
first
time
since
last
year
s
massive
import
spree
chinese
players
were
on
the
receiving
end
of
last
year
s
doubling
of
lng
prices
largely
driven
by
their
rapid
shift
to
gas
to
combat
coal
smog
as
well
as
elevated
regional
demand
for
the
fuel
although
a
cnooc
executive
last
week
warned
producers
not
to
expect
a
similar
payday
in
industry
executives
said
they
were
not
unduly
concerned
by
the
blip
saying
chinese
demand
would
continue
to
grow
however
some
traders
were
caught
off
guard
by
the
speed
of
the
demand
downturn
in
the
to
and
aftermath
of
china
s
lunar
new
year
holidays
last
month
with
three
cargoes
now
on
offer
lng
producer
profits
soared
in
tandem
with
spot
prices
hitting
highs
above
per
mmbtu
as
china
s
buying
spree
peaked
in
december
and
january
but
a
slump
set
in
as
milder
weather
settled
over
japan
and
other
major
gas
consumers
in
the
region
and
expectations
that
chinese
buyers
returning
from
the
lunar
new
year
break
would
take
up
the
slack
fell
through
plunging
demand
turned
national
oil
companies
nocs
like
cnooc
sinopec
and
petrochina
into
sellers
and
they
are
now
offering
cargoes
for
late
march
and
april
delivery
trade
sources
said
meanwhile
spot
lng
prices
have
sunk
to
the
mid
per
mmbtu
range
the
heating
season
is
almost
over
and
some
buyers
are
getting
more
balanced
including
small
buyers
so
yes
chinese
companies
have
cargoes
for
offer
a
source
at
one
said
lng
industry
executives
are
unfazed
despite
china
s
role
in
reviving
global
cargo
trade
and
boosting
prices
we
expect
lng
demand
to
continue
to
grow
in
china
this
year
royal
dutch
shell
s
steve
hill
said
on
friday
citing
the
government
s
commitment
to
cutting
back
on
coal
the
brunt
of
china
s
programme
has
yet
to
play
through
as
the
delayed
effect
of
last
year
s
switching
meant
the
impact
on
demand
was
limited
to
six
weeks
said
hill
who
is
responsible
for
shell
s
global
lng
and
trading
business
however
zheng
hongtao
vice
president
of
trading
at
cnooc
gas
and
power
said
lng
producers
ought
to
rethink
bullish
forecasts
and
take
into
account
factors
such
as
pipeline
outages
which
drove
up
china
s
lng
demand
this
winter
daily
shortfalls
in
piped
gas
deliveries
from
central
asia
meant
cnooc
and
cnpc
had
to
purchase
million
tonnes
of
lng
equivalent
supply
via
lng
spot
markets
hongtao
said
without
these
emergent
million
tonnes
what
would
have
been
the
spot
lng
price
he
said
after
exceeding
quotas
for
converting
households
from
coal
to
gas
chinese
provinces
have
plans
to
moderate
the
pace
of
conversions
which
alongside
ambitious
targets
to
boost
domestic
gas
output
could
take
pressure
off
lng
imports
stabilising
pipeline
imports
would
also
add
relief
the
frenzied
of
gas
demand
last
year
sparked
criticism
of
the
central
government
after
supply
shortages
ensued
prices
rose
and
residents
froze
making
a
repeat
highly
unlikely
lng
industry
sources
acknowledge
hongtao
said
efforts
to
contain
lng
demand
are
underway
from
one
terminal
in
china
we
sold
lng
or
tonnes
of
lng
per
day
this
winter
over
the
chinese
new
year
we
sold
trucks
or
tonnes
per
day
now
it
has
recovered
but
is
still
less
than
half
he
said
last
week
adding
it
showed
the
changeability
of
china
s
gas
market
