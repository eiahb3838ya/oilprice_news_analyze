on
the
impact
palm
oil
plantations
have

tribal
communities
and
endangered
species
such
as
the
orangutan
we
as
consumers
are
so
detached
from
the
source
of
our
commodities
that
we
are
no
longer
able
to
see
the
consequences
of
our
daily
choices
zacharevic

indonesia
the
world

consumer
goods
giant

palm
oil
supply
chain
to
boost
transparency
indonesia
has
been
a
focus
of
global
efforts
to
rein
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
caused
by
the
deforestation
of
swampy
peatlands
to
make
way
for
plantations
for
industries
such
as
palm
oil
pulp
and
paper
these
forests
are
often
in
remote
areas
long
inhabited
by
indigenous
peoples
who
might
not
have
documents
proving
ownership
or
be
able
to
contest
land
acquisitions
in
the
southeast
asian
the
forests
are
also
home
to
dwindling
wildlife
populations
there
are
only
about
orangutans
remaining

the
wild

sumatra
conservationists

we
are
all
contributing
to
the
destructive
effects
of
unsustainable
palm
oil
whether
it
is
by
consuming
products
or
supporting
policies
that
affect
the
trade
zacharevic
