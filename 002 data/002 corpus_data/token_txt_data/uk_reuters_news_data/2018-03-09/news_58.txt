analysis-platinum's fuel-cell car bonanza proves elusive
london
reuters
the
platinum
industry
has
been
waiting
for
cars
to
lift
demand
for
years
now
just
as
the
technology
finally
looks
to
be
gaining
traction
carmakers
are
finding
ways
to
slash
the
amount
of
the
expensive
metal
used
cars
using
fuel
cells
which
generate
electricity
through
a
chemical
reaction
using
hydrogen
as
a
fuel
and
platinum
as
a
catalyst
comprise
just
a
small
fraction
of
an
market
dominated
by
battery
power
both
technologies
have
their
advantages
but
a
big
obstacle
to
a
wider
rollout
of
vehicles
has
been
a
lack
of
hydrogen
refuelling
infrastructure
now
however
plans
are
underway
to
build
networks
in
the
united
states
germany
japan
and
most
significantly
the
world
s
biggest
car
market
china
a
number
of
major
carmakers
are
building
cars
but
they
are
radically
reducing
the
amount
of
platinum
used
meaning
the
technology
may
not
deliver
the
surge
in
demand
for
the
metal
that
has
long
been
flagged
by
some
platinum
producers
and
analysts
the
companies
efforts
are
driven
by
cost
even
at
its
current
historically
low
price
level
platinum
is
still
an
expensive
ingredient
at
spot
prices
the
grams
of
the
metal
it
can
take
to
power
a
car
may
cost
more
than
the
amount
needed
for
a
diesel
autocatalyst
in
comparison
is

the

that
would
result
in
levels
below

he
added
he

said
techniques
such
as
increasing

surface
area
used

could
cut

amount
of

japan
s
honda
and
germany
s
audi
have
said
they
are
also
looking
into
reducing
the
amount
of
platinum
they
use
in
their
vehicles
though
they
did
not
specify
by
how
much
however
eradicating
platinum
entirely
from
fuel
cells
is
not
currently
viable
according
to
researchers
the
large
platinum
reductions
in
fuel
cells
come
at
a
time
of
uncertainty
over
the
wider
demand
outlook
for
the
metal
in
the
auto
industry
which
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
consumption
of
the
metal
globally
platinum
is
primarily
used
in
catalytic
converters
with
the
heaviest
loadings
seen
in
cars
diesel
s
market
share
has
been
shrinking
in
its
main

europe
following
the

awareness

high

a

in
berlin
ruled
last

that
some
german
cities
can

technology
is
still
hugely
overshadowed

by

end
of
last

advocates
of
technology
say
it
is
the
greenest
form
of
transportation
available
emitting
only
clean
water
though
critics
point
out
that
producing
hydrogen
itself
is
energy
intensive
vehicles
are
quicker
to
refuel
than
cars
and
typically
have
a
longer
range

major
boost

rolled
out

the

to

according
to

specialist
johnson
matthey
johann
wiebe
lead
analyst
at
precious
metals
consultancy
gfms
pointed
to
research
from
stanford
university
that
suggests
platinum
could
be
substituted
for
cobalt
in
some
technology
in
development
though
cobalt
too
is
becoming
pricier
due
to
demand
from
battery
makers
hitting
highs
this
year
after
surging
percent
in
despite
the
search
for
substitutes
cutting
platinum
entirely
from
vehicle
fuel
cells
currently
doesn
t
look
commercially
feasible
wiebe
said
in
the
meantime
thriftiness
continues
you
need
to
get
the
costs
down
he
said
the
aim
is
to
get
it
down
to
around
grams
the
eventual
goal
however
is
for
fuel
cells
not
to
contain
more
platinum
than
a
standard
autocatalyst
which
is
approximately
three

would
be
