crude
oil
futures
rose
on
friday
as
asian
stock
markets
gained
on
news
that
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
will
meet
with
president
donald
trump
the
two
will
likely
meet
by
may
and
kim
has
pledged
to
refrain
from
further
nuclear
or
missile
tests
south
korea
s
national
security
chief
said
late
on
thursday
after
briefing
white
house
officials
on
talks
between
seoul
and
pyongyang
the
white
house
said
trump
would
accept
the
invitation
at
a
place
and
time
to
be
determined
the
news
lifted
asian
stocks
markets
and
pulled
crude
oil
futures
along
with
them
traders
said
brent
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
at
gmt
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
previous
close
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
a
barrel
up
cents
or
percent
wti
also
fell
by
more
than
percent
the
previous
session
beyond
geopolitics
oil
markets
were
mainly
concerned
with
soaring
output
from
the
united
states
which
has
risen
by
percent
since
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
that
s
more
than
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
produces
only
russia
pumps
more
at
almost
million
bpd
it
seems
only
a
matter
of
time
before
the
becomes
the
biggest
oil
producer
in
the
world
the
main
question
which
keeps
investors
busy
is
when
exactly
this
will
be
reached
hans
van
cleef
senior
energy
economist
at
dutch
bank
abn
amro
said
in
a
note
to
investors
unlike
middle
east
producers
where
output
is
largely
dictated
by
oil
companies
producers
drill
and
sell
purely
based
on
economics
if
prices
remain
at
current
levels
or
rise
further
drillers
are
profitable
and
will
raise
output
if
prices
stumble
production
will
fall
the
correlation
between
the
oil
production
and
the
oil
prices
will
remain
considerable
van
cleef
said
as
much
as
on
production
oil
prices
will
depend
on
demand
global
demand
will
continue
to
grow
by
million
barrels
per
day
in
both
and
this
would
offer
enough
room
for
oil
producers
to
increase
production
and
for
opec
and
her
allies
to
minimalise
the
production
cuts
towards
the
end
of
van
cleef
said
the
middle
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
russia
since
have
been
leading
an
effort
to
withhold
production
to
prop
up
prices
