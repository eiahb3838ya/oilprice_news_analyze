the
kaombo
oil
block
will
produce
its
first
oil
this
summer
total
said
on
thursday
once
it
is
fully
up
and
running
it
will
add
roughly
percent
to
the
opec

of

earlier
this

total
said
it
can
pump
bpd
half
the
oil
block
s
eventual
production
the
billion
offshore
project
will
add
a
significant
amount
of
oil
to
africa
s
number
two
exporter
at
a
time
when
it
is
bound
by
output
limits
under
a
deal
orchestrated
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
a
source
close
to
the
project
said
the
block
was
expected
to
pump
roughly
bpd
by
august
another
fpso
kaombo
sul
is
still
in
singapore
opec
is
reducing
output
by
roughly
million
bpd
as
part
of
a
deal
with
russia
and
other
producers
that
began
in
january
and
was
extended
until
the
end
of
so
far
angola
has
complied
comfortably
pumping
even
less
than
the
maximum
agreed
last
month
its
output
of
million
bpd
amounted
to
percent
of
compliance
with
promised
cuts
of
bpd
declining
production
at
mature
fields
has
cut
into
angola
s
output
but
the
kaombo
addition
could
complicate
efforts
to
maintain
compliance
angola
s
state
oil
company
sonangol
has
said
production
will
be
roughly
steady
this
year
and
the
cuts
earlier
in
the
year
could
keep
its
average
compliance
for
the
year
within
opec
s
limits
longer
term
angola
is
expected
to
struggle
just
to
maintain
output
with
the
international
energy
agency
iea
warning
that
only
venezuela
will
see
a
bigger
drop
in
production
over
the
next
five
years
angola
s
oil
production
peaked
at
million
bpd
in
the
iea
said
warning
in
its
outlook
that
capacity
will
drop
by
some
bpd
by
even
with
the
new
projects
angola
is
expected
to
post
the
biggest
slide
in
capacity
after
venezuela
as
ageing
oil
fields
lose
steam
and
foreign
investors
faced
with
relatively
uncompetitive
prospects
lose
enthusiasm
