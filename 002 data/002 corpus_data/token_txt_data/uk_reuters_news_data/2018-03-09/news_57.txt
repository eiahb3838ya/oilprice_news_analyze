hydro
asa
expects
to
see
a
negative
impact
from
the
decision
to
impose
import
tariffs
a
company
spokesman
said
on
friday
the
introduction
of
unilateral
trade
barriers
such
as
quotas
and
tariffs
will
negatively
effect
hydro
and
may
distort
normal
trade
said
company
spokesman
oeyvind
breivik
there
is
some
uncertainty
over
which
countries
can
or
will
be
exempted
from
the
barriers
so
the
concrete
effects
for
hydro
are
somewhat
uncertain
