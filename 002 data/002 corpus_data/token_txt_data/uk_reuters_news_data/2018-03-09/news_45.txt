high-profile activists slam u.s., canadian sanctions on venezuela
caracas
reuters
philosopher
noam
chomsky
and
hollywood
star
danny
glover
joined
other
activists
on
friday
in
condemning
and
canadian
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
socialist
government
saying
they
hurt
the
poor
and
torpedoed
political
reconciliation
the
two
activists
were
among
signatories
of
an
open
letter
to
the
washington
and
ottawa
governments
urging
them
to
reconsider
recent
measures
to
pressure
president
nicolas
maduro
s
administration
the
united
states
and
canada
have
slapped
individual
sanctions
on
a
handful
of
venezuelan
officials
including
maduro
over
accusations
of
corruption
democratic
abuses
and
human
rights
violations
the
measures
include
freezing
assets
and
preventing
and
canadian
nationals
from
dealing
with
them
the
government
has
also
imposed
financial
measures
intended
to
stop
venezuela
from
contracting
new
debt
and
is
considering
oil
sanctions
while
critics
say
sanctions
are
aimed
only
at
venezuela
s
dictatorship
maduro
says
they
are
part
of
an
international
conspiracy
intended
to
topple
him
and
take
control
of
the
opec
nation
s
oil
wealth
we
are
deeply
concerned
by
the
use
of
illegal
sanctions
whose
effect
falls
most
heavily
on
the
poorest
and
most
marginal
sectors
of
society
to
coerce
political
and
economic
change
in
a
sister
democracy
the
letter
said
sanctions
merely
complicate
efforts
by
the
vatican
dominican
republic
and
other
international
actors
to
mediate
a
resolution
to
the
deep
polarization
in
former
venezuelan
leader
hugo
chavez
used
to
enjoy
support
from
a
raft
of
leftist
personalities
but
his
successor
maduro
has
seen
foreign
opinion
harden
against
him
particularly
during
opposition
protests
last
year
it
is
no
secret
that
venezuela
unlike
mexico
honduras
colombia
egypt
or
saudi
arabia
is
targeted
for
regime
change
by
the
precisely
because
of
venezuela
s
leadership
in
resisting
hegemony
and
the
imposition
of
the
model
in
latin
america
the
activists
letter
said
opposition
supporters
say
western
celebrities
are
ingenuous
in
supporting
venezuela
s
leftist
government
without
understanding
how
its
policies
have
spawned
malnutrition
disease
and
mass
emigration
