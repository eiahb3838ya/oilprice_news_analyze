indian
firm
ola
s
pilot
project
to
test
a
fleet
of
electric
vehicles
in
the
western
city
of
nagpur
was
expected
to
herald
a
coming
revolution
in
the
indian
autos
industry
so
far
though
it
has
only
exposed
fractures
in
prime
minister
narendra
modi
s
ambitions
to
make
all
new
vehicles
electric
by
with
an
initial
investment
of
about
million
million
pounds
ola
launched
the
project
last
year
at
an
event
that
had
all
the
trappings
of
a
state
function
including
a
big
gathering
and
flagging
off
by
transport
minister
nitin
gadkari
but
nine
months
later
the
program
has
hit
a
snag
ola
drivers
unhappy
with
long
wait
times
at
charging
stations
and
high
operating
expenses
want
to
return
their
cars
and
switch

variants

electric
car
drivers
interviewed
by
reuters
in
nagpur
more
than
a
dozen
said
they
have
either
returned
their
electric
taxis
and
switched
to
diesel
or
are
planning
to
do
so
ola
had
said
it
would
make
charging
points
available
across
four
locations
in
nagpur
a
city
of
about
million
people
for
its
fleet
of
electric
vehicles
but
on
a
visit
to
the
city
in
late
january
reuters
found
only
about
a
dozen
charging
points
ola
has
since
added
additional
charging
points
but
is
still
short
of
its
target

getting
infrastructure
built
in
the
world
s
biggest
democracy
where
a
culture
proliferates
is
a
barrier
for
a
lot
of
businesses
in
india
and
it
is
proving
to
be
the
same
for
charging
stations
ola
was
forced
to
close
one
in
nagpur
last
year
after
protests
by
residents
angered
by
traffic
jams
caused
by
drivers
it
took
more
than
five
months
to
get
government
clearances
to
begin
operating
another
station
the
hurdles
faced
by
ola
in
setting
up
sufficient
charging
stations
for
a
fleet
of
expensive
electric
cars
with
a
limited
driving
range
expose
the
challenges
the
indian
government
and
automakers
will
face
if
they
are
to
get
anywhere
near
realising
the
vision
global
auto
makers
have
repeatedly
warned
that
india
is
not
ready
for
electrification
saying
the
government
must
first
lay
down
a
clear
policy
provide
incentives
to
encourage
manufacturing
of
electric
vehicles
to
bring
down
their
cost
and
create
the
charging
infrastructure
gadkari
added
to
uncertainty
when
he
said
last
month
that
the
government
will
no
longer
draft
a
separate
electric
vehicle
policy
he
did
not
comment
on
the
vision
the
ola
project
has
not
turned
out
to
be
economically
viable
for
either
the
company
or
its
drivers
said
one
industry
source
familiar
with
ola
s
strategy
the
project
s
not
flying
as
of
now
and
the
economics
is
not
working
out
the
source
said
electric
car
sales
in
india
one
of
the
world
s
auto
markets
made
up
less
than
percent
of
annual
sales
of
more
than
million
passenger
cars
the
lack
of
demand
is
mainly
because
they
are
expensive
due
to
high
battery
costs
and
as
their
range
is
limited
and
there
isn
t
a
charging
infrastructure
by
comparison
in
china
in
electric
vehicles
made
up
about
percent
of
annual
passenger
car
sales
of
million
the
indian
government
had
been
determined
to
promote
electric
vehicle
use
starting
with
public
transport
and
taxis
to
combat
rising
pollution
and
reduce
the
nation
s
dependence
on
imported
oil
india
s
ambition
was
part
of
a
broader
move
by
countries
like
china
and
the
united
kingdom
which
have
set
similar
goals
this
has
spurred
billions
of
dollars
in
investments
by
carmakers
like
volkswagen
and
ford
motor
even
as
many
in
the
industry
say
they
are
unsure
who
will
buy
the
massive
numbers
of
electric
vehicles
governments
want
them
to
produce
mahindra
mahindra
is
the
only
electric
carmaker
in
india
and
the
high
cost
of
even
its
model
which
starts
at
rupees
pounds
is
a
barrier
for
many
car
buyers
and
a
for
taxi
drivers
who
can
get
a
diesel
or
gasoline
propelled
car
for
about
half
the
price
ola
has
deep
pockets
and
while
it
has
with
mahindra
for
the
pilot
project
its
struggle
to
make
the
fleet
viable
in
a
small
indian
city
with
much
less
congestion
and
space
constraints
than
the
biggest
cities
like
mumbai
underscores
the
magnitude
of
the
challenges
a
shortage
of
stations
and
the
limited
range
of
cars
about
kilometres
has
meant
longer
queues
to
recharge
during
summer
months
when
batteries
discharge
faster
and
need
to
be
recharged
more
the
situation
may
worsen
unless
more
charging
points
are
added
said
several
drivers
none
of
whom
wanted
to
be
named
as
they
feared
retribution
from
the
company
the
cars
are
owned
by
ola
and
leased
to
drivers
for
rupees
a
day
but
many
complain
that
the
amount
is
too
high
and
they
need
to
work
for
hours
to
make
a
decent
living
given
they
waste
hours
a
day
on
charging
one
of
the
drivers
said
that
after
paying
ola
the
rent
for
the
car
and
shelling
out
rupees
per
day
for
charging
he
is
left
with
about
rupees
at
the
end
of
a
day
giving
him
little
time
to
rest
or
spend
with
his
family
if
they
don
t
give
us
the
charging
facility
why
should
we
drive
these
cars
said
the
driver
who
had
just
spent
an
hour
waiting
for
his
turn
to
charge
the
car
and
would
have
to
wait
for
another
minutes
while
it
charges
ola
founder
and
ceo
bhavish
aggarwal
told
reuters
last
april
that
the
company
would
pilot
a
few
thousand
electric
vehicles
in
several
indian
cities
in
and
then
scale
up
in
a
major
way
however
almost
a
year
later
it
has
still
to
take
the
experiment
beyond
nagpur
at
india
s
biennial
auto
show
in
february
electric
cars
took
centre
stage
but
most
were
at
a
concept
stage
or
sold
only
in
global
markets
as
automakers
like
toyota
honda
and
renault
took
a
circumspect
approach
to
the
new
tilt
toward
electrification
once
we
make
an
investment
there
are
huge
risks
said
akito
tachibana
managing
director
of
toyota
s
india
arm
adding
as
of
now
there
is
no
clarity
on
who
would
buy
such
cars
and
what
incentives
the
government
will
offer
charging
infrastructure
is
a
big
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
needs
to
be
resolved
for
evs
to
be
viable
india
has
only
about
charging
stations
with
charging
points
according
to
a
january
report
by
global
consultancy
ey
analysts
estimate
it
costs
between
and
to
set
up
a
station
and
that
comes
on
top
of
expensive
land
purchases
needed
to
build
them
the
ministry
of
heavy
industries
estimates
a
subsidy
worth
billion
rupees
will
be
needed
to
promote
evs
and
charging
infrastructure
automakers
argue
in
the
the
government
should
make
land
available
and
invest
in
building
stations
while
over
the
it
would
need
to
offer
incentives
to
private
investors
one
additional
problem
is
that
unlike
in
western
countries
most
car
owners
in
india
do
not
have
garages
or
formal
parking
where
chargers
for
cars
could
be
installed
another
issue
is
lack
of
a
policy
outlining
incentives
which
has
helped
countries
like
china
push
electric
vehicle
sales
government
wrangling
over
policy
formulation
in
india
is
making
it
difficult
for
carmakers
to
plan
investments
any
distraction
from
the
focus
to
draw
a
plan
for
introducing
electric
vehicles
is
going
to
make
this
a
exercise
that
might
not
attract
the
attention
of
the
right
kind
of
investors
