touching
on
the
most
contentious
element
of
his
trip
arms

britain
and
saudi
arabia
have
set
themselves
a

and
investment
target
for
the
coming

seeking
to
convince
wary

sharing
with
saving
british
lives
and
has
licensed
billions

pounds
of
weapons

controversial
backdrop
to
the
warm
diplomatic
welcome
for
prince
mohammed

to
protest
the

the
thorny
topic
was
due
to
be
discussed
at

was
tempered
with
