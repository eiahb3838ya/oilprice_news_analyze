higher
oil
prices
and
a
positive
earnings
outlook
for
energy
companies
are
expected
to
fuel
a
rebound
in
north
american
oil
and
gas
initial
public
offerings
in
with
bankers
betting
investors
will
remain
optimistic
about
the
sector
even
if
the
broader
stock
market
remains
volatile
ipos
in
the
united
states
and
canada
could
reach
their
highest
in
four
years
and
oilfield
services
companies
are
seen
leading
the
recovery
given
their
pressing
capital
needs
more
than
a
dozen
energy
companies
are
lining
up
to
list
this
year
including
several
private
exploration
and
production
e
p
companies
denham
covey
park
energy
may
be
the
first
of
these
names
with
initial
conversations
with
investors
planned
in
the
next
few
weeks
followed
by
a
formal
deal
marketing
depending
on
investor
response
two
sources
aware
of
the
matter
told
reuters
vine
resources
and
indigo
natural
resources
are
also
eyeing
ipos
this
year
while
potential
canadian
candidates
include
canbriam
energy
and
velvet
energy
two
separate
sources
said
warburg
pincus
one
of
the
biggest
private
equity
investors
in
the
canadian
energy
patch
backs
both
canbriam
and
velvet
denham
and
warburg
declined
to
comment
blackstone
group
and
indigo
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
access
to
equity
markets
for
energy
firms
comes
at
an
opportune
time
for
private
equity
firms
seeking
to
cash
out
of
investments
investors
are
encouraged
that
crude
prices
have
stayed
above
a
barrel
even
as
drilling
activity
pushed
oil
output
past
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
first
time
since
company
fundamentals
are
also
more
resilient
than
months
ago
supporting
the
ipo
pipeline
the
stability
in
oil
prices
is
a
net
positive
if
energy
companies
can
demonstrate
to
investors
that
they
can
generate
cash
flow
in
the
current
oil
price
environment
they
can
go
public
said
grant
kernaghan
citigroup
s
managing
director
of
canadian
investment
banking
the
recent
volatility
hasn
t
resulted
in
markets
shutting
down
he
added
suggesting
equity
markets
were
still
open
despite
a
period
up
to
when
the
s
p
dropped
over
percent
still
experts
said
any
selloff
on
the
oil
market
that
pushes
crude
prices
below
could
derail
these
plans
to
go
public
after
ipos
worth
billion
in
the
slump
in
oil
from
saw
the
subsequent
three
years
raising
just
a
combined
billion
from
offerings
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
so
far
this
year
five
energy
ipos
have
raised
billion
according
to
reuters
calculations
four
of
these
five
oilfield
services
ipos
had
successful
debuts
while
ipsco
tubulars
pulled
its
offering
due
to
the
market
selloff
quintana
energy
services
inc
priced
its
ipo
below
the
guidance
range
and
then
saw
its
stock
drop
further
upon
opening
however
cactus
inc
sold
more
shares
than
originally
planned
and
traded
higher
on
its
first
day
unlike
last
year
when
an
initial
flurry
of
energy
ipos
was
curtailed
by
a
slump
in
crude
prices
bankers
hope
stronger
fundamentals
will
sustain
interest
in
new
offerings
in
last
year
services
ipos
were
based
on
forward
earnings
and
lacked
existing
cash
flows
meaning
falling
oil
prices
undermined
investor
confidence
now
companies
are
well
supported
by
current
earnings
and
trade
at
low
multiples
said
robert
santangelo
of
equity
capital
markets
for
the
americas
at
credit
suisse
so
far
exploration
and
production
e
p
companies
have
not
shown
the
same
willingness
as
services
firms
to
accept
a
lower
valuation
that
would
restart
offerings
from
that
space
creating
a
mexican
between
potential
ipo
candidates
over
who
goes
first
according
to
one
energy
banker
who
spoke
on
condition
of
anonymity
covey
has
an
incentive
to
go
first
a
financing
agreement
that
becomes
more
expensive
if
it
is
not
able
to
list
this
year
according
to
one
of
the
sources
aware
of
the
ipo
plans
even
as
companies
prepare
for
ipos
m
a
remains
a
viable
exit
option
for
buyout
firms
private
equity
firms
have
been
waiting
for
a
better
environment
the
settling
of
the
oil
price
does
help
them
move
forward
