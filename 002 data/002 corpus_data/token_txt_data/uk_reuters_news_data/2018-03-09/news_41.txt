saudi
aramco
s
partial
privatisation
has
loomed
over
the
oil
market
for
the
last
two
years
influencing
expectations
about
oil
prices
but
what
if
it
never
happens
the
possibility
of
selling
a
minority
stake
in
the
giant
oil
company
was
first
mentioned
in
a
newspaper
interview
published
in
january
by
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
the
possibility
merited
little
more
than
a
brief
mention
in
a
section
about
economic
reforms
diversification
and
privatisation
of
state
assets
interview
with
muhammad
bin
salman
economist
but
this
passing
reference
has
spawned
an
enormous
amount
of
activity
from
consultants
bankers
stock
exchanges
governments
and
journalists
all
competing
to
benefit
from
the
sale
of
the
century
saudi
aramco
has
reportedly
prepared
a
set
of
corporate
accounts
to
international
standards
and
commissioned
an
external
audit
of
its
oil
reserves
ready
for
investors
the
pending
sale
has
triggered
a
scramble
among
stock
exchanges
including
in
the
united
states
the
united
kingdom
and
hong
kong
to
secure
a
slice
of
the
listing
with
each
receiving
government
backing
technical
preparations
for
a
sale
appear
to
have
been
largely
completed
over
the
last
two
years
but
the
actual
date
for
any
sale
has
been
repeatedly
pushed
back
the
decision
on
whether
where
and
when
to
list
shares
lies
with
the
government
rather
than
aramco
which
means
that
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
newly
promoted
crown
prince
but
there
is
still
no
timeline
for
a
decision
let
alone
an
actual
listing
and
the
timetable
now
appears
to
have
slipped
into
saudi
policymakers
have
indicated
shares
will
be
listed
on
the
domestic
stock
exchange
but
there
is
in
fact
no
firm
commitment
to
list
them
internationally
the
government
has
a
range
of
options
from
a
listing
a
private
sale
of
shares
to
a
strategic
partner
an
international
listing
or
some
combination
of
any
of
these
three
the
longer
the
decision
is
delayed
the
more
likely
it
is
that
the
sale
will
not
occur
or
will
be
scaled
back
to
a
listing
on
the
domestic
stock
market
chartbook
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
a
major
strategic
initiative
has
been
substantially
modified
or
quietly
dropped
saudi
arabia
s
gas
initiative
was
launched
in
another
point
when
oil
prices
had
slumped
and
the
kingdom
s
finances
were
under
pressure
the
gas
initiative
was
part
of
a
broader
package
of
reforms
aimed
at
diversifying
the
economy
reducing
the
role
of
the
government
and
increasing
the
involvement
of
the
private
sector
the
initiative
attracted
significant
interest
from
international
oil
firms
but
meandered
for
several
years
without
making
progress
before
being
quietly
shelved
around
the
question
is
whether
the
partial
privatisation
of
saudi
aramco
will
meet
the
same
fate
reform
efforts
in
saudi
arabia
tend
to
be
cyclical
slumping
oil
prices
and
revenues
push
diversification
and
privatisation
onto
the
political
agenda
only
for
momentum
to
be
lost
when
prices
recover
like
the
gas
initiative
the
proposal
to
sell
shares
in
aramco
was
made
when
prices
were
at
cyclical
lows
in
early
now
oil
prices
are
recovering
the
imperative
to
privatise
is
fading
from
the
very
beginning
the
rationale
for
selling
shares
in
aramco
has
never
been
clear
aramco
could
lead
to
improvements
in
corporate
governance
the
deputy
crown
prince
mentioned
improving
transparency
and
countering
possible
corruption
as
reasons
in
his
interview
selling
shares
on
the
domestic
stock
exchange
could
provide
a
means
of
giving
more
ordinary
saudis
a
sense
of
ownership
and
spur
the
development
of
a
domestic
financial
services
industry
selling
shares
could
be
the
first
step
towards
a
much
more
ambitious
diversification
of
government
assets
and
revenues
away
from
the
oil
sector
or
it
could
simply
be
a
exercise
the
plan
was
mooted
when
government
revenues
were
at
a
low
point
the
budget
was
running
a
heavy
deficit
and
financial
reserves
were
falling
rapidly
the
sale
has
always
been
controversial
within
aramco
itself
and
in
parts
of
saudi
society
with
many
people
quietly
questioning
whether
it
makes
sense
as
saudis
prepare
to
sell
shares
in
oil
giant
some
have
misgivings
reuters
aramco
leaders
and
employees
bristle
at
the
suggestion
the
company
has
been
badly
run
arguing
that
it
is
in
fact
one
of
the
institutions
in
the
kingdom
selling
shares
on
the
domestic
stock
market
or
to
foreigners
could
reduce
the
benefits
of
oil
wealth
for
saudis
if
it
caused
the
diversion
of
funds
to
saudi
and
foreign
owners
critics
fear
the
decision
to
sell
shares
when
oil
prices
are
near
the
bottom
of
the
cycle
would
undervalue
the
company
finally
the
sale
is
arguably
too
small
to
achieve
meaningful
diversification
or
raise
significant
sums
of
money
for
the
government
selling
percent
of
the
company
is
not
enough
to
achieve
meaningful
reduction
in
the
government
s
dependence
on
oil
even
if
the
sale
valued
the
company
at
trillion
as
the
crown
prince
has
said
it
is
worth
the
sale
of
percent
for
billion
would
not
raise
enough
money
to
make
much
of
a
difference
the
kingdom
still
has
foreign
reserves
worth
almost
billion
and
an
extra
billion
would
not
be
nearly
enough
to
fund
the
ambitious
social
and
economic
transformation
projects
outlined
by
the
government
as
oil
prices
have
risen
the
government
budget
deficit
has
narrowed
and
the
kingdom
foreign
reserves
have
stabilised
the
kingdom
has
sought
other
sources
of
financing
including
expropriating
assets
as
part
of
the
campaign
which
the
government
hopes
will
raise
billion
as
oil
revenues
grow
again
the
benefits
from
the
sale
will
start
to
seem
less
compared
with
the
inevitable
problems
and
costs
making
an
eventual
sale
less
likely
that
said
the
prospect
of
a
sale
has
enabled
the
kingdom
to
drum
up
significant
interest
from
bankers
and
professional
services
firms
and
it
has
also
allowed
it
to
play
off
governments
including
the
united
states
and
britain
with
so
many
keen
suitors
saudi
is
likely
to
keep
its
options
open
for
as
long
as
possible
and
is
unlikely
to
shut
the
door
on
an
international
sale
completely
still
its
leaders
appear
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
commit
to
a
timetable
or
venue
in
the
end
they
might
settle
for
a
simpler
domestic
listing
with
or
without
the
sale
of
a
small
strategic
stake
to
an
international
investor
ultimately
the
decision
will
be
taken
by
saudi
arabia
s
de
facto
ruler
mohammed
bin
salman
and
on
this
issue
he
appears
to
be
in
no
rush
