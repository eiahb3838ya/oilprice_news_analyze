the

upbeat
jobs
data
last

particularly
a
stronger
than

rise
in

fanned
speculation
about
faster
interest
rate
rises
in
the
united

causing
a
rout
in
the

market
and
hammering
world
equities
the
consensus
expectation
for

for

is
for
a
percent
increase
while
the
headline

is
seen
to
have
grown
by

according
to
a
reuters
poll
it
s
expected
to
drop
a
little
to
percent
year
which
is
still
up
there
with
the
highest
we

seen
since

said
oanda

the

gains
for
world
stocks
however
came
largely
from
shares
in
asia
which
staged
sharp
rallies
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
was

meet
north

news
that
the
united
states
is
pressing
ahead
with
tariffs
on
steel
and
aluminium
imports
did
not
seem
to
rattle
investors
as
much
as
the
initial
proposals
for
them
did
last
week
so
far
the
tariffs
are
mainly
symbolic
as
imports
of
steel
and
aluminium
only
account
for
percent
of
total
imports
of
goods
in
the
and
it
remains
our
base
case
that
this
is
not
going
to
evolve
into
a
global
trade
war
as
it
would
hurt
everyone
economically
strategists
at
danske
bank
wrote
in
a
research
note
in
currencies
the
japanese
yen
was
the
biggest
mover
falling
more
than
half
a
percent
against
the
dollar
to
its
lowest
in
over
a
week
following
the
news
on
north
korea
the
drop
followed
the
bank
of
japan
s
policy
meeting
where
it
kept
monetary
policy
unchanged
and
stuck
to
its
upbeat
view
of
the
economy
the
yen
has
gained
percent
against
the
dollar
since
the
start
of
the
year
on
concerns
that
the
outbreak
of
a
trade
war
would
derail
a
global
growth
recovery
we
are
trying
to
find
a
bottom
on
and
the
other
thing
to
watch
for
is
when
the
typical
repatriation
flows
that
are
made
by
japanese
institutions
for
the
fiscal
year
end
abates
and
that
might
push
even
higher
