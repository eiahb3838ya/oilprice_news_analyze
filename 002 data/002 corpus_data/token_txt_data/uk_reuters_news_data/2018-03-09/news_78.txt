from

the
mood
had
already
brightened
a
little
after
trump
pressed
ahead
with
tariffs
but
offered
conditional
exemptions
for
canada
and
mexico
offering
at

the
hope
a
trade
war
could
be
averted
the
white

said
other
countries
could
apply
for
exemptions
on
the
percent
tariff
on
steel
imports
and
percent
for
aluminium
but
details
were
sparse
on
when
they
might
be
granted
and
under
what
terms
several
major
trading
partners
have
said
they
will
respond
with
tariffs
or
direct
action
of
their
own
markets
have
cheered
up
a
little
but
exclusions
are
likely
to
come
with
caveats
demanding
reciprocity
that
s
the
kind
of
guy
the
president
is
said
greg

at

fears
have
been
eased

it

cited

following

while
the

did
drop
its
easing
bias
as
some
expected
draghi
sounded
in
no
rush
to

the

tone
was
enough
to
see

fears
of

volatility

the

plenty
of

to
maintain

campaign

to

down
the
prospect
of

actual
