asian
shares
pared
sharp
early

on

ahead
of
payrolls
data
which
could
hasten
federal

and
as
some
caution
set
in
about
the
new
entente
between
north
korean
leader
kim
jong
un
and
president
donald
trump
kim
has
committed
to
denuclearisation
and
offered
to
hold
the
korea
summit
marking
a
potentially
dramatic
breakthrough
in
the
north
korea
nuclear
standoff
trump
s
aides
have
been
wary
of
north
korea
s
diplomatic
overtures
because
of
its
history
of
reneging
on
international
commitments
whether
it
comes
to
anything
remains
to
be
seen
as
we
have
seen
this
happen
several
times
over
the
decades
said
shane
oliver
chief
economist
for
amp
or
maybe
its
development
of
nuclear
weapons
was
all
just
negotiating
ploy
at
least
it
will
be
quiet
on
this
front
for
a
while
the
jubilation
about
the
informal
alliance
did
not
last
long
as
equity
investors
booked
profits

what
seems
certain
is
that
over
the
coming
to
months
unfolding
negotiations
should
ensure
greater
geopolitical
tranquility
on
the
korean
peninsula
said
aninda
mitra
senior
sovereign

bny
mellon
investment
management
the
main
risk
is
of
course
trump
mishandles
the
potential
for
a
breakthrough
resulting
in
even
heightened
risk
of
a
the
mood
had
already
brightened
a
little
after
trump
pressed
ahead
with
tariffs
but
offered
conditional
exemptions
for
canada
and
mexico
offering
at
least
the
hope
that
a
global
trade
war
could
be
averted
the
white
house
said
other
countries
could
apply
for
exemptions
on
the
percent
tariff
on
steel
imports
and
percent
for
aluminium
but
details
were
sparse
on
when
they
might
be
granted
and
under
what
terms
several
major
trading
partners
have
said
they
will
respond
with
tariffs
or
direct
action
of
their
own
markets
have
cheered
up
a
little
but
exclusions
are
likely
to
come
with
caveats
demanding
reciprocity
that
s
the
kind
of
guy

president
is

rising
protectionism
was
a
risk
cited
overnight
by
european
central

president
mario
draghi
following
the
central

meeting
while
the
ecb
did
drop
its
easing
bias
as
some
expected
draghi
sounded
in
no
rush
to
start
unwinding
stimulus
the
dovish
tone
was
enough
to
see
the
euro
fade
back

having
shed
