uk government resists "latte levy" in bitter blow for campaigners
london
reuters
britain
has
resisted
a
call
by
campaigners
and
lawmakers
to
impose
a
latte
levy
on
coffee
cups
opting
instead
to
reduce
the
use
of
the
cups
through
voluntary
measures
less
than
percent
of
coffee
cups
are
recycled
in
britain
because
of
the
tightly
bonded
plastic
liner
the
difficulties
of
recycling
packaging
which
has
been
in
contact
with
food
and
drink
and
a
lack
of
facilities
a
committee
of
lawmakers
had
recommended
a
pence
levy
on
the
use
of
disposable
coffee
cups
to
try
to
cut
on
their
usage
the
government
has
previously
introduced
a
pence
charge
on
plastic
bags
and
in
friday
s
response
to
the
committee
s
recommendations
it
said
the
plastic
bag
levy
showed
that
these
types
of
incentives
can
change
consumer
behavior
and
this
is
something
we
could
consider
amongst
other
policy
options
but
the
government
offered
no
concrete
proposals
to
introduce
a
levy
on
the
cups
adding
that
coffee
shops
were
already
offering
discounts
to
customers
who
use
reusable
cups
and
better
provision
for
recycling
we
are
pleased
that
major
coffee
retail
chains
are
taking
action
to
reduce
coffee
cups
the
government
said
in
its
response
adding
that
cup
makers
could
also
be
encouraged
to
produce
more
products
these
potential
incentives
would
all
work
towards
the
same
overall
outcomes
of
increasing
recycling
and
reducing
mary
creagh
chair
of
the
environmental
audit
committee
which
had
recommended
the
levy
said
they
had
put
forward
practical
solutions
to
the
disposable
packaging
crisis
the
government
s
response
shows
that
despite
warm
words
they
plan
no
real
action
