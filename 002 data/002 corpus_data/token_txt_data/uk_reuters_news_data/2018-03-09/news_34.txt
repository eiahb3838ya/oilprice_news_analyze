world
shares
hit
their
highest
in
over
a
week
on
friday
as
a
slowdown
in
wage
gains
in
the
united
states
helped
cool
fears
about
faster
inflation
and
interest
rate
hikes
this
year
the
msci
world
index
which
tracks
shares
in
countries
was
up
percent
on
the
day
and
percent
for
the
week
having
also
been
buoyed
by
news
donald
trump
and
north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
planned
to
meet
by
may
nonfarm
payrolls
jumped
by
jobs
last
month
data
from
the
labor
department
showed
recording
their
biggest
increase
in
more
than
years
but
average
hourly
earnings
edged
up
only
four
cents
or
percent
to
which
was
a
slowdown
from
the
percent
rise
in
january
that
also
lowered
the
increase
in
average
hourly
earnings
to
percent
from
percent
in
january
stocks
gained
after
the
data
with
both
the
benchmark
s
p
and
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
each
up
percent
the
great
news
is
the
labor
participation
rate
went
up
the
headline
numbers
are
great
and
the
average
hourly
earnings
has
settled
back
down
into
consensus
said
art
hogan
chief
market
strategist
at
wunderlich
securities
in
new
york
it
s
a
great
report
across
the
board
and
i
think
that
moves
markets
upbeat
jobs
data
last
month
particularly
a
stronger
than
expected
rise
in
wages
fanned
speculation
about
faster
interest
rate
rises
in
the
united
states
causing
a
rout
in
the
bond
market
and
hammering
world
equities
the
federal
reserve
is
widely
expected
to
raise
interest
rates
at
least
three
times
this
year
with
some
analysts
even
expecting
four
the
stoxx
index
jumped
to
a
session
high
it
was
last
up
percent
and
britain
s
ftse
rose
percent
to
a
session
high
shares
in
asia
which
staged
sharp
rallies
after
president
donald
trump
said
he
was
prepared
to
meet
north
korea
s
kim
jong
un
potentially
marking
a
major
breakthrough
in
nuclear
tensions
between
the
two
countries
japan
s
nikkei
rose
percent
and
south
korean
stocks
gained
more
than
percent
in
currencies
the
japanese
yen
was
the
biggest
mover
falling
more
than
half
a
percent
against
the
dollar
to
its
lowest
in
over
a
week
following
the
news
on
north
korea
the
drop
was
partly
a
anti
move
but
also
followed
a
bank
of
japan
meeting
where
it
kept
monetary
policy
unchanged
and
gave
no
hint
of
ending
its
massive
stimulus
drive
the
yen
has
gained
percent
against
the
dollar
since
the
start
of
the
year
on
concerns
that
the
outbreak
of
a
trade
war
would
derail
a
global
growth
recovery
we
are
trying
to
find
a
bottom
on
and
the
other
thing
to
watch
for
is
when
the
typical
repatriation
flows
that
are
made
by
japanese
institutions
for
the
fiscal
year
end
abates
and
that
might
push
even
higher
said
kenneth
broux
a
currency
strategist
at
societe
generale
despite
its
percent
individual
gain
on
the
yen
the
dollar
index
which
measures
the
greenback
against
a
basket
of
currencies
was
down
percent
due
to
weakness
against
the
canadian
dollar
the
pound
to
a
lesser
extent
the
euro
crude
oil
futures
