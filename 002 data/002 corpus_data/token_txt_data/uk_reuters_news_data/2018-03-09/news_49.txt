march
reuters
turkey
s
first
nuclear
power
plant
is
likely
to
miss
its
target
date
as
russian
builder
rosatom
struggles
to
find
local
partners
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
the
billion
project
is
part
of
president
tayyip
erdogan
s
vision
marking
years
since
the
founding
of
modern
turkey
rosatom
is
looking
at
four
turkish
companies
as
possible
partners
but
little
progress
has
been
made
so
far
said
one
of
the
sources
both
of
whom
declined
to
be
identified
because
the
information
is
not
yet
public
rosatom
said
last
month
it
was
in
talks
with
power
producer
euas
after
a
deal
with
a
consortium
of
three
firms
collapsed
concrete
progress
has
not
been
made
in
the
talks
so
far
and
this
includes
euas
from
the
government
side
one
source
said
adding
that
rosatom
was
keen
to
have
a
government
entity
such
as
euas
as
a
shareholder
rosatom
is
looking
for
turkish
partners
to
take
a
percent
stake
in
the
planned
akkuyu
nuclear
plant
in
southern
turkey
but
the
government
is
wary
of
euas
taking
on
the
percent
stake
by
itself
a
percent
stake
still
means
billion
of
funding
even
if
it
s
spread
over
years
the
source
said
it
is
a
very
big
project
there
are
many
details
and
issues
that
need
to
be
worked
on
we
can
t
expect
this
to
be
resolved
the
project
is
to
be
financed
by
rosatom
and
its
partners
and
will
involve
loans
from
agencies
and
banks
anastasia
polovinkina
director
of
rosatom
affiliate
rusatom
energy
international
told
a
conference
in
june
the
megawatt
akkuyu
plant
is
a
intended
to
reduce
turkey
s
dependence
on
energy
imports
but
has
been
beset
by
delays
since
russia
was
awarded
the
contract
in
but
turkish
companies
have
been
put
off
by
the
size
of
the
financing
required
as
well
as
by
concerns
they
will
not
receive
a
sufficient
share
of
the
lucrative
construction
side
of
the
deal
two
industry
sources
said
the
firms
are
also
worried
that
the
guaranteed
electricity
price
could
eventually
be
lowered
reducing
future
revenue
they
said
rosatom
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
officials
for
euas
and
the
government
declined
to
comment
rosatom
last
year
said
it
would
sell
percent
of
akkuyu
nukleer
as
the
company
which
will
build
and
operate
the
plant
to
a
consortium
made
up
of
kolin
insaat
kalyon
insaat
and
cengiz
holding
turkish
firms
that
have
been
awarded
major
infrastructure
projects
under
erdogan
however
the
final
agreement
was
never
signed
and
rosatom
said
kolin
and
kalyon
had
decided
to
pull
out
of
the
project
cengiz
remains
as
a
contractor
and
rosatom
said
last
month
that
the
two
were
in
talks
regarding
other
partnership
options
rosatom
has
said
it
expects
to
find
new
investors
for
the
project
this
year
adding
that
could
be
a
single
investor
for
the
entire
percent
or
several
firms
taking
smaller
stakes
at
a
november
news
conference
with
erdogan
russian
president
vladimir
putin
the
launch
for
the
plant
s
first
reactor
and
said
construction
would
begin
in
the
near
future
however
rosatom
has
still
not
received
a
full
construction
licence
from
turkey
s
atomic
energy
authority
construction
time
for
the
plant
is
seven
years
even
if
it
receives
the
licence
today
the
target
is
not
very
realistic
