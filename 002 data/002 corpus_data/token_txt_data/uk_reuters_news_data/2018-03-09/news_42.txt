update 1-merkel favours individual solutions for polluted cities
munich
reuters
chancellor
angela
merkel
said
on
friday
she
was
against
nationwide
schemes
to
let
cleaner
diesel
cars
operate
in
cities
that
restrict
their
use
saying
municipalities
should
find
individual
ways
to
cut
emissions
a
german
court
ruled
in
february
that
cities
can
ban
the
most
polluting
diesel
vehicles
from
their
streets
many
german
cities
exceed
european
union
limits
on
atmospheric
nitrogen
oxide
known
to
cause
respiratory
diseases
speaking
after
talks
with
business
leaders
in
the
bavarian
capital
munich
merkel
said
the
court
decision
was
very
balanced
but
diesel
technology
was
still
needed
while
germany
shifts
to
greener
options
she
said
some
officials
back
a
proposal
to
put
blue
badges
on
cleaner
diesel
vehicles
equipped
with
the
latest
emissions
technology
they
could
then
be
used
even
in
cities
that
have
introduced
driving
bans
but
merkel
opposed
that
scheme
using
identifiers
nationwide
like
a
blue
badge
as
a
first
step
would
ease
the
pressure
to
find
customized
relevant
and
specific
solutions
tailored
to
the
individual
city
and
that
s
what
we
re
prioritizing
she
said
the
court
made
clear
that
uniform
nationwide
rules
on
diesel
pollution
are
not
necessary
municipalities
and
federal
states
need
to
take
action
merkel
said
and
the
national
government
would
also
do
its
part
and
also
make
the
issue
a
priority
she
suggested
retrofitting
local
public
transport
there
has
been
a
global
backlash
against
cars
since
leading
german
carmaker
volkswagen
admitted
in
to
cheating
exhaust
tests
the
scandal
has
spread
across
the
industry
and
boosted
investment
in
electric
vehicles
of
course
the
automobile
industry
has
a
duty
to
make
good
on
what
it
neglected
in
terms
of
software
and
to
meet
its
commitments
because
mistakes
have
been
made
