he
had
formally
asked

a
federal
offshore
drilling
program
that
he
said
would
threaten
its
ocean
resources
and
endanger
efforts
toward
a
cleaner
energy
economy
new
york
state
strongly
opposes
the
department
of
the
interior
s
national
outer
continental
shelf
oil
and
gas
leasing
program
as
it
poses
an
unacceptable
threat
to

s
ocean
resources
to
our
economy
and
to
the
future
of
our
children

the
exclusion
request
the

january
proposes
to
make
over
percent
of
the
total
offshore
acreage
available
to
oil
and
gas
drilling
the
plan
would
open
two
areas

the
north
atlantic
coast

state

fossil
fuel
exploration

to
a
statement

york
stands
to
lose
nearly
jobs
and
billions
of
dollars
generated
through
tourism
and
fishing
industries
should
the
exclusion
not
be
granted
cuomo
said
instead
of
protecting
our
waters
from
another
oil
spill
like
the
one
that
devastated
the
gulf
this
new
federal
plan
only
increases
the
chances
of
another
disaster
