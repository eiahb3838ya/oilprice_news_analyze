china
s
metals
industry
issued
the
country
s
most
explicit
threat
yet
in
an
escalating
trade
spat
with
the
united
states
urging
beijing
to
retaliate
by
targeting
coal
and
other
sectors
that
are
key
to
president
donald
trump
s
support
base
two
leading
industry
bodies
representing
producers
in
the
world
s
top
steel
and
aluminium
market
said
they
strongly
oppose
duties
imposed
by
trump
to
counter
cheap
imports
especially
from
china
trump
slapped
percent
tariffs
on
steel
imports
and
percent
for
aluminium
on
thursday
the
metals
associations
urged
the
government
to
take
resolute
measures
against
imports
ranging
from
stainless
steel
to
coal
and
electronics
a
widely
read
tabloid
said
in
an
editorial
china
would
not
be
bullied
by
threats
of
a
trade
war
with
the
world
s
largest
economy
and
its
main
trading
partner
the
ministry
of
commerce
said
the
nation
would
assess
any
damage
caused
by
the
move
and
firmly
defend
its
legitimate
rights
and
it
urged
the
united
states
to
withdraw
the
measures
as
quickly
as
possible
the
ramping
up
of
rhetoric
is
a
big
shift
away
from
the
conciliatory
tone
struck
in
recent
weeks
when
chinese
president
xi
jinping
s
top
economic
adviser
liu
he
visited
washington
for
trade
talks
the
tactics
suggested
by
the
industry
associations
were
the
first
time
coal
has
been
drawn
into
the
spat
signalling
that
china
has
more
options
in
its
arsenal
if
the
dispute
descends
into
an
trade
war
the
threat
also
strikes
at
another
sector
central
to
trump
s
political
base
and
an
election
pledge
to
restore
american
industries
and
jobs
i
think
the
purpose
of
mentioning
coal
is
more
like
a
warning
that
china
could
also
take
measures
on
products
said
wang
fei
coal
analyst
at
huaan
futures
when
beijing
launched
a
probe
last
month
into
imports
of
sorghum
a
grain
used
in
animal
feed
and
liquor
it
was
viewed
as
a
warning
shot
that
beijing
was
ready
to
target
farm
states
that
voted
for
trump
china
has
ramped
up
imports
of
coal
over
the
past
year
as
its
utilities
have
sought
cheaper
foreign
fuel
that
has
helped
to
revive
the
fortunes
of
the
coal
industry
but
the
tonnage
is
not
seen
as
critical
to
china
s
power
sector
in
coal
imports
totalled
million
tonnes
worth
about
million
and
nearly
five
times
the
tonnes
taken
in
the
previous
year
the
dispute
has
also
fuelled
concern
that
soybeans
the
united
states
most
valuable
export
to
the
world
s
no
economy
might
be
caught
up
in
trade
actions
experts
say
beijing
may
not
be
ready
to
deploy
that
tactic
though
given
china
s
reliance
on
imports
of
the
oilseed
to
make
animal
feed
for
its
vast
livestock
sector
china
to
meet
trade
war
threat
trade
tensions
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
have
risen
since
trump
took
office
china
accounts
for
only
a
small
fraction
of
steel
imports
but
its
massive
industrial
expansion
has
helped
create
a
global
glut
of
steel
that
has
driven
down
prices
trump
s
behaviour
is
a
challenge
to
the
global
steel
industry
and
will
definitely
encounter
opposition
from
more
countries
the
china
iron
steel
association
cisa
said
in
a
statement
on
its
website
cisa
appealed
for
resolute
measures
against
imports
of
products
including
stainless
steel
galvanized
sheet
seamless
pipe
coal
agriculture
products
and
electronic
products
its
comments
were
echoed
in
a
separate
statement
by
the
china
nonferrous
metals
industry
association
in
an
editorial
on
friday
the
global
times
said
china
would
not
be
bullied
by
trump
s
threat
of
a
trade
war
if
the
can
not
adjust
its
own
industrial
structure
to
reduce
its
trade
deficit
and
orders
the
world
to
follow
its
words
china
and
the
rest
of
the
world
will
have
no
choice
but
to
meet
the
challenge
