washington

the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
said
on
friday
it
will
complete
a
proposal
to
expand
sales
of
higher
ethanol
blends
of
gasoline
in
time
for
summer
despite
delays
from
the
partial
government
shutdown
i
still
think
we
can
get
the
rule
done
in
time
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
get
the
rule
in
place
by
start
of
the
summertime

the
agency

assistant

for

radiation
told
reporters
at
a
public
event
in
washington
referring
to
the
name
for
gasoline
containing
percent
ethanol
president
donald
trump
had
promised
farmers
and
biofuels
producers
that
his
administration
would
lift
a
ban
on
summertime
sales
to
help
boost
demand
for
the
fuel
that
was
our
original
goal
i
think
we
can
still
meet
that
goal
wehrum
said
referring
to
finalizing
the
rule
before
june
to
get
it
in
place
for
summer
driving
season
the
partial
government
shutdown
had
raised
concerns
the
effort
might
not
be
completed
in
time
for
this
year
s
summer
driving
season
which
begins
in
june
because
agency
workers
were
furloughed
epa
workers
are
expected
back
to
work
soon
after
an
apparent
deal
reached
on
friday
to
end
the
shutdown
the
ban
had
been
imposed
over
concerns
that
contributes
to
smog
in
hot
weather
though
research
has
since
shown
that
the
percent
blend
of
fuel
may
not
increase
smog
relative
to
the
more
common
percent
blends
that
are
sold
has
been
a
issue
between
the
oil
and
corn
industries
farmers
and
biofuel
producers
have
been
lobbying
for
an
end
to
the
ban
to
bolster
demand
but
the
oil
industry
has
expressed
opposition
to
any
policy
that
would
further
raise
ethanol

share
of
the
fuel
market
