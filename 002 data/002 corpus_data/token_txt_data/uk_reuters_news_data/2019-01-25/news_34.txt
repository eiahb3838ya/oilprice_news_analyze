update 1-dutch need drastic measures to reach 2020 climate goals
amsterdam
reuters
the
dutch
government
is
lagging
far
behind
on
its
climate
goals
and
will
need
to
take
immediate
action
in
order
to
meet
legally
required
improvements
new
data
showed
on
friday
carbon
dioxide
emissions
next
year
in
the
netherlands
one
of
the
most
polluting
countries
in
europe
are
expected
to
be
percent
lower
than
in
the
government
s
environmental
agency
said
despite
a
court
order
to
reduce
them
by
percent
the
calculations
are
a
blow
for
the
government
which
is
already
struggling
to
generate
support
for
measures
needed
to
reach
its
ultimate
goal
of
halving
emissions
by
and
banning
them
by
the
government
said
in
october
that
it
would
implement
the
court
order
in
recent
days
however
politicians
have
expressed
doubt
about
the
expensive
and
often
unpopular
measures
that
would
be
needed
to
do
so
at
such
short
notice
it
s
complicated
prime
minister
mark
rutte
told
reporters
on
friday
we
will
take
it
step
by
step
to
make
sure
our
measures
are
well
supported
the
task
is
big
but
the
aim
is
to
reach
the
plans
to
reach
the
goal
will
be
presented
in
april
rutte
said
around
the
time
the
government
is
due
to
decide
how
to
reach
the
targets
set
in
the
paris
climate
agreement
uncertainty
over
the
cost
of
meeting
those
goals
has
put
rutte
s
government
under
pressure
less
than
two
months
before
elections
that
could
cost
the
coalition
its
majority
in
the
upper
house
the
court
order
to
step
up
the
fight
against
climate
change
has
increased
pressure
on
the
government
to
close
immediately
at
least
two
of
five
energy
plants
current
plans
call
for
two
to
be
shut
in
and
the
other
three
by
shutting
two
immediately
would
cost
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
and
deliver
just
half
of
the
reduction
required
further
savings
would
need
to
come
from
measures
such
as
lowering
speed
limits
improving
home
insulation
and
raising
energy
prices
experts
have
said
closing
the
coal
plants
is
the
most
obvious
option
abn
amro
energy
expert
hans
van
cleef
said
another
option
is
to
buy
emission
rights
abroad
but
that
will
be
a
hard
sell
politically
as
it
doesn
t
reduce
emissions
