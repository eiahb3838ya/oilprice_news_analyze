wrapup 4-u.s. seeks to cut off money for venezuela's maduro to aid opposition
reuters
the
united
states
is
seeking
to
ensure
that
venezuelan
oil
revenue
goes
to
opposition
leader
and
interim
president
juan
guaido
and
to
cut
off
money
from
isolated
president
nicolas
maduro
a
top
official
said
on
thursday
although
short
on
details
the
announcement
signals
that
washington
is
willing
to
go
beyond
traditional
diplomatic
measures
and
will
seek
to
drain
cash
from
maduro
s
government
which
is
already
struggling
under
an
unprecedented
economic
meltdown
such
a
move
would
significantly
strengthen
the
hand
of
guaido
who
swore
himself
in
as
interim
head
of
state
on
wednesday
with
the
support
of
washington
and
nations
around
the
region
what
we
re
focusing
on
today
is
disconnecting
the
illegitimate
maduro
regime
from
the
sources
of
his
revenues
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
told
reporters
at
the
white
house
we
think
consistent
with
our
recognition
of
juan
guaido
as
the
constitutional
interim
president
of
venezuela
that
those
revenues
should
go
to
the
legitimate
bolton
added
that
the
process
was
very
complicated
and
that
officials
were
still
studying
how
this
would
function
venezuela
s
information
ministry
did
not
reply
to
a
request
for
comment
guaido
in
an
interview
with
broadcaster
univision
said
he
believed
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
maduro
and
he
would
work
to
guarantee
humanitarian
aid
and
implement
new
economic
measures
to
rachet
up
pressure
our
challenge
is
to
secure
free
elections
and
we
want
them
as
soon
as
possible
but
we
are
living
in
a
dictatorship
he
said
from
an
undisclosed
location
washington
s
support
for
guaido
prompted
maduro
venezuela
s
leader
since
to
break
relations
with
the
united
states
on
thursday
he
said
he
was
closing
venezuela
s
embassy
in
washington
and
its
consulates
in
the
united
states
guaido
s
was
the
opposition
s
boldest
challenge
yet
to
the
socialist
party
and
has
given
maduro
s
adversaries
an
unprecedented
diplomatic
platform
to
press
for
change
in
a
nation
dogged
by
hyperinflation
rising
malnutrition
and
political
conflict
but
guaido
now
leads
what
amounts
to
a
shadow
government
disavowed
by
the
armed
forces
and
with
no
influence
over
administration
such
as
importing
and
distributing
food
and
medicine
the
industrial
engineer
said
he
had
spoken
on
thursday
by
telephone
with
supportive
heads
of
state
from
around
the
world
in
the
univision
interview
guaido
repeated
his
proposal
of
future
amnesties
to
officials
and
military
members
who
disavowed
maduro
even
saying
the
offer
could
be
extended
to
government
ministers
and
to
maduro
himself
if
they
willingly
left
power
guaido
s
ascent
was
greeted
with
excitement
by
investors
holding
venezuela
and
state
oil
company
pdvsa
bonds
which
hit
their
highest
level
since
despite
being
almost
entirely
in
default
concerns
about
potential
disruption
of
venezuelan
crude
supplies
gave
support
to
global
oil
prices
oil
revenues
are
crucial
to
the
already
crumbling
venezuelan
economy
and
routing
that
money
away
from
maduro
as
the
united
state
seeks
to
do
would
be
a
serious
blow
the
state
department
on
thursday
ordered
some
government
workers
to
leave
venezuela
and
said
citizens
should
consider
leaving
the
country
guaido
took
the
helm
of
the
national
assembly
on
with
a
call
for
the
armed
forces
to
recognise
maduro
as
a
usurper
after
his
may
widely
viewed
as
fraudulent
backing
for
him
has
come
principally
from
the
western
hemisphere
venezuelan
allies
including
russia
and
turkey
both
important
commercial
partners
criticized
guaido
s
rise
as
a
sign
of
interference
the
european
union
which
has
imposed
sanctions
on
maduro
s
government
noted
that
venezuelans
had
massively
called
for
democracy
and
the
possibility
to
freely
determine
their
own
destiny
but
stopped
short
of
recognising
guaido
maduro
in
a
rambling
speech
dismissed
guaido
s
inauguration
and
said
he
himself
remained
the
country
s
legitimate
leader
he
has
relied
extensively
on
the
military
to
maintain
power
amid
annual
inflation
of
nearly
million
percent
and
an
exodus
of
venezuelan
refugees
into
neighbouring
countries
guaido
has
said
maduro
s
inauguration
to
a
second
term
amounted
to
a
usurpation
of
power
the
vote
was
boycotted
by
venezuela
s
main
opposition
parties
with
maduro
s
two
most
popular
rivals
banned
from
running
and
socialist
party
aggressive
campaigning
opponents
called
guaido
and
allies
argue
that
the
presidency
is
vacant
as
a
result
and
that
the
constitution
calls
for
the
head
of
congress
to
assume
the
interim
presidency
in
such
a
situation
that
still
leaves
guaido
struggling
against
a
state
unwilling
to
recognise
him
and
security
forces
that
could
jail
him
as
they
did
his
mentor
leopoldo
lopez

is

arrest

leading
protests
