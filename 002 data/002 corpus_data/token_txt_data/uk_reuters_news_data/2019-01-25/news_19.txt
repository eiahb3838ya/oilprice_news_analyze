the
rig
count
in

fell
the
most
in

more
than
half
the

output
is
still
much
higher

a
year

capture
higher
prices
that
year
in
however
drillers
have
said
they
plan
to
remove
rigs
due
in
part
to
forecasts
for
lower
crude
prices
than
last

oil
output
from
seven
major
shale
formations
is
expected
to
rise
to
a
record
high
million
barrels
per
day
in
february
according
to

projections
this

but
the
eia
said
it
expects
the
increase
in
permian
production
for
february
to
be
the
smallest
in
a
month
since
may
when
output
fell
slightly
output
from
the
permian
has
come
under
pressure

oil
prices
