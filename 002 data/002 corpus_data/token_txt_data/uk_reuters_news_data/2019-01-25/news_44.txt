london

irish
prime
minister
leo
varadkar
said
soldiers
might
have
to
return
to
the
border
with
northern
ireland
if
brexit
went
wrong
bloomberg
reported
in
a
scenario
a
hard
border
could
involve
people
in
uniform
and
it
may
involve
the
need
for
example
for
cameras
physical
infrastructure
possibly
a
police
presence
or
an
army
presence
to
back
it
up
varadkar
told
bloomberg
the
problem
with
that
in
the
context
of
irish
politics
and
history
is
those
things
become
targets
he
said
ireland
has
said
it
would
find
it
difficult
to
avoid
imposing
a
hard
border
on
northern
ireland
if
the
united
kingdom
crashes
out
of
the
eu
without
a
deal
an
open
border
is
a
legacy
of
the
good
friday
agreement
which
ended
fighting
between
the
north
s
unionists
and
nationalists
who
favour
a
united
ireland
