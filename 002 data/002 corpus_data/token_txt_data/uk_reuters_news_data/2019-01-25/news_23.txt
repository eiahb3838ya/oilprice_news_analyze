sources
close
to
the

said
juan
guaido
the
head
of
the
congress
who
proclaimed
himself
president
this
week
is
considering
naming
a
new
team
to
lead
citgo
two
sources
told
reuters
but
president
nicolas
maduro
said
in
caracas
on
friday
that
his
government
would
seek
to
defend
the
refiner
raising
the
prospect
that
citgo
could
become
a
battleground
between
the
two
claimants
to
the
leadership
of
venezuela
citgo
is
the
property
of
the
venezuelan
state
maduro
said
adding
that
the
country
plans
to
continue
selling
oil
to
the
united
states
its
first
destination
for
crude
exports
and
pdvsa
s
largest
source
of
cash
the
united
states
led
numerous
other
western
hemisphere
nations
in
recognizing
guaido
as
president
of
venezuela
this
week
the
white
house
has
been
exploring
ways
to
redirect
oil
revenues
to
the
opposition
but
the
path
to
engineering
such
a
move
is
unclear
citgo
is
a
subsidiary
of
petroleos
de
venezuela
or
pdvsa
but
it
has
not
been
able
to
send
its
revenues
in
the
form
of
dividends
to
venezuela
due
to
sanctions
the
company
s
refining
network
is
the
biggest
importer
of
venezuelan
crude
run
by
appointees
of
maduro
citgo
s
board
earlier
this
week
traveled
to
the
bahamas
where
a
company
office
was
installed
last
year
it
will
seek
legal
avenues
for
the
team
to
continue
leading
the
firm
two
company
sources
said
citgo
president
asdrubal
chavez
has
been
called
to
meetings
in
caracas
according
to
those
sources
he
is
the
cousin
of
late
president
hugo
chavez
who
preceded
maduro
a
citgo
vice
president
separately
traveled
to
washington
this
week
for
talks
on
the
company
s
future
the
sources
added
citgo
is
registered
in
delaware
it
belongs
to
venezuela
which
now
has
two
presidents
the
united
states
only
recognizes
one
but
that
is
not
the
one
who
appointed
people
at
citgo
s
board
one
of
the
sources
said
explaining
the
legal
challenges
a
spokeswoman
at
citgo
said
executives
were
not
being
made
available
for
interviews
at
this
time
a
venezuelan
opposition
source
familiar
with
guaido
s
plans
said
the
goal
of
the
citgo
effort
was
to
raise
funds
adding
that
we
have
to
show
that
we
ve
got
resources
it
s
a
sign
of
the
pressure
that
we
re
putting
on
maduro
guaido
is
also
considering
making
a
request
for
funds
from
international
institutions
such
as
the
international
monetary
fund
sources
said
another
source
close
to
guaido
s
team
said
the
group
aims
to
minimize
what
they
consider
maduro
s
usurpation
of
the
republic
s
the
white
house
earlier
this
month
resumed
talks
with
oil
firms
to
explore
new
sanctions
on
venezuela
including
an
embargo
on
venezuelan
crude
sales
to
the
united
states
and
a
prohibition
on
firms
exporting
fuels
to
the
south
american
country
the
white
house
has
resisted
imposing
an
embargo
on
imports
from
venezuela
in
part
because
of
opposition
from
refiners
strapped
for
supply
of
heavy
crude
oil
refiners
currently
import
about
barrels
of
oil
daily
from
venezuela
much
of
the
demand
comes
from
complex
refiners
on
the
gulf
coast
that
use
the
crude
to
make
products
like
diesel
