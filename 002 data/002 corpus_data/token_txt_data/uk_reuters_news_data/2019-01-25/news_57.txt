was
up
percent
on
the
day
but
the
gauge
was
set
to
break
a
streak
of
gains
as
weak
economic
data
and
cautious
soundings
from

pulled
the

cut
its

continued
to
trickle
in
on
friday
with

morale
falling

in
a

according
to
the

climate
index
according
to
the
latest
reuters
polls
of
hundreds
of
economists
from
around
the
world
a
synchronised
global
economic
slowdown
is
underway
and
any
escalation
in
the
trade
war
would
trigger
a
sharper
downturn
investors
seemed
to
view
the
glass
as
in
a
note
to
clients
ubs
global
wealth
management
s
chief
investment
officer
mark
haefele
said
that
rhetoric
on
trade
has
become
more
positive
and
that
beijing
has
taken
steps
to
stimulate
its
economy
while
economic
and
earnings
growth
is
slowing
we
believe
it
is
unlikely
that
growth
will
drop
far
below
trend
he
said
at
the
same
time
there
are
reasons
to
be
cautious
about
policymakers
ability
to
follow
through
on
their
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
visit
the
united
states
on
and
for
the
next
round
of
trade
negotiations
with
washington
the
two
sides
are
miles
and
miles
from
resolving
trade
issues
but
there
is
a
fair
chance
they
will
get
a
deal
