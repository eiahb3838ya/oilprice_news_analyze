france makes biogas support conditional on cutting costs
paris
reuters
france
is
ready
to
provide
to
billion
euros
billion
of
subsidies
for
renewable
gas
but
only
if
the
industry
can
substantially
lower
its
costs
the
government
said
on
friday
produced
from
methanisation
of
agricultural
and
other
biological
waste
biogas
still
costs
about
four
times
more
than
natural
gas
imported
by
pipeline
or
lng
tankers
from
countries
like
russia
norway
algeria
or
qatar
under
its
draft
ppe
energy
plan
the
government
set
a
target
for
biogas
to
account
for
seven
to
percent
of
gas
consumption
by
from
well
below
one
percent
today
if
costs
can
fall
rapidly
gas
grid
operator
grtgaz
said
in
a
statement
the
draft
ppe
was
worrying
for
the
outlook
of
the
nascent
biomethane
industry
it
said
a
goal
to
reduce
costs
to
euros
per
mwh
by
was
way
too
ambitious
current
tariffs
are
around
euros
per
mwh
no
other
renewable
energy
sector
that
is
mature
today
has
seen
its
development
conditional
on
such
terms
grtgaz
said
it
said
the
ppe
did
not
account
for
the
fact
that
biogas
is
can
easily
be
stored
helps
deal
with
waste
and
provides
income
for
farmers
as
it
is
the
ppe
trajectory
threatens
the
development
of
this
young
industry
grtgaz
said
through
a
system
of
tenders
the
government
wants
to
boost
the
amount
of
biogas
produced
in
france
from
terawatt
hour
in
to
twh
in
and
to
twh
in
it
also
wants
to
boost
the
amount
of
biogas
injected
in
the
gas
grid
from
virtually
nothing
today
to
more
than
half
of
production
although
france
is
way
behind
biogas
pioneers
like
denmark
and
germany
the
sector
is
growing
quickly
the
amount
of
biogas
injected
in
grtgaz
pipelines
rose
percent
to
gwh
last
year
installed
capacity
is
twh
at
sites
and
there
is
a
pipeline
of
new
projects
for
a
total
capacity
of
twh
a
year
ago
french
utility
engie
ceo
isabelle
kocher
said
biogas
has
the
potential
to
grow
from
about
one
percent
of
gas
consumption
in
france
to
percent
by
percent
by
and
percent
by
over
the
next
decade
the
government
wants
to
reduce
total
french
gas
consumption
from
twh
in
to
about
thh
in
through
energy
savings
and
better
insulation
