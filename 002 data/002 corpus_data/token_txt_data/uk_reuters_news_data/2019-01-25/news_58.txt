dutch need drastic measures to reach 2020 climate goals
amsterdam
reuters
the
dutch
government
is
lagging
far
behind
on
its
climate
goals
and
will
need
to
take
immediate
action
in
order
to
meet
legally
required
improvements
the
dutch
environmental
assessment
agency
pbl
warned
on
friday
carbon
dioxide
emissions
in
in
the
netherlands
one
of
the
most
polluting
countries
in
europe
are
expected
to
be
percent
lower
than
in
the
agency
said
despite
a
court
order
to
reduce
them
by
percent
the
new
calculations
put
the
government
in
a
tight
spot
as
it
is
already
struggling
to
generate
support
for
measures
needed
to
reach
its
ultimate
goal
of
halving
emissions
by
and
banning
them
altogether
by
the
court
order
to
step
up
the
fight
against
climate
change
has
increased
the
pressure
on
the
government
to
immediately
shut
down
at
least
two
of
five
energy
plants
current
plans
call
for
two
to
be
shut
in
and
the
other
three
by
shutting
two
immediately
would
cost
hundreds
of
millions
of
euros
and
deliver
just
half
of
the
reduction
required
further
savings
would
need
to
come
from
energy
saving
measures
such
as
lowering
speed
limits
improving
home
insulation
and
raising
energy
prices
experts
have
said
the
government
in
october
said
it
would
implement
the
court
order
but
in
recent
days
politicians
have
expressed
doubts
about
the
expensive
and
often
unpopular
measures
that
would
be
needed
to
do
this
at
such
short
notice
a
government
spokesman
could
not
immediately
respond
to
the
new
calculations
on
friday
