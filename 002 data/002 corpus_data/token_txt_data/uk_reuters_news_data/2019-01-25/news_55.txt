dominated
by

and
seen
as

battleground
in
washington

europe
is
now
the
top
buyer
of

after
a
near
fivefold
spike
in

to
the

this
winter
overtaking

a

the

is
burgeoning
buoyed
by
demand
from
china
where
the
government
is
pushing
to
cut
carbon
emissions
partly
by
swapping

traders
had
expected
chinese
demand
to
soar
again
this
winter
but
beijing
had
bought
cargoes
well
in

so

in

russia
has
joined
the
european
lng
market
through
the

yamal
production
plant
led
by
novatek
and
is
poised
to
become
the
world
s
fifth
largest
lng
producer
in

to

since
december
however
lng
has
outgunned

the

enabled
the
united

to
unlock

and
after

is
expected
to
have

business

washington
s
goal
of
reducing
europe
s
dependence
on
russian
gas
last
year
trump
used
trade
negotiations
to
pressure
the
european
union
to
buy
more
gas
but
with
the
exception
of
poland
and
lithuania
which
have
linked
their
purchases
of
lng
explicitly
to
national
security
market
forces
are
the
biggest
factor
in
sales
in
december
and
january
the
dutch
gas
price
which
is
used
as
a
benchmark
for
lng
delivered
to
continental
europe
had
been
at
the
highest
level
since
the
winter
of
at
around
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
compared
to
previous
winter
seasons
rising
coal
and
carbon
prices
as
well
as
expectations
of
cold
weather
have
driven
them
up
in
contrast
asian
spot
prices
for
lng
dropped
in
december
and
january
to
their
lowest
level
since
the
winter
of
averaging
mmbtu
as
the
anticipated
surge
in
demand
failed
to
materialise
that
cut
the
premium
on
sales
to
asia
over
europe
to
just
above
mmbtu
from
close
to
mmbtu
last
winter
insufficient
to
cover
shipping
costs
europe
may
not
remain
the
top
market
for
lng
particularly
if
gas
consumption
in
asia
spikes
over
the
summer
due
to
demand
for
air
conditioning
in
addition
to
russia
europe
is
also
well
supplied
with
gas
from
norway
the
netherlands
and
algeria
and
its
use
of
coal
nuclear
and
wind
to
generate
power
means
its
demand
for
gas
used
in
some
types
of
power
stations
can
be
extremely
flexible
still
many
european
utilities
have
agreements
with
producers
cheniere
dominion
and
sempra
energy
whose
cameron
lng
plant
is
due
to
start
this
year
britain
s
centrica
will
start
taking
lng
from
cheniere
s
sabine
pass
in
september
and
the
company
confirmed
to
reuters
that
it
had
been
buying
cargos
this
winter
spain
s
naturgy
iberdrola
and
endesa
also
have
contracts
with
cheniere
starting
this
year
much
of
the
american
lng
is
looking
for
alternative
markets
aside
from
the
asian
continent
and
thanks
to
lower
transport
costs
europe
is
the
market
that
has
benefited
most
said
jose
sim√≥n
senior
vice
president
of
global
gas
at
iberdrola
a
spokesman
for
endesa
said
gas
had
become
more
competitive
naturgy
an
early
buyer
from
cheniere
confirmed
it
has
been
selling
cargoes
into
europe
this
winter
france
s
total
and
edf
and
italy
s
eni
have
contracts
too
they
did
not
respond
to
requests
for
comment
and
if
asian
demand
fails
to
materialise
this
summer
europe
is
always
an
option
because
of
the
amount
of
available
capacity
into
europe
and
the
fact
that
it
s
a
kind
of
market
if
you
can
t
find
a
better
market
into
china
korea
the
assumption
is
you
can
always
push
it
into
europe
