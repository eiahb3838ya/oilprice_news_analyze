s
government
is
planning
revisions
of
its
oil
and
gas
law
with
president
joko
widodo
this
week
responding
to
a
proposal
initiated
by
parliament
calling
for
a
plan
to
revive
the
ailing
sector
and
boost
the
country
s
energy
independence
widodo
this
week
met
with
his
senior
cabinet
members
to
craft
a
response
to
parliamentary
proposals
for
a
new
law
submitted
in
december
the
revisions
should
provide
momentum
for
regulatory
reforms
to
make
the
oil
and
gas
sector
more
efficient
transparent
straightforward
sustainable
and
provide
added
value
to
the
national
economy
widodo
said
according
to
a
statement
from
the
cabinet
secretary
issued
late
on
wednesday
formerly
an
oil
exporter
and
member
of
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
indonesia
s
crude
output
has
plunged
while
its
fuel
demand
has
surged
making
the
country
reliant
on
imports
of
gasoline
and
diesel
the
slump
in
oil
and
gas
output
has
followed
years
of
regulatory
uncertainty
recent
pressure
from
the
government
on
energy
producer
pt
pertamina
to
take
over
assets
from
oil
majors
like
chevron
and
total
has
stoked
concerns
among
foreign
energy
investors
about
the
security
of
their
projects
indonesia
has
struggled
to
revamp
its
last
set
of
oil
and
gas
laws
passed
in
and
a
parliamentary
committee
finally
proposed
a
new
law
to
the
full
body
in
december
issues
surrounding
the
oil
and
gas
sector
have
long
been
a
source
of
tension
with
foreign
investors
and
resolving
these
matters
has
proven
challenging
for
widodo
who
is
running
for
in
april
the
aim
of
this
revision
must
not
only
be
to
push
to
increase
oil
and
gas
production
but
also
to
support
the
strengthening
of
national
capacities
strengthening
domestic
industries
and
investment
in
our
human
resources
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
according
to
a
statement
on
the
cabinet
secretary
s
website
among
the
changes
the
parliament
proposed
and
which
widodo
and
his
cabinet
will
discuss
with
them
is
the
creation
of
a
new
oil
and
gas
business
entity
that
will
also
serve
as
a
regulator
called
bukmigas
according
to
a
draft
of
the
law
reviewed
by
reuters
that
agency
will
take
over
from
the
current
upstream
regulator
skkmigas
and
the
downstream
regulator
bphmigas
in
addition
to
its
regulatory
role
bukmigas
will
also
be
able
to
undertake
work
in
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
production
however
bphmigas
will
still
maintain
oversight
of
pipeline
fuel
and
gas
transportation
for
the
first
time
indonesia
would
have
a
state
petroleum
fund
bankrolled
with
revenue
the
government
makes
from
oil
and
gas
production
as
well
as
levies
and
bonuses
according
to
the
draft
more
talks
about
the
proposed
law
will
be
held
between
widodo
s
government
and
the
parliament
late
on
wednesday
energy
and
mineral
resources
ministry
legal
bureau
chief
hufron
asrofi
told
reporters
that
the
government
is
compiling
a
list
of
problems
with
the
current
draft
for
discussion
according
to
a
note
on
indonesia
s
oil
and
gas
policy
published
this
week
by
fitch
solutions
macro
research
much
work
is
still
needed
to
attract
investment
to
the
oil
and
gas
sector
when
viewed
in
the
context
of
intensifying
competition
for
foreign
direct
investments
across
south
and
southeast
asia
indonesia
remains
at
risk
of
falling
behind
despite
its
impressive
reserves
profile
and
large
market
if
the
tightening
state
grip
over
the
sector
