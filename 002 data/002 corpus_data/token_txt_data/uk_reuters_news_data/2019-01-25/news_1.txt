reuters
turkey
will
begin
drilling
for
resources
around
cyprus
foreign
minister
mevlut
cavusoglu
said
on
friday
a
move
that
could
create
tensions
with
neighbouring
cyprus
and
greece
over
ownership
of
natural
resources
attempts
to
tap
gas
and
oil
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
have
caused
friction
between
athens
and
ankara
turkey
and
the
internationally
recognised
greek
cypriot
government
in
cyprus
have
overlapping
claims
of
jurisdiction
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
research
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
a
region
thought
to
be
rich
in
natural
gas
turkey
will
start
drilling
around
cyprus
because
the
greek
cypriot
government
did
not
listen
to
ankara
s
suggestions
to
ensure
the
rights
of
turkish
cypriots
cavusoglu
said
during
an
interview
following
a
meeting
with
the
turkish
cypriot
leader
mustafa
akinci
our
second
platform
is
coming
in
february
we
were
going
to
send
it
to
the
black
sea
now
we
are
sending
it
to
the
cyprus
area
cavusoglu
said
our
drill
ship
fatih
is
currently
in
the
area
its
work
there
will
be
done
in
march
we
are
shifting
that
to
the
south
too
he
added
he
did
not
specify
whether
turkey
would
drill
for
oil
or
natural
gas
turkey
launched
its
first
drill
ship
fatih
in
october
to
drill
off
the
coast
of
turkey
s
southern
antalya
province
and
had
said
a
second
ship
that
it
purchased
would
operate
in
the
black
sea
breakaway
north
cyprus
which
is
supported
by
turkey
says
any
offshore
wealth
also
belongs
to
them
as
partners
in
the
establishment
of
the
republic
of
cyprus
in
greek
cypriots
who
run
the
island
s
internationally
recognised
government
say
any
future
benefits
of
gas
finds
will
eventually
be
shared
by
all
cypriots
cavusoglu
said
ankara
would
not
be
satisfied
by
such
statements
the
island
was
split
in
after
a
turkish
invasion
triggered
by
a
brief
coup
countless
peacemaking
endeavours
have
failed
and
offshore
wealth
has
increasingly
complicated
peace
negotiations
even
though
greek
cypriots
say
that
matter
is
not
up
for
discussion
