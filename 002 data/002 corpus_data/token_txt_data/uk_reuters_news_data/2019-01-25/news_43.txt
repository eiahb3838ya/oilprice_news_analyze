update 1-german energy regulator to shield power users from coal exit costs
berlin
reuters
german
consumers
must
not
be
burdened
with
higher
electricity
network
fees
when
the
country
abandons
stable
power
for
environmental
reasons
the
chief
regulator
of
power
transport
grids
said
a
coal
commission
is
tasked
with
drawing
up
a
schedule
for
the
exit
from
coal
on
friday
or
latest
building
in
compensation
for
operators
employees
and
affected
regions
in
a
process
i
consider
it
important
to
do
everything
possible
to
prevent
rising
prices
for
consumers
because
of
the
coal
exit
jochen
homann
president
of
the
bundesnetzagentur
or
federal
network
agency
said
it
is
my
job
to
ensure
that
no
unnecessary
costs
are
added
to
grid
fees
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
an
industry
conference
this
week
the
bundesnetzagentur
supervises
grid
operators
to
ensure
that
networks
are
kept
in
balance
it
also
monitors
costs
which
operators
charge
to
consumers
homann
s
concern
about
spillover
costs
is
not
given
the
government
is
keen
to
keep
all
sides
happy
in
the
coal
compromise
looking
to
spread
costs
and
limiting
burdens
on
the
general
budget
network
companies
charge
consumers
percent
of
their
final
bill
for
network
investment
and
management
these
costs
are
already
rising
because
green
energy
is
difficult
to
integrate
due
to
its
intermittent
nature
causing
high
spending
on
handling
shortfalls
and
drawing
on
reserve
plants
in
this
bill
came
to
billion
euros
billion
and
stood
at
million
in
the
first
three
quarters
of
generation
costs
could
also
rise
after
germany
quits
coal
homann
said
it
is
a
simple
economic
fact
if
coal
plants
are
taken
out
of
the
system
supply
gets
tighter
and
then
you
would
have
to
think
about
prices
going
up
and
how
to
handle
that
he
said
regarding
the
technical
challenges
homann
said
his
agency
had
factored
in
the
possibility
that
half
of
germany
s
existing
coal
plant
capacity
of
gigawatts
gw
might
close
by
of
some
km
miles
of
additional
grids
and
power
line
improvements
planned
to
accommodate
the
increase
in
renewable
installations
in
the
next
decade
only
km
have
been
approved
and
just
km
implemented
the
picture
for
plans
up
to
is
more
favorable
power
network
operators
have
completed
km
out
of
a
necessary
km
and
km
have
been
approved
