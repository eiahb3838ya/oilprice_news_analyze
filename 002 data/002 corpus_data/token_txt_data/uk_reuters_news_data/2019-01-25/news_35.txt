rotterdam

as
daan
hosli
s
hybrid
bmw
glides
into
downtown
rotterdam
it
passes
a
virtual
boundary
into
the
city
s
zone
and
his
mobile
phone
trills
out
a
reminder
to
switch
off
his
combustion
engine
and
drive
on
battery
power
hosli
is
taking
part
in
electric
city
drive
one
in
a
series
of
projects
planned
by
the
city
of
rotterdam
and
bmw
looking
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
reduce
traffic
pollution
without
breaking
the
bank
the
first
results
look
promising
said
arno
bonte
the
city
s
vice
mayor
who
oversees
energy
policies
i
hope
we
can
extend
this
project
as
soon
as
possible
also
to
owners
of
cars
by
other
participants
have
a
smartphone
app
developed
by
bmw
which
monitors
their
engine
usage
and
reminds
them
to
switch
voluntarily
to
electric
driving
when
they
hit
a
costs
to
the
city
bonte
said
are
nil
initial
results
show
participants
are
willing
to
use
battery
power
exclusively
while
in
the
zone
about
percent
of
the
time
the
netherlands
is
an
outlier
in
europe
with
relatively
more
hybrids
than
electric
vehicles
versus
together
still
just
a
small
fraction
of
the
million
vehicles
on
the
country
s
roads
but
if
you
really
want
to
make
a
difference
now
you
have
to
look
at
hybrids
said
bmw
netherlands
ceo
stefanie
wurst
that
is
because
with
european
cities
struggling
to
meet
dual
goals
of
improving
air
quality
and
reducing
greenhouse
gas
emissions
from
cars
by
percent
by
they
need
practical
ways
of
making
progress
quickly
rather
than
holding
out
for
a
distant
and
costly
entirely
electric
car
future
and
it
s
not
proving
easy
german
cities
are
angering
diesel
car
owners
by
banning
vehicles
from
some
of
their
streets
while
french
plans
for
a
fossil
fuel
surcharge
set
off
the
yellow
vests
street
protests
even
in
wealthy
norway
which
leads
the
world
in
electric
car
adoption
oslo
is
introducing
fees
for
charging
and
looking
at
ways
to
avoid
expensive
grid
upgrades
positive
stimulation
is
always
better
than
negative
sanctions
wurst
said
she
said
rotterdam
program
participants
had
responded
well
to
small
rewards
such
as
a
discount
pass
for
local
attractions
as
well
as
from
the
simple
reminder
to
switch
a
financial
incentive
to
run
hybrids
on
electricity
is
theoretically
built
in
as
electricity
is
cheaper
than
petrol
per
kilometer
traveled
vice
mayor
bonte
says
rotterdam
views
hybrids
as
a
bridge
to
mass
adoption
of
electric
vehicles
sometime
in
the
mid
as
prices
fall
and
charging
infrastructure
improves
the
city
has
granted
a
charging
station
concession
to
engie
with
the
french
company
agreeing
to
install
one
public
charging
pole
for
each
electric
or
hybrid
vehicle
owner
that
requests
one
so
far
in
a
city
of
people
though
there
are
more
in
private
buildings
and
parking
garages
but
there
s
a
long
way
to
go
according
to
a
data
provider
which
culls
information
from
national
registries
the
number
of
vehicles
capable
of
driving
on
electric
engines
across
europe
grew
by
percent
in
split
between
plug
in
hybrid
vehicles
and
vehicles
together
making
up
about
percent
of
total
new
car
sales
in
rotterdam
hosli
says
he
enjoys
the
challenge
of
trying
to
find
charging
stations
and
using
up
his
electric
battery
as
often
as
he
can
statistics
on
his
app
show
he
uses
about
liters
of
petrol
per
kilometers
of
travel
i
have
to
drive
for
work
i
can
t
avoid
that
for
me
this
is
just
a
fun
way
to
do
it
said
the
real
estate
developer
it
s
like
a
sport
for
me
to
fill
up
with
gas
as
little
as
