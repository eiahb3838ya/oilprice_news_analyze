environmental

and
previously
a
lobbyist
for

said
at
a
public
event
in
washington
that
he
supported
a
rollback
of
former
president
barack
obama
s
centerpiece
climate
change
regulation
democrats
and
environmental
activists
have
criticized
the
republican
administration
of
president
donald
trump
for
reversing
regulations
and
announcing
its
intention
to
withdraw
the
united
states
from
an
international
accord
to
fight
global
warming
i
ve
had
a
series
of
briefings
with
climate
change
experts
to
help
me
better
understand
this
wehrum
said
everybody
is
still
exploring
the
science
of
climate
wehrum
said
reducing
carbon
emissions
was
important
and
that
was
among
the
many
priorities
of
the
epa
but
added
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
smart
about
how
to
dedicate
resources
to
those
priorities
asked
if
the
epa
is
trying
to
determine
whether
climate
change
is
a
crisis
he
responded
i
m
trying
to
figure
that
out
i
ll
admit
i
did
not
come
to
the
agency
as
a
climate
change
expert
i
ll
admit
there
is
a
lot
i
don
t
understand
about
climate
change
he
said
he
added
that
he
did
not
finish
reading
the
national
climate
assessment
a
government
report
mandated
by
congress
and
written
with
the
help
of
more
than
a
dozen
government
agencies
and
departments
which
outlines
the
projected
impact
of
global
warming
on
american
society
the
report
released
late
last
year
warned
that
climate
change
would
cost
the
economy
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
by
the
end
of
the
century
hitting
everything
from
health
to
infrastructure
white
house
said
it
was
largely
based
on
the
most
extreme
wehrum
said
he
fully
supported
the
epa
rescinding
obama
s
clean
power
plan
aimed
at
limiting
carbon
emissions
from
power
plants
and
replacing
it
with
another
rule
that
places
much
of
the
power
to
regulate
carbon
into
the
hands
of
states
asked
why
the
public
should
trust
that
he
will
safeguard
their
health
given
his
former
jobs
wehrum
said
he
thought
it
was
important
that
someone
like
him
who
understood
the
law
technology
and
science
took
this
type
of
government
job
i
don
t
feel
ideological
he
said
and
added
i
feel
like
i
m
really
good
at
what
