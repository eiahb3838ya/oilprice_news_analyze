graphic-take five: time for a break? world markets themes for the week ahead
london
reuters
following
are
five
big
themes
likely
to
dominate
thinking
of
investors
and
traders
in
the
coming
week
and
the
reuters
stories
related
to
them
the
federal
reserve
convenes
its
first
monetary
policy
meeting
of
after
hiking
rates
for
a
fifth
time
in
as
many
quarters
in
december
but
while
it
has
forecast
two
more
hikes
for
the
darkening
global
economic
outlook
convulsing
stock
markets
and
a
government
shutdown
are
clouding
the
policy
picture
now
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
is
preaching
patience
with
regard
to
future
rate
increases
and
he
s
been
joined
by
two
other
governors
and
all
fed
regional
bank
presidents
but
what
happens
after
such
a
pause
interest
rate
futures
markets
currently
assign
a
roughly
percent
probability
for
a
move
above
the
current
percent
range
for
the
fed
funds
target
rate
at
any
meeting
a
year
from
now
a
rate
cut
is
almost
as
probable
as
a
rate
hike
most
previous
fed
pauses
are
associated
with
the
end
of
a
cycle
and
followed
by
a
change
in
policy
direction
yet
the
current
tightening
cycle
and
previous
two
easing
phases
have
featured
pauses
so
how
rare
would
a
rate
hike
resumption
be
after
this
newest
holding
period
in
both
the
and
cutting
cycles
the
fed
took
at
least
one
hiatus
of
six
months
or
longer
and
resumed
cuts
later
in
the
present
one
they
ve
managed
extended
pauses
twice
since
this
cycle
s
first
december
hike
a
full
year
lapsed
between
the
first
and
second
hike
six
months
between
hikes
four
and
five

central

think
hard
about
their
language
alarm
bells
from
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
are
still
ringing
in
investors
ears
after
the
fund
cut
global
growth
forecasts
warning
in
particular
that
failure
to
resolve
trade
tensions
could
further
destabilise
the
world
economy
so
markets
will
focus
on

data
due
on
thursday
and
friday
to
glean
how
the

s

is
faring
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
also
head
to
the
united
states
on
wednesday
and
thursday
with
a
delegation
for
the
next
round
of
trade
negotiations
there
are
reasons
to
be
hopeful
of
some
kind
of
agreement
even
if
commerce
secretary
wilbur
ross
said
the
two
sides
were
miles
and
miles
from
resolving
their
trade
issues
he
did
after
all
admit
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
a
deal
eventually
so
far
there
is
little
clarity
on
how
bad
it
could
get
for
china
s
and
for
the
world
economy
and
how
much
stimulus
beijing
may
be
happy
to
provide
this
time
round
china
s
obsession
with
market
stability
and
the
quality
of
credit
growth
adds
to
that
challenge
china
says
will
step
up
fiscal
spending
this
year
to
support

parliament
won
t
be
asked

and
given
the
crushing
margin
by
which
may

plan
a
was
defeated
just
a
week
ago
that
s
just
as
well
greater
focus
though
is
on
averting
a
brexit
a
scenario
in
which
the
uk
crashes
out
of
the
eu
with
no
trade
agreement
that
looks
achievable
the
opposition
and
many
ruling
party
members
will
likely
back
an
amendment
providing
for
a
extension
to
brexit
should
a
deal
not
be
agreed

sterling
could
rally
another

that
may
sound
overly
optimistic
given
the
challenges
the

still
face
risks
are
finely
balanced

have
taken
off

there
s
also
a
glimmer
of
hope
an
upbeat
forecast
from
chipmaker

a
boost
to
a
