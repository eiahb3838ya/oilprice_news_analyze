london
reuters
britain
s
public
spending
watchdog
on
friday
questioned
a
government
estimate
of
billion
pounds
as
the
cost
of
tax
relief
to
decommission
oil
and
gas
infrastructure
as
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
mature
oil
basins
britain
s
north
sea
represents
the
world
s
biggest
decommissioning
project
with
the
oil
and
gas
authority
estimating
operators
will
need
to
spend
around
billion
pounds
the
government
has
given
oil
and
gas
operators
different
kinds
of
tax
relief
designed
to
revive
investment
in
the
british
north
sea
where
oil
production
has
plummeted
from
million
barrels
per
day
in
to
around
million
tax
relief
for
decommissioning
is
designed
to
lower
the
threshold
for
potential
buyers
of
oil
fields
who
might
otherwise
balk
at
the
option
of
investing
in
limited
future
production
and
eventually
be
saddled
with
a
huge
decommissioning
bill
the
government
estimates
that
decommissioning
the
uk
s
offshore
oil
and
gas
infrastructure
will
cost
taxpayers
billion
pounds
although
the
actual
cost
is
highly
uncertain
the
national
audit
office
said
referring
the
years
until
the
final
cost
depends
on
factors
such
as
the
oil
price
foreign
exchange
rates
and
technological
progress
the
nao
found
that
there
are
gaps
in
the
government
s
understanding
of
the
costs
and
benefits
of
changes
to
the
tax
regime
hm
revenue
and
customs
has
not
historically
calculated
the
total
combined
cost
of
decommissioning
tax
reliefs
it
has
already
given
to
operators
the
nao
added
the
watchdog
which
can
give
recommendations
to
government
to
change
its
spending
did
not
do
so
in
this
case
and
when
asked
whether
the
statement
was
meant
as
a
call
to
change
the
rules
an
nao
spokesman
said
it
was
not
the
government
said
in
an
emailed
statement
in
response
to
the
nao
s
report
that
it
was
working
with
the
oil
industry
to
minimise
decommissioning
costs
by
providing
tax
relief
on
decommissioning
we
are
attracting
continued
investment
into
our
reserves
supporting
jobs
boosting
the
economy
and
protecting
our
energy
supply

government
spokesman
said
