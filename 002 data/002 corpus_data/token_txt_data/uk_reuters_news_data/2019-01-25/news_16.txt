swedish
utility
vattenfall
is
looking
for
acquisitions
in
its
efforts
to
become
one
of
europe
s
biggest
operators
of
electric
vehicle
charging
stations
its
chief
executive
said
vattenfall
currently
operates
more
than
charging
spots
across
europe
most
of
which
are
in
its
home
market
and
in
the
netherlands
joining
a
large
number
of
utility
rivals
that
all
hope
to
benefit
from
an
expected
rise
in
electric
car
sales
in
germany
where
the
group
makes
more
than
a
third
of
its
underlying
profit
and
has
more
than
million
customers
the
number
of
charging
points
stands
at
just
far
behind
local
rivals
innogy
and
enbw
what
we
are
looking
for
are
strategic
reasonable
acquisitions
that
can
really
push
us
into
a
growth
platform
or
a
technology
that
we
need

told
reuters
at
the
annual
handelsblatt
energy
conference
we
re
not
talking
about
from
a
financial
viewpoint
we
are
quite
solid
he
said
declining
to
say
how
much
cash
the
company
had
to
spend
vattenfall
which
already
cooperates
with
bmw
and
volvo
in
the
area
of
electric
charging
is
also
looking
for
further
partnerships
with
carmakers
hall
said
vattenfall
in
agreed
to
sell
its
lignite
operations
in
germany
as
part
of
a
strategic
shift
that
will
fully
wean
the
group
off
emissions
within
a
generation
still
the
company
operates
a
number
of
hard
power
plants
in
the
country
most
notably
its
megawatt
moorburg
station
moorburg
which
cost
nearly
billion
euros
billion
and
only
started
operations
in
will
likely
face
early
closure
as
part
of
a
plan
to
phase
out
coal
in
germany
details
of
which
are
expected
later
on
friday
we
think
our
moorburg
plant
should
clearly
qualify
for
the
very
last
step
of
the
phase
out
it
s
brand
new
and
very
efficient
hall
said
adding
vattenfall
was
considering
options
for
the
plant
including
biomass
experts
believe
that
germany
already
in
the
process
of
shutting
down
all
its
nuclear
power
stations
will
completely
phase
out
of
coal
between
and
vattenfall
initially
hoped
to
keep
moorburg
running
for
about
years
