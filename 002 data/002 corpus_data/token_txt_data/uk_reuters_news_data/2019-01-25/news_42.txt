the

from

a

sunil
krishnan
head
of
funds
at
aviva
investors
said
investors
were
taking
some
relief
from
the
responses
of
policymakers
what
they
investors
were
not
seeing
last
year
was
that
activity
was
slowing
but
there
was
no
reaction
from
central
banks
they
are
seeing
that
now
we
saw
that
from
the
ecb
and
the
fed
has
said
it
s
not
on
a
that
along
with
a
rebound
from
poor
liquidity
in
december
explains
why
the
risk
tone
in
markets
has
been
a
bit
better
he
said
in
a
note
to
clients
ubs
global
wealth
management
s
chief
investment
officer
mark
haefele
said
that
rhetoric
on
trade
has
become
more
positive
and
that
beijing
has
taken
steps
to
stimulate
its
economy
while
economic
and
earnings
growth
is
slowing
we
believe
it
is
unlikely
that
growth
will
drop
far
below
trend
he
said
at
the
same
time
there
are
reasons
to
be
cautious
about
policymakers
ability
to
follow
through
on
their
chinese
vice
premier
liu
he
will
visit
the
united
states
on
and
for
the
next
round
of
trade
negotiations
with
washington
the
two
sides
are
miles
and
miles
from
resolving
trade
issues
but
there
is
a
fair
chance
they
will
get
a
deal
