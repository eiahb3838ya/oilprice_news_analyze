analysis-tunnel exposes deep conflict in italy's populist government
france
reuters
italy
s
movement
and
league
party
were
rivals
going
into
last
year
s
national
election
became
coalition
partners
in
a
populist
government
afterwards
and
now
an
alpine
rail
tunnel
threatens
to
tear
them
apart
the
dispute
over
whether
to
forge
ahead
with
one
of
europe
s
most
ambitious
engineering
projects
is
rooted
in
the
divergent
nature
of
the
two
parties
and
highlights
their
conflicting
visions
for
italy
s
future
the
league
wants
the
tunnel
to
go
ahead
as
do
of
italians
according
to
an
emg
acqua
poll
last
week
on
the
other
hand
more
than
half
of
s
and
environmentally
friendly
supporters
oppose
it
it
s
striking
because
they
are
two
populist
forces
with
two
very
different
groups
of
people
supporting
them
said
lorenzo
pregliasco
a
founder
of
youtrend
a
political
consultancy
based
in
turin
the
northwestern
city
where
trains
are
supposed
to
arrive
from
france
after
passing
through
the
tunnel
a
boring
machine
nicknamed
federica
is
already
working
around
the
clock
more
than
metres
feet
below
ground
on
the
french
side
of
the
border
even
though
rome
is
threatening
to
pull
the
plug
as
it
reviews
the
project
the
tunnel
is
stoking
tension
within
the
coalition
because
of
regional
and
european
elections
in
may
which
could
reverse
the
balance
of
power
within
the
coalition
and
destabilise
a
government
that
manages
one
of
the
world
s
largest
debts
which
is
closely
monitored
by
financial
markets
polls
foresee
the
league
surging
above
which
has
already
compromised
on
other
major
battles
in
recent
months
but
appears
not
to
want
to
give
ground
on
the
billion
pounds
tunnel
transport
minister
and
member
danilo
toninelli
told
reuters
a
decision
would
come
before
the
elections
and
bigwig
alessandro
di
battista
said
the
project
was
idiocy
in
december
italy
agreed
with
france
to
freeze
new
contracts
on
the
km
tunnel
until
completion
of
an
italian
analysis
by
a
panel
of
experts
which
toninelli
has
said
should
be
published
by
the
end
of
the
month
if
the
analysis
says
that
we
re
throwing
away
money
only
a
madman
would
move
forward
leader
luigi
di
maio
said
on
monday
however
it
might
not
prove
so
easy
to
kill
the
project
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
mount
cenis
moncenisio
geothermal
energy
heats
the
air
to
about
degrees
fahrenheit
with
a
force
equal
to
the
power
of
eight
formula
engines
boring
machine
federica
rumbles
and
shakes
as
she
cuts
into
rock
advancing
as
much
as
metres
per
day
so
far
the
joint
french
and
italian
company
the
tunnel
euralpin
lyon
turin
telt
has
dug
more
than
miles
km
inside
the
mountain
including
four
access
tunnels
and
about
miles
km
of
one
of
the
two
main
passageways
some
people
are
employed
either
directly
or
indirectly
telt
says
and
that
number
will
balloon
to
if
and
when
work
reaches
full
capacity
those
in
favour
of
the
project
known
in
italy
as
the
tav
say
the
costs
of
shutting
it
down
with
km
miles
already
dug
could
equal
those
of
finishing
it
you
can
t
turn
off
the
boring
machine
leave
it
there
and
walk
away
said
piergiuseppe
gilli
telt
s
chief
of
construction
who
has
worked
on
the
project
for
years
the
european
union
is
picking
up
percent
of
the
cost
which
could
increase
to
percent
because
it
is
part
of
a
mediterranean
corridor
meant
to
link
rail
yards
and
ports
from
spain
to
the
ukrainian
border
with
hungary
french
transport
minister
elizabeth
borne
has
emphasised
the
geostrategic
importance
of
the
project
saying
it
must
not
lose
eu
funding
deputy
prime
minister
matteo
salvini
who
is
also
leader
of
the
league
expressed
his
categorical
support
for
it
on
friday
the
tav
absolutely
must
be
done
it
would
cost
more
not
to
do
it
than
to
do
supporters
of
the
rail
link
have
staged
two
large
rallies
in
recent
months
in
turin
which
is
about
miles
km
from
the
french
border
local
league
politicians
attended
the
demonstrations
it
would
improve
italy
s
links
to
other
european
countries
and
permit
faster
movement
of
passengers
and
goods
turin
resident
salvatore
bellomo
said
in
the
city
s
central
square
this
project
would
bring
italy
into
the
in
the
past
the
movement
which
is
also
supported
by
activists
has
frequently
clashed
with
police
and
after
death
threats
two
of
telt
s
top
managers
are
under
armed
guard
the
argument
makes
against
the
project
is
that
it
is
a
huge
waste
of
public
money
and
a
potential
health
concern
for
people
who
live
near
the
italian
work
site
where
some
of
the
rock
dust
could
release
asbestos
into
the
air
the
money
would
be
better
spent
on
italy
s
existing
infrastructure
which
is
crumbling
says
citing
the
collapse
of
a
motorway
bridge
in
august
that
killed
people
the
flow
of
goods
is
not
expected
to
be
large
enough
to
justify
public
works
of
these
dimensions
said
angelo
tartaglia
a
retired
professor
at
turin
s
polytechic
university
it
would
not
be
profitable
and
what
s
worse
is
the
maintenance
costs
would
be
higher
than
the
tunnel
s
tartaglia
is
on
a
committee
of
experts
formed
by
the
turin
mayor
chiara
appendino
after
she
became
one
of
the
first
heads
of
a
major
italian
city
in
the
fight
against
the
tunnel
dates
back
to
a
time
when
it
was
still
trying
to
make
its
name
known
and
the
party
s
founder
comic
beppe
grillo
was
calling
for
an
environmentally
friendly
economic
model
based
on
happy
negative
growth
but
being
in
government
has
forced
to
shed
some
of
its
identity
the
movement
has
already
relented
on
promises
to
close
the
ilva
steel
plant
or
shut
down
construction
of
a
gas
pipeline
from
albania
these
kind
of
reality
checks
are
part
of
the
nature
of
this
government
consultant
pregliasco
said
referring
to
ilva
and
the
pipeline
the
difference
with
the
tunnel
is
its
higher
symbolic
value
