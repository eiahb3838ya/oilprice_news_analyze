sydney
reuters
a
prominent
chinese
businessman
and
political
donor
linked
in
the
past
to
a
row
about
the
promotion
of
chinese
interests
said
on
friday
australia
s
decision
to
rescind
his
visa
was
based
on
nothing
more
than
speculation
huang
xiangmo
is
unable
to
return
to
australia
after
the
government
rejected
his
application
for
citizenship
and
revoked
his
visa
while
he
was
overseas
newspaper
reports
said
this
week
australian
media
citing
unidentified
sources
said
huang
was
denied
residency
after
intelligence
agencies
concluded
he
could
undertake
acts
of
foreign
interference
and
that
he
was
unfit
for
residency
huang
rejected
that
assessment
and
criticised
australia
in
his
first
public
comments
since
the
visa
cancellation
was
revealed
it
is
profoundly
disappointing
to
be
treated
in
such
a
grotesquely
unfair
manner
the
decision
to
cancel
my
visa
was
based
on
unfounded
speculations
that
are
prejudiced
and
groundless
huang
told
the
australian
financial
review
there
are
many
australian
companies
in
china
aren
t
they
more
likely
to
be
susceptible
to
potential
manipulation
by
the
chinese
government
he
said
representatives
for
australia
s
department
of
home
affairs
and
a
spokeswoman
for
minister
for
immigration
david
coleman
did
not
respond
immediately
to
requests
for
comment
china
s
foreign
ministry
in
a
short
statement
read
over
the
telephone
to
reuters
said
it
did
not
know
anything
about
the
issue
but
that
china
never
interferes
in
the
internal
affairs
of
other
countries
huang
s
expulsion
comes
as
australia
and
china
seek
to
repair
ties
that
have
been
strained
since
when
canberra
accused
beijing
of
meddling
in
its
domestic
affairs
china
denies
the
accusation
huang
emerged
as
one
of
australia
s
biggest
political
donors
soon
after
he
began
living
in
australia
he
rose
to
prominence
after
an
influential
opposition
lawmaker
was
forced
to
resign
in
when
allegations
emerged
that
he
was
linked
to
interests
the
lawmaker
sam
dastyari
sought
to
encourage
a
senior
politician
not
to
meet
a
chinese
activist
opposed
to
beijing
s
rule
in
hong
kong
in
dastyari
was
also
recorded
warning
huang
that
his
phone
may
be
tapped
huang
stopped
political
donations
after
that
incident
but
later
expanded
his
business
interests
in
australia
he
paid
nearly
a
billion
million
in
for
two
australian
projects
owned
by
chinese
conglomerate
