from
universities

the
hackers
were
not
accused
of
being
directly
employed
by
iran
s
government
they
were
instead
charged
with
criminal
conduct
waged
primarily
through
the
mabna
institute
on
behalf
of
the
islamic
revolutionary
guard
corps
the
elite
military
force
assigned
to
defend
iran
s
shi
ite
theocracy
from
internal
and
external
threats
in
tehran
iran
s
foreign
ministry
spokesman
bahram
qasemi
denounced
the
move
as
provocative
illegitimate
and
without
any
justifiable
reason
and
another
sign
of
the
hostility
of
the
ruling
circles
towards
the
iranian
nation
state
news
agency
irna
said
the
targeting
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
or
ferc
was
a
matter
of
special
concern
attorney
geoffrey
berman
said
because
it
oversees
the
interstate
regulation
of
energy
and
holds
details
of
some
of
the
country
s
most
sensitive
hackers
targeted
email
accounts
of
more
than
professors
worldwide
half
in

and
compromised
about

also
targeted
the
labor
department
the
united
nations
and
the
computer
systems
of
the
states
hawaii
and
indiana
prosecutors
said
friday
s
actions
are
part
of
an
effort
by
senior
cyber
security
officials
at
the
white
house
and
across
the
government
to
blame
foreign
countries
for
malicious
hacks
they
were
announced
a
day
after
president
donald
trump
named
john
bolton
a
former
ambassador
to
the
united
nations
who
is
deeply
sceptical
of
the
international
nuclear
accord
with
iran
as
his
new
national
security
adviser
trump
himself
has
repeatedly
cast
doubt
on
the
nuclear
deal
in
which
the
and
other
world
powers
eased
sanctions
in
exchange
for
tehran
putting
limits
on
its
nuclear
programme
the
department
of
justice
on
friday
privately
warned
major
internet
infrastructure
companies
to
expect
attacks
from
iran
an
executive
at
one
company
who
received
the
alert
said
the
officials
said
the
most
likely
retaliation
would
be
denial
of
service
attacks
on
websites
which
are
not
destructive
but
disrupt
commerce
and
communication
britain
s
national
cyber
security
centre
said
on
twitter
the
mabna
institute
was
almost
certainly
responsible
for
cyber
attacks
targeting
universities
around
the
the
sanctions
and
charges
were
the
fourth
time
in
the
past
few
months
the
trump
administration
has
blamed
a
foreign
government
for
major
cyber
attacks
a
practice
that
was
rare
under
the
obama
administration
last
week
the
administration
accused
the
russian
government
of
cyber
attacks
stretching
back
at
least
two
years
that
targeted
the
power
grid
washington
imposed
new
sanctions
on
russians
and
five
groups
including
moscow

intelligence
services
for
meddling
in
the

and
other
cyber

in

said
the
iranian
hackers
did
extensive
background
research
of
university
professors
before
sending
them
spearphishing
emails
tailored
to
academic
interests
and
scholarly
publications
the
emails
purported
to
be
from
professors
at
another
university
and
indicated
the
sender
had
read
an
article
written
by
them
prosecutors
said
the
emails
would
then
direct
recipients
to
click
on
links
to
related
articles
directing
them
to
a
malicious
internet
domain
that
appeared
similar
to
the
victims
actual
university
portal
where
they
would
be
prompted
to
enter
their
login
credentials
once
accounts
were
compromised
the
hackers
would
steal
reams
of
academic
data
and
intellectual
property
related
to
science
and
technology

the

guard
and
sold
in

and
gigapaper
to
universities

included
two
media

entertainment
companies
one

firm
technology
firms
and
two

investment

among
others
unlike
the
precise

subjected
to
a
broad
technique
known
as

that
uncovers
lists
of
company
email
accounts
online
and
then
tries
to
hack
into
them
with
common
default
passwords
once
inside

the
