reuters
trade
flow
data
show
for
years
canadian
officials
have
pushed
for
an
escalation
in
crude
exports
to
rapidly
growing
asian
markets
but
companies
in
alberta
have
limited
capacity
to
move
crude
to
the
nation
s
western
coastline
that
makes
canadian
crude
exports
from
vancouver
to
asia
rare
but
shipments
have
picked
up
in
recent
months
with
oil
tankers
to
china
thailand
and
south
korea
departing
in
april
and
july
most
of
the
crude
shipped
from
vancouver
which
has
limited
export
capacity
is
carried
to
the

an

the

is
scheduled
to
arrive
in
guangdong
a
southern
chinese
province
on
july
bringing
canadian
exports
to
china
to
barrels
per

bpd
for
the
month
the
voyage
follows
that
of
the
solomon

which
in
april
left
vancouver
for
ports
in
thailand
and
south
korea
another
tanker
diva
departed
vancouver
for
zhejiang
in
eastern
china
the
same
month
they
carried
a
combined
barrels
to
asian
buyers
according
to
thomson
reuters
data
the
spread
has
narrowed
and
there
s
less
call
for
crude

there
is
an
opportunity
for
canada
to
send
material
to
china
but
i
don
t
think
demand
is
going
to
be
in
another
rare
asian
transaction
earlier
this
month
the
shenlong
spirit
carried
barrels
from
alaska
s
petrostar
refinery
to
china
the
first
oil
export
from
alaska
to
china
since
may
separately
two
vessels
loaded
with
million
barrels
left
texas
for
japan
earlier
this
month
the
biggest
shipments
since
december
as
oil
companies
fear
chinese
tariffs
on
crude
and
as
gulf
coast
ports
become
more
efficient
at
loading
very
large
crude
carriers
known
as
vlccs
which
can
carry
roughly
million
barrels
of
oil
exports
will
go
into
more
and
more
markets
in
asia
