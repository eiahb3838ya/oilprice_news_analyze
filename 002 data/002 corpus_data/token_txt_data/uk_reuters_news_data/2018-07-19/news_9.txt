people
close
to
the
matter
said
state
grid
last
week
made
a
final
offer
worth
just
below
billion
euros
million
for
a
percent
stake
in
the
company
that
australian
infrastructure
fund
ifm
had
put
on
the
block
they
said
while
no
other
suitor
participated
in
the
final
round
of
bidding
german
state
bank
kfw
is
still
poised
to
pocket
the
stake
due
to
the
right
of
first
refusal
held
by
belgian
majority
shareholder
elia
they
said
highly
indebted
elia
is
expected
to
draw
the
right
by
a
july
deadline
and
then
sell
the
stake
on
to
kfw
they
added
the
deal
is
as
good
as
done
one
of
the
people
said
germany
s
economy
ministry
declined
to
comment
while
state
grid
and
elia
were
not
immediately
available
for
comment
a
final
decision
is
expected
to
be
taken
at
elia
s
board
meeting
the
people
said
germany
views
as
part
of
its
crucial
infrastructure
and
has
asked
chinese
officials
to
understand
this
another

said
referring
to
meetings
earlier
this
month
chinese
premier
li
keqiang
and
german
chancellor
angela
merkel
discussed
in
berlin
the
two
countries
economic
ties
reiterating
commitments
to
a
multilateral
global
trade
order
german
economy
minister
peter
altmaier
however
had
said
in
june
that
he
saw
a
problem
in
letting
critical
infrastructure
fall
into
the
hands
of
investors
whose
motivation
and
background
were
not
clear
citing
as
an
example
in
march
elia
exercised
its
right
to
buy
a
first
percent
stake
in
the
network
operator
for
million
euros
billion
beating
state
grid
which
had
already
negotiated
the
planned
purchase
sources
familiar
with
the
situation
said
elia
lacked
the
financial
firepower
for
a
second
large
transaction
they
added
that
kfw
was
likely
eventually
to
hand
the
investment
on
to
an
investor
deemed
suitable
german
politicians
have
viewed
state
grid
s
interest
in
critically
amid
fears
that
china
was
taking
control
of
key
technologies
while
protecting
its
own
companies
against
foreign
takeovers
ifm
and
elia
bought
from
swedish
utility
vattenfall
in
for
million
euros
meaning
ifm
was
able
to
sell
a
percent

six
times

amount
it
paid
