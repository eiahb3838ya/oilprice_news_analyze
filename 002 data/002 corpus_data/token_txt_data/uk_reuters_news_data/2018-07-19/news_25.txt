refocusing
its
trading
arm
s
activities
on
lng
and
its
new
turkish
refinery
while
winding
down
less
profitable
trades
as
it
feels
the
sting
of
weak
profits
sources
familiar
with
the
matter
said
many
trading
houses
had
weaker
performances
in
due
to
a
less
lucrative
backwardated
market
structure
for
much
of
the
year
and
relatively
low
volatility
socar
trading
also
was
stung
costing
its
chief
executive
arzu
azimov
his
job
the
firm
was
set
up
in

has
become
a
global
player

the
last
few
years

a
marketer
of

poaching
top
traders
from
established
rivals
it
moved
into
paper
trading
and
oil
at
the
end
of
may
executive

adnan
ahmadzada
was
appointed
and
the
ceo
role
was
taken
by
mariam
almaszade
formerly

the

barrels
per

the
sources
said
at
least
four
traders
in
the
heavy
distillates
division
have
left
including
manager
pino
petricone
the
sources
said
adding
impetus
is
an
upcoming
change
in
shipping
fuels
in
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
ban
ships
using
fuel
with
a
sulphur
content
higher
than
percent
compared
to
percent
now
unless
a
vessel
has
equipment
to
clean
up
its
sulphur
emissions
the
industry
expects
demand
for
fuel
oil
to
plummet
as
few
ships
have
such
equipment

has
previously
grappled
with
some

part
of
its
investment
in
an
project
in
malta
it
is
studying
several

in
africa
and
asia
and
plans
to
increase
its

looking
forward
the
firm
may
beef
up
products
trading
once
more
after
its
star
refinery
in
turkey
starts
up
including
a
return
to
