that
saudi

for

a
strategic
stake
in

basic
industries
corp
sabic
citing
two
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
the
size
of
the
stake
aramco
is
interested
in
acquiring
is
not
known
aramco
said
it
had
been
evaluating
a
number
of
acquisition
opportunities
both
local
and
global
in
line
with
its
strategy
of
rebalancing
its
portfolio
by
moving
further
into
downstream
particularly
the
petrochemical
sector
in
a
separate
statement
the
pif
said
that
talks
on
a
sale
were
in
the
early
stages
there
is
a
possibility
that
no
agreement
will
be
reached
in
relation
to
this
potential
transaction
the
pif
said
aramco
wants
to
develop
its
downstream
business
as
the
government
prepares
to
sell
up
to
percent
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
possibly
by
next
year
boosting
its
petrochemicals
portfolio
further
could
help
attract
investors
for
the
ipo
shares
in
sabic
the
largest
listed
company
in
the
gulf
were
down
by
percent
at
gmt
on
thursday
aramco
invited
the
banks
to
pitch
for
a
potential
sabic
deal
last
month
the
sources
told
reuters
on
wednesday
declining
to
be
identified
due
to
commercial
sensitivities
the
aramco
ipo
is
the
centrepiece
of
an
ambitious
plan
championed
by
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
to
diversify
saudi
arabia
s
economy
beyond
oil
prince
mohammed
has
said
the
ipo
will
value
aramco
at
a
minimum
of
trillion
although
some
analysts
estimates
are
between
trillion
and
trillion
preparations
for
the
ipo
which
may
be
the
biggest
in
history
have
slowed
with
some
sources
close
to
the
process
say
the
plans
for
a
domestic
and
international
listing
might
be
pushed
further
into
next
year
or
even
beyond
a
final
decision
has
yet
to
be
made
by
prince
mohammed
who
oversees
the
kingdom
s
economic
and
oil
policies
the
sources
said
the
complexity
of
the
listing
legal
worries
and
conflicting
recommendations
from
different
advisers
have
delayed
they
added
the
decision
by
prince
mohammed
is
pending
said
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
the
ipo
process
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
said
last
month
it
would
be
nice
to
see
aramco
floated
in
adding
the
timing
was
not
critical
to
the
government
aramco
plans
to
boost
investments
in
refining
and
petrochemicals
to
secure
new
markets
for
its
crude
and
sees
growth
in
chemicals
as
central
to
its
downstream
strategy
to
lessen
the
risk
of
a
slowdown
in
oil
demand
the
oil
giant
is
expanding
its
footprint
globally
by
signing
downstream
deals
and
boosting
the
capacity
of
its
plants
aramco
s
push
into
chemicals
includes
a
it
is
building
at
home
with
sabic
the
billion
project
would
be
to
build
a
complex
that
converts
crude
oil
into
chemicals
directly
bypassing
the
refining
stage
