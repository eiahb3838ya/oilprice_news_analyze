refiners
ran
in
the
second
quarter
fueled
by
cheap
domestic
crude
and
fat
margins
that
should
boost
earnings
though
their
heavy
activity
could
eventually
saturate
the
market
with
gasoline
sapping
profits
down
the
road
independent
refiners
including
phillips
and
marathon
petroleum
corp
are
expected
to
announce
strong
results
due
to
the
heavy
discounts
for
and
canadian
crude
along
with
strong
fuel
demand
and
lower
costs
to
comply
with
the
nation
s
biofuel
laws
analysts
said
strong
crack
spreads
the
margin
on
turning
crude
oil
into
diesel
gasoline
and
other
products
have
spurred
refiners
to
keep
production
high
that
margin
averaged
about
per
barrel
in
the

its
highest
since

refinery

hit
their

levels
since

as
they
processed

amounts
of

in

according

high

justin
jenkins
lead
refining
analyst
at
raymond
james
in
houston
said
the
outlook
is
a
tale
of
two
stories
analysts
said
gasoline
inventories
have
swelled
amid
high
runs
and
tepid
demand
growth
which
will
hurt
the
margin
for
further
processing
of
gasoline
however
stockpiles
of
distillates
which
include
diesel
and
heating
oil
have
sunk
below
lows
this
summer
amid
surprising
domestic
demand
and
continued
pull
from
latin
america
as
the
winter
approaches
the
traditional
season
for
heating
oil
demand
that
could
again
help
refining
margins
it
s
going
to
be
a
real
tug
of
war
the
higher
price
of
diesel
versus
a
weakening
gasoline
market
zachary
rogers
a
refining
analyst
at
wood
mackenzie
said
refiners
have
already
begun
switching
yields
to
distillates
to
chase
margins
despite
being
in
the
heart
of
the
busy
summer
driving
season
rogers
said
however
they
can
only
alter
their
yield
by
a
few
percent
particularly
because
refiners
are
flush
with
light
crude
that
produces
naphtha
rogers
said
refiners
such
as
delek
us
holdings
inc
and
hollyfrontier
which
source
a
majority
of
their
crude
from
the
permian
and
are
capable
of
processing
mostly
light
sweet
crude
stand
to
benefit
from
cheap
feedstock
gasoline
days
of
supply
stood
at
days
last
week
just
shy
of
the
highest
on
record
for
this
time
of
year
eia
data
showed
overall
inventories
are
percent
above
the
historical
average
data
shows
refiners
may
have
to
consider
more
dramatic
measures
such
as
refinery
run
cuts
if
gasoline
inventory
does
not
clear
out
at
the
same
time
distillate
inventories
are
at
their
lowest
seasonally
since
and
about
percent
below
the
same
time
last
year
