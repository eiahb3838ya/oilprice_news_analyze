releasing
crude
oil
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
in
response
to
a
rise
in
prices
resulting
from
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
would
be
a
mistake
and
ultimately
the
spr
has
sufficient
crude
to
offset
any
loss
of
exports
from
iran
for
many
months
especially
if
stock
releases
are
combined
with
increased
oil
production
by
saudi
arabia
and
other
members
of
opec
the
statutes
governing
the
operation
of
the
spr
grant
the
president
broad
discretion
to
order
a
drawdown
and
any
order
is
unlikely
to
be
constrained
by
congress
or
the
courts
but
the
spr
was
established
to
deal
with
interruptions
of
crude
supplies
and
is
not
suited
to
managing
changes
in
the
supply
situation
in
particular
if
the
purpose
is
to
relieve
upward
pressure
on
prices
it
would
blunt
the
signal
needed
to
help
the
market
adapt
to
sanctions
if
the
spr
release
succeeded
in
holding
down
prices
it
would
discourage
the
rise
in
production
needed
to
replace
lost
iranian
barrels
while
allowing
rapid
consumption
growth
to
remain
unchecked
deploying
the
spr
to
manage
a
loss
of
iranian
oil
supplies
would
ultimately
prove
and
deplete
the
reserve
if
pursued
for
any
length
of
time

system

can
even
out

the

according

the

is
actively
assessing
whether
to
dip
into
the

it
simultaneously
pushes
other

boost

a

being
considered

increased

fails
to
avert
another
sharp
increase

the
journal

the

broad

to

is

conditions
set
out
in

they
are

vaguely
that
the

almost
complete
flexibility
congress

the
courts
have
traditionally
deferred

on
national
security
so
it
is
unlikely
either

constrain
a
drawdown

twice
ordered
emergency
drawdowns

to
the

the

if
the
administration
determines
that
a
release
of

from

would
be
advantageous
for

or
political
reasons
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the

from

in
the

the
spr
s
formidable
size
makes
it
a
significant
deterrent
to
oil
import

and
a
key
tool
of
foreign
policy
according
to
the
department
of
energy
s
website
the
reserve
contains
around
million
barrels
of
crude
down
from
a
peak
of
million
barrels
in
january
mostly
as
a
result
of
sales
even
so
the

holds
enough
crude
to
cover

net

requirements
for
more
than

which
provides
a

security
import
cover
has
continued
to
climb
in
recent
years
even
as
the
number
of
barrels
in
storage
has
fallen
slightly
thanks
to
the
shale
revolution
oil
production
has
risen
and
net
crude
imports
have
fallen
from
almost
million
barrels
per
day
in
to
million
bpd
in
as
a
result
the
spr
s
import

has
climbed
from
a
recent
low
of
just

at
the
end

and

at
the

to
days
at
the

of
some

the

holds
more

security
reasons
doe
needs
to
strengthen
its
approach
to
planning
the
future
of

gao
june
in
these
circumstances
the
president
could
easily
direct
the
release
of
million
million
or
even
million
barrels
without
compromising
its
ability
to
meet
future
supply
shortages
releasing
million
barrels
would
be
enough
to
offset
the
complete
loss
of
iranian
exports
for
more
than
a
month
assuming
some
exports
continued
saudi
arabia
boosted
its
own
production
and
spr
releases
were
matched
by
other
iea
members
a
drawdown
could
make
up
for
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
for
many
months
the
spr
contains
enough
crude
to
enable
the
united
states
to
enforce
a
total
or
partial
oil
blockade
against
iran
for
at
least
six
to
months
and
perhaps
longer
while
trying
to
limit
the
rise
in
oil
prices
in
theory
the
united
states
could
try
to
cut
off
iran
s
oil
exports
partially
or
completely
while
ensuring
global
oil
supplies
remained
unchanged
policymakers
appear
to
be
exploring
this
option
if
recent
briefings
given
to
journalists
are
anything
to
go
by
it
is
consistent
with
the
president
s
repeated
public
messages
on
twitter
and
television
calling
on
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
to
increase
production
it
would
facilitate
the
trump
administration
s
policy
of
maximum
pressure
against
iran
while
trying
to
avoid
an
economically
and
politically
damaging
spike
in
prices
the
administration
is
likely
to
be
especially
sensitive
to
the
political
fallout
with
congressional
elections
due
on
but
the
problem
with
employing
the
spr
to
manipulate
prices
is
that
it
will
create
growing
distortion
in
the
global
market
using
the
spr
to
hold
down
prices
at
a
point
in
the
cycle
when
they
need
to
rise
to
boost
production
and
restrain
consumption
growth
will
ultimately
add
to
volatility
releasing
the
spr
might
have
some
value
as
economic
shock
and
awe
especially
if
the
number
of
barrels
offered
for
sale
was
large
however
like
every
other
attempt
to
manipulate
the
market
employing
the
spr
to
manage
oil
prices
is
unlikely
to
be
successful
in
the
medium
term
it
might
have
a
calming
effect
allowing
the
administration
to
subject
iran
to
an
intense
economic
siege
for
several
months
in
the
hope
tehran
buckles
under
the
pressure

any
