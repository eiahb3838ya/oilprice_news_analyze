russia
used
stocks
held
in
tanks
at
its
oilfields
to
help
boost
crude
production
in
june
three
industry
sources
told
reuters
in
a
sign
of
supply
flexibility
as
opec
kingpin
saudi
arabia
pushes
other
major
producers
to
increase
spare
output
capacity
russian
oil
production
last
month
rose
by
around
barrels
per
day
from
may
from
july
the
country
s
average
oil
output
was
million
bpd
an
increase
of
bpd
from
may
two
industry
sources
said
saudi
arabia
increased
its
oil
output
by
bpd
in
june
from
may
pumping
an
average
of
million
bpd
and
selling
even
more
with
some
of
that
supply
coming
from
storage
opec
sources
told
reuters
the
difference
between
the
two
countries
numbers
lies
in
the
scale
and
sustainability
of
the
increase
thanks
to
the
geological
structure
of
saudi
fields
producer
saudi
aramco
can
quickly
add
and
cut
supply
such
adjustments
are
harder
to
perform
in
russia
where
oilfields
and
production
equipment
in
siberia
for
example
are
beset
by
freezing
temperatures
but
the
country
does
have
some
flexibility
thanks
to
spare
capacity
in
the
transneft
pipeline
system
and
in
oil
tanks
at
fields
sources
say
oil
production
has
restarted
so
quickly
thanks
to
stocks
in
reservoirs
tanks
in
western
siberia
they
belong
both
to
transneft
and
to
the
oil
companies
a
senior
oil
executive
told
reuters
another
oilman
and
an
industry
source
confirmed
that
russian
oil
companies
had
boosted
production
partially
thanks
to
their
stocks
they
did
not
say
how
much
of
june
s
increase
came
from
stocks
according
to
the
sources
and
an
analyst
russia
has
around
bpd
in
spare
capacity
that
can
be
used
to
stock
oil
last
month
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
producers
led
by
russia
agreed
to
ease
global
output
cuts
adding
around
million
bpd
to
the
market
from
july
of
that
increase
moscow
promised
to
contribute
bpd
under
an
agreement
that
took
effect
at
the
start
of
russia
s
initial
cut
was
bpd
in
may
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
he
was
concerned
about
possible
shortages
of
spare
crude
output
capacity
we
certainly
don
t
feel
we
are
where
we
need
to
be
with
complete
market
stability
falih
said
transneft
s
system
can
hold
around
million
tonnes
of
stocks
equal
to
about
days
of
russian
crude
production
according
to
the
pipeline
monopoly
but
much
of
that
capacity
is
needed
for
pumping
and
mixing
different
types
of
crude
sources
say
estimating
that
only
a
third
can
be
used
for
stockpiling
oil
igor
dyomin
an
adviser
to
transneft
s
president
said
in
emailed
comments
to
reuters
that
the
company
s
inventory
capacity
was
not
used
for
oil
storage
the
inventories
capacity
of
transneft
is
not
used
for
storage
of
oil
including
from
the
oil
companies
it
is
a
part
of
the
system
which
ensures
the
technological
process
of
seamless
oil
and
oil
products
transportation
from
the
producers
to
the
consumers
he
said
for
the
past
three
years
these
volumes
have
been
alternating
insignificantly
on
a
monthly
basis
and
are
not
related
to
the
production
curbs
within
the
deal
with
opec
dyomin
said
another
two
industry
sources
said
russian
oil
firms
combined
had
storage
facilities
with
a
capacity
of
around
million
tonnes
located
at
their
fields
these
facilities
house
the
mixture
of
mostly
water
and
oil
that
producers
extract
from
the
ground
given
that
many
oilfields
in
western
siberia
have
significant
water
content
such
storage
can
stockpile
million
tonnes
of
pure
crude
oil
according
to
estimates
by
mikhail
sheybe
an
analyst
with
sberbank
cib
this
brings
total
spare
capacity
to
as
much
as
million
tonnes
of
oil
equal
to
bpd
in
june
russian
average
oil
output
exceeded
million
bpd
for
the
first
time
since
april
saudi
arabia
by
its
own
estimates
has
million
bpd
of
spare
capacity
that
could
be
deployed
to
help
compensate
for
falling
output
in
venezuela
and
iran
one
source
said
russia
s
oil
storage
was
overloaded
by
the
time
moscow
negotiated
an
easing
of
global
production
cuts
with
saudi
arabia
and
other
nations
the
covers
on
tanks
had
been
torn
off
at
many
oil
production
sites
that
source
said
not
all
of
the
increase
in
russian
supply
came
from
storage
as
oil
companies
were
ramping
up
production
following
the
easing
of
output
curbs
the
sources
said
they
did
not
provide
a
breakdown
or
identify
the
companies
according
to
analysts
top
russian
oil
producer
rosneft
was
believed
to
be
able
to
restore
bpd
of
output
in
just
two
days
gazprom
neft
promised
half
of
that
lukoil
russia
s
oil
producer
has
increased
output
by
bpd
chief
executive
vagit
alekperov
said
on
wednesday
thanks
to
what
he
said
was
the
restart
of
previously
suspended
wells
