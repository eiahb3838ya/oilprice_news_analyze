from
new
zealand
to
the
united
states
and
kenya
to
colombia
scientists
are
on
a
mission
to
fight
global
warming
by
making
livestock
less
gassy
livestock
are
responsible
for
about
percent
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions
according
to
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organisation
fao
according
to
calculations
by
some
experts
this
puts
the
livestock
sector
on
par
with
transport
the
s
intergovernmental
panel
on
climate
change
says
transport
is
responsible
for
percent
of
emissions
ruminants
such
as
cattle
buffalo
sheep
and
goats
produce
nitrous
oxide
carbon
dioxide
and
methane
which
is
the
most
emitted
gas
and
is
released
through
belching
scientists
are
working
on
ways
to
reduce
those
emissions
including
by
breeding
animals
that
burp
less
adjusting
their
diets
so
they
produce
less
methane
and
planting
trees
in
pastures
we
domesticated
ruminants
over
years
ago
and
relatively
little
has
changed
it
s
time
that
got
an
upgrade
said
elizabeth
latham
of
bezoar
laboratories
her
company
is
working
on
a
type
of
probiotic
helpful
bacteria
or
yeasts
in
the
digestive
system
which
has
shown
a
percent
reduction
of
methane
emissions
in
cattle
during
research
although
less
prevalent
than
carbon
dioxide
the
main
greenhouse
gas
methane
is
more
potent
because
it
traps
times
more
heat
according
to
a
study
by
the
global
carbon
project
which
groups
climate
researchers
bezoar
s
probiotic
can
be
put
in
water
or
feed
and
even
sprinkled
on
grass

won

unilever

new
zealand
s
agresearch
has
bred
sheep
to
produce
percent
less
methane
in
a
single
sheep
a
percent
drop
maybe
not
so
significant
but
when
there
s
million
sheep
in
the
country
it
starts
to
make
a
huge
impact
said
suzanne
rowe
a
geneticist
at
the
government
institute
the
sheep
are
the
result
of
a
decade
of
research
and
they
are
also
leaner
and
grow
more
wool
she
said
the
beauty
of
breeding
the
animal
to
be
low
is
it
s
permanent
rowe
told
the
thomson
reuters
foundation
adding
the
team
is
conducting
similar
research
on
cattle
and
deer
agriculture
accounts
for
nearly
half
of
new
zealand
s
total
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
transforming
the
sector
is
key
to
meeting
the
target
of
becoming
carbon
neutral

minister
james
shaw
has
said
attempts
to
reduce
methane
emissions
from
livestock
are
not
limited
to
the
world
s
most
affluent
nations
in
india
a
national
programme
to
boost
the
milk
production
of
cows
and
buffalos
by
improving
their
diet
is
also
helping
the
environment
according
to
rajesh
sharma
senior
manager
at
the
national
dairy
development
board
nddb
the
nddb
uses
software
to
assess
the
ideal
diet
for
an
animal
based
on
its
physical
profile
and
environment
changes
usually
include
adjusting
the
feed
quantity
and
adding
mineral
supplements
the
tailored
diet
means
each
animal
produces
to
percent
less
methane
according
to
sharma
over
the
past
five
years
the
programme
has
reached
about
million
of
the
nearly
million
cows
and
buffalos
recorded
in
india
s
livestock
census
he
said
in
kenya
scientists
are
testing
various
local
grasses
to
see
if
they
improve
the
productivity
of
livestock
which
would
reduce
the
amount
of
emissions
per
kg
of
milk
meat
or
eggs
cows
are
placed
in
respiration
chambers
where
scientists
measure
the
methane
emissions
from
different
feeds
available
in
east
africa
said
lutz
merbold
senior
scientist
at
the
mazingira
centre
a
research
institution
results
are
expected
in
according
to
merbold
who
hopes
to
persuade
farmers
to
adjust
feed
practices
by
appealing
to
their
concerns
on
climate
change
if
you
have
a
cow
and
drought
hits
you
it
will
probably
survive
longer
than
a
less
cow
he
said
improvements
in
productivity
alone
could
reduce
up
to
percent
of
methane
emissions
from
livestock
globally
said
anne
mottet
fao
s
livestock
policy
officer
her
department
has
developed
a
web
application
that
allows
farmers
and
researchers
to
calculate
how
changes
in
animal
feed
may
affect
emissions
latin
american
ranchers
are
experimenting
with
silvopastoralism
planting
trees
in
pastures
where
they
absorb
greenhouse
gases
and
offset
emissions
while
restoring
degraded
soil
and
improving
biodiversity
they
can
be
different
types
of
trees
for
timber
fruit
trees
even
trees
that
animals
can
eat
said
jacobo
arango
a
researcher
at
the
international
centre
for
tropical
agriculture
as
consumers
have
become
more
environmentally
conscious
ruminants
have
been
vilified
for
their
emissions
as
well
as
the
amount
of
land
and
water
they
require
beef
farming
in
particular
has
been
heavily
criticised
as
it
accounts
for
percent
of
the
livestock
sector
s
greenhouse
gas
emissions
according
to
fao
in
a
march
report
greenpeace
warned
that
a
continued
increase
in
the
consumption
of
meat
and
dairy
could
undermine
paris
agreement
targets
to
stop
temperatures
from
rising
more
than
degrees
celsius
above
times
the
environmental
group
called
for
global
meat
and
dairy
production
and
consumption
to
be
cut
by
half
by
yet
campaigns
to
abandon
meat
sometimes
ignore
the
reality
of
farmers
in
asia
africa
and
south
america
who
depend
on
animals
for
their
health
and
livelihoods
according
to
experts
merbold
of
the
mazingira
centre
said
consumers
in
richer
countries
have
the
privilege
of
turning
away
from
diets
but
if
you
re
living
in
certain
regions
in
africa
livestock
provides
you
with
essential
nutrition
you
can
t
get
somewhere
else
he
said
the
animals
are
also
used
to
transport
water
and
plough
land
as
well
as
producing
manure
to
fertilise
crops
said
fao
s
mottet
what
is
needed
is
balance
she
said
we
have
countries
that
consume
about
kg
of
meat
per
person
each
year
in
others
