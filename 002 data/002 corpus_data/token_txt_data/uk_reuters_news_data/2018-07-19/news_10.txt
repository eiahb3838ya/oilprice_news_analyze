the
dollar
climbed
to
a
high
but
stocks
wobbled
and
metal
markets
buckled
badly
on
thursday
as
signs
that
china
was
resorting
to
stimulus
again
helped
drive
down
its
currency
asian
shares
had
struggled
following
the
moves
and
most
of
europe
was
in
the
red
as
traders
there
banked
some
of
the
gains
that
had
hoisted
the
stoxx
dax
and
france
s
to
highs
wall
street
was
also
expected
to
ease
off
highs
while
britain
s
pound
was
below
for
the
first
time
in
months
as
mixed
retail
sales
figures
added
to
constant
political
turmoil
and
wednesday
s
weak
inflation
data
the
yen
at
per
dollar
euro
at
and
most
other
european
currencies
were
all
weaker
too
instead
of
politics
though
they
fell
because
they
just
couldn
t
fend
off
the
dollar
s
latest
charge
sentiment
right
now
is
still
very
much
in
favour
of
buying
the
dollar
said

fx
strategist
manuel
oliveri
it
is
positively
correlated
with
risk
appetite
and
risk
appetite
remains
supported
by
the
earnings
season
and
there
is
a
very
strong
notion
among
clients
that
there
is
further
room
for
that
appetite
had
got
its
latest
boost
as
s
p
rose
to
its
highest
in
more
than
five
months
on
wednesday
the
dow
jones
climbed
for
a
fifth
session
and
the
faangs
group
of
big
tech
giants
hit
fresh
highs
ongoing
trade
jitters
and
developments
in
china
however
made
asia
a
different
picture
sources
told
reuters
that
china
s
central
bank
plans
to
motivate
banks
to
expand
lending
to
companies
a
proposal
that
points
to
another
shot
of
stimulus
china
s
regulator
meanwhile
said
it
would
keep
currency
markets
stable
amid
intensifying
trade
frictions
with
the
united
states
the
worries
had
pummeled
the
yuan
to
a
low
of
per
dollar
and
in
offshore
and
onshore
trade
the
shenzhen
composite
stocks
index
shed
percent
and
shanghai
composite
index
fell
percent
to
head
back
towards
a
low
it
had
set
earlier
this
month
market
players
are
looking
at
both
the
onshore
and
offshore
exchange
rate
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
people
s
bank
of
china
is
intentionally
allowing
a
weaker
yuan
said
ayako
sera
market
strategist
at
sumitomo
mitsui
trust
bank
if
the
difference
between
the
two
markets
becomes
too
big
that
could
mean
the
pboc
is
intervening
in
the
she
noted
that
although
the
spread
between
offshore
and
onshore
yuan
had
widened
recently
it
was
still
far
from
the

it
reached
during
the
chinese
financial
market

the
central
bank
was
seen
intervening
heavily
white
house
trade
adviser
peter
navarro
told
cnbc
on
thursday
that
donald
trump
s
trade
strategy
with
china
was
not
as
disruptive
as
many
describe
we
got
two
economies
that
add
up
to
around
trillion
in
annual
gdp
the
amount
of
trade
we
re
affecting
with
the
tariffs
is
a
rounding
error
compared
to
that
he
said
during
an
interview
at
the
white
house
investors
remain
unconvinced
metals
markets
were
also
in
the
firing
line
again
china
is
the
world
s
biggest
consumer
of
most
industrial
metals
so
worries
about
its
economy
can
have
a
serious
impact
copper
and
nickel
were
both
down
over
percent
on
london
s
metal
exchange
zinc
was
down
more
