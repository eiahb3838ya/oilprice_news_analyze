two
weeks
of
talks
to

political
divisions
at
the
most
important
meeting
on
global
warming
since
the
landmark
paris
deal
to
shift
away
from
fossil
fuels
expectations
are
low
that
negotiations
in
katowice
at
the
heart
of
poland
s
coal
region
will
be
sufficient
to
address
concerns
laid
out
in
reports
over
recent
weeks
on
the
severity
of
rising
greenhouse
gas
emissions
the
political
climate

global
unity
that
brought
about
that
accord
has

brazil
has
gone
back
on
an
earlier
promise
to
host
next

s
climate
conference
the
united
states
meanwhile
reiterated
at
the
summit
in

on
saturday
its
decision
to
withdraw
from

paris
accord
and
a
commitment
to
using
all

sources
the
other
members
of
the
group
of
industrialised
nations
including
the
biggest
polluter
china
reaffirmed
their
commitment
to
implementing
the
paris
deal
taking
into
account
their
national
circumstances
and
relative
capabilities
the
katowice
talks
precede
an
deadline
to
produce
a
rule
book
to
flesh
out
the
broad
details
that
were
agreed
in
paris
aimed
at
limiting
the
rise
in
global
temperatures
to
between
and
degrees
celsius
to
give
the
negotiations
a
better
chance
the
start
of
the
katowice
talks
was
brought
forward
by
a
day
poland
is
hosting
climate
negotiations
for
a
third
time
but
the
nation
remains
hooked
on
coal
the
most
fossil
fuel
coal
provides
about
percent
of
poland
s
power
and
has
been
a
major
source
of
employment
and
national
pride
the
younger
generation
is
less
emotionally
attached
to
coal
and
is
increasingly
environmentally
aware
though
any
phasing
out
of
the
fuel
in
poland
is
likely
to
be
slow
the
energy
ministry
said
only
last
week
that
the
country
plans
to
invest
in
new
coal
capacity
while
its
energy
strategy
assumes
it
will
still
obtain
about
percent
of
its
power
from
coal
