brought
france
to
its
knees
we

already
afraid
of
what

happen
next

the
violence
is
escalating
at
an
exponential
rate
said

a

parisians

serious
challenge
to
macron
s
presidency
macron
has
a
problem
on
his
hands
everyone
s

daubed
on
a
printemps
department
store
window
that
read
there
s
enough
money
in
the
coffers
of
businessmen

the
riches
authorities
said
violent
groups
from

the
anarchist
and
movement

insurance
companies
upmarket
private
homes
and
cafes
and
glitzy
boutiques

are
taking
a
toll
on
the
economy
on
saturday
boulevards
that
should
have
been
packed
with
tourists
and
christmas
shoppers
resembled
battle
zones
as
smoke
and
tear
gas
hung
in
the
air
and
debris
littered
the
ground
hotels
and
department
stores
in
the
capital
stand
