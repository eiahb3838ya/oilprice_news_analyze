urgent
growing
political
concerns
about
the

their

german
conservative
said
on
sunday
annegret
a
top
candidate
to
replace
chancellor
angela
merkel
as
leader
of
the
christian
democrats
told
public
broadcaster
ard
it
would
be
too
radical
to
withdraw
political
support
for
the
project
but
berlin
could
reduce
the
amount
of
gas
to
flow
through
the
pipeline
russia
is
resisting
international
calls
to
release
three
ukrainian
ships
seized
last
weekend
in
the
kerch
strait
near
the
crimea
region
that
moscow
illegally
annexed
from
ukraine
in
moscow
has
accused
the
sailors
of
illegally
crossing
the
russian
border
which
ukraine
denies
after
meeting
with
russian
president
vladimir
putin
merkel
on
saturday
called
on
russia
to
release
the
sailors
and
allow
free
shipping
access
to
the
sea
of
azov
but
stopped
short
of
endorsing
any
additional
sanctions
against
moscow
is
a
close
merkel
ally
but
has
taken
a
firmer
stance
on
russia
s
actions
in
recent
days
on
friday
she
told
reuters
the
european
union
and
the
united
states
should
consider
banning
from
their
ports
russian
ships
originating
from
the
sea
of
azov
in
response
to
the
incident
she
told
ard
on
sunday
that
it
was
time
to
draw
a
firmer
line
against
russian
actions
including
its
annexation
of
crimea
and
its
support
for
separatists
in
eastern
ukraine
we
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
hard
point
has
not
been
reached
otherwise
putin
would
not
have
taken
this
path
she
said
although
she
noted
that
russia
had
continued
to
provide
germany
with
gas
supplies
even
during
the
cold
war
her
suggestion
of
banning
russian
ships
from
european
ports
triggered
criticism
from
some
social
democrats
including
former
foreign
minister
sigmar
gabriel
who
urged
calm
and
accused
ukraine
of
trying
to
drag
germany
into
a
war
with
russia
justice
minister
katarina
barley
appearing
on
the
same
ard
programme
on
sunday
said
the
incident
still
needed
to
be
investigated
and
cautioned
against
conclusions
the
billion
nord
stream
project
led
by
russia
s
gazprom
aims
to
double
capacity
of
the
existing
nord
stream
pipeline
from
next
year
bypassing
traditional
routes
through
ukraine
businessman
friedrich
merz
the
other
top
contender
for
the
cdu
leadership
role
on
friday
said
escalating
tensions
between
russia
and
ukraine
had
renewed
debate
over
the
pipeline
the
more
the
conflict
escalates
the
more
it
raises
the
question
is
it
really
the
right
thing
that
we
build
this
pipeline
he
said
the
united
states
ukraine
and
eastern
european
states
oppose
the
pipeline
arguing
that
it
will
harm
ukraine
and
reduce
the
transit
fees
it
now
earns
for
piping
gas
washington
also
argues
that
the
pipeline
will
leave
germany
dependent
on
russia
for
decades
to
come
