paris
reuters
french
president
emmanuel
macron
ordered
his
prime
minister
on
sunday
to
hold
talks
with
political
leaders
and
demonstrators
as
he
sought
a
way
out
of
nationwide
protests
after
rioters
turned
central
paris
into
a
battle
zone
riot
police
on
saturday
were
overwhelmed
as
protesters
ran
amok
in
paris
s
wealthiest
neighbourhoods
torching
dozens
of
cars
looting
boutiques
and
smashing
up
luxury
private
homes
and
cafes
in
the
worst
disturbances
the
capital
has
seen
since
the
unrest
began
as
a
backlash
against
fuel
tax
hikes
but
has
spread
it
poses
the
most
formidable
challenge
yet
to
macron
s
presidency
with
the
escalating
violence
and
depth
of
public
anger
against
his
economic
reforms
catching
the
leader
and
battling
to
regain
control
after
a
meeting
with
members
of
his
government
on
sunday
the
french
presidency
said
in
a
statement
that
the
president
had
asked
his
interior
minister
to
prepare
security
forces
for
future
protests
and
his
prime
minister
to
hold
talks
with
political
party
leaders
and
representatives
of
the
protesters
a
french
presidential
source
said
macron
would
not
speak
to
the
nation
on
sunday
despite
calls
for
him
to
offer
immediate
concessions
to
demonstrators
and
said
the
idea
of
imposing
a
state
of
emergency
had
not
been
discussed
arriving
back
from
the
summit
in
argentina
macron
had
earlier
rushed
to
the
arc
de
triomphe
a
revered
monument
and
epicentre
of
saturday
s
clashes
where
protesters
had
scrawled
macron
resign
and
the
yellow
vests
will
triumph
the
yellow
vest
rebellion
erupted
out
of
nowhere
on
with
protesters
blocking
roads
across
france
and
impeding
access
to
some
shopping
malls
fuel
depots
and
airports
violent
groups
from
the
far
right
and
far
left
as
well
as
youths
from
the
suburbs
infiltrated
saturday
s
protests
the
authorities
said
government
spokesman
benjamin
griveaux
had
indicated
the
macron
administration
was
considering
imposing
a
state
of
emergency
the
president
was
open
to
dialogue
he
said
but
would
not
reverse
policy
reforms
we
won
t
change
course
we
are
certain
of
that
he
told
europe
radio
as
he
spoke
workmen
in
the
district
of
central
paris
set
about
cleaning
the
defaced
arc
removing
charred
hulks
of
cars
and
replacing
the
shattered
windows
of
banks
restaurants
and
glitzy
boutiques
while
the
protests
were
initially
against
macron
s
fuel
tax
hikes
necessary
he
says
to
combat
climate
change
they
have
also
mined
a
vein
of
deep
dissatisfaction
felt
towards
his
liberal
reforms
which
many
voters
feel
favour
the
wealthy
and
big
business
police
said
they
had
arrested
more
than
people
in
paris
on
saturday
and
that
were
injured
some
tear
gas
canisters
and
stun
grenades
were
fired
as
well
as
water
canon
as
security
forces
fought
for
control
macron
s
plight
illustrates
a
conundrum
how
do
political
leaders
introduce
policies
that
will
do
good
for
the
environment
without
inflicting
extra
costs
on
voters
that
may
damage
their
chances
of
his
unyielding
response
has
exposed
him
to
charges
of
being
out
of
touch
with
common
folk
outside
of
france
s
big
cities
who
worry
about
the
squeeze
on
household
budgets
and
job
security
the
protests
have
driven
macron
s
popularity
to
record
lows
and
left
him
facing
a
situation
said
gael
sliman
president
of
the
odoxa
polling
institute
said
either
macron
caves
in
to
the
pressure
and
is
derided
by
opponents
as
weak
or
he
puts
down
the
dissent
sliman
said
in
the
second
scenario
macron
will
still
come
out
loser
because
what
everyone
will
remember
is
that
he
wrestled
with
the
popular
classes
he
would
be
victorious
but
at
the
cost
of
having
crushed
before
heading
into
sunday
s
meeting
macron
met
under
heavy
security
with
police
and
firefighters
near
the
champs
elysees
boulevard
some
bystanders
cheered
others
jeered
and
called
on
him
to
resign
so
too
did
melenchon
head
of
party
la
france
insoumise
france
unbowed
and
leader
marine
le
pen
who
both
demanded
the
government
unwind
its
fuel
tax
hikes
they
called
for
parliament
to
be
dissolved
and
snap
elections
held
such
an
outcome
is
unlikely
however
macron
has
years
left
of
his
mandate
and
a
strong
majority
in
parliament
albeit
with
signs
of
simmering
unease
on
the
backbenches
over
his
response
to
the
protests
tv
footage
showed
the
interior
of
the
arc
ransacked
a
statue
of
marianne
symbol
of
the
french
republic
smashed
and
graffiti
scrawled
on
the
exterior
ranging
from
slogans
to
social
demands
and
calls
for
macron
s
resignation
on
nearby
streets
some
parisians
worried
of
a
repeat
of
the
violence
next
weekend
the
yellow
vests
have
already
called
another
demonstration
in
paris
the
violence
is
increasing
at
an
exponential
rate
said
claude
a
resident
in
the
affluent
district
the
state
is
losing
control
it
is
scary
they
can
not
let
this
happen
maybe
the
army
should
