france's macron learns the hard way: green taxes carry political risks
paris
reuters
when
emmanuel
macron
rose
to
power
he
put
the
environment
at
the
heart
of
his
agenda
eighteen
months
later
anger
over
those
policies
has
stoked
protests
that
are
a
huge
challenge
for
the
french
president
rioters
torched
cars
and
buildings
in
central
paris
on
saturday
following
two
weeks
of
protests
caused
partly
by
higher
fuel
taxes
which
macron
says
are
needed
to
fight
climate
change
some
protesters
called
for
him
to
resign
macron
s
plight
illustrates
a
conundrum
how
do
political
leaders
introduce
policies
that
will
do
good
for
the
environment
without
inflicting
extra
costs
on
voters
that
may
damage
their
chances
of
it
is
a
question
facing
leaders
across
the
world
as
delegates
hold
talks
in
the
polish
city
of
katowice
this
week
to
try
to
produce
a
rule
book
to
flesh
out
details
of
the
paris
agreement
on
fighting
climate
change
clearly
countries
where
inequalities
are
the
highest
are
the
ones
where
these
kinds
of
are
mostly
likely
francois
gemenne
a
specialist
in
environmental
geopolitics
at
sciencespo
university
in
paris
said
of
the
political
risks
naming
italy
the
united
states
and
britain
as
countries
where
environmental
moves
could
risk
a
voter
backlash
he
said
i
guess
it
s
one
of
the
reasons
why
populist
leaders
tend
to
be
very
skeptical
about
climate
change
and
environmental
the
protests
in
france
have
inspired
a
similar
movement
in
neighboring
belgium
where
protesters
took
to
the
streets
on
friday
there
have
also
been
protests
in
canada
over
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
s
plan
to
impose
a
federal
carbon
tax
on
provinces
unwilling
to
combat
climate
change
what
was
once
widely
seen
by
governments
as
a
transition
to
cleaner
energies
now
looks
more
like
causing
costs
with
huge
social
disruption
followed
by
possible
gains
another
challenge
facing
leaders
is
over
how
they
use
the
proceeds
from
policies
intended
to
help
the
environment
should
money
raised
from
carbon
taxes
be
used
directly
to
combat
climate
change
or
to
plug
holes
in
national
accounts
macron
said
after
the
latest
protests
in
paris
that
he
would
convene
ministers
to
discuss
the
crisis
on
his
return
from
a
summit
in
argentina
prime
minister
edouard
philippe
canceled
plans
to
go
to
katowice
for
the
climate
change
summit
macron
introduced
new
carbon
taxes
to
urge
motorists
to
change
behavior
and
protect
the
environment
macron
has
watered
down
some
of
his
campaign
pledges
on
the
environment
since
he
took
office
and
his
popular
environment
minister
quit
in
august
over
the
sluggishness
of
progress
but
he
has
shown
little
willingness
to
compromise
in
the
face
of
the
protests
the
fuel
tax
is
accompanied
by
other
measures
including
incentives
to
encourage
people
to
buy
electric
vehicles
unveiling
a
energy
plan
for
france
last
week
he
held
out
an
olive
branch
by
saying
he
would
review
fuel
prices
each
quarter
but
said
the
carbon
taxes
would
stay
his
goal
is
for
france
to
cut
carbon
emissions
by
percent
by
and
boost
the
use
of
cleaner
energies
at
the
same
time
emissions
are
currently
rising
and
percent
of
energy
use
in
france
originates
from
fossil
fuels
when
we
talk
about
the
actions
of
the
nation
in
response
to
the
challenges
of
climate
change
we
have
to
say
that
we
have
done
little
he
said
macron
has
also
said
he
will
fight
to
try
to
save
the
paris
climate
agreement
which
aims
to
keep
global
temperature
rises
to
between
and
degrees
celsius
a
critical
threshold
scientists
are
increasingly
concerned
that
countries
are
falling
short
on
their
targets
and
must
be
more
ambitious
yet
citizens
are
worried
about
their
immediate
lives
in
canada
addressing
the
question
of
how
governments
use
the
money
raised
from
carbon
taxes
trudeau
s
government
has
promised
to
return
the
money
collected
from
the
provinces
directly
to
taxpayers
but
in
france
most
of
the
revenue
generated
will
be
used
to
tackle
the
national
budget
deficit
increasing
anger
at
macron
who
opponents
call
the
president
of
the
rich
of
the
billion
euros
billion
the
french
government
will
raise
on
fuel
taxes
in
a
sum
of
only
billion
euros
is
earmarked
for
environmental
measures
simon
dalby
a
specialist
in
the
political
economy
of
climate
change
at
wilfrid
laurier
university
in
canada
says
carbon
taxes
should
be
part
of
wider
measures
to
alter
how
people
live
including
better
greener
transport
and
buildings
it
is
all
about
policies
for
transition
to
a
world
something
that
needs
to
be
done
quickly
if
the
worst
of
the
predicted
climate
disruptions
are
to
be
avoided
in
the
coming
decades
he
said
gemenne
said
the
protests
in
france
were
unlikely
to
go
away
soon
and
may
emerge
in
other
countries
as
they
take
more
determined
action
on
emissions
the
danger
he
said
was
inaction
or
acting
too
late
to
prevent
global
warming
at
the
same
time
politicians
need
to
be
able
to
show
they
were
acting
fairly
and
equitably
