germany
is
not
ruling
out
further
recalls
of
cars
as
it
continues
to
check
the
car
industry
for
illegal
software
transport
minister
andreas
scheuer
told
a
german
daily
we
will
continue
to
review
the
situation
it
s
an
ongoing
monitoring
of
the
market
he
was
quoted
as
saying
by
handelsblatt
the
german
transport
ministry
last
month
said
vehicles
in
europe
had
been
found
to
contain
unauthorised
software
defeat
devices
ordering
daimler
to
recall
more
than
cars
in
germany
scheuer
said
the
ministry
was
also
monitoring
cars
from
manufacturers
outside
of
germany
without
specifying
the
brands
but
could
not
take
any
action
itself
we
are
checking
vehicles
of
other
manufacturers
and
seeing
that
their
test
values
sometimes
go
through
the
roof
but
we
can
t
do
anything
because
they
get
the
approvals
in
their
own
country
that
annoys
me
