arabia
s
economy
began
to
recover
in
the
first
quarter
of
after
shrinking
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
during
official
data
showed
on
sunday
and
the
recovery
looks
set
to
accelerate
in
coming
months
with
a
rise
in
oil
production
gross
domestic
product
adjusted
for
inflation
grew
percent
from
a
year
earlier
in
the
first
three
months
of
the
government
s
statistics
agency
said
gdp
had
dropped
from
a
year
earlier
in
every
quarter
of
as
a
global
agreement
among
oil
exporting
countries
caused
saudi
arabia
to
cut
back
its
crude
output
for
the
whole
of
gdp
shrank
percent
the
impact
of
the
oil
deal
faded
at
the
start
of
after
saudi
arabia
completed
the
required
cuts
this
allowed
the
oil
sector
which
comprises
over
percent
of
the
economy
to
grow
percent
from
a
year
ago
in
the
first
quarter
a
big
contrast
to
its
percent
decline
in
the
last
quarter
of
in
the
next
several
months
saudi
oil
production
is
set
to
expand
global
producers
agreed
last
month
to
boost
output
by
a
combined
to
million
barrels
per
day
and
as
the
world
s
biggest
crude
exporter
riyadh
may
account
for
the
lion
s
share
of
the
increase
president
donald
trump
said
in
a
tweet
on
saturday
that
saudi
arabia
s
king
salman
had
agreed
to
boost
output
by
as
much
as
million
bpd
to
offset
anticipated
losses
in
production
by
iran
which
faces
sanctions
and
venezuela
analysts
think
such
a
big
jump
is
very
unlikely
but
monica
malik
chief
economist
at
abu
dhabi
commercial
bank
said
she
was
conservatively
assuming
a
rise
in
average
saudi
output
of
bpd
in
the
second
half
of
which
would
be
a
increase
of
about
percent
supply
disruptions
elsewhere
in
the
world
could
cause
riyadh
to
lift
output
even
more
malik
added
predicting
overall
saudi
gdp
growth
of
percent
this
year
led
by
the
oil
sector
many
businesses
in
saudi
arabia
are
struggling
under
the
weight
of
austerity
steps
designed
to
cut
the
government
s
big
budget
deficit
a
percent
tax
was
imposed
at
the
start
of
and
domestic
fuel
prices
were
increased
as
a
result
malik
predicted
only
modest
gdp
growth
of
percent
this
year
up
from
percent
in
to
some
degree
we
re
likely
to
return
to
saudi
arabia
s
old
model
of
growth
this
year
with
rising
oil
exports
feeding
through
into
the
rest
of
the
economy
she
said
structural
reforms
to
create
other
sources
of
growth
may
have
an
impact
in
coming
years
but
don
t
look
like
they
ll
be
in
time
to
have
an
effect
this
the
sector
grew
just
percent
from
a
year
ago
in
the
first
quarter
of
only
slightly
faster
than
percent
in
the
previous
quarter
within
that
category
the
private
sector
which
authorities
hope
will
create
new
jobs
to
bring
down
an
unemployment
rate
of
nearly
percent
among
saudi
citizens
inched
up
just
percent
faster
than
percent
in
last
year
s
fourth
quarter
the
construction
industry
shrank
percent
from
a
year
ago
in
the
first
quarter
showing
builders
continued
to
struggle
with
state
spending
curbs
and
corporate
caution
that
have
reduced
the
number
of
big
new
projects
in
the
past
few
years
the
wholesale
and
retail
sectors
plus
restaurants
and
hotels
shrank
percent
suggesting
saudi
consumers
curbed
their
spending
because
of
the
new
tax
an
exodus
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
foreign
workers
from
saudi
arabia
due
to
the
weak
economy
is
also
hurting
consumer
demand
