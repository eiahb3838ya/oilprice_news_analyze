libya
s
national
oil
corporation
noc
said
on
sunday
that
a
port
blockade
by
eastern
authorities
could
result
in
losses
estimated
at
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
daily
revenue
of
million
operations
at
the
ports
were
blocked
after
the
libyan
national
army
lna
announced
last
monday
that
it
would
no
longer
let
the
noc
export
from
them
the
standoff
is
part
of
a
broader
conflict
in
libya
and
has
raised
the
prospect
of
a
prolonged
output
drop
from
the
opec
member
which
had
recently
been
pumping
more
than
one
million
bpd
two
terminals
ras
lanuf
and
es
sider
were
shut
by
fighting
involving
the
lna
last
month
the
noc
had
said
blockades
would
likely
oblige
it
to
declare
force
majeure
at
two
other
terminals
hariga
and
zueitina
on
sunday
but
it
has
yet
to
do
so
the
lna
also
controls
a
fifth
port
at
brega
however
it
warned
in
a
statement
that
if
force
majeure
was
declared
this
would
have
significant
short
and
long
term
consequences
for
noc
affiliate
companies
the
national
economy
and
the
libyan
people
in
addition
to
the
crude
oil
losses
the
noc
said
output
of
natural
gas
used
for
local
power
supplies
and
oil
and
gas
field
operations
would
fall
by
million
standard
cubic
feet
per
day
and
that
more
than
bpd
of
condensate
would
be
lost
the
power
generation
at
the
zueitina
and
north
benghazi
power
stations
will
be
badly
affected
the
noc
said
the
corporation
is
already
facing
a
deficit
in
the
fuel
import
budget
and
will
not
be
able
to
compensate
the
lost
gas
due
to
the
shutdown
by
importing
more
liquid
fuel
from
to
keep
power
plants
operational
the
noc
said
it
would
have
to
burn
valuable
condensate
resulting
in
significant
negative
environmental
impact
displacing
crude
from
the
abu
attifel
to
zueitina
pipeline
would
require
one
million
barrels
of
water
and
additional
chemicals
and
waha
oil
company
pipelines
could
be
corroded
by
the
stoppage
the
noc
said
once
stored
crude
was
used
refineries
at
brega
sarir
and
tobruk
would
be
forced
to
close
