update 1-can saudi arabia pump much more oil?
london
reuters
the
leader
of
saudi
arabia
has
assured
president
donald
trump
that
the
kingdom
can
raise
oil
production
if
needed
and
the
country
has
million
barrels
per
day
of
spare
capacity
that
could
be
deployed
to
help
cool
down
oil
prices
to
compensate
for
falling
output
in
venezuela
and
iran
in
a
tweet
on
saturday
trump
said
saudi
arabia
had
agreed
to
increase
output
by
up
to
this
amount
although
a
subsequent
statement
from
the
white
house
rowed
back
on
this
assertion
either
way
the
kingdom
opec
s
biggest
member
can
barely
raise
output
by
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
and
even
that
would
be
difficult
according
to
industry
analysts
who
forecast
a
further
oil
price
rally
due
to
a
lack
of
new
supply
opec
race
to
balance
crude
oil
supply
and
demand
below
are
comments
from
some
leading
opec
analysts
pierre
andurand
hedge
fund
manager
i
guess
the
saudis
want
to
give
the
confidence
to
trump
to
go
very
hardcore
on
iran
exports
to
zero
or
an
attack
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
the
saudis
can
really
do
and
for
how
long
it
seems
that
iranian
regime
change
is
priority
number
one
for
the
amrita
sen
chief
oil
analyst
at
energy
aspects
we
will
be
in
unchartered
territory
while
saudi
arabia
has
the
capacity
in
theory
it
takes
time
and
money
to
bring
these
barrels
online
possibly
up
to
year
gary
ross
head
of
global
oil
analytics
at
s
p
global
the
saudis
do
not
have
million
bpd
of
spare
capacity
as
it
would
imply
production
of
million
bpd
they
can
likely
produce
a
maximum
of
million
and
even
that
will
be
running
their
system
at
stress
levels
said
ross
he
added
that
with
a
potential
output
fall
of
up
to
million
bpd
in
iran
and
further
outages
in
venezuela
and
libya
the
world
could
be
short
of
million
bpd
of
oil
output
without
an
increase
in
saudi
output
by
the
end
of
the
year
ole
hansen
head
of
commodities
research
at
saxo
bank
we
are
seeing
another
strong
signal
from
the
two
of
the
world
s
three
largest
producers
to
cap
the
price
upside
in
oil
with
russia
agreeing
to
this
we
are
seeing
political
interference
in
the
setting
of
oil
prices
on
the
rise
saudi
arabia
agreeing
to
such
a
request
basically
raises
the
risk
that
opec
has
played
out
its
role
with
saudi
russia
and
the
are
now
setting
the
i
do
not
believe
that
saudi
can
increase
production
to
million
bpd
but
they
can
increase
exports
by
digging
into
their
it
does
however
also
increase
middle
east
tensions
and
with
iran
controlling
the
strait
of
hormuz
there
is
a
risk
that
this
could
escalate
to
a
point
where
million
bpd
would
not
be
in
the
however
a
busy
night
on
sunday
can
be
expected
with
traders
and
funds
getting
caught
on
the
long
side
not
least
in
wti
where
we
saw
a
collapse
in
the
gross
short
last
week
while
the
jumped
by
percent
and
the
ratio
hit
a
giovanni
staunovo
commodity
analyst
at
ubs
while
president
trump
s
tweet
is
very
clear
on
how
much
oil
he
intends
to
see
from
saudi
arabia
the
saudi
press
agency
statement
was
more
vague
no
volume
increase
the
statement
seems
to
suggest
the
kingdom
stands
ready
but
first
wants
to
see
larger
disruptions
a
saudi
production
increase
would
move
the
kingdom
s
oil
production
into
unchartered
territory
and
would
wipe
out
completely
the
kingdom
s
spare
prices
are
likely
to
become
more
volatile
over
the
coming
months
caught
between
two
narratives
oversupply
concerns
and
dwindling
spare
market
tightness
