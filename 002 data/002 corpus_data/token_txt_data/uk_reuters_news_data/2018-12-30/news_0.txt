asian
stocks
crept
higher
on
monday
as
hints
of
progress
on
the
trade
standoff
provided
a
rare
glint
of
optimism
in
what
has
been
a
disappointing
year
for
equities
in
the
region
president
donald
trump
said
he
held
a
very
good
call
with
china
s

xi
jinping
on

and
claimed
big
progress
was
being
made
chinese
state

more
reserved
saying
xi
hoped
the
negotiating
teams
could
meet
each
other
half
way
and
reach
an
agreement
that
was
mutually
beneficial
the
wall
street
journal
reported
negotiators
were
starting
to
work
out
a
deal
that

boost

msci
s
broadest
index
of
shares
outside
japan
added
percent
in
early
trade
but
was
still
down
percent
for
the
year
japan
s
nikkei
was
closed
for
a
holiday
having
ended
the
year
with
a
loss
of
percent
across
the
region
the
worst
performer
of
the
year
was
the
index
of
chinese
blue
chips
which
lost
a
quarter
of
its
value
the
only
major
market
in
the
black
for
the
year
was
india
where
the
bse
was
ahead
by
almost
percent
the
story
was
much
the
same
across
the
globe
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
major
stock
indices
in
the
red
the
s
p
is
off
almost
percent
for
december
its
worst
month
since
february
that
left
it
down
percent
for
the
quarter
and
percent
for
the
year
simply
looking
at
the
markets
would
suggest
that
the
global
economy
is
headed
into
recession
said
robert
michele
chief
investment
officer
and
head
of
fixed
income
at
morgan
asset
management
however
while
we
agree
the
global
economy
is
in
a
growth
slowdown
we
don
t
see
an
impending
recession
he
added
in
part
because
the
federal
reserve
could
provide
a
policy
cushion
already
commentary
out
of
the
fed
suggests
that
it
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
journey
to
normalize
policy
argued
michele
indeed
fed
fund
futures
have
largely
priced
out
any
hike
for
next
year
and
now
imply
a
quarter
point
cut
by
the
treasury
market
clearly
thinks
the
fed
is
done
on
hikes
with
yields
on
paper
having
fallen
to
just
percent
from
a
peak
of
percent
in
november
the
trillion
market
is
heading
to
its
biggest
monthly
rally
in
years
according
to
an
index
compiled
by
bloomberg
and
barclays
the
precipitous
drop
in
yields
has
undermined
the
dollar
in
recent
weeks
against
a
basket
of
currencies
it
was
on
track
to
end
december
with
a
loss
of
percent
but
was
still
up
on
the
year
as
a
whole
it
has
also
had
a
tough
month
against
the
yen
with
a
loss
of
percent
and
was
last
trading
at
then
again
was
a
pretty
stable
year
for
the
pair
given
they
spent
all
of
it
in
a
narrow
trading
range
of
to
the
euro
was
ending
the
month
on
a
firmer
note
at
but
still
nursed
losses
of
almost
percent
for
the
year
to
date
that
was
trivial
compared
with
the
hit
oil
prices
have
taken
in
the
last
couple
of
months
with
brent
down
almost
percent
since
its
peak
in
october
early
monday
the
crude
benchmark
was
up
cents
at
a
barrel
but
down
percent
for
the
year
crude
futures
nudged
up
cents
to
gold
was
ending
the
year
on
a
high
note
after
rallying
almost
percent
in
the
past
month
