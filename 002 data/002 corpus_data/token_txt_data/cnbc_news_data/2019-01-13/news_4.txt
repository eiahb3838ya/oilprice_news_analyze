saudi
arabia
energy
minister
said
sunday
he
positive
opec
and
partnered
nations
will
meet
their
production
cut
commitments
to
balance
oil
markets
in
despite
what
he
described
as
a
slower
than
anticipated
pace
by
some
we
already
done
it
we
done
enough
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
cnbc
on
sunday
in
abu
dhabi
when
asked
what
opec
largest
producer
would
do
to
balance
markets
this
year
not
only
the
kingdom
but
other
countries
we
heard
from
the
emirates
i
talked
repeatedly
to
my
colleagues
in
iraq
they
already
taken
action
he
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
he
then
mentioned
the
performance
of
the
largest
producer
that
partnered
with
the
cartel
on
cuts
russia
has
started
slower
than
i
like
but
they
started
and
i
am
sure
as
they
did
as
in
they
catch
up
and
be
a
positive
contributor
to
the
market
opec
members
along
with
several
other
countries
in
december
agreed
on
output
cuts
totaling
million
barrels
per
day
in
order
to
stem
a
sinking
market
and
support
their
own
economies
opec
plus
refers
to
the
group
cooperation
with
the
producers
like
russia
and
other
former
soviet
states
as
well
as
mexico
russia
was
more
reluctant
to
cut
its
output
as
its
growth
is
heavily
dependent
on
robust
crude
exports
russia
has
initially
let
the
saudis
shoulder
the
bulk
of
output
cuts
the
top
opec
ally
which
in
late
began
a
cooperation
agreement
with
riyadh
to
stabilize
oil
prices
has
often
said
that
per
barrel
is
enough
to
meet
its
economic
needs
moscow
in
december
said
it
would
cut
production
by
to
barrels
a
day
in
january
while
saudi
pledged
a
cut
of
barrels
