opec secretary general worried about trade war effect on china and india, oil demand's 'bright spots'
opec
secretary
general
mohammed
barkindo
is
largely
optimistic
over
prospects
of
achieving
a
balanced
oil
market
in
but
if
one
thing
keeps
him
awake
at
night
it
the
trade
war
potential
to
disrupt
growth
in
major
asian
markets
that
import
the
highest
proportion
of
the
world
crude
we
are
concerned
with
the
lingering
trade
disputes
barkindo
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
while
at
the
atlantic
council
global
energy
forum
in
abu
dhabi
sunday
the
synchronized
growth
that
we
have
witnessed
since
the
last
global
financial
crisis
that
has
taken
this
long
was
also
due
largely
to
the
growth
in
international
trade
any
measures
that
may
impact
or
constrain
trade
may
likely
impact
on
growth
and
by
extension
on
demand
for
energy
at
the
moment
outside
the
china
and
india
remain
the
brightest
spots
in
terms
of
demand
for
energy
so
you
can
imagine
our
concern
of
the
lingering
negotiations
