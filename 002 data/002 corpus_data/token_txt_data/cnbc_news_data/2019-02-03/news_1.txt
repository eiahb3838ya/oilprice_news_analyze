us infrastructure is crumbling, and it needs lots of money to fix it: civil engineer group
elon
musk
has
tunnel
vision
and
its
giving
several
cities
similar
ideas
the
tesla
ceo
and
entrepreneur
sees
commuters
using
a
system
of
tunnels
below
ground
in
los
angeles
and
other
cities
to
beat
the
traffic
in
a
recent
interview
with
cnbc
the
head
of
the
american
society
of
civil
engineers
agreed
that
the
ambitious
idea
is
no
pipe
dream
it
absolutely
viable
it
the
infrastructure
of
the
future
asce
executive
director
tom
smith
said
about
the
boring
company
proposed
underground
transportation
network
there
a
lot
of
innovation
that
sustainable
that
we
can
use
hyperloop
and
tunneling
is
one
example
smith
told
cnbc
on
the
money
in
a
recent
interview
but
while
he
saw
the
opportunity
for
successful
future
projects
the
asce
gave
the
united
states
a
current
overall
grade
of
in
its
most
recent
infrastructure
report
card
in
smith
acknowledged
that
a
is
a
very
lousy
score
the
poor
grade
reflects
unfortunately
a
failure
to
invest
in
our
infrastructure
in
the
united
states
we
been
relying
on
the
work
that
was
done
by
former
generations
he
said
and
there
an
investment
that
we
need
to
make
to
make
sure
we
protecting
future
generations
going
forward
smith
explained
the
asce
has
a
panel
of
civil
engineers
who
analyze
federal
government
data
in
categories
releasing
the
report
card
every
four
years
we
looking
at
aviation
bridges
roads
transit
dams
levees
schools
parks
solid
waste
drinking
water
waste
water
he
told
cnbc
unfortunately
out
of
categories
are
in
the
d
range
which
is
poor
or
which
is
really
reflecting
a
lot
of
our
infrastructure
being
at
the
end
of
its
useful
life
smith
said
the
asce
calculated
a
trillion
dollar
infrastructure
funding
gap
between
and
he
added
that
about
half
of
that
is
for
surface
transportation
which
includes
transit
roads
bridges
and
rail
in
the
asce
report
card
transit
scored
a
d
the
nation
roads
rated
a
d
and
bridges
got
a
but
the
organization
did
reveal
some
positive
news
the
highest
grade
right
now
is
in
the
rail
category
and
i
think
that
reflects
freight
rail
with
a
lot
of
private
investment
smith
stated
but
on
the
passenger
side
i
think
that
really
bringing
that
score
down
we
need
a
lot
of
investment
there
