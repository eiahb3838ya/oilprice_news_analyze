nigeria's disputed elections may become choice between 'bad and worse' amid oil sabotage, corruption and violence
as
nigerians
prepare
to
pick
a
president
and
parliament
members
the
oil
market
is
bracing
for
the
insecurity
and
violence
that
have
historically
marred
elections
in
africa
largest
crude
producer
early
saturday
nigeria
electoral
body
announced
that
nationwide
elections
that
were
scheduled
for
saturday
would
instead
be
delayed
until
february
regardless
the
election
will
take
place
under
the
shadow
of
violence
only
days
ago
militants
issued
a
new
threat
to
cripple
the
economy
with
devastating
attacks
on
the
nation
oil
infrastructure
between
and
a
wave
of
sabotage
disrupted
global
supplies
which
deepened
nigeria
worst
recession
in
nearly
years
in
next
saturday
contest
could
also
determine
the
fate
of
reforms
to
the
nation
lifeblood
oil
industry
legislation
to
overhaul
the
sector
in
development
almost
since
democracy
took
hold
two
decades
ago
aims
to
address
problems
that
have
fostered
the
nation
notorious
corruption
and
kept
many
nigerians
trapped
in
a
cycle
of
poverty
despite
their
nation
fantastic
oil
wealth
nigeria
is
home
to
africa
highest
population
and
the
continent
largest
economy
but
with
an
estimated
million
people
living
on
less
than
a
day
nigeria
has
overtaken
india
as
the
nation
with
the
most
people
living
in
extreme
poverty
it
makes
the
country
a
textbook
case
of
resource
curse
an
economic
phenomenon
in
which
countries
blessed
with
fossil
fuel
and
mineral
reserves
often
fare
worse
than
resource
poor
nations
to
be
sure
no
one
expects
a
single
election
to
turn
the
tide
for
the
nation
oil
production
peaked
in
and
the
energy
sector
continues
to
be
undermined
by
militant
violence
widespread
theft
and
regulatory
uncertainty
meanwhile
other
west
african
nations
like
ghana
and
mauritania
have
become
more
attractive
to
international
oil
and
gas
companies
regardless
of
who
wins
i
think
you
are
going
to
still
see
a
lot
of
the
drivers
of
insecurity
said
imad
mesdoua
a
senior
consultant
at
control
risks
the
reasons
for
that
are
structural
there
are
underlying
issues
like
lack
of
infrastructure
and
bad
governance
at
the
state
level
uneven
distribution
of
resources
yet
depending
on
how
nigerians
cast
their
ballots
analysts
say
the
presidential
and
parliamentary
elections
could
produce
very
different
outcomes
for
the
energy
sector
the
presidential
ballot
pits
incumbent
muhammadu
buhari
who
represents
the
all
progressives
congress
against
former
atiku
abubakar
of
the
people
democratic
party
buhari
currently
leads
in
the
polls
but
the
race
remains
close
and
violence
at
voting
booths
makes
nigeria
elections
difficult
to
forecast
analysts
say
buhari
reputation
as
an
crusader
is
bolstering
him
in
polls
particularly
with
nigeria
vast
rural
poor
however
the
president
has
struggled
to
deliver
on
the
three
pillars
of
his
campaign
fighting
graft
delivering
security
and
creating
a
more
inclusive
economy
meanwhile
atiku
primarily
appeals
to
voters
discouraged
by
buhari
handling
of
the
economy
which
has
seen
unemployment
more
than
double
yet
while
atiku
primarily
identifies
as
a
businessman
he
has
been
involved
in
oil
services
firms
property
development
farming
and
education
he
has
also
been
tainted
by
accusations
of
corruption
