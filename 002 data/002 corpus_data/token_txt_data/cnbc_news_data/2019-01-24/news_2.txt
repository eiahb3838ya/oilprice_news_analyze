us to become a net energy exporter in 2020 for first time in nearly 70 years, energy dept says
the
boom
in
oil
and
natural
gas
production
will
make
the
a
net
energy
exporter
in
a
feat
the
country
has
not
achieved
in
nearly
years
the
department
of
energy
statistics
bureau
said
on
thursday
the
will
start
exporting
more
energy
products
than
it
imports
as
crude
output
continues
to
grow
and
domestic
oil
consumption
declines
the
energy
information
administration
said
in
its
latest
annual
energy
outlook
growing
shipments
of
natural
gas
and
petroleum
byproducts
will
also
boost
the
country
role
as
a
major
energy
exporter
the
report
which
makes
projections
for
the
next
years
marks
the
latest
revision
to
eia
timeline
for
the
to
become
more
energy
independent
last
year
eia
forecast
the
would
become
a
net
exporter
by
in
it
said
the
nation
would
achieve
the
status
in
last
week
eia
said
the
will
start
exporting
more
crude
oil
and
petroleum
products
than
it
imports
by
the
final
quarter
of
after
that
it
would
remain
a
net
oil
exporter
for
years
to
come
towards
the
end
of
its
forecast
period
eia
expects
the
to
once
again
start
importing
more
petroleum
products
than
it
exports
as
economic
growth
fuels
demand
for
gasoline
eia
expects
oil
production
to
continue
setting
new
records
each
year
for
nearly
another
decade
the
bureau
sees
american
oil
output
hitting
a
new
annual
high
through
when
booming
production
starts
to
level
off
last
year
the
nation
drillers
pumped
an
average
million
barrels
a
day
breaking
the
annual
record
going
back
to
once
production
cracks
million
barrels
a
day
in
the
coming
years
eia
expects
the
output
to
stay
above
that
level
through
most
of
the
growth
will
come
from
shale
fields
where
drillers
use
advanced
methods
to
free
oil
and
gas
from
rock
formations
the
shale
drilling
will
also
support
a
rise
in
natural
gas
liquids
production
which
yields
byproducts
like
ethane
propane
and
butane
these
ngls
are
used
to
make
a
wide
range
of
products
and
chemicals
including
plastics
eia
says
ngl
output
could
account
for
about
a
third
of
total
liquids
production
through
the
became
a
net
exporter
of
natural
gas
in
and
eia
sees
low
gas
prices
encouraging
adoption
of
the
fuel
across
a
number
of
sectors
eia
expects
natural
gas
shipments
to
continue
growing
driven
by
exports
of
liquefied
natural
gas
a
form
of
the
fuel
chilled
to
liquid
form
for
transport
by
sea
the
country
will
remain
a
net
coal
exporter
through
but
eia
does
not
see
shipments
growing
due
to
competition
from
other
nations
better
positioned
to
serve
big
importers
