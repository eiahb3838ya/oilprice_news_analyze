total's ceo names his top risk for oil markets — and it's not what you think
global
oil
markets
are
facing
an
uncertain
year
with
slowing
global
growth
driving
less
global
demand
for
oil
while
the
supply
picture
looks
unclear
with
production
cuts
by
opec
and
russia
potentially
counteracted
by
the
growth
in
shale
oil
output
but
it
not
supply
demand
sanctions
on
iran
oil
industry
or
political
upheaval
in
oil
producer
venezuela
that
the
chief
executive
of
total
is
worried
about
the
main
risk
for
the
oil
market
is
the
situation
in
the
middle
east
because
this
is
the
big
area
of
production
not
only
in
saudi
arabia
but
in
the
uae
and
kuwait
there
iraq
and
iran
and
this
region
is
connected
total
patrick
pouyanné
told
cnbc
at
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
on
thursday
and
it
clear
that
the
events
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
year
around
saudi
arabia
and
iran
which
are
the
two
big
blocs
there
have
worried
a
lot
of
people
so
there
is
purely
a
premium
risk
having
said
that
we
should
overestimate
it
there
is
also
the
supply
and
demand
factor
he
said
yes
demand
is
strong
but
supply
is
also
going
very
strong
with
shale
