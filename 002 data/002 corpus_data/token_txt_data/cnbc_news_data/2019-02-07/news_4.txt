china and russia loaned billions to venezuela â€” and then the presidency went up for grabs
venezuela
is
in
the
middle
of
a
power
struggle
at
the
highest
level
and
that
could
mean
trouble
for
its
two
biggest
foreign
allies
china
and
russia
the
socialist
petrostate
is
home
to
the
largest
oil
reserves
on
the
planet
but
endemic
corruption
has
devastated
its
economy
beijing
and
moscow
have
helped
the
country
stave
off
collapse
by
repeatedly
extending
financial
lifelines
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
over
the
last
decade
for
the
most
part
those
swaps
were
good
for
all
parties
involved
but
that
may
be
changing
