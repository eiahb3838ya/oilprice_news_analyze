oman
oil
minister
thinks
president
donald
trump
has
given
opec
some
undue
flak
but
echoing
other
gulf
ministers
mohammed
bin
hamad
stressed
his
desire
to
steer
clear
of
political
animosity
with
the
american
leader
appearing
keen
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
sometimes
he
has
been
fair
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
while
at
the
atlantic
council
global
energy
forum
in
abu
dhabi
i
sure
he
has
good
intention
too
he
thinks
he
is
representing
the
people
of
the
and
he
thinks
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
nobody
wants
volatility
i
am
sure
trump
does
want
volatility
because
volatility
is
difficult
to
manage
he
said
trump
has
spent
months
vocally
criticizing
the
cartel
for
its
management
of
oil
output
urging
the
group
to
keep
the
taps
open
and
oil
prices
low
opec
is
ripping
us
off
trump
said
in
a
tweet
last
october
in
december
opec
members
along
with
russia
reached
an
agreement
to
cut
their
crude
production
by
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
from
the
market
in
order
to
stem
the
fall
in
prices
something
that
further
drew
trump
ire
unfortunately
there
are
politics
but
sometimes
the
politics
forces
people
to
go
to
the
social
media
or
to
cnbc
to
present
their
case
and
that
is
the
reality
of
today

minister
