while
north
american
shale
may
be
competition
for
opec
members
some
countries
in
the
arabian
gulf
are
simultaneously
taking
advantage
of
the
commodity
ability
to
fuel
lucrative
investments
beyond
oil
for
the
united
arab
emirates
musabbeh
chief
executive
of
abu
dhabi
mubadala
petroleum
and
petrochemicals
the
shale
revolution
has
the
made
north
american
gas
and
petrochemicals
industry
very
attractive
bringing
gas
feedstock
to
the
market
the
petrochemicals
firm
is
a
major
component
of
mubadala
investment
company
abu
dhabi
holding
company
it
operates
as
a
sovereign
wealth
fund
with
assets
of
more
than
billion
and
is
aimed
at
diversifying
the
emirate
economy
we
as
an
investor
made
big
investments
in
the
last
months
north
of
billion
dollars
and
some
of
these
big
investments
are
happening
in
north
america
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
during
the
atlantic
council
energy
forum
in
abu
dhabi
this
was
for
two
simple
reasons
the
ceo
said
it
is
a
big
market
and
it
is
enjoying
a
highly
competitive
feedstock
so
we
like
the
business
in
that
part
of
the
world
because
of
these
two
reasons
feedstock
refers
to
raw
material
such
as
natural
gas
used
in
petrochemical
production
gas
dominate
the
company
business
and
has
previously
highlighted
north
america
as
the
focus
of
a
strategic
shift
when
it
comes
to
petrochemicals
thanks
to
the
shale
revolution
other
parts
of
global
energy
i
would
say
the
energy
industry
the
price
would
be
set
by
the
high
cost
producers
going
forward
added
and
who
are
the
high
cost
producers
nowadays
the
shale
producers
and
we
will
keep
monitoring
what
is
happening
in
that
part
of
the
world
