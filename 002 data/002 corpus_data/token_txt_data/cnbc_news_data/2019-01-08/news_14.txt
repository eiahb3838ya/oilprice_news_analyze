said
on
monday
that
beijing
and
washington
could
reach
a
trade
deal
that

around

is
no
longer
working
and
it
embracing
an
openly

approach
and

makes
it
unlikely
that

will
ignore

looming
over
the

however
is
a
surge
in

driven
by
a
steep
rise
in

oil
drilling
and
production
as

crude

rose
by
a

million

last

to
a

record
million

with

activity
still
high
most

expect

to
rise

it
was

that
