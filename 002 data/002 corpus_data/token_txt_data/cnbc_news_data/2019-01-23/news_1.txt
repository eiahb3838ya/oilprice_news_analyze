cramer: oil prices are taking too much control over the stock market's moves
it
infuriates
cnbc
jim
cramer
to
watch
hedge
funds
take
control
of
the
stock
market
by
making
decisions
based
on
a
single
variable
the
price
of
oil
oil
prices
which
are
almost
entirely
hostage
to
the
trade
talks
with
china
declined
on
wednesday
reflecting
the
notion
that
no
news
is
bad
news
cramer
said
on
mad
money
but
after
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
surged
in
the
first
hour
of
trading
on
some
strong
earnings
reports
the
fact
that
oil
morning
reversal
was
able
to
drag
the
dow
and
the
s
p
lower
rattled
the
longtime
this
is
a
rough
environment
for
individual
investors
who
prefer
to
own
stocks
not
rent
them
because
the
hedge
funds
are
in
control
cramer
explained
adding
that
the
morning
breathtaking
decline
was
linked
solely
to
the
price
of
crude
this
kind
of
action
infuriates
me
he
said
first
off
percent
of
the
companies
in
the
s
p
actually
benefit
from
lower
oil
their
stocks
should
be
going
up
not
down
when
the
price
of
crude
drops
it
makes
a
mockery
of
everything
investing
is
supposed
to
be
about
this
obsession
with
oil
prices
can
cause
such
dramatic
market
swings
that
it
discourages
regular
individual
investors
from
buying
stocks
the
mad
money
host
warned
but
do
despair
longer
term
these
gyrations
do
matter
longer
term
stocks
behave
a
lot
more
rationally
he
said
cheaper
oil
helps
everything
from
freight
costs
to
plastic
discretionary
consumption
most
companies
are
going
to
be
winners
from
lower
oil
prices
and
their
stocks
will
be
winners
too
shorter
term
though
no
single
investor
can
muster
the
buying
power
to
beat
the
hedge
funds
cramer
said
instead
he
suggested
battling
them
over
the
long
haul
where
these
investment
firms
are
at
their
weakest
you
can
afford
to
take
your
time
and
pick
at
the
stocks
of
companies
that
deliver
amazing
results
like
the
four
standout
earnings
reports
wednesday
morning
from
ibm
procter
gamble
united
technologies
and
comcast
he
said
shares
of
all
four
companies
have
more
room
to
run
based
on
their
quarterly
results
which
indicated
strategic
focus
organic
growth
and
encouraging
prospects
for
innovation
he
added
bottom
line
on
a
basis
this
market
may
be
controlled
by
traders
who
only
seem
to
care
about
the
price
of
oil
it
why
we
sold
off
this
morning
and
it
why
we
bounced
later
in
the
day
cramer
concluded
but
over
the
long
haul
the
earnings
of
individual
companies
do
actually
matter
which
is
why
what
we
heard
from
ibm
from
procter
gamble
united
technologies
and
comcast
was
so
encouraging
for
the
future
of
these
great
american
companies
