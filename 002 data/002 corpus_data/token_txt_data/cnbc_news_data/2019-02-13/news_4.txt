oil

rose
almost
percent
on
wednesday
after
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
said
it
would
cut
crude
exports
and
deliver
an
even
deeper
cut
to
its
production
but
swelling
crude
inventories
limited
the
day
gains
crude
oil
inventories
rose
last
week
to
the
highest
since
november
as
refiners
cut
runs
to
the
lowest
since
october
the
energy
information
administration
said
the
increase
came
despite
falling
net
imports
which
dropped
to
the
lowest
on
record
as
domestic
crude
production
remained
at
peak
levels

the
fifth

the

a

back
after
the

was
released
crude

at

after

earlier
in

this

is
bearish
said
phil
flynn
an
oil
analyst
at
price
futures
group
in
chicago
the
market
is
holding
up
because
of
the
outside
markets
the
hope
for
a
trade
deal
and
a
strong
dow
he
said
still
the
somewhat
bearish
report
did
little
to
shake
the
market
overwhelmingly
bullish
sentiment
said
tom
saal
senior
vice
president
at
intl
fcstone
in
miami
it
a
little
bit
on
the
bearish
side
saal
said
but
the
news
about
saudi
arabia
is
pretty
significant
so
the
market
is
reacting
to
that
more
so
than
anything
else
right
now
on
tuesday
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
the
financial
times
the
kingdom
production
will
fall
below
million
barrels
per
day
in
march
more
than
half
a
million
below
the
target
it
agreed
to
in
a
deal
between
opec
and
its
allies
aimed
at
curbing
a
global
supply
overhang
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
said
on
tuesday
it
had
cut
output
by
almost
bpd
in
january
to
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
is
responsible
for
most
of
that
reduction
the
factor
is
back
in
play
but
oil
bulls
are
by
no
means
out
of
the
woods
yet
pvm
oil
associates
stephen
brennock
said
it
is
a
fact
that
the
world
economy
is
losing
momentum
amid
a
plethora
of
downside
risks
including
lingering
trade
tensions
and
geopolitical
uncertainty
restrictions
on
venezuela
energy
sector
should
remove
some
bpd
in
supply
this
year
according
to
goldman
sachs
the
oil
price
has
risen
by
percent
so
far
this
year
yet
most
of
that
increase
came
in
early
january
before
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on
venezuela
energy
sector
the
global
oil
market
remains
well
supplied
the
international
energy
agency
said
in
its
monthly
market
report
on
wednesday
and
output
should
still
outstrip
demand
this
year
oil
prices
have
not
increased
alarmingly
because
the
market
is
still
working
off
the
surpluses
built
up
in
the
second
half
of
the
iea
said
in
quantity
terms
in
the

grow
its
crude
oil
production
by
more
than
venezuela
current
output
in
quality
terms
it
is
more
complicated
quality
matters
crude
output
is
expected
to
grow
by
million
bpd
this
year
and
by
another
bpd
next
year
to
hit
million
bpd
in
according
to
the
eia
the
growth
led
by
shale
oil
output
has
built
up
global
inventories
of
crude
and
refined
products
refining
margins
for
gasoline
have
collapsed
