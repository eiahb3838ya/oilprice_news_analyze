australia
woodside
petroleum
ltd
surprised
investors
with
a
fat
dividend
on
thursday
after
reporting
a
percent
rise
in
annual
profit
underpinned
by
stronger
oil
prices
the
payout
came
after
shareholders
stumped
up
billion
to
buy
new
shares
a
year
ago
at
a
time
when
australia
biggest
independent
oil
and
gas
producer
expected
oil
prices
to
average
a
barrel
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
flush
with
cash
as
oil
prices
had
averaged
and
the
wheatstone
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
project
run
by
chevron
corp
and
partly
owned
by
woodside
performed
better
than
anticipated
we
thought
it
was
prudent
to
reward
our
shareholders
for
supporting
us
last
year
in
the
equity
raising
given
that
pricing
and
production
has
been
stronger
than
we
expected
when
we
raised
that
equity
woodside
chief
executive
peter
coleman
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
woodside
shares
rose
as
much
as
percent
in
a
broader
market
that
was
up
percent
the
dividend
was
the
big
surprise
a
payout
ratio
of
about
percent
rbc
analyst
ben
wilson
said
in
a
note
the
increased
dividend
will
be
welcomed
by
some
particularly
given
the
strong
appetite
for
generation
and
higher
distribution
from
investors
in
energy
companies
globally
driven
by
increased
oil
price
volatility
wilson
said
the
total
dividend
was
million
or
cents
a
share
compared
with
analysts
forecasts
of
around
cents

share
according
to
refinitiv
estimates
net
profit
for
rose
to
billion
from
billion
in
underlying
profit
was
billion
just
below
analysts
estimates
of
around
billion
with
an
eye
on
growth
woodside
in
january
pledged
between
billion
and
billion
towards
projects
this
year
with
most
of
that
flowing
into
early
work
on
its
scarborough
and
browse
gas
developments
and
expansion
of
its
pluto
lng
plant
in
australia
as
the
company
aims
to
double
lng
production
by
the
capital
raising
last
year
was
partly
to
help
woodside
buy
a
stake
in
scarborough
for
million
giving
it
a
total
stake
of
percent
it
is
now
looking
to
sell
part
of
that
by
the
end
of
this
year
fielding
interest
from
a
number
of
international
parties
coleman
said
he
did
not
name
the
companies
there
is
speculation
saudi
aramco
is
one
of
them
after

arabia
energy
minister
khalid
said
in
an
interview
with
the

times
this
week
the
world
biggest
oil
producer
was
looking
at
investments
offshore
including
australia
woodside
as
a
company
and
australia
as
a
country
could
be
perceived
as
a
more
manageable
investment
destination
for
saudi
aramco
