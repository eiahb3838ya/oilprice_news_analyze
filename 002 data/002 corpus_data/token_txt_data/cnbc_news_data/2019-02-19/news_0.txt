saudi arabia's oil deal with russia is now 'more fragile than ever,' analyst says
a
rolling
oil
pact
between
russia
and
saudi
arabia
which
seeks
to
support
prices
by
reducing
output
looks
to
be
on
shaky
ground
with
only
the
arab
nation
appearing
to
fulfil
its
promises
late
last
year
opec
producing
countries
and
producers
led
by
russia
agreed
to
cut
supply
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
an
arrangement
known
as
saudi
arabia
agreed
to
account
for
the
bulk
of
opec
nation
cuts
and
has
confirmed
it
will
drop
its
crude
oil
production
by
a
further
barrels
per
day
to
million
in
march
if
achieved
it
would
mean
that
since
the
december
saudi
arabia
has
become
responsible
for
percent
of
the
total
target
in
turn
russia
was
set
to
account
for
the
greater
share
of
cuts
but
from
october
to
the
beginning
of
february
had
only
decreased
output
by
barrels
per
day
the
slow
pace
to
cuts
from
russian
oil
producers
drew
criticism
from
saudi
arabia
energy
minister
khalid
who
told
cnbc
in
january
that
moscow
had
moved
slower
than
i
like
that
barb
led
to
a
response
from
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
who
said
at
the
beginning
of
february
that
russia
was
completely
fulfilling
its
obligations
in
line
with
earlier
announced
plans
to
gradually
cut
production
by
may
this
year
during
oil
prices
were
dragged
lower
by
increasing
shale
supply
and
fears
over
global
demand
president
donald
trump
has
repeatedly
criticized
opec
on
its
decision
making
claiming
prices
should
be
lower
in
november
trump
tweeted
that
he
hoped
opec
wouldnot
cut
oil
output
https
on
tuesday
international
benchmark
brent
crude
was
trading
at
a
barrel
at
around
london
time
et
down
around
percent
while
west
texas
intermediate
wti
stood
at
almost
percent
higher
oil
prices
have
steadily
edged
higher
since
the
promise
to
cut
supply
and
are
now
sitting
at
levels
not
seen
since
november
but
torbjorn
soltvedt
principal
mena
politics
analyst
at
verisk
maplecroft
said
in
a
note
tuesday
that
any
end
to
coordination
would
likely
add
significant
downward
pressure
on
prices
although
our
base
case
is
still
that
riyadh
and
moscow
find
a
compromise
to
extend
the
agreement
the
pact
is
now
looking
more
fragile
than
ever
said
soltvedt
the
political
analyst
added
that
to
save
the
pact
he
expected
saudi
arabia
may
even
have
to
settle
for
low
levels
of
russian
compliance
to
save
the
pact
verisk
maplecroft
estimate
that
riyadh
needs
a
barrel
in
order
to
fund
its
budget
while
in
turn
russian
president
vladimir
putin
has
claimed
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
moscow
needs
the
next
meeting
of
opec
and
oil
producers
takes
place
in
