versus

the

the

in

on

underscoring
expectations
that
oil
demand
from
cars
may
peak
in
china
in
the
coming
years
despite
this
data
global
oil
markets
remain
relatively
tight
because
of
supply
cuts
organized
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
some
producers
like
russia
the
group
of
producer
countries
agreed
late
last
year
to
cut
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
to
prevent
a
large
supply
overhang
from
swelling
further
supporting
crude
prices
have
been
sanctions
against
oil
exporters
and
iran
and
venezuela
traders
said
financial
markets
including
crude
futures
were
also
generally
supported
by
hopes
that
the
united
states
and
china
would
soon
resolve
their
trade
disputes
which
have
dragged
on
global
economic
growth
positive
signs
in
the
trade
talks
helped
boost
sentiment
across
markets
anz
bank
said
on
monday
at
least
partly
offsetting
the
supply
cuts
has
been
a
surge
in
crude
oil
production
by
more
than
million
bpd
in
to
a
record
million
bpd
and
there
are
signs
that
output
will
rise
further
energy
firms
last
week
increased
the
number
of
oil
rigs
looking
for
new
supply
by
three
to
a
total
of
energy
services
firm
baker
hughes
said
in
a
weekly
report
last

that
means
the

count
is
higher
than
a
