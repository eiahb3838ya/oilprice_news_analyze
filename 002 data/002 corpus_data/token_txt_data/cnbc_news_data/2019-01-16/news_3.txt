expectations
for
a
decreased
oil
supply
potential
chinese
stimulus
and
political
uncertainty
are
buoying
hopes
for
gains
in
the
commodities
sector
according
to
goldman
sachs
jeff
curries
global
head
of
commodities
research
at
goldman
sachs
told
cnbc
on
wednesday
that
the
bank
is
bullish
on
commodities
oil
and
gold
for
several
reasons
ranging
from
the
federal
reserve
signalling
it
will
hike
rates
less
aggressively
than

and
a
weakening
dollar
we
bullish
on
commodities

joumanna
bercetche
one
because
you
do
have
the
rising
interest
rates
anymore
and
in
fact
they
come
off
and
they
on
pause
two
the
dollar
really
strong
and
likely
to
weaken
from
here
as
opposed
to
strengthen
like
it
did
last
year
a
weaker
dollar
makes
oil
more
attractive
as
oil
is
denominated
in
dollars
oil
markets
got
a
welcome
boost
when
opec
and
its
friends
decided
to
cut
supply
again
in
december
another
push
is
coming
from
news
of
chinese
economic
stimulus
that
could
propel
demand
oil
prices
rose
percent
overnight
on
expectations
that
production
cuts
will
tighten
supply

stood
at
per
barrel
and
wti
at
currie
added
that
a
predicted
rise
in
chinese
demand
and
falling
global
oil
supply
also
added
to
the
bullish
outlook
for
oil
china
has
given
notice
that
it
stimulating
its
economy
and
then
you
have
opec
ready
to
cut
production
he
said
speaking
to
cnbc
at
goldman
global

conference
in
london
china
central
bank
injected
a
net
billion
yuan
billion
into
the
banking
system
on
wednesday
the
highest
ever
recorded
for
a
single
day
in
a
sign
that
it
willing
to
inject
liquidity
into
a
slowing
economy
chinese
economic
growth
is
driving
higher
oil
demand
