it

than

surging
prices
were

buoyed

the

said
it
expects
a
drop
of
million
bpd
in
opec
supply
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
from
a
year
earlier
however
the
global
supply
picture
remains
uncertain
oil
production
is
on
the
rise
while
the
seizure
of
libya
main
oilfield
by
eastern
armed
forces
this
week
could
soon
lead
to
its
reopening
but
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
iran
have
have
helped
to
tighten
global
supply
and
security
threats
could
threaten
nigerian
production
after
general

this
weekend
looking
ahead
the
prognosis
for
venezuela
and
iran
remains
skewed
to
the
downside
as
such
they
should
continue
to
act
as
important
pillars
of
price
support
the
same
however
cant
be
said
for
libya
said
stephen
brennock
of
oil
broker
pvm
this
risks
throwing
a
spanner
in
the
works
for
opec
rebalancing
ambitions
and
therefore
the
price
recovery
faltering
global
economic
growth
is
also
a
concern
with
signs
of
a
slowdown
now
abundant
in
europe
asia
and
the
united
states
which
could
lead
to
slowing
growth
