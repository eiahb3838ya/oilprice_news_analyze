and
this
week
announcement
of
a
higher
than
expected
cut
by
saudi
arabia
encouraged
investors
the
international
oil
benchmark
rose
as
high
as
pushing
past
for
the
first
time
this
year
it
slipped
back
to
by

up
cents
that
equated
to
a
percent
gain
keeping

west

exporting
countries
opec
and
allies
led
by

started
voluntary

cuts
last
month
aiming
to
tighten
the

top
exporter
and
de
facto
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
said
on
tuesday
it
would
cut
more
than
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
more
in
march
than
the
deal
called
for
sending
prices
surging
prices
were
also
buoyed
by
the
partial
closure
of
saudi
arabia
safaniya
its
largest
offshore
oilfield
with
production
capacity
of
more
than
million
bpd
the
shutdown
occurred
about
two
weeks

a

it
was
not
immediately
clear
when
the

merrill
lynch
said
in
a
note
the
bank
said
it
expects
a
drop
of
million
bpd
in
opec
supply
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
from
a
year
earlier
however
the
global
supply
picture
remains
uncertain
oil
production
is
on
the
rise
while
the
seizure
of
libya
main
oilfield
by
eastern
armed
forces
this
week
could
lead
to
its
reopening
but
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
iran
have
have
helped
to
tighten
global
supply
and
security
threats
could
threaten
nigerian
production
after
general
elections
this
weekend
looking
ahead
the
prognosis
for
venezuela
and
iran
remains
skewed
to
the
downside
as
such
they
should
continue
to
act
as
important
pillars
of
price
support
the
same
however
cant
be
said
for
libya
said
stephen
brennock
of
oil
broker
pvm
this
risks
throwing
a
spanner
in
the
works
for
opec
rebalancing
ambitions
and
therefore
the
price
recovery
faltering
global
economic
growth
is
also
a
concern
with
signs
of
a
slowdown
now
abundant
in
europe
asia
and
the
united
states
which
could
lead
to
slowing
growth
