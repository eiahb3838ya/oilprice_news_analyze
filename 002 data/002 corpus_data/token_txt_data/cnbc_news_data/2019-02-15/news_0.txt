oil's best start ever signals more upside ahead, but expert tom kloza sees the big gains fizzling
it
already
a
year
for
the
record
books
crude
oil
also
known
as
west
texas
intermediate
wti
is
seeing
its
best
start
ever
according
to
the
oil
price
information
service
tom
kloza
there
not
much
that
could
derail
the
rally
through
the
second
quarter
we
going
to
see
higher
prices
than
we
see
right
now
the
firm
and
global
head
of
energy
analysis
said
thursday
on
cnbc
futures
now
however
kloza
who
known
for
predicting
the
crude
collapse
said
his
forecast
comes
with
a
caveat
it
be
a
more
temperate
and
gentle
year
despite
the
robust
start
overall
he
predicted
to
be
cheaper
than
last
year
in
the
energy
information
administration
finds
the
average
price
for
wti
crude
was
a
barrel
the
upside
is
limited
to
about
five
dollars
a
barrel
or
so
which
is
probably
not
a
statement
you
would
make
in
february
and
many
of
the
last
ten
years
he
added
crude
typically
sees
between
to
a
barrel
of
upside
according
to
kloza
it
different
this
year
he
said
because
oil
was
oversold
in
december
right
now
he
believes
it
a
balanced
market
for
oil
you
have
a
lot
of
refineries
that
are
down
for
maintenance
and
yet
gasoline
prices
are
not
moving
higher
demand
is
not
moving
higher
and
that
means
lower
demand
for
crude
said
kloza
on
friday
wti
crude
rose
percent
to
close
at
a
barrel
a
three
month
high
brent
the
international
oil
benchmark
also
set
a
three
month
high
we
in
a
goldilocks
sort
of
situation
where
the
cost
of
finding
the
crude
in
the
permian
basin
is
coming
down
kloza
said
speaking
of
the
large
oil
field
covering
parts
of
texas
and
new
mexico
and
the
prices
right
now
for
crude
oil
blends
beyond
the
benchmarks
beyond
and
wti
are
actually
off
to
probably
their
best
start
for
a
new
year
in
years
