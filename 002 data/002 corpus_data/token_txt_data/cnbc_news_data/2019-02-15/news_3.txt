crude
oil
climbed
above

as

and
this

announcement
of
a
higher
than
expected

by
saudi

encouraged

the

the

brent
approached

for
a

the

exporting
countries
opec
and

led
by

started
voluntary
production
cuts
last
month
aiming
to
tighten
the
market
top
exporter
and
de
facto
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
said
on
tuesday
that
in
march
it
would
cut
more
than
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
more
than
the
deal
called
for
sending
prices
surging
the
cuts
come
alongside
involuntary
production
curbs
as
a
result
of
sanctions
on
venezuelan
and
iranian
crude
along
with
curtailed
libyan
output
because
of
civil
unrest
prices
were
also
buoyed
by
the
partial
closure
of
saudi
arabia
safaniya
its
largest
offshore
oilfield
with
production
capacity
of
more
than
million
bpd
the
shutdown
occurred
about
two
weeks
ago
a
source
said
and
it
was
not
immediately
clear
when
the
field
would
return
to
full
capacity
the
market
may
be
reconnecting
with
its
fundamentals
specifically
the
several
major
supply
chokeholds
that
have
stacked
up
in
recent
months
over
and
above
the
voluntary
opec
output
restraints
said
analyst
vandana
hari
of
vanda
insights
bank
of
american
merrill
lynch
said
in
a
note
that
it
expects
a
drop
of
million
bpd
in
opec
supply
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
from
a
year
earlier
however
the
global
supply
picture
remains
uncertain
oil
production
is
on
the
rise
while
the
seizure
of
libya
main
oilfield
by
eastern
armed
forces
this
week
could
soon
lead
to
its
reopening
but
reduced
exports
from
venezuela
and
iran
have
helped
to
tighten
global
supply
and
security
threats
could
threaten
nigerian
production
after
general
elections
this
weekend
looking
ahead
the
prognosis
for
venezuela
and
iran
remains
skewed
to
the
downside
as
such
they
should
continue
to
act
as
important
pillars
of
price
support
the
same
however
cant
be
said
for
libya
said
stephen
brennock
of
oil
broker
pvm
this
risks
throwing
a
spanner
in
the
works
for
opec
rebalancing
ambitions
and
therefore
the
price
recovery
faltering
global
economic
growth
is
also
a
concern
with
signs
of
a
slowdown
now
abundant
in
europe
asia
and
the
united
states
which
could
lead
to
slowing
growth
