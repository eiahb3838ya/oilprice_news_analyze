as traders tussle over tankers, turkmenistan slashes oil exports
feb
reuters
a
clash
between
trading
house
vitol
and
azerbaijan
socar
over
caspian
sea
oil
shipments
is
forcing
turkmenistan
to
slash
exports
of
crude
due
to
a
lack
of
tankers
turkmenistan
typically
exports
about
tonnes
of
oil
per
year
via
the
caspian
to
world
markets
mainly
from
fields
operated
by
the
uae
enoc
and
italy
eni
but
flows
have
halved
in
recent
weeks
six
traders
involved
in
operations
said
that
happened
after
turkmen
producers
decided
to
export
oil
via
russia
with
the
help
of
swiss
trader
vitol
and
ditch
the
previous
azeri
route
operated
by
socar
the
reasons
behind
the
change
are
not
fully
clear
but
trading
sources
attributed
it
to
pricing
disagreements
three
trading
sources
said
socar
had
raised
tariffs
while
one
source
said
vitol
had
offered
lower
tariffs
the
only
problem
was
that
vitol
was
lacking
tankers
one
of
the
sources
involved
in
operations
said
vitol
said
it
would
not
comment
on
commercial
activity
or
trading
socar
enoc
and
the
turkmen
energy
ministry
declined
to
comment
russian
pipeline
monopoly
transneft
did
not
respond
to
a
request
for
comment
eni
said
it
had
not
been
forced
to
reduce
exports
or
production
and
that
the
situation
was
stable
russian
energy
ministry
data
shows
that
no
exports
of
turkmen
oil
occurred
via
russia
in
january
in
february
only
tonnes
will
be
loaded
from
the
black
sea
port
of
novorossiisk
eni
declined
to
say
why
its
production
and
exports
were
stable
after
such
a
drop
in
shipments
or
whether
it
was
stockpiling
oil
in
turkmenistan
sunken
ship
socar
controls
the
caspian
largest
fleet
of
small
and
tankers
which
used
to
ship
turkmen
oil
to
baku
from
there
it
was
loaded
into
the
btc
pipeline
to
the
turkish
mediterranean
port
of
ceyhan

turkmenistan

dragon
oil
is
developing
the
cheleken
oilfield
with
annual
output
of
some
million
tonnes
eni
produces
nearly
tonnes
per
year
from
the
okarem
field
in
crude
from
dragon
oil
was
exported
via
btc
through
socar
eni
also
sold
volumes
to
vitol
which
in
turn
resold
it
to
socar
under
new
deals
for
this
year
dragon
and
eni
chose
vitol
to
export
oil
to
the
russian
port
of
makhachkala
where
transneft
is
taking
it
to
novorossiisk
upset
by
the
development
socar
refused
to
let
vitol
use
its
tankers
the
six
traders
said
everyone
is
free
to
defend
their
commercial
interests
said
a
source
at
socar
when
asked
about
tankers
vitol
has
secured
several
tankers
but
these
will
be
able
to
transport
only
around
tonnes
a
month
until
the
russian
system
becomes
and
opens
to
navigation
in
april
trading
sources
said
shipments
can
then
increase
the
caspian
tanker
shortage
was
such
that
vitol
had
to
charter
old
ships
including
the
grigoriy
bugrov
a
vessel
that
sank
in
and
was
later
repaired
these
vessels
were
chartered
on
an
exceptional
basis
and
only
after
physical
inspection
by
an
experienced
professional
vitol
is
extremely
mindful
of
its
responsibilities
in
respect
of
customers
stakeholders
and
the
environment
vitol
said
when
asked
about
the
bugrov
tanker
the
slowness
of
crude
exports
has
forced
turkmen
producers
to
stockpile
oil
throughout
january
and
february
the
six
trading
sources
said
storage
tanks
are
full
so
the
turkmens
now
face
the
risk
of
suspending
some
production
a
market
source
familiar
with
the
matter
said
stakes
high
despite
their
modest
volumes
turkmen
oil
exports
have
always
been
a
game
oil
is
bought
in
turkmenistan
at
a
discount
of
several
dollars
per
barrel
to
the
dated
brent
benchmark
crude
is
then
sold
in
the
mediterranean
at
a
premium
to
dated
brent
as
azeri
btc
in
case
of
shipments
via
azerbaijan
or
as
siberian
light
which
also
normally
trades
at
a
premium
to
dated
brent
if
it
flows
via
russias
novorossiisk
losing
turkmen
crude
means
lower
exports
via
btc
and
lower
crude
quality
a
trader
with
a
european
refiner
said
for
russia
getting
turkmen
volumes
does
the
opposite
it
helps
improve
the
quality
of
oil
in
the
pipeline
system
azeri
btc
crude
oil
loadings
are
scheduled
to
fall
some
percent
in
march
versus
february
the
situation
regarding
quality
was
not
critical
the
socar
source
said
negotiations
about
getting
oil
from
turkmenistan
are
not
over
we
hope
there
is
a
chance
that
we
will
get
some
turkmen
oil
volumes
