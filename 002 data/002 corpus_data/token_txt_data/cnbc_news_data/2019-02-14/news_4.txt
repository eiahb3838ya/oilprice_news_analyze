bp's vision of the near future sees renewable power and natural gas dominating energy
in
a
future
renewable
energy
becomes
the
world
biggest
source
of
power
generation
a
quarter
of
the
distances
that
humans
travel
by
vehicle
will
be
in
electric
cars
dominance
in
the
oil
market
begins
to
wane
and
opec
influence
is
resurgent
as
crude
demand
finally
peaks
that
is
the
vision
laid
out
by
british
oil
and
gas
giant
bp
on
thursday
in
its
latest
annual
energy
outlook
the
closely
followed
report
lays
out
a
vision
through
for
earth
energy
future
provided
government
policy
technology
and
consumer
preferences
evolve
in
line
with
recent
trends
bp
forecasts
that
the
world
energy
demand
will
grow
by
a
third
through
driven
by
rising
consumption
in
china
india
and
other
parts
of
asia
about
percent
of
that
increase
will
come
from
the
need
to
power
industry
and
buildings
at
the
same
time
energy
demand
will
continue
to
grow
in
the
transportation
sector
but
that
growth
will
slow
sharply
as
vehicles
become
more
efficient
and
more
consumers
opt
for
electric
cars
but
despite
the
increase
in
supply
bp
thinks
of
the
world
population
will
still
live
in
places
with
relatively
low
energy
consumption
per
head
the
takeaway
the
world
will
need
to
generate
more
energy
