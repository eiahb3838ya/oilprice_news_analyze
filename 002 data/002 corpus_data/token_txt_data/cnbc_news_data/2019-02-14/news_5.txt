saudi arabia's inclusion on european terror finance risk list could threaten vision 2030 investment
international
pressure
on
saudi
arabia
is
increasingly
being
deployed
by
lawmaking
bodies
in
ways
that
could
slow
foreign
investment
regional
analysts
say
on
wednesday
the
european
commission
ec
added
saudi
arabia
to
its
list
of
third
countries
that
have
strategic
deficiencies
in
their
laundering
and
financing
regimes
also
known
as
the
designation
may
not
stick
it
can
be
reversed
by
the
european
council
or
european
parliament
in
the
month
period
that
the
bodies
have
to
vote
on
it
but
the
move
highlights
a
new
willingness
by
lawmakers
to
more
intensely
scrutinize
saudi
compliance
with
international
conventions
and
withdraw
privileges
that
the
kingdom
has
enjoyed
until
now
as
a
result
of
the
listing
the
ec
wrote
in
a
statement
banks
and
other
bodies
operating
under
the
eu
laundering
rules
will
be
required
to
apply
increased
checks
due
diligence
on
transactions
between
individuals
and
institutions
from
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
more
than
other
listed
countries
to
better
identify
any
suspicious
money
flows
the
impact
of
the
commission
decision
really
depends
on
its
acceptance
by
other
european
lawmaking
entities
as
well
as
that
of
the
already
france
and
the
have
expressed
their
opposition
having
significant
trade
ties
and
weapons
exports
to
the
kingdom
and
may
attempt
to
reach
a
middle
ground
with
the
ec
specific
evidence
for
saudi
arabia
listing
has
not
been
publicly
disclosed
but
the
ec
cites
risks
posed
by
third
country
jurisdictions
which
have
strategic
deficiencies
in
their
regimes
that
pose
significant
threats
to
the
financial
system
of
the
union
