said

he
was
open
to
extending

the

disruptions
said
andy
lipow
president
of

associates
in

the

other

including

an

known
as

to
reduce

supply
by
million
barrels
per

from
this
year
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
he
hoped
the
oil
market
would
be
balanced
by
april
and
that
there
would
be
no
gap
in
supplies
due
to
sanctions
on
iran
and
venezuela
you
could
take
that
as
a
signal
that
saudi
arabia
will
continue
to
take
a
proactive
approach
lipow
said
sanctions
on
the
energy
sectors
of
iran
and
venezuela
have
helped
to
reduce
the
availability
of
the
kind
of
crude
oil
that
yields
more
valuable
middle
distillates
such
as
jet
fuel
and
diesel
rather
than
cheaper
fuels
such
as
gasoline
despite
the
restrictions
iran
crude
exports
were
higher
than
expected
in
january
averaging
around
million
bpd
according
to
refinitiv
ship
tracking
data
many
analysts
had
expected
iran
oil
exports
to
drop
below
million
bpd
after
the
imposition
of
sanctions
last
november
although
it
was
much
below
the
peak
million
bpd
reached
barclays
said
sanctions
meant
that
although
there
is
no
lack
of
resources
there
is
an
increasing
lack
of
access
to
them
however
price
gains
were
capped
as
those
supply
disruptions
were
offset
by
expectations
of
inventory
builds
in
the
united
states
amid
surging
shale
production
to
record
highs
crude

expected
to

the

said
on

shale
production
alone
will
hit
a
record
million
bpd
next
month
suggesting
little
chance
of
a
slowdown
in
overall
crude
output
bnp
paribas
said
surging
output
would
feed
into
lower
oil
prices
towards
the
end
of

to
dip
to
an
average

the
fourth

to
average
oil
production
growth
driven
by
shale

be
increasingly
exported
in

volumes
to

markets
while
the

economy
is
expected
to
witness
a
synchronised
slowdown
