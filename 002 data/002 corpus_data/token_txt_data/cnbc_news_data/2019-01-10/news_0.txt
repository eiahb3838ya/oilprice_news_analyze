oil
prices
slipped
on
friday
as
concerns
over
economic
growth
were
rekindled
after
talks
fell
short
of
offering
concrete
steps
to
end
the
trade
conflict
although
production
cuts
bolstered
sentiment
in
crude
markets
oil
prices
were
also
supported
by
comments
from
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
on
thursday
that
the
central
bank
had
the
ability
to
be
patient
on
monetary
policy

crude

were
at

down

from
their

however

on

china
said
three
days
of
talks
with
the
united
states
that
wrapped
up
on
wednesday
had
established
a
foundation
to
resolve
differences
over
trade
but
it
gave
few
details
on
key
issues
at
stake
including
a
scheduled
tariff
increase
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
imports
a
partial
government
shutdown
and
tepid
economic
data
in
some
countries
also
dragged
on
broad
financial
markets
if
we
experience
an
economic
slowdown
crude
will
underperform
due
to
its

china

the

agree
on

however
it
is
becoming
more
difficult

look
past
the
weak
readings
of
global
manufacturing
china
producer
prices
in
december
rose
at
their
slowest
pace
in
more
than
two
years
a
worrying
sign
of
deflationary
risks
that
could
see
beijing
roll
out
more
policy
support
to
help
stabilize
the
economy
however
investors
are
becoming
increasingly
confident
that
production
cuts
will

that

exporting
countries
opec
and
producers
including

bring
the

into

appreciation
will

the

will
be
marked
with
continued
volatility

solutions
said
on
friday
the
main
factors
we
believe
that
will
support
higher

are
the
winding
down
of
sanction
waivers
for
iran
and
continued
strong

from
emerging

iranian
