why the stock market is obsessed with oil prices
stocks
are
taking
a
cue
from
volatile
oil
prices
where
traders
are
looking
for
signs
of
a
recession
and
other
problems
in
the
market
according
to
analysts
crude
futures
and
stocks
have
been
trading
in
tandem
throughout
much
of
the
last
few
months
in
part
because
both
markets
are
concerned
about
the
same
macro
factors
rising
interest
rates
the
ongoing
trade
dispute
and
signs
of
slowing
global
economic
growth
crude
futures
performance
however
some
strategists
believe
equities
are
actually
following
oil
prices
which
serve
as
a
sort
of
recession
barometer
since
economic
growth
is
closely
tied
to
fuel
demand
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
collapse
in
crude
futures
essentially
amplified
fears
of
federal
reserve
rate
hikes
trade
tensions
and
the
pace
of
economic
growth
stocks
were
far
less
of
a
lead
indicator
and
more
of
a
concurrent
indicator
than
they
usually
are
said
julian
emanuel
head
of
equities
and
derivatives
strategy
at
btig
oil
really
got
caught
in
the
same
geopolitical
uncertainty
downdraft
emanuel
notes
that
stocks
bottomed
on
after
crude
hit
a
trough
on
since
their
intraday
lows
benchmark
oil
prices
are
up
about
percent
while
the
s
p
has
bounced
back
about
percent
the
price
of
oil
is
telling
you
there
is
going
to
be
a
recession
it
firming
up
to
me
that
the
feed
through
loop
into
equities
emanuel
said
s
p
performance
oil
prices
are
likely
to
head
higher
in
in
part
because
saudi
arabia
has
backstopped
the
market
on
the
supply
side
with
significant
output
cuts
said
francisco
blanch
head
of
global
commodities
and
derivatives
research
at
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
but
there
is
also
now
support
on
the
demand
side
following
commentary
from
federal
reserve
chairman
jerome
powell
that
the
central
bank
will
be
patient
with
future
interest
rate
increases
with
a
shift
in
fed
policy
direction
approaching
we
see
an
oil
put
being
triggered
within
the
forecasting
horizon
blanch
said
in
a
research
note
friday
in
other
words
we
think
that
the
global
recession
fears
priced
into
oil
markets
during
the
christmas
period
were
overblown
and
see
the
fed
acting
preemptively
to
deter
a
major
global
economic
deceleration
