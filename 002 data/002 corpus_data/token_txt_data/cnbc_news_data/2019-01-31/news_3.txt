on

showed
a

in

supply
to

stronger

eia
weekly

showed
that
imports
from
saudi
arabia
fell
by
more
than
half
from
the

this

saudi

the

of
the

countries
opec
which
together
with
some
producers
including
russia
announced
supply
cuts
late

aimed
at
tightening
the

and
propping
up
prices

this

are
also
causing
some
supply
disruptions
venezuela
oil
inventories
have
started
to
build
up
at
the
country
ports
and
terminals
as
pdvsa
is
finding
it
can
not
export
crude
at
its
usual
rate
due
to
sanctions
imposed
earlier
this
week
as
of
wednesday
venezuela
had
tankers
with
nearly
million

matt
stanley
a
broker
with
starfuels
in
dubai
said
the
combination
of
sanctions
against
oil
producers
venezuela
and
iran
the
supply
cuts
as
well
as
hopes
that
the
trade
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
china
could
soon
be
resolved
meant
oil
prices
would
likely
rise
further
there
are
just
too
many
factors
that
can
only
cause
the
price
to
go
one
way
and
that
is
up
stanley
said
despite
this
oil
remains
in
ample
supply
not
least
because
of
soaring
crude
oil
production
which
jumped
by
more
than
million
bpd
last
year
to
a
record
million
bpd
this
shows

high
commercial

rose
by

in

to
to

stockpiles
are
