both
cited
substantial

prices
were
weighed
down

a

china

opec
which
according

poll
pumped
million
barrels

down

bpd
of
venezuelan
exports
to
the
citi
bank
said
much
venezuelan
crude
oil
is
rated
as
heavy
and
requires
the
light
petroleum
naphtha
much
of
it
supplied
from
the
united
states
for
dilution
before
export
to
refineries
an
additional
bpd
of
venezuelan
oil
output
is
at
risk
due
to
the
lack
of
dilutents
a
result
of
the
product
exports
ban
with
immediate
effect
