reuters
oil
prices
edged
up
on
monday
after
evidence
that
a
recent
fall
to
lows
may
be
affecting
output
in
the
united
states
the
world
largest
producer
although
concern
about
the
outlook
for
demand
tempered
gains
brent
crude
futures
were
up
cents
at
a
barrel
by
gmt
while
crude
futures
eased
by
cents
to
brent
fell
percent
last
week
and
hit
its
lowest
since
september
while
futures
slid
to
their
lowest
since
july
bringing
the
decline
in
the
two
contracts
to
percent
so
far
this
quarter
the
price
drop
has
caused
shale
oil
producers
to
curtail
drilling
plans
for
next
year
the
boom
in
shale
output
has
made
the
united
states
the
world
largest
oil
producer
overtaking
saudi
arabia
and
russia
physical
prices
for
brent
have
also
fallen
in
the
last
six
weeks
driven
by
a
drop
in
demand
from
chinese
refiners
in
particular
which
has
weighed
on
the
value
of
barrels
of
anything
from
north
sea
to
nigerian
crude
the
recent
weakness
in
the
physical
brent
structure
can
be
attributed
to
a
broader
easing
of
purchases
by
asian
refiners
at
this
point
with
lower
intake
weighing
on
spot
assessments
and
we
can
expect
this
pressure
to
carry
through
over
the
coming
weeks

the

have
fallen
nearly

so
far

since

when
the

was
unfolding
the
trade
dispute
between

and

rates
have
brought
global

down
from

highs
and
ignited
concern
that
oil
demand
will
be
insufficient
to
soak
up
any
excess
