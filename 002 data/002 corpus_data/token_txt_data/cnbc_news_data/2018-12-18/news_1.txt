asian

markets
played
second
string
to
bonds
on
wednesday
as
a
spectacular
fall
in
the
price
of
oil
spurred
speculation
the
federal
reserve
might
be
done
with
tightening
after
its

is
sending
a
disinflationary
pulse
through
the
world
at
a
time
when
trade
and
economic
activity
are
already
cooling
that
has
only
added
to
pressure
on
the

to
abandon
its
commitment
to
yet
more
hikes
president
donald
trump
on
tuesday
warned
the
central
bank
not
to
make
yet
another
mistake
while
a
wall
street
journal
editorial
called
for
a
pause
so
far
the
futures
market
is
sticking
with
a
chance
of
a
rate
increase
on
wednesday
despite
recent
market
volatility
we
think
that
it
is
still
more
likely
than
not
that
the
fed
will
raise
rates
said
anz
senior
economist
tom
kenny
but
we
lean
slightly
toward
the
fed
removing
the
reference
to
the
need
for
gradual
increases
he
also
expects
the
median
fed
forecast
or
dot
plots
to
drop
to
two
rate
rises
for
next
year
from
the
three
projected
back
in

the
market
is
well
ahead
of
that
and
pricing
in
less
than
one
rise
in
talk
of
a
dovish
turn

a

said
michael
