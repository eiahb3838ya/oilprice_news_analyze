natural gas prices spike 13 percent on forecasts for long, severe cold
natural

from

toward
the
east
coast
traders
were
anticipating
the
cold
would
linger
but
weather
models
available
last
week
did
give
them
the
confidence
to
take
long
positions
in
natural

futures

natural
gas
prices
have
been
falling
since
the
middle
of
december
following
a
spike
above
per
mmbtu
in
the
fall
late
summer
temperatures
and
a
surprisingly
cold
fall
increased
demand
for
cooling
and
heating
last
year
causing
natural
gas
stockpiles
to
fall
to
their
lowest
level
in
over
a
decade
stockpile
levels
have
improved
after
a
warm
second
half
of
december
but
a
prolonged
cold
period
will
put
renewed
pressure
on
inventories
and
bid
up
gas
prices
says
meisel
it
currently
unlikely
the
cold
will
last
long
enough
or
be
strong
enough
to
push
inventories
toward
record
lows
but
another
move
above
per
mmbtu
remains
a
risk
you
would
need
to
really
sustain
this
cold
through
at
least
a
third
or
half
of
february
in
order
to
get
even
though
we
made
great
progress
in
the
storage
deficit
over
the
last
month
said
meisel
i
still
would
rule
out
if
the
cold
lasts
long
enough

in

the

had
seemingly
written
off

during

of
the

and
