set
in

a
vast
rollback
of
energy
climate
and
environmental
regulations
during
his

two
years
in

over
the
next

years
those
actions
will
face

incoming

chairs
intend
to
hold
a
series
of
hearings
to
pick
apart
trump
energy
and
environmental
policies
and
what
role
industry
insiders
played
in
crafting
them
the
trump
administration
has
targeted
dozens
of
rules
some
of
the
biggest
items
on
its
agenda
include
withdrawing
the
united
states
from
the
paris
climate
agreement
expanding
drilling
on
federal
lands

says
americans
can
expect
the

to
probe
the
financial
costs
and
public
health
risks
associated
with
interior
department
policies
under
trump
those
include
rolling

has
spent
two

giving
away
the
store
to
fossil

companies
and
republicans

congress
cheered
every
step
of
the
way
says

we
need
to
know
what
kind
of
impact
this
corporate
favoritism
is
having
on
average
americans
health
and
quality
of
life
