oil
prices
climbed
on
the
last
trading
day
of
the
year
on
monday
mirroring
gains
in
stock
markets
but
were
on
track
for
the
first
yearly
decline
in
three
years
amid
lingering
concerns
of
a
persistent
supply
glut
hints
of
progress
on
a
possible
trade
deal
helped
bolster
sentiment
which
has
been
battered
by
concerns
over
a
weaker
global
economic
outlook
brent
crude
futures
the
international
benchmark
for
oil
prices
rose
cents
or
percent
to
a

by

brent
declined
nearly
percent
in

two

crude

were
at
a

up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
wti
is
down
about
percent
this
year
crude
prices
have
been
closely
tracking
equity
markets
during
volatile
trading
for
both
asset
classes
last
week
investors
are
looking
for
bargains
in
an
illiquid
market
today
if
trump
gets
over
trade
issues
with
china
expect
economic
demand
to
surge
said
jonathan
barratt
chief
investment
officer
at
probis
securities
in
sydney
president
donald
trump
said
he
had
a
very
good
call
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
and
that
a
possible
trade
deal
between
the
united
states
and
china
was
progressing
well
china
is
still
the
best
bet
for
global
economic
growth
anything
that
severely
pinches
china
will
inevitably
hurt
global
growth
and
as
a
consequence
oil
consumption
said
sukrit
vijayakar
director
of
energy
consultancy
trifecta
the
current
downward
pressure
on
oil
prices
should
likely
taper
off
from
january
when
supply
cuts
commence
analysts
said
earlier
this
month
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
to
curb
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
starting
in
january
to
clear
a
supply
overhang
and
prop
up
prices
the
group
of
producers
may
hold
out
on
supplies
longer
than
reasonable
in
order
to
see
if
they
can
effect
a
rally
similar
to
this
year
vijayakar
said
brent
hit
a
high
of
a
barrel
on
and
has
fallen
about
percent
since
then
while
a
gentle
recovery
is
expected
for
prices
in
the
first
quarter
the
market
might
still
remain
under
pressure
from
swelling
production
in
the
united
states
which
has
emerged
as
the
world
biggest
crude
producer
this
year
shale
production
levels
would
be
one
of
the
primary
drivers
of
crude
markets
going
forward
said
benjamin
lu
jiaxuan
commodities
analyst
at
brokerage
firm
phillip
futures
the
market
direction
might
get
dictated
if
shale
producers
disregard
bearish
signals
in
oil
prices
and
push
for
higher
output
next
year
jiaxuan
said
energy
companies
in
the
united
states
added
two
oil
drilling
rigs
in
the
week
to
bringing
the
total
count
to
that
was
up
from
a
year
ago
