trump administration still might let iran export oil, and that could lower prices
the
trump
administration
is
leaving
itself
wiggle
room
to
continue
allowing
iran
to
export
oil
potentially
setting
up
another
catalyst
for
lower
crude
prices
later
this
year
the
administration
special
representative
for
iran
brian
hook
last
weekend
refused
to
say
with
certainty
whether
the
white
house
will
enforce
sanctions
more
strictly
on
the
islamic
republic
oil
exports
instead
he
left
the
door
open
to
extending
exemptions
that
have
allowed
some
of
iran
biggest
customers
to
continue
importing
its
crude
the
administration
decision
in
november
to
grant
sanctions
waivers
to
eight
countries
including
china
and
india
surprised
the
market
and
contributed
to
a
collapse
in
crude
oil
prices
