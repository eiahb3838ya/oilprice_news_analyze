the volatility 'nightmare' in the oil market is not over yet, citi analyst says
the
volatility
that
rocked
oil
prices
last
quarter
may
have
moderated
but
citi
global
head
of
commodities
research
says
the
market
nightmare
is
not
over
yet
the
bank
expects
oil
supply
to
tighten
in
the
first
quarter
as
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
cuts
production
but
citi
ed
morse
also
forecasts
a
soft
spot
for
demand
in
the
opening
months
of
further
complicating
matters
are
a
series
of
geopolitical
and
market
dramas
that
will
play
out
through
the
beginning
of
may
this
follows
a
period
that
saw
oil
prices
spike
to
nearly
highs
as
the
market
braced
for
sanctions
on
iran
prices
then
tumbled
more
then
percent
to
lows
blowing
up
trading
strategies
and
forcing
drillers
to
rethink
their
budgets
the
volatility
every
year
is
a
good
to
a
barrel
between
low
and
high
morse
said
december
was
kind
of
the
nightmare
for
the
world
where
the
swings
were
at
a
low
at
a
high
and
for
the
average
of
brent
we
not
out
of
this
there
no
real
range
that
we
think
is
going
to
hold
for
any
length
of
time
he
told
cnbc
squawk
on
the
street
on
monday
brent
crude
performance
oil
prices
hit
fresh
highs
on
monday
before
tumbling
as
much
as
percent
morse
chalked
up
the
daily
move
to
currency
impacts
and
expectations
that
closely
watched
crude
stockpiles
rose
last
week
in
the
coming
weeks
and
months
the
oil
market
will
have
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
moving
parts
morse
says
at
present
new
sanctions
on
venezuela
have
displaced
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
of
heavy
crude
supplies
meanwhile
the
and
china
are
holding
talks
to
settle
a
trade
dispute
that
could
dent
global
growth
and
shrink
fuel
demand
if
left
unresolved
major
oil
producers
led
by
opec
will
meet
in
march
and
april
to
review
their
deal
to
curb
output
and
drain
oversupply
then
in
may
president
donald
trump
must
decide
whether
to
renew
waivers
that
allow
several
nations
to
continue
buying
iranian
crude
we
have
plenty
of
potentially
bullish
moves
in
the
market
following
a
soft
patch
for
demand
before
the
seasonal
uptick
in
fuel
consumption
begins
around
may
says
morse
citi
expects
brent
crude
to
continue
rising
into
the
range
and
hit
before
year
end
that
will
be
enough
to
keep
in
play
another
wild
card
surging
oil
production
while
some
american
drillers
are
pulling
back
spending
after
the
price
collapse
brent
will
encourage
producers
to
allocate
more
money
to
drilling
says
morse
citi
sees
west
texas
intermediate
crude
discount
to
brent
narrowing
preventing
benchmark
wti
from
falling
below
the
range
we
think
that
enough
to
keep
production
growth
at
a
good
million
barrels
a
day
no
matter
what
opec
does
on
price
level
