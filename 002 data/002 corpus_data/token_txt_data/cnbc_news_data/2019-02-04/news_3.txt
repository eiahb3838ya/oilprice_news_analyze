feb
reuters
london
stocks
climbed
to
their
highest
in
more
than
two
months
on
monday
as
gains
in
oil
shares
and
consumer
staples
offset
deep
losses
in
miners
while
airline
ryanair
slumped
after
a
disappointing
quarterly
report
the
ftse
index
edged
percent
higher
to
its
highest
since
extending
a
winning
streak
after
the
fed
cautious
stance
last
week
and
jobs
data
boosted
confidence
but
some
gains
in
the
index
evaporated
as
the
pound
handed
back
initial
losses
while
the
more
domestically
focussed
index
ended
with
a
percent
gain
sterling
gained
after
a
newspaper
reported
that
goods
shipped
to
britain
from
the
european
union
could
be
waved
through
without
checks
in
the
event
of
a
brexit
on
wall
street
stocks
edged
higher
thanks
to
a
boost
from
technology
shares
ahead
of
alphabet
results
while
declines
in
healthcare
and
energy
stocks
weighed
in
contrast
british
oil
majors
shell
and
bp
held
on
to
gains
and
provided
the
most
support
for
the
main
bourse
as
crude
prices
earlier
hit
their
highest
so
far
this
year
on
supply
cuts
and
sanctions
against
venezuela
petroleum
industry
cyclicals
such
as
miners
and
dollar
earners
led
the
falls
while
consumer
staples
such
as
unilever
diageo
which
are
considered
safe
havens
in
times
of
economic
and
geopolitical
stress
were
in
favour
miners
broke
a
winning
streak
and
suffered
their
worst
fall
in
more
than
days
as
copper
prices
fell
on
concerns
about
slowing
factory
activity
in
china
which
is
the
world
biggest
industrial
metals
consumer
shares
in
ryanair
shaved
some
of
the
day
losses
to
end
down
percent
after
europe
biggest
budget
airline
blamed
falling
fares
for
its
quarterly
loss
and
warned
that
overcapacity
was
likely
to
continue
to
pressure
prices
on
the
midcaps
iron
ore
pellet
producer
ferrexpo
slumped
percent
after
it
said
its
auditors
received
bank
statements
from
a
charity
which
was
set
up
mainly
to
coordinate
its
corporate
social
responsibility
programme
that
contained
as
yet
unexplained
discrepancies
ferrexpo
was
the
worst
faller
ending
the
day
with
steepest
decline
in
six
months
in

moves
supermarket
chain
morrisons
advanced
nearly
percent
to
be
among
best
ftse
performers
after
citigroup
raised
the
rating
to
neutral
meanwhile
the
broader
picture
remained
bleak
with
multiple
downbeat
data
from
the
world
economy
a
survey
by
accountants
deloitte
found
that
major
british
businesses
appetite
to
take
on
financial
risk
has
fallen
to
its
lowest
level
in
nearly
a
decade
due
to
fears
of
the
hardest
of
brexits
and
rising
protectionism
growth
in
britain
construction
industry
also
dipped
in
january
to
its
weakest
in
months
as
brexit
uncertainty
dragged
on
commercial
building
work
another
survey
showed
worries
about
brexit
were
exacerbated
by
nissan
announcement
over
the
weekend
that
it
had
scrapped
plans
to
build
its
new
suv
in
britain
and
its
warning
that
uncertainty
over
britain
departure
was
making
it
harder
to
plan
for
the
future
the
nissan
cancellation
was
a
blow
and
reflects
the
underlying
reality
that
brexit
uncertainty
inexorably
impacts
business
confidence
and
hence
related
investments
