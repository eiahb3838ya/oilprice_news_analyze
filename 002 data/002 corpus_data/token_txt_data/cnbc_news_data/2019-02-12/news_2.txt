opec
said
on
tuesday
it
had
cut
oil
production
steeply
under
a
global
supply
deal
although
it
flagged
headwinds
confronting
its
efforts
to
prevent
a
glut
this
year
including
weaker
demand
and
higher
rival
output
in
a
monthly
report
opec
said
its
oil
output
fell
almost
barrels
per
day
in
january
to
million
bpd
that
is
still
slightly
more
than
the
expected
demand
for
opec
crude
which
the
producer
group
lowered
to
million
bpd
worried
by
a
drop
in
oil
prices
and
rising
supplies
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
including
russia
agreed
in
december
to
return
to
supply
cuts
opec
is
lowering
output
by
bpd
from
in
the
report
opec
cut
its
forecast
for
world
economic
growth
by
percentage
point
to
percent
and
highlighted
a
range
of
headwinds
including
a
slowdown
in
global
trade
some
recent
positive
developments
could
support
the
global
economy
at
its
current
level
including
the
recovery
in
oil
prices
possible
progress
in
trade
negotiations
and
monetary
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
opec
said
in
the
report
nevertheless
this
would
not
lift
the
global
economy
beyond
the
growth
forecast
with
the
supply
cut
delivered
in
january
opec
has
achieved
percent
compliance
with
pledged
reductions
according
to
a

calculation

past
standards
this
rate
could
rise

coming
months
