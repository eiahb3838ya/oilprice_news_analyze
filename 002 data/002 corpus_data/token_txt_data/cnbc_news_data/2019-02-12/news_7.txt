bp ceo bob dudley warns oil market uncertainty could lead to a 'real crunch'
a
flurry
of
intensifying
risks
could
trigger
an
energy
market
crunch
over
the
coming
months
according
to
the
chief
executive
of
bp
his
comments
come
at
a
time
when
energy
market
participants
expect
sanctions
on
venezuela
as
well
as
production
cuts
to
offset
a
potential
supply
glut
this
year
when
asked
whether
production
cuts
from
the
coalition
were
likely
to
help
stabilize
oil
prices
dudley
replied
well
there
a
lot
of
variables
here
and
there
a
lot
of
things
that
could
lead
to
a
real
crunch
speaking
to
cnbc
dan
murphy
at
an
energy
forum
in
cairo
egypt
dudley
cited
tragic
circumstances
in
venezuela
uncertainty
in
libya
rising
production
levels
from
the
permian
basin
and
the
impact
of
sanctions
on
iran
so
the
countries
agreed
to
reduce
production
in
the
first
quarter
we
do
even
really
have
data
from
it
we
will
have
to
see
what
the
data
looks
like
but
the
markets
feel
tight
to
me
we
plan
bp
on
a
sort
of
fairway
which
i
think
is
good
for
the
world
between
a
barrel
and
that
good
for
producers
and
consumers
dudley
said
brent
crude
the
international
benchmark
for
oil
prices
was
trading
at
a
barrel
tuesday
morning
up
percent
while
west
texas
intermediate
wti
stood
at
percent
higher
