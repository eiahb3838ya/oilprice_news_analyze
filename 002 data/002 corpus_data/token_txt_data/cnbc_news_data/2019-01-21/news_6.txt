that

said
the

cuts
led
by

will
move
the

that

hughes
said
in
a
weekly
report
on
friday
it
was
biggest
decline
since
february
as
drillers
reacted
to
the
plunge
in
crude
prices
late
last
year
however
crude
oil
production
still
rose
by
more
than
million
bpd
in
to
a
record
million
bpd
with
the
rig
count
stalling
last
year
growth
rate
is
unlikely
to
be
repeated
in
although
most
analysts
expect
annual
production
to
average
well
over
million
bpd
making
the
united
states
the
world
biggest
oil
producer
ahead
of
russia
and
