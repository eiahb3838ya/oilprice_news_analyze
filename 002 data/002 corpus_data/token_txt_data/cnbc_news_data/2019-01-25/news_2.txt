economic
woes
weighed
on
sentiment
the
united
states
signaled
on
thursday
it
may
impose
sanctions
on
venezuelan
exports
after
recognizing
opposition
leader
juan
guaido
as
interim
president
this
week
prompting
president
nicholas
maduro
to
cut
ties
with
washington
but
the
ongoing
trade
dispute
and
broader
gloom
over
world
economic
growth
put
