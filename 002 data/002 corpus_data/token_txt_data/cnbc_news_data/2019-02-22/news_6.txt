countries
opec
opec
and
some
producers
such
as
russia
agreed
late
last

to
cut
output
by
million
bpd
to
prevent
a
large
supply
overhang
from
growing
surging
crude
oil
production
which
the
energy
information
administration
eia
said
reached
million
bpd
for
the
first
time
last
week
is
partly
offsetting
the
opec
cuts
that
means
crude
output
has
soared
by
almost
million
bpd
since
the
start
of

by
a
whopping
million

said
it
expected

more
than
offsetting
the

cuts
that
means
much
will
depend
on

which
goldman

it
