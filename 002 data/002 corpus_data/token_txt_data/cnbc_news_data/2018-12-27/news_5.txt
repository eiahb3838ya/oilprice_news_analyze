oil market volatility seen continuing into the new year
investors
hoping
for
serenity
in
the
new
year
should
probably
avoid
the
oil
market
energy
analysts
say
the
volatility
gripping
the
sector
is
likely
to
continue
beyond
the
holidays
the
oil
price
moves
this
week
have
been
spectacular
even
for
a
market
that
has
seen
the
cost
of
crude
spike
to
nearly
highs
in
early
october
and
lose
almost
half
of
its
value
by
late
december
west
texas
intermediate
crude
plunged
to
an
low
at
on
monday
shedding
more
than
a
barrel
in
just
five
days
on
wednesday
the
contract
rallied
nearly
percent
to
posting
its
best
daily
performance
in
more
than
two
years
by
thursday
crude
was
once
again
deteriorating
slipping
percent
and
falling
back
below
a
barrel
to
be
sure
the
wild
swings
can
be
explained
in
part
by
thin
trading
during
the
week
of
christmas
tamar
essner
director
of
energy
and
utilities
at
nasdaq
corporate
solutions
said
the
low
liquidity
during
the
holiday
week
is
exaggerating
the
volatility
and
causing
irrational
price
action
as
the
market
has
no
confidence
about
anything
now
however
investors
may
have
to
endure
the
roller
coaster
ride
even
after
traders
return
to
their
desks
according
to
dominic
schnider
head
of
commodity
and
forex
at
ubs
i
think
the
volatility
in
the
short
term
is
here
definitely
because
we
need
some
confirmation
that
prices
will
rise
and
that
confirmation
ultimately
comes
from
inventory
in
the
going
down
further
schnider
told
cnbc
squawk
box
in
asia
stockpiles
of
crude
held
in
the
united
states
began
building
up
in
september
they
now
sit
about
percent
above
the
average
for
inventory
levels
stocks
began
ticking
lower
four
weeks
ago
but
the
oil
market
needs
to
see
a
stronger
downtrend
before
it
rallies
says
schnider
once
we
get
that
confirmation
somewhere
in
the
first
quarter
i
think
the
volatility
in
the
oil
market
should
come
down
and
that
why
it
the
time
to
position
towards
higher
prices

said
