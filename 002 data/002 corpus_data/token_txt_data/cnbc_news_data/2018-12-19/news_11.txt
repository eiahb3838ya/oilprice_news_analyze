the
sale
declined
to
comment
carlyle
and
warburg
pincus

investors
have
been
stepping
up
pressure
on
publicly
traded
oil
firms
to
curb
spending
and
boost
returns
that
pressure
is
taking
public
companies
out
of
the
universe
of
buyers
in
the
market
creating
opportunities
for
companies

private
equity
firms
such
as
ascent
resources
aethon
energy
management
and
encino
acquisition
partners
have
all
made
large
purchases
of
assets
this
year
bp
is
offering
seven
packages
all
of
them
consisting
of
shale
assets
it
held
before
the
bhp
deal
two
of
the
sources
said
those
include
fields
in
the
san
juan
basin
which
straddles
the
mexico
border
the
cotton
valley
field
in
east
texas
the
arkoma
and
anadarko
basins
in
oklahoma
and
the
wamsutter
basin
in
wyoming
there
are
a
small
number
of
stakes
being
offloaded
the
sources
said
the
most
attractive
pieces
are
thought
to
be
the
san
juan
assets
which
include
around
operated
and
wells
and
were
the
backbone
of
bp
onshore
operations
prior
to
the
bhp
deal
along
with
the
wamsutter
basin
the
sales
document
says
the
entire
portfolio
generates
around
million
in
operating
cashflow
a
year
most
of
the
assets
are
which
could
deter
some
investors
at
a
time
when
the
abundance
of
gas
production
across
the
united
states
has
pushed
down
prices
for
the
fuel
the
permian
encompassing
parts
of
texas
and
new
mexico
is
at
the
heart
of
the
shale
boom
and
has
some
of
the
lowest
production
costs
in
north
america
which
is
valuable
when
wti
crude
prices
have
slumped
almost
percent
since
reaching
a
peak
in
october
shale
production
is
forecast
to
hit
million
bpd
in
january
according
to
the
energy
department
as
hydraulic
fracturing
or
fracking
drives
output
to
a
record
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
making
it
the
world
biggest
crude
producer
