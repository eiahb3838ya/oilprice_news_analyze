cramer remix: if you absolutely have to dabble in chinese stocks, stick with this one
chinese
stocks
especially
ones
that
are
new
to
markets
may
seem
like
appealing
investments
but
to
cnbc
jim
cramer
most
of
them
are
worth
the
risk
in
chinese
companies
had
initial
public
offerings
on
stock
exchanges
up
from
the
year
before
the
deals
raised
about
billion
in
gross
proceeds
accounting
for
roughly
percent
of
the
ipo
market
but
aside
from
a
few
decent
names
like
tencent
music
entertainment
which
cramer
tentatively
recommended
after
its
ipo
in
december
investors
should
steer
clear
of
this
volatile
group
the
mad
money
host
said
still
there
are
some
exceptions
he
told
investors
monday
larger
companies
from
china
with
higher
profiles
do
tend
to
perform
better
if
you
absolutely
have
to
dabble
in
chinese
ipos
please
stick
with
the
larger
companies
that
we
know
more
about
that
even
can
be
household
names
like
alibaba
but
even
with
alibaba
he
insisted
that
you
should
invest
only
if
you
want
to
go
there
