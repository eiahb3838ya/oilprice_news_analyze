to

despite
its
slow
start
expressing
confidence
monday
that
the
world
exporter
would
come
through
we
committed
both
to
the
agreement
in
december
all
indications
so
far
so
good
the
russians
have
promised
me
that
they
will
pick
up
the
pace
energy
minister
khalid
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
in
riyadh
on
monday
opec
members
along
with
several
other
countries
in
december
agreed
on
output
cuts
totaling
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
order
to
stem
a
sinking
market
and
support
their
own
economies
opec
plus
refers
to
the
group
cooperation
with
the
producers
like
russia
and
other
former
soviet
states
russia
was
more
reluctant
to
cut
its
output
as
its
growth
is
heavily
dependent
on
robust
crude
exports
russia
has
initially
let
the
saudis
shoulder
the
bulk
of
output
cuts
the
top
opec
ally
which
in
late
began
a
cooperation
agreement
with
riyadh
to
stabilize
oil
prices
has
often
said
that
per
barrel
is
enough
to
meet
its
economic
needs
moscow
in
december
said
it
would
cut
production
by
to
barrels
per
day
in
january
whereas
saudi
arabia
reportedly
pledged
to
cut
by
barrels

day
compared
with
november
levels
russia
pumped
a
record
million
bpd
in
december
an
increase
of
bpd
on
the
previous
month
its
energy
ministry
reported
in
early
january
saudi
arabia
crude
output
by
contrast
fell
by
more
than
bpd
from
november
to
december
global
benchmark
brent
crude
has
bounced
back
percent
from
its
late
december
rout
but
is
still
far
from
the
more
than
per
barrel
highs
it
witnessed
in
october
brent
was
trading
at
a
