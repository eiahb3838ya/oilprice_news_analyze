here's the most important thing going on in the oil market, according to oil guru who predicted past declines
the
most
important
trend
happening
in
the
oil
market
has
to
do
with
china

guru
and
rbn

consultant
rusty
braziel
tells
cnbc
jim
cramer
braziel
a
frequent
mad
money
guest
who
has
correctly
predicted
several
oil
price
collapses
in
recent
years
referenced
the
commodity
price
drop
in
october
of
last
year
after
starting
the
month
near
highs
crude
oil
prices
saw
their
biggest
monthly
drop
in
over
two
years
since
october
oil
prices
have
been
trading
lower
a
trend
some
have
connected
to
incipient
economic
weakness
in
china
while
cramer
was
convinced
by
that
line
of
thinking
braziel
said
in
a
monday
interview
that
it
actually
had
merit
if
demand
in
china
is
down
if
the
economy
in
china
is
down
that
means
the
total
demand
for
crude
oil
is
going
to
be
down
if
crude
oil
demand
drops
then
total
demand
drops
then
crude
oil
prices
are
likely
to
decline
too
braziel
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
really
the
most
important
thing
that
going
on
right
now
and
it
what
happened
back
in
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
crude
oil
prices
saw
a
steep
decline
during
a
worldwide
oil
glut
in
which
global
production
exceeded
demand
from
their
highs
in
june
to
their
troughs
in
december
they
lost
over
percent
in
market
value
in
the
economy
got
weaker
and
when
that
happened
the
market
lost
confidence
in
its
ability
to
absorb
incremental
production
of
crude
oil
from
the
united
states
braziel
explained
that
exactly
what
happened
in
october
as
for
where
oil
going
next
braziel
answer
was
quite
as
colorful
but
it
could
come
as
a
relief
to
energy
the
market
has
recognized
that
it

never
