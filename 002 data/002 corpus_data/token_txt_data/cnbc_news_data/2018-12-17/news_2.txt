for

since

crude

fell
after
inventories
at
the
storage
hub
of
cushing
oklahoma
rose
by
more
than
million
barrels
from
to
traders
said
citing
data
from
market
intelligence
firm
genscape
traders
and
market
participants
closely
watch
supplies
at
the
hub
because
it
is
the
delivery
point
for
the
futures
contract
and
underpins
nearly
all
other
regional
crude
grades
the
cushing
number
came
in
higher
than
anticipated
it
definitely
pointing
to
the
concern
that
there
more
supply
and

is
weakening
said

group
in

a
lot
of
the
shale
producers
ca
make
money
where
prices
are
right
now
let
alone
below
so
we
going
to
see
a
cutback
in
some
of
the
production
estimates
but
it
takes
time
for
that
to
happen
right
now
we
definitely
following
the
continued
weakness
in
momentum
increasing
concerns
about
weakening
growth
in
major
markets
such
as
china
and
europe
have
also
dampened
the
mood
in
oil
and
other
asset
classes
broad
stock
market
declines
in
europe
and
the
united
states
on
monday
dragged
equity
markets
lower
around
the
world
adding
to
a
that
has
sent
global
shares
near
lows
both
crude
and
brent
crude
benchmarks
fell
more
than
percent
from
early
october
through
the
end
of
november
as
the
supply
glut
inflated
global
inventories
but
they
have
stabilised
over
the
last
three
weeks
trading
within
fairly
narrow
ranges
as
oil
producers
promised
to
cut
production
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
and
its
allies
have
agreed
to
reduce
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
january
in
a
move
to
be
reviewed
at
a
meeting
in
april
united
arab
emirates
energy
minister
suhail
told
reporters
in
dubai
on
monday
that
the
oil
market
was
correcting
and
he
expected
everyone
to
stick
to
the
plan
some
investors
doubt
the
planned
cuts
would
be
enough
to
rebalance
markets
however
shale
output
is
growing
steadily
taking
market
share
from
the
big
middle
east
oil
producers
in
opec
and
making
it
harder
for
them
to
balance
their
budgets
oil
production
from
seven
major
shale
basins
is
expected
to
surpass
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
energy
information
administration
said
in
a
monthly
report
on
monday
as
inventories
at
cushing
rise
crude
futures
traded
as
much
as
cents
below
the
second
month
the
widest
level
since
october
russian
oil
output
has
been
at
a
record
high
of
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
december
so
far
an
industry
source
familiar
with
the
data
told
reuters
chinese
oil
refinery
throughput
in
november
fell
from
october
suggesting
an
easing
in
oil
demand
while
the
country
industrial
output
rose
the
least
in
nearly
three
years
as
the
economy
continued
to
lose
momentum
