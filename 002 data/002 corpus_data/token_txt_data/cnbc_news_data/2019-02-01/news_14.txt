on

torn

the

could

new

raising

were
supported
as
president
donald
trump
said
on
thursday
he
would
meet
with
chinese
president
xi
jinping
soon
to
try
to
seal
a
comprehensive
trade
deal
but
crude
markets
were
weighed
down
by
a
survey
on
friday
that
showed
china
factory
activity
shrank
by
the
most
in
almost
three
years
in
january
amid
slumping
orders
reinforcing
fears
a
slowdown
in
the
world
economy
is
deepening
despite
these
concerns
traders
said
oil
markets
overall
are
being
supported
by
supply
cuts
from
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
which
according
to
a
reuters
poll
pumped
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
january
down
bpd
from
december
in
venezuela
meanwhile
sanctions
imposed
on
state
oil
firm
pdvsa
this
week
are
keeping
tankers
stuck
at
ports
and
are
expected
to
accelerate
the
supply
drop
in
february
the
latest
sanctions
could
directly
halt
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
venezuelan
exports
to
the
citi
bank
said
much
venezuelan
crude
oil
is
rated
as
heavy
and
requires
the
light
petroleum
naphtha
much
of
it
supplied
from
the
united
states
for
dilution
before
export
to
refineries
an
additional
bpd
of
venezuelan
oil
output
is
at
risk
due
to
the
lack
of
dilutents
a
result
of
the
product
exports
ban
with
immediate
effect
citi
said
some
relief
especially
to
refiners
may
come
in
the
form
of
canadian
heavy
crude
despite
infrastructure
constraints
between
the
two
countries
the
alberta
government
announced
it
was
increasing
the
oil
production
curtailment
limit
for
february
and
march
to
million
bpd
which
translates
in
restoring
bpd
of
the
bpd
cut
announced
in
december
