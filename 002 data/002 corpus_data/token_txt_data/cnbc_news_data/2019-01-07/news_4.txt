momentum
is
coming
back
into

petromatrix

olivier
jakob
said
we
had
five
consecutive
days
of
price
gains
already
so
what
you
have
today
is
a
continuation
of
that
the
oil
prices
are
drawing
support
from
an
agreed
supply
cut
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
as
well
as
some
countries
such
as
russia
and
oman

bpd
to
million
bpd
a
reuters
survey
found
last
week
led
by
cuts
from
top
exporter
saudi
arabia
the
aim
of
the
cuts
is
to
rein
in
a
surge
in
global
supply
driven
mostly
by
the
united
states
where
production
grew
by
nearly
a
fifth
to
over
million
bpd
in
if
compliance
by
opec
and
the
allied
countries
is
similarly
high
as
in
the
agreement
two
years
ago
the
oil
market
is
likely
to
be
rebalanced
during
the
first
half
year
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
record
high
crude
oil
production
has
also
pushed
up
inventories
which
rose
by
nearly
percent
in
to
their
highest
in
well
over
a
year
according
to
weekly
data
by

tamas
varga
said
shares
have
risen
on
expectations
that
trade
talks
this
week
between
the
united
states
and
china
will
ease
a
trade
dispute
disruptions
to
trade
undermine
prospects
for
economic
growth
and

demand
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
it
had
downgraded
its
average
brent
crude
oil
forecast
for
to
a
barrel
from
due
to
the
strongest
macro
headwinds
since
societe
generale
cut
its
oil
price
forecast
for
brent
by
to
a
barrel
and
reduced
its
forecast
for
light
crude
by

a
barrel
