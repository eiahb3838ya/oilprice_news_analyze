the

hashem
hashem
said
on
tuesday
that
global
oil
supply
could
be
hit
this
year
by
big
reductions
in
exports
from
venezuela
the
trump
administration
has
imposed
sweeping
sanctions
on
venezuelan
oil
firm
pdvsa
aimed
at
severely
curbing
the
opec
member
crude
exports
to
the
united
states
and
at
pressuring
socialist
president
nicolas
maduro
to
step
down
one
of
the
known
risks
of
supply
shortage
in
would
include
the
continuing
decline
of
venezuelan
crude
oil
production
beyond
current
expectations
hashem
told
an
industry
conference
in
kuwait
however
the
wild
card
recently
has
been
market
perceptions
of
potential
shortages
mainly
from
geopolitical
pressures
that
have
caused
supply
disruptions
in
the
past
and
therefore
pose
a
real
threat
for
hashem
also
said
that
the
threat
of
a
trade
war
and
mixed
messages
from
the
united
states
on
whether
it
would
raise
interest
rates
is
causing
volatility
in
the
global
equity
markets
and
could
increase
oil
price
volatility
this
year
opec
russia
and
other
producers
an
alliance
known
as
agreed
in
december
to
reduce
supply
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
from
opec
share
of
the
cut
is
bpd
to
be
delivered
by
members
all
except
iran
libya
and
venezuela
hashem
said
actions
should
help
the
oil
markets
this
year
but
he
also
warned
of
the
impact
of
underinvestment
in
the
oil
industry
which
could
cause
a
supply
crunch
by
opec
and
the
producing
countries
have
successfully
provided
stability
to
the
market
since
and
reduced
volatility
in
oil
prices
the
resultant
prices
are
critical
to
stimulate
investment
and
growth
