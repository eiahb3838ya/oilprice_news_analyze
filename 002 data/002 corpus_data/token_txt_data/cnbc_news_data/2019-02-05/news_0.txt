some opec nations are reportedly trying to extend oil cooperation with russia for another several years
saudi
arabia
and
a
group
of
opec
members
are
reportedly
trying
to
commit
russia
and
other
nations
to
continue
managing
supply
for
up
to
three
more
years
the
coalition
reached
a
historic
deal
in
to
slash
output
in
a
bid
to
end
a
punishing
oil
price
downturn
the
group
of
two
dozen
producers
briefly
lifted
the
caps
last
year
but
agreed
to
fresh
production
cuts
in
december
after
a
collapse
in
oil
prices
opec
secretary
general
mohammed
barkindo
and
some
oil
ministers
have
long
sought
to
make
the
alliance
permanent
but
russia
essentially
nixed
that
idea
in
december
now
some
opec
nations
including
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
are
trying
to
lock
their
allies
into
another
several
years
of
coordination
the
wall
street
journal
reports
some
of
the
nations
are
expected
to
debate
the
proposal
when
they
meet
in
vienna
later
this
month
according
to
the
journal
it
is
an
effort
to
put
a
formal
framework
around
an
ad
hoc
relationship
helima
croft
global
head
of
commodities
strategy
at
rbc
capital
markets
told
cnbc
she
said
opec
clearly
does
not
want
russia
to
abandon
them
an
opec
spokesperson
was
not
immediately
available
to
comment
one
opec
official
told
the
journal
the
prospect
of
another
price
crash
is
pushing
coalition
members
to
agree
on
some
sort
of
arrangement
a
vow
to
continue
cooperation
would
support
oil
markets
because
it
would
reassure
traders
the
backstop
would
remain
in
place
brent
crude
has
rebounded
about
a
barrel
to
about
a
barrel
after
tumbling
percent
but
the
international
benchmark
is
struggling
to
break
through
resistance
around
a
barrel
moscow
is
better
positioned
to
balance
its
budget
at
current
levels
than
saudi
arabia
which
needs
brent
prices
at
about
a
barrel
to
break
even
according
to
the
international
monetary
fund
however
the
new
proposal
is
likely
to
face
opposition
from
within
the
coalition
iran
in
particular
opposes
steps
towards
institutionalizing
the
alliance
opec
sources
tell
the
journal
the
islamic
republic
worries
that
would
concentrate
in
the
hands
of
moscow
and
riyadh
its
chief
regional
rival
russia
and
saudi
arabia
are
the
second
and
third
biggest
oil
producers
respectively
in
recent
years
a
smaller
group
within
the
coalition
tasked
with
monitoring
compliance
to
production
quotas
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
has
increasingly
dominated
the
conversation
the
journal
reports
that
iran
and
member
oman
have
sought
to
reduce
the
number
of
jmmc
meetings
other
opec
members
including
algeria
angola
iraq
and
nigeria
have
also
pushed
back
on
the
idea
of
a
permanent
coalition
that
gives
the
saudis
and
russians
more
influence
according
to
the
journal
in
december
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
poured
cold
water
on
the
idea
there
is
a
consensus
that
there
will
be
no
such
organization
that
because
it
requires
additional
bureaucratic
brouhaha
novak
said
noting
bipartisan
legislation
aimed
at
breaking
up
opec
nopec
or
the
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
would
authorize
the
justice
department
to
sue
groups
like
opec
that
are
deemed
cartels
for
price
fixing
and
antitrust
violations
stripping
countries
of
sovereign
immunity
protections
currently
built
into
law
