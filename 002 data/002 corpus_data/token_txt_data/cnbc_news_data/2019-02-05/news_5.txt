wild price swings may be the new normal for crude oil markets as us, russia and saudis vie for influence
during
just
six
months
crude
oil
prices
ripped
higher
by
about
percent
plunged
more
than
percent
and
snapped
back
percent
an
intense
volatility
that
analysts
warn
could
be
the
new
normal
in
the
oil
market
december
was
a
real
nightmare
for
the
global
market
where
the
swings
were
at
a
low
at
a
high
and
for
the
average
of
brent
crude
oil
brent
was
trading
at
about
per
barrel
in
the
futures
market
tuesday
while
western
texas
intermediate
was
per
barrel
booming
oil
production
and
the
rise
of
the
united
states
to
become
the
world
largest
producer
has
certainly
factored
in
the
shift
away
from
opec
as
the
main
entity
controlling
supply
and
prices
in
saudi
arabia
led
other
opec
members
to
align
with
russia
and
other
producers
to
use
their
combined
clout
to
manage
global
energy
prices
another
factor
new
to
the
market
is
the
active
participation
of
president
donald
trump
who
through
tweets
and
comments
has
pressured
both
saudi
arabia
and
opec
to
let
up
on
production
when
prices
are
high
trump
has
also
moved
to
sanction
two
members
of
opec
iran
and
venezuela
impacting
global
oil
supply
in
this
era
as
in
prior
ones
you
can
have
a
year
or
two
of
stability
but
in
general
when
you
do
have
an
effective
swing
producer
and
you
have
big
imbalances
and
geopolitical
risk
there
volatility
said
robert
mcnally
president
of
rapidan
energy
group
i
telling
everybody
up
that
the
market
we
in
for
the
foreseeable
future
the
alliance
raised
production
last
summer
to
help
add
oil
to
the
market
ahead
of
the
iran
sanctions
and
amid
concerns
of
a
tight
market
russia
and
saudi
arabia
touted
their
joint
effort
and
their
broader
relationship
was
front
and
center
last
year
when
a
smiling
russian
president
vladimir
putin
met
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
on
the
sidelines
of
the
world
cup
the
new
dominance
of
the
united
states
in
the
oil
market
combined
with
the
alliance
means
new
tensions
and
the
industry
will
have
to
adjust
oil
supply
also
only
looks
set
to
increase
with
more
output
as
well
as
growing
production
from
places
like
brazil
the
could
also
be
in
a
position
to
send
many
more
barrels
out
into
the
world
after
infrastructure
projects
to
transport
crude
from
the
permian
basin
in
texas
are
completed
later
in
the
year
it
certainly
means
we
going
to
be
in
a
more
volatile
world
when
it
comes
to
oil
prices
i
think
it
means
more
caution
about
oil
projects
i
think
that
an
immediate
impact
said
daniel
yergin
vice
chairman
of
ihs
markit
i
think
the
oil
price
is
moved
by
what
happens
with
the
overall
financial
markets
it
means
sentiment
will
have
a
bigger
impact
on
the
oil
price
a
big
surge
in
oil
production
becomes
bearish
for
the
global
market
so
you
get
more
and
more
complicated
feedback
loops
