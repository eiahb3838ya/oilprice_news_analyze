chevron upgraded at ubs: a safe haven stock amid volatile oil prices
ubs
is
upgrading
chevron
to
buy
saying
the
oil
and
gas
giant
is
positioned
to
weather
a
sudden
drop
in
crude
prices
the
investment
bank
thinks
shares
of
chevron
could
rise
as
much
as
percent
based
on
its
price
target
of
the
stock
popped
or
percent
to
on
friday
oil
prices
plunged
more
than
percent
from
peak
to
trough
in
the
final
quarter
of
ubs
says
the
volatility
shows
the
value
of
a
conservative
and
sustaining
business
and
financial
model
embodied
by
chevron
despite
a
percent
drop
in
chevron
stock
price
during
the
oil
price
pullback
we
believe
that
that
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
shares
is
materially
unaffected
that
the
financial
and
operating
model
of
chevron
is
explicitly
constructed
to
cope
with
this
type
of
volatility
and
that
absent
a
material
and
structural
change
in
the
oil
market
which
we
do
believe
is
the
case
the
share
price
weakness
offers
an
interesting
entry
point
ubs
analyst
jon
rigby
wrote
in
a
research
note
on
friday
ubs
highlights
chevron
ability
to
fund
both
capital
expenditures
and
dividend
payments
with
brent
crude
futures
at
a
barrel
about
below
the
current
price
the
bank
says
capital
expenditures
remain
generous
and
chevron
debt
relative
to
equity
is
low
compared
to
peers
giving
the
company
the
ability
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
as
they
arise
chevron
asset
portfolio
is
also
enviable
in
the
bank
view
the
of
liquefied
natural
gas
projects
will
help
the
company
generate
cash
while
it
position
in
the
permian
basin
the
largest
shale
oil
field
reduces
risks
that
gives
chevron
time
to
consider
investments
in
fuel
refining
facilities
and
offshore
oil
and
gas
projects
