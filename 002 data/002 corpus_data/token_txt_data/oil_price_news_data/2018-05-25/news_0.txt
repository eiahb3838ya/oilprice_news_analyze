u.s. shale production may be plateauing
i
have
updated
my
scenarios
for
lto
output
based
on
both
eia
tight
oil
output
data
and
average
well
profile
data
from
enno
peters
i
have
also
created
a
scenario
for
the
niobrara
shale
oil
play
and
for
other
lto
which
excludes
the
permian
basin

ltofor
other
lto
much
of
the
output
is
from
condensate
from
gas
wells
so
the
analysis
is
more
approximate
and
a
discounted
cash
flow
analysis
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
post
the
average
well
produces
only
about
kb
over
its
life
but
in
many
cases
the
output
of
natural
gas
makes
the
well
profitable
there
are
some
areas
where
does
not
have
data
such
as
the
anadarko
basin
so
i
have
simply
taken
the
average
well
profile
for
areas
covered
excluding
nd
bakken
eagle
ford
permian
and
niobrara
and
then
found
the
number
of
these
average
wells
that
fit
other
lto
output
data
from
the
eia
including
anadarko
the
true
average
well
profile
for
all
areas
including
anadarko
is
scenario
below
should
be
considered
very
preliminary
actual
output
might
be
much
higher
or
lower
than
suggested
by
this
scenario
trr
is
gb
from
wells
completed
and
peak
output
is
in
for
comparison
other
lto
output
was
in
feb
so
increased
output
from
other
lto
plays
may
be
quite
small
