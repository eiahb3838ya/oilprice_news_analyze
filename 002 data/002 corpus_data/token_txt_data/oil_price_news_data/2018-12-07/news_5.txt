told

p
global

the
oil
terminals
shutdown
and
the
limited
storage
capacity
would
reduce

that
much
storage

is
critically
full
at

that
are
currently
being
discussed
with

boost
its

for
libya
which
earlier
this
year
suffered
several
production
outages
and
in
july
output
fell
to
just
bpd
of

thanks
to
field
and
pipeline
blockades
and
clashes
between
lna
and

at

its
