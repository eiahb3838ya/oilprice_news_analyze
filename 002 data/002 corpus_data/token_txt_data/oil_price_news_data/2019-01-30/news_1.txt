softer u.s. gasoline demand weighs on oil prices
the
latest
oil
price
decline
has
been
blamed
on
several
things
including
anxiety
about
the
state
of
the
global
economy
the
sanction
waivers
washington
granted
iran
s
biggest
crude
oil
buyers
and
of
course
oil
production
in
the
shale
patch
but
while
all
these
were
indeed
factors
pressuring
prices
one
other
factor
has
been
a
strong
headwind
but
has
stayed
out
of
the
spotlight
gasoline
john
kemp
brought
into
the
spotlight
this
week
citing
a
report
from
the
energy
information
administration
that
found
gasoline
consumption
in
the
world
s
largest
user
of
crude
oil
remained
flat
on
the
year
over
the
first
ten
months
of
that
s
right
gasoline
consumption
did
not
move
between
january
and
october
last
year
despite
an
economy
firing
on
all
cylinders
and
a
three
season
plus
relatively
low
prices
for
much
of
the
average
daily
consumption
of
the
fuel
kemp
reports
hovered
around
million
barrels
this
was
bpd
lower
than
the
average
for
what
s
more
the
eia
expects
gasoline
consumption
to
have
declined
by
bpd
over
the
data
suggests
is
attributable
less
to
any
economic
growth
patterns
and
more
to
a
consistent
decline
in
traffic
growth
kemp
notes
adding
that
there
are
two
chief
factors
at
play
when
it
comes
to
growth
in
traffic
the
economy
and
oil
prices
while
the
former
the
reuters
analyst
goes
on
has
been
positive
for
traffic
growth
this
has
not
been
the
case
with
oil
prices
for
much
of
the
last
years
and
that
has
discouraged
traffic
growth
over
the
long
term
related
seeks
to
cripple
venezuela
s
vehicle
for
embezzlement
yet
in
the
past
slow
traffic
growth
was
not
accompanying
by
a
booming
shale
oil
industry
in
its
latest
energy
outlook
the
eia
estimated
crude
oil
production
to
have
expanded
by
million
bpd
in
from
the
previous
year
to
million
bpd
towards
the
end
of
the
year
production
ramped
up
to
more
than
million
bpd
most
of
this
production
is
light
crude
the
kind
of
crude
that
is
refined
into
this
month
reuters
reported
excess
supply
of
gasoline
in
the
united
states
coupled
with
slow
demand
has
pressured
refiners
margins
noting
refining
margins
for
the
fuel
in
the
sank
to
us
a
barrel
last
week
the
drop
followed
the
fourth
weekly
increase
in
gasoline
inventories
in
the
country
all
of
them
quite
hefty
leading
to
an
high
of
gasoline
supplies
at
million
barrels
as
of
january
over
the
four
weeks
to
january
the
energy
information
administration
reported
that
gasoline
inventory
builds
reached
a
combined
million
that
s
quite
a
build
in
gasoline
inventories
and
provides
useful
context
for
price
movements
these
are
unlikely
to
become
a
lot
more
lively
this
year
despite
opec
s
cuts
and
this
time
it
won
t
be
gasoline
consumption
driving
them
it
will
be
the
global
economy
and
former
according
to
an
earlier
report
by
kemp
would
determine
oil
demand
growth
the
extent
of
the
slowdown
depends
on
whether
global
growth
starts
to
accelerate
again
settles
into
an
extended
soft
patch
or
falls
into
an
outright
recession
the
difference
between
each
of
these
three
scenarios
amounts
to
several
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
consumption
growth
dwarfing
all
other
influences
on
oil
prices
in
the
latter
relations
are
going
nowhere
it
seems
just
when
reports
on
the
topic
began
to
turn
more
optimistic
the
indicted
chinese
electronics
conglomerate
huawei
on
charges
of
industrial
espionage
violations
of
the
iranian
sanctions
money
laundering
and
bank
fraud
naturally
this
did
not
sit
well
with
beijing
which
called
the
charges
unfair
and
politically
refiners
will
in
all
likelihood
be
forced
to
continue
overproducing
gasoline
as
they
increase
their
middle
distillates
production
in
response
to
growing
this
demand
remain
growing
of
the
overhang
in
gasoline
will
stay
and
continue
to
keep
a
lid
on
prices
this
is
good
news
for
drivers
but
whether
it
will
be
good
enough
for
a
pickup
in
traffic
remains
to
be
