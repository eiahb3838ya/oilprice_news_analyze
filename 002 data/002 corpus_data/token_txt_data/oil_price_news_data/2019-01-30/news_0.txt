the major risk that oil markets are underestimating
the
campaign
for
regime
change
in
venezuela
could
drive
up
oil
oil
markets
barely
budged
last
week
when
the
trump
administration
first
recognized
juan
gauidó
as
president
of
venezuela
and
prices
hardly
moved
even
after
reporting
showed
that
the
effort
to
topple
nicolas
maduro
was
a
lot
more
coordinated
than
it
may
have
seemed
at
first
glance
oil
prices
also
largely
shrugged
when
american
sanctions
on
pdvsa
were
announced
earlier
this
by
tuesday
oil
traders
finally
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
the
campaign
to
topple
maduro
by
essentially
issuing
an
embargo
on
venezuelan
oil
exports
could
lead
to
major
disruptions
in
the
market
wti
and
brent
both
rose
as
sanctions
simply
bar
american
entities
from
doing
business
with
pdvsa
the
measures
could
wreak
havoc
on
venezuelan
oil
exports
refiners
import
around
bpd
of
venezuelan
oil
american
sanctions
also
dictate
that
any
revenues
from
oil
sales
would
be
put
into
an
escrow
to
be
managed
by
the
government
of
juan
gauidó
maduro
would
obviously
not
want
to
fund
his
opposition
so
oil
exports
to
the
will
essentially
cease
going
shipments
can
be
rerouted
to
other
buyers
around
the
world
but
pdvsa
will
have
to
endure
a
heavy
discount
even
then
there
are
only
so
many
refiners
capable
of
processing
venezuela
s
heavy
oil
related
refiners
brace
for
venezuelan
supply
crunchmoreover
venezuela
s
heavy
crude
must
be
blended
with
diluent
in
order
for
it
to
be
an
exportable
product
to
date
pdvsa
has
been
importing
diluent
from
the
that
will
no
longer
be
allowed
so
it
is
unclear
how
venezuela
will
manage
this
disruption
if
venezuela
fails
to
find
a
substitute
oil
production
will
have
to
be
scaled
back
commerzbank
wrote
in

of
that
venezuela
s
shipments
to
the
were
the
only
ones
that
earned
the
country
hard
currency
the
bulk
of
its
shipments
elsewhere
mainly
to
china
and
russia
are
sent
as
repayment
for
past
loans
in
other
words
pdvsa
does
not
take

cash
for
its
oil
shipments
to
those
countries
presumably
additional
shipments
to
china
russia
or
india
in
lieu
of
the
lost
market
in
the
gulf
coast
could
be
sold
for
cash
but
maduro
s
government
is
without
leverage
which
means
the
discounts
will
be
is
also
a
power
struggle
underway
to
take
control
of
pdvsa
maduro
still
has
control
but
the
jockeying
for
control
of
both
the
operations
and
the
bank
accounts
may
throw
up
unexpected
disruptions
the
company
is
already
in
serious
out
over
the
some
of
the
analysis
around
the
crisis
in
venezuela
has
been
described
as
bearish
for
oil
prices
since
a
new
government
could
end
the
mismanagement
of
pdvsa
and
revive
oil
production
in
relatively
short
order
but
that
is
magical
thinking
even
in
the
event
of
a
peaceful
transition
of
government
we
would
not
expect
rapid
growth
in
the
output
of
venezuelan
crude
in
the
near
term
it
is
likely
to
take
years
to
stabilize
output

standard
chartered
analysts
led
by
paul
horsnell
wrote
in
a
note
for
refiners
the
disruption
could
be
significant
as
standard
chartered
points
out
the
importance
of
venezuelan
oil
comes
down
to
the
quality
and
proximity
of
the
heavy
crude
rather
than
the
volume
venezuelan
oil
has
some
of
the
lowest
degree
of
potential
substitutability
by
other
crude
oils
the
investment
bank
offers
one
of
the
few
alternatives
but
is
constrained
by
a
lack
of
pipelines
canada
itself
has
had
to
incur
production
because
of
a
shortage
of
pipeline
space
in
any
event
canadian
oil
largely
flows
to
the
midwest
and
as
such
can
not
really
replace
missing
barrels
on
the
gulf
coast

oil
prices
rise
as
saudis
pledge
deeper
cutsbut
the
crisis
has
implications
for
the
broader
oil
market
production
in
venezuela
is
likely
to
decrease
by
more
than
the
shortfall
in
exports
to
the
us
of
approx
barrels
per
day
commerzbank

riyadh

keep
it
at

there

the
expected
decline
in
venezuelan

the
problems
in
