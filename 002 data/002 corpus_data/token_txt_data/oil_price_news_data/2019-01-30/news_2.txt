the only way for the aramco ipo is downstream
the
aramco
ipo
fog
has
been
partly
cleared
up
after
amin
nasser
aramco
s
ceo
opened
up
to
the
press
during
a
meeting
at
the
world
economic
forum
wef
in
davos
switzerland
what
some
already
expected
has
now
become
clear
aramco
s
much
anticipated
initial
public
offering
ipo
will
be
mainly
targeting
downstream
assets
even
though
nasser
did
not
explicitly
state
this
looking
at
remarks
made
previously
by
saudi
minister
of
energy
khalid
al
falih
the
picture
is
clear
as
al
falih
clearly
stated
the
only
one
having
ownership
rights
of
saudi
crude
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
the
kingdom
is
saudi
aramco
no
other
player
will
be
a
private
meeting
in
davos
nasser
indicated
to
mainstream
saudi
news
outlet
arab
news
that
the
aramco
ipo
will
be
held
in
which
is
several
years
later
than
was
expected
after
the
announcement
by
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
originally
the
ipo
was
expected
at
the
end
of
but
the
new
date
is
more
feasible
and
practical
for
a
couple
of
reasons
ongoing
diversification
efforts
of
aramco
the
last
years
as
shown
by
its
downstream
spending
spree
the
last
months
in
asia
especially
pakistan
and
south
korea
have
put
the
ipo
on
hold
at
the
same
time
aramco
is
fully
engaged
in
setting
up
external
financing
for
the
slated
sabic
acquisition
which
would
make
it
in
one
go
the
world
s
largest
downstream
company
for
the
kingdom
a
downstream
ipo
would
not
only
remove
transparancy
issues
with
regards
to
commercial
operations
of
aramco
price
settings
and
reserve
questions
but
would
also
make
it
easier
to
involve
foreign
partners
downstream
assets
also
could
and
will
include
international
assets
partly
to
support
higher
interest
of
investments
funds
and
sovereign
wealth
funds
related
oil
prices
rise
as
saudis
pledge
deeper
cutsnasser
still
did
not
refer
to
a
ipo
but
the
signals
are
clear
the
kingdom
has
changed
tax
rules
made
a
new
concession
agreement
changed
aramco
into
a
joint
stock
company
and
introduced
a
lot
of
fiscal
reforms
to
facilitate
a
listing
but
skepticism
about
the
transparency
of
the
saudi
national
oil
company
still
exists
the
first
next
step
still
is
the
acquisition
of
sabic
and
the
financing
of
this
billion
deal
advisors
have
already
been
contracted
while
the
saudi
sovereign
wealth
fund
pif
the
main
shareholder
of
sabic
is
positive
on
the
the
same
time
as
stated
above
saudi
minister
of
energy
khalid
al
falih
has
reiterated
that
aramco
will
retain
exclusive
rights
to
develop
saudi
arabia
s
oil
reserves
al
falih
said
there
is
no
intention
whatsoever
to
chip
away
at
aramco
s
exclusivity
and
its
concession
this
is
seen
by
some
investors
as
a
very
large
risk
even
if
third
party
assessments
have
now
shown
full
reserves
of
the
company
still
for
riyadh
the
position
of
aramco
and
ownership
of
the
oil
reserves
is
of
national
security
saudi
arabia
s
current
geopolitical
position
and
the
growing
investment
attractiveness
is
still
directly
linked
to
the
company
s
oil
reserves
as
shown
by
current
developments
the
oil
giant
is
focusing
on
downstream
jvs
even
within
the
kingdom
but
there
s
no
eagerness
in
upstream
jvs
security
of
the
kingdom
and
its
royal
family
al
saud
depends
on
the
oil
revenue
base
with
total
reserves
audited
at
a
total
of
billion
barrels
no
moves
are
to
be
expected
to
change
this
situation
without
full
transparency
in
reserves
and
commercial
pricing
decisions
as
aramco
is
still
to
be
considered
a
national
oil
company
the
only
way
for
an
ipo
is
also
will
need
to
have
the
full
ownership
of
oil
and
gas
reserves
in
the
kingdom
to
leverage
the
latter
for
its
or
even
trillion
investment
schemes
being
presented
without
this
no
major
diversification
can
be
executed
and
the
position
of
the
ruling
royal
family
will
also
be
directly
affected
a
cash
machine
like
aramco
s
upstream
department
is
simply
too
valuable

be
offered
