u.s. mandates biggest non-emergency strategic oil selloff
the
budget
deal
that
the
congress
passed
and
president
donald
trump
signed
into
law
last
friday
calls
for
selling
million
barrels
of
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
by
to
help
fund
the
sale
of
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
in
the
next
decade
would
represent
the
largest
of
strategic
oil
reserves
and
would
equate
to
some
percent
of
the
current
stockpiles
in
the
mandate
for
the
spr
sale
has
drawn
criticism
because
some
experts
say
it
would
blunt
the
purpose
of
the
strategic
reserve
to
mitigate
major
global
oil
supply
disruptions
or
price
shocks
other
critics
have
said
that
tapping
the
emergency
oil
reserve
for
needs
of
the
government
is
and
that
the
spr
should
not
be
used
as
a
government
the
bipartisan
budget
act
of
mandates
the
secretary
of

in
an

that
the

was

view
is
that

in

as
an

ensure
