oil majors undeterred by brazilian turmoil
turmoil
in
brazil
didn
t
scare
away
the
oil
majors
from
the
country
s
latest
offshore
auction
demonstrating
brazil
s
allure
to
the
held
an
auction
last
week
that
attracted
some
of
the
largest
oil
companies
in
the
world
including
chevron
exxonmobil
and
equinor
formerly
statoil
the
auction
comes
on
the
heels
of
a
crippling
series
of
strikes
that
had
briefly
paralyzed
the
brazilian
this
month
a
strike
by
truckers
disrupted
the
flow
of
goods
across
the
country
leaving
supermarket
shelves
empty
and
forcing
the
slaughter
of
millions
of
chickens
because
feed
couldn
t
reach
farmers
the
disruptions
were
motivated
by
the
soaring
cost
of
diesel
and
the
situation
presented
a
political
nightmare
for
the
brazilian
government
the
solidarity
with
the
protests
from
brazil
s
leading
presidential
candidates
increased
the
pressure
on
president
michel
temer
to
take
action
he
proposed
lowering
and
fixing
the
price
of
diesel
a
move
that
crashed
the
share
price
of
oil
company
petrobras
and
forced

trouble
for
the

it
offered
reminders
of
the
potential
pitfalls
for
international
oil
