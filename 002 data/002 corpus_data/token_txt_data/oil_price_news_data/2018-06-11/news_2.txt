opecâ€™s second biggest producer faces instability
a
month
after
iraq
s
general
election
on
may
the
political
divides
and
bickering
over
the
results
threaten
to
plunge
opec
s
oil
producer
into
an
institutional
and
constitutional
crisis
a
crisis
that
could
undermine
iraq
s
oil
policies
and
delay
contracts
and
investments
in
its
oil
hung
parliament
emerging
from
the
elections
was
already
sure
to
delay
the
formation
of
a
new
government
because
none
of
the
coalitions
and
alliances
won
enough
seats
to
rule
independently
the
most
recent
political
events
however
suggest
that
iraq
faces
more
delays
and
maybe
even
a
constitutional
crisis
which
could
significantly
impact
baghdad
s
oil
week
the
parliament
ordered
a
manual
recount
of
the
ballots
after
outgoing
prime
minister
haider
coalition
was
only
third
in
the
that
there
had
been
irregularities
in
the
electronic
voting
alliance
of
populist
shiite
cleric
moqtada
who
has
a
very
strained
relationship
with
the
united
states
scored
a
surprise
victory
in
iraq
s
elections
the
alliance
won
seats
in
the
parliament
so
it
will
need
to
form
a
coalition
to
govern
himself
can
not
be
named
prime
minister
because
he
didn
t
run
in
the
elections
militia
leader
hadi
came
second
while
s
coalition
was
only
parliament
passed
amendments
to
the
election
law
last
wednesday
invalidating
the
results
from
overseas
voters
and
most
internally
displaced
votes
the
parliament
also
ordered
the
independent
high
elections
commission
ihec
to
manually
recount
the
votes
nationwide
suspended
the
leadership
of
the
commission
and
replaced
them
with
nine
the
election
commission
is
opposing
the
parliamentary
order
for
a
manual
recount
and
said
on
thursday
that
it
would
use
its
constitutional
and
legal
right
to
challenge
the
amendment
of
the
election
law
allowing
the
recount
because
it
contains
a
number
of
irregularities
in
a
statement
carried
by
s
p
global
sunday
a
warehouse
where
half
of
baghdad
s
ballot
boxes
had
been
stored
caught
fire
and
pm
said
that
it
was
a
plot
to
harm
the
nation
and
its
according
to
interior
minister
qasim
not
a
single
box
was
burned
but
outgoing
those
that
lost
their
seats
in
already
calling
for
a
repeat
of
the
elections
the
coalitions
that
did
well
in
the
may
vote
oppose
a
of
the
standoff
between
various
institutions
and
coalitions
will
further
delay
the
process
of
forming
a
new
iraqi
government
and
probably
put
the
awarding
of
any
new
oil
contracts
on
hold
due
to
uncertainties
over
who
has
the
authority
to
sign
them
related
the
real
reason
for
higher
gas
pricesin
addition
some
of
the
lawmakers
have
said
that
iraq
may
be
better
off
out
of
the
opec
deal
and
that
the
country
should
be
allowed
to
export
as
much
oil
as
it
wants
some
of
the
new
are
even
calling
for
a
revision
of
the
recently
signed
oil
contracts
which
could
worsen
the
investment
climate
at
a
time
when
iraq
hopes
to
rebuild
many
of
its
industrial
sectors
including
oil
infrastructure
and
refineries
after
it
declared
victory
over
islamic
state
in
december
last
won
t
have
a
new
government
in
time
for
opec
s
meeting
on
june
at
which
point
the
cartel
is
expected
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
reversing
some
of
the
production
cuts
to
offset
supply
disruptions
from
venezuela
and
possibly
potential
factor
of
continuity
and
stability
in
iraq
could
be
the
fact
that
jabbar
the
incumbent
oil
minister
of
opec
s
producer
won
a
seat
at
the
parliament
with
wide
support
in
the
southern
province
of
basra
where
most
of
iraq
s
biggest
oil
fields
are
the
political
divides
and
the
prospect
of
a

constitutional
crisis

in
