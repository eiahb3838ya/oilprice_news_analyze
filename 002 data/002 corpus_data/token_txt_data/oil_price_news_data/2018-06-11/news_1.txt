russiaâ€™s oil sector is facing a massive tax overhaul
a
major
tax
overhaul
in
russia
s
oil
industry
is
about
to
start
pressuring
the
earnings
of
major
oil
companies
refiners
will
be
hit
hardest
as
the
overhaul
will
increase
the
tax
burden
on
downstream
operations
while
the
upstream
sector
will
see
taxes
shift
from
to
week
the
finance
and
energy
ministries
announced
that
they
had
agreed
with
oil
companies
to
begin
phasing
out
oil
export
duties
by
percent
annually
over
the
next
six
years
from
percent
now
to
zero
in
the
producers
are
happy
about
this

a
mineral
resource
tax
based
on
production

replaced
by
a
tax
that
oil
companies
say
will
stimulate
investments
in

their

writes
that
the
of
the
oil
export
duty
actually
seeks
to
reduce
state
support
for
the
local
refining
industry
which
has
over
the
last
ten
years
exceeded
industry
spending
on
refinery
modernization
by
five
times
this
success
is
largely
due
to
the
difference
in
oil
export
duties
for
crude
oil
and
oil
oil
product
exports
are
taxed
on
the
basis
of
a
percentage
of
the
crude
oil
export
duty
which
is
tied
to
the
price
of
oil
changing
that
will
save
the
government
some
us
billion
trillion
rubles
annually
from
subsidies
for
refiners
the
change
will
include
not
only
removing
the
crude
export
duty
but
also
next
year
introducing
a
negative
excise
duty
on
crude
oil
for
russian

that
will

quickly
raise
