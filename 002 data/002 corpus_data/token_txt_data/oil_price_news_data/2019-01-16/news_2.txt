trump takes aim at maduro, threatens oil embargo
a
week
after
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
was
sworn
in
for
a
second
term
in
office
the
option
of
a
complete
oil
embargo
against
venezuela
has
been
put
back
on
the
table
according
to
two
unnamed
sources
who
spoke
to
sources
also
said
president
trump
was
mulling
over
a
declaration
that
recognizes
the
president
of
the
venezuelan
national
assembly
opposition
politician
juan
guaido
as
the
legitimate
president
of
the
officials
from
the
administration
did
not
directly
confirm
the
information
cnn
quoted
the
spokesman
of
the
national
security
council
garrett
marquis
as
saying
the
united
states
is
currently
considering
all
diplomatic
political
and
economic
tools
in
its
arsenal
in
response
to
the
usurpation
of
power
by
the
illegitimate
maduro
the
last
time
more
sanctions
against
venezuela
s
government
were
discussed
actively
in
washington
a
source
from
the
administration
said
a
full
oil
embargo
was
not
among
the
options
the
fact
is
that
the
greatest
sanction
on
venezuelan
oil
and
oil
production
is
called
nicolas
maduro
and
pdvsa
s
inefficiencies
the
official
said
speaking
to
reuters
at
the
end
of
the
day
nicolas
maduro
has
taken
care
of
really
running
pdvsa
to
the
ground
and
essentially
more
and
more
making
it
a
interestingly
enough
however
despite
the
steady
decline
in
venezuela
s
oil
production
daily
exports
of
crude
to
united
states
refineries
have
remained
relatively
stable
according
to
the
latest
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
between
may
and
october
venezuelan
crude
exports
to
the
hovered
around
half
a
million
barrels
daily
while
this
is
substantially
lower
than
the
export
rate
from
the
late
it
s
not
as
low
as
it
was
a
decade
earlier
between
and
and
refiners

last
year
alberta
s
premier
rachel
notley
ordered
a
cut
of
over
bpd
in
local
crude
oil
production
to
prop
up
prices
it
worked
so
well
now
some
analysts
are
worrying
there
may
be
a
shortage
of
heavy
crude
on
the
way
as
saudi
arabia
is
also
cutting
production
and
when
it
cuts
these
analysts
said
it
cuts
mostly
its
heavy
crude
most
refineries
on
the
gulf
coast
where
more
than
half
of
the
world
s
crude
is
processed
need
heavy
crude
and
there
are
but
a
few
competitive
sources
they
can
tap
if
the
supply
of
heavy
crude
becomes
too
tight
for
comfort
which
may
well
happen
if
trump
goes
ahead
with
an
export
idea
of
an
oil
embargo
cnn
notes
has
been
previously
rejected
by
the
president
because
it
would
lead
to
a
jump
in
prices
at
the
pump
of
as
much
as
percent
this
is
not
something
trump
seems
to
be
fine
with
as
evidenced
by
his
reactions
to
rising
prices
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
of
last
year
and
his
urging
opec
to
stop
cutting
production
and
let
prices
go
lower
based
on
this
chances
are
the
president
will
stop
short
of
imposing
a
full
oil
embargo
on
venezuela
especially
amid
a
tightening

crude
