how much further can venezuela’s oil production fall?
ambivalent
is
the
word
that
best
describes
the
condition
venezuelan
president
nicolás
maduro
has
found
himself
in
from
a
formal
point
of
view
his
january
reinauguration
went
along
smoothly
and
oil
production
the
backbone
of
venezuelan
economy
has
managed
to
bounce
back
somewhat
from
the
trough
it
has
found
itself
this
autumn
yet
if
you
look
closely
navigating
through
might
turn
out
to
be
even
more
difficult
for
the
bolivarian
leader
than
surviving
the
arduous
year
of
international
pressure
is
mounting
including
caribbean
countries
that
thusfar
have
been
either
supportive
or
neutral
towards
the
venezuelan
political
leadership
all
the
while
pdvsa
still
struggles
to
become
a
normal
national
oil
first
let
s
talk
a
bit
about
venezuela
s
success
stories
after
the
steady
declines
in
oil
output
witnessed
in
the
first
half
of
plummeting
from
mbpd
in
january
to
mbpd
production
has
stabilized
somewhat
around
mark
pdvsa
attributes
this
to
the
improved
functioning
of
the
three
upgraders
operating
in
the
country
used
for
creating
synthetic
export
grades
out
of
the
bitumenous
api
crudes
that
the
orinoco
belt
yields
the
crude
upgraders
are
inevitably
linked
to
foreign
oil
majors
petromonagas
is
developed
with
rosneft
petropiar
with
chevron
petrocedeno
with
total
and
equinor
as
the
fourth
upgrader
fully
owned
by
pdvsa
has
been
out
of
operation
