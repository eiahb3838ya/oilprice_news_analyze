offshore spending to overtake shale in 2019

forecasts
offshore
spending
will
outgrow
spending
on
onshore
shale
activities
this
year
service
companies
exposed
to
the
offshore
subsea
market
and
the
maintenance
modifications
and
operations
mmo
sector
are
set
to
benefit
from
this
trend
current
oil
price
levels
spending
on
land
rigs
fracking
and
other
services
for
the
shale
industry
is
likely
to
stay
essentially
flat
in
the
offshore
service
market
too
will
feel
the
effects
of
the
recent
oil
price
slide
but
this
sector
is
nevertheless
projected
to
grow
by
a
robust
this
year
according
to
rystad
energy
many
would
expect
offshore
spending
to
be
cut
as
drastically
as
shale
but
offshore
budgets
were
at
a
low
last
year
after
four
years
of
intense
cost
focus
and
from
that
level
you
don
t
need
much
additional
activity
or
inflation
to
drive
up
the
market

oil
prices
fell

the
fourth
quarter
of
and
the

outlook
for

more
bearish
shale
budgets
for
next
year
have
been
cut
drastically
to
compensate
for
the
anticipated
loss
of
we
saw
the
tendency
already
last
month
that
the
shale
service
market
started
to
hit
the
brakes
the
number
of
fracked
wells
per
day
dropped
from
an
average
of
around
wells
per
day
to
wells
per
day
and
frack
service
pricing
continued
to
fall
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
for
the
full
year
of
we
expect
more
or
less
the
same
number
of
wells
completed
at
around
wells
and
we
do
not
anticipate
seeing
utilization
returning
to
the
levels
as
seen
in
early
martinsen
energy
expects
the
uptick
in
offshore
spending
to
be
driven
by
exploration
and
greenfield
projects
in
addition
operational
expenditure
opex
budgets
will
likely
swell
thanks
to
cost
inflation
more
fields
coming
on
stream
and
a
buildup
of
work
that
needs
to
be
completed

fears
of
shale
demise
may
be
overblownnew
research
from
rystad
energy
shows
the
inflection
point
for
when
the
short
cycle
shale
business
could
again
grow
faster
than
offshore
according
to
this
research
a
price
of
per
barrel
of
brent
crude
would
see
both
shale
and
offshore
grow
at
around
but
in
a
scenario
where
brent
climbs
to
per
barrel
the
shale
industry
could
achieve
an
impressive
growth

investors
now
need
to
position
their
bets
correctly
based
on
their
price
strip
assumptions
as
long
as
oil
prices
are
below
a
barrel
for
brent
it
could
be
interesting
to
take
a
second
look
at
service
contractors
exposed
to
the
offshore
sector
to
see
what
they
have
to
offer
as
compared
to
service
companies
exposed
to
shale

breaking
down
capex
and
opex
budgets
across
resource
types
and
allocating
the
spending
to
the
associated
service
segments

estimates

based
on
known
backlog
latest
contract
awards
and
regional
it
seems
that
the
names
that
will
be
able
to
deliver
the
best
revenue
growth
are
the
service
companies
exposed
to
the
offshore
subsea
market
and
mmo
this
is
a
clear
switch
from
when
it
was
the
shale
names
that
were
market
share
winners
in
