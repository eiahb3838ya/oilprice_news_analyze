high oil prices are already destroying demand
crude
oil
prices
have
gone
up
high
enough
to
begin
hurting
demand
for
the
commodity
the
chief
of
the
international
energy
agency
fatih
birol
said
as
quoted
by
reuters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
industry
event
in
noted
the
adverse
effect
of
higher
oil
prices
on
large
emerging
economies
in
particular
including
india
and
indonesia
saying
many
countries
current
account
deficits
have
been
affected
by
high
oil
the
negative
effect
has
been
compounded
by
a
slide
in
local
currencies
as
well
a
development
that
can
also
be
at
least
partially
traced
back
to
higher
oil
prices
and
their
effect
on
current
account
good
news
at
least
for
consumer
nations
is
that
this
situation
can
not
continue
indefinitely
and
with
dampened
demand
prices
should
go
down
as
well
at
some
there
are
two
downward
pressures
on
global
oil
demand
growth
birol
told
reuters
one
is
high
oil
prices
and
in
many
countries
they
re
directly
related
to
consumer
prices
the
second
one
is
global
economic
growth
momentum
slowing
in
fact
concern
about
global
economic
by
emerging
economies
no
weighed
on
prices
in
recent
days
it
has
combined
with
other
factors
such
as
a
stock
market
decline
and
rising
crude
oil
supply
to
push
brent
and
wti
down
although
despite
this
decline
both
benchmarks
remain
with
cumulative
gains
of
more
than
percent
since
the
start
of
the
signals
from
riyadh
concerning
production
plans
have
also
enhanced
price
volatility
but
it
seems
the
message
that
prevailed
is
that
the
kingdom
will
pump
as
much
crude
as
it
can
to
offset
loss
of
iranian
supply
which
has
in
turn
sparked
worry
about
supply
last
week
khalid
said
the
market
could
swing
into
a
surplus
next
year
which
may
have
contributed
