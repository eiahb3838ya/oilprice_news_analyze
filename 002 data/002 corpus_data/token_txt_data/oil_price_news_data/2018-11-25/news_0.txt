can opec+ halt the oil price slide?
oil
prices
continue
to
plumb
new
depths
but
some
analysts
think
the
selloff
has
gone
too
prices
fell
to
per
barrel
by
hitting
nearly
a
low
the
bearish
narrative
has
taken
hold
in
a
big
way
with
rising
shale
production
record
output
from
saudi
arabia
rising
inventories
and
faltering
demand
growth
all
combining
to
drag
down
crude
prices
the
bears
still
have
the
oil
market
firmly
in
their
grip

on
thursday
no
end
to
the
downswing
is
in
sight
for
the
foreseeable
but
are
prices
dropping
too
far
too
fast
some
analyst
think
so
t
he
oil
market
has
overshot
current
and
forward
fundamentals
goldman
sachs
wrote
in
a
note
on
november
sachs
believes
that
the
most
recent
selloff
which
saw
brent
drop
below
came
with
no
new
fundamental
data
suggesting
that
the
drop
reflects
a
confluence
of
factors
including
expectations
of
a
glut
in
speculative
trading
low
trading
activity
ahead
of
the
thanksgiving
holiday
as
well
as
the
broader
selloff
in
global
the
fundamentals
have
been
trending
in
a
bearish
direction
and
even
though
has
sent
signals
that
a
production
cut
is
on
the
table
other
bits
of
news
have
been
negative
libya
expects
to
be
exempted
from
the
production
cut
and
its
output
continues
to
rise
steadily
venezuela
s
output
fell
by
less
than
expected
in
october
iraq
and
kurdistan
just
agreed
to
allow
for
some
oil
up
to
bpd
initially
to
resume
flowing
through
a
kurdish
pipeline
if
the
tentative
agreement
holds
and
the
two
sides
build
on
it
another
bpd
could
will
take
a
fundamental
catalyst
for
prices
to
stabilize
goldman
argues
while
we
expect
prices
to
eventually
recover
we
continue
to
expect
high
price
volatility
until
evidence
that
the
oil
market
fundamentals
are
improving
requiring
a
decline
in
opec
production
and
signs
that
demand
growth
is
related
plunging
oil
prices
weigh
on
saudi
bondsthe
brent
futures
curve
has
flattened
significantly
and
goldman
argues
that
for
spot
prices
to
rise
the
futures
curve
will
have
to
move
back
into
a
stronger
backwardation
a
situation
in
which
prices
trade
at
a
premium
to
oil
futures
the
good
news
for
oil
prices
it
that
the
current
data
does
not
justify
the
recent
and
sudden
flattening
of
the
curve
goldman
analysts
argue
that
is
because
inventories
are
not
elevated
demand
growth
is
likely
to
beat
low
expectations
iran
exports
will
decline
further
and
ultimately
core
opec
will
reduce
output
in
our
but
prices
are
also
down
because
of
expectations
of
a
growing
supply
glut
in
shale
continues
to
surprise
the
market
beating
even
optimistic
forecasts
of
production
growth
supply
disruptions
continue
to
decline
most
notably
in
libya
meanwhile
the
expected
output
cut
form
will
also
allow
for
a
rebuilding
of
spare
capacity
reducing
supply
risks
going
forward
this
effectively
reverses
the
perceived
need
since
may
for
marginal
barrels
to
compensate
for
permian
bottlenecks
and
iran
export
losses

saudi

the
investment
bank
said
that
its
expectation
that
prices
will
recover
could
be
wrong
due
to
two
factors
first
the
global
economy
could
enter
a
downturn
and
demand
collapses
or
decides
not
to
cut
at
all
at
the
upcoming
meeting
which
leads
to
a
significant
supply
glut
heading
into
out
over
the
next
year
s
problems
get
even
trickier
they
could
decide
to
flood
the
market
which
would
likely
crash
prices
but
that
would
crush
their
own
budgets
meanwhile
shale
is
poised
to
add
a
flood
of
new
supply
next
year
as
bloomberg
notes
the
shale
industry
has
already
vastly
exceeded
expectations
in
and
shale
companies
have
not
slowed
down
they
are
drilling
new
wells
now
but
only
completing
some
of
them
e
ps
are
keeping
some

uncompleted
awaiting
new
pipelines
in
when
those
projects
come
online
another

of

could
be
unleashed
we
