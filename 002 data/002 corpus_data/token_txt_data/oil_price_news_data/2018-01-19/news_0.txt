the no.1 challenge to the oil rally
the

international

in
its

on

was
driven
in
part
by
some
unexpected
interruption
and
geopolitical
tension
including
the
possible
unraveling
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
the
closure
of
the

pipeline
a

weeks
back
disruption
in
libya
and
the

in

s
oil
also
continue
to
decline
for
the
time
being
and
even
picked
up
pace
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
iea
said
that
oecd
commercial
stocks
declined
by
million
barrels
in
november
a
pace
that
was
twice
as
fast
as
the
average
and
in
december
preliminary
data
suggests
the
declines
were
even
fact
inventories
declined
in
three
consecutive
quarters
in
on
average
inventories
fell
at
a
rate
of
bpd
which
the
iea
said
was
exceptional
s
uch
a
threesome
has
happened
rarely
in
modern
history
examples
include
prices
doubled
prices
increased
by
nearly
and
prices
increased
by
this
time
around
the
stock
draw
pushed
up
brent
prices
by
almost
per
barrel
the
oil
market
is
clearly
tightening
the
iea
the
biggest
oil
collapse
in
historyin
this
sense
it
is
not
as
if
the
surge
in
positioning
from
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
is
unjustified
the
underlying
fundamentals
point
to
a
real
tightening
underway
in
the
physical
market
for
crude
soaring
supplies
from
the
and
other
countries
threaten
to
stall
the
rally
the
iea
raised
its
forecast
for
oil
production
growth
this
year
from
bpd
to
million
barrels
per
day
that
comes
on
the
heels
of
sharp
upward
revisions
from
the
eia
and
opec
not
to
mention
a
slew
of
investment
banks
everyone
is
in
agreement
on
one
thing
shale
is
set
for
serious
growth
much
more
than
analysts
predicted
just
one
month
the
big
supply
story
is
unfolding
fast
in
the
americas
explosive
growth
in
the
us
and
substantial
gains
in
canada
and
brazil
will
far
outweigh
potentially
steep
declines
in
venezuela
and
mexico
the
iea
it
is
possible
that
very
soon
us
crude
production
could
overtake
that
of
saudi
arabia
and
also
rival
russia
russia
produces
more
than
the
eia
predicted
earlier
this
month
that
the
would
top
by
the
end
of
it
isn
t
just
the
adding
new
barrels
to
the
market
brazil
and
canada
are
two
other
countries
expected
to
post
strong
gains
although
unlike
shale
both
countries
have
projects
set
to
come
online
that
were
planned
years
after
factoring
in
some
declines
in
output
from
mexico
and
china
the
iea
sees
production
rising
by
in
a
figure
that
represents
a
return
to
the
heady
days
of
when
growth
averaged
the
iea
wrote
related
are
hedge
funds
pushing
oil
prices
too
high
for
oil
bulls
that
should
be
a
pretty
threatening
figure
because
demand
is
only
expected
to
grow
by
this
year
the
iea
acknowledges
that
its
demand
estimate
could
be
conservative
but
it
takes
into
account
the
fact
that
some
demand
destruction
could
occur
from
higher
prices
opec
pegged
demand
growth
at
a
healthier
but
even
that
figure
is
swamped
by
the
of
new
result
could
be
a
return
to
increases
in
inventories
testing
the
current
rally
in
prices
the
iea
sees
a
modest
surplus
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
followed
by
a
modest
deficit
in
the
second
half
as
such
forecasts
for
for
brent
seem
reasonable
but
that
we
should
expect
a
volatile
for
now
oil
prices
are
struggling
to
hold
onto
their
gains
brent
has
hit
the
per
barrel
threshold
but
has
fallen
back
at
that
resistance
