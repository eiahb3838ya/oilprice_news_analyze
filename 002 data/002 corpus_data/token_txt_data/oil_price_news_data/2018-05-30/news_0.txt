the oil giant that outsmarted trudeau
in
a
desperate
bid
to
keep
its
last
remaining
proposed
oil
pipeline
alive
canada
has
decided
to
buy
kinder
morgan
s
trans
mountain
pipeline
system
for
an
estimated
c
will
pay
kinder
morgan
for
the
money
that
the
company
has
already
spent
on
the
expansion
project
as
well
as
for
the
existing
trans
mountain
pipeline
which
has
a
capacity
of
about
mountain
runs
from
alberta
to
british
columbia
and
the
proposed
expansion
would
be
a
twin
line
that
would
triple
the
system
s

capacity
to
bpd
british
columbia
has
vowed
to
block
the
pipeline
even
though
the
federal
government
supports
the
project
bc
s
opposition
had
nearly
killed
the
still
might
finish
it
off
despite
the
gamble
by
the
federal
government
to
nationalize
the
pipeline
reuters
discovered
it
appears
that
canada
has
been
taken
for
a
ride
by
kinder
morgan
the
pipeline
company
structured
deals
in
such
a
way
that
it
couldn
t
lose
even
if
the
project
stalled
kinder
morgan
cut
creative
deals
with
lenders
and
oil
producers
to
shield
itself
from
massive
like
the
ones
taken
recently
by
rivals
transcanada
corp
and
enbridge
inc
in
canceling
controversial
pipeline
projects
reuters
deals
included
requiring
oil
producers
to
pay
even
if
the
project
was
blocked
by
regulatory
holdups
also
the
lenders
that
kinder
morgan
negotiated
with
agreed
to
exempt
the
pipeline
company
from
penalties
on
loans
if
the
project
was
delayed
or
obstructed
because
of
political
problems
related
the
biggest
challenge
for
oil
exportsall
of
that
made
kinder
morgan
more
than
willing
to
walk
away
putting
intense
pressure
on
the
canadian
government
to
resolve
the
dispute
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
first
proposed
to
indemnify
the
project
from
risk
but
ultimately
decided
to
purchase
it
outright

which
holds

told
reuters
that
s
a
very
fair
kinder

agreed
hailing
the
payout
from
canada
this
is
a
great
day
not
only
for
our
company
but
for
canada

and
as
for
who
will
manage
the
pipeline
project
while
it
s
under
government
ownership
canada
s
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
he
hopes
to
hire
people
nations
and
environmental
groups
assailed
trudeau
for
buying
out
the
project
we
are
absolutely
shocked
and
appalled
that
canada
is
willingly
investing
taxpayers
money
in
such
a
highly
controversial
fossil
fuel
expansion
project
grand
chief
stewart
philip
president
of
the

chiefs
told
the
toronto

we
will
not
stand
down
no

who
buys

exorbitantly
priced

scathing
article
in
the
guardian
environmentalist
bill
mckibben
called
justin
trudeau
the
world
s
newest
oil
executive
and
said
that
the
cutest
progressivest
boybandiest
leader
in
the
world
is
going
fully
in
the
tank
for
the
oil
but
it
wasn
t
just
first
nations
and
environmentalists
trudeau
is
coming
under
fire
from
all
sides
even
the
conservatives
criticized
the
government
for
leaving
taxpayers
on
the
hook
for
the
project
kinder
morgan
only
paid
million
for
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
back
in
trudeau
has
decided
to
fork
over
billion
for
a
system
that
is
a
now
a
decade
older
with
no
plan
on
how
to
get
the
expansion
constructed
kinder
morgan
wasn
t
asking
for
the
money
they
were
asking
for
certainty
and
a
pathway
to
get
the
get
the
project
built
conservative
leader
andrew
scheer
said
the
prime
minister
is
forcing
canadian
taxpayers
to
pay
for
his
obviously
not
everyone
is
against
the
project
the
oil
industry
welcomed
the
news
although
cautioned
that
it
shouldn
t
become
the
norm
we
think
that
today
s
announcement
is
based
on
extraordinary
circumstances
tim
mcmillan
ceo
of
the
canadian
association
of
petroleum
producers
said
in
a
press
conference
tuesday
we
don
t
want
to
find
ourselves
in
this
situation
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
was
desperate
to
push
the
project
forward
arguing
that
the
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
alberta
s
pipelines
are
just
about
full
are
costing
canadian
oil
producers
c
billion
s
right
on
that
account
the
cost
of
pipeline
bottlenecks
continues
to
weigh
on
canada
s
oil
industry
western
canada
select
wcs
a
benchmark
that
tracks
heavy
oil
in
canada
has
traded
at
a
significant
discount
to
wti
which
in
turn
has
seen
its
discount
widen
relative
to
brent
related
the
biggest
challenge
for
oil
exportswcs
fell
to
the
per
barrel
this
week
more
than
lower
than
wti
and
nearly
lower
than
brent
although
some
of
the
discount
is
due
to
transportation
costs
and
quality
issues
the
price
differential
has
exploded
over
the
past
year
as
alberta
s
available
takeaway
capacity
has
all
but
problem
for
trudeau
however
is
that
it
isn
t
at
all
clear
that
his
takeover
of
kinder
morgan
s
pipeline
will
resolve
outstanding
issues
the
plan
consists
of
purchasing
the
pipeline
system
clearing
the
political
obstacles
and
then
selling
off
the
project
to
a
private
company
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
federal
government
can
bulldoze
british
columbia
into
allowing
the
project
to
move
forward
the
government
also
does
not
have
a
buyer
in
mind
to
eventually
take
on
the
a
sign
finance
minister
bill
morneau
said
that
the
government
does
not
want
to
own
the
pipeline
for
a
long
period
of
time
but
he
conceded
that
it
could
remain
the
owner
for
the
medium
while
he
didn
t
elaborate
on
what
that
actually
means
his
comment
suggests
the
trans
mountain
expansion
is
not
moving
forward
anytime
