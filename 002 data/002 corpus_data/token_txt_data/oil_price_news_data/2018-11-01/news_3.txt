trump: thereâ€™s enough oil to offset iran loss
president
donald
trump
has
determined
there
was
enough
crude
oil
and
oil
products
supply
globally
to
offset
any
loss
of
supply
from
iran
after
sanctions
enter
into
force
next
a
memorandum
trump
said
there
is
a
sufficient
supply
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
from
countries
other
than
iran
to
permit
a
significant
reduction
in
the
volume
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
purchased
from
iran
by
or
through
foreign
financial
the
memorandum
also
mentioned
there
was
enough
spare
production
capacity
globally
to
allow
for
any
necessary
production
increase
amid
growing
worry
about
the
global
economy
however
the
necessity
for
any
production
increases
in
oil
has
been
questioned
by
analysts
and
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
although
falih
also
separately
said
the
kingdom
will
continue
to
boost
production
this
this
week
reuters
reported
that
the
world
s
top
three
the
united
states
and
saudi
million
bpd
combined
in
september
a
month
later
russia
s
production
alone
hit
another
record
of
million
figures
are
in
line
with
the
sentiment
expressed
by
president
trump
and
expectations
by
some
observers
that
the
effect
of
the
sanctions
entry
into
effect
on
prices
will
be
moderate
this
is
what
the
congressional
research
service
s
top
iran
expert
kenneth
katzman
said
commenting
on
trump
s
memorandum
as
quoted
by
the
washington
reports
that
iran
s
oil
exports
ahead
of
the
sanctions
were
higher
than
earlier
estimated
also
provided
fuel
for
expectations
of
a
moderate
price
effect
as
did
the
news
that
washington
has
granted
india
a
waiver
from
the
sanctions
obviously
satisfied
with
the
nation
s
efforts
to
reduce
its
imports
from
against
iran
will
enter
into
effect
on
november
at
midnight
a
day
before
the
elections
in
the
united
states
keeping
a
lid
on
oil
prices
ahead
of
the
vote
has
been
a
priority
for
the
trump
