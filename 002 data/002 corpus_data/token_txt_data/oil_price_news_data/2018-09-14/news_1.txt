after
flying
in
on
their
private

embossed
with

great
it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
sellers
and
campbell
are
in
such
high
demand
in
this
hardscrabble
city
that
has
become
the
global
center
of
the
shale
revolution
over
the
past
decade
they
ve
bought
and
sold
tens
of
thousands
of
oil
leases
in
the
permian
basin
making
deals
blessed
with
a
handshake
in
diners
on
the
hoods
of
trucks
and
in
bars
such
as

be
the
most
prolific
and
richest
texas
dealmakers
you
ve
never
heard
of

just
years
old
they

personally
made
at
least

according
to
an
analysis
by
the

in

to
harold

who
led
the
innovations
in
shale
that
began
in
the
but
while
most
were
made
from
striking
oil
the
new
game
in
town
is
land
sellers
and
campbell
began
as
land
men
specialists
in
buying
and
quickly
selling
drilling
rights
which
in
texas
are
all
privately
you
can
have
the
best
drilling
engineer
the
best
geologist
the
best
of
everything
but
if
you
don
t
own
an
oil
and
gas
lease
you
can
t
drill

wearing
a
polo

jeans

cowboy
boots
and
sipping
whiskey
on
the
rocks
the
land
man
was
always
looked
down
upon
because
he
wasn
t
a
scientist
not
they
re
not
alone
dozens
of
young
entrepreneurs
mostly
in
their
are
running
companies
in
the
frenzied
boom
in
west
texas
and
new
mexico
that
may
each
be
worth
billions
of
they
realize
that
kind
of
cash
will
depend
of
course
on
the
vagaries
of
the
shale
industry
where
consistent
profits
remain
elusive
rising
costs
and
pipeline
shortages
have
put
the
breaks
on
growth
this
year
and
like
any
property
boom
an
early
entry
can
make
a
career
while
being
late
can
break
one
many
of
the
young
men
admire
the
late
aubrey
mcclendon
the
founder
of
chesapeake
energy
who
became
a
billionaire
leasing
land
for
natural
gas
drilling
in
the
but
he
s
a
cautionary
tale
he
was
ousted
after
he
had
borrowed
heavily
betting
on
rising
gas
prices
that
never
young
upstarts
are
unperturbed
by
all
that
with
larger
rivals
continuing
to
bulk
up
billion
in
deals
have
been
announced
in
just
the
past
six
months
they
see
themselves
as
prime
takeover
targets
and
they
re
angling
for
that
big
and
campbell
have
been
friends
since
their
days
in
junior
high
school
just
south
of
amarillo
they
played
football
together
first
in
high
school
and
then
at
texas
tech
university
sellers
was
a
defensive
lineman
and
campbell
an
offensive
lineman
who
d
go
on
to
have
a
brief
nfl
career
before
a
pectoral
injury
drove
him
out
of
the
had
gotten
into
real
estate
while
in
college
but
business
stalled
in
due
to
the
financial
crisis
so
on
the
advice
of
friends
they
put
whatever
they
had
left
into
a
lease
in
the
haynesville
shale
play
in
east
texas
they
were
able
to
quickly
sell
it
to
an
operator
who
was
looking
to
drill
and
made
a
the
next
four
years
they
perfected
the
play
expanding
to
the
eagle
ford
in
south
texas
and
the
permian
to
the
west
it
was
all
in
all
in
all
in
every
time
sellers
model
at
first
was
to
simply
flip
leases
quickly
and
then
to
participate
as
a
partner
in
drilling
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
world
of
fracking
opened
up
a
massive
opportunity
one
that
fit
perfectly
with
their
backgrounds
in
real
estate
they
soon
saw
that
the
world
of
fracking
opened
up
a
massive
opportunity
one
that
fit
perfectly
with
their
backgrounds
in
real
permian
wells
were
all
vertical
meaning
there
was
no
incentive
to
find
adjoining
land
but
since
the
late
when
fracking
began
shale
production
has
meant
drilling
sideways
pumping
water
sand
and
chemicals
at
high
pressure
to
create
cracks
in
rock
deep
in
the
ground
to
release
oil
or
natural
operators
became
more
sophisticated
they
drilled
wells
longer
running
horizontally
for
two
sometimes
three
miles
that
meant
they
needed
to
line
up
multiple
connected
land
leases
the
shale
game
became
less
about
finding
oil
and
more
about
patching
together
the
land
needed
to
drill
long
wells
that
s
what
sellers
and
campbell
do
put
the
jigsaw
puzzle
together
and
of
course
several
contiguous
leases
that
enable
two
miles
of
horizontal
drilling
are
worth
exponentially
more
than
by
in
certain
areas
we
re
in
now
it
s
thousands
of
people
who
could
own
units
you
think
can
be
drilled
campbell

knocking
with
the

revolution
well
underway
apollo

backed
sellers
and
campbell
in
an
oklahoma
deal
in
which
they
more
than
quadrupled
the
original
investment
in
a
year
they
biggest
payout
to
date
came
last
year
when
they
sold
about
acres
to
parsley
energy
for
billion
since
then
they
ve
raised
more
money
from
apollo
assembled
an
even
larger
position
of
acres
and
started
a
drilling
company
based
on
recent
sales
prices
their
current
holdings
could
be
worth
as
much
as
billion
they
declined
comment
on
that
estimate
their
biggest
payout
to

last
year
when

working
at

natural

and
denham
capital
respectively
when
in
they
decided
to
go
into
the
oil
business
together
they
moved
to
midland
and
soon
spotted
an
opportunity
around
the
city
of
pecos
in
the
delaware
basin
they
raised
million
from
private

firms
pearl

investment
and
ngp

start
their
company
colgate

bought
small
leases
in
this
part

and
bet
they
could
buy
others
nearby
or
swap
with
larger

he
soon
joined
pioneer
as
part
of
a
team
in

of
buying

selling
noticed
that
many
deals
crossed
his
desk
that
were
too
small
for
large
companies
to
consider
leases
were
selling
for
an
acre
he
said
i
thought
this
is
crazy
the
valuation
should
be
five
or
six
times
with
funding
obtained
from
ngp
he
started
pcore
and
bought
small
overlooked
leases
and
sold
them
just
months
later
the
deal
made
his
investors
three
times
their
money
despite
a
percent
drop
in

prices
he
began
a
second

called
pcore
