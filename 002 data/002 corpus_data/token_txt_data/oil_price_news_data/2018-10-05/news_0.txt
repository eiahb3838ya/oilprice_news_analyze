should energy investors be worried by the fedâ€™s latest move?
just
in
case
you
didn
t
notice
stocks
lost
ground
yesterday
and
the
reason
du
jour
was
a
surge
in
interest
rates
the
yield
on
the
benchmark
climbed
to
around
percent
its
highest
level
in
years
and
the
jump
extended
out
along
the
curve
with
the
year
also
hitting
its
highest
level
since
that
put
pressure
on
stocks
as
traders
weighed
the
potential
slowing
effects
of
higher
rates
on
the
economy
and
the
fact
that
higher
yields
make
bonds
relatively
more
attractive
potentially
diverting
money
from
the
stock
market
the
question
here
though
is
should
energy
investors
be
concerned

people
are
attracted
to
investing
in
the
energy
sector
for
several
reasons
but
recently
one
of
the
main
among
them
is
the
lack
of
correlation
between
stocks
in
the
sector
and
the
broader
market
energy
stocks
respond
more
to
moves
in
the
price
of
oil
than
they
do
to
anything
else
so
don
t
necessarily
follow
the
herd
in
order
to
assess
the
potential
impact
on
those
stocks
of
higher
yields
then
we
must
first
look
at
what
it
could
mean
for
oil
seem
to
be
several
reasons
rates
jumped
yesterday
the
most
obvious
is
that
the
fed
is
hiking
rates
but
that
has
been
the
case
for
a
while
and
their
plan
to
continue
along
that
path
can
hardly
be
called
a
secret
more
likely
this
was
a
move
in
front
of
today
s
jobs
report
which
was
expected
to
show
higher
average
wages
something
that
is
often
an
indicator
of
future
inflation
the
belief
is
that
that
could
prompt
the
fed
to
increase
the
magnitude
and
pace
of
rate
hikes
and
the
market
is
discounting
that
possibility
once
again
though
the
relevant
question
here
is
how
will
that
affect
energy
stocks
related
why
the
saudis
can
t
keep
a
lid
on
oil
pricesif
inflation
is
at
the
root
of
concerns
then
far
from
being
a
negative
for
the
sector
the
events
of
the
last
couple
of
days
should
be
a
positive
at
least
in
the
relatively
short
term
inflation
means
rising
prices
and
the
price
of
oil
should
go
up
along
with
everything
else
as
i
said
earlier
the
price
of
oil
is
one
of
the
main
drivers
of
energy
stocks
so
if
that
moves
higher
stocks
will
follow
we
are
already
seeing
high
prices
because
of
supply
constraints
so
another
jump
should
result
in
a
windfall
for
oil
rate
hikes
have
been
seen
as
bad
for
energy
stocks
because
much
of
their
value
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
big
multinationals
has
been
derived
from
dividend
payments
however
following
the
collapse
in
oil
prices
a
couple
of
years
ago
dividends
have
been
cut
in
many
cases
making
them
less
of
a
factor
for
energy
investors
so
while
higher
rates
will
push
the
price
of
investments
such
as
mlps
lower
they
will
probably
have
a
muted
effect
on
other
oil
stocks
in
terms
of
relative
yield
however
the
picture
becomes
a
little
less
rosy
if
we
look
a
little
further
into
the
future
rate
hikes
are
necessary
to
counter
inflationary
pressure
but
they
are
not
without
some
risk
higher
interest
rates
discourage
borrowing
and
investment
slowing
the
economy
down
if
they
are
overdone
even
by
a
small
amount
that
could
choke
off
the
energy
demand
growth
that
the
market
is
currently
pricing
in
forcing
oil
and
therefore
energy
stocks
answer
to
the
original
question
should
energy
investors
be
concerned
about
rising
bond
yields
is
therefore
yes
and
no
in
the
short
term
the
inflation
that
the
move
is
anticipating
will
be
a
positive
but
in
the
long
term
slower
growth
could
have
a
negative
effect
in
those
circumstances
as
stocks
fall
in
response
to
higher
rates
buying
energy
stocks
makes
sense
at
least
for
now
but
investors
should
stay
alert
for
signs
