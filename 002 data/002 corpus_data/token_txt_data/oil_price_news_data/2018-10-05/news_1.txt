coal use rises as renewables fall in u.s. electricity generation
the
eia
released
the
latest
edition
of
their
electric
power
monthly
on
september
with
data
for
july
the
table

shows
the

of
the
main

to
two

for

for
the
month
of
july
the
total
amount
of
electricity
generated
was
the
second
highest
amount
generated
for
any
single
month
since
january
at
gwh
gwh
less
than
the
amount
generated
in
july
coal
and
natural
gas
fueled
almost
percent
of
us
electricity
generation
in
july
and
while
the
contribution
from
coal
increased
from
percent
in
june
to
percent
in
july
the
contribution
from
natural
gas
also
increased
by
slightly
more
than
five
percentage
points
reaching
an
unprecedented
percent
up
from
percent
in
june
nuclear
power
generated
gwh
percent
more
than
it
did
in
june
but
due
to
the
increase
in
total
generation
the
percentage
contribution
to
the
total
actually
declined
to
percent
from
percent
in
july
the
contribution
from
all
renewables
at
percent
fell
further
below
that
from
nuclear
at
percent
similar
to
july
when
the
ramp
up
of
total
generation
resulted
in
the
percentage
contribution
from
all
renewables
falling
further
below
that
from
nuclear
the
absolute
contribution
from
solar
declined
from
it
s
all
time
high
in
june
of
gwh
to
gwh
with
the
corresponding
percentage
contribution
declining
to
percent
as
opposed
to
percent
in
june
the
amount
of
electricity
generated
by
wind
decreased
by
almost
percent
from
gwh
to
gwh
and
coupled
with
the
increased
total
generation
the
percentage
contribution
declined
from
percent
to
percent
in
july
the
contribution
from
hydro
decreased
percent
from
gwh
in
june
to
gwh
resulting
in
the
percentage
contribution
decreasing
from
percent
in
june
to
percent
the
combined
contribution
from
wind
and
solar
decreased
to
percent
from
percent
in
june
consequently
the
contribution
from
renewables
also
decreased
to
percent
from

the
contribution
of
zero
emission
and
carbon
neutral
sources
that
is
nuclear
hydro
wind
solar
geothermal
landfill

the

while
the

is
for
solar

and
has
been
deliberately
set

the

of

as
suggested
by

earlier
this

to
make
the

a
little
easier
in

the
output
from

it
was
four
years
ago
in
july
solar
energy
appears
to
have
peaked
in

of
the

solstice
so
it
is
looking
