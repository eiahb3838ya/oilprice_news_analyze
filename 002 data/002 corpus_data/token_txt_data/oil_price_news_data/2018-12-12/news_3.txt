china pushes global oil trading to all-time high in 2018
this
year
s
crude
oil
futures
trading
activity
is
on
track
for
a
record
high
as
trading
volumes
in
china
s
new
futures
contract
is
offsetting
lower
activity
in
the
world

reports
citing

launched
in

energy
exchange
ine
are
still
seen
mainly
as
a
chinese
market
for
chinese
traders
who
don
t
trade
on
market
fundamentals
the
futures
contract
struggles
to
become
truly
international
for
market
participants
while
inconsistent
trading
volumes
are
not
helping
international
traders
to
use
the
shanghai
futures
as
a
financial
have
also
flagged
storage
costs
in
china
as
one
of
the
problems
that
traders
could
face
in
the
delivery
mechanism
of
the
chinese
oil
futures
contract
storage
costs
in
china
are
much
higher
than
elsewhere
the
reason
for
the
higher
cost
is
limited
storage
capacity
availability
and
the
requirement
that
the
cargo
be
stored
at
a
specific
storage
facility
rather
than
at
any
in
its
first
year
of
launch
the
chinese

already
taken
a
market
share
from

active

from

quoted
by

volumes
of
brent

dropped
to
million

each
this
year
through
december
compared
to

lots
traded
last
year
trading
volumes
in
wti

brent
are
set
to
decline
in

the
first
time
since
the
shanghai
crude
oil
futures
volume
trade
of
million
lots
until
december
added
to
the
wti
and
brent
trading
volumes
will
push
the
oil
futures
trading
globally
to
a
record
high
this
if
a
new
exchange
achieves
percent
market
share
vs
the
two
incumbents
within
the
first

of
