2019 could make or break opec
when
agreed
to
begin
cutting
crude
oil
production
again
in
december
hardly
anyone
in
the
cartel
thought
the
effect
of
the
news
on
prices
would
be
as
lackluster
as
it
turned
out
to
be
it
took
some
time
for
the
fact
to
sink
in
that
this
time
too
many
traders
were
worried
about
the
future
of
oil
demand
and
were
reluctant
to
speculate
with
oil
now
opec
is
facing
another
tough
year
perhaps
even
tougher
than
and
it
might
just
need
to
reduce
production
even
more
to
make
it
well
morgan
said
prior
to
the
opec
meeting
early
december
that
if
opec
didn
t
really
cut
by
more
than
around
million
barrels
per
day
and
they
did
just
for
the
first
half
not
for
the
full
year
that
we
could
gravitate
toward
our
scenario
which
is
brent
for
the
investment
bank
s
head
of
oil
and
gas
for
the
told
cnbc
this
we
expect
oil
markets
to
remain
volatile
in
part
driven
by
flexible
north
american
shale
production
that
can
ramp
up
and
down
quickly
in
response
to
changes
in
investment
levels
conocophillips
ceo
ryan
lance
told
bloomberg
also
this
american
shale
production
is
of
course
the
challenge
for
opec
s
plans
two
years
ago
it
was
easier
nobody
was
sure
exactly
how
flexible
shale
oil
production
can
be
so
the
opec
cuts
worked
helped
by
a
brighter
global
economic
outlook
now
things
are
different
shale
production
is
growing
despite
the
slump
in
prices
and
although
this
may
change
if
prices
fall
further
or
stay
at
current
levels
for
longer
this
is
far
from
certain
in
the
last
week
of
december
after
prices
have
been
on
the
decline
for
three
months
drillers
continued
adding
rigs
related
the
new
oil
orderyet
it
wasn
t
just
production
that
rose
last
year
russia
s
hit
a
new
record
in
at
million
bpd
which
made
it
the
producer
after
the
united
states
saudi
arabia
also
pumped
at
a
record
level
of
over
million
bpd
in
the
months
that
followed
the
june
decision
to
reverse
the
cuts
to
rein
in
prices
this
is
the
context
in
which
agreed
the
new
cuts
which
were
bpd
lower
than
the
ones
agreed
in
no
wonder
skepticism
is
analysts
believe
that
once
the
cuts
enter
into
effect
which
they
did
at
the
start
of
the
new
year
the
effect
on
prices
will
come
to
be
felt
but
jp
morgan
s
scott
darling
may
just
turn
out
to
be
right
yesterday
news
that
saudi
arabia
had
reduced
its
crude
oil
exports
by
half
a
million
barrels
daily
pushed
up
prices
only
briefly
before
both
brent
and
west
texas
intermediate
faltered
and
slid
down
six
months
may
be
enough
to
reduce
the
combined
output
of
opec
and
its
partners
by
the
agreed
million
bpd
if
production
continues
to
grow
at
the
current
rate
it
would
likely
offset
this
cut
completely
true
the
amount
of
crude
that
is
added
or
leaves
the
global
markets
is
not
the
only
factor
that
counts
the
type
of
crude
is
also
important
and
oil
is
overwhelmingly
light
crude
while
there
is
also
global
demand
for
heavier
grades
that
the
middle
east
and
russia
produce
yet
grades
are
rarely
the
top
concern
of
traders
when
they
hear
words
like
oversupply
volatility
as
conoco
s
ryan
lance
said
is
clearly
here
to
stay
and
will
likely
intensify
in
the
coming
months
opec
might
just
be
forced
to
extend
the
cuts
it
agreed
in
december
if
a
positive
effect
from
this
agreement
fails
to
materialize
