moodyâ€™s: the shale band is back, and here to stay
oil
prices
will
remain
volatile
this
year
but
within
range
moody
s
said
in
its
annual
report
on
the
oil
and
gas
industry
the
top
factor
to
watch
in
would
be
discipline
in
adhering
to
the
production
cut
agreement
that
the
group
sealed
in
december
market
expectations
for
continued
strong
oil
demand
growth
remain
in
place
despite
concerns
about
slowing
demand
growth
as
a
result
of
weaker
economic
growth
the
impact
of
tariffs
and
a
strong
dollar
said
the

agency
s
managing
director
for
oil
and

steve
wood
adding
that
very
high
saudi
and
russian
production
in
particular
has
heightened
supply
volatility
so
whether
opec
and
russia
maintain
production
discipline
and
renew
agreements
to
limit
output
are
key
concerns
going
into
the
new
year

expects
west
texas
intermediate
to
remain
within
a

of

a
barrel
over
the
next
five
years
noting
that
although
efficiency
gains
have
served
as
tailwinds
for
oil
production
pipeline
bottlenecks
have
at
least
partially
offset
the
positive
effect
by
raising
transportation
agency
s
stance
is
reasonably
guarded
and
echoes
other
forecasts
for
oil
prices
this
year
jp
morgan
for
example
earlier
this
week
warned
that
might
need
to
extend
the
production
cuts
until
the
end
of
the
year
as
rising
production
was
likely
to
offset
any

returns
from

it
