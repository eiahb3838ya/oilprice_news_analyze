the
oil
market
is
understandably
in
a
state
of
suspense
this
week
eagerly
fixated
on
the
events
unfolding
in
vienna
but
regardless
of
what
happens
the
market
is
in
for
a
potentially

ride

according
to
a

from

out
a

for

themes
of

as
the

on
the
most
recent

faced
more
scrutiny
the
deal
started
to
look
a
little
hollow
trump
took
to
twitter
perhaps
after
he
realized
that
china

were
not

the

bank
said
in
its
report
regarding
the
of
the
key
backdrops
for
the
global
economy
in
will
be
an
unprecedented
level
of

merrill

said
in

the

steadily

central
bank
has
held

gained
significantly
this
year
as
a
result
which
has
ultimately
spread
volatility
throughout
emerging
markets
weakening

and
contributing
to
a
flare
up
in
financial
stress
many
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
seemed
to
revise
his
outlook
recently
noting
that
interest
rates
are
close
to
what
the
central
bank
views
as
just
a
month
ago
he
said
that
rates
were
very
far
from
neutral
the
slight
change
in
wording
suggests
the
fed
could
take
a
less
hawkish
view
on
monetary
policy
which
could
be
good
for
growth
and
may
support
a
weaker

not

may
be

the
economic
headwinds
look
much
more
formidable

into

than
they
did

still
global
oil
demand
has
been
affected
much
less
than
might
be
implied

volatility

by

bpd
in
its
november
oil
market
report
the
agency
noted
that
a
deteriorating
outlook
for
the
global
economy
is
largely
offset
by
the
fall
in
brent
crude
oil
in
other
words
oil
prices
fell
because
a
worsening
economy
implied
lower
demand
but
lower
prices
themselves
helped
keep
demand
a
result
oil
prices
might
not
necessarily
fall
from
current
levels
even
though
the
economy
could
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
we
forecast

prices
