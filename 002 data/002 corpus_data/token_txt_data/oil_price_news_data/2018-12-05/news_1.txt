u.s. shale struggles as oil prices drop
the
explosive
production
growth
in
the
shale
patch
has
surprised
even
the
most
optimistic
forecasters
but
the
huge
jumps
in
output
belies
and
obscures
the
financial
state
of
the
industry
which
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
production
figures
might
companies
scrambled
to
cut
costs
during
the
oil
market
downturn
between
and
and
they
successfully
lowered
their
breakeven
prices
significantly
when
agreed
on
its
initial
production
cut
deal
which
started
at
the
beginning
of
the
higher
prices
that
resulted
from
the
agreement
allowed
shale
to
rebound
in
a
big
way
surging
production
over
the
past
two
years
suggested
that
the
shale
industry
was
stronger
than
year
was
supposed
to
be
the
year
that
the
money
started
rolling
in
with
cost
cuts
in
hand
and
higher
oil
prices
lifting
all
boats
shale
drillers
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
clear
but
profits
have
been
be
sure
some
companies
have
posted
significant
earnings
the
oil
majors
in
particular
are
earning
more
money
than
they
have
in
a
long
time
but
the
bulk
of
the
shale
industry
is
still
struggling
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
the
largest
shale
companies
earned
a
rather
marginal
billion

in
latest
meltdown
in
prices
however
puts
a
lot
in
the
industry
right
back
into
hot
water
the
problem
is
that
despite
boasts
of
low
breakeven
prices
many
shale
companies
have
failed
to
take
a
comprehensive
look
at
the
costs
of
producing
oil
as
the
wall
street
journal
points
out
related
is
this
the
next
disaster
for
canadian
drillers
it
wasn
t
uncommon
over
the
last
few
years
to
hear
shale
executives
brag
about
how
their
wells
were
profitable
even
with
oil
under
per
barrel
but
often
those
figures
didn
t
include
the
cost
of
land
acquisition
or
transportation
or
while
individual
wells
might
make
a
return
the
company
was
ignoring
the
cost
of
producing
in
other
less
desirable
locations
at
the
end
of
the
day
much
of
the
industry
was
not
turning
a
profit
even
when
oil
prices
traded
north

schlumberger
the
largest
oilfield
services
company
in
the
world
said
this
week
that
it
expects
drilling
activity
to
slow
down
significantly
in
the
fourth
quarter
with
sales
for
its
services
in
north
america
expected
to
drop
by
percent
compared
to
the
prior
quarter
the
recent
downturn
in
prices
is
hurting
drillers
which
comes
at
a
time
when
budgets
are
mostly
exhausted
we
are
seeing
a
significantly
larger
drop
in
activity
than
we
expected
which
is
leading
to
a
larger
drop
in
pricing
than
we
anticipated
