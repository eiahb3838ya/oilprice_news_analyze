iea: opec+ has put “a floor under prices”
the
agreement
succeeded
in
at
least
putting
a
floor
under
prices
according
to
a
new
report
from
the
international
energy
agency
the
global
supply
surplus
is
not
resolved
and
would
likely
reemerge
if
let
up
on
its
production
cuts
but
the
agreement
was
welcomed
by
the
iea
in
its
december
oil
market
report
where
the
agency
noted
that
oil
prices
had
been
extremely
volatile

the
few
months

the
meeting

such

is
not
in
the

of
producers
or
the
agency
kept
its
demand
figures
steady
but
noted
that
the
trend
is
negative
demand
will
grow
by
although
there
are
signs
that
the
pace
is
slackening
in
some
countries
as

of
higher

is
now
dominated
by
the

the
