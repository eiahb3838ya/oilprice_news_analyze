no, the u.s. is not a net exporter of crude oil
last
week
bloomberg
created
quite
a
stir
with
this
story
the
just
became
a
net
oil
exporter
for
the
first
time
in
years
i
have
seen
a
number
of
stories
that
praised
the
significance
of
this
development
but
others
laughed
it
off
as
misleading
or
is
some
truth
to
both
viewpoints
yes
the
headline
is
somewhat
misleading
and
requires
some
context
but
there
continues
to
be
a
trend
in
the
direction
of
energy
independence
for
the
so
today
i
want
to
break
down
the
numbers
so
readers
can
understand
the
truth
about
petroleum
production
consumption
and
crude
production
has
surgedthe
bloomberg
story
is
based
on
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
eia
each
week
the
eia
publishes
detailed
statistics
on
oil
production
consumption
exports
and
inventories
in
a
report
called
the
weekly
petroleum
status
report
so
let
s
go
straight
to
the
the
week
ending
the
eia
reported
that
the
produced
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
that
represents
a
million
bpd
increase
from
the
number
this
number
is
generally
accepted
even
by
those
who
believe
the
bloomberg
headline
was
down
in
the
report
the
category
of
products
supplied
is
listed
at
million
bpd
this
is
approximate
crude
oil
consumption
for
the
week
thus
as
some
skeptics
of
the
story
suggested
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
is
burning
more
than
million
bpd
while
producing
less
than
million
bpd
thus
the
conclusion
for
some
was
that
the
isn
t
close
to
being
energy
supplybut
there
is
important
context
between
these
numbers
first
the
million
bpd
is
a
fairly
accurate
representation
of
consumption
but
there
is
a
large
production
number
that
isn
t
included
in
the
crude
oil
production
numbers
related
will
china
turn
its
back
on
lng
there
is
a
line
item
called
other
supply
which
consists
primarily
of
natural
gas
liquids
ngls
and
fuel
ethanol
this
category
represents
a
significant
input
to
refiners
in
addition
to
the
million
bpd
of
production
and
the
million
bpd
of
net
crude
oil
imports
other
supply
represented
million
bpd
of
production
and
it
mostly
ends
up
as
feedstock
for
refiners
or
petrochemical
production
note
that
this
category
also
includes
refinery
processing
gain
of
million
bpd
which
results
from
refiners
making
products
that
are
of
a
lower
density
than
crude
oil
domestic
production
of
crude
oil
plus
other
supply
is
equal
to
million
bpd
which
is
still
about
million
bpd
less
than
the
exportshowever
these
numbers
don
t
account
for
exports
during
that
particular
week
the
imported
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
exported
million
bpd
thus
net
crude
oil
imports
were
million
product
exports
are
a
different
story
during
that
week
the
imported
million
bpd
of
finished
products
while
exporting
million
bpd
which
includes
some
ethanol
and
ngls
net
exports
of
finished
products
were
million
bpd
the
became
a
net
exporter
of
just
finished
products
in
also
exports
crude
oil
president
obama
repealed
the
old
crude
oil
export
ban
in
and
crude
oil
exports
have
soared
since
as
an
aside
the
reason
the
simultaneously
imports
and
exports
crude
is
that
some
of
what
we
produce
isn
t
a
good
match
for
our
domestic
refineries
so
we
export
some
domestic
crude
and
import
crude
that
is
a
better
match
for
our
checkso
here
s
a
summary
of
the
important
inputs
to
the
balance
that
resulted
in
the
bloomberg

cuts
to
balance
oil
markets
in
the
bloomberg
headline
results
from
a
net
crude
oil
import
number
of
million
bpd
and
a
net
finished
product
export
number
of
million
bpd
so
indeed
when
you
consider
crude
oil
and
finished
products
for
the
week
ending
the
was
a
net
exporter
of
million
bpd
of
crude
plus
finished
products
for
perspective
this
average
over
the
previous
four
weeks
was
million
bpd
of
net
imports
remarkable
achievement
but
false
headlinesignificantly
this
is
the
first
time
this
category
of
weekly
crude
plus
finished
products
became
an
export
number
since
the
eia
began
reporting
this
information
in
this
is
a
far
cry
from
when
that
weekly
number
hit
an
of
million
bpd
as
far
as
i
can
tell
bloomberg
is
correct
that
this
hasn
t
happened
in
the
past
that
s
not
what
the
headline
claimed
the
headline
said
the
is
still
a
net
importer
of
oil
to
the
tune
of
million
total
production
of
oil
and
other
supply
that
is
fed
into
refineries
is
million
bpd
while
consumption
is
million
bpd
that
still
puts
consumption
at
nearly
million
bpd
more
than
we
produce
it
s
actually
a
little
worse
than
that
because
not
all
ngls
end
up
as
refinery
feedstock
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
aren
t
net
exporters
of
crude
oil
and
we
aren
t
energy
independent
but
the
has
trended
in
that
direction
for
over
a
decade
regardless
of
whether
it
remains
that
way
this
is
undoubtedly
a
remarkable
achievement
i
know
a
lot
of
people
including
myself
would
have
scoffed
at
such
a
prediction
