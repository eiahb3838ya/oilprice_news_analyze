where will u.s. frackers drill next?
with
wti
oil
prices
staying
above
a
barrel
for
several
months
drillers
are
breaking
production
records
each
week
mostly
thanks
to
the
permian
in
west
texas
and
new
recent
months
however
some
companies
have
started
to
test
their
fracking
capabilities
on
oil
fields
that
most
agree
reached
their
peak
production
decades
believe
that
it
s
a
winning
bet
analysts
say
it
could
be
a
breakthrough
for
the
more
challenging
chalk
formations
in
east
texas
and
louisiana
authorities
and
industry
officials
in
louisiana
believe
there
s
a
resurgence
in
one
of
the
old
areas
in
the
state
and
want
to
support
investment
in
the
austin
chalk
which
stretches
from
texas
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
cuts
through
much
of
central
louisiana
is
one
of
those
formations
that
was
hot
back
in
the
but
has
been
forgotten
since
then
especially
after
hydraulic
fracturing
shifted
the
industry
attention
to
other
areas
in
the
united
bakken
in
the
north
and
the
eagle
ford
and
the
permian
in
have
started
to
drill
frac
wells
in
the
austin
chalk
where
the
number
of
drilling
rigs
has
doubled
over
the
past
six
months
to
and
oil
production
surged
to
bpd
last
year
from
just
bpd
five
years
austin
chalk
play
is
going
through
a
resurgence
in
activity
and
new
horizontal
drilling
and
completion
techniques
have
resulted
in
substantial
production
rates
according

of

available
the
department
said
in
march
this
the
majority
of
the
production
has
occurred
in
the
western
half
of
the
state
while
new

is
concentrated

early

the

said
last
while
natural

has
generated
impressive
initial
production
rates
in

the

landscape
is
more

production
in

so
completions
will
need

aggressive

it
