russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
agreed
to
extend
their
oil
partnership
indefinitely
with
the
agreement
stipulating
that
they
could
move
to
regulate
oil

at
any
moment
tass
reports
quoting
energy
minister
alexander
novak
i
think
that
the
framework
is
the
same
the
current
agreement
it
will
simply
be
institutionalized
and
will
not
specify
particular
volumes
most
likely
it
will
stipulate
the
possibility
of
if
needed
novak
news
is
a
confirmation
of
what
everyone
was
expecting
from
the
largest
participants
in
the
deal
however
the
significance
of
this
agreement
is
only
hypothetical
the
terms
cited
by
novak
are
very
general
are
no
stipulations
concerning
specific
production
and
opec
are
meeting
next
friday
to
discuss
the
future
of
the
production
cut
deal
moscow
and
riyadh
have
made
it
clear
they
are
in
favor
of
a
return
to
higher
production
to
keep
a
lid
on
prices
but
other
opec
members
notably
iraq
and
iran
are
against
it

novak
said
he
and
his
saudi
counterpart
khalid
had
agreed
to
propose
to
the
group
to
up
production
by
million
bpd
beginning
in
july
the
final
decision
needs
to
be
unanimous
for
opec
however
and
many
analysts
expect
the
meeting
to
be
a
disaster
we
are
only
proposing
this
for
the
third
quarter
in
september
we
will
review
the
situation
in
the
market
and
decide
the
future
course
the

need
to
increase
production
emerged
as
venezuela
s
production
is
in
free
fall
and
iranian
production
is
threatened
by
the
of
sanctions
at
the
same
time
global
demand
is
growing
according
to
most
forecasts
which
pushed
brent

to
over

this
however
proved
too
expensive
for
the
