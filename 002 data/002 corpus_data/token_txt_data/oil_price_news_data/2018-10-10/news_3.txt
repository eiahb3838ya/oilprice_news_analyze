saudis to boost oil supply to india as iran sanctions kick in
saudi
arabia
is
set
to
deliver
extra
million
barrels
of
its
oil
to
india
in
november
reuters
reported
on
wednesday
citing
several
sources
familiar
with
the
plans
in
what
could
be
a
saudi
move
to
replace
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
due
to
the
sanctions
on
tehran
returning
early
next
to
reuters
sources
reliance
industries
hindustan
petroleum
bharat
petroleum
and
mangalore
refinery
petrochemicals
would
be
looking
for
an
additional
million
barrels
each
from
the
saudis
next
reason
for
more
demand
from
saudi
arabia
is
that
the
arbitrage
for
crude
oil
cargoes
is
currently
shut
so
indian
oil
refiners
need
to
procure
more
oil
from
middle
eastern
producers
one
of
the
sources
week
reports
emerged
that
india
would
buy
a
total
of
million
barrels
of
oil
from
iran
in
november
suggesting
that
india
will
continue
to
purchase
iranian
crude
even
after
the
sanctions
on
tehran
is
iran
s
single
oil
customer
after
china
and
was
expected
to
cut
back
on
iranian
oil
purchases
but
unlikely
to
cut
off
completely
the
cheap
iranian
oil
that
is
suitable
for
its
wants
to
keep
importing
oil
from
iran
because
tehran
offers
some
discounts
and
incentives
for
indian
buyers
at
a
time
when
the
indian
government
is
struggling
with
higher
oil
prices
and
a
weakening
local
currency
that
additionally
weighs
on
its
oil
import
bill
related
a
new
era
of
geopolitical
risk
in
global
oil
marketsbut
the
continues
to
insist
that
it
expects
iranian
oil
buyers
to
bring
their
purchases
down
to
this
week
indian
officials
said
that
they
hoped
india
could
secure
a
waiver
from
the
united
states
because
it
has
significantly
reduced
purchases
of
iranian
oil
late
last
week
the
united
states
hinted
that
it
was
at
least
considering
archrival
saudi
arabia
and
iran
are
exchanging
in
the
media
diverging
opinions
on
who
s
making
up
for
lost
iranian
oil
barrels
or
rather
whether
it
s
even
possible
to
do
so
the
saudis
insist
that
they
have
been
more
than
compensating
and
have
capacity
to
turn
on
if
the
market
demands
it
iran
on
the
other
hand
is
steadfast
in
its
claims
