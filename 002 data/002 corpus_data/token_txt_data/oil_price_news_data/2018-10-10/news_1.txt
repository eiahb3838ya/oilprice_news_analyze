will big oil ever win back investors’ trust?
good
news
is
flooding
into
the
oil
and
gas
industry
it
seems
after
reports
of
higher
exploration
budgets
and
various
discovery
announcements
here
s
more
big
oil
s
total
free
cash
flow
this
year
could
hit
us
billion
rystad
energy
has
estimated
as
quoted
by
bloomberg
that
s
five
times
what
the
supermajors
made
in
the
previous
five
years
combined
which
should
impress
investors
according
to
big
oil
has
been
lagging
behind
crude
oil
benchmarks
in
terms
of
price
improvements
while
brent
and
wti
have
climbed
substantially
over
the
past
months
the
stocks
of
the
biggest
oil
companies
in
the
world
have
risen
only
modestly
they
have
also
lagged
behind
stock
indices
in
the
united
states
bloomberg
s
kelly
gilblom
piles
of
free
cash
flow
change
investors
minds
only
if
they
are
accompanied
by
a
lot
more
in
other
departments
seems
to
be
the
answer
the
cash
on
its
own
has
to
be
sustained
and
it
can
t
be
sustained
if
prices
start
falling
which
will
happen
sooner
rather
than
later
what
with
india
and
the
united
states
complaining
about
them
being
too
s
more
despite
headwinds
such
as
hurricane
michael
which
will
only
have
a
effect
on
prices
the
imf
just
this
week
applied
a
considerable
amount
of
downward
pressure
on
the
benchmarks
after
it
revised
its
outlook
for
the
global
economy
with
analysts
noting
that
a
slowdown
in
growth
could
put
a
strain
on
oil
and
oil
products
let
s
set
free
cash
flow
aside
spending
is
also
still
a
problem
for
investors
they
simply
don
t
seem
convinced
that
big
oil
can
maintain
the
strict
financial
discipline
it
was
forced
to
adopt
during
the
downturn
and
they
have
a
pretty
good
reason
to
be
suspicious
the
cyclical
nature
of
the
commodity
industries
has
given
them
enough
historical
evidence
that
proves
pledges
to
maintain
strict
financial
discipline
in
a
period
of
recovery
do
not
last
related
trump
sides
with
farmers
in
battle
against
refinersyet
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
all
investors
are
champions
in
investors
do
appreciate
the
results
of
a
frugal
approach
to
spending
conocophillips
is
a
case
in
point
here
the
company
earlier
this
year
became
the
big
oil
stock
in
the
united
states
as
it
began
buying
back
shares
assuring
its
shareholders
it
will
focus
on
returns
and
not
conoco
is
one
single
case
overall
investors
have
remained
skeptical
about
big
oil
s
promises
of
sustainable
growth
and
continued
frugality
in
fact
some
of
them
do
not
want
this
frugality
any
longer
reuters
reported
last
week
that
big
oil
companies
boards
are
under
increasing
pressure
to
boost
spending
expand
production
and
increase
reserves
that
s
just
three
years
after
everyone
in
oil
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
brent
was
going
nowhere
but
down
for
a
while
longer
and
belts
started
tightening
now
with
brent
hovering
around
us
these
belts
are
getting
too
on
the
one
hand
we
have
suspicious
investors
biding
their
time
to
start
buying
big
oil
again
once
they
make
sure
it
will
not
start
splashing
money
on
projects
with
questionable
periods
and
rates
of
return
on
the
other
we
have
existing
shareholders
who
are
eager
to
ride
out
the
wave
of
higher
oil
prices
urging
this
same
big
oil
to
spend
more
big
oil
must
be
having
a
hard
time
trying
to
please
two
so
very
different
