bp chief: saudi arabia is holding back production
i
think
saudi
arabia
does
have
capacity
that
can
bring
to
the
market
bp
s
chief
executive
bob
dudley
told
cnbc
on
wednesday
on
the
sidelines
of
the
oil
money
conference
in
but
on
the
other
side
of
it
you
have
very
unpredictable
circumstances
in
venezuela
and
of
course
with
the
iran
sanctions
dudley
noted
commenting
on
the
current
market
forces
driving
the
oil
the
start
date
of
the
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
is
less
than
four
weeks
away
the
market
is
jittery
and
prone
to
emotional
reactions
regarding
the
two
key
uncertainties
over
the
next
couple
of
much
iranian
oil
will
be
lost
to
the
sanctions
and
how
much
spare
capacity
saudi
arabia
can
bring
or
is
willing
to
bring
to
offset
possible
steep
are
estimating
that
the
sanctions
on
iran
will
remove
at
least
million
bpd
from
the
market
with
some
predicting
losses
could
be
as
large
as
million
only
really
large
spare
capacity
is
in
saudi
arabia
but
the
issue
with
this
is
that
it
has
never
been
tested
because
saudi
arabia
has
never
pumped
more
than
million
bpd
its
high
record
from
november
last
week
the
saudis
hastened
to
inform
the
market
that
they
are
currently
pumping
million
shy
of
the
record
could
even
tweak
that
million
slightly
higher
next
month
related
saudis
to
boost
oil
supply
to
india
as
iran
sanctions
kick
inin
view
of
those
uncertainties
bp
s
dudley
told
cnbc
that
he
expects
in
terms
of
oil
prices
that
it
s
going
to
be
days
of
extreme
volatility
it
could
spike
up
it
could
also
go
the
other
if
waivers
were
granted
to
others
to
big
oil
consuming
countries
you
could
see
it
the
price
go
down
there
s
a
lot
of
uncertainty
right
now
dudley
about
whether
oil
prices
at
have
already
resulted
in
demand
destruction
dudley
told
cnbc
we
don
t
see
that
volatility
in
prices
won
t
be
permanent
and
we
ll
get
back
to
the
fundamentals
