iea: opec+ cuts put floor under oil prices
the
journey
to
a
balanced
market
will
take
time
and
is
more
likely
to
be
a
marathon
than
a
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
that
the
cuts
that
started
this
month
likely
put
a
floor
beneath
oil
prices
but
that
it
would
still
take
time
before
the
reductions
could
balance
the
oil
prices
fell
over
the
course
of
december
even
after
the
cuts
were
announced
that
reflected
pessimism
over
the
trajectory
of
the
global
economy
as
well
as
fears
that
the
oil
market
was
about
to
head
into
another
steep
downturn
not
unlike
the
bust
those
fears
were
exaggerated
at
least
as
far
as
the
oil
market
goes
but
the
production
cuts
will
still
take
time
to
work
released
its
oil
market
report
in
recent
days
which
showed
that
the
cartel
slashed
output
by
bpd
in
december
sharp
reductions
that
came
before
the
deal
even
went
into
effect
saudi
arabia
led
the
way
with
bpd
in
reductions
but
its
efforts
were
aided
by
the
involuntary
losses
from
iran
bpd
libya
bpd
and
venezuela
fact
those
three
countries
have
accounted
for
massive
output
reductions
over
the
past
two
months
the
deal
is
using
october
as
a
baseline
calling
for
million
barrels
per
day
in
reductions
and
the
group
is
well
on
their
way
thanks
to
turmoil
in
just
a
few
countries
over
the
course
of
november
and
december
iran
has
lost
bpd
libya
has
lost
bpd
and
venezuela
s
output
fell
by
bpd
taken
together
the
involuntary
outages
exceed
oil
outlook
slammed
by
lower
pricesthat
makes
saudi
arabia
s
job
a
lot
easier
and
the
de
facto
leader
of
opec
has
pledged
to
cut
its
own
output
by
bpd
from
the
october
baseline
that
means
that
the
coalition
is
well
on
its
way
to
balancing
the
oil
there
is
less
clarity
over
russia
s
intentions
the
iea
said
in
its
report
the
agency
noted
that
russia
likely
increased
output
in
december
to
a
new
record
high
of
while
the
cuts
in
january
are
likely
going
to
be
phased
in
slowly
saudi
oil
minister
khalid
said
in
recent
days
that
the
cuts
are
slower
than
i
d
russia
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
thursday
that
his
country
would
try
to
speed
things
up
of
course
we
will
try
to
make
the
cuts
faster
novak
told
reporters
in
belgrade
serbia
we
have
our
limitations
of
a
technological
nature
yet
we
will
aim
to
reach
the
levels
we
agreed
meanwhile
shale
will
continue
to
grow
this
year
complicating
the
efforts
of
the
iea
left
its
projection
for
production
growth
unchanged
at
related
this
is
how
much
each
member
needs
to
cutdemand
remains
one
of
the
key
questions
for
this
is
the
first
report
from
the
iea
since
the
severe
market
turmoil
in
december
and
the
pricing
meltdown
the
agency
left
its
demand
growth
forecast
steady
at
while
the
mood
music
in
the
global
economy
is
not
very
cheerful
the
iea
said
lower
prices
and
a
weaker
dollar
have
helped
stoke
demand
a
bit
as
a
result
low
prices
somewhat
offset
the
softer
it
s
a
big
year
for
the
downstream
sector
refiners
are
gearing
up
for
the
global
regulations
on
marine
fuels
from
international
maritime
organization
imo
which
take
effect
on
january
knocking
out
dirty
fuel
oil
from
the
global
shipping
fleet
will
lead
to
a
surge
in
demand
for
middle
distillates
margins
for
diesel
are
already
sharply
higher
than
that
for
gasoline
and
the
more
refiners
chase
diesel
the
more
they
flood
the
gasoline
market
at
the
same
time
huge
additions
to
the
refining
fleet
are
expected
this
year
processing
capacity
will
increase
by
the
biggest
growth
for
four
decades
the
iea
said
these
changes
could
see
major
disruptions
in
various
fuel
markets
with
a
glut
of
gasoline
occurring
alongside
a
premium
on
by
the
end
of
the
year
all
industry
players
upstream
and
downstream
may
feel
as
if
they
have
run
a
marathon
