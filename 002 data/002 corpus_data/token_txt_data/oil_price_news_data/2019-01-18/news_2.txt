u.s. refiners rush to buy heavy oil as trump looks to punish maduro
refiners
in
the
united
states
are
stocking
up
on
heavy
crude
pushing
prices
higher
as
the
trump
administration
prepares
to
slam
more
punitive
measures
on
caracas
after
the
inauguration
of
nicolas
maduro
as
president
of
venezuela
for
a
second
term
after
elections
considered
illegitimate
by
reports
that
officials
from
the
presidential
administration
met
with
oil
industry
executives
to
discuss
the
measures
on
the
table
including
the
suspension
ofrefined
product
exports
to
venezuela
or
venezuelan
crude
oil
imports
into
the
united
coast
refiners
have
a
limited
choice
of
supplier
when
it
comes
to
heavy
crude
besides
local
grades
such
as
mars
they
import
the
heavy
crude
they
need
to
produce
more
than
just
gasoline
from
canada
venezuela
and
is
this
scarcity
of
alternatives
that
has
probably
stopped
trump
from
banning
venezuelan
oil
imports
so
far
although
the
blanket
import
ban
card
has
been
waved
around
a
couple
of
times
it
is
possible
that
things
may
have
changed
now
the
president
earlier
this
week
said
he
recognizes
the
president
of
the
venezuelan
national
assembly
an
opposition
politician
as
the
legitimate
president
of
the
oil
industry
is
strongly
against
such
a
radical
measure
for
obvious
reasons
a
barrel
of
mars
is
already
trading
at
a
premium
to
the
benchmark
wti
and
this
week
the
premium
jumped
by
us
a
barrel
in
just
two
days
what
s
more
refiners
simply
need
the
half
of
million
barrels
daily
they
took
in
from
venezuela
last
year
amid
the
canadian
crude
oil
production
cut
aimed
at
boosting
prices
and
a
continued
decline
in
mexican
oil
is
also
concern
among
experts
on
latin
america
advising
the
president
that
blanket
oil
sanctions
could
have
an
effect
opposite
to
the
desired
one
with
the
united
states
displaying
too
direct
an
involvement
in
venezuelan
domestic
