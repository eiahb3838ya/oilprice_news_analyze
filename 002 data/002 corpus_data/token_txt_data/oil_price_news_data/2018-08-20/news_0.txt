what caused oil’s longest losing streak in years?
oil
prices
seemed
to
have
leveled
off
after
seven
consecutive
weeks
of
weekly
declines
the
longest
streak
in
years
but
the
next
steps
are
unclear
in
the
battle
over
the
market
narrative
concerns
about
the
health
of
the
global
economy
are
up
against
the
potential
for
serious
supply
outages
in
iran
a
lot
could
change
by
the
end
of
this
year
but
as
the
summer
draws
to
a
close
it
isn
t
clear
which
narrative
will
win
fears
about
the
global
economy
have
moved
to
the
front
burner
in
recent
weeks
the
trade
war
between
the
and
china
still
threatens
to
drag
down
global
growth
although
the
news
that
the
and
china
will
resume
talks
this
week
for
the
first
time
since
june
seemed
to
buoy
the
markets
but
the
talks
will
be
conducted
at
a
lower
level
the
point
person
is
an
undersecretary
at
the
department
of
treasury
not
secretary
steven
mnuchin
which
raises
questions
about
the
authority
to
ink
a
importantly
treasury
isn
t
even
the
agency
that
leads
on
trade
that
adds
up
to
and
china
essentially
keeping
their
lines
of
communication
open
but
not
actively
seeking
a
resolution
in
any
big
way
at
least
not
from
this
the
talks
at
least
increase
the
odds
however
slightly
that
the
proposed
billion
in
tariffs
on
chinese
goods
do
not
go
forward
the
trade
representative
is
holding
a
process
beginning
this
week
to
look
at
those
the
meltdown
in
turkey
s
currency
the
lira
has
set
off
a
different
source
of
trouble
the
turmoil
spread
to
other
emerging
markets
dragging
down
a
whole
host
of
emerging
market
currencies
threaten
to
seriously
slow
down
demand
not
just
for
oil
but
for
a
range
of
commodities
the
bloomberg
commodities
index
has
declined
by
percent
this
month
and
by
more
than
percent
in
the
last
three
months
oil
prices
are
down
by
more
than
percent
since
may
of
course
commodity
prices
might
get
wiped
out
but
the
slowdown
would
also
be
true
of
the
global
economy
related
trump
administration
embraces
energy
dominance
agenda
other
emerging
markets
have
already
been
hit
evident
through
depreciating
currencies
investors
demanding
higher
yields
on
emerging
market
debt
and
a
jump
in
credit
default
swaps
on
this
debt
ing
wrote
in
a
note
however
saying
all
of
this
the
us
federal
reserve
seems
unlikely
to
deviate
from
its
plan
for
tighter
monetary
policy
which
should
remain
supportive
for
the
dollar
whilst
growing
emerging
market
risk
adds
further
support
to
the
if
the
fed
doesn
t
let
up
then
the
pressure
on
currencies
around
the
world
will
is
hard
to
imagine
that
such
a
scenario
doesn
t
directly
translate
into
a
significant
downward
revision
in
global
oil
demand
after
all
oil
is
priced
in
dollars
so
a
stronger
dollar
and
weaker
currencies
elsewhere
means
that
oil
is
vastly
more
expensive
that
is
especially
true
if
oil
prices
are
not
falling
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
the
dollar
and
oil
traded
inversely
but
that
relationship
has
weakened
recently
iea
is
for
now
sticking
with
its
forecast
of
oil
demand
growth
at
million
barrels
per
day
for
brent
oil
prices
are
up
percent
this
year
but
in
local
currencies
the
price
increase
is
much
bigger
in
turkey
oil
is
around
percent
more
expensive
and
there
has
been
a
similar
increase
in
argentina
in
brazil
russia
and
south
africa
oil
feels
about
to
percent
more
expensive
this
year
even
though
oil
has
only
climbed
by
about
percent
according
to
ing
in
hungary
india
poland
chile
indonesia
and
the
philippines
oil
is
to
percent
more
expensive
and
on
and
on
related
why
mexico
s
oil
production
could
fall
even
furtherprice
increases
of
that
magnitude
will
surely
cut
into
demand
but
the
picture
gets
muddied
when
governments
step
in
to
shield
their
countries
from
those
price
increases
ing
says
in
brazil
the
government
decided
to
fuel
prices
to
stave
off
crippling
protests
indonesia
announced
billion
in
subsidies
to
keep
prices
from
rising
malaysia
also
decided
to
fix
fuel
prices
for
the
rest
of
these
price
supports
could
blunt
the
price
signal
from
both
higher
global
oil
prices
and
weaker
currencies
keeping
demand
from
falling
by
more
than
it
would
the
story
is
bearish
for
crude
we
have
different
things
happening
at
the
same
time
the
global
economy
is
slowing
the
end
of
synchronized
growth
the
trade
war
potentially
acting
as
a
major
headwind
and
emerging
market
currencies
dragging
down
oil
supply
picture
remains
in
flux
with
the
potential
outage
of
of
iranian
supply
looming
but
the
demand
side
of
the
story
suddenly
looks
pretty
