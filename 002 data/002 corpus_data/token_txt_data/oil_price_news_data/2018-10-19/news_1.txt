oil
prices
at
a
barrel

too
high
and
unhealthy
for

supermajor
bp
said
on
the

of
an

quoted
dudley
as
saying
on
the
sidelines
of
the
conference
one
young
world
in
the
hague
in
my
mind
it
s
somewhere
between
and
a
barrel
the
world
can
live
with
this
dudley
and
developing
economies
like
india
south
africa
or
turkey
are
seeing
their
prices
of
gasoline
because
their
currencies
have
rapidly
depreciated
against
the
dollar
and
because
oil
prices
in
dollars
are
high
bp
s
chief
executive
oil
prices
are
artificially
high
due
to
venezuela
defying
gravity
and
to
the
sanctions
on
iran
according
to
dudley
who
said
that
once
those
geopolitical
events
subside
fundamentals
will
return
to
rule
the
market
and
prices
should
return
back
to
a
won

dudley
stressed
noting
that
i
think
it
s
full
of
related
what
killed
the
oil
price
rally
the
concerns
of
bp
s
chief
executive
that
oil
is
unhealthy
for
the
world
are
shared
by
major
international
organizations
such
as
the
international
energy
agency
iea
and
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
energy
is
back
and
it
is
threatening
global
economic
growth
the
iea
said
in
its
oil
market
report
last
last
week
the
imf
slightly
downgraded
its
projection
for
global
growth
for
this
year
and
percent
growth
is
now
expected
percentage
point
lower
than
imf
s
forecast
from
april
this
year
the
key
reasons
for
the
downgrade
included
trade
disputes
geopolitical
tensions
and
a
weaker
outlook
for
emerging
economies
due
to
higher
oil
import
bills
among
other
factors
