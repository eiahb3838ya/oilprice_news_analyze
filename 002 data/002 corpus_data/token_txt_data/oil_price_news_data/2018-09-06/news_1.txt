the next global oil hotspot
there
are
at

billion
untapped

of
crude

in
africa
the

two
years

during

oil
companies
bought
licenses
there

one
of
the

spots
a
newcomer
on
the
oil
scene
the

has
welcomed

the

sees
investments
of

made
into
its
oil
industry
during
the
next
three
to
four
years
and
plans
to
build
a
pipeline
to
the
tanzanian
coast
and
a
refinery
to
jumpstart
an
oil
industry
even
though
no
oil
is
being
produced
in
uganda

and
in
june
this

the
east
african
country
even
started
exporting
crude
under
a
pilot
scheme
that
would
see
bpd
trucked
to
the
port
city
of

and
stored
until
there

announced
that

an
example
of

that

senegal

seems
to
be
more
promising
in
gas
rather
than

with
its
only

field
chingetti
currently
being
decommissioned
yet
gas
is
increasing
in

and
if

mauritania
