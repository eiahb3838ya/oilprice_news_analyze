opec fears another downturn in oil
oil
prices
have
fallen
so
far
in
the
past
month
that
opec
is
clearly
growing
concerned
about
a
arabia
and
russia
will
explore
the
possibility
of
a
production
cut
for
a
move
intended
to
head
off
a
renewed
supply
glut
surging
shale
production
plus
higher
output
from
russia
saudi
arabia
the
uae
iraq
and
libya
has
more
than
offset
the
declines
from
iran
at
least
so
far
inventories
have
climbed
sharply
in
the
and
shale
production
in
recent
months
has
exceeded
a
production
cut
would
be
a
dramatic
turnaround
for
the
oil
cartel
which
until
recently
had
to
repeatedly
reassure
the
oil
market
that
supplies
were
adequate
and
that
they
were
prepared
to
meet
any
hypothetical
shortfall
with
fresh
course
correction
is
jarring
the
message
from
opec
looks
like
fasten

bob
mcnally
president
of
rapidan
energy
advisors
llc
told
bloomberg
opec
will
essentially
put
pedal
to
the
metal
to
boost
production
and
then
immediately
slam
the
brakes
pretty
hard
and
talk
about
cutting
saudi
arabia
has
been
worried
about
this
scenario
for
several
months
at
least
when
oil
prices
were
rising
over
the
summer
and
again
in
september
saudi
officials
pointed
to
upcoming
seasonal
demand
weakness
in
the
winter
there
are
more
demand
threats
next
year
compared
to
supply
threats
an
unnamed
saudi
source
told
reuters
in
september
still
the
markets
were
concerned
about
shortages
brent
jumped
to
the
per
barrel
and
there
was
widespread
speculation
about
the
extent
of
saudi
spare
month
and
a
half
on
riyadh
and
moscow
are
mulling
over
a
production
cut
a
lot
has
changed
in
such
a
short
period
of
time
libya
restored
a
huge
amount
of
disrupted
supply
saudi
arabia
ramped
up
production
to
million
barrels
per
day
up
bpd
since
the
opec
meeting
in
june
perhaps
most
importantly
the
has
been
producing
a
lot
more
oil
than
previously
thought
in
august
production
jumped
by
more
than
bpd
from
june
levels
an
unbelievably
large
oil
production
is
set
to
soar
past
million
bpdon
wednesday
the
eia
reported
yet
another
large
crude
oil
inventory
increase
with
stocks
jumping
by
million
barrels
in
the
first
week
of
november
up
to
million
barrels
shockingly
the
eia
said
the
produced
an
astounding
for
the
week
ending
on
november
the
weekly
figures
tend
to
be
a
bit
less
reliable
and
are
subject
to
revision
later
on
but
the
figure
is
still
a
sign
that
shale
production
is
growing
very
the
us
energy
information
administration
now
predicts
that
it
will
increase
to
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
second
quarter
of
originally
this
was
not
expected
to
happen
until
late
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
this
will
force
opec
to
reverse
its
latest
increase
in
oil
production
by
roughly
million
barrels
per
day
again
if
it
does
not
want
to
risk
a
massive
oversupply
and
a
further
slide
in
oil
to
top
it
off
the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
grant
waivers
to
eight
countries
importing
iranian
oil
takes
a
lot
of
the
edge
off
the
market
this
alone
helps
explain
a
lot
of
the
motivation
behind
saudi
arabia
s
renewed
interest
in
production
cuts
for
next
year
if
around
of
oil
exports
from
iran
is
no
longer
going
offline
that
almost
completely
removes
the
need
for
more
saudi
supply
with
iran
still
online
the
rest
of
opec
may
now
need
to
reduce
is
exactly
what
the
iranians
are
saying
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
increased
production
and
prices
have
come
down
a
barrel
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
iran
s
representative
to
opec
said
in
a
bloomberg
interview
they
have
the
market
and
now
need
to
eliminate
of
is
shale
the
future
for
big
oil
to
top
it
off
the
global
economy
is
facing
some
major
questions
marks
especially
as
we
head
into
any
slowdown
will
hit
crude
oil
demand
they
will
absolutely
want
to
at
some
point
next
year
try
to
arrange
a
reduction
in
production
said
ed
morse
head
of
commodities
at
citigroup
according
to
bloomberg
everything
points
to
a
fairly
weak
balance
the
world
economy
is
decelerating
the
china
trade
tensions
are
having
a
visible
impact
on
it
would
be
difficult
to
achieve
consensus
from
the
more
than
dozen
opec
member
countries
but
then
again
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
demonstrated
that
they
can
do
what
they
want
on
their
own
even
if
the
rest
of
opec
opposes
bottom
line
is
that
even
the
mere
rumor
of
a
production
cut
offers
some
evidence
that
the
oil
market
is
a
lot
looser
than
it
was
a
few
weeks
ago
the
head
of
the
iea
warned
that
the
oil
market
is
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
pointing
to
the
in
venezuelan
production
however
sentiment
has
clearly
shifted
the
market
has
yet
to
prove
that
it
can
hold
onto
a
rally
so
the
mood
is
still
very
negative
