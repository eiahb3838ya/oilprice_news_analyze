will china continue its canadian crude buying spree?
chinese
refiners
have
been
buying
a
lot
of
canadian
crude
oil
in
the
last
couple
of
months
taking
advantage
of
the
massive
discount
of
western
canadian
select
to
west
texas
intermediate
the
purchases
have
given
troubled
canadian
drillers
hope
for
the
future
that
even
without
the
trans
mountain
expansion
their
crude
could
expand
on
asian
purchased
million
barrels
of
heavy
canadian
crude
oil
for
loading
in
september
up
by
nearly
percent
compared
to
the
million
barrels
it
imported
from
canada
in
april
bloomberg
reported
last
month
quoting
data
by
and
intelligence
company
month
chinese
refiners
continued
buying
canadian
crude
with
tanker
loadings
bound
for
china
reaching
million
barrels
since
the
start
of
september
bloomberg
data
this
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
oil
if
it
were
a
million
barrels
daily
then
we
could
probably
speak
of
a
seismic
shift
in
the
export
markets
of
canadian
crude
a
shift
that
would
make
it
more
competitive
by
introducing
another
buyer
besides
refiners
even
at
the
current
level
though
the
chine
refiners
intake
of
canadian
crude
indicates
a
change
might
be
coming
yet
this
change
will
only
come
if
chinese
refiners
can
offer
canadian
producers
good
prices
that
beat
the
prices
that
the
west
coast
refiners
are
prepared
to
have
yet
to
see
how
this
plays
out
because
the
past
two
months
were
refinery
maintenance
season
in
the
united
states
and
a
lot
of
refineries
have
yet
to
ramp
up
to
full
production
this
means
that
they
have
yet
to
ramp
up
their
purchases
of
heavy
canadian
crude
that
they
need
to
make
fuels
and
this
means
the
chinese
buyers
have
yet
to
face
the
competition
of
the
refiners
related
oil
production
is
set
to
soar
past
million
bpdchances
are
they
will
face
it
with
a
smile
because
the
huge
discount
of
western
canadian
select
to
wti
is
not
the
only
reason
for
this
shift
the
other
reason
has
to
do
with
supply
china
s
two
other
main
sources
of
heavy
and
both
going
through
a
production
decline
albeit
for
different
reasons
so
chinese
refiners
simply
don
t
have
much
of
a
choice
when
it
comes
to
sourcing
the
heavy
crude
blends
that
they
need
when
one
supplier
can
not
deliver
you
turn
to
whoever
potentially
huge
market
is
what
motivated
the
expansion
of
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
that
turned
into
a
bone
of
contention
between
neighbors
british
columbia
and
alberta
however
there
is
little
chance
the
expansion
will
begin
anytime
soon
what
with
all
the
opposition
and
legal
challenges
from
environmentalists
and
first
nations
alberta
is
not
giving
up
the
fight
but
it
s
not
making
a
lot
of
progress
if
chinese
refiners
continue
to
buy
canadian
crude
even
without
the
cheaper
pipeline
channel
it
would
significantly
brighten
the
prospects
of
canada
s
oil
industry
the
problem
is
if
does
not
mean
will
one
additional
reason
for
the
surge
in
chinese
buying
of
canadian
crude
this
fall
was
the
peak
of
construction
season
hence
an
increased
asphalt
demand
hence
greater
heavy
crude
demand
as
construction
season
reaches
its
end
this
particular
demand
will
decline
with
it
yet
if
the
price
of
canadian
heavy
remains
attractive
even
after
refineries
ramp
up
chinese
companies
may
well
continue
to
buy
now
that
they
ve
got
a
taste
of
it
especially
since
venezuelan
production
is
still
declining
