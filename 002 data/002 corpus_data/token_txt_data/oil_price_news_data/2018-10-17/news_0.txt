u.s-saudi clash could spell disaster for opec
the
khashoggi
case
is
far
from
over
as
current
harsh
statements
coming
from
washington
are
only
is
there
a
long
line
of
senators
calling
for
an
investigation
of
the
matter
some
have
even
openly
called
for
the
removal
of
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
senior
lindsay
graham
one
of
the
staunchest
supporters
of
us
president
trump
and
saudi
arabia
has
broken
ranks
as
he
asked
on
us
to
remove
mbs
from
his
moves
from
washington
are
not
only
endangering
the
very
strong
ties
between
washington
and
riyadh
but
also
endanger
the
overall
middle
east
and
internal
stability
of
opec
the
oil
cartel
led
by
saudi
arabia
is
looking
at
a
very
stormy
ride
the
next
couple
of
months
while
the
is
heading
for
another
showdown
in
the
arab
khashoggi
case
has
become
a
possible
watershed
in
international
relations
statements
made
by
us
graham
already
supported
by
other
officials
show
that
the
position
of
saudi
arabia
as
a
strategic
ally
of
washington
in
the
middle
east
and
mbs
in
particular
is
under
severe
public
threat
made
by
graham
news
channel
to
put
strong
sanctions
on
saudi
arabia
if
the
crown
prince
is
not
being
removed
is
a
first
not
even
in
the
case
of
iran
russia
s
involvement
in
the
ukraine
or
the
ongoing
disaster
in
syria
an
open
call
was
made
for
regime
change
if
threats
were
made
by
senators
it
always
was
directly
linked
to
a
strong
opposition
movement
in
that
country
or
being
directed
at
an
government
or
time
the
threat
has
been
directed
at
a
until
weeks
ago
strongly
supported
ally
with
strong
ties
to
washington
policymakers
the
financial
world
and
the
defense
industry
president
trump
s
current
statements
on
saudi
arabia
the
moves
made
by
secretary
of
state
pompeo
and
others
now
seem
to
be
very
hollow
the
washington
administration
looks
like
a
lame
duck
as
its
supporters
in
congress
and
the
ny
financial
world
are
calling
for
a
strong
and
reaction
such
as
reactions
however
could
have
a
more
negative
impact
for
the
and
western
interests
than
currently
is
being
discussed
related
are
oil
exports
really
unstoppable
the
khashoggi
crisis
comes
at
a
pivotal
moment
in
the
energy
markets
and
geopolitical
arena
while
the
west
tries
to
revamp
its
influence
in
the
middle
east
they
are
being
confronted
by
the
of
russian
power
and
influence
of
china
at
the
same
time
washington
is
set
to
implement
sanctions
on
iran
possibly
shaking
global
energy
markets
to
its
foundations
strong
support
is
needed
from
the
arab
states
washington
s
approach
is
very
diffuse
as
it
also
threatens
legal
action
against
opec
the
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
or
nopec
legislation
is
threatening
lawsuits
against
the
oil
cartel
according
to
reuters
opec
has
already
stated
to
its
members
not
to
discuss
oil
price
hikes
as
it
could
result
in
legal
action
or
another
washington
riyadh
clash
we
solemnly
believe
that
market
stability
and
not
prices
is
the
common
objective
of
our
actions
uae
energy
minister
suhail
who
holds
the
rotating
opec
presidency
this
year
wrote
in
the
letter
seen
by
reuters
in
the
same
letter
mazroui
reiterated
that
to
refrain
from
any
reference
to
prices
in
their
commentary
about
our
collective
efforts
or
oil
market
condition
pressure
in
washington
to
put
the
law
up
for
voting
has
caused
bad
blood
in
several
opec
capitals
trump
s
repeated
calls
on
opec
to
increase
production
to
lower
prices
also
has
not
been
taken
lightly
the
khashoggi
case
could
increase
support
in
washington
to
back
the
nopec
bill
saudi
arabia
is
extremely
worried
about
the
bill
there
is
a
major
fear
nopec
could
turn
into
another
jasta
one
of
the
sources
familiar
with
aramco
ipo
preparations
said
referring
to
the
justice
against
sponsors
of
terrorism
act
which
allows
victims
of
the
attacks
to
sue
riyadh
at
present
trillion
in
saudi
investments
in
the
could
be
at
stake
if
the
nopec
bill
is
signed
into
law
the
move
would
revoke
the
sovereign
immunity
from
legal
action
which
oil
producers
including
opec
members
currently
addition
to
interests
in
the
region
europe
is
being
confronted
by
growing
russian
and
chinese
involvement
in
the
arab
world
threatening
in
theory
its
economic
and
military
interests
too
washington
s
strong
hand
policies
on
saudi
arabia
could
lead
to
a
weakening
of
overall
western
interests
in
the
coming
weeks
a
call
for
the
removal
of
mbs
in
saudi
arabia
is
for
sure
going
to
be
seen
in
the
other
arab
capitals
as
new
western
colonialist
betrayal
of
its
friends
in
the
uae
bahrain
and
egypt
western
influence
already
has
diminished
after
their
support
for
change
in
libya
and
egypt
the
current
western
moves
are
seen
by
most
in
this
possible
shift
in
geopolitical
alliances
is
imminent
the
pressure
from
the
west
will
entice
or
even
force
saudi
arabia
and
its
allies
to
reassess
their
future
as
indicated
before
saudi
arabia
has
already
opened
up
its
doors
to
russia
these
ties
were
forged
by
a
slump
in
oil
prices
and
the
need
to
strengthen
the
hold
of
the
kingdom
and
opec
on
the
oil
market
the
success
of
the
cooperation
has
become
clear
but
also
has
led
to
a
discussion
on
security
and
investments
the
historical
orientation
of
the
arab
world
especially
saudi
arabia
but
also
the
uae
and
egypt
on
the
west
has
changed
already
dramatically
but
will
now
take
a
giant
leap
asia
has
taken
over
already
as
immense
investments
made
by
oil
companies
such
as
aramco
and
adnoc
in
china
india
and
other
asian
emerging
markets
show
russia
has
taken
its
share
too
moscow
s
real
strength
however
next
to
markets
is
it
willingness
to
back
up
its
friends
in
time
of
need
a
military
alliance
is
on
the
table
looking
at
the
current
developments
the
security
of
the
arab
regimes
is
at
stake
so
choices
will
have
to
be
made
a
cooperation
between
riyadh
and
moscow
based
on
opec
oil
issues
and
security
developments
is
to
be
expected
in
the
next
months
the
first
signs
will
be
seen
in
riyadh
next
week
at
the
related
goldman
sachs
this
is
the
next
big
risk
for
oilfor
the
global
oil
markets
this
will
be
a
if
arab
regimes
need
to
get
security
and
political
support
from
moscow
and
beijing
western
energy
interests
are
at
stake
a
possible
law
as
proposed
in
the
will
only
add
to
this
the
year
could
become
the
year
of
a
new
geopolitical
oil
market
reality
full
cooperation
between
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
supported
by
the
uae
and
russia
will
present
washington
and
brussels
with
a
new
global
energy
market
situation
which
they
won
t
be
able
to
mitigate
s
strive
to
change
the
oil
market
which
already
was
a
fata
morgana
could
be
ended
before
the
first
green
sprout
is
showing
with
the
current
antagonistic
position
taken
by
washington
s
elite
a
clash
is
imminent
with
saudi
arabia
and
others
the
main
opec
leaders
will
keep
to
their
current
production
strategy
not
willing
to
open
up
their
taps
a
possible
stronger
move
to
keep
volumes
lower
than
expected
is
also
in
the
offing
as
saudi
arabia
is
not
forced
to
produce
at
current
levels
at
all
a
strong
reaction
is
to
be
expected
addition
to
a
smiling
putin
who
is
going
to
be
the
main
beneficiary
of
the
current
crisis
the
mullahs
in
tehran
will
be
enjoying
their
free
lunch
too
without
support
of
saudi
arabia
and
others
sanctions
on
iran
could
be
an
empty
threat
trump
can
forget
full
support
from
saudi
as
long
as
the
latter
is
under
pressure
iran
could
be
one
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
current
clash
the
regional
power
struggle
between
riyadh
and
tehran
could
be
put
aside
when
looking
at
a
pure
opec
strategy
consolidation
of
the
current
production
agreement
without
saudi
arabia
and
russia
filling
the
void
of
iran
s
oil
volumes
could
be
an
outcome
