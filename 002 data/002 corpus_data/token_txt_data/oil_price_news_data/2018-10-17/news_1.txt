oil price rally revives offshore oil sector
the
offshore
drilling
segment
of
the
energy
industry
was
among
the
hardest
hit
by
the
downturn
many
went
under
and
those
that
did
survive
were
on
their
last
legs
when
prices
began
to
climb
back
up
now
things
are
looking
up
and
the
sector
could
see
a
full
recovery
by
recalls
in
a
recent
story
how
offshore
drilling
rigs
fetched
around
us
per
day
during
the
worst
of
the
downturn
from
as
much
as
half
a
million
dollars
before
now
according
to
offshore
drilling
giant
transocean
it
is
raking
in
us
per
day
for
its
specialized
vessels
deployed
in
the
north
should
come
as
no
surprise
just
like
oilfield
service
providers
offshore
drillers
first
suffered
more
than
producers
and
are
now
reaping
the
benefits
of
a
recovering
industry
but
the
future
of
offshore
drillers
was
always
less
certain
than
that
of
the
oilfield
service
sector
as
a
whole
the
reason
offshore
drilling
is
as
a
rule
costlier
than
onshore
exploration
and
production
especially
in
deep
waters
in
a
environment
e
ps
are
naturally
opting
for
cheaper
resources
yet
this
is
by
no
means
the
whole
s
still
a
future
for
offshore
oil
and
it
s
not
too
bleak
in
fact
in
parts
of
the
world
it
s
rather
bright
with
these
parts
including
brazil
parts
of
south
america
and
perhaps
somewhat
surprisingly
given
its
legacy
status
the
north
sea
supermajors
are
in
a
rush
to
expand
their
footprint
in
these
hot
spots
and
they
will
need
rigs
to
explore
them
and
pump
the
crude
and
gas
the
drilling
sector
is
gearing
up
for
higher
the
second
quarter
of
last
year
offshore
drillers
retired
the
most
rigs
over
a
period
bloomberg
reported
at
the
time
citing
an
energy
advisory
firm
now
ihs
markit
has
forecast
that
in
global
drilling
rig
demand
will
hit
on
average
versus
its
estimate
for
this
year
which
is

riding
the
demand
growth
wave
trading
at
over
a
barrel
and
everyone
was
in
a
rush
to
the
new
generation
of
offshore
rigs
were
designed
for
depths
of
as
much
as
feet
but
they
weren
t
designed
for
idling
now
many
of
these
rigs
have
been
idled
for
two
or
more
years
and
besides
demand
is
shifting
to
smaller
more
flexible
and
ultimately
cheaper
vessels
as
producers
seek
to
extend
the
life
of
already
producing
fields
and
lower
the
costs
of
new
wonder
then
that
offshore
drillers
are
consolidating
the
biggest
deal
so
far
has
been
transocean
s
acquisition
of

rig
for
us
billion
in
cash
and

this
was
the
second
substantial
deal
for
transocean
since

a
couple
of
large

and
earlier
this
month
it
inked
a
deal
with
smaller

player
rowan
cos
worth

the
deal
includes

s
interest
in
a
joint
venture
with

for

rigs
is
unquestionably
set
for
a
rise
big

actively
working
on
its
reserves
replacement
and
energy
independents
are
eager
for
a
piece
of
the
offshore
pie
while
it
lasts
the
recent
consolidation
could
continue
allowing
the
survivors
to
better
position
themselves
for
this
rising
demand
it
would
also
help
them
to

better
