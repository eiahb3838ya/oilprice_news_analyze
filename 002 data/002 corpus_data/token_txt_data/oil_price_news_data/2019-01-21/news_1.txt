why opec+ output cuts take so long to materialize
the
oil
production
cuts
that
opec
and
its
partners
led
by
russia
agreed
at
the
end
of
last
year
are
proving
slower
to
materialize
than
most
observers
expected
with
russia
breaking
another
production
record
in
december
and
iran
s
and
venezuela
s
declines
in
output
slowing
down
that
s
one
of
the
main
conclusions
from
the
latest
edition
of
the
monthly
oil
market
report
by
the
international
energy
produced
million
barrels
of
crude
daily
last
month
and
according
to
the
iea
it
is
unclear
when
it
will
cut
and
by
how
russia
undertook
to
reduce
its
production
by
bpd
beginning
this
month
with
the
cuts
to
last
until
april
when
will
meet
to
review
the
results
of
its
latest
energy
minister
alexander
novak
warned
early
recently
it
would
be
difficult
for
russian
producers
to
cut
quickly
and
by
a
lot
due
to
weather
and
geological
conditions
in
the
cold
russian
winter
russia
can
not
cut
its
oil
production
too
quickly
novak
said
last
week
adding
that
there
were
plans
to
reduce
oil
production
by
bpd
to
bpd
in
january
as
part
of
the
new
deal
novak
also
added
that
plans
were
to
achieve
the
full
target
by
the
end
of
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
important
factors
to
watch
when
it
comes
to
cuts
but
it
appears
that
this
time
it
is
not
the
only
wild
card
in
the
deck
news
from
venezuela
and
iran
is
also
not
what
most
industry
watchers
might
have
reasonably
expected
and
this
will
also
weigh
on
prices
as
it
enhances
the
uncertainty
around
whether
opec
will
be
able
to
live
up
to
its
promises

world

most
geopolitically
charged
pipelinevenezuela
s
pdvsa
sealed
two
deals
recently
with
a
and
a
french
company
to
boost
its
oil
production
the
state
oil
company
offered
the
newcomers
more
lucrative
deals
than
usual
as
it
struggles
to
at
least
curb
the
inexorable
decline
in
output
the
chinese
are
also

for

s
total

as
a
result

slowed
to

half

the

there
was

of

from
the

according
to
data
cited
by
the
iea

it

according
to
opec
data
fell
during
that

iran
s
major
customers
to

volumes
than
was
previously
thought
more

will
remain
in
the
market
in
the
early
part
of
this
state
of
affairs
may
persist
beyond
the
first

as

as
many
expect
washington
to

russia
has

like

they

how

russia
will

with

and
iran

concern
about
a
global
slowdown
is
deepening
which
means
pressure
on
demand
the
cuts
may
work
to
mitigate
the
effect
of
this

for
how
