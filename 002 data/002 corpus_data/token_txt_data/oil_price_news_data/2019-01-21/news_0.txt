dropped
to

number
of
energy
funds
exclusively
focused
on
crude
oil

fell
in
the

period
to

and
fund
managers
expect
energy
funds
performance
to
continue
to
be
challenged
going
forward
because
investors
withdraw
money
from
such
funds
as
they
increasingly
see
commodities
as
an
unsafe
bet
or
place
in
which
to
pour
their
money
last
year
was
not
a
good
year
for
many
funds
because
