how high can trump push oil prices?
saudi
arabia
wants
oil
and
donald
trump
might
help
them
achieve
that
the
scenes
saudi
officials
are
eyeing
per
barrel
as
a
goal
which
would
help
plug
a
chronic
fiscal
deficit
but
more
importantly
it
would
inflate
the
value
of
saudi
aramco
ahead
of
the
company
s
ipo
next
until
only
recently
it
seemed
that
oil
prices
would
never
return
soaring
shale
production
promised
to
keep
oil
prices
low
forever
and
for
every
oil
analyst
that
predicted
a
rebound
in
prices
there
was
another
that
forecasted
a
the
market
is
dramatically
tighter
than
even
just
a
few
months
ago
opec
is
with
the
production
cuts
demand
is
growing
at
a
rapid
clip
and
the
inventory
surplus
is
virtually
gone
against
the
backdrop
of
a
much
tighter
oil
market
an
unexpected
supply
outage
could
push
things
over
the
trump
might
be
the
one
to
do
it
within
the
next
three
weeks
the
trump
administration
will
likely
decide
against
the
iran
nuclear
deal
which
could
lead
to
a
return
to
sanctions
there
has
been
constant
speculation
that
this
might
occur
especially
since
he
promised
in
january
he
would
stop
granting
waivers
for
iran
absent
major
changes
to
the
nuclear
deal
but
the
oil
market
really
began
to
come
around
to
the
idea
of
a
heightened
conflict
with
iran
in
march
when
trump
reshuffled
his
cabinet
and
nominated
some
belligerent
iran
hawks
to
his
the
world
s
most
profitable
oil
majorso
in
that
sense
the
specter
of
a
loss
of
oil
supply
from
iran
is
not
exactly
news
but
what
is
new
is
that
the
loss
of
iranian
oil
could
occur
against
a
much
tighter
oil
market
than
previously
expected
and
it
could
occur
at
a
time
when
saudi
arabia
may
balk
at
stepping
in
and
offsetting
the
losses
after
all
saudi
arabia
has
warmed
to
the
idea
of
bloomberg
survey
of
oil
market
analysts
finds
that
they
predict
a
chance
that
the
imposes
sanctions
on
iran
which
seems
oddly
low
given
the
fact
that
trump
has
john
bolton
and
potentially
mike
pompeo
chirping
in
his
it
s
certainly
well
above
percent
it
s
more
likely
than
not
it
firms
the
case
for
the
story
with
bolton
i
think
we
go
beyond
the
discussion
of
sanctions
are
we
going
to
start
thinking
about
regime
change
in
iran
helima
croft
chief
commodities
strategist
at
rbc
capital
markets
told
bloomberg
in
her
response
to
the
big
question
is
what
new
sanctions
on
iran
would
do
to
the
islamic
republic
s
oil
exports
iran
exports
around
million
barrels
per
day
and
estimates
on
the
effect
of
sanctions
runs
the
gamut
on
the
low
end
some
think
the
sanctions
would
have
a
minimal
impact
because
the
will
struggle
to
stitch
together
the
international
coalition
that
the
obama
administration
put
together
in
the
years
preceding
the
iran
nuclear
deal
a
group
that
succeeded
in
curtailing
iran
s
exports
by
more
than
the
upper
end
one
could
point
to
the
fact
that
it
isn
t
just
that
the
is
trying
to
prohibit
countries
from
buying
oil
but
that
the
treasury
could
ban
banks
and
companies
from
doing
business
with
the
if
they
continue
to
deal
with
iran
in
that
sense
it
would
still
be
tricky
for
europe
or
india
for
instance
to
defy
washington
in
other
words
even
without
allies
the
could
put
a
lot
of
iranian
supply
at
president
trump
is
wildly
unpredictable
and
not
always
open
to
reason
the
obama
administration
granted
waivers
and
grace
periods
to
countries
that
would
have
faced
hardship
if
they
stopped
purchases
of
iranian
oil
such
as
india
korea
and
japan
it
s
not
clear
that
trump
would
much
care
about
the
circumstances
of
individual
gadfly
notes
that
his
administration
s
indifference
to
the
sudden
turmoil
in
the
aluminum
market
stemming
from
sanctions
on
rusal
a
major
russian
aluminum
producer
suggests
trump
might
shrug
off
oil
market
why
natural
gas
prices
will
rise
this
summermoreover
there
is
an
even
more
poignant
example
of
the
trump
administration
s
willingness
to
sow
chaos
without
much
thought
to
the
consequences
the
unexpectedly
stiff
tariffs
on
china
have
sparked
retaliation
with
major
chinese
tariffs
set
to
go
into
effect
on
soy
corn
and
pork
the
american
agricultural
industry
is
up
in
arms
a
constituency
that
largely
supported
trump
in
the
in
the
aluminum
market
is
one
thing
but
enraging
american
farmers
is
another
if
trump
can
shrug
that
off
then
he
can
likely
handle
higher
oil
prices
to
top
it
off
the
oil
industry
another
important
trump
constituency
would
stand
to
benefit
from
higher
prices
blunting
the
political
recap
the
trump
administration
is
a
few
weeks
away
from
deciding
on
new
sanctions
on
iran
that
could
put
several
hundred
thousand
barrels
of
supply
at
risk
his
impulsiveness
might
mean
that
there
is
a
short
or
no
period
on
new
sanctions
or
that
very
few
countries
are
granted
leniency
this
is
occurring
against
a
backdrop
of
a
much
tighter
oil
market
and
any
new
outage
could
push
the
market
into
a
supply
deficit
meanwhile
saudi
arabia
which
is
really
the
only
country
that
has
the
wherewithal
to
do
something
about
it
is
content
to
let
the
market
overtighten
allowing
oil
prices
to
shoot
