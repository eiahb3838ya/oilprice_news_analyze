exxon to produce all of its oil despite peak demand fears
exxonmobil
was
forced
to
finally
acknowledge
the
possibility
that
future
climate
change
policy
could
lead
to
peak
oil
demand
a
serious
threat
to
the
company
s
operations
over
the
response
to
a
shareholder
resolution
passed
last
year
the
oil
major
just
released
a
report
that
recognizes
the
danger
of
peak
oil
demand
by
climate
change
policies
and
regulations
could
cut
into
oil
demand
leading
to
a
drop
in
consumption
by
this
scenario
oil
demand
would
decline
by
an
average
of
percent
per
year
with
the
lower
end
of
the
range
seeing
declines
of
percent
per
would
mean
that
global
oil
demand
would
decline
to
million
barrels
per
day
by
down
from
in
in
the
most
pessimistic
scenario
from
the
oil
industry
s
perspective
demand
drops
to
s
a
rather
bleak
picture
for
oil
and
one
echoed
by
a
long
list
of
analysts
environmental
groups
and
increasingly
the
oil
industry
itself
a
few
weeks
ago
a
report
coauthored
by
a
top
bp
official
lays
out
a
case
in
which
oil
demand
peaks
and
declines
ushering
in
an
era
of
permanently
lower
oil
exxon
was
clearly
issuing
the
report
under
duress
the
tone
of
exxon
s
pathway
scenario
suggests
that
the
company
doesn
t
really
see
it
playing
out
while
the
report
suggests
that
oil
demand
could
fall
exxon
goes
to
great
lengths
to
downplay
the
significance
arguing
that
o
il
demand
is
projected
to
decline
modestly
on
average
and
much
more
slowly
than
its
natural
rate
of
decline
from
existing
producing
fields
and
e
ven
under
a
pathway
significant
investment
will
be
required
in
oil
and
natural
gas
capacity
and
p
roduction
from
our
proved
reserves
and
investment
in
our
resources
continue
to
be
needed
to
meet
global
requirements
and
the
like
related
oil
prices
fall

the
oil
major
issued
a
second
report
outlook
for
energy
that
basically
undercut
its
own
report
on
a
future
in
this
more
bullish
report
exxon
predicted
oil
demand
would
rise
by
percent
through
essentially
the
opposite
conclusion
from
the
scenario
in
which
climate
policy
slashes
oil
can
tell
which
one
exxon
really
believes
because
it
says
it
uses
the
more
bullish
outlook
for
energy
report
to
help
inform
our
business
strategies

ultimately
exxon
predicts
that
it
will
be
able
to
produce
percent
of
the
total
oil
and
gas
reserves
that
it
has
in
its
portfolio
the
company
also
says
that
even
in
the
climate
scenarios
in
which
demand
falls
ongoing
investment
will
be
needed
to
offset
depletion
from
existing
fields
so
even
in
that
case
the
oil
major
still
believes
that
it
will
produce
nearly
all
of
the
oil
and
gas
it
has
on
its
books

shortage
tomorrowthat
is
the
justification
for
why
exxon
envisions
little
risk
related
to
climate
change
policies
exxon
says
that
only
a
small
portion
of
its
reserves
would
be
affected
by
climate
policy
but
in
those
situations
the
company
believes
that
investments
could
mitigate
emissions
and
associated
costs
which
could
make
them
viable
even
in
a
the
company
would
learn
a
lot
more
about
the
reserves
in
the
ensuing
decades
accordingly
we
believe
the
production
of
these
reserves
will
likely
remain
economic
even
under
the
scenarios
as
a
result
exxon
does
not
see
a
scenario
in
which
it
will
be
forced
to
leave
oil
in
the
ground
it
plans
to
produce
everything
it
has
even
in
the
face
of
tightening
climate
groups
say
that
is
exactly
the
problem
exxonmobil
s
own
analysis
assumes
the
world
will
continue
to
burn
through
oil
and
gas
to
drive
their
profits
and
keep
us
on
a
path
toward
global
temperatures
well
above
