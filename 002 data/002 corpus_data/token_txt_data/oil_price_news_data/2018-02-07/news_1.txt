should the saudis fear the permianâ€™s production potential?
the
permian
has
increased
its
oil
production
more
than
any
other
shale
basin
in
recent
years
and
it
even
had
its
production
growing
when
all
other
shale
plays
were
scaling
back
production
during
the
in
the
permian
in
west
texas
and
eastern
new
mexico
has
grown
so
much
that
the
basin
now
has
a
spare
production
capacity
second
only
to
saudi
arabia
s
capacity
that
permian
drillers
could
bring
online
in
active

the
permian
have
at
least
bpd
of
spare
production
capacity
that
could
even
be
as
much
as
million

the
increased
importance
that
shale
especially
in
the
permian
could
play
as
a
swing
producer
on
the
global
oil
for
decades
there
was
one
country

one

that
had

that

now
we
are
seeing
an
analog
to
that
in

capacity

estimated
to
be
around
million

saudi
arabia
has
had
the
greatest

in

has
usually
kept
more

million

defines

any

the

also
expects
the
permian
oil
production
to
grow
substantially
and
reach
at

million
bpd
in
a
