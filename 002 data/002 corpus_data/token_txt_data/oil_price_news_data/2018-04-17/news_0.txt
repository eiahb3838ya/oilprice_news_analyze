canadaâ€™s oil patch to turn profitable in 2018
canada
s
oil
patch
booked
three
consecutive
years
of
hefty
losses
after
the
oil
prices
crash
in
this
year
the
industry
is
set
to
post
a
very
slim
gross
first
profit
in
four
the
expectation
that
the
tide
is
finally
turning
for
canada
s
oil
producers
significant
challenges
remain
with
constrained
pipeline
capacity
and
limited
capability
to
expand
export
markets
the
biggest
of
them
all
the
conference
board
of
canada
said
in
a
report
last
industry
will
have
its
winners
and
laggards
this
year
analysts
say
but
as
a
whole
it
will
be
a
very
long
and
very
slow
recovery
of
revenues
for
the
canadian
oil
patch
the

oil
prices
and
production
will
help
the
oil
industry
to
turn
to
profitability
this
is

to
generate

to
reach
the
record
us

booked
in
until
when

we
just
don
t
expect
oil
prices
to
get
back
to
where
they
were
in
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future
and
so
the
end
result
is
that
it
s
a

oil
prices
wo
go
higher
than
cost
cuts
in
the
downturn
will
help
the
industry
to
enjoy
a
meager
combined
profit
this
year
but
the
sector
is
not
poised
to
return
to
booming
growth
in
financial
performance
and
only
the
very
best
of
the
projects
will
go
ahead
in
the
next
five
years
burt
told

canada
s
crude
oil
production
is
expected
to
rise
by
an
average
annual
rate
of
percent
between
and
with
the
vast
majority
of
that
increase
coming
from
the
oil
sands
however
the
competitiveness
of
canadian
producers
is
undermined
by
domestic
bottlenecks
in
pipeline
takeaway
capacity
and
surging
shale
production
the
conference
board
as
pipeline
capacity
in
western
canada
can
not
keep
up
with
growing
production
more
oil
has
to
be
shipped
by
rail
at
a
higher
cost
this
causes
a
price
differential
between
canadian
oil
prices
and
other
global
benchmarks
resulting
in
foregone
profits
for
canadian
oil
producers
canada
will
also
need
to
rely
on
new
pipelines
to
expand
into
new
export
markets
which
might
soon
become
crucial
given
soaring
oil
production
the
board
recent
months
transportation
bottlenecks
widened
the
discount
at
which

some
canadian
producers
have
started
to
actively
market
assets
trying
to
dispose
of
heavy
oil
portfolios
that
they
can
t
monetize
efficiently
others
have
slowed
down
production
in
response
to
increased
market
access
addition
kinder

trans
mountain
expansion
pipeline
designed
to
take
more
oil
out
of

to
the
british
columbia
hangs
in
the
balance
more
than
ever
before
after
kinder
morgan
said
it
would
suspend
the
project
entirely
if
the
legal
issues
surrounding
it
can
not
be
resolved
by
may
to
national
bank
financial
analysts
regulatory
and
fiscal
headwinds
continue
to
challenge
the
canadian
sector
creating
a
difficult
investment
the
bank
also
expects
canadian
oil
prices
to
continue
to
be
volatile
and
weak
through
due
to
the
limited

the
analysts
are
optimistic
that
some
producers
would
do
better
than
the

this
year
these
are

crescent

enerplus
corp
and
whitecap
natural
is
one
of
just
two
companies
that
analysts
at
peters
expect
to
report
rising
production
and
cash
flow
in
over
when
companies
start
to
report
earnings
later
this
month
the
other
is
tourmaline

corp
according
to

co
cenovus
energy
and
seven
generations
energy
will
also
outperform
the
industry
average
while
husky
energy
and
imperial
oil
are
expected
to
underperform
the

patch
may
be
in
for
a
profit
for
the
first
time
in

without
additional

capacity
the

could
see
its
competitiveness
