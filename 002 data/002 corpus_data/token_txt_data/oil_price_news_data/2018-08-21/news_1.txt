chinese oil futures remain high-risk endeavour
when
the
oil
futures
launched
earlier
this
year
opinions
were
split
one
camp
argued
with
passion
that
the
days
of
the
petrodollar
were
numbered
its
demise
a
certainty
the
other
camp
argued
with
just
as
much
passion
the
yuan
has
yet
to
catch
up
with
the
dollar
as
an
international
currency
and
the
chinese
futures
had
basically
as
much
of
a
chance
as
a
snowflake
in
six
months
later
opinions
remain
split
but
now
the
two
camps
have
some
facts
and
figures
in
their
arsenal
for
example
a
figure
for
the
camp
was
the
record
surge
in
trading
volume
in
june
to
million
tons
of
crude
for
delivery
in
september
this
translates
into
lots
compared
to
a
combined
million
lots
for
brent
and
wti
together
though
so
the
yuan
contract
still
has
a
way
to
go
to
catch
camp
however
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
going
for
it
after
six
months
of
trade
bloomberg
cites
traders
as
saying
that
the
exchange
rate
of
the
yuan
coupled
with
storage
costs
make
the
chinese
oil
contract
still
a
yuan
has
been
falling
in
recent
months
on
the
back
of
slowing
economic
growth
and
the
tariff
spat
with
the
united
states
there
is
a
lot
of
space
for
surprises
however
and
unpredictability
is
not
something
traders
like
so
exchange
rates
are
one
thing
that
could
put
them
off
the
yuan
costs
in
china
are
another
problem
they
are
much
higher
than
elsewhere
us
per
barrel
per
month
in
the
shanghai
international
energy
exchange
compared
with
us
per
barrel
per
month
at
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
bloomberg
reports
the
reason
for
the
higher
cost
is
limited
storage
capacity
availability
and
the
requirement
that
the
cargo
be
stored
at
a
specific
storage
facility
rather
than
at
any
available
related
the
weakest
eia
report
in
yearsso
in
light
of
these
unpleasant
facts
what
does
the
futures
contract
have
going
for
them
well
apparently
they
could
make
sellers
richer
than
if
they
choose
to
trade
middle
east
grades
the
yuan
contract
last
week
traded
at
a
considerable
premium
to
all
other
oil
futures
with
the
premium
to
the
middle
east
benchmark
at
us
per
barrel
that
makes
a
profit
of
us
million
for
a
cargo
according
to
bloomberg
not
a
small
sum
but
is
it
worth
all
the
risks
perhaps
it
is
and
perhaps
it
isn
t
but
it
looks
like
it
is
still
too
early
to
say
the
seriousness
of
the
risks
after
all
is
relative
this
was
evidenced
in
the
trading
interest
in
yuan
futures
in
early
june
that
some
observers
quoted
by
s
p
global
platts
attributed
to
the
heightened
price
volatility
in
the
brent
and
wti
benchmarks
on
the
other
hand
storage
costs
are
a
fixed
problem
that
is
not
about
to
go
away
it
s
a
risk
that
traders
have
probably
already
learned
to
factor
into
their
calculations
exchange
rates
are
another
cesspool
of
volatility
but
volatility
is
a
sword
economic
data
from
china
may
still
surprise
positively
as
it
has
before
despite
the
however
the
question
of
whether
the
petrodollar
will
be
replaced
by
the
petroyuan
is
moot
the
reason
for
this
is
simple
the
dollar
is
the
international
reserve
currency
because
most
oil
is
traded
in
dollars
says
international
relations
professor
and
china
expert
douglas
bulloch
it
is
the
international
reserve
currency
because
of
the
size
and
nature
of
the
economy
therefore
the
only
way
for
china
to
succeed
in
having
its
currency
stand
a
fighting
chance
against
the
greenback
is
to
continue
opening
up
its
economy
oil
trading
is
only
