maduro asks opec for help as u.s. sanctions bite
nicolas
maduro
has
asked
opec
to
support
one
of
its
founding
the
sanctions
on
the
latin
american
country
s
oil
industry
and
denounce
the
shameless
dispossession
of
venezuelan
assets
but
maduro
s
plea
has
fallen
on
deaf
ears
reuters
reported
on
the
end
of
january
the
imposed
sanctions
on
pdvsa
to
help
prevent
further
diverting
of
venezuela
s
assets
by
maduro
and
preserve
these
assets
for
the
people
of
venezuela
the
path
to
sanctions
relief
for
pdvsa
is
through
the
expeditious
transfer
of
control
to
the
interim
president
or
a
subsequent
democratically
elected
government
secretary
of
the
treasury
steven
mnuchin
and
many
european
countries
have
recognized
juan
guaid√≥
as
the
interim
president
of
venezuela
while
maduro
is
supported
by
russia
china
and
sanctions
block
all
payments
to
pdvsa
accounts
and
buyers
of
venezuelan
crude
are
directed
to
deposit
payments
in
a
separate
account
to
which
pdvsa
doesn
t
have
a
january
letter
sent
to
opec
s
secretary
general
mohammad
barkindo
which
reuters
has
seen
maduro
writes
our
country
hopes
to
receive
the
solidarity
and
full
support
of
the
member
countries
of
opec
and
its
ministerial
conference
in
the
fight
we
are
currently
having
against
the
illegal
and
arbitrary
intrusion
of
the
united
states
in
the
internal
affairs
of
i
seek
your
firm
support
and
collaboration
to
jointly
denounce
and
face
this
shameless
dispossession
of
important
assets
of
one
of
the
members
of
opec
maduro
socialist
leader
s
argument
in
seeking
support
from
opec
is
that
the
sanctions
would
have
impact
on
the
global
oil
market
and
prices
and
that
they
represent
a
risk
to
other
members
of
the
cartel
according
to
an
opec
source
however
the
cartel
has
declined
to
make
any
official
statement
on
the
issue
because
it
is
concerned
with
oil
policy
not
year
when
asked
by
iran
for
support
opec
did
not
issue
any
formal
comments
on
the
sanctions
