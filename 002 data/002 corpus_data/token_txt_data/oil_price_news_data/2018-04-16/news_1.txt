is trumpâ€™s offshore drilling plan a disaster?
the
trump
administration
has
had
to
rein
in
expectations
for
offshore
oil
drilling
with
an
aggressive
sales
pitch
and
boastful
rhetoric
mostly
being
met
with
tepid
interest
from
the
oil
march
oil
and
gas
companies
only
bought
about
percent
of
the
acreage
on
offer
in
the
largest
offshore
auction
in
history
the
disappointing
figures
came
after
a
lot
of
hype
from
the
trump
administration
including
discounted
royalty
secretary
of
interior
ryan
zinke
struck
a
much
more
contrite
tone
in
his
testimony
to
congress
last
week
after
proposing
an
aggressive
offshore
drilling
plan
in
january
which
was
met
with
pushback
from
most
coastal
states
states

local
voices
matter
you
matter
and
governors
matter
zinke
told
a
house
panel
i
think
i
know
exactly
where
everyone
sits
on
both
coasts
we
are
shaping
our
plan
this
is
not
a
rule
this
is
a
opposition
has
come
from
both
republican
and
democratic
coastal
states
up
and
down
both
the
atlantic
and
pacific
coasts
the
political
headwinds
combined
with
the
high
cost
of
producing
in
completely
new
areas
would
likely
keep
investment
on
the
sidelines
something
that
zinke
admitted
in
his
what
s
also
happening
there
is
no
doubt
that
drilling
offshore
is
more
risky
than
onshore
investments
are
moving
onshore
to
the
permian
shale
drilling
region
that
is
less
risky
he
said
unlike
the
gulf
coast
there
is
no
subsea
infrastructure
zinke
said
you
would
have

disappointing
results
from
the
massive
march
auction
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
has
also
forced
a
revision
of
expectations
if
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
struggling
where
political
support
is
strong
infrastructure
is
well
developed
and
reserves
are
well
understood
the
prospect
of
moving
forward
on
atlantic
and
pacific
drilling
seems
out
of
reach
even
before
one
considers
the
tough
political
a
new
report
says
that
the
results
of
the
march
offshore
auction
are
not
as
bad
as
everyone
thinks
the
relatively
poor
results
were
more
a
factor
of
the
administration
s
rhetoric
as
opposed
to
anything
surprising
or
negative
about
the
actual
results
tommy
beaudreau
a
former
director
of
the
bureau
of
ocean
energy
management
boem
in
the
interior
department
wrote
in
a
report
for
columbia
university
s
center
on
global
energy
fact
the
results
were
relatively
healthy
and
reflect
trends
in
offshore
development
strategies
and
market
conditions
that
have
taken
hold
over
the
past
several
years
and
likely
will
the
recovery
of
oil
prices
is
still
rather
recent
and
several
years
of
low
prices
have
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
capital
expenditures
beaudreau
offshore
gulf
of
mexico
has
to
compete
with
other
oil
assets
around
the
world
including
onshore
shale
which
has
shorter
lead
times
a
significant
advantage
for
oil
companies
particularly
when
the
market
forecast
remains
highly
uncertain
this
competition
did
not
exist
a
decade
ago
when
the
gulf
of
mexico
accounted
for
a
significantly
higher
proportion
of
domestic
oil
and
gas
production

rallyhe
also
argues
that
the
industry
has
dramatically
lowered
production
costs
and
moving
forward
will
remain
much
more
disciplined
that
means
that
instead
of
buying
up
speculative
acreage
in
auctions
as
in
the
past
oil
companies
are
increasingly
focused
on
a
strategic
approach
to
leasing
decisions
which
has
led
to
a
more
modest
results
in
auctions
companies
are
focusing
on
lease
blocks
that
are
in
prospective
areas
fit
well
with
their
portfolio
and
are
close
to
existing
accessible
infrastructure
and
facilities
beaudreau
says
the
bottom
line
he
argues
is
that
the
march
auction
was
not
a
disappointment
but
a
reflection
of
this
new
era
in
which
companies
pursue
a
more
methodical
the
oil
majors
have
spent
heavily
in
auctions
in
mexico
and
brazil
in
recent
months
a
sign
that
they
are
more
interested
in
offshore
basins
that
have
remained
off
limits
to
them
up
until
only
trump
administration
has
been
trying
to
assert
energy
dominance
and
an
aggressive
offshore
plan
was
part
of
that
even
if
interest
from
the
industry
is
not
a
total
disaster
offshore
spending
and
exploration
