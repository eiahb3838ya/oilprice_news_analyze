saudis tread on thin ice as prices slide
energy
planners
in
saudi
arabia
must
be
scratching
their
heads
in
wonder
even
possibly
despair
the
kingdom
had
picked
itself
up
after
threats
of
near
economic
collapse
in
amid
a
then
oversupply
scenario
in
global
oil
markets
with

that
dropped

things
are
looking
grim

up

ranging

had
enough

were

to
