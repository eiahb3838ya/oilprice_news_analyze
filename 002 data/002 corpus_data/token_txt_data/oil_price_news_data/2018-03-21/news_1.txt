delegates
from
the
a
meeting
in
vienna
on
monday
delegates
discussed
moving
the
goalposts
by
possibly
adopting
a
different
measure
for
the
global
oversupply
than
they
are
currently
using
the
deal
officially
targets
a
reduction
in
commercial
stocks
in

countries
down
to
their
average
the
delegates
did
not
reach
any
decision
this

and
the
final
decision
is
in

hands
of
the

bloomberg
many
of
the
proposals
discussed
included
moving
the
average
that
would
make
opec
and
friends
goal
harder
to
achieve
one
proposal
considered
measuring
the
oecd
commercial
stocks
against
the
it
is
suggests
taking
out
years
of
high
inventories
from
the
equation
another
proposal
was
to
use
the
average
as
the
primary
metric
yet
another
discussion
was
about
using
a
period
of
more
than
seven
years
to
measure
the
inventories
in
developed
economies
according
to
delegates
who
spoke
to
the
longer
average
period
or
not
counting
the
years
of
the
worst
glut
would
make
achieving
the
new
average
more
difficult
and
could
require
a
longer
period
of
cuts
