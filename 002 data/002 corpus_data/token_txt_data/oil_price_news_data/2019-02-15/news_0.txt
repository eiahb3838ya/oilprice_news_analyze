reports
citing
a

an
earlier
report
from
marketwatch
quoted
information
from
energy
intelligence
suggesting
production
at
the
filed
had
completely
stopped
sparking
worry
about
global
heavy
oil
worry
was
justified
with
venezuela
sliding
more
deeply
into
chaos
and
with
new
sanctions
reducing
the
flow
of
venezuelan
heavy
crude
to
refineries
another
heavy
field
outage
is
exactly
what
the
market
does
not
has
a
production
capacity
of
over
million
barrels
of
heavy
crude
reason
enough
for
the
market
to
get
excited
or
worried
or
both
however
now
that
there
is
more
information
about
the
possible
cause
of
the
outage
and
its
extent
this
excitement
or
worry
might
calm
or
without
a
field
outage
however
saudi
arabia
has
once
again
played
the
star
role
in
helping
oil
prices
recoup
some
of
the
losses
suffered
late
last
year
the
kingdom
has
been
reducing
its
production
by
more
barrels

it
was
obliged

leading

decline
last
arabia
plans
to
reduce
its

production
further
to
million

energy
minister
khalid
said
in
an
interview
for
the

times
this
compares
with
more
than
million

produced
in
november
exports
said
will
also
fall
substantially
over

month
and
next
to
an
average
of
million
bpd
from
million

in

more
immediate
term
however

a

the
