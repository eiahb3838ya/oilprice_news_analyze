canada bets on trans mountain expansion to sell oil in asia
canada
may
be
the
fourth
largest
producer
and
third
largest
exporter
of
oil
in
the
world
but
it
has
one
sole
customer
of
its
united
the
end
of
last
month
canada
took
a
step
toward
ensuring
that
its
oil
would
have
an
export
outlet
to
the
world
s
energy
market
believe
that
the
federal
government
stepping
in
to
save
the
trans
mountain
expansion
project
has
boosted
the
chances
that
the
pipeline
will
be
built
and
give
canada
an
export
outlet
from
the
pacific
coast
to
the
asian
markets
the
industry
is
cautiously
optimistic
but
some
companies
say
that
canada
must
do
more
to
level
the
playing
field
for
its
year
canada
s
crude
oil
exports
increased
by
percent
annually
to
million
bpd
of
those
exports
to
destinations
other
than
the
accounted
for
just
percent
of
all
according
to
data
by
the
national
energy
board
neb
to
congested
takeaway
capacity
and
lack
of
enough
pipelines
to
either
the
pacific
or
the
atlantic
coasts
canada
s
oil
is
currently
priced
at
a
huge
discount
to
the
benchmark
the
discount
at
which
western

this
opposition
in
british
columbia
has
forced
kinder
morgan
to
reconsider
its
commitment
to
expand
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
that
would
increase
the
daily
capacity
of
the
pipeline
to
bpd
from

so
the
government
of
canada
reached
an
agreement
with

uncertaintythe
canadian
push
to
seek
more
customers
and
higher
prices
for
its
oil
coincides
with
a
heightened
trade
dispute
between
the
and
you
could
argue
the
timing
was
intentional
but
this
was
going
on
well
before
nafta
renegotiations
dana
peterson
and
canada
economist
at
citigroup
told
cnbc
the
canadian
government
needs
another
venue
for
evacuating
oil
and
that
s
westward
they
need
another
buyer
and
that
s
canada
owning
trans
mountain
greatly
boosts
the
chances
of
the
project
although
it
s
not
a
certainty
yet
according
to
analysts
as
a
crown
corporation
it
would
have
a
better
standing
in
these
challenges
jackie
forrest
vice
president
of
energy
research
at
arc
financial
group
told
cnbc
referring
to
the
several
lawsuits
against
the
project
that
has
filed
in
recent
to
new
to
asia
in
which
all
other
major
oil
exporters
compete
to
important
to
both
canada
s
oil
industry
and
government
according
to
the
prices
to
asia
minus
the
transportation
costs
means
every
barrel
that
goes
to
asia
would
get
a
higher
price
than
it
would
in
north
america
because
of
the
discount
for
wti
west
texas
intermediate
selling
it
to
north
america
is
not
nearly
as
profitable
as
selling
into
asia
forrest
told
the
amount
of
canadian
oil
that
would
be
shipped
to
asia
is
not
huge
the
be
a
for
canada
s
oil
industry
according
to
john
kilduff
partner
with
again
this
move
by
the
canadian
government
to
build
the
pipeline
sets
up
a
future
rivalry
for
asian
market
share
kilduff
told
the
tmep
trans
mountain
expansion
pipeline
is
critical
infrastructure
needed
to
move
canadian
energy
to
world
markets
and
restore
investor
confidence
in
canada
s
economy
and
political
system
it
signals
canada
is
open
to
business
and
energy
trade
with
international
investors
the
canadian
association
of
petroleum
producers
capp
said
commenting
on
the
government
s
move
to
buy
the
pipeline
related
was
this
just
a
temporary
pullback
in
oil
however
steve
williams
chief
executive
of
one
of
the
biggest
canadian
producers
suncor
is
more
cautious
and
says
that
his
view
that
canada
is
lagging
behind
in
competitiveness
hasn
t
changed
with
the
government
buying
trans
mountain
although
he
is
confident
the
pipeline
will
be
on
the
one
hand
it
s
a
clear
unambiguous
commitment
that
it
s
a
piece
of
infrastructure
which
is
in
the
national
interest
and
needs
to
be
built
on
the
other
hand
it
s
also
recognizing
that
the
normal
processes
didn
t
work
very
well
williams
said
this
will
not
be
splashing
money
on
new
growth
projects
because
canada
s
oil
industry
s
competitiveness
is
not
in
great
shape
williams
and
competitiveness
for
me
is
the
sum
of
all
those
things
so
royalties
taxation
regulatory
certainty
confidence
in
regulators
today
and
in
the
future
and
we
need
to
make
some
progress
