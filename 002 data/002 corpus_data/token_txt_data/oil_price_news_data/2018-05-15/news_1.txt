u.s. shale oil production rises at record-breaking rate
shale
oil
production
in
the
united
states
will
rise
by
a
bpd
from
may
to
june
hitting
million
bpd
the
energy
information
administration
estimated
in
its
latest
drilling
productivity
surprisingly
the
permian
will
lead
the
way
with
a
increase
in
production
from
million
bpd
this
month
to
million
bpd
in
june
the
permian
will
be
followed
by
eagle
ford
where
average
daily
oil
production
will
rise
by
bpd
from
million
bpd
to
million
only
shale
play
that
will
not
register
an
increase
in
oil
production
will
be
haynesville
where
gas
production
however
will
grow
by
million
cu
ft
monthly
gas
production
increase
in
the
shale
patch
the
highest
will
be
in
appalachia
where
gas
production
will
rise
by
million
cu
ft
between
may
and
the
increase
in
production
is
not
without
problems
especially
in
the
permian
production
there
is
rising
so
fast
the
transport
infrastructure
can
not
keep
up
with
it
and
bottlenecks
are
beginning
to
to
analysts
the
current
pipeline
capacity
in
the
permian
will
be
exceeded
by
the
middle
of
the
year
which
means
new
ones
need
to
be
built
urgently
there
are
already
proposals
for
new
capacity
of
a
total
million
bpd
and
strong
interest
from
producers
who
are
concerned
about
the
discount
their
oil
would
have
to
trade
to
other
shale
crudes
because
of
the
transport
of
these
is
the
epic
pipeline
which
will
be
able
to
carry
bpd
of
permian
crude
to
refineries
and
other
buyers
the
company
behind
the
project
epic
midstream
holdings
has
received
commitments
for
almost
a
third
of
the
planned
capacity
from
apache

chances
are
more
