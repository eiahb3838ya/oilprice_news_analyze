what’s in store for opec in 2019?
opec
has
come
through
some
turbulent
times
in
the
last
few
years
as
oil
prices
fell
to
decade
lows
it
has
implemented
production
cuts
has
rallied
russia
to
climb
onboard
the
production
cut
train
has
weathered
the
rise
of
us
shale
to
highs
has
extended
those
production
cuts
has
lifted
production
to
quell
a
nervous
market
sanctions
and
then
has
managed
to
pull
a
rabbit
out
of
a
hat
by
agreeing
to
yet
another
production
opec
is
not
finished
we
approach
the
new
year
the
opec
is
facing
another
set
of
challenges
here
are
some
of
the
challenges
they
will
face
in
manuel
quevedo
opec
s
leadership
is
crucial
to
its
success
it
operates
under
a
rotating
presidency
and
for
that
honor
is
bestowed
upon
none
other
than
venezuela
s
manuel
quevedo
has
zero
oil
industry
experience
taking
over
venezuela
s
pdvsa
and
oil
minister
of
the
nation
which
is
pretty
much
the
same
thing
instead
quevedo
s
experience
is
with
the
military
serving
as
national
guard
major
general
prior
to
his
position
as
czar
in
a
country
that
is
falling
apart
at
the
seams
quevedo
was
appointed
in
late
to
right
the
wrong
ship
that
is
was
given
extra
s
call
it
a
special
create
annul
or
modify
deals
involving
pdvsa
its
subsidiaries
his
reign
dispensed
with
nearly
pdvsa
executives
in
a
massive
sweep
that
some
have
labeled
a
mere
power
grab
despite
maduro
s
insistence
to
the
has
been
so
far
unable
to
right
the
ship
with
venezuela
s
oil
production
and
oil
revenues
falling
at
unprecedented
rates
even
when
oil
prices
rallied
quevedo
has
instead
instilled
fear
into
pdvsa
workers
and
has
implemented
some
policies
that
some
argue
have
brought
pdvsa
closer
further
brink
of
maduro
loyalist
through
and
through
quevedo
will
now
take
over
not
only
pdvsa
and
venezuela
s
oil
industry
but
will
assume
the
rotating
presidency
of
the
most
influential
oil
industry
body
in
the
world
but
his
lack
of
experience
is
only
part
of
the
trouble
opec
has
been
the
target
of
tweets
by
us
president
donald
to
that
president
trump
s
vehement
opposition
to
subject
of
us
opec
may
find
itself
even
more
of
a
target
the
worst
thing
for
opec
would
be
for
venezuela
s
tenuous
relationship
with
washington
to
mar
opec
s
already
tenuous
relationship
with
ubs
expect
brent
next
yearquevedo
is
also
strongly
backing
el
alleged
has
supposedly
been
invited
by
opec
to
speak
about
the
rise
of
el
petro
sometime
in
another
hurdle
opec
faces
in
is
the
proposed
us
legislation
that
would
allow
legal
claims
against
opec
for
manipulating
oil
prices
called
the
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
nopec
in
opec
advised
its
members
to
stop
referring
to
oil
prices
specifically
instead
urging
them
to
use
phrases
such
as
balanced
market
and
the
like
opec
s
preemptive
strike
speaks
to
the
plausibility
that
this
legislation
could
be
passed
as
president
donald
trump
s
strained
relationship
with
opec
plays
out
on
twitter
and
in
the
legislative
walked
out
of
opec
just
one
month
ago
potentially
distancing
itself
from
this
legislation
that
if
passed
would
open
up
a
whole
can
of
legal
issues
for
the
cartel
as
it
would
end
laws
revoking
the
sovereign
immunity
that
until
now
has
protected
opec
members
from
legal
actions
regarding
price
libya
managed
to
secure
an
exemption
from
the
opec
production
cuts
that
will
go
into
effect
on
january
allegedly
due
to
its
unstable
oil
production
that
ebbs
and
flows
as
infighting
continues
to
batter
its
oil
industry
like
a
plague
but
this
exemption
and
its
chronic
outages
of
its
largest
oilfield
sharara
poses
a
challenge
to
opec
who
is
struggling
to
balance
production
with
demand
as
libya
s
production
increases
and
decreases
opec
has
difficulty
responding
immediately
to
offset
the
ebbs
and
flows
and
no
single
country
has
been
least
not
to
our
increase
or
decrease
production
to
offset
libya
s
production
the
unknowns
with
libya
create
an
unknown
for
all
of
et
al
the
signees
of
the
deal
to
cut
production
expose
opec
to
a
greater
risk
opec
needs
heavyweight
russia
on
board
with
the
production
cuts
russia
has
agreed
to
cut
production
along
with
several
other
lesser
producers
but
it
has
also
said
that
it
will
be
a
gradual
production
cut
beginning
in
january
but
not
reaching
full
cut
volumes
until
march
here
russia
holds
some
sway
exacerbated
by
its
cozy
relationship
with
venezuela
and
major
general
quevedo
who
has
been
the
recipient
of
substantial
loans
courtesy
of
russia
s
generosity
opec
has
recruited
russia
out
of
necessity
and
being
in
bed
with
russia
exposes
opec
to
greater
risks
should
russia
renege
on
the
deal
with
opec
the
production
cut
agreement
would
be
largely
toothless
related
canada

dream

nightmarespeculators
oil
prices
still
respond
to
opec
chatter
leaked
information
statements
to
the
press
and
monthly
production
figures
that
either
show
opec
s
success
in
hitting
professed
production
targets
but
the
latter
half
of
saw
the
beginning
of
a
partial
immunity
to
such
news
and
as
the
oil
market
continues
its
recently
acquired
anxiety
disorder
is
unlikely
to
look
much
different
what
opec
could
previously
achieve
with
a
mere
promise
to
curb
production
or
increase
production
will
now
be
met
with
increasing

the
new

for

the

has
been
a
thorn
in
opec
s
side

rolled

prior
to
its

round
of

shale
will
continue
to
be
so
throughout
as
production
increases
continue
unabated
unlike
opec
members
us
shale
producers
are
only
inhibited
by
price
and
even
that
has
proven
to
be
a
nondeterrent
to
increasing
production
for
every
barrel
that
opec
doesn
t
produce
oil
producers
in
the
united

will
happily
export

its
stead
the

dog
when
it
comes
to
oil
production
at
million
bpd
toward
the
end
of
has
taken
much
wind
out
of
opec
s
sails
making
it
more
difficult
for
opec
to
manipulate
the
market
this
will
continue
throughout
will
have
an
uphill
battle
in
but
its
influence
as
a
cartel
should
not
be
dismissed
entirely
the
oil
market
in
will
be
largely
affected
by
not
by
opec
as

major
players

market
