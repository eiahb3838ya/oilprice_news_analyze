will the u.s. compromise on iran oil sanctions?
some
of
the
united
states
closest
allies
are
scrambling
to
find
a
way
around
the
latest
sanctions
of
the
trump
administration
against
tehran
and
washington
may
have
to
revise
its
goal
of
reducing
iranian
oil
exports
to
recently
reported
citing
unnamed
sources
in
the
know
that
japan
for
one
might
have
to
stop
loading
iranian
crude
in
september
unless
it
manages
to
score
a
waiver
with
the
state
korea
earlier
denied
reports
that
it
will
stop
buying
iranian
crude
from
july
but
now
there
are
more
reports
saying
that
the
country
one
of
the
world
s
top
oil
importers
is
having
problems
with
tanker
insurance
as
some
of
the
largest
maritime
insurers
refuse
to
touch
iranian
vessels
under
the
shadow
of
is
yet
another
case
in
point
the
world
s
economy
has
been
importing
iranian
crude
at
an
average
daily
rate
of
bpd
since
the
start
of
the
year
this
makes
it
iran
s
client
after
china
and
the
nation
that
is
struggling
most
as
the
sanctions
start
date
problem
is
not
exclusively
related
to
commodities
however
iran
s
oil
clients
have
also
been
actively
working
to
improve
bilateral
relations
after
the
inking
of
the
nuclear
deal
japanese
companies
were
beginning
to
look
toward
iran
as
an
attractive
investment
destination
a
senior
economist
from
japan
research
institute
told
the
japan
times
is
by
no
means
the
only
country
looking
for
new
investment
opportunities
in
iran
india
has
also
been
planning
substantial
investments
in
iran
and
just
yesterday
iran
criticized
new
delhi
for
failing
to
make
good
on
a
promise
to
finance
the
expansion
of
a
strategic
port
the
deputy
ambassador
of
tehran
in
india
warned
the
country
that
iran
will
strip
it
of
its
special
privileges
if
it
stops
buying
iranian
crude

the
biggest
mystery
in
oil
marketsfor
japan
south
korea
and
india
the
problem
of
oil
supplies
is
actually
one
of
balancing
interests
we
are
in
a
knotty
situation
as
we
have
to
listen
to
the
but
at
the
same
time
iran
is
an
important
supplier
of
crude
and
condensate
a
research
fellow
from
the
korea
energy
economics
institute
told
bloomberg
it
s
the
trump
administration
that
we
are
dealing
with
and
that
unpredictability
is
stoking
concern
among
refiners
and
petrochemical
companies
in
asia
making
them
voluntarily
cut
their
shipments
from
iran
before
the
it
seems
some
of
this
frustration
has
gotten
through
to
washington
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
yesterday
said
that
there
will
be
a
handful
of
countries
that
come
to
the
united
states
and
ask
for
relief
from
that
we
ll
consider
pompeo
did
not
name
any
countries
but
the
statement
is
significant
enough
perhaps
washington
is
ready
to
accept
something
milder
than
an
export
reduction
to
zero
to
maintain
its
relationships
with
key
asian
allies
or
maybe
it
has
become
evident
even
for
the
trump
administration
that
the
insistence
on
an
oil
export
reduction
to
zero
has
only
served
to
stoke
the
oil
price
rally
at
a
time
when
republicans
are
preparing
for
midterm
elections
in
november
and
prices
at
the
pump
are
