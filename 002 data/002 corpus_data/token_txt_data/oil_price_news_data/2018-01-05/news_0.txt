europe becomes victim of russiaâ€™s newest oil strategy
higher
shipments
of
russian
crude
oil
to
china
may
saddle
european
importers
with
a
fatter
bill
an
industry
consultancy
warned
at
the
end
of
last
year
noting
the
latest
stage
of
russia
s
eastern
pivot
the
launch
of
the
expanded
east
ocean
pipeline
that
would
lift
urals
crude
supply
to
china
twofold
to
million
tons
annually
fge
said
in
a
note
quoted
by
bloomberg
that
russia
will
start
moving
more
urals
eastward
right
after
the
launch
of
the
pipeline
extension
at
a
rate
of
bpd
the
overall
increase
of
russian
crude
shipments
to
china
according
to
the
consultancy
could
be
around
bpd
this
means
less
oil
for
europe
which
is
russia
s
oil
client
this
only
highlights
the
significance
of
moscow
s
asian
pivot
amid
lingering
european
sanctions
following
the
annexation
of
crimea
and
russia
s
involvement
in
separatist
conflicts
in
the
ukraine
in
russia
exported
an
average
million
barrels
daily
to
european
countries
compared
with
less
than
a
million
bpd
to
china
according
to
figures
from
the
energy
information
administration
eia
in
percentage
figures
europe
accounted
for
percent
of
russia
s
crude
oil
exports
while
the
share
of
china
was
just
percent
yet
this
is
changing
fast

the
rise
in
chinese
exports
has
been
quite
steep
since
as
of
november
last
year
russia
shipped
million
barrels
of
oil
daily
to
china
all
the
latest
signs
point
to
further
growth
however
exactly
how
much
this
would
hurt
european
buyers
is
unclear

is
currently
trading
at
a

russia
s
diverting
of
crude
oil
from
europe
to
china
could
be
an
opportunity
for
exporters
as
long
as
they
can
keep
their
transport
costs
low
enough
europe
will
probably
be
grateful
for
the
diversification
over
the
long
term
things
are
even
more
uncertain
clearly
russia
has
prioritized
its
relationship
with
china
in
addition
to
the
espo
expansion
gazprom
is
on
track
to
complete
the
power
of
siberia
gas
pipeline
by
the
mammoth
of
a
pipeline
will
pump
trillion
cu
ft
of
gas
to
china
annually
the
country
is
already
the
consumer
of
natural
gas
in
the
world
behind
the
and
russia
and
is
expected
to
show
the
strongest
demand
growth
over
the
coming
it
to
second
place
by
as
the
economy
shifts
away
from
coal
this
soaring
demand
has
already
created
shortages
in
parts
of
the
country
a
recent
report
by
eurasia
daily
suggested
the
power
of
siberia
will
be
essential
in
avoiding
future
gas
shortages
would
that
take
gas
away
from
europe
it
s
unlikely
given
gazprom
s
market
share
in
europe
and
besides
there
s
enough
gas
for
everyone
what
might
happen
is
china
overtaking
europe
as
russia
s
biggest
gas
export
market
at
some
point
in
the
future
especially
if
relations
continue
to
be
strained
