spare capacity: the biggest mystery in oil markets
with
around
million
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
supply
targeted
by
the
trump
administration
how
will
the
oil
market
cope
with
the
losses
is
there
enough
supply
capacity
to
make
up
for
the
shortfall
there
is
a
great
deal
of
debate
about
the
true
extent
of
the
world
s
spare
capacity
or
more
precisely
there
are
a
range
of
guesses
over
how
much
surplus
is
located
in
saudi
arabia
the
one
country
that
really
has
the
ability
to
ramp
up
large
volumes
of
supply
on
short
arabia
claims
it
could
produce
if
it
really
needed
to
however
that
claim
has
not
been
put
to
the
test
saudi
arabia
s
highest
level
of
production
was
just
over
in
just
before
it
helped
engineer
the
production
around
of
extra
supply
as
president
trump
demands
is
a
tall
order
more
recent
history
shows
saudi
has
never
produced
more
than
on
average
over
a
single
month
and
even
in
the
recent
period
we
have
observed
a
steep
decline
in
domestic
saudi
oil
inventories
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
wrote
in
a
note
arguing
that
there
is
plenty
of
reason
to
question
the
notion
that
saudi
arabia
has
around
of
idled
capacity
thus
it
appears
the
oil
market
has
little
confidence
that
iran
volumes
can
be
easily
the
international
energy
agency
estimates
that
there
is
around
of
total
global
spare
capacity
that
can
truly
be
ramped
up
in
a
short
period
of
time
a
looser
definition
of
spare
capacity
that
encompasses
the
ability
to
add
supply
over
several
months
puts
the
figure
at
about
percent
of
which
is
located
in
saudi
arabia
smaller
additions
come
from
the
uae
kuwait
iraq
and
problem
is
that
saudi
arabia
is
already
ramping
up
output
to
replace
lost
barrels
elsewhere
saudi
arabia
added
bpd
in
june
compared
to
a
month
earlier
putting
output
at
but
that
increase
only
offset
losses
in
libya
angola
and
venezuela
in
other
words
saudi
arabia
had
of
spare
capacity
at
the
start
of
june
proceeded
to
burn
through
but
because
of
the
losses
elsewhere
the
oil
market
saw
no
net
increase
in
supply
related
asia
is
leading
the
renewable
energy
racenews
reports
suggest
the
production
increases
will
continue
in
july
perhaps
to
as
high
as
that
leaves
roughly
of
remaining
spare
capacity
but
again
ongoing
losses
in
libya
and
venezuela
could
eat
up
the
means
that
saudi
arabia
could
use
up
of
the
spare
capacity
that
it
had
without
the
market
really
feeling
the
extra
supply
and
that
is
before
we
get
to
the
potential
outages
in
iran
if
all
of
the
of
iranian
exports
are
shut
in
it
would
theoretically
add
to
the
price
of
oil
according
to
bank
of
america
merrill
an
extremely
problematic
scenario
it
could
be
the
case
that
saudi
arabia
does
not
have
the
of
extra
supply
that
it
says
it
does
or
perhaps
that
capacity
is
not
immediately
available
some
analysts
have
argued
that
it
would
require
additional
drilling
to
push
output
as
high
as
and
it
could
only
take
place
over
many
months
ultimately
that
would
mean
saudi
arabia
would
be
unable
to
plug
the
hole
leftover
by
iran
and
oil
prices
would
likely
everyone
is
that
pessimistic
however
barclays
argues
that
global
spare
capacity
could
actually
be
about
to
higher
than
is
commonly
thought
the
investment
bank
acknowledged
that
the
deteriorating
situation
in
libya
combined
with
the
potential
catastrophic
losses
in
iran
puts
the
oil
market
in
a
bind
however
these
eventualities
are
not
completely
certain
in
the
meantime
we
believe
that
the
market
is
less
focused
on
some
of
the
weakening
demand
indicators
and
stronger
supplies
that
are
signaling
a
softer
market
balance
thus
we
maintain
our
bearish
view
in
the
short
term
the
investment
bank
wrote
in
a
note
barclays
estimates
an
average
brent
price
of
just
per
barrel
in
the
second
half
of
and
in
related
the
critical
chokepoint
that
could
send
oil
to
crucial
difference
between
a
lot
of
bullish
forecasts
and
the
one
that
barclays
envisions
is
that
barclays
believes
the
oil
market
will
remain
in
a
net
surplus
the
bank
conceded
that
severe
outages
in
iran
would
blow
up
that
scenario
but
argued
that
the
us
government
will
quickly
find
it
politically
unpalatable
in
an
election
year
to
quickly
reduce
to
zero
iranian
exports
to
india
and
plus
the
bank
says
after
factoring
in
from
the
idled
neutral
zone
on
the
border
which
could
restart
next
year
in
addition
to
some
other
surplus
capacity
in
the
uae
russia
and
saudi
arabia
total
global
spare
capacity
could
be
higher
than
the
eia
has
top
it
off
government
inventories
could
be
drawn
down
barclays
says
that
in
theory
governments
could
add
a
whopping
of
supply
onto
the
market
for
a
period
of
days
which
would
only
use
up
about
half
of
the
overall
stockpiles
they
are
sitting
on
obviously
that
is
an
unlikely
scenario
but
the
investment
bank
says
it
illustrates
the
quantity
of
oil
that
could
be
called
upon
in
a
is
somewhat
of
an
outlier
in
its
restrained
price
forecast
needless
to
say
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
disagreement
over
the
true
extent
of
saudi
spare
capacity
but
we
may
finally
gain
some
insight
into
saudi
arabia
s
maximum
capabilities
if
iran
really
starts
to
see
supplies
shut
