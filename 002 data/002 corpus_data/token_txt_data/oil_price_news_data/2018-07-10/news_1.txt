a storm is brewing for u.s. oil exports
two
geopolitical
developments
in
recent
sanctions
on
iran
and
the
escalating
trade
set
to
reshuffle
the
oil
flows
to
the
world
s
oil
market
the
one
hand
the
united
states
is
pressing
iran
s
oil
customers
to
cut
their
iranian
crude
imports
by
as
much
as
possible
china
is
tehran
s
biggest
oil
buyer
and
india
is
its
second
while
india
is
reportedly
preparing
for
a
drastic
reduction
of
iranian
oil
imports
china
will
continue
to
buy
iranian
the
other
hand
china
is
threatening
to
impose
a
tariff
on
crude
oil
and
oil
products
after
the
trade
war
took
a
turn
for
the
worse
in
recent
weeks
such
a
tariff
would
make
american
crude
oil
uncompetitive
in
china
and
oil
sellers
will
have
to
find
alternative
buyers
for
their
crude
to
replace
the
volumes
they
are
currently
selling
to
their
oil
customer
after
is
an
obvious
imports
and
demand
are
surging
and
it
may
be
willing
to
replace
at
least
part
of
its
iranian
oil
imports
out
of
fear
that
its
companies
and
the
sovereign
could
lose
access
to
the
financial
system
should
it
continue
to
buy
iran
s
the
problem
with
india
possibly
replacing
iranian
oil
with
crude
is
that
american
light
oil
isn
t
a
substitute
for
heavy
iranian
began
regular
imports
last
year
but
the
volumes
are
currently
small
especially
compared
to
the
crude
exports
to
china
eia
data
shows
but
in
may
india
s
imports
of
crude
oil
jumped
by
nine
times
the
april
that
at
least
a
partial
switch
is
already
underway

asia
is
leading
the
renewable
energy
race
shale
crude
is
not
an
alternative
to
iranian
crude
sandy
fielden
director
of
research
for
commodities
and
energy
at
morningstar
told
bloomberg
indian
refiners
can
t
absorb
all
the
oil
that
was
going
to
china
they
can
import
more
but
can
they
process
it
if
china
follows
through
with
its
threat
to
slap
tariffs
on
oil
imports
it
would
put
downward
pressure
on
the
wti
crude
benchmark
and
widen
its
discount
to
brent
crude
which
could
be
make
oil
even
more
attractive
to
indian
buyers
according
to
analysts
doubt
that
the
united
states
will
be
able
to
easily
find
alternative
buyers
for
the
oil
it
has
been
selling
to
may
raise
its
oil
imports
but
it
would
hardly
be
able
to
replace
all
the
american
oil
that
a
chinese
tariff
could
possibly
cut
while
china
could
secure
the
crude
from
alternative
sources
such
as
west
africa
which
has
a
similar
quality
to
crude
the
would
find
it
hard
to
find
an
alternative
market
that
is
as
big
as
china
