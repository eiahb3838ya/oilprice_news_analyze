although
after
monday
s

turmoil
the

administration
has
backed
off
that
approach
after

voiced
fears

in

have
been
rattled
by

the

from

china
keeps

so
the

doesn

fluctuate
much

it
has
declined
percent
over

analysts
speculate
that
china
might
be
allowing
the

it
comes
under

a
strategy
that
will
help
keep
exports
competitive
amid

as
well
as

but
it
raises
concerns
about
capital
flight
and
a

which
could
