is the shale slowdown overblown?
the
shale
industry
has
hit
a
bit
of
a
rough
patch
with
pipeline
bottlenecks
cost
inflation
and
a
crowded
field
contributing
to
a
drilling
and
production
slowdown
but
many
in
the
industry
are
confident
that
the
lull
will
be
are
several
strategies
that
shale
companies
are
starting
to
pursue
such
as
pivoting
to
other
shale
plays
curtailing
drilling
activity
or
drilling
wells
but
deferring
completions
according
to
halliburton
s
ceo
jeff
miller
as
reported
by
argus
media
these
strategies
are
actually
relieving
a
bit
of
pressure
on
the
permian
basin
and
the
cost
inflation
that
has
come
with
the
concentration
of
drilling
and
the
associated
the
permian
runs
into
trouble
shale
companies
are
pivoting
to
the
eagle
ford
the
bakken
the
niobrara
and
even
wyoming

powder
river
basin
according
to
comments
from
executives
at
a
recent
conference
hosted
by
barclays
in
fact
a
flurry
of
research
reports
from
top
investment
banks
recently
also
back
up
the
notion
that
the
shale
industry
will
continue
to
press
forward
despite
significant
headwinds
in
june
the
latest
month
for
which
solid
production
data
is
available
the
eia
said
that
output
rose
by
bpd
and
about
bpd
of
that
total
came
from
texas
evidence
that
the
permian
has
not
been
suffering
from
a
slowdown
at
least
as
of
sachs
says
that
the
growth
will
continue
and
the
bank
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
shale
industry
has
increased
spending
over
the
course
of
this
year

with

increasing
budgets

there
could
be

estimate

analysts
wrote
in

earlier
this

the
impact
of
these
capex
increases
plus
permian

be

merrill
lynch
says
that
aside
from
spending
increases
improvements
in
drilling
mean
that
shale
companies
can
continue
to
grow
production
while
spending
less
since
drilling
times
have
fallen
by
roughly
in
most
of
the
major
oil

basins
resulting
in
fewer

last

laterals

frac
stages
have
increased
and
the
amount
of
sand
has
also
the
same
time
because
there
have
been
bottlenecks
for
things
like
water
disposal
and
frac
sand
which
has
been
shipped

from
wisconsin
and

new
water

and
frac
sand
mines
have
opened
in
texas
another
way
that
the
industry
has
kept
costs
down
these
factors
combined
have
significantly
improved
capital
efficiency
and
have
allowed
producers
to
grow
output
at
a
similar
pace
to
while
spending
roughly
less

efficiency
gains
have
been
important
those
factors
arguably
pale
in
comparison
to
the
increase
in
the
price
of
oil
without
diminishing
the
significance
of
efficiency
gains
we
emphasize
that
a
higher

always

the
consultancy
argued
that
most
shale
companies
have
based
their
budgets
and
capex
plans
on
a
conservative
oil
price
of
per
barrel
so
the
gains
this
year
have
led
to
cash
as
for
the
pipeline
bottlenecks
the
shale
industry
expects
to
ride
out
the
storm
expecting
new
pipelines
to
come
online
in
a
little

millennials

millions

texas
oilall
told
many
see
the
bottlenecks
as
a
concern
that
could
slow
production
growth
but
ultimately
shale
executives
are
confident
that
new
pipelines
will
ease
the
burden
by
late
or
early
also
many
think
that
the
cost
inflation
hitting
the
permian
is
somewhat
tolerable
by
and
large
efficiency
and
productivity
gains
have
helped
offset
rising
service
inflation
costs
with
some
exceptions
in
the
permian
in

producers
and

companies
alike

costs
to
soften

in
a

summarizing
the
findings
from

everyone
is
on

with
this
sentiment
