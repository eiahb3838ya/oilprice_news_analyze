iran: trump’s sanctions can’t touch our oil
as
the
geopolitical
drama
between
not
only
iran
and
the
but
between
the
and
its
eu
allies
unfolds
over
trump
s
decision
to
pull
out
of
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
iran
is
vowing
that
sanctions
can
t
touch
its
oil
exports
of
course
there
is
one
caveat
in
that
claim
and
that
is
based
on
possible
eu
refusal
to
adhere
to
stipulations
over
renewed
iranian
sanctions
tehran
s
oil
exports
to
remain
unchanged
if
the
iran
nuclear
deal
is
salvaged
by
the
eu

that
every
new
decision
in
the
organization
of
the

countries
opec
needs
unanimity
and
added
i
believe
that
if
the
european
union
helps
us
the
level
of
our
oil
exports
will
not
change
it
s
a
bold
statement
even
considering
the
geopolitical
and
economic
heft
that
eu
members
can
bring
to
the
table
over
a
collective
refusal

friday
the
eu
took
its
pivot
away
from
a
step
higher
when
it
announced
a
series
of
steps
to
counter
sanctions
over
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
including
enabling
member
states
to
make
direct
payments
for
oil
to
iran
s
central
bank
as
well
as
the
revival
of
a
blocking
statute
that
allows
eu
firms
to
ignore
sanctions
without
fear
of
reprisal
from

however
with
the
eu
s
renewed
sense
of
itself
is
that
it
likely
won
t
work
for
starters
the
bottom
line
in
any
new
tensions
with
washington
forces
both
the
eu
as
a
collective
body
and
each

may
be
hard
to
conceive
eu

trying
to

french

that
failed
in
his
charm

during
his
recent
washington
visit
to
dissuade
trump
from
pulling
out
of
the
iranian
nuclear
accord
has
stated
that
he
doesn
t
want
a

with
the
over

that

possibly
change

monday
newly
appointed
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
actually
ratcheted
the
intensity
of
the
ongoing
rhethrotic
up
another
notch
he
threatened
to
impose
the
strongest
sanctions
in
history
ever
on
trump
s
former
director
of
the
cia
demanded
major
changes
from
iran
and
said
america
will
not
allow
the
country
to
develop
a
nuclear
weapon
not
now
not
ever
this
is
just
the
beginning
the
sting
of
sanctions
will
be
painful
pompeo
said
these
will
be
the
strongest
sanctions
in
history
when
complete
pompeo
also
said
that
tehran
must
stop
developing
ballistic
missiles
release
americans
who
are
being
held
in
prisons
in
the
country
and
stop
support
of
militant
and
terrorist
groups
in
the
middle
east
and
beyond
he
also
called
for
a
ban
on
a
reactor
which
is
the
most
basic
way
to
develop

iran
will
never
again
have
carte
blanche
to
dominate
the
middle
east
he
s
pompeo
s
remarks
leave
little
doubt
that
the
trump
administration
has
iran
s
nuclear
ambitions
and
its
growing
influence
in
the
middle
east
including
the
ongoing
syrian
civil
war
in
its
cross
hairs
the
impact
at
least
in
the
short
to
on
oil
markets
will
be
predict
that
around
barrels
of
oil
per
day
or
higher
could
be
removed
from
the
market
though
marginal
amounts
of
reduced
supply
can
weigh
heavily
when
markets
are
nearing
an
undersupply
scenario
these
barrels
can
be
made
up
at
least
in
part
by
saudi
arabia
who
has
indicated
it
would
step
in
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
iranian

iran
s
hope
that
the

can
