ev revolution could wipe out $21 trillion in oil revenue
hardly
a
day
goes
by
without
a
research
company
releasing
yet
another
report
forecasting
the
future
of
electric
vehicles
and
all
related
industries
oil
included
some
of
these
are
skeptical
but
most
predict
a
bright
future
for
electric
cars
the
latest
is
no
exception
a
company
aurora
energy
research
has
projected
that
the
adoption
of
electric
cars
could
wipe
out
as
much
as
us
trillion
in
revenues
for
the
oil
gas
and
coal
industry
by
oil
aurora
energy
research
predicts
that
revenues
could
fall
from
us
trillion
in
to
us
trillion
in
on
the
back
of
fast
ev
adoption
combined
with
major
improvements
in
energy
efficiencies
meanwhile
oil
prices
could
plummet
to
as
little
as
us
a
is
what
could
happen
under
a
burnout
scenario
developed
by
the
research
firm
that
envisages
fast
growth
in
ev
adoption
and
equally
fast
growth
in
electricity
demand
on
the
back
of
digital
tech
use
driven
by
the
expansion
of
the
internet
of
this
scenario
that
might
as
well
be
called
doomsday
as
far
as
it
concerns
the
oil
industry
aurora
research
sees
the
number
of
evs
on
the
roads
in
at
million
for
context
another
research
from
saw
the
total
number
of
cars
on
the
road
in
that
year
at
billion
so
evs
would
be
a
pretty
solid
portion
of
the
a
result
of
the
advent
of
evs
crude
oil
demand
will
peak
long
before
in
the
by
oil
prices
will
have
fallen
to
us
coal
will
be
doing
even
worse
with
a
ton
selling
for
just
us
thanks
to
the
increased
use
of
power
generation
capacity
replacing
coal
power
news
for
oil
and
coal
under
this
scenario
is
certainly
bad
not
so
for
gas
gas
will
be
the
big
winner
under
the
burnout
scenario
of
aurora
energy
research
with
revenues
there
rising
twofold
by
with
both
supply
and
prices
rising
as
gas
takes
territory
freed
by
coal
and
oil
related
opec
could
relax
production
cutsall
in
all
the
research
does
not
really
tell
us
anything
new
except
some
numbers
that
sound
impressive
if
you
forget
that
a
burnout
scenario
is
not
necessarily
the
most
likely
one
there
have
been
many
upbeat
reports
on
evs
but
the
revolution
they
have
touted
as
happening
has
actually
shaped
up
to
be
more
of
an
evolution
with
adoption
not
as
fast
as
many
of
these
forecasts
it
is
true
that
ev
sales
are
increasing
thanks
to
falling
costs
mainly
in
batteries
this
year
total
electric
car
sales
are
seen
by
bloomberg
new
energy
finance
at
million
which
may
not
be
a
whole
lot
but
it
is
up
considerably
from
the
several
hundred
thousand
evs
sold
four
years
ago
if
this
exponential
growth
continues
we
might
just
see
some
of
the
optimistic
forecasts
materialize
although
aurora
energy
research
s
prediction
of
evs
making
up
a
quarter
of
the
global
car
fleet
might
be
a
bit
of
a
oil
industry
no
doubt
reads
all
these
forecasts
it
s
no
coincidence
that
shell
and
bp
are
expanding
into
ev
charging
and
battery
technology
even
if
the
forecasts
are
too
upbeat
it
pays
to
be
prepared
for
a
greener
future
that
according
to
aurora
research
will
come
not
so
much
as
a
result
of
official
policies
as
of
the
advance
of
digital
tech
and
what
the
firm
calls
consumer
