the u.s. oil production “mirage”
some
of
the
surge
in
oil
production
this
past
spring
might
have
been
a
on
july
the
eia
released
monthly
data
on
oil
production
which
revealed
a
decline
in
output
of
bpd
in
may
compared
to
a
month
earlier
the
dip
is
a
surprise
given
the
widespread
assumption
that
shale
production
was
continuing
to
grow
at
a
blistering
be
sure
a
big
reason
for
the
decline
in
overall
output
was
the
decline
in
production
from
offshore
gulf
of
mexico
but
texas
production
only
rose
by
bpd
a
disappointing
figure
that
likely
came
in
far
below
what
most
analysts
had
the
monthly
total
of
million
barrels
per
day
for
may
is
sharply
lower
than
what
eia
itself
thought
at
the
time
here
are
the
weekly
estimates
for
oil
production
that
the
eia
put
out
back
then
april
the
weekly
estimates
tend
to
be
less
accurate
than
the
retrospective
monthly
numbers
that
is
not
a
new
dynamic
and
estimating
on
a
weekly
basis
inherently
involves
a
lot
of
guesswork
so
this
is
not
a
knock
on
the
the
discrepancy
is
rather
striking
not
only
did
the
eia
estimate
that
production
in
april
and
may
was
much
higher
than
it
actually
was
but
the
agency
also
thought
production
was
rising
the
weekly
estimates
were
to
be
believed
at
the
time
production
would
have
climbed
from
in
early
april
to
by
the
end
of
may
an
increase
of
bpd
over
a
roughly
only
was
production
lower
than
that
but
it
didn
t
actually
increase
at
all
the
eia
s
more
accurate
monthly
figures
show
a
slight
decline
in
output
falling
from
in
april
to
just
in
weekly
data
had
shown
a
strong
output
rise
from
march
to
may
the
revised
data
shows
that
this
rise
was
a
mirage
output
actually
fell
over
the
period

a
note
related
oil
production
isn
t
growing
as
fast
as
expectedthis
is
a
rather
significant
development
and
it
has
implications
for
more
recent
data
releases
it
is
time
to
deal
with
the
statistical
gorilla
on
the
oil
trading
floor
horsnell
of
standard
chartered
wrote
along
with
analyst
emily
ashford
we
think
us
crude
oil
production
has
not
reached
the
million
barrels
per
day
shown
in
recent
weeks
in
the
energy
information
administration
eia
weekly
data
and
that
it
is
significantly
below
with
growth
that
is
a
reasonable
conclusion
given
the
roughly
difference
between
the
two
surveys
for
may
the
eia
has
since
switched
its
reporting
for
the
weekly
surveys
by
rounding
off
to
the
nearest
bpd
but
data
points
from
the
last
few
weeks
look
like
this
july
related
exxon
s
shocking
supply
and
demand
predictionsit
s
a
little
tricky
trying
to
discern
patterns
from
that
data
given
the
rounding
off
but
a
few
things
jump
out
first
production
dipped
at
the
end
of
july
a
rather
surprising
move
output
from
alaska
fell
bpd
over
the
last
two
weeks
which
likely
explains
much
of
the
move
however
production
from
the
lower
has
only
increased
bpd
since
the
week
of
june
which
suggests
that
the
permian
basin
is
starting
to
run
into
production
constraints
because
of
pipeline
is
a
little
early
to
really
get
a
sense
of
how
much
the
permian
is
slowing
down
most
analysts
have
been
assuming
an
overall
slowdown
over
the
next
months
because
of
pipeline
constraints
however
the
eia
figures
might
suggest
that
the
problem
has
already
started
to
bite
in
april
the
eia
predicted
in
its
drilling
productivity
report
that
permian
production
would
jump
by
bpd
in
may
but
the
monthly
data
just
released
finds
only
modest
gains
in
texas
bpd
and
new
mexico
bpd
the
eia
thinks
output
broke
in
july
an
high
but
judging
by
the
monthly
data
from
april
and
may
perhaps
the
agency
is
also
overstating
july
figures
which
raises
the
possibility
that
production
is
not
nearly
as
high
as
we
currently
the
coming
months
if
monthly
production
figures
continue
to
show
output
undershooting
expectations
that
would
have
global
ramifications
most
analysts
still
are
baking
in
strong
shale
growth
figures
into
their
forecasts
if
that
additional
output
fails
to
materialize
the
oil
market
could
end
up
being
a
lot
tighter
than
we
all
expected
