iran prepares for oil production decline
iran
expects
disruption
in
its
oil
industry
after
the
reintroduction
of
sanctions
that
would
make
it
hard
to
stick
to
its
current
production
goals
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
over
the
weekend
when
he
met
with
eu
s
climate
action
and
energy
commissioner
miguel
arias
state
news
agency
shana
quoted
zanganeh
as
saying
achieving
its
stated
daily
production
target
of
million
barrels
of
crude
would
be
difficult
but
we
would
not
put
that
aside
it
might
take
more
time
but
we
will
not
do
away
with
iran
would
probably
rely
mostly
on
its
two
biggest
buyers
china
and
india
to
boost
its
production
closer
to
this
target
but
it
would
also
need
the
help
of
the
european
union
which
is
also
a
big
buyer
of
iranian
crude
i
believe
if
the
eu
helps
us
and
honors
its
statements
the
level
of
iran
oil
exports
will
remain
intact
and
this
would
not
be
a
reason
for
changing
a
decision
made
in
the
past
zanganeh
and
india
as
well
as
the
eu
have
clearly
indicated
they
had
no
intention
of
changing
their
buying
habits
regarding
iranian
crude
with
the
eu
specifically
signaling
it
would
make
an
effort
to
uphold
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
shield

part
of
eu
s
efforts
to
continue
doing
business
with
iran
the
european
commission
said
last
week
in
a
statement
that
the
commission
is
encouraging
member
states
to
explore
the
possibility
of
bank
transfers
to
the
central
bank
of
iran
this
approach
could
help
the
iranian
authorities
to
receive
their
revenues
particularly
in
case
of
sanctions
which
could
target
