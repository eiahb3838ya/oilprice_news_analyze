global outages boost oil prices
oil
prices
are
on
track
for
strong
gains
this
week
and
the
price
increases
are
not
only
the
result
of
the
crisis
in
oil
market
received
a
boost
from
the
federal
reserve
this
week
which
signaled
on
wednesday
that
it
would
essentially
suspend
its
plans
to
hike
interest
rates
this
year
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
said
that
economic
growth
remained
solid
but
that
the
central
bank
had
the
luxury
of
patience
when
deciding
on
further
rate
hikes
that
is
a
big
change
from
prior
guidance
in
which
the
fed
very
clearly
outlined
multiple
rate
increases
in
the
case
for
raising
rates
has
weakened
somewhat
powell
said
slowing
growth
in
china
and
europe
a
weakening
housing
market
tepid
inflation
these
are
not
exactly
the
ingredients
that
call
for
aggressive
rate
announcement
contributed
to
strong
gains
for
oil
prices
on
wednesday
and
thursday
at
the
time
of

wti
was
trading
in
the
with
brent
above
per
barrel
both
close
to
more
dovish
position
from
the
fed
boosts
the
bullish
case
for
oil
in
two
ways
first
interest
rates
will
provide
a
jolt
to
the
economy
stock
markets
rose
on
the
news
but
second
a
softer
rate
outlook
also
undercuts
the
dollar
a
bit
a
weaker
dollar
stokes
crude
oil
demand
in
the
rest
of
the
world
and
historically
the
dollar
has
had
an
inverse
relationship
with
oil
the
oil
market
received
a
more
direct
boost
this
week
on
news
that
saudi
arabia
slashed
shipments
to
the
united
states
the
has
the
most
transparent
and
data
on
the
oil
market
which
include
weekly
releases
on
production
levels
imports
and
exports
and
inventories
that
kind
of
visibility
is
not
readily
available
in
most
places
around
the
world
related
did
russia
make
a
secret
nuclear
energy
deal
with
north
korea
as
a
result
saudi
arabia
appears
to
be
deliberately
targeting
that
data
by
reducing
shipments
to
the
specifically
riyadh
can
help
create
the
appearance
of
a
tightening
oil
market
saudi
shipments
to
the
dropped
by
bpd
last
week
to
just
bpd
the
lowest
weekly
total
in
more
than
two
to
the
point
opec
s
production
declined
by
bpd
in
january
according
to
a
reuters
survey
the
largest
monthly
decline
since
early
the
month
that
the
first
round
of
production
cuts
took
effect
iraq
produced
above
its
production
ceiling
but
aside
from
that
the
cartel
is
well
on
its
way
to
implementing
the
production
fact
there
is
suddenly
a
remarkable
confluence
of
events
pushing
oil
in
a
bullish
direction
first
and
foremost
are
the
production
cuts
of
that
are
phasing
in
but
beyond
that
shale
is
starting
to
slowdown
and
while
output
is
still
expected
to
grow
this
year
the
increase
could
be
the
smallest
in
there
are
the
supply
outages
libya
lost
some
output
unexpectedly
in
december
with
some
of
its
production
still
offline
iran
sanctions
waivers
are
set
to
expire
in
may
and
the
hopes
to
further
cut
into
iranian
oil
exports
the
new
sanctions
on
venezuela
threaten
to
create
yet
another
major
source
of
supply
outages
related
eu
still
aims
to
circumvent
sanctions
on
iranin
fact
when
considering
that
is
determined
to
keep
of
supply
off
of
the
market
and
painful
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
iran
threaten
to
shut
in
even
more
output
it
s
pretty
amazing
that
brent
crude
is
only
trading
at
per
barrel
the
fed
backing
off
interest
rate
hikes
is
the
cherry
on
and
investors
are
starting
to
wake
up
to
this
bullish
sentiment
the
market
is
more
convinced
that
there
will
be
aggressive
production
cuts
and
the
macro
picture
has
improved
a
bit
that
s
positive
for
prices
going
forward

the
wall
street
investor
echoed
that
sentiment
in
comments
to
the
wsj
the
saudis
are
sincere
about
higher
oil
prices
they
need
to
balance
their
budget
the
opec
cuts
will
lower
stocks
so
i
m
pretty
bullish
said
mark
gordon
portfolio
manager
at
the
ascent
oil
prices
are
back
up
to
where
they
were
in
november
and
significant
outages
from
venezuela
in
the
short
run
could
pave
the
way
for
more
