nafta rift could be a boon for canadian oil
looming
trade
wars
have
made
frequent
headlines
since
the
election
of
president
donald
trump
his
view
on
the
position
in
global
trade
is
that
for
too
long
the
country
has
been
the
piggy
bank
of
the
this
has
put
some
strain
on
relations
with
trading
partners
trump
s
belligerent
language
and
willingness
to
make
use
of
the
disproportionate
influence
in
global
economics
through
its
financial
and
monetary
system
has
upset
markets
and
partners
one
area
of
attention
is
nafta
although
partners
canada
and
mexico
have
been
startled
by
the
change
of
attitude
of
the
towards
the
trade
agreement
the
negotiations
could
also
provide
an
china
is
the
largest
trading
partner
of
the
when
measured
in
value
the
total
economic
activity
between
nafta
s
members
is
far
greater
trade
between
canada
and
the
reached
a
total
of
billion
in
with
a
small
surplus
of
billion
for
the
regardless
of
these
numbers
an
unprecedented
clash
occurred
between
the
partners
during
and
after
the
summit
of
and
june
concerning
the
planned
tariffs
on
canadian
by
president
trump
s
strong
language
canada
mexico
and
the
have
been
renegotiating
nafta
in
the
case
of
canada
these
talks
are
an
opportunity
to
change
certain
aspects
of
the
agreement
concerning
the
crucial
hydrocarbons
sector
more
specifically
the
preferential
access
of
the
to
the
energy
resources
of
its
northern
neighbour
which
is
a
major
impediment
for
canadian
policy
and
energy
security
canadian
export
faces
strategic
restrictions
as
the
overwhelming
amount
of
oil
is
produced
in
landlocked
alberta
the
absence
of
sufficient
infrastructure
to
either
the
east
or
west
coast
and
existing
pipelines
to
the
south
mean
that
the
majority
of
produced
oil
is
sent
to
the
related
opec
meeting
could
end
without
decisionaccording
to
the
proportionality
clause
article
canada
has
to
reserve
a
fixed
ratio
of
its
hydrocarbons
production
for
export
to
customers
regardless
of
domestic
needs
or
federal
policy
this
effectively
gives
american
companies
considerable
control
over
canada
s
resources
under
the
deal
percent
of
all
oil
produced
and
imported
and
percent
of
gas
needs
to
be
exported
to
the
means
that
even
under
exceptional
circumstances
such
as
the
boycott
of
by
arab
countries
canadian
oil
earmarked
for
export
could
not
be
diverted
for
domestic
purposes
due
to
a
lack
of
transportation
options
between
east
and
west
and
the
proportionality
clause
most
of
the
oil
in
eastern
canada
is
imported
in
around
barrels
a
day
came
from
several
sources
costing
around
billion
per
year
related
the
permian
faces
shut
ins
due
to
oil
pipeline
shortagethe
currently
is
the
destination
for
percent
of
canada
s
oil
exports
this
gives
washington
and
american
producers
a
major
strategic
advantage
as
producers
do
not
have
many
options
the
price
of
west
canadian
select
usually
trades
for
to
dollars
a
barrel
less
than
the
new
york
traded
west
texas
intermediary
due
to
quality
differences
and
transportation
costs
earlier
this
year
that
had
risen
to
a
barrel
but
the
difference
has
somewhat
decrease
need
for
additional
markets
has
increased
due
to
two
reasons
first
the
shale
revolution
has
dramatically
increased
the
production
of
oil
in
the
which
hit
million
bpd
in
april
next
to
that
canadian
oil
production
is
expected
to
rise
with
an
additional
million
bpd
from
currently
to
million
bpd
in
a
combination
of
decreasing
demand
rising
production
and
increased
domestic
output
requires
additional
destination
politicians
and
other
stakeholders
have
been
lobbying
to
revitalize
the
energy
east
pipeline
that
would
transport
oil
from
alberta
to
the
eastern
shores
of
canada
it
would
greatly
reduce
the
dependency
on
the
international
markets
and
increase
the
share
of
domestic
consumption
obviously
the
latter
has
consequences
for
the
preferential
access
of
companies
to
canadian
oil
as
the
share
of
export
to
the
south
would
the
west
as
early
as
houston
based
kinder
morgan
started
with
the
planning
and
construction
of
a
second
part
of
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
to
triple
capacity
from
alberta
to
the
shores
of
british
columbia
for
transpacific
export
however
the
decentralized
political
system
british
colombia
s
strong
disapproval
of
the
construction
of
the
pipeline
and
the
uncertain
regulatory
environment
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
company
and
the
temporary
nationalization
of
the
the
government
of
justin
trudeau
has
received
a
lot
of
criticism
for
bailing
out
the
company
and
its
unfinished
multibillion
dollar
project
the
pipeline
could
significantly
improve
canada
s
position
on
the
negotiating
table
by
providing
producers
alternative
options
and
markets
at
least
in
part
negative
developments
for
the
canadian
energy
sector
can
be
mitigated
by
supplementing
supply
and
demand
of
different
regions
furthermore
extra
capacity
is
a
bargaining
chip
in
the
hand
of
canada
s
negotiators
the
as
the
proportionality
clause
is
a
serious
impediment
