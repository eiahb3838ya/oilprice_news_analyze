libyan oil recovers, exceeds 1 million bpd
libya
s
crude
oil
production
has
exceeded
million
bpd
for
the
first
time
since
june
when
port
blockades
and
a
kidnapping
caused
production
outages
that
within
a
month
brought
production
to
as
little
as
p
global
platts
cites
sources
from
libya
s
oil
industry
as
saying
the
improvement
came
on
the
back
of
production
growth
at
the
country
s
largest
producing
field
sharara
last
week
sharara
pumped
bpd
but
this
has
now
grown
to
more
than
bpd

field
which
has
a
capacity
to
pump
bpd
of
crude
was
shut
down
in
june
after
a
militant
group
kidnapped
four
employees
surrounding
fields
were
also
shut
down
to
avoid
more
militants
tried
to
take
a
couple
of
the
country
s
oil
export
terminals
but
were
pushed
back
by
the
libyan
national
army
which
then
in
a
twist
decided
to
not
hand
over
control
of
the
ports
to
the
internationally
recognized
national
oil
corporation
but
to
the
entity
of
the
same
name
that
is
affiliated
with
the
eastern
libyan
the
lna
and
the
legitimate
noc
came
to
an
agreement
and
noc
resumed
control
of
the
export
ports
which
put
an
end
to
the
production
suspensions
however
the
situation
in
the
divided
country
remains
highly
volatile
politically
which
means
other
outages
are
more
a
question
of
time
than
anything
else

libya
s
status
