norwayâ€™s sovereign wealth fund posts a loss
norway
s
sovereign
wealth
fund
built
on
the
back
of
the
country
s
oil
wealth
and
the
biggest
in
the
world
reported
its
first
quarterly
loss
in
two
years
for
january
to
march
on
the
back
of
a
global
stock
selloff
that
it
had
no
means
of
avoiding
as
more
than
of
its
holdings
are
in
on
the
results
the
chief
executive
of
the
fund
yngve
slyngstad
said
the
most
important
expression
of
risk
in
the
fund
is
that
the
strategic
equity
share
is
set
to
percent
this
means
that
fluctuations
in
the
fund
s
value
are
predominantly
determined
by
the
development
in
global
stock
the
norway
government
pension
fund
global
booked
negative
returns
of
percent
for
the
first
quarter
of
the
year
or
a
loss
of
us
billion
billion
kroner
in
stocks
the
return
was
percent
but
in
unlisted
real
estate
investments
there
was
a
positive
return
of
percent
the
real
estate
holdings
of
the
fund
however
are
just
percent
so
that
positive
result
had
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
overall
performance
of
the
fund
the
rest
of
its
holdings
at
percent
are
in
other
investment
vehicles
the
norway
fund
suffered
the
effects
from
growing
unease
about
protectionist
policies
in
the
united
states
combined
with
rising
wages
and
expectations
for
more
interest
rate
hikes
stocks
comprise
percent
of
the
fund
s
stock
portfolio
and
represent
its
single
largest
market
the
largest
equity
holdings
are
in
the
tech
sector
including
microsoft
apple
and
alphabet
as
well
as
month
the
fund
warned
it
could
lose
us
billion
from
its
year
if
the
market
crashes
and
the
norwegian
krone
strengthens
our
estimate
is
much
larger
than
the
numbers
that
have
been
discussed
in
norway
on
the
spending
rule
that
a
government
can
not
use
more
than
per
cent
of
the
fund
and
what
would
be
the
game
plan
in
case
the
fund
were
reduced
in
krone
rapidly
