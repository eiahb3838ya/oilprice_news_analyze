opec: imo rules will boost oil demand by 400,000 bpd
the
entry
into
effect
of
tighter
emission
rules
for
bunkering
fuel
will
cause
a
temporary
spike
in
crude
oil
demand
as
refineries
increase
their
daily
runs
by
around
bpd
opec
said
in
its
latest
world
oil
outlook
this
will
reverse
a
global
demand
growth
decline
seen
this
year
and
in
the
cartel
year
demand
growth
is
estimated
at
million
bpd
which
will
slow
down
to
million
bpd
in
but
then
rebound
to
million
bpd
in
after
the
introduction
of
the
new
rules
that
will
cap
the
sulfur
content
of
bunker
fuel
at
percent
from
the
current
percent
this
will
dampen
demand
for
fuels
but
it
will
increase
demand
for
middle
distillates
and
diesel
and
fuel
effect
of
this
change
on
global
oil
demand
however
will
be
temporary
over
the
longer
term
until
oil
demand
will
add
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
and
the
only
contributors
to
this
trend
will
be
emerging
economies
demand
in
oecd
members
will
decline
by
percent
in
the
period
while
demand
in
eurasia
will
inch
up
by
just
percent
in
emerging
economies
however
demand
is
seen
to
expand
by
percent
thanks
to
stronger
economic
growth
and
the
expansion
of
the
middle
the
supply
side
opec
expects
producers
to
boost
supply
to
a
peak
of
million
bpd
in
as
shale
oil
production
peaks
too
after
this
a
decline
will
begin
with
supply
in
at
million
bpd
compared
with
an
estimated
million
bpd
this
supply
on
the
other
hand
will
continue
to
grow
steadily
this
year
it
is
estimated
at
million
bpd
which
is
set
to
rise
to
million
bpd
in
there
will
be
a
slight
dip
in
demand
when
shale
oil
reaches
its
peak
but
afterwards
as
supply
begins
to
decline
demand
for
the
cartel
s
oil
will
irina
