the double-edged sword of high oil prices
rising
oil
prices
were
seen
last
year
as
a
positive
result
of
growing
global
growth
and
recovery
but
a
combination
of
factors
is
turning
this
benign
view
into
a
more
sinister
the
supply
side
the
combined
efforts
of
opec
and
russia
leaky
as
the

has
been
have
managed
to
reduce
the
global
oil
surplus
in
just
months
to
bring
the
market
largely
into
balance
as
a
result
oil
prices
have
gradually
risen
during
the
period
it
s
a
trend
most
observers
have
been
sanguine
about
believing
the
s
tight
oil
producers
encouraged
by
rising
prices
will
increase
output
to
ensure
ample
supply

that

had
not
taken
account
of
president
trump

decision
to
rip
up

and
as
a
result
to
reinstate

a
move
that

revoking
