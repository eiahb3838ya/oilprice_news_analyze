is $70 oil enough for shale drillers?
wti
crude
prices
have
recently
surged
to
their
highest
level
in
three
and
a
half
above
a
barrel
in
theory
that
s
higher
than
the
average
breakeven
costs
of
all
key
shale
plays
even
wti

higher
than
the
average
breakeven
prices
as
per
the
latest
quarterly

survey
from
shale

are
not
necessarily
raking
in
huge

in

higher

for

services
some
bad
hedging
bets
capping
part
of
company
sales
at
below
market
prices
the
huge
discount
of
wti
midland
crude
to
wti
and
brent
due
to
said
bottlenecks
amid
soaring
production
and
investment
in
more
drilling
shale
producers
face
takeaway
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
which
is
widening
the
wti
midland
crude
discount
to
wti
crude
so
the
prices
at
which
producers
sell
their
oil
is
not
the
same
as
the
one
we
see
on
the
oil
price
even
as
falling
inventories
and
geopolitical
risks
put
upward
pressure
on
benchmark
crude
spot
prices
tightening
constraints
on
crude
oil
transport
are
increasingly
driving
a
wedge
between
the
brent
global
crude
benchmark
and
crude
priced
in
the
permian
basin
the
dallas
fed
said
in
its
may
energy
indicators
the
discount
between
brent
crude
and
wti
barrels
priced
in
midland
increased
from
an
average
of

the
first
half
of

an
average

in
the
second
half
congested
takeaway
capacity
from
the

has
further
widened
the
discount
in
that
spread
averaged
in
largest
monthly
spread
between
the
two
since
september
the
eia
also
flagged
the
rapidly
widening
spread
in
its
latest
energy
outlook
from
may
related
oil
exports
continue
to
break
records
as
production
grows
beyond
the
capacity
of
existing
pipeline
infrastructure
producers
must
use
more
expensive
forms
of
transportation
including
rail
and
trucks
as
a
result
wti
midland
price
spreads
widened
to
the
largest
discount
to
brent
since
the
wti
midland
differential
to
brent
settled
at
on
may
which
represents
a
widening
of
since
april
the
eia
addition
companies
have
increased
investment
in
drilling
more
in
the
permian
and
even
in
the
bakken
so
their
positive
cash
positions
have
not
boomed
in
lockstep
with
the
rallying
wti
oil
companies
are
just
not
generating
enough
cash
to
fund
all
of
their
investment
in
new
wells
james
williams
energy
economist
at

told
marketwatch

myra
but
the
cash
flows

over
time
after
you
spend
the
money
on
drilling
the
well
williams
of
the
top
oil
firms
focused
on
shale
drilling
were
still
spending
in
more
cash
than
they
were
making
according
to
an
analysis
by
the
wall
street
journal
based
on
factset
data
of
those
companies
just
five

more
cash
than
they
spent
in
according
to
the
wsj
even
if
prices
are
now
higher
than
the
average
breakevens
across
the
major
basins
cost
inflation
is
back
with
a
vengeance
and
shale
companies
expect
a
cost
jump
this
year
while
there
is
also
a
shortage
of
fracking
crews
and
truck
drivers
in
parts
of
the
some
shale
producers
have
been
booking
losses
from
hedging
after
they
hedged
part
of
their
production
at
and
a
barrel
wti
which
caps
part
of
their
gains
when
prices
rally
well
above
that
level
hedging
contracts
capped
at
or
below
are
now
a
drag
on
company
sales
instead
of
the
lifeline
they
were
during
the
oil
price
these
companies
aren
t
exposed
to
the
higher
prices
because
many
of
them
hedged
their
oil
production
at
per
barrel
matt
badiali
senior
research
analyst
at
banyan
hill
told
oil
prices
surely
help
producers
but
they
still
have
work
to
do
to
turn
the
higher
prices
assuming
they
are
sustainable
into
higher
