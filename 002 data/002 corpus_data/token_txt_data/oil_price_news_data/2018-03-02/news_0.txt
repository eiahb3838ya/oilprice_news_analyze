can russia & china rescue venezuela?
the
imposition
of
oil
sanctions
is
now
edging
closer
to
reality
such
a
move
would
act
as
the
death
knell
for
venezuela
oil
industry
pvm
oil
associates
stephen
brennock
said
in
a
note
this
week
the
note
followed
reports
about
washington
getting
more
serious
about
imposing
an
oil
embargo
on
the
south
american
nation
but
is
this
really
the
end
for
the
troubled
pdvsa
and
the
country
as
a
whole
this
is
not
the
first
time
such
warnings
are
being
made
venezuela
sends
much
of
its
oil
to
refineries
on
the
gulf
coast
but
these
shipments
have
been
falling
steadily
since
last
year
reaching
just
bpd
in
the
week
to
february
versus
bpd
a
year
earlier
the
reasons
for
the
decline
are
both
lower
production
and
worsening
quality
of
the
oil
both
caused
by
lack
of
cash
for
field
maintenance
and
the
treatment
of
the
general
opinion
among
industry
analysts
in
the
west
seems
to
be
that
if
the
white
house
finally
goes
ahead
with
broad
sanctions
against
venezuela
s
oil
the
country
is
as
good
as
dead
because
of
its
overreliance
on
the
industry
if
these
sanctions
materialize
brennock
explains
caracas
would
have
to
lower
the
price
of
its
oil
substantially
to
find
buyers
and
will
also
suffer
the
blow
of
lack
of
access
to
diluents
which
is
essential
for
making
venezuelan
heavy
crude
production
in
the
orinoco
oil
belt
responsible
for
half
of
venezuela
s
crude
oil
production
of
currently
around
million
bpd
depends
on
the
imports
of
heavy
naphtha
from
the
united
states
which
is
blended
with
the
thick
oil
to
allow
it
to
flow
through
pipelines
from
orinoco
to
venezuela
s
coasts
for
loading
onto
some
analysts
say
venezuela
could
start
importing
diluents
from
african
oil
producers
but
these
will
come
at
a
steep
price
and
caracas
is
short
of
cash
in
an
effort
to
scrounge
up
some
much
needed
cash

said
the

more

trashes

let
s
leave
cryptocurrencies
aside
from
the
majority
of
headlines
on
venezuela
one
would
be
left
with
the
very
strong
impression
that
the
country
is
already
dead
and
it
just
doesn
t
know
it
yet
there
is
at
least
one
other
country
that
has
an
interest
in
not
letting
this
happen
that
s
china
of
course
and
if
we
add
russia
to
the
ally
list
things
start
to
look
a
bit
china
and
russia
have
extended
massive
credits
to
caracas
letting
the
country
die
is
not
an
option
that
either
beijing
or
moscow
would
gladly
accept
this
means
that
they
would
more
likely
than
not
step
in
to
help
keep
it
on
its
feet
in
case
of
harsher
it
may
be
a
little
early
to
talk
about
death
knells
and
last
nails
in
the
coffin
of
the
venezuelan
economy
chances
are
that
washington
is
aware
of
the
role
that
china
and
russia
could
play
there
otherwise
they
would
have
already
gone
ahead
with
the
broad
oil
sanctions

potential
headaches
