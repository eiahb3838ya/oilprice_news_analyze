mexicoâ€™s oil crescent faces a perfect storm
most
analyses
of
the
oil
price
crash
and
its
effects
tend
to
focus
on
the
oil
industry
itself
there
are
bitter
accounts
about
how
the
price
crash
affected
the
lives
of
communities
that
were
dependent
on
oil
in
the
united
states
and
canada
but
what
happens
in
a
country
with
a
serious
crime
problem
such
as
mexico
when
oil
prices
crash
nothing
good

in
a
recent
had
been
struggling
with
declining
oil
and
gas
production
for
years
before
enrique
pena
nieto
s
government
passed
a
major
energy
sector
reform
in
the
timing
of
the
reform
was
however
the
changed
went
into
effect
in
as
prices
began
to
slide
dampening
foreign
investor
appetite
for
mexican
oil
and
gas
of
thousands
of
people
working
for
or
with
state
energy
major
pemex
were
let
go
during
the
crash
many
turned
to
crime
for
lack
of
other
options
or
simply
to
make
an
easier
life
especially
in
the
state
of
tabasco
as
of
the
state
home
to
the
first
mexican
oil
discovery
had
the
highest
unemployment
rate
in
the
country
and
was
the
only
mexican
state
where
poverty
and
extreme
poverty
have
risen
in
recent
years
in
such
an
environment
crime
is
bound
to
seems
to
be
rife
among
pemex
employees
as
many
are
victims
of
crime
some
are
instigators
or
informants
to
local
gangs
that
deal
in
stealing
fuel
from
pemex
refineries
as
well
as
equipment
and
machinery
the
company
has
said
it
has
zero
tolerance
for
criminal
activity
against
its
products
and
property
but
there
is
only
so
much
a
company
can
do
even
with
the
help
of
state
and
federal
law
enforcement
looks
like
a
perfect
storm
after
more
than
a
decade
of
aggressively
fighting
drug
cartels
the
cartels
shifted
into
other
criminal
areas
including
theft
and
extortion
across
industries
poverty
exacerbated
in
some
parts
of
the
country
after
the
oil
price
crash
gave
them
more
power
and
made
it
more
difficult
for
the
government
to
stimulate
the
foreign
investment
in
oil
some
companies
that
had
considered
entering
mexico
s
oil
industry
stargardter
says
dropped
their
plans
too
afraid
they
would
become
the
target
of
kidnapping
or
is
how
things
look
on
the
ground
in
regions
of
the
country
that
holds
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
in
conventional
fields
and
another
billion
barrels
in
shale
deposits
higher
up
however
in
the
national
hydrocarbons
commission
there
is
cause
for
this
is
aramco
s
spare
production
capacitysince
the
energy
sector
reform
went
into
effect
mexico
has
attracted
some
us
billion
in
potential
oil
and
gas
investments
which
is
more
than
deloitte
estimated
it
would
attract
back
in
of
course
these
investments
still
have
potential
but
companies
winning
exploration
rights
have
already
spent
millions
of
dollars
in
upfront
payments
for
the
drilling
including
exxon
and
shell
are
expanding
their
presence
in
mexico
and
there
are
already
new
discoveries
being
made
including
pemex
s
largest
in
years
made
in
the
company
struck
oil
in
the
ixachi
well
in
veracruz
and
has
estimated
the
reserves
of
the
field
at
billion
barrels
of
oil
there
is
concern
that
the
frontrunner
for
the
july
presidential
elections
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
will
make
it
difficult
for
foreign
energy
players
to
do
business
in
the
country
yet
the
latest
news
from
his
camp
is
encouraging
an
aide
said
this
week
obrador
could
continue
the
tendering
of
oil
fields
despite
earlier
threats
to
suspend
them
if
everything
we
find
is
alright
