analyst
aman
verma
noted
in
that
india
s
demand
growth
accounted
for
percent
of
the
global
total
at
bpd
making
asia
s
economy
second
only
to
the
united
states
and
ahead
of
china
in
terms
of
oil
demand
in
india
s
crude
oil
consumption
exceeded
million
bpd
according
to
an
opec
forecast
this
will
rise
by
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
the
period
until
the
factors
that
would
contribute
to
this
development
verma
noted
rising
car
sales
especially
in
commercial
vehicles
as
the
indian
government
pursues
an
ambitious
infrastructure
development
plan
along
with
the
rather
than
approach
to
logistics
the
latter
was
the
result
of
a
shift
made
possible
by
the
introduction
of
a
goods
and
services
tax
that
eliminated
interstate
taxes
the
analyst
explained
related
why
output
cuts
take
so
long
to
materializea
third
factor
that
will
add
to
india
s
crude
oil
demand
growth
specifically
this
year
is
the
general
elections
campaign
which
will
lead
to
more
traveling
verman
said
adding
this
will
boost
particularly
diesel
demand
during
the
first
half
of
the
bright
as
the
outlook
is
headwinds
remain
chief
among
them
the
international
crude
oil
price
volatility
last
year
benchmark
prices
led
india
s
energy
minister
to
call
on
suppliers
to
reverse
their
agreement
india
depends
on
imports
for
as
much
as
percent
of
the
oil
it
the
potential
negative
effect
of
this
factor
on
overall
demand
for
crude
oil
will
be
limited
although
higher
prices
at
the
pump
dampen
demand
for
new
car
and
hence
fuel
consumption
india
s
middle
class
is
growing
and
this
will
offset
the
negative
effect
