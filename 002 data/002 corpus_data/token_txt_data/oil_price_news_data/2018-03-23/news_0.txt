what trump's new appointment means for oil prices
president
trump
fired
his
national
security
advisor
mcmaster
on
thursday
and
replaced
him
with
a
staunch
proponent
of
war
the
appointment
significantly
raises
the
odds
of
a
clash
with
iran
and
north
korea
and
almost
certainly
will
result
in
the
withdrawal
of
the
from
the
iran
bolton
was
a
fierce
supporter
of
the
war
in
iraq
and
comes
to
the
white
house
as
an
unreconstructed
proponent
of
the
invasion
in
fact
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
name
a
proposed
war
that
he
has
not
supported
in
the
past
he
has
repeatedly
advocated
for
military
conflict
in
both
north
korea
and
iran
preemptively
and
that
remains
the
case
the
has
been
negotiating
with
european
officials
over
how
to
amend
the
iran
nuclear
deal
to
appease
donald
trump
germany
the
uk
and
france
have
entertained
stepping
up
some
measures
to
iran
s
ballistic
missiles
program
the
end
date
of
the
limits
on
the
nuclear
program
and
the
authority
of
international
nuclear
inspectors
with
an
eye
on
keeping
the
in
the
wsj
reports
that
the
wants
the
deal
extended
in
perpetuity
but
europe
says
that
would
amount
to
a
renegotiation
of
the
entire
deal
the
sticking
point
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
the
hardline
government
to
find
a
pretext
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
that
was
the
case
before
john
bolton
s
appointment
with
john
bolton
now
chirping
in
trump
s
ear
few
expect
the
iran
deal
to
survive
in
year
bolton
released
a
blueprint
on
how
the
could
and
should
get
out
of
the
deal
a
deal
that
he
called
a
threat
to
in
the
plan
he
says
unilateral
sanctions
should
be
imposed
and
he
also
said
we
will
discuss
military
he
explicitly
says
the
should
provide
assistance
to
a
variety
of
opposition
groups
in
iran
stopping
just
short
of
a
endorsement
of
regime
change
although
that
was
clearly
the
oil
major
that
won
t
leave
iranneedless
to
say
bolton
s
appointment
as
national
security
advisor
likely
means
the
end
of
involvement
in
the
iran
nuclear
deal
the
deadline
to
extend
a
waiver
on
sanctions
is
may
bolton
is
an
unrepentant
advocate
of
regime
change
against
iran
and
his
demands
for
the
may
ultimatum
in
a
practical
sense
will
be
sharper
than
those
of
mcmaster
richard
nephew
a
principal
deputy
coordinator
for
sanctions
policy
at
the
state
department
during
the
obama
administration
told
s
p
global
platts
nephew
authored
a
recent
report
that
estimated
that
iran
could
lose
to
bpd
if
sanctions
were
on
seemed
to
telegraph
his
intentions
on
tuesday
a
lot
of
bad
things
are
happening
in
iran
trump
said
on
march
just
before
meeting
with
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
the
iran
nuclear
deal
is
coming
up
in
one
month
and
you
will
see
what
happens
ultimately
at
this
point
sanctions
on
iran
are
likely
and
in
a
scenario
the
could
begin
exploring
military
options
against
iran
to
say
the
least
the
risk
of
war
is
much
higher
after
bolton
s
a
similar
scenario
is
possible
for
north
korea
bolton
wrote
an
in
february
titled
the
legal
case
for
striking
north
korea
first
and
last
year
he
said
on
fox
news
i
think
the
only
diplomatic
option
left
is
to
end
the
regime
in
north
korea
by
effectively
having
the
south
take
it
over
president
trump
s
with
north
korea
s
kim
may
not
happen
and
the
odds
of
a
military
strike
are
now
much
oil
markets
should
fear
a
demand
shortageif
trump
meets
kim
it
should
be
a
fairly
brief
session
where
trump
says
tell
me
you
have
begun
total
denuclearization
because
we
re
not
going
to
have
protracted
negotiations
you
can
tell
me
right
now
or
we
ll
start
thinking
of
something
else
bolton
said
earlier
this
month
that
something
else
was
clearly
a
reference
to
a
preemptive
military
strike
against
north
korea
summit
is
supposed
to
take
place
in
may
the
same
month
that
the
could
scrap
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
sanctions
may
is
shaping
up
to
a
fateful
month
for
foreign
fallout
could
have
wide
ramifications
for
the
oil
market
a
lot
of
oil
supply
could
be
put
at
risk
this
year
after
the
dramatic
reshuffling
of
the
government
over
the
past
two
weeks
which
has
created
the
most
radically
aggressive
foreign
policy
team
around
the
american
president
in
modern
memory
according
to
the
new
york
it
could
occur
at
a
time
when
the
oil
market
is
getting
tighter
anyway
raising
the
odds
of
much
higher
prices
we
are
only
weeks
away
from
peak
refinery
maintenance
after
which
crude
and
product
demand
should
accelerate
global
inventories
are
already
at
the
bottom
end
of
the
range
with
the
inventory
cushion
largely
gone
oil
prices
will
likely
be
more
sensitive
to
geopolitical
risk
factors
morgan
stanley
said
in
a
research
note
there
are
sufficient
reasons
to
expect
oil
prices
to
strengthen
further
from
here
and
we
stick
with
our
brent
per
barrel
call
for
morgan
stanley
could
be
a
conservative
estimate
if
bolton
succeeds
in
pushing
the
trump
administration
in
a
much
more
hawkish
direction
as
seems
