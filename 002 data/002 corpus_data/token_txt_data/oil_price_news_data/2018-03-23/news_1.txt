u.s. oil interests in jeopardy if key nafta provision is removed
a
group
of
more
than
gop
senators
and
house
representatives
has
called
on
president
trump
to
keep
investor
protection
provisions
in
nafta
intact
otherwise
the
group
says
investments
in
mexico
s
oil
and
gas
industry
would
come
under
legislators
detailed
their
concerns
in
a
letter
to
trade
representative
ambassador
robert
lighthizer
cited
by
s
p
platts
they
urged
the
president
to
keep
these
provisions
intact
to
reassure
companies
investing
south
of
the
border
that
their
investments
are
safe
and
should
an
issue
arise
between
a
company
operating
in
mexico
and
the
government
there
will
be
a
mechanism
in
place
allowing
the
company
to
seek
international
arbitration
to
settle
the
importance
of
these
investor
protection
provisions
seems
to
be
more
prominent
now
than
before
as
the
frontrunner
for
the
mexican
elections
this
summer
is
leftist
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
from
the
morena
party
who
has
more
than
once
said
that
he
will
review
all
oil
contracts
inked
by
the
pena
nieto
government
with
foreign
oil
oil
contracts
are
part
of
the
foray
of
energy
companies
into
mexico
following
a
wide
energy
sector
reform
enacted
in
as
a
result
of
the
reform
after
an
initially
slow
start
to
attracting
foreign
investment
mexico
s
offshore
oil
auctions
have
recently
started
paying
off
after
an
alliance
including
foreign
firms
announced
a
world
class
discovery
estimated
to
hold
more
than
billion
barrels
of
oil
in
of
the
major
global
discoveries
in
the
past
five
the
oil
major
that
won
t
leave
iranin
addition
supermajors
exxon
chevron
and
bp
are
opening
or
plan
to
open
their
first
service
stations
to
tap
into
the
mexican
refined
products
market
shell
is
the
latest
big
oil
player
to
enter
the
retail
market
pledging
us
billion
in
investment
over
the
next
p
platts
meghan
gordon
notes
that
the
investor
protections
under
nafta
have
been
instrumental
in
this
influx
of
and
transnational
energy
company
investments
in
mexico
so
removing
them
could
jeopardize
these
and
future
investments
especially
in
light
of
obrador
s
suggestions
he
would
try
to
undo
the
energy
course
whether
he
would
really
attempt
such
a
move
is
unclear
not
simply
because
he
may
face
constitutional
restrictions
in
his
actions
regarding
the
reform
but
also
because
mexico
needs
higher
oil
and
gas
production
and
pemex
is
in
no
position
to
go
it
alone
in
achieving
this
it
is
not
just
the
most
likely
next
mexican
president
that
is
making
legislators
nervous
some
are
concerned
that
mexico
and
canada
have
already
started
negotiating
their
separate
bilateral
investor
protection
mechanisms
i
deeply
concerned
about
reports
that
mexico
and
canada
have
begun
negotiating
bilateral
isds
provisions
without
us
because
ustr
said
it
does
want
to
participate
in
that
the
chairman
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
kevin
brady
said
during
a
committee
hearing
of
oil
markets
should
fear
a
demand
shortagethe
trade
representative
countered
the
concern
of
the
congressmen
noting
that
there
are
other
ways
to
ensure
an
investment
abroad
such
as
adding
special
clauses
to
that
effect
in
their
contracts
with
the
foreign
government
and
dispute
settlement
channels
these
lighthizer
said
were
used
effectively
before
nafta
and
its
investor
protection
provisions
came
into
lighthizer
s
stance
is
any
indication
washington
is
unhappy
with
the
investor
protection
mechanism
of
nafta
however
as
committee
chairman
brady
pointed
out
american
businesses
want
to
know
who
has
their
back
when
they
invest
abroad
which
for
the
legislators
seems
to
be
the
crux
of
the
nafta
protects
investors
from
all
three
signatory
countries
not
just
ones
which
seems
to
be
lighthizer
s
concern
and
the
government
s
the
investor
protection
debate
seems
to
be
the
latest
sign
that
the
renegotiation
talks
will
continue
to
drag
as
they
have
dragged
