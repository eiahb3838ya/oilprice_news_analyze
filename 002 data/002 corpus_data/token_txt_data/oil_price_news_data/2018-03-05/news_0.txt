shell outsmarts competition in the gulf of mexico
mexico
s
latest
deepwater
auction
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
end
of
january
was
a
success
it
was
a
success
for
shell
too
the
oil
major
snapped
up
out
of
the
awarded
blocks
and
bid
aggressively
on
the
deepwater
blocks
closest
to
the
maritime
s
aggressive
bidding
especially
on
the
blocks
in
the
perdido
area
next
to
the
border
puzzled
some
analysts
and
observers
but
shell
knew
something
that
its
competitors
did
not
six
months
earlier
shell
had
made
a
large
deepwater
oil
discovery
on
the
side
of
the
perdido
area
since
oil
firms
are
not
legally
obliged
to
announce
discoveries
shell
postponed
the
announcement
of
the
discovery
until
the
day
of
the
mexican
auction
as
it
wanted
to
secure
the
adjacent
blocks
in
the
mexican
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
as
early
as
in
july
shell
issued
the
official
announcement
about
the
whale
discovery
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
january
day
on
which
mexico
held
its
deepwater
auction
and
all
bids
had
already
been
the
six
months
following
the
whale
shell
described
in
the
january
release
as
one
of
its
largest
gulf
of
mexico
exploration
finds
in
the
past
decade
oil
major
had
the
time
to
additionally
study
the
geology
of
the
whale
it
was
also
such
good
fortune
that
mexico
was
offering
perdido
areas
in
its
deepwater
auction
so
that
the
mexican
blocks
would
have
geological
characteristics
similar
to
whale
s
and
could
hold
more
on
to
secure
most
of
the
adjacent
on
the
timing
of
the
whale
announcement
andy
brown
upstream
director
at
shell
told
reuters
post
the
whale
discovery
we
had
some
geological
insights
it
is
not
by
accident
we
didn
t
announce
it
until
the
day
of
the
related
chevron
we
will
survive
under
any
climate
change
scenarioin
the
mexican
auction
the
consortia
grabbed
five
of
the
six
awarded
blocks
in
the
perdido
area
shell
also
won
four
more
blocks
in
the
cuencas
salinas
the
proximity
and
technical
similarity
of
this
opportunity
to
our
leading
position
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
will
allow
us
to
benefit
from
and
build
upon
decades
of
experience
complementing
our
position
in
the
region
andy

in
the

release
regarding
the
mexican

same
day

that
shell
confirmed
it
made
a
first
discovery
in
the
western
gom
in
two
years
at
the
whale
prospect
according
to
the
energy
consultancy
the
quick
cycle
time

the
utilization
of

bring

a

has
not
yet
released
resource
estimates
for
the
whale
discovery
two
industry
sources
close
to
the
exploration
efforts
told
reuters
that
recoverable
resources
could
be
up
to
million
barrels
of
the
whale
discovery
last
year
shell
has
acquired
specialized
seismic
data
about
whale
and
the
adjacent
mexican
blocks
a
source
at
an
oil
services
company
told
even
for
us
it
was
surprising
the
way
shell
bid
during
mexico
s
deepwater
auction
they
really
wanted
the
blocks
close
to
the
border
which
indicates
there
must
be
a
link
between
the
formation
in
the
and
in
mexico

s
announcement
of
the
whale
discovery
on
the
day
of
the
mexican
auction
solved
the
mystery
as
to
why
the
oil
major
had
bid
so
aggressively
to
get
the
blocks
closest
to
the
needs
to
replenish
its
oil
reserves
and
deepwater
is
a
priority
in
its
upstream
operations
offshore
mexico
and
brazil
are
crucial
for
the
company
s
plans
shell
has
recently
expanded
its
presence
in
brazil
s
prolific
and
promising
area
worldwide
shell
produced
more
than
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
per
day
boed
from
its
deepwater
business
in
and
some
boed
of
that
production
came
from
brazil
the
company
said
in
october
announcing
the
whale
discovery
this
january
shell
said
that
it
expected
its
global
deepwater
production
to
exceed
boed
by
from
already
discovered
established
whale
discovery
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
potential
for
more
discoveries
in
mexican
waters
could
help
shell
to
boost
its

oil
reserves
and
production
