is shale the future for big oil?
if
anyone
had
compared
shale
oil
to
google
five
years
ago
it
would
have
sounded
strange
yet
when
last
week
in
a
report
wood
mackenzie
s
chairman
and
chief
analyst
simon
flower
did
just
that
comparing
shale
oil
to
the
faang
stocks
he
had
a
good
reason
to
do
so
shale
oil
is
the
star
of
the
decade
as
far
as
the
global
energy
industry
is
concerned
and
now
even
big
oil
has
woken
up
to
this
a
report
detailing
the
relationship
of
big
oil
and
shale
wood
mac
s
analysts
forecast
a
bright
future
for
both
with
the
share
of
shale
oil
in
the
supermajors
total
production
rising
from
the
current
bpd
to
million
bpd
in
before
it
starts
declining
this
will
represent
a
tenth
of
the
supermajors
total
production
wood
mac
s
research
analyst
roy
martin
said
in
the
it
s
not
just
the
supermajors
that
are
expanding
their
shale
oil
footprint
at
a
fast
pace
large
independents
are
getting
larger
too
as
houston
chronicle
commentator
chris
tomlinson
noted
in
a
recent
story
on
the
same
topic
seasoned
oil
executives
know
that
when
both
prices
and
production
rise
it
s
time
to
cash
out
and
sell
to
the
big
there
s
a
consolidation
underway
in
the
shale
patch
and
it
will
likely
continue
for
some
time
until
tomlinson
argues
only
the
strongest
players
remain
all
in
a
position
to
benefit
from
the
marriage
of
lower
costs
higher
drilling
and
production
efficiency
and
consequently
consistent
output
the
most
notable
acquisitions
in
this
area
so
far
this
year
were
bhp
billiton
s
sale
of
its
shale
operations
to
bp
for
us
billion
after
it
was
pressured
by
elliott
management
to
exit
shale
as
well
as
encana
s
purchase
of
newfield
exploration
for
us
billion
and
chesapeake
s
acquisition
of
wildhorse
resource
development
for
us
billion
according
to
tomlinson
the
total
value
of
m
a
deals
in
shale
since
the
start
of
the
year
stands
at
us
billion
but
as
it
usually
happens
if
it
looks
to
good
to
be
true
it
probably
starters
not
all
supermajors
are
so
bent
on
growing
in
shale
french
total
and
italian
eni
have
so
far
shunned
shale
oil
and
there
are
no
indications
they
are
likely
to
change
their
stance
anytime
soon
related
analysts
see
opportunities
in
embattled
energy
stocks
i
have
nothing
against
the
permian
total
s
patrick
pouyanné
said
this
spring
at
ceraweek
in
response
to
a
question
about
why
total
has
not
followed
suit
with
the
other
supermajors
he
added
at
the
time
that
he
thought
it
was
an
incredible
area
for
competitors
who
already
have
positions
there
for
a
company
like
total
it
s
not
just
a
matter
of
ticking
the
box
to
produce
bpd
it
makes
no
sense
the
ceo
said
adding
that
when
i
think
of
areas
of
investment
i
need
to
target
bpd
if
i
m
a
serious
italy
s
eni
is
apparently
following
a
similar
logic
with
both
european
supermajors
more
interested
in
offshore
exploration
and
africa
than
in
shale
given
the
capital
intensiveness
of
shale
oil
production
their
logic
is
even
those
with
an
established
position
in
the
shale
patch
are
facing
challenges
investors
are
also
aware
of
the
capital
intensiveness
of
shale
oil
production
and
they
are
still
suspicious
of
executives
chesapeake
s
stocks
for
example
dived
by
percent
on
the
announcement
of
the
wildhorse
purchase
investors
in
shale
oil
are
mistrustful
and
companies
will
need
a
lot
more
time
as
well
as
free
cash
flow
and
returns
to
convince
them
that
all
is
good
once
again
that
s
why
as
houston
chronicle
s
tomlinson
said
in
his
analysis
investors
will
do
well
to
keep
up
the
pressure
on
oil
companies
to
maximize
efficiency
and
produce
profits
because
the
future
