shale drillers are supersizing fracking
shale
drillers
have
squeezed
more
oil
out
of
a
given
well
over
the
past
few
years
by
becoming
more
efficient
in
their
drilling
operations
but
the
industry
is
still
scaling
up
and
shale
executives
are
now
throwing
around
buzzwords
such
as
cube
development
and
supersizing
referring
to
the
massive
footprint
of
today
s
the
past
shale
companies
figured
out
a
way
to
cut
costs
while
expanding
production
drilling
more
wells
on
a
single
wellpad
in
essence
that
lowered
the
average
cost
of
a
shale
well
allowing
drillers
to
do
more
with
less
other
techniques
were
also
scaled
up
such
as
using
more
frac
sand
more
water
and
drilling
longer
laterals
that
allowed
shale
firms
to
survive
during
the
downturn
and
it
has
also
led
to
surging
production
that
is
breaking
new
records
with
each
passing
the
process
continues
and
shale
companies
are
using
that
same
logic
today
to
continue
to
scale
up
for
instance
as
bloomberg
reports
encana
is
pursuing
a
drilling
approach
called
cube
development
in
which
the
company
drills
about
wells
from
a
single
wellpad
extending
in
every
direction
with
the
aim
of
extracting
oil
and
gas
from
the
multiple
layers
of
the
permian
rather
than
each
well
targeting
an
individual
shale
term
refers
to
the
notion
that
the
driller
is
accessing
the
entire
cube
beneath
the
surface
rather
than
just
the
hydrocarbon
resources
immediately
around
the
individual
wells
t
he
permian
is
graduating

a
jpmorgan

analyst
told
bloomberg
now
it
s
all
about
entering
manufacturing
mode
more
and
more
shale
companies
are
following
this
approach
supersizing
individual
projects
to
pull
more
oil
and
gas
out
of
the
ground
related
why
is
the
spread
shrinking
the
flip
side
is
that
some
question
the
economics
of
such
a
massive
project
which
encana
has
likened
to
a
military
occupation
the
encana
project
likely
cost
around
million
jpmorgan
analyst
gabriel
daoud
said
according
to
bloomberg
associated
costs
such
as
upgrading
gathering
lines
using
more
labor
additional
equipment
call
into
question
whether
supersizing
really
achieves
the
benefits
of
economies
of
scale
but
encana
says
that
because
the
approach
can
produce
more
oil
and
gas
the
costs
have
declined
by
a
quarter
at
its
supersized
operations
in
canada
s
montney
is
one
of
the
more
aggressive
companies
in
this
regard
with
all
of
its
wells
set
to
come
from
these
supersized
wellpads
some
texas
shale
drillers
as
bloomberg
notes
are
a
bit
more
cautious
pioneer
natural
resources
and

resources
two
notable
texas
shale
firms
are
likely
keeping
the
number
of
wells
on
a
given
wellpad
in
the
single
digits
for
the
time
being
a
spokeswoman
for
eog
resources
expressed
some
concern
that
too
many
wells
could
impact
overall
productivity
according
to
a
similar
phenomenon
is
playing
out
in
the
shale
gas
arena
as
well
according
to
the
pittsburgh
the
top
shale
gas
drillers
in
the
marcellus
shale
are
supersizing
their
operations
eqt
the
largest
gas
producer
in
the
country
is
drilling
as
many
as
to
gas
wells
per
wellpad
with
laterals
extending
as
long
as
miles
in
every
direction
eqt
like
encana
is
also
trying
to
hit
multiple
shale
layers
in
one
go
rather
than
drilling
individual
wells
for
a
specific
section
of
the
shale
formation
related
how
the
fed
could
hammer

producersin
an
operation
as
large
as
this
spending
on
a
single
project
can
run
as
high
as
a
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars
the
shale
companies
are
taking
encana
s
approach
at
supersized
well
pads
but
drilling
the
wells
in
an
incremental
fashion
the
idea
is
that
the
company
can
drill
a
half
dozen
shale
wells
wait
for
the
market
to
catch
up
and
then
return
to
the
same
supersized
wellpad
and
drill
more
wells
in
the
meantime
much
of
the
upfront
cost
for
the
wellpad
and
has
already
been
spent
and
the
additional
wells
are
comparatively
cheap
to
pull
is
not
yet
percent
clear
that
the
trend
towards
supersizing
will
be
successful
or
that
dozens
of
wells
per
wellpad
is
preferable
to
a
smaller
number
but
if
supesizing
proves
to
be
much
more
efficient
then
the
upshot
could
be
a
shift
towards
more
consolidation
in
the
industry
shale
companies
could
struggle
compared
to
their
larger
corporate
competitors
lacking
the
financial
heft
to
pull
off
