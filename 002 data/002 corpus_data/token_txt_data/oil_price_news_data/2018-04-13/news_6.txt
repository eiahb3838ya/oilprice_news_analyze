the
government
in

a
comeback
however
the
mps
said
there
was
nothing
the
government
in
baghdad
can
do
about
the
situation
which
is
depriving
it
of
part
of
the
oil
revenues
from
the
kirkuk
oil
although
there
is
no
mention
in
the
kurdistan
report
how
much
oil
the
militias
are
hashd
which
helped
the
iraqi
army
regain
control
of
kirkuk
and
the
fields
around
it
from
the
kurdish
peshmerga
do
not
report

the
