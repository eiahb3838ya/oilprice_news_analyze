how significant is wti’s breakout?

after
looking
rangebound
for
a
while
albeit
at
the
highest
levels
since
looks
like
it
has
broken
out
when

challenged
february
s
high
of
a
few
weeks
ago
we
reached
before
retreating
rapidly
a
pattern
that
reinforced
the
resistance
level
and
suggested
that
we
would
head
lower
again
a
couple
of
days
ago
however
we
broke
through
and
have
been
trading
above
that
point
for
three
days
now
that
confirms
that
wti
has
broken
out
of
its
range
but
the
lack
of

through
since
suggests
that
this
may
not
be
all
that
significant

the
first
question
that
heeds
to
be
answered
is
how
significant
any
technical
signal
is
in
the
longer
term
the
answer
is
not
very
even
clearly
visible
technical
analysis
such
as
this
can
only
take
you
so
far
the
break
of
a
level
often
triggers
stop
loss
orders
clustered
around
it
so
can
cause
a
quick
jump
that
traders
can
exploit
intraday
but
over
time
more
powerful
fundamental
forces
hold
sway
it
is
those
fundamentals
that
forced
oil
higher
this
demand
factors
that
have
been
in
play
for
nearly
a
year
now
are
well
known
improving
global
and
growth
suggest
higher
oil
demand
and
the
market
has
reacted
accordingly
what
changed
this
week
however
was
the
supply
side
of
the
equation
conventional
wisdom
has
held
that
that
was
a
restricting
factor
for
oil
prices
the
seeming
ability
of
north
american
shale
producers
to
turn
production
on
and
off
in
response
to
price
moves
suggested
that
the
run
up
would
prompt
big
increases
in
supply
that
is
still
a
possibility
but
what
changed
this
week
was
the
supply
picture

east
tensions
and
conflicts
are
nothing
new
for
oil
traders
nor
for
anyone
else
for
that
matter
they
have
existed
for
millennia
and
the
occasional
are
sometimes
taken
in
stride
by
the
market
the
reaction
to
syria
s
president
assad
using
chemical
weapons
against
his
own
people
however
has
the
potential
to
be
very
are
calls
for
a
reaction
greater
than
the
targeted
strikes
employed
by
president
trump
last
time
and
that
has
traders
worried
there
has
been
talk
from
opec
this
week
about
extending
their
production
cuts
into
next
year
but
if
the
proxy
war
in
syria
heats
up
the
prospect
of
a
unified
front
by
the
signatories
to
that
agreement
are
seriously
reduced
if
the
vienna
agreement
were
to
break
down
just
as
shale
producers
are
ramping
up
production
it
doesn
t
take
a
genius
to
conclude
that
oil
will
be
hit
of
that
however
is
speculation
and
if
we
return
to
the
recent
price
action
there
are
suggestions
that
the
market
is
not
worried
even
as
trump
has
been
tweeting
out
contradictory
signals
this
week
and
the
iea
has
issued
a
report
that
they
expect
the
signatories
to
the
vienna
agreement
to
declare
mission
accomplished
wti
has
held
above
the
previous
highs
that
indicates
one
of
two
things
either
traders
are
not
worried
about
the
effects
should
that
be
the
case
or
simply
don
t
believe
it
will
then
while
technical
levels
and
breakouts
are
not
usually
too
significant
in
the
long
term
the
lack
of
volatility
following
the
initial
push
upwards
suggests
that
this
one
may
be
we
are
still
close
enough
that
a
drop
back
below
could
come
and
return
us
to
the
previous
range
but
forming
a
new
range
of
around
looks
more
