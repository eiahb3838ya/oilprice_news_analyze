the worldâ€™s most profitable oil major
for
decades
giant
aramco
has
been
a
financial
enigma
but
the
curtains
have
now
been
pulled
back
thanks
to
some
anonymous
sources
revealed
to
and
traders

for

tried
their
hand

sources
presumably
close
to
the
small
aramco
have
revealed
that
net
income
came
in
at
a
whopping
billion
for
the
oil
giant
this
figure
exceeds

when
it
comes
to
