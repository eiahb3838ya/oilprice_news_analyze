the biggest hurdle to china’s yuan-priced crude benchmark
china
finally
launched
last
month
its
crude
oil
futures
that
have
been
in
the
works
for
years
after
several
start
of
the
new
contract
trading
was
successful
attracting
interest
from
institutional
and
retail
investors
and
major
commodity
trading
houses
glencore
and
trafigura
yet
it
s
too
soon
to
call
the
contract
a
total
success
because
it
still
faces
a
long
road
toward
building
reputation
and
history
analysts
say
they
have
also
identified
the
single
biggest
risk
factor
for
western
extent
to
which
china
could
meddle
with
government
regulation
in
the
yuan
crude
futures
as
beijing
is
known
for
little
tolerance
toward
wild
price
swings
in
its
markets
and
has
a
history
of
is
also
the
conclusion
of
china
s
biggest
crude
oil
supplier
opec
in
its
april
monthly
oil
market
report
the
accounts
for
close
to
percent
of
china
s
crude
oil
that
the
extent
to
which
the
ine
contract
is
independent
from
government
interference
is
currently
the
main
risk
factor
facing
western
investors
which
is
in
addition
to
a
currency
risk
given
that
the
ine
is
settled
in
according
to
reuters
john
kemp
possible
chinese
intervention
on
the
yuan
crude
future
market
could
be
one
of
the
three
elements
that
could
doom
the
new
contract
citing
the
paper
why
some
futures
contracts
succeed
and
others
fail
kemp
argues
that
the
third
key
element
to
a
successful
futures
policy
should
not
be
too
adverse
to
futures
be
the
stumbling
block
to
the
chinese
crude
futures
while
the
new
contract
could
easily
meet
the
other
two
criteria
for
success
these
are
a
commercial
need
for
hedging
and
a
pool
of
speculators
must
be
attracted
to
a
especially
its
middle
eastern
producers
will
be
closely
watching
the
futures
contract
because
once
established
the
chinese
reference
crude
price
could
act
as
a
regional
benchmark
for
negotiations
of
spot
or
term
crude
oil
prices
the
contract
is
made
up
of
seven
crudes
prevalent
in
the
chinese
freely
traded
middle
east
grades
basrah
light
dubai
masila
oman
qatar
marine
and
upper
zakum
and
china
s
shengli
crude
related
will
batteries
ever
become
viable
at
this
level
of
imports
from
opec
middle
eastern
producing
nations
will
be
watching
closely
as
they
could
in
time
face
pressure
from
their
chinese
buyers
to
adopt
this
benchmark
for
pricing
their
physical
crude
contracts
the
cartel
said
in
its
monthly
fact
that
opec
dedicated
a
special
article
on
the
chinese
yuan
crude
futures
in
its
closely
watched
report
shows
that
the
cartel
is
taking
seriously
the
possibility
that
at
some
point
in
the
future
its
middle
eastern
members
may
have
to
price
the
oil
they
sell
to
china
versus
a
chinese
crude
the
official
goal
of
the
new
futures
contract
is
to
establish
a
regional
benchmark
for
more
useful
pricing
of
the
crude
grades
prevalent
on
the
chinese
market
analysts
see
the
yuan
oil
futures
as
a
step
toward
china
seeking
wider
acceptance
of
its
currency
in
global
trade
including
the
oil
trade
and
establishing
a
petroyuan
that
could
challenge
in
the
future
the
dominance
of
the
is
now
the
biggest
crude
oil
importer
in
the
world
and
the
pace
of
its
oil
demand
growth
is
capable
of
influencing
the
oil
market
and
the
trade
in
the
two
most
traded
crude
futures
in
the
world
brent
and
wti
so
it
makes
sense
for
the
top
crude
importer
to
want
to
use
oil
as
a
means
to
promote
its
own
currency
on
international
to
dr
mohamed
ramady
an
energy
economist
and
geopolitical
expert
on
the
gcc
the
launch
of
the
yuan
crude
futures
contract
has
two
key
and
pragmatism
on
the
practical
side
such
a
contract
would
better
reflect
the
crude
grades
on
the
chinese
market
that
often
differ
from
the
grades
underpinning
the
brent
and
wti
oil
prices
fall
as
eia
confirms
inventory
buildon
the
political
front
denominating
oil
contracts
in
yuan
would
promote
the
use
of
china
s
currency
in
global
trade
one
of
the
country
s
key
goals
as
an
alternative
to
the
dollar
making
this
even
more
appealing
to
countries
relying
on
the
dollar
ramady
writes
in
the
yuan
is
still
used
in
less
than
percent
of
global
trade
but
the
yuan
crude
futures
contract
and
china
s
push
to
assert
its
currency
internationally
could
perceptibly
change
in
the
near
future
and
create
the
conditions
for
a
respectable
challenge
to
the
us
dollar
ramady
briscoe
head
of
fixed

asia
pacific
at
ubs
asset
management
said
in
a
report
just
before
the
chinese
futures
launched
that
we
believe
that
in
the
long
term
this
will
change
how
oil
is
traded
globally
create
a
petroyuan
currency
flow
increase
the
role
of
the
rmb
as
a
global
trading
currency
and
compel
investors
to
up
their
allocations
to
chinese
financial
in
the
longer
term
yuan
oil
trading
could
shift
the
structure
of
the
global
oil
market
but
two
things
need
to
happen
first
briscoe
says
one
is
that
china
needs
to
remove
or
substantially
reduce
capital
controls
the
other
is
that
china
s
oil
suppliers
such
as
saudi
arabia
russia
and
iran
to
agree
to
accept
yuan
for
their
oil
exports
to
china
this
is
also
taking
shape
because
russia
already
accepts
rmb
for
oil
exports
as
does
iran
and
we
expect
saudi
arabia
to
soon
begin
invoicing
china
in
rmb
briscoe
yuan
crude
futures
launch
is
as
much
practicality
as
it
is
politics
but
many
analysts
and
opec
itself
see
chinas
domestic
capital
market
policies
as
the
biggest
threat
to
the
contract
