pipeline opponents need a shot of common sense
the
very
word
pipeline
these
days
seem
to
put
a
lot
of
people
on
edge
it
has
somehow
become
a
synonym
of
evil
yet
pipelines
are
simply
infrastructure
for
transporting
liquid
and
gaseous
hydrocarbons
from
one
place
to
another
the
reason
they
are
necessary
is
that
oil
and
gas
have
to
go
where
they
are
needed
by
both
supporters
and
opponents
of
the
fossil
fuel
industry
we
all
use
is
now
a
growing
problem
with
oil
and
gas
pipeline
capacity
in
north
america
and
the
solution
involves
opponents
embracing
common
sense
which
says
that
you
can
not
keep
it
in
the
ground
and
have
the
lights
on
securely
at
the
same
james
conca
exemplifies
the
impossibility
of
eating
your
cake
and
having
it
too
with
new
england
new
england
is
very
and
anti
oil
gas
and
nuclear
it
is
closing
its
nuclear
plants
faster
than
it
is
adding
renewable
capacity
and
it
is
paying
through
the
nose
for
emergency
lng
cargoes
when
electricity
demand
jumps
why
according
to
conca
it
s
because
the
states
do
not
want
the
new
pipelines
they
need
and
they
also
doesn
t
want
the
additional
transmission
lines
from
canada
to
import
more
power
as
a
result
the
region
is
suffering
you
haven
t
been
following
the
headlines
from
canada
recently
the
situation
is
not
much
different
there
a
lot
of
people
don
t
want
the
trans
mountain
oil
pipeline
to
be
expanded
they
don
t
want
any
pipelines
to
be
expanded
or
built
but
another
group
of
people
finds
that
this
pipeline
s
expansion
is
essential
for
turning
canada
into
a
truly
international
oil
s
true
that
canada
s
heavy
oil
is
dirtier
than
gas
and
that
transporting
it
is
more
expensive
than
transporting
regular
crude
because
it
needs
to
be
diluted
to
a
liquid
form
but
canada
needs
the
international
markets
as
production
continues
to
grow
on
both
sides
of
the
border
but
demand
is
not
sufficient
to
absorb
all
that
alberta
s
producers
have
to
offer
related
the
invisible
sweet
spot
for
big
oilwhat
pipeline
opponents
like
to
point
out
is
the
danger
of
legitimate
issue
yet
these
same
people
seem
unconcerned
about
the
higher
spill
risks
inherent
in
railway
transportation
which
canadian
producers
are
forced
to
resort
to
due
to
pipeline
capacity
shortage
if
we
are
talking
about
statistically
calculated
risks
then
these
are
the
lowest
with
pipelines
especially
in
the
age
of
environmentalism
when
every
pipeline
project
is
the
object
of
very
close
scrutiny
causing
pipeline
builders
to
avoid
cutting
pipeline
proponents
on
the
other
hand
like
to
point
out
is
that
a
lot
of
the
pipeline
network
in
north
america
is
of
it
older
than
half
a
century
the
older
a
piece
of
infrastructure
the
higher
the
risk
of
a
breakdown
yet
the
lobby
is
against
that
too
for
reasons
that
are
not
precisely
replacement
should
be
easy
enough
but
it
is
not
enbridge
s
proposal
to
replace
the
aging
line
was
met
with
severe
opposition
despite
the
fact
that
the
replacement
is
supposed
to
make
the
pipeline
safer
pipeline
replacement
can
certain
the
need
for
new
infrastructure
conca
notes
a
minor
expansion
of
the
diameter
of
the
pipes
can
increase
the
flow
of
oil
through
them
quite
a
factor
of
four
in
would
think
that
people
would
choose
the
lesser
evil
of
expanded
pipelines
to
new
ones
but
it
appears
that
opposition
is
a
very
supporters
want
no
pipelines
period
of
course
no
pipelines
at
all
would
mean
blackouts
and
a
lot
of
have
yet
to
fully
replace
oil
and
gas
and
be
as
somehow
this
doesn
t
seem
to
be
a
concern
perhaps
because
it
hasn
t
started
happening
everywhere
and
the
reason
it
hasn
t
started
happening
is
that
