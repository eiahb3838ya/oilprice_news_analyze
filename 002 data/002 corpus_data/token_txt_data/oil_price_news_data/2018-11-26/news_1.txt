the real effect of iran sanction waivers
on
the
day
sanctions
against
iran
went
into
effect
brent
crude
traded
at
us
a
barrel
today
three
weeks
later
brent
is
down
to
us
a
barrel
and
president
trump
is
congratulating
himself
on
the
low
oil
prices
instead
of
shooting
up
to
us
oil
prices
are
falling
and
the
waivers
granted
to
eight
large
iranian
oil
buyers
are
among
the
main
reasons
for
this
but
how
long
with
the
effect
of
the
waivers
last
bloomberg
last
week
published
a
of
how
much
each
of
the
seven
importers
that
won
waivers
are
allowed
to
continue
importing
from
iran
and
the
numbers
suggest
these
seven
countries
could
continue
buying
over
a
million
bpd
of
iranian
crude
until
the
waivers
expire
next
year
however
the
key
word
here
is
could
japan
for
example
one
of
the
world
s
top
crude
oil
importers
and
a
large
client
of
iran
stopped
buying
crude
ahead
of
the
sanctions
to
improve
its
chances
of
scoring
a
waiver
now
that
it
has
the
waiver
japanese
refiners
are
still
not
sure
they
should
resume
buying
iranian
crude
which
makes
one
wonder
why
they
even
worked
to
secure
a
waiver
if
they
were
not
going
to
use
it
yet
theoretically
these
refiners
can
import
about
bpd
of
iranian
crude
down
from
bpd
before
the
korea
is
another
reluctant
buyer
because
of
its
close
links
with
the
united
states
the
country
was
granted
a
waiver
that
would
allow
it
to
import
iranian
crude
at
a
rate
of
bpd
over
a
period
of
six
months
but
refiners
have
yet
to
resume
imports
related
could
oil
prices
fall
to
india
and
china
are
importing
iranian
crude
the
former
at
the
allowed
rate
of
some
bpd
according
to
order
data
the
latter
china
was
allowed
to
continue
buying
iranian
crude
at
a
rate
of
bpd
but
it
also
has
rights
to
production
from
fields
in
iran
where
chinese
companies
have
stakes
so
it
may
be
getting
more
than
is
the
country
that
has
had
to
slash
its
intake
of
iranian
crude
the
most
and
it
is
also
the
country
that
would
have
the
biggest
problem
finding
an
affordable
alternative
to
iranian
crude
when
the
waivers
expire
india
was
lucky
pessimistic
forecasts
for
the
global
economy
and
indications
of
oversupply
pressured
prices
but
this
may
only
be
temporary
opec
is
talking
about
production
cuts
again
after
importers
would
also
have
to
find
alternative
sources
of
crude
that
can
compete
with
iranian
crude
on
prices
these
are
to
put
it
mildly
few
and
far
between
since
tehran
is
selling
its
crude
at
a
discount
to
maintain
market
share
other
producers
can
not
afford
to
sell
at
such
discounts
so
what
happens
when
the
waivers
expire
importers
would
have
two
choices
breach
the
sanctions
and
risk
washington
s
wrath
or
switch
to
costlier
crude
which
will
be
even
costlier
at
the
time
because
the
end
of
the
waivers
will
definitely
have
an
impact
on
prices
these
fatter
oil
import
bills
won
t
do
much
for
these
economies
growth
prospects
and
we
just
saw
last
month
what
pessimistic
economic
growth
prospects
do
to
oil
demand
outlooks
and
prices
especially
if
they
concern
india
and
irina
