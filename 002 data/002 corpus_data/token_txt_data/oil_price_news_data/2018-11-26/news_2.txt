hoping
to

help
narrow
brazil
s
massive

bolsonaro
prepares
to
take
office
on
january
his
transition
team
may
need
to
negotiate
how
different
brazilian

and
municipalities
could
divide
the
revenues
from
the
potential
sale
of
stakes
in
more
fields
to
foreign
oil
firms
this
uncertainty
is
not
welcome
news
for
big
oil
which
has
expressed
interest
in
the
area
that
has
been
explored
to
some
extent
and
proven
to
hold
much
more
oil
than
initially

holds
percent
of

has
explored
the
area
and
found
that
a
lot
more
oil
lies
in

there
are
estimates
that
the
transfer
of
rights
area
could
hold
up
to
billion
barrels
of
oil
in
excess
of
the
billion
barrels
to
which
petrobras
is
entitled
to
produce
when
the

transferred
the
area
to

pass
legislation
to
remove
the
obligation
that
only
