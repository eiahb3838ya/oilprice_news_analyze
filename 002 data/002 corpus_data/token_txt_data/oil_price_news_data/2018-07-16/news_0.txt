peak
oil
demand
is
expected
to
come
around
as
electric
vehicles
and
autonomous
vehicles
are
expected
to
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
the
world
s
transportation
sector
the

by
each
autonomous
ev
is
forecast
to
displace
more
of
the
oil
demand
than
the
conventional
ev
according
to
they
will
be
on
the
road
far
more
as
they
are
autonomous
displacing
a
disproportionate
amount
of
transport
the
ft
quoted
rawle
as
the
next
ten
years
the
biggest
curb
on
oil
demand
will
be
fuel
efficiency
and
gasoline
demand
is
seen
as
the
first
fuel
to
reach
its
around
according
to
wood
sources
of
oil
demand
including
petrochemicals
will
grow
stronger
than
gasoline
demand
the
analysts
companies
including
saudi
aramco
are
betting
on
petrochemicals
to
secure
demand
for
its
crude
oil
related
chinese
oil
demand
growth
could
slow
down
soonaramco
however
says
that
there
is
no
impending
peak
demand
and
that
global
oil
demand
will
continue
to
grow
and
that
oil
will
maintain
its
preeminence
in
the
global
energy
mix
for
the
foreseeable
but
european
oil
majors
have
started
to
project
in
recent
years
that
the
world
is
likely
to
reach
peak
oil
demand
within
two
decades
or
probably
earlier
and
have
started
to
incorporate
those
projections
in
their
energy
transition
