libyan oil in jeopardy as peace talks fail
libya
s
national
oil
company
noc
has
once
again
shocked
the
oil
market
by
officially
declaring
force
majeure
on
its
operations
at
the
el
sharara
oilfield
the
largest
oilfield
in
the
country
after
months
of
continued
optimism
in
the
media
and
political
statements
coming
out
of
paris
and
rome
about
a
possible
peace
deal
between
the
two
competing
governments
led
by
libyan
general
haftar
and
his
counterpart
el
serraj
the
situation
on
the
ground
is
looking
even
worse
than
before
the
eagerly
awaited
oil
production
increase
from
libya
which
could
supposedly
mitigate
the
effects
of
falling
production
from
iran
and
venezuela
now
seems
unlikely
to
happen
noc
officials
stated
that
the
production
of
the
bpd
field
which
is
located
in
the
south
of
libya
has
been
blocked
by
protestors
and
militias
in
the
area
a
group
of
tribes
armed
protestors
and
guards
took
over
the
field
on
december
asking
for
salary
payments
and
additional
financing
until
now
libyan
government
officials
have
been
unable
to
quell
the
protests
noc
officials
have
reiterated
that
the
financial
demands
will
not
be
met
as
this
could
set
a
precedent
for
other
oil
and
gas
operations
in
the
is
still
unclear
who
the
real
culprits
behind
the
current
blockade
and
seizure
of
the
field
are
as
sources
are
blaming
different
groups
or
militias
noc
claims
that
the
field
has
been
taken
over
by
a
militia
that
is
reportedly
trying
to
get
on
the
payroll
of
the
field
guards
no
indication
at
present
can
be
given
as
to
when
the
field
will
come
back
onstream
noc
s
chairman
mustafa
sanallah
has
called
for
the
force
majeure
in
a
move
to
provide
security
to
the
workers
at
the
recent
weeks
several
other
fields
have
also
been
occupied
blocked
or
taken
over
but
production
has
not
been
significantly
impacted
at
those
fields
tribal
representatives
and
several
militias
have
indicated
to
the
press
that
the
current
blockade
is
a
protest
against
marginalization
and
shortages
of
electricity
fuel
and
is
the
backed
libyan
government

that
is
feeling
the
brunt
of
the
pain
from
these
protests
the
militias
and
tribal
groups
are
currently
targeting

on

in

the
port
was
closed
for
a
long
period
due
to
pressure
from

libya

political
and

future
is
a
shambles
even
after
meetings
in

where
the
french
and
italian
government
tried
to
set
up
their
own
security
and
governmental
arrangements
between
the
fighting
factions
the
is
no
end
in
sight
to
the
fighting
on
the
ground
currently
another
round
of
violence
is
brewing
in
and
around

several
militias
are
looking
to
expand
their
control
over
parts
of

gna
since
a
brokered
ceasefire
in
september
most
militias
have
been
pulling
back
but
the
tensions
at
present
point
to
a
willingness
for
a
new
round
of
conflict
the
approach
to
either
include
the
militias
in
security
forces
or
demobilize
them
is
under
pressure
still
some
hope
remains
as
analysts
indicate
that
militia
leaders
are
willing
to
cooperate
largely
in
a
move
to
protect
their
illegal
income
stability
in
the
end
will
depend
on
the
willingness
of
the
gna
forces
to
put
their
foot
down

if
the

situation
can
be

the
future
depends
largely
on
general

haftar
is
looking
for
any
opportunity
to
expand
his
powers
to
the
western
parts
of
libya

also
shown
a

declared
hours
later
that
he
has
no
intention
of
sticking
to
that
agreement
past
attempts
to
negotiate
peace
in
libya
have
been
undone
by
splits
within
each
faction
which
are
often
made
up
of
loose
alliances
of
convenience
among
brigades
of
former
rebels
more
loyal
to
cities

other

this
bodes
well
for
libya

oil
operations
haftar
s
next
moves
towards
tripoli
will
almost
certainly
be
a
military
operation
to
win
all
oil

fields
that
are
currently
under

influence
more
actions
and
possible
