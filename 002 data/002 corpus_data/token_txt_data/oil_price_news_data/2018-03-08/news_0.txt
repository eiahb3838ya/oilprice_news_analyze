saudi arabia plans its own shale revolution
saudi
arabia
has
big
gas
plans
with
aramco
eyeing
a
twofold
increase
in
its
natural
gas
production
over
the
next
ten
years
as
it
seeks
to
switch
local
power
plants
to
gas
from
oil
so
it
can
export
more
crude
this
gas
apparently
could
come
from
shale
world
energy
council
estimates
that
saudi
arabia
has
recoverable
gas
reserves
of
billion
tons
of
oil
equivalent
proved
reserves
stood
at
trillion
cu
m
as
of
these
are
just
conventional
gas
figures
the
wec
notes
according
to
aramco
s
head
of
unconventional
resources
khalid
al
abdulqader
the
country
s
shale
gas
resources
are
one
of
the
top
spots
for
shale
gas
drilling
is
the
jafurah
basin
which
is
similar
in
size
to
texas
eagle
ford
according
to
al
abdulqader
but
he
declined
to
give
any
details
regarding
the
reserves
in
place
analysts
that
bloomberg
s
wael
mahdi
and
bruce
stanley
spoke
to
believe
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
the
shale
basins
in
the
kingdom
to
contain
a
lot
of
gas
the
question
is
whether
this
gas
is
actually
recoverable
at
a
cost
that
is
low
enough
to
make
production
historical
data
is
any
judge
this
is
doubtful
mahdi
and
stanley
note
the
string
of
exits
by
international
oil
and
gas
companies
after
they
failed
to
make
any
meaningful
gas
discoveries
in
the
kingdom
these
included
french
total
italy
s
eni
and
spanish
repsol
exxon
and
chevron
have
operations
in
the
country
but
not
in
gas
exploration
lukoil
was
the
latest
to
announce
it
was
pulling
out
of
its
saudi
gas
drilling
venture
last
year
after
it
failed
to
discover
any
up
its
gas
production
makes
a
lot
of
sense
for
saudi
arabia
constrained
by
the
opec
oil
production
cut
deal
the
kingdom
would
naturally
be
looking
for
ways
to
maximize
its
oil
export
revenues
without
increasing
production
at
least
for
the
time
being
aramco
has
planned
investments
of
us
billion
over
the
next
decade
to
maintain
its
spare
production
capacity
and
also
expand
gas
exploration
both
conventional
and
unconventional
by
according
to
plans
aramco
should
be
producing
billion
cu
ft
of
natural
gas

saudis
hint
they
could
delay
aramco
ipo
until
attainable
this
goal
is
still
an
unknown
riyadh
is
being
upbeat
but
then
again
riyadh
is
always
upbeat
about
its
oil
and
gas
plans
the
fact
that
al
abdulqader
has
shied
away
from
revealing
any
estimate
of
the
size
of
resources
in
the
jafurah
any
other
shale
basin
for
that
be
interpreted
in
one
of
three
that
aramco
is
keeping
its
gas
cards
close
to
its
chest
biding
its
time
until
the
moment
comes
to
wow
the
world
with
massive
gas
reserves
two
that
a
reliable
estimate
is
yet
to
be
made
and
three
that
al
abdulqader
s
statement
about
the
kingdom
s
huge
gas
reserves
is
timed
perfectly
as
part
of
the
aramco
pitch
for
investors
as
the
company
moves
closer
to
its
listing
scheduled
for
the
second
half
of
this
is
currently
drilling
for
gas
in
jafurah
and
in
south
ghawar
the
world
s
largest
oil
field
we
can
reasonably
expect
more
news
in
the
coming
months
if
the
drilling
campaign
is
successful
after
all
diversification
sells
even
if
it
s
this
kind
of
internal
diversification
