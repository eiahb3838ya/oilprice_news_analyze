oil, gas drilling in canada set for a decline
drilling
for
oil
and
gas
in
canada
will
likely
decline
by
percent
in
the
petroleum
services
association
of
canada
has
forecast
blaming
pipeline
capacity
shortages
and
the
resultant
discount
in
canadian
heavy
to
the
west
texas
intermediate
benchmark
for
the
psac
said
it
expected
oil
and
gas
companies
to
drill
new
wells
next
year
which
would
be
down
from
this
year
and
the
lowest
number
of
new
wells
in
three
years
yet
over
the
year
drilling
will
increase
the
psac
forecast
as
the
volume
of
oil
transported
by
rail
for
lack
of
enough
pipelines
continues
to
the
good
news
front
the
discount
at
which
western

a
national
energy
board
of
canada
recently
released
a
report
forecasting
that
oil
and
gas
production
will
continue
to
increase
while
domestic
consumption
declines
thanks
to
energy
efficiency
natural
gas
along
with
hydropower
and
other
renewable
sources
will
come
to
account
for
a
bigger
share
of
the
country
s

mix
while
oil
production
grows
for
the
next
years
neb
expects
crude
oil
production
to
grow
by
as
much
as
percent
while
natural
gas
production
expands
by
percent

industry
executives
are
quite
disgruntled
about
the

will
likely
continue
