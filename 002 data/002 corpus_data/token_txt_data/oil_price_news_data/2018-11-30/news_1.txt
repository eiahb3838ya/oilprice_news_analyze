the saudi dilemma: to cut or not to cut
to
cut
and
push
up
prices
or
not
to
cut
and
preserve
market
share
this
is
the
question
that
saudi
arabia
is
facing
ahead
of
this
year
s
december
opec
meeting
it
seems
like
just
yesterday
when
opec
met
in
and
decided
to
cut
production
by
million
barrels
daily
including
from
russia
to
reverse
the
free
fall
of
oil
prices
at
the
time
it
worked
because
everyone
was
desperate
now
many
opec
members
are
both
desperate
while
not
yet
recovered
from
the
blow
saudi
arabia
is
not
an
recent
report
from
capital
economics
said
saudi
arabia
has
its
problems
but
it
could
withstand
lower
oil
prices
without
feeling
too
much
of
a
pinch
even
if
brent
prices
fall
further
to
a
barrel
immediate
balance
of
payments
strains
are
unlikely
to
emerge
the
report
said
with
its
authors
adding
the
kingdom
would
be
able
to
finance
its
trade
deficit
from
its
foreign
exchange
reserves
for
at
least
a
this
suggestion
is
not
universally
accepted
reuters
john
kemp
this
week
offered
a
different
perspective
in
his
regular
column
on
oil
noting
saudi
arabia
s
foreign
exchange
reserves
currently
stand
at
us
billion
down
from
nearly
us
billion
in
when
the
oil
prices
slumped
under
the
weight
of
shale
oil
at
the
same
time
saudi
arabia
is
in
a
major
push
to
diversify
its
revenue
streams
and
has
committed
a
lot
of
money
to
kemp
wrote
the
kingdom
probably
needs
to
keep
several
hundred
billion
dollars
worth
of
reserve
assets
on
hand
to
maintain
confidence
in
its
fixed
peg
to
the
dollar
and
prevent
a
run
on
the
it
s
a
classic
rock
and
a
hard
place
situation
for
the
saudis
on
the
one
hand
they
could
continue
pumping
at
the
current
record
rate
or
close
to
it
pressuring
prices
further
which
is
what
they
did
in
that
strategy
hurt
shale
substantially
but
the
attempted
assault
did
not
go
quite
as
planned
now
it
will
once
again
hurt
shale
but
again
it
won
t
beat
the
resilience
of
the
us
shale
patch
that
much
should
have
become
clear
in
the
past

saudi
oil
output

the
other
hand
saudi
arabia
could
start
cutting
but
it
will
need
to
convince
all
other
opec
members
to
join
the
cuts
and
more
importantly
russia
reuters
earlier
today
reported
quoting
unnamed
sources
that
russia
had
accepted
the
need
to
cut
production
and
prices
immediately
jumped
once
again
highlighting
how
important
the
arabia
cooperation
has
become
for
oil
markets
if
it
even
needs
now
it
seems
like
a
cut
is
the
more
likely
outcome
in
spite
of
reservations
expressed
by
nigeria
and
libya
if
saudi
arabia
managed
to
convince
everyone
to
cut
amid
the
major
tensions
with
iran
ahead
of
the
sanctions
then
it
could
probably
convince
them
again
if
only
on
the
grounds
that
if
they
don
t
start
cutting
all
will
agrees
saudi
arabia
can
not
afford
another
slump
in
oil
prices
he
warns
it
needs
to
keep
revenues
high
to
help
its
economy
climb
out
of
recession
and
finance
ambitious
social
and
economic
transformation
yet
the
kingdom
is
preparing
kpler
reported
this
week
loadings
of
saudi
crude
since
the
start
of
november
had
reached
new
highs
of
million
bpd
which
was
bpd
more
than
the
average
daily
loadings
rate
for
october
and
much
higher
than
the
last
high
of
million
bpd
booked
for
june
the
bulk
of
the
increase
comes
from
china
with
shipments
in
that
direction
up
by
more
than
half
a
million
barrels
daily
in
november
from
october
production
is
also
at
record
highs
like
russia
s
was
ahead
of
the
first
cuts
in
perhaps
we
are
seeing
a
lesson
learned
there
or
perhaps
the
kingdom
is
out
