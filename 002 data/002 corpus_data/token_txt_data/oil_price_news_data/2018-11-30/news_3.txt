shale drillers may cut capex as oil falls to $50

largely
considered

the
minimum

at
which
most
drillers
have
been
budgeting
spending
plans
over
the
past
year
or
producers
across
the
shale
patch
will
be
announcing
spending
plans
alongside
earnings
releases
at

early
february
but
signs
have
already
started
to
emerge
that
the
shale
patch
will
be
cutting
budgets
for
spending
plans
for
next
year
may
be
the
first
budgets
cut
across
the
industry
since
the
oil
price
crash
of
according
to
data
compiled
by
bloomberg
two
months
ago
oil
was
not
the
scenario
at
which
companies
planned
and
few
had
expected
such
a
steep
price
correction
now
exploration
and
production
had
just
started
to
report
rising
cash
flows
and
to
finally
reward
shareholders
with
buybacks
and
increased
themselves
in
a
position
to
choose
from
where
to
cut
spending
next
year
considering
that
a
prolonged
period
of
oil
would
eat
into
cash
flows
and
undermine
previous
cash
generation
