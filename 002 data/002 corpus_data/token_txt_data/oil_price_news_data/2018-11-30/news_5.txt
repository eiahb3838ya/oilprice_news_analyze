new breakthrough will change how oil reserves are measured
a
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
team
of
researchers
has
taken
the
first
images
of
kerogen
s
internal
structure
with
a
level
of
detail
more
than
times
greater
than
has
been
previously
achieved
the
images
should
allow
more
accurate
predictions
of
how
much
oil
or
gas
can
be
recovered
from
any
given
fossil
fuels
that
provide
much
of
the
world
s
energy
originate
in
a
type
of
rock
known
as
kerogen
and
the
potential
for
recovering
these
fuels
depends
crucially
on
the
size
and
connectedness
of
the
rocks

but
this
wouldn
t
change
the
capability
for
recovering
these
fuels
but
it
could
for
example
lead
to
better
estimates
of
the
recoverable
reserves
of
natural
gas
which
is
seen
as
an
important
transition
fuel
as
the
world
tries
to
curb
the
use
of
coal
and
findings
have
been
published
in

of

on
computer

used
a
relatively
new
method
called
electron

to
produce
the
new
images
which
have
a
resolution
of
less
than
nanometer

fuels
as

suggests

when
organic
matter
such
as
dead

gets
buried
and
mixed
with
silt
as
these
materials
get
buried
deeper
over
millions
of
years
the
mix
gets
cooked
into
a
mineral

with
a

of

a
slow

involves
cooking
oxygen
and

and
at
the
end
you
get
a
piece
of
charcoal
pellenq
explains
but
in
between
you
get
this
whole
gradation
of
molecules
many
of
them
useful

and

new
results
show
for
the
first
time
a
dramatic
difference
in
the
nanostructure
of
kerogen
depending
on
its
age
relatively
immature
kerogen
whose
actual
age
depends
of
the
combination
of
temperatures
and
pressures
it
has
been
subjected
to
tends
to
have
much
larger
pores
but
almost
no
connections
among
those
pores
making
it
much
harder
to
extract
the
fuel
mature
kerogen
by
contrast
tends
to
have
much
tinier
pores
but
these
are
in
a
network
that
allow
the
gas
or
oil
to
flow
easily
making
much
more
of
it
recoverable
pellenq
study
also
reveals
that
the
typical
pore
sizes
in
these
formations
are
so
small
that
normal
hydrodynamic
equations
used
to
calculate
the
way
fluids
move
through
porous
materials
won
t
work
at
this
scale
the
material
is
in
such
close
contact
with
the
pore
walls
that
interactions
with
the
wall
dominate
its
behavior
the
research
team
thus
had
to
develop
new
ways
of
calculating
the
flow
there
s
no
fluid
dynamics
equation
that
works
in
these
subnanoscale
pores
he
said
no
continuum
physics
works
at
that
to
get
these
detailed
images
of
the
structure
the
team
used
electron
tomography
in
which
a
small
sample
of
the
material
is
rotated
within
the
microscope
as
a
beam
of
electrons
probes
the
structure
to
provide
at
one
angle
after
another
these
are
then
combined
to
produce
a
full
reconstruction
of
the
pore
structure
while
scientists
had
been
using
the
technique
for
a
few
years
they
hadn
t
applied
it
to
kerogen
structures
until
now
the
imaging
was
carried
out
at
the
cinam
lab
of
cnrs
and
amu
in
france
in
the
group
of
daniel
ferry
as
part
of
a
collaboration
with
multiscale
materials
science
for
energy
and
environment
the
joint
lab
located
at
oil
puts
shale
to
the
test
with
this
new
nanoscale
tomography
we
can
see
where
the
hydrocarbon
molecules
are
actually
sitting
inside
the
rock
pellenq
said
once
they
obtained
the
images
the
researchers
were
able
to
use
them
together
with
molecular
models
of
the
structure
to
improve
the
fidelity
of
their
simulations
and
calculations
of
flow
rates
and
mechanical
properties
this
could
shed
light
on
how
production
rates
decline
in
oil
and
gas
wells
and
perhaps
on
how
to
slow
that
far
the
team
has
studied
samples
from
three
different
kerogen
locations
and
found
a
strong
correlation
between
the
maturity
of
the
formation
and
its
pore
size
distribution
and
pore
void
connectivity
the
researchers
now
hope
to
expand
the
study
to
many
more
sites
and
to
derive
a
robust
formula
for
predicting
pore
structure
based
on
a
given
site
s
is
highly
interesting
work
of
all
the
oil
and
gas
discovered
so
far
less
than
half
has
been
recovered
and
marketed
those
reservoirs
are
found
infrastructure
installed
and
connected
to
markets
secondary
and
tertiary
recovery
are
already
very
big
businesses
one
has
to
wonder
if
the
big
private
petroleum
firms
may
or
may
not
be
at
this
point
or
beyond
these
firms
hire
the
best
petroleum
engineers
in
the
world
and
petroleum
engineers
are
all
very
bright
folks
the
research
is
offering
out
in
the
open
real
basic
information
