wall street’s favorite shale stocks
caution
capital
discipline
cash
flow
shareholder
returns
these
buzzwords
are
thrown
around
a
lot
these
days
much
more
so
than
details
about
aggressive
production
growth
after
years
of
a
shale

drillers
are
under
intense
pressure
to
only
spend
within
their
means
for
years
investors
and
shareholders
have
been
demanding
prudence
from
shale
companies
rather
than
but
over
the
past
year
the
changes
have
finally
become
visible
in
the
shale
profits
have
been
elusive
but
the
industry
could
post
positive
cash
flow

is
still
in
love
with
the
shale
industry
at
least
not
the
way
it
used
to
be
after
getting
burned
by
shale
drillers
for
years
major
investors
are
now
demanding
returns
on
investment

there

now
a
body
of

suggest
that
the
investors
rather
than
shale

are
increasingly
in
control
the
