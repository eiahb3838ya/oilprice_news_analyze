iraq approves oil production capacity boost
baghdad
has
approved
an
increase
in
iraq
s
crude
oil
production
capacity
to
as
much
as
million
bpd
by
this
compares
to
a
current
production
capacity
of
below
million
barrels
and
production
reported
by
the
local
energy
around
million
bpd
as
per
its
opec
oil
export
income
accounts
for
the
bulk
of
government
revenues
and
is
likely
to
continue
to
do
so
for
the
observable
future
as
diversification
options
are
few
and
the
funds
needed
for
a
shift
away
from
oil
can
only
come
from
huge
dependence
on
crude
revenues
has
made
iraq
the
focus
of
doubts
around
compliance
with
the
production
cut
deal
with
many
expecting
that
the
cartel
s
producer
will
be
the
first
to
start
iraq
has
fallen
consistently
short
of
complying
with
its
quota
of
million
bpd
but
its
underperformance
has
been
more
than
offset
by
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
iraq
was
also
the
hardest
opec
member
to
convince
that
the
cuts
were
necessary
now
the
country
is
in
line
apparently
sticking
to
whatever
opec
decides
in
terms
of
further
extensions
of
the
deal
at
the
same

however
it
is
planning
a
tender

new

minister
jabbar
recently
told
media
that
iraq
s
proven
crude
oil
reserves
could
be
much
higher
than
previously
estimated
last
year
iraq
updated
the
estimate
for
its
proven
reserves
to
billion
barrels
from
billion

if
luiebi

iraq
the
