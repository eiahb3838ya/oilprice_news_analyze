the bakken is booming once again
the
permian
has
been
stealing
headlines
and
analyst
attention
over
the
past
year
and
rightly
so
as
it
s
the
only
shale
play
that
continued
to
grow
even
when
all
others
suffered
during
the
higher
oil
prices
over
the
past
few
months
have
prompted
drillers
to
grow
production
not
only
in
the
permian
but
also
in
the
older
and
more
developed
plays
such
as
the
bakken
in
north
dakota
and
bakken
crude
oil
production
has
started
to
grow
again
and
is
expected
to
beat
in
the
first
half
of
its
own
production
record
of
million
bpd
from
december
bakken
was
one
of
the
first
shale
basins
in
which
drillers
started
to
pump
oil
via
fracking
its
advantage
is
that
the
geology
is
better
known
than
that
of
the
permian
its
disadvantage
compared
to
the
permian
is
that
its
sweetest
spots
may
have
already
been
pumped
out
another
disadvantage
is
that
the
bakken
has
higher
breakevens
than
the
top
areas
in
the
permian
making
its
production
more
susceptible
to
oil
price
the
bakken
oil
production
is
currently
rising
although
the
growth
is
overshadowed
by
the
permian
number
of
active
drilling
rigs
in
north
dakota
is
currently
at
data
by
the
north
dakota
industrial
commission
shows
this
is
way
below
the
active
rigs
in
early
april
but

rigs

said
in

in

that
even

oil
price
environment
us
oil
growth
will
be
more
tepid
than
most
people
are
the
primary
reason
for
his
prediction
is
the

quality
