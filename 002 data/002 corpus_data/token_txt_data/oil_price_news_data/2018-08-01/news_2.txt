kuwait oil production hits 18-month high
kuwait
is
pumping
crude
at
a
daily
rate
of
million
barrels
the
most
since
december
the
country
s
oil
minister
bakheet
said
today
as
quoted
by
s
p
platts
this
is
bpd
more
than
kuwait
s
june
daily
production
and
the
figure
highlights
the
difficulties
the
cartel
faces
in
boosting
production
quickly
enough
to
rein
in
prices
opec
s
total
as
estimated
by
analysts
only
rose
by
bpd
in
opec
ramps
up
production
in
response
to
vocal
disgruntlement
with
oil
prices
kuwait
and
saudi
arabia
are
preparing
to
restart
production
in
the
neutral
zone
which
could
bring
another
half
a
million
barrels
daily
to
global
supply
the
restart
will
likely
take
place
no
sooner
than
the
minister
said
that
the
oil
market
is
approaching
stability
this
is
something
the
market
was
supposed
to
have
done
earlier
this
year
before
it
turned
out
those
price
levels
were
not
exactly
optimal
for
things
have
changed
it
is
clear
today
based
on
the
current
level
of
production
that
we
are
approaching
a
very
stable
stage
whether
for
the
consumers
or
the
producers
said
as
quoted
by
is
not
stopping
at
current
production
rates
either
the
division
of
the
country
s
oil
company
kufpec
has
borrowed
us
billion
to
develop
shale
oil
resources
abroad
notably
in
s
current
daily
production
stands
at
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
but
the
company
aims
to
raise
this
to
in
september
and
further
to
bpd
in
in
canada
kufpec
pumps
just
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
daily
but
plans
to
expand
this
significantly
after
the
drilling
of
more
wells
in
the
alberta
shale
s
total
production
capacity
currently
stands
at
million
barrels
of
crude
from
wholly
owned
fields
but
plans
are
to
boost
this
to
million
