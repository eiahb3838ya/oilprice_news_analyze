percent
over
the

month
while
the

gained
the
past
few
months
much
of
the
rally
in
futures
prices
has
been
driven
by
geopolitical
concerns
of
possible
supply
disruptions
in
the
short

with
plunging
venezuelan
production
and
a

the

we
all
see
in
the
to
analysts
and
traders
who
spoke
to
bloomberg
the
forward
price
rally
is
more
impressive
than
the
price
gains
and
suggests
that
investors
and
speculators
could
be
betting
on
higher
oil
prices
in
five
years
time
based
on
supply
and
demand
the
war
premium
at
the
front
of
the
market
masked
the
fact
that
future
significant
demand
increases
and
questions
over
supply
levels
equate
to
higher
