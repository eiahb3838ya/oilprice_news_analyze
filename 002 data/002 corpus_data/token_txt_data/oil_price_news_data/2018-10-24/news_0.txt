oil under threat as global economy struggles
warning
signs
about
the
slowing
of
the
global
economy
continue
to
crop
up
and
market
jitters
are
taking
the
steam
out
of
oil
corporate
earnings
are
no
longer
with
a
range
of
factors
starting
to
cut
into
margins
the
trade
war
has
not
made
headlines
in
the
same
way
it
did
a
few
weeks
and
months
ago
but
the
reality
is
that
the
impact
of
tariffs
is
only
growing
as
costs
work
their
way
through
supply
these
trade
tensions
are
coming
home
to
roost
and
they
are
impacting
the
fundamentals
of
the
market
tally

strategist
at

told
reuters
thanks
to
trade
tariffs
we
are
facing
the
headwinds
of
a
stronger
dollar
higher
oil
prices
and
rising
interest
this
week
a
slew
of
disappointing
earnings
came
in

said
that
tariffs
cost
the
company
million
in
the
third
quarter
and
its
share
price
fell
roughly
percent
after
it
reported
its
figures
poor
figures
also
came
from
and
prompting
selloffs
in
their
stocks
as
well
said
that
tariffs
could
cost
the
company
million
this
year
a
figure
that
will
balloon
to
million
next
year
the
results
spooked
the
markets
dragging
down
equities
more
broadly
the
s
p
machinery
index
was
down
more
than
percent
in
the
last
two
of
a
slowdown
in
china
is
also
becoming
apparent
saw
sales
dip
in
china
as
did
ppg
industries
which
makes
paint
and
coatings
we
see
other
signs
of
slowing
in
china
the
automotive
build
rates
are
down
significantly
and
that
has
a
effect
michael
roman
ceo
of
said
sales
of
cars
in
china
fell
percent
in
september
from
a
year
strong
dollar
is
another
source
of
trouble
for
the
global
economy
said
that
international
sales
of
its
motorcycles
were
hit
by
a
strong
greenback
the
federal
reserve
has
hiked
interest
rates
multiple
times
in
the
last
year
and
is
expected
to
continue
on
that
oil
steady
despite
major
crude
buildthe
array
of
problems
raise
the
prospect
of
peak
industrial
earnings
strong
gdp
figures
and
a
massive
corporate
tax
cut
temporarily
juiced
profits
and
earnings
could
fall
to
more
pedestrian
levels
particularly
as
costs
start
to
creep
up
some
analysts
think
the
fears
of
weaker
earnings
are
overblown
but
investors
have
clearly
grown
worried
about
the
trajectory
of
the
economy
and
it
has
been
the
that
has
stood
out
while
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
already
began
to
lose
steam
the
can
not
defy
gravity
housing
market
is
also
starting
to
flash
warning
signs
for
the
week
ending
on
october
the
volume
of
mortgage
applications
fell
by
percent
higher
interest
rates
are
clearly
being
felt
in
housing
pushing
homes
out
of

some
prospective
trump
recognizes
the
political
threat
he
faces
if
interest
rate
hikes
spoil
the
party
every
time
we
do
something
great
he
raises
the
interest
rates
trump
said
of
fed
chairman
jerome
powell
in
an
interview
with
the
wall
street
journal
on
tuesday
he
almost
looks
like
he
s
happy
raising
interest
trump
added
that
it
was
too
early
to
say
but
maybe
he
regrets
nominating
powell
trump
complained
that
obama
had
zero
interest
the
economic
headwinds
are
deflating
the
oil
market
where
supply
tightness
has
dominated
attention
for
the
past
few
months
recently
however
some
of
the
supply
fears
have
eased
saudi
arabia
has
vowed
to
cover
any
supply
gap
should
it
emerge
inventories
continue
to
rise
the

in
iran
are
seem
to
be
less

amid

the
crude

action
yesterday
was
clearly
impacted
by
bearish
equity
markets
falling

rising

and
a
clear

adverse
sentiment
said
bjarne
schieldrop
chief
commodities
analyst
at
next
steps
are
unclear
there
will
be
a
tension
between
the
supply
losses
from
iran
which
will
serve
to
tighten
the
oil
market
and
the
supply
gains
from
shale
and
saudi
arabia
the
demand
side
is
decidedly
more
negative
