oil steady despite major crude build
a
day
after
the
american
petroleum
instituted
shook
oil
prices
lower
by
reporting
a
crude
oil
inventory
build
of
close
to
million
barrels
the
energy
information
administration
confirmed
a
build
but
a
lower
one
spurring
a
further
price
drop
in
oil
inventories
in
the
united
states
added
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
october
the
eia
said
after
a
build
of
million
barrels
a
week
earlier
at
million
barrels
the
eia
said
inventories
of
crude
are
some
percent
above
the
seasonal
inventories
were
down
by
million
barrels
last
week
while
distillate
inventories
dipped
by
million
that
as
it
may
the
eia
s
report
is
bound
to
affect
prices
amid
volatility
after
yesterday
west
texas
intermediate
ended
trading
with
a
loss
of
percent
the
largest
in
three
months
cnbc
reported
the
loss
was
prompted
as
much
by
a
stock
market
decline
as
by
assurances
from
riyadh
saudi
arabia
will
be
able
to
make
up
for
any
lost
oil
supply
from
iran
the
stock
market
fall
however
may
well
continue
in
the
coming
days
as
investors
heed
warnings
from
various
economic
research
authorities
about
a
slowdown
in
global
economic
growth
related
russia
s
oil
output
won
t
go
much
higherin
its
report
the
eia
also
said
refineries
processed
million
barrels
of
crude
daily
last
week
and
churned
out
million
bpd
of
gasoline
and
million
bpd
of
distillate
fuel
this
compares
with
the
same
processing
rate
of
million
bpd
for
the
week
prior
which
showed
gasoline
production
of
million
bpd
with
distillate
production
at
million
weekly
fuel
production
and
inventory
figures
from
eia
will
doubtless
also
be
in
the
focus
of
traders
attention
as
they
try
to
construct
a
reliable
picture
of
supply
in
a
key
market
such
as
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
updates
from
washington
regarding
iran
will
probably
trump
these
domestic
figures
in
favor
of
global
supply
latest
in
this
respect
was
a
statement
by
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
that
unlike
last
time
when
the
imposed
sanctions
on
iran
importers
of
iranian
crude
will
need
to
reduce
their
intake
by
more
than
percent
to
have
a
chance
at
scoring
a
waiver
with
the
irina
slav
