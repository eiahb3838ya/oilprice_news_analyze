the biggest oilmen of 2018
this
year
has
been
a
crazy
ride
for
the
oil
industry
which
saw
the
price
of
brent
crude
seesaw
from
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
to
a
high
of
in
early
october
back
to
in
precisely
back
to
where
we
then
closing
out
the
year
right
before
christmas
at
a
disappointing
typical
catalysts
such
as
inventory
and
capacity
affect
oil
prices
they
always
have
but
there
were
other
forces
at
play
in
that
significantly
influenced
the
price
of
oil
in
and
here
is
our
list
of
those
important
individuals
in
and
those
to
watch
for
birol
as
head
of
the
international
energy
agency
iea
fatih
birol
has
made
several
lists
in
years
past
of
influential
oil
figures
while
he
doesn
t
directly
control
production
inventory
prices
or
policy
his
regarding
oil
demand
or
production
forecasts
in
late
the
head
of
the
iea
went
further
than
offering
gloomy
oil
demand
figures
for
the
coming
year
issuing
warnings
to
the
world
s
largest
oil
producers
urging
them
not
to
cut
oil
output
and
warning
the
market
that
the
higher
oil
prices
heading
into
november
were
such
that
it
was
already
high
enough
to
dent
currently
markets
are
very
well
supplied
but
we
should
not
forget
that
spare
capacity
in
saudi
arabia
is
very
thin
therefore
cutting
the
production
significantly
today
by
key
oil
producers
may
have
some
negative
implications
for
the
markets
and
further
tightening
the
appeal
to
all
producers
and
consumers
across
the
world
is
to
have
common
sense
in
these
difficult
birol
november
prices
had
already
started
to
slide
leading
up
to
birol
s
plea
but
had
rallied
somewhat
the
four
days
prior
brent
stood
at
on
november
but
fell
sharply
to
by
the
next
day
as
speculators
latched
onto
fear
that
oil
demand
might
bin
salman
essentially
the
ruler
of
the
heavyweight
oil
producer
saudi
arabia
mohammed
bin
salman
has
exerted
over
the
oil
markets
his
pursuit
of
the
war
in
yemen
his
push
for
a
blockade
of
neighboring
qatar
his
attempt
to
diversify
the
saudi
economy
away
from
oil
vision
his
massive
corruption
crackdown
that
helped
to
solidify
his
power
and
implementing
a
trade
row
with
canada
his
single
biggest
influence
in
was
likely
his
push
to
extend
opec
s
production
largely
through
his
deepening
relationship
with
russian
president
vladimir
higher
prices
are
the
only
way
mbs
can
reap
higher
oil
prices
which
is
the
only
path
toward
continuing
his
costly
modernization
plans
for
the
kingdom
related
deal
not
enough
to
save
the
oil
market
we
are
working
to
shift
from
a
agreement
to
a
to
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
march
if
mbs
is
the
of
the
saudi
oil
world
is
the
often
a
more
visible
one
at
that
it
is
precisely
that
visibility
which
gives
the
power
to
sway
oil
prices
as
saudi
arabia
s
oil
minister
has
often
been
touted
as
the
world
s
largest
influencer
in
the
oil
markets
today
while
we
are
not
committed
to
giving
him
that
crown
this
year
is
certainly
in
the
top
five
influencers
his
mere
words
to
the
press
are
quoted
tweeted
cited
and
hung
on
by
every
single
oil
trader
in
the
world
and
like
mbs
his
ties
to
russia
which
went
a
long
way
towards
rallying
russia
to
join
in
the
opec
cut
extension
in
june
and
opec
cuts
in
november
which
will
start
in
further
saudi
arabia
under
s
guidance
curtailed
oil
exports
to
the
united
states
in
an
effort
to
manipulate
oil
inventories
in
the
thus
influence
the
price
of
oil
indirectly
by
changing
the
most
watched
and
most
transparent
oil
metric
in
the
inventories
as
reported
by
the
energy
information
administration
eia
and
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
like
others
on
this
list
such
as
alexander
novak
and
president
donald
trump
s
power
comes
mostly
from
his
his
words
have
sway
absent
even
of
any
real
policy
change
or
action
his
power
also
comes
largely
from
aramco
s
professed
ability
to
turn
on
and
off
its
taps
to
manipulate
oil
s
fundamentals
on
a
large
we
will
meet
any
demand
that
october
donald
trump
here
is
the
newest
player
on
the
world
s
most
prominent
catalyst
for
oil
price
swings
for
better
or
for
worse
love
him
or
hate
him
president
donald
trump
has
undeniably
changed
the
course
of
the
oil
industry
in
and
not
just
in
the
united
states
his
tweets
has
sent
oil
prices
falling
has
sent
opec
scrambling
and
has
sent
saudi
arabia
a
different
tune
to
may
staunchly
deny
that
president
trump
has
any
real
power
to
change
oil
prices
but
his
policy
the
biofuel
mandate
opening
up
offshore
drilling
his
sanctions
on
iran
that
went
into
effect
in
november
and
the
waivers
he
allowed
to
some
of
the
world
s
thirstiest
oil
had
a
profound
effect
not
just
on
market
sentiment
but
on
oil
s
fundamentals
as
well
but
perhaps
his
single
largest
influence
on
the
oil
market
as
his
tweets
which
have
in
caught
the
eye
of
every
speculator
his
tweets
particularly
those
that
chastised
opec
for
restricting
output
and
thus
manipulating
oil
prices
have
had
a
significant
and
even
immediate
effect
on
hopefully
opec
will
be
keeping
oil
flows
as
is
not
restricted
the
world
does
not
want
to
see
or
need
higher
oil
prices

now
definitively
in

nicolas
maduro
still
seems
bent
on
steering
his
shipwreck
of
a
country
right
off
a
colossal
waterfall
and
its
entire
oil
industry
along
with
it
because
the
country
is
home
to
the
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
the
fate
of
its
oil
industry
impacts
in
a
profound
way
the
entire
oil
industry
maduro
s
clanging
cymbal
of
promised
change
has
done
little
to
allay
fears
that
its
lost
production
will
translate
into
a
shortage
of
oil
elsewhere
but
venezuela
s
rapidly
declining
production
thanks
in
large
part
to
maduro
s
mismanagement
and
plundering
of
pdvsa
has
bolstered
oil
prices
by
tightening
supply
and
has
provided
some
relief
to
opec
as
they
struggled
throughout
to
meet
stringent
production
cut
quotas
despite
maduro
s
insistence
that
it
will
start
to

its
new
currency
el
petro
little
has
come
of
his
grand
khalifa
haftar
aka
gaddafi
has
been
a
year
of
fear
that
major
oil
producers
such
as
russia
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
would
not
be
able
to
compensate
for
production
losses
elsewhere
such
as
iran
venezuela
and
libya
granted
a
waiver
from
the
original
production
cut
agreement
that
opec
hashed
in
late
libya
was
watched
for
much
of
early
as
the
troubled
country
s
oil
production
ebbed
and
flowed
thanks
to
infighting
that
was
kept
in
check
for
the
most
part
singlehandedly
by
general
khalifa
putin
while
igor
sechin
may
be
head
of
russian
oil
giant
rosneft
putin
is
unquestionably
in
control
of
the
country
s
oil
policies
and
production
sechin
is
no
puppet
for
sure
but
is
still
dwarfed
by
putin
s
persona
from
deals
with
saudi
arabia
and
opec
to
curb
single
most
meaningful
metric
that
moved
markets
this
turkish
stream
and

putin
is
decidedly
affecting
oil
prices
along
with
and
president
donald

putin
s
quotes
in
the
media
have
sway
related
ubs
expect
brent
next
year
president
trump
has
said
he
thinks
the
oil
price
is
too
high
well
probably
to
some
extent
he
s
right
but
let
s
be
frank
such
oil
prices
are
to
some
extent
the
result
of
the
administration
vladimir
putin
october
sechin
known
to
some
as
the
darth
vader
of
russia
and
arguably
the
second
most
influential
man
in
russia
after
putin
sechin
has
dispensed
with
his
competition
when
it
suited
him
to
do
so
bashneft
yukos
with
this
history
in
mind
sechin
leads
and
others
follow
some
in
russia
might
consider
sechin
a
more
powerful
figure
than
putin
and
claim
that
rosneft
s
rise
is
attributed
to
sechin
s
ruthless
musk
musk
perhaps
would
shudder
to
find
himself
on
a
list
of
prominent
oilmen
but
this
year
s
list
of
powerful
oilmen
would
not
be
complete
without
at
least
mentioning
musk
s
significant
impact
on
the
oil
industry
his
quest
to
put
evs
in
the
forefront
of
the
world
s
mind
has
without
question
pushed
other
auto
manufacturers
to
develop
evs
of
their
own
and
at
a
quickened
pace
than
what
would
otherwise
have
been
this
push
to
get
more
evs
on
the
road
and
the
desire
of
other
manufacturers
to
not
be
left
behind
has
sparked
concern
in
the
oil
industry
that
its
days
are
mentionsthe
last
three
on
our
list
are
honorable
mentions
but
their
influence
should
not
be
downplayed
their
policies
have
undoubtedly
affected
the
markets
but
perhaps
with
not
as
much
fanfare
as
those
in
our
list
jinping
china
is
at
the
heart
of
the
world
s
oil
demand
and
xi
jinping
s
decision
to
not
issue
any
more
solar
power
installations
tariffs
and
to
cut
the
tariff
subsidy
has
affected
oil
demand
in
the
country
by
shifting
its
energy
demand
away
from
solar
and
towards
oil
and
natural
canada
s
prime
minister
justin
trudeau
created
nearly
a
disaster
of
monumental
proportions
in
canada
s
oil
industry
by
not
backing

with
enough

this
lack
of

created

of

novak
this
is
our
third
russian
on
the
list
and
his
power
as
russia
s
energy
minister
mostly
consists
of
words
spoken
to
the
press
his
alleged
bromance
with
saudi
counterpart
khalid
that
helped
to
solidify
cooperation
between
two
of
the
three
largest
oil
producers
in
the
world
has
led
to
an
alliance
that
is
one
for
the
history
books

russia

with
opec
in

production
