non-opec oil output soars despite price slide
crude
oil
production
outside
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
is
set
for
more
this
year
and
next
according
to
the
latest
monthly
report
of
the
production
alone
estimated
to
have
hit
million
bpd
earlier
this
month
as
per
figures
from
the
energy
information
administration
it
s
no
wonder
opec
sees
the
united
states
as
the
biggest
driver
behind
supply
growth
which
it
sees
this
year
at
million
bpd
this
is
bpd
more
than
what
opec
forecast
a
month
earlier
and
will
be
also
helped
by
higher
production
in
canada
russia
and
the
united
states
alone
opec
forecasts
daily
supply
to
reach
million
barrels
this
year
rising
considerably
in
as
well
to
million
bpd
this
year
opec
sees
production
growing
by
million
bps
from
and
further
by
million
bpd
in
it
is
worth
noting
however
that
these
figures
include
not
just
crude
oil
but
also
natural
gas
crude
oil
alone
opec
expects
producers
to
boost
output
to
million
bpd
in
the
last
quarter
of
and
continue
ramping
up
production
until
it
hits
million
bpd
at
the
end
of
to
these
developments
oil
production
outside
opec
will
reach
million
bpd
this
year
growing
further
to
million
bpd
in
that
would
represent
a
growth
rate
of
million
bpd
for
from
an
upward
revision
by
a
considerable
bpd
from
opec
s
october
monthly
oil
market
this
context
then
it
is
no
surprise
opec
officials
notably
saudi
arabia
s
khalid
have
started
to
talk
about
production
cuts
again
for
fear
of
another
glut
like
the
one
that
dragged
prices
below
us
a
barrel
four
years
ago
whether
importers
would
be
on
board
with
this
however
is
