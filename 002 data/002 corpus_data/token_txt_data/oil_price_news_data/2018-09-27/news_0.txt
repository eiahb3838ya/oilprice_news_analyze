why a u.s. spr release would not matter
the
decision
by
to
essentially
let
brent
crude
rise
above
per
barrel
a
high
was
met
with
outrage
by
president
trump
at
the
un
general
assembly
he
denounced
opec
and
opec
nations
are
as
usual
ripping
off
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
don
t
like
it
nobody
should
like
it
we
defend
many
of
these
nations
for
nothing
and
then
they
take
advantage
of
us
by
giving
us
high
oil
prices
not
good
trump
said
we
want
them
to
stop
raising
prices
we
want
them
to
start
lowering
prices
and
they
must
contribute
substantially
to
military
protection
from
now
on
we
are
not
going
to
put
up
with
it
these
horrible
prices
much
it
is
unclear
what
he
meant
by
that
last
sentence
he
would
seem
to
either
being
threatening
some
retaliation
against
opec
members
for
not
increasing
production
or
perhaps
he
was
threatening
to
do
something
to
try
to
lower
oil
prices
there
is
little
the
government
can
do
to
promote
even
faster
domestic
production
as
production
decisions
are
made
at
the
company
only
thing
the
trump
administration
can
do
is
to
release
oil
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
the
rebuff
by
to
trump
led
to
some
analysts
to
expect
a
release
from
the
spr
particularly
since
elections
are
quickly
approaching
and
voters
are
experiencing
retail
gasoline
prices
close
to
highs
average
retail
gasoline
prices
nationwide
rose
to
per
gallon
for
the
week
ending
on
september
according
to
the
if
opec
does
not
wish
to
jeopardise
its
independence
it
will
hardly
be
able
to
respond
to
trump
s
latest
remarks
by
raising
output
commerzbank
wrote
in
a
note
so
trump
s
only
real
option
is
to
release
strategic
reserves
in
order
to
drive
prices
down
ahead
of
the
congressional
related
traders
turn
bullish
ahead
of
iran
sanctions
there
s
a
strong
possibility
of
another
strategic
reserve
release
said
antoine
halff
head
of
the
global
oil
market
program
at
columbia
university
s
center
on
global
energy
policy
according
to
bloomberg
it
s
a
wild
card
that
justifies
close
attention
for
the
next
few
bloomberg
also
reported
that
industry
executives
openly
speculated
about
when
trump
might
tap
the
reserve
at
the
annual
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
appec
in
singapore
this
secretary
of
energy
rick
perry
dismissed
these
rumors
he
told
reporters
that
any
sale
would
have
a
fairly
minor
and
impact
and
he
trusted
that
the
oil
market
would
be
fine
as
opec
and
russia
would
fill
any
potential
s
right
on
the
first
point
even
if
the
moved
to
sell
more
oil
from
the
spr
it
would
only
have
a
limited
and
temporary
impact
citi
s
ed
morse
said
it
could
lower
prices
by
a
few
dollars
per
barrel
but
oil
traders
would
know
that
any
sale
is
temporary
mike
muller
an
executive
at
vitol
group
told
bloomberg
that
the
market
may
even
interpret
a
release
as
a
bullish
sign
since
it
would
reduce
the
supply
cushion
that
major
producers
could
call
upon
for
future
any
event
the
use
of
the
spr
as
a
political
tool
may
not
be
all
that
effective
because
it
s
probably
too
late
there
is
a
lag
between
changes
in
global
crude
oil
prices
and
the
price
of
gasoline
at
the
pump
so
even
if
an
spr
release
were
to
occur
tomorrow
motorists
likely
wouldn
t
see
the
effect
until
after
the
elections
related
opec
vows
to
boost
spare
oil
capacitystill
the
political
cost
of
unloading
oil
from
the
spr
is
not
what
it
once
was
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
the
government
was
extremely
protective
over
the
spr
and
very
cautious
about
dipping
into
it
however
the
shale
revolution
has
created
the
semblance
or
illusion
of
abundance
and
the
congress
has
already
begun
legislating
sales
of
the
spr
for
budgetary
reasons
top
policymakers
have
all
but
given
up
on
the
massive
spr
as
a
tool
for
energy
policy
and
energy
security
the
congress
has
already
legislated
sales
of
oil
from
the
spr
spread
out
over
the
next
decade
the
upcoming
sale
of
million
barrels
in
october
and
november
is
part
of
other
words
there
is
no
longer
a
political
cost
for
the
trump
administration
if
it
were
to
decide
to
take
an
aggressive
route
and
sell
large
volumes
of
oil
from
the
spr
above
what
is
already
now
sec
perry
insists
that
is
not
in
the
cards
and
because
iranian
supply
will
continue
to
fall
in
the
weeks
and
months
ahead
oil
could
be
heading
higher
as
a
result
the
talk
is
now
brent
reaching
a
barrel
in
the
future
