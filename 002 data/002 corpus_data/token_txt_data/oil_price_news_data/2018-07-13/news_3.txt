should
supply
disruptions
in
venezuela
and
libya
lead
to
a
deficit
on
the
oil
market
opec
and
its
partners
will
act
to
ensure
enough
supply
russia
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
on
above
and
beyond
the
increase
that
the
parties
agreed
to
in
month
russia
and
opec
s
largest
producer
and
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
managed
to
get
opec
and
their
allies
to
agree
to
boost
production
by
unspecified
quotas
for
individual
countries
part
of
the
pact
to
ease
market
and
consumer
anxiety
over
the
high
oil
prices
according
to
novak
russia
s
share
of
the
total
increase
could
be
around
bpd
speaking
to
reporters
in
moscow
today
novak
said
that
i
can
t
rule
out
that
if
there
is
a
need
for
more
than
million
barrels
we
will
be
able
to
quickly
discuss
it
all
together
and
make
all
necessary
the
oil
producers
have
all
needed
tools
if
there
is
a
need
novak
said
as
quoted
by
and
saudi
arabia
have
both
started
to
increase
their
crude
oil
production
even
before
the
meeting
on
june
to
opec
s
secondary
sources
the
ones
the
cartel
uses
to
calculate
quotas
and
compliance
saudi
arabia
s
oil
production
jumped
in
june
by
bpd
compared
to
may
to
reach
million
the
downside
risk
for
oilrussia
for
its
part
is
said
to
have
pumped
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
the
first
four
days
of
july
up
from
million
bpd
in
june
the
intention
to
cut
as
many
iranian
oil
exports
as
possible
the
unstoppable
venezuelan
production
plunge
and
in
recent
weeks
closed
oil
ports
in
libya
have
added
more
concern
about
the
supply
disruptions
since
the
opec
meeting
on
june
the
problem
with
increased
production
by
saudi
arabia
its
persian
gulf
allies
and
much
the
only
members
able
to
significantly
raise
that
global
spare
capacity
is
thinning
and
could
drop
uncomfortably
low
to
meet
additional
supply
this
will
become
an
even
bigger
issue
as
rising
production
from
middle
east
gulf
countries
and
russia
welcome
though
it
is
comes
at
the
expense
of
the
world
s
spare
capacity
cushion
which
might
be
stretched
to
the
limit
