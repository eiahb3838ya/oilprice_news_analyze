iraq set to boost oil output after bai hassan restart
satellite
surveillance
shows
that
production
has
fully
resumed
at
the
bai
hassan
field
in
iraq
the
field
is
part
of
a
complex
of
oilfields
in
northern
iraq
that
were
shut
down
after
the
kurdistan
regional
government
krg
unilaterally
voted
for
independence
from
baghdad
causing
iraqi
troops
to
move
in
on
the
kirkuk
area
under
its
control
while
there
were
reports
of
the
field
resuming
production
at
the
end
of
june

satellite
surveillance
shows
it
did
not
achieve
normal
operations
until
july
disruptions
at
the
bai
hassan
field
accounted
for
most
of
the
lost
barrels
in
iraq
s
kirkuk
producing
region
as
monitored
by
kayrros
now
that
the
fields
are
returning
to
normal
operation
that
loss
which
had
already
been
offset
by
higher
output
from
the
south
of
iraq
should
drop
drastically
the
recovery
will
likely
enable
baghdad
to
participate
in
the
supply
hike
agreed
by
opec
in
june
offsetting
any
lost
iranian
barrels
as
may
result
from
washington
s
recent
move
to
leave
the
nuclear
deal
between
iran
and
the
and
reimpose
oil
sanctions
on
at
the
field
under
krg
management
averaged
in
a
time
when
tensions
in
the
region
ran
particularly
high
the
kurdish
peshmerga
forces
had
to
stop
the
isis
insurgency
from
taking
control
of
the
field
or
setting
it
ablaze
again
which
hampered
production
fighting
around
the
field
restricted
the
flow
of
oil
making
it
difficult
for
the
krg
to
maintain

iraq
created
a

source
of

that

the
oil
fields
shortly
after
the
kurdish

coincided
with
the
iraqi
prime

recent
announcement
that
the
country
would
participate
in
opec
s
plan
to
boost
output
starting
in

the
june

not
spell
out
the
volume
of
the

speaking
only
of
a
return
to
conformity
with
the
previously

ceiling
participating

had
overshot
that

by
approximately
million

was
exempt
from
its

to

under
