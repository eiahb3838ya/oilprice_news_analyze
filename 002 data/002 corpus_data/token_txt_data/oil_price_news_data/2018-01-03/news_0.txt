what’s behind the canadian rig count crash
the
rig
count
has
been
on
the
rise
for
months
despite
some
recent
hiccups
but
canada
s
rig
count
recently
plunged
amid
low
oil
s
rig
count
fell
from
to
for
the
week
ending
on
december
a
massive
drop
off
that
took
the
rig
count
to
a
low
obviously
the
losses
were
concentrated
in
alberta
where
most
of
the
rigs
tend
to
be
alberta
s
rig
count
sank
from
to
in
the
last
week
of
but
saskatchewan
also
saw
its
rig
count
from
in
to
just
three
at
the
close
of
the
year
the
losses
can
likely
be
chalked
up
to
the
meltdown
in
prices
for
canadian
oil
western

select

a
benchmark
that
tracks
heavy
oil
in
canada
often
trades
at
a
significant
discount
to
oil
prices
in
the
united
states
but
the
discount
became
unusually
large
in
november
and
december
for
a
variety
of
reasons
the
outage
at
the
keystone
pipeline
led
to
a
rapid
buildup
in
oil
inventories
in
canada
and
storage
hit
a
record
high
in
canada
s
oil
industry
has
been
unable
to
build
new
pipelines
to
get
the
landlocked
oil
from
alberta
to
market
alberta
oil
producers
are
essentially
hostage
to
their
buyers
in
the
and
with
oil
production
now
bumping
up
against
a
ceiling
in
terms
of
pipeline
capacity
the
glut
is
starting
to
weigh
on
wcs
december
enbridge
announced
that
it
will
ration
the
space
on
its
mainline
oil
pipeline
system
for
january
as
canada
s
pipelines
are
essentially
at
full
capacity
enbridge
said
that
it
will
apportion
lines
and
which
move
heavy
crude
by
percent
the
term
apportionment
is
a
euphemism
for
oil
producers
are
unable
to
get
all
of
their
product
onto
the
pipeline
and
are
hit
with
restrictions
that
means
the
oil
has
to
be
diverted
into
storage

in

there
s
somewhat
of
a
glut
of
supply
in
canada
right
now
the
problem
is
that
there
s
little
prospect
of
a
solution
in
the
railroads
although
they
are
taking
incrementally
more
cargoes
can
not
handle
the
excess
supply
all
on
their
own
especially
with
new
supply
coming
online
and
there
are
no
serious
pipeline

about
two

it
makes
little
sense
to
greenlight
new
upstream
projects
particularly
in
expensive

but
there
are
still
some
projects
that
are
finishing
up

were
given
the
years
ago

were
substantially

project

which
will
add
nearly

of
new

within
all
means
that
the
pressure
on
wcs
probably
won
t
go
away
the
price
meltdown
from
two
months
ago
is
probably
now
showing
up
in
the
rig
count
the
typically
sees
the
rig
count
fluctuate
in
response
to
changes
in
the
oil
price
by
several
months
and
the
rig
count
in
canada
will
only
now
start
to
reflect
the
price
plunge
from
months
ago
the
rail
industry
might
handle
more
oil
cargoes
which
could
help
push
up

a
bit

the

persist

add

markit
recently
studied
several
scenarios
for
canada
s
oil
industry
including
upgrading
existing
refineries
to
process
heavy
oil
into
a
lighter
synthetic
form
of
oil
as
well
as
building
entirely
new
refineries
ihs
markit
concluded
that
there
is
an
opportunity
to
convert
existing
refineries
but
that
the
abundance
of
light
oil
supply
in
north
america
could
challenge
the
economics
new
refining
capacity
is
a
risk
in
any
event
refined
products
and
lighter
oil
would
still
need
to
be
exported

canada
s

faces
more
obstacles

the

is
closely
tracked
around
the

for

into
what
happens
next
in
the

is
assumed
to
mean
that
more

will
be
forthcoming
while
a
decrease
is
a
sign
of
market
tightness
and
potentially
higher

on
the
other

could
continue
to
struggle
even
as
shale

spring
into
action
in
response
to
higher

canadian
producers
won
t
benefit
as
much
from
the
upswing
in
the

market
due
to
their
local
and
regional
problems

related
