how much does opec need to cut to balance the market?
opec
will
probably
agree
to
cut
production
to
the
tune
of
between
and
million
bpd
analyst
johannes
benigni
from
austrian
jbc
energy
group
told
cnbc
adding
there
was
clearly
a
glut
on
global
oil
markets
at
the
moment
and
such
a
cut
would
likely
help
the
market
to
return
to
opec
will
probably
manage
to
stabilize
the
oil
market
by
choosing
the
right
language
benigni
said
they
will
indicate
a
cut
of
between
million
and
million
and
that
will
do
the
market
probably
will
it
s
somewhat
surprising
how
fast
the
market
swung
into
excess
after
in
june
opec
and
russia
agreed
to
stop
cutting
production
and
to
begin
to
ramp
up
as
prices
climbed
to
uncomfortably
high
levels
for
some
major
importers
this
month
all
three
biggest
producers
globally
hit
new
records
with
saudi
arabia
s
daily
production

exceeding
million

latest
production
data
from
the
kingdom
russia
and
the
united
states
has
pressured
prices
in
addition
to
gloomy
demand
outlooks
and
the
talk
about
production
cuts
started
by
saudi
arabia
has
not
been
able
to
apply
sufficient
counter
if
these
talks
end
with
a
decision
to
start
cutting
price
movement
could
be
reversed
what
s
more
the
glut
is
not
across
all
grades
according
to
jbc
energy
group
s
chairman
what
really
are
in
oversupply
are
the
light
crude
barrels
which
are
coming
out
of
the
he
said
so
the
expectation
or
the
hope
for
opec
right
now
would
be
that
prices
go
lower
and
demand
may
come
but
others
are
skeptical
that
this
will
be
so
easy
to
do

the
oil

correction
has
become
a
rout
of
historic
proportions
as

the
negative
price
reaction
is
as
severe
as
the
financial

of
