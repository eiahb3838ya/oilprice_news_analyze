to
transport

the
necessary

iran

critical
actor
within
this

has
been

his
company
global

the
syrian
national
alchwiki
was
central
to
both
the
delivery
of

to
syria
and
the
transfer
of
funds

alchwiki

a
central
role
by

necessary
iranit
has
been
the
trump
administration
s
policy
to
confront
iran
and
these
sanctions
are
further
evidence
of
that
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
was
the
prelude
of
opposing
tehran
in
political
economic
and
diplomatic
areas
washington
s
success
has
been
and
diplomatically
president
trump
s
actions
unified
an
unusual
alliance
of
global
powers
including
russia
china

and
the
in
maintaining
the
nuclear
deal
the
has
also
tried
uniting
several
arab
states
in
what
has
been
called
the
arab
nato
this
initiative
isn
t
yet
the
success
it
was
hoped
to
become
primarily
due
to
the
blockade
of
qatar
by
several
other
members
the
awkward
collaboration
of
these
arab
countries
seems
to
be
motivated
by
appeasing
trump
rather
than
confronting
iran

waiverson
an
economic
level
washington
has
had
more
success
in
confronting
iran
after
the
signing
of
the
nuclear
deal
many
companies
showed
a
willingness
to
invest
in
the
country
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
however
made
many
companies
reconsider
their
investment
plans
most
notable
of
those
companies
was
french
energy
giant
total
which
abandoned
its
massive
south
pars
lng
the
has
granted
temporary
sanction
waivers
to
eight
countries
to
import
iranian
oil
it
is
highly
unlikely
these
will
be
extended
the
prime
reason
for
washington
s
decision
was
its
fear
of
increasing
the
price
for
oil
by
depriving
the
market
of
million
barrels
of
iranian
oil
currently
tehran
is
under
pressure
as
the
economy
is
failing
and
protestors
are
taking
to
the
the
difficulties
iran
is
facing
many
analysts
believe
tehran
will
be
able
to
ride
out
the
storm
despite
the
recent
drop
in
prices
the
country
is
aided
by
relatively
high
oil
revenues
and
the
inability
of
trump
to
form
a
united
coalition
as
the
obama
administration
managed
with
the
previous
nuclear
new
sanctions
will
not
have
the
desired
effect
of
crippling
the
syrian
economy
or
depriving
assad
support
of
moscow
and
tehran
it
is
likely
that
oil
shipments
will
continue
while
the
itself
faces
increasing
pressure
