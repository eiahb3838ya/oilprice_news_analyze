how much oil production will the saudis cut?
donald
trump
continues
to
take
credit
for
lowering
oil
great
that
oil
prices
are
falling
thank
you
president
t
add
that
which
is
like
a
big
tax
cut
to
our
other
good
economic
news
inflation
down
are
you
listening
fed
trump
s
tweetstorm
complicates
the
meeting
in
vienna
next
week
trump
is
very
much
leaning
on
saudi
arabia
pressuring
them
not
to
cut
output
and
he
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
protect
the
saudis
even
though
the
cia
has
concluded
that
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
likely
ordered
the
murder
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
he
clearly
expects
the
saudis
to
return
the
favor
by
not
cutting
puts
riyadh
in
a
bind
saudi
arabia
needs
to
patch
up
its
relationship
with
the
west
but
it
also
can
oil
prices
at
current
levels
saudi
arabia
needs
brent
to
trade
north
of
per
barrel
for
its
budget
to
breakeven
massive
budget
deficits
during
the
downturn
help
explain
riyadh
s
in
late
they
had
tried
to
force
drillers
out
of
the
market
by
crashing
oil
prices
but
ultimately
caved
and
engineered
an
production
cut
to
push
prices
back
up
related
how
president
trump
is
undermining
oil
producerslittle
has
changed
since
then
saudi
arabia
s
spending
commitments
are
still
large
and
that
is
before
we
even
take
into
account
mbs
economic
reform
proposals
saudi
aramco
is
also
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
transform
itself
for
the
long
haul
there
was
the
aramco
ipo
that
has
since
been
shelved
there
were
the
plans
for
aramco
to
issue
one
of
the
largest
corporate
bond
offerings
ever
in
order
to
finance
a
major
stake
in
sabic
the
saudi
chemical
firm
that
initiative
was
also
recently
abandoned
now
aramco
s
ceo
says
the
company
will
spend
billion
to
transform
itself
into
a
global
refiner
and
chemical
is
going
to
require
a
lot
of
money
which
means
that
the
saudi
government
desperately
needs
a
rebound
in
oil
prices
but
that
goal
could
run
afoul
of
the
american
president
who
just
bailed
them
out
over
the
khashoggi
murder
of
jamal
khashoggi
put
a
lot
more
in
jeopardy
than
merely
low
oil
prices
mbs
after
several
years
of
glowing
press
in
the
west
put
his
country
s
strategic
alliance
with
the
at
risk
when
he
according
to
the
cia
ordered
the
assassination
of
khashoggi
now
with
only
trump
vouching
for
mbs
amidst
a
push
by
the
foreign
policy
establishment
to
throw
the
crown
prince
under
the
bus
the
saudis
have
little
room
to
anger
the
white
house
that
potentially
means
giving
up
on
the
more
aggressive
oil
option
floated
a
few
weeks
ago
a
cut
in
production
on
the
order
of
related
the
biggest
losers
of
the
current
oil
price
slumpthe
wall
street
journal
reports
that
the
latest
plan
hatched
in
riyadh
is
a
quiet
cut
in
vienna
which
consists
of
a
to
the
original
production
cuts
emphasizing
a
return
to
percent
compliance
because
saudi
arabia
is
now
massively
overproducing
by
about
million
barrels
per
day
a
return
to
the
prior
production
target
would
translate
into
a
sizable
it
will
be
still
a
big
cut
but
less
pronounced
a
senior
saudi
oil
adviser
told
the
wsj
the
report
suggested
that
this
plan
was
gaining
traction
among
opec
officials
this
the
quiet
cut
would
be
an
attempt
to
thread
the
needle
it
would
be
small
enough
that
it
might
keep
trump
happy
it
would
also
be
small
enough
that
russia
could
sign
on
moscow
has
been
more
reluctant
than
the
saudis
to
slash
output
but
it
would
be
large
enough
for
saudi
arabia
and
large
enough
in
theory
to
arrest
the
meltdown
in
it
is
quite
a
political
move
the
last
thing
saudi
arabia
wants
to
do
at
the
moment
is
to
risk
upsetting
trump
the
senior
saudi
oil
adviser
told
the
sudden
sensitivity
about
how
its
actions
are
perceived
by
washington
demonstrates
the
fallout
of
the
jamal
khashoggi
murder
mbs
has
sacrificed
a
ton
of
leverage
at
the
meeting
and
more
importantly
he
has
essentially
given
up
full
control
over
saudi
oil
policy
for
little
because
of
khashoggi
the
saudis
will
do
anything
to
make
sure
trump
doesn
t
do
anything
nasty
to
them
