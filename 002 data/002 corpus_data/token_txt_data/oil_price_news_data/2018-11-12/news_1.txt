the biggest threat to dollar dominance
russian
oil
exporters
are
pressuring
western
commodity
traders
to
pay
for
russian
crude
in
euros
and
not
dollars
as
washington
prepares
more
sanctions
for
the
annexation
of
crimea
by
moscow
reuters
reported
last
week
citing
as
many
as
seven
industry
it
may
have
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
traders
who
reuters
said
were
not
too
happy
about
it
the
russian
companies
move
was
to
be
expected
as
the
trump
administration
pursues
a
foreign
policy
where
sanctions
feature
prominently
this
approach
however
could
undermine
the
dominance
of
the
dollar
as
the
global
oil
trade
indications
of
this
undermining
became
evident
this
spring
when
russia
and
iran
launched
an
exchange
program
seeking
to
eliminate
bilateral
payments
in
dollars
and
plan
to
keep
it
going
for
five
years
the
sanction
buddies
discussed
this
sort
of
agreement
earlier
back
in
when
iran
was
still
under
western
sanctions
even
after
the
notorious
nuclear
deal
was
reached
the
two
countries
decided
to
go
ahead
with
their
barter
deal
and
the
preliminary
agreement
was
reached
last
year
according
to
it
russia
would
receive
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
exchange
for
us
billion
worth
of
russian
march
iran
banned
purchase
orders
denominated
in
dollars
and
said
that
any
merchant
using
dollars
in
their
orders
will
not
be
allowed
to
conduct
the
import
trade
a
month
later
tehran
announced
that
it
will
publish
all
its
official
financial
reports
in
euros
instead
of
dollars
in
a
bid
to
encourage
a
switch
to
euros
from
dollars
among
state
agencies
and
russia
s
biggest
oil
producers
are
renegotiating
oil
delivery
contracts
with
commodity
traders
and
three
of
them
rosneft
gazprom
neft
and
surgutneftegaz
have
raised
traders
hackles
by
insisting
they
the
traders
commit
to
paying
penalties
beginning
next
year
if
sanctions
disrupt
sales
and
as
a
result
the
buyers
fail
to
make
payments
also
there
are
discussions
about
using
euros
and
other
currencies
instead
of
dollars
to
ensure
payments
are
not
would
make
perfect
sense
for
the
seller
of
any
commodity
to
ensure
that
they
receive
payment
for
their
commodity
in
an
environment
of
sanctions
looking
for
ways
around
them
is
the
only
logical
behavior
and
russia
and
iran
are
not
alone
in
this
drive
to
distance
themselves
from
the
