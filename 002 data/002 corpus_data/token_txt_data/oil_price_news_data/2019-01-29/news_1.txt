new exploration tech finds 1.5 billion barrels of oil in alaska
digital
technology
adoption
in
all
stages
of
upstream
operations
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
has
seen
a
steep
rise
recently
while
a
lot
has
been
written
about
the
benefits
of
digitizing
various
aspects
of
the
extraction
and
field
maintenance
processes
there
is
also
another
major
field
where
digital
tech
is
changing
the
game
before
the
even
alaska
for
instance
new
technology
in
oil
and
gas
exploration
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
more
than
billion
barrels
of
crude
oil
in
the
north
slope
in
just
two
years
s
p
global
platts
recently
reported
these
are
deposits
that
were
known
to
be
there
but
the
resources
they
held
could
not
be
mapped
or
measured
so
the
deposits
were
considered
unproductive
before
digital
tech
in
the
form
of
advanced
seismic
surveys
and
new
data
processing
techniques
came
established
exploration
methods
are
one
area
where
there
is
a
surge
of
improvements
as
seen
in
the
alaska
case
but
there
are
also
alternative
exploration
techniques
emerging
around
the
world
one
of
these
is
interestingly
enough
soil
analysis
a
dutch
company
biodentify
collects
thousands
of
soil
samples
to
analyze
the
dna
of
thousands
of
microorganisms
for
traces
of
hydrocarbons
in
their
environment
the
company
utilizes
machine
learning
for
the
task
and
to
calculate
the
potential
reserves
of
a
deposit
with
according
to
the
company
more
than
percent
accuracy
what
s
more
the
whole
procedure
takes
between
and
weeks
which
is
a
relatively
short
time
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
reduces
the
risk
of
drilling
unproductive
digital
technology
matures
and
machine
learning
techniques
advance
we
ll
probably
be
seeing
a
lot
more
different
exploration
techniques
that
reduce
the
risk
of
spending
millions
on
a
well
only
to
find
out
it
s
dry
despite
last
year
s
international
oil
price
improvements
the
industry
is
still
being
cautious
and
there
are
indications
it
is
beginning
to
like
this
new
normal
of
leaner
and
meaner
to
a
significant
extent
enabled
by
technology
related

prices

january
in
yearsoil
and
gas
companies
even
the
most
resilient
and
successful
among
them
are
keeping
their
spending
under
control
true
some
supermajors
have
announced
larger
budgets
for
this
year
than
last
but
for
the
most
part
the
industry
is
keeping
a
lid
on
expenses
and
trying
to
get
more
from
every
dollar
spent
than
is
an
environment
conducive
to
a
lot
of
innovation
in
all
stages
of
the
production
process
new
drilling
tech
is
also
helping
lower
costs
and
improve
results

coiled
tubing
drilling
as
an
alternative
to
the
multilaterals
in
horizontal
drilling
coiled
tubing
involves
drilling
horizontal
wells
with
a
flexible
tubing
bit
which
is
cheaper
than
drilling
with
rotary
rigs
it
could
be
so
cheap
in
fact
that
drilling
costs
per
barrel
of
new
oil
in
already
producing
fields
could
be
as
little
as
us
on
the
other
hand
is
focusing
on
developing
artificial
intelligence
to
use
in
drilling
among
other
things

recently
in
a
story
about
his
work
on
data
strategy
with
the
supermajor
that
shell
is
using
reinforcement
learning
a
form
of
machine
learning
to
improve
drilling
results
and
also
reduce
wear
and
tear
on
the
equipment
which
ultimately
once
again
saves
costs
the
list
of
examples
can
continue
and
it
will
only
become
longer
in
the
future
the
oil
and
gas
industry
has
been
remarkably
fast
in
adopting
what
digital
technology
has
to
offer
and
spurring
innovation
