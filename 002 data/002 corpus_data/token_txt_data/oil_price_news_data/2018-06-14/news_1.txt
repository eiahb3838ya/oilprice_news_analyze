shale drillersâ€™ $7 billion hedging error
oil
producers
are
finding
themselves
in
kind
of
a
pickle
while
oil
prices
are
indeed
on
the
rise
many
producers
are
unable
to
take
full
advantage
of
this
nicety
because
they
have
locked
some
of
their
production
in
at
lower
price
time
last
year
when
wti
crude
prices
were
around
a
barrel
shale
producers
were
looking
for
opportunities
to
hedge
some
of
their
future
production
whenever
oil
prices
went
hedge
their
production
by
purchasing
financial
options
to
ensure
a
minimum
price
for
their
crude
oil
in
the
future
thus
protecting
their
revenues
and
production

hedging
at
a

wti
looked
like
a
bargain
producers
were
anxious
to
sell
the
barrels
they
had
which
would
immediately
garner
only

that
higher

matter
what
the

would
be

far
beyond
this
year
in
june
oil
prices
are
significantly
higher
than
at
the
same
time
last
year
and
producers
that
hedged
barrels
at
wti
can
not
take
full
advantage
of
the
recent
oil
rally
that
