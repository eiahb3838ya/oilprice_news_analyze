does saudi arabia really have as much oil as analysts think?
officially
venezuela
has
the
world
s
largest
crude
oil
reserves
with
billion
barrels
of
proved
reserves
but
a
lot
of
this
oil
is
crude
oil
and
may
not
be
economical
to
produce
at
prevailing
prices
thus
some
portion
of
venezuela
s
barrels
may
in
reality
no
longer
be
in
the
proved
reserves
that
venezuela
s
proved
reserves
jumped
from
billion
barrels
in
to
billion
barrels
in
the
main
reason
for
that
wasn
t
a
bunch
of
new
oil
discoveries
no
it
was
the
fact
that
oil
prices
had
reached
triple
digits
making
venezuela
s
extra
heavy
oil
economical
to
produce
in
other
words
resources
the
oil
in
the
ground
were
moved
into
the
proved
reserves
oil
that
is
economical
to
produce
arabia
on
the
other
hand
reported
billion
barrels
of
proved
reserves
in
and
billion
barrels
in
saudi
arabia
s
barrels
were
deemed
to
be
economical
to
produce
even
before
oil
prices
spiked
for
that
reason
i
consider
saudi
arabia
s
proved
reserves
percent
of
the
global
total
to
be
of
the
most
significance
to
the
global
oil
doubts
about
the
amount
of
saudi
arabia
s
reserves
have
persisted
for
years
in
saudi
arabia
stopped
allowing
their
oil
and
gas
data
to
be
scrutinized
prior
to
that
outsiders
had
some
access
to
information
on
their
reserves
when
that
accessibility
was
shut
down
saudi
proved
oil
reserves
were
estimated
to
be
billion
around
saudi
raised
their
estimate
of
proved
reserves
by
billion
barrels
many
pundits
have
suggested
that
this
upward
revision
was
based
on
internal
opec
politics
since
the
reserves
were
no
longer
subject
to
outside
audit
there
was
a
great
deal
of
skepticism
around
the
official
numbers
the
saudis
skepticism
deepened
when
one
considered
that
saudi
s
reserves
in
were
billion
barrels
and
today
nearly
years
later
they
are
reportedly
billion
barrels
meanwhile
saudi
arabia
produced
over
billion
barrels
between
and
how
then
could
their
reserves
be
essentially
unchanged
related
is
right
to
dismiss
nuclear
energy
in
preparation
for
a
potential
ipo
saudi
s
national
oil
company
saudi
aramco
commissioned
an
outside
audit
of
its
proved
reserves
the
external
audit
found
saudi
s
proved
oil
reserves
to
be
at
least
billion
doubts
persist
for
example
oil
economist
mamdouh
salameh
who
is
a
visiting
professor
of
energy
economics
at
escp
europe
business
school
london
recently
wrote
my
calculation
of
saudi
reserves
based
on
saudi
production
since
the
discovery
of
oil
in
till
now
for
which
we
have
figures
and
a
deduction
of
an
annual
depletion
rate
of
saudi
aging
fields
averaging
percent
for
the
same
period
gives
a
figure
of
bb
of
remaining
reserves
my
figures
are
more
or
less
in
line
with
those
of
other
i
once
did
a
similar
calculation
i
started
with
the
assumption
that
the
estimate
of
billion
barrels
was
correct
and
then
i
just
subtracted
saudi
production
since
then
i
calculated
their
total
production
since
as
billion
barrels
leaving
billion
barrels
of
i
then
did
a
sanity
check
that
threw
that
calculation
in
doubt
i
did
the
same
calculation
for
proved
reserves
over
the
same
time
proved
crude
oil
reserves
were
reported
to
be
billion
barrels
by
and
before
the
shale
oil
boom
was
underway
proved
reserves
had
only
fallen
to
billion
barrels
but
total
production
between
and
was
billion
we
extend
that
calculation
through
the
end
of
proved
reserves
have
actually
jumped
to
billion
barrels
per
the
bp
statistical
review
and
there
have
been
billion
barrels
of
production
since
reiterate
in
proved
crude
oil
reserves
stood
at
billion
barrels
between
then
and
the
produced
billion
barrels
of
oil
yet
proved
reserves
grew
to
billion
barrels
related
can
ukraine
gain
energy
independence
how
did
this
happen
there
were
new
discoveries
technological
improvements
that
allowed
more
barrels
to
be
extracted
from
existing
fields
and
higher
prices
that
made
additional
resources
economical
to
think
it
s
reasonable
to
assume
that
saudi
arabia
also
found
additional
barrels
since
they
also
have
access
to
the
same
kinds
of
technology
that
improved
recovery
in
fields
therefore
i
do
not
believe
it
s
a
legitimate
exercise
to
consider
depletion
from
a
historical
reserves
number
to
estimate
current
reserves
such
an
exercise
would
have
suggested
that
oil
production
would
have
fallen
to
zero
by
i
don
t
find
a
reasonable
basis
for
concluding
that
saudi
arabia
s
reserves
are
much
lower
than
their
official
numbers
their
published
reserves
are
consistent
with
the
independent
audit
and
they
are
consistent
with
the
experience
in
the
of
reserves
growth
despite
significant
oil
you
think
that
the
results
are
atypical
you
can
repeat
this
exercise
for
any
of
the
world
s
major
oil
producers
and
find
the
same
thing
starting
with
the
proved
reserves
in
and
subtracting
the
subsequent
production
will
not
accurately
predict
the
reserves
at
some
point
in
the
future
in
many
cases
as
with
the
cumulative
production
was
greater
than
the
proved
reserves
i
have
thus
far
found
no
good
reason
to
doubt
