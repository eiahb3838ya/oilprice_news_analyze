why the oil rally isn’t over yet
crude
oil
sentiment
is
shifting
in
a
bullish
direction
with
cuts
and
a
growing
list
of
serious
outages
taking
supply
off
of
the
arabia
recently
signaled
that
it
would
slash
its
production
to
just
million
barrels
per
day
or
about
more
than
required
under
the
deal
that
would
take
saudi
production
down
to
close
to
a
low
a
sign
that
riyadh
is
aggressively
trying
to
push
up
oil
is
significant
especially
since
russia
is
not
really
carrying
its
weight
russia
cut
output
by
bpd
in
january
according
to
bloomberg
only
about
of
its
promised
bpd
reduction
as
part
of
the
saudi
arabia
is
more
than
making
up
for
its
lagging
partner
meanwhile
the
outages
in
venezuela
could
mushroom
in
the
days
and
weeks
ahead
the
crisis
is
and
the
precise
amount
of
oil
that
is
knocked
offline
will
be
tricky
to
gauge
but
it
s
a
safe
bet
that
the
losses
will
could
also
add
to
the
supply
woes

pence

expected
several
of
his
lines
to
be

with
applause
but
instead
they
were
met
with
awkward
foreign
policy
has
grown
much
more
aggressive
in
the
year
since

became

the
still
hopes
to

although
that
could
prove
tricky
as
the
oil
market
is
tightening
recently
an
unexpected

at
a

has

many
different

in

with

which
suggests
that

are

the

be
of

many

further

are
not

we
view
the
current

rise
as
exaggerated
and
see
growing

potential
the
fact
that
oil
production
in
the
us
is
currently
rising
significantly
more
sharply
than
previously
expected
is
being
completely
ignored

risks

can
likely
be
chalked
up
to
a
combination
of
the
potential
for
a
global
economic
slowdown
weaker

and
rising
there
is
also
the
risk
that
saudi
arabia
becomes
fed
up
with
by
russia

if

only
met
with
surging

supply
saudi
arabia
won
t
want
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
balancing
the
oil
market
forever
riyadh
is
running
sizable
budget
deficits
and
is
turning
to
the
bond
markets
to
fill
the
gap
if
production
cuts
are
not
met
with
higher
prices
the
pain
will
grow
hence
saudi
arabia
will
not
keep
turning
the
spigots
off
if
it
is
not
succeeding
in
supporting
prices
either
because
of
poor
compliance
from
other
members

if
