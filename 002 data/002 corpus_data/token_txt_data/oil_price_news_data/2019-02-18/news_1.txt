bank of america: oil ‘anchored’ until 2024
brent
oil
prices
should
trade
between
a
relatively
narrow
range
of
to
per
barrel
through
with
prices
anchored
around
according
to
a
new
report
from
bank
of
america
merrill
dovetails
with
the
current
futures
prices
five
years
out
centered
around
per
barrel
prices
will
bounce
around
but
should
remain
within
that
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
caveats
with
this
outlook
a
year
ago
the
bank
said
that
the
risks
to
the
forecast
were
skewed
to
the
upside
now
it
believes
that
the
downside
risks
are
growing
shale
supply
continues
to
rise
expanding
faster
and
by
larger
volumes
over
the
past
year
than
anticipated
also
demand
is
slowing
and
expected
to
continue
to
decelerate
in
the
short
run
bofaml
sees
brent
rising
back
to
per
barrel
the
combination
of
cuts
involuntary
outages
in
venezuela
and
iran
declines
in
mexico
and
elsewhere
will
all
contribute
to
tighter
supply
and
unlike
in
the
reductions
this
time
around
are
occurring
against
tighter
backdrop
of
lower
inventories
and
a
smaller
production
surplus
which
should
make
the
output
curtailments
more
the
flip
side
of
the
production
cuts
is
that
opec
is
building
back
up
spare
capacity
the
phase
in
of
the
supply
curbs
at
the
start
of
this
year
translated
into
a
jump
in
spare
capacity
from
to
in
a
matter
of
weeks
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
stated
throttling
back
on
production
simply
means
there
is
more
supply
sitting
on
the
sidelines
ready
to
go
in
the
event
of
an
outage
related
saudi
aramco
makes
existential
bet
on
oilas
a
result
the
supply
risks
to
the
market
are
diminished
which
tends
to
reduce
volatility
and
lower
futures
prices
the
growing
spare
capacity
volumes
should
keep
prices
anchored
in
a
to
range
even
if

crude
oil
prices
rebound
above
over
the
course
of
as
we
currently
project

one
enormous
source
of
uncertainty
is
the
trajectory
of
the
global
economy
manufacturing
activity
has
dipped
in
multiple
places
around
the
world
particularly
in
china
china
has
seen
the
most
significant
drop
in
activity
when
looking
at
the
pmis
bofaml
analysts
wrote
and
of
course
china
has
remained
the
pillar
of
global
demand
for
most
commodities
in
the
past
two
also
china
just
reported
another
month
of
poor
auto
sales
adding
to
the
evidence
of
a
potential
for
a
hard
landing
in
china
is
the
largest
downside
risk
to
bank
of
america
s
oil
market
forecast
at
the
same
time
it
isn
t
just
the
prospect
of
a
global
slowdown
that
threatens

energy
efficiency
renewable

and
natural

take
on
a
larger
share
of
the
total
energy
mix
bank
of
america
sees
oil
demand
hitting
a
peak
in
but
as
soon
as
the
demand
growth
will
fall
by
half
compared
to
this
year
s
growth
there
are
a
few
more
reasons
why
bank
of
america
believes
oil
prices
will
trade
within
a
relatively
narrow
range
opec
has
shown
a
willingness
to
cede
market
share
as
shale
output
continues
to
expand
that
keeps
prices
from
gyrating
too
much
meanwhile
last
year
president
trump
and
the
government
put
pressure
on
saudi
arabia
to
take
action
to
keep
prices
in
check
whenever
they
rose
too
much
political
pressure
could
limit
the
upside
to
crude
prices
related

or

new
mantramore
importantly
however
bank
of
america
argues
that
supply
is
ultimately
more
elastic
than
previously
thought
over
the
past
year
the
more
prices
rose
the
faster
shale
grew
american
shale
companies
are
still
struggling
to
report
profits
but
recent
history
has
demonstrated
that
the
flood
of
wall
street
finance
has
increased
anytime
oil
prices
have
climbed
ultimately
when
looking
out
over
a
few
years
this
leads
bank
of
america
to
conclude
that
prices
will
remain
in
echoes
the
shale
band
theory
that
emerged
a
few
years
ago
price
increases
are
met
with
faster
shale
supply
which
drags
prices
back
down
conversely
any
plunge
in
oil
prices
knocks
shale
offline
which
firms
up
the
market
again
the
responsiveness
of
shale
keeps
prices
within
a
narrower
band
than
has
historically
been
the
case
prior
to
the
shale
revolution
the
oil
market
overshot
to
the
upside
and
downside
to
a
much
greater
degree
owing
to
the
inelasticity
of
conventional
supply
many
analysts
believe
that
is
no
longer
the
case
because
of
short
bank
of
america
sees
oil
prices
rising
to
per
barrel
in
the
short
run
