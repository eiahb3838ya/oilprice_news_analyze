venezuelan oil exports plunge on ‘harsher’ sanctions
venezuela
s
oil
production
could
be
disrupted
to
a
greater
degree
than
most
analysts
first
thought
as
the
government
seeks
essentially
shut
in
the
country
s
oil
the
trump
administration
first
announced
sanctions
on
venezuela
s
oil
sector
a
little
over
a
week
ago
it
sounded
as
if
they
would
simply
bar
companies
from
buying
oil
that
would
still
mean
that
venezuela
could
ship
the
oil
elsewhere
albeit
at
a
painful
the
treasury
issued
some
more
details
on
february
sketching
out
a
harsher
sanctions
regime
the
sanctions
on
venezuela
will
actually
resemble
the
measures
targeting
iran
in
that
it
will
bar
companies
from
using
the
financial
system
to
do
business
with
pdvsa
as
such
the
reach
of
the
sanctions
will
extend
well
beyond
the
shores
of
the
united
reported
that
even
prior
to
last
friday
s
clarification
from
the
treasury
european
buyers
were
already
slashing
purchases
because
of
concerns
over
payments
reuters
reported
that
two
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
traders
vitol
and
trafigura
said
that
they
would
comply
with
all
a
result
pdvsa
and
maduro
s
government
could
have
a
much
harder
time
finding
destinations
for
venezuelan
oil
than
first
thought
the
wall
street
journal
reported
oil
storage
is
filling
up
in
venezuela
because
of
a
lack
of
wood
mac
venezuela
s
oil
output
to
fall
below
million
bpdmoreover
not
only
are
the
effects
of
the
sanctions
more
but
also
more
immediate
than
first
thought
at
first
the
seemed
to
exempt
shipments
that
were
underway
outlining
a
sort
of
phased
approach
that
would
allow
a
handful
of
american
refiners
to
gradually
unwind
their
oil
purchase
from
venezuela
the
phased
approach
which
was
supposed
to
be
extended
into
april
would
help
to
minimize
any
immediate
disruptions
secretary
of
treasury
steven
mnuchin
said
in
late
that
now
does
not
appear
to
be
what
is
unfolding
pdvsa
has
demanded
upfront
payment
likely
because
it
fears
not
being
paid
at
all
or
having
the
revenues
steered
to
the
opposition
indeed
the
effort
to
steer
pdvsa
and
its
revenues
into
the
hands
of
the
opposition
leader
juan
gauidó
appears
to
be
a
decisive
turning
tankers
linked
to
chevron
lukoil
and
respsol
are
delayed
redirected
or
sitting
offshore
because
of
lack
of
payment
the
wsj
says
that
several
of
those
tankers
had
recently
sent
oil
to
corpus
christi
texas
but
are
now
anchored
off
the
coast
of
maracaibo
sitting
idle
this
is
an
absolute
disaster
luis
hernández
a
venezuelan
oil
union
leader
told
the
wsj
there
s
almost
no
way
to
move
the
unable
to
sell
any
oil
maduro
s
regime
could
quickly
run
out
of
cash
the
result
could
be
a
humanitarian
catastrophe
a
merciless
and
destructive
objective
that
the
trump
administration
seems
to
have
in
mind
the
government
is
essentially
betting
that
by
driving
the
country
into
the
ground
the
military
and
the
people
will
turn
on
maduro
it
could
yet
turn
out
that
way
but
it
could
also
deepen
the
misery
and
exact
an
unspeakable
toll
on
the
venezuelan
population
the
very
people
the
trump
administration
says
it
is
trying
to
the
meantime
oil
exports
are
likely
heading
into
a
freefall
the
wsj
says
that
labor
problems
including
mass
defections
of
workers
are
accelerating
declines
pdvsa
could
soon
run
out
of
refined
with
knowledge
of
the
situation
told
the
wsj
that
venezuela
s
oil
production
has
likely
already
fallen
well
below
million
barrels
per
day
down
more
than
percent
at
least
from
december
opec
s
oil
princes
are
fighting
for
survivalwood
mackenzie
estimates
that
production
probably
stands
a
little
bit
higher
at
about
but
that
it
could
soon
fall
to
s
hard
to
imagine
how
maduro
can
hang
on
if
oil
exports
fall
precipitously
from
here
but
even
if
he
does
manage
to
stay
in
power
the
may
escalate
the
situation
last
month
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
had
troops
to
colombia
written
on
his
legal
pad
president
trump
himself
said
that
a
military
intervention
is
an
the
oil
market
the
crisis
presents
a
series
of
problems
if
maduro
hangs
on
and
the
continues
to
heap
more
pressure
on
his
government
venezuelan
oil
production
and
exports
will
continue
to
fall
alternatively
the
is
hoping
for
a
quick
regime
change
after
which
it
would
lift
sanctions
which
it
believes
will
lead
to
a
reversal
in
output
next
round
of
iran
sanctions
is
nearing
with
sanctions
waivers
expiring
in
may
as
such
the
window
of
opportunity
for
the
trump
administration
is
open
only
a
crack
necessitating
a
quick
political
change
barclays
wrote
in
a
note
by
the
third
quarter
the
loss
of
venezuelan
output
iran
sanctions
and
the
looming
regulations
from
the
international
maritime
organization
will
put
an
increasing
premium
on
medium
and
heavy
would
push
up
oil
prices
significantly
but
the
government
has
blown
past
the
point
of
no
return
leaving
it
with
no
other
options
except
to
escalate
that
means
that
venezuela
is
set
to
lose
a
lot
more
oil
than
analysts
thought
only
two
weeks
