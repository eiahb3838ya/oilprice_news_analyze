oil heads lower on small inventory build
a
day
after
the
american
petroleum
institute
disappointed
oil
bulls
by
reporting
an
estimated
inventory
build
across
the
board
the
energy
information
administration
deepened
the
mood
by
saying
crude
oil
inventories
added
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
february
million
barrels
the
eia
said
crude
oil
inventories
are
still
above
the
seasonal
average
but
not
by
gasoline
the
authority
reported
a
build
of
barrels
with
daily
production
at
a
little
less
than
million
barrels
a
week
earlier
gasoline
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
after
four
weekly
builds
and
hefty
ones
at
that
with
production
averaging
million
fuel
inventories
last
week
shed
million
barrels
and
production
averaged
million
barrels
per
day
a
week
earlier
inventories
recorded
a
decline
and
production
averaged
million
oil
prices
in
the
meantime
remain
volatile
although
not
as
volatile
as
some
expected
after
the
announcement
of
the
latest
round
of
sanctions
by
washington
against
caracas
the
worry
was
that
the
sanctions
targeting
specifically
pdvsa
will
result
in
a
shortage
of
heavy
crude
for
refineries
on
the
gulf
coast
but
in
actuality
there
seems
to
be
sufficient
spare
production
capacity
around
the
world
to
fill
any
supply
gap
resulting
from
the
latest
developments
in
and
around
will
take
time
for
the
market
to
factor
in
this
fact
and
for
now
the
concern
about
a
shortage
is
being
offset
by
the
production
cuts
opec
and
russia
agreed
at
the
end
last
s
report
tends
to
have
more
influence
on
prices
but
any
effect
will
likely
be
temporary
as
seen
with
earlier
weekly
inventory
reports
all
in
all
many
analysts
expect
the
heightened
oil
price
volatility
we
have
been
witnessing
for
a
few
months
now
to
remain
