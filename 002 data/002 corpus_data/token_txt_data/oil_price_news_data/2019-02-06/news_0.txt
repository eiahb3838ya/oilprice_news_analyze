how washington could spoil the opec+ alliance
opec
and
russia
are
officially
working
to
establish
a
formal
alliance
that
would
allow
for
the
indefinite
management
of
the
oil
coalition
often
referred
to
as
has
presided
over
two
rounds
of
production
cuts
since
early
the
deals
were
affairs
viewed
as
temporary
emergency
measures
to
erase
a
painful
glut
of
supply
that
was
draining
the
coffers
of
all
oil
producers
why
not
make
the
partnership
official
the
wall
street
journal
reports
that
such
negotiations
are
underway
this
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
heard
about
a
formal
partnership
last
year
the
two
sides
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
discussed
such
an
eventuality
but
ultimately
backed
idea
of
a
formal
architecture
has
an
obvious
logic
together
controls
over
percent
of
global
oil
supply
combining
their
production
volumes
to
tweak
output
levels
here
and
there
in
order
to
achieve
stability
or
rather
to
obtain
a
desired
price
level
is
much
more
easily
achieved
by
coordinating
their
actions
they
are
stronger
together
rather
than
the
idea
of
a
formal
alliance
has
been
predicated
on
the
strengthening
of
strategic
ties
between
russia
and
saudi
arabia
the
two
governments
have
grown
closer
over
the
past
few
years
the
saudis
see
the
upside
of
moving
closer
to
another
global
power
particularly
after
they
grew
suspicious
of
the
government
following
the
iran
nuclear
deal
related
mozambique
lng
increasingly
appealing
for
international
playersfrom
moscow
s
perspective
they
can
peel
off
an
american
ally
and
strengthen
their
position
in
the
middle
east
there
are
also
growing
economic
ties
between
the
two
countries
aside
from
the
oil
managing
the
oil
market
is
the
main
attraction
of
this
formal
pact
if
completed
it
would
mark
the
endpoint
of
a
dramatic
change
that
got
underway
a
little
over
two
years
ago
opec
which
has
been
a
critical
fixture
of
the
oil
market
for
several
decades
is
giving
way
to
a
new
opec
whose
members
were
not
always
cordial
but
worked
to
at
least
put
forth
some
semblance
of
cooperation
has
ceased
to
be
a
body
in
which
each
of
its
members
is
an
active
participant
in
and
has
influence
over
official
oil
policy
for
the
entire
cartel
there
have
always
been
certain
power
dynamics
saudi
arabia
has
always
been
the
most
powerful
member
but
with
iran
hobbled
by
sanctions
and
more
than
a
few
others
dealing
with
instability
and
declining
output
it
is
really
riyadh
that
calls
all
of
the
and
moscow
that
is
saudi
arabia
s
partnership
with
russia
has
already
supplanted
opec
as
the
main
venue
where
oil
policy
is
made
look
no
further
than
the
past
few
opec
meetings
where
the
world
watched
the
awkward
scene
in
vienna
in
which
no
decisions
could
be
made
until
the
russian
energy
minister
it
makes
sense
to
formalize
an
arrangement
that
has
already
become
the
de
facto
architecture
the
wsj
reports
that
the
proposal
will
be
discussed
by
later
this
month
in
vienna
and
could
make
a
final
decision
by
problem
is
that
the
same
hiccups
that
tripped
up
negotiations
last
year
remain
russia
has
reservations
about
truly
cutting
its
oil
production
by
significant
volumes
russia
unlike
saudi
arabia
has
multiple
oil
companies
that
are
opposed
to
curtailing
output
also
much
of
the
rest
of
opec
aside
from
saudi
arabia
opposes
the
proposal
because
it
could
lead
to
a
domineering
alliance
between
riyadh
and
fact
the
proposal
from
last
year
would
have
granted
relatively
more
power
to
the
larger
producers
saudi
arabia
and
russia
ending
the
process
via
consensus
the
rest
of
opec
panned
the
proposal
related
oil
markets
react
lukewarm
to
venezuela
supply
outageyet
another
hurdle
to
fully
establishing
an
official
alliance
is
the
brewing
antipathy
towards
the
cartel
in
washington
the
congress
has
threatened
to
push
regulation
that
would
allow
the
justice
department
to
take
action
against
opec
countries
for
colluding
to
manipulate
the
oil
market
the
nopec
legislation
has
been
considered
at
times
in
the
past
but
ultimately
has
been
shelved
because
multiple
presidents
from
both
political
parties
opposed
the
move
mostly
due
to
fear
of
damaging
the
legislation
received
renewed
attention
because
president
trump
is
a
bit
more
unpredictable
and
has
lambasted
opec
for
engineering
price
spikes
the
murder
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
also
fueled
momentum
for
the
nopec
with
the
democrats
in
power
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
is
yet
another
push
for
the
bill
the
house
judiciary
committee
is
set
to
vote
on
the
bill
on
thursday
and
there
is
a
degree
of
bipartisan
support
for
alliance
was
scrapped
late
last
year
precisely
because
the
parties
involved
feared
punitive
action
from
the
justice
department
nopec
legislation
could
conceivably
pass
into
law
this
arabia
and
russia
want
to
formalize
the
partnership
but
washington
could
yet
spoil
