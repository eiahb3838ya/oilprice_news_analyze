is this the point of no return for maduro?
things
have
certainly
moved
into
a
higher
gear
in
venezuela
with
a
genuine
diarchy
vying
for
control
over
the
country
s
resources
and
populace
the
alleged
smuggling
of
gold
reserves
politicized
humanitarian
aid
rampant
disinformation
against
the
background
of
poverty
and
deprivation
venezuela
of
bears
an
uncanny
likeness
to
any
stereotypical
latin
american
country
of
the
century
the
us
sanctions
announced

have
driven

between
pdvsa
and
the
united
states
creating
a

of
no

for
president

almost
immediate
cessation
of
activity
with
us

coast
refiners
the
us
treasury
has
stated
that
under
president
maduro
pdvsa
has
become
a
vehicle
for
embezzlement
and
corruption
and
hence
from
january
onwards
all
income
from
the
sales
of
venezuelan
crude
should
be
transferred
to
escrow
accounts
in
the
united
states
accessible
only
by
the
guiad√≥
government
given
that
pdvsa
has
been
a
vehicle
for
embezzlement
