oil prices may have reached a bottom
last
friday
oil
prices
fell
for
the
consecutive
day
according
to
cnbc
this
marked
the
longest
losing
streak
for
crude
oil
in
have
covered
the
factors
behind
this
drop
in
the
previous
two
articles
to
recap
the
loss
of
china
as
an
export
market
for
oil
producers
has
caused
crude
inventories
in
the
to
swell
and
the
trump
administration
s
weakening
of
imminent
sanctions
on
iran
have
both
been
large
factors
in
the
badiali
senior
research
analyst
at
banyan
hill
thinks
the
decline
is
now
overdone
matt
says
that
from
april
to
september
iran
cut
of
exports
but
saudi
arabia
and
the
expanded
production
by
more
than
that
so
the
world
didn
t
feel
the
pinch
as
matt
explained
to
me
my
research
showed
that
during
the
to
iran
sanctions
many
of
the
asian
countries
cut
back
on
iranian
oil
imports
china
included
those
countries
cut
about
of
iranian
exports
that
demand
didn
t
go
away
it
was
filled
by
the
and
saudi
arabia
then
the
government
issued
waivers
to
most
of
iran
s
oil
trading
partners
now
that
those
same
countries
got
waivers
they
are
buying
iranian
crude
a
glut
of
oil
on
the
market
i
agree
that
the
demand
hasn
t
declined
supply
particularly
from
the
is
said
i
am
very
skeptical
that
the
saudi
s
can
maintain
this
level
of
production
it
s
only
about
below
their
highest
production
in
the
last
decade
and
they
only
maintained
that
level
of
output
for
a
few
months
before
cutting
back
i
believe
that
the
market
still
has
a
drop
in
demand
priced
in
that
seems
wrong
i
believe
this
will
be
the
low
oil
price
for
the
next
to
michael
bertuccio
president
ceo
of
energy
also
noted
that
refinery
maintenance
may
be
contributing
to
the
perception
of
an
oversupplied
market
i
believe
there
may
be
more
immediate
and
drivers
to
oil
prices
falling
particularly
the
west
texas
intermediate
wti
cash
market
in
cushing
oklahoma
this
is
refinery
maintenance
season
of
the
million
barrels
per
day
of
refining
capacity
in
padd
percent
has
been
the
biggest
threat
to
dollar
dominanceit
is
far
more
transparent
in
the
physical
oil
basis
markets
where
we
have
seen
midland
trading
plus
per
barrel
under
wti
however
houston
ship
channel
meh
is
trading
closer
to
brent
which
is
currently
plus
barrel
over
wti
add
a
stronger
and
strengthening
dollar
to
the
equation
and
i
see
this
as
nothing
more
than
a
price
michael
agrees
that
global
demand
remains
chinese
demand
he
believes
exports
will
accelerate
with
upcoming
pipeline
infrastructure
and
the
wide
basis
spreads
will
compress
towards
brent
which
is
a
better
benchmark
of
global
oil
thing
is
for
certain
oil
prices
are
on
sale
relative
to
where
they
were
a
month
ago
it
appears
unlikely
to
me
that
a
continued
decline
is
supported
by
fundamentals
especially
if
the
stops
granting
waivers
on
iranian
oil
imports
in
six
months
as
is
the
stated
