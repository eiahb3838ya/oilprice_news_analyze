the new oil order
in
the
decades
preceding
the
arrival
of
shale
oil
the
oil
market
had
only
one
stabilizing
force
namely
opec
the
reason
the
oil
market
was
structured
as
such
was
due
to
the
nature
of
conventional
oil
production
most
oil
production
prior
to
shale
oil
fell
in
one
of
two
categories
major
offshore
projects
that
took
to
years
to
build
north
sea
gulf
of
mexico
etc
or
mature
conventional
onshore
fields
conventional
fields
russian
siberian
fields
etc
both
of
these
conventional
oil
supply
sources
were
either
or
only
slowly
reactive
to
changes
in
the
oil
price
major
offshore
oil
projects
tended
to
come
online
regardless
of
the
oil
price
environment
while
conventional
onshore
oil
production
with
shallow
decline
rates
percent
meant
that
even
a
slowdown
in
drilling
would
not
impact
total
production
in
any
meaningful
way
for
an
extended
period
of
aforementioned
state
of
affairs
meant
that
it
was
up
to
opec
to
adjust
production
to
balance
the
market
in
case
of
abrupt
supply
or
demand
changes
opec
had
and
still
has
the
flexibility
to
withdraw
millions
of
barrels
from
the
market
within
a
month
or
two
if
such
a
need
arose

withdrawing

from
the

following
the

crisis
in
is
a
case
in
point
arrival
of
shale
oil
in
size
to
the
scene
in
has
upended
the
balancing
act
by
introducing
a

mechanism
that
in
the
long
run
will
prove
supportive
to
the
oil
market

especially
so
to
