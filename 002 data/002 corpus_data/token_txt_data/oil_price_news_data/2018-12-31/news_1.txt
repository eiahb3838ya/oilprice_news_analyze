$70 oil could be right around the corner
oil
markets
have
always
been
cyclical
and
now
even
more
so
with
advanced
electronic
trading
more
speculation
which
often
results
in
wider
oil
price
swings
and
more
producers
including
the
resurgence
of
oil
production
now
reaching
over
million
barrels
per
day
added
to
the
cocktail
of
uncertainty
are
also
a
myriad
of
geopolitical
and
economic
factors
including
ongoing
trade
tensions
angst
of
federal
reserve
policy
and
wars
in
syria
yemen
and
elsewhere
which
make
it
increasingly
difficult
to
forecast

for

oil
dynamic
has
proven
true
over
the
past
months
as
market
pundits
have
watched
often
in
amazement
how
global
oil
prices
reached
highs
in

quickly
plunge

forecasts
on
friday
bloomberg
said
that
many
of
the
world
s
largest
banks
are
forecasting
a
rebound
in

prices
next

fears
of

prove

michael
cohen
head
of
energy
and
commodities
research
at
barclays
plc
in
new
york
said
we
could
even
see
something
similar
to
a
recovery
next
year
on
two
very
important
conditions
one
that
the
reduction
in
opec
exports
leads
to
a
reduction
in
inventories
and
two
that
we
don
t
see
a
further
deterioration
in
macroeconomic
the
bloomberg
report
added
that
despite
a
recent
darkening
outlook
for
the
global
economy
amid
prolonged
trade
disputes
between
the
and
china
and
as
the
federal
reserve
embarks
on
tightening
monetary
policy
most
commentators
aren
t
seeing
an
actual
recession
biting
the
oil
market
next
year
the
median
forecast
of

analysts
in
the

that

a

said
that
prices
are
nearing
a
bottom
while
global
supply
and
demand
should
reach
a
fine
balance
next
bloomberg
added
that
in
the
absence
of
a
severe
economic
slump
most
analysts
anticipate
that
world
oil
consumption
will
continue
to
expand
at
roughly
the
pace
seen
in
recent
years
powered
by
emerging
economies
such
as
the
trade
war
variable
however
though
the
analysts
surveyed
by
bloomberg
give
credence
to
ongoing
trade
tensions
between
the
and
china
it
appears
that
unless
a
new
trade
deal
is
reached
by
the
march
deadline
between
the
two
sides
global
oil
demand
will
indeed
recede
amid
more
sluggish
global
economic
growth
led
by
a
slow
down
in
chinese
manufacturing
and
exports
since
the
and
china
are
the
world
s
two
largest
economies
ongoing
trade
tensions
are
already
hitting
global
supply
chains
particularly
in
asia
numerous
manufacturing
companies
have
already
exited
china
for
greener
pastures
including
setting
up
shop
in
neighboring
southeast

the

if

that
