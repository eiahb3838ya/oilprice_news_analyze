why aramco abandoned the $40 billion bond sale
saudi
aramco
has
changed
its
mind
about
a
bond
sale
of
about
us
billion
that
would
have
funded
the
bigger
part
of
its
planned
acquisition
of
a
majority
stake
in
local
petrochemicals
giant
sabic
the
wall
street
journal
reports
that
the
oil
major
had
been
concerned
about
requirements
for
disclosure
as
well
as
the
volatility
and
uncertain
outlook
for
oil
prices
according
to
unnamed
sources
familiar
with
the
announced
plans
to
acquire
up
to
percent
of
sabic
in
a
deal
expected
to
be
worth
about
us
billion
the
seller
is
the
saudi
sovereign
wealth
find
the
private
investment
fund
the
deal
would
have
expanded
aramco
s
downstream
business
substantially
which
would
have
made
it
more
attractive
for
potential
investors
if
its
initial
public
offering
ever
took
place
which
senior
officials
recently
said
it
us
billion
turned
out
to
be
too
hefty
a
price
even
for
the
world
s
biggest
oil
company
in
terms
of
resources
talk
at
the
time
surrounded
aramco
s
plan
to
use
us
billion
of
its
own
cash
and
borrow
the
rest
in
a
combination
of
various
large
loans
and
smaller
bridge
loans
the
loans
could
be
replaced
with
bond
issues
after
a
year
or
a
year
and
a
half
several
sources
told
reuters
last
the
public
disclosure
condition
of
international
bond
sales
has
made
aramco
think
twice
as
the
wsj
reports
bond
issuing
requires
disclosure
of
three
years
of
audited
financial
results
as
well
as
detailing
any
obstacles
that
could
affect
the
bond
sale
aramco
however
is
notoriously
opaque
when
it
comes
to
financial
results
and
everything
else
while
its
executives
have
repeatedly
made
assurances
that
aramco
would
start
reporting
its
financial
results
and
disclose
information
about
its
operations
ahead
of
the
ipo
now
that
this
has
been
postponed
until
at
least
the
company
seems
to
not
see
any
need
to
stick
to
its
disclosure
pledge
related
the
impending
endgame
in
oil
marketsyet
disclosure
is
not
the
only
factor
stopping
aramco
from
tapping
international
bond
markets
the
company
s
only
asset
is
oil
and
oil
has
not
been
doing
so
well
in
the
past
few
weeks
in
fact
over
the
past
month
crude
oil
benchmarks
dived
down
so
sharply
they
lost
over
a
fifth
of
their
value
over
the
period
what
must
have
additionally
stung
the
oil
industry
in
general
and
aramco
in
particular
was
the
fact
that
virtually
everyone
expected
a
price
rise
during
that
time
as
sanctions
against
iran
came
into
effect
instead
amid
assurances
including
from
saudi
arabia
that
there
will
be
enough
oil
prices
went
the
other
aren
t
many
options
left
for
the
acquisition
of
the
percent
in
sabic
as
per
a
reuters
report
from
october
a
leveraged
buyout
was
also
on
the
table
as
aramco
discussed
strategies
with
advisers
jpmorgan
and
morgan
stanley
the
other
option
is
debt
and
yet
the
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
bond
issuance
is
likely
to
have
reverberations
opening
up
the
saudi
bond
market
was
one
facet
of
the
sweeping
economic
reforms
that
crown
prince
mohammed
has
been
pursuing
over
the
last
couple
of
s
more
aramco
s
unwillingness
to
disclose
financial
reports
and
other
information
is
unlikely
to
sit
well
with
prospective
investors
if
we
assume
the
ipo
is
really
still
an
option
this
unwillingness
after
all
was
one
of
the
main
factors
that
caused
a
rather
lukewarm
interest
among
investors
during
prince
mohammed
s
roadshow
the
he
undertook
to
promote
the
ipo
finally
the
combination
of
unwillingness
to
disclose
information
and
the
uncertainty
surrounding
oil
prices
might
make
it
harder
to
borrow
true
this
is
aramco
we
re
talking
about
and
aramco
s
reputation
means
a
lot
for
bankers
still
after
the
backlash
saudi
arabia
received
after
the
murder
of
dissident
jamal
unthinkable
a
few
years
are
bankers
might
have
become
more
cautious

approving
