alberta to fight “air barrels” as prices continue to plunge
albertan
oil
producers
need
to
become
warier
of
overbooking
already
filled
to
capacity
oil
pipelines
creating
what
s
commonly
called
air
barrels
as
these
contribute
to
the
huge
discount
canadian
crude
is
trading
at
to
wti
and
other
benchmarks
this
is
the
message
from
alberta
s
premier
rachel
notley
as
reported
by
the
calgary
oil
industry
in
alberta
has
been
scrambling
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
discount
that
has
eaten
deeply
into
producers
bottom
lines
since
new
pipelines
are
far
from
likely
to
come
into
operation
in
the
foreseeable
future
other
options
are
being
considered
including
most
recently
deliberately
cutting
production
to
prop
up
however
are
divided
on
this
while
cenovus
is
all
for
cuts
in
production
suncor
an
equally
large
producer
is
against
we
re
probably
producing
about
or
barrels
per
day
of
oil
in
excess
of
our
ability
to
get
that
oil
out
of
the
province
either
by
pipelines
or
by
rail
cenovus
ceo
alex
pourbaix
told
canadian
media
earlier
this
the
other
hand
our
position
is
that
government
intervention
in
the
market
would
send
the
wrong
signals
to
the
investment
community
regarding
doing
business
in
alberta
and
canada
and
we
really
do
need
to
take
a
view
and
allow
the
market
to
operate
as
it
should

provincial
government
meanwhile
is
considering
closer
scrutiny
of
pipeline
and
railway
shipments
in
order
to
see
which
producers
are
guilty
of
creating
air
barrels
it
could
then
hold
them
accountable
the
problems
with
this
approach
are
that
it
can
not
be
deployed
immediately
and
that
it
will
have
a
limited
scope
as
the
provincial
government
could
only
give
itself
the
powers
to
track
shipments
within
alberta
the
industry
and
the
government
are
trying
to
come
up
with
some
sort
of
solution
to
the
price
