the six factors driving oil markets in 2018
uncertainty
appears
to
have
returned
to
oil
markets
of
late
with
a
cluster
of
factors
battling
for
influence
over
oil
bulls
are
very
content
with
the
vienna
deal
its
success
hitherto
and
the
prospects
of
another
extension
the
coming
summer
driving
season
is
sure
to
boost
this
bullish
sentiment
as
demand
looks
set
to
jump
trump
s
recent
political
reshuffle
and
the
impact
that
may
have
on
the
termination
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
the
associated
geopolitical
tensions
in
the
add
still
more
upside
for
bears
can
counter
these
arguments
by
questioning
the
longevity
of
the
vienna
oil
deal
pointing
to
the
rising
prospects
of
trade
war
between
china
and
the
and
highlighting
the
incredible
growth
in
shale
production
for
the
rest
of
the
year
it
will
be
the
between
these
bullish
and
bearish
factors
that
control
where
prices
s
be
honest
bulls
have
largely
dominated
the
market
while
bears
appear
to
have
gone
into
hiding
the
bullish
factors
have
been
quite
prominent
in
the
news
of
late
and
summer
driving
season
is
finally
upon
us
the
summer
driving
season
starts
in
april
and
ends
in
september
with
different
peak
periods
millions
of
cars
hit
the
road
as
families
head
out
on
vacation
this
results
in
increased
gasoline
consumption
forcing
refineries
to
consume
more
oil
to
meet
the
demand
in
combination
with
other
factors
the
uptick
in
demand
due
to
driving
season
will
definitely
provide
some
upside
for
oil
prices
related
is
oil
demand
growth
overrated
as
well
as
driving
season
donald
trump
s
administration
will
soon
formally
the
iran
deal
known
as
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
the
sacking
of
national
security
adviser
mcmaster
who
was
replaced
by
john
bolton
has
signaled
that
the
administration
is
likely
to
take
a
more
hawkish
stance
against
iran
it
is
well
known
that
john
bolton
has
no
taste
for
soft
diplomacy
it
is
expected
that
on
may
the
united
states
will
likely
cancel
jcpoa
oil
prices
spiked
on
the
news
of
bolton
s
appointment
and
they
will
likely
spike
again
if
the
agreement
is
indeed
cancelled
however
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
this
will
be
a
long
term
bullish
factor
for
oil
prices
or
if
it
is
largely
a
sentiment
bulls
and
bears
will
be
watching
opec
s
june
meeting
carefully
if
the
countries
not
only
reiterate
their
commitment
which
may
include
extending
the
deal
till
oil
prices
are
likely
to
rally
however
if
the
meeting
ends
without
action
or
the
common
opec
jawboning
it
is
likely
that
prices
will
fall
if
whispers
of
an
exit
are
heard
confidence
in
oil
markets
may
drop
dramatically
and
bears
will
likely
come
rushing
other
factors
should
analysts
look
for
when
it
comes
to
driving
crude
prices
down
in
the
coming
year
one
of
the
most
notable
is
the
brewing
trade
war
between
two
of
the
biggest
economic
behemoths
of
the
world
usa
and
china
as
mentioned
above
the
increasingly
hawkish
administration
may
chance
the
face
of
foreign
policy
and
in
this
case
it
will
likely
be
bearish
for
oil
markets
trump
has
proposed
steel
and
aluminum
tariffs
percent
on
former
and
percent
on
latter
he
is
looking
to
impose
a
further
billion
of
tariffs
in
other
areas
china
quickly
retaliated
to
these
first
sanctions
and
has
claimed
that
it
will
match
trump
s
every
step
in
this
regard
trump
is
now
planning
another
billion
tariff
plan
for
china
talk
of
a
fully
blown
trade
war
may
be
premature
but
the
first
signs
are
certainly
there
oil
prices
have
fallen
each
time
that
the
trade
war
escalates
with
one
key
consequence
of
a
trade
war
being
a
fall
in
oil
demand
as
exports
to
the
world
s
largest
oil
consumer
fall
while
the
iran
wild
card
may
threaten
to
push
oil
prices
up
a
trade
war
between
china
and
the
would
have
the
opposite
strong
demand
not
opec
is
pushing
oil
prices
higheras
with
all
discussions
in
global
oil
markets
today
the
remarkable
growth
of
shale
growth
can
not
be
avoided
with
production
touching
mbpd
and
only
growing
the
downward
pressure
in
markets
from
shale
could
be
very
significant
in
the
right
environment
the
eia
says
that
us
crude
oil
output
will
rise
to
mbpd
next
year
a
revision
from
mbpd
from
last
month
fatih
birol
speaking
during
international
energy
forum
recently
said
that
another
wave
of
shale
oil
is
on
its
way
and
added
that
beyond
the
there
will
be
growth
in
offshore
production
from
brazil
and
parts
of
africa
as
well
this
production
is
all
being
driven
by
the
recent
rise
in
oil
prices
forming
what
could
become
a
vicious
circle
for
oil
markets
one
bit
of
good
news
that
oil
analysts
can
take
from
this
however
is
that
firms
appear
to
have
learnt
their
lessons
from
the
oil
price
crash
shale
companies
have
hedged
a
large
portion
of
production
and
are
finally
becoming
profitable
for
and
bears
will
continue
to
clash
in
the
oil
markets
and
while
bulls
currently
have
the
upper
hand
it
is
unlikely
they
will
maintain
their
dominance
all
year
among
the
factors
mentioned
above
some
are
temporary
geopolitical
some
are
uncertain
opec
and
some
are
more
or
less
permanent
shale
growth
analysts
should
focus
on
trends
watching
each
of
these
factors
and
understanding
how
different
outcomes
may
move
