oil
company
may
be
forced
to
announce
a
force
majeure
on
crude
oil
exports
if
clients
awaiting

continue
to
refuse
to
accept
new
contract
terms
the
company
has
proposed
as
a
means
of
coping
with
a
tanker

its
two
biggest

more
than
tankers
waiting
to
load
at
venezuelan
ports
but
not
all
of
these
ports
are
fit
to
load
larger
vessels
so
pdvsa
has
offered
buyers
to
move
the
large
vessels
to
its
deepwater
port
of
paraguana

load
them
by
using

has
asked
several
asian
clients
if
they
would
agree
to
a
transfer
but
they
have
declined
according
to
the
reuters
source
on
the
grounds
that
there
will
be
no
third
party
to
supervise
the
loading
also
transfers
would
produce
additional
costs
for
the
buyers
traders
told
to
the
venezuelan
source
however
many
customers
are
going
to
prefer
this
than
continuing
to
accumulate
demurrage
that
is
longer
waiting
times
