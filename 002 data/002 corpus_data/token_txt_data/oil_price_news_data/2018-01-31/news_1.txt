mexicoâ€™s oil dilemma continues in 2018
gasoline
exports
averaged
just
over
one
million
barrels
per
day
in
with
a
strong
push
higher
at
the
end
of
the
year
hark
an
average
of
million
bpd
in
as
exports
registered
their
highest
month
of
loadings
on
our
records
in
december
they
outpaced
middle
distillate
exports
for
the
first
time
since
november
is
a
typical
seasonal
pattern
for
light
versus
middle
distillate
exports
a
somewhat
inverse
relationship
gasoline
exports
peak
in
the
winter
when
domestic
demand
is
low
while
diesel
exports
peak
in
the
summer

middle
distillate
exports
rose
over
bpd
last
year
versus
with
volumes
peaking
in
july
at
million
barrels
per

they
finished
the
year
strong
at
over
million
bpd
driven
on
by
demand
from
brazil
and

loadings
bound
for
brazil
rose
percent
last

while
flows
heading

mexico
rose
a
more
sedate
percent
gasoline
exports
rose
just
over
bpd
last
year
again
with
brazil
and
mexico
as
key
drivers
loadings
bound
for

accounted
for
nearly

mexican
refinery
woes
have
been
well
documented
in
the
last
year
and
are
set
to
continue
in
number
of
pemex
refineries
in
mexico
have
been
operating
at
almost
half
their
capacity
four
months
after
they
were
shut
down
for
maintenance
last
quarter
they
were
expected
to
resume
full
operations
by
the
new
year
but
this
timeline
has
now
been
pushed
back

the
outlook
for
mexican
refineries
continues
to
deteriorate
in
tandem
with
its

pemex
spending
on
the

sector
was
slashed
by
a

year
to
billion
pesos

continues
to

a
lack
of
investment
