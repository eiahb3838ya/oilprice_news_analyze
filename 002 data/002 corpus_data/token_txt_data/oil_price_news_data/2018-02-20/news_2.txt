delays
in
budget
payments

the
national

libya
could
threaten
the

chairman
mustafa
sanalla
said
in
a
statement
the
entire
sector
is
suffering
from
these
problems
because
of
delays
in
the
finance
ministry
disbursing
budgets
to
the
corporation
for
this
year
the
statement
s
oil
production
averaged
more
than
million
bpd
in
january
for
the
first
time
topping
the

a
full
month
since
july
data
provider
genscape
estimated
earlier
this
month
libya
produced
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
million
of
total
liquids
genscape
said
adding
that
its
oil
production
monitoring
showed
that
oil
fields
in
libya
appeared
to
operate
relatively
consistently
in
january
without
steep
significant
dips
below
the
average
production
levels
due
to
weather
or

this
is
still
well
below
the
million
bpd
the

country
produced
before

as
the
political
situation
in
the
country
remains
highly

with
various

unlikely
to
cease
anytime
soon
according
to
bmi
research
which
recently
warned
that
nigeria
and
libya
are
at
a
high
risk
of
oil

disruption
because
of

analysts
believe
the
libyan

be
delayed
until

the
risk
of
disruptions
to
oil
production
will
be
particularly
heightened
towards
the
end
of
as
militant
factions
across
the
country
will
need
to
align
support
with
their
favoured

likely
turn
to
disrupting
oil
