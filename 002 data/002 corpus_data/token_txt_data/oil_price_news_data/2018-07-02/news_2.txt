tehran
remains
defiant
over
impending

and
just
days
after
india
indicated
it

petroleum
ministry
told
cnn
earlier
when
asked

would

after
china
india
is
the
largest
buyer
of

trump
said
on
tuesday
that
the
would
level
sanctions
on
countries
that
not
did
not
cut
iranian
oil
india
made
an
initial
defiant
stand
it
simply
can
t
afford
to
alienate
washington
since
it
has
to
safeguard
its
exposure
to
the
financial
system
a
powerful
tool
that
the
can
wield
as
it
pleases
since
the
dollar
is
the
world
s
reserve
currency
this
allows
washington
to
level
crippling
sanctions
on
a
wide
range
of
countries
all
the
way
from
russia
to
venezuela
to
iran
and
anybody
else
that
any
sitting
president
sees
fit
to
punish
related
stranded
bp
cargoes
a
red
flag
for
chinese
oil
demand
this
economic
weapon
is
also
why
beijing
is
working
feverishly
to
supplement
or
replace
the
dollar
as
the
world
s
reserve
currency
in
september
john
hardy
the
head
of
fx
strategy
at
saxo
bank
said
china
was
eyeing
the
benefits
of
having
its
own
currency
play
a
larger
role
and
to
supplant
the
usd
role
in
global
trade
the
initial
focus
is
on
the
global
oil
trade
where
it
has
announced
the
intention
of
buying
oil
in
yuan
and
allowing
trade
partners
to
settle
that
yuan
in
gold
he
added
that
settling
in
gold
is
a
clever
move
by
beijing
as
it
provides
countries
with
a
greater
degree
of
for
oil
supply
alternativesone
of
the
reuters
sources
on
thursday
added
that
india
s
oil
ministry
had
held
a
meeting
with
refiners
that
day
urging
them
to
scout
for
alternatives
to
iranian
oil
india
has
asked
refiners
to
be
prepared
for
any
eventuality
since
the
situation
is
still
evolving
there
could
be
drastic
reduction
or
there
could
be
no
import
at
all
said
another
of
this
first
perfectly
into
the
revamped
playbook
over
both
global
oil
markets
and
geopolitics
in
the
middle
east
though
trump
took
a
hard
line
against
the
saudis
during
the
presidential
campaign
even
calling
for
a
halt
to
all
saudi
oil
imports
to
the
as
president
he
has
become
more
pragmatic
working
with
riyadh
on
a
wide
range
of
issues
as
the
saudis
jockey
for
geopolitical
hegemony
over
iran
in
the
middle
tweets
impacts
global
oiltrump
for
his
part
delighted
the
saudis
when
he
announced
that
sanctions
would
be
reactivated
against
iran
while
the
saudis
have
seemingly
become
docile
as
trump
uses
twitter
as
the
presidential
bully
pulpit
to
pressure
opec
to
keep
prices
from
spiraling
out
of
control
and
hurting
the
economy
ahead
of
the
november
congressional
elections
all
seats
in
the
house
and
of
the
seats
in
the
senate
will
be
contested
the
outcome
of
the
election
could
largely
dictate
how

half
of

term
unfolds
