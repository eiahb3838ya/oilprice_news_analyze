can opec halt an oil market meltdown?
what
a
difference
one
month
month
ago
the
international
energy
agency
iea
warned
that
the
world
was
straining
parts
of
the
system
to
the
limit
noting
that
recent
production
increases
come
at
the
expense
of
spare
capacity
and
that
the
strain
could
be
with
us
for
some
time
and
it
will
likely
be
accompanied
by
higher
in
the
iea
s
most
recent
oil
market
report
released
on
wednesday
the
energy
agency
welcomed
the
fact
that
rose
to
the
occasion
and
added
more
supply
to
a
market
that
was
rapidly
tightening
producers
have
heeded
the
warnings
and
more
than
met
the
challenge
and
today
the
big
three
russia
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
all
see
output
at
record
levels
the
iea
prices
are
back
down
to
more
reasonable
levels
which
should
provide
relief
for
consumers
a
particularly
welcome
development
for
emerging
markets
that
have
seen
their
currencies
rocked
this
year
the
iea
maintained
its
demand
growth
figure
at
for
and
for
despite
an
uncertain
outlook
for
the
global
agency
noted
that
global
production
has
accelerated
and
those
gains
combined
with
a
more
white
house
regarding
iran
sanctions
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
inventories
by
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
fourth
quarter
that
comes
on
the
heels
of
four
consecutive
months
of
inventory
builds
from
within
the
oecd
suggesting
that
supply
very
much
exceeds
demand
and
has
for
some
time
now
related
oil
prices
plunge
below
in
canadabecause
production
shale
canada
and
brazil
will
grow
rapidly
over
the
next
few
months
the
iea
says
that
inventories
could
build
at
a
rate
of
in
the
first
half
of
that
goes
a
long
way
to
explaining
the
recent
meltdown
in
oil
that
also
is
a
baseline
assumption
that
does
not
take
into
account
any
production
cuts
from
which
at
this
point
is
almost
certainly
in
the
offing
the
only
question
is
by
how
much
the
group
will
be
reducing
saudi
arabia
said
that
it
alone
would
slash
bpd
in
december
russia
was
a
bit
more
in
recent
days
but
the
utter
meltdown
in
prices
on
tuesday
down
percent
could
spur
a
more
concerted
the
size
of
the
production
cut
seems
to
have
grown
significantly
this
week
growing
larger
with
each
passing
day
as
oil
prices
continued
their
descent
on
monday
it
was
the
saudis
that
made
headlines
with
the
promised
cut
while
reductions
from
the
rest
of
the
group
were
unclear
by
tuesday
there
seemed
to
be
some
rumors
regarding
a
matching
bpd
from
the
rest
of
for
a
combined
cut
of
after
the
sharp
selloff
on
tuesday
putting
brent
back
into
the
and
wti
in
the
top
officials
seem
to
be
growing
more
concerned
reuters
reports
that
is
now
considering
a
cut
of
for
in
reality
they
may
have
discussed
this
option
last
weekend
along
with
other
options
at
the
meeting
in
abu
dhabi
but
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
coincidence
that
news
of
this
larger
plan
surfaced
a
day
after
one
of
the
sharpest
declines
in
oil
prices
in
a
long
time
i
believe
a
cut
of
million
bpd
is
more
reasonable
than
above
it
or
below
it
an
opec
source
told
reuters
related
the
world
most
important
oil
regionfor
now
russia
is
playing
it
cool
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
said
no
emergency
action
was
needed
the
market
is
quite
volatile
today
we
remember
that
the
oil
price
was
sharply
rising
in
the
same
way
now
it
is
going
down
we
have
to
look
into
development
into
how
the
price
will
be
stabilized
he
said
on
the
sidelines
of
a
conference
in
singapore
according
to
reuters
it
s
not
right
for
market
participants
to
react
to
any
fluctuations
he
iea
too
suggested
that
the
building
of
inventories
which
could
accelerate
is
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
in
an
uncertain
and
volatile
market
higher
inventories
could
be
a
form
of
insurance
the
agency
said
noting
that
the
still
wants
iran
s
oil
exports
at
zero
and
that
ongoing
violence
and
instability
in
libya
nigeria
and
venezuela
keep
open
the
possibility
of
more
dramatic
for
oil
exporting
countries
the
meltdown
in
oil
prices
down
nearly
percent
in
a
little
over
a
month
is
not
something
they
welcome
that
likely
ensures
a
sizable
cut
will
be
announced
in
vienna
in
about
three
weeks
