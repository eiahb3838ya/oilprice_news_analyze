u.s. sanctions could add $50 to oil prices
the
oil
industry
might
not
be
able
to
produce
enough
oil
to
meet
global
demand
in
a
few
years
be
sure
much
of
the
oil
world
is
focused
on
the
supply
fears
in
the
the
outages
in
several
opec
nations
plus
the
tightening
noose
on
iran
from
the
government
could
lead
to
a
supply
shortfall
towards
the
end
of
this
year
a
hole
so
big
that
saudi
arabia
could
struggle
to
fill
it
even
if
it
burned
through
much
of
its
spare
over
the
there
are
also
questions
about
the
global
oil
industry
s
ability
to
supply
enough
oil
to
the
isn
t
the
same
peak
oil
theory
as
yesteryear
but
there
certainly
seem
to
be
echoes
of
that
argument
bubbling
up
the
surface
once
again
while
the
world
isn
t
running
out
of
oil
there
could
be
a
shortage
of
cheap
oil
by
the
early
part
of
the
next
decade
the
majors
have
cut
spending
on
exploration
and
development
so
drastically
that
there
will
be
a
dearth
of
new
projects
coming
online
in
the
next
few
the
new
on
profitability
at
the
expense
of
growth
a
mantra
pressed
upon
oil
companies
by
restive
shareholders

keep

iea
has
repeatedly
warned
over
the
past
few
years
that
shale
growth
would
likely
plateau
in
the
which
means
that
the
world
would
be
right
back
to
where
it
started
dependent
on
nations
in
the
middle
east
there
are
some
shale
boosters
that
see
nothing
but
sunny
days
ahead
for
shale
but
a
lot
of
other
market
watchers
see
shale
flattening
out
in
the
next
decade
before
entering
into
an
extended
period
of
decline
after
that
as
the
iea
has
argued
the
middle
east
will
once
again
be
the
supplier
of
last
resort
related
how
bad
is
iran
s
oil
situation
the
problem
is
that
the
supply
crunch
might
be
so
severe
that
saudi
arabia
won
t
be
able
to
come
to
the
something
like
shale
is
not
going
to
really
create
a
major
dent
in
total
global
supply
requirements

said
in
an
interview
with

everybody

shale
growth
over
the
past
decade
has
been
so
explosive
that
it
helped
crash
oil
prices
in

the
supply
surge
masks
chronic
underinvestment

in
a
note
last

the
investment
manager
said
the
newfound
focus
on
profitability
which
has
led
a
long
list
of
oil
and
gas
companies
to
deprioritize
growth
could
create
the
conditions
for
a
major

investors
who
had
egged
on
management
teams
to
reign

capex
and

will
lament
the
underinvestment
in
the
industry
the
analysts
wrote
any

in
supply
will
result
in
a

potentially
much
larger

the

witnessed
in

bpdof
course
for
many
this
is
a
problem
for
another
day
the
oil
market
is
arguably
facing
a
supply
crisis
right
now
until
recently
the
oil
market
assumed
a
loss
of
about
from
iran
because
of
sanctions
but
statements
from
the
government
about
zero
tolerance
towards
iran
could
mean
that
those
losses
will
end
up
being
much
higher
just
by
shifting
the
supply
outages
from
to
would
translate
into
an
oil
price
increase
of
about
to
per
barrel
according
to
bank
of
america
merrill
we
estimate
that
every
million
shift
in
supply
and
demand
balances
would
push
the
oil
price
by
on
average
so
based
on
those
assumptions
we
estimate
zero
iran
exports
could
push
oil
up
by
if
saudi
caps
out
we
expect
in
this
game
of
chicken
someone
will
blink
before
that
in
other
words
if
saudi
arabia
is
unable
to
plug
the
deficit
the
would
likely
have
to
back
down
on
its
zero
tolerance
policy
towards
iran
the
oil
market
is
too
tight
and
the
supply
gap
would
be
too
large
cutting
iran
exports
by
that
much
in
an
increasingly
tight
oil
market
would
send
prices
skyrocketing
something
that
the
trump
administration
probably
won
t
be
able
to
stomach
if
trump
proceeded
a
price
spike
of
that
magnitude
would
lead
to
a
meltdown
