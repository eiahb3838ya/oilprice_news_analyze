european oil demand is shockingly weak
one
of
the
unexpectedly
soft
spots
in
global
oil
demand
recently
has
been
in
be
sure
europe
was
never
expected
to
be
a
major
driver
of
oil
demand
growth
consumption
has
been
mostly
flat
for
a
long
time
however
demand
has
actually
declined
in
the
past
few
months
which
suggests
a
slowdown
in
the
european
glaringly
demand
in
germany
has
fallen
significantly
according
to
standard
chartered
demand
in
germany
fell
by
bpd
in
december
compared
to
a
year
earlier
that
was
the
tenth
consecutive
month
of
an
annual
decline
in
consumption
in
excess
of
november
germany
seemed
to
be
the
only
source
of
fragility
but
in
december
the
weakness
popped
up
in
many
more
european
countries
according
to
standard
chartered
in
december
declines
in
consumption
were
reported
in
overall
in
oecd
europe
demand
plunged
by
a
staggering
bpd
in
december
standard
chartered
argues
that
the
main
threat
to
global
oil
demand
and
oil
prices
comes
from
europe
not
china
too
is
a
source
of
demand
weakness
more
than
a
handful
of
metrics
point
to
an
economic
slowdown
including
negative
pmi
numbers
a
decline
in
car
sales
and
slowing
imports
and
exports
the
outcome
of
the
trade
negotiations
will
go
a
long
way
to
deciding
what
happens
next
for
now
the
evidence
seems
to
suggest
that
both
the
american
and
chinese
governments
are
eager
to
make
a
deal
related
the
world
s
largest
battery
to
power
the
permianhowever
major
oil
forecasters
have
had
to
slightly
lower
their
demand
estimates
for
this
year
after
previously
holding
them
steady
opec
lowered
its
estimate
by
bpd
while
the
eia
made
a
similar
revision
the
big
question
is
if
these
changes
were
or
the
start
of
more
chartered
puts
out
a
weekly
index
which
offers
a
gauge
on
market
sentiment
the
latest
reading
was
a
a
huge
swing
from
the
week
before
and
the
most
negative
reading
since
december
the
main
source
of
weakness
came
from
the
implied
demand
readings
which
were
lower
for
all
seven
main
product
groupings
and
lower
than
the
average
of
february
for
all
products
except
propane
the
investment
bank
assuming
demand
estimates
remain
mostly
unchanged
they
stand
in
contrast
to
the
ongoing
upward
revisions
to
supply
specifically
shale
growth
the
eia
came
out
with
a
whopping
revision
of
bpd
to
supply
growth
for
expecting
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
a
separate
report
the
drilling
productivity
report
the
eia
expects
the
to
add
another
bpd
in
march
compared
to
february
another
massive
jump
in
output
the
gains
are
led
by
the
permian
basin
bpd
with
smaller
additions
from
demand
combined
with
production
from
shale
presents
serious
downside
risks
to
the
oil
market
the
upswing
in
oil
prices
appears
to
have
ended
for
now
it
seems
that
the
sharp
rise
in
oil
production
in
the
us
is
having
a
slowing
effect
after
all
commerzbank
wrote
in
a
note
on
an
underestimated
niche
in
oil
gas
production
at
the
permian
basin
the
largest
shale
play
is
set
to
exceed
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
first
time
in
march
as
such
this
shale
play
alone
significantly
exceeds
the
amounts
produced
by
the
united
arab
emirates
brazil
and
kuwait
only
five
countries
produce
more
oil
than
the
permian
basin
excluding
the
us
commerzbank
these
gains
are
largely
baked
in
at
this
point
the
shale
complex
still
has
some
glaring
problems
shale
companies
are
not
uniformly
profitable
in
fact
many
are
not
profitable
at
all
investors
are
increasingly
demanding
production
restraint
in
favor
of
shareholder
returns
that
still
could
slow
if
the
drilling
treadmill
ever
slows
down
growth
will
take
a
hit
the
production
frenzy
of
the
last
few
years
means
that
the
legacy
decline
rate
the
losses
from
existing
wells
already
online
has
also
exploded
in
march
the
permian
is
expected
to
lose
bpd
in
declines
from
legacy
wells
a
figure
that
has
doubled
since
the
start
of
to
be
sure
there
is
enough
new
output
bpd
to
ensure
a
net
gain
of
bpd
but
the
drilling
treadmill
has
accelerated
significantly
as
such
when
the
permian
hits
a
rough
patch
so
will
this
may
be
a
problem
for
another
day
the
drilling
frenzy
