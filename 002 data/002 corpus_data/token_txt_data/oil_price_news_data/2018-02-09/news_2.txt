the rise and fall of colombia’s shale industry
one
of
latin
america
s
most
stunning
tales
of
economic
development
in
recent
years
appears
doomed
to
come
to
a
bitter
s
reliance
upon
its
abundant
oil
and
gas
reserves
which
saw
production
surge
to
a
just
over
one
million
barrels

to
drive
its
economic
miracle

oil
reserves
of
a
mere
billion

and
an
eighth
of
brazil
s
reserves
compared
to
over
billion
barrels
at
the
end
of

believed
that
those
reserves
are
only
sufficient
to
support
another
five
years
of
production
at
the
current
rate
reported
for

has
sent
alarm
bells
ringing
in
bogota
where
oil
revenues
form
an
important
source
of

latin
american
nation
once
generated
roughly
a
fifth
of
its
national
income
from
oil
revenues
royalties
and
taxation
but
that
plummeted
to
nearly
zero
in
as
the
protracted
weakness
of
oil
heavily
impacted
investment
in
the
industry
as
well
as
exports
that
becomes
apparent
when
considering
that
export
income
from

plummeted

s
contribution

has
also
fallen

from

what

to
be

in
of
the
biggest
issues
that
bogota
is
facing
aside
from
dwindling
oil
reserves
is
that
there
have
been
no
major
oil
discoveries
since
the
caño
limón
field
in
that
has
further
amplified
fears
that
colombia
s
oil
wells
are
running
dry
in
the
latin
american
nation
s
office
of
the
comptroller
general
even
stated
given
the
historic
fall
in
reserves
at
the
existing
oil
fields
will
mark
the
end
of
the
country
s
oil
to
address
the
issue
the
santo
government
has
turned
to
unconventional
oil
exploration
and
fracking
to
boost
reserves
and
has
to
some
extent
been
inspired
by
argentina
s
successful
attempt
at
turning
around
its
own
ailing
energy
sector
when
the
de
kirchner
government
nationalized
ypf
and
pushed
for
a
focus
on
the
massive
shale
oil
and
gas
potential
of
the
vaca
muerta
in
shale
oil
and
gas
potential
exists
in
three
of
the
andean
nations
basins
the
middle
magdalena
llanos
and
catatumbo
basins
the
emerging
belief
among
industry
insiders
is
that
by
tapping
into
shale
oil
they
can
add
up
to
another
billion
barrels
of
reserves
most
of
the
unconventional
exploration
efforts
to
date
have
been
focused
on
the
middle
magdalena
and
it
s
believed
that
the
la
luna
shale
formation
which
is
believed
to
be
on
par
with
the
eagle
ford
shale
could
hold
up
to
billion
barrels
of
oil
put
that
in
perspective
that
s
almost
of
the
reserves
held
by
the
vaca
muerta
shale
field
which
has
been
proclaimed
to
be
the
third
largest
on
the
planet
if
the
potential
of
the
la
luna
can
be
truly
realized
it
will
be
