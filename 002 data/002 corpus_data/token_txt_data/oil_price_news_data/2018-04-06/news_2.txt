were
disrupted
by
the
stoppage
in
the

which
took
several

don
t
mean
anything
but
the
running
average

production
was
on
an
upward
trend
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
which
will
continue
through
barring
further
major
outages
while
natural

was
noticeably
declining

struggle
to
maintain

this
reserve
numbers
fell
for
both
oil
and
gas
with
few
discoveries
and
some
negative
adjustments
oil

production
will
decline
from

accelerated
falls
from
sometime
