largest oil consumers not in a rush to hedge crude
four
major
airlines
have
said
they
have
no
plans
to
hedge
fuel
deliveries
despite
higher
oil
prices
these
include
delta
american
united
and
dubai
s
emirates
this
may
suggest
the
airlines
do
not
believe
the
current
price
increase
will
be
a
resilient
one
on
the
other
hand
for
at
least
one
of
the
airlines
it
s
just
how
they
do
we
have
not
hedged
since
the
merger
and
our
philosophy
has
not
changed
we
are
the
largest
purchaser
of
jet
fuel
and
we
think
we
would
be
bidding
against
ourselves
the
market
is
quite
thin
beyond
months
said
american
airlines
managing
director
and
assistant
treasurer
amelia
anderson
speaking
at
a
panel
during
the
airline
economics
conference
in
s
ceo
tony
fernandes
shares
the
sentiment
in
a
bloomberg
interview
he
said
that
after
airlines
have
had
to
deal
with
wti
at
over
us
a
barrel
wti
at
us
is
still
a
honeymoon
fernandes
added
that
the
airline
is
not
worried
about
the
future
price
developments
because
of
the
strong
shale
production
the
oil
demand
outlook
and
the
gas
demand
comments
of
the
airline
executives
come
on
the
heels
of
imf
s
latest
world
economic
outlook
which
forecast
the
world
s
economy
will
grow
by
percent
a
upward
revision

unmoved
by
oil
price
surgea
growing
global
economy
will
certainly
mean
greater
demand
for
oil
which
would
support
higher
prices
in
fact
bloomberg
s
oil
strategist
julian
lee
says
quoting
energy
aspects
analysts
that
we
could
next
year
see
brent
at
us
a
barrel
albeit
briefly
if
new
production
outside
of
the
united
states
declines
what
with
the
ongoing
production
cuts
across
opec
and
energy
consultancy
is
much
more
bullish
than
others
about
oil
demand
it
sees
it
growing
by
to
million
bpd
in
which
is
in
tune
with
imf
s
economic
outlook
yet
this
rosy
outlook
might
fail
to
materialize
precisely
because
of
prices
the
higher
they
are
the
less
firm
the
demand
growth
will
be
in
this
context
it
would
make
sense
for
airlines
to
not
rush
to
hedge
fuel
