argentina is on the cusp of a shale boom
the

has
heralded
in

the

in
ousting
his
mercurial
populist
peronist
predecessor

since
coming
to

macri
has
worked
to

a
shattered
economy
ruined
by
decades
of
market
warping
tariffs
and

protectionism

rampant
inflation
and
unsustainable
fiscal
president
has
been
able
to
achieve
what
no
one
thought
possible
halving
inflation
from
what
independent
sources
claimed
had
reached
as
high
as
a
percent
to
near
a
more
manageable
percent
this
helped
stimulate
economic
growth
by
stabilizing
the
financial
system
and
allowing
the
to
borrow
again
this
along
with
macri
dismantling
stringent
currency

and
capital
controls
has
reinvigorated
the
interest
of
foreign
investors
in
the
latin

helped
power
the

stock
market
boom
in
the
world
with
the
argentine
bourse
rising
by
an
incredible

in

during
that
trend
should
continue
as

focuses
on
rebuilding
argentina

and
seeks
to
capitalize
on
the

s
enormous
unconventional

of
macri
s
most
significant
achievements
was
ending
the
complex
system
of
domestic
oil
tariffs
and

introduced
by
the
kirchner
administration
these
distorted
local
prices
led
to
considerable
underinvestment
in
the
energy
industry
and
saw
argentina
become
a
net
energy
importer
despite
its
tremendous
unconventional
oil
and

rewards
are
substantial
considering
that
argentina

come
to

the

this
