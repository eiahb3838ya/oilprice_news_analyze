alberta intervenes to halt canadaâ€™s oil crisis
oil
prices
rose
on
monday
buoyed
by
coordinated
production
cuts
cuts
that
did
not
come
from
vienna
although
that
too
could
occur
later
this
week
the
mandatory
reductions
were
handed
down
by
the
provincial
government
of
alberta
perhaps
opec
should
therefore
consider
inviting
canada
to
its
meeting
on
friday
commerzbank
said
in
a
premier
rachel
notley
announced
the
production
cuts
in
response
to
the
historically
high
oil
price
differential
that
is
costing
the
national
economy
more
than
million
per
day
her
office
said
in
a
statement
western
canada
select
wcs
has
plunged
below
per
barrel
representing
a
discount
to
wti
that
has
hovered
at
around
per
the
price
gap
is
caused
by
the
federal
government
s
inability
to
build
pipelines
ottawa
s
failure
in
this
area
has
left
alberta
s
energy
producers
with
few
options
to
move
their
products
resulting
in
serious
risks
for
the
energy
industry
and
alberta
jobs
the
alberta
premier
s
office
s
oil
industry
is
producing
roughly
bpd
in
excess
of
available
takeaway
capacity
the
surplus
is
filling
storage
up
quickly
oil
producers
will
be
required
to
make
cuts
on
the
order
of
percent
or
bpd
beginning
in
january
once
the
storage
glut
is
reduced
the
cuts
will
narrow
to
just
bpd
which
will
stay
in
place
through
the
duration
of
first
bpd
for
each
producer
will
be
excluded
from
the
mandatory
cuts
intended
to
avoid
negatively
impacting
small
producers
the
baseline
used
to
calculate
the
cuts
will
be
the
highest
level
of
production
for
each
producer
over
the
past
six
expects
the
production
cuts
to
boost
prices
for
wcs
by
roughly
per
barrel
adding
billion
to
government
revenue
between
and
related
why
we
should
worry
about
low
oil
pricesthe
provincial
government
went
to
lengths
to
describe
the
measure
as
temporary
and
one
that
will
be
a
benefit
to
government
finances
every
albertan
owns
the
energy
resources
in
the
ground
and
we
have
a
duty
to
defend
those
resources
but
right
now
they
re
being
sold
for
pennies
on
the
dollar
notley
production
cuts
come
just
days
after
notley
said
that
her
government
was
considering
paying
for
increased
rail
capacity
in
order
to
relieve
the
bottlenecks
that
additional
rail
would
add
bpd
in
takeaway
capacity
but
wouldn
t
be
available
for
another
year
and
would
take
time
to
scale
s
line
replacement
project
is
expected
to
be
completed
at
the
end
of
which
will
offer
the
first
significant
increase
in
takeaway
capacity
however
since
that
is
still
a
rather
long
time
to
wait
particularly
with
wcs
having
dropped
close
to
per
barrel
the
provincial
government
clearly
felt
it
had
to
extraordinary
intervention
into
the
market
was
supported
by
some
top
canadian
oil
executives
some
producers
had
already
been
slightly
curtailing
output
in
recent
weeks
because
of
painfully
low
prices
but
there
is
a
problem
that
goes
into
this
thinking
any
effort
to
cut
output
by
one
company
only
stands
to
benefit
another
as
such
some
oil
executives
argued
that
only
government
action
could
provide
an
orderly
way
to
reduce
output
to
narrow
price
differentials
related
new
breakthrough
will
change
how
oil
reserves
are
measured
while
curtailments
have
been
used
before
by
previous
governments
we
believe
they
should
only
be
used
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
only
in
extreme
cases
said
a
statement
by
cenovus
ceo
alex
pourbaix
this
is
an
extreme
case
it
makes
no
sense
for
alberta
to
stand
by
while
its
valuable
oil
resources
sell
for
next
to
nothing
the
provincial
treasury
loses
up
to
million
dollars
a
day
job
losses
continue
to
mount
and
our
industry
suffers
billions
of
dollars
in
value
the
largest
impact
could
come
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
reductions
will
erase
some
of
the
inventory
overhang
allowing
the
cuts
to
be
phased
out
more
rail
capacity
could
ease
the
midstream
burden
as
well
we
interpret
the
phrasing
of
the
announced
cut
as
keeping
production
down
in
and
below
our
prior
assessment
with
the
greatest
impact
on
down
before
new
rail
capacity
gradually
comes
online
from
april
onward

a
s
worth
noting
that
years
of
pipeline
fights
from
environmental
groups
local
communities
and
first
nations
are
bearing
some
fruit
the
inability
to
build
a
major
pipeline
has
put
a
ceiling
on
midstream
capacity
and
the
bottleneck
has
swelled
over
time
ultimately
leading
to
the
latest
announcement
from
alberta
ordering
the
shutdown
of
some
oil
supply
industry
groups
and
pundits

protestors
declaring
that
the

would
find
its
way
to
the
market
one
way
or
another
however
pipeline
delays
and
logjams
are
