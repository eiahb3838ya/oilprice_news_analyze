washington
may
be
nearing
a
decision
on
extending
sanctions
against
venezuela
to
include
imports
of
venezuelan
crude
and
exports
of
refined
products
to
the
troubled
south
american
s
what
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
said
during
a
visit
to
argentina
adding
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
considering
sanctioning
oil
is
what
effect
would
it
have
on
the
venezuelan
people
is
it
a
step
that
might
bring
this
to
an
end
more
rapidly
current
sanctions
target
separate
individuals
from
the
nicolas
maduro
government
as
well
as
a
ban
on
banks
and
other
institutions
buying
venezuelan
debt
venezuela
has
traditionally
been
an
important
exporter
of
oil
to
the
united
states
which
made
washington
wary
of
playing
the
oil
import
ban
has
been
struggling
to
rein
in
the
decline
of
its
crude
oil
production
resulting
from
underinvestment
mismanagement
and
most
recently
sanctions
last
october
crude
oil
production
fell
to
the
lowest
level
in
nearly

as

itself
unable

who
are
now
refusing
to

has
made
buyers
less
willing
to

the
trump
administration
last
mentioned
an
oil
import
ban
as
a
possible
scenario
last
july
ahead
of
a
constitutional
assembly
vote
that
was
widely
seen
as
aimed
at
cementing
maduro
and
his
government
in
power
despite
the
economic
crisis
that
has
been
ravaging
the
country
since
oil
prices
started
falling
in
at
the
time
venezuelan
exports
were
still
considerable

in
the
first
week
of
july

showed
however
by
november
this
had
fallen

and
further
