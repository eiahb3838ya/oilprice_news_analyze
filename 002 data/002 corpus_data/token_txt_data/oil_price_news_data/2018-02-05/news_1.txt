opec crude exports to the u.s. remain choppy
back
at
the
start
of
december
we
discussed
how
venezuelan
crude
deliveries
to
the
were
sliding
and
particularly
to
citgo
refineries
december
ended
up
being
the
lowest
level
of
venezuelan
grades
to
the
on
our
records
as
total
venezuelan
crude
exports
dropped
under
million
barrels
per
total
venezuelan
exports
and
flows
to
the
have
rebounded
in
january
but
flows
to
the
are
still
below
the
first
eleven
months
of
last
year
certain
refiners
such
as
pbf
are
still
shirking
venezuelan
crude
amid
quality
concerns
with
no
deliveries
to
pbf
chalmette
refinery
in
january
for
the
first
month
since
at
least
the
flip
side
valero
refineries
and
specifically
port
arthur
and
st
charles
accounted
for
percent
of
venezuelan
deliveries
to
the
last
month
after
averaging
less
than
percent
in
while
deliveries
to
citgo
refineries
clambered
back
above
the

for

the

has
received
deliveries

discussed
last

how
the
port
arthur
refinery
had
somewhat
ironically
been
pulling

increasing
volumes

saudi
arabia
made
a
conscious
effort

cut
flows

four
consecutive
months

saw
a

the
recovery
seen
in
saudi
flows
to
motiva
in
recent

is
reflective
of
a
modest
rebound
in
total
saudi
crude
to
shores
after
dropping
below
iraqi
deliveries
in
october
for
the
first
month
since
imports
are
higher

said

remain

they
were
