evidence mounts for shale slowdown
there
is
a
growing
pile
of
evidence
pointing
to
a
slowdown
in
the
shale
industry
as
low
prices
take
their
rate
of
hydraulic
fracturing
began
to
decline
in
the
last
four
months
of
a
sign
that
shale
activity
began
to
slow
even
before
the
plunge
in
oil
prices
according
to
rystad
energy
the
average
number
of
fracking
jobs
declined
to
per
day
in
november
down
from
an
average
of
between
and
for
the
period
between
april
and
august
after
reaching
a
peak
in
fracking
activity
in
the
permian
basin
has
gradually
decelerated
throughout
the
second
half
of
rystad
energy
senior
analyst
lai
lou
said
in
a
looking
at
preliminary
data
for
november
we
see
evidence
that
seasonal
activity
deceleration
has
likely
started
in
all
major
plays
except
eagle
ford
lou
added
there
has
been
a
considerable
slowdown
in
bakken
and
niobrara
in
november
our
analysis
rystad
said
that
much
of
the
slowdown
can
be
attributed
to
smaller
drilling
data
echoes
that
of
the
dallas
fed
which
reported
last
week
that
drilling
activity
began
to
slow
in
the
permian

the
fourth
quarter

production

not

many
analysts
are
still
predicting

very
few

this

still
struck
a

overshot
