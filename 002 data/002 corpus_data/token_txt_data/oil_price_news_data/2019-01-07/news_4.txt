energy experts are watching this hotspot in 2019
historically
the
mediterranean
hasn
t
been
the
focus
of
oil
and
gas
producing
companies
with
the
exception
of
algeria
and
libya
which
owe
their
energy
industry
to
the
sahara
region
recent
discoveries
however
have
put
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
the
spotlight
in
the
case
of
cyprus
the
unresolved
division
of
the
island
and
overlapping
claims
with
turkey
have
created
an
extra
layer
of
complexity
when
it
comes
to
attracting
international
energy
companies
despite
close
political
relations
between
qatar
and
turkey
qatar
petroleum
has
joined
exxonmobil
in
a
joint
venture
concerning
gas
exploration
in
the
eez
of
cyprus
ankara
however
has
remained
strikingly
silent
on
doha
s
potential
of
the
eastern
mediterraneanover
the
years
major
natural
gas
discoveries
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
have
turned
the
fortunes
of
the
littoral
states
especially
israel
stands
to
benefit
as
almost
all
of
its
energy
needs
are
met
by
foreign
producers
such
as
russia
and
azerbaijan
the
recently
discovered
gas
fields
in
its
eez
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
country
s
needs
while
at
the
same
time
surplus
gas
is
exported
egypt
on
the
other
hand
became
a
net
importer
of
lng
in
due
to
rising
consumption
and
a
slump
in
domestic
production
the
discovery
of
the
massive
zohr
gas
field
has
significantly
changed
cairo
s
energy
outlook
egypt
is
slated
to
become
a

february

announced
the
discovery
of
the
calypso
gas
field
in
cyprus
eez
which
confirms
the
extension
of
the
zohr
like
play
this
find
was
especially
significant
for
nicosia
as
it
makes
it
more
likely
that
cypriot
gas
can
be
developed
on
its
own
previous
discoveries
such
as
aphrodite
are
regarded
too
small
which
needed
to
be
aggregated
with
gas
in
order
to
become
profitable
cyprus
difficult
relations
with
turkey
and
the
northern
turkish
inhabitants
of
the
island
are
a
serious
impediment
for
the
quick
development
of
the
gas
playing
hardball
while
most
of
the
littoral
states
have
announced
multiple
discoveries
turkey
is
missing
out
ankara
has
put
pressure
on
gas
exploration
in
cypriot
waters
due
to
two
reasons
first
it
maintains
that
also
the
turkish
inhabitants
of
the
island
should
benefit
from
gas
production
second
the
turks
claim
certain
parts
of
cyprus
eez
due
to
the
apparent
extension
of
the
continental
shelf
for
this
reason

block
in
a
statement
the
turkish
government
has
said
exxonmobil
s
gas
exploration
in
the
block
licensed
by
south
cyprus
does
not
contribute
to
the
stability
of
the
country
or
the
region
and
may
change
specific
and
delicate
balances
in
relation
to
resolving
the
cyprus
issue
washington
however
has
warned
turkey
on
several
occasions
not
to
obstruct
nicosia
in
its
legitimate
actions
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
european
and
eurasian
affairs
wess
mitchell
said
turkey
view
on
the
gas
exploration
and
drilling
efforts
of
cyprus
is
a
minority
one
and
the
united
states
would
not
take
a
friendly
view
in
any
harassment
in
cypriot
waters
especially
those
involving
vessels
related
why
goldman
just
drastically
slashed
its
oil
price
predictiondespite
turkey
s
fierce
rhetoric
aimed
at
international
energy
companies
qatar
petroleum
has
escaped
ankara
s
ire
due
to
three
reasons
first
exxonmobil
is
the
lead
operator
while
qatar
petroleum
is
a
junior
partner
second
the
exploratory
ships
are
exxon
which
doha
does
have
much
say
over
lastly
and
most
importantly
drilling
is
taking
place
in
one
of
the
few
areas
which
are
claimed
by
turkey
opposition
to
qatar
participation
is
expressed
behind
closed
doors
as
long
as
doha
doesn
t
extend
its
cooperation
in
areas
which
are
more
difficult
to
ignore
by
ankara
the
turks
will
be
able
to
overlook
qatar
petroleum
cooperation
with
exxon
furthermore
turkey
is
also
aware
that
it
should
erode
doha
sovereignty
the
close
cooperation
between
the
countries
is
caused
by
the
saudi
led
bloc
blockade
of
qatar
and
its
attacks
on
the
tiny
country
sovereignty
therefore
for
now
ankara
will
remain
opposed
to
gas
production
in
cypriot
waters
while
avoiding
confrontation
with
qatar
over
its
economic
interests
