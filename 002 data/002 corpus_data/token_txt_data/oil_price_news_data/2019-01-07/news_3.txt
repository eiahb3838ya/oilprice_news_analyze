has u.s. fracking activity peaked already?

rystad

s
analysis
of
preliminary
data
conclude
that
nationwide
fracking
activity
was
mostly
stable
from
april
to
august
at
an
average
daily
level
of
to
fracked
wells
however
the
fracking
rate
has
slipped
some
since
and
remains
between
and
in
the
period
of
september
to
november
after
reaching
a
peak
in
fracking
activity
in

gradually
decelerated

a
key
observation
is
that
as
we
move
into
november
there
is
evidence
that
seasonal
activity
deceleration
might
have
started
in
all
major
plays
except

lou
adds
there
has
been
a
considerable
slowdown
in
bakken
and
niobrara
in
november
based
on
our
the
latest
fracfocus
update
a
national
us
database
was
released
on
january
it
provides
sufficient
visibility
on
fracking
operations
across
the
us
in
november
yet
the
uncertainty
range
for
november
remains
significant
as
indicated
by
the
figure
major
operators
are
bucking
the
general
slowdown
the
largest
operator
exxonmobil
experienced
a
strong
uptick
in
october
making
it
one
of
the
months
with
the
highest
number
of
fracked
wells
in
this
period
energen

is
also
unaffected
by

in
general
many
of
the
key
operators
have
exhibited
a
largely
flat
trend
from
june
to
october
which
implies
that
the
deceleration
in
fracking
activity
has
a
more
significant
implication
for
smaller
operators
in
contrast
to
the
major
players
in
the
permian
lai
said
in
terms
of
absolute
numbers
the
reduction
in
the
number
of
jobs
for
top
operators
collectively
is
around
from
june
to
october
while
the
corresponding
percentage
for
the
remaining
operators
is
as
high
as
in

that
