sanalla
libya
s
output
currently
stands
at
bpd
that
s
less
than
what
the
country
produced
earlier
this
year
prior
to
the
latest
blockade
of
the
largest
field
sharara
which
removed
more
than
bpd
from
the
total
daily
average
however
it
s
more
than
what
libya
pumped
in
the
summer
when
violent
clashes
at
its
oil
terminals
crushed
oil
production
by
almost
half
from
the
million
bpd
earlier
in
the

which
noc
declared
force
majeure
in

yet
to
resume

security
conditions
for
workers
improve

incidents
such
as
the
blockade
by
tribesmen
and
members
of

discouraging
foreign

helping
it
to
expand
its
