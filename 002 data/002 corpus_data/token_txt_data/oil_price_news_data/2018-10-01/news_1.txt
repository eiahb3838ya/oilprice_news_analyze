the oil industry needs large new discoveries, very soon
market
participants
and
analysts
are
all
focused
on
the
imminent
oil
supply
gap
that
is
opening
with
the
sanctions
on
iran
just
five
weeks
beyond
the
shortest
term
a
larger
and
more
alarming
gap
in
global
oil
supply
is
forecast
that
unless
large
oil
discoveries
are
made
soon
the
world
could
be
short
of
oil
as
early
as
in
the
latest
such
prediction
comes
from
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
which
sees
a
supply
gap
opening
up
in
the
middle
of
the
next
decade
at
the
current
level
of
low
oil
discoveries
and
barring
technology
breakthrough
beyond
woodmac
s
assumptions
that
supply
gap
could
soar
to
million
bpd
by
to
million
bpd
by
and
to
as
much
as
million
bpd
by
s
not
that
discoveries
aren
t
being
made
they
just
aren
t
enough
to
offset
the
natural
decline
at
mature
fields
while
global
oil
demand
is
still
expected
to
continue
to
main
reason
for
lower
discoveries
is
that
spending
on
exploration
has
drastically
plunged
since
the
oil
price
crash
the
good
news
is
according
to
wood
mackenzie
that
the
volume
of
new
discoveries
is
correlated
with
spending
on
exploration
so
if
spend
were
to
increase
the
chance
of
more
and
major
oil
discoveries
gets
early
as
the
beginning
of
this
year
woodmac
said
that
the
share
of
exploration
of
upstream
investment
has
slipped
to
below
percent
since
and
is
not
about
to
recover
this
could
be
the
new
normal
with
the
days
of
one
dollar
in
six
or
seven
going
to
exploration
forever
in
the
past
the
consultancy
said
in
its
things
to
look
for
in
related
refiners
struggle
to
adapt
to
the
shale
boomover
the
past
year
however
exploration
seems
to
have
gotten
its
mojo
back
woodmac
said
in
june
noting
that
oil
discoveries
offshore
guyana
continued
to
deliver
more
oil
volumes
major
discoveries
were
made
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
well
as
on
the
mexican
side
of
the
gulf
by
shell
chevron
talos
and
dramatic
cut
in
spending
including
on
exploration
has
done
one
good
thing
to
the
forced
companies
to
realign
strategies
and
look
to
do
more
with
less
according
to
andrew
latham
vice
president
global
exploration
at
woodmac
this
will
be
the
first
time
in
a
decade
the
industry
has
actually
created
rather
than
destroyed
on
the
flip
side
the
oil
industry
is
now
finding
less
oil
and
gas
than
it
used
to
latham
fact
is
we
need
more
guyanas
a
lot
more
and
we
need
them
soon

production
boostthe
industry
basically
needs
to
replace
one
north
sea
each
year
as
the
world
needs
to
replace
million
bpd
of
supply
decline
from
mature
fields
while
global
oil
demand
continues
to
grow
at
a
robust
pace
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
in
its
oil
report
in
upstream
includes
exploration
just
started
to
rebound
from
the
lows
the
iea
said
in
its
report
on
world
energy
investment
in
the
oil
price
crash
investment
plummeted
in
and
from
the
peaks
in
but
last
year
s
investment
rebounded
by
percent
in
real
terms
the
iea
said
expecting
the
same
level
of
growth
this
year
as
are
still
keeping
very
tight
discipline
on
capital
expenditure
and
costs
and
are
looking
to
reward
shareholders
with
fatter
dividends
now
that
they
are
getting
more
cash
from
the
upstream
divisions
thanks
to
the
higher
oil
prices
but
the
industry
as
a
whole
can
t
afford
to
neglect
spending
on
exploration
because
a
supply
gap
may
be
lurking
just
around
