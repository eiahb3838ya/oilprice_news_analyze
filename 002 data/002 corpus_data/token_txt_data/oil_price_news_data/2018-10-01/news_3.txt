crown
prince

has
discussed
the
restart
of
crude
oil
production
in
the
neutral

between
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
during
a
meeting
with

ahead
of
the
sunday
visit
quoting

in

who

mohammed
was
accompanied
by
energy
minister
khalid
the
sources
also
oil
production
in
the
neutral
zone
was
suspended
in
but
earlier
this
month
the
financial
times
reported
that
the
two
countries
were
mulling
over
a
restart
amid
rising
oil
prices
and
the
matching
rise
in
worry
among
large
oil
neutral
zone
the
ft
reported
at
the
time
could
be
pumping
half
a
million
barrels
daily
in
a
few
months
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
which
would
add
to
more
than
million
bpd
of
saudi
production
and
almost
million
bpd
on
kuwaiti
production
based
on
the
latest
figures
for
talks
on
the
production
restart
come
despite
earlier
statements
from
that
saudi
arabia
does
not
see
the
need
for
higher
output
according
to
the
minister
the
market
was
near
balance
despite
the
rising
benchmarks
and
the
upcoming
sanctions
against
iran
now
it
seems
the
world
s
top
exporter
of
oil
has
had
a
change
of
arabia
is
considered
to
be
the
oil
producer
with
the
most
spare
capacity
among
opec
members
with
the
energy
information
administration
calculating
it
at
between
and
million
bpd
some
industry
observers
however
have
questioned
the
figures
which
are
defined
as
the
amount
of
daily
production
that
can
be
launched
within
days
and
sustained
for
at
least
days
according
to
venezuela
s
production
falling
consistently
and
the
iran
sanctions
as
well
as
iraq
s
difficulties
in
boosting
its
oil
production
opec
s
total
spare
capacity
is
now
estimated
to
be
just
million
bpd
this
quarter
according
to
a
different
estimate
this
certainly
raises
the
question
whether
the
cartel
can
boost
production
enough
to
rein
in
the
price
rise
ahead
of
the
sanctions
or
within
days
of
their
entry
into
irina
