the revival of mexico’s oil industry
over
the
past
decade
mexico
s
crude
oil
production
has
been
falling
due
to
a
natural
decline
at
mature
fields
and
a
lack
of
significant
to
compensate
over
the
past
years
mexico
has
opened
its
energy
sector
to
private
investment
ending
a
monopoly

its

opec
and
the
international

agency

expect
mexico
s
production
to
continue
to
fall
this
last
year
was
also
a
year
of
two
very
significant
oil
discoveries
in
mexico
a
huge
offshore
discovery
by
private
companies
a
first
in
years
and
a
large
onshore
discovery
by
its
landmark
energy
reform
from
mexico
now
hopes
to
attract
a
growing
number
of
international
companies
to
explore
its
offshore
waters
in
a
bid
to
offset
declining
production
and
fill
state
coffers

and

related
is
this
the
world
s
most
critical
pipeline
in
addition
there
is
some
uneasiness
about
a
political
risk
in
mexico
as
incumbent
president
enrique
pena
nieto
the
architect
of
the
energy
reform
is
completing
his
last
term
in
office
this
year
the
for
the
july
presidential
election
is
a
leftist
populist
candidate
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
who
has
pledged
to
hold
a
referendum
on
the
energy
reform
and
review
the
oil
contracts
with
international
firms
although
it
s
far
from
certain
that
obrador
would
entirely
undo
his
predecessor
s
reforms
there
s
industry
concern
that
the
mexican
market
could
present
some
difficulties
for
foreign
investors
or
that
an
obrador
presidency
could
create
uncertainties
in
the
regulatory
investment
opportunities
are
crucial
for
mexico
to
lift
its
crude
oil
production
pemex

the

of
pemex
has
seen
its
crude

drop
each

since
with
the
average
production
down
from
million
bpd
in

was
less

oil
supply
from
mexico
is
expected
to
have
dropped
by
bpd
annually
in
the
largest

decline
last
year
followed
by
china
mexico
s
production
decline
will
not
be
so
steep
this
year
according
to
opec
with
the
country
forecast
to
lose
just
bpd
of
oil
production
in
iea
also
expects
mexico
alongside
china
to
see
its
production
drop
this
year
but
strong
growth
from
the

increases
in
brazil
and
canada
are
expected
to
lead
to
a
total
production
increase
of
million
bpd
in
it
s
not
all
doom
and
gloom
in
mexico
s
oil
sector
last
summer
the
energy
reform
started
to
pay
off
when
a
consortium
including
foreign
companies
struck
oil
in
a
discovery
off
the
mexican
coast
with
initial
estimates
suggesting
that

of

the
largest

oil
and
estimated
volumes
similar
to
the
discovery
related
what
could
push

the
volume
of

hit
an
