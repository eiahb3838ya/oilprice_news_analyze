what happens next to chinaâ€™s crude imports?
our
friends
over
at
ursa
published
a
blog
post
yesterday
discussing
crude
inventories
at
kyaukphyu
in
myanmar
highlighting
the
seeming
political
nature
of
recent
crude
flows
to
the
storage
hub
crude
is
delivered
to
cnpc
kabala
terminal
in
myanmar
and
is
stored
at
kyaukphyu
before
being
transported
by
pipeline
to
the
yunnan
refinery
in
china
since
the
terminal
started
up
in
april
we
can
see
from
our
clipperdata
that
there
has
been
nearly
million
barrels
discharged
there
saudi
arabia
is
a
steady
supplier
accounting
for
about
a
half
of
all
crude
deliveries
and
mostly
arab
medium
with
volumes
averaging
about
a
vlcc
a
month
about
million
barrels

the
terminal
at
kyaukphyu
and
hence
the
yunnan
refinery
typically
imports
light
and
medium
sour
grades
including
uae
das
and
upper
zakum
qatari
al
shaheen
omani
export
crude
and
iraqi
basrah
light
but
has
also
imported
sweet
grades
including
angolan
girassol
and
azeri
light
as
the
chart
above
illustrates
a
couple
of
iranian
cargoes
have
been
delivered
in
the
last
few
months
including
bbls
of
light
sweet
south
pars
condensate
in
june
although
we
are
seeing
a
dip
this
month
in
total
iranian
barrels
into
china
it
is
expected
that
iran
will
increasingly
try
to
muscle
its
way
in
as
it
is
muscled
out
of
elsewhere
chinese
imports
of
iranian
barrels
are
at
bpd
through
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
after
running
closer
to
bpd
in
recent
years
central
china
typically
receives
the
most
but
flows
have
dropped
considerably
to
the
region
this
year
instead
heading
to
southern
and
northern
destinations
as
our
clipperdata
illustrate
below
iranian
grades
into
northern
chinese
ports
and
mostly
qingdao
rizhao
tianjin
caofeidian
and
dalian
have
been
on
the
rise
in
recent
years
averaging
over
bpd
so
far
this
year
related
indonesia
s
oil
sector
in
jeopardy
as
elections
loomrising
flows
into
northern
china
has
been
a
common
theme
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
with
total
imports
up
over
percent
on
a
basis
that
said
imports
have
dropped
off
considerably
since
may
after
the
government
changed
the
tax
structure
for
independent
refiners
nonetheless
iranian
imports
into
the
region
are
holding
up
for
of
crude
into
northern
china
on
the
other
hand
look
set
for
a
bout
of
weakness
nearly
a
half
of
crude
imports
to
china
make
their
way
to
the
independent
refiners
in
the
north
amid
the
threat
of
tariffs
and
trade
wars
flows
of
mostly
light
sweet
crude
wti
midland
wti
dsw
and
bakken
have
already
slowed
from
the
highs
of
while
this
lower
trend
should
persist
amid
tighter
price
spreads
iranian
crude
flows
should
continue
apace
