the “weakest” eia report in years
the
eia
just
published
one
of
the
weakest
weekly
oil
reports
in
years
which
suggests
troubled
waters
ahead
for
the
global
oil
timing
of
the
report
is
not
ideal
coming
amidst
a
currency
crisis
in
turkey
which
has
raised
fears
of
financial
contagion
in
other
emerging
markets
the
strength
of
the
dollar
is
putting
a
long
list
of
currencies
under
pressure
vexing
policymakers
around
the
world
some
countries
such
as
argentina
are
aggressively
hiking
interest
rates
to
defend
their
currencies
although
the
peso
continues
to
fall
others
such
as
turkey
are
resisting
any
rate
hikes
at
all
which
is
clearly
not
a
solution
to
capital
flight
and
a
sharp
is
too
early
to
tell
whether
or
not
the
sudden
crisis
will
be
confined
to
turkey
or
if
it
will
mushroom
into
an
emerging
market
conflagration
that
sends
emerging
markets
and
perhaps
even
the
global
economy
as
a
whole
into
a
currency
troubles
could
severely
undercut
global
oil
demand
not
only
are
crude
oil
prices
close
to
highs
but
the
strength
of
the
dollar
and
the
relative
weakness
of
a
variety
of
currencies
in
the
developing
world
combine
for
a
toxic
brew
to
demand
oil
prices
are
up
some
or
percent
on
the
year
but
in
turkey
imported
oil
is
now
percent
more
expensive
the
result
of
the
meltdown
in
the
the
specific
percentages
might
vary
from
country
to
country
much
of
the
world
is
experiencing
painful
increases
in
fuel
because
so
many
currencies
are
being
trampled
by
the
strength
of
the
early
signs
of
trouble
to
the
oil

are
starting

materialize

out
a
index
each

which
incorporates
the
latest
weekly
data
from
the
eia
the
index
tends
to
seesaw
back
and
forth
depending
on
whether
or
not
inventories
fell
whether
production
rose

fell

the

all
you
need
to
know

the
main
detail
is
that
total
commercial

rose

thumping

reuters
argues
that
the

is
a
red
flag
for
the
health
of
the

distillates

reflect

it

which
in

is
an
indication
that
global

with
the

brent
oil
futures
are
hovering
just
above
the
moving
average
which
forms
a
bit
of
a
resistance
preventing
oil

from
