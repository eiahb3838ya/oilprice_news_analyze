u.s. sanctions could be the final nail in the coffin for venezuelan oil
the
white
house
is
looking
at
slapping
sanctions
on
a
venezuelan
oil
services
company
while
also
restricting
insurance
for
oil
shipments
from
the
south
american
country
among
other
possible
measures
according
to
moves
come
as
the
venezuelan
president
nicolas
maduro
is
planning
elections
for
april
which
few
expect
to
be
free
or
fair
unlike
prior
elections
the
upcoming
race
will
likely
be
met
with
global
condemnation
and
many
countries
could
refuse
to
recognize
the
results
election
would
be
the
latest
move
by
president
maduro
to
tighten
his
grip
on
the
nation
having
already
neutered
much
of
the
country
s
democratic
institutions
but
because
of
the
nature
of
an
essentially
rigged
presidential
election
washington
is
planning
more
or
when
such
measures
are
implemented
is
still
unclear
a
official
told
reuters
that
the
moves
could
come
in
waves
with
some
sanctions
coming
before
the
election
and
others
after
either
way
the
more
aggressive
the
action
the
more
it
will
take
a
bite
out
of
venezuela
s
oil
sector
while
also
likely
spreading
misery
among
the
venezuelan
few
options
have
been
on
the
table
more
minor
steps
would
consist
of
sanctions
on
individuals
within
the
maduro
government
although
that
has
already
been
tried
a
bit
with
little
effect
a
more
serious
option
would
be
to
prohibit
the
export
of
light
oil
and
diluents
to
venezuela
fuels
that
are
used
to
blend
in
which
venezuela
s
heavy
oil
this
shipments
have
already
been
down
because
of
a
lack
of
cash
at
pdvsa
related
gasoline
consumption
falls
for
the
first
time
in
five
yearsanother
option
would
be
to
ban
venezuelan
oil
into
the
these
flows
have
also
already
declined
although
that
has
more
to
do
with
the
overall
decline
in
venezuelan
production
still
a
ban
would
have
and
dire
implications
venezuela
could
reroute
shipments
to
india
or
china
but
those
sales
would
likely
only
occur
at
a
hefty
oil
sanctions
are
not
taken
lightly
the
official
told
reuters
this
would
be
a
fairly
strong
escalation
for
policy
whether
it
s
a
complete
oil
sanction
or
salami
slices
of
different
graduated
last
year
the
banned
american
banks
from
issuing
or
restructuring
debt
with
the
venezuelan
government
or
pdvsa
the
measures
have
made
it
difficult
for
venezuela
to
deal
with
its
mountain
of
debt
and
many
analysts
say
the
financial
screws
have
contributed
to
the
steep
declines
in
oil
another
option
would
be
to
target
the
insurance
of
oil
tankers
carrying
venezuelan
crude
a
tactic
used
against
iran
several
years
ago
and
widely
cited
as
a
major
reason
why
iranian
oil
exports
fell
this
too
would
probably
severely
curtail
oil
effect
on
the
oil
market
would
be
significant
i
think
it
would
cause
a
fairly
strong
shock
to
the
oil
market
in
the
short
term
the
official
said
venezuela
s
oil
production
is
already
expected
to
continue
to
decline
barclays
expects
output
to
average
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
down
from
in
related
deal
could
restore
oil
productionhowever
measures
from
the
could
make
that
pretty
awful
forecast
look
optimistic
oil
sanctions
in
one
form
or
another
would
likely
lead
to
severe
production
losses
secretary
of
state
rex
tillerson
suggested
that
sales
of
oil
from
the
spr
could
offset
the
nail
in
the
coffin
would
be
some
form
of
withdrawal
by
venezuela
s
joint
venture
partners
a
new
report
from
columbia
university
which
summarizes
a
december
panel
event
noted
that
venezuela
s
production
is
in
a
death
spiral
and
that
production
declines
have
spread
from
operations
to
those
of
the
joint
ventures
which
have
held
up
until
foreign
operators
lost
confidence
after
pdvsa
which
for
years
had
failed
to
meet
its
full
budgetary
requirements
reportedly
stopped
making
all
payments
into
the
jvs
budgets
the
report
concluded
having
reduced
capex
foreign
operators
are
effectively
limiting
their
exposure
and
cutting
back
on
operations
production
looks
set
to
plummet
