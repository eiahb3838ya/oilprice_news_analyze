major build in crude inventories sends prices tumbling
crude
oil
inventories
went
up
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
january
the
energy
information
administration
said
in
its
latest
weekly
petroleum
status
million
barrels
these
were
about
percent
above
seasonal
limits
the
authority
said
a
day
after
the
american
petroleum
institute
estimated
inventories
had
risen
by
million
barrels
which
apparently
surprised
market
players
as
do
most
api
weekly
inventory
releases
these
fuels
the
eia
reported
a
build
of
million
barrels
for
gasoline
and
a
decline
of
barrels
for
distillate
fuel
this
compares
with
a
increase
for
gasoline
inventories
a
week
earlier
and
a
barrel
build
in
production
averaged
million
barrels
daily
last
week
and
distillate
fuel
production
averaged
million
bpd
down
from
million
bpd
the
previous
week
refineries
processed
an
average
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
in
the
reporting
period
versus
million
bpd
in
the
previous
prices
began
to
settle
this
week
despite
persistent
worry
about
the
global
economy
after
reports
emerged
that
asian
government
were
considering
fiscal
stimulus
measure
in
anticipation
of
the
forecast
from
the

information
administration
that
shale

production
will
continue
growing
acted
as
a
tailwind
for
wti
countering
warnings
from
elsewhere
that
shale
growth
will
slow
down
this
year
the
eia
expects
production
to
grow
by
million
bpd
with
the
rise
slowing
down
further
in
to
million
bpd
the
agency
said
in
its
latest
energy
outlook
released
last
week
meanwhile
other
forecasts
from
the
iea
and
opec
also
see
oil
leading
the
rise
in
supply
this
year
but
they
also
see
global
demand
stable
at
million
and
million
