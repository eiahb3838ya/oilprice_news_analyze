canadian heavy crude producers find new ways to ship oil
when
alberta
premier
rachel
notley
announced
obligatory
production
cuts
of
bpd
in
december
in
a
bid
to
tackle
a
deep
discount
between
western
canadian
select
and
west
texas
intermediate
the
market
s
reaction
was
promising
the
price
of
canadian
crude
jumped
up
immediately
and
has
been
trending
higher
ever
since
now
that
the
cuts
actually
came
into
effect
but
local
oil
producers
are
not
relaxing
they
are
looking
for
ways
to
cut
their
costs
further
by
reducing
transportation
expenses
and
they
are
employing
new
technology
to
do
s
kevin
orland
reported
earlier
this
week
that
meg
energy
was
working
on
commercializing
a
proprietary
method
of
partial
upgrading
that
eliminates
the
need
to
add
diluent
to
the
alberta
bitumen
so
it
can
be
transported
by
pipeline
the
technology
as
described
by
orland
involves
a
process
that
entails
removing
and
recycling
some
diluent
used
in
its
initial
processing
separating
out
the
lighter
and
heavier
portions
of
the
bitumen
then
removing
solid
materials
known
as
meg
is
not
alone
in
its
push
cenovus
energy
and
husky
energy
are
also
testing
their
own
methods
of
reducing
diluent
demand
they
all
have
a
good
reason
for
this
diluents
are
typically
light
crude
fractions
and
light
fractions
are
expensive
and
that
s
just
the
costs
are
multiple
and
include
the
cost
of
transporting
it
from
its
place
of
origin
to
where
it
would
be
added
to
the
bitumen
then
stripping
it
off
the
bitumen
upon
arrival
at
its
destination
transporting
it
to
a
diluent
collection
hub
and
from
there
back
to
its
producer
all
these
costs
really
being
to
burn
when
you
factor
in
the
proportion
of
bitumen
to
diluent
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
oil
to
flow
through
a
pipeline
this
ratio
is

this
state
of
affairs
the
pipeline
capacity
shortage
might
actually
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
at
least
in
some
aspects
for
one
thing
bitumen
does
not
need
diluting
to
be
loaded
on
rail
cars
and
that
s
some
cost
savings
for
another
undiluted
bitumen
is
much
harder
to
spill
or
leak
so
from
a
certain
perspective
transporting
oil
by
rail
might
in
fact
be
safer
than
pipeline
transportation
and
there
is
research
aimed
at
enhancing
both
of
these
for
example
a
canadian
engineer
and
his
team
accidentally
discovered
a
way
that
could
make
transporting
heavy
alberta
crude
by
rail
much
more
safely
in
fact
the
bitumen
pellets
that
ian
gates
and
his
came
up
with
could
make
oil
transportation
safer
than
method
which
involves
applying
heat
and
pressure
to
the
bitumen
turns
bitumen
into
pellets
with
a
highly
viscous
coating
and
a
liquid
core
the
process
is
as
costly
as
adding
diluent
to
the
heavy
crude
however
which
is
probably
why
it
hasn
t
yet
been
adopted
on
a
large
scale

for

to

on

it
will
probably
be
a
while
before
we
see
any
meaningful
if
you
look

technology
certainly
it
could
