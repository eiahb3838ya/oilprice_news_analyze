how much spare capacity does saudi arabia really have?
saudi
arabia
has
pledged
to
cover
any
supply
gap
that
may
emerge
as
iranian
oil
goes
offline
but
how
much
spare
capacity
does
it
really
have
the
massive
reserve
of
spare
capacity
located
in
the
saudi
desert
is
the
stuff
of
legend
taken
as
gospel
in
the
world
of
oil
after
all
saudi
arabia
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
can
ramp
up
or
down
millions
of
barrels
of
production
on
short
notice
and
the
saudis
have
never
let
us
saudi
arabia
s
mythical
spare
capacity
may
finally
be
tested
saudi
officials
insist
that
they
can
produce
up
to
between
and
million
barrels
per
day
if
needed
with
output
at
about
in
august
the
latest
month
for
which
data
is
available
that
suggests
that
they
have
around
to
of
spare
everyone
buys
that
figure
indeed
the
precise
amount
of
spare
capacity
has
been
the
subject
of
much
debate
for
years
and
even
decades
now
because
iranian
supply
is
going
offline
at
a
rapid
clip
the
world
may
soon
find
out
if
saudi
arabia
s
confidence
is
backed
up
by
reality
or
if
it
has
all
been
a
bunch
of
eia
says
that
total
opec
spare
capacity
is
set
to
average
in
the
fourth
quarter
which
is
rather
low
by
historical
standards
the
eia
sees
opec
spare
capacity
falling
to

the
fourth
quarter
of

a
few
times
in
the
relatively
recent
past
when
spare
capacity
was
that
low
including
two
years
ago
when
spare
capacity
plunged
to
however
this
was
during
the
depths
of
the
oil
market
downturn
and
it
was
a
reflection
of
saudi
arabia
producing

in
order
to
flood
the
market
in
an
attempt
to
edge

that
industry
executives
privately
said
on

conference

saudi
arabia
can
even
produce

that
oil
inventories
controlled
by
saudi

have
been
falling

saud

has
burned
through
around
million
barrels
over
the
past
three
years
cutting
stockpiles
from
million
barrels
in
to
million
as
of

that
essentially
means
that
buyers
have
been
demanding
more
oil
than
saudi
arabia
was
producing
so
it
needed
to
dip
into
storage
now
the
cushion
is
much
smaller
saudi

khalid
said
recently
that
they
were
topping
up
storage
facilities
around
the
world
in
order
to
serve
customers
as
iranian
supply
goes
offline
but
that
has
yet
to
show
up

no
consensus
on
this
question
of
spare

and
to
be
sure
some
do
in
fact
have
faith
in
saudi
arabia
s
abilities
we
believe
that
there
remains
suf

even
if

using

carries
