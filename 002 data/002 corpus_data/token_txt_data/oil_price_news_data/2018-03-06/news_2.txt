nigeria can produce oil at $20 a barrel
the
nigerian
national
petroleum
corporation
can
produce
crude
oil
at
around
us
a
barrel
but
there
are
plans
to
bring
this
even
lower
to
us
a
barrel
the
company
s
group
managing
director
maikanti
baru
told
media
the
more
we
bring
down
the
cost
the
more
the
money
that
comes
to
the
federal
government
and
into
the
pockets
of
state
and
local
governments
baru
has
pledged
to
keep
its
oil
production
at
million
barrels
daily
after
opec
asked
it
to
join
the
cut
efforts
to
bring
down
the
global
inventory
overhang
yet
independent
local
producers
are
eager
to
boost
their
production
by
bpd
by
that
s
part
of
a
plan
to
bring
nigeria
s
total
to
million
barrels
daily
at
such
low
production
costs
the
urge
to
expand
production
makes
perfect
independents
plans
go
counter
to
nigeria
s
pledge
to
support
opec
in
its
oversupply
reduction
efforts
but
this
doesn
t
seem
to
have
deterred
the
independents
nigeria
s
plans
are
for
a
total
increase
in
production
by
how
this
will
sit
with
opec
is
anyone
s
guess
especially
now
after
the
iea
warned
that
new
supply
would
be
enough
to
cover
the
growth
in
oil
demand
globally
in
the
next
five
years
related
trump
s
trade
wars
could
spark
a
massive
drop
in
oilmeanwhile
however
nigeria
is
having
serious
trouble
with
the
supply
of
refined
oil
products
the
country
has
been
suffering
serious
fuel
shortages
and
has
been
negotiating
with
two
consortia
to
overhaul
its
subpar
refineries
currently
the
country
imports
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
fuels
because
local
refineries
can
not
cope
with
overhaul

promised
by
president
muhammadu
buhari

he

into

since
then
there
has
been
more
talk
than
