how far can venezuela’s oil production fall
venezuela
s
oil
production
continues
to
plummet
and
some
of
the
dire
production
scenarios
for
the
south
american
nation
are
no
longer
looking
as
remote
as
they
once
compliance
remained
elevated
in
january
halting
a
slide
in
oil
prices
even
as
new
data
reveals
soaring
production
growth
from
shale
opec
compliance
hit
percent
in
january
essentially
the
same
as
december
nigeria
and
saudi
arabia
actually
raised
their
oil
production
levels
in
january
from
a
month
earlier
but
the
reason
that
opec
was
able
to
avoid
a
slide
in
its
compliance
rate
is
that
venezuela
continues
to
see
its
production
base
erode
at
a
rapid
reasons
for
the
decline
are
the
same
as
they
have
been
for
quite
a
while
an
economic
crisis
that
is
only
worsening
no
cash
for
investment
or
even
maintenance
a
debt
crisis
sanctions
the
politicization
of
pdvsa
and
a
brain
drain
from
the
company
unfortunately
these
factors
are
not
going
away
which
means
venezuela
s
output
and
political
situation
will
likely
remain
in
a
downward
spiral
during
barclays
analysts
wrote
in
a
research
investment
bank
predicts
that
venezuela
s
oil
production
will
average
million
barrels
per
day
in
a
shocking
decline
of
roughly
bpd
from
the
average
in
the
second
half
of
output
averages
just
situation
is
compounded
by
a
spiraling
debt
crisis
for
years
venezuela
and
pdvsa
have
prioritized
meeting
bond
payments
pretty
much
above
all
else
even
a
worsening
humanitarian
crisis
playing
out
in
the
streets
people
go
hungry
want
for
basic
items
and
die
in
hospitals
that
lack
medicine
yet
creditors
continued
to
be
paid
at
least
up
until
a
few
months
ago
the
fear
has
been
that
once
pdvsa
defaults
on
major
bond
payments
creditors
could
go
after
oil
assets
around
the
world
that
would
make
the
situation
much
worse
for
the
country
related
three
factors
that
could
end
the
oil
rallyas
such
venezuela
could
try
to
continue
to
pay
creditors
what
it
can
the
problem
however
is
that
the
government
is
fighting
on
too
many
fronts
because
it
has
no
cash
to
even
fund
the
most
basic
maintenance
at
its
oil
fields
and
refineries
production
is
now
in
steep
decline
that
will
make
its
cash
situation
even
worse
with
each
passing
day
which
in
turn
will
make
meeting
debt
payments
more
difficult
i
f
production
continues
to
fall
at
the
recent
accelerated
pace
the
government
s
runway
to
pay
upcoming
obligations
will
be
severely
shortened
barclays
analysts
only
way
the
situation
can
be
reversed
barclays
says
is
a
change
of
government
we
believe
sustainably
growing
output
would
likely
require
a
combination
of
the
following
a
regime
change
fx
reforms
adjustments
to
fiscal
terms
changes
to
pdvsa
s
equity
mandate
and
higher
oil
prices
barclays
wrote
that
is
a
serious
set
of
circumstances
that
is
unlikely
to
play
out
anytime
soon
so
the
declines
accelerated
decline
in
the
fourth
quarter
suggests
that
actual
could
be
occurring
barclays
says
but
data
and
intel
on
what
s
taking
place
at
the
ground
level
is
hard
to
come
by

oil

within
monthsstill
while
the
situation
for
venezuela
s
oil
industry
is
dreadful
much
of
the
declines
that
barclays
is
forecasting
have
already
happened
the
bank
s
headline
figure
of
a
loss
of
bpd
from
venezuela
this
year
is
based
on
the
average
not
what
the
country
produced
at
the
end
of
the
year
around
in
other
words
if
venezuela
can
exit
at
about
or
a
little
below
the
losses
at
least
in
the
global
context
wouldn
t
be
that
the
other
hand
barclays
noted
that
there
is
some
downside
risk
to
even
this
dire
forecast
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
sharper
decline
due
to
the
creditors
decision
to
attach
assets
accelerated
debt
payments
or
a
further
escalation
of
political
tensions
the
bank
said
in
the
event
of
a
sudden
significant
supply
disruption
we
would
expect
prices
to
rally
percent
over
the
near
term
though
a
sustained
outage
could
strengthen
prices
however
any
sudden
loss
of
such
a
great
magnitude
would
likely
prompt
higher
production
from
opec
in
order
to
prevent
a
painful
price
matter
how
you
slice
it
venezuela
s
oil
production
is
heading
south
the
uncertainty
is
around
how
bad
it
will
