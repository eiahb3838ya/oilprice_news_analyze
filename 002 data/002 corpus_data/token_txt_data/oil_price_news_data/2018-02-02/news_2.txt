the u.s. oil boom is attracting canadian drillers
canadian
oil
and
gas
drillers
are
moving
their
rigs
to
the
united
states
in
response
to
greater
demand
for
their
service
there
and
an
investment
climate
at
home
that
is
according
to
industry
insiders
only
making
their
lives
a
recent
story
for
the
globe
and
mail
dan
healing
quotes
a
few
executives
from
drilling
companies
who
say
they
re
taking
rigs
to
the
permian
in
texas
and
the
exodus
will
likely
intensify
even
if
not
all
drillers
are
too
comfortable
with
the
move
so
far
to
the
of
these
executives
trinidad
drilling
s
ceo
brent
conway
put
it
in
simple
terms
we
raised
taxes
we
increasing
costs
because
of
labour
laws
that
are
changing
we
are
building
pipelines
and
we
ca
get
federal
or
provincial
governments
to
do
anything
to
help
us
meanwhile
in
the
lower
drillers
are
getting
closer
to
the
mark
by
the
day
despite
warnings
that
they
might
drill
themselves
into
the
ground
if
they
don
t
rein
in
production
growth
these
words
spoken
last
year
by
continental
resources
harold
hamm
rang
out
across
the
industry
when
benchmarks
were
just
beginning
to
recover
but
now
with
brent
still
very
close
to
a
barrel
and
wti
enjoying
a
lift
to
it
s
easy
to
forget
them
so
shale
boomers
are
drilling
and
hedging
their
future
production
at
the
higher
prices
for
them
life
seems
to
be
canadian
drillers
not
so
much
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
seems
to
be
the
most
pressing
problem
it
is
not
a
new
problem
it
has
been
around
for
years
and
even
in
canadian
media
reported
warnings
that
the
discount
at
which
canadian
crude
trades
to
west
texas
intermediate
will
only
widen
if
no
new
pipelines
are
built
and
this
will
hurt
the
performance
of
the
local
oil
industry
related
the
biggest
threat
to
oil
exportsthings
haven
t
changed
for
the
better
since
then
keystone
xl
has
not
yet
received
a
final
investment
decision
as
doubts
persist
about
it
being
economical
and
environmental
opposition
remains
strong
trans
mountain
s
expansion
a
project
that
the
federal
government
of
justin
trudeau
approved
last
year
is
also
far
from
certain
as
the
government
of
british
columbia
has
put
its
foot
down
vowing
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
shelve
the
project
canadian
select
wcs
is
currently
trailing
wti
prices
by
a
discount
of
more
than
a
barrel
that
s
a
very
wide
gap
and
even
pm
trudeau
seems
to
be
aware
of
it
because
at
a
recent
town
hall
meeting
in
edmonton
he
said
that
canadian
crude
needs
new
markets
and
therefore
needs
the
trans
mountain
expansion
to
reach
the
coast
of
british
columbia
yet
there
was
no
cheer
at
the
meeting
opposition
to
the
project
to
all
pipeline
projects
in
canada
is
riding
the
high
wave
of
saving
the
planet
oblivious
to
questions
like
where
the
more
than
people
now
working
in
oil
and
gas
in
alberta
alone
are
going
to
go
and
what
is
going
to
replace
the
industry
s
contribution
to
the
provincial
and
federal
contribution
may
not
be
percent
as
it
is
in
much
more
economies
but
it
is
there
until
the
pipeline
problem
is
solved
more
drillers
will
leave
for
the
permian
and
the
rigs

to
the
