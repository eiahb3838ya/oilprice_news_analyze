the two factors to watch in today’s oil markets
the
bulls
have
gained
the
upper
hand
in
oil
markets
of
late
with
estimates
of
oil
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
driving
factor
behind
this
renewed
bullishness
is
the
of
sanctions
on
iran
that
threaten
to
significantly
impact
iranian
exports
while
this
bullish
sentiment
is
certainly
justifiable
there
are
also
plenty
of
bearish
catalysts
looming
over
markets
that
should
not
be
ignored
the
most
important
of
these
catalysts
is
the
possibility
of
an
trade
war
between
china
and
the
an
outcome
that
is
very
much
plausible
oil
prices
in
the
coming
months
are
likely
to
be
influenced
most
heavily
by
these
two
contrasting
factors
with
iranian
sanctions
sending
prices
up
while
trade
war
escalations
sending
them
and
iran
saga
has
had
a
grip
over
oil
markets
for
the
last
three
months
oil
prices
spiked
in
may
when
trump
announced
that
he
was
imposing
sanctions
on
iran
and
leaving
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
jcpoa
now
as
the
first
round
of
sanctions
goes
into
effect
the
relationship
between
iran
and
the
has
become
increasingly
strained
the
second
round
of
sanctions
which
is
going
to
focus
on
the
energy
sector
will
have
a
much
higher
impact
than
the
current
round
according
to
different
estimates
sanctions
could
take
anywhere
from
to
million
barrels
out
of
the
market
this
combined
with
the
recent
worries
about
spare
capacity
and
the
ongoing
tension
in
the
arabian
peninsula
between
yemeni
houthis
and
ksa
may
well
drive
prices
towards
the
there
is
certainly
a
possibility
of
a
more
than
one
million
bpd
decline
in
iranian
oil
there
are
some
who
suggest
the
decline
will
be
significantly
less
than
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
india
and
china
account
for
almost
percent
of
iranian
oil
exports
between
them
and
likely
have
the
ability
to
boost
their
imports

the
stance
of
india
is
a
little
vague
but
they
have
cleared
that
they
will
only
comply
with
un
mandated
sanctions
and
are
reportedly
looking
to
find
alternate
ways
of
payment
in
order
to
continue
buying
oil
from
iran
china
has
clearly
stated
that
it
will
not
implement
any
cut
in
its
imports
from
iran
eu
accounting
for
another
big
chunk
of
iran
s
oil
wants
to
retain
the
current
iran
deal
and
is
trying
its
best
to
rescue
while
iranian
sanctions
may
excite
oil
bulls
they
remain
very
much
a
wild
card
for
oil
second
major
factor
to
watch
in
today
s
oil
markets
is
the
ongoing
trade
war
between
china
and
the
president
trump
recently
escalated
this
trade
war
with
a
second
round
of
sanctions
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
products
china
has
said
that
it
will
retaliate
with
billion
of
its
own
tariffs
and
has
made
it
clear
that
it
will
not
back
down
it
is
generally
accepted
that
trade
wars
are
bad
for
the
global
economy
and
the
oil
market
is
no
exception
oil
prices
tanked
percent
in
a
single
day
after
trump
announced
the
billion
tariffs
as
these
tariffs
continue
to
escalate
the
impact
on
oil
markets
will
likely
a
price
spike

saeed
chief

and

region
is
very
bullish
on
oil
and
sees
it
at
claiming
that
geopolitical
risk
and
tight
supply
constraint
have
given
oil
prices
a
new
head
to
stay
on
the
bullish
course
understanding

is
a
real
virtue

sophisticated
investors

that
demand
for
oil
would
touch

the
influence
of
sanctions
on
oil
prices
however
is
subject
to
the
response
of
china
india
the
eu
and
iran
itself
bulls
may
well
have
an
argument
but
they
lack
any
sort
of
certainty
when
it
comes
to
quantifying
the
impact
of
sanctions
the
outcome
of
the
trade
war
by
comparison
is
quite
certain
lower

prices
it
is
this
certainty
that
might
give
oil
bulls
pause
for

the
end
of

other
factors
such
as
inventory
figures
