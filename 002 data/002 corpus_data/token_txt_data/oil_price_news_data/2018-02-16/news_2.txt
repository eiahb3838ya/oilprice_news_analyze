iran fails to comply with opec deal
the
opec
monthly
oil
market
report
is
out
production
data
for
january
all
data
unless
otherwise
noted
is
through
january
and
is
in
thousand
barrels
per
crude
only
production
has
held
steady
for
three
months
however
this
chart
masks
the
fact
that
november
production
was
revised
downward
by
barrels
per
day
and
december
production
was
revised
downward
by
barrels
per
day
january
production
was
barrels
per
day
below
last
year
s
average
of
barrels
per
day
and
barrels
per
day
lower
than
opec
s
month
average
of
barrels
per
day
opec
oil
production
was
down
just
barrels
per
day
in
january
november
production
was
revised
down
bpd
and
december
production
was
revised
down
by
bpd
the
largest
revisions
were
for
venezuela
their
production
was
revised
down
bpd
in
november
and
bpd
in
december
algeria
like
at
least
other
opec
countries
is
in
continuous
decline
angola
peaked
in
at
a
average
of
barrels
per
day
are
currently
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
barrels
per
day
below
that
number
ecuador
s
crude
oil
production
increased
steadily
for
four
and
years
from
to
january
of
and
has
been
on
a
bumpy
decline
for
the
last
three
years
equatorial
guinea
s
chart
speaks
for
itself
i
really
don
t
know
why
they
joined
opec
their
production
is
clearly
in
decline
but
is
not
enough
to
make
much
difference
either
way
everything
i
said
about
equatorial
guinea
can
also
be
said
about
gabon
iran
is
obviously
ignoring
any
opec
request
to
cut
production
and
are
producing
every
possible
barrel
they
can
iraq
s
average
peaked
so
far
last
year
at
barrels
per
day
their
january
crude
oil
production
was
barrels
per
day
below
that
average
are
they
deliberately
cutting
production
if
so
not
by
much
kuwait
s
chart
looks
strange
to
my
eye
i
believe
kuwait
is
one
of
two
and
possibly
three
opec
countries
that
could
increase
production
somewhat
the
others
are
saudi
arabia
and
possibly
the
united
arab
emirates
libya
is
struggling
if
peace
ever
breaks
out
in
libya
they
could
increase
production
somewhat
but
peace
doesn
t
seem
to
be
on
the
horizon
in
libya
nigerian
crude
oil
production
has
a
general
downward
trend
how
much
of
this
trend
is
due
to
political
problems
some
of
it
no
doubt
but
definitely
not
all
of
it
qatar
peaked
in
and
i
won
t
say
so
far
here
they
are
clearly
in
decline
saudi
crude
oil
production
has
been
holding
steady
for
months
now
saudi
is
the
only
opec
nation
that
could
increase
production
by
any
considerable
amount
they
could
possibly
increase
production
from
one
quarter
to
one
half
million
barrels
per
day
but
likely
a
lot
closer
to
one
quarter
million
per
possibly
the
uae
is
one
of
the
other
two
opec
nations
that
just
might
be
able
to
increase
production
somewhat
but
i
have
more
doubts
about
the
uae
than
i
do
about
kuwait
venezuela
is
in
the
grasp
of
a
collapse
their
production
has
fallen
barrels
per
day
in
the
last
three
months
their
november
production
was
revised
downward
by
barrels
per
day
and
their
december
production
was
revised
downward
by
barrels
per
is
in
danger
of
becoming
a
totally
failed
state
like
somalia
the
worse
things
get
the
worse
things
get
that
is
falling
income
from
oil
exports
increases
the
chance
that
production
will
continue
to
fall
all
income
from
exports
will
have
to
be
used
to
keep
the
public
from
total
rebellion
and
none
will
be
left
for
the
oil
fields
looking
at
a
chart
puts
opec
crude
only
production
in
a
much
clearer
perspective
on
this
chart
is
january
only
the
point
here
is
that
opec
cuts
are
not
making
much
of
a
difference
world
oil
production
is
on
that
proverbial
bumpy
plateau

saudi
kuwait
and
the
uae
began
to
increase
production
in
may
of
and
peaked
in
november
of
that
year
the
other
opec
countries
peaked
in
july
seven
months
after
the
opec
cuts
began
they
were
all
at
that
time
producing
flat
out
and
in
my
opinion
still
the
three
opec
countries
saudi
kuwait
and
the
uae
are
likely
capable
of
increasing
production
they
in
my
opinion
can
in
no
way
increase
production
to
what
they
were
producing
in
late
that
was
a
period
where
they
made
heroic
efforts
to
increase
production
in
order
to
establish
a
point
from
which
they
could
cut
production
that
level
was
then
and
is
now
unsustainable
and
if
you
remove
venezuela
from
the
mix
then
the
combined
production
of
the
other
are
at
an
high
or
nearly
so
the
increase
in
production
of
the
countries
represented
in
this
chart
for
the
last
two
years
has
been
all
iran
recovering
from
sanctions
and
libya
recovering
from
rebel
attacks
iraq
has
been
relatively
flat
over
the
last
two
years
and
everyone
else
has
declined
opec
production
in
the
above
chart
is
crude
only
it
does
not
even
include
condensate
but
world
supply
here
is
total
liquids
so
they
are
comparing
apples
to
oranges
natural
gas
liquids
in
the
last
few
years
have
increased
far
more
than
crude
oil
alone
the

been

the

the

of

the
