opec and shale keep oil prices between $60-$75
the
interaction
between
shale
and
opec
will
continue
to
be
the
dominant
narrative
in
the
oil
market
this
year
and
the
opposing
forces
could
end
up
trapping
oil
prices
within
a
relatively
narrow
price
sentiment
has
shifted
quite
a
bit
over
the
past
month
with
the
impact
of
the
opec
cuts
sparking
bullish
sentiment
and
huge
price
gains
in
january
but
the
surge
in
shale
production
has
decidedly
broken
the
fever
and
oil
prices
have
retreated
sharply
from
their
highs
amid
fears
of
another
dynamic
could
continue
for
quite
a
while
with
prices
and
sentiment
seesawing
back
and
forth
nevertheless
while
opec
and
shale
drillers
duke
it
out
those
too
opposing
forces
could
put
lower
and
upper
bounds
on
oil
prices
keeping
trading
within
a
relatively
tight
trading
range
of
to
per
barrel
for
brent
according
to
a
new
report
from
the
oxford
institute
for
energy
prices
creep
up
towards
the
upper
end
of
that
range
shale
will
accelerate
adding
new
supply
onto
the
market
and
pulling
oil
prices
back
down
there
is
little
room
below
per
barrel
however
as
the
opec
cuts
continue
to
keep
supply
off
the
market
moreover
oil
demand
remains
strong
and
will
continue
to
soak
up
a
good
chunk
of
the
additional
barrels
coming
onto
the
market
taken
together
prices
will
likely
trade
between
a
and
range
with
oies
forecasting
an
average
brent
price
of
about
per
barrel
this
year

the

studiesthe
argument
is
a
variation
of
the
shale
band
theory
popularized
a
few
years
ago
during
the
depths
of
the
oil
market
downturn
according
to
that
theory
which
put
more
responsibility
on
shale
specifically
prices
seemed
to
trade
between
and
for
quite
an
extended
period
of
time
with
the
unique
tendencies
of
shale
drilling
throwing
up
resistance
on
those
upper
and
lower
bounds
if
prices
dropped
to
per
barrel
and
below
shale
drillers
went
out
of
business
and
supply
was
curtailed
pushing
prices
back
up
if
prices
flirted
with

real
hope
or
mostly
hype
that
dynamic
is
more
or
less
alive
and
well
except
that
opec
has
decided
to
raise
the
price
floor
a
bit
by
taking
million
barrels
per
day
off
of
the
market
a
deal
that
has
been
in
place
for
over
a
year
now
the
floor
for
brent
is
more
solidly
at
the
price
level
rather
than
or
course
this
is
just
a
forecast
and
is
subject
to
uncertainty
on
many
levels
some
of
which
could
force
oil
prices
to
shoot
above
or
below
the
range
on
the
downside
opec
s
exit
from
its
production
cuts
could
end
up
being
more
chaotic
than
the
market
currently
calculates
there
are
a
few
ways
this
could
go
first
higher
production
levels
from
nigeria
libya
or
iraq
are
possible
once
output
rises
and
compliance
falls
there
is
less
pressure
on
the
whole
group
to
maintain
compliance
or
the
market
tightens
to
such
a
degree
that
there
is
a
bit
of
disagreement
about
what
to
do
at
the
june
meeting
a
messy
exit
from
the
agreement
could
lead
to
output
and
lower
prices
for
now
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
opec
will
emerge
as
a
black
swan
to
the
oil
market
this
year
all
signs
strong
compliance
and
very
clear
statements
of
support
for
maintaining
the
cuts
point
to
strong
cohesion
at
this
downside
threat
is
shale
as
widely
noted
output
is
expected
to
exceed
this
year
a
year
sooner
than
previously
thought
the
wave
of
output
is
expected
to
lead
to
another
buildup
in
inventories
which
keep
oil
prices
at
the
lower
end
especially
if
demand
brings
up
another
threat
to
prices
demand
is
strong
right
now
the
iea
puts
demand
growth
at
opec
says
which
will
prevent
shale
from
crashing
prices
but
if
demand
disappoints
there
is
much
more
room
for
prices
to
oil
rig
count
rises
as
prices
recoverthe
flip
side
is
that
unexpected
supply
disruptions
could
blow
up
the
price
band
scenario
with
a
decline
from
venezuela
in
particular
a
notable
possibility
the
loss
of
from
venezuela
would
add
something
like
per
barrel
to
the
oil
price
averaged
out
for
the
year
oies
says
a
but
event
of
over
of
output
losses
would
push
brent
over
for
the
of
course
is
the
uncertainty
over
shale
shale
output
is
a
downside
risk
to
prices
but
because
the
market
is
now
pricing
in
huge
production
gains
the
opposite
effect
could
also
play
out
if
shale
undershoots
in
terms
of
output
that
will
likely
translate
into
a
bullish
effect
on
all
of
those
factors
individually
are
mere
speculation
taken
all
together
