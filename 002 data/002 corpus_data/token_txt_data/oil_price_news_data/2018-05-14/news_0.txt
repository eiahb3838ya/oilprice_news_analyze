opec: the oil glut is gone
opec
said
that
the
global
oil
supply
surplus
has
nearly
been
eliminated
although
the
group
is
shifting
its
sights
on
lack
of
investment
in
upstream
opec
s
may

market
report
the
group
noted
that
supply
continues
to
grow
at
a
rapid
rate
adding
million
barrels
per
day
in
with
expectations
of
another
in
percent
of
which
will
come
from
the
in

supply
is
expected
to
outpace
demand
growth
even
though
demand
will
expand

opec
also
warned
that
capital
expenditure
capex
including
exploration
increased

moreover
it
has
seen
a
decline
of
around
compared
to
the
while
that
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
line
given
the
enormous
production
increases
from
shale
the
focus
on
upstream
investment
has
been
a
growing
point
of
emphasis
for
opec
as
it
grapples
with
how
to
respond

only
million

above

in
march
which
is
to
say
stocks
are
probably
already
below
the
average
at
this
point
that
means
that
opec
has
achieved
its
goal
of
shrinking
the
supply
would
suggest
that
the
group
begins
to
unwind
the
production
cuts
at
its
upcoming
meeting
in
june
but
there
has
been
a
reluctance
to
do
so
saudi
arabia
is
aiming
for
higher
oil
prices
ahead
of

the
cuts
in
place
for
the
remainder
of
opec
s
initial
preference
would
seem
to
require
another
justification
now
that
inventories
are
back
to
the
average
raising
alarms
about
lack
of
upstream
investment

offer
such
a
opec
noted
that
heady
projections
about
shale
growth
are
not
without
downside
risk
shale
could
fail
to
deliver
on
aggressive
growth
figures
for
several
reasons
the
continued
strong
development
of
the
world
economy
could
lead
to
rising
inflation
and
along
with
potential
trade
restrictions
would
impact
oil
production
costs
opec
said
in
addition
us
tight
oil
production
is
increasingly
faced
with
costly
logistical
constraints
in
terms
of
outtake
capacity
from
production
sites
the
permian
basin
continues
to
add
new
supply
at
a
torrid
pace
but
with
pipelines
just
about
filled
up
further
gains
could
be
harder
to
come
by
than
the
forecasts
suggest
also
investors
are
increasingly
demanding
profits
returned
to
them
forcing
a
new
era
of
capital
discipline
oil
companies
that
have
announced
spending
increases
have
been
punished
by
wall
street
over
the
past
year
while
those
that
have
returned
cash
to
shareholders
in
the
form
of
share
buybacks
and
dividend
hikes
have
been
rewarded
spending
restraint
could
lead
to
more
modest
growth
although
that
remains
to
be
seen

the
decision
to
scrap
the
iran
nuclear
deal
looms
over
the
oil
market
and
opec
s
deliberations
any
supply
outage
could
force
opec
off
of
the
sidelines
whether
they
want
to
act
or
not
in
that
sense
the
cartel
might
be
compelled
to
make
changes
to
the
deal
to
allow
for
more
supply
in
the
event
of
declining
shipments
from

russian
officials
have
intimated
that
they
would
not
let
a
supply
outage
rattle

it
is
too
early
to
say
what
the
impact
of
the

decision
on
the

market
will
be

any

we
have
