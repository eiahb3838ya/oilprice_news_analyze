chinaâ€™s no.1 oil company cuts saudi crude imports
china
s
sinopec
will
cut
its
june
imports
of
crude
from
saudi
arabia
by
percent
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
because
of
unjustified
high
prices
an
official
from
the
top
asian
refiner
unipec
told
arabia
raised
the
price
for
its
arab
light
to
a
high
and
according
to
the
unipec
official
the
grade
is
now
considerably
overvalued
compared
to
other
middle
eastern
month
a
unipec
official
told
reuters
our
refineries
think
these
are
unreasonable
prices
as
they
do
not
follow
the
pricing
besides
sinopec
a
source
from
another
two
refineries
in
northern
asia
said
they
will
be
cutting
their
imports
from
saudi
arabia
by
percent
as
oil
buyers
have
a
hard
time
grasping
how
the
kingdom
is
calculating
the
price
for
its
most
popular
price
increase
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
biggest
market
for
crude
in
the
world
however
it
is
likely
that
sinopec
will
be
penalized
for
the
reduction
as
the
usual
sales
contracts
with
saudi
arabia
are
on
a
basis
with
leeway
of
up
to
percent
imported
an
average
of
bpd
of
saudi
crude
during
the
first
quarter
down
from
bpd
a
year
earlier
but
imports
by
other
refiners
increased
by
bpd
or
percent
on
an
annual
basis
as
they
expanded
their
refining
month
sinopec
will
carry
out
regular
maintenance
across
its
refineries
so
the
lower
import
volumes
will
not
urgently
need
a
cheaper
replacement
but
the
refineries
will
be
back
into
normal
operation
by
july
and
will
need
more
arabia
said
last
year
it
would
reduce
the
amount
of
crude
it
exports
to
below
million
bpd
and
last
month
the
energy
ministry
reiterated
that
it
is
sticking
to
this
target
which
could
explain
