higher oil prices are opecâ€™s only concern
opec
could
achieve
its
goal
of
eliminating
the
oil
inventory
surplus
this
month
but
the
goal
posts
will
now
move
to
another
metric
in
order
to
justify
keeping
the
production
limits
in
place
in
order
to
drive
prices
of
february
the
oecd
commercial
stocks
stood
at
million
barrels
just
million
barrels
above
the
average
that
data
came
from
the
iea
s
april
oil
market
report
which
publishes
the
inventory
data
on
a
lag
because
we
are
largely
looking
through
the
rearview
mirror
at
the
inventory
data
the
stock
surplus
could
be
zeroed
out
this
month
the
iea
said
although
we
won
t
know
for
a
few
more
precise
moment
when
inventories
reach
the
average
opec
s
stated
goal
as
part
of
its
production
cut
agreement
is
a
bit
beside
the
point
whether
it
occurs
in
may
or
june
doesn
t
matter
all
that
much
the
most
important
thing
is
that
the
surplus
is
virtually
eliminated
well
before
opec
s
agreement
is
set
to
expire
refined
product
stocks
are
actually
already
in
a
deficit
relative
to
the
average
the
agreement
was
thought
to
last
until
the
end
of
but
that
remains
in
flux
opec
officials
have
signaled
that
they
want
to
keep
the
cuts
in
place
regardless
of
what
the
inventories
are
actually
doing
right
now
and
that
there
is
very
little
chance
that
the
group
takes
action
in
june
to
phase
out
the
agreement
early
the
coordinated
cuts
could
even
be
extended
into
on
what
basis
because
the
inventory
metric
will
soon
be
obsolete
opec
is
scrambling
for
another
justification
earlier
this
year
the
group
hinted
at
a
few
possible
alternatives
perhaps
the
group
could
use
the
average
for
inventories
instead
of
the
average
presumably
that
would
require
keeping
the
current
cuts
in
place
because
the
past
seven
years
incorporates
a
period
of
time
in
which
inventories
were
recently
however
saudi
oil
minister
khalid
has
pointed
to
low
levels
of
upstream
investment
he
argues
that
since
the
oil
market
downturn
began
in
industry
investment
has
cratered
and
has
yet
to
bounce
back
in
a
major
way
that
is
raising
the
odds
that
the
oil
market
faces
a
supply
crunch
in
a
few
years
a
conclusion
repeatedly
echoed
by
the
is
the
most
important
metric
for
evaluating
next
steps
for
opec
recently
it
is
interesting
that
the
most
powerful
oil
minister
from
within
opec
is
pointing
to
investment
levels
as
some
sort
of
justification
for
keeping
the
current
production
cuts
in
place
says
that
by
driving
oil
prices
higher
it
will
stimulate
more
one
could
be
forgiven
for
questioning
the
motivation
behind
that
for
one
investment
levels
as
a
gauge
of
oil
market
health
is
a
rather
subjective
metric
at
what
level
is
spending
sufficient
and
when
will
we
get
there
second
it
isn
t
obvious
that
it
is
in
opec
s
interest
to
stimulate
a
ton
of
investment
in
supply
after
all
opec
has
been
ceding
market
share
to
other
producers
for
a
while
now
it
isn
t
clear
that
stoking
higher
levels
of
shale
drilling
is
really
a
good
thing
as
far
as
opec
is
some
analysts
argue
that
the
spending
shortfall
is
overstated
over
the
next
years
we
see
that
supply
will
continue
to
keep
up
with
demand
growth
said
espen
erlingsen
an
analyst
at
rystad
energy
according
to
bloomberg
the
surge
in
north
american
shale
activity
and
start
up
of
new
fields
are
the
main
drivers
for
this
related
iran
sanctions
could
throw
oil
markets
into
chaosso
why
talk
about
investment
levels
perhaps
is
using
oil
industry
spending
as
a
pretext
to
keep
the
current
production
cuts
in
place
to
simply
drive
oil
prices
higher
saudi
arabia
has
some
very
strong
reasons
to
pursue
higher
prices
regardless
of
inventories
or
investment
levels
the
kingdom
wants
to
close
a
fiscal
deficit
and
it
also
needs
revenues
for
the
economic
diversification
plan
as
part
of
its
vision
importantly
saudi
officials
want
higher
prices
ahead
of
the
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
tentatively
scheduled
for
exiting
the
opec
cuts
would
pose
a
serious
risk
to
oil
prices
even
if
inventories
are
indeed
back
at
average
such
it
is
very
useful
for
saudi
arabia
to
pivot
to
oil
industry
investment
levels
as
a
justification
for
keeping
the
production
cuts
in
place
oil
prices
will
drift
higher
as
inventories
dip
below
average
levels
and
the
market
grows
tighter
for
other
opec
members
higher
oil
prices
also
shower
them
with
more
cash
so
no
harm
in
going
along
keeping
barrels
offline
does
require
a
sacrifice
but
prices
have
shot
up
over
the
past
year
more
than
offsetting
the
pain
of
restricting
supply
there
is
a
risk
sparking
too
much
rival
supply
but
for
now
opec
is
playing
for
the
talking
about
the
need
for
more
investment
is
a
way
of
saying
hey
world
we
re
opec
and
we
want
higher
prices
but
we
re
actually
doing
you
a
favor
