iea: oil prices could rise further as shale can’t fill the gap
shale
will
continue
its
breakneck
growth
rate
into
despite
bottlenecks
but
the
oil
market
still
faces
serious
supply
risks
from
the
potential
losses
from
venezuela
and
iran
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
in
a
new
iea
said
that
the
run
up
in
oil
prices
in
the
last
few
months
dampened
oil
demand
growth
although
the
agency
left
its
forecast
for
oil
demand
growth
unchanged
at
million
barrels
per
day
after
downgrading
that
estimate
last
month
subsidies
and
price
regulation
in
a
growing
number
of
countries
intended
to
blunt
the
impact
of
rising
fuel
prices
could
keep
demand
growth
on
track
despite
oil
prices
trading
significantly
higher
than
say
a
year
ahead
to
the
iea
thinks
that
oil
demand
growth
will
expand
by
yet
another
this
time
with
the
help
of
the
petrochemical
sector
a
number
of
projects
are
coming
online
earlier
than
expected
adding
more
consumption
to
the
mix
the
demand
estimate
is
a
rather
strong
one
given
substantial
expansion
in
demand
over
the
past
few
are
risks
to
that
forecast
including
a
weakening
of
economic
confidence
trade
protectionism
and
a
potential
further
strengthening
of
the
us
dollar
the
iea
said
those
factors
should
not
be
overlooked
indeed
strong
demand
does
not
stand
independent
of
the
price
variable
for
instance
how
this
plays
out
is
unclear
but
with
the
oil
market
now
much
tighter
than
at
any
point
in
the
last
few
years
strong
demand
going
forward
will
start
to
drive
up
prices
much
more
than
it
did
in
the
supply
side
of
the
equation
is
much
more
interesting
on
the
positive
side
of
the
ledger
the
iea
sees
supply
growing
by
in
followed
by
another
jump
of
in
the
makes
up
three
quarters
of
both
of
those
production
from
shale
has
not
been
without
stress
the
iea
notes
citing
the
discount
for
wti
relative
to
brent
and
an
even
greater
discount
for
oil
located
in
midland
texas
where
all
of
that
oil
is
coming
from
the
iea
does
not
seem
overly
concerned
about
the
pipeline
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
noting
that
much
of
the
issue
will
be
resolved
with
new
capacity
by
the
end
of
next
year
related
oil
prices
rebound
on
crude
gasoline
inventory
draws
we
think
that
in
texas
by
there
will
be
a
net
of
additional
pipeline
capacity
beyond
our
earlier
number
albeit
with
most
of
it
coming
on
line
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
the
iea
wrote
in
the
meantime
capacity
will
likely
remain
tight
but
production
will
still
be
able
to
grow
strongly
by
this
year
and
in
however
while
soaring
shale
output
would
seem
to
keep
the
oil
market
catastrophic
declines
in
venezuela
and
potentially
in
iran
could
keep
things
rather
tight
the
iea
said
it
is
conceivable
that
the
two
beleaguered
opec
members
both
of
which
are
staring
down
sanctions
could
lose
of
supply
combined
by
the
end
of
will
likely
respond
to
these
potential
losses
and
the
iea
guesses
that
the
cartel
will
add
somewhere
around
in
fairly
short
president
donald
trump
added
further
pressure
on
the
cartel
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
the
message
to
opec
ahead
of
its
meeting
and
in
particular
to
trump
s
ally
saudi
arabia
is
a
not
a
very
subtle
prices
are
too
high
opec
is
at
it
again
not
good
still
just
because
opec
is
on
the
verge
of
adding
supply
back
into
the
market
that
does
not
mean
that
everyone
can
rest
easy
e
ven
if
the
supply
gap
is
plugged
the
market
will
be
finely
balanced
next
year
and
vulnerable
to
prices
rising
higher
in
the
event
of
further
disruption
the
iea
said
it
is
possible
that
the
very
small
number
of
countries
with
spare
capacity
beyond
what
can
be
activated
quickly
will
have
to
go
the
extra
indeed
spare
capacity
could
be
drawn
down
to
the
lowest
level
in
decades
if
opec
and
russia
decide
to
increase
output
while
raising
production
will
help
meet
demand
it
also
eats
away
at
the
surplus
buffer
that
saudi
arabia
in
particular
has
available
on
the
sidelines
low
spare
capacity
creates
a
lot
of
price
risk
in
the
event
of
additional
outages
and
given
the
instability
in
places
like
libya
and
nigeria
plus
question
marks
about
how
low
output
in
venezuela
and
iran
could
go
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
more
surprises
are
coming
