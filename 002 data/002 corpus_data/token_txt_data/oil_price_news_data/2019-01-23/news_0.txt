saudi arabia: we’ll pump the world’s very last barrel of oil
saudi
arabia
isn
t
buying
the
peak
oil
demand
narrative
opec
s
largest
producer
continues
to
expect
global
oil
demand
to
keep
rising
at
least
by
and
sees
itself
as
the
oil
producer
best
equipped
to
continue
meeting
that
demand
thanks
to
its
very
low
production
arabia
will
be
the
one
to
pump
the
last
barrel
of
oil
in
the
world
but
it
doesn
t
see
the
last
barrel
of
oil
being
pumped
for
decades
and
decades
to
come
i
don
t
see
peak
oil
demand
happening
in
years
or
even
by
amin

president
and
chief
executive
officer
of

oil
giant
saudi
aramco
told

emerging
markets
editor
john
defterios
on
the
sidelines
of
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
this
there
will
continue
to
be
growth
in
oil
demand
we
are
the
lowest
cost
producer
and
the
last
barrel
will
come
from
the
region
nasser
told
several
years
nasser
has
been
saying
that
peak
oil
demand
is
nowhere
in
sight
that
petrochemicals
will
drive
oil
demand
growth
through
and
that
all
the
peak
oil
demand
and
stranded
resources
talk
is
threatening
an
orderly
energy
transition
and
energy
has
just
announced
that
its
huge
oil
reserves
are
slightly
higher
than
previously
to
diversify
its
economy
away
from
heavy
dependence
on
crude
oil
but
one
of
the
goals
of
its
vision
diversification
plan
is
to
use
less
oil
in
domestic
power
generation
to
free
up
more
barrels
for

evs

the

s
top
crude

exporter
saudi
arabia
will
not
be
giving
away
easily
its

the

various
organizations
including
opec
estimate
that

some
point

this
month
saudi
arabia
announced
that
an
independent
estimate
of
its
oil
reserves
by
degolyer
and
macnaughton
d
m
showed
that
the
kingdom
s
total
proven
oil
reserves
were
billion
barrels
as
of
the
end
of
up
from
around
billion
barrels
previously
bp
statistical
review
of
world

put
saudi
arabia
s
oil
reserves
at
billion
barrels
at
or
percent
of
global
oil
reserves
second
only
to
venezuela
s
billion
and
macnaughton
said
last
week
that
it
completed
the
first
contemporary
independent
assessment
of
reserves
in
saudi
arabia
adding
that
at
this
point
it
would
make
no
further
comments
on
this
extensive
this
certification
underscores
why
every
barrel
we
produce
is
the
most
profitable
in
the
world
and
why
we
believe
saudi
aramco
is
the
world
s
most
valuable
company
and
indeed
the
world
s
most
important
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
said
in
the
statement
released
by
the
saudi
press
aramco
s
cost
of
production
is
just
a
barrel
later
said
in
a
news
conference
as
carried
by
arabia
may
need
oil
prices
higher
than
a
barrel
to
balance
its
budget
because
most
of
the
income
comes
from
oil
yet
the
kingdom
has
what
is
probably
the
world
s
lowest
cost
of
pumping
one
barrel
of
oil
related

transition
will
upend

surging
shale
production
has
been
boosting
the
global
oil
supply
which
saudi
arabia
and
opec
and
russia
are
looking
to
drain
again
with
a
new
round
of
production

current
estimates
point
to
shale
peaking

the

to
the

agency
iea

production
will
continue
rising
through

thereafter
with
our
current
estimate
for
recoverable
resources
production
starts
to
fall
in
its
latest

outlook
opec
sees

peaking

answer
to
this

is
an
emphatic
yes

continue
to
need
a

more

and
a

more
exploration
will
