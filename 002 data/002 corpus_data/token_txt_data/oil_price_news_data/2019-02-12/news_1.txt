opec’s next big crisis
opec
is
having
some
success
in
heading
off
another
oil
market
downturn
but
over
the
the
cartel
faces
much
more
serious
opec
production
growth
outlook
over
the
medium
term
remains
clouded
by
ongoing
sanctions
geopolitical
risks
competitive
supply
low
oil
prices
and
demand

a
new
production
has
soared
over
the
past
and
continues
to
rise
surging
output
from
texas
shale
fields
has
forced
opec
to
back
out
production
in
order
to
avoid
a
price
crash
in
the
years
ahead
however
opec
will
continue
to
struggle
opec
may
not
bring
a
huge
amount
of
new
capacity
online
which
could
erode
its
position
in
our
view
opec
capacity
additions
during
the
past
six
years
will
exceed
additions
over
the
next
six
bofaml
analysts
and
opec
members
added
around
million
barrels
per
day
of
new
capacity
projects
came
online
in
a
variety
of
countries
including
iraq
iran
west
africa
and
the
gulf
states
iraq
in
particular
added
huge
volumes
of
new
supply
recovering
after
years
of
war
output
from
iraq
has
more
than
doubled
since
and
recently
topped
but
future

projects
which
promised
to
dramatically
ratchet
up

today

high
levels
were
put
on
ice
in
recent
years
after
isis
overran
the
country
in
the
next
six
years
new
additions
will
probably
be
smaller
and
concentrated
in
fewer

iran
related
the
biggest
threat
to
oil
market
stabilitynot
only
will
capacity
growth
start
to
slow
but
opec
production
will
begin
to
erode
on
an
absolute
basis
falling
from
in
to
just
in
as
a
result
opec
loses
market
share
in
the
global
oil
is
not
because
of
a
lack
of
reserves
the
oil
is
still
there
opec
still
holds
about
of
total
global
oil
reserves
with
the
reserves
in
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
vastly
exceeding
those
in
any
other
country
but
demand
is
already
starting
to
slow
and
growth
will
decelerate
in
the
years
ahead
leaving
little
room
for
new
supply
shale
is
expected
to
add
barrels
onto
the
market
so
opec
will
be
forced
to
maintain
supply
curbs
in
order
to
prevent
prices
from
projects
that
do
move
forward
in
opec
countries
will
need
to
be
extremely
attractive
with
an
average
breakeven
at
per
barrel
or
lower
according
to
bank
of
america
merrill
lynch
that
compares
to
the
percent
of
projects
given
the
greenlight
over
the
next
six
years
with
an
average
breakeven
price
at
per
other
words
opec
has
cheaper
oil
but
many
opec
members
are
victims
of
sanctions
underinvestment
and
other
geopolitical
risk
iraq
and
iran
are
obvious
flashpoints
iraq
has
suffered
from
violence
and
political
crises
while
iran
could
be
under
sanctions
for
years
to
come

of

there

largest

world
regime
change
could
bring
in
a
new
government
which
would
likely
be
friendlier
to
oil

means
development
is
uncertain
and
may
not
occur
at
while
geopolitical
events
restrain

an
even
bigger
threat
to
opec
is
the
dramatic
slowdown
in
demand

in
the
years
ahead
