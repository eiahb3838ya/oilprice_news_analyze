canada’s most crucial pipeline comes under fire
police
and
private
security
contractors
have
been
quietly
preparing
to
head
off
protests
of
a
key
oil
pipeline
in
the
midwest
in
an
effort
to
avoid
another
standing
to
the
intercept
minnesota
police
have
been
planning
for
months
in
case
protestors
try
to
block
construction
of
the
line
pipeline
police
and
private
security
contractors
have
tracked
and
identified
potential
protestors
and
have
consulted
with
law
enforcement
in
north
dakota
who
busted
up
the
standing
rock
protests
it
s
not
clear
why
law
enforcement
is
siding
with
industry
or
why
they
are
surveilling
environmental
and
indigenous
groups
but
they
clearly
fear
a
rerun
of
the
dakota
access
protests
that
garnered
international
attention
in
line
replacement
at
least
to
date
has
not
received
nearly
as
much
attention
as
the
dakota
access
pipeline
keystone
xl
or
the
trans
mountain
expansion
for
that
matter
but
the
line
replacement
is
absolutely
vital
to
enbridge
its
owner
and
to
the
canadian
oil
sands
industry
as
a
pipeline
runs
through
ojibwe
lands
in
minnesota
opposition
has
been
strong
but
so
far
limited
to
ojibwe
and
local
environmental
groups
but
the
issue
could
yet
blow
up
into
another
standing
rock
private
security
contractors
themselves
have
singled
out
line
as
the
next
likely
flashpoint
of
opposition
to
a
pipeline
project
according
to
the
good
reason
not
only
would
line
present
a
threat
to
indigenous
tribes
in
minnesota
but
it
is
also
a
critical
project
to
canada
s
oil
industry
alberta
and
the
canadian
oil
industry
have
struggled
for
years
to
push
through
a
single
major
pipeline
s
keystone

has
been
in
limbo
for
more
than
a
decade
the
company
s
energy
east
pipeline
which
would
have
run
across
much
of
north
america
from
alberta
to
canada
s
east
coast

scrapped

years
ago

on

trans
mountain
expansion
was
supposed
to
be
the
project
with
the
highest
odds
for
completion
particularly
since
it
was
a
twin
line
along
an
existing
pipeline
and
not
a
greenfield
project
but
that
project
ran
into
a
brick
wall
last
year
when
kinder
morgan
threatened
to
shelve
it
only
to
have
the
canadian
government
bailout
the
company
by
essentially
nationalizing
the
project
as
of
now
the
pipeline

fortunes

still
puts
incredible
importance
on
line
as
the
salvation
for
canada
s
oil

because
of
the

western

enormous

wcs

to

meant
that

alberta

up

also
pushed

and
ultimately
is
only
a
partial
and
temporary
solution
alberta
needs
a
new
pipeline
if
the
province
is
to
see
its
oil
industry
grow
the
line
replacement
project
is
a
roughly
billion
overhaul
of
an
aging
existing
line
replacing
the
more
than
pipeline
would
restore
its
capacity
to
bpd
as
such
it
s
hard
to
overstate
the
importance
of
the
project
to
canada
s
oil
industry

on

support
and
keystone

still
up
in

the

pipeline
is
the
only
significant
increase
in
midstream
capacity
for
the
next
few
years
at
much
of
the
construction
already
completed
the
replacement
including
construction
through
minnesota
is
expected
to
be
completed
later
this
year
it
s
no
wonder
that
the
industry
and
apparently
its
allies
in
law
enforcement
are
desperate
to
avoid
