slump
in

resulted
in
a
considerable
decline
in
completions
activity
across
north
production
surprised
the
upside
and
we
saw
completions

on

the
only

for

is
downstream
the
areas
most
impacted
by
the
recent
steep
decline
in
crude
prices
are
the
more
traditional
transactional
markets
in
the

canada
we
expect
the
activity
slowdown
and
pricing
deteriorations
in
these
markets
in
the
first
half
of

negatively
impact

more
