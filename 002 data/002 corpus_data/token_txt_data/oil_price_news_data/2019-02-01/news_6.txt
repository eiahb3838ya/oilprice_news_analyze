platts: chinese independent refiners import less crude in january
china
s
independent
known
as
teapots
a
combined
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
in
january
down
by
percent
from
december
a
monthly
s
p
global
platts
survey
of
smaller
refiners
showed
on
january
imports
of
the
independent
refiners
jumped
by
percent
compared
to
january
but
according
to
a
source
at
the
qingdao
port
several
vessels
originally
scheduled
to
discharge
the
crude
in
late
december
were
held
up
by
logistical
bottlenecks
until
platts
survey
from
last
month
showed
that
the
december
imports
of
the
independent
refiners
increased
by
percent
from
november
as
the
teapots
were
rushing
to
utilize
their
crude
oil
import
quotas
allocated
by
the
chinese
state
for
yet
the
smaller
refiners
failed
to
use
up
the
quotas
according
to
the
china
issued
in
early
january
the
first
batch
of
crude
import
quotas
and
they
were
lower
than
last
year
s
first
batch
according
to
analysts
the
quotas
in
the
second
batch
typically
issued
around
september
could
be
higher
the
basis
for
the
quotas
allocation
was
the
use
of
the
quotas
between
january
and
october
during
that
period
independent
refiners
had
used
percent
of
their
quotas

yick
tee
an
analyst
with
consultancy
sia
energy
told
early
january
independent
refiners
had
slowed
down
purchases
for
delivery
in
january
and
february
because
chinese
demand
for
fuel
is
generally
lower
during
the
lunar
new
year
holiday
which
this
year
falls
next
recent
weeks
however
teapots
have
started
to
buy
more
crude
that
will
arrive
in
china
in
march
and
april
as
independent
refiners
are
looking
to
buy
more
crude
for
march
and
april
delivery
to
restock
supplies
while
oil
prices
are
still
relatively
low
the
buying
in
recent
weeks
has
pushed
up
spot
premiums
for
the
independent
refiners
favorite
crude
grades
from
russia

africa
and

to
