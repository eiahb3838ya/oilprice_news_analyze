exxonmobil
is
leader
of
the

among
the
top
oil
and
gas
explorers
of
according
to
rystad

s
annual
exploration
exxonmobil
was
exceptional
both
in
terms
of
discovered
volumes
and
value
creation
from
exploration

rystad

witnessed
the
revival

net
discovered
resources
and
the
value
creation
from
wildcat
exploration
wells
drilled
in
new
prospects
during
the

supermajor
exxonmobil
drilled
net
wildcat
wells
in
guyana
and
discovered
close
to
billion
barrels
in
additional
gross
resources
in
the
stabroek
block
which
includes
the
giant
liza
discovery
these
volumes
are
extremely
valuable
as
they
will
add
to
the
large
existing

come
in
at
second
and
third
place
in

of
value
creation
in
however
both
are
partners
in
exxonmobil
s
stabroek

and
have
therefore
benefitted
from
the

success
as
ranks
as
the
