gulf of mexico production expected to hit record high
while
the

big

been
cutting

brought

now
operators
are
vying
for
new

close
to

that
would
bring

down
even
further

is
also
expected
to

there

seen
it

at
half
that

is
on

announced
the

decision
for

a
deepwater

in
the

with
a

started
crashing

began
in

redesign
the

reducing

by
more
than
percent

to
optimize

a

ahead
of

and
at

brekelmans
said
earlier
this

that
the

targeting
its
