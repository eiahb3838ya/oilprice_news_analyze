we
are
still
in
a
period
of
headline
risk
in
financial
markets
generally
stocks
bonds

are

reacting

neither

an

with

are
anything
new
but
the
prospect
of
an

has
traders
in
every

bond

markets
are
reacting
as

both
have
seen
a

off
obvious
levels
for
the

index
and
for

yields
but
for
now
the
trends
remain
are
a
different
story
equities
are
holding
up
remarkably
well
and
remain
close
to
the
top
of
an
upward
recovery

that
has
been
in

since

geopolitics
as

geopolitical
risk
as
it
relates
to
oil
is
focused
on
the
middle
east
the
trump
administration
seems
to
have
picked
a
side
in
the
ongoing
conflict
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran
increasing
the
risk
of
the
proxy
wars
between
the
two
rivals
in
yemen
and
syria
growing
into
open
warfare
however
with
the
saudis
now
getting
support
they
will
probably
be
content
to
wait
and
see
the
effects
of
renewed
sanctions
and
as
this

at

that
also
makes
aggression
from
iran
far
less
in
all
more
simmering
looks
more
likely
than
a
full
so
the
upward
pressure
on
oil
that
we
have
seen
recently
from
the
middle
east
will
fade
into
the
background
for
a
situation
in
europe
brings
on
a
sense
of
déjà
vu
it
is
eerily
reminiscent
of
when
the
many
announcements
of
the
death
of
the
european
union
were
somewhat
premature
there
is
some
risk
here
but
history
suggests
that
this
too
shall
the
geopolitical
situation
in
the
middle
east
has
of
course
been
a
major
factor
in
supply
considerations
in
recent
days
and
while
that
has
influenced
wti
on
several
occasions
the
main
upward
push
has
been
in
brent
even
more
fuel
has
been
added
to
that
by
the
opec
led
cuts
in
production
have
remained
in
place
despite
