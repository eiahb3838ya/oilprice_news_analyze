don't underestimate the trade war impact on oil demand
a
squeeze
on
oil
demand
is
looming
as
a
result
of
the
trade
war
a
senior
bp
executive
told
reuters
acknowledging
the
bullish
effect
of
sanctions
on
iran
in
the
short
term
janet
kong
bp
s
chief
executive
of
oil
trading
operations
in
asia
said
this
effect
will
be
as
the
market
absorbs
the
shock
and
moves
on
to
other
going
into
i
worry
about
the
impact
of
the
trade
war
manifesting
itself
slowly
the
executive
said
the
trade
war
impact
has
not
really
shown
up
in
the
data
anywhere
but
it
will
show
up
gradually
over
time
so
the
supply
shock
is
very
sharp
and
prompt
while
the
impact
from
trade
war
is
boiling
over
there
have
been
voices
warning
that
the
trade
war
will
affect
oil
demand
as
it
affects
economic
growth
in
china
but
official
oil
demand
forecasts
have
yet
to
factor
it
in
it
seems
opec
s
latest
monthly
oil
market
report
however
did
revise
the
cartel
s
forecasts
for
oil
demand
in
down
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
warning
that
global
economic
growth
may
international
energy
agency
on
the
other
hand
has
kept
its
demand
forecast
unchanged
in
the
latest
fundamentals
update
at
million
bpd
up
from
this
year
s
projected
million
bpd
yet
the
agency
noted
that
demand
could
be
stronger
were
it
not
for
the
trade
war
and
signs
of
stalling
economic
growth
in
emerging
economies
related
oil
is
a
distinct
possibilitywhile
general
economic
growth
patterns
are
dependent
on
a
host
of
different
factors
the
trade
war
is
outside
the
normal
course
of
events
and
according
to
kong
likely
to
drag
on
for
quite
a
while
which
would
extend
the
duration
of
its
negative
effect
on
oil
the
trump
administration
wants
intellectual
property
protection
kong
said
reducing
subsidies
to
chinese
soes
enterprises
and
open
market
access
by
all
businesses
which
are
difficult
in
my
view
for
the
chinese
government
to
agree
to
so
it
s
very
likely
this
war
will
drag
on
for
a
long
