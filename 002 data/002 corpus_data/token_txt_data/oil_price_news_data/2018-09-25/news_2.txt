schlumberger to buy russia's leading drilling company
the
past
four
years
have
been
a
century
low
point
for
western
foreign
investment
in
russia
with
sanctions
unlawful
trade
practices
and
ceaseless
wars
in
the
greater
middle
east
antagonizing
the
sides
even
further
against
such
a
difficult
background
when
virtually
no
western
major
brave
enough
to
enter
the
russian
market
and
most
american
firms
rolling
back
projects
it
is
doubly
notable
what
schlumberger
is
doing
in
fact
schlumberger
seems
to
be
one
might
say
finally
on
the
brink
of
concluding
a
milestone
russia
deal
which
would
greatly
fortify
its
standing
as
the
world
s
leading
oil
services
company
by
buying
into
russia
s
largest
onshore
drilling
firm
eurasia
drilling
company
edc
it
could
secure
access
to
a
massive
market
irrespective
of
political
tensions
well
almost
news
that
schlumberger
is
allegedly
keen
on
acquiring
edc
first
emerged
in
early
even
then
several
months
after
the
introduction
of
a
ban
on
any
western
participation
in
arctic
or
shale
projects
it
raised
eyebrows
as
an
excessively
ambitious
undertaking
schlumberger
initially
wanted
to
gain
immediate
and
full
control
over
edc
s
equity
then
agreed
to
a
of
and
in
the
end
somewhat
grudgingly
acquiesced
to
offer
billion
for
because
russian
authorities
were
concerned
about
the
potential
loss
of
an
influential
element
of
the
nation
s
oil
sector
to
be
followed
by
a
acquisition
three
years
later
of
the
remaining
confronted
with
massive
bureaucratic
pushback
schlumberger
renounced
on
the
idea
pledging
to
look
for
m
a
possibilities
only
to
come
around
with
a
new
offer
two
years
fact
that
it
is
schlumberger
not
some
other
service
major
that
is
buying
russia
s
leading
oil
services
company
is
by
no
means
accidental
the
of
edc
alexander
dzhaparidze
neither
he
nor
the
other
owner
alexandr
putilov
are
under
sanctions
has
sold
his
first
oil
company
the
petroalliance
to
schlumberger
in
partially
on
the
money
generated
by
the
sale
dzhaparidze
bought
drilling
assets
by
the
private
major
lukoil
thus
the
development
of
edc
since
then
edc
and
schlumberger
have
forged
a
sort
of
a
strategic
alliance
in
with
several
of
each
other
s
russian
assets
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
acquisition
negotiations
related
here
s
what
s
next
for
russian
lngsince
however
a
whole
slew
of
things
has
changed
the
united
states
have
levied
their
umpteenth
round
of
sanctions
against
russia
and
very
few
are
those
who
still
believe
that
bilateral
relations
can
be
mended
anytime
soon
illustrating
the
depth
of
the
schism
the
russian
government
is
openly
saying
that
the
populace
should
brace
itself
for
years
if
not
decades
of
sanctions
eurasia
drilling
has
changed
too
following
the
failure
of
the
first
schlumberger
bid
in
late
the
top
management
effectuated
a
deal
and
shortly
after
going
private
edc
has
delisted
its
shares
from
the
london
stock
exchange
against
the
background
of
rising
oil
prices
a
genuine
feeling
of
cautious
optimism
in
the
global
markets
and
even
russia
s
gdp
bouncing
back
into
growth
in
schlumberger
launched
another
bid
in
july
the
oil
market
managed
to
test
the
bottom
and
rebound
back
into
almost
universally
palatable
levels
within
less
than
three
years
there
has
been
little
change
in
the
stance
of
russia
s
federal
antimonopoly
office
fas
it
is
comfortable
with
schlumberger
taking
anything
within
the
share
interval
fas
authorities
even
recommended
schlumberger
to
launch
a
joint
bid
with
russia
s
direct
investment
fund
or
a
uae
fund
this
is
a
highly
unlikely
scenario
as
letting
in
the
russian
government
would
definitely
not
serve
edc
s
aim
to
derisk
its
activities
especially
so
as
a
powerful
company
the
oil
giant
rosneft
seemed
very
eager
to
immerse
edc
in
the
past
despite
rosneft
s
statements
to
the
contrary
there
is
no
guarantee
that
it
will
not
give
it
another
go
once
its
debt
burden
eases
related
why
peak
oil
demand
doesn
t
matterall
in
all
edc
is
interested
in
schlumberger
as
a
buyer
schlumberger
is
interested
in
edc
to
provide
a
big
boost
to
its
russia
presence
statistics
differ
on
edc
s
market
share
however
generally
it
is
located
within
the
interval
against
such
a
constellation
a
deal
of
some
sorts
ought
to
emerge
at
one
point
and
despite
sporadic
antics
from
russian
authorities
there
have
been
encouraging
signs
in
the
past
few
weeks
pointing
towards
such
a
mutually
acceptable
solution
odd
as
it
may
seem
the
latest
presumed
deal
setup
reflects
the
geopolitical
conditions
between
russia
and
the
united
states
as
it
stands
the
russian
government
is
conditioning
the
deal
with
schlumberger
on
the
us
firm
granting
its
rights
on
a
part
of
its
technologies
to
a
russian
entity
in
case
it
decides
to
leave
the
country
spurred
by
further
us
should
be
noted
that
the
list
of
specific
technologies
to
be
retained
is
still
a
matter
of
negotiations
so
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
on
the
edc
saga
schlumberger
also
agreed
to
relocate
edc
which
is
currently
a
cayman
company
to
russia
also
preliminarily
agreeing
to
the
state
s
local
content
requirements
with
regard
to
edc
s
equipment
and
component
procurement
schlumberger
s
readiness
to
accept
the
sanctions
clause
might
be
the
missing
piece
to
the
puzzle
if
the
deal
goes
forward
for
once
a
separate
us
treasury
approval
is
also
required
it
will
be
the
biggest
russian
oil
investment
in
the
sanctions
era
a
timely
and
poignant
reminder
that
sometimes
the
oil
community
is
better
off
