is the saudi-russia oil bromance at risk?
a
week
before
opec
and
allies
meet
in
vienna
to
discuss
a
new
oil
production
cut
the
market
is
still
wondering
whether
the
leaders
of
the
opec
and
arabia
and
cement
their
cooperation
in
managing
the
oil
market
by
agreeing
on
a
fresh
cut
to
prevent
a
glut
and
prop
up
s
not
unusual
for
russia
to
leave
everyone
guessing
until
the
very
last
moment
whether
it
is
on
board
with
a
production
has
done
so
in
all
previous
meetings
since
its
cooperation
with
riyadh
started
two
years
ago
in
november
s
unusual
this
time
around
is
that
next
week
s
meeting
will
be
much
more
politically
charged
than
previous
president
donald
trump
the
party
weeks
before
it
begins
with
comments
that
he
hopes
there
won
t
be
a
cut
with
a
arabia
tweet
and
an
urge
for
even
lower
oil
prices
while
basically
declining
to
blame
saudi
arabia
and
its
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
for
the
murder
of
jamal
without
president
trump
s
recent
comments
on
oil
prices
and
the
khashoggi
affair
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
reading
from
the
same
book
but
they
are
not
exactly
on
the
same
page
about
where
they
want
oil
prices
to
arabia
is
not
happy
at
all
with
brent
crude
at
needs
much
higher
prices
probably
closer
to
to
balance
its
budget
russia
on
the
other
hand
doesn
t
need
as
high
oil
prices
as
the
saudis
do
and
due
to
its
complex
oil
taxation
system
russian
companies
benefit
more
from
lower
oil
prices
and
higher
production
moscow
also
moved
in
early
november
to
cap
wholesale
fuel
prices
to
prevent
further
gasoline

politically
sensitive

for
president
vladimir
putin
who
has
also
enacted
an
unpopular

reform

age
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
said
at
the
end
of
an
opec
panel
meeting
in
early
november
that
the
group
needed
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
balance
the
market
and
that
opec
analysis
shows
that
a
cut
of
million
bpd
may
be
needed
to
restore
market
balance
amid
fears
that
oversupply
has
started
to
build
again
related
natural
gas
prices
fall
below
zero
in
texasat
the
same
time
russia
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
warned
against
hasty
decisions
on
another
in
oil
production
policies
and
said
that
he
would
be
discussing
potential
oil
production
cuts
with
russian
producers
who
don
t
appear
too
keen
to
start
cutting
again
after
the
meeting
in
june
gave
them
leeway
to
ramp
up
output
to
record
highs
officially
russia
says
that
it
will
continue
cooperation
with
saudi
arabia
in
the
oil
market
but
its
still
dodging
any
specifics
about
a
possible
production
as
for
the
need
to
limit
production
or
not
i
will
not
say
anything
about
this
for
the
time
being
we
must
be
very
careful
in
this
respect
because
every
word
is
important
and
affects
the
federal
budget
revenues
however
it
is
obvious
that
we
should
cooperate
and
we
will
cooperate
putin
said
in
believe
that
despite
dubious
economic
benefits
from
high
oil
prices
for
moscow
putin
will
find
the
political
gain
boosting
russia
s
influence
in
the
middle
will
have
russia
agree
to
cuts
proposed
by
saudi
trump
and
mohammed
bin
salman
are
all
scheduled
to
attend
the
summit
in
buenos
aires
this
week
putin
and
trump
are
expected
to
meet
there
and
so
are
putin
and
mbs
the
summit
in
argentina
may
turn
out
to
be
the
first
leg
of
next
week
s
meeting
in
vienna
at
which
the
saudi
and
russian
energy
ministers
and
novak
may
only
seal
what
their
respective
bosses
will
have
agreed
upon
in
buenos
aires
related
the
biggest
losers
of
the
current
oil
price
slumpriyadh
however
is
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
it
definitely
needs
and
wants
oil
prices
higher
than
but
trump
s
support
for
mohammed
bin
salman
could
lead
the
saudis
to
refrain
from
angering
the
president
saudi
arabia
may
refrain
from
announcing
a
decisive
sizeable
cut
next
week
opting
instead
for
a
quiet
cut
not
worded
as
a
production
cut
at
announcements
are
not
unusual
at
statements
stressing
on
market
stability
are
opec
s
specialty
the
june
meeting
for
example
ended
with
the
vaguest
of
announcements
for
striving
for
compliance
instead
of
percent
and
more
in
previous
months
and
the
saudis
and
russians
interpreted
it
as
raising
production
by
million
bpd
the
outcome
of
next
week
s
meeting
may
not
be
much
commitment
to
market
stability
and
some
percentage
of
compliance
open
to
interpretation
by
the
key
oil
price
makers

arabia
