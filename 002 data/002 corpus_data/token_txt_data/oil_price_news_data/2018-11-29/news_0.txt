the biggest winners of the oil price slump
brent
crude
has
sunk
to
us
a
barrel
with
wti
down
to
us
and
not
surprisingly
talk
about
brent
hitting
us
a
barrel
by
the
end
of
the
year
is
suddenly
scarce
importers
are
breathing
a
sigh
of
relief
no
doubt
and
exporters
are
probably
beginning
to
worry
the
news
about
lower
oil
prices
is
good
it
s
good
for
the
emerging
markets
as
a
bloomberg
review
of
the
situation
showed
and
as
common
sense
would
suggest
every
us
drop
in
the
price
of
oil
translates
into
a
of
gdp
increase
in
income
in
the
biggest
oil
importers
an
estimate
by
capital
economics
cited
by
bloomberg
economic
growth
in
these
same
emerging
markets
slowed
down
this
year
prompting
a
number
of
forecasters
to
revise
down
their
oil
demand
projections
lower
oil
prices
would
probably
spur
more
demand
especially
if
the
dollar
weakens
as
right
now
the
strong
greenback
is
serving
as
a
deterrent
to
oil
demand
demand
is
good
for
producers
as
a
general
rule
but
it
has
to
come
at
the
right
price
and
as
usual
producers
of
crude
and
importers
of
the
commodity
have
different
views
of
what
the
right
price
is
indeed
that
us
decline
in
the
price
of
oil
according
to
capital
economics
would
translate
into
percent
lower
gdp
in
most
gulf
states
and
percent
lower
gdp
in
the
uae
russia
and
this
is
not
the
best
of
news
it
seems
the
gulf
economies
are
quite
resilient
to
oil
price
shocks
capital
economics
estimated
that
even
if
prices
went
lower
to
us
a
barrel
and
even
us
some
gulf
economies
including
saudi
arabia
the
uae
kuwait
and
qatar
would
be
able
to
plug
their
budget
deficits
from
the
forex
reserves
for
at
least
a
decade
one
interesting
point
capital
economics
makes
is
that
the
uae
could
fund
its
budget
deficit
indefinitely
which
certainly
sounds
pretty
bold
related
natural
gas
prices
fall
below
zero
in
texasthe
imf
however
recently
warned
that
gulf
economies
remain
vulnerable
to
oil
price
shocks
the
fund
acknowledged
that
in
several
countries
including
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
higher
oil
revenues
earlier
this
year
had
more
than
offset
increases
in
public
spending
there
is
a
tangible
risk
that
the
commitment
to
implement
key
fiscal
measures
and
structural
reforms
will
weaken
amid
higher
oil
now
that
prices
have
slumped
again
these
economies
will
get
the
necessary
motivation
to
continue
their
diversification
efforts
so
they
would
be
ultimately
positive
for
them
as
well
and
yet
many
seem
to
expect
this
price
slump
to
be
and
prices
to
return
to
levels
above
us
a

information
service
tom
kloza
for
one
told
cnbc
last
week
he
expected
prices
to
rebound
before
long
as
both
brent
and
wti
were
currently
being
oversold
oil
can
be
stabilized
in
december
and
will
be
helped
by
the
higher
demand
as
refiners
ramp
up
to
over
barrels
a

use

juices
up

as
well

analyst
explained

bp
is
comfortable
with
oilwhat
s
more
most
analysts
seem
to
expect
opec
to
agree
on
a
production
cut
of
at
least
million
bpd
and
also
most
expect
russia
to
agree
to
join
the
cut
despite
its
usual
guardedness
in
making
any
definite
announcements
before
the
deadline
which
this
time
is
december
when
the
cartel
will
meet
in
will
push
prices
higher
probably
prompting
another
critical
tweet
from
president
trump
and
once
again
put
emerging
economies
under
the
twin
pressure
of
expensive
oil
and
costly
dollars
but
some
such
as
morgan
stanley
don
t
see
the
cut
as
a
certainty
the
investment
bank
estimates
the
likelihood
of
a
cut
agreement
at
means
there
is
a
good
chance
russia
which
hasn
t
been
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
of
new
cuts
so
at
current
levels
and
then
that
scenario
of
capital
economics
with
oil
at
us
and
even
us
might
materialize
the
consequences
would
be
interesting
to
watch
in
both
emerging
economies
