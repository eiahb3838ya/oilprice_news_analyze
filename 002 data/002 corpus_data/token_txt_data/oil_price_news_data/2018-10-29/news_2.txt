can angola overhaul its struggling oil industry?
it
is
quite
rare
for
african
national
oil
companies
nocs
to
liberalize
especially
in
countries
that
are
heavily
dependent
on
oil
revenues
yet
angola
whose
stability
was
sent
reeling
by
the
oil
price
crash
of
is
making
great
strides
in
transforming
the
national
champion
sonangol
into
a
more
accountable
and
competitive
business
entity
with
this
the
new
presidential
administration
hopes
the
whole
of
angola
s
oil
production
would
swing
back
to
growth
or
at
least
settle
for
a
lengthy
stagnation
the
scope
is
genuinely
ambitious
the
new
government
wants
to
restructure
sonangol
terminate
the
company
s
sole
right
privileges
sell
off
some
off
its
assets
including
several
fields
as
well
as
to
create
a
national
oil
and
gas
agency
which
would
take
over
sonangol
s
regulatory
and
most
cases
numbers
are
more
than
enough
to
explain
such
a
swift
policy
turn
in
the
case
of
angola
it
is
doubly
so
most
of
angola
s
production
is
deepwater
and
making
it
especially
susceptible
to
sudden
oil
drops
and
other
market
shocks
having
survived
two
such
occurrences
in
and
angolan
oil
production
in
general
fell
from
a
level
of
mbpd
to
the
current
mbpd
similarly
the
national
oil
company
sonangol
saw
its
oil
output
drop
by
some
percent
to
mbpd
moreover
to
the
angolan
authorities
utmost
regret
the
year
ended
with
no
exploration
drilling
whatsoever
just
for
the
sake
of
comparison
witnessed
wildcats
drilled
no
matter
how
hard
the
task
of
ramping
up
crude
production
in
a
mature
environment
the
case
for
reform
sonangol
vs
angola
crude
production
source
opec
from
falling
production
there
are
also
other
indicators
that
point
to
the
inevitability
of
structural
reform
in
one
of
africa
s
foremost
extraction
states
foreign
currency
reserves
have
halved
since
oil
prices
fell
dramatically
in
leaving
lourenço
with
no
other
option
than
to
devalue
the
angolan
kwanza
which
should
have
been
done
a
long
time
ago
not
january
sonangol
has
been
ailing
financially
too
first
it
sought
out
development
loans
from
the
chinese
development
bank
in
then
the
angolan
government
had
to
hand
it
out
a
billion
cash
infusion
in
so
that
the
national
oil
champion
can
pay
out
its
debts
and
arrears
as
sonangol
finds
it
increasingly
more
difficult
to
secure
financing
from
leading
banks
it
relies
more
on
money
dragging
further
down
angola
s
public
debt
standing
which
is
expected
to
drop
by
per
cent
this
year
to
percent
of
lourenço
transparency
drive
also
has
political
motives
in
order
to
lessen
the
grip
of
the
dos
santos
over
the
country
s
leading
firm
he
dismissed
isabel
dos
santos
the
former
president
s
daughter
and
concurrently
africa
s
richest
businesswoman
the
new
chairman
carlos
saturnino
guerra
sousa
e
oliveira
is
a
technocratic
figure
thus
a
suitable
candidate
to
help
lourenço
dismantle
the
nepotist
ties
that
held
angola
s
energy
sector
together
thus
far
in
fact
lourenço
s
only
politically
viable
way
out
is
to
construct
a
more
inclusive
energy
sector
that
would
accommodate
a
wider
spectrum
of
interests
than
merely
those
of
a
close
political
circle
otherwise
angola
s
populace
would
erupt
in
dissatisfaction
even
though
angola
s
part
of
gdp
coming
from
oil
production
slid
from
percent
in
to
the
current
percent
it
is
a
most
needed
change
related
face
extinctionthe
structural
reform
plan
is
in
fact
the
continuation
of
a
dos
santos
revamp
initiative
that
was
never
really
translated
into
reality
it
includes
the
reshaping
of
ministries
already
done
mining
and
petroleum
ministries
were
merged
into
one
the
establishment
of
a
new
regulator
to
lessen
sonangol
s
role
in
regulatory
matters
if
all
goes
well
the
national
hydrocaron
and
biofuel
agency
anhb
will
be
created
next
year
with
anhb
taking
over
as
overall
manager
of
angola
s
concessions
a
role
which
previously
was
the
prerogative
of
sonangol
sonangol
s
restructuring
will
also
entail
its
shedding
of
activities
ending
years
of
financially
dubious
investments
in
healthcare
real
estate
and
creation
of
a
new
regulatory
agency
automatically
triggers
the
question
as
to
what
would
happen
with
existing
concessions
when
they
are
transferred
to
the
new
entity
when
indonesia
carried
out
the
same
measure
in
deals
valid
at
that
time
were
left
intact
as
the
new
regulator
simply
acknowledged
their
validity
the
ongoing
restructuring
drive
actually
allows
the
angolan
government
to
readapt
existing
concession
by
granting
out
more
favorable
terms
to
investors
in
return
for
their
pledges
to
intensify
drilling
in
angola
the
above
measures
altogether
would
leave
sonangol
worse
off
smaller
in
complexity
the
company
now
boasts
a
hundred
subsidiaries
and
scale
however
would
definitely
turn
out
to
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
country
on
the
back
of
new
oil
investments
related
the
real
reason
europe
finally
attempts
to
stabilize
libya
the
new
government
is
also
intent
on
selling
some
sonangol
assets
to
streamline
the
company
s
operations
selling
deepwater
blocks
and
previously
licensed
out
to
cobalt
int
energy
in
the
kwanza
basin
is
the
first
step
it
is
estimated
that
more
will
follow
along
the
privatization
lines
there
is
even
more
a
new
gas
framework
is
a
key
element
in
the
angolan
reform
drive
heretofore
when
a
gas
discovery
was
made
any
contract
holder
would
not
be
entitled
to
it
as
sonangol
was
stipulated
as
the
sole
owner
of
the
nation
s
gas
reserves
the
contracts
usually
dealt
only
with
liquids
following
the
adoption
of
the
natural
gas
framework
law
foreign
entities
can
fully
claim
both
associated
and
gas
reserves
even
though
the
law
has
no
automatic
retroactive
effect
companies
can
reclaim
reserves
in
case
they
relinquished
angolan
ministry
of
mineral
resources
and
oil
proposed
listing
sonangol
on
an
internationally
recognized
exchange
at
some
point
in
the
future
although
this
remains
a
function
of
president
lourenço
success
in
reforming
the
angolan
energy
sector
all
in
all
angola
s
production
is
expected
to
stagnate
for
the
next
years
at
roughly
mbpd
by
if
the
energy
sector
s
reshaping
reaches
its
logical
conclusion
angola
will
have
sowed
the
seeds
of
future
success
a
more
sonangol
and
more
international
majors
is
definitely
the
only
path
forward
and
the
new
administration
knows
this
yet
a
swift
return
to
political
infighting
and
resource
nationalism
remains

latent
