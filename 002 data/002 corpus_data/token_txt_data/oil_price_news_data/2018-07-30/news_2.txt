saudis wonâ€™t suspend oil exports to the west
aramco
is
unlikely
to
suspend
crude
oil
exports
after
the
houthi
missile
attacks
against
two
saudi
tankers
in
the
bab
el
mandeb
strait
the
national
reports
citing
oil
analysts
riyadh
announced
that
it
would
stop
shipments
via
the
chokepoint
after
the
attacks
and
this
sparked
worry
that
saudi
exports
would
be
disrupted
raising
it
is
unlikely
that
saudi
arabia
would
allow
such
a
dent
in
overall
saudi
export
volumes
should
not
be
reduced
by
this
decision
although
there
will
be
some
disruptions
and
the
announcement
has
created
concerns
in
the
crude
market

this
