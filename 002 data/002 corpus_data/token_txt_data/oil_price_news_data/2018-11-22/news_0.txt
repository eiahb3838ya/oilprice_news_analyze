can oil solve washingtonâ€™s syria dilemma?
in
the
past
seven
years
syrian
cities
have
been
reduced
to
rubble
thousands
have
lost
their
lives
but
the
main
objective
of
the
and
its
allies
to
remove
bashar
has
failed
as
of
november
government
forces
loyal
to
assad
have
recaptured
significant
swaths
of
land
from
rebels
two
areas
have
escaped
their
grasp
idlib
protected
by
turkey
and
eastern
syria
protected
by
the
ankara
needs
to
cooperate
with
russia
and
iran
to
obstruct
the
creation
of
an
autonomous
kurdish
region
and
prevent
new
flows
of
refugees
towards
its
territory
washington
s
primary
goal
however
is
to
maintain
a
foothold
in
syria
in
order
to
contain
is
confronted
by
two
challenges
in
achieving
its
goal
a
working
economy
in
eastern
syria
and
a
rebellious
turkey
ankara
strongly
opposes
the
kurdish
ypg
which
is
the
backbone
of
the
sdf
forces
that
have
established
control
over
the
area
eastern
syria
however
contains
the
resource
by
which
washington
can
overcome
both
challenges
two
sides
of
syriasyria
is
usually
divided
into
roughly
two
parts
western
syria
and
eastern
syria
the
majority
of
the
population
before
the
conflict
lived
in
the
urban
areas
of
western
syria
which
includes
the
cities
of
damascus
hama
homs
and
aleppo
these
areas
had
the
highest
contribution
to
national
economic
output
despite
the
destruction
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
these
areas
will
become
the
epicenter
of
economic
activity
syria
on
the
contrary
is
the
less
productive
part
of
the
country
due
to
its
relative
underdevelopment
before
the
war
when
the
last
meaningful
inquiries
were
made
the
region
had
an
illiteracy
rate
of
percent
compared
to
the
national
average
of
percent
of
the
workforce
in
eastern
syria
percent
worked
in
agriculture
compared
to
a
national
average
of
its
low
economic
output
the
eastern
region
is
actually
the
breadbasket
of
syria
and
contains
the
majority
of
the
nation
s
energy
resources
before
the
war
the
country
produced
barrels
of
oil
per
day
of
which
were
exported
the
challenge
currently
is
not
production
but
transportation
before
the
war
a
kilometers
long
pipeline
transported
the
oil
to
a
transport
terminal
on
the
mediterranean
sea
in
western
syria
this
pipeline
is
currently
out
of
order
as
the
west
is
controlled
by
forces
loyal
to
syria
revivedwashington
s
efforts
to
oppose
and
depose
president
assad
have
failed
attempts
to
unite
rebel
groups
and
provide
them
with
training
and
weapons
didn
t
have
the
desired
results
the
sdf
in
eastern
syria
of
which
the
kurdish
ypg
is
the
backbone
has
been
the
exception
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
declared
that
the
syrian
kurds
have
been
great
partners
and
added
washington
would
make
sure
that
the
kurds
have
a
seat
at
the
table
autonomous
kurdish
region
bordering
turkey
would
be
the
scenario
come
true
for
ankara
the
turks
have
declared
on
multiple
occasions
that
the
kurdish
issue
is
a
red
line
unfortunately
for
ankara
washington
does
seem
willing
to
change
its
course
concerning
its
support
for
the
kurds
the
has
tried
to
appease
turkey
by
putting
bounties
on
several
pkk
leaders
ankara
however
interpreted
these
steps
as
an
effort
to
separate
the
ypg
from
the
pkk
related
the
oil
industry
is
facing
a
capex
conundrum
despite
the
intractable
position
of
both
the
and
turkey
washington
could
bring
the
parties
together
on
basis
of
mutual
interests
and
economic
dependency
eastern
syria
contains
percent
of
the
country
s
oil
resources
the
kurds
have
already
struck
a
minor
deal
with
the
syrian
government
under
the
mediation
of
moscow
to
share
a
third
of
the
barrels
per
day
produced
at
rmailan
oilfield
energy
however
could
also
moderate
ankara
s
position
the
kurdish
issue
by
providing
an
incentive
to
as
glueturkey
and
eastern
syria
are
complementary
to
each
other
in
terms
of
energy
production
and
consumption
the
kurdish
controlled
areas
could
potentially
produce
large
quantities
of
oil
while
turkey
already
imports
percent
of
its
energy
from
abroad
ankara
opposition
concerning
washington
involvement
is
not
by
definition
aimed
towards
the
kurds
but
the
ypg
dominant
has
already
established
working
relations
with
another
autonomous
kurdish
region
in
iraq
despite
ankara
s
strong
opposition
towards
the
independence
referendum
of
iraqi
kurdistan
in
october
the
pipeline
has
been
restarted
if
washington
is
able
to
mitigate
the
ypg
s
role
and
convince
turkey
of
the
benefits
in
working
with
the
remaining
syrian
kurds
both
parties
could
benefit
greatly
