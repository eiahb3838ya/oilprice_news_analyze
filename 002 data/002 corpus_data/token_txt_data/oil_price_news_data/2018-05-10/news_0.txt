permian bottleneck provides huge opportunity for oil traders

face

shipping
the
oil
to

gulf
coast
refineries

export

so
thin
has
become
pipeline
capacity
that
the

price
of
midland
texas
crude
was
trading
early
this
week
at
a
discount
of
nearly
a
barrel
to
the

in
discount
is
now
large
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
sending
midland
crude
oil
by
rail
as
crude
by
rail
typically
costs
to
a
barrel
shipping
permian
oil
in
railcars
to

would
in

bring

around

dutta
believes
that

even

shutting

is
not
an

option
in

as
the

very
steep

some

the
