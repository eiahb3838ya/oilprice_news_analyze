is this lithium battery breakthrough too good to be true?
it
would
be
a
dull
month
if
a
new
rechargeable
battery
project
didn
t
make
headlines
amid
all
the
excitement
surrounding
electric
cars
this
month
s
indisputable
winner
is
the
battery
that
replaces
cobalt
with
iron
at
least
according
to
the
people
who
came
up
with
the
potential
implications
of
this
invention
are
huge
cobalt
is
enjoying
a
very
strong
rally
as
demand
is
estimated
to
skyrocket
with
the
influx
of
electric
cars
in
the
world
s
biggest
markets
notably
china
and
the
united
states
so
is
lithium
but
the
iron
battery
is
unlikely
to
have
an
impact
on
lithium
demand
also
theoretically
the
iron
battery
could
put
some
battery
makers
out
of
idea
of
using
iron
in
batteries
isn
t
new
but
so
far
attempts
to
substitute
the
cheap
metal
for
costlier
cobalt
and
other
metals
have
ended
in
disaster
christopher
wolverton
professor
of
materials
science
and
engineering
at
northwestern
university
had
two
problems
to
solve
to
make
his
battery
work
first
replace
cobalt
with
iron
second
trick
oxygen
into
taking
part
in
the
reaction
that
moves
the
lithium
ions
from
the
anode
to
the
cathode
and
back
again
as
the
battery
is
charged
and
second
challenge
was
the
bigger
one
the
widespread
opinion
in
science
circles
is
that
using
oxygen
in
the
reaction
taking
place
in
a
rechargeable
battery
makes
the
concoction
inside
unstable
and
oxygen
escapes
making
the
reaction
irreversible
and
the
battery
that
s
why
wolverton
and
his
team
first
made
the
battery
on
a
computer
to
see
if
it
would
work
surprisingly
for
all
it
better
than
the
most
popular
iron
battery
uses
four
lithium
ions
instead
of
just
one
like
current
batteries
do
for
now
it
can
only
utilize
one
of
these
but
there
s
potential
for
making
use
of
all
four
considerably
increasing
the
battery
s
efficiency
related
is
an
oil
price
correction
overdue
that
s
really
exciting
but
the
official
news
release
is
shy
on
the
experimental
aspect
of
the
team
s
work
there
s
mention
that
there
was
an
author
in
charge
of
the
experimental
work
but
all
the
details
about
the
composition
of
the
battery
and
the
reaction
are
about
the
computations
the
team
made
these
computations
were
used
to
make
the
physical
battery
but
the
experimental
stage
of
the
project
is
likely
at
an
early
further
experiments
confirm
the
initial
results
this
battery
has
the
potential
to
transform
many
that
deal
in
rechargeable
cars
to
smartphones
and
wearables
iron
is
among
the
cheapest
metals
in
the
world
with
a
metric
ton
currently
trading
for
less
than
to
compare
the
futures
on
cobalt
on
the
london
metal
exchange
is
per
metric
ton
even
that
would
be
enough
to
make
the
new
battery
a
hit
if
its
viability
is
confirmed
the
greater
durability
would
also
be
a
welcome
a
battery
like
that
the
ev
revolution
could
truly
take
