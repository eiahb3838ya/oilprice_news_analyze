oil selloff gives trump more room on iran
the
trump
administration
has
been
going
back
and
forth
over
how
hard
it
plans
on
pushing
countries
to
cut
their
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
after
softening
the
tone
earlier
this
month
the
government
appears
to
be
going
back
to
its
hardline
on
sanctions
which
threatens
to
shut
in
the
bulk
of
iranian
has
rejected
requests
from
a
group
of
ministers
from
germany
france
the
uk
to
provide
exemptions
to
sanctions
on
iran
for
certain
industries
the
intention
was
to
allow
european
companies
to
engage
in
some
business
with
iran
washington
rejected
the
overture
so
it
can
apply
maximum
pressure
on
has
said
that
it
would
only
continue
to
participate
in
the
nuclear
accord
so
long
as
the
european
union
can
somehow
guarantee
the
benefits
promised
under
the
deal
sanctions
will
make
europe
s
task
exceedingly
difficult
if
not
first
wave
of
sanctions
take
effect
in
august
and
the
letter
sent
to
european
ministers
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
treasury
secretary
steven
mnuchin
said
that
the
would
only
grant
exemptions
if
it
was
in
the
specific
interest
of
national
security
or
on
humanitarian
grounds
there
has
already
been
an
exodus
of
companies
doing
business
in
iran
and
the
letter
from
the
two
trump
cabinet
members
underscores
the
hardline
approach
from
saudi
arabia
solution
to
rising
gas
pricesthe
letter
comes
about
a
week
after
pompeo
appeared
to
soften
the
american
position
there
will
be
a
handful
of
countries
that
come
to
the
united
states
and
ask
for
relief
we
ll
consider
it
he
told
sky
news
arabia
during
a
visit
to
abu
the
and
israel
reportedly
formed
a
joint
working
group
a
few
months
ago
to
focus
on
fomenting
or
at
least
encouraging
internal
unrest
in
iran
the
actions
are
extraordinary
and
aggressive
and
point
to
a
desire
for
regime
change
in
iran
even
if
that
goal
is
not
the
explicit
policy
of
the
trump
the
next
wave
of
sanctions
set
to
take
effect
in
november
will
be
much
more
important
to
watch
than
the
upcoming
august
sanctions
the
is
hoping
to
cut
iranian
oil
exports
down
to
zero
as
a
state
department
official
put
it
in
june
various
comments
since
then
have
led
to
some
confusion
opening
the
door
to
the
possibility
of
some
waivers
in
the
event
that
the
oil
market
suffers
from
too
much
recent
days
the
trump
administration
did
little
to
clear
up
its
position
we
want
people
to
reduce
oil
purchases
to
zero
but
in
certain
cases
if
people
ca
do
that
overnight
we
consider
exceptions
sec
of
treasury
mnuchin
told
reporters
on
friday
that
sounded
like
a
backtracking
from
all
the
talk
of
taking
iran
exports
down
to
recent
comments
from
mnuchin
did
little
to
clear
up
the
confusion
we
ve
said
very
specifically
there
s
no
blanket
waivers
there
s
no
grandfathering
mnuchin
said
we
want
to
be
very
careful
in
the
around
the
energy
markets
to
make
sure
that
people
have
the
he
also
added
the
state
department
has
the
ability
to
issue
waivers
around
significant
reductions
in
the
oil
markets
that
s
something
that
treasury
and
state
will
be
related

chinathe
sudden
plunge
in
oil
prices
could
grant
the
trump
administration
more
leeway
as
it
tries
to
shut
in
iranian
supply
the
spike
in
oil
prices
in
late
june
seemed
to
cause
some
hesitation
on
the
application
of
iran
sanctions
by
the
the
selloff
in
oil
prices
especially
if
it
holds
could
have
the
opposite
arabia
and
russia
have
suggested
that
could
provide
more
than
the
million
barrels
per
day
that
they
pledged
last
month
in
the
event
that
the
oil
market
needs
it
the
return
of
bpd
from
libya
also
gives
the
a
lot
more
room
to
tighten
the
screws
on
iran
without
upsetting
the
oil
market
too
much
also
the
trump
administration
is
considering
options
on
releasing
oil
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
which
again
would
seek
to
offset
supplies
from
disrupted
locations
around
the
remains
to
be
seen
but
the
recent
selloff
in
oil
prices
and
the
restoration
of
oil
from
libya
means
that
the
trump
administration
has
a
lot
more
room
to
take
the
hardline
position
that
it
wants
to
take
