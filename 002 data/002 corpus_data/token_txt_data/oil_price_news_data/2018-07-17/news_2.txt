why is venezuela still sending subsidized oil to cuba?
in
the
past
oil
has
accounted
for
percent
of
venezuela
exports
and
over
percent
of
government
revenues
now
as
the
nation
s
economy
continues
to
crumble
amid
sanctions
political
strife
and
low
oil
prices
the
venezuela
s
oil
production
is
plummeting
in
fact
last
month
s
production
was
the
lowest
in
years
at
million
barrels
a
day
in
desperation
the
struggling
administration
has
even
begun
to
shut
down
production
proactively
as
their
terminal
storage
meets
maximum
capacity
and
the
government
faces
major
bottlenecks
at
storage
facilities
and
oil
production
and
exports
drop
the
venezuelan
government
has
even
less
money
to
buy
essentials
like
food
medicines
and
other
basic
goods
a
crisis
growing
worse
all
the
time
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
has
said
that
the
brutal
economic
crisis
underway
in
venezuela
is
one
of
the
worst
in
modern
history
the
nation
s
once
powerful
economy
has
plummeted
percent
in
the
last
five
years
and
the
imf
projects
that
it
will
shrink
percent
in
alone
inflation
rates
will
reach
in
the
middle
of
the
chaos
a
collapsing
regime
widespread
hunger
medical
shortages
there
is
one
holdover
from
the
socialist
platform
that
autocratic
president
nicolas
maduro
has
refused
to
lapse
on
despite
the
crisis
on
his
own
soil
maduro
continues
to
grant
generous
oil
subsidies
to
small
island
nation
not
without
its
own
economic
issues
has
been
dependent
on
cheap
venezuelan
oil
since
the
after
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
comrade
cuba
was
in
economic
shambles
it
was
at
this
point
that
they
turned
to
venezuela
crude
oil
in
exchange
for
sending
skilled
laborers
across
the
caribbean

yamal
lng
is
conquering
chinanow
as
venezuela
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
into
an
extreme
economic
depression
few
could
have
predicted
that
they
would
still
be
making
good
on
that
agreement
with
cuba
even
the
cubans
themselves
have
been
scrambling
for
new
sources
of
cheap
crude
last
year
venezuela
even
cut
off
exports
to
cuba
for
eight
months
but
then
once
again
began
sending
shipments
of
light
oil
to
cuba
and
curacao
in
march
at
a
great
cost
to
their
own
refineries
which
are
running
at
just
a
small
fraction
of
their
capacity
thanks
to
lack
of
maintenance
and
drained
all
this
amazingly
there
was
a
reported
shipment
of
barrels
of
venezuelan
crude
shipped
to
northwestern
cuba
last
week
sparking
an
uproar
back
at
home
venezuela
continues
to
supply
cuba
with
around
barrels
of
oil
per
day
costing
the
nation
around
billion
per
year
an
unthinkable
generosity
when
million
venezuelans
are
reporting
that
they
can
only
afford
to
eat
once
a
day
this
money
could
be
channeled
into
turning
around
venezuela
s
own
crisis
to
curb
inflation
and
import
desperately
needed
medicines
that
can
no
longer
be
found
on
empty
venezuelan
is
a
new
albeit
small
ray
of
hope
however
for
venezuela
s
ailing
economy
on
july
mexico
overwhelmingly
elected
a
leftist
president
for
the
first
time
in
decades
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
known
locally
as
amlo
pledged
on
the
campaign
trail
to
bring
mexico
s
foreign
policy
back
to
a
standard
of
this
would
mean
walking
back
current
neoliberal
mexican
president
enrique
s
efforts
to
build
a
regional
alliance
against
maduro
and
put
pressure
on
him
to
ease
up
on
his
increasingly
despotic
public
outcry
against
maduro
s
continued
financial
support
of
cuba
as
his
own
people
without
food
and
desperately
needed
medicines
the
reality
is
that
cuba
is
one
of
venezuela
s
last
remaining
allies
even
if
mexico
is
no
longer
actively
working
against
maduro
s
regime
they
won
t
be
supporting
it
the
way
that
cuba
has
and
continues
to
do
the
sad
truth
is
that
maduro
has
and
likely
will
continue
to
put
politics
over
people
and
cheap
oil
will
continue
to
flow
out
of
the
pockets
of
venezuela
and
into
the
ports
of
havana
