surpassed
and
oil
executives
from
the
middle
east
to
texas
no
doubt
popped
some
champagne
the
big
question
is
whether
or
not
shale
will
spoil
the
party
by
ramping
up
production
to
extraordinary
heights
setting
off
another
eia
made
headlines
a
few
days
ago
when
it
predicted
that
oil
production
would
surge
this
year
and
next
topping
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
shale
executives
repeatedly
promised
their
shareholders
that
they
would
be
prudent
this
time
around
eschewing
a
mentality
that
so
often
led
to
higher
levels
of
ultimately
to
lower
oil
prices
shale
executives
repeatedly
insisted
in
that
they
would
not
return
to
an
aggressive
drilling
stance
even
if
oil
prices
will
soon
find
out
if
oil
in
the
can
entice
shale
drillers
to
shed
their
caution
and
jump
back
into
action
in
a
dramatic
way
for
its
part
goldman
sachs
seems
to
believe
the
promises
from
the
shale
investment
bank
said
that
at
an
industry
conference
in
miami
on
january
shale
executives
reiterated
their
strategies
of
caution
shale
producers
are
largely
not
looking
to
use
oil
in
their
budgets
and
spoke
more
proactively
about
debt

goldman

global
oil
demand
is
set
to
grow

this

a

the

that
guidance
announcements
in

will
be
key
to
figuring
out
if
shale
drillers
will
follow
through

their

of

on
a
series
of
comments
at
the
conference
goldman
cited
a
long
list
of
shale
companies
that
will
use
extra
cash
from
higher
oil
prices
to
either
pay
down

or
to
