oil
well
at
a
shale
field
in
western
china
could
finally
mean
a
strong
commercial
potential
for
shale
oil
for
the
first
time
in
the
world
s
top
crude
importer
according
to
morgan
stanley
petrochina
achieved
a
daily
production
rate
of
tons
of
oil
or
barrels
from
the
jimsar
oil
field
in
the
western
xinjiang
province
which
suggests
that
shale
drilling
could
finally
have
a
true
commercial
potential
in
china
bloomberg
quoted
a
morgan
stanley
note
as
we
believe
the
jimsar
shale
oil
discovery
is
likely
to
trigger
china
s
shale
oil
revolution
morgan

analyst
andy
meng
wrote
in
the
potential
for
more
drilling
would
likely
increase
capex
for
shale
this
year
and

companies
the
investment
bank
said
the
shale
boom
in
china
however
would
be
just
a
fraction
of
the
shale
stanley
expects
chinese
shale
oil
production
could
be
bpd
by
which
is
nothing
compared
to
the
millions
of
barrels
of
oil
pumped
in
the
every
day
according
to
eia
estimates
the
seven
key
shale
regions
in
the
produced
million
bpd
in
january
and
a
increase
is
expected
for
s
biggest
energy
producers
have
started
to
tap
more
tight
oil
and
gas
wells
recently
aiming
to
increase
domestic
oil
and
natural
gas
production
at
the
world
s
largest
crude
oil
part
of
a
government
push
to
boost
domestic
energy
supply
china
national
petroleum
corporation
cnpc
and
sinopec
are
raising
investments
to
increase
local
oil
and
gas
production
and
are
accelerating
drilling
at
tight
oil
and
gas
formations
in
western
china
the
companies
said
last
demand
continues
to
grow
in
china
while
domestic
production
has
been
declining
in
recent
years
due
to
the
depletion
of
mature
conventional
oil
fields
this
has
led
to
making
china
the
world
s
largest
crude
oil
importer
chinese
president
xi
jinping
has
ordered
the
companies
to
boost
domestic
production
of
oil
and
gas
and
firms
are
starting
to
follow
the
policy
