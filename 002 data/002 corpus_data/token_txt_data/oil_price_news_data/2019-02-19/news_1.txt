cheaper natural gas is coming to europe
the
european
union
recently
updated
its
gas
pipeline
rules
in
a
bid
to
assuage
concerns
about
its
deepening
dependence
on
russian
gas
the
move
was
generally
praised
by
nord
stream
opponents
but
guardedly
since
the
update
did
not
halt
the
project
but
will
merely
slow
it
however
controversial
the
project
will
be
among
the
factors
that
will
benefit
gas
consumers
in
europe
amid
stiffer
competition
from
other
exporters
of
natural
the
largest
gas
market
in
europe
and
biggest
buyer
of
russian
gas
as
well
as
the
strongest
supporter
of
nord
stream
said
it
will
build
two
lng
terminals
as
part
of
efforts
to
diversify
its
sources
of
the
fuel
as
it
phases
out
coal
and
nuclear
power
plants
under
pressure
from
the
green
lobby
lng
is
a
natural
candidate
for
these
terminals
but
not
the
only
one
russia
s
novatek
also
exports
lng
to
europe
and
since
its
yamal
plant
is
quite
a
bit
closer
to
the
continent
than
cheniere
energy
s
sabine
pass
plant
its
prices
are
more
means
russia
is
playing
on
the
european
gas
market
with
two
players
rather
than
just
one
and
that
would
make
it
more
challenging
for
lng
to
grab
a
bigger
market
share
yet
the
challenge
can
be
overcome
as
deputy
energy
secretary
dan
brouillette
said
earlier
this
year
during
a
visit
to
germany
as
more
lng
production
capacity
comes
on
stream
in
the
united
states
prices
will
fall
further
making
the
commodity
competitive
with
russian
piped
gas
and
russian
doubt
how
soon
this
will
happen
and
one
of
these
is
commodity
strategist
christopher
louney
from
rbc
capital
last
month
louney
told
cnbc
europe
taking
lng
and
lng
challenging
russian
pipeline
supplies
for
dominance
are
two
very
different
things
europe
has
already
taken
lng
over
the
past
two
years
with
just
a
couple
of
export
terminals
in
operation
with
more
export
facilities
coming
online
the
number
of
takers
and
volume
taken
can
both
increase
but
there
is
a
long
way
to
go
to
compete
with
russia
for
it
won
t
happen
overnight
in
other
words
but
lng
does
have
a
promising
future
in
europe
related
does
saudi
arabia
really
have
as
much
oil
as
analysts
think
but
there
is
another
competitor
that
will
be
joining
the
race
soon
the
pipeline
which
will
carry
natural
gas
from
the
caspian
sea
to
europe
tap
is
a
key
part
of
the
southern
gas
key
infrastructure
project
for
europe
aimed
at
diversifying
gas
supplies
away
from
russia
and
bringing
natural
gas
from
the
caspian
sea
region
to
european
markets
the
southern
gas
corridor
consists
of
several
separate
energy
projects
with
a
total
investment
of
around
us
billion
the
us
shah
deniz
gas
development
in
azerbaijan
which
bp
and
its
partners
started
up
in
july
last
year
is
the
starting
point
of
the
southern
gas
more
gas
is
coming
into
europe
over
the
next
few
years
and
demand
will
likely
continue
growing
as
it
has
been
for
the
last
four
years
according
to
figures
from
the
oxford
energy
institute
as
is
usually
the
case
more
supply
will
pressure
prices
and
stimulate
even
stronger
demand
this
may
add
a
challenge
to
producers
efforts
to
keep
their
prices
low
but
profitable
but
the
challenge
is
just
part
of
the
