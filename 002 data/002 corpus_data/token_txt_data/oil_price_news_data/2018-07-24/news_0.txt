s
a
good
chance
that
a

and
other

could
be
up

colorado

tried
to
ban

succeeded
two
years
ago
colorado
s
supreme
court
overturned
bans
on
fracking
in
fort

and
longmont
because
it
found
that
they
conflicted
with
the
application
of
the
state
s
oil
and
gas
conservation
the

organizers
to
push

even
if

wins
approval
the

republican
majority
in

senate
could
move

the
republican
