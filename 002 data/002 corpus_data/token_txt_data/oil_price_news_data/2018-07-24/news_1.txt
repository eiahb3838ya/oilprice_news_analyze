can china replicate the u.s. shale boom?
the
world
s
largest
gas
importer
is
also
home
to
the
world
s
largest
reserves
of
shale
that
is
just
sitting
there
at
least
for
now
china
has
been
struggling
to
repeat
the
shale
revolution
for
a
number
of
reasons
chief
of
them
geology
but
now
it
may
have
the
chance
to
advance
its
shale
gas
agenda
technology
is
what
will
make
all
the
has
recoverable
shale
gas
reserves
of
trillion
cu
ft
the
latest
estimate
of
the
energy
information
administration
from
shows
this
makes
the
country
the
biggest
reservoir
of
shale
gas
with
argentina
a
distant
second
with
a
little
over
trillion
cu
ft
yet
most
of
these
trillion
cu
ft
of
gas
are
in
geologically
challenging
shale
reserves
are
like
a
plate
in
relatively
good
shape
and
buried
evenly
close
to
the
surface
for
china
s
shale
reserves
it
s
more
like
a
plate
that
was
smashed
on
the
ground
and
then
stomped
on
we
re
trying
to
identify
those
scattered
reserves
and
trying
our
best
to
get
to
the
bigger
that
s
what
a
sinopec
chief
engineer
told
bloomberg
explaining
the
challenges
that
the
state
energy
giant
has
encountered
in
its
attempts
to
tap
the
country
s
enormous
shale
addition
to
the
geological
problems
there
is
also
the
issue
of
technology
exchange
fracking
tech
developers
are
wary
of
exporting
to
china
on
intellectual
property
concerns
so
chinese
companies
are
having
to
develop
their
own
technology
and
equipment
which
is
actually
fine
since
equipment
was
made
for
the
plate
rather
than
the
chinese
s
this
equipment
and
these
technologies
that
could
help
sinopec
and
cnpc
boost
their
currently
modest
shale
gas
production
last
year
china
produced
a
total
billion
cubic
meters
and
sinopec
and
cnpc
expect
shale
gas
production
to
rise
to
and
billion
cubic
meters
by
respectively
related
is
the
oil
world
in
panic
mode
this
compares
with
plans
for
annual
national
shale
gas
production
of
billion
cu
m
made
back
in
it
also
compares
to
estimated
total
annual
gas
demand
of
billion
cubic
meters
in
according
to
sanford
bernstein
since
the
government
has
revised
down
its
shale
gas
expectations
substantially
but
still
eyes
shale
gas
production
of
billion
cubic
meters
compared
with
sinopec
s
and
cnpc
s
plans
beijing
is
still
being
drilling
and
production
equipment
is
being
adjusted
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
chinese
shale
patch
and
costs
are
being
lowered
one
example
is
the
bridge
plug
bloomberg
reports
which
is
used
to
plug
wells
during
drilling
to
prevent
loss
of
gas
chinese
drillers
originally
bought
bridge
plugs
for
us
yuan
apiece
now
they
are
producing
them
for
us
yuan
and
exporting
them
to
the
company
that
supplied
them
with
bridge
plugs
pumps
are
also
being
adjusted
for
china
s
much
deeper
wells
since
those
manufactured
for
shale
gas
wells
are
not
powerful
enough
sinopec
for
one
has
developed
a
pressure
pump
that
s
percent
more
powerful
than
ones
it
has
also
cut
its
exploration
drilling
costs
by
percent
over
the
last
eight
years
by
making
all
its
drilling
equipment
analysts
believe
that
chinese
drillers
also
need
regulatory
changes
to
make
the
shale
gas
boom
happen
by
encouraging
more
competition
but
it
looks
like
the
state
giants
are
managing
even
without
a
lot
of
competition
uncomfortably
high
dependence
on
imports
is
a
powerful
motivator

irina
