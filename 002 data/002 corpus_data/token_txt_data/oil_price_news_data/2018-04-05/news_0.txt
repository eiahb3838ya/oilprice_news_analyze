does conoco know something that its competition doesn’t?
when
everyone
in
oil
seems
like
they
are
ready
to
pay
anything
for
a
piece
of
land
in
the
permian
basin
a
report
that
one
oil
company
is
actually
selling
permian
acreage
might
come
as
something
of
a
shock
it
doesn
t
make
sense
at
least
at
first
glance
but
conoco
this
week
announced
just
is
offloading
assets
in
the
permian
and
south
texas
to
the
tune
of
us
the
same
update
conoco
announced
the
acquisition
of
acreage
in
the
montney
conventional
play
in
canada
and
in
the
austin
chalk
in
louisiana
one
can
t
help
but
wonder
if
conoco
doesn
t
know
something
the
rest
of
big
oil
has
been
s
hardly
the
case
conoco
is
in
fact
following
its
strategy
of
buying
low
and
selling
high
while
securing
its
business
against
the
new
normal
in
oil
markets
which
comes
down
to
permanently
excessive
price
volatility
and
a
heightened
risk
of
another
meltdown
like
the
one
in
energy
vet
and
forbes
author
david
blackmon
noted
in
a
recent
story
that
the
news
about
conoco
s
asset
sale
in
the
permian
is
not
as
shocking
as
it
sounds
when
you
first
hear
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
assets
sold
for
conoco
blackmon
says
it
s
not
a
priority
to
hold
onto
all
its
acreage
in
the
hottest
shale
play
in
the
world
at
any
cost
the
company
s
priority
is
to
streamline
its
portfolio
as
much
as
possible
focusing
on
potentially
assets
and
offloading
the
conoco
has
not
left
the
permian
it
has
a
pretty
robust
position
there
the
assets
it
sold
were
small
underdeveloped
patches
of
land
conversely
the
montney
assets
are
adjacent
to
acreage
the
company
already
has
in
this
part
of
canada
and
they
cost
just
us
million
conoco
did
not
give
a
price
for
its
louisiana
acquisition
but
executive
vice
president
matt
fox
said
in
the
announcement
of
the
acquisitions
that
the
acreage
we
ve
acquired
in
louisiana
and
the
montney
has
the
potential
to
add
to
our
low
cost
of
supply
resource
base
without
requiring
significant
capital

trade
war
looms
over
oil
marketsthe
second
part
of
this
quote
is
important
conoco
is
in
no
rush
to
boost
its
capex
after
oil
prices
improved
unlike
many
of
its
peers
in
fact
it
is
keeping
its
belt
tightened
for
the
foreseeable
future
it
seems
and
it
is
already
reaping
the
benefits
of
this
the
past
months
conoco
s
share
price
gained
almost
percent
as
opposed
to
an
almost
slide
for
exxon
it
has
chosen
to
share
the
benefits
from
higher
oil
prices
with
its
shareholders
and
make
sure
there
will
be
more
of
these
benefits
to
s
sustaining
cost
per
barrel
is
us
at
the
start
of
february
the
company
announced
it
will
lift
the
dividend
by
percent
and
buy
back
shares
worth
us
billion
despite
booking
a
loss
for
conoco
also
paid
down
us
billion
in
debt
and
bought
back
us
billion
in
shares
besides
it
reported
a
organic
reserve
base
replacement
tactics
are
clear
enough
pay
down
debt
return
cash
to
shareholders
boost
reserve
base
it
sounds
like
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
under
any
circumstances
but
the
most
sensible
thing
has
not
been
a
characteristic
of
the
oil
industry
traditionally
growth
has
been
the
top
conoco
is
showing
its
peers
clearly
that
this
prioritization
is
flawed
it
is
also
demonstrating
that
the
best
acreage
is
not
necessarily
in
the
hottest
that
a
few
analysts
have
already
noted
conoco
is
bucking
the
trend
