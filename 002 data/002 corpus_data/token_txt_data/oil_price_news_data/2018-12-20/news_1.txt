a shocking amount of crucial u.s. pipelines still lack cybersecurity
pipeline
infrastructure
is
more
vulnerable
to
cyberattacks
than
desirable
because
of
insufficient
oversight
in
the
cybersecurity
department
a
report
commissioned
by
two
members
of
congress
has
reported
this
week
that
the
report
requested
by
senator
maria
cantwell
and
representative
frank
pallone
and
conducted
by
the
general
accountability
office
revealed
the
transport
security
administration
a
unit
of
homeland
security
does
not
have
a
procedure
in
place
that
can
be
used
to
update
cybersecurity
standards
for
pipelines
these
updates
are
necessary
to
reflect
revisions
in
cybersecurity
standards
that
are
seen
by
experts
in
the
field
as
the
cybersecurity
field
is
a
very
dynamic
one
with
attackers
unfortunately
proving
repeatedly
they
are
not
just
keeping
up
with
cybersecurity
efforts
but
sometimes
even
being
a
step
ahead
of
them
this
is
what
necessitates
updates
to
existing
standards
and
an
update
implementation
procedure
that
makes
for
fast
adoption
of
these
and
gas
pipelines
are
critical
infrastructure
and
as
such
they
are
among
the
top
targets
of
cybercriminals
according
to
experts
what
the
report
by
the
gao
found
was
that
the
transport
security
administration
trusted
pipeline
operators
to
evaluate
their
networks
and
report
whether
they
have
critical
facilities
that
could
become
a
target
for
s
not
good
enough
to
say
the
least
the
tsa
collected
the
in
order
to
classify
parts
of
operator
s
networks
as
more
or
less
vulnerable
but
it
turned
out
that
as
much
as
a
percent
of
the
operators
of
the
biggest
pipeline
systems
in
the
united
states
denied
having
critical
facilities
what
s
more
the
transport
security
administration
did
not
verify
the
information
supplied
by
pipeline
protecting
our
pipelines
and
the
people
who
live
and
work
near
them
must
be
a
top
priority
for
our
government
and
i
hope
this
report
will
prompt
the
trump
administration
to
start
treating
this
challenge
with
the
urgency
it
deserves
senator
cantwell
said
in
a
release
following
the
report
related
major
lng
shortage
increasingly
likelypipeline
cybersecurity
is
certainly
a
top
concern
especially
with
the
growing
automation
and
digitization
of
various
functions
that
gives
cybercriminals
more
potential
entry
points
into
a
network
work
is
being
done
but
if
we
are
to
believe
the
gao
report
not
enough
which
is
the
case
for
other
industries
as
well
in
the
opinion
of
most
cybersecurity
earlier
this
month
the
transport
security
administration
released
a
cybersecurity
roadmap
that
covered
all
transportation
sectors
including
pipelines
in
a
recent
overview
of
the
situation
in
lexology
norma
krayem
noted
that
unlike
other
comparable
industries
pipeline
networks
have
so
many
agencies
overseeing
them
a
debate
about
which
of
them
should
be
in
charge
of
cybersecurity
has
slowed
down
the
actual
implementation
of
cybersecurity
roadmap
krayem
said
was
the
document
that
put
an
end
to
the
debate
the
tsa
is
the
agency
in
charge
of
the
cybersecurity
and
physical
security
of
pipeline
systems
so
that
s
one
thing
that
is
settled
now
what
remains
is
the
more
important
task
put
actual
cybersecurity
standards
and
procedures
in
place
to
secure
this
part
of
the
critical
