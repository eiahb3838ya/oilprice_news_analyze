$50 oil wonâ€™t kill u.s. shale
even
before
the
latest
oil
price
plunge
that
sent
wti
crude
prices
to

analysts
had

the
explosive
growth
in
the
shale
patch
to
cool
off
a

next

until
the

pipeline
constraints
ease
in
the

half
of

is
set
to
continue
to
raise
crude
oil
production
but
as
wti
prices
dipped
to
below
the
psychologically
important
threshold
of

analysts
started
to
calculate
which
areas
may
have
already
fallen
into

prices
lower

be
sure
oil
production
is

s
fresh

plunge
could
make
more
shale
drillers
cut
capital
expenditure

more
of
them
may
cut
deeper
considering
that
few
had
anticipated
such
a
steep
drop
in
oil
prices
just
two
and
a
half

when

the

some
analysts
say
that
the
glory
days
for
shale
are
not
in
short
as
much
as
the
recent
price
slump
has
injected
a
fresh
dose
of
uncertainty
it
is
unlikely
to
derail
the
shale
engine
according
to
stephen
brennock
oil
analyst
at
pvm

the
fact
is
that
tight
oil
supply
is
expected
to
expand
by
at
