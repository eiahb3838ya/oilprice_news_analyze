shockwave in shipping could send brent soaring
january
is
just
seventeen
months
away
when
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
will
no
longer
permit
use
of
heavy
sulphur
marine
fuels
without
treatment

emissions

the
move
to
treat
sox
from
vessel
emissions
is
expected
to
reduce
global
air
pollution
human
health
issues
and
environmental
problems
suffice
it
to
say
the
rate
of
sox
scrubber
installations
appears
to
be
lower
than
imo
anticipates
vessels
will
undergo
scrubber
installation

from
the
current

and
within

mostly
in
north

and
europe
the

will
be
just

options
are
available
to
ship
owners
install
scrubbers
to
continue
using
high
sulphur
marine
fuels
or
pay
more
for
middle
distillate
fuels
like
marine
gasoil

and
diesel
that

with
the
new

neither
solution

from
roughly
to
million
usd
and
usually
takes

however
the

not

china
s
oil
futures
jump
to
record
highso
why
would
ship
owners
risk
higher
fuel
bills
because
additional
regulations
are
on
the
s
marine
environment
protection
committee
recently
adopted
an
initial
strategy
for
tackling
greenhouse
gas
emissions
ghgs
which
appears
to
target
carbon
intensity
and
total
ghg
emissions
one
goal
presented
courtesy
of
an
american
bureau
of
shipping
brief
is
to
reduce
the
total
annual
ghg
emissions
by
at
least
percent
by
compared
to
whilst
pursuing
efforts
towards
phasing
them
it
appears
the
imo
is
not
yet
finished
with
implementing
even
more
stringent
emissions
concern
is
that
future
imo
ghg
regulations
would
make
emissions
intensive
marine
fuels
obsolete
along
with
the
need
for
scrubbers
so
what
is
a
ship
owner
to
do
modifying
all
or
part
of
the
fleet
to
satisfy
one
regulation
may
be
risky
when
additional
regulations
are
being
developed
passing
on
scrubber
installation
and
evolving
the
business
to
less
emissions
intensive
fuels
may
be
the
preferred
path
of
the
majority
of
ship
about
million
barrels
per
day
of
high
sulphur
marine
fuels
are
consumed
by
the
global
fleet
but
there
are
signs
that
refiners
are
making
this
month
the
us
energy
information
administration
and
international
enterprise
singapore
reported
that
stockpiles
of
high
sulphur
marine
fuels
are
at
a
low
in
the
us
and
a
year
low
in
singapore
since
the
majority
of
international
vessels
won
t
have
scrubbers
before
january
low
inventories
of
high
sulphur
marine
fuels
indicate
that
refineries
are
shifting
volumes
toward
middle
distillates
accounted
for
roughly
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
consumption
in
according
to
the
latest
bp
statistical
review
an
increase
of
about
million
barrels
per
day
from
imo
sulphur
regulation
is
expected
to
increase
demand
for
distillates
but
also
demand
for
crudes
like
brent
this
presents
a
challenge

heavier
crudes

in
short

at
the
moment
venezuela
s

plummet
mexico

is
stagnant
canadian
production
is
expected
to
be
bottlenecked
by
pipeline
constraints
for
a
few
years
and
there
are
suggestions
that
saudi
arabia
s
spare

capacity
may
not
be
able
to
fill
the
current
gap
caused
by
increasing
demand
and
loss
of
supply
this
is
problematic
as
heavy
crudes
tend
to
produce
greater
middle
distillate
yields
than

morgan
stanley
suggests
the
imo
sulphur
regulation
coupled
with
economic
growth
scenarios
will
make
markets
for
brent
tighter
with
annual
demand
growth
at
million
barrels
per
day
since
new
barrels
of

reaching
markets
are
increasingly

will
be
paying
close
attention
to
middle
distillate
capacity
additions
and
availability
of
low

next
seventeen
months
the
approach
of
some
ship
owners
may
turn
into
a
stampede
for
scrubbers
if
imo
compliant

can
not
be
sufficiently
