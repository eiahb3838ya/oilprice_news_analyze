a rare state of affairs for refiners
the
global
oil
market
appears
to
be
even
as
the
production
cuts
begin
to
whittle
away
at
excess
barrels
but
while
crude
may
be
ample
there
are
growing
problems
within
the
market
for
refined
products
including
an
emerging
glut
of
bottom
line
is
that
gasoline
supply
is
surging
while
the
market
for
other
products
is
tightening
up
there
are
multiple
reasons
for
this
first
the
crude
slate
itself
is
helping
to
create
these
imbalances
the
surge
of
shale
production
has
made
the
global
crude
mix
lighter
and
sweeter
light
sweet
oil
tends
to
produce
relatively
more
gasoline
when
it
is
refined
medium
and
heavier
oils
produce
more
diesel
and
other
middle
distillates
and
less
output
has
surged
in
recent
years
leaving
refiners
with
more
crudes
to
process
at
the
same
time
because
of
skyrocketing
shale
production
is
backing
out
barrels
in
order
to
avoid
a
glut
of
crude
but
many
producers
within
the
cartel
churn
out
medium
and
heavy
barrels
so
light
oil
from
shale
is
surging
while
medium
and
heavier
barrels
are
being
held
are
a
few
more
factors
driving
the
divergence
in
the
crude
slate
venezuela
has
been
suffering
from
steep
declines
for
well
over
a
year
the
south
american
opec
member

heavy
oil
any
unexpected
outage
in
venezuela
due
to
unfolding
political
crisis
there
would
magnify
these
trends
mexico
another
heavy
oil
producer
has
seen
its
output
deteriorate
for
years
albeit
at
a
more
gradual
pace
than
venezuela
iran
too
is
losing
supply
related
the
most
important
oil
factor
in
the
upshot
is
that
light
oil
from
shale
has
surged
at
a
time
that
heavier
producers
from
elsewhere
have
suffered
declines
heavier
and
sour
crudes
which
have
historically
traded
at
a
discount
are
seeing
upward
pricing
pressure

told
s
p
global
effect
on
the
products
markets
is
even
starker
prices
for
gasoline
are
slumping
but
those
for
diesel
and
other
distillates
are
trading
at
a
premium
while
refiners
can
tweak
their
inputs
somewhat
there
are
limits
to
how
they
adjust
to
the
changing
mix
of
crude
some
refiners
are
simply
more
equipped
to
handle
heavier
oils
others
can
handle
lighter
as

prices
go
haywire
refiners
are
trying
to
ramp
up
supplies
of
diesel
and
other
distillates
but
with
more
diesel
comes
more
gasoline
refiners
can
t
simply
produce
one
without
the
other
as
a
result
as
refiners
chase
diesel
barrels
they
are
dumping
more
gasoline
onto
the
global
market
exacerbating
the
emerging
gasoline
glut
keeps
getting

on

week
saw
gasoline
stocks
reach
their
highest
level
since
records
began
so
it
comes
as
no
surprise
that
crack
spreads
for
gasoline
are
under
pressure

are

more
reasons
for
the
disruption
in
the
oil
supply
mix
the
international
maritime
organization
imo
has
rules
on
marine
fuels
that
take
effect
at
the
start
of
those
rules
require
ships
to
cut
the
concentration
of
sulfur
in
their
fuels
significantly
that
means
that
ships
will
have
to
stop
running
on
heavy
fuel
oil
which
is
high
in
sulfur
to
replace
dirtier
fuels
many
ships
will
switch
to
middle
distillates
that
may
ease
the
pressure
on
heavier
sour
oils
but
it
could
also
put
even
more
pressure
on
diesel
and
gasoil
another
distillate
some
point
refiners
may
not
be
able
to
take
on
more
light
oil
as
they
reach
a
limit
if
you
analyze
the
refining
system
of
the
world
they
are
designed
to
take
a
certain
percentage
of
light
crude
that
can
not
be
changed
dramatically

garcia
chief
economist
at
repsol
said
at
the
argus
americas
crude
summit
in
houston
that
means
refiners
may
have
to
curtail
processing
rates
which
would
undercut
demand
for
crude
oil
potentially
pushing
