chinese solar giant: “the party is definitely over”

roughly
last

the

pulled
state
support
for

beijing
indicated
at

the
curtailment
was
aimed
at
promoting
the
solar
energy
sector

sustainable
development
enhancing
its

quality
and
speeding
up
reduction
of
the
move
caught
many
by
surprise
but
may
best
be
explained
at
least
in
part
as
beijing
s
response
to
a
percent
tariff
put
in
place
last
year
on
chinese
solar
equipment
by
president
trump
the
president
s
decision
was
a
response
to
several
american
solar
companies
claim
that
china
solar
subsidies
were
allowing
its
solar
companies
to
undercut

up
reformby
september
even
as
trade
relations
between
the

worsened
beijing
sought
to
speed
up
its
efforts
to
ensure
its
wind
and
solar
power
sectors
could
compete
without
subsidies
and
achieve
what
new

draft
guidelines
called
grid
price
parity
with
traditional
energy
sources
like
coal
all
the
while
china
needs
a
strong

beijing
tries
to
diversify
its
energy
mix
away
from
dirty

coal
used
for
power
generation
to
renewables

well
as
natural

support
for
solar
on
such
a
massive
scale
not
only
brought
concern
from
foreign
solar
manufacturers
but
was
also
a
large
burden
on
state
coffers
that
ran
in
to
the
billions
of
dollars
annually
just
by
china
owned
some
billion

subsidies
to

beijing
s
withdrawal
of
support
caused
global
solar
panel
prices
to
fall
around
percent
last
year
a
boon
for
companies
that
needed
to
invest
in
solar
infrastructure
but
caused
headwinds
