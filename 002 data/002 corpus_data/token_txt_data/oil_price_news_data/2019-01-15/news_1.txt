u.s. ‘tough line’ on iran depends on crude prices
the
government
is
planning
on
taking
a
tougher
line
on
iran
in
the
months
ahead
redoubling
its
efforts
to
cut
iran
s
oil
exports
down
to
hook
the
state
department
s
special
representative
for
iran
boasted
earlier
this
week
about
the
success
in
curtailing
iran
s
oil
exports
to
date
in
an
interview
with
bloomberg
hook
noted
that
when
the
trump
administration
withdrew
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
last
may
iran
was
exporting
million
barrels
per
day
now
he
says
iran
s
exports
are
down
near
or
below
in
fact
in
those
first
six
months
we
took
off
roughly
a
million
barrels
of
oil
we
did
that
without
increasing
the
price
of
oil
hook
told
bloomberg
in
an
there
s
a
lot
more
to
come
we
are
going
to
continue
our
path
to
get
to
zero
hook
said
referring
to
the
administration
s
goal
of
zeroing
out
iran
s
oil
exports
however
when
pressed
on
when
that
might
happen
hook
demurred
telling
bloomberg
that
the
campaign
to
zero
also
needs
to
be
balanced
against
national
security
and
economic
s
the
rub
cutting
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
was
always
going
to
be
tricky
because
it
would
likely
contribute
to
significant
increase
in
oil
prices
in
fact
the
decided
in
november
to
issue
sanctions
waivers
to
eight
countries
importing
oil
from
iran
precisely
because
it
was
worried
about
the
effect
on
oil
time
around
to
be
sure
there
is
a
lot
more
room
for
the
trump
administration
to
maneuver
the
oil
market
entered
into
a
state
of
surplus
in
the
fourth
quarter
a
development
that
stemmed
from
the
ramp
up
of
supply
from
opec
countries
in
anticipation
of
major
outages
from
iran
the
surplus
could
allow
the
to
take
a
harder
line
tightening
the
screws
on
iran
we
are
not
looking
to
grant
any
new
waivers
that
s
been
our
policy
from
the
beginning
hook
said
we
are
not
looking
to
grant
any
exceptions
to
our
campaign
of
maximum
economic
he
conceded
that
such
an
effort
to
be
stingier
with
waivers
is
contingent
upon
oil
prices
the
granted
waivers
to
japan
south
korea
india
china
taiwan
turkey
italy
and
greece
they
expire
in
may

said
the

are

on

problem
for
the
is
that
it
still
hasn
t
figure
out
a
way
to
reconcile
the
twin
goals
of
low
oil
prices
and
zero
exports
from
iran
the
same
puzzle
that
bedeviled
american
officials
last
fall
remains
even
though
the
oil
market
is
now
that
could
change
in
the

arabia

a

another
round
of
cuts

saudi
arabia
alone
will
cut
output
by

from
october

taking
production
basically
back
to
where
it
was
before
the
asked
it
to
increase
supply
to
offset
losses
from
other
words
the
recent
oil
supply
glut
seemingly
gives
the
government
more
leeway
to
take
a
harsher
line
on
iran
but
is
already
cutting
output
which
will
take
away
some
of
that
make
matters
more
complex
the
government
has
sent
very
mixed
signals
about
its
approach
to
the
middle
east
a
few
weeks
ago
president
trump
announced
a
withdrawal
of
troops
from
syria
and
has
expressed
a
desire
to
reduce
american
commitments
to
the
region
that
was
followed
by
a
damage
control
tour
of
the
middle
east
by
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
trump
s
national
security
adviser
john
bolton
both
of
which
sought
to
dial
back
trump
s
stated
goal
of
troop
withdrawal
related
fears
of
shale
demise
may
be
overblownmeanwhile
the
new
york
times
reported
that
bolton
has
been
itching
for
a
reason
to
go
to
war
with
iran
and
that
his
request
to
draw
up
military
options
against
iran
has
raised
concerns
within
the
for
oil
there
are
also
mixed
messages
trump
s
personal
desire
seems
to
be
low
oil
prices
at
all
costs
but
bolton
along
with
mike
pompeo
and
brian
hook
all
want
to
ratchet
up
the
pressure
on
this
shakes
out
remains
to
be
seen
but
the
hawks
might
feel
constrained
if
the
oil
market
continues
to
tighten
oil
prices
are
up
more
than
percent
from
their
december
lows
but
are
still
rather
low
if
oil
remains
at
current
price
levels
the
hawks
in
the
trump
administration
could
have
room
to
if
the
cuts
begin
to
drain
the
surplus
and
oil
prices
steadily
rise
over
the
next
four
to
five
months
the
trump
administration
may
be
back
to
where
it
was
in
october
feeling
a
little
too
skittish
about
cutting
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
because
of
fears
over
driving
oil
prices
too
