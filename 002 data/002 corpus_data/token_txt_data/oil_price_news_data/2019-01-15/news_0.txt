oil markets could see deficit in 2019
the
oil
supply
surplus
is
starting
to
reverse
according
to
a
new
report
from
bank
of
america
merrill
investment
bank
noted
that
oil
prices
had
collapsed
in
late
not
only
because
of
an
oversupply
problem
but
also
because
of
other
factors
including
the
selloff
of
long
positions
by
hedge
funds
and
other
market
managers
as
well
as
by
fear
and
uncertainty
in
broader
financial
markets
still
the
bottom
line
was
that
the
oil
market
saw
a
glut
once
again
emerge
in
the
fourth

forecasts
vary
quite
a
bit
but
a
dozen
or
so
investment
banks
largely
agree
that
the
selloff
in
late
december
which
pushed
brent
down
to
per
barrel
had
gone
too
far
bofaml
is
betting
that
brent
rises
back
to
per
the
investment
bank
issued
a
rather
significant
caveat
this
assessment
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
global
economy
does
not
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
bofaml
analysts
said
that
brent
could
plunge
as
low
as
per
barrel
if
global
gdp
growth
slows
from
percent
to
this
point
it
is
anybody
s
guess
if
the
global
economy
slows
by
that
much
but
there
is
a
growing
number
of
indicators
that
at
least
suggests
such
a
deceleration
is
possible
the
recent
data
from
china
showing
a
shocking
slowdown
in
both
imports
and
exports
is
discouraging
exports
fell
percent
in
december
from
a
year
earlier
while
imports
crashed
by
percent
suggesting
that
the
world
s
second
largest
economy
is
starting
to
weaken

bank

merrill
lynch
estimates
that
supply
from
will
fall
by
a
whopping
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
this
year
compared
to
the
fourth
quarter
of
that
figure
includes
the
of
agreed
upon
cuts
plus
substantial
losses
from
iran
and
venezuela
those
significant
declines
combined
with
slower
shale
growth
and
a
steady
increase
in
demand
should
be
enough
to
tip
the
oil
supply
balance
into
deficit
territory
bofaml
on
a
net
basis
we
see
aggregate
global
oil
supply
growth
of
just
thousand
in
and
a
deficit
building
into
the
summer
months
the
bank
said
moreover
the
supply
surplus
that
did
emerge
in
late
was
much
smaller
than
the
one
that
occurred
between
and
the
most
recent
surplus
totaled
perhaps
million
barrels
compared
to
around
surplus
in
the
period
according
to
scotiabank
in
that
context
erasing
the
glut
should
be
easier
to
achieve
related
norway
s
oil
production
to
fall
to
lowas
such
top
officials
do
not
seem
overly
concerned
market
sentiment
today
is
being
shaped
by
undue
concerns
about
demand
underestimation
of
the
impact
of
agreed
supply
cuts
and
a
misreading
of
the
trends
which
causes
counterfactual
actions
by
financial
players

oil
minister
khalid
said
at

atlantic

s
global
energy
forum
in
abu
in
other
words
if
we
look
beyond
the
noise
of
weekly
data
and
vibrations
in
the
market
and
the
speculators
behavior
i
remain
convinced
that
we
are
on
the
right
track
and
that
the
oil
market
will
quickly
return
to
balance
he
of
the
key
variables
to
watch
is
iran
s
oil
exports
levels
waivers
granted
to
countries
importing
oil
from
iran
expire
in
may
the
top
official
dealing

sanctions
brian
hook
hinted
at
the
same
conference
in
abu
dhabi
that
the
american
government
wouldn
t
be
as
lenient
this
time
around
all
i
can
say
is
that
certainly
when
we
have
a
better
supplied
oil
market
then
that
will
put
us
in
a
better
path
to
reducing
iranian
crude
exports
to
zero
