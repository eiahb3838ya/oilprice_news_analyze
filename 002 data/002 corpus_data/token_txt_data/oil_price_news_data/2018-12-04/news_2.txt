is this the next disaster for canadian drillers?
the
government
of
alberta
this
week
took
an
unprecedented
decision
to
enforce
a
crude
oil
production
cut
so
excess
inventories
could
be
shrunk
and
the
price
of
western
canadian
grades
could
improve
but
the
industry
s
problems
are
far
from
over
they
will
be
among
the
hardest
hit
by
the
international
maritime
organization
s
new
emission
rules
to
enter
into
effect
in
two
years
which
will
require
a
reduction
of
the
sulfur
content
of
bunkering
fuel
to
percent
from
we
ve
got
challenges
with
respect
to
pipelines
we
ve
got
challenges
with
respect
to
rail
and
now
we
ve
got
challenges
with
respect
to
our
demand
market
bloomberg
quoted
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
canadian
energy
research
institute
as
saying
at
a
presentation
this
week
the
emission
rules
will
start
affecting
the
price
of
canadian
crude
next
year
allan

along
with
other
analysts
crude
is
heavy
and
sour
that
is
high
in
sulfur
content
which
is
the
obvious
reason
why
the
imo
changes
would
affect
prices
adding
to
already
substantial
pressure
from
pipeline
bottlenecks
and
the
rising
amount
of
crude
that
is
being
transported
by
costlier
to
ihs
markit
analyst
kurt
barrow
the
emission
rules
will
make
canadian
crude
another
cheaper
than
west
texas
intermediate
in
even
the
completion
of
the
line
replacement
project
won
t
offset
these
losses
although
it
will
add
bpd
to
daily
pipeline
analyst
wood
mackenzie
research
director
mark
oberstoetter
told
bloomberg
western
canadian
select
will
likely
be
us
cheaper
than
wti
for
most
of
which
is
the
cost
of
railway
transportation
for
albertan
heavy
crude
all
in
all
things
are
looking
pretty
bad
but
how
bad
is
bad
related
opec
oil
exports
jump
ahead
of
meetingfor
one
thing
canadian
heavy
is
the
main
heavy
crude
feedstock
for
refineries
canada
is
in
fact
the
biggest
exporter
of
crude
to
the
united
states
at
a
rate
of
over
million
bpd
as
of
september
according
to
data
from
the
energy
information
administration
which
compares
with
around
million
bpd
from
opec
there
aren
t
a
whole
lot
of
alternative
sources
of
heavy
crude
what
with
venezuela
spiraling
down
into
a
deeper
crisis
and
production
falling
along
with
another
the
new
emission
rules
will
not
eliminate
demand
for
fuel
oil
it
will
only
reduce
it
reuters
recently
polled
refiners
on
their
imo
plans
and
found
that
although
as
much
as
percent
planned
to
stop
producing
fuel
oil
the
rest
had
no
plans
to
suspend
production
despite
the
expected
drop
in
demand
instead
they
were
upgrading
their
refineries
to
further
process
the
residual
petroleum
product
into
more
gasoline
and
diesel
and
also
banking
on
stable
demand
from
the
power
generation
sector
when
fuel
oil
becomes
cheap
enough
it
serves
as
an
alternative
to
new
emission
rules
will
definitely
present
a
new
challenge
to
albertan
producers
on
top
of
what
they
already
have
to
deal
with
however
the
importance
of
their
crude
for
refineries
and
the
low
prices
that
have
opened
up
the
chinese
refining
market
for
more
canadian
oil
exports
should
serve
as
a
cushion
against
major
price
and
production
