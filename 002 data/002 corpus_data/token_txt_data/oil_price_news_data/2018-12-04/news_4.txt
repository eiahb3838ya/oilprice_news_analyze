a
proposed

for
suing

for
market
manipulation
is
a
big
concern
among

and
may
weigh
on

cohen
the
head
of

research
at
barclays
told
cnbc
on
i
think
it
s
something
that
could
very
easily
weigh
on
the
messaging
of
this
meeting
that
is
going
to
happen
on
thursday
and
friday
cohen
told
cnbc
when
asked
to
comment
on
the
proposed
legislation
in
light
of
the
current
divisions
within
opec
especially
qatar
quitting
the
proposed
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
nopec
pave
the
way
to
antitrust
lawsuits
in
the
against
the
cartel
and
its
national
oil
companies
if
of
antitrust
legislation
aimed
at
opec
were
discussed
at
various
times
under
presidents
george
bush
and
barack
obama
but
they
both
threatened
to
veto
such
may
this
year
the
nopec
act
was
introduced
again
such
legislation
would
make
opec
subject
to
antitrust
laws
by
removing
a
state
immunity
shield
created
by
judicial
president
donald
trump
s
continued
criticism
of
opec
and
the
way
the
cartel
manipulates
the
oil
market
and
prices
opec
members
are
concerned
that
the
legislation
may
pass
this
time
it
is
certainly
possible
that
a
country
that
is
looking
to
enhance
or
burnish
its
ties
to
the
united
states
may
look
at
the
nopec
legislation
and
say
well
we
don
t
want
to
be
a
part
of
this
organization
anymore
cohen
told
cnbc
is
also
said
to
have
urged
all
its
members
not
to
mention
specific
oil
prices
and
to
instead
stick
to
the
market
stability
narrative
in
public
comments
about
oil
policies
to
avoid
the
risk
of
potential
antitrust
lawsuits
for
manipulating
the
market
if
the
united
states
passes
the
