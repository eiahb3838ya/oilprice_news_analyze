iran: oil to fall to $40 if opec fails to reach deal
a
fractured
opec
is
meeting
later
this
week
to
discuss
a
deal
to
cut
oil
rebalance
the
market
and
lift
oil
prices
that
have
recently
slipped
to
below
most
of
the
cartel
members
needs
a
unanimous
vote
to
pass
decisions
such
as
curtailing
production
yet
of
opec
s
biggest
producers
but
also
one
of
the
most
sidelined
members
in
recent
that
the
group
is
unlikely
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
sizeable
cut
of
around
million
bpd
as
some
are
suggesting
such
a
failure
to
act
decisively
would
send
oil
prices
plunging
to
a
barrel

governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
told
bloomberg
in
an
cartel
and
its
allies
may
not
extend
their
cooperation
pact
either
according
to
iran
s
representative
at
position
typically
held
by
the
second
most
powerful
oilman
in
a
cartel
member
after
the
oil
has
repeatedly
expressed
frustration
with
the
increase
in
oil
production
since
june
to
offset
what
was
expected
to
be
a
steep
decline
in
iranian
oil
supply
with
the
sanctions
on
tehran
s
petroleum
and
shipping
s
oil
exports
indeed
dropped
by
some
million
bpd
but
they
are
likely
still
holding
onto
above
million
bpd
while
waivers
to
eight
iranian
customers
allow
buyers
to
continue
purchasing
oil
at
reduced
volumes
until
the
end
of
april
next
prices
have
plunged
by
around
percent
from
early
october
as
the
market
started
to
fear
an
oversupply
is
building
up
again
due
to
record
high
production
in
saudi
arabia
and
russia
and
an
high
oil
output
in
the
united
states
coupled
with
fears
of
slowing
economic
and
oil
demand
i
doubt
with
the
failure
they
had
in
the
last
three
months
that
the
declaration
of
cooperation
gets
extended
kazempour
told
bloomberg
referring
to
the
alliance
related
are
oil
markets
about
to
turn
around
why
institutionalize
a
failure
and
it
needs
unanimity
to
be
extended
he
for
one
will
not
take
part
in
any
cuts
while
there
are
sanctions
on
its
oil
kazempour
said
adding
that
those
who
increased
production
should
be
the
ones
to
cut
that
is
the
saudis
and
russians
and
few
arab
gulf
states
like
the
uae
and
now
they
are
asking
others
to
share
in
the
cut
whoever
increased
they
should
cut

told
reuters
on
the

crashed
the

and
all
passengers
are
now
in
critical
condition

opec

and
however
agreed
this
weekend
to
extend
the
deal
russia
s
president
vladimir
putin
said
although
he
admitted
there
isn
t
an
agreement
on
specific
cuts
but
we
together
with
saudi
arabia
will
do
this
and
whatever
final
figure
we
will
decide
upon
we
agreed
that
we
will
monitor
the
market
situation
and
promptly
respond
to
it
putin
the
general
framework
between
opec
and
may
be
in
place
saudi
arabia
will
have
to
appease
growing
frustration
at
smaller
members
within
opec
and
convince
them
to
fall
in
line
in
order
to
get
a
unanimous
vote
on
some
sort
of
production
cuts
which
may
not
even
be
worded
as
reduced
output
related
the
saudi
dilemma
to
cut
or
not
to
cutdays
before
the
december
meeting
in
vienna
qatar
surprisingly
announced
on
monday
that
it
would
be
quitting
opec
as
of
january
as
it
focuses
on
natural
to
iran
s
kazempour
qatar
is
not
the
only
one
frustrated
with
opec
s
recent
decisions
especially
the
ones
taken
by
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
jmmc
there
are
many
other
opec
members
frustrated
that
the
jmmc
is
deciding
on
production
unilaterally
and
without
the
required
prior
consensus
of
opec
kazempour
told
opec
members
may
need
some
convincing
but
a
higher
price
of
oil
is
not
an
insignificant
argument
for
many
of
the
cartel
members
who
can
t
balance
their
budgets
at
a
barrel
looks
like
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
ready
to
continue
managing
the
oil
market
and
will
have
their
way
one
way
or
they
can
t
get
consensus
on
a
wording
with
million
barrels
per
day
of
cuts
they
can
always
bet
on
a
vague
statement
of
market
stability
declaration
of
cooperation

adjust
compliance
