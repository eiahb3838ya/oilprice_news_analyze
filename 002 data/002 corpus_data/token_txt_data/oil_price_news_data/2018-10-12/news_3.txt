rose
percent

to
million
bpd
or
a
total

with
projections
about

an
oil
trader
told
reuters
that
refinery
run

have
been
on
the
rise
last
month
suggesting
demand
for

was
improving

stable
fuel
demand
we
have
been
scooping
up
crude
oil
pushing
up
premiums
of
some
crude
grades
the
source
said
but
some
local
refiners
have
begun
to
worry
about
where
oil
prices
are
headed
expecting
slimmer
profit
margins
as
a
a
development
would
add
to
other
problems

reform
that
closed
several

had
at
their
disposal
