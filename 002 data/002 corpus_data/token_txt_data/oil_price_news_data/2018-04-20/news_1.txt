the new alaskan oil rush
conocophillips
is
coming
off
of
an
incredible
exploration
season
reportedly
the
best
they
ve
had
in
over
a
decade
and
they
have
alaskan
oil
to
thank
for
it
the
company
stuck
big
in
the
national
petroleum
this
winter
successfully
finding
oil
at
all
six
of
their
test
wells
three
exploration
and
three
appraisal
which
means
chances
are
good
that
the
pipeline
system
could
soon
be
seeing
a
lot
more
supermajor
has
estimated
that
there
are
at
least
million
barrels
of
recoverable
oil
in
its
willow
discovery
along
alaska
western
north
slope
and
these
appraisal
wells
seem
to
strongly
support
that
projection
more
importantly
this
discovery
could
represent
just
a
fraction
of
the
available
reserves
along
the
north
slope
and
conocophillips
plans
to
keep
exploring
the
area
over
another
busy
exploration
season
next
year
starting
with
a
recent
million
deal
to
buy
all
of
anadarko
petroleum
s
north
slope
the
next
five
years
it
is
projected
that
conocophillips
will
be
adding
barrels
a
day
to
the
pipeline
for
a
total
barrels
a
day
an
percent
increase
this
is
great
news
after
years
of
dwindling
volumes
to
put
today
s
barrels
per
day
in
perspective
when
the
pipeline
peaked
in
it
was
funneling
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
through
alaska
an
economy
that
relies
heavily
on
oil
revenues
but
has
been
seeing
volatile
returns
in
the
past
willow
discovery
is
also
a
glimmer
of
hope
for
alaska
s
north
slope
once
the
powerhouse
of
the
country
many
of
its
fields
have
been
sucked
dry
onetime
major
fields
like
prudhoe
bay
the
kuparuk
river
and
the
alpine
are
now
nearly
tapped
now
companies
like
conocophillips
are
breathing
new
life
into
the
region
picking
up
speed
since
several
major
oil
fields
were
discovered
there
over
the
past
few
is
saudi
arabia
losing
its
asian
oil
market
share
the
newfound
interest
in
alaskan
oil
is
not
limited
to
conocophillips
however
investors
and
developers
from
as
places
as
papua
new
guinea
png
have
moved
in
to
get
a
piece
of
the
action
last
month
a
company
called
oil
search
took
over
operations
with
a
million
stake
in
the
nanushuk
field
the
field
is
part
of
the
massive
pikka
unit
reportedly
the
state
s
third
largest
with
an
estimated
volume
of
billion
barrels
of
oil
some
sources
have
even
reported
up
to
billion
barrels
oil
search
bought
a
large
stake
in
the
field
from
armstrong
oil
and
gas
while
repsol
owns
another
significant
s
state
department
of
natural
resources
commissioner
andy
mack
told
the
associated
press
saying
that
pikka
alone
could
reverse
the
extended
decline
in
the
pipeline
oil
search
is
equally
bullish
about
the
prospects
saying
that
the
first
planned
development
could
account
for
an
investment
in
the
range
of
billion
to
billion
with
a
goal
to
have
their
oil
flowing
through
the
pipeline
by
a
natural
gas
giant
like
no
othernow
the
trump
administration
is
pushing
ahead
with
legislation
that
will
allow
drilling
in
the
vast
arctic
national
wildlife
refuge
with
a
review
to
sell
oil
and
gas
leases
in
the
pristine
acre
region
a
divisive
issue
to
say
the
least
the
fate
of
the
region
has
been
bounced
back
and
forth
between
political
platforms
since
the
clinton
administration
and
critics
point
out
the
delicacy
of
the
region
and
the
threat
drilling
would
pose
to
its
population
of
migratory
birds
and
the
caribou
on
which
the
indigenous
gwich
in
people
alaskan
government
however
is
likely
extremely
please
after
fighting
to
open
the
refuge
for
years
for
their
state
which
heavily
depends
on
the
wellbeing
of
the
oil
industry
in
fact
the
good
news
just
keeps
piling
up
for
alaskan
oil
after
years
of
oil
debts
and
economic
decline
while
not
everyone
is
thrilled
about
the
prospect
of
big
oil
s
comeback
in
alaska
few
can
deny
that
the
winds
of
change
are
about
to
blow
