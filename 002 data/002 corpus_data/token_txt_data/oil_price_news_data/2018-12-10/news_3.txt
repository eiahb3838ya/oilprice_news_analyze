saudi arabia to cut oil exports by 1 million bpd next month
saudi
arabia
could
reduce
its
daily
crude
oil
shipments
abroad
by
as
much
as
million
barrels
next
month
reuters
reports
quoting
unnamed
sources
close
to
riyadh
according
to
them
the
move
would
be
motivated
by
weaker
demand
due
to
seasonal
patterns
in
consumption
and
saudi
arabia
s
commitment
to
the
new
production
cut
agreed
last
week
in
total
the
sources
said
riyadh
will
likely
export
an
average
million
bpd
in
january
this
compares
with
less
than
million
bpd
this
month
also
a
decline
from
november
when
the
kingdom
exported
million
arabia
will
once
again
shoulder
the
greatest
burden
of
the
cuts
cutting
bpd
from
its
december
production
levels
which
stand
at
an
average
million
bpd
the
same
as
in
october
the
cartel
and
its
partners
agreed
to
cut
production
from
october
levels
by
percent
for
every
opec
member
besides
libya
iran
and
arabia
pumped
a
of
over
million
bpd
in
november
after
in
june
the
kingdom
agreed
with
russia
and
other
opec
members
to
start
increasing
production
again

their
highest
in
months
in
september
according
to
data
by
the
joint
organisations
data
initiative
jodi
database
which
collects
oil
figures
from
countries
the
kingdom
s
production
in
early
november
probably
hit
the
highest
on
record
on
the
back
of
high
customer
requests
made
in
early
october
when
the
market
feared
a
hefty
loss
of
iranian
supply
last
september
october
and
november
however
riyadh
gradually
cut
shipments
to
the
united
states
in
a
bid
to
prop
up
prices
this
month
the
cuts
will
continue
globally
due
to
weak
seasonal
demand
