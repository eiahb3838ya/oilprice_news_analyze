analysts: output cuts to balance oil markets in 2019
with
a
few
days
to
digest
the
specifics
of
the
deal
most
analysts
deem
the
result
a
success
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there
are
no
pitfalls
left
for
the
oil
its
face
the
numbers
are
impressive
the
group
will
cut
a
combined
million
barrels
per
day
beginning
in
january
this
agreement
provided
relief
to
oil
markets
with
brent
prices
up
initially
and
the
accompanying
decline
in
fundamental
uncertainty
should
further
help
reduce
price
and
implied
volatility
levels
from
their
recent
highs

after

was

cut
by

will
reduce
by
crucially
because
the
baseline
for
the
cuts
is
october
and
not
november
the
cuts
will
be
significant
by
our
calculations
this
means
that
opec
s
january
output
will
be
about
less
than
november
a
significantly
larger
fall
from
current
output

in
a
note
we
have
previously
suggested
that
any
reduction
that

below

saudi
arabia
will
cut

down

analysts
agreed
the
announced
reduction
should
lead
to
a
relatively

note
the
investment
bank
said
that
the
brent
futures
market
should
flip
back
into
a
state
of
backwardation
in
which
oil
futures
trade
at
a
premium
to
futures
that
implies
a
bit
of
bullishness
in
the
market
related
geopolitical
stakes
are
huge

tiny

are
also
the
mandatory
cuts
from
canada
to
consider
roughly
bpd
will
go
offline
in
january
for
a
period
of
time
until
surplus
inventories
are
drained
combined
with
the
production
cuts
in
canada
approx
million
fewer
barrels
per
day
will
thus
be
available
to
the
oil
market
in

be
more

less

that
s
not
all
although
several
troubled
countries
received
exemptions
including
libya
iran
and
nigeria
the
odds
of
further
losses
from
them
are
relatively
high
goldman
sachs
forecasts
of
declines
from
those
we
have
of
reductions
from
of
declining
production
from
the
exempted
countries
and
of
cuts
from
canada
there
are
still
a
lot
of
uncertainties
in
terms
of
compliance
and
unexpected
events
but
on
its
face
those
reductions
together
total
somewhere
close
to
course
things
aren
t
that
simple
and
saudi
arabia
in
particular
will
likely
adjust
output
levels
in
response
to
market
conditions
if
the
losses
from
iran
libya
or
nigeria
are
larger
than
expected
for
instance
riyadh
could
put
supply
back
onto
the
market
as
such
supply
probably
won

what
s
next
for

moreover
the
lack
of
production
quotas
leaves
another
aspect
of
uncertainty
hard
data
on
reductions
may
be
necessary
before
oil
prices
can
really
climb
higher
w
e
reiterate
our
view
that
this
additional
price
upside
will
need
to
be
driven
in
coming
months
by
evidence
of
the
implementation
of
the

goldman
sachs
wrote
the
need
for
this
physical
evidence
emanates
from
both
the
surprisingly
large
surplus
of
the
global
oil
market
in

the
absence
of
a
clear
picture
on
the
implementation

nevertheless
the
supply
picture
is
set

tighten

as
we
head
into
many
oil
watchers
see
a
somewhat
balanced
market
in
the
first
half
of
the

supplies
could
even
tighten
further
if
the

takes
a
hard
line
on

with
sanctions

to
expire
