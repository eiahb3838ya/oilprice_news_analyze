$70 oil cripples european refiners
in
the
latest
indication
of
the
strength
of
the
recovery
of
global
oil
prices
european
refineries
are
struggling
to
pay
their
crude
bills
as
margins
decline
and
demand
weakens
for
some
of
their
products

fallen
the
most
dramatically
high
inflows
of
diesel
in
the
middle
east
are
making
that
fuel
difficult
to
bank
on

a

of

a

firm
in

sector
says
though
part
of
these
fluctuations
are
owed
to
normal
seasonal
oil
demand
usually
slackens
in
the
first
quarter
and
into
the
second
quarter
so
sooner
or
later
refinery
intakes
will
have
to
slacken
and
the
usual
signal
for
that
is
lower
margins

hydroskimming
facilities

refine

it
tough

gasoline
production
like

oil

are
paltry
which
is
impacting
hydroskimming
margins
with

there

a

then
reversed

must
continue

not

novak

all

european
