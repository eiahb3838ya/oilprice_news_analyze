how supermajors are transforming the permian
the
permian
basin
was
once
a
hotbed
of
small
independent
prospectors
wildcatters
and
small
companies
hoping
to
strike
it
rich
now
it
is
brimming
with
supermajors
clamoring
to
buy
out
the
region
s
smaller
operators
and
pump
out
the
basin
s
vast
reserves
of
crude
with
the
kind
of
breakneck
efficiency
that
only
massive
corporate
backing
can
achieve
ten
years
ago
in
united
states
oil
production
bottomed
out
at
about
million
barrels

today
million

are
produced
in

a
bit
of

which
recently
beat
out
the

their

while
european
supermajors

also
working
diligently
on
