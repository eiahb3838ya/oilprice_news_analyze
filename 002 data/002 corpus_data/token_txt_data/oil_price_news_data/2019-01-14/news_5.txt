s
if
we
look
beyond
the

data
and
speculators
behavior
i
remain
convinced
that
we
re
on
the
right
track
and
that
the

market
will
quickly
return

first
voiced
by
the
oil
minister

suhail
who
said
opec
might
need
to
meet
again
to
discuss
tweaks
to
the
cuts
before
april
if
million
bpd
was
not
enough
to
prop
up
what
if
the
million
barrels
of
cuts
are
not
enough
i
am
telling
you
that
if
it
is
not
we
will
meet
and
see
what
is
enough
and
we
will
do
it
mazrouei
said
in
late
december
the
plan
to
cut
oil
production
is
well
studied
but
if
it
does
not
work
we
always
have
the
power
in
opec
to
call
for
an
extraordinary
meeting
if
we
are
required
to
extend
for
another
six
months
we
will
do
it
i
can
assure
you
an
extension
will
not
be
