chinaâ€™s slowing economic growth could wreak havoc on oil markets
despite
renewed
hopes
that
a
fresh
trade
deal
could
be
reached
between
the

it
may
still
not
be

to
offset
the
negative
impact

economic
growth
already
being

sources
told
reuters
last

that
beijing
is
planning
to
lower
its
economic

target

the
analysis
comes
as
china
saw
its
exports
fall
unexpectedly
in
december
by
percent
the
most
in
two
years
with
imports
also
falling
percent
in
their
biggest
decline
since

since
exports
fell
in
december
in
spite
of
government
efforts
to
boost
growth
including
higher
infrastructure
spending
and
tax
cuts
exports
could
also
falter
for
several

recent
export

forecast
that

worse
may

just
around

corner
could
still
weigh

despite

recently
recouping
much
of
the
ground
it
lost
from
to

at
some
analysts
citing
the
recent
data
coming
out

are
forecasting
that
the
upside
for
oil
prices
will
be
in
the

range
for
brent
and
around

however
it
s
expected

stall

the
bigger
factor
for

hinges

talks
between

some
sort

reached
to
not

eliminate

raising

of
chinese
good
from
percent
to
percent
as
well
as
placing
another

worth

goods
under

global
economic
growth
will
tick
upward
including
in
emerging
markets
with
a
effect
on
increasing
oil
demand
which
will
support
higher
oil
prices
however
in
a
scenario
where
a
trade
deal
can
t
be
reached
or
the
outcome
for
global
economic
growth
and
oil
demand
will
be
a
bearish
oil
market
that
