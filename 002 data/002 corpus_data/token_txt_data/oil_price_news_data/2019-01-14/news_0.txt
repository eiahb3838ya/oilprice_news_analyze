fears of u.s. shale demise may be overblown
recently
there
has
been
some
concern
about
the
ability
of
shale
and
in
particular
the
permian
basin
to
continue
the
meteoric
increases
in
production
that
have
characterized
the
past
decade
in
shale
production
since
has
led
to
a
scenario
no
one
ever
imagined
even
a
few
years
ago

was
schlumberger
s
ceo
paal
kibsgard
who
first
commented
on
a
decline
in
productivity
that
was
being
observed
in
completions
often
called
child
wells
in
their
third
quarter
conference
call
with
analysts
he
made
some
remarks
that
were
likely
misunderstood
by
them
but
subsequently
received
wide
reporting
in
media
perception
taken
away
from
these
remarks
was
that
kibsgard
was
saying
that
it
was
the
quality
of
the
reservoirs
that
was
creating
a
in
child
well
productivity
that
could
lead
to
a
decline
in
production
down
the
road
that
wasn
t
what
he
meant
however
and
in
later
remarks
that
were
largely
skipped
over
he
explained
how
technology
is
favorably
impacting
the
results
the
frackers
are
seeing
it
is
applied
first
here
is
the
quote
from
that
sent
everyone
into
a
at
present
our
industry
has
yet
to
understand
how
reservoir
conditions
and
well
productivity
change
as
we
continue
to
pump
billions
of
gallons
of
water
and
billions
of
pounds
of
sand
into
the
ground
each
year
however
what
is
already
clear
to
us
is
that
unit
well
performance
normalized
for
lateral
length
and
pounds
of
proppant
pumped
is
dropping
in
the
eagle
ford
as
the
percentage
of
child
wells
continues
to
increase
today
the
percentage
of
child
wells
drilled
in
the
eagle
ford
has
already
reached
percent
and
in
the
period
since
this
percentage
broke
the
percent
level
we
have
seen
a
steady
reduction
in
unit
well
related
venezuela
s
crisis
threatens
control
over
oil
prices
in
the
permian
the
percentage
of
child
wells
in
the
midland
wolfcamp
basin
has
just
reached
percent
and
we
are
already
starting
to
see
a
similar
reduction
in
unit
well
productivity
to
that
already
seen
in
the
eagle
ford
suggesting
that
the
permian
growth
potential
could
be
lower
than
earlier
expected
therefore
assuming
that
oil
demand
will
remain
robust
despite
the
trade
war
worries
and
market
concerns
around
economic
weakness
in
the
emerging
markets
we
believe
that
the
level
of
e
p
investment
must
increase
both
internationally
and
in
north
america
first
of
all
to
counter
the
multiyear
drop
in
investments
and
second
to
develop
and
deploy
the
new
technologies
needed
to
overcome
the
emerging
shale
oil
production
challenges
according
to
an
earnings
call
changed
beginning
in
let
s
acknowledge
that
shale
fracking
is
still
a
relatively
new
oil
province
as
shown
in
prior
to
shale
regions
contributed
a
minor
amount
to
total
production
given
that
it
s
only
fair
to
agree
the
initial
period
involved
some
trial
and
error
to
see
what
worked
provide
some
data
for
analysis
and
final
changes
that
were
made
by
the
majority
of
the
fracking
companies
were
extending
the
lateral
section
by
percent
to
where
these
lengths
now
routinely
run
more
sand
per
foot
ppf
of
an
interval
with
current
designs
calling
for
as
much
as
ppf
over
a
foot
interval
that
s
a
huge
volume
of
sand
and
closer
well
spacing
operators
have
an
obvious
incentive
to
avoid
well
construction
costs
spacing
the
wells
closer
to
each
other
can
accomplish
this
kibsgard
was
actually
addressing
though
was
that
while
all
of
these
might
be
beneficial
initially
there
were
problems
arising
that
the
application
of
technology
could
address
his
remarks
in
response
to
an
analyst
question
no
i
think
it
can
absolutely
be
solved
through
technology
a
lot
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
conformity
of
the
frac
to
make
sure
that
we
frac
every
cluster
that
we
perforate
and
we
have
diverse
technologies
that
we
have
been
promoting
to
the
market
for
several
years
with
some
but
i
think
this
is
likely
to
accelerate
and
it
s
also
about
how
you
ensure
that
your
frac
stays
within
the
allocated
rough
volume
that
you
have
for
the
well
which
is
more
of
a
conformance
that
you
are
looking
for
and
we
have
technologies
in
terms
of
how
we
design
the
frac
fluid
to
address
that
too
so
all
of
these
things
i
believe
are
addressable
but
it
requires
a
bit
more
of
a
reservoir
focus
on
how
the
wells
are
drilled
how
the
wells
are
fracked
and
we
need
a
little
bit
more
data
to
make
sure
that
we
do
the
right
things
here
but
the
measurements
are
available
the
analysis
and
interpretation
of
the
measurements
are
available
and
the
remedies
that
we
need
to
do
to
the
frac
fluids
are
also
available
it
s
just
a
matter
of
adopting
these
technologies
we
have
them
all
ready
to
the
message
kibsgard
really
meant
to
convey
was
that
while
changes
implemented
by
operators
in
the
previous
year
were
good
after
all
they
were
making
more
oil
over
time
there
might
be
a
price
to
pay
in
lost
production
he
was
saying
there
was
available
technology
that
wasn
t
being
fully
deployed
to
ensure
optimal
reservoir
eurs
estimated
ultimate
recovery
technology
that
could
give
the
operators
a
better
understanding
of
the
reservoir
they
were
of
the
direct
outcomes
of
the
oil
price
collapse
of
the
last
few
years
is
the
ironclad
determination
of
operating
companies
to
tightly
rein
in
costs
as
has
been
discussed
this
was
vital
to
the
resurgence
in
drilling
and
completions
we
saw
commence
in
but
a
consequence
of
this
is
the
difficulty
in
convincing
them
that
technology
is
worth
paying
that
of
course
is
the
rub
technology
has
to
be
paid
for
initially
for
it
to
deliver
on
its
promise
of
improved
results

it
seems

operators
