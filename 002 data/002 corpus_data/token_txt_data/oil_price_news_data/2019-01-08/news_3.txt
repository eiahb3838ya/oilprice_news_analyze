woodmac: demand for oil in transportation sector to peak in a decade
global
transportation
demand
for
crude
oil
is
expected
to
peak
in
the
late
due
to
the
rise
of
electric
vehicles
evs
improved
efficiency
standards
for
internal
combustion
engine
ice
cars
and
consumer
preferences

said
in
a
recent
major
oil
companies
and
analysts
also
believe
that
by
the
late
crude
oil
demand
for
transportation
fuels
will
stop
growing
as
a
result
major
refiners
are
preparing
for
a
petrochemical
future
of
their
crude
oil
refining
processes
to
replace
part
of
their
gasoline
diesel
and
other
distillates
production
after
many
oil
production
and
refining
companies
are
emphasising
chemicals
particularly
olefins
and
aromatics
as
a
key
target

petrochemicals
at

are

while
many
traditional
oil
refineries
will
consider
retrofitting
to
maximize
production
of
chemical
feedstocks
rather
than
transportation

the

iea
petrochemicals
are
expected
to
account
for
more
than
a
third
of
global
oil
demand
growth
to
and
nearly
half
the
growth
to
adding
nearly
million
bpd
by
then
petrochemicals
will
have
a
greater
influence
on
the
future
of
oil

than
cars
trucks

according
to
a
woodmac
analysis
from
a
few
months
ago
the
ev
share
of
the
global
car
fleet
is
still
miniscule
considering
that
the
world
s
stock
of
cars
is
billion
units
but
battery
costs
and
range
are
less
and
less
the
stumbling
blocks
in
ev
adoption
battery
is
one
third
of
the
cost
of
an
ev
today
yet
costs
have
already
declined
by
percent
this
decade
and
will
fall
further
battery
pack
prices
will
drop
below
us
this
year
and
then
fall
by
around
percent
each
year
woodmac
said
in
the
critical
threshold
is
us
that
s
when
evs
will
compete
on
commercial
terms
with
ice
vehicles
we
think
we
ll
get
there
by
woodmac
will
displace
around
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
of
oil
demand
by
percent
of
total
oil
demand
