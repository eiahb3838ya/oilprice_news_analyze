u.s. army joins race to expand u.s. oil exports
the
news
that
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
placed
a
us
order
with
great
lakes
dredge
dock
company
for
the
deepening
and
widening
of
its
ship
channel
at
the
port
of
corpus
christi
portcc
broke
last
week
in
what
was
still
a
sluggish
news
environment
but
it
is
significant
news
this
is
the
first
step
the
federal
government
has
made
to
support
efforts
to
boost
crude
oil
exports
and
it
is
also
the
first
step
in
a
competition
dance
between
the
port
of
corpus
christi
and
commodity
major
analyst
david
blackmon
noted
the
significance
of
the
contract
in
a
recent
story
for
forbes
adding
it
was
part
of
a
bigger
port
expansion
project
that
would
require
us
million
in
funding
the
port
authority
s
determination
to
see
this
project
through
despite
the
bulky
price
tag
was
made
evident
by
its
willingness
to
tap
the
debt
market
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
and
cough
up
us
million
for
the
expansion
the
rest
would
have
to
come
from
the
federal
expand
because
crude
oil
exports
are
on
the
rise
and
will
continue
to
be
on
the
rise
for
some
time
potentially
reaching
to
million
barrels
daily
for
context
this
compares
with
last
year
s
high
of
million
bpd
touched
briefly
in
the
first
half
of
the
exports
rise
it
would
make
sense
to
cut
loading
costs
by
using
larger
tankers
however
there
is
only
one
port
in
the
united
states
at
the
moment
that
can
load
very
large
crude
carriers
the
monsters
that
can
carry
up
to
million
barrels
of
crude
this
is
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
and
it
mostly
handles
imports
hence
the
urgent
need
for
more
export
christi
can
vlccs
part
of
the
load
can
be
pumped
into
them
at
the
port
but
once
it
reaches
a
certain
level
the
vlcc
needs
to
move
into
the
deeper
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
have
the
rest
of
the
cargo
loaded
by
barges
the
army
corps
channel
dredging
will
make
it
possible
for
vlcc
to
use
it
and
load
crude
at
a
terminal
yet
to
be
built
by
portcc

wants
this
expansion
to
happen
as
quickly
as
possible
last

trafigura
threw
its
hat
in
the
ring
with
a
proposal
to
build
an
oil
export
terminal
off
padre
island
to
the
south
of
corpus
christi
threatening
the
future
profitability
of
portcc
s
own
expansion
plans
there
are
also
others
planning
export
terminals
in
texas
and
it
s
the
new
wild
wild
west
for
crude
midstream
is
that
everybody
wants
to
throw
their
hat
in
and
have
their
own
project
the
houston
chronicle
quoted
a
wood
mackenzie
analyst
as
saying
last
september
indeed
the
rush
is
on
as
production
continues
up
although
a
certain
slowdown
in
growth
is
possible
this
year
as
a
result
of
the
latest
oil
price
slide
this
production
growth
will
soon
get
a
boost
from
new
pipelines
coming
on
stream
supporting
not
just
prices
but
greatly
improving
the
time
and
costs
of
getting
the
crude
to
export
is
being
backed
by
carlyle
group
in
its
expansion
plans
with
the
terminal
slated
to
begin
operation
in
yet
it
will
be
hard
work
the
regulatory
process
around
building
an
terminal
is
very
complex
and
on
top
of
that
the
contestants
in
the
oil
export
capacity
race
would
need
to
deal
with
problems
such
as
workforce
shortages
