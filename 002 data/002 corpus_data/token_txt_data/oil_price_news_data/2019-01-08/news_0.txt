is this the answer to canada’s oil crisis?
while
even
the
most
likely
new
pipeline
to
ship
more
of
alberta
s
crude
oil
to
refining
and
export
s

nearly
a
year
away
at
the
earliest
the
province
hosting
most
of
canada
s
oil
production
has
been
desperately
seeking
other
ways
to
get
more
value
for
its
natural
is
looking
to
boost
the
capacity
to
transport
an
additional
bpd
of
its
oil
over
the
next
three
years
in
the
most
drastic
measure
yet
the
province
mandated
an
oil
production
cut
of
bpd
for
three
months
starting
january
to
clear
the
current
glut
and
lift
canadian
heavy
oil
is
also
looking
to
another
solution
to
alleviate
the
crude
oil
a
new
oil
refinery
built
in
the
province
that
would
absorb
part
of
the
crude
and
unlock
some
space
on
congested
pipelines
shipping
oil
out
of
the
however
are
not
convinced
that
a
new
refinery
would
help
much
to
clear
the
oil
glut
first
alberta
s
current
refineries
already
produce
more
than
enough
gasoline
and
diesel
to
meet
local
demand
second
any
excess
of
fuel
has
to
be
moved
out
of
the
province
too
shipping
those
products
to
markets
faces
similar
issues
like
the
current
crude
oil
takeaway
capacity
bottlenecks
third
those
refined
products
would
have
to
compete
for
a
share
on
a
flat
or
declining
north
american
fuel
market
where
refineries
already
produce
more
gasoline
and
other
refined
products
than
america
consumes

exportsshortly
after
announcing
the

cut
alberta
s
premier
rachel
notley
said
that
the
government
was
issuing
a
request
for
expression
of
interest
to
determine
business
cases
for
investing
in
a
new
refinery
in
alberta
or
tied

the

will
accept
expressions

interest
until
february
and
will
consider
interest
in
new
greenfield
investments
or
an
expansion

at
an

s
government
didn

specify
how
it
would
support
the
project
yet
even
if
it
were
to
follow
up
the
stage
with
issuing
a
request
for
proposals
to
construct
a
new
refinery
the
potential
new
project
would
take
years
to
complete
and
start
up
building
a
new
refinery
would
create
jobs
for
albertans
new
refining
capacity
would
also
help
lower
the
oil
price
differential
over
the
long
term
protecting
the
province
from
a
lack
of
capacity
to
export
oil
and
making
sure
we
get
full
value
for
the
energy
resources
owned
by
all
albertans
the
statement
seeking
industry
interest
has
four
operating
refineries
and
a
new
one
starting
up
any
time
now
the
suncor
refinery
in
edmonton
the
imperial

refinery
in
edmonton
the
shell
canada
refinery
in
scotford
and
the

refinery
in
lloydminster
have
a
total
capacity
of
bpd
while
the
sturgeon
refinery
of
the
north
west
redwater
partnership
nwr
has
started
up
some
units
and
is
set
to
start
commercial
production
this
year
the
refinery
will
have
a
capacity
to
process
bpd
increasing
total
alberta
refinery
capacity
to
bpd
related
is
iran
exaggerating
the
demand
for
its
oil
those
refineries
already
produce
more
fuels
than
alberta
consumes
and
any
new
refinery
would
have
to
fight
for
market
access
and
markets
amid
more
challenging
refining
economics
according
to
you
still
have
to
ship
that
product
to

potential
new

in
five

time
would
not
help
the
province
s
current
takeaway
capacity
constraints
with

by
the
time
you

on
you
are

four

five

down

if
you

t

then
you
ve
got
a

birn
told
bloomberg
while
more
refining
capacity
in
alberta
could
alleviate
the
crude
oil
it
still
exists
in
four
or
five
could
create
more
fuel
oversupply
that
would
need
access
to
markets
anyway
what
s
certain
is
that
a
new

tomorrow
won

excess
