is iran exaggerating the demand for its oil?
after
the
united
states
pulled
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
and
added
to
sanctions
last
year
the
trump
administration
granted
waivers
to
eight
countries
who
were
already
established
buyers
to
continue
buying
specified
amounts
of
iranian
oil
for
days
now
however
a
senior
iranian
energy
official
in
tehran
says
that
these
countries
are
not
making
use
of
the
waivers
and
are
instead
complying
fully
with
the
strict
to
iran
deputy
oil
minister
for
trade
and
international
affairs
amir
hossein
zamaninia
china
india
japan
south
korea
and
other
countries
that
were
granted
waivers
from
america
to
import
iranian
oil
are
not
willing
to
buy
even
one
barrel
more
from
iran
the
other
countries
granted
waivers
by
the
united
states
are
italy
greece
taiwan
and
the
surface
this
sounds
like
devastating
news
for
iran
which
is
already
struggling
with
a
lagging
economy
increasingly
tense
regional
relations
unrest
within
the
ranks
of
the
current
regime
and
widespread
protests
the
rouhani
administration
in
iran
made
the
nuclear
deal
also
known
as
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
jcpoa
a
major
part
of
their
platform
and
as
therefore
lost
a
considerable
amount
of
support
from
its
own
constituents
in
the
wake
of
the
deal
s
dissolution
in
spite
of
this
zamaninia
is
optimistic
quoted
by
the
oil
ministry
news
agency
shana
as
saying
that
tehran
has
no
shortage
of
prospective
buyers
for
their
oil
in
fact
zamaninia
says
that
number
of
interested
countries
has
significantly
increased
thanks
to
a
competitive
does
have
some
notable
allies
in
the
face
of
the
renewed
sanctions
the
rouhani
administration
has
been
working
on
strengthening
these
relations
with
economic
powerhouses
such
as
russia
and
india
while
iran
s
relationship
with
russia
has
been
somewhat
tenuous
they
have
been
allies
in
syria
in
support
of
the
assad
regime
and
more
importantly
russia
is
a
willing
candidate
for
undermining
sanctions
iran
also
has
a
strong
relationship
with
india
which
has
found
a
way
to
keep
trading
in
iranian
crude
oil
by
way
of
banking
loopholes
involving
five
escrow
accounts
in
iranian
banks
related
what
apple
s
tailspin
means
for
oil
pricesin
addition
to
these
somewhat
tentative
alliances
the
european
union
strongly
opposed
the
trump
administration
s
decision
to
withdraw
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
despite
tense
relations
with
tehran
has
been
consistently
resistant
to
comply
with
sanctions
tehran
is
now
urging
those
european
countries
still
committed
to
holding
up
their
end
of
the
nuclear
deal
to
further
oppose
the
sanctions
by
setting
up
a
financial
system
known
as
spv
special
purpose
vehicle
for
trade
that
would
facilitate
payments
for
sale
of
iranian
the
meantime
the
has
stood
strong
with
the
revamped
sanctions
with
a
stated
purpose
of
curbing
iran
s
missile
and
nuclear
programs
and
to
push
back
against
the
nation
s
increasing
military
presence
and
political
influence
throughout
the
middle
east
in
the
face
of
the
s
unflinching
position
tehran
admits
that
even
the
support
of
the
european
union
may
not
be
enough
to
sidestep
the
sanctions
zamaninia
says
that
even
if
the
spv
financial
mechanism
is
instated
it
would
be
helpful
but
could
not
resolve
the
problems
since
influence
will
affect
any
european
action
the
oil
sanction
waivers
whether
the
receiving
countries
are
making
use
of
them
are
not
don
t
expire
until
march
when
president
trump
will
announce
whether
or
not
the
original
waiver
will
be
extended
if
no
more
waivers
are
granted
and
the
other
countries
purportedly
interested
in
iranian
oil
don
t
start
buying
in
considerable
quantities
iran
s
next
best
hope
is
for
a
more
friendly
regime
change
in
the
united
states
in
the
end
waivers
and
elections
in
the
united
states
may
be
too
little
too
late
for
iran
as
the
nation
s
economy
has
already
taken
a
huge
hit
that
has
caused
the
nation
s
disillusioned
citizens
to
lash
out
against
the
current
regime
and
even
take
to
the
streets
chanting
our
enemy
is
right
here
it
is
