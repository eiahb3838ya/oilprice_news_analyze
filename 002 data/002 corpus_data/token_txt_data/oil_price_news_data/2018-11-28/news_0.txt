oil falls on crude inventory build
crude
oil
prices
slipped
further
down
today
after
the
energy
information
administration
reported
crude
oil
inventories
for
the
week
to
november
had
added
million
barrels
that
s
compared
with
a
build
of
million
barrels
a
week
eia
figures
came
after
yesterday
the
american
petroleum
institute
reported
an
estimated
inventory
increase
of
million
barrels
which
failed
to
affect
prices
in
any
significant
also
said
gasoline
inventories
last
week
had
declined
by
barrels
and
distillate
fuel
inventories
had
added
million
barrels
a
week
earlier
the
authority
estimated
a
decline
of
million
barrels
in
gasoline
and
a
decline
in
distillate
fuel
production
is
hitting
new
highs
and
this
will
continue
according
to
most
estimates
unless
oil
prices
continue
declining
at
a
fast
pace
the
likelihood
of
this
happening
is
relatively
low
however
opec
is
meeting
next
week
in
vienna
to
discuss
a
new
round
of
production
cuts
and
most
analysts
expect
the
cuts
to
be
agreed
with
russia
also
joining
in
morgan
stanley
for
one
sees
a
chance
of
the
cartel
failing
or
refusing
to
agree
a
production
cut
in
which
case
prices
will
definitely
slump
more
pressured
by
bleak
economic
outlooks
and
concerns
about
a
crude
oil
oversupply
the
argument
against
a
production
cut
is
simple
enough
market
share
it
s
no
wonder
some
opec
members
have
already
spoken
against
a
cut
notably
libya
which
said
it
expected
to
be
granted
an
exemption
from
any
the
opec
meeting
oil
market
observers
would
be
watching
the
meeting
where
russia
may
or
may
not
give
a
clear
indication
whether
it
will
join
any
cut
agreements
just
like
last
time
moscow
would
be
a
crucial
ally
for
the
cartel
if
it
decides
to
join
the
cuts
or
a
if
it
decides
to
sit
