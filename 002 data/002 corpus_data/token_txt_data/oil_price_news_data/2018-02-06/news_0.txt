the shale boom might not last long
shale
is
growing
at
a
scorching
rate
but
will
the
shale
industry
be
around
for
the
long
haul
a
new
study
calls
into
question
the
heady
projections
for
shale
oil
and
gas
arguing
that
expectations
of
huge
levels
of
production
for
decades
to
come
are
based
on
shaky
post
carbon
institute
s
report
argues
that
the
eia
is
overstating
the
potential
of
shale
calling
the
projections
highly
to
extremely
optimistic
and
are
therefore
very
unlikely
to
be
the
report
argues
that
while
oil
production
has
doubled
from
levels
and
shale
gas
has
also
exploded
over
the
same
timeframe
there
are
underlying
problems
that
will
always
bedevil
shale
production
for
instance
shale
wells
typically
see
production
deplete
by
to
percent
in
the
first
three
years
while
fields
see
output
drop
off
by
about
to
percent
per
year
without
new
means
that
the
industry
has
to
constantly
plough
more
money
back
into
production
just
to
keep
output
the
same
time
not
every
shale
well
is
the
same
the
core
areas
or
sweet
spots
typically
make
up
just
percent
of
a
given
shale
play
when
shale
drillers
move
beyond
the
core
they
tend
to
post
less
impressive
production
shocking
ramp
up
in
production
over
the
past
decade
has
mostly
occurred
in
these
sweet
spots
a
trend
that
was
accentuated
during
the
market
downturn
beginning
in
vast
improvements
in
drilling
technology
and
techniques
have
more
than
compensated
for
the
depletion
shale
drillers
can
access
a
greater
portion
of
a
reservoir
than
just
a
few
years
ago
while
shale
wells
have
always
suffered
from
steep
declines
in
their
production
profiles
overall
output
has
trended
up
over
the
past
few
years
aside
from
the
drop
off
after
the
market
meltdown
in
related
the
shale
driller
dilemmamore
growth
is
ahead
the
eia
sees
the
topping
million
barrels
per
day
by
the
end
of
which
means
the
addition
of
another
from
today
s
levels
it
is
hard
to
overstate
the
significance
of
this
and
the
output
gains
could
yet
lead
to
another
price
the
is
another
question
the
post
carbon
institute
says
that
the
eia
s
assumption
of
strong
growth
for
the
next
several
decades
assumes
that
the
industry
will
produce
all
proven
oil
and
gas
reserves
plus
a
high
percentage
of
unproven
resources
in
some
cases
over
by
shale
oil
production
according
to
the
eia
s
annual
energy
outlook
won
t
peak
until
the
report
says
that
scenario
is
extremely
optimistic
and
as
such
probably
won
t
happen
the
report
breaks
down
the
major
shale
plays
to
explain
why
the
bakken
for
instance
is
already
showing
some
signs
of
wear
well
productivity
improvements
have
or
decreased
in
all
but
two
counties
indicating
available
well
locations
are
running
out
the
post
carbon
institute
report
eagle
ford
is
also
strained
the
report
says
that
the
eia
is
overstating
its
potential
with
high
well
density
and
high
depletion
rates
likely
to
limit
the
region
s
ability
to
keep
production

overestimated

compared
to
the

the
report
the
permian
is

the
report
says
that
the
eia
s
assumptions
for
the
wolfcamp
for
instance
rest
on
vast
additional
resources
to
be
recovered
related
higher
oil
prices
are
bad
news
for
indiain
other
words
drilling
techniques
continue
to
improve
but
it
may
simply
become
too
costly
to
produce
as
much
oil
as
the
eia
assumes
will
be
produced
when
the
industry
says
that
it
can
produce
a
lot
more
oil
from
an
average
shale
well
higher
well
productivity
that
may
be
true
but
it
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
that
the
total
volume
of
oil
and
gas
that
is
ultimately
recovered
is
larger
shale
firms
might
just
end
up
extracting
the
same
volume
of
resources
from
fewer
implications
if
true
are
profound
the
very
high
to
extremely
optimistic
eia
projections
impart
an
unjustified
level
of
comfort
for
energy
sustainability
the
post
carbon
institute
wrote
as
sweet
spots
are
exhausted
the
reality
is
likely
to
be
much
higher
costs
and
higher
drilling
rates
to
maintain
production
stem
ultimately
the
report
argues
rosy
forecasts
undercut
the
urgency
for
investment
in
renewable
energy
evs
and
efficiency
since
policymakers
hold
an
overly
confident
view
of
the
country
s
energy
predicament
the
trump
administration
has
discarded
calls
for
energy
independence
in
favor
of

this
kind
of
triumphalism
is
wrongheaded
and
misinformed
