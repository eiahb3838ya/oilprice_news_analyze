there’s no sugarcoating canada’s oil crisis
has
financial
disaster
been
averted
in
canada
s
oil
and
gas
industry
disaster
is
all
relative
let
s
just
say
is
going
to
be
a
difficult
year
following
a
tough
set
of
recent
thing
we
know
is
that
the
recent
episode
of
commodity
by
a
regional
glut
of
oil
and
gas
looking
for
a
pipeline
to
call
home
combined
with
low
international
oil
wounded
this
year
s
outlook
for
conventional
oilfield
activity
that
s
the
segment
of
the
business
outside
the
oil
sands
where
of
the
industry
s
spending
typically
the
tight
orbit
of
fort
mcmurray
s
oil
sands
in
the
broader
oil
and
gas
fields
of
bc
alberta
and
saskatchewan
the
overt
indicator
of
sectoral
health
is
drilling
activity
like
counting
cars
on
a
freeway
you
know
the
economy
is
bad
if
there
are
only
a
few
commuters
on
the
s
looking
pretty
bad
for
the
first
quarter
we
re
entering
the
peak
rush
hour
of
the
winter
drilling
season
with
only
bits
turning
on
active
rigs
the
level
of
activity
is
feeling
a
lot
like
the
depths
of
the
lowest
new
year
s
entry
in
decades
see
figure
comparison
last
year
at
this
time
the
rig
count
was
climbing
toward
a
more
stable
february
peak
of
but
stability
is
hardly
in
the
energy
dictionary
right
now
volatile
discounts
weak
international
prices
illiquid
equity
markets
and
a
pipeline
drama
has
spooked
those
with
money
and
hollowed
those
without
it
s
pretty
simple
really
no
confidence
plus
no
money
equals
no
drilling
that
s
what
was
happening
late
last
year

glut
not
likely
in
said
that
the
very
real
potential
for
fiscal
disaster
was
averted
to
clear
the
late
production
glut
the
government
of
alberta
stepped
into
the
market
with
a
mandatory
oil
curtailment
percent
across
the
board
the
goal
was
to
restrain
output
until
the
market
cleared
so
far
the
policy
seems
to
be
working
domestic
price
discounts
have
snapped
back
to
after
accounting
for
usual
quality
and
transportation
differences
if
plays
out
according
to
plan
the
curtailment
should
be
lifted
by
and
various
increased
rail
movement
pipeline
enhancements
to
boost
unused
capacity
and
other
supply
chain
keep
the
discounts
in
the
first
quarter
has
a
sinking
feeling
the
outlook
heading
into
summer
may
be
better
spending
and
drilling
should
strengthen
into
the
back
half
of
the
year
though
there
is
little
doubt
that
as
a
whole
will
record
fewer
new
oil
and
gas
wells
compared
to
the
in
each
of
the
past
two
current
malaise
is
not
only
about
canadian
issues
including
pipeline
delays
price
discounts
and
policy
angst
a
major
factor
is
oil
price
at
benchmark
cushing

has

many
producers
and
a
fiscal
pinch
if
lasts

more
than
a
couple
of
months
worldwide
drilling
activity
will
pull
back
there
is
a
new
resiliency
in
the
world
of
oil
the
competitive
pressures
of
the
last
four
years
has
forced
adaptation
to
significantly
lower
prices
as
well
as
the
additional
costs
of
environmental
pressures
globally
leading
multinationals
and
progressive
independent
operators

now
be
quite
active

many

here
in

on
the
flip

producers
that
are
blind

innovation
and
still
pining

prices
and
hard
times
are
frustrating
disagreeable
and
outright
demoralizing
in
any
business
think
retail
during
such
times
progressive
companies
sharpen
their
pencils
and
necessarily
figure
out
how
to
adapt
this
has
been
happening
in
the
global
oil
and
gas
industry
and
it
s
been
forced
acutely
on

where

have
stubbornly
bobbed
