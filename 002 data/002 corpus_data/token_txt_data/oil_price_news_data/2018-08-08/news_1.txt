is this europe’s newest oil & gas producer?
few
countries
have
a
hydrocarbon
history
as
difficult
and
convoluted
as
portugal
it
has
lost
its
colonies
just
as
angola
s
oil
production
was
on
the
brink
of
multiplying
later
even
mozambique
turned
out
to
be
a
superb
region
with
giant
fields
like
rovuma
currently
portugal
has
no
oil
production
whatsoever
perhaps
a
noteworthy
reminder
that
the
progenitor
of
the
leading
portuguese
oil
company
galp
energia
was
established
specifically
for
the
purposes
of
exploration
and
production
in
africa
not
in
europe
recently
a
new
spark
of
activity
has
generated
substantial
buzz
in
portugal
entertaining
a
hope
that
there
might
in
fact
be
oil
in
portugal
yet
the
prospects
of
it
being
produced
commercially
still
look
media
hype
reached
its
apex
in
when
a
british
company
named
ioniq
resources
has
stated
it
had
located
six
deposits
in
portugal
with
reserves
totaling
at
least
billion
barrels
government
officials
were
prudent
in
their
managing
of
public
expectations
for
a
good
reason
despite
having
no
production
whatsoever
upstream
activities
in
portuguese
waters
are
a
heated
political
subject
the
portuguese
green
party
as
well
as
the
left
bloc

de
esquerda
upon
the
support
of
which
the
government
depends
are
fiercely
opposing
any
form
of
activity
whilst
the
communists
oppose
foreign
companies
participation
in
exploiting
resources
which
they
deem
to
be
far
antónio
costa
s
government
has
done
a
fairly
good
job
of
keeping
fiscal
stability
and
economic
growth
since
the
economy
keeps
on
expanding
underpinned
by
a
high
gdp
increase
of

potentially
boost
portugal
s
economic
standing
further
however
in
view
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
a
viable
government
the
development
of
new
fields
has
been
stalled
on
may
the

issued
a
temporary
moratorium
on
the
allocation
of
future
oil

concessions
in
the
country
covering
not
only
the
onshore
part
but
also
perhaps
unexpectedly
the
offshore
despite
giving
in
to
political
pressures
the
authorities
found
a
partial
way
out
by
exempting
blocks
that
are
held
by
a
