forget oil price forecasts, itâ€™s just another cycle
profit
season
in
the
oil
industry
is
in
full
swing
and
the
mood
is
upbeat
strict
financial
discipline
is
paying
off
cash
flows
are
improving
or
emerging
after
a
long
absence
and
the
industry
is
growing
again
and
there
are
those
who
claim
that
we
have
seen
the
last
big
oil
price
beg
to
differ
however
a
notable
voice
among
the
skeptics
is
reuters
market
analyst
john
kemp
in
a
recent
column
kemp
lays
out
in
detail
the
reasons
why
the
it
will
never
happen
again
refrain
is
wishful
thinking
at
best
and
delusion
at
worst
the
oil
industry
he
says
has
a
cyclical
nature
learning
from
past
mistakes
while
a
good
thing
generally
can
not
help
avoid
the
next
bust
because
boom
and
bust
is
the
very
nature
of
the
scars
from
the
last
bust
still
fresh
the
oil
industry
is
being
cautious
with
new
investments
just
as
it
has
been
after
every
single
bust
since
the
dawn
of
oil
kemp
notes
oil
companies
are
suspicious
of
the
price
rise
uncertain
it
will
last
and
they
are
quite
right
to
be
suspicious
because
no
boom
ever
lasts
as
history
has
proven
time
and
again
the
problem
is
that
nobody
can
predict
the
end
of
the
next
cycle
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
one
hence
the
if
nobody
can
predict
the
next
price
collapse
what
is
the
point
of
having
analysts
fall
over
themselves
to
forecast
the
unforecastable
namely
future
oil
prices
well
here
s
a
pertinent
quote
from
john
kenneth
galbraith
economists
don
t
forecast
because
they
know
they
forecast
because
they
re
economic
forecasts
are
notoriously
inaccurate
and
this
is
particularly
and
very
emphatically
true
of
oil
price
forecasts
here
s
another
quote
from
rex
tillerson
we
ve
never
been
good
at
predicting
these
price
cycles
neither
when
they
occur
nor
their
duration
we
don
t
spend
a
lot
of
time
even
that
s
certainly
a
smart
approach
and
one
that
must
pay
off
by
saving
time
effort
and
money
related
are
investors
turning
away
from
big
oil
the
reasons
why
predicting
the
next
oil
industry
cycle
is
mission
impossible
come
down
to
the
makeup
of
the
oil
market
and
the
huge
diversity
of
external
factors
that
have
a
bearing
on
prices
and
therefore
on
the
cycles
the
oil
market
kemp
says
is
actually
a
collection
of
numerous
submarkets
and
these
are
never
in
balance
when
they
are
in
balance
it
s
only
for
a
very
short
time
so
the
phrase
balancing
the
market
is
basically
the
market
there
are
thousands
of
events
that
can
affect
oil
prices
and
there
is
no
way
on
earth
anyone
can
account
for
each
and
every
one
of
these
thousands
of
events
ranging
from
local
politics
in
oil
producers
and
consumers
to
force
majeure
events
as
bill
gilmer
director
of
the
institute
for
regional
forecasting
at
the
university
of
houston
puts
it
the
world
does
not
stand
still
so
the
chance
of
any
one
analyst
or
big
oil
ceo
getting
the
price
right
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
chance
for
a
tail
or
a
head
in
a
coin
what
is
an
industry
to
do
in
this
environment
of
chronic
uncertainty
ride
the
cycle
kemp
says
so
producers
vow
to
continue
with
the
strictly
disciplined
approach
to
investments
the
result
will
be
higher
prices
stimulating
alternative
producers
a
supply
build
and
a
subsequent
fall
in
prices
just
like
every
other
cycle
the
only
thing
producers
could
reasonably
do
whether
big
oil
or
opec
is
plan
for
the
long
term
and
learn
to
live
with
