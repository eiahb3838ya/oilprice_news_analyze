bp sees peak oil demand in 2030s
bp
says
oil
demand
will
peak
in
the
and
that
evs
will
rise
to
capture
about
a
third
of
the
car
released
its
annual
energy
outlook
with
forecasts
through
unlike
in
years
past
this
version
sees
more
upheaval
on
the
horizon
as
the
energy
landscape
evolves
rapidly
indeed
the
continuing
rapid
growth
of
renewables
is
leading
to
the
most
diversified
fuel
mix
ever
seen
bp
ceo
bob
dudley
said
in
a
statement
abundant
and
diversified
energy
supplies
will
make
for
a
challenging
marketplace
don
t
be
fooled
by
the
recent
firming
in
oil
prices
the
focus
on
efficiency
reliability
and
capital
discipline
is
here
to
bp
believes
that
just
about
all
of
the
growth
in
energy
demand
will
come
from
developing
economies
with
china
and
india
alone
accounting
for
half
of
the
total
growth
in
global
energy
demand
through
offered
several
different
forecasts
but
all
predict
a
peak
in
oil
demand
in
the
with
varying
degrees
of
decline
thereafter
its
central
forecast
sees
peak
oil
demand
in
the
at
about
million
barrels
per
day
with
consumption
plateauing
and
declining
through
and
beyond
in
other
words
demand
grows
for
another
two
decades
rising
by
before
consumption
tops
sees
the
number
of
evs
on
the
road
surging
to
million
by
capturing
about
a
third
of
the
market
in
terms
of
miles
traveled
that
equates
roughly
to
a
increase
from
the
million
evs
on
the
road
today
it
is
also
sharply
up
from
the
million
evs
bp
expected
to
be
on
the
road
in
in
last
year
s
energy
it
doesn
t
equate
to
the
total
ev
revolution
that
many
hope
to
see
in
fact
bp
still
sees
carbon
emissions
rising
by
percent
through
a
scenario
incompatible
with
what
scientists
say
are
needed
to
hit
climate
targets
and
in
bp
s
most
aggressive
scenario
for
evs
in
which
many
more
governments
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
france
and
the
uk
and
put
in
place
a
ban
on
gasoline
and
diesel
vehicles
by
bp
still
only
sees
evs
eliminating
about
worth
of
demand
which
would
be
about
percent
of
the
current
market
it
s
a
big
number
bp
s
chief
economist
spencer
dale
says
but
even
in
that
scenario
oil
demand
in
is
still
higher
than
it
is
bp
says
carbon
pricing
is
needed
to
drive
down
argues
that
cars
will
be
used
more
in
the
future
traveling
longer
distances
but
that
autonomous
vehicles
electricity
and
efficiency
will
offset
the
increase
in
oil
consumption
from
more
vehicles
on
the
road
the
suggestion
that
rapid
growth
in
electric
cars
will
cause
oil
demand
to
collapse
just
isn
t
supported
by
the
basic
numbers
even
with
really
rapid
growth
dale
said
according
to
the
predicts
the
average
ev
in
the
future
will
be
used
to
travel
about
two
and
a
half
times
more
than
the
current
internal
combustion
vehicle
what
we
expect
to
see
in
the
is
a
huge
growth
in
shared
mobility
autonomous
cars
once
you
don
t
have
to
pay
for
a
driver
the
cost
of
taking
one
of
those
share
mobility
fleets
services
will
fall
by
about
or
percent
dale
told
reporters
the
upshot
is
that
demand
for
crude
oil
used
in
cars
remains
largely
flat
at
in
down
just
a
hair
from
in
interesting
prediction
was
the
expected
impact
of
regulations
on
plastics
bp
sees
taxes
and
regulations
on
things
like
plastic
bags
will
help
eat
into
crude
oil
demand
by
about
still
petrochemicals
grow
in
importance
over
time
taking
a
greater
share
of
the
demand
pie
as
evs
keep
demand
flat

brazil
s
coming
oil
boom
will
weigh
on
oil
pricesthe
opinions
of
other
oil
majors
vary
on
this
hotly
contested
subject
officials
from
royal
dutch
shell
have
said
that
a
peak
could
come
as
soon
as
whereas
exxonmobil
and
chevron
see
demand
rising
steadily
for
the
foreseeable
future
with
no
peak
in
that
sense
there
is
a
bit
of
difference
between
the
european
and
american
oil
majors
shell
bp
and
total
have
begun
stepping
up
their
investments
into
natural
gas
utilities
and
renewable
energy
royal
dutch
shell
recently
bought

a

also
purchased
a

last
month
total
purchased
sunpower
years
ago

is
now
looking
to
building
up
generating
assets

bp
recently
announced
plans
to
jump
back
into
the
solar
sector
after
pulling
out
years
be
sure
these
are
marginal
forays
into
clean
energy
the
majors
are
still
overwhelmingly
invested
in
oil
and
gas
and
will
continue
to
be
for
years
yet
they
mark
a
small
but
significant
pivot
away
from
the
outlook
here
shows
that
the
world
is
going
to
need
all
forms
of
energy
bp
chief
executive
bob
dudley
said
at

conference
tuesday
