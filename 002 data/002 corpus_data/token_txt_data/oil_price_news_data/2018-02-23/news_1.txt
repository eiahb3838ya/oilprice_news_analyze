according

the

it

likely
to

more

this

the

shows

the
eia

are

more

the
pace
of

production
over

will
also
be

by
several
factors
that
could
limit
the

potential
which
the

has
not
accounted
for
in

writes
on

these
are
midstream

the

that

inflation

could

agrees
that

admitted
in

oil
outlook
that
tight

will
grow

until
as

seek
out

aggressively
produce

from

in
the
permian
and
other
opec
sees
tight

peaking
in
the

the

at
the
end
of
question
is
whether
the
rise
in
takeaway
capacity
will
catch
up
with
the
surge
in
shale
growth
will
also
hinge
on
how
fast
labor

shortages

pace
of
shale
growth
will
also
be
determined
by
the
shift
in
investor
sentiment
toward
drillers
that
gained
momentum
in
the
second
half
of
oil
tycoon
harold
hamm
issued
a
warning
that
producers
won
t
succeed
if
they
drill
themselves
into

now
there
is
a
shift
from

to
make
some
profits
for
a

more

on
cash

investors
really
want

earlier
this
is
no

that

there
