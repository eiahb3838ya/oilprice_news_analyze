opec ‘supergroup’ keeps oil exports subdued
i
was
jesting
the
other
day
about
who
would
be
on
guitar
in
opec
supergroup
but
it
got
me
thinking
about
the
various
global
oil
producers
and
how
their
traits
could
be
reflective
of
their
musicianship
this
is
where
it
led
me
if
opec
nopec
were
a
supergroup
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
be
the
band
manager
the
leader
keeping
everyone
else
in
check
the
kingdom
would
also
as
the
tour
bus
driver
given
they
are
the
ones
driving
the
rest
of
the
group
if
saudi
is
the
manager
russia
must
be
the
lead
singer
stepping
into
the
spotlight
and
up
to
the
mic
unlike
roadies
the
minnows
of
opec
nopec
everyone
listens
to
the
singer
as
the
chart
below
illustrates
russia
has
been
remarkably
successful
at
dialing
back
its
exports
particularly
in
the
second
half
of
last
year
with
the
likes
of
rosneft
lukoil
and
gazprom
being
into
compliance
russian
crude
exports
spent
averaging
bpd
below
october
reference

signaling
compliance

with
russia
as
our
vocalist
angola
and
kuwait
would
be
the
rhythm
section
a
measured
and
solid
basis
for
the
band
kuwait
would
be
the
drummer
upbeat
and
on
point
while
angola
would
be
the
bass
player
steady
and
reliable
as
has
been
their
discussed
last
month
how
our
clipperdata
show
that
angola
has
been
in
compliance
by
exporting
million
fewer
barrels
last
year
versus
its
october
reference
the
chart
below
illustrates
the
west
african
nation
has
continued
to
keep
its
leading
destination
china
well
supplied
delivering
percent
of
its
exports
there
servicing
its
obligations
the
was
the
destination
for
angolan
crude
last
year
but
a
long
long
looooong
way
back
in
second
accounting
for
less
than
percent
of
total
deliveries
back
to
our
supergroup
we
still
need
someone
on
the
axe
libya
is
perhaps
the
best
fit
for
lead
guitar
given
the
ability
of
its
choppy
exports
to
rise
and
fall
like
eric
clapton
shredding
a
fretboard
related
what
s
really
happening
with
venezuela
s
el
petro
after
averaging
just
bpd
in
exports
of
el
sharara
and
es
sider
ramped
up
emphatically
in
averaging
a
whopping
el
sharara
field
libya
largest
was
closed
in
november
before
ramping
back
up
again
in
late
flows
of
es
sider
were
briefly
taken
offline
in
late
december
amid
the
waha
pipeline
explosion
but
as
the
chart
below
illustrates
exports
from
the
es
sider
terminal
rebounded
soon
enough
as
the
pipeline
was
quickly
repaired
exports
of
both
es
sider
and
el
sharara
have
started
by
riffing
higher
averaging
over
bpd
in
january
accounting
for
over
a
half
of
total
crude
exports
as
domestic
production
rises
total
libyan
exports
are
now
up
to
their
highest
level
