how sanctions are helping the u.s. become a net oil exporter
it
s
easy
to
forget
now
but
just
a
few
short
years
ago
the
united
states
was
the
biggest
oil
importer
in
the
world
by
a
considerable
margin
and
sold
exactly
zero
barrels
internationally
thanks
to
laws
prohibiting
the
export
of
oil
this
now
sounds
like
an
absurdity
thanks
to
the
shale
oil
and
gas
renaissance
ushered
in
by
that
has
allowed
the
to
become
a
major
oil
exporter
to
europe
and
asia
alike
now
thanks
to
political
turmoil
and
oil
sanctions
in
exporting
powerhouses
iran
and
venezuela
the
is
ready
to
step
into
their
place
and
inch
ever
closer
to
what
was
once
unthinkable
becoming
a
net
oil
a
global
oil
trading
industry
gathering
last
september
oil
producers
from
the
united
states
came
well
prepared
to
usher
in
the
new
era
of
oil
exports
exxon
mobil
for
one
along
with
their
european
competitor
royal
dutch
shell
came
armed
with
brochures
explaining
in
detail
the
different
grades
of
crudes
as
well
as
all
the
reasons
they
are
the
perfect
replacement
for
oil
traditionally
bought
from
middle
east
africa
and
russia
for
import
to
far
the
strategy
has
been
a
smashing
success
oil
exports
to
europe
have
hit
record
highs
over
the
last
year
doubling
over
the
course
of
to
reach
barrels
per
day
bpd
this
year
exports
have
continued
to
soar
breaking
records
already
in
january
with
bpd
sent
to
europe
alone
while
this
is
still
less
than
imports
from
russia
or
iraq
it
puts
the
ahead
of
other
opec
producers
like
nigeria
and
libya
related
where
will
putin
build
his
next
gas
pipeline
a
big
factor
in
the
massive
success
of
crude
in
overseas
markets
is
the
massive
amount
of
output
from
the
permian
basin
creating
a
crude
glut
and
driving
down
crude
prices
to
a
level
that
international
markets
are
to
compete
with
crude
is
a
real
headache
it
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
regional
light
grades
in
fact
prices
for
all
grades
are
affected
because
it
is
such
a
significant
extra
supply
a
european
trader
representing
russian
oil
was
quoted
as
saying
by
major
oil
producers
have
already
been
forced
to
lower
their
own
prices
and
enforce
production
caps
opec
and
other
outside
producers
like
russia
have
cut
their
output
by
percent
since
in
an
attempt
to
combat
falling
oil
prices
the
strategy
has
been
a
successful
one
for
the
most
part
with
prices
doubling
from
their
lowest
point
up
to
per
barrel
but
without
a
doubt
the
international
market
will
continue
to
feel
the
squeeze
over
the
course
of
the
united
states
crude
glut
and
subsequent
low
prices
is
only
going
to
continue
to
grow
over
the
next
year
according
to
government
statistics
in
crude
production
is
projected
to
skyrocket
another
million
bpd
over
last
year
reaching
an
expected
approximate
average
of
million
bpd
looking
further
than
predictions
show
that
crude
could
grow
to
reach
up
to
million
bpd
of
crude
and
up
to
million
bpd
of
total
oil
liquids
with
these
numbers
the
country
would
be
able
to
be
completely
producing
more
than
enough
to
feed
the
domestic
demand
of
million
bpd
related
trade
deal
could
boost
gasoline
priceswhile
crude
volume
and
prices
have
been
the
driving
factor
of
the
nation
s
rising
influence
in
international
oil
markets
it
s
certainly
not
the
only
factor
in
this
case
as
in
almost
every
other
economy
can
not
be
divorced
from
politics
sanctions
on
venezuela
and
iran
have
lent
a
big
helping
hand
discouraging
nations
around
the
world
from
buying
oil
from
the
two
targeted
nations
lest
they
fall
into
the
bad
graces
of
the
world
s
largest
economy
the
numbers
that
the
is
celebrating
now
bpd
to
europe
over
is
around
the
same
level
that
iranian
imports
were
at
before
the
iran
nuclear
deal
was
revoked
and
a
fresh
round
of
sanctions
were
politics
in
venezuela
more
volatile
than
ever
with
some
notable
encouragement
from
the
and
trump
s
stance
showing
no
signs
of
slowing
it
looks
like
foreign
policy
will
continue
to
spell
major
success
for
crude

the
european
and
