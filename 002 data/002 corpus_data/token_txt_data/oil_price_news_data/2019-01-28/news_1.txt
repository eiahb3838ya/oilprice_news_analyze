blanket
oil
import
ban
on

weighed

skeptically
saying
this
could
lead
to
a
pretty
sharp
increase
in
gasoline
prices
which
would
make
the
measure
unpopular
so
far
however
there
is
no
official
word
of

venezuela
is
being
rocked
by
protests
and

has
called
for
more
people
to
take
to
the
streets
to
topple

call
came
on
the
heels
of
an
ultimatum
from
the
european
union
for
caracas
to
set
a
date
for
new
elections
at
the
same
time
maduro

publicly
demonstrated
