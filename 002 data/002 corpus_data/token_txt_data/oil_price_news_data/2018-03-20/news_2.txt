u.s., europe and africa boost oil exports to asia
at
the
good
ship
clipper
we
like
to
look
at
flows
from
two
perspectives
sinks
and
sources
the
sources
are
the
main
origins
of
the
flows
the
key
exporting
regions
such
as
the
middle
east
latin
america
and
west
africa
as
for
the
sinks
they
are
key
regions
to
which
these
barrels
drain
continues
to
be
an
sink
for
global
crude
flows
with
waterborne
discharge
in
the
region
clocking
in
at
around
million
barrels
per
day
while
much
has
been
made
of
rising
crude
exports
into
asia
of
late
other
regions
in
the
atlantic
basin
have
shown
pockets
of
strength
in
the
last

asia
from
the
north
sea
the
and
west
africa
averaged
just
under
million
barrels
per
day
in
up
by
over
a
quarter
on
the
prior
year
of
last
year
strength
was
to
do
with
the
ramp
up
in
the
availability
of
crude
egged
on
by
rising
domestic
production
while
another
piece
of
the
puzzle
was
the
narrowing
spread
betwixt
brent
and
the
benchmark
amid
the
opec
production

making
north
sea
crude
a
more
attractive
proposition
a
similar
trend

has
continued
this
year
with

million

nigeria

continue
to
be
the
behemoths
of

africa
in
terms
of
production

exports
it
has
been
loadings
out
of
congo
brazzaville
to
asia
which
have
provided
the
majority
of
the
increase
in
flows
from
the
region
last
year
the
vast

of
exports
are
medium

we

these

as

both
