imposes
tighter
limits
on
positions
to
keep
any
one
trader
from
having
a
very
large
position
and
therefore
an
undue
influence
over
the

has
been
one
of
the
most
outspoken
critics
of
the
new
mifid
ii
regulations
in
europe
arguing
that
unnecessarily
complex
regulations
would
push
derivatives

away
from
the
