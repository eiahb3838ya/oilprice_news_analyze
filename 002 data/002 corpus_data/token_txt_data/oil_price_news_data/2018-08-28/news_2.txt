indiaâ€™s thirst for oil is outpacing china
in
a
disclosure
that
might
not
necessarily
be
good
news
for
indian
economic
and

planners
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
last
week
that
india
will
pass
china
as
the
country
with
the
largest
demand
for
oil
by
accounting
for
about
percent
of
total
global
oil
demand
gupta

director
for
energy
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
said
that
this
would
create
substantial
problems
for
the
country
s
refining
sector
this
is
clearly
an
uphill
task
unless
domestic
refiners
can
commit
to
their
planned
capacity
additions
gupta
said
in
statements
to

added
that
if
india
ca
find
ways
to
produce
its

it

to
more

said
that
iraq
s
rise
in
supply
with
crucial
ramifications
for
india
s
crude
mix
is
mainly
attributed
to
indian
refiners
growing
hunger
for
