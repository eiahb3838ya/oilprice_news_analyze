how u.s. shale flipped the script in global oil markets
in
the

asia
s
insatiable
oil
demand
i
covered
global
and
regional
oil
consumption
numbers
according
to
the
bp
statistical
review
of
world
recap
global
oil
consumption
rose
to
a
new
record
high
in
and
has
now
increased
in
of
the
past
years
over
the
past
decade
global
oil
consumption
has
increased
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
the
primary
driver
behind
the
past
decade
s
demand
jump
is
the
asia
pacific
region
which
was
the
source
of
percent
of
the
world
s
demand
growth
over
that
i
want
to
discuss
the
source
of
the
world
s
new
oil
production
in
recent
decade
ago
in
the
summer
of
the
price
of
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
was
racing
toward
a
barrel
over
the
previous
three
years
the
world
had
only
increased
oil
production
by
million
bpd
and
it
essentially
all
came
from
analysts
including
me
were
extremely
concerned
about
the
future
hold
opec
would
maintain
over
the
world
s
oil
supplies
it
appeared
that
there
would
an
enormous
transfer
of
wealth
from
those
countries
dependent
upon
oil
imports
like
the
united
states
to
opec
countries
in
many
cases
these
countries
have
interests
that
are
hostile
to
those
of
the
so
this
was
very
much
an
issue
of
national
the
future
played
out
differently
than
it
seemed
it
would
in
the
summer
of
unbeknownst
to
most
people
oil
producers
were
experimenting
with
a
marriage
between
two
established
oil
drilling
technologies
horizontal
drilling
and
hydraulic
success
of
this
marriage
would
unlock
oil
in
tight
oil
and
shale
oil
deposits
that
had
previously
been
too
expensive
to
recover
and
would
result
in
one
of
the
greatest
oil
booms
the
world
had
ever
seen
in
fact
the
fracking
revolution
caused
oil
production
to
turn
upward
in
and
then
rise
over
the
next
seven
years
at
the
fastest
rate
in
it
is
still
true
that
opec
produced
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
in
the
majority
of
new
oil
production
since
has
come
from
the
supply
growth
the
million
bpd
of
new
oil
production
since
the
supplied
million
bpd
percent
the
world
s
two
other
major
countries
saudi
arabia
and
russia
saw
their
production
increase
by
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
respectively
since
overall
increased
its
production
by
million
bpd
since
primarily
as
a
result
of
production
growth
in
saudi
arabia
iraq
and
iran
but
opec
s
gains
were
limited
by
production
declines
in
venezuela
libya
and
nigeria
there
were
also
regional
production
declines
in
europe
asia
africa
and
south
and
central
america

higheralso
notable
is
that
canada
and
mexico
are
major
oil
producers
although
mexico
s
production
has
been
declining
overall
north
america
supplied
million
bpd
of
the
world
s
oil
in
percent
this
was
ahead
of
every
other
region
of
the
world
except
for
the
middle
east
which
produced
million
bpd
or
percent
of
the
world
s
to
the
bp
statistical
review
the
now
leads
both
saudi
arabia
and
russia
in
crude
oil
production
this
is
in
part
because
bp
s
definition
of
oil
includes
natural
gas
liquids
ngls
which
grew
by
about
two
million
bpd
in
the
as
natural
gas
production
boomed
without
the
ngls
the
would
probably
have
been
behind
saudi
arabia
but
probably
not
russia
in
total
oil
is
hard
to
overstate
the
consequences
of
the
fracking
revolution
because
the
oil
production
surge
broke
opec
s
stranglehold
on
global
oil
prices
but
tight
oil
production
will
inevitably
slow
and
once
again
begin
to
decline
the
key
questions
are
how
soon
this
will
happen
and
whether
a
return
to
oil
and
in
turn
opec
s
stranglehold
awaits
