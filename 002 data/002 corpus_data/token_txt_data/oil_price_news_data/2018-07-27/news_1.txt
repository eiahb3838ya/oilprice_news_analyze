profitability is finally within reach for u.s. shale
the

drilling

was
like
running

treadmill
the
precipitous
decline
in
production
from

the
average
shale
well
produces
about
percent
of
its
oil
in
the
first
two
years
of
operation
meant
that
companies
had
to
keep
drilling

spike
in

prices
this
year
is
a
huge
gift
to
the
industry
with
breakeven
prices
on
shale
wells
much
lower
the
surge
in
prices
could
push
companies
into
profitable
territory
since
its
inception
the
industry
has
been
characterised
by
negative
free
cash
flow
as
expectations
of
rising
production
and
cost
improvements
led
to
continuous
overspending
in
the
sector
the
iea
said
over
the
last
few
months
the
industry
as
a
whole
has
seen
a
notable
improvement
in
financial
conditions
though
the
picture
varies
markedly
by
company
and
the
overall
health
of
the
industry
remains
the
conditions
are
lining
up
in
a
favorable
way
for
the
shale
industry
production
is
rising
prices
are
up
and
so
far
cost
inflation
has
not
eaten
away
too
much
at
the
efficiency
gains
also
the
industry
is
much
more
consolidated
than
it
was
in
the
past
which
brings
economies
of
scale
improvements
in
drilling
technology
and
the
spread
of
digitalization
is
also
yielding
benefits
w
e
estimate
that
the
shale
sector
as
a
whole
is
on
track
to
achieve
for
the
first
time
in
its
history

free
cash

the
next

there
are
risks
to
this
forecast
the
pipeline
constraints
in
the
permian
will
force
a
slowdown
in

over
the
next

more

companies
that
have
not
locked
up
hedges
for
their
output
or
have
not
secured
