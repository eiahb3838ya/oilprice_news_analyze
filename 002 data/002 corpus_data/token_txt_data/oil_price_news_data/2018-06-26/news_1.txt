is the eagle ford about to boom again?
when
the
geological
survey
published
its
updated
resource
estimate
for
the
wolfcamp
basin
in
the
permian
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
added
fresh
fuel
to
an
already
major
rush
to
the
permian
now
the
authority
has
updated
its
resource
estimate
for
the
eagle
ford
which
could
spark
a
similar
rush
for
those
whose
pockets
are
deep
usgs
said
it
now
estimates
undiscovered
technically
recoverable
oil
and
gas
resources
in
the
eagle
ford
to
be
around
billion
barrels
of
crude
and
trillion
cu
ft
of
natural
gas
plus
billion
barrels
of
natural
gas
resources
are
those
that
are
estimated
based
on
geological
data
and
existing
reserves
in
exploitation
they
may
or
may
not
be
commercially
viable
unlike
technically
recoverable
resources
which
are
considered
extractable
economically
with
existing
technology
in
other
words
the
numbers
don
t
necessarily
mean
much
in
still
sound
pretty
impressive
though
and
with
eagle
ford
s
reputation
as
part
of
america
s
oil
heartland
the
update
is
bound
to
garner
attention
from
drillers
with
spare
cash
to
tap
new
resources
to
see
if
they
are
indeed
technically
recoverable
at
a
low
enough
attention
will
be
all
the
stronger
because
of
drillers
pipeline
woes
in
the
nearby
permian
the
star
of
the
shale
revolution
is
panting
under
the
weight
of
too
much
crude
pumped
and
not
enough
pipelines
available
to
carry
it
to
the
gulf
coast
the
eagle
ford
the
situation
is
for
the
moment
better
and
as
pioneer
natural
resources
chief
executive
scott
sheffield
said
last
week
some
drillers
will
stop
drilling
in
the
permian
but
others
will
pack
up
and
leave
the
destination
that
would
make
the
most
sense
will
be
the
eagle
ford
related
power
grab
in
libya
threatens
oil
industrythe
eagle
ford
is
currently
the
producing
shale
play
with
an
estimated
daily
average
of
million
bpd
in
eia
s
latest
drilling
productivity
report
this
is
expected
to
rise
to
million
bpd
next
month
the
number
of
active
rigs
is
also
rising
from
a
trough
of
just
at
the
height
of
the
oil
price
crisis
to
the
same
time
production
costs
are
not
all
that
much
higher
than
the
average
in
the
permian
and
let
s
not
forget
that
this
average
covers
a
wide
range
of
cost
levels
in
the
eagle
ford
this
average
is
less
than
us
per
barrel
and
although
this
is
higher
than
the
breakeven
of
the
permian
the
fact
that
there
is
more
spare
pipeline
capacity
is
tempting
for
drillers
having
to
sell
their
permian
oil
at
a
steep
discount
to
wti
because
of
the
pipeline
fact
drillers
are
already
focusing
more
on
the
eagle
ford
this
is
what
conocophillips
executive
vice
president
alan
hirshberg
said
during
an
earnings
call
in
april
there
s
just
been
less
competition
for
goods
and
services
in
the
eagle
ford
and
better
netbacks
because
there
ve
been
less
people
trying
to
jam
their
barrels
down
the
same
takeaway
capacity
so
everything
about
the
eagle
ford
is
really
hitting
on
all
cylinders
for
colorado
drillers
are
moving
into
the
permian
there
is
a
pickup
in
m
a
activity
in
the
area
and
there
are
new
pipelines
being
built
in
the
eagle
ford
as
well
could
we
see
an
exodus
from
the
permian
into
the
eagle
ford
