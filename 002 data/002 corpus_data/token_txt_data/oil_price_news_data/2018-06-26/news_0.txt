oil jumps as trump asks allies to cut off iranian oil
the
trump
administration
is
going
to
extreme
lengths
to
disrupt
as
much
oil
from
iran
as
possible
and
the
implications
for
the
oil
market
could
be
the
obama
administration
sought
to
isolate
iran
it
built
an
international
coalition
put
in
place
tight
sanctions
and
tried
to
curtail
iran
s
oil
exports
it
worked
knocking
around
million
barrels
per
day
offline
still
the
obama
administration
granted
leeway
to
an
array
of
countries
that
depended
on
iranian
oil
including
india
japan
and
much
of
the
eu
by
granting
them
exemptions
from
sanctions
as
long
as
they
did
their
best
to
reduce
trump
administration
has
no
compunction
about
making
harsh
demands
to
various
countries
including
allies
to
cut
off
iranian
government
is
calling
on
its
allies
to
zero
out
imports
of
oil
from
iran
by
november
or
else
face
sanctions
and
washington
is
leaning
towards
granting
no
waivers
at
all
an
official
from
the
state
department
said
on
tuesday
that
it
had
plans
to
follow
up
on
the
matter
with
turkey
india
and
china
even
as
the
is
trying
not
to
adversely
impact
these
countries
bloomberg
last
week
bloomberg
also
reported
that
the
has
sent
a
request
to
japan
to
completely
halt
imported
oil
from
iran
japan
imported
a
little
less
than
bpd
from
iran
in
fallout
from
a
hard
line
from
washington
could
be
significant
in
the
lead
up
to
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
many
analysts
predicted
that
the
trump
administration
would
struggle
to
match
the
impact
of
international
sanctions
on
iran
from
through
particularly
because
the
would
have
to
do
it
without
the
help
of
the
european
union
russia
or
china
as
such
the
thinking
was
that
the
trump
administration
might
only
be
able
to
disrupt
a
few
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
supply

in

bloomberg
television
interview
we
are
going
to
find
some
other
way
the
market
was
more
relaxed
about
the
impact
of
renewed
sanctions
on
iran
when
it
was
first
announced
but
now
there
s
a
growing
realization
that
we
could
be
losing
close

million

of

is

keep
the

are
now
speculating
