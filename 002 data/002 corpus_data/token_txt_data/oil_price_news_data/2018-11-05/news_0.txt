$20 canadian oil could last another year
as
the
biggest
canadian
oil
producers
reported
earnings
in
the
past
two
weeks
analysts
were
more
interested
in
the
companies
expectations
about
takeaway
capacity
rather
than
earnings
due
to
the
price
differential
of
canada
s
heavy
oil
to
wti
acknowledging
that
the
record
low
prices
of
western
canadian
select
wcs
benchmark
price
of
oil
from
canada
s
oil
sands
delivered
at
hardisty
an
anomaly
on
the
market
many
of
the
biggest
oil
producers
in
canada
expect
some
relief
to
come
in
the
short
term
with
refineries
returning
from
maintenance
this
quarter
and
with
shipments
to
the
continuing
to
set
new
records
in
the
coming
months
despite
these
eases
in
capacity
constraints
canadian
oil
producers
pin
their
hopes
on
at
least
one
pipeline
enbridge
line
out
of
canada
going
into
service
at
the
latter
half
of
to
further
alleviate
bottlenecks
and
return
the
wcs
prices
to
their
normal
discount
to
wcs
selling
for
as
low
as
us
in
recent
weeks
some
of
canada
s
producers
curtailed
heavy
oil
production
in
and
some
struck
agreements
with
rail
companies
to
transport
their
crude
to
the
market
operations
and
expectations
at
each
of
the
companies
vary
but
their
collective
underlying
message
in
earnings
calls
was
that
although
some
relief
could
be
coming
soon
high
differentials
may
persist
until
pipelines
come
into
