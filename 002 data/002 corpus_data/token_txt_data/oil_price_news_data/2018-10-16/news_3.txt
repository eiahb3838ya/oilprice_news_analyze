high prices benefit iran despite lost oil exports
iran
is
raking
in
more
cash
from
oil
exports
thanks
to
higher
prices
despite
the
decline
in
amount
of
oil
exported
the
country
s
vice
president
eshaq
jahagiri
told
iranian
media
as
quoted
by
radio
free
america
thinks
saudi
arabia
can
replace
this
oil
but
right
now
iran
s
oil
has
reached
more
than
per
barrel
and
with
half
the
previous
exports
we
will
have
the
same
income
as
before
jahagiri
said
adding
that
while
some
of
iran
s
oil
clients
had
stopped
buying
its
crude
oil
the
country
had
taken
on
some
new
buyers
on
the
other
hand
we
have
also
negotiated
with
traditional
customers
to
find
solutions
for
cooperation
the
vice
president
said
as
quoted
by
state
news
agency
shana
it
not
strange
for
countries
that
are
being
sanctioned
to
look
for
ways
to
circumvent
radio
free
europe
notes
that
jahagiri
s
remarks
are
in
essence
an
acknowledgement
that
iran
s
oil
exports
had
shrunk
by
half
from
million
bpd
exported
before
president
trump
pulled
the
united
states
out
of
the
joint
comprehensive
plan
of
action
commonly
called
the
iran
nuclear
deal
related
are
oil
exports
really
unstoppable
yet
caution
is
advisable
when
drawing
conclusions
about
iran
some
perceptive
observers
have
already
noted
that
iran
has
a
vested
interest
in
keeping
prices
as
high
as
possible
amid
the
preparations
for
sanctions
which
will
snap
back
in
november
in
other
words
iran
would
say
its
exports
are
falling
by
a
lot
even
if
they
are
not
falling
by
that
much
this
suggestion
is
supported
by
the
practice
among
iranian
oil
tankers
to
turn
off
their
geolocation
equipment
effectively
becoming
invisible
to
trackers
until
they
reach
their
destination
skewing
shipping
data
released
in
the
period
while
they
were
in
the
last
few
days
oil
prices
have
received
strong
support
from
allegations
that
saudi
agents
killed
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
creating
tension
between
washington
and
riyadh
tehran

still
the
effect
of
this
tension
seems
to
have
been
temporary
