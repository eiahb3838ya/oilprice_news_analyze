u.s. shaleâ€™s glory days are numbered
there
are
some
early
signs
that
the
shale
industry
is
starting
to
show
its
age
with
depletion
rates
on
the
study
from
wood
mackenzie
found
that
some
wells
in
the
permian
wolfcamp
were
suffering
from
decline
rates
at
or
above
percent
after
five
years
much
higher
than
the
to
percent
originally
anticipated
if
you
were
expecting
a
well
to
hit
the
normal
or
percent
after
five
years
and
you
start
seeing
a
percent
decline
this
becomes
more
of
a
reserves
issue
than
an
economics
issue
said
dukes
a
director
at
industry
consultant
wood
mackenzie
according
to
bloomberg
as
a
result
you
have
to
grow
activity
year
over
year
or
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
offset
moreover
shale
wells
fizzle
out
much
faster
than
major
offshore
oil
fields
which
is
significant
because
the
boom
in
shale
drilling
over
the
past
few
years
means
that
there
is
more
depletion
in
absolute
terms
than
ever
before
a
slowdown
in
drilling
will
mean
that
depletion
starts
to
become
a
serious
separate
study
from
goldman
sachs
takes
a
deep
look
at
whether
or
not
the
shale
industry
is
starting
to
see
the
effects
of
age
the
investment
bank
says
the
average
life
span
for
the
most
transformative
areas
of
global
oil
supply
is
between
and
of
these
rapid
growth
periods
include
the
ussr
in
the
mexico
and
the
north
sea
in
the
late
venezuela
s
heavy
oil
production
in
the
brazil
in
the
early
and
shale
and
canada
s
oil
sands
in
the
each
had
their
period
in
the
limelight
but
ultimately
many
of
them
plateaued
and
entered
an
extended
period
of
decline
though
some
suffering
steeper
declines
than
others
related
oil
prices
under
pressure
as
shale
supply
shale
is
entering
the
lower
end
of
this
range
at
about
years
while
shale
is
still
growing
there
are
some
signs
that
the
shale
tail
which
goldman
says
is
the
phase
when
shale
becomes
a
less
meaningful
driver
of
global
oil
supply
may
not
be
that
far
lays
out
the
five
signals
to
watch
out
for
which
would
indicate
that
the
glory
days
of
shale
are
over
although
goldman
says
the
real
trouble
may
be
a
few
years
off
there
is
some
evidence
that
some
of
those
dynamics
are
beginning
to
occur
the
investment
bank
offers
a
breakdown
as
when
inventory
is
being
revised
down
not
up
this
is
already
occurring
in
some
areas
such
as
the
eagle
ford
goldman
notes
that
eog
resources
inventory
fell
in
the
eagle
ford
in
the
second
quarter
with
the
company
having
drilled
more
wells
than
it
added
in
new
when
well
productivity
stops
improving
this
one
is
inconclusive
although
perhaps
it
is
beginning
to
become
a
concern
goldman
notes
that
the
industry
posed
explosive
productivity
gains
in
but
those
gains
slowed
this
year
decline
rates
have
accelerated
in
the
eagle
ford
and
delaware
basin
but
in
the
aggregate
there
may
still
be
some
room
for
improvement
for
a
little
when
supply
cost
rises
for
structural
reasons
costs
have
climbed
recently
but
largely
because
of
cyclical
reasons
goldman
argues
high
rates
of
drilling
have
created
bottlenecks
and
pushed
up
costs
but
those
would
come
down
if
the
cycle
soured
it
is
still
early
for
this
when
capital
shifts
to
other
regions
this
looks
the
least
threatening
of
the
five
warning
signs
shale
remains
a
top
priority
and
the
oil
majors
have
stepped
up
their
spending
in
shale
pivoting
out
of
other
regions
spending
on
crashed
and
hasn
t
recovered
there
has
been
some
shifting
of
capital
within
shale
plays
such
as
from
the
permian
to
the
eagle
ford
and
the
bakken
but
this
is
mostly
due
to
pipeline
when
growth
is
no
longer
lagging
indicator
goldman
sachs
still
sees
shale
adding
million
at
least
through
this
indicator
won
t
become
clear
until
the
production
gains
actually
start
slowing
down
related
are
natural
gas
prices
set
to
spike
the
investment
bank
says
that
companies
are
still
a
solid
bet
through
the
early
and
it
singles
out
companies
like
concho
resources
or
pioneer
natural
resources
two
large
permian
drillers
but
by
shale
e
ps
will
begin
to
see
their
stars
that
point
goldman
warns
investors
to
pivot
out
of
shale
companies
and
focus
either
on
diversified
companies
that
have
assets
outside
of
shale
or
on
the
integrated
oil
majors
w
e
believe
future
resource
additions
outside
shale
deemed
low
on
the
cost
curve
will
likely
be
positively
received
by
investors
goldman
stated
citing
hess
as
a
company
that
might
fit
this
description
because
of
the
huge
oil
fields
it
is
developing
with
exxonmobil
in
offshore
another
way
depletion
will
become
a
greater
theme
in
the
future
so
companies
that
are
sitting
on
assets
that
deplete
quickly
will
fall
out
of
favor
those
that
can
stave
off
declines
will
fare
much
investment
bank
still
expects
shale
to
add
around
million
barrels
per
day
each
year
through
at
least
but
with
early
signs
of
strain
limits
on
productivity
and
steeper
decline
rates
it
is
clear
that
the
industry
s
glory
days
are
