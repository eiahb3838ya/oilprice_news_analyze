why saudi arabia cut july oil production
despite
its
pledge
to
boost
crude
oil
supply
to
offset
supply
disruptions
saudi
arabia
s
oil
production
in
july
slipped
by
bpd
from
june
to
average
million
bpd
last
month
according
to
the
secondary
sources
in
opec
s
closely
watched
monthly
oil
market
report
published
on
saudis
themselves
reported
an
even
lower
production
number
at
million
bpd
saudi
arabia
to
opec
that
its
crude
oil
production
dropped
by
bpd
from
the
production
it
had
reported
for
looks
at
the
secondary
sources
production
figures
when
it
calculates
compliance
and
the
past
two
weeks
there
were
contradicting
numbers
about
saudi
oil
production
with
many
polls
predicting
that
opec
s
biggest
producer
had
likely
pumped
at
near
levels
while
saudi
and
opec
sources
claimed
that
production
actually
dropped
and
was
nowhere
close
to
to
the
financial
times
one
reason
for
the
lower
production
in
july
was
that
saudi
arabia
didn
t
see
demand
for
its
crude
oil
as
high
as
it
had
expected

would
see
its

it
was
unwilling
to
push
the

into
oversupply
