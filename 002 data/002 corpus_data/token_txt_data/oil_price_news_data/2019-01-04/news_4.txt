opec is losing its stranglehold on oil prices
many
articles
have
been
written
this
past
year
about
the
impending
demise
of
opec
shale
oil
it
has
been
argued
has
ended
the
cartel
s
stranglehold
on
oil
s
some
truth
to
that
argument
but
it
also
understates
opec
s
dominant
position
in
the
oil
often
try
to
imagine
the
decisions
i
would
make
given
opec
s
situation
and
the
unexpected
emergence
of
shale
oil
production
for
decades
opec
has
had
the
luxury
of
looking
at
the
global
supply
and
demand
outlook
and
raising
or
cutting
production
as
they
saw
oil
emergesbut

since
the

the
world
s
two
other
major
countries
saudi
arabia
and
russia
saw
their
production
increase
by
million
bpd
and

respectively
since
surge
of
new
oil
production
from
the
put
opec
under
a
lot
of
pressure
to
either
cut
production
to
balance
the
market
or
to
defend
market
share
i
thought
it
was
in
their
best
interest
to
cut
production
but
instead
in
they
made
the
decision
to
defend
market
share
i
deemed
that
opec
s
trillion
dollar
collapsefive
weeks
after
that
thanksgiving
announcement
oil
prices
had
dropped
into
the
after
already
sliding
from
to
the
upper
over
the
prior
four
months
indeed
opec
realized
its
dilemma
and
in
the
cartel
made
an
agreement
with
several
countries
most
importantly
russia
to
cut
oil
production
by
million
bpd
related
could
make
or
break
opecthat
was
a
significant
cut
and
oil
prices
ultimately
recovered
back
to
the
range
but
as
i
noted
in
an
article
last
year
production
growth
could
potentially
offset
those
production
cuts
in
a
little
over
a
did
in
the
past
months
oil
production
has
grown
by
million
bpd
this
continued
growth
again
puts
opec
in
the
position
of
either
cutting
production
to
balance
the
markets
or
in
potentially
letting
the
price
crash
the
latter
approach
had
some
limited
success
in
as
production
did
dip
in
response
to
the
price
war
but
as
soon
as
prices
recovered
so
did
s
new
paradigmbut
opec
still
produced
percent
of
the
world
s
oil
in
add
russia
to
the
mix
and
the
two
entities
controlled
percent
of
global
oil
production
and
nearly
percent
of
the
world
s
proved
oil
reserves
in
production
from
opec
and
russia
is
more
than
million
bpd
in
theory
they
should
have
substantial
pricing
power
but
the
rapid
growth
of
shale
oil
production
continues
to
give
them
oil
rises
on
hopes
of
a
trade
dealit
is
certain
that
the
oil
production
surge
broke
opec
s
stranglehold
on
global
oil
prices
if
the
shale
oil
boom
in
the
hadn
t
happened
opec
and
russia
would
have
enjoyed
the
fruits
of
oil
for
the
past
decade
the
trade
deficit
would
have
now
opec
has
to
look
at
the
picture
and
try
to
estimate
just
how
much
further
production
can
expand
if
we
are
reaching
the
limits
of
shale
production
growth
then
opec
can
go
through
a
couple
of
cycles
of
production
cuts
and
they
will
be
back
in
the
driver
s
if
production
can
expand
for
another
decade
opec
will
have
lost
complete
control
over
oil
prices
in
that
case
production
will
likely
only
slow
when
electric
vehicles
are
starting
to
take
a
serious
bite
out
of
global
oil
of
which
oil
demand
continues
to
grow
at
more
than
million
bpd
every
year
that
helps
mitigate
the
impact
of
production
growth
but
as
long
as
production
grows
annually
at
a
faster
pace
than
global
demand
which
it
has
several
times
in
recent
years
opec
is
going
to
have
to
live
with
either
production
cuts
which
also
help
prop
up
marginal
producers
or
