is venezuela’s downward spiral opec’s achilles heel or saving grace?
opec
and
us
shale
have
been
duking
it
out
in
the
oil
markets
for
a
few
years
since
the
days
of
oil
opec
led
by
saudi
arabia
took
up
a
campaign
to
flood
the
market
with
oil
to
drown
out
the
rising
stars
of
the
us
shale
world
but
that
oil
came
at
a
price
and
the
glut
sunk
prices
to
uber
lows
that
hurt
every
oil
producer
in
the
more
than
was
no
exception
to
feeling
hurt
its
state
oil
company
shall
we
say
the
hugo
chavez
administration
s
personal
piggy
already
reeling
from
corruption
and
was
busy
fighting
with
foreign
oil
firms
who
were
operating
in
country
and
subsequently
booted
out
the
country
had
no
money
to
invest
in
its
cash
cow
to
keep
it
running
president
nicolas
maduro
who
took
office
when
oil
producers
were
for
the
most
part
fat
dumb
and
along
with
pdvsa
a
country
that
was
in
crisis
with
some
even
saying
back
then
that
it
was
on
the
verge
of
an
economic
breakdown
with
moody
s
tallying
a
public
sector
deficit
of
percent
of
its
gdp
and
when
oil
prices
started
to
tank
venezuela
s
dire
economic
situation
became
ago
venezuela
was
an
instrumental
member
of
opec
with
chavez
reestablishing
venezuela
s
seat
at
the
opec
table
today
venezuela
is
still
an
active
member
with
maduro
serving
as
one
of
the
loudest
cheerleaders
of
the
original
opec
production
cut
deal
solidified
in
late
after
his
whirlwind
tour
designed
to
save
its
country
from
ruin
with
the
increased
oil
revenues
that
would
likely
come
from
such
a
deal
maduro
visited
all
the
who
s
who
in
the
opec
oil
world
including
iran
qatar
and
opec
kingpin
saudi
that
time
maduro
claimed
to
have
a
formula
that
would
stabilize
oil
prices
for
ten
years
that
concept
now
squarely
in
the
rearview
mirror
is
clearly
viewed
as
both
tragic
and
laughable
given
the
recent
price
swings
related
could
make
or
break
opecdespite
maduro
s
plan
being
clearly
dead
in
the
water
opec
was
still
able
to
pull
off
a
production
cut
deal
that
managed
to
lift
prices
for
a
time
in
fact
the
plan
was
so
successful
that
combined
with
a
few
geopolitical
events
between
iran
and
the
united
states
and
china
and
the
united
states
and
libya
nigeria
and
venezuela
s
unintentional
production
outages
opec
conspired
to
lift
production
some
would
say
this
is
in
part
attributed
to
maduro
s
full
circle
the
market
is
once
again
facing
falling
oil
prices
along
with
another
planned
production
cut
from
the
cartel
venezuela
who
did
manage
to
benefit
somewhat
from
the
original
production
cut
deal
in
is
producing
fewer
and
fewer
barrels
of
oil
on
a
monthly
basis
ending
with
a
daily
production
level
that
is
near
lows
for
the
latin
american
country
and
no
one
is
holding
onto
hope
that
venezuela
s
oil
production
will
is
no
one
but
venezuela
s
production
sure
to
continue
its
downward
spiral
opec
is
bound
to
catch
a
break
on
the
production
cuts
opec
agreed
to
cut
bpd
this
time
around
and
venezuela
will
likely
eat
away
at
some
of
that
bpd
without
even
trying
this
takes
some
of
the
heat
off
other
opec
members
who
may
find
it
difficult
to
curb
production
yet
the
surface
this
indicates
that
venezuela
s
opec
membership
is
paying
off
for
opec
it
has
been
instrumental
in
getting
opec
members
on
board
to
reduce
production
and
it
is
cutting
its
own
barrels
produced
in
great
numbers
even
if
not
on
purpose
allowing
other
members
such
as
iraq
to
overproduce
without
hurting
opec
s
overall
compliance
related
falling
rig
count
supports
crude
priceshowever
opec
is
a
cartel
and
that
cartel
s
purpose
is
to
coordinate
and
unify
the
petroleum
policies
of
its
member
countries
and
ensure
the
stabilization
of
oil
markets
in
order
to
secure
an
efficient
economic
and
regular
supply
of
petroleum
to
consumers
a
steady
income
to
producers
and
a
fair
return
on
capital
for
those
investing
in
the
petroleum
unfortunately
for
opec
venezuela
s
economic
and
political
situation
is
so
bleak
that
it
has
almost
no
control
over
its
own
oil
production
it
can
not
ramp
up
production
it
can
not
export
more
it
has
failed
to
secure
this
regular
supply
of
petroleum
to
its
consumers
as
opec
s
mission
statement
calls
for
in
fact
venezuela
has
begged
borrowed
and
keep
pdvsa
afloat
and
still
it
of
opec
s
claim
to
fame
is
that
it
has
the
clout
to
move
oil
prices
up
or
down
by
moving
production
up
or
venezuela
can
no
longer
participate
in
that
activity
opec
s
clout
has
waned
thanks
to
the
rise
of
us
shale
but
also
due
to
what
some
are
seeing
as
opec
s
production
capacity
surely
venezuela
s
production
capacity
is
maxed
and
surely
that
max
will
continue
to
decrease
as
venezuela
s
production
capacity
dwindles
so
does
opec
s
which
is
likely
why
russia
and
a
few
extras
have
been
brought
into
the
opec
the
short
term
venezuela
helps
opec
to
meet
some
immediate
production
cut
goals
in
the
long
term
however
venezuela
will
likely
remain
a
drain
on
opec
s
overall
capacity
as
it
is
unable
to
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
the
cartel
that
relies
on
production
manipulation
to
swing
