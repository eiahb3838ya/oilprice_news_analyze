new data suggests shocking shale slowdown
shale
executives
often
boast
of
low
breakeven
prices
reassuring
investors
of
their
ability
to
operate
at
a
high
level
even
when
oil
prices
fall
but
new
data
suggests
that
the
industry
slowed
dramatically
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
in
response
to
the
plunge
in
oil
survey
from
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
dallas
finds
that
shale
activity
slammed
on
the
brakes

the
fourth

positive
but
barely
so
plunging
from
in
the
third
quarter
to
in
the
fourth
the
dallas
fed
reported
on
january
reading
is
only
slightly
positive
zero
would
mean
that
business
activity
from
texas
energy
firms
was
flat
compared
to
the
prior
quarter
a
negative
reading
would
mean
a
contraction
in
deceleration
was
true
for
multiple
segments
within
oil
and
gas
for
instance
the
oil
production
index
fell
from
in
the
third
quarter
to
in
the
fourth
the
natural
gas
production
index
to
in
the
fourth
quarter
down
from
in
the
prior
even
as
production
held
up
drilling
activity
indicated
a
sharper
slowdown
was
underway
the
index
for
utilization
of
equipment
by
oilfield
services
firms
dropped
sharply
in
the
fourth
quarter
down
from
points
in
the
third
quarter
to
just
in
the
fourth
falling
to
the
point
where
there
was
almost
no
growth
at
all
related
could
make
or
break
opecmeanwhile
employment
has
also
taken
a
hit
the
employment
index
fell
from
to
suggesting
a
moderating
in
both
employment
and
work
hours
growth
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
dallas
fed
wrote
labor
conditions
in
oilfield
services
were
particularly
hit
data
lends
weight
to
comments
made
by
top
oilfield
service
firms
from
several
months
ago
schlumberger
and
halliburton
warned
in
the
third
quarter
of
last
year
that
shale
companies
were
slowing
drilling
activity
pipeline
constraints
well
productivity
problems
and
budget
exhaustion
was
leading
to
weaker
drilling
conditions
the
comments
were
notable
at
the
time
and
received
press
coverage
but
oil
prices
were
still
high
and
still
rising
and
so
was
shale
output
the
crash
in
oil
prices
and
the
worsening
slowdown
in
the
shale
patch
puts
those
comments
in
new
does
all
of
this
mean
if
oil
producers
are
not
hiring
service
firms
and
deploying
equipment
that
suggests
they
are
rather
price
sensitive
the
fall
in
oil
prices
forced
cutbacks
in
drilling
activity
oilfield
service
firms
in
particular
are
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
slowdown
executives
from
oilfield
service
firms
told
the
dallas
fed
that
their
operating
margins
declined

the

exports
to
the
fall
to
lowin
fact
roughly
percent
of
the
oil
and
gas
executives
that
responded
to
the
dallas
fed
s
survey
said
that
the
recent
drop
in
oil
prices
caused
them
to
lower
expectations
for
capital
spending
in
a
further
percent
said
that
it
was

make

only
percent
of
oil
executives
who
responded
to
the

survey
said
that

downturn
would

rig

barely

october
when

still
in

it
takes
several
months
before
the

some

already
