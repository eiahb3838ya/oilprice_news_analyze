is oil demand growth a certainty in 2019?
crude
oil
prices
have
gained
roughly
percent
since
hitting
a
low
point
in
late
december
and
there
are
plenty
of
signs
that
suggest
the
market
is
poised
to
claw
back
some
further
gains
in
the
months
ahead
however
all
of
that
depends
on
the
health
of
the
global
economy
which
is
not
necessarily
guaranteed
to
fact
a
slew
of
evidence
is
mounting
that
global
economic
activity
is
starting
to
slow
manufacturing
data
from
december
points
to
a
slowdown
the
institute
for
supply
management
s
purchasing
managers
index
declined
by
points
last
month
the
largest
monthly
decrease
in
ten
recently
posted
similar
numbers
manufacturing
activity
in
china
contracted
in
december
the
first
time
it
has
done
so
in
nearly
two
years
that
showed
external
demand
remained
subdued
due
to
the
trade
frictions
between
china
and
the
while
domestic
demand
weakened
more
notably

zhengsheng
zhong
director
of
macroeconomic
analysis
at
cebm
group
a
subsidiary
of
caixin
it
is
looking
increasingly
likely
that
the
chinese
economy
may
come
under
greater
downward
apple
this
week
slashed
its
revenue
outlook
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
two
decades
and
its
share
price
plunged
by
percent
in
response
the
lower
revenue
projection
largely
comes
down
to
disappointing
sales
in
china
apple
s
fortunes
may
seem
irrelevant
to
the
oil
market
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
symptom
of
a
slowdown
in
china
then
oil
traders
should
probably
pay
good
news
is
that
the
trade
war
has
recently
shown
some
signs
of
a
thaw
presidents
trump
and
xi
apparently
made
good
progress
on
trade
disputes
during
a
phone
conversation
a
few
days
ago
if
they
can
hash
out
a
deal
that
heads
off
steep
tariff
hikes
it
could
cushion
the
blow
of
a
potential
economic
slowdown
the
temporary
truce
between
the
two
countries
ends
in
trade
war
could
persist
unless
china
cavesthe
problem
is
that
economic
trends
once
they
get
going
can
build
on
themselves
leading
to
compounding
pain
if
the
economy
slows
companies
respond
by
cutting
investment
hiring
and
spending
which
slows
things
down
even
further
the
same
is
true
in
bond
and
equity
markets
falling
asset
prices
can
kick

federal
reserve
reportedly
places
the
odds
of
an
economic
recession
this
year
at
percent
which
is
the
highest
reading
since
the
fed
itself
is
helping
to
play
a
role
in
boosting
those
odds
hiking
interest
rates
in
the
face
of
a
darkening
economic
outlook
the
central
bank
raised
interest
rates
in
december
and
is
expected
to
do
so
two
more
times
this
obscure
but
important
metric
suggests
an
economic
recession
could
be
forthcoming
last
month
the
yields
on
treasury
notes
fell
below
those
of
and
notes
such
a
development
has
reliably
preceded
economic
recessions
in
the
gasoline
prices
could
be
about
to
skyrocketwhat
does
all
of
this
mean
for
oil
prices
the
market
is
oversupplied
although
prices
have
already
fallen
quite
a
bit
to
reflect
that
reality
it
s
conceivable
that
the
worst
is
over
with
phasing
in
supply
cuts
and
iran
sanctions
waivers
set
to
expire
in
several
the
demand
picture
is
completely
up
in
the
air
which
is
ironic
because
demand
has
been
steady
for
several
years
while
supply
has
confounded
analysts
to
be
sure
predicting
supply
growth
this
year
is
also
problematic
but
for
the
first
time
in
quite
a
while
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
uncertainty
about
the
health
of
oil
uncertainty
is
having
effects
on
oil
prices
oil
is
on
concerns
of
supply
and

phil

an

in
chicago
told
reuters
it
really
a
battle
between
the
supply
situation
which
looks
to
be
tightening
versus
the
possibility
that
demand
will
drop
