much
has
been
made
about
the
dramatic
cost
reductions
that
shale
drillers
have
implemented
over
the
past
few
years
with
impressive
breakeven
prices
that
should
ensure
the

no

with

shale
executives

trumpeted

low

those
figures
are
at
times
or
otherwise
misleading
they
fail
to
include
the
cost
of

and
other
costs

they

reflect

be

the
best
shale

in
the

currently
unprofitable
given

the

is

could
shield
shale
producers
from

ps
routinely
hedge
their

ahead
just
months
ago
some
of
those
hedges
looked
like
a
bad
bet
producers
had
locked
in
prices
in
the
or
so
for
much
of
even
as
oil
prices
over
the
summer
traded
much
higher
than
that
for
instance
anadarko

said
it
missed
out

it
locked

the

for

in
say
the

feel
pretty
good
about
that
right
about
now
to
the
extent
a
shale
company
has
already
secured
hedging
for
they
may
not
alter
their
drilling
plans
for
next

all
that
for
many
though
is
the
fact
that
the
industry
has
held
off
on
some
hedging
for
next
year
assuming
prices
could
climb
even
higher
producers
have

lower

morgan
stanley
analysts
said
in
a
reason
why
supply
might
not
actually
be
severely
curtailed
despite
low
prices
is
that
shale
companies
could
simply
keep
up
their
pace
of
drilling
in
and
take
on
more
debt
just
as
they
did
for
so
many
years
the

change

provides
some
more
insight
with
a
look
at
the
rate
of
well
completions
we
estimate
that
completions
per
month
are
currently
required
in
the
permian
to
offset
declines
the
number
of
permian
completions
in
november
was
higher
than
the
breakeven
completion
rate
at
the
investment
bank
wrote
in
a
note
the
number
of
completions
would
then
have
to
fall
about
before
permian
output
stopped
growing
while
we
expect
a
slowdown
in
completions
if
the
price
of
wti
in
midland
texas
were
to
remain
close
to
the
current
usd
we
would
not
expect
a
fall
in
completions
large
enough
to
halt
net
finally
oil
might
not
be
a
huge
problem
if

prices
rebound

relatively
near
future

we

i
can
tell
you
we
will
achieve
balance
between
supply
and

in

told

there
will
be
enormous
pressure
on
to
extend
the

stick
around
the
more
significant
the
impact
will
be
on
production
if
strip
prices
remain
subdued
into

at
around
wti
we
would
expect
budgets
to
be
set
at
levels
that
reduce
the
trend
rate
of

all
else
equal
which
we
would
expect
to
become
more
