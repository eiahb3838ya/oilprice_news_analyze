india finds way to skirt u.s. sanctions against iran
india
will
use
five
escrow
accounts
in
iranian
banks
to
pay
for
deliveries
of
iranian
crude
oil
amid
sanctions

reports
citing
sources
close
to
the
situation
the
accounts
are
in
the
name
of
state
indian
lender
uco
payments
will
be
made
in
indian
rupees
in
a
bid
to
avoid
punitive
action
from
washington
the
sources
also
said
also
the
deposits
are
spread
across
five
banks
to
reduce
risk
in
case
washington
decides
to
add
more
iranian
banks
to
its
sanction
we
already
have
iranian
bank
accounts
out
of
these
five
have
come
under
secondary
sanctions
the
managing
director
of
uco
bank
said
yesterday
he
also
said
however
the
other
are
still
good
to
use
for
bilateral
according
to
the
bloomberg
sources
will
use
the
money
to
cover
the
expenses
of
its
diplomatic
missions
in
india
and
to
buy
essential
information
should
not
come
as
a
surprise
despite
the
united
states
efforts
to
distance
india
from
iran
and
wean
it
off
its
oil
one
of
the
world
s
top
consumers
of
crude
imports
almost
percent
of
the
oil
it
guzzles
and
it
is
extremely
vulnerable
to
price
shocks
so
iranian
crude
remains
vital
for
the
price
of
the
oil
it
buys
is
of
the
utmost
importance
iran
s
favorable
credit
terms
and
lower
prices
are
certainly
an
attractive
alternative
to
a
long
and
difficult
process
of
finding
of
the
commodity
despite
higher
intake
of
saudi
and
oil
completely
replacing
iranian
crude
has
proven
more
than
just
recognition
of
the
fact
washington
granted
india
along
with
another
seven
large
iran
oil
importers
a
waiver
from
the
sanctions
with
the
caveat
these
importers
were
expected
to
reduce
their
intake
of
iranian
crude
