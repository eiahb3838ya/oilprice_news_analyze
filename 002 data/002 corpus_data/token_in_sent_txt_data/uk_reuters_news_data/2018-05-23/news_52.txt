update 1-u.s. iran strategy reinforces conservatives, endangers region -france
paris reuters the decision to scrap the iran nuclear deal and implement a tough strategy on the country will strengthen tehran s hardliners and endanger the region as a whole france s foreign minister said on wednesday
le drian was speaking two days after secretary of state mike pompeo said washington would impose the strongest sanctions in history if iran did not curb its regional influence and limit its ballistic missile programme
we disagree with the method because this collection of sanctions which will be set up against iran will not enable dialogue and on the contrary it will reinforce the conservatives and weaken president hassan rouhani
this posture risks endangering the region more le drian told france inter radio
he said paris shared washington s concerns over iran s ballistic missile frenzy and regional hegemonic ambitions but that the nuclear deal was the best chance of stopping tehran developing a nuclear bomb
deputy foreign ministers of the remaining parties to the accord britain china france germany and russia will meet their iranian counterpart on friday in vienna
the meeting will assess what can be done to keep the deal and circumvent extraterritorial american sanctions that are already impacting foreign business appetite for iran
european companies say they are worried about getting caught up in the new sanctions given the extent of washington s global reach and some have already started pulling out
we have another problem which is the security of our companies and the capacity to give iran the economic benefits that it can expect in return for giving up on nuclear weapons le drian said
these sanctions are not acceptable
