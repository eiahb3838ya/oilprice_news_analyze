in vote of confidence, oil firms mop up new north sea blocks
london reuters the uk oil and gas authority oga on wednesday awarded licences to companies to explore for and develop new fields in the north sea in the latest sign of confidence in the ageing basin that has enjoyed a revival in recent years
companies ranging from royal dutch shell rdsal bp and norway s equinor to smaller independents including siccar point chrysaor and premier oil were awarded blocks covering a total area of square km the oga said in a statement
the oga expects this round to lead very quickly to activity providing a welcome boost to exploration it said
fourteen of those licences are expected to progress straight to field development planning it said
the round could unlock about a dozen undeveloped discoveries containing an estimated million barrels of oil equivalent boe it added
the north sea was one of the world s first offshore basins and has produced oil for more than four decades
although output in the basin has sharply declined since peaking in the late it has seen a revival in recent years after large projects such as the quad in the western shetlands came on line
the oga estimates the north sea holds reserves of billion boe
the oga s first mature licensing round following the norwegian model appears to have been a great success wood mackenzie analyst kevin swann said in a note
the uk is in desperate need of new projects to fill a development pipeline that is all but empty beyond the early swann said
the eight firm exploration wells among the awards with big companies like shell bp equinor and conocophillips among those set to drill is a big vote of confidence in the uk
it shows the big players are not ready to leave uk waters reporting by ron bousso editing by dale hudson and amanda cooper
