in power hungry philippines, some advocate a nuclear revival
energy ministry seeks duterte help to tap nuclear energy philippines has the only nuclear plant in southeast asia completed in after cost blowout plant was never used country s power demand expected to triple by by manolo serapio jr and enrico dela cruz morong may reuters filipino wilfredo torres was hired as a technician for southeast asia s only nuclear power plant in the but has spent the past decade giving guided tours at the facility
the philippines splashed out billion on the bataan nuclear power plant but mothballed it after the collapse of a dictatorship and the devastating chernobyl disaster
now there s a chance that torres might get to see the plant in action before he retires in four years
as power demand soars in one of the world s economies the philippines energy ministry is looking seriously again at nuclear power and urging president rodrigo duterte to its revival
there s still a few of us who have been here from the start who are hoping to see the plant running before we retire said torres during a tour of the facility nearly miles northwest of manila
the department of energy has asked duterte for an executive order declaring the philippines ready for a nuclear power programme said gerardo erguiza energy assistant secretary
with the need for cheaper reliable power nuclear is ideal erguiza told reuters
it s a template in successful previous attempts to pursue nuclear energy in the philippines have failed due to safety concerns and because central to the plan is the revival of the bataan plant built during dictator ferdinand marcos rule
marcos ordered the bataan nuclear plant built in in response to an energy crisis convinced nuclear energy was the solution to the middle east oil embargo of the early
completed in the government mothballed it two years later following marcos ouster and the deadly chernobyl nuclear disaster
from the government opened the plant to tourists for a fee helping defray the cost of maintaining it along with an annual state budget that this year was million philippine pesos
while reopening the bataan plant is an option so is building a new nuclear facility said erguiza acknowledging the former will open up so many wounds after costs came in more than four times the initial budget
coal fuels half of the philippines power grid with natural gas and renewables each accounting for over a fifth and oil the rest
with an economy growing as fast as china s at percent in the first quarter manila expects energy consumption to triple to mw by
by tapping nuclear where upfront investment is high but fuel costs are lower electricity costs will drop said carlo arcilla director of the philippine nuclear research institute
the biggest issue in the philippines is that we have one of the most expensive power in the world he said
philippine power rates which are not were ranked the most expensive out of countries surveyed in a study commissioned by power retailer manila electric co
japan topped the list
nuclear reactor builders korea hydro nuclear power co ltd and russia s rosatom submitted plans last year to rehabilitate the bataan plant at costs ranging from billion to more than billion said engineer mauro marcelo who oversaw the maintenance and preservation of the plant before he retired in march
other companies that have expressed interest include china s top nuclear power plant builder china nuclear engineering and construction and belgium s tractebel said marcelo
rehabilitating the bataan plant would be the shortest nuclear route for the philippines taking about five years all up versus about a decade for a new plant said marcelo
in my view the nuclear policy may be issued during duterte s term said marcelo
but to start the bataan plant i think it s still a long way to duterte has said safety will be his top consideration in deciding whether the country will pursue nuclear energy
opposition to reviving manila s nuclear ambitions remains strong with advocates citing a reliance on imported uranium high waste and decommissioning costs as well as safety concerns
geologist kelvin rodolfo has repeatedly warned against the activation of the bataan plant saying it sits on an active earthquake fault that runs through a volcano currently dormant
a nuclear accident there would affect a much larger area than the philippines alone and so the philippines can not make the decision to activate it all by itself said rodolfo
he would like to see the international atomic energy agency iaea make that judgment
i have every confidence that they would not approve it rodolfo said
iaea director general yukiya amano met with philippine energy officials in february to discuss manila s possible nuclear plans
an iaea review mission to the philippines is planned later this year
in the wake of japan s fukushima disaster the number of construction starts of nuclear reactors dropped from a high of in to four last year all in asia according to the world nuclear industry status report
nuclear is very controversial and if we ever wanted to install it in the philippines it would not succeed without very strong intervention by the government said antonio moraza president of aboitiz power one of the country s biggest power producers
