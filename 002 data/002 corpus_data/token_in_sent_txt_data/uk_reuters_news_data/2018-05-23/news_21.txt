exclusive-large u.s. refiner marathon seeks biofuel hardship waiver - sources
reuters marathon petroleum corp the refining company in the united states has asked the environmental protection agency epa for a hardship waiver exempting one of its facilities from the nation s biofuels law two sources with knowledge of the application told reuters
the request comes as the epa expands its use of biofuel waivers in a way that has reduced regulatory costs for the oil industry by hundreds of millions of dollars in recent months but which has also infuriated the powerful corn lobby
epa has authority to grant waivers freeing small refineries from their obligation to mix biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel under the renewable fuel standard rfs if they can prove complying would cause them disproportionate economic the waivers can save individual facilities tens of millions of dollars in regulatory costs adding to a company s bottom line
marathon made the waiver application for one of its facilities for the calendar year according to the sources who asked not to be named
the sources did not specify which facility the waiver would cover and did not know whether epa had made a decision
marathon spokesman jamal kheiry declined to comment and epa spokesman jahan wilcox did not respond to requests for comment
marathon s smallest refinery is a barrel per day plant in canton ohio
while that plant has a nameplate capacity above the bpd threshold that epa uses for small refineries the facility could meet the criteria by operating at reduced rates
refineries typically bring down units at least once a year for maintenance work limiting production
it is also possible that marathon made the request for a portion of one of its larger refining complexes such as its galveston bay refinery in texas arguing that certain parts of the complex operate distinctly
an epa source said earlier this year that the agency has granted more than two dozen small refinery waivers for in recent months a level that former officials say is about triple the number given each year under previous administrations
the expanded use of biofuel waivers under president donald trump s administration has been a flashpoint between the oil and corn industries
while refining industry representatives have said epa is required to provide such exemptions to qualifying facilities republicans have said the program is being abused in a way that hurts corn farmers
republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said in an emailed statement that the move was a sign of how broken this process note to epa definition of hardship a condition that is difficult to endure suffering deprivation oppression grassley said separately on twitter
surely marathon doesn t qualify for a waiver they had a net income of in billions in profits isnt he and other lawmakers have pressed the epa to curb the exemptions and to name the companies that have received them
epa does not reveal the names of waiver applicants or recipients arguing the information is confidential
sources familiar with the matter have told reuters that large refiner andeavor and billionaire carl icahn s cvr energy were among the companies that had been granted waivers recently showing epa is willing to award exemptions to plants owned by big profitable companies
andeavor which recorded net profits of billion in said this month it saved million in costs from waivers
majors chevron corp and exxonmobil corp have also asked for relief for smaller units according to sources though it is unclear if their requests were granted
marathon which owns six refineries and sells gasoline through independent retailers and its speedway unit booked net income of billion in
it recently announced it is buying andeavor in a billion deal that would make it the nation s largest refiner
this is the theater of the absurd
marathon wants a small refinery hardship waiver at the very moment it is seeking to become the nation s largest refiner brooke coleman head of the advanced biofuels business council said
the federal government should be protecting consumers by scrutinizing mergers like this instead of handing out dividends to multibillion dollar oil companies seeking to monopolize critical energy prices of the biofuel blending credits that refiners need to prove compliance with the rfs known as renewable identification numbers rins have fallen to lows in recent weeks as the increase in hardship waivers has turned traditional buyers of credits into sellers
marathon has long called for a legislative overhaul of the rfs to ease the burden on refiners but began investing years ago in terminal blending capacity to help curb its rin expenses
chief financial officer and senior vice president timothy griffith in april told investors and analysts on a conference call that the costs associated with the rfs are incorporated into our trading and pricing decision and ultimately recovered and passed on to reporting by jarrett renshaw and chris prentice in new york editing by cynthia osterman and susan thomas
