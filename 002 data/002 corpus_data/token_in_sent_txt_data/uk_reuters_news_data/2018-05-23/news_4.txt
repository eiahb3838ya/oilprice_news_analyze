update 3-peru president cancels london-based tullow's offshore oil contracts
lima reuters the government of peruvian president martin vizcarra cancelled his predecessor s decision to award five offshore oil contracts to tullow oil plc shortly before resigning citing insufficient consultations with coastal residents
the reversal which was published in the official gazette on wednesday was a victory for fishermen and environmentalists who said that exploration and drilling would have put important fisheries and whale breeding grounds at risk
it was another setback for efforts to shore up slumping energy investments in peru a relatively small oil producer where past bidding rounds have failed to draw offers
tullow whose shares fell percent in london on wednesday said it would consider next the contracts came under fire after peruvians learned the disgraced former president pedro pablo kuczynski had signed five decrees authorizing them just before stepping down in march over graft allegations
despite kuczynski s approval the contracts themselves were never signed state energy promoter perupetro said
vizcarra s government said perupetro had negotiated the contracts directly with tullow without giving communities along peru s northern coast enough time to weigh in
we want a country that develops investments with peace and tranquility and that s done with a good start to a project prime minister cesar villanueva told a press conference
with this repeal we are not even remotely opposed to private investment villanueva added
since taking office vizcarra kuzynski s former vice president has distanced himself from his predecessor as he aims to strengthen ties with the congress and build grassroots support following peru s worst political crisis in nearly two decades
the revocation of kuczynski s decrees is deeply disappointing said george cazenove tullow s head of communications
tullow has complied with the process and procedures required under peruvian earlier this month the comptroller s office said it had found nothing illegal about the contracts but that the process of granting oil concessions through direct talks should be more transparent and give other stakeholders more say
critics said a public auction should have been held and a higher royalty rate should have been set
tullow had planned an initial investment of million million in the five blocks according to perupetro
the national society of mining petroleum and energy business association said the government had only created more uncertainty for investors in peru where oil imports cost the country billions of dollars per year
