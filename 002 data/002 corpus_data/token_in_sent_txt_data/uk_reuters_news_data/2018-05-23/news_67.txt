rpt-column-hedge funds trapped in near-term brent futures: kemp
repeats without change
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chart chart by john kemp london may reuters hedge funds are rolling forward long positions in the brent futures contract and in the absence of offsetting factors this is depressing the value of expiring contracts pushing futures prices into contango
since the end of june hedge funds and other money managers have built up a net long position in brent in the expectation that prices will continue to rise
hedge funds held long futures and options positions equivalent to almost million barrels on may according to position reports published by the intercontinental exchange
these were partially offset by short positions amounting to million barrels giving a net long of almost million barrels
fund managers also held million barrels of positions in the calendar spreads offsetting long and short positions in different contract months
some positions were held in the form of options but most were futures with a net long position in futures alone amounting to million barrels
for the brent contract as a whole the total number of open positions in futures across all maturities and all market participants was equivalent to million barrels
of all the open positions almost percent were concentrated in the first three contracts expiring in july million barrels august million barrels and september million barrels
unless the hedge fund positions were distributed very differently to other market participants a substantial number must have been held in the first three months
in fact many fund managers especially those following strategies have a strong preference for liquidity so they tend to hold their position in the closest and most liquid contract months
but as those contracts approach expiry positions must be rolled forward or allowed to terminate automatically with the passage of time
chart chart the rolling forward of long positions tends to push the front end of the futures curve from backwardation towards contango because they involve the simultaneous sale of a contract and purchase of one further forward
of course for every long position there is a short and the rolling of short positions tends to have the opposite effect pushing the market from contango towards backwardation
in theory the impact of rolling forward long and short positions should be neutral
in practice different groups of market participants employ different strategies and have a different impact on price formation
hedge funds and other money managers tend to be dynamic rather than passive because they trade on expectations of where prices will move in future
the sheer number of hedge fund long positions already established in the market and needing to be rolled forward each month is now weighing on prices at the front end of the curve
while fund managers were still accumulating net longs between june and march the negative impact on calendar spreads was masked by the amount of new buying each month
but hedge funds have been reducing their net position in brent since the middle of april
the net position has been cut by million barrels or percent since april
if the problem of rolled longs persists many more hedge funds are likely to try to escape it by shifting positions further along the curve towards contracts expiring in or
