update 2-saudi-led coalition foils houthi attacks on red sea ships, saudi and uae media say
dubai reuters a military coalition foiled attacks by speedboats deployed by yemen s houthi movement against commercial vessels including an oil tanker in the red sea saudi and emirati state media said on wednesday
united arab emirates uae state news agency wam reported that uae coalition forces had destroyed two boats which were threatening a commercial oil tanker in the red sea
two other houthi boats escaped it added
later saudi state news channel said that speedboats rigged with explosives had tried to attack three commercial vessels being escorted by two coalition warships but that coalition forces had foiled the attack and destroyed three speedboats
neither the houthis nor a coalition spokesman could immediately be reached for comment
saudi arabia the uae and sunni muslim allies have been fighting in yemen for three years against the houthis a shi ite group that controls much of north yemen including the capital sanaa and drove a government into exile in
the houthis who are aligned with the middle east s shi ite power iran have fired missiles into saudi arabia
the coalition has carried out a campaign of thousands of airstrikes and restricted imports into yemen worsening what the united nations says is potentially the world s worst humanitarian crisis
the coalition says one of the main justifications for its intervention is to protect shipping routes such as the red sea which is used to bring middle eastern oil and asian goods to europe through the suez canal
the saudi and emirati tv reports did not mention whether any of the ships had been damaged in the incident nor did they provide any identifying details about the commercial vessels
last month a saudi oil tanker was hit off yemen s main port city of hodeidah suffering limited damage in what coalition forces said was an attack by the houthis
the houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship
