woodside looks to speed up scarborough gas development off australia
melbourne may reuters australia s biggest liquefied natural gas lng producer woodside petroleum on wednesday outlined plans to accelerate and expand its scarborough gas project off northwestern australia now expected to cost billion
fresh from buying out exxonmobil corp to gain control over the scarborough field woodside is looking to start producing gas in two years earlier than previously flagged with lng production from an expanded pluto plant starting in
first gas would be piped to the north west shelf lng plant operated by woodside via a link from the pluto facility
this meant woodside would reap revenue on up to million tonnes of lng one year ahead of completing a second lng production unit at the pluto plant which would then handle scarborough gas
woodside also said it has increased the planned size of the second unit or train at pluto to million tonnes per annum mtpa which would double the plant s capacity
the original plan was for a second train that could produce mtpa
the expanded plant could take gas from other long stranded fields in the area which have substantial reserves but no way of getting the gas to market including fields owned by chevron corp and royal dutch shell
as operator of australia s biggest lng plant north west shelf lng as well as pluto lng woodside sees other companies relying on it to help them develop remote deepwater gas fields discovered over the past years to fill what is expected to be a gas supply gap opening up around as asian demand soars
that puts us really in a commanding position as we go forward in dealing with those owners woodside chief executive peter coleman said at the company s annual investor day
coleman said he was open to talking to other resource owners who could hook into woodside s pipelines and lng plants but they would need to talk to him by the third quarter of this year before the company starts design work on the scarborough project
they need to stop messing around and give me some offers coleman said
