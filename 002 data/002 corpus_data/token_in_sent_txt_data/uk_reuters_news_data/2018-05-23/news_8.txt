update 1-iran's top leader sets conditions for europe to save nuclear deal
adds detail london may reuters iran s top leader set out a series of conditions on wednesday for european powers if they want tehran to stay in a nuclear deal after the exit including steps by european banks to safeguard trade with tehran and guaranteeing iranian oil sales
president donald trump pulled out earlier this month from the nuclear deal that had lifted sanctions on iran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme
european powers see the accord as the best chance of stopping tehran acquiring a nuclear weapon and have intensified efforts to save it
european banks should safeguard trade with the islamic republic
we do not want to start a fight with these three countries france germany and britain but we don t trust them either iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei was quoted as saying by his website
khamenei also said european powers must promise they would not seek new negotiations on iran s ballistic missile programme and regional middle east activities adding europe should fully guarantee iran s oil sales
in case americans can damage our oil sales europeans should make up for that and buy iranian khamenei said that over the past two years the united states has repeatedly violated the nuclear deal but the europeans had remained silent
he asked europe to make up for that silence and to stand up against the khamenei accused the united states of violating security council resolution that underpins the nuclear agreement with iran and asked europe to secure a resolution against the violation
he warned that if the europeans did not meet these demands iran would resume its enrichment of uranium halted under the deal to minimise the risk of tehran developing the means to build nuclear weapons
