update 8-oil falls on shock u.s. stock builds, opec supply worries
new york reuters oil benchmarks fell on wednesday after an unexpected build in crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand and as traders weighed a possible increase in opec crude output to cover any shortfalls in supply from iran and venezuela
crude inventories rose million barrels last week while gasoline stocks increased by million barrels the energy information administration said
normally you don t see builds at this time of year
with memorial day weekend and summer driving season coming up we were expecting a draw
and getting a build and such a large build was surprising said tariq zahir managing member at tyche capital advisors
brent crude futures slipped cents to settle at a barrel while crude lost cents to a barrel
a build is kind of like a slap in the face where it s like where did this oil come from and as you look through the numbers it doesn t make a lot of sense said phil flynn analyst at price futures group in chicago
it is definitely a shock to the the increase in inventories came from a combination of reduced exports and rising imports
the latter is somewhat surprising flynn said because brent crude is trading at more than a premium to crude making exports more attractive
indeed sinopec asia s largest refiner will boost crude oil imports to an high as china tries to reduce its trade deficit with the united states two sources with knowledge of the matter said
oil prices have gained nearly percent this year driven primarily by coordinated supply cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and partners including russia
opec may decide to raise oil output as soon as june as venezuelan output collapses sanctions against iran loom and after washington raised concerns that the oil rally was going too far opec and oil industry sources familiar with the discussions told reuters
it does seem like any move above attracts selling interest right now and that could potentially lead us to a period of consolidation where i think or even might be in focus saxo bank senior manager ole hansen said
prices have also been affected by rising geopolitical tensions that could dent global output just as demand is set to hit million barrels per day in the final quarter of this year according to the international energy agency
