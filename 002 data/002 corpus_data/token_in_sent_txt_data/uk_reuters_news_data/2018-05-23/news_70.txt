preview-trump factor leaves macron scrambling ahead of russia trip
macron makes visit to russia for putin talks tensions between play into putin s hands macron wants progress in talks on iran syria ukraine by john irish and michel rose paris may reuters emmanuel macron heads to st petersburg on thursday seeking to win concessions from vladimir putin but with ties strained over iran the russian leader may have little incentive to offer the french president a diplomatic success
a year after hosting putin in the regal halls of the chateau de versailles macron wants to find common ground on syria and ukraine during his visit while opening a broader dialogue on iran after president donald trump s withdrawal from the nuclear deal
the weakness of the transatlantic relationship does not give macron sufficiently strong positions to counter putin said tatiana director of the russia centre at the institute for international relations
putin knows that there are differences in the western camp and as soon as someone shows weakness he exploits macron has bet on nurturing relationships with leaders such as putin to appear engaged but trying to mediate among the sides without unsettling anyone
that policy is now being tested after trump shunned his closest allies and slapped on extraterritorial sanctions on iran having already pulled out of the global climate pact and threatened the eu with tariffs on metals
the move has left paris london and berlin scrambling to salvage the nuclear deal knowing full well that their interests are not necessarily aligned with the two remaining signatories russia and china
macron hopes to entice all sides into a grand bargain that would tackle iran s nuclear programme and also address fears over its ballistic missile activity and regional influence as a means to bringing the united states back into the fold
a lot needs to be done to convince the russians because it has interests in the middle east especially syria and its stance towards the west is aggressive said a senior french diplomat
rather than directly confronting putin publicly macron has emphasised private dialogue while pushing for a restoration of business and cultural ties despite existing european union sanctions on moscow
invited as guest of honour to an economic forum that will be attended by the likes of french oil major total macron will on friday at least trumpet improved trade ties that have seen french exports steadily recover after a drop in
but the strategy as a whole has shown its limits
over the last year moscow has not altered its positions in syria where it continues to back president bashar militarily or in ukraine where just last week putin again excluded ever restoring annexed crimea
yet even after britain accused russia of orchestrating a attack on its soil further souring ties macron has continued to stress that despite differences ostracising moscow would not yield results
i felt the eagerness of this dynamic young and ambitious man to quickly find concrete solutions but alas in life it is a little more complicated
the solution in syria as in ukraine depends not only on us or the french but other actors former russian ambassador to france alexander orlov told reuters
but nevertheless there is this positive approach on the part of president macron and he is ready to cooperate with russia to find few see any likelihood of a breakthrough on the ukraine crisis
however french diplomats hope that the potential for a direct confrontation between israel and iran in syria and the lack of a political transition process in the country will encourage putin to yield some ground
but highlighting just how macron s efforts have been he sent at least two letters to putin one last summer and one at the end of the year outlining concrete areas in which he believed putin could pressure assad to ease humanitarian access in the country
neither drew clear responses
beyond france s prestige and commercial opportunities an effective french diplomacy must ask what levers it can use recalcitrant actors said jalel harchaoui a geopolitics researcher at paris university
it seems this basic question is no longer being asked in paris
