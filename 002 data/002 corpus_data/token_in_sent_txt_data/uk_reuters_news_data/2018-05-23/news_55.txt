refile-explainer-drilling down: risky hunt for oil in vietnam's south china sea blocks
refiles to remove extraneous xxx in bullet points rosneft wary of beijing backlash for drilling of vietnam block drilling projects inside beijing s line highly contentious china seen unlikely to pressure russia over drilling by james pearson and greg torode kong may reuters some oil blocks off vietnam s sprawling coastline fall within an area of the south china sea demarcated by china s line the basis for beijing s controversial claims to most of the waterway
last week sources said rosneft vietnam bv a unit of russian state oil firm rosneft was concerned its recent drilling in one such block could upset beijing
that prompted vietnam s foreign ministry to assert the blocks are entirely under vietnamese sovereignty and jurisdiction and a warning from beijing to respect its sovereign rights
in march vietnam halted an oil drilling project in the nearby red emperor block following pressure from china
the red emperor incident was a blow to vietnam s upstream sector and the government s bid to develop the offshore oil and gas resources that it is legally entitled to under the un convention on the law of the sea according to analysis by risk analysts verisk maplecroft
the area is important for vietnam s economic development
vietnam oil gas group or petrovietnam made up percent of vietnam s gdp and percent of hanoi s total budget revenue from
vietnam has between billion and billion tonnes of crude oil and gas reserves in the waters according to petrovietnam which currently produces million tonnes of oil equivalent a year from the blocks
according to consultancy firm wood mackenzie if china s nine dashes were connected as one continuous line it would bisect or incorporate of vietnam s oil blocks
four of those blocks are currently producing with others at varying stages of exploration or development according to wood mackenzie
china s claims in the south china sea overlap the exclusive economic zones of vietnam the philippines malaysia and brunei
despite fierce diplomatic objections by beijing the philippines sought a ruling in against china in an arbitration case brought under the un s convention of the law of sea
the five international judges handed manila a sweeping victory which dismissed china s claims and removed any legal basis for beijing to create a network of linked territorial and economic seas under its control legal experts said
chinese officials who refused to participate in the case dismissed it as a farce and have continued to insist on jurisdiction over most of the waterway although they have not yet defined the line as a continuous one
china and other claimants have previously discussed joint development of energy projects in disputed waters but have been scuppered by issues over sovereignty
last month the philippines said it was looking to seal a pact with china within a few months to jointly explore for oil and gas in waters claimed by both countries
but while china has been ambiguous about precisely what it claims the waters around vietnam s southeastern oil fields have long been a
beijing has often attempted to thwart activity through backroom diplomatic threats and at times pressure at sea
those backroom threats were particularly acute in and after which firm exxonmobil corp refused to bow to pressure but british oil giant bp and others withdrew from some blocks
china s reaction to rosneft s drilling will be quite a test of just how far beijing is willing to go said ian storey a south china sea expert at singapore s iseas yusof ishak institute
this is a means for china to try to comprehensively trash in a practical way the legal ruling against its claims by the arbitral tribunal back in at the same time beijing and moscow had an understanding that they don t challenge each others core interests including the south china sea he said
both vietnamese and foreign diplomats have described hanoi s efforts to lure foreign firms as part of a strategy to counter chinese pressure by internationalising the south china sea dispute
in may and june hanoi lodged formal protests over the actions of chinese civilian vessels interfering with seismic survey ships at one point cutting sonar cables towed from a ship exploring on contract to petrovietnam
tensions spiked in may as rival coastguard and fishing fleets clashed at sea in ramming and blocking actions after the chinese national offshore oil corporation cnooc moved a large deepwater rig to drill test wells in exploration blocks off the vietnamese central coast
it later withdrew amid large scale protests and riots in vietnam
vietnam s crude oil production that year was million tonnes according to its general statistics office
by its crude oil output had fallen to million tonnes a decrease of percent
in april petrovietnam said maritime tensions with china will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities in making the rosneft drilling particularly important
it was partnership with russia under which vietnam began exploiting its oil reserves
with both vietnam s gold star and moscow s hammer and sickle in its logo the petroleum joint venture vietsovpetro was created in
vietsovpetro began to explore vietnam s continental shelf and discovered the country s first oil field bach ho in
unlike other nations russian oil concerns in the region appear to have been largely left alone said southeast asia analyst anton tsvetov of the independent centre for strategic research
it was unlikely that beyond official rhetoric china would directly pressure either rosneft or the russian government over the latest vietnamese drilling tsvetov said
there is a strong relationship between china and russia right now and energy issues are high on the agenda so i think it would be highly unusual for the chinese to cause a problem for such a large russian oil reporting by james pearson in hanoi and greg torode in hong kong
