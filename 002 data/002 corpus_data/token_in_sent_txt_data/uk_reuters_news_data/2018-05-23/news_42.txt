analysis-iranian officials split over response to u.s. demands
ankara reuters for all of iran s fierce verbal response to fresh threats of tougher sanctions some senior officials in tehran believe the door to diplomacy should stay open
on monday secretary of state mike pompeo presented a list of sweeping demands for iran including abandoning nuclear enrichment its ballistic missile programme and its role in syria lebanon and yemen or face the strongest sanctions in history
four senior iranian officials contacted by reuters interpreted pompeo s remarks as a bargaining strategy similar to washington s approach to north korea
last year officials were pressing for tougher sanctions against pyongyang and sent an aircraft carrier to the region in a show of strength before relations eased to a point where president donald trump may hold talks with north korean leader kim jong un
america does not want to get involved in another war in the region
iran also can not afford more economic hardship always there is a way to reach a compromise said one of the iranian officials who was involved in iran s nuclear talks with major powers for two years
the era of military confrontations is over the official said
like others giving their views on relations with the united states the official asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter
however it will be difficult for iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei to back any diplomatic solution because doing so could undermine his credibility among his hardline power base who reject any detente with the west
they americans are lying
even if iran accepts all these demands they will continue to demand more
their aim is changing iran s regime said one official who is close to khamenei s camp
americans can never be trusted
we don t give a damn to their threats and sanctions he said echoing khamenei s public statements
pompeo s speech did not explicitly call for a change in leadership in iran but he urged the iranian people to reject their clerical rulers
earlier this month the united states withdrew from a multinational deal which restricted iran s nuclear programme in return for lifting sanctions that had crippled the economy
tehran says its right to nuclear capabilities and its defensive missile programme are
but with iran s economy so fragile weakened by decades of sanctions corruption and mismanagement khamenei may yet consider diplomacy over confrontation with the united states
some insiders said that though difficult he could drink the cup of poison as his predecessor ayatollah ruhollah khomeini described it when he reluctantly agreed to a truce that ended the war
for most iranians the economy is the main issue not what iran does in the region or the country s nuclear programme said a senior western diplomat in tehran
that is why iranian leaders will show some flexibility despite the harsh it was iran s weak economy that forced khamenei to give tentative backing for the nuclear agreement with major powers
the deal engineered by pragmatist president hassan rouhani ended the country s economic and political isolation
the establishment s core support comes from iranians who joined protests in january
the unrest was a reminder to authorities that they were vulnerable to popular anger fuelled by economic hardship
if they fail to manage the economy then the regime will not be able to resist the pressure
it does not mean it will fall apart but the economy could reach its worst ever breaking point said meir javedanfar an expert on iran at the interdisciplinary center herzliya in israel
european parties to the nuclear deal are trying to rescue it after washington s exit by keeping iranian oil trade and investment flowing
but they concede it will be difficult
a third iranian official said he expected that the united states would eventually have to accept some level of iranian uranium enrichment activity and ballistic missile work because these are iran s red lines
in his speech pompeo tried to quash talk of war by saying washington would lift punishing sanctions it is now moving to impose restore diplomatic and commercial ties and allow iran to have access to advanced technology if washington saw tangible shifts in iran s policies
several iranian officials told reuters that the hardline elite including iran s revolutionary guard corps irgc viewed pompeo s demands as a declaration of war against iran
analysts said the risk of a broader conflict could not be ruled out despite running counter to trump s own stated desire to disentangle the united states from a generation of costly conflicts in the middle east
if americans push iran to the corner then iran will have no other option but to react harshly said analyst saeed leylaz
this is what hawks while tehran has said it would respond to any military aggression by targeting interests in the region and israel some experts said the country would struggle to defend itself against a direct attack
iran has done well in proxy wars but they can not confront israel or the in a direct war said the western diplomat
they don t have modern shi ite muslim iran backs president bashar in syria s civil war shi ite militias in iraq houthi rebels in yemen s conflict and lebanon s hezbollah movement
washington s regional allies sunni gulf arab states and israel staunch foes of tehran have all praised the united states toughening stance on iran
