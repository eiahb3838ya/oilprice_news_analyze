china's independent refiners embrace old friend fuel oil as taxes, rising crude, bite margins
beijing may reuters china s independent oil refiners are once again using fuel oil to feed their plants as stricter tax enforcement and rising crude oil prices have squeezed their margins
these independent refiners nicknamed teapots buy nearly of china s crude imports and any reduction in their crude purchases would cap demand in what is now the world s biggest oil importer
two independent refiners based in the eastern province of shandong home to most of china s teapots have each bought an tonne cargo of fuel oil srfo cargo together totalling about million barrels for april and may delivery according to three traders with knowledge of the deals
one cargo is arriving from abu dhabi and the other from singapore said one of the sources an executive with a western trader involved in the supply talks
the independents had primarily used fuel oil the residue left after crude oil has been initially distilled in a refinery as a feedstock for their plants since it cost less than crude oil and was taxed less
however in the chinese government raised taxes on fuel oil imports
but that was followed in by teapots winning licences to import crude
fuel oil consumption slumped as the refiners bought crude oil which yielded a higher volume of products such as gasoline and diesel than the srfo when processed and boosted profit margins for the teapots
china remained a large buyer of cracked fuel oil as fuel for ships
however starting on march beijing enacted new tax rules that more rigidly enforced on the teapots the collection of a per barrel gasoline consumption tax and per barrel tax on diesel
combined with a recent surge in crude oil prices to their highest since the higher tax collection has crushed the independent s margins
that has prompted the renewed interest in fuel oil
buying srfo may not necessarily save tax cost as the buyer needs to pay the fuel oil consumption tax but obviously plants are exploring the old trade as the government s tax stick is really a hard one this time said the oil trading executive
processing the srfo does have an added tax benefit however
the independents can deduct the tax of about per barrel paid on their fuel oil imports from the consumption tax they are required to collect on their gasoline and diesel sales said an official with an independent plant seeking fuel oil
processing fuel oil gives better margins than refining crude oil as plants can get tax deducted when selling refined fuel later the official said
the source who declined to be named as he is not authorized to talk to press added that his plant expected margins to be negative if they only processed crude oil
the lower margins have resulted in the teapots cutting their run rates
in early may the independent refiners operated at only percent of their processing capacity the lowest since february during the lunar new year break according to a weekly survey of plants by consultancy sublime china information
planned maintenance was also a factor said gao lei an analyst with sublime
we ve seen less impact from the tax measures on import volumes as plants increase runs but more on teapot margins said tee of consultancy sia energy they are definitely making less money now than additional reporting by roslan khasawaneh and florence tan in singapore editing by christian schmollinger
