ship carrying wheat to yemen hit by missile - eu navy force
london reuters a turkish vessel carrying wheat to yemen this month was hit by a rocket or missile and more attacks on merchant ships are likely due to a spillover of the conflict a senior european naval official said on wednesday
the turkish flagged ince inebolu bulk carrier was damaged by an explosion on may some miles off the red sea port of salif where it was due to deliver a tonne cargo of russian wheat
the assessment at the moment is it was almost certainly yemen based actors firing a missile or rocket at the vessel major tom mobbs head of intelligence and security with the european union s counter piracy mission eu navfor told reuters
it has sharpened the focus in our mind with this saudi arabia the united arab emirates and sunni muslim allies have been fighting in yemen for three years against the houthis a shi ite group that controls much of north yemen including the capital sanaa and drove a government into exile in
the houthis who are aligned with the middle east s shi ite power iran have fired missiles into saudi arabia
the coalition has carried out a campaign of thousands of airstrikes and restricted imports into yemen worsening what the united nations says is potentially the world s worst humanitarian crisis
mobbs declined to comment on whether the attack on the turkish ship was carried out by houthis adding that is the natural speculation
the ship s owner ince shipping group said in an emailed statement to reuters that the vessel had been hit by an unidentified missile while she was waiting for coalition forces to give clearance to proceed to the port
mobbs said international merchant shipping was unlikely to be deliberately targeted
clearly the events show the risk of misidentification and collateral damage he said in the sidelines of the launch of a report by the group oceans beyond piracy
the coalition says one of the main justifications for its intervention is to protect shipping routes through the narrow bab waterway which connects the red sea with the gulf of aden and the arabian sea through which nearly million barrels of oil are shipped daily to europe the united states and asia plus commercial goods
saudi and emirati state media said on wednesday that the coalition had foiled attacks in the red sea by speedboats deployed by houthis against commercial vessels including an oil tanker
last month a saudi oil tanker was hit off yemen s main port city of hodeidah suffering limited damage in what coalition forces said was an attack by the houthis
the houthis said they had targeted a coalition warship
the worsening situation prompted the international shipping industry in january to issue guidance to mariners of the multiple threats including missiles sea mines and improvised explosives devices
the same set of circumstances that are prompting these attacks are unlikely to go away certainly in the near future
so the attacks will continue mobbs said
