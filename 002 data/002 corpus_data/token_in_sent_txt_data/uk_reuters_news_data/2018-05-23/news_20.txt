update 3-china's sinopec to boost u.s. crude imports to all-time high -sources
singapore reuters sinopec asia s largest refiner will boost crude oil imports to an high as china tries to reduce its trade deficit with the united states two sources with knowledge of the matter said on wednesday
the company s trading arm unipec has bought million barrels or about barrels per day bpd of crude to load in june they said the largest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company
the government has encouraged us to lift more crude one of the sources said
sinopec could not immediately be reached for comment
china has pledged to buy more goods to reduce the huge trade deficit with the united states and help ease the threat of a trade war between the world s two biggest economies
energy and commodities are high on washington s list of products for sale
unipec s june oil purchases would be worth about billion at current prices
they would represent a notable increase in china s imports of crude which have averaged about barrels a day for the period ended in february according to energy department data
an arbitrage opportunity has also opened up after crude futures recorded the widest discount in three years against brent at a barrel last week enabling unipec to boost imports to replace more expensive middle east oil
washington is keen to sell more of the country s surging oil and gas production
however energy exports can grow only gradually due to infrastructure bottlenecks and only if oil gas and other goods remain attractively priced compared with global competition
we want to buy more but they might not be able to export more because of infrastructure constraints in the gulf coast a source said
the united states exported a record million bpd of crude oil in the week ended may and analysts estimate the country s limit is somewhere between million and million bpd
however reaching that level would be a stretch because only one terminal the louisiana offshore oil port loop is equipped to handle the very large crude carriers vlccs that transit many asian ports the loop only started testing vlccs for export in february
whenever we talk about these numbers the issues are not just of pure dock capacity
for china the more important issue for them is the size of vessel that you can load
of all of the main regions where loading is occurring none can load a vlcc directly said sandy fielden director of research in commodities and energy at morningstar
also china prefers a heavier quality of crude whereas the bulk of oil exports is light crude the source said
