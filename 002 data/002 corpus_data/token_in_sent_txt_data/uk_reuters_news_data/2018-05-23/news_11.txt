update 2-new jersey governor signs nuclear power subsidy bill into law
reuters new jersey governor phil murphy signed several legislative initiatives on wednesday to advance the state s clean energy goals including a controversial bill that would subsidize the continued operation of nuclear power plants
the new nuclear law which could cost about million a year establishes a zero emissions certificate zec program to maintain new jersey s nuclear energy supply which contributes close to percent of the state s electric capacity and is by far its largest source of carbon free energy
plants seeking to participate in the program would be required among other things to demonstrate that they make a significant contribution to new jersey air quality and are at risk of closure within three years
the four reactors operating in new jersey are capable of generating over megawatts mw of electricity
three are located at the creek nuclear plant and are operated by a unit of public service enterprise group inc the state s biggest power company
one megawatt can power about homes
the other reactor oyster creek is owned by exelon corp which also owns part of the salem reactors
exelon plans to shut oyster creek in october under a agreement with the state
exelon commends new jersey governor phil murphy by signing into law a package of legislation that will help to preserve percent of new jersey s power protect jobs and save residents and businesses million on their electric bills exelon said in a statement
pseg has warned that it could shut its reactors if they do not receive some sort of federal or state assistance
nuclear operators have shut several reactors over the past five years and plan to close more as cheap natural gas from shale fields has depressed power prices making it uneconomic for generators to keep operating some nuclear plants
the new law makes new jersey the fourth state after new york illinois and connecticut to adopt a program to provide a new revenue stream to keep nuclear reactors in service to help meet the states greenhouse gas reduction goals
other states with reactors set to retire over the next few years for economic reasons like pennsylvania and ohio and officials in the energy department are also looking at programs to keep nuclear plants operating
in new jersey murphy also signed legislation requiring percent of the state s power come from renewable sources by a plan to build mw of offshore wind by a plan to implement energy efficiency programs to reduce electric and gas usage and a plan to achieve mw of energy storage by
the governor also signed an executive order directing state agencies to develop an energy master plan by june that provides a path to percent clean energy by
these new laws will preserve and create jobs and spur billions of dollars in investment in clean energy and energy efficiency across the state ralph izzo chief executive officer of pseg said in a statement
but not everyone is happy with the new nuclear subsidy including the state s ratepayer advocate the sierra club aarp and several power generators that would benefit if the nuclear reactors were to close
this bill package will mean new jersey stays hooked on nuclear power at the expense of renewables like solar and wind
it will essentially block our efforts to get to percent renewable energy and will lead to a crash in our solar market said jeff tittel director of the new jersey sierra club in a statement
