but president donald trump indicated on wednesday that negotiations were still short of his objectives when he said any deal would need a different structure
china is the world s top importer of both oil and soy and already buys significant volumes of both from the united states
it is unclear how much more chinese importers will buy from the united states than they would have otherwise but any additional shipments would contribute to cutting the trade surplus as demanded by trump
