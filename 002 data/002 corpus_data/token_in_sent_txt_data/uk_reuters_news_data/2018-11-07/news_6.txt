update 2-return to oil production cuts in 2019 cannot be ruled out - opec sources
london reuters a return to oil production cuts by opec and its allies next year can not be ruled out two opec sources said on wednesday to avert a possible supply glut that could weigh on prices
the sources were responding to a report by russia s tass news agency that russia and saudi arabia had started bilateral discussions over possible curbs to output in
opec and its allies including russia decided in june to relax output curbs in place since after pressure from president donald trump to reduce oil prices and make up for supply losses from iran
asked whether discussions pointed to a return to supply cuts in one of the two sources who are delegates from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said certainly not the other way oil prices have come under downward pressure from rising supplies even though iranian exports are expected to fall because of new sanctions
forecasts of a supply surplus and slowing demand have also dented the market
brent crude had dropped from a high in october above a barrel to on tuesday
prices rallied back above on wednesday supported by the tass report
separately a top opec official from iran which has been angered by higher production in saudi arabia and russia in response to trump s calls said riyadh and moscow needed to cut output by million barrels per day
there is no other way for saudi arabia and russia hossein kazempour ardebili who represents iran on opec s board of governors told reuters when asked whether producers needed to trim output in
the extra supply has caused a drop in crude prices hurting income for other oil producers while helping iran s foe trump in the midterm elections kazempour said
they pushed the prices a barrel lower in one month and only made gasoline cheaper for trump
they lost billions on revenue and caused losses to poor producers in africa and south america he said
a ministerial committee of some opec members and allies meets on sunday in abu dhabi to discuss the market and outlook for
iran is not a member of this committee which it wants scrapped
this group called the jmmc could make a recommendation on output policy to the next meeting of opec and oil ministers a third opec source said
that meeting takes place on in vienna
any serious discussion will be towards the december meeting this source said
