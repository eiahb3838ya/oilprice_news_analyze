update 3-voters in 3 u.s. states reject initiatives to curb fossil fuel use
reuters voters in colorado arizona and washington states rejected ballot initiatives that sought to curb fossil fuels use by restricting drilling putting a fee on carbon emissions and mandating wider use of renewable energy

the outcomes showed voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive said thomas pyle president of free market advocacy group american energy alliance
while polls had indicated rising concerns among americans over carbon emissions and water quality the measures on the ballot in the three states to rein in fossil fuels industries were soundly rejected on election day on tuesday
in colorado an initiative to limit new drilling near populated or vulnerable areas which would have heavily curtailed the industry received percent of the vote less than the majority required to pass
the washington state measure meanwhile which would have imposed the nation s first fee on carbon emissions mostly at the expense of the state s oil refiners garnered only percent of the vote
groups defending the oil industry spent a combined million to defeat the colorado and washington measures with much of the contributions coming from large energy companies including bp plc and marathon oil corp unit andeavor

washington state s measure was supported by millions of dollars in contributions from microsoft bill gates and an alliance of other billionaires and environmental groups
ted halstead head of the climate leadership council an group proposing a nationwide carbon tax said the defeat of the washington state carbon fee highlights the need for a popular and politically viable approach to carbon pricing at the federal a tax or fee is intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
in arizona voters defeated a proposal backed by billionaire activist thomas steyer that would have required electricity providers to use renewable energy for half of their needs by up from the current percent
the measure was opposed by arizona public service co the state s largest utility which argued it would be forced to shut coal and nuclear plants and pass along those costs to customers
a similar measure backed by steyer in nevada passed
on wednesday steyer said the failure in arizona was due to the way the measure was described on the ballot implying the change could drive up costs for consumers and which had been written by the state s republican attorney general
what we saw in terms of the ballot initiatives is that americans in purple states support clean energy overwhelmingly as long as you are allowed to talk honestly about it steyer said referring to states where the democratic and republican parties have similar levels of support
shares in oil producers operating in colorado rallied on wednesday after the state s proposed drilling restrictions failed
anadarko petroleum corp gained percent and noble energy inc jumped percent

colorado s proposal would have required new oil wells to be at least feet m five times the current minimum separation from occupied or sensitive areas effectively placing much of the state to new drilling
we are going to keep fighting russell mendell of group colorado rising which backed the measure said on wednesday
but opponents including colorado municipal officials warned that the measure would have cost the state s economy billions of dollars and would have reduced funding for roads schools and public safety
