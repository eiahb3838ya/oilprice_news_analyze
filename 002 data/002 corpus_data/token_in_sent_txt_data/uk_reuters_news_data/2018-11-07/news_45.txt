factbox-the knowns and unknowns of u.s. iran oil sanction waivers
nov reuters the united states on monday sanctions against iran s oil exports to punish tehran for its involvement in several middle eastern conflicts
washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of iranian oil to zero
but fearing a crude oil price spike it granted iran s biggest buyers china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey sanctions waivers
that will allow the eight which account for about percent of all iran s oil exports according to trade data to import at least some oil for another days
washington and the recipients of the waivers have not disclosed how much oil they are allowed to import or under what conditions deals can still be made
analysts have estimated the overall volumes allowed under the waivers at between and million barrels per day bpd compared with a peak of around million bpd in iranian crude and condensate exports in
morgan said the lack or difficulty in acquiring shipping insurance will help in reducing exports quickly as they did during last international the bank also said payments for the oil by the exempt countries must go into escrow accounts in their local currency and that this means the money won t directly go to iran and it can only be used to buy certain goods from its crude export once the waivers expire after days new waivers are expected to be issued with a source in china saying his country would likely receive another six months of exemptions though at a lower rate of around bpd
see below further details that have begun to emerge
china the world s biggest importer of crude oil is also the top buyer of iranian oil and its mostly refiners have lobbied hard for waivers
several chinese sources with knowledge of the matter said china would be allowed to buy bpd of iranian crude during the exemption period of days
that would be about half the daily average china has been importing from iran since january trade data showed
however one source said the united states had attached strings to the waivers including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods which were being evaluated before placing new orders with iran
india has become the world s third biggest oil importer recently overtaking japan
india is also iran s second biggest oil customer and will be one of the most exposed to a forced drop in supply because of its relative proximity to iran
one indian source close to the country s refining sector said india would likely be allowed to import around bpd of iranian crude during the exemption period compared with normal volumes of around bpd
south korea is a large buyer of iranian condensate a super light form of crude oil used by its large petrochemical industry

japan s trade minister hiroshige seko said on tuesday that japanese buyers were expected to resume imports from the islamic republic again soon
refining sources in japan however said they first needed to evaluated the conditions attached to the waivers with no new orders likely before december
taiwan is only an occasional importer of iranian oil and no details regarding its waivers have been disclosed
italy and turkey have been importing around bpd of oil from iran over the past two years with greece importing less than bpd

the waivers for those countries took the market by surprise and trading sources have said they are now evaluating prospects for resuming some imports
