cambodia to boost clean energy use - but coal plants planned too
phnom penh nov thomson reuters foundation cambodia will push ahead with plans to use hydropower and coal to electrify the entire country by but solar energy will play some role especially in remote areas an energy ministry official said on wednesday
the southeast asian nation has electrified rapidly since when only percent of the population had access to power according to the world bank
today percent of villages and percent of households are connected to the grid said victor jona a spokesman for the department of energy at the ministry of mines and energy
hydropower accounts for percent of the mix while coal makes up percent with more plants being built he said
power imports from neighbouring countries contribute almost the entire remainder with renewables such as solar accounting for less than percent he said
but jona said the government has plans to develop more clean energy especially in communities
we hope that solar home systems will do the role for the very remote areas in case the grid can not expand to them he said on the sidelines of a clean energy conference in the capital phnom penh
some solar is also being added to the mix
jona said construction of a megawatt solar plant in kampong speu province west of the capital is scheduled to be completed by the end of
a solar plant came online this year he said but hydropower and coal are still projected to make up percent of cambodia s energy needs once the country achieves full electrification jona said
plants are under construction and will contribute another by next year he said
bridget mcintosh the cambodia director for energy lab which works to promote clean electricity said the the country should consider adding more renewable energy to its mix especially as the cost of solar power falls
it takes five years to build a station or a dam and in those five years the cost of solar will continue to decline she told the thomson reuters foundation
so it makes more sense to now connect solar to the grid to meet the country s electrification goals she said
moving away from coal can also help countries meet their paris agreement goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help curb worsening climate impacts including more extreme floods droughts and sea level rise
cambodia has committed to a percent reduction in its emissions by percent of which will be achieved by promoting clean and more efficient energy
however to scale up solar and other power cambodia must create a more welcoming regulatory environment for investment in it said pheakdey heng a founder of the enrich institute a phnom think tank
that might include everything from providing greater transparency in issuing and revoking energy licenses to removing barriers to adopting solar energy adopting energy efficiency standards and providing tax incentives for clean energy use he said
cambodia s electrification so far has been largely driven by dams and more are under consideration including a controversial sambor dam across the mekong river which is still in the preliminary study stage according to jona
but the benefits of dams have been highly overestimated according to a study published this week by scientists from michigan state university
dams the study said often uproot people from their homes and damage biodiversity while also releasing large amounts of gases from rotting vegetation when water is released through spillways or passes through turbines
