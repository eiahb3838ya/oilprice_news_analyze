update 3-pompeo talks with north koreans postponed, but south says second kim-trump summit on track
washington reuters president donald trump said on wednesday he expects to meet again with north korea s leader kim jong un early next year and that a meeting between secretary of state mike pompeo and north korean officials supposed to have taken place this week would be rescheduled
pompeo had been due to hold talks in new york on thursday with senior north korean official kim yong chol aimed at paving the way for a second summit between trump and kim jong un and at making progress on denuclearization
the state department said early on wednesday that the meeting had been postponed but gave no reason raising concerns that talks aimed at persuading north korea to give up its nuclear arms could break down
the state department said the talks would be rescheduled when our respective schedules trump told a white house news conference the change was because of trips that are being made but did not elaborate on we are going to make it another day he said
but we re very happy with how it s going with north korea
we think it s going fine
we re in no trump said he still expected to hold a second summit with kim
some time next year i would say
sometime early next year he said
kim pledged to work towards denuclearization at an unprecedented first meeting with trump in singapore but negotiations have made little headway since with north korea falling short of demands for irreversible moves to abandon a weapons program that potentially threatens the united states
pyongyang has complained that washington has not made concessions in return for the moves it has taken and last friday warned it could resume development of its nuclear program if the united states did not drop its sanctions campaign
the trump administration has said that sanctions will not be lifted until north korea gives up its weapons
the sanctions are on
i d love to take the sanctions off but they north korea have to be responsive too trump said on wednesday
the state department said conversations continue to take place with north korea and added the united states remains focused on fulfilling the commitments agreed to by president trump and chairman kim at the singapore summit in south korea which has worked to encourage korea dialogue sought to play down the talks delay
south korean foreign minister kang said on thursday the north had suggested a postponement
the north side said both of our schedules are busy so let s postpone kang said according what she was told by the united states
presidential spokesman kim said seoul did not believe it would mean that the second summit would not take place and a senior south korean foreign ministry official said that while the rescheduling was regrettable there was no need to overthink the postponement
i think we have to look at it as a part of the process of reaching complete denuclearization and setting up a peace regime the unnamed official told reporters
trump spoke after his republican party lost control of the house of representatives on tuesday after the democrats rode a wave of dissatisfaction with his presidency in elections
some analysts believe this weakened state could impact trump s foreign policy and test his north korean diplomatic gambit
while republicans maintained control of the senate the democrats now have the opportunity to block trump s agenda and open his administration to intense scrutiny
democrats have said they are determined to obtain more information about meetings between trump and pompeo and kim worried that trump is so eager to make a great deal that he will give kim too much with little in return
north korea has for years pursued nuclear and missile programs in defiance of security council resolutions but the bellicose rhetoric from both pyongyang and trump that raised fears of war has eased this year
