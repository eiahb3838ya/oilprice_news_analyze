italian refiner to produce market new marine fuel ceo will initially produce tonnes per year by ron bousso london nov reuters italian refiner saras is constructing a terminal at its sardinia plant and will market a new cleaner marine fuel ahead of a major regulatory change in its chief executive told reuters
from january the international maritime organization imo will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above percent compared with percent now in one of the biggest changes in the oil market in decades
refineries around the world have been gearing up for the switch by reducing output of fuel and upgrading plants to maximise production of the cleaner more expensive fuel which is similar to diesel
saras is investing in infrastructure that will allow ships to dock outside its sarroch refinery in sardinia to directly load marine fuel oil ulsfo in what is known as bunkering ceo dario scaffardi said
today bunkering is based mainly on blending
in the mediterranean you have malta where people bring different fuels and blend it
with the new specs this blending will be very difficult to achieve for technical reasons so people like us who will be able to produce directly the new fuel will have the competitive advantage scaffardi said
with a small investment we will have bunkering infrastructure and a lightering vessel and start selling locally fuels to expand the the company did not disclose the size of the investment
saras one of europe s most modern refineries which also has a trading desk in geneva is developing its own ulsfo that the company will start marketing directly to shippers
