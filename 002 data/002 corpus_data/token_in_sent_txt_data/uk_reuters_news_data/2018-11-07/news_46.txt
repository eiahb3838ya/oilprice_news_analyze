graphic imports of countries with waivers by clyde russell melbourne nov reuters in the end president donald trump kicked the iran crude oil sanctions can six months down the road raising questions as to how the various players in the dispute will use the time
the government granted waivers to eight buyers of iranian crude exempting them from the sanctions that came into effect this week that are aimed at reducing exports from the islamic republic to zero
the waivers will allow the eight countries which include top buyers china and india to keep buying crude for another days a move aimed at reducing the shock of a sudden loss of all iranian exports
there are a number of ways of looking at the decision to grant waivers to countries which together account for some percent of iran s total oil exports
the first would be that trump and his administration effectively blinked first in their dispute with iran over its nuclear and missile programmes
it could also be argued that it was a rare example of realpolitik from the trump administration with the tacit recognition that cutting iran s exports to zero in one fell swoop would boost crude prices hurting not only consumers but also the rest of the world
trump was keen to talk up his administration s capability of completely isolating iran
but perhaps with an eye on the elections on tuesday he made it clear that keeping crude prices low was also a priority
i could get the iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market
i don t want to lift oil prices trump told reporters on before flying to a campaign event
the decision to grant the waivers has already calmed oil markets which hadn t really anticipated tehran s exports dropping to zero but may have also been uncertain as to how much crude would actually be lost
brent crude closed at a barrel on tuesday down percent from the close on and down percent from the high of reached on
and port data suggests that iran has already suffered a fairly steep drop in exports prior to the of sanctions
from some million barrels per day bpd of exports in iran s exports dropped to around million bpd in recent months according to refinitiv data
a further drop is on the cards for november with the caveat that tracking iran s exports has become more difficult given that tankers are turning off their systems
with the granting of the waivers it s likely that iran will be able to keep its exports at least around million bpd and possibly even as high as the million bpd of recent months
for the iranians the waivers provides them with a financial lifeline and time to try and lobby support from other countries against washington s sanctions
for major buyers like china which imported about bpd of iranian crude in the first months of the year the waivers allow it to maintain diversity of supply as well as keeping prices lower
with iranian barrels still in the market the pressure on other major exporters like saudi arabia and russia to ensure a market or risk trump s displeasure is reduced
but they may not be happy if crude prices continue to weaken
the big question is how does the trump administration use the window it has granted to iran
will there be any genuine attempts to find common ground with tehran on deal reached together with other western powers to limit iran s nuclear programme
or will the united states use to time to ensure that it can enforce the sanctions when the days expires while not causing oil prices to spike
it seems unlikely that washington and tehran could agree to the nuclear deal in such a short time period even if only relatively minor changes were made similar to the north american free trade agreement recently concluded by the trump administration and canada and mexico
in the meantime the oil market can probably cross iran off its list of worries but pencil it back for sometime around april next year
