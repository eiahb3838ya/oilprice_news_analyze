obama-era architect of climate accord seeks to keep it on track
bonn germany reuters a architect of the paris climate accord under barack obama has been working to bolster the pact at global talks in germany reckoning it matches interests despite president donald trump plans to pull out
i don t want to see the paris agreement roll off the tracks todd stern who was obama s special envoy for climate change told reuters during talks ending on thursday in germany on a detailed rule book for the paris agreement
that s not in the interests of the united states he told reuters
stern is with the world resources institute at the bonn meeting of almost nations and also works at the brookings institution
he and many other delegates said the united states has been concerned for decades under both republican and democratic administrations to ensure that rules governing environmental pacts were strong and oblige china for instance to abide by the same standards as rich nations
in bonn the delegation is also insisting on strong rules for reporting and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions in a rare overlap between obama s and trump s interests
a rule book is due to be in place by the end of at a meeting in poland
a strong rule book is not only in the interests of the it would mean everyone can say that s a pretty good deal stern said
stern said he was listening to delegates and giving advice
washington is still formally part of the paris accord which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century even though trump announced plans to quit last year and bolster the fossil fuel industry
formally a pullout will only take effect in
it s not surprising to me patricia espinosa head of the
climate change secretariat said of stern s presence
she told reuters there is always a need for people with skills who can advise people who can give a perspective on different asked about stern a state department official said the united states has always supported access for stakeholders in the climate process including business groups ngos and other civil society alden meyer of the union of concerned scientists said a strong rule book could make it easier for a future administration to the deal

policy since the has been to hold countries to the same standards he said
