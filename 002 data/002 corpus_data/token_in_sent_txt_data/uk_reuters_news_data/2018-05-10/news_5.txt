update 2-iran says us exit from deal will not impact its oil
ankara reuters iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said on thursday that president donald trump s decision to quit a multinational nuclear deal would not affect tehran s oil exports
trump s decision will not have any impact on our oil export that era is history now he told state television
trump announced a withdrawal from the nuclear deal on tuesday and said he was preparing new sanctions against iran
zanganeh said foreign investment was needed to develop iran s its oil industry but that it could survive even if foreigners decided to stay away for fear of penalties
if foreigners invest in iran it will accelerate the development of our oil sector but if not we will not die he said
the treasury said on tuesday that the united states would reimpose a wide array of sanctions after the expiry of and periods including sanctions aimed at iran s oil sector and transactions with its central bank
under the deal reached in between iran and six major powers tehran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifting most international sanctions that crippled the country s economy
since the sanctions were lifted in major european companies partly wary of the remaining sanctions on iran have been reluctant to do business with tehran which needs to attract over billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output
new sanctions will include measures aimed at its oil and shipping sectors with a wind down period to allow companies to end contracts terminate business and get their money out according to the state department
in the wake of new sanctions some buyers of opec s oil producer said on wednesday they would seek exemptions to purchase iranian crude
zanganeh said iran s crude production was about four million barrels per day bpd almost four percent of global output
i expect the production to remain the same until the end of this iranian year zanganeh said
the iranian year ends on march
during the last round of sanctions iran s oil supplies fell by around one million bpd but the country as a major oil exporter after sanctions were lifted by producing million bpd in march
in reaction to a tweet last month by trump that accused opec of artificially boosting oil prices zanganeh said trump is not honest about oil prices
he wants higher prices
crude prices slipped on thursday giving up early gains as investors took profits on a rally triggered by potential disruption to oil flows from iran
i personally prefer a stable crude price of per barrel zanganeh said
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and several other producers began to reduce oil output in january in an attempt to erase a supply glut and prop up prices
they have extended the pact until december and meet in june to review policy
opec however is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from iran four sources familiar with the issue said saying any loss in supply would take time
