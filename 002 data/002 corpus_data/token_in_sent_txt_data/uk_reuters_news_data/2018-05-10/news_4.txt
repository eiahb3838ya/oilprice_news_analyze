update 1-venezuela suggests ready to pay after conoco moves on its caribbean assets
adds conoco response context by alexandra ulmer and deisy buitrago caracas may reuters venezuela on thursday rejected conocophillips s moves to seize the country s caribbean assets to collect on a billion arbitration award but in a sign the oil company s pressure might be working caracas also suggested it was ready to pay
in its first official comments since reuters revealed conoco s actions over the weekend venezuela s leftist government said pdvsa wanted to solve the dispute through legal means
the dispute stems from venezuela s nationalization of conoco s assets a decade ago under late leader hugo chavez
pdvsa is committed to honoring the decisions stemming from the arbitration award the oil ministry said in a series of tweets
the tweets disappeared about an hour later
venezuela s oil ministry and pdvsa did not respond to a request for comment
conoco is looking forward to pdvsa s proposals to resolve this matter said janet langford carrig conocophillips senior vice president general counsel and corporate secretary in an email
but absent any agreement and payment of the icc award we will continue our enforcement venezuela would be hard pressed to cough up billion as it faces a brutal recession hefty debt payments to bondholders and an upcoming presidential election
nicolas maduro s leftist administration is also battling more than a dozen other arbitration cases triggered by a wave of nationalizations under chavez who died of cancer in
venezuela has requested annulments or shown little willingness to pay recent awards leading creditors to pursue its overseas assets as a form of payment
in the most aggressive move to date conocophillips last week moved to temporarily seize pdvsa s assets on aruba bonaire curacao and eustatius
that threw venezuela s oil export chain into a tailspin just as venezuela s crude production has crumbled to an over low due to underinvestment theft a brain drain and mismanagement
pdvsa was forced to suspend oil storage and shipping from its caribbean facilities and has concentrated most shipping in its main crude terminal of jose which is suffering from a backlog
conoco s actions may have also spurred action from other creditors who fear ending up at the end of the line
mining company rusoro filed a lawsuit seeking to attach assets of pdvsa s citgo petroleum as payment for a billion arbitration award
and a firm that received the venezuelan promissory notes from canadian contractor on wednesday sued pdvsa for over million over nonpayment
