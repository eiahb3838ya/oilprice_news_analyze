long shutdown casts shadow over sale of moroccan refinery
samir refinery s debts estimated at bln several offers made no deal reached so far staff salaries slashed shutdown sparks protests by ahmed eljechtimi mohammedia morocco may reuters morocco s only refinery will find it tougher to find a buyer the longer it stays closed as equipment ages and qualified staff move away industry sources say almost three years after operations were halted due to heavy debts
one source said trustees had received offers for the samir plant controlled by saudi billionaire mohammed s corral holdings and shut by the government in over unpaid taxes
but he said trustees had failed to agree terms with potential buyers of the plant which has total debts estimated at billion dirhams billion the equivalent of about percent of the north african nation s gross domestic product
the source did not say why terms were not agreed for samir which was a victim of the crash in oil prices from their peaks that left the plant struggling to service debts some of which were linked to crude loaned when prices were higher
shuttering the plant which experts value at billion dirhams has left morocco reliant on imported refined products and sparked protests by workers
energy imports cost morocco billion dirhams last year
the longer the crisis drags on the more difficult it will be for samir to find a buyer said the source who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the subject
he said this was not only due to the piling up of debt but also because equipment is getting old and some of the best human resources are tired of waiting and have sought other other industry sources and parties interested in the plant have previously said idling the refinery which the government said owed billion dirhams in unpaid taxes made it more difficult to find a buyer
hussain head of oil and gas industries at the cdt union said the government should work faster to sell the plant in mohammedia about km miles north of casablanca saying jobs at the plant and in related industries were at stake
he also said delays would make a sale tougher
some staff at the refinery which had directly employed people still show up for work mainly to maintain the plant
but salaries have been slashed hurting the economy of the town and prompting protests and over the shutdown
we live in acute uncertainty said farid baroudi an employee whose wages were halved
trustees first invited bids for the refinery in february and have extended the deadline for offers
industry sources said in may that swiss trader glencore and private equity firm carlyle group teamed up to bid aiming to recoup about million in loans
a banking source familiar with the situation said talks had not progressed while the firms and trustees have not commented
a diplomatic source said an iraqi oil ministry delegation visited samir in april this year
local website said opec member iraq might be interested in the refinery to boost refined product exports to europe and north africa
no further developments have been reported
most offers are from parties whose capacity to relaunch samir is shrouded in doubt said energy expert el mehdi fakir
the complicated legal proceedings and debt are making it hard to corral with a percent stake in the plant has sought international arbitration against the government saying it breached an investment agreement and demanding compensation for the decision to liquidate samir
yamani head of oil and gas industries at the cdt union said the state should nationalise samir to safeguard thousands of jobs and save morocco s refining industry if no sale was agreed
he said the shutdown was costing mohammedia about billion dirhams a year as a result of unpaid salaries and lost fees from services linked to the plant
government spokesman mustapha el khalfi said the state would ensure oil supplies and protect employees rights as the legal process proceeded
morocco will defend its interests he said
