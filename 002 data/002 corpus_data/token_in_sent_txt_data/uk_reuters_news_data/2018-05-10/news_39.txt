update 1-opec in no hurry to decide if extra oil needed to offset iran -sources
reuters opec is in no hurry to decide whether to pump more oil to make up for an expected drop in exports from iran after the imposition of new sanctions four sources familiar with the issue said saying any loss in supply would take time
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has a deal with russia and producers to cut supplies that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since
officials are considering whether a drop in iranian exports and a decline in supply from another opec member venezuela demands adjusting the deal that runs to the end of
ministers meet in june to review the policy
sanctions on iran will have a period during which buyers should wind down oil purchases meaning any loss of supply will not be immediately felt in the market
i think we have days before any supply impact an opec source said when asked about any plans for action
a second opec source said that while the need to add extra supply was being considered the safest thing for the group to do for now was to sit tight and monitor the situation
oil reached a barrel on thursday its highest since november two days after president donald trump said the united states was abandoning an international nuclear deal with iran and would impose new sanctions
iran which pumps about percent of the world s oil exports about barrels per day bpd to europe and around million bpd to asia
sales to europe are seen by analysts as the more likely to be reduced by the sanctions
it s too early to know now the impact said a third opec source
we need to wait and see what china will do what japan will do
who will buy iranian oil and who will side with as part of the supply deal opec pledged to cut million bpd from supplies from its members
in practice the group has overshot this partly because venezuelan output has plunged due an economic crisis
oil ministers from opec and its partners meet on june in vienna to review the existing agreement
before that technical officials meet in jeddah saudi arabia on may when the issue of whether extra barrels are needed to offset any iranian loss will likely come up the second source said
a fourth opec source also said it was too soon to tell if extra oil was needed citing iran s ability to keep much of its exports flowing under a previous round of sanctions
too early to judge he said
on wednesday a separate opec source had said saudi arabia was monitoring the impact of the move on oil supplies and was ready to offset any shortage but would not act alone
this source had also said the impact of sanctions on iranian supplies needed to be assessed first and saudi arabia did not expect any physical impact on the market until the third or fourth quarters
analysts also expect saudi arabia to be cautious and step in only to offset an actual supply loss not an anticipated one
saudi will remain reactive and not forward fundamentals
if a supply dislocation emerges and inventories get abnormally low then opec and russia may act said yasser el guindi market strategist at energy aspects
