corrected-analysis-u.s. diplomats face tough task imposing new iran oil curbs
washington reuters by restoring sanctions against iran president donald trump has tasked a state department office with convincing companies and governments worldwide to cut imports of iranian crude even if that means paying more to buy oil from other suppliers
the bureau of energy resources got the job done during the iran sanctions that spanned to when president barack obama had the cooperation of european leaders in choking off iran s main revenue source to pressure it to curb its nuclear program
this time around the office faces steeper challenges europe s leaders now oppose trump s aggressive stance on iran and are considering ways to block the sanctions the senate has yet to confirm a leader for the bureau and the state department already has its hands full managing sanctions on venezuela trade disputes with china and looming talks with north korea
it s going to be a lot harder this time said amos hochstein who led the bureau under president obama when diplomats from the united states iran china france russia the united kingdom and germany formed the nuclear deal
there s going to be a lot less good under trump s renewed sanctions foreign firms will have days to make reductions or face penalties that can include fines and restrictions on doing business in the united states
washington can identify the buyers sellers traders shippers insurers and financial institutions involved in iranian oil purchases because all foreign transactions in dollars are cleared by the federal reserve
the work is harder if trades are done in other currencies
the united states has banned iranian oil imports to its own shores for decades so washington s ability to squeeze the exports will rely on convincing foreign governments and companies to pressure the islamic republic back to the negotiating table for a better deal as trump has said he expects
officials at the department of treasury the department of commerce and the white house did not respond to a request for comment on the difficulty in managing oil curbs on iran
when asked about the challenges energy bureau spokesman vincent campos said the office will carry out sanctions policy in the current if successful sanctions would slash exports from one of the top suppliers in the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec and likely raise prices for crude globally by forcing buyers to compete for alternative supplies
oil prices have already vaulted over a barrel to highs not seen since
under obama and hochstein iran s exports of oil plummeted from about million barrels per day bpd to less than million bpd according to the energy information administration
imposing those cuts was difficult even with more geopolitical backing
teams from the bureau joined with colleagues from the departments of treasury and commerce to visit governments in asia and the middle east cajoling them into finding alternatives to iranian oil and to help battle smuggling
the european union joined the united states and passed its own iran sanctions in cutting its imports of iranian oil from bpd to zero
this time european leaders will be less helpful
they have urged trump not to leave the nuclear deal which they say was and has proven to be an effective tool preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
the european union meanwhile is considering a blocking statute that would ban any eu company from complying with the sanctions
french president emmanuel macron warned before trump s announcement that if washington pulls fully out of the deal it could start a war
the leaders of germany england and russia have also expressed dismay and are scrambling to salvage the accord after washington s exit
a state department official told reporters in a briefing tuesday that no diplomats had yet engaged with any private sector energy companies about cutting their iranian purchases but that energy bureau staff would move out immediately to do so
sources with three global trading houses involved in iranian oil purchases said they expected iran s customers to ask for waivers under the sanctions
some asian governments including south korea india and china are also hoping they can avoid the brunt of the sanctions by acquiring waivers which the government has said it will only consider granting if a country shows a good faith effort to cut iranian purchases
the job facing the bureau on iran sanctions will require strong leadership and a robust workforce according to three former state department officials who worked on sanctions
but the state department s energy bureau is embarking on this difficult work without a permanent leader and with some vacancies in the ranks from a hiring freeze and transfers
trump s nominee to head the bureau francis fannon a former head of corporate affairs at bhp billiton and senior director of murphy oil corp awaits senate confirmation
the bureau is currently being managed by acting special envoy john mccarrick a former corporate lawyer and energy advisor for republican john mccain s unsuccessful presidential campaign
a state department inspector general report said in that people worked full time at the bureau
campos declined to say how many worked there now but said the teams managing sanctions on iran and venezuela are fully staffed
bob mcnally former president george bush s top energy adviser said the state department is fully able to make the sanctions work but the administration still needs to define its goals
the sanctions imposed under the obama administration were threatened by smuggling of iranian oil by crews shutting off tracking devices on tankers mixing iranian oil into tankers of oil and other methods
energy bureau officials controlled that problem through close coordination with other agencies embassies abroad and local law enforcement the former state department officials said
the bureau also needs to determine how much it wants companies to reduce iranian oil imports which requires deft diplomacy and an analysis of historical buying trends
the previous administration avoided telling countries percentages it wanted them to cut and allowed some countries to buy more than others but countries ended up cutting purchases about to percent
there is a lot more that goes on in the everyday grunt work than bluntly i think this administration understands richard nephew who served as the lead sanctions expert for the team that negotiated the obama administration s deal with iran said in an interview
another key priority will be to set a clear requirement for the lifting of sanctions
in the sanctions were designed to end once iran agreed to specific limits on its nuclear program
this time there s less clarity hochstein said
countries never want to be told what to do with their economy said hochstein
at least before it was toward a specific end
now it s open trump said on wednesday that iran would now either negotiate to alter the deal or something will this story corrects trump s to trump in lead paragraph corrects spelling of john mccarrick s name in paragraph
