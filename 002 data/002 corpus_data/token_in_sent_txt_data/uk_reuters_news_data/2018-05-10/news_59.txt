update 1-inpex may drop second bid for iran's azadegan oil project after sanctions decision
tokyo reuters japan s biggest energy explorer inpex corp said on thursday it may drop its second attempt to join in developing iran s south azadegan oilfield after president donald trump said he will sanctions on tehran
the comment illustrates the turmoil that trump s withdrawal from a agreement to limit iran s nuclear programme has set in motion for potential investors in the iranian economy
inpex relinquished a percent stake in azadegan in because sanctions by the united states on iran made it difficult to access financing for the project
according to energy consultants wood mackenzie the azadegan fields are considered one of the world s biggest oil discoveries of the past years with an estimate of about billion barrels of oil in place
oil production at the fields was planned to reach barrels per day
the lifting of the sanctions in after the agreement opened the way for inpex to again participate in developing the oilfield
we recognise that it has become difficult for us to engage in activities for the bidding after trump s decision this week an inpex spokeswoman told reuters by phone
president trump on tuesday said he was pulling out of the nuclear agreement and will reinstitute sanctions against tehran that were suspended under the accord
other energy projects could be affected including total s dollar natural gas project in iran unless waivers can be secured
while governments in europe and asia were still trying to delay the sanctions by salvaging some parts of the deal with iran analysts had little hope that opposition to the action would prevent the restrictions
fereidun fesharaki the founder and chairman of energy consultancy fge said europe and asia would not be able or willing to significantly fight against the sanctions
they will grumble and accept it
there is no one who will realistically choose iran over the he said
inpex remains interested in participating in iran s oil and gas sector because of its high potential and would be interested in joining the project if the situation changes the inpex spokeswoman said
in august inpex joined a workshop held in iran on the south azadegan field to gather information for the bidding the spokeswoman added without giving further details on the status of the bidding process due to a confidentiality agreement
the news service for iran s oil ministry reported on may that the country planned to tender exploration blocks and iranian energy officials said that the country s oil industry would continue to develop despite any new sanctions
