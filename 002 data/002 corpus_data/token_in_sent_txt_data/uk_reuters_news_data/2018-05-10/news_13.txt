update 1-logjam for paris climate "rule book" as end-2018 deadline looms
bonn germany reuters governments made slow progress on a rule book for a global climate accord after two weeks of talks ending on thursday and agreed to a new round of negotiations to break a diplomatic logjam before a deadline for a deal
disputes among the senior climate officials from about nations in bonn included how rich nations will raise finance to a pledged billion a year by to help developing nations cope with rising temperatures and cut their emissions
we can t say failure
but overall we ve been having slow progress gebru jember endalew chair of the group of least developed countries told reuters
poor nations are most vulnerable to more droughts floods and rising sea levels
delegates agreed to hold an extra session in bangkok from september before environment ministers meet in katowice poland in december when the rule book for the paris pact is due to be agreed
the paris agreement set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century with a shift toward cleaner energies such as wind or solar power to help limit a rise in temperatures
but it was vague on the details such as how to measure financial flows to developing nations and how countries will report and monitor curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and ratchet up national goals every five years to limit global warming
we have to be very very clear that we have a lot of work in the months ahead and that we have to improve the pace of progress to achieve a good outcome in katowice patricia espinosa the climate chief told a news conference
she said progress had been satisfactory in bonn
writing the rule book formally known as implementation guidelines is the biggest test of the international commitment to the paris agreement since president donald trump said in june he will pull out doubting that climate change has a human cause
elina bardram of the european commission said clear rules on curbing emissions adapting to climate change and finance were vital in to bring the paris agreement to life
but she said some elements were likely to need more time
we have to accept that not all the nitty gritty details can be agreed by katowice she said
luke daunivalu chief negotiator for fiji which is presiding at the talks in also said of the rule book how thick or how thin is an open question at the moment
it will become a little clearer at current national pledges to curb emissions put the world on track for a warming of about degrees celsius fahrenheit above times far above a paris goal of well below
