wrapup 8-europeans work to save iran deal, and business, after trump pulls out
reuters dismayed european allies sought on wednesday to salvage the iran nuclear deal and preserve their iranian trade after president donald trump withdrew the united states from the landmark accord and ordered sanctions reimposed on tehran
the deal is not dead
there s an american withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there french foreign minister le drian said
but iranian president hassan rouhani a pragmatist who helped engineer the deal to ease iran s economically crippling isolation told french counterpart emmanuel macron in a phone call that europe had only a limited opportunity to preserve the pact the iranian students news agency reported
europe must as quickly as possible clarify its position and specify and announce its intentions with regard to its obligations isna quoted rouhani as telling macron
macron who like other european leaders had lobbied trump to keep the agreement that was struck before the republican president took office in january urged rouhani to adhere to the deal and to consider broader negotiations
trump said on tuesday he would revive economic sanctions which would penalize foreign firms doing business with tehran to undermine what he called a horrible deal that should have never ever been made
on wednesday he said iran would now either negotiate or something will it was not immediately clear what actions he was suggesting would take place
the white house said later that trump was preparing to impose new sanctions on iran perhaps as early as next week but gave no details
iran has drafted a proportional plan to cope with the withdrawal the official news agency irna quoted government spokesman mohammad baqer nobakht as saying
he said without elaborating that budgets had been drawn up to handle various scenarios
the fruit of more than a decade of diplomacy the nuclear agreement was clinched in july by the united states france britain germany russia china and iran
it was designed to prevent iran developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy not least by washington threatening to penalize businesses anywhere in the world that traded with iran
trump complained that the deal the signature foreign policy achievement of his democratic predecessor barack obama did not address iran s ballistic missile program its nuclear activities beyond or its role in conflicts in yemen and syria
his decision raises the risk of deepening conflicts in the middle east puts the united states at odds with european diplomatic and business interests and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies
oil prices rose more than percent with brent touching a high
in the latest violence iranian forces on the side of the golan heights shelled israeli army outposts on the strategic plateau but caused no casualties an israeli military spokesman said saying israel had retaliated
syrian air defences confronted israeli rockets on syrian territory without specifying the location syrian state media reported quoting a military source
the pullout could strengthen hardliners in iranian politics at the expense of moderates like rouhani who had pinned their hopes on the deal to boost living standards in iran with limited success so far
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei a hardliner said mr trump i tell you on behalf of the iranian people you ve made a mistake

i said many times from the first day don t trust le drian german chancellor angela merkel and the international atomic energy agency iaea all said iran was honouring its commitments under the accord
the region deserves better than further destabilisation provoked by american withdrawal le drian said
later on wednesday defense secretary jim mattis sought to allay concerns that washington had alienated itself from close allies with trump s decision
the president could not affirm as required that this agreement was being lived up to mattis told a senate hearing
we now have the opportunity to move forward to address those shortcomings and make it more the european union said it would ensure sanctions on iran remain lifted as long as tehran meets its commitments
the kremlin said russian president vladimir putin was deeply concerned by the withdrawal the ria news agency said
merkel said that while the existing deal should not be called into question there should be discussion of a broader deal that goes beyond it
british foreign secretary boris johnson spoke of a agreement but said it was up to washington to come up with concrete proposals
macron said he wanted a broader discussion with all relevant parties on the development of iran s nuclear programme after when key elements of the current deal start to expire as well as iran s ballistic missile programme and wider middle east issues
iranian officials will next week meet counterparts from france britain and germany
khamenei appeared sceptical whether they could deliver i don t trust these three the chances of saving the deal without washington depend largely on whether international firms are willing and able to keep trading with iran despite the threat of sanctions
in a sign of what may be in store trump s ambassador to berlin tweeted within hours of taking up his post that german businesses should halt activities in iran at once
french finance minister bruno le maire said the united states should not consider itself the world s economic policeman
britain france and germany said they would do all they could to protect their business interests in iran yet it was unclear how much they can shield firms from sanctions
brussels has a blocking statute at its disposal that bans any eu company from complying with sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce american penalties
but the statute has never been used and is seen by european governments more as a political weapon than a regulation because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce
british prime minister theresa may s spokesman made the limits of potential action clear uk businesses may wish to consider the implications for their business activities in iran and where necessary seek appropriate legal european companies including carmaker psa plane manufacturer airbus and engineering group siemens all said they were watching the situation
a senior french diplomat said businesses would ultimately be forced to choose between their iranian economic interests and their potential interests adding generally that decision is quickly made in favour of the hardliner lawmakers in iran s parliament burned a flag and a symbolic copy of the deal known officially as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa chanting death to america rouhani who could be weakened by a blow to iran s economy struck a more conciliatory tone in a televised speech saying iran would negotiate with eu countries china and russia
if at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the jcpoa with the cooperation of all countries the deal will remain he said
the trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal but it is far from clear whether the europeans would pursue that option or be able to win iran over
abandoning the pact was one of the most consequential decisions of trump s america first policy which has led him to quit the global paris climate accord come close to a trade war with china and pull out of an trade deal
iran denies western suspicions that it tried in the past to develop atomic weapons and says its nuclear energy program has been for peaceful purposes
senior officials themselves have said several times that iran is in technical compliance with the nuclear pact
renewing sanctions would make it much harder for iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system
iran is the organization of the petroleum exporting countries s member pumping about million barrels per day of crude or just under percent of global supply
china india japan and south korea buy most of its million bpd of exports
iran s rial currency plunged to a record low against the dollar in the free market after sliding for months because of a weak economy financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among iranians who feared that renewed sanctions would hit iranian exports hard
among the few nations to welcome trump s decision were israel and saudi arabia iran s in the middle east regarding it as a political victory
