russia's lavrov says nord stream 2 gas pipeline to slash costs
moscow may reuters russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on thursday that the proposed nord stream natural gas pipeline via the baltic sea to germany would offer costs far lower than those incurred by routing gas via ukraine
nord stream would double the existing capacity of nord stream to billion cubic metres per year
that would allow russian gas exports to europe to bypass ukraine with which russia s relations have deteriorated since it annexed crimea in
