exclusive-equatorial guinea in lng sale talks as shell deal winds down
london reuters equatorial guinea is in talks to sell liquefied natural gas lng supply from its punta europa project to independent and oil companies and traders from as it winds down an exclusive deal with royal dutch shell
gabriel obiang lima minister for mines and hydrocarbons told reuters he is seeking to lift royalties from future lng deals close to percent compared with percent under existing arrangements with shell
shell s deal inherited after it acquired bg group in was amended in under government pressure to include a percent share of profits but it is still among the most lucrative contracts for any lng exporter
we invited possible lng buyers so they are aware of the opportunities lima said adding that talks are progressing with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc russia s lukoil france s total trader vitol shell and a joint venture between lukoil and newage
supply deals will be offered for years from lima said
equatorial guinea s lng plant operated by marathon oil corporation is currently fed by the depleting alba gas field which faces a dip in output from he said
future production will be underpinned by pooling supply from stranded gas fields in equatorial guinea and the wider region raising the prospect of eventually boosting lng output and state energy revenue
lima s sales pitch shows how producers from fully projects can afford to release supply to unconventional buyers such as trade houses under short tenors stimulating global lng market liquidity

in signing up to buy all of equatorial guinea s million tonnes of annual lng output for years bg group later acquired by shell sealed one of the industry s most lucrative lng deals
it paid a fixed discount to henry hub gas prices now one of the cheapest gas benchmarks in the world as it initially planned to sell supply into that market
as the shale gas revolution killed demand for lng imports bg group benefited from paying prices for the lng as it diverted supply to asia where prices were up to five times higher
the original contract made no provision for profit sharing on cargo diversions with the government highlighting how america s transformation from gas importer to exporter blindsided lng players
alba gas field reserves of three trillion cubic feet for lng only provided for the first years of the plant s output leaving the later part of bg s contract uncovered
this may have allowed the government to exit the deal early in an industry source said
but new gas supplies are being lined up
in a statement on thursday noble energy announced a pact with equatorial guinea to make available of gas from its offshore alen field for the lng plant
the proposal envisages a platform and pipeline miles to punta europa big enough to carry gas from other nearby fields in a concession to lima s vision for equatorial guinea to be a regional gas export hub
a parallel statement by lng plant operator marathon said it would open the facility to gas suppliers
