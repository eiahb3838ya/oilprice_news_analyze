conoco says to maintain legal actions until pdvsa pays $2 bln award
houston may reuters conocophillips said on thursday it would continue enforcing legal actions against venezuela s oil company pdvsa until it receives a payment to satisfy a billion arbitration award recently issued by the international chamber of commerce icc
the oil firm s actions so far have included the seizure of oil inventories and assets in the caribbean islands where pdvsa operates
the measures have forced the company to halt storage and shipping from at least four terminals creating a bottleneck of tankers around its venezuelan ports
we look forward to hearing pdvsa s proposals to resolve this matter
but absent any agreement and payment of the icc award we will continue our enforcement actions said janet langford carrig conoco s general counsel
