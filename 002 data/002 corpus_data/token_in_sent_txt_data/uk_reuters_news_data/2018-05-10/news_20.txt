relief for indian solar producers as government reneges on import duty
india scraps import duty on solar modules sudden change in tax policy last year led to logjams at ports indian component makers have struggled to compete with chinese firms by sudarshan varadhan new delhi may reuters india has scrapped a duty on solar modules making it easier to import the products after a sudden change in customs policy last year led to a logjam of shipments at indian ports
several consignments of solar modules worth more than million in total were held up for more than three months at ports after indian customs officials in august demanded that some of them be classified as electric motors and generators carrying a percent import duty
previously they were subject to no duty
the finance ministry reversed the policy last month stating in a notice seen by reuters that most solar modules should revert to their original classification and that no tax should be levied on them
indian component makers have struggled to compete with chinese companies such as trina solar and yingli and have sought duties as well as safeguards
but the logjam of shipments at ports posed a headache for solar power producers and threatened to delay prime minister narendra modi s plan of nearly tripling the country s total renewable energy capacity to gigawatt gw by
the plan has spurred foreign investment in the sector with japan s softbank and goldman sachs among others investing in solar projects in india
any duty is bad news for solar power producers such as sb energy but good for local solar component makers such as indosolar and moser baer
the change in policy last august led to logjams as it was not immediately clear which modules belonged to the new classification
to ease the situation customs officials agreed to release shipments if importers paid a bank guarantee to cover any duty they may be required to pay
an executive at the indian unit of germany s enerparc which had of its containers stuck at the port of chennai said there was still some uncertainty about the process even though the duty had been scrapped
looks like it will take a month before we get our money bank guarantees back but we are happy that the issue has been resolved enerparc s managing director santosh khatelsal said
customs officials were not available for comment outside of regular business hours
