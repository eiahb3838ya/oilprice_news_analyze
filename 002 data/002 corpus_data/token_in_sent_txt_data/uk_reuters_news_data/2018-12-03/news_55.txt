update 2-drax, iberdrola revise plants deal after eu decision
london reuters british power producer drax group plc has revised the terms of its deal to buy uk generation assets from spain s iberdrola to ensure it gets a rebate on lost capacity payments due to a pause in a government scheme
in october drax agreed to buy some uk hydro and pumped storage power plants from iberdrola s scottish power for million pounds as it aims to exit production before a government deadline
last month britain had to halt a power scheme called the capacity market to avoid electricity shortages pending a further investigation by european union regulators
the scheme pays providers for making energy supplies available at short notice to avoid shortages that might occur as coal plants close and low prices dissuade investors from building new power plants
even though drax believes that the european commission will reapprove the existing capacity market in its current or similar form the pause has put payments to plants it is buying in the iberdrola deal at risk
therefore it has agreed a scheme with the spanish firm as a result which could mean it receives a payment of up to million pounds
under the revised terms if less than percent of capacity payments from are received and gross profit of the portfolio for the full year is less than million pounds iberdrola will pay drax up to million pounds
similarly if gross profit is more than million plunds drax will make a payment to iberdrola of up to million pounds
when the deal was originally announced drax expected scottish power s portfolio of assets to contribute gross profit of million pounds
for a graphic on drax iberdrola deal high doused by eu ruling see the capacity market is a central pillar of the uk s energy policy and ensures security of supply while minimising costs to consumers will gardiner chief executive of drax group said in a statement
to mitigate the risk that capacity payments take time to be restored we have agreed revised terms which provide protection in he added
the judgement by the eu s general court in october annulled a decision by the european commission which had said britain s capacity market was compatible with eu state aid rules
it could take a year or more for the capacity market to be reinstated analysts say
shares in drax rose as high as pence after the news but receded slightly to pence by gmt
