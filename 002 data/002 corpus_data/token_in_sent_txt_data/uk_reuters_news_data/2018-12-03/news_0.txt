update 4-some canadian producers push back as alberta orders oil cuts
suncor husky imperial push against canada move cnrl cenovus support the move canadian oil discount narrows after weekend announcement oil deliveries constrained by full pipelines adds comments from cenovus ceo industry background by devika krishna kumar and julie gordon new dec reuters several oil companies in canada pushed back on monday against alberta s mandated cuts in crude production warning about excessive government intervention even as the discount on canadian crudes narrowed sharply on the curtailment plan
alberta premier rachel notley said on sunday the government would force producers to cut output by percent or barrels per day bpd until excess crude in storage is reduced
the move is unusual for a market economy like canada in comparison with members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries whose oil companies are often
prices for canadian grades of crude oil moved sharply upward monday narrowing the deep discounts they had been trading at relative to their counterparts
while producers said they would comply with the mandatory cuts executives from canada s suncor energy inc husky energy inc and imperial oil integrated producers with domestic refinery and upgrading capacity expressed disappointment
we believe the market is working and view curtailment or other interventions as possibly having serious negative investment economic and trade consequences said husky in a statement
however major producers like cenovus energy inc and canadian natural resources ltd were vocal with their support
at or differentials the lion s share of companies in this industry are barely breaking even or actually losing money cenovus chief executive alex pourbaix said in an interview
canada is one of the world s largest oil producers supplying more than million barrels a day but wcs prices slumped in october to a discount of more than a barrel below wti due to the transportation constraints and storage glut
heavy western canadian select oil traded at a a barrel discount to crude on monday compared with a discount on friday
light synthetic crude from the oil sands settled at below the benchmark narrower than friday
following the cuts pourbaix said cenovus expects discounts closer to a barrel in supporting investment of c billion billion in in line with capital spending
that would not have been the case if the government hadn t take action pourbaix said
suncor is assessing the impact of the government s announcement it said noting that the market is the most effective means to balance supply and demand and normalize differentials
less economic production was being curtailed and differentials were narrowing as a result of market forces suncor said in a statement adding that specific effects from the cuts will be discussed in its upcoming outlook
imperial oil ceo rich kruger said the company was reviewing the impact on its investments
but cnrl cheered the alberta government s move noting these are unprecedented times and they call for urgent nexen a subsidiary of cnooc ltd said the actions would help strengthen the alberta economy
canada s production has steadily increased over the last year and is set to grow some percent through according to the canadian association of petroleum producers but shipments have been constrained by the lack of pipelines out of alberta to the united states and overseas markets
several projects including transcanada corp s keystone xl to the united states and the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline to the west coast have been hamstrung by battles with opponents
the action is a remedy but not solution said michael tran commodity strategist at rbc capital markets
rail cars aside there s no solution that does not involve building a the mandated cuts are controversial because heavily integrated producers like suncor and husky benefit from the low crude prices to feed their refineries
they also tend to have more secure pipeline access
producers that don t have refineries and were having to place their barrels on the spot market without pipeline capacity are the ones that are really benefitting from this said kurt barrow vice president of oil markets and downstream at ihsmarkit
shares of companies like cenovus and canadian natural resources that lack refining capacity rose while shares of some companies with refineries like imperial oil fell
