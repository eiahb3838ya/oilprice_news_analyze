update 1-germany boosts funding to avert driving bans to around 2 bln euros
berlin reuters germany is doubling the funds to help municipalities avoid driving bans for old diesel vehicles to around billion euros billion chancellor angela merkel said on monday
the government had previously pledged billion euros to help improve air quality but after meeting with municipal representatives on monday merkel said this program would be increased to billion euros by
she said the federal government would also set aside an additional million euros for hardware retrofits of small trucks with older diesel engines
the government has been pushing carmakers to shoulder more of the burden of retrofitting cars with insufficient exhaust filtering systems following scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of polluting emissions from diesel cars
environmental activists have sued municipalities and cities to force bans of heavily polluting vehicles in areas where levels of toxic nitrogen oxide violate european clean air standards
one way to clean up older diesel cars is to fit more effective exhaust filters to cars
the issue of hardware retrofits which municipalities want was not resolved at monday s meeting
german transport minister andreas scheuer said his ministry would by the end of present guidelines on manufacturing improvements that would help curtail nitrogen oxide emissions
he said he expected it to take around six months after that to develop hardware retrofits and those would then need to be approved by the federal motor transport authority too
last month a german court ruled the western state of north must ban older diesel vehicles in gelsenkirchen and essen
other german cities also face the risk of diesel driving bans imposed by judges including aachen berlin frankfurt stuttgart duesseldorf and mainz
merkel said german cities had nitrogen oxide concentrations below the eu limit of micrograms per cubic meter while cities had higher concentrations than that
of those cities had a reading between and micograms and should therefore not have driving bans because the measures already agreed are expected reduce the concentrations quickly merkel said
