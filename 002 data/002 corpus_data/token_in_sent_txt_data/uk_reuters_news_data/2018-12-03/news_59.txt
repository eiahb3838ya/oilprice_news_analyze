insight-betting on ethanol, brazilian mills turn sour on sugar
paulo reuters brazilian sugar companies are increasing their capacity to produce ethanol in the face of depressed global sugar prices and government policies expected to boost demand for the biofuel
a shift to ethanol in the season slashed brazil s sugar output by million tonnes to a low and more switching to the biofuel next season could help to wipe out a global surplus weighing on sugar prices
brazil could also lose its crown as the world s biggest sugar producer to india for the first time in years according to the department of agriculture
for brazilian sugar cane processors switching to ethanol has proved an attractive as the increased focus on the biofuel partly shielded mills from a plunge in global sugar prices in september to their lowest since
executives at major brazilian sugar firms biosev and usina coruripe as well as smaller producers such as usina batatais and usina cerradao told reuters they were now investing in more ethanol capacity ahead of next season
biosev for example brazil s second largest cane processor said it was installing distillation columns at two plants in the mato grosso do sul cluster to give the mills the option of using percent of their cane for ethanol up from percent now
in another sign the industry is making a bet on ethanol in step with brazil biofuels policy jw a leading brazilian ethanol equipment maker told reuters it has hired people to cope with a surge in orders
brazil first rolled out policies to use more biofuels in after opec s supply embargo drove up oil prices
cars that run on pure ethanol or a blend now make up percent of brazil s light vehicle fleet
in a new push the government this year approved a program called renovabio that mandates fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell from
brazil s ministry of mines and energy expects renovabio to push demand to billion liters in from billion in helping brazil s ethanol industry recover from years of competition with subsidized gasoline prices
investments are only made looking into the long term said plinio nastari chief analyst at brazilian consultancy datagro
part of these investments are being made because of the establishment of these targets

this season brazilian mills earmarked percent of cane to ethanol as domestic sales surged by some percent due to high gasoline prices in brazil the world s fourth largest consumer of transportation fuel
many mills can already churn out sugar or ethanol with some flexibility on the mix
the firms investing in distillation columns hope the reconfigurations will give them the scope to produce even more ethanol if prices remain attractive
besides biosev which is controlled by commodities trader louis dreyfus usina coruripe a top brazilian cane processor said it plans to invest about million reais million to crush more cane and increase its ethanol capacity
our mix is still very high on sugar due to the configuration of the plants but we are seeking to change that chief executive mario lorencatto told reuters
usina batatais a company that can crush million tonnes of cane per crop at its two mills said changes it made last season at one of its plants in sao paulo state meant it could allocate as much as percent to ethanol
we almost doubled hydrous ethanol production from last year to this luiz gustavo junqueira innovation manager at usina batatais told reuters
while investments vary a mill can spend about million reais to add a distillation column that boosts ethanol output by million liters said willian hernandes partner at financial advisors which helps mills raise capital
hernandes said three firms could start expanding capacity as soon as this month ahead of the next sugar cane crop in april
mills are also investing in storage tanks so they can hold onto ethanol and sell it when prices are higher said alexandre figliolino a former investment banker now advising sugar and ethanol companies
brazil s dramatic switch to ethanol this season slashed its sugar production by percent and if ethanol remains attractive next season mills could allocate more cane to the biofuel
with all the plans we have heard about mills could probably take another million tonnes of sugar out of the market next season hernandes said
the department of agriculture and the international sugar organization both expect india to eclipse brazil in as the world s largest sugar producer
ethanol s appeal over sugar is influenced by several factors including gasoline prices and the brazilian currency so it s still uncertain how much cane will go to ethanol in
with no renovabio in place yet i say we looking at the same old situation said eder vieito senior commodity analyst at green pool
if the world needs sugar sugar prices will move to a price level that ethanol ca match without losing significant demand to gasoline
a weakening in the real and crude oil has dragged down the price at which sugar is on a par with ethanol to just above analysts estimate
but that s still above sugar prices now of about cents
prices are still sending to producers the signal to maintain a strong ethanol focus next year said datagro s nastari said
however dwindling sugar stocks in brazil have supported domestic prices which could spur a increase in production
it is also unclear whether brazil s incoming president jair bolsonaro will maintain the policy of aligning domestic fuel prices with global prices
while it has improved the competitiveness of ethanol by removing price caps on gasoline higher prices at the pump have angered many brazilians
sugar also holds an appeal for mills because producers can hedge returns with futures contracts a mechanism that doesn t yet exist for the domestic ethanol market said john stansfield analyst and trader at group sopex
outside brazil the ethanol market looks set to expand as well thanks to policies designed to lower emissions
ethanol and sugar consultancy
licht expects global demand to rise at least percent a year over the next decade
and while brazilian ethanol often can not compete with supplies brazil s ethanol has a lower carbon footprint that could appeal to governments striving to meet paris climate agreement commitments
colombia for example is one of several countries changing biofuel policies to prioritize the use of varieties with a lower carbon footprint
brazilian ethanol has begun trickling into the state of california this year because fuel distributors can earn more credits under the state s decarbonization scheme
in comparison to local biofuels such as corn ethanol cane ethanol from brazil has a much lower carbon footprint said
licht managing director christoph berg
it s therefore a relatively attractive high tariffs still pose a barrier in many countries including china where brazilian ethanol is subject to a percent duty though analysts say trade tensions between washington and beijing could provide an opportunity
at the moment it does not seem to be around the corner that china would reduce the import tariff on brazilian ethanol berg said
but they would be competitive if the tariff is reporting by ana ionova and marcelo teixeira editing by david clarke
