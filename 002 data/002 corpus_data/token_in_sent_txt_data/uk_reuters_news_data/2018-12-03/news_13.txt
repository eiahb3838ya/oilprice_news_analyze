rpt-explainer-why is canada's alberta forcing oil production cuts?
repeats with no change in text by julie gordon dec reuters alberta premier rachel notley said on sunday that the western canadian province would mandate temporary oil output cuts to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to a glut of crude in storage and driven down canadian crude prices
the production caps are the latest effort by the province s new democratic party government to deal with historically low crude prices that are hurting producers and dragging on government revenues
western canada select wcs heavy blend crude typically trades at a discount to the west texas intermediate wti benchmark with the lower price reflecting the cost of transport and the quality of the product
the discount has typically been around but has widened in the past few months to trade at to below wti hitting a record at below wti in october according to data from shorcan
crude production in alberta s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity creating a bottleneck and leading to a buildup of product in storage
more crude is now moving across the border by rail and by truck but it is not enough to clear the glut
the stranded barrels are putting pressure on prices
adding to the woes refinery maintenance has taken some buyers temporarily offline
the steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the canadian economy by some estimates
new pipeline capacity is alberta s preferred solution but projects face fierce opposition from environmentalists and some aboriginal groups
construction is under way on enbridge inc s line pipeline replacement from alberta to the united states with the project expected to be in service by the end of
transcanada corp s keystone xl pipeline from alberta to the united states is facing a supplementary environmental assessment after a federal judge in montana halted construction last month
the impact on timing remains unclear
the near tripling of capacity on the trans mountain pipeline from alberta to a port in the vancouver area is undergoing a new regulatory review
it is unclear when construction on the federal pipeline will begin
crude by rail has ramped up sharply this year hitting nearly bpd in september
alberta said last week that it would buy locomotives and rail cars to add an additional bpd of crude by rail capacity
it expects the first trains to be running by december with all online by august
crude by rail will narrow the differential but not as much as pipelines
the most effective solution is production cuts but they are not universally popular with producers
canadian natural resources ltd and cenovus energy inc have voluntarily curtailed production in recent weeks
but other majors like suncor energy inc and husky energy inc which have refineries and are therefore sheltered from the worst of the price impact do not want to cut output
dealing with the low crude prices is essential for notley who faces an election no later than the end of may
her party faces a tough challenge from the united conservative party led by jason kenney a former cabinet minister with the federal conservatives
