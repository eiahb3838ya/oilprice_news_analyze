update 6-gas-focused qatar to exit opec in swipe at saudi influence
doha reuters qatar said it will quit opec to focus on gas in a swipe at saudi arabia the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide
doha one of opec s smallest oil producers but the world s biggest liquefied natural gas lng exporter is embroiled in a row with opec members saudi arabia and the united arab emirates
it said the surprise decision to exit opec which has members including qatar in january was not driven by politics and it did not name saudi arabia but minister of state for energy affairs saad said we are not saying we are going to get out of the oil business but it is controlled by an organisation managed by a country said
qatar would attend an opec meeting scheduled for thursday and friday in vienna and would abide by its commitments he said adding that doha would focus on its gas potential
this was because it was not practical to put efforts and resources and time in an organisation that we are a very small player in and i don t have a say in what happens he added
for a graphic on qatar lng and oil exports see opec members saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and fellow arab states bahrain and egypt have imposed a political and economic boycott on qatar since june accusing it of supporting terrorism which doha denies
qatar s former prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassim said on twitter that opec is only used for purposes that hurt our national interests
the united arab emirates said doha s decision was a reflection of its declining influence
the political aspect of qatar s decision to quit opec is an admission of the decline of its role and influence in light of its political isolation anwar gargash uae minister of state for foreign affairs said on twitter
opec s loss of a member undermines a bid to show a united front before a meeting that is expected to back a supply cut to shore up prices
benchmark brent is trading at around a barrel down from more than in october
they are not a big producer but have played a big part in opec s history one opec source said
it highlights the growing dominance over policy making in the oil market of saudi arabia russia and the united states the world s top three oil producers which together account for more than a third of global output
riyadh and moscow have been increasingly deciding output policies together under pressure from president donald trump on opec to bring down prices
it could signal a historic turning point of the organisation towards russia saudi arabia and the united states said algeria s former energy minister and opec chairman chakib khelil commenting on qatar s move
for a graphic on who produces what within opec see he said doha s exit would have a psychological impact because of the row with riyadh and could prove an example to be followed by other members in the wake of unilateral decisions of saudi arabia in the recent qatar which said had been a member of opec for years has oil output of just barrels per day bpd compared with saudi arabia s million bpd
but doha is an influential player in the global lng market with annual production of million tonnes per year based on its huge reserves in the gulf
for a graphic on the world biggest lng exporters see who is heading qatar s opec delegation said the decision was part of a strategy and the country s plans to develop its gas industry and increase lng output to million tonnes by
i assure you this purely was a decision on what s right for qatar long term
it s a strategy decision said
the exit is the latest example of qatar charting a course away from its gulf neighbours since the rift began last year
it comes before an annual summit of gulf arab states expected to grapple with the roughly standoff
once close partners with saudi arabia and the uae on trade and security qatar has struck scores of new trade deals with countries further afield while investing heavily to scale up local food production and ramp up military power
there is a sentiment in qatar that saudi arabia s dominance in the region and the region s many institutions has been counterproductive to qatar said andreas krieg a political risk analyst at king s college london
it is about qatar breaking free as an independent market and state from external oil surged about percent on monday after the united states and china agreed to a truce in their trade war but prices remain well off october s peak
asked if qatar s withdrawal would complicate opec s decision on output this week a opec source said not really even if it s a regrettable and sad said state oil company qatar petroleum planned to raise its production capability from million barrels of oil equivalent per day to million barrels in the next decade
doha also plans to build the largest ethane cracker in the middle east and it would still look to expand its oil investments abroad added
