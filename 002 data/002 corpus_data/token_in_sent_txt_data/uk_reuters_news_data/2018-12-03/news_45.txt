special report-u.s. 'clean coal' program fails to deliver on smog cuts
reuters champions of coal say the superabundant fossil fuel can be made environmentally friendlier by refining it with chemicals a clean coal technology backed by a billion dollars in government tax subsidies annually
but refined coal has a dirty secret
it regularly fails to deliver on its environmental promises as electric giant duke energy corp found
duke began using refined coal at two of its north carolina power plants in august
the decision let the company tap a lucrative federal subsidy designed to help the american coal industry reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides also known as nox the main contributor to smog and acid rain along with other pollutants
in nearly three years of burning the treated coal the duke power plants collected several million dollars in federal subsidies
but the plants also pumped out more nox not less according to data from the environmental protection agency analysed by reuters
the nox emission rate at duke s marshall steam station power plant in sherrills ford north carolina for example was between percent and percent higher in the three years from to than in the year before marshall started burning refined coal the epa data shows
the utility also discovered that one of the chemicals used to refine the coal calcium bromide had reached a nearby river and lakes raising levels of carcinogens in the water supply for more than a million people in greater stopped using refined coal at the plants in may because of the water pollution problems said spokeswoman erin culbert
bromide levels in the region s drinking water dropped sharply several months later said barry gullett the city s water director in a memo
duke s experience reflects a fundamental problem with the clean coal incentive programme a reuters examination has found
refined coal shows few signs of reducing nox emissions as lawmakers intended according to regulatory documents a reuters analysis of epa emissions data and interviews with power plant owners scientists and state environmental regulators
consumption figures compiled by the energy information administration show that american power plants are on track to burn about million tons of clean coal in a fifth of the coal market
that amount would generate about billion in incentives at the current tax credit amount of per ton
but most of the plants receiving the subsidy failed to reduce nox emissions by percent the threshold required under the policy in compared to the last year before they started burning refined coal according to a reuters analysis of epa data on power plant emissions
reuters identified plants that burned refined coal in using data from the energy information administration and disclosures from energy companies and developers
only of that group reduced nox emissions by more than percent in compared to
and of those only reported the improvements after installing or upgrading pollution control equipment or switching a portion of power production to fuel complicating the question of whether their pollution reductions are attributable to refined coal
at of the plants nox emissions were higher in while burning refined coal than they were when using raw coal in
as a group the fleet of power plants that burn refined coal also underperformed the rest of the industry in cutting emissions of nox the reuters analysis found
nox emissions rates declined percent among the power plants that reported burning refined coal in
that compares with a percent reduction by other power plants over the same period
the analysis included power plants with at least tons in annual nox emissions in
investors in plants that failed to show substantial nox emission cuts collected the tax credit anyway because the internal revenue service allows them to prove emissions reductions with laboratory tests
the results of those tests conducted for several hours a couple of times a year often do not translate to improvements at plants that burn millions of tons of coal annually
the irs which approves applications for the tax credit declined to comment on the design or effectiveness of the testing regimen
it s hard to hang your hat on refined coal as the way to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions said ron sahu an environmental engineer who has consulted with utility companies the epa and the justice department on power plant emissions
sahu who reviewed the data and methodology used by reuters said the analysis shows refined coal has little to no impact in reducing nox emissions at actual power plants
it s clear that any benefit from refined coal can easily be overwhelmed by modest changes in combustion conditions at power plants sahu said
it s debatable that a tax credit should be given for nox reuters sent its analysis of epa emissions data to every major utility operating power plants that burn clean coal along with the leading investors who finance clean coal facilities in partnerships designed to take advantage of the subsidy
most companies declined to comment or did not respond
the handful that did respond did not contest the findings of the analysis
we do agree with the overall assessment that emission controls have a more measurable impact on emissions reductions over refined coal dte energy a utility that uses refined coal told reuters
the edison electric institute which represents the electric utility industry did not respond to requests for comment
the law requires all refined coal producers seeking the subsidy to show that burning their product can lead to a percent cut in nox emissions
the producers also must show a percent reduction in either mercury or sulphur dioxide
they are given the choice of which of those two pollutants to target
refined coal investors tend to target mercury as the second pollutant for cuts according to disclosures by the corporations involved in the programme
that s because reducing mercury emissions with refined coal is a way for plants to comply with other relatively new epa regulations governing the pollutant
utilities already have spent tens of billions of dollars on equipment to filter out sulphur dioxide making additional reductions of that gas more difficult
the subsidy programme has been more successful at combating mercury than nox the analysis found
the mercury emission rate at power plants burning refined coal product for example fell percent between and more than the percent cut required to qualify for the subsidy
some of those cuts can also be attributed to other pollution control measures such as the installation of scrubbers that filter coal plant exhaust according to the epa
high exposure to mercury can damage the intestines kidney and nervous system according to the epa
sulphur dioxide and nox can cause lung damage
the refined coal subsidy was adopted by congress and signed into law by president george bush as part of the american jobs creation act of alongside credits for generating renewable energy from solar and wind
the legislation had broad bipartisan support and generated little public debate
the subsidy is set to expire in and lawmakers including north dakota republican congressman kevin cramer are moving to extend it for another decade
the programme is bridging the divide to make coal clean and beautiful said cramer borrowing president donald trump s two favourite adjectives to describe coal
trump has promised to advance the interests of the coal industry to support energy jobs
his administration has argued coal provides a more reliable fuel for power generation than natural gas solar and wind which can be more easily interrupted by pipeline problems or uncooperative weather
the white house did not respond to requests for comment
in one of the industry s first refined coal ventures power plant operator associated electric cooperative inc in signed a deal with affiliates of goldman sachs group inc to burn refined coal at the new madrid and thomas hill power plants in missouri
as a tax credit investor goldman worked with advanced emissions solutions inc to build refined coal facilities next to the cooperative s power plants
a refined coal operation typically costs about million to develop featuring new conveyor belts and sprayers to move and treat the coal with chemicals according to presentations to investors by advanced emissions
silos also are installed to store the refined coal chemicals
the deal called for the utility to sell raw coal to the investment group at cost and then buy it back at a discount after it was treated saving the utility millions of dollars disclosures show
goldman and its investment partners collected about million in gross tax credits from the program in based on an estimate in associated s annual report that its plants used million tons of coal that year
goldman sachs declined to comment
associated had no upfront cost for the refined coal facility and contributes nothing to its annual operating costs
it forecast the arrangement would bring in million to million in annual revenue through at least
the project at first was questioned as simply too good to be true the utility wrote in its anniversary report released in
the deal also illustrates how the potential benefits of refined coal on air quality can be erased by a variety of complex factors
the new madrid plant in southeast missouri for example has seen its production of nox soar to a higher rate than any other coal plant while burning refined coal
in the plant s nox emission rate was percent higher than it recorded in before new madrid started burning clean coal according to the epa
during the first quarter of the rate jumped even further to seven times the level
associated electric said the increase in nox emissions at new madrid was due in part to the cooperative s purchasing tradable pollution credits through the system
the system sets an overall limit on pollution and allows power plants that cut their pollution to earn credits that can be stockpiled or sold to other polluters
when large volumes of credits are generated the cost of buying them can be lower than the cost of running pollution control equipment
at times during the last seven years associated has met compliance with emissions rules by purchasing nox credits from the markets rather than running the control equipment all year the electric cooperative said in a statement which it issued through goldman sachs spokesman michael duvally
the national mining association which represents the coal industry supports extending the tax credit
it said the system was the primary reason nox emissions went up at many power plants in the reuters analysis
the association said clean coal lowers emissions but provided no data to support the claim
duke energy said in a statement that routine changes in electricity demand can also make clean coal ineffective in reducing nox by changing boiler temperatures and catalyst conditions in pollution control devices
sahu the environmental consultant said refined coal is most effective at reducing nox emissions when a utility burns the fuel at a relatively low temperature something that typically occurs when electricity demands on the plant are low
but using low temperatures over an extended period can also damage power plant boilers by causing corrosion and soot buildup he said
conversely burning the coal at a relatively high temperature more common during periods can reduce the risk of damage but limit the effectiveness of smog reductions
the grand river dam authority stopped burning refined coal at its oklahoma power plant last year because corrosion and other problems outweighed any upside said john wiscaver head of grda s corporate communications
we had too many problems with refined coal he said
refined coal has also led to contamination of water supplies for more than a million people according to regulators and utility officials
in the south carolina department of health environmental control noticed elevated levels of bromides the chemicals used to treat refined coal in the santee moultrie public water system said tommy crosby a spokesman for the agency
the south carolina plant s refined coal operation stopped spraying bromide on the coal burned at the cross generating station out of concern for the elevated levels of trihalomethanes crosby said and the levels decreased within six months
trihalomethanes are created when bromide mixes with the chlorine in treated drinking water
the plant s refined coal facility was financed by global insurance firm aj gallagher mutual fund giant fidelity and a subsidiary of france s schneider electric se
fidelity declined to comment on the elevated tthm levels and pointed out that federal limits were not exceeded
schneider electric and aj gallagher declined to comment
the north carolina town of mooresville downstream of duke s marshall power plant saw its trihalomethanes surge as high as parts per billion at times in after the facility discharged bromide used to treat coal into a nearby lake according to the town s drinking water quality report
that did not trigger a violation of federal clean water rules because the town s annual average of parts per billion that year was below the maximum trihalomethane contaminant level of parts per billion
the same was true of the south carolina plant where trihalomethane levels in rose to parts per billion
over the past decade however many studies have shown that exposure to trihalomethanes at much lower levels than the federal limit raises the risk of cancer and of problems during pregnancy
some people who drink water containing tthms in excess of the maximum standard over many years may experience problems with their liver kidneys or central nervous system and may have an increased risk of getting cancer according to the epa
in the epa included bromide in the safe water drinking act as an unregulated contaminant to be monitored by public water systems
research by jeanne vanbriesen director of carnegie mellon university s center for water quality in urban environmental systems found that bromide additives used to reduce mercury could significantly boost trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies downstream of coal plants
her study focussed on drinking water systems serving million people in pennsylvania
once duke energy halted refined coal operations at the north carolina plant bromide dropped about percent in the nearby catawba river zachary hall director of environmental science at duke said in a february deposition given to the southern environmental law center
duke officials concede that bromide applications contributed to the elevated trihalomethane levels
while bromides from our facilities were not the sole cause duke s culbert said we felt it was important to partner with downstream water utilities and suspend the reporting by tim mclaughlin editing by richard valdmanis and brian thevenot
