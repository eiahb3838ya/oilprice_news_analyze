canada's frontera stops production after attack on peru oil pipeline
lima dec reuters canadian oil company frontera energy said on monday it had stopped production at peru s largest oilfield after a pipeline was severed last week by indigenous protesters
frontera energy said in a statement that production at the oilfield located kilometers miles from the pipeline rupture would stop while authorities worked to resolve the dispute with the community
oil company petroperu which operates the pipeline flagged on friday that frontera may be forced to halt production and estimated that losses could amount to around per day
last week a group of residents in an amazon region inhabited by the indigenous mayuriaga community severed the pipeline and then prevented technicians from repairing it according to petroperu
frontera said that the company expects to restart operations shortly after the pipeline is repaired
recent net production at the oilfield has averaged barrels per day
petroperu estimates that the rupture may have caused some barrels of oil to spill although the company said that oil has not contaminated water sources in the area
the company has shut off crude oil from flowing through the pipeline
frontera energy temporarily operates lot a production site which is located in the amazon region of loreto and has around million barrels in reserves
the company s contract expires in march
the kilometer pipeline that transports crude from the oil fields of the peruvian jungle to the petroperu refinery on the pacific coast has suffered dozens of attacks since it began operating four decades ago
since nearly barrels of oil have been spilled from the pipeline in at least attacks and another barrels have leaked due to corrosion of mechanical failures according to official estimates
