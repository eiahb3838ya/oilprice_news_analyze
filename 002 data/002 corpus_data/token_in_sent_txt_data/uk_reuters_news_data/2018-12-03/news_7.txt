update 1-eu proposes restoring anti-subsidy duties on argentine biodiesel - document
paris reuters the european commission has proposed reinstating duties on imports of argentine biodiesel after massive shipments of cheap biodiesel from latin america into the european union threatened its industry an eu document seen by reuters shows
the plan follows an investigation requested by eu producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil which have been hit hard by cheap imports since the eu slashed duties last year in response to a ruling by the world trade organization
the proposal needs to be approved by eu member states
the european commission decided not to reinstate provisional import tariffs on argentine biodiesel in september though it considered imports were subsidised and a threat to the eu industry saying it needed to collect further information
on the basis of the conclusions reached by the commission a definitive countervailing duty should be imposed to prevent the materialisation of the imminent threat of material injury caused to the union industry by the subsidised imports the commission said in its proposal
proposed duties range from percent to percent depending on companies the document showed
the eu s removal of duties on biodiesel from argentina as well as from indonesia last september and subsequent surge in imports has forced european producers to cut production
even if this still needs to be confirmed by member states it is good news for the industry european biodiesel board chairwoman kristell guizouarn told reuters
