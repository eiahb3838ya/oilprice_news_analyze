adds world bank ceo comment reaction by megan rowling katowice poland dec thomson reuters foundation the world bank will give equal weight to curbing emissions and helping poor countries deal with the disastrous effects of a warming world as it steps up investments to tackle climate change in the first half of the it said on monday
the bank and its two sister organisations plan to double their investments in climate action to about billion from with a boost in support for efforts to adapt to higher temperatures wilder weather and rising seas
the latest figures on international climate funding for developing nations show barely a quarter has been going to adaptation with the bulk backing clean energy adoption and more efficient energy use aimed at cutting emissions
we live in a new normal in which disasters are more severe and more frequent world bank ceo kristalina georgieva told the thomson reuters foundation at climate talks in poland
we have to prioritise adaptation everywhere but especially in the most vulnerable parts of the world she said pointing to the horn of africa and the sahel coastal regions and small island states
of the billion the world bank plans to make available in the five years from half would go to adaptation measures it said
those include building more robust homes schools and infrastructure preparing farmers for climate shifts managing water wisely and protecting people s incomes through social safety nets georgieva added
the world bank said the money would also improve weather forecasts and provide early warning and climate information services for million people in developing countries
climate change is an existential threat to the world s poorest and most vulnerable
these new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue world bank group president jim yong kim said in a statement
from the world bank spent nearly billion on adaptation which accounted for just over percent of the climate benefits generated by the institution s funding overall
former ban said the bank s pledge to use half its climate finance to find solutions to deal with changing weather patterns was important
climate change is already having a disastrous impact on people right around the world and we are nearing the point of no return said ban
so we must take bold action to adapt to the reality of the threat facing us a recently launched global commission on adaptation which ban chairs with georgieva and microsoft bill gates aims to put political muscle behind efforts to keep people safer in a hotter world
the remaining billion in promised world bank group funding will come from the international finance corporation ifc which works with the private sector and the multilateral investment guarantee agency as well as private capital the group raises
there are literally trillions of dollars of opportunities for the private sector to invest in projects that will help save the planet said ifc chief philippe le hou√©rou
the ifc will identify opportunities use tools to make investments less risky and attract cash in areas including renewable energy green buildings clean transport in cities and urban waste management he added
marshall islands president hilda heine said her pacific island state was struggling with fiercer storms and increasing seawater flooding that is contaminating fresh water with salt
the new world bank funds would help to build resilience make us safer and improve lives she said
global action needs to accelerate before it is too late she added
the big shift global coalition of aid agencies and climate justice campaigners said the world bank group s new commitment signalled that developing countries should receive far more support to tackle climate change
but it overlooked the desperate need to radically scale up financing for renewable energy to help the poorest gain access to electricity they added
