interview-iran says opec members who increased output should take lead on cuts
london reuters qatar s decision to quit opec shows the frustration of small producers at the dominant role of a saudi and panel a top iranian official said adding that any supply cuts should come only from countries that had increased output
the comments underline tensions within the organization of the petroleum exporting countries ahead of this week s meeting to discuss curbing output and prolonging a pact with russia and other into
iran has been angered by higher production from saudi arabia and russia which chair a panel called the joint ministerial monitoring committee jmmc after calls from president donald trump to pump more oil to offset a drop in iranian exports hit by sanctions
this is very regrettable and we understand their frustration iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters referring to doha s announcement on monday
there are many other opec members frustrated that the jmmc is deciding on production unilaterally and without the required prior consensus of oil prices have fallen from a high above a barrel in early october on concerns over excess supply
opec and its allies which have had a supply pact since meet in vienna on thursday and friday to discuss supply cuts
since may they have inflicted a loss on all members kazempour said in reference to the jmmc flooded the market and created a huge glut which is building stocks
with this behavior for small producers there is no merit to stay in iran believes that any supply reduction should come from those who pumped more saudi arabia and russia have provided the largest increases rather than all opec and countries involved in the current accord
now they are asking others to share in the cut
whoever increased they should cut kazempour said
the pilot and crashed the plane and all passengers are now in critical condition
with this record of failure i doubt that the declaration of cooperation will be russia and saudi arabia by contrast want to renew and institutionalize the cooperation deal
