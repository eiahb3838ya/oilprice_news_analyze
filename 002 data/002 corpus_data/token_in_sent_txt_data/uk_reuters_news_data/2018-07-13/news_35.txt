shandong refiner haiyou extends crude unit shutdown indefinitely - sources
beijing july reuters independent chinese refiner shandong haiyou petrochemical group has no definite plan to reopen its crude oil distillation unit cdu after shutting it down sometime in late may two industry sources with knowledge of the plant s operation said on friday
the plant in the city of rizhao in shandong province owns a cdu with a capacity of around barrels per day bpd which it shut down after a local government order to cut down pollution ahead of a regional summit in june the sources said
haiyou however will keep open its million delayed coker a unit that processes residual fuel oil into lighter refined products such as diesel and gasoline said one of the sources
falling profit margins following beijing s move to tighten tax rules for independent oil refiners and blenders could be one reason for haiyou s extended shutdown the two sources said
haiyou s large debt burden could be another reason as the plant struggles to secure financing for oil purchases said the second source who has knowledge of the plant s financial status
haiyou has an annual crude oil import quota of million tonnes
both sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to press
multiple calls to the company went unanswered
