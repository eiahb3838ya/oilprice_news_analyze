aker bp chief executive karl johnny hersvik said activity at the valhall ip water injection and valhall dp drilling platforms would stop if the strike escalated
if the strike is prolonged it will have later in the year impact on when wells are back in production if that is going to happen it means the strike has to be quite long he said during the firm s results presentation
aker bp later told reuters a strike of a month to six weeks could impact output at the field by a few thousands barrels per day
some of the wells that are drilled are planned to be put in production at the end of this year
