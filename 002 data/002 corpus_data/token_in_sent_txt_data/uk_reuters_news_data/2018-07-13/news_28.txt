us rejects french request for iran exemptions, le maire tells le figaro
paris july reuters the united states has rejected a french request for waivers for its companies operating in iran that paris sought after president donald trump imposed sanctions on the islamic republic french finance minister bruno le maire told le figaro
paris had singled out key areas where it expected either exemptions or extended periods for french companies including energy banking pharmaceuticals and automotive
french officials had expressed little hope for securing the waivers which were critical for oil and gas major total to continue a gas project in iran and for carmaker psa group to pursue its joint venture
we have just received treasury secretary steve mnuchin s response it s negative le maire told le figaro in an interview published on friday
le maire said europe needed to react quickly and protect its economic sovereignty
europe must provide itself with the tools it needs to defend itself against sanctions le maire added
washington announced in may it was imposing new economic penalties on tehran after pulling out of a multilateral agreement under which tehran had agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief
trump s sanctions are aimed at pressuring iran to negotiate a new agreement to halt its nuclear programmes that might include tehran s regional activities and ballistics development
in particular washington wants to curtail the oil exports that are key to iran s economic revival
earlier this month iranian president hassan rouhani appeared to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from its neighbours if washington pressed ahead with trying to force countries to stop buying iranian oil
