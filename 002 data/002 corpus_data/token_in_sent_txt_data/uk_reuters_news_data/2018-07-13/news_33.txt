update 1-china's june crude imports at 6-mth low as "teapot" buying slows; gas imports strong
beijing reuters china s crude oil imports fell for a second month in a row in june to the lowest since december as shrinking margins and volatile oil prices led some independent refiners known as teapots to scale back purchases
june shipments came in at million tonnes or million barrels per day bpd according to data from the general administration of customs
that was down percent from million bpd in may and also down from million bpd in june last year
thomson reuters oil research had pegged china s crude oil arrivals in june at million tonnes
imports for the first half of this year were still up percent from a year earlier at million tonnes or about million bpd the official data showed
while some and independent plants were shut for regular maintenance others took advantage of weakening margins and oil prices at near to conduct extended shutdowns
the numbers are lower than we expected mostly because of slowing down at some teapot plants as they face growing domestic competition in refined fuel supplies and weakening margins said seng yick tee of consultancy sia energy
the oil price volatility is certainly not helping as not many independent plants are doing sophisticated shandong shengxing chemical group shut its crude oil unit at the end of april and only expects to resume operations around
shandong haiyou petrochemical a teapot with annual import quotas of million tonnes has kept its crude unit shut since late may without a definite date to reopen
imports of oil products fell percent to million tonnes while oil product exports fell percent to million tonnes data showed
however total gas imports in june including pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas rose to million tonnes up percent from a year ago customs said
imports hit million tonnes percent higher than the same period in
gas maintained high growth as demand remained strong for storage fills as well as for industrial uses
local governments are rolling out hikes in benchmark gas prices for residential use following a policy change by beijing in may to unify residential prices with industrial users
in a boost for gas producers the change effectively removes subsidies for the residential sector
