column-paper crude market says u.s. oil should flood asia, physical says not: russell
launceston australia reuters a tsunami of crude oil should be headed toward asia according to pricing on futures exchanges but the reality in the physical market tells a somewhat different story
the discount in the futures markets of the main light crude grade west texas intermediate wti to the global benchmark brent crude stood at a barrel on june the widest in more than three years
and it s not just a aberration with wti s discount to brent for crude for delivery in six months at a barrel on june the most since september
the pricing of wti and brent suggest that crude is now so cheap compared to its main competitor that refiners across the world but especially in the main consuming region of asia should be snapping up vast quantities
there is some evidence to suggest that this has happened in recent weeks with data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts pointing to record arrivals of crude in asia in june
about barrels per day bpd of crude is expected to land at asian ports in june up from bpd in may which was the previous high for crude exports to asia
while there may be scope for exports to push higher in coming months they will probably be limited by both infrastructure constraints and a weakening of the economics
while the paper futures market makes a compelling case for crude exports pricing in the physical markets is far less convincing
graphic angola girassol wti houston crude https the price of wti crude at houston as assessed by argus media was a barrel on june a premium of a barrel or percent to wti futures on the new york mercantile exchange
that means an asian buyer of physical wti crude for loading in texas is paying quite a significant premium over the price of paper oil in the futures market
the premium has risen sharply in recent weeks given that it was closer to a barrel at the end of april
further out along the curve also shows a widening premium for physical wti crude over the futures with december houston wti being a barrel more expensive than the equivalent futures contract as at the end of may
while physical wti crude is currently at a strong premium to the futures the opposite is the case when comparing paper brent crude to the prices of similar physical grades
brent futures closed at a barrel on june above the for nigeria s bonny light and the for angola s girassol grade
putting the numbers together shows that an asian refiner seeking light sweet crude could have on june bought a cargo from angola at just cents a barrel more than one from houston
this small advantage in favour of wti from houston would more than likely be eaten up by the increase in shipping costs given that texas is a far longer voyage to asia than is angola
overall the seemingly huge advantage that wti enjoys over crudes priced against brent disappears once you make the jump from the paper to the physical markets
while arbitrage investors may enjoy such a situation the current pricing of physical crude oil suggests that shipments to asia may struggle to be competitive in the second half of the year
one side issue worth mentioning is the potential impact of geopolitical concerns
if china and the united states do manage to reach some kind of trade consensus it may encourage chinese buying of crude even if it doesn t necessarily make economic sense
on the other hand an escalating trade dispute may see china s refiners take less crude and so far it s far from certain which is the more likely of those two outcomes
