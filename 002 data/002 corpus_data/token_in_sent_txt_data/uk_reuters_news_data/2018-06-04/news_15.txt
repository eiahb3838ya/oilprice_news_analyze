saudi aramco restructures non-oil assets ahead of ipo - sources
dhahran saudi reuters saudi aramco has created a subsidiary to house its pension fund and could spin off its aviation division sources said as it restructures some assets not related to oil and gas ahead of its planned initial public offering ipo
the move is designed to streamline aramco s operations and could make it easier to value since its business risk would be clearer and that may help it achieve a higher price for its shares financial and industry sources told reuters
this makes aramco a leaner company said one source familiar with aramco s plans
the oil giant declined to comment on the pension fund move or plans for its aviation division
the listing of aramco which is likely to happen next year is the centerpiece of the government s ambitious vision plan to diversify the kingdom s economy beyond oil
crown prince mohammed has said he expects the ipo to value aramco at a minimum of trillion meaning a sale of percent could raise billion to help fund vision projects
analysts have valued aramco at trillion to trillion
saudi arabia has often tasked aramco with carrying out government projects that have social goals and are too big or daunting for the private sector such as building industrial cities stadiums and cultural centers
the world s largest oil exporter also has its own schools housing airline fleet and hospitals that are used by its roughly employees as well as their families
but potential investors in what is expected to the biggest ipo in history may not want exposure to such a complicated array of assets that would not be as profitable as aramco s core oil business financial sources said
aramco created a new subsidiary for its retirement fund management unit about six months ago sources familiar with the matter said
the fund now called wisayah is being run by a small team of financial professionals in dhahran where aramco s headquarters is based one of the sources said
this is best practice
it sets up nice clean lines so the money can t be used for other business activities a second source familiar with the move told reuters
besides the pension fund two sources said aramco could spin off some units such as its aviation division by either forming a joint venture to manage it or bringing in an outside company to operate the fleet
aramco aviation operates about jets such as boeing and embraer as well as helicopters that transfer employees and visitors to oil and refining plants across saudi arabia
aramco formed a joint venture with construction firm jacobs engineering group last year to take on the project management of government infrastructure and other projects not related to oil as part of its ipo preparations
another joint venture that falls outside the traditional scope of an oil company is aramco s johns hopkins aramco healthcare company jv created in with the hospital to provide medical care for aramco employees and their families
one source said the joint venture may open up to the public and not just serve the company s employees
aramco has often defended taking on projects outside its core oil and gas business as part of its corporate social responsibility for the community
but aramco s involvement in ventures such as the football stadium in jeddah or managing floodwater drainage there has prompted criticism internally that its manpower is not being used effectively
aramco doesn t only look at its oil and gas related interests but it is also a channel and mechanism for the nation
this drains aramco s resources both in terms of money and its core people said one industry source working in saudi arabia
