u.s. black lung fund will need taxpayer bailout if coal tax falls -gao
washington june reuters a federal fund to help coal miners disabled by black lung disease will require a dollar taxpayer bailout if congress doesn t extend or increase the tax on coal production that funds it according to a government report on monday
coal companies are currently required to pay a per ton tax on underground coal production to finance the federal black lung disability trust fund which pays medical and living expenses for eligible miners but that amount is scheduled to revert back to the level of cents
with the scheduled tax rate decrease our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs as well as debt repayment expenditures according to the report from the government accountability office
cases of black lung an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal dust are rising to levels not seen in decades as miners plumb the depths of played out coal seams using heavy blasting equipment according to government health officials
the fund that helps them is already roughly billion in debt as revenues since it was created in the have failed to keep up with outflows
that debt could balloon to billion by without congressional action the gao report said
the gao offered three options to try to improve the solvency of the fund extend the current excise tax rate to reduce the debt to billion debt by increase the current tax rate by approximately percent to eliminate the debt entirely by or allow the tax rate to sunset as scheduled cancel the current debt and appropriate billion to the fund
that third option would amount to a transfer of liability for black lung victims from coal companies to taxpayers
the coal industry has been lobbying hard against the tax arguing its payments have already been too high at a difficult time for mining companies and that the fund has been abused by undeserving applicants such as smokers
ashley burke spokeswoman for the national mining association rejected the idea the tax should be increased
there is no need for a tax increase on the coal industry
the only reason borrowing has been necessary is for the government to essentially repay itself for accumulated interest payments on legacy debt from the and she said
a bipartisan effort by lawmakers to extend the current coal tax failed earlier this year after the coal industry lobbied republican house leadership not to take it up
democratic congressmen bobby scott of virginia and sander levin of michigan requested the gao study in to clarify the fund s financial condition
scott told reuters the report should compel congress to take action to extend or increase the coal excise tax
the existing black lung excise tax rate on coal companies is imperative to the solvency of the trust fund scott said in a statement
the fund currently provides medical coverage and monthly payments for living expenses to more than people
