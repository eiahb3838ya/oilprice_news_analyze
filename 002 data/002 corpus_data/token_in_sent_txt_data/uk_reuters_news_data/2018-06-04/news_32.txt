shanghai reuters china will crack down further on diesel consumption and support using rail for freight deliveries in its ongoing fight against pollution the official china daily said on monday citing the environment ministry
diesel trucks accounted for just percent of china s total vehicles but contributed as much as percent of the country s total nitrogen oxide emissions and more than three quarters of airborne particulate matter according to data from the ministry of ecology and environment mee
the crackdown will strengthen scrutiny on fuel and engine quality and restrict car freight the china daily said quoting ministry officials
total car ownership reached million last year up percent compared to with vehicles accounting for percent of the total the mee said in a report on vehicle pollution published last friday
it said total pollution discharges from vehicles stood at million tonnes in down percent on the year with the bulk of the emissions consisting of carbon monoxide

in a separate statement the ministry warned that vehicle emissions like nitrogen oxides had fallen much more slowly than others and it promised to speed up the implementation of pollution prevention and control measures for diesel trucks
as part of its war on pollution china has taken more than million outdated vehicles off the roads over the last five years and the country routinely restricts traffic during smog
it has also taken action to limit road deliveries of coal in key regions like and the yangtze river delta
