golar's cameroon flng project starts commercial operations
london reuters golar lng said it had started commercial operations at a pioneering floating liquefied natural gas flng production platform in cameroon million under budget
it is the first flng vessel of its kind and is likely to boost demand for golar s technology in africa and beyond
the hilli episeyo flng vessel converted from an ageing tanker for billion produced the first lng on march but only exported its first cargo in may to china after technical issues delayed a ramp up in production
after continuously producing lng over days at an average of cubic golar s project clients have contractually accepted the facility marking its commercial start golar said in a statement
golar is in talks to develop similar projects in with bp and with ophir energy in equatorial guinea
the successful removes uncertainty about the risks associated with squeezing a liquefaction plant typically spanning hundreds of acres on land into a single ship with four liquefaction units bolted onto its sides
trading companies and oil majors are keen on the technology for its relatively low cost and ability to unlock stranded reserves beyond the reach of pipelines
developer golar provides the liquefaction facility and services under a production tolling agreement with oil firm perenco and cameroon s societe nationale des hydrocarbures snh
all of the plant s million tonne annual output was sold via a competitive tender by perenco to gazprom marketing trading for eight years
in a statement golar lng said commercial tolling fees will add about million to its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization annually plus an estimated million in operating cash flow based on current oil prices
all told the hilly episeyo came in million under budget golar said a rarity in the lng industry where project costs routinely balloon billions of dollars over budget
