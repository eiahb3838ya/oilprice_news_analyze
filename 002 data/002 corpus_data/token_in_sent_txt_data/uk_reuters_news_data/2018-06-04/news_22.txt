airlines adjusting hedges, fares, capacity and fleet as oil price jumps
sydney reuters airlines are locking in fuel hedges lowering capacity raising fares and retiring older jets to cope with rising costs alongside the highest oil prices since industry executives say
the squeeze from fuel costs which have risen much faster than ticket prices poses a particular threat to the industry s profitability
the international air transport association on monday forecast airlines combined profits would be percent lower than it had expected in december at billion in total in large part because of costlier fuel
brent crude is trading at around a barrel up nearly percent from a year ago
at this point with rising fuel you control costs raise prices and you may have some fall off in demand and reduce capacity air new zealand chief executive christopher luxon told reuters on monday
i think we are seeing pricing move up internationally and certainly yields come up as well he added
iata forecast passenger yields a proxy for airfares will rise by percent this year in the first annual gains since as airlines look to recoup rising costs
american airlines ceo doug parker also forecast that fares could rise as capacity is reined in amid higher oil prices
china eastern airlines corp ltd has said it would consider using newly launched oil futures to hedge oil for the first time in a decade but others like emirates and delta air lines have no plans to return to hedging as a result of the recent oil price increases
i think rushing to get hedged when the prices go up is a bit dumb and when they go down they get complacent again capa centre for aviation executive chairman peter harbison said
iata chief economist brian pearce said hedging only delays the impact
it stabilizes earnings it doesn t stop the rising costs happening he said
other carriers such as singapore airlines ltd and air new zealand ltd are at lower prices but are being forced to hedge at higher prices as those contracts end in keeping with their internal policies
for example iag the parent of british airways hedges up to three years in advance on a rolling basis
that means percent of its fuel is hedged for the current first three months a number that drops to percent in the final quarter of the period
whilst most of us have hedging in place that hedging eventually runs out or gets replaced by new positions you have got and it is a question then of what do you do virgin australia holdings ltd ceo john borghetti said
if you look at history typically some of that cost has to be passed on at some point because you just simply can t absorb european carriers are also hedged between and percent as a way to give them better control of costs
we take a simple view that hedging is about buying time it gives you time to address volatility said iag s chief executive willie walsh
the higher oil price is also expected to drive a new cycle of airlines replacing older jets with more efficient newer generation models like the and max narrowbodies and the and widebodies
australia s qantas airways ltd is retiring boeing co more quickly than it had originally forecast and replacing them with
it will be a bittersweet moment when those aircraft will go but it also helps us manage the increase in fuel prices qantas ceo alan joyce said monday
the are going to give us a big benefit this year on our international boeing commercial airplanes vice president of marketing randy tinseth said on sunday that replacement makes sense for airlines when oil reaches a barrel
fuel is definitely an issue and it is eating into profitability said mylene scholnick principal at consultancy icf
when fuel comes down the airlines keep aircraft longer so we had seen ages pushed to years
now with fuel back up it won t bring down the retirement age drastically but will stabilize it at around reporting by jamie freed and victoria bryan editing by gerry doyle
