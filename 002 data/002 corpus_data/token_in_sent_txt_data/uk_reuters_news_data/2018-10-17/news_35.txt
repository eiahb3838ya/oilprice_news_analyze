update 1-france's engie, casino target large-scale rooftop solar
paris reuters french utility engie and retailer casino launched a joint venture on wednesday that will invest some million euros million a year to build solar panels on the rooftops of supermarkets hotels and hospitals in france
engie will work with casino to install solar units with generating capacities of up to megawatt mw on retail industrial and municipal buildings while continuing to build rooftop solar independently for private homes and large solar farms
the joint venture between engie and casino s solar unit greenyellow is called reservoir sun and hopes to install about megawatts mw of rooftop solar capacity per year in france at a rhythm of about one new installation per day
france currently has solar generating capacity of mw
the potential of decentralised solar on rooftops is enormous engie chief executive isabelle kocher told reporters on wednesday at a news conference to launch the venture
over the past decade casino has installed rooftop solar on nearly all its own supermarkets and in the past few years it has also started selling solar plants to customers including competing supermarket chains
greenyellow chief otmane hajji said the firm now has million square metres of solar panels in operation the equivalent of about mw of generating capacity of which about percent is at casino and the rest at customer sites
he estimates that france has some million square metres of rooftop space available for solar
excluding residential rooftop solar greenyellow estimates it has a percent market share in france
other players in industrial rooftop solar are urbasolar quadran engie and the renewables units of edf and total
in a business model similar to tesla unit solarcity the new venture will finance build and operate the solar panels and sell its customers electricity under contracts at rates to percent below regulated power tariffs
at the end of the contract customers will own the panels
reservoir sun will target customers with large and steady power consumption but a typical installation will only cover about percent of a client s power needs because storing power in batteries for nighttime use or selling excess power to the grid is not financially viable for now
the decentralised power plants will have surface areas of to square metres the equivalent of to parking spaces
last week french investment fund tikehau capital and state holding company bpifrance said they had jointly paid million euros for a percent stake in greenyellow
