update 3-nigerian politician ibori loses appeal against uk graft conviction
london reuters a nigerian politician who was jailed in britain for laundering tens of millions of dollars in stolen public funds through british banks and properties lost an appeal against his conviction in london on wednesday
the court of appeal s ruling against james ibori a former governor of delta state in southern nigeria is a relief for the british authorities at a time when they are trying to stem the flow of dirty money from overseas through london
ibori who in his heyday was one of nigeria s richest and most powerful men pleaded guilty in a london court in to counts of fraud and involving sums amounting to at least million pounds million
he received a jail sentence of which he served half as is common in the british system and is now back in nigeria
campaigners had hailed the case as a milestone for nigeria where no one of his stature had been successfully prosecuted and for its former colonial ruler britain long seen as too complacent about the proceeds of nigerian corruption being laundered in the uk
ibori owned homes in britain south africa and united states including an english country house near the private school where his children were being educated
he also owned a jaguar and a bentley and was buying a private jet at the time of his arrest
this contrasted sharply with the situation in delta state a maze of mangrove creeks by pipelines and plagued by violent conflict over access to oil money where most people make do without electricity or clean water
wednesday s ruling will allow britain to resume efforts to confiscate millions of dollars worth of assets and return them to nigerian public coffers
the assets have been frozen for years while the case has been dragging through the courts
despite his guilty pleas ibori appealed against his conviction alleging that one of the british police officers who investigated him had taken bribes from a private detective in return for inside tips about the probe
the officer denies this
ibori also alleged that british prosecutors had covered up the corruption tainting the judicial process
these allegations had threatened to turn the case into a major embarrassment for britain
but three senior appeal judges said the bribery was not proven and if it had happened ibori himself had instigated it as the private detective was working for him
as ibori was instrumental in the officer s corruption if corruption there was he can not even arguably rely upon it to escape his convictions the ruling said
britain is currently trying to crack down on by people involved in corrupt politics or business abroad
police say about billion pounds of dirty cash moves through or into britain each year
the ibori case which the current crackdown by over a decade relied on evidence obtained in britain and nigeria during several years of close cooperation between the british police and nigeria s own force
ibori has now resumed political activities in delta state
he says he has no faith in british justice and that the case against him is politically motivated
