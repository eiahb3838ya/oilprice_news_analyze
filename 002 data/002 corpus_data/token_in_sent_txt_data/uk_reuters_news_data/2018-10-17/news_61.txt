update 1-flybe sinks on profit warning from weaker demand, rising fuel
london reuters flybe issued a profit warning on wednesday citing weakening demand higher fuel costs and a weaker british pound sending shares in the british regional airline lower
shares in flybe whose routes include london to cornwall as well as connections between smaller uk cities and french regional cities slumped percent to pence at gmt on wednesday
flybe which has in recent years tried to reduce its fleet size and cut costs forecast a pretax loss of around million pounds for the current month period substantially worse than a current consensus for a loss of million pounds
however a million pound benefit from the ending of an onerous lease will help cushion the blow putting the strong company on track to post a loss of million pounds over its financial year which runs to march
flybe said that in recent weeks consumer demand for travel in britain and europe had weakened and that would combine with higher fuel prices and weaker sterling to drag on its performance in the second half period
the winter season is always tougher for airlines as fewer europeans take flights to go on holiday and that comes at a time when the oil price is hovering at a near high
flybe will announce results on when it is expected to detail further cost cutting plans
stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business but we aim to do more in the coming months particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs flybe ceo christine said in a statement
liberum analysts cut their target price on the shares which have halved in value over the last three months to pence from pence but kept their hold rating on the stock
the opportunities for improvements remain but they are being more than offset by the challenging external environment liberum said
