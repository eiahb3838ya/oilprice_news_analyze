update 1-italy renews pro-russia push ahead of eu summit
adds salvini comments in moscow move coincides with salvini s visit to russia diplomats rome urging eu funding for small russian firms italy resists eu sanctions on states conducting by francesco guarascio and gabriela baczynska brussels oct reuters italy s eurosceptic government is pushing for a reduction of tensions between the european union and russia but risks isolation in brussels as eu partners seek instead stronger measures to deter moscow from interfering in eu affairs
russia has been subjected to eu sanctions since the ukraine crisis and rome has long urged a relaxation of the penalties on the grounds that they have hit italian firms trading with moscow
in a new thrust italy is now calling on eu partners to back a plan to channel eu money to small russian firms that operate in sectors not covered by existing eu sanctions on banking defence and the energy industry three diplomats told reuters
that initiative preceded a summit of eu leaders due to start later on wednesday in brussels
rome is also resisting eu proposals to impose sanctions on countries that carry out in another move seen as being in favour of moscow
diplomats said the new eu sanctions regime would be aimed mostly at russia which has been in recent months at the centre of allegations of election meddling via social media in various western states as well as cyber warfare and security breaches conducted through electronic means
italy was the only eu member state that openly resisted the new sanctions regime according to a confidential eu document seen by reuters
the diplomatic push in brussels coincides with a visit by italy s deputy prime minister matteo salvini to russia on wednesday the second since he was sworn in four months ago
salvini who leads italy s league party is an admirer of russian president vladimir putin and has rejected allegations of russian meddling in western elections
if we are asked to confirm the sanctions we will say no salvini told a business conference in moscow
it s clear that it makes no sense that they are in but asked if italy would veto a renewal salvini said we can only play the veto joker once in polls show the league has multiplied its supporters in recent months also thanks to hardline slogans against the european union
italian prime minister giuseppe conte is likely to repeat calls for better relations with russia at the eu summit
he is then planning to fly to moscow next week
rome s calls for eu funding to russian small firms are not expected to be reflected in the joint document that eu leaders will approve at the end of their meeting this week diplomats said
but the eu commission could be asked to explore the feasibility of such a plan
the move is likely to be opposed by britain and eastern european countries who fear that existing sanctions could be one diplomat said
a spokeswoman for the eu foreign affairs chief was not immediately available for comments
italy s opposition to cyber sanctions has contributed to a softening of the wording of the final joint summit document which in its last draft version says work should be taken forward on cyber defences through eu restrictive measures
britain and other backers of the sanctions would have preferred clearer commitments
