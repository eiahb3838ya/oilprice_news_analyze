my numbers are giving me some despair birol told the conference at the polish embassy in paris
poland will host united nations talks in december which will lay out a rule book to implement a historic accord reached in paris in
that agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century shift towards cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures
looking at data for the first nine months of this year emissions this year will increase once again global emissions will reach a record historical high birol said
