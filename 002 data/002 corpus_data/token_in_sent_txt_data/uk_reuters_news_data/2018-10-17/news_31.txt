exclusive-spain rejects berkeley uranium mine in confidential report
madrid reuters spanish authorities have rejected granting a building permit to berkeley energia to open the european union s only uranium mine near salamanca a confidential report seen by reuters showed
a failure to move ahead with the mine would be a blow for the australian mining company which is listed in britain spain and australia and operates no other projects
the report issued on july is non binding but it makes it politically difficult for the small northwestern village of retortillo where the mine is projected to open to issue the permit
if the municipality was to disregard the report it may also pave the way for lawsuits
local authorities told retortillo in the report that the permit sought by berkeley did not meet legal requirements because the company did not own all the land needed for the project which also lacked key technical information and had to be first authorised by the central spanish government
it was not clear when the report was shared with berkeley or the municipality since being issued three months ago
berkeley s chief executive paul atherley declined to comment on the timing on a call with reuters
he reiterated that there were two outstanding items that needed to be resolved before retortillo could give its permission and that the company had already responded to these
we look forward to a response from the csn spanish nuclear authority and the government on the claims that have been made that they are going to deny the permits for the mine he said
berkeley also said this week that the timing of the licence award remained uncertain was outside of the company s control and it was unlikely to be received imminently
two sources familiar with the matter had told reuters on tuesday the spanish government had decided not to deliver the permits necessary to open the mine
berkeley shares fell nearly percent before they were suspended from trading
the price of uranium used in nuclear power generation fell heavily following japan s fukushima disaster of and has struggled to recover but prices have rallied this year
one investor in berkeley who declined to be named said permit risk on this project has been something that the company has always been upfront about to until such time as we hear official confirmation from quoted government sources we view this as an opportunity to add to our positions to benefit the bull market developing in clean base load power reporting by belen carreno additional reporting by melanie burton writing by julien toyer editing by paul day and jane merriman
