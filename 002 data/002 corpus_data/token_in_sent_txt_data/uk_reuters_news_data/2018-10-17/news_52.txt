update 1-rwe will seek damages if germany shuts coal plants abruptly - die zeit
frankfurt reuters power firm rwe will seek damages if germany decides to shut down power plants right away its chief executive told a weekly paper
germany has tasked a commission with creating a roadmap for phasing out coal as an energy source similar to a previous landmark decision to exit nuclear energy in the wake of the fukushima disaster in japan
results are expected by the end of the year
a draft proposal seen by reuters last week includes provision for billion euros billion in federal funds to bring new industries into regions
should the government decide an abrupt exit i would claim back what is being done to us rwe ceo rolf martin schmitz told die zeit in comments published on wednesday
the companies would be expropriated as was the case with nuclear energy
and they would have to be compensated for that schmitz said adding he believed there were other ways to resolve the conflict
shares in rwe germany s largest power producer fell sharply earlier this month when a court ruled that it could not start logging in an ancient forest potentially delaying the start of lignite mining in the area until after
the decision will shave more than million euros off its core earnings ebitda each year from the group said
schmitz told die zeit that jobs could be lost if it can not continue mining activities in the hambach forest
the commission which includes academics politicians environmentalists and trade union representatives will visit coal sites in the rhineland on and meet again the following day
this year utilities including rwe received up to billion euros after suing the government for a rushed exit from nuclear power in which they said was implemented by the government without adequate compensation
