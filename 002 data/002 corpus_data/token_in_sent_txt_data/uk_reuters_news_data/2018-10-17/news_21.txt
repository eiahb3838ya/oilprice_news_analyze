u.s. eyes more venezuelan sanctions, but oil on backburner -u.s. official
washington reuters the united states plans to turn up sanctions pressure on venezuela but sees less need to immediately target its energy sector given sagging production from the opec member s oil company a senior administration official said on wednesday
the government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist president nicolas maduro who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country s economic collapse
earlier this year the trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting a venezuelan oil services company or restricting insurance coverage for oil shipments
the actions would have built upon last year s ban for banks from any new debt deals with venezuelan authorities or oil giant pdvsa
asked by reporters whether the government had slowed down on its push for sectoral sanctions the senior official described them as some of the many tools it is keeping in reserve
with regards to venezuela all options are on the table said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity
the fact is that the greatest sanction on venezuelan oil and oil production is called nicolas maduro and pdvsa s inefficiencies the official said
venezuela s crude oil production hit a low in a slump blamed on poor management and corruption

almost million venezuelans have fled since driven out by food and medicine shortages hyperinflation and violent crime
the exodus has overwhelmed neighboring countries
maduro who denies limiting political freedoms has said he is the victim of an economic war led by adversaries
the trump administration also plans to ramp up economic pressure on cuba s military and intelligence services the official said
in his speech last month to the united nations president donald trump linked venezuela s crises to its cuban that is a message that we will continue to put out but frankly its a message that the region needs to talk about the official said noting john bolton trump s national security adviser is expected to elaborate on the issue publicly soon
the issue of cuban involvement in venezuela is a fact
it s not a theory it s not a story the official said
