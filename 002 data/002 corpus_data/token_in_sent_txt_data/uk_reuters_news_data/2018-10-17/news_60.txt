britain looking at four options for carbon pricing after brexit â€“govt official
london reuters britain is looking at four options for carbon pricing once it leaves the european union including launching its own emissions trading system a government official said on wednesday
britain could remain in the eu s emissions trading system ets launch a uk ets which links to the european scheme set up a uk ets or revert to a carbon tax emily briggs deputy head of emissions trading at britain s department for business energy and industrial strategy said
which option is chosen will partly depend on whether britain can secure a divorce deal with the eu on the terms of its exit from the bloc
the british government has said that if it secures a brexit deal with the eu it intends to remain in the ets until at least the end of the current trading phase running from but has not said what it plans to do after that
we are looking at four options whatever we do on carbon pricing will be at least as ambitious as the current scheme briggs said at the carbon forward conference in london
if britain departs the eu with no divorce deal it would automatically leave the eu s emissions trading system and its carbon pricing system would default to a tax the government said in a brexit advisory paper issued last week
britain is the emitter of greenhouse gases in europe and its utilities and industry are among the largest buyers of permits in the ets which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
companies from these sectors have urged britain to stay in the ets until the end of the current trading phase to avoid disruption but are divided over britain s participation in the scheme
britain s carbon price is currently made up of two levies a domestic carbon tax set at pounds per tonne paid on top of obligations under the ets which forces companies to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of they emit
as britain is such a big buyer of permits in the ets carbon analysts have said britain s exit from the scheme would likely have a bearish impact on prices
setting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is aimed at curbing pollution and helping britain meet its target to cut emissions by percent on levels by
the uk government will publish more details of how it will initially apply a carbon price in a no deal scenario in its annual budget statement on and legislation will be included in the finance bill it said in last week s no deal paper
