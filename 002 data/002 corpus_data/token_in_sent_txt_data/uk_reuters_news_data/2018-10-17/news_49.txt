chinese electric car makers, nurtured by state, now look for way out of glut
hangzhou china reuters humming away in an industrial estate in the eastern chinese resort city of hangzhou electric vehicle designer automagic is one of hundreds of companies looking to ride the country s wave of investment in clean transportation
the company wants to find a niche in a crowded sector that already includes renewable equipment manufacturers battery makers and property developers like the evergrande group as well as established auto giants
but not all of these electric vehicle hopefuls will make it to the finish line
this large number of firms is inevitable because whenever there is an emerging technology or emerging industry there must be a hundred schools of thought and a hundred flowers blooming said zhou xuan automagic s general manager referring to chinese leader mao zedong s hundred flowers campaign aimed at encouraging new ideas
china is using preferential policies and brute manufacturing power to position itself at the forefront of global efforts to electrify transportation
by the end of ownership of new energy vehicles nev those powered by fuels other than petrol reached million in china over half the world s total
with market expectations high chinese ev maker nio a rival to tesla launched a ipo in new york last month
in july the industry ministry published a list of recommended nev designs built by enterprises throughout the country
it included not only established carmakers like faw group and geely automobiles but also small new entrants with names like greenwheel wuhu bodge automobiles and jiangsu friendly cars
but regulators are already concerned about overcapacity and blind as subsidies are cut smaller need to develop a competitive edge
after a period of intense competition the rocks will appear and the weak will be consolidated or eliminated zhou said
overcapacity has been a persistent concern for many chinese industries with thousands of firms backed by local governments and supported by risky loans expanding quickly
over the years china has been forced to take action against supply gluts in steel coal and solar panels among others
electric vehicles could be next as local governments feel pressure to create champions while following state instructions to upgrade their heavy industrial economies
some executives say the market is already distorted by subsidies granted to inefficient and poorly performing firms
right now the rapid growth of nevs is not a market choice but behavior with growth stimulated by subsidies said li lei deputy director of the new energy department of jiangxi dacheng autos a new joint venture carmaker in eastern china s jiangxi province
though sales soared percent in the first eight months of hitting units the national development and reform commission ndrc has promised to tackle irrational growth in the sector
in draft rules released this year it said it would plan and arrange the new energy vehicle industry scientifically and block new production capacity in regions where the utilization rate was less than percent
but china has often relied on strategic supply gluts to boost competitiveness
excess production in solar power forced producers to reduce costs and compete with conventional energy sources
liu xiaolu sales manager with iconiq motors a luxury electric vehicle maker said the large number of companies could be a necessary stage of development for the sector
you can not say that enterprises will definitely be able to develop the entire industry by themselves and it probably needs everyone to come together and then gradually get eliminated afterwards he said
established automakers told reuters they d already had plenty of time to prepare for the shift towards electric transportation
xu hongfei general manager with zotye automobile a chinese automaker said it had been preparing for china s exit schedule from traditional vehicles for more than a decade and had developed core technologies such as batteries
with a staff of automagic was founded in by former engineers from ibm and geely
it is talking with partners to bring its models to the market
the company is focusing on small family vehicles rather than cars built by the likes of byd
it is also seeking better ways to produce recharge and recycle batteries
the most important point is that new energy vehicles need to be energy efficient with low energy consumption so we focus on cutting weight and making cars smaller so battery use can be reduced said zhong jin automagic s and chief executive
gcl one of china s biggest renewable developers plans to turn its new energy town at jurong in jiangsu province into a major manufacturing center with its expertise in batteries and recycling expertise and even create a battery rental system
although all the companies are trying to get an edge through innovation li of jiangxi dacheng said success could simply come down to market positioning
our company doesn t have any very big advantages or very big disadvantages and competition is dependent first on branding second on financing and third on sales channels he said
