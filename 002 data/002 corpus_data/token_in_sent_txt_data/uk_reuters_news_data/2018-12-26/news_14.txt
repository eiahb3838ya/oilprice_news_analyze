special report-oil output goes awol in venezuela as soldiers run pdvsa
caracas reuters last july major general manuel quevedo joined his wife a catholic priest and a gathering of oil workers in prayer in a conference room at the headquarters of petroleos de venezuela sa or pdvsa
the career military officer who for the past year has been boss at the troubled oil company was at no ordinary mass
the gathering rather was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked god to boost oil output
this place of peace and spirituality read a release by the oil ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the president nicolas maduro turned heads in november when he named a national guard general with no oil experience to lead pdvsa
quevedo s actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades
aside from beseeching heaven quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts pdvsa employees and contractors and even everyday citizens say are pushing the and respected company towards ruin
soldiers with under orders to prevent cheating on manifests now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors rattling foreign captains and crews
workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated pdvsa equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption
military chieftains moonlighting in the private sector are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with pdvsa
in a reversal of the socialist government s drive to nationalize the industry the lack of expertise among military managers is leading pdvsa to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations like drilling and pumping oil
to the dismay of many familiar with venezuela s oil industry some of the contracts are going to small firms with no experience in the sector
combined industry veterans say the steps leave venezuela s most important company which accounts for over percent of export revenue with even fewer means to rebuild the nation s coffers pay its many creditors and regain as an oil producer
what we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry said jose bodas general secretary of the oil workers federation a national labor union
the military officials don t listen to workers
they want to give orders but they don t understand this complicated maduro defends the military managers arguing they are more in synch with his socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit
i want a socialist pdvsa the president told allied legislators earlier this year
an ethical sovereign and productive pdvsa
we must break this model of the rentier oil quevedo who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of pdvsa didn t respond to requests for comment for this story
neither venezuela s information ministry responsible for communications for the government and senior officials nor pdvsa s press office returned phone calls or emails from reuters
pdvsa and the oil ministry disclose scant information about quevedo who is according to his social security registration
he seldom makes public speeches
but at an industry event in vienna last june quevedo told journalists pdvsa is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output
we hope by year end to recover the lost production he said in a forecast that has been missed
we have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the nearly years after the late hugo chavez launched his bolivarian revolution much of venezuela is in tatters
food and medicines are scarce hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life
at pdvsa managers long sought to keep the company running even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration growth and basic maintenance
despite their efforts decay led to dwindling production deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers
now critics say military officials atop pdvsa have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company s financial operational and staffing problems
no matter the dysfunction pdvsa remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled andean country
for maduro who became president after chavez died in handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers
no one will be able to remove the military from pdvsa now said rafael ramirez a former oil minister
ramirez ran the company for a decade under chavez before clashing with maduro who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption
pdvsa is a pdvsa is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers including major creditors from china and russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil
last month the head of rosneft the russian oil company flew to venezuela and complained to maduro about the delays reuters reported
demand remains healthy for venezuelan oil
operational problems under quevedo however have caused production to drop percent to million barrels per day according to the latest figures caracas reported to opec the oil cartel of which it is a member
quevedo in january will assume opec s rotating presidency for one year
pdvsa s financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention
the gross value of pdvsa s oil exports is expected to fall to billion this year compared with billion last year according to a calculation provided to reuters by the international energy center at iesa a venezuelan business school
exports a decade ago were over four times as much reaching billion according to pdvsa s accounts for
pdvsa didn t publish a report and hasn t released financial results in
little has been publicly disclosed by pdvsa or maduro s government about the military transformation within its ranks
a reuters examination based on confidential pdvsa documents as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees shippers traders foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company shows how quevedo s national guard is seeping into every facet of its operations
the documents include employment records agreements with contractors and internal staff memos
quevedo has appointed more than aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions according to a person familiar with pdvsa s human resource records
at its shabby concrete caracas headquarters once brimming with suited executives military officers are now in charge of operations
workers say offices in quevedo s penthouse sanctum remain luxurious
but in the halls below socialist propaganda including portraits of fidel castro and ernesto che guevara is among the scant decor left on the walls
the shift toward military management was the result of a purge of pdvsa leadership
allegations of corruption have been rife across the venezuelan government in recent years maduro himself is the target of sanctions for graft and human rights violations which he denies
in the president leveled his own accusations against pdvsa describing it as a den of he accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country s crisis
he ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers including pdvsa s two previous presidents chemist nelson martinez and engineer eulogio del pino
martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis two people familiar with the circumstances said
del pino remains detained awaiting trial
reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment
a person familiar with del pino s defense said he has yet after a year in jail to have an initial court hearing
at the time of the purge quevedo had risen from the national guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist
quevedo s twitter profile often features a photo of the general a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him
his feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of maduro s posts
since the general has moved between military and civilian positions
he has a longstanding relationship with diosdado cabello the powerful vice president of the socialist party the two were classmates as young men at military school
those ties led to senior posts for quevedo at the defense ministry and a program created by chavez for housing according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory
in back in a command role with the national guard quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook venezuela for four months
at least people on both sides died during the demonstrations sparked by the onset of food shortages
quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force which he denied
he appeared frequently on state television at the time donning an helmet and vest
these are terrorist groups he said of the protestors who eventually dissipated leading him to declare that the coup has been pleased with quevedo s performance maduro in named him housing minister
in his two years in the post he again became a fixture on state television often wearing the red shirt of the socialist movement and praising maduro s humane housing policies
opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as quevedo s outsized boasts including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than million homes despite widespread shortages of basic building materials
the housing ministry didn t respond to requests for comment
in november intelligence agents arrested former pdvsa chief del pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges
by then quevedo was maduro s choice to lead the company
the announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry
quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses
give me days he told acquaintances according to one person who spoke with him at the time
from the start maduro made clear the challenge ahead
in a public address during powerhouse venezuela a government conference meant to showcase business potential the president ordered quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping million barrels per day roughly a percent increase at the time
over the past year though quevedo has failed to reverse the slide
one of his first challenges according to people within pdvsa was to stanch the flow of workers many of whom deserted the company and venezuela altogether
pdvsa hasn t disclosed recent employment figures
but estimates by ipd latin america an oil and gas consultancy indicate pdvsa has about workers percent fewer than in
because of increases that now top million percent per year according to venezuela s national assembly pdvsa salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers
with no money and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open
shippers told reuters that pdvsa workers at times board vessels to ask for food
to boost manpower quevedo has been staffing some jobs including posts that once required technical knowledge with national guard recruits
the terminal of jose a caribbean port in northeast venezuela is one of the few remaining facilities from which pdvsa exports crude oil
the changes are disturbing buyers here
some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details like whether crude density a crucial attribute of quality complies with contract specifications according to three shippers and one pdvsa employee
crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board
although quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft some of the recruits ask for bribes themselves shippers said for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections
there are many risks one captain told reuters
venezuela s defense ministry which oversees the national guard didn t respond to reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment
even with soldiers as substitutes pdvsa can t find the workers it needs to man many posts
from the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company
in a recent internal report pdv marina the company s maritime unit said staffing was in a critical state on pdvsa s own tankers forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules
the alarming deficit of main staff the report read means we can not honor labor tensions with military managers are causing even more departures some workers say
consider an incident in june when two tankers docked at jose
one prepared to take on heavy crude the other a lighter grade of oil
as the tankers loaded pdvsa port employees noticed a mixup the two crudes had blended
the mistake the government said later forced pdvsa to pay the buyers because of contractual penalties million
it would also be costly for nine pdvsa employees
shortly after the error soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers and prosecutors charged them with sabotage
this was premeditated said tarek saab maduro s chief prosecutor announcing the arrests on television
the actions go beyond negligence there was malice after three days in an overcrowded military jail they were released pending trial
two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance not sabotage caused the mishap
a faulty valve system flimsy after years without upkeep caused the fuels to mix they said
six months later the government has presented no evidence against the workers
reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap
colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident
the arrests have rattled pdvsa employees especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes
in july four pdvsa employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of monagas according to workers and media accounts there
one worker in monagas told reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow
we don t understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage he said
they re being asked to work without safety equipment tools even without being able to feed themselves or their quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up pdvsa
in august for instance the general said the company was opening its doors for seven private companies to pursue unspecified service contracts across the country
the move raised eyebrows here because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry
chavez himself phased out similar contracts arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself
according to a document seen by reuters the companies obtained agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of pdvsa in return for boosting output financing investments and procuring equipment
but the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of venezuela s oil industry
none are recognized as having experience operating oilfields
consorcio rinoca centauro karina one of those listed on the document doesn t appear to have a web site
reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others
critics of the arrangements and government opponents say the transactions aren t transparent
by keeping details from the public they argue the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with
pdvsa is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias its quota of looting said jorge millan an opposition legislator who in september led a push in the national assembly to denounce the contracts
while quevedo s militarization of pdvsa hasn t reversed the company s decline the government shows few public signs of displeasure
in october the government announced a pdvsa board shuffle
among the changes jose rojas another national guard general replaced a civilian director
past executives joke that quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help
he s right said jose toro hardy an economist who served on pdvsa s board of directors in the
a miracle is needed for an increase in these additional reporting by mayela armas and vivian sequera in caracas and ernest scheyder in vienna
