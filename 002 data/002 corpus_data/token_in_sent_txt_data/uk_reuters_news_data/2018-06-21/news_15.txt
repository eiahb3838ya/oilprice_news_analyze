interview-ecuador sees tough opec meeting, smaller output boost
says oil output boost may be closer to bpd sees iran request for political talks at opec going nowhere adds quotes details from paragraph by alex lawler vienna june reuters ecuador s oil minister said he expects friday s opec meeting to be difficult citing disagreements on a possible increase in crude output and iran s demand that the gathering discuss sanctions
the minister carlos pérez also said he did not expect opec and its partners to raise oil output by million barrels per day a figure mentioned by opec sources as a compromise saying an increase of closer to bpd was more likely
it s going to be tough pérez told reuters on thursday
opec is not the place to discuss political issues or bans or things like that between governments
my point of view is that should not be discussed we re more for technical or economic iran facing sanctions on its oil industry and angry that president donald trump has asked opec to pump more oil has said the producer group must include a sanctions debate in the agenda of friday s meeting
they iran have requested that but i don t think it will go anywhere pérez said
political issues need to be discussed between the countries that are affected by those the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies including russia have since january last year been participating in a deal to cut output by million bpd
with a supply glut now eradicated oil ministers from opec meet on friday to discuss putting some of the withheld barrels back on the market followed by talks with producers on saturday
a production rise of about million bpd was emerging as a consensus opec sources told reuters on thursday adding that iran could agree to that under certain conditions
but pérez said he expected the final amount to be less and far below the million bpd mentioned by russia
it will probably be around or so he said
