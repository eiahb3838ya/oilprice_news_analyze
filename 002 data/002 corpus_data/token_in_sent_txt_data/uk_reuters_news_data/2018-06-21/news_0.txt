update 7-opec strives for deal to raise oil output as iran resists
vienna reuters opec scrambled on thursday to agree on raising oil output with saudi arabia warning of shortages but iran holding out against a deal amid the prospect of lower exports due to sanctions on tehran
the saudi and russian energy ministers said a production increase of about million barrels per day bpd or around percent of global supply had become a proposal for the group and its allies but iran s assent was vital
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets on friday to decide output policy amid calls from top consumers such as the united states china and india to cool down oil prices and support the world economy by producing more crude
iran opec s producer has so far been the main barrier to a new deal as it said on tuesday opec was unlikely to reach an agreement and should reject pressure from president donald trump to pump more oil
trump imposed fresh sanctions on tehran in may and market watchers expect iran s output to drop by a third by the end of
that means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise opec output unlike saudi arabia
i don t think we can reach agreement iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh told reporters after leaving a joint opec and ministerial committee in vienna while other ministers continued talks
iranian publication seda quoted sources as saying zanganeh told the meeting he would not accept an output increase because doing so would pave the way to an iranian oil embargo
iran is usually not part of the committee which groups russia saudi arabia the united arab emirates oman kuwait algeria and venezuela
the committee meeting was the last consultation before the opec gathering on friday
the meeting continued for around two hours after zanganeh left
saudi energy minister khalid said the overwhelming majority recommended raising output by million bpd gradually and on a basis among participants
opec and its allies have since last year been participating in a deal to cut output by million bpd
the measure has helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel from as low as in
brent oil prices were down percent on thursday
but unexpected outages in venezuela libya and angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around million bpd in recent months
iran s output is also likely to fall in the second half of this year due to the new sanctions
falih said the world could face a supply deficit of up to million bpd in the second half of and that opec s responsibility was to address consumers worries
we want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in falih said referring to a time when oil rallied close to per barrel
he also said the oil output boom would slow due to pipeline shortages in the next two years
on wednesday zanganeh had left the door open for a deal saying opec members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas
that would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as saudi arabia that have voluntarily cut more deeply than planned
falih said the exact mechanics of any increase would be decided among all opec members on friday
opec sources have said that if a million bpd output hike were approved saudi arabia would add about million bpd to supply
graphic opec compliance in may reuters survey zanganeh told cnn on wednesday that if opec returned to regular compliance the real supply increase from the group would constitute only around bpd
falih also said the real increase would be smaller than the nominal gain of million bpd meaning there was still the possibility for compromise with iran
opec sources also said iran had demanded that sanctions be mentioned in the group s communique as tehran has blamed measures for the recent rise in oil prices
the united states which rivals russia and saudi arabia for the position of world oil producer is not participating in the current supply pact
