mongolia parliament considers ipo for giant coal mine
ulaanbaatar june reuters the mongolian government on thursday submitted plans to parliament to list a chunk of the company that holds the giant tavan tolgoi coal mine
the potential initial public offering comes as the country looks to kickstart the development of one of the world s largest coking coal deposits with international coal prices picking up after years in the doldrums
mining minister sumiyabazar dolgorsuren presented a bill to parliament proposing the sale of up to percent of the project on domestic and international stock markets according to a notice on mongolia s official parliamentary website
the potential value of an ipo was not mentioned
the government said in a statement on wednesday that it would also speed up plans to build a billion power plant near the mine as well as a railway that would help deliver tavan tolgoi s coal to the chinese border
the government believes that the economic benefits of the deposit will increase it said in the statement
tavan tolgoi in the gobi desert about kilometres miles from the chinese border has an estimated billion tonnes of reserves and is considered one of mongolia s flagship mining projects
it is run by erdenes tavan tolgoi
however it has been held back by poor infrastructure and weak coal prices as well as disputes over the role foreign investment should play in mongolia s economic development
as early as mongolia appointed bnp paribas deutsche bank and goldman sachs and macquarie to lead an ipo for tavan tolgoi said to be worth as much as billion and previous administrations have discussed a triple listing for the project in london hong kong and ulaanbaatar
mongolia also allowed international investors to bid to develop the mine s western block in but shelved the plan amid complaints from japan and south korea that the process was unfair
in late a consortium consisting of mongolia s energy resources china s shenhua energy and the sumitomo corporation of japan was selected to invest billion in the project
however talks with the government collapsed in after a plunge in coal prices
some analysts still doubt mongolia is ready to launch the ipo
i am still not convinced tavan tolgoi is moving any time soon as unresolved major issues still remain such as funding for the railway and coal washing plant said mogi badral bontoi head of cover mongolia an market intelligence firm
will the chinese be involved again
without resolving these issues both on paper and politically the tavan tolgoi ipo is still far from reality he said
