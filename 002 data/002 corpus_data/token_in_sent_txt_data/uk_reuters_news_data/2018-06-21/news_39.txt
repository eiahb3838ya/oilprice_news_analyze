millions of british children exposed to harmful pollution- unicef
london reuters a third of all children living in britain around million live in areas with harmful air pollution a report by the children s agency unicef said on thursday
britain s government last month announced plans to curb air pollution after the european commission said it would take britain and five other european union member states to the eu court of justice for failing to respect air quality limits
unicef said the plans do not go far enough and called for more funding for measures to help reduce pollution in the worst affected areas
under the government s air quality plans unsafe levels of air pollution in around percent of uk towns and cities is likely to be the case for another years the report said
a separate report by global action plan also released on thursday found that children are percent more exposed than adults to dangerous pollution coming from vehicles on busy roads due to their shorter height
british environment minister michael gove said the global action plan research was troubling and showed why the government needed to take strong action to improve air quality
our new clean air strategy sets out how we will be the first major developed economy to reduce air pollution in line with world health organisation who limits and we have invested billion pounds to reduce harmful emissions he said in a statement
