explainer-opec's challenge - to pump more oil and keep deal in place
adds latest information vienna june reuters for opec with its oil deal is a nice problem to have
once known for rampant cheating on agreed oil output targets the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has been on a pact in place since january cutting around one and a half times the promised amount
the producer group meets on friday to decide on output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the united states india and china to cool down oil prices by producing more crude
opec and including russia have been participating since last year in a deal to cut output by million bpd
the arrangement runs to the end of
opec ministers meet their counterparts on saturday
in practice the cut has approached million bpd delegates and ministers say because of involuntary declines in countries including venezuela and angola as well as voluntary reductions by saudi arabia
iran has so far been the main barrier to a new pact objecting to calls for increased output
but opec officials are increasingly confident a deal will be reached
sources said a production rise of about million bpd was emerging as a possible consensus for opec and its allies adding that iran could assent under certain conditions
since an increase of million bpd would shrink the cut to about million bpd from million bpd it could provide a compromise by keeping the existing deal while raising output
a key challenge is how to share out the million bpd or whatever increase is eventually agreed
below are some of the sums being considered by opec and its allies if all opec members produced as much as they were allowed under the current deal opec output would in theory rise by about bpd based on reuters estimates of the group s production in may
but in practice it would mean a boost of less than a of that amount effectively from saudi arabia
riyadh is considered the only opec member pumping that could add significantly more at short notice
the current ratio of agreed opec cuts versus agreed cuts is around percent versus percent
that means if a million bpd output rise were agreed opec would be allowed to increase output by around bpd of which saudi arabia could contribute over bpd
however questions remain over venezuela libya and angola whose declines can not be reversed at short notice
opec could distribute the increase unevenly to allow those that can produce more saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates to fill in for those that can not although this could face resistance from countries reluctant to give up market share such as iran
iran has signalled that it would oppose any saudi move to fill other producers supply gaps
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said on wednesday that an opec output increase could total around bpd
opec s secretariat is looking at new quotas under various scenarios opec sources said
if the existing deal were retained and the saudis felt a need to add more oil riyadh could increase output unilaterally as it did after a meeting in june ended with no decision
