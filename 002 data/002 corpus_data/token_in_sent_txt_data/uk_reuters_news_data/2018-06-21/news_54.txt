opec strives for new deal as iran still wary of output hike
iran urges production cuts be pared to agreed levels saudi energy minister market demands more oil in russia pressing for big increase in output from july ecuador sees output hike by mln bpd as compromise by ahmad ghaddar vladimir soldatkin and ernest scheyder vienna june reuters opec s leader saudi arabia and russia were trying on thursday to convince fellow oil producers to raise output from july to meet rising global demand with iran still signalling it would support only a modest increase in supply
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets on friday to decide output policy amid calls from top consumers such as the united states china and india to cool down oil prices and support the world economy by producing more crude
russia which is not in opec has proposed producers raise output by million barrels per day bpd effectively wiping out supply cuts of million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel
oil traded as low as in
saudi energy minister khalid also said on wednesday that the market demanded more oil in the second half of this year and that opec was moving towards a good decision
opec s producer iran has so far been the main barrier to a deal as it said on tuesday opec was unlikely to reach an agreement and should reject pressure from president donald trump to pump more oil
but on wednesday iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said opec members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas
that would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as saudi arabia that have been cutting more deeply than planned despite production outages in venezuela and libya
iran s production is also likely to fall in the second half of due to new sanctions
ecuador said opec and its allies could agree to a compromise increase in output of around million bpd
zanganeh was due to attend a ministerial committee on thursday
iran is usually not part of the committee which includes russia saudi arabia the united arab emirates oman kuwait algeria and venezuela
before the committee meeting zanganeh was also scheduled to meet russian energy minister alexander novak for separate talks
iraq and venezuela have also opposed a relaxation of production cuts fearing a slump in prices
