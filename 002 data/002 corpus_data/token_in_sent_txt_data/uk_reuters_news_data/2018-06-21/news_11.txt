corrected-(official) update 1-u.s. oil, gas system methane leaks larger than epa estimates -study
environmental defense fund corrects worth of wasted methane in first paragraph to billion not billion and in fourth paragraph to billions of dollars not tens of billions of dollars by timothy gardner washington june reuters oil and gas drilling and related operations give off much more of the powerful greenhouse gas methane than the federal government estimates wasting about billion of fuel a year scientists said on thursday
methane the main component of natural gas is colorless and odorless
it is a major force in global warming because it has more than times the warming potential of carbon dioxide in the first years after it escapes into the atmosphere
in high concentrations it can also lead to formations of smog which is linked to heart and lung damage
the amount of methane leaked from oil and gas wells and related infrastructure in equaled about percent of the country s overall natural gas output a study led by the environmental defense fund advocacy group said
that was much more than the percent the environmental protection agency estimated for in a report last year
due to the billions of dollars worth of fuel that vanishes in the air some energy companies are expected to cut down on emissions using better monitoring equipment in drones and vehicles
this is a solvable problem because you are losing product that you could sell said steven hamburg the edf s chief scientist and a of the study
but the entire industry has to take action to stop the problem he added
once leaks are detected stopping them becomes a matter of routine maintenance that cuts down on well breakdowns which are more expensive to fix he said
the study integrating five years of research by scientists from universities and institutions including stanford harvard and purdue said it was the most comprehensive look ever at fugitive methane emissions from energy development
the research was published in the journal science
while president donald trump s administration has been trying to roll back methane rules on energy operations set under former president barack obama the epa s underestimation had nothing to do with politics said hamburg
still federal regulations are needed to address the emissions because voluntary actions by companies are not enough he said
the data is saying the problem is worse than we thought the need for regulation is thus that much greater hamburg said
the epa likely underestimates the emissions because it seeks permission from oil and gas operators to take measurements and workers may avoid errors or fix problems when measurement teams arrive the study said
the study relied on both measurements such as aircraft observations and measurements made directly at or downwind of energy facilities
an epa spokeswoman said the agency will review the study
most of the emissions come from malfunctioning well pads that are not fixed because the leaks are not detected the study said
leaks can be found at both young and mature wells and at fracking and conventional wells
the malfunctioning wells were largely absent from epa s inventory hamburg said
the study did not consider leaks from local distribution and power plants that burn natural gas or chemical plants that use it to make products
but scientists say those leaks are significant
