column-oil price will be driven by consumers rather than opec: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london june reuters oil traders attention is focused this week on vienna where ministers from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies must decide whether to increase their output in the second half of
but the direction of prices over the next year will be more influenced by less visible developments in the major countries especially the united states europe china and india
with available production capacity fairly fixed in the oil market rebalancing will depend on consumer reactions to higher prices
stocks of crude oil and refined products are now below their averages and expected to continue falling in the second half of and through
opec s spare production capacity has shrunk to less than million barrels per day bpd and is expected to fall to less than million bpd by the end of
opec and its allies are discussing an output increase of million bpd or more to avert future shortages and stock declines
by adding barrels to the market now opec can stabilise or even increase inventories and ease shortages later in
but the cushion of spare capacity is already low and will shrink further as opec boosts its output leaving the market without much capacity to absorb further disruptions
oil production is expected to rise by million bpd in and another million bpd in but may not be able to rise much faster because of pipeline bottlenecks
from the supply side therefore the oil market s production capability now appears fairly fixed for the rest of and into
any further rebalancing will have to come from the demand side where prices will have to rise high enough to moderate consumption growth
global consumption has increased by an average of million bpd for the last three years accelerating from an average of million bpd in the three previous years
slower growth in consumption will almost certainly have to play a significant role in pushing the oil market back towards balance
benchmark oil prices have already risen by around percent over the last year which should help restrain consumption growth
the critical question is whether the rise in prices has already been enough to promote a slowdown or whether prices will have to rise even further
the problem for traders and ministers trying to estimate the price needed to rebalance the market is that consumption responds to price changes with a delay of six to months
and in most important consuming countries reliable statistics on consumption are available only with a delay of three to four months
a sharp rise in prices almost always leads to a slowdown in consumption growth especially in the advanced economies but the slowdown is always more apparent in retrospect than at the time
by the time a slowdown shows up in official statistics it will already be too late and prices will probably have risen too high to be sustainable
in and again in surging oil prices resulted in a sharp slowdown in consumption growth in the advanced economies though at the time many analysts dismissed signs of a slowdown
in both cases the oil market was eventually forced back to balance but not before prices had overshot on the upside creating conditions for the subsequent collapse
