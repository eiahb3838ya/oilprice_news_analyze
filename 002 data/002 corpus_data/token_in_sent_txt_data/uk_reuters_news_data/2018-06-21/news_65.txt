update 2-australia's woolworths, bp abandon petrol station deal
reuters australian retailer woolworths group on thursday said bp plc s australian unit would not continue with the purchase of woolworths petrol business which was announced in december
australia s competition watchdog had in december blocked the a billion billion purchase of woolworths petrol stations even after bp offered to sell some stations to ease competition concerns
woolworths said the sale agreements and strategic partnership agreements entered with bp in december will therefore not be continued by bp
woolworths said it would continue to entertain alternative options for its petrol business but did not specify what the options are
