the original plan was for the ceo of china energy and a delegation to arrive over this past weekend and be here in west virginia with our state officials and others said anderson

china energy could not immediately be reached for comment
among planned stopovers by the delegation was an appearance at the northeast petrochemical construction conference in pittsburgh on tuesday

trump made west virginia and its coal miners a centerpiece of his presidential campaign promising to create jobs for miners revive the coal industry and boost its sagging economy
