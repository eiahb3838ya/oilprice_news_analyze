south africa coal terminal boosts productivity with $98 million upgrade
rbct improves efficiency and coal turnaround time million machinery replacement project completed terminal on track meet record mln tonne export target by tanisha heiberg richards bay south africa june reuters south africa s richards bay coal terminal rbct has boosted productivity and improved turnaround times after a billion rand million machinery upgrade the firm said on thursday as it reiterated forecasts for record exports this year
rbct africa s largest coal export facility launched the project to replace its ageing machines with the aim of sustaining the terminal s million tonne capacity but the process has also increased efficiencies it said
we are already enjoying several operational efficiencies of the new machines said rbct chief executive officer alan waller
the project installed two new stacker reclaimers which scoop up and transfer coal into and out of the yard and its shiploaders
they in turn transport coal along a conveyer into a ship s hold
the two new reclaimers are expected to have a capacity of tonnes per hour compared to the previous machines tonnes per hour while the shiploader will have tonnes per hour capacity compared with tonnes per hour previously
the reclaimers have also cut the amount of bulldozing needed after its arm was extended further into the coal yard from metres to metres said rbct project general manager bill murphy
that means it has a longer reach and there is less bulldozing time
it increases the productivity at rbct said murphy
the project also reconfigured the terminal s five existing electrical substations and added a new substation
rbct said it is well on track to reach its export target of million tonnes this year and has already surpassed the levels it had reached last year this time
we are probably million tonnes ahead compared to this time last year said waller without giving specific figures
the terminal exported a record million tonnes of coal in and aims to export million tonnes this year
