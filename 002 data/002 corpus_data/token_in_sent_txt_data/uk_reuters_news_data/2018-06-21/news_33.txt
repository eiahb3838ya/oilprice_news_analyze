update 3-after gazprom probe, eu investigates qatar's long-term lng contracts
reuters the european commission is investigating the bloc s biggest gas supplier qatar petroleum over potentially restrictive supply agreements inhibiting development of a single gas market its latest challenge to a major gas supplier
the bloc having just wrapped up a market abuse probe into russian giant gazprom said it sought to determine if qatar s liquefied natural gas lng supply deals with european utilities barred them from diverting shipments within the region
destination clauses are a fixture of lng deals that tie buyers to receiving shipments at a specific port thereby preventing cargo diversions that could undercut qatar in a third market
qatar is the world s biggest lng producer and its geographical location between europe and asia also allows it to swing supply to the most lucrative market which causes periodic supply shortages particularly in northwest europe
roughly speaking qatar offers two types of lng supply arrangements in europe
the classic deal prevalent across southern europe forces the buyer to take or pay for a fixed annual quantity of lng even if they do not need it
in such cases diversion curbs may limit the benefit to europe given that italy s edison for example couldn t freely send emergency supplies of qatari lng to plug potential shortfalls in southern france
the second contract type confined to northwest europe leaves it largely up to qatar as to how much lng arrives at port
the world s biggest lng importer japan has led the backlash against destination curbs in lng deals a throwback to a time when producers held the upper hand after its fair trade commission last year banned the practice in any new deals
the probe into qatar s lng deals follows extensive consultation between the european commission and japan s ministry of economy trade and industry in recent months exploring the impact of such curbs on gas market development and price transparency workshop presentations seen by reuters show
we have opened an investigation to look at whether there are problematic territorial restriction clauses in gas supply contracts with qatar petroleum commissioner margrethe vestager in charge of competition policy said in a statement
such clauses may harm competition and prevent consumers from enjoying the benefits of an integrated european energy market she said
in a statement qatar petroleum said the investigation will focus on five of its lng subsidiaries operated by qatargas
qatar petroleum wishes to stress that it gives the highest importance to compliance with regulatory authorities in all geographical areas in which it operates it said
trevor sikorski analyst at energy aspects said the producer could face fines of up to percent of global turnover if found guilty of behaviour
the more likely outcome is they agree to remove all restrictive destination clauses in their supply agreements with european buyers he said
eu regulators ultimately decided against fining gazprom after finishing the probe in may but it did force gazprom to reform its pricing structure and allow buyers in eastern and central europe greater control over supply
under eu rules destination restrictions hold no sway once pipeline gas or lng shipments arrive at european ports
while this has liberated piped gas flows across the region lng is more cumbersome to from one port to another heightening market divisions
qatar supplied percent of the eu s lng last year at million tonnes compared to million tonnes in total according to data from the international group of lng importers
nigeria and algeria were the next biggest suppliers with just over million tonnes
