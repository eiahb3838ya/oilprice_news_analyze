coal in the crossfire: chinese traders wary of being burnt by trade war
beijing reuters at least three coal shipments on their way to china may end up casualties of the escalating trade dispute after beijing said it would impose steep tariffs that may kick in before the ships reach their destinations
the addition of coal to the list of more than items facing higher tariffs came as a shock to chinese steel mills and trading firms that just last month were encouraged by beijing to buy more coal to narrow the trade gap four sources with knowledge of the plan said
although items on the list face higher tariffs starting july beijing did not specify when coal and the other remaining items would be hit
but coal s presence on the list has sent shudders through the market
i am really worried
i haven t found buyers interested in these cargoes now said the manager of shanghai runhe international trade co which has three shipments of coking coal en route to china
he said runhe had paid for the coal up front rather than using letters of credit from banks
who knows what trump is going to do next
in the worst scenario we lost some money he added
he declined to be named because of company policy
a cargo of coking coal depending on the size of the vessel can be worth million to million
from late until january china bought no coal from the united states as it typically costs more takes longer to arrive and is of lower quality than australian coal
purchases resumed at a lower level after president donald trump took office thomson reuters eikon data show
replacing american shipments with coal from other places would not be difficult the sources said
wang a private coal trader who had planned to buy coal from runhe said he was changing course
that plan is now completely off the table said wang who is based in rizhao
we were mystified by the trade policies
in may my reading of the policy was that china is to step up coal buying to contribute to imports he added
wang declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic
he is not the only one alarmed
an executive with the trading arm of a major chinese building materials company said it had stopped talks with coal producers
we resumed our talks with coal producers recently the executive said
but our talks are stopped she added that the company had not been prepared for the policy reversal
she declined to be named due to company policy
trade flow data from thomson reuters eikon showed that the three coal shipments the only confirmed cargoes in transit from the united states to china are heading to jintang port in hebei province
one vessel the navios taurus loaded tonnes in late may in mobile and is estimated to arrive on july days after some of the proposed tariffs are set to kick in
another vessel named partnership carrying tonnes of coal from virginia is due to arrive at jingtang port on june
to view a map of coal cargoes heading for china click the cargoes owners might risk a credit downgrade if they can not find buyers fast enough making it harder to borrow in the future the building materials executive said
the owners of those two cargoes must be on a hot pan now she said
a third vessel the west trader completed loading of tonnes of coal in baltimore on monday
its listed destination is china and it is scheduled to arrive on
reuters was not able to identify the buyer of that cargo
shanghai runhe declined to say whether it owned any of the three vessels
some steel mills did not buy coking coal from the despite political pressure
we are much relieved that we don t need to buy coal now an executive from one of china s largest steel producers said
she declined to be named because of company policy
she said that authorities told her mill in late may to buy more coking coal from the united states but that the company couldn t make any deals because of unattractive prices and higher shipping costs
coking coal typically costs three times more and takes three times longer to arrive than coal from australia data show
supplies can also be of poorer quality because of high sulphur content and low heating efficiency
we could only afford a small volume of coal even if we are asked to buy more but i am glad it s not a concern for us anymore she said
china bought million tonnes of coking coal in of which percent came from the united states
shanghai runhe did not immediately respond to requests for comment
