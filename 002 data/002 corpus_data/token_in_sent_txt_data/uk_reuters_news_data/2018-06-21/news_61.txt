as fukushima residents return, some see hope in nuclear tourism
fukushima japan reuters on a cold day in february takuto okamoto guided his first tour group to a sight few outsiders had witnessed in person the construction cranes looming over japan s fukushima daiichi nuclear plant
seven years after a deadly tsunami ripped through the tokyo electric power plant okamoto and other tour organisers are bringing curious sightseers to the region as residents who fled the nuclear catastrophe trickle back
many returnees hope tourism will help resuscitate their towns and ease radiation fears
but some worry about drawing a line under a disaster whose impact will be felt far into the future
the cleanup including the removal of melted uranium fuel may take four decades and cost several billion dollars a year
the disaster happened and the issue now is how people rebuild their lives okamoto said after his group stopped in tomioka kilometres miles south of the nuclear plant
he wants to bring groups twice a week compared with only twice a month now
electronic signs on the highway to tomioka showed radiation around times normal background levels as okamoto s passengers peered out tour bus windows at the cranes poking above fukushima daiichi
for me it s more for bragging rights to be perfectly honest said louie ching a filipino programmer
ching two other filipinos and a japanese man who visited chernobyl last year each paid yen for a day trip from tokyo
the group had earlier wandered around namie a town kilometres north of the plant to which residents began returning last year after authorities lifted restrictions
so far only about of people are back a ratio similar to that of other ghost towns near the nuclear site
former residents mitsuru watanabe and his wife rumeko have no plans to return
they were only in town to clear out their shuttered restaurant before it is demolished and they chatted with tourists while they worked
we used to pull in around million yen a year mitsuru said as he invited the tourists inside
a calendar hung on the wall and unfilled orders from the evacuation day remained on a whiteboard in the kitchen
we want people to come
they can go home and tell other people about us mitsuru said among the dusty tables
okamoto s group later visited the nearby coastline where the tsunami killed hundreds of people
abandoned rice paddies a few derelict houses that withstood the wave and the gutted ukedo elementary school are all that remain
it s here behind a new sea wall at the edge of the restricted radiation zone that fukushima prefecture plans to build a memorial park and archive centre with video displays and exhibits about the quake tsunami and nuclear calamity
it will be a starting point for visitors kazuhiro ono the prefecture s deputy director for tourism said of the centre
the japan tourism agency will fund the project ono added
ono wants tourists to come to fukushima particularly foreigners who have so far steered clear
overseas visitors spent more than million days in japan last year triple the number in
about of those were in fukushima
tokyo electric will provide material for the archive although the final budget for the project has yet to be finalised he said
some people have suggested a barbecue area or a promenade said hidezo sato a former seed merchant in namie who leads a residents group
a sticker on the radiation metre around his neck identified him as being the first to return to the town
if people come to brag about getting close to the plant that can t be helped but at least they ll come sato said
the archive will help ease radiation fears he added
standing outside a farmhouse as workmen refurbished it so her family could return mayumi matsumoto said she was uneasy about the park and archive
we haven t gotten to the bottom of what happened at the plant and now is not the time she said
matsumoto had come back for a day to host a event for about university students
later they toured namie on two buses including a stop at scaffolding near the planned memorial park site to view fukushima daiichi s cranes
matsumoto described her feelings toward tokyo electric as complicated because it is responsible for the disaster but also helped her family cope its aftermath
one of her sons works for the utility and has faced abuse from angry locals she added
it s good that people want to come to namie but not if they just want to get close to the nuclear plant
i don t want it to become a spectacle matsumoto said
okamoto is not the only guide offering tours in the area although visits of any kind remain rare
he said he hoped his clients would come away with more than a few photographs
if people can see for themselves the damage caused by tsunami and nuclear plant they will understand that we need to stop it from happening again said okamoto who attended university in a neighbouring prefecture
so far we haven t come across any opposition from the local yen reporting by tim kelly additional reporting by kwiyeon ha and toru hanai editing by gerry doyle
