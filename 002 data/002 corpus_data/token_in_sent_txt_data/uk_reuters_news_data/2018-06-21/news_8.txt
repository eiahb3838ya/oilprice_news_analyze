the fate of the ports two of libya s largest is crucial to the partial fragile recovery of the country s oil industry
their closure has led to production losses of up to barrels per day bpd from a total national output of little over one million bpd
two oil storage tanks had been set on fire since the initial attack causing damage that the national oil corporation noc has said will take years to repair
on thursday a third storage tank was set alight sending thick black smoke over ras lanuf before the fire was extinguished a firefighter said
haftar who built up his libyan national army lna during his campaign to seize the eastern city of benghazi is one of the figures vying for power in libya since the country fragmented following a uprising in
he has received increased international recognition since seizing the oil crescent ports in and allowing the national oil corp noc to reopen them despite his rejection of a government in the capital tripoli

libyan production is very low but we are going to resume very soon sanalla told reporters in vienna
after a couple of days we will resume we start our operations the noc has blamed the attack on the terminals on militias led by ibrahim jathran who blockaded oil crescent ports for several years before losing control of them in
the lna has said the benghazi defence brigades a coalition of fighters that previously tried to advance on benghazi and seized ras lanuf and es sider for days in march were also involved
