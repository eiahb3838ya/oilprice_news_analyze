u.s. aims to start lng deliveries to germany in four years - bild
berlin sept reuters companies expect to begin delivering liquefied natural gas lng to germany in four years at the latest and will challenge russia which now accounts for percent of german gas imports the deputy energy secretary told a german newspaper

liquefied natural gas is coming to germany
the question is not if but when dan brouillette told the mass circulation daily bild in an interview published on monday
president donald trump in july accused germany of being a captive of russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the billion nord stream gas pipeline that is to be built in the baltic sea
germany rejects this charge and says it is open to diversifying its energy sources but says sales will ultimately be determined on economic grounds
brouilette who acknowledged lng would cost more said the entry of suppliers onto the german market would effectively set a price ceiling for gazprom the russian state energy company that leads the nord stream consortium and other suppliers
because lng is here gazprom can not demand whatever it wants brouillette who met with german business executives in berlin last week told the newspaper

ambassador richard grenell told the newspaper that chancellor angela merkel had assured trump personally that germany wanted to purchase lng supplies
the debate about german lng imports has flared up in recent weeks as operators and the government have shown an interest in diversifying away from pipeline gas arriving from russia norway and the netherlands
qatar has also expressed interest in selling lng to germany
german firms are considering building an lng terminal in germany as gas demand rises in europe and the netherlands one of germany s crucial suppliers which is winding down its giant groningen field and plans to close it in
