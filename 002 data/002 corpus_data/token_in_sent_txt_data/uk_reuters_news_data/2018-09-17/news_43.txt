shell targets lower methane emissions from oil and gas operations
london sept reuters royal dutch shell announced on monday plans to limit emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas across its oil and gas operations
shell aims to maintain methane emissions intensity below percent by it said in a statement joining british rival bp which last year set a similar goal
methane is released into the atmosphere mostly through leaks in gas infrastructure such as pumps and pipelines
the gas has a bigger impact than carbon dioxide even though the oil and gas industry produces less methane and the gas also has a shorter lifetime
the methane target will be measured against a baseline leak rate which is currently estimated at range from percent to percent across the company s oil and gas assets it said
the company set out last year an ambitious plan to halve its carbon emissions by far exceeding rivals
investors have called on the company to set binding targets to reach those goals
