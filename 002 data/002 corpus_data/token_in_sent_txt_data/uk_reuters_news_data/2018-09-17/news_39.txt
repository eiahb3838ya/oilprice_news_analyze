rpt-n.carolina's raging rivers from storm florence test beefed-up defenses
repeats with no change in text by patrick rucker fayetteville sept reuters deadly storm florence s historic rainfall is testing the best efforts by many north carolina cities to bolster their defenses against flooding since hurricane matthew inundated the eastern part of the state two years ago
since matthew firefighters have been trained in rapid water rescue and are equipped with inflatable boats used to pluck people from raging rivers and streams
more dams have been built on many of the rivers that snake through the state and improved forecasting tools have made it easier to position rescue teams
in the city of lumberton where the lumber river overflowed its banks following matthew the city built a berm an earthen wall along the riverbank to contain the rising current and prevent a repeat of the flooding
the berm is intended to supplement a recently completed dam built across the river to allow for a controlled release of the water flow
we saw what was coming so we started building a dam to keep that area from breaking through like it did before said bill french director of emergency services for lumberton
but on sunday the combination of the dam and berm failed to stop the swollen river from climbing beyond its banks as it reached about feet m rising feet m in two days alone
it could get worse with the river forecast to crest at feet m late on sunday
using a head start from forecasting of the rains french said the city began running half a dozen pumps to clear water from drainage canals
when the river gets as high as it is now you re kind of limited in what you can do he said
overall florence a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by sunday is forecast to douse the state with record rainfall from a single storm surpassing the inches cm that hurricane floyd dropped in
in some spots in the offshore outer banks islands inches cm of rain were recorded this weekend
warnings in goldsboro west of fayetteville retailers have moved inventory to higher shelves learning their lesson two years ago when matthew s floodwaters damaged goods
city officials have gone warning some residents they need to leave
similar precautions were taken in wayne county on the banks of the neuse river where a furniture store devastated by matthew removed all its heavy merchandise before the expected storm
the area is made vulnerable by the flat landscape said scott stevens the city manager in goldsboro
a foot of water doesn t spread out a foot
it spreads out a feet he said
rivers may fill up even faster now that soil is so and sodden it can not hold more water said drew coleman a professor of geological sciences at the university of north carolina
it s not a feasible location for us to do a lot of flood proofing on a large scale said stevens the goldsboro city manager
since matthew goldsboro has trained firefighters in water rescues and equipped them with additional boats stevens said saying the city was much better prepared with equipment and training to help federal rescue teams were also positioned before the rivers could rise with a team based in lincoln nebraska joining efforts in fayetteville to make sure senior citizens were safe ahead of the worst of the flooding
more than people were evacuated from a nursing home in fayetteville late on saturday by a rescue team comprised of federal responders state and local emergency workers said maine johnson a spokesman for the city of fayetteville
the worst may be yet to come said evan duffey a meteorologist at accuweather in state college pennsylvania
all the water from further upstream takes a little while to get down to the cape fear river with a normal depth of just feet m near fayetteville is expected to crest late on monday at feet m which could upend life in the city of about people still recovering from a costly flood in the aftermath of matthew two years ago
in towns like lumberton which lies just feet m above sea level even the best preparations can not protect the entire area said french the emergency services manager
