rpt-update 1-florence flooding limits road access to duke nuclear plant
repeats to add pictures sept reuters duke energy corp said on monday that its brunswick nuclear power plant in north carolina remained safely shut down despite limited road access to the site due to flooding from storm florence
the remnants of florence which came ashore as a hurricane on friday are still dropping heavy amounts of rain on the already waterlogged carolinas with officials warning the worst is yet to come as swollen rivers pose a growing threat
duke spokeswoman mary kathryn green said there was road access to the brunswick site but it was limited she said there were about people at the plant
there are usually more than workers
over the weekend duke said that conditions had prohibited the plant staff from accessing the site via personal vehicles due to flooding of local roads according to an unusual event report made available on the nuclear regulatory commission s website on monday
an unusual event is the lowest of the nrc s emergency classifications
joey ledford a spokesman for the nrc s region office in atlanta said the company issued the report because regulations and plant procedures required multiple overland routes to the plant
ledford said brunswick never lost access to offsite power and there was no flooding at the plant which sits about feet meters above sea level
duke started shutting the two reactors at the plant on thursday before the storm hit the coast
one megawatt can power about homes
brunswick is located about four miles km from the coast near the town of southport about miles south of wilmington north carolina
nuclear plants have procedures that require they shut a safe amount of time before hurricane force winds are expected to reach the site
the two reactors at the plant which entered service in and are of similar design to some of the reactors damaged at the fukushima nuclear plant in japan after an earthquake and tsunami in
since fukushima all reactors have been upgraded with additional safety equipment including portable pumps and generators to keep cooling water circulating through the reactor in case the plant loses offsite power
separately duke said on saturday it released some stormwater that may have come into contact with coal ash from a landfill at the company s sutton power plant in wilmington
