germany's uniper says in talks on wilhelmshaven lng terminal
sept reuters german utility uniper is ready to import liquefied natural gas lng into the country and distribute it should a terminal be built at wilhelmshaven close to its storage facilities board member keith martin told reuters in an interview
martin said the company is in talks with a number of parties including those from the united states and that more concrete news should be announced before the end of the year
such plans put uniper in competition with rwe which said earlier this month it had secured capacity to import lng at a planned terminal in brunsbuettel for which a final investment decision would be made next year
we are in talks with interested parties in building a floating liquefied natural gas import terminal at wilhelmshaven martin said told reuters
we are talking to a wide range of people including the he said he was confident that there would be further news about the project in the fourth quarter but that for now details and third parties were commercially sensitive
martin s comments come a week after uniper first said it favoured the deepwater port on the north sea coast compared to rwe s brunsbuettel project on the kiel canal
his remarks amount to a hardening of an earlier commitment and will give suppliers logistics firms and consumers important clues on where to position themselves
the terminal a floating regasification and storage unit fsru would have a throughput capacity of around billion cubic metres a year or million tonnes a year and accept cubic metre lng carriers martin said
uniper would not invest in the terminal itself but it would become the buyer and distributor of the gas martin said
ordering fsrus rather than building onshore lng facilities is cheaper quicker and more flexible as the vessel can be moved to a different location when not needed
new fsrus cost around to million but tankers converted into fsrus are even cheaper
uniper says it favours wilhelmshaven due to its access to the continental pipeline system and storage facilities such as its own plant at etzel giving it advantage over other projects including another on the inland elbe river port of stade
wilhelmshaven lng could also offer bunker fuel for ships in the german bay ahead of limits on heavily polluting ship fuels imposed by the imo from
the debate about german lng has flared up recently as the government wants to diversify away from pipeline gas arriving from russia norway and the netherlands
lng suppliers including qatar and the united states have said they are keen on opportunities
