china to speed up efforts to cut solar, wind subsidies - draft guidelines
shanghai reuters china will speed up efforts to ensure its wind and solar power sectors can compete without subsidies and achieve grid price parity with traditional energy sources like coal according to new draft guidelines issued by the energy regulator
as it tries to ease its dependence on polluting fossil fuels china has encouraged renewable manufacturers and developers to drive down costs through technological innovations and economies of scale
the country aims to phase out power generation subsidies which have become an increasing burden on the state
china s regions will make an extra push to provide technological and policy support to the renewables sector in order to ensure they can operate according to draft guidelines issued by the national energy administration nea dated to the industry and reviewed by reuters
the guidelines said some regions with cost and market advantages had already basically achieved price parity with clean power and no longer required subsidies and others should learn from their experiences
they also urged local transmission grid companies to provide more support for projects and ensure they have the capacity to distribute all the power generated by wind and solar plants
the draft guidelines were issued for feedback from the industry and it is unclear when they will come into effect
solar power generation costs fell percent from to and gcl new energy holdings one of china s biggest clean energy developers said in late august that grid price parity could happen within a year
parity is here already for high price markets said thomas lapham chief executive of asia clean capital which builds rooftop solar projects for major corporations in china
i don t think there will be a specific magical date when parity is here for all locations he said
it will gradually spread over time as efficiencies continue to improve and prices become more china s solar sector is still reeling from a decision to cut subsidies and cap new capacity at gigawatts gw this year down from a record gw in with the government concerned about overcapacity and a growing subsidy backlog
according to the nea the government owed around billion yuan billion in subsidies to solar plants by the middle of this year
lapham said the cap on new projects has hurt the industry in the short term but by making a component supply glut even worse it has also reduced prices and brought china even closer to grid price parity
the silver lining may be that we are on more stable ground for and beyond even without subsidies he said
