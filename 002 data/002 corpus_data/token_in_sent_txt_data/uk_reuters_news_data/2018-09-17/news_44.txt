rpt-update 1-bp, vitol go head to head in west african crude trading
repeats story no changes to text bp becomes pioneer of west african crude derivatives oil major clashes with vitol development makes crude more expensive for refiners by dmitry zhdannikov julia payne and amanda cooper london sept reuters oil major bp has clashed with rival vitol in the west african crude market buying up cargoes and taking a big derivative position that may have raised costs for european refiners
the west african crude market typically sees cargoes of nigerian and angolan change hands in deals outside the platts window a system widely used by the industry to price crude
pricing agency s p global platts sets key oil benchmarks for the market
new trading opportunities arose from august when broker sunrise started the first derivative for nigeria s four largest crude oil grades bonny light forcados qua iboe and bonga mirroring derivatives trading in the north sea
the derivatives known as contracts for differences cfds allow traders to bet on whether premiums of the four nigerian grades versus the brent benchmark will rise or fall
the cfds also known as swaps can be used to hedge against price fluctuations during the voyage of a physical cargo to a consumer which can take weeks
but cfds can also be used to take a speculative position
according to five traders familiar with the developments who asked not to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media bp quietly built a long position of up to million barrels in the african cfds contracts in august betting the premium of the grades to brent will rise in september
against bp in the paper market were six trading desks including trading giant vitol which took the opposite side of the bet and went short cfds betting that african grades premiums to brent would fall according to trading sources
the paper deals were done on a basis with only bp vitol and five other companies aware of the developments
bp said it does not comment on trading positions
however bp welcomes the introduction of the new west african swap to provide greater transparency and aid price discovery in the west african crude market it said on friday
the trades took place in what has long been a regulatory grey area
london s financial conduct authority which does not regulate london trading in the west african crude market but does oversee the uk brent crude benchmark declined to comment
bp does not produce oil in nigeria and has not been a large trader of nigerian oil in recent years although it has bought some cargoes for its refining system
after quietly building its paper position in august bp launched a flurry of bids on the platts system in september for physical cargoes of nigerian oil
bp bid for a total of nigerian cargoes loading between sept a previously unseen volume in the west african crude market where a whole month can sometimes go without a single public bid or offer in the platts window
bp s bidding activity ushered premiums of the african grades against the brent benchmark to as high as per barrel compared to a premium of a barrel in august when bp was building its cfds position
a difference of cents per barrel would in theory bring a profit of million on a cfd position
the rise in premiums in the physical market made bp a big winner on its long position on the cfds trade while vitol was a loser according to traders
in reaction vitol spent over million to buy seven cargoes outside the platts system from oil majors total and shell paying premiums above per barrel according to three traders familiar with the developments
the trading house then the cargoes on the platts system to bp at premiums ranging between per barrel effectively accepting a loss on the physical trade but limiting its losses on the cfd side
tensions were running huge between bp and vitol
it was a high stakes game said a trader familiar with the development
vitol declined to comment on the story
s p global platts said it always ensures bids and offers are firm performable and tradeable and that its price assessments are reflective of market value
we have seen a marked increase in the past several weeks of transparent information in the west african crude market said jonty rushforth senior director at s p global platts
alongside the increase in physical information we have seen a growing derivatives market he added
as the importance of that market globally has grown we have seen the broader market embrace risk management tools related to market participants said the main losers from the developments in the west african market will be refiners
nigerian state oil firm nnpc sets its monthly official selling prices osp to crude buyers mainly refiners retroactively and based on prices in the platts system
this is very bad from a refiners perspective
every seller is now asking high prices and when they show a cargo all they say is if you don t buy we ll just sell to bp said a source with a european refiner
