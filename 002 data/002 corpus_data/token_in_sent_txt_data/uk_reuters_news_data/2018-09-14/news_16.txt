panama canal head expects fewer china, u.s. ships if trade war escalates
panama city reuters fewer ships from china and the united states could use the panama canal if trade tensions escalate between the two economic giants but the dip could be offset by grain exports from north brazil the head of the organization that operates the waterway said
the canal which cuts through panama creating an essential shipping route between the atlantic and pacific oceans is a major source of revenue for the central american country
most cargoes passing through the panama canal come from or go to the united states and china panama canal authority chief jorge quijano told reuters late on thursday
tensions between them could ultimately have an impact on the amount of loadings using the waterway in any the administration of president donald trump is readying a list of billion in chinese imports on which it plans to levy tariffs in coming days stepping up the trade war between the world s two largest economies
however quijano said he expected more bulk cargo from brazil the world s largest soy producer would boost canal traffic
brazilian soy has traditionally been shipped across the atlantic and indian oceans but farmers in top soy state mato grosso earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding with the canal to look at ways to cut transport costs and increase grain volumes using the waterway via ports in the north of brazil
new demand for liquefied natural gas lng in countries including japan and mexico could also compensate for fewer vessels going to china quijano added saying the canal has many ways to ease any the panama canal has not disclosed updated figures on vessel transit by volume
in its fiscal year which ended in september it handled a record million tonnes including million tonnes in container ships and million tonnes in bulk carriers
brazil and argentina have already taken a greater share of the asian grains markets leading to lower traffic through the canal in the first few months of quijano said
to offset that panama needs to convince brazilian exporters to use the canal quijano said
about million tonnes of brazilian soy went through the canal last year out of annual soy exports of around million tonnes brazilian data shows
for lng exports almost percent passing through the canal comes from the united states according to figures from the panama canal authority
if china eventually imports less lng from the united states we will see more imports from japan korea and mexico which would compensate quijano said
