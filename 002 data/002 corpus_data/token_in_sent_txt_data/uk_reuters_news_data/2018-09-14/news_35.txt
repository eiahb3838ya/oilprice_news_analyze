europe's carbon market bull run hits a wall
london sept reuters european carbon the year s commodity suffered its biggest fall in a decade this week after a surge in prices triggered a call for government intervention and weak auction demand
losses by a norwegian power trader that left a million hole in the nasdaq clearing house s contingency plan added to market jitters analysts said
benchmark eu allowances euas jumped percent in just four trading sessions hitting a high above euros a tonne before a kicked in
they were trading at at gmt on friday off about percent on the week
after euas jumped to euros poland said it was time for the european commission to act
the situation calls for intervention
we need to ask the european commission to look into it energy minister krzysztof tchorzewski told news agency pap
it wasn t the only factor but the call from poland certainly spooked the market one carbon trader said speaking on condition of anonymity
poland is wary of high carbon prices as that adds costs for its utilities which generate most of their power from polluting coal
it is the first call for intervention but i would imagine that the visgard bloc might follow suit said nick campbell a director at consultancy inspired energy referring to the czech republic hungary and slovakia
the high prices slowed demand at thursday s eu eua auction however with a cover ratio of lower than recent sales and a signal to traders that demand was dwindling
other negatives for carbon this week included thursday s unwinding of positions across the european energy complex after losses by the norwegian power trader
this will make a lot of market participants unsure about trading schemes said martin andreas vik an adviser to the norwegian water resources and energy directorate
while analysts doubted poland would be successful in prompting the eu to act to curb carbon prices the market hitting euros did reignite analysis of reforms set to start next year including the market stability reserve msr which will remove some surplus euas from the market
the eu s emissions trading system ets charges more than factories and power stations for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
it was set up in as part of eu efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions by percent by
yet the market has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis a problem set to be addressed by measures such as the msr
market intervention could also take the form of the eu actually returning surplus euas to the market in the event of runaway prices
reuters analysts estimated prices would have to hold at euros a tonne for six months to meet intervention criteria under article of the eu s carbon market rules
however under article intervention to return allowances would only be triggered if the price rise was not rooted in fundamental reasons
it would be a tough one to argue that the eua price rise is purely speculative and not caused by the anticipation of the supply squeeze due to the market stability reserve thomson reuters carbon analyst hege fjellheim said
the language in the article is open to different interpretations fjellheim said
the european commission declined to elaborate on how the article would work
one source at the commission said it welcomed the stronger prices and that conditions to trigger intervention have not been met
