interview-big three oil states can offset fall in iran supplies: perry
moscow reuters saudi arabia the united states and russia can between them raise global output in the next months to compensate for falling oil supplies from iran and elsewhere energy secretary rick perry said on a visit to moscow on friday
sanctions on iran s oil exports which come into force in november have already cut supply back to lows while falling venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere could push up crude prices hurting consumers
but perry in an interview with reuters said he felt comfortable about the outlook for global crude output and for oil prices
i don t foresee spikes perry said although he added there was always the potential for unforeseen events
some analysts have expressed concerns about saudi arabia s ability to significantly boost output
but perry said there s a number of things going on in the kingdom that continue to give me a very positive feeling about their ability to maintain their level and even increase their level of crude production
he cited the prospect that kuwait and saudi arabia would soon resolve a border dispute unlocking access to an oil field in a contested area
they are working toward a solution in the not too distant future he said
on production which has already been growing over the past few years perry said you look out months and i think you ll see even a more substantial increase in the united states because of pipeline capacity being built russia meanwhile was working diligently to deliver its oil output to the world market perry said
perry was in moscow for talks with his russian counterpart energy minister alexander novak
visits by senior officials are a rarity after relations between moscow and washington nosedived first over the ukraine crisis and later over allegations of russian meddling in the presidential election
the administration of president donald trump has imposed sanctions on russia and perry said that while he would rather not see any more that was a real prospect
you avoid that by being a good citizen
you avoid that by obviously tending to this issue with ukraine you do this by not meddling in our elections you do this by not engaging in activities that are considered to be uncivilized for instance the poisoning of the people in the uk perry said
russia has the opportunity to send a message that they are going to be good neighbors they are going to be civilized in the way they deal with their neighbors
that has yet to be seen from our perspective in dealing with russia s conduct toward other countries would influence whether the united states was compelled to impose sanctions on the nord stream pipeline project
the project will expand the capacity for pumping russian gas to northern europe
trump has criticized it saying it will increase european dependence on russian energy
referring to an roadmap for resolving a conflict in eastern ukraine between kiev and separatists perry said if russia deals with the minsk agreement in an appropriate way there are some signals being sent to the rest of the european until those signals get sent the potential sanctions of nordstream are still very real i ll suggest to you that the ball is in russia s court he said
in the interview perry issued a message for the european union saying it needed to wean itself off its dependence on russian energy supplies
if you re a country in the european union and you see how ukraine has been treated by russia then russia being the sole source or practically the sole source of gas to your country will give you a pause perry told reuters
and i think that s an appropriate and rightful position to take
have alternatives
have competition
have other pipelines he said
so europe by and large understand that they need multiple sources of energy and we agree with additional reporting by dmitry madorsky dmitry zhdannikov and timothy gardner editing by edmund blair
