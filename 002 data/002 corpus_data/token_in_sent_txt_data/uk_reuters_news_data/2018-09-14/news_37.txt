iran says oil market is too tight for u.s. zero exports target
london reuters the will find it difficult to cut iran s oil exports completely as the oil market is already tight and rival producers can not make up the shortfall a top iranian official said on friday
washington is seeking to cut iranian oil exports to zero by november as it reimposes sanctions and is encouraging other producers such as saudi arabia other opec members and russia to pump more to meet the shortfall
even so the expected loss of iranian oil declining supply from another opec member venezuela and other outages are boosting crude prices which this week hit a barrel the highest since may
iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili said in comments to reuters that a supply shortage meant that the united states would not be able to meet its zero export target
there is no spare capacity anywhere he said
a adviser at saudi arabia s energy ministry also said last month that current sanctions on iran were unlikely to stop iranian oil exports completely
under pressure from president donald trump to lower oil prices the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies agreed in june to boost production having participated in a deal in place since
while opec production has increased since then saudi arabia has added less crude than it initially indicated
kazempour has voiced scepticism that other producers can add much more oil
the opec governor is typically the second most senior post in a country s opec delegation after the oil minister
kazempour has represented iran in that position for many years
