netherlands switches gears with world's first used-plastic bike path
london sept thomson reuters foundation dutch cyclists rode down the world s first bike path made entirely of discarded plastic this week in a move aimed at reducing the millions of tonnes wasted every year
the cycling path in the northern town of zwolle contains the equivalent of plastic bottle caps and is estimated to be two to three times more durable than traditional roads
eight million tonnes of plastic bottles packaging and other waste are dumped into the ocean every year killing marine life and entering the human food chain the united nations environment programme has said
this first pilot is a big step towards a sustainable and road made of recycled plastic waste the path s inventors anne koudstaal and simon jorritsma said in a statement
leading environmental expert guus velders welcomed the new initiative by dutch engineering firm kws pipe maker wavin and french oil major total saying it was a positive step towards a more circular use of materials
however emma priestland campaigner with friends of the earth said the solution to plastic pollution lay in preventing its unnecessary use in the first place
using plastic to make bicycle paths may help to keep plastics out of landfill and but it s still unclear what happens to this plastic as the surface of the path is worn away she told the thomson reuters foundation by email
cities such as london amsterdam and paris are looking at how they can shift to a circular economy reusing products parts and materials producing no waste or pollution and using fewer new resources and energy
the dutch government has pledged to halve its use of raw materials by and accelerate its shift towards a circular economy
a second bike path is expected to open in the northeastern dutch village of giethoorn in november
