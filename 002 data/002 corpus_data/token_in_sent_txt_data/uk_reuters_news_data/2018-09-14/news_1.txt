update 4-energy firms, nasdaq to prop up power market after trader default
oslo reuters finnish energy firm fortum will pay approximately million euros million to help replenish a nasdaq commodities contingency fund after the default of a private norwegian trader the company said on friday
electricity derivatives trader einar aas earlier this week racked up losses he could not cover leaving commodities companies who are part of the nasdaq clearing house and the exchange itself to plug a million euro hole
nasdaq said on thursday it had covered million euros of the losses and told members of its commodity clearing operation which include fortum to pay the remaining million within two business days or risk being declared in default themselves
the trader s default was triggered by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads as heavy rain pushed down prices in the nordic region while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up german prices nasdaq said
fortum said its original participation in the contingency fund was approximately million euros of which two thirds was lost when aas portfolio was liquidated
consequently fortum will book approximately million euros in its third quarter results as a financing cost it added
fortum expects nasdaq to have adequate collateral and security arrangements at all times and we will monitor the situation carefully the company said
