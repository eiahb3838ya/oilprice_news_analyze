update 2-china's aluminium smelters cut output in august as costs mount
august aluminium output at mln t bureau lowest on a daily basis since may calculations smelter margins falling sharply on high alumina costs output at mln t down pct from july adds analyst comment alumina market background by tom daly beijing sept reuters china s aluminium producers cut output by percent in august from the month before government data showed on friday as high raw material costs squeeze their profit margins
china the world s biggest aluminium producer churned out million tonnes of the metal last month according to the national bureau of statistics nbs
that was down from million tonnes in july which matched the monthly high but was up percent from a year earlier the nbs said
on a daily basis china produced around tonnes of primary aluminium last month the lowest since may according to reuters calculations based on the data
aluminium prices on the shanghai futures exchange climbed percent over august but spot prices for alumina the substance used to make the metal rose by percent in the key eastern china region over the same period pressuring smelters
the global alumina market has been tight this year due to an outage at norsk hydro s alunorte plant in brazil sanctions on russian producer rusal and a strike at alcoa s alumina refineries in western australia
chinese alumina producers have taken advantage of skyrocketing international alumina prices to make rare exports of the material which has reduced availability domestically
victor you an analyst at clsa in hong kong said he had heard of aluminium production cuts being made in central china s henan province which he described as traditionally a very place to run aluminium smelters
that s because a lot of the smelters do not have an integrated alumina operation
if they have to source from outside it is going to be pretty rough for them he said
spot alumina prices in central china are currently at their highest since december
aluminium margins have been falling sharply so it wouldn t surprise me if some curtailments happened you added
over the first eight months of china produced million tonnes of aluminium up percent the nbs data showed on friday
output of a group of nonferrous metals including copper aluminium lead zinc and nickel rose percent to million tonnes but was down percent from million tonnes in july
output from this group in the first eight months was up percent at million tonnes
the other metals in the group are tin antimony mercury magnesium and titanium
