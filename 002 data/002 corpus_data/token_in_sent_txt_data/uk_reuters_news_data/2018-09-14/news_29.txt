u.s. drillers add oil rigs for second week in three -baker hughes
sept reuters energy companies this week added oil rigs for the second time in the last three weeks even as new drilling has largely stalled since june due to pipeline constraints in the country s biggest oilfield
drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to the biggest weekly increase in a month bringing the total count to general electric co s baker hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on friday
the rig count an early indicator of future output is higher than a year ago when rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in than previous years
but the rig count has held mostly steady around rigs since the start of june as crude prices in the permian region in western texas and eastern new mexico have collapsed due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure needed to transport more fuel out of the region
the permian is the biggest shale oil formation in the united states
the only way to get drillers in the permian to slow their production growth is a lower oil price
and that is exactly what they have got said bjarne schieldrop chief commodities analyst at seb a nordic corporate bank
a shale boom has helped send production surging above million barrels per day bpd this year for the first time since the with the united states surpassing russia and saudi arabia as the top crude producer according to the energy information administration this week
the eia however said in its monthly forecast that crude oil production in was expected to grow at a slower rate than previously forecast
crude production is expected to rise by bpd to million bpd next year lower than last month s forecast growth of a to million
crude prices were trading at about per barrel on track to increase about percent this week on talk of sanctions against iran that boosted the global benchmark brent futures to a high over a barrel earlier this week
so far this year oil futures have averaged per barrel
that compares with averages of in calendar and in
looking ahead crude futures were trading near for the balance of and over for calendar
in anticipation of higher prices in than financial services firm cowen co this week said the exploration and production e p companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an percent increase this year in planned capital spending
cowen said the e ps it tracks expect to spend a total of billion in
that compares with projected spending of billion in
analysts at simmons co energy specialists at investment bank piper jaffray this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from in to in in and in
since oil and gas rigs were already in service drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit simmons forecast for
so far this year the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the united states has averaged
that keeps the total count for on track to be the highest since which averaged rigs
most rigs produce both oil and gas
