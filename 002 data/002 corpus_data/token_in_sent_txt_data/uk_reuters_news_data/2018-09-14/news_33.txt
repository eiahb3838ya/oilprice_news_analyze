brazil's btg pactual may keep petrobras africa stake -source
sao paulo sept reuters brazil s largest independent investment bank banco btg pactual sa may keep its stake in petrobras oil and gas bv petrobras africa to avoid having to book a loss in a potential sale one source with knowledge of the matter said on friday
in june reuters reported that a consortium led by top oil trader vitol had entered exclusive talks to acquire petroafrica as the company is known in a bid estimated to be worth up to billion
oil company petroleo brasileiro sa which owns percent of the venture would be the lead seller in such a deal but btg s percent stake and helios investment partners percent would also be candidates for sale
if petroafrica were sold at vitol s proposed price btg would have to book a loss however as the bank paid billion for its initial percent stake acquired in according to the source who could not speak for attribution because the discussions are private
although btg had previously decided in favor of selling the stake the bank now believes that petroafrica which participates in two deepwater oil exploration blocks off the coast of nigeria will start to generate a stable cash flow bringing regular dividends to the bank soon
btg would still be willing to sell if vitol were to raise its bid the source added
btg vitol and petroafrica did not immediately comment on the matter
petroafrica is one of the last remaining stakes btg pactual owns in individual companies
after its founder andre esteves was arrested in late on corruption charges the bank was forced to shed assets and btg partners decided to divest illiquid stakes
a brazilian federal judge acquitted esteves in july
earlier on friday newspaper valor econ√¥mico reported that btg intended to keep its stake in petroafrica but that no decision had yet been made
