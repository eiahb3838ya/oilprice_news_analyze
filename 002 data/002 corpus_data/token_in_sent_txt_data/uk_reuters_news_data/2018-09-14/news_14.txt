update 1-china's sinopec plans to build canadian oil refinery
adds comments from minister s spokesman analyst by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba sept reuters china s sinopec corp has joined a group planning to build an oil refinery in alberta an enterprise that would strengthen demand for the canadian province s heavily discounted crude
sinopec formally known as china petroleum chemical corp along with an alberta indigenous group china state construction engineering corp and alberta management company teedrum plan to build a refinery to process barrels per day of crude into gasoline and other products the project s consulting firm stantec inc said in a statement on thursday
the sinocan global refinery would cost c billion with a financing plan still to be worked out said teedrum president ken horn who is leading the effort
ownership has not been determined
the group hopes to receive regulatory approval from the alberta and canadian governments within two years he said in an interview on friday
most of the refined products will be exported
it helps create value for the bitumen horn said referring to the tarry form of alberta s heavy crude
right now we ship most of that crude out of the province
we should do a lot more to maximize the value of that most of canada s crude is produced in landlocked alberta where pipeline capacity has not expanded as rapidly as production
resulting bottlenecks have hindered transportation to refineries steepening an already deep price discount for the province s crude which grew to a high this week
sinopec s interest is encouraging news for a canadian sector that has seen foreign oil majors retreat over concerns about high production costs and the oil sands environmental toll
china s involvement would complement its existing alberta investments horn said
cnooc ltd bought energy producer nexen in
if sinopec plans to ship refined products from canada to china it would likely move them by rail to the pacific coast since pipeline space is limited said gmp firstenergy analyst michael dunn
it may make more sense for china to import canadian crude and refine it domestically he said
alberta s previous government declined to support the refinery proposal in after deciding the project did not make economic sense
this time the project involves china and is not soliciting government help horn said
a spokesman for alberta energy minister margaret said on friday that building a refinery is ambitious and positive for the economy if the project can competitively move refined products offshore
sinopec could not be reached
