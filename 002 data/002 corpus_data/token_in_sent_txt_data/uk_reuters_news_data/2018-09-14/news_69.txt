interview-in shift, pakistani giant engro to bet big on rising middle class
karachi pakistan reuters pakistan s conglomerate engro corp has seen its fortunes rise on the back of massive chinese investment but plans to shape its future growth around the country s vast population and expanding middle class its chief executive said
engro corp best known for its fertilizer and petrochemicals factories as well as engineering projects is pakistan s largest listed conglomerate and after recovering from a brush with bankruptcy in the early part of this decade is now sitting on a million million pounds cash pile
it has been a major beneficiary from beijing s belt and road initiative splurge working with chinese firms on coal and power projects worth billions of dollars
engro s rising fortunes since when its factories were crippled by gas shortages mirror the improvements in pakistan a nation where economic growth has accelerated due to vast chinese investment and a sharp drop in militancy and power outages
in the near term engro s outlook is linked to a billion coal mine in the thar desert near the border with india part of beijing s pledge to invest about billion in pakistan
but with pakistan s new government hinting it may review belt and road contracts due to concerns they were too expensive some analysts see risks on the horizon for engro and say planned power plants around the mine may struggle to obtain financing
ghias khan engro s chief executive told reuters this week he was pretty confident the government would not deals with sovereign guarantees
if they do that will have a very negative impact khan said
this year pakistan s economy has also been shaken by a shortage of dollars and speculation islamabad may turn to the international monetary fund to ease current account pressures
undeterred by chinese investment jitters and the recently wobbly economy khan said engro was weighing acquisitions and starting new businesses in agriculture healthcare real estate communications and other sectors to profit from rising incomes in the muslim majority country of million people percent of whom are aged under
we ve come to a realization what has gotten engro where it is today is not good enough for our next phase of growth khan said in an interview at engro s headquarters in karachi an arabian sea metropolis
what we are proud of is our ability to execute projects and put up large industrial complexes
but we are mindful we have to get into businesses which are more related to the population growth and take us closer to the in karachi mushrooming shopping malls and number of cars on the road point to a consumer boom as people s disposable incomes have doubled this decade analysts say
khan compared pakistan s current economic level population growth and per capita income which stands at about to where china south korea and india were at earlier points in their development
if you look at sectors that did well when they were where pakistan is today like real estate automobiles healthcare logistics everything is somehow related or linked to population growth or the middle class khan said
the company born out of an employees buyout of exxon s pakistan operations in the was also looking to go deeper into the petrochemicals sector and was exploring projects to set up naphtha ethane crackers or polypropylene facilities in the ports of karachi or gwadar khan added
what engro will do with its cash pile of about billion rupees million has been a hot topic in pakistan s equity market
one thing is very clear how we invest these billion rupees will determine how this organization looks years from now said khan adding a decision would be made hopefully soon
in the meantime the company is busily expanding its coal projects in thar located in the remote deserts of sindh province of which karachi is the capital
helped by beijing s cash and chinese expertise engro began digging the thar mine in with china machinery engineering corporation cmec
the coal will feed into a power plant engro is building part of about of generation planned by various pakistani consortiums by
pakistan says it has the world s largest coal reserves but it is of the lignite variety and for decades successive attempts at mining have failed
analysts say engro has locked in returns on equity of about percent per annum in dollar terms and with a sovereign guarantee on the power projects
engro declined to reveal equity returns on power projects but with pakistan looking to control its ballooning current account deficit to avoid another imf bailout khan said the new government was likely to want power plants that do not rely on imported fuel
