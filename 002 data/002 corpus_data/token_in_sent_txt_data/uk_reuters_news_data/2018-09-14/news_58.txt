ahead of winter, chinese steel mills rush to meet stricter smog rules
beijing reuters steel mills in tangshan china s top steelmaking city are rushing to install equipment to meet new emissions targets by an deadline as the measures to battle pollution threaten more upheaval in the sector
only a handful of mills have installed the technology that removes sulfur nitrogen and dust and costs up to million yuan million according to analysts who have tracked the more than sintering plants in the city affected by the new rules which were only announced in july
everyone is trying to speed up the upgrade project
still time is very tight said an environmental manager at hebei donghai special steel co a privately owned mill with annual capacity of million tonnes
she declined to be named as she is not authorized to talk to media
the environment ministry said in february it would enforce tough new emissions on steel mills but did not give details
in july the tangshan city government ordered companies in the steel coke and power sectors to comply with the new standards and gave mills until to meet the targets
until last week only five of the sintering machines in tangshan that need to be upgraded have met the stricter emissions targets according to research by analysts at huatai futures and guosen securities
much is at stake for mills
those that comply with the restrictions in time will be exempt from curbs to output during the winter heating season
if they miss the deadline they will have to cut output and the government has warned that some sintering plants may be shut down
this is the second year that china will force steel mills aluminum smelters and other heavy industry in the smoggiest northern regions to cut output during winter to counter a rise in emissions from the country s power stations due to increased demand for heating
tangshan delong steel co ltd a privately owned mill with annual capacity of million tonnes started work on its upgrade last year and is one of the first to comply with the new standards
it takes time to install and test the devices said kan ruimin manager at the engineering department
mills must cut the concentration of particulate matters to micrograms per cubic meter from micrograms while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide concentrations must drop to micrograms from and to micrograms from respectively
big mills are enforcing the emission regulations but for some producers funding is a big obstacle said zhao yu steel analyst at huatai futures
closures of sintering plants will likely spur demand for iron ore pellets adding further upwards pressure on prices which have risen a third this year zhao said
iron ore fines go through a highly pollutive sintering process before they are thrown into the furnace to make steel
higher grade iron ore pellets can go straight into the furnace avoiding that process
