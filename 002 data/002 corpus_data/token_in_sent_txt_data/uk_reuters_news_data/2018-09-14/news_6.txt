update 4-venezuela hands china more oil presence, but no mention of new funds
reuters venezuela gave china another stake in the opec nation s oil industry and signed several other deals in the energy sector but beijing made no mention of new funds for caracas during president nicolas maduro s visit to his key financier on friday
maduro s leftist government sold a percent stake in the sinovensa joint venture where china national petroleum corporation has a percent share to china it said in a statement
the statement also said china and venezuela had signed a memorandum for cooperation in ayacucho bloc located in venezuela s vast orinoco belt without elaborating
china will drill wells in ayacucho and extend million in financing for the joint oil venture petrozumano the statement added
a source at pdvsa who asked to remain anonymous because he is not allowed to speak to media said oil services and procurement at sinovensa would be handled by chinese companies
it was unclear what china which has ploughed more than billion into venezuela through agreements was giving in return
pdvsa and venezuela s information ministry did not respond to a request for information about the deal
maduro said on thursday he was going to china on a trip with great expectations and promised to return with big premier li keqiang told maduro that beijing was willing to provide the country with what help it can according to chinese government statements on friday
but there was no reference in chinese state media or in chinese government statements to new funds for venezuela which is struggling with a fifth year of recession and an economy wracked by hyperinflation
over a decade agreements helped china secure energy supplies for its economy while bolstering an ally in latin america
the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago however when venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its economy into a hyperinflationary collapse
venezuela s finance ministry in july said it would receive million from the china development bank to boost oil production but offered no details
venezuela previously accepted a billion loan from china for its struggling oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount
in a separate meeting with chinese president xi jinping maduro said venezuela was willing to explore effective financing methods with china and strengthen cooperation in the energy sector chinese state media said citing maduro without elaborating
xi told maduro china would as before support the venezuelan government s efforts to seek stability and development
