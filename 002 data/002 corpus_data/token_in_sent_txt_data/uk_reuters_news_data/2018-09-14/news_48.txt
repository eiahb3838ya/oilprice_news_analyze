most new diesel vehicles exceed emissions limits - german green lobby
berlin reuters most new diesel vehicles exceed the legal limit for nitrogen oxide nox emissions german environmental lobby group duh said on friday calling on the government to force car companies to carry out hardware retrofits of polluting cars
almost three years after volkswagen admitted to deliberately cheating pollution tests germany s car industry which employs some people and is the country s biggest exporter is under intense pressure to cut diesel fumes
a court ruled last week that frankfurt germany s financial centre must ban older diesel vehicles from the city centre from next february as part of a plan to improve air quality
the city of hamburg this year voluntarily blocked older diesel models from using selected trunk roads
other cities including aachen duesseldorf and stuttgart home to daimler and porsche are also considering bans
juergen resch head of the duh a lobby group which has advocated banning polluting cars from roads told a news conference its tests showed the latest technology was just as dirty as older versions
resch said tests carried about by the duh s emissions control institute eki found models of the diesel generation released nox on average times the legal limit when tested in real driving conditions
only percent of vehicles kept to the legal ceiling for nox of he added
we ve had enough and believe the german chancellor must act resch said
remo klinger a lawyer for the duh said the association planned to submit a further seven suits against the towns of hagen bielefeld freiburg limburg oberhausen oldenburg and wuppertal for violating air quality
this brings the total number of suits to it said
german chancellor angela merkel has said she will do everything possible to avoid driving bans but disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nox emissions have strained her coalition with the social democrats
a working group of german government officials and car industry lobbyists has recommended hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles as a way to avert bans
the government said it is due to decide soon whether costly retrofits are appropriate
