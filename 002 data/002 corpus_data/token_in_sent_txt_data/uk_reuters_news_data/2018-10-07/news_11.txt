don't export old diesels to eastern europe, eu warns german carmakers
berlin reuters the european commission fears that carmakers in germany would seek to export old diesel cars removed from german streets under planned incentives to eastern european countries industry commissioner elzbieta bienkowska said on sunday
german carmakers and the government hashed out a compromise deal to cut pollution from diesel vehicles last week after environmental groups won a victory in february which allowed cities to ban older diesel cars
the government has asked carmakers to offer owners incentives and hardware fixes
not all carmakers committed to the retrofits as the hardware fixes are known which would cost billions of euros
most said the solution should be to encourage car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles which would bring a boost in sales albeit at discounted prices
exports would mean pushing the air quality problem from the west to the east bienkowska told the tagesspiegel newspaper in remarks to be published on monday
the german government s plan to avoid driving bans could intensify the germany s environment ministry has said it would try to overcome resistance from car makers to the expensive new exhaust filtering systems
last year bulgaria imported more than second hand cars from eu countries more than a third of which were grossly polluting diesels according to clean mobility group transport and environment
it should be clearly determined what happens to the and poorly adjusted vehicles said bienkowska adding that the issue was a european problem not a national one
chancellor angela merkel on saturday defended the compromise saying it was essential to prevent driving bans in german cities which would affect hundreds of thousands of diesel car owners who commute to work from the countryside to urban centres
but speaking at an event of the youth wing of her conservatives merkel also said car makers had lied and cheated by selling diesel cars that pollute more than the industry had said they would

that people are becoming suspicious is the fault of the car industry not politicians merkel said in the northern city of kiel
