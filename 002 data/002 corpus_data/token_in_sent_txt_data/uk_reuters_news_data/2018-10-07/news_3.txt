trump to announce pro-ethanol measure on tuesday ahead of iowa trip -sources
new york reuters president donald trump is expected to announce the lifting of a federal ban on summer sales of blends of gasoline on tuesday in washington dc ahead of a trip to iowa the same day according to two sources familiar with the planning of the event
the move expected sometime around on tuesday is aimed at helping republicans in competitive elections in the nation s farm belt
iowa is the largest producer of ethanol
the lifting of the summer ban on gasoline is expected to be coupled with restrictions on trading biofuel credits that underpin the program the sources said but it s unclear whether the restrictions will be detailed or left up to the environmental protection agency to decide
the american petroleum institute the largest oil group opposes lifting the ban which will eat into the industry s market share of gasoline sales
the move also faces bipartisan opposition in congress
the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool each year or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that must buy the credits have complained about volatile prices in recent years
the summer ban was put in place as an measure though studies have since shown its environmental benefits are limited
trump will direct epa to write a rule lifting the ban and it would have to be to have it finalized before the next summer driving season
