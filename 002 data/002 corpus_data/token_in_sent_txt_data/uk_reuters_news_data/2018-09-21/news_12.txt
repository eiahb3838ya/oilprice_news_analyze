venezuelans block streets with cars to protest gas shortage in andes
san cristobal venezuela reuters dozens of venezuelans on friday brought the andean city of san cristobal to a standstill by blocking roads with their cars to protest gas shortages that have piled further misery on the opec nation s citizens
we have been here since tuesday night waiting for a delivery truck and it is unacceptable for us to be begging for gasoline in an country said maria auxiliadora prato as she cut off one of the city s main avenues with her car
national guard soldiers later made protesters remove their vehicles from the middle of the street but angry venezuelans instead used branches bottles tires and garbage bags to snarl traffic
we have had to take our pillows to the car to be able to sleep during a wait for litres gallons of gas said protester cesar mendez speaking next to a queue of hundreds of cars waiting for gas
we do not have money to eat the meat that the president eats added a mendez in reference to president nicolas maduro s expensive steak dinner at a salt bae restaurant in istanbul this month
venezuela which has the world s cheapest gasoline has been plagued by intermittent fuel shortages in recent months as its oil industry struggles with lower production and problematic refineries
maduro s leftist government blamed the shortages on power cuts in nearby zulia an state that is suffering blackouts because power stations lack maintenance and spare parts
government critics say inept management of venezuela s oil industry home to the world s biggest crude reserves is to blame for the shortages
tachira without gas thanks to failed communism tweeted tachira opposition legislator franklyn duarte
the government this month also rolled out a new payment system in eight states near the colombian border including tachira where san cristobal is located in an attempt to halt widespread smuggling of venezuela s gas to colombia
maduro says the payment system will pave the way for charging international prices for fuel a massive increase given that gas is now almost free as his government seeks to shore up state coffers amid a hyperinflationary economic meltdown
the pilot programme was designed to provide service stations with wireless devices that use a controversial identification document to carry out transactions
the document called the fatherland card is meant to provide subsidies to motorists to help soften the impact of the steep price increases
maduro announced on thursday night that the programme would be rolled out in the rest of venezuela on monday
