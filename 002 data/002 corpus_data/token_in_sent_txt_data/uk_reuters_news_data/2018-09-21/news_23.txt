china may issue more fuel export quotas to refiners to prevent run cuts -sources
beijing sept reuters china may issue an additional million to million tonnes of permits for refined fuel exports for to prevent refiners from having to slash throughput rates according to three sources briefed on the matter
the government has been looking to keep fuel export quotas at around million tonnes this year steady with levels to maintain overall trade balances
but the state refiners have been using the quotas already granted for this year faster than expected rushing to ship more gasoline diesel and jet kerosene overseas in the first nine months compared to the same period of because domestic refinery production has expanded faster than demand
while exports may not be as lucrative as sales in the domestic market where margins are largely guaranteed the overseas shipments helped bolster margins at home by thinning local fuel supplies
refiners including sinopec corp petrochina cnooc and sinochem will have already used about million tonnes or percent of the total grants so far by according to a state oil executive with direct knowledge of the situation
the big oil firms are trying this week to persuade the government to release more quotas or they may be forced to cut runs in the fourth quarter as the remainder is far from enough said the executive
most refiners would try to avoid reducing runs in the fourth quarter when diesel fuel demand typically picks up with an increase in construction activities and the lifting of a summer fishing ban and the golden week holiday of early october which lifts gasoline and jet fuel consumption
the three sources at state oil firms estimated the government could issue an additional million to million tonnes of fuel export quotas as early as next week
the sources declined to be named as the discussions are not public
representatives of cnpc sinopec cnooc and sinochem did not respond to requests for comment
the national development reform commission ndrc and ministry of commerce also did not respond to queries
chinese customs data showed huge gains in transportation fuel exports this year
gasoline exports in the first seven months grew percent over the same period last year to million tonnes diesel rose percent to million tonnes and jet kerosene gained percent to million tonnes
refiners earned bumper profits this year as diesel demand firmed while many small fuel blenders were forced out of business and some independent oil processors slashed output over the summer months because of stricter government tax scrutiny enacted from march
