exclusive, update 2-opec and allies consider oil output boost as iranian supply falls -source
algiers reuters opec and other oil producers are discussing the possibility of raising output by barrels per day bpd to counter falling supply from iran because of sanctions a source familiar with the discussions told reuters
the development comes as oil reached a barrel this month prompting president donald trump to call again on the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec to help to bring down prices
opec russia and other allies agreed a deal in late to cut supply but after months of cutting by more than the pact had called for they agreed in june to boost output by returning to percent compliance
that equates to an increase of about million bpd
the current discussions are not finalised but it would mean that oil producers would need to lower compliance to less than percent the source said on friday
benchmark brent oil prices fell by more than on the news of a potential output boost slipping to below a barrel
opec and its allies will gather in algeria over the weekend to review compliance with existing cuts
three opec and sources told reuters on friday that latest data has shown that opec and its allies supplied less oil in august to world markets than they did in july mainly because of a drop in iranian production
in july opec and producers reduced output by percent more than called for in their pact
the cut in august was even higher the three sources said without providing exact figures which will be discussed in algiers this weekend
opec sources said that any official action to raise output would require opec to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting a proposal that is not on the table yet
but the joint opec and ministerial committee known as the jmmc which meets on sunday can still recommend a further increase in output if needed the sources said
there are discussions to increase production by another bpd
they opec and can increase output when they meet in december the source said referring to the next formal opec meeting scheduled for
on thursday president trump linked american support for middle eastern countries to oil prices as he again urged opec to lower prices
we protect the countries of the middle east they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices
we will remember
the opec monopoly must get prices down now trump wrote on twitter
opec s july decision to raise oil production also followed a series of trump tweets
rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for trump before november congressional elections by offsetting republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped to boost the economy
iran opec s producer behind saudi arabia and iraq has pledged to block any supply increases
tehran says the price rally was instigated by trump himself when he decided to put additional sanctions on iranian oil sales
it has also accused saudi arabia of discrediting opec by following instructions from the united states which is not part of the group
iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh does not plan to attend the meeting in algiers
all opec production policy decisions must in theory gain percent approval from its members
