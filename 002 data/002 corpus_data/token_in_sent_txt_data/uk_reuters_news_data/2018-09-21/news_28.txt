norway's gas exports hit summer high, set to match 2017 annual record
importers refilled in may august after cold winter gassco transported bcm to europe in germany s emden terminal helped summer deliveries by lefteris karagiannopoulos oslo sept reuters norway s gas exports hit a new high of billion cubic metres bcm this summer and the annual deliveries will be on a par with the record annual figure achieved in gas system operator gassco said on friday
between may and august which is normally a season with fewer gas exports norway s deliveries almost matched a normal winter level as european importers needed to refill depleted gas storages which drained during last year s cold winter
it s too early to say exactly where we ll end up this year but we expect another good performance which will be roughly on a par with the record gassco chief executive frode leversund said in a statement
gassco transported bcm through pipeline systems from norway to continental europe and britain during
this was the highest volume sold in years of norwegian gas exports
exports to germany via the emden terminal which became operational in made a strong contribution to this summer s record deliveries gassco added
not only has norway s continental shelf delivered larger volumes than before but the transport system has also handled these increased quantities well said leversund
later this year norway will open its new polarled pipeline to carry more gas from its aasta hansteen field in the norwegian sea said gassco
as operator of both polarled and nyhamna we expect great interest in this region from a number of players
our strong summer deliveries strengthen that belief it said
aasta hansteen is expected to start sending gas to gassco s nyhamna processing plant from october equinor said earlier this year
