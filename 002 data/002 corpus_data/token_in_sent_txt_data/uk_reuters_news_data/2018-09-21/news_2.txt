keystone xl pipeline route would not harm environment -u.s. state dept
washington reuters the state department on friday issued an environmental assessment of a revised route for the keystone xl crude pipeline that concluded it would not harm water or wildlife clearing a hurdle for the project that has been pending for a decade
even if the pipeline spilled crude oil along its revised route through nebraska a top concern of environmentalists there would likely be no impact to groundwater the nearly draft review said
prompt cleanup response would likely be capable of remediating the contaminated soils before the hazardous release reaches groundwater depth the review said
last month a federal judge in montana had ordered the state department to conduct the review of a revised route of the project to take into account new information relevant to a permit it issued for the pipeline last year
the review also said implementing the revised route would have no significant direct indirect or cumulative effects on the quality of the natural or human president donald trump is eager to see the building of the pipeline which was axed by former president barack obama in on environmental concerns relating to emissions that cause climate change
the project has galvanized environmentalists tribal groups and ranchers in opposition to the billion mile km pipeline that would carry heavy crude from canada s oil sands in alberta to steele city nebraska
from there the crude would be sent to refineries and potentially for export
canadian oil producers who face discounts for their crude due to transport bottlenecks refineries and pipeline builders support the project
transcanada corp plans to start construction in spokesman matthew john said
the company s chief executive russ girling said last month that it could make a final investment decision on the project late this year or in early pending some regulatory approvals and court challenges
robert kwan an rbc analyst said the draft review was a positive step for keystone xl
environmentalists said the review was an example of the trump administration trying to push through a project that would risk harming water resources and increase dependence on crude
we ve held off construction of this pipeline for years and regardless of this administration s attempts to force this dirty tar sands pipeline on the american people that fight will continue until keystone xl is stopped once and for all said kelly martin the beyond dirty fuels campaign director for sierra club
