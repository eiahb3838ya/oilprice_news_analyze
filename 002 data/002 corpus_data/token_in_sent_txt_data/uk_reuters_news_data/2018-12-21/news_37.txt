exclusive-nigerian energy sector's crippling debts delay next power plant
lagos reuters plans to build another power station in nigeria to help end decades of chronic blackouts have been delayed because of concerns about persistent shortfalls in payments for electricity across the sector
the billion qua iboe power plant being developed by energy infrastructure company black rhino and the nigerian national petroleum corporation won t get a green light by the end of as planned and it was unclear when the deal might close nnpc told reuters
the delay is a setback for africa s biggest oil producer where million people don t have access to grid power supplies and it exposes the difficulties in attracting private investment to a sector that successive governments have tried to reform
the uncertainty surrounding the qua iboe plant stems from the difficulties nigeria s first independent power project the plant has encountered since it came online this year
azura was meant to be a model for a string of independent power plants financed by international investors
to give them confidence to invest in the first major plant since the power sector was privatised in the world bank provided a safeguard known as a partial risk guarantee meaning the lender would step in if nigeria defaulted on payments
under the current system the nigerian bulk electricity trading company nbet buys power from generators and passes it on to distributors who then collect money from customers and reimburse nbet
but because nbet is not paid in full for the power it buys generators such as azura have been partly reimbursed from an emergency central bank loan fund created to keep the sector afloat
nnpc told reuters one of the reasons the qua iboe plant qipp which is due to be built in the southern state of akwa ibom had been delayed was because nbet appeared reluctant to commit to new projects to avoid increasing its liabilities
the continued delay relates to the current cashflow challenges at nbet as highlighted by the azura project a spokesman for nnpc said in an emailed statement
this concern is justified by the fact that nbet is yet to see an improvement in collections from discos distribution companies nbet did not immediately respond to a request for comment on nnpc s statement about qipp
nbet chief executive marilyn amobi told reuters in november that it was hard for the company to work because of poor infrastructure and shortfalls in cash from distributors needed to reimburse generators
you don t have the infrastructure you don t have the financial position to do it you don t actually have the products and you don t have the grid she said
nnpc said another problem for qipp was that the world bank had made a partial risk guarantee similar to the one that helped azura attract investors contingent on the government s implementation of an agreed power sector recovery plan
in theory it is okay but the risk is there are delays in the approvals which may impact qipp nnpc said
power ministry officials and the world bank have been in talks about structural changes needed to trigger the release of a billion loan to help pay for reforms
a world bank spokeswoman said the loan had yet to be submitted to its board for approval and that the lender considered the recovery plan to be critical for the sector for private investments
problems that need to be tackled include decaying infrastructure mounting debts low tariffs for electricity and a dilapidated grid that would collapse if all the country s power generators operated at full tilt
even though nbet has an agreement to buy gigawatts gw from power generators the system can only cope with distributors sending out an average of gw according to the ministry of power
the world bank spokeswoman confirmed any future guarantees for independent power plants ipps would be linked to the plan s implementation because the economic and financial viability of generation capacity expansion was at risk
a spokeswoman for black rhino which is one of private equity firm blackstone s portfolio companies declined to comment on nnpc s announcement of a delay to qipp
when the project was unveiled nigerian cement giant dangote group was named as a joint venture partner along with black rhino and the nigerian national petroleum corporation
but a dangote executive told reuters on condition of anonymity that the company owned by africa s richest man aliko dangote had pulled out
the huge debt level and the fact the ipps are not making profits is another reason for prospective investors to be deterred he said
further collecting revenue from the distribution companies is also becoming a a dangote group spokesman declined to comment on the delay to qipp or whether the company had pulled out
the payment problems in the nigerian power sector were thrust into the spotlight in march when four generating companies filed a lawsuit against the government and azura
to ensure the generating companies were paid in full throughout and the government created a billion naira billion loan fund at the central bank to guarantee payments
when the fund was established in azura wasn t part of the calculations
but when azura started producing electricity the fund was also used to pay the new plant to ensure the terms of loan deals guaranteed by the world bank were not breached
as a result the other companies were told they would only receive percent of the sums owed according to the lawsuit filed in march
the four energy companies want the fund to reimburse them in full rather than allocating part of the money to the new plant
azura declined to comment on payments for power generated
if the central bank wasn t paying the system would collapse an official at a multilateral lender said on condition of anonymity
qua iboe ipp would enter a system that is illiquid and insolvent
the liquidity is being provided by the central the official said qipp would need the same partial risk guarantee azura received to get off the ground but the handling of payments to azura by the nigerian authorities so far meant there was little appetite to offer the same support
fola fagbule senior vice president and head of advisory at africa finance corporation afc one of the multilateral lenders that invested in azura agreed that the qua iboe project would struggle without payment guarantees
what you have is an insolvent system he said
it is really difficult to make a case for a project on that a person with direct knowledge of qipp who declined to be named said azura s experience was damaging international investors view of nigeria africa s most populous nation
there has to be some understanding of how the sector is going to be able to afford new electrons coming into the grid the person said
those involved do not want qipp to build a project that could just end up in a default nigeria s privatised power sector typically does not use meters to provide invoices bill collections are low and energy tariffs have remained fixed for three years meaning customers receive unsustainably cheap electricity
the effect say industry experts is that electricity distribution companies recover so little revenue from customers that they pay less than a third of what they owe to generating companies and that s why debts have ballooned
sunday oduntan spokesman for the association of nigerian electricity distributors said debt levels in the sector were caused by the artificial suppression of tariffs
he said there was a trillion naira billion market shortfall that meant distributors were unable to invest in improvements
you can not be selling a product below cost price and expect high remittance
the shortfall in the sector is because of the lack of a tariff said oduntan who speaks on behalf of nigeria s electricity distribution companies
debts across the sector partly stem from a currency crisis that took hold in just months after azura secured its financing
the bulk of power company costs are in dollars but customers pay for power in naira
the naira lost about percent of its value against the dollar in june but the devaluation was not factored into a government tariff structure that has remained unchanged
louis edozien permanent secretary in the ministry of power told reuters there was evidence tariffs must rise but it was also the responsibility of distributors to improve their collections partly through better metering and infrastructure
as for the future of qipp the state oil company said it would take six to eight months from whenever nbet executes an agreement to purchase power from the plant before a final investment decision could be taken
the nnpc spokesman said there were a number of other knotty issues including the completion of a transmission line from the project site
he said qipp had now agreed in a major concession to pay million for it to be finished
he also said there was a disagreement between qipp and the central bank about the exchange rate at which power producers could buy dollars with naira
he said this had been escalated to the minister of finance
with the billion world bank power sector loan on hold for now the government is considering putting another billion naira into the central bank fund to pay generators when the initial amount runs out early next year sources said
it was not clear how the central bank loans to the sector would be repaid
central bank governor godwin emefiele told reuters that payments from the fund could be made up to february and that the bank was holding talks with world bank officials
the loan negotiations are still in progress with no terminal date yet fixed the power ministry s edozien said
