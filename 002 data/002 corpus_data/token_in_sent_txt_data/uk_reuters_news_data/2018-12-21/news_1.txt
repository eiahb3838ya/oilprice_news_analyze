fsru suppliers shift from emerging markets, cut back new orders
london dec reuters political instability and low credit ratings in emerging economies are putting some shipowners off ordering new floating storage and regasification units fsrus as they shift focus to more mature gas markets
liquefied natural gas lng demand from emerging markets in asia africa and south america was expected to be boosted by fsru technologies that are less expensive and than onshore import terminals
but a boom in speculative fsru orders from shipowners led to an oversupply of units this year as import projects across the world were delayed or cancelled suggesting demand had been overestimated
norway s hoegh lng announced on friday a second contract for an fsru in australia this year
the fsru project for the import of lng at crib point in victoria developed by australia s agl energy ltd will allow hoegh to charter out its fsru for years
the move comes as australia s eastern states suffer from gas shortages even though lng production on the west coast made the country the largest lng producer in november
in august hoegh lng won a tender for an import project in new south wales developed by australian industrial energy a consortium that includes japan s jera and marubeni we will only work with either major energy or state companies now hoegh s chief executive sveinung stoehle told reuters
hoegh has pulled out of fsru projects in ghana chile and pakistan due to delays and cancellations
stoehle said he sees asia as the main market for hoegh fsrus now
the fsru hoegh esperanza started a contract for china s cnooc this year
stoehle hopes to deliver one more fsru to china in the next two years
we will not place new orders until we have deals for our existing fsrus he added
with the australian deals concluded hoegh is thought to have two fsrus still not committed to a contract
however the company is a frontrunner for an import project in an asian country with a decision due within a year stoehle said
hoegh is also in advanced talks with germany s uniper on the sharjah fsru project in the united arab emirates a source familiar with the talks said
other shipowners appear to be taking a similar strategy
belgium s exmar said it also would look for contracts before ordering new vessels
after the sale of a percent stake in its four units to firm excelerate energy in the company has only one fsru a unit chartered for years to swiss trading house gunvor for a bangladesh import project now halted by political uncertainty in the country
we have not taken any final decision yet but its chances are very thin said mohammad quamruzzaman managing director of rupantarita prakritik gas co the unit in charge of lng imports at bangladesh s oil firm petrobangla
japan s mitsui
lines mol said it had not placed new orders for fsrus this year either adding that it was awaiting a final investment decision fid on an import project in germany also developed by uniper
fid on this project is targeted to take place within an mol spokesman said
we will order fsru for the project after keith bainbridge director of cs lng shipping consultancy said he would be surprised to see any fsru orders apart from the mol germany fsru in
the oversupply of units led to around seven fsrus being employed as lng carriers this year shipbrokers said
the problem of oversupply goes back to domestic politics in emerging economies bainbridge said
