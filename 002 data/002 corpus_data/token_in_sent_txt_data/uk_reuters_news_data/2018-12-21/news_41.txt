rpt-insight-want to sue venezuela for millions? these firms can help, for a price
repeats for additional clients with no changes to text by tom hals wilmington del dec reuters as venezuela collapses one investment fund is poised to win big from litigation against its socialist government tenor capital management
since the new york firm has invested million in canadian mining firm crystallex international corp largely to fund a lawsuit being waged against venezuela for expropriating a gold mine
now tenor stands to claim around million of a billion international arbitration award that crystallex has been trying to collect since
tenor s cash allowed crystallex to force venezuela to pay up by attempting a seizure of citgo petroleum corp the country s overseas crown jewel
the case is part of wave of lawsuits bankrolled by firms specializing in litigation finance providing funding to plaintiffs in return for a slice of any financial winnings
while the practice dates back centuries the business has boomed over the past decade fueled by favorable court rulings and investors seeking juicy returns not correlated to stock markets
between and the money committed to cases grew percent a year and is expected to top billion annually by according to litigation financing firm vannin capital
these companies have backed a slew of corporate lawsuits including investor litigation in volkswagen s emissions scandal and a million unjust enrichment case against billionaire ira rennert
but foreign governments are emerging as popular targets as well putting taxpayers at risk for claims
in addition to tenor firms working this niche include london stock burford capital imf bentham ltd of australia and therium group holdings ltd of the uk
litigation finance companies typically seek returns of three to times their initial investment industry players said
now a market is developing for these firms to begin cashing out before a suit concludes by selling portions of their portfolios or even slices of individual cases to other investors
burford for example scored a percent return by selling for million its entitlement in a case against argentina over two expropriated airlines
burford said it invested million in the litigation
critics fear this financing will embolden companies to bring weaker cases and that developing countries will be more likely to be sued for adopting regulations to protect public health or the environment
money from funders also discourages companies from sticking with commitments in foreign markets according to lise johnson the head of the columbia center on sustainable investment at columbia university in new york
with funding there is an incentive to sell a claim extract cash and leave she said
litigation finance companies say they are helping the underdogs small companies wronged by governments
it s an easy story to tell that these are rapacious hedge funds trying to bring a struggling country to its knees said zachary krug senior investment officer with funding firm woodsford litigation funding in london
that s not what we eric blinderman who heads the north american business of funding firm therium said funders guard against weak cases by providing a neutral opinion on the strength of claims
he said his firm backs less than percent of the cases brought to it and requires a percent chance of success
otherwise he said we d lose a lot of cases we funded and therium would be out of business the crystallex case started in when caracas expropriated the company s mining project at las cristinas one of the world s largest gold deposits located in southeastern venezuela
crystallex sought compensation through what is known as dispute settlement or isds by bringing an arbitration case registered with the world bank
effectively bankrupted by the loss of its venezuela project crystallex turned to tenor
tenor and crystallex declined to comment
court records show tenor eventually provided million to fund the litigation
in return crystallex agreed to give tenor at least percent of any payments it could collect from venezuela once crystallex paid off tenor s loan and other creditors the documents show
in the world bank s international centre for settlement of investment disputes or icsid entered an award that has grown to billion with interest
crystallex said in november it had already received million
just weeks later the company accused venezuela of breaching the agreement
it is not clear whether it will receive a full payout
venezuela s information ministry did not respond to a request for comment
companies increasingly are taking on foreign governments in the icsid and other tribunals including the international chamber of commerce and the united nations
in the there were typically around cases per year but since the number has jumped to an average of cases annually according to a united nations report
the un noted that figure could be even higher as some cases remain entirely confidential
funding arrangements generally are not disclosed
the world bank has proposed changing that in part to shed light on potential conflicts of interest between arbitrators and funders
for now it is unclear how many companies are funding such cases using litigation financing also known funding but industry executives and lawyers say the practice is common
in some respects every claimant in isds cases has considered the use of funding said krug of woodsford litigation funding
tenor for example is financing two other arbitration cases for canadian companies with allegedly expropriated mining projects a billion claim by gabriel resources ltd against romania and a million claim by eco oro minerals corp against colombia according to company records
the firm also invested in a case against uruguay over the demise of that nation s former flagship airline pluna
while payouts are potentially the risks are considerable industry veterans say
three of every cases is a complete loss said mick smith the of litigation financing firm calunius capital speaking at an industry conference in europe this year
even successful cases can tie up capital for years
a calunius client rusoro mining ltd of canada settled with venezuela in october on a billion arbitration award six years after calunius first extended the money according to a statement from rusoro
venezuela s final payment on the settlement is not due for five years rusoro said
meanwhile backlash against the arbitration system is growing
south africa india indonesia and several latin american nations have terminated investment treaties containing isds clauses with a number of countries
some clients too have been left disgruntled by financing terms that leave them with pennies on the dollar from big settlements
crystallex shareholders sought to reduce tenor s share of the venezuela arbitration settlement alleging in court documents that tenor violated canadian laws against excessive interest rates
a canadian judge rejected their argument this year
he said there would have been no payout at all if not for tenor s cash
