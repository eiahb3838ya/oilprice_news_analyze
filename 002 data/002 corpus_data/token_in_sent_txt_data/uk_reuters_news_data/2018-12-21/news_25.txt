norway to build wind farm despite concerns of reindeer herders
oslo reuters norway said on friday it would build a wind park in an area used for reindeer grazing despite calls to suspend the project to study the impact on the indigenous herders livelihoods
the petroleum and energy ministry said it would proceed with the megawatt mw storheia wind park which is part of europe s largest onshore wind power project being developed by the fosen vind consortium
the group owned by troenderenergi statkraft and the nordic wind power consortium is building six wind farms with combined capacity of mw at a cost of billion crowns billion
after careful consideration the ministry has concluded that there is no basis for stopping the building of the storheia wind turbines the ministry said in a statement
in a letter the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination asked norway to suspend the project so it could examine a complaint that the project would disturb reindeer herding a traditional activity of the sami people
reindeer herders have said the sight and sound of the turbines in the park to be built in an area on norway s northwest coast used as pastures during winter months could frighten the animals
the ministry said norway tried to address requests but would disregard it on this occasion after the wind farm had passed all domestic legal checks
most of the infrastructure was already completed so turbines could be installed between april and august the ministry said
storheia will have wind turbines of mw each constructed by vestas and is due to be commissioned in
the whole project will be completed in
statkraft owns percent of the consortium followed by the nordic power group with percent and troenderenergi with percent
