update 1-poland plans tax cuts and cost savings to stop surging electricity prices
adds details background warsaw dec reuters poland promised to give tax relief to energy consumers and asked its utilities to cut costs as part of measures designed to prevent surging electricity prices next year when the country holds a general election
the measures proposed by the government ruled by the conservative law and justice party pis will help keep power prices at the level seen in the first half of prime minister mateusz morawiecki said in a televised press conference
wholesale power prices in poland surged earlier this year mostly driven by rising coal prices and carbon emission costs as poland generates most of its electricity in polluting power plants
as a result of the eu climate policies and mistakes by our predecessors there are some mechanisms which are pushing power prices up
but we are launching mechanisms which will help keep prices stable morawiecki said
the draft law says that the excise tax paid by all electricity consumers in poland will be cut to zlotys per megawatt hour mwh from zlotys
morawiecki also called on power producers which include pge enea energa and tauron to cut costs
to cover the cost of the tax relief the government plans to sell extra emission allowances to the tune of around billion zlotys
the sum of all these assumptions will result in prices being stable at the level in the first half of morawiecki also said
while the head of the energy market regulator said earlier this year that higher energy prices would have to be reflected in household bills the energy minister has said prices will remain unchanged
the expected rise in power prices has prompted the central bank to increase its inflation forecasts
