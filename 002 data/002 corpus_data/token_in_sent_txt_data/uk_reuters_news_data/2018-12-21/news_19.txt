rpt-political stumbles, savvy activists knock canada's oil sector to its knees
repeats with no changes to headline or text canada nationalizes pipeline alberta intervenes to move crude environmental activism stymies pipeline projects crisis for world s fourth largest oil producer ottawa pursues tighter regulation for pipelines by rod nickel and julie gordon winnipeg dec reuters a decade ago canada s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower but a series of political missteps and formidable environmental activism has created a dysfunctional system requiring government intervention to move its oil to market
canada produces million barrels per day bpd more than any country other than the united states saudi arabia and russia but the world s fourth largest producer has had to nationalize a pipeline and the province of alberta is exploring buying trains to handle a glut of oil sitting in storage
canada s crisis coincides with big producers taking market share away from opec members mostly clustered in the middle east
global oil demand is expected to surpass million bpd in
the united states has driven exports to record highs on growing demand from china india and other developing countries
but ottawa has failed under two governments to effectively counter the strategy of environmental activists to attack the oil sector s heart by choking its arteries pipelines
roughly million barrels twice the normal amount of western canadian crude used to produce diesel gasoline and jet fuel is stuck in storage
the energy sector accounts for nearly percent of canada s gross domestic product
however canadian oil trades at a fraction of global prices costing the economy c million per day the alberta provincial government said
alberta took the unusual step this month of temporarily curtailing bpd starting in january in the aftermath of a retreat from the oil sands by global companies including conocophillips and statoil asa
it s become dire now because the writing is clearly on the wall
the issue is market access said jihad traya manager of energy advisory service hsb solomon
prime minister justin trudeau s government facing an election next year offered the oilpatch this week c billion in aid
in may ottawa agreed to buy the trans mountain pipeline in hopes of pushing through an expansion to nearly triple capacity as other proposed lines languished
in minister stephen harper boasted canada would soon become an energy canada was producing million bpd which moved smoothly to refineries through pipelines
since then production has nearly doubled but pipeline growth has stalled
both conservative harper and liberal trudeau squelched opportunities to complete pipelines just as opposition to more lines multiplied
two projects were killed and legal setbacks have stymied the development of transcanada corp s keystone xl and the trans mountain expansion
a year after taking office in trudeau proposed a bargain aimed at satisfying both environmentalists and the oil industry a national plan to reduce canada s emissions while approving pipeline expansions
the strategy has inflamed both sides
when a court overturned ottawa s approval of the expansion of trans mountain in august the deal was off and alberta premier rachel notley yanked support for trudeau s carbon plan just hours later
indigenous and environmental opposition to pipelines has forced trudeau to push for tighter regulations on future pipelines
the changes are necessary to depoliticize the system natural resources minister amarjeet sohi said
we need to fix the broken system that we have now so we are able to build the pipeline capacity that is so but trudeau has already shelved enbridge s northern gateway proposal which would have run through northern alberta to the pacific coast and the national energy board in toughened its review of transcanada s energy east pipeline while it was underway
both projects are now dead
alberta is seeking to buy rail cars to reduce the glut and earlier this month the province ordered producers to cut output after its oil fell to a discount of per barrel from oil in october
notley told reporters on tuesday that people in alberta can make profits from oil and gas but they need ottawa to take the handcuffs off
we need rail
we need support for getting that pipeline alberta s oil sands a mixture of sand water clay and thick heavy oil became a compelling target for environmentalists as production expanded dramatically in the early
the mining process scrapes away trees and vegetation across huge tracts of land leaving a path of destruction captured in aerial images while a different production method using steam consumes huge amounts of natural gas
clayton an indigenous activist said environmentalists grew frustrated trying to stop the industry s expansion through the alberta energy regulator but found a new strategy of opposing the pipelines
they built wider coalitions tapping into anger of nebraska ranchers and drawing the attention of hollywood celebrities such as director james cameron
opponents of transcanada s keystone xl began protests at the white house in seeking arrest and attention
president barack obama finally rejected the project in
full credit to advocates they kicked the snot out of corporate canada said tim powers a conservative political strategist
he said canadian resource companies have been too focused on the regulatory process while advocates laid out a better more compelling narrative to win public opinion
president donald trump resurrected keystone xl in
but both kxl and trans mountain remain in regulatory limbo after courts ruled in recent months that the and canadian governments failed to properly do their jobs
the cases that overturned approvals for northern gateway and trans mountain led companies to question investment in canada
the end result is a canadian oil patch in retreat
my main fear is that other nations will continue to produce at market price and canada will be left behind said duncan au chief executive of cwc energy services corp
the well drilling company has cut about employees or nearly percent since the beginning of
this is a crisis au said
