correction-mexico's pemex to pay more taxes despite pledge to boost company
corrects fourth paragraph to from last year by david alire garcia mexico city dec reuters mexico s new leftist president has pledged to revive the fortunes of state oil company pemex with a bigger budget next year while proposing the oil giant pay even more in taxes
the former monopoly oil producer officially known as petroleos mexicanos is due to contribute more revenue to the federal government than lawmakers are scheduled to grant the company for its spending
the pemex tax burden is punitive it s extremely high and it doesn t allow pemex to reinvest said john padilla a consultant with ipd latin america
president andres manuel lopez obrador who won office in july vowing to rescue pemex from years of decline has proposed increasing the firm s discretionary budget by percent from to some billion billion pesos
but the same budget proposal estimates total tax revenue from pemex at about billion billion pesos up about percent
the finance ministry did not reply to requests for comment
characterizing pemex as a piggy bank for successive governments padilla said it was more heavily taxed than peers including brazil s petrobras and colombia s ecopetrol
pemex s billion in financial debt the most of any national oil company in latin america could prove especially difficult to manage over the coming months if it were to lose its investment grade rating he said
the budget blueprint also anticipates collecting nearly billion billion pesos in additional gasoline taxes but it is unclear if any of that revenue might be given to pemex
the company which receives funds to pay back the money it borrows must pay back almost a third of its debt in the next three years
the spending plans must still be approved by congress but most analysts see that as a formality because lopez obrador s morena party and allies have a comfortable majority
lopez obrador firmly opposed a constitutional overhaul championed by his predecessor that ended pemex s monopoly
the finance ministry is not proposing changes to the law that sets its tax regime and the higher tax burden in is largely due to crude oil price assumptions
next year s budget assumes an average per barrel price for pemex s oil exports compared to per barrel in
lopez obrador also wants to end crude exports in three years so he can refine more at home
