croatia lng project in question as few bids emerge
zagreb dec reuters croatia has received few binding bids for the use of a floating liquefied natural gas lng terminal planned for construction in the northern adriatic the company running the project said on friday casting doubt over its viability
we received binding bids for terminal capacity amounting to billion cubic metres bcm of gas
we also have bids for an additional bcm lng croatia said in a statement
the deadline to submit binding bids has been extended twice this year a move lng croatia attributed to a request by potential bidders
on the basis of received bids we will now test the economic viability of the project
depending on the result a decision on a potential model for this terminal will be made lng croatia added
the terminal on the northern adriatic island of krk is being partially financed by the european union as part of eu efforts to diversify away from russian energy imports
the targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern europe
the value of the terminal is seen at million euros million with the eu providing just over million euros
the rest would be financed on commercial terms
last month croatia picked golar power ltd to provide a floating vessel as a storage and regasification unit for the terminal
the vessel would give an annual capacity of bcm of gas
a tentative start date for the terminal s operations was set for january
croatia annually consumes gas volumes roughly equal to the terminal s planned capacity
domestic production which has fallen in recent years accounts for slightly more than percent of the country s requirements
energy and environment minister tomislav coric recently said the government saw the krk terminal as a strategic project that it might consider
