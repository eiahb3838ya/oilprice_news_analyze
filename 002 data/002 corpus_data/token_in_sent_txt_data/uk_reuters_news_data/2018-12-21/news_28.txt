swiss ruling paves way to share documents in nigeria oil graft case
geneva dec reuters a geneva prosecutor is reviewing material in a suitcase seized nearly three years ago to decide what can be shared with italian authorities in a case involving oil majors eni and royal dutch shell and corrupt payments in nigeria his office said on friday
the prosecutor received the green light after switzerland s top court the federal tribunal rejected an appeal by nigerian defendant emeka obi to prevent his bag from being unsealed
the lausanne court s ruling published online said that the confiscated material including documents an external hard drive british and african passports and usb keys could have potential pertinence in the criminal investigation and the sealing could be lifted without violating swiss law
the geneva prosecutor now has access to all the material in conformity with the federal tribunal ruling it said in a reply to reuters
he will select the material to be handed over it said
under swiss law privileged information can not be shared in international judicial assistance in criminal matters and the prosecutor s choice of documents can be appealed
obi s geneva lawyers paul and charles goumaz told reuters that they were cooperating with the prosecutor s office
with respect to the ongoing proceedings in switzerland regarding the suitcase of our client we can confirm that no decision has yet been taken in respect of the transmission of any of its contents to the italian authorities they said in a statement
our client has maintained his innocence in regards to the various allegations made by the milan prosecutors and is confident that the final evaluation of the contents of his bag will confirm this
our position remains as it has always been from the beginning that the only material that should even be considered for transmission to the italians must be strictly limited to material that is directly related to our client s involvement in the opl transaction they added
an italian judge said on monday eni and shell were fully aware their purchase of a nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to nigerian politicians and officials
eni and shell bought the opl offshore field for about billion in a deal that spawned one of the industry s largest corruption scandals
it is alleged that about billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen
the milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the september conviction of obi and italian gianluca di nardo both middlemen in the opl deal for corruption
the pair were jailed for four years
obi and di nardo have been tried separately from eni and shell which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months
eni has denied any wrongdoing
shell said on monday that neither obi nor di nardo had worked for shell and that there was no basis to convict it or any of its former staff of alleged offences related to the deal
obi brought the swiss case to keep the contents of the bag seized in geneva in april from being shared with foreign authorities
its confiscation led the geneva prosecutor to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and
days later italian authorities requested judicial assistance arguing that the suitcase and its contents had been deliberately stashed in geneva the swiss ruling said
italy s proceedings targeted defendants and two companies suspected of corruption activities from and linked to acquiring prospecting rights in africa it said
