update 4-nigerian security agents blockade parliament, chief later fired
abuja reuters nigeria s security forces stopped lawmakers entering parliament on tuesday in a blockade seen by the opposition as a bid to intimidate its leaders but the presidency condemned the move and the acting president fired the head of the security agency
it is the first such incident since nigeria became a democracy in and coincides with increased tension between the national assembly and the executive ahead of an election in february when president muhammadu buhari will seek a second term
for some it revived memories of the decades when the military and security forces held sway over politics in a country that has one of africa s largest economies
armed men wearing the black uniform of the department of state security dss stood at the gates of the building in the capital abuja and were later joined by police officers blocking entry for up to an hour witnesses said
images of the incident were shared widely on social media
the motive for the blockade was not immediately clear
but a spokesman for vice president yemi osinbajo said in a statement that the dss director general lawal musa daura had been fired
osinbajo is acting president for buhari who last week left for a holiday in britain
the unlawful act which was done without the knowledge of the presidency is condemnable and completely unacceptable said a separate statement issued later by osinbajo s office
it described the move as an unauthorised takeover of the national assembly complex which was a gross violation of constitutional order rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order
the statement gave no reason for daura s dismissal
the presidency later said matthew seiyefa the most senior director in the dss will act as director general until further notice
the blockade followed the defection of around lawmakers from buhari s ruling all progressives congress apc party to the main opposition in the last few weeks
these included the country s third most senior elected official senate president bukola saraki
the defections cost the apc its senate majority and present a challenge to buhari s bid because most of those who left joined the opposition people s democratic party which ruled nigeria from until buhari took office in may
saraki s supporters said the blockade was part of a plan to impeach and replace him
parliament went on recess last week until but meetings were to be held on tuesday
we urge nigerians and the international community to condemn this illegal invasion of the national assembly complex and the attempt to asphyxiate the legislature as undemocratic uncivilized and irresponsible said saraki in a tweet
after the blockade saraki s supporters greeted him with chanting in the parliament building
the presidency s sack of daura was a stunt and a gimmick which came as a response to the national and international outcry against the armed invasion of our legislature said a pdp statement
the ruling party said attempts to blame its leaders for tuesday s blockade were false allegations and mischievous
the use of armed security agents to force political outcomes does not bode well for the february general election said malte liewerscheidt vice president at teneo intelligence in a note
