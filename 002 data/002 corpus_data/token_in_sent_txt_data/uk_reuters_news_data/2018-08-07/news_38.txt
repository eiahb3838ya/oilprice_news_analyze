update 1-germany considers tightening controls on buying strategic firms
berlin reuters germany is considering tighter controls on foreign investments as concerns over chinese takeovers of strategically important technology firms mount
berlin wants the power to investigate if an investor outside the european union buys at least percent of certain german or technology firms an economy ministry source said on tuesday
germany tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of takeovers by chinese companies making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of percent
and the german government last week signalled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of german companies in the case of a chinese bid for toolmaker leifeld
this came after leifeld s majority owner georg koffler said china s yantai taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the german government
the source did not name specific companies but said sensitive sectors included operators of critical infrastructure like cloud computing drinking water suppliers and sewage disposal systems systems of cash supply hospital information systems air traffic systems and local public transport
last month a german state bank bought a stake in grid operator to prevent china s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition
the economy ministry should now be able to investigate if a investor acquires a shareholding of at least percent of voting rights in the companies concerned the source said
german newspaper die welt first reported the proposal to change the german foreign trade ordinance said it was being coordinated with other ministries and added that a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year
until now we ve only been able to make checks when at least percent of a company s shares have been acquired
now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors die welt quoted german economy minister peter altmaier as saying
in germany and other countries including the united states france australia and britain there are concerns that china and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers
members of the european parliament are nearing agreement on a proposal that would broaden the powers of the european commission to scrutinize foreign investments amid rising concern about chinese acquisitions on the continent
joachim lang managing director of germany s bdi industry association sounded cautious about the plans saying foreign investment was important for germany and the investment climate needed to remain open
he said the government needed to proceed in a measured way in amending the german foreign trade ordinance but it was good that the government wanted to make conditions clear because investors needed legal certainty
lowering the investigation threshold must be limited to sensitive areas and must be strictly oriented towards protecting national security lang added
the head of germany s domestic intelligence service has said that chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from china with an increase in bids
