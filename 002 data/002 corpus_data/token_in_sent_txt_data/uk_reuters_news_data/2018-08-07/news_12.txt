former city police chief claims role in venezuela drone attack
aug reuters a former venezuelan municipal police chief and activist says he helped organize an operation to launch armed drones over a military rally on saturday that president nicolas maduro has called an assassination attempt
in an interview salvatore lucchese a venezuelan activist who was previously imprisoned for his role in past protests told reuters he orchestrated the attack with a loose association of militants known generally in venezuela as the the resistance referred to by lucchese is a diffuse collection of street activists student organizers and former military officers
it has little formal structure but is known in the country mostly for organizing protests in recent years in which demonstrators have clashed with police and soldiers
reuters could not independently verify lucchese s claims about the attack in which drones flew over the rally in central caracas
explosives aboard the drones detonated injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover
lucchese described the incident as part of a sustained armed effort against maduro
he declined to describe his precise role in the operation in the broader resistance or identify others involved citing the need to protect their identity
we had an objective and in the moment we were not able to materialize it percent lucchese said in an interview in bogota where he is traveling because of activities with other opposition figures
the armed struggle will venezuela s information ministry did not reply to a request for comment
earlier this year lucchese parted ways with popular will a prominent opposition party saying he disagreed with its continued dialogue with maduro s administration
the government is widely criticized for authoritarian tactics human rights abuses and economic policies that have led to recession and malnutrition across the formerly prosperous andean nation
juan guaido one of popular will s national leaders said lucchese was expelled for differences with the party and the national leadership but did not elaborate further
guaido also told reuters popular will rejects the use of violence a position echoed by other mainstream opposition parties in the wake of the attack
maduro who was chosen by late leftist president hugo chavez as the socialist party candidate to succeed him in often says venezuela s problems are the result of an economic war by enemies abroad including the united states
he blamed the drone attack on opposition figures and foreign enablers specifically citing the government of neighboring colombia
colombia s government has denied any involvement
venezuelan authorities over the weekend arrested six people including one suspect who had been detained for protests in and another wanted for involvement in a military base attack
the government said the drones carried plastic explosives detonated remotely
saturday s blasts which shook television footage from the rally and rattled nearby buildings differed from previous suggestions by maduro s government of pending attacks against it
maduro and top aides have spoken of foiled assassination and coup plots in the past but provided little evidence for them
now it remains unclear exactly how organized or equipped armed opponents may be
a group called the national movement of soldiers in over the weekend also claimed responsibility for the drone attack
it too describes itself as part of the lucchese declined to say whether he is associated with soldiers in
a member of the group who declined to be identified by name in an exchange with reuters via a messaging platform declined to comment on lucchese
the activist first drew attention after being jailed for ten months starting in for refusing to break up protests
as police chief of the municipality of san diego in central carabobo state he disobeyed interior ministry orders to clear demonstrators lucchese said
his account of the arrest and jail sentence is supported by a ruling on his conviction published by venezuela s supreme court at the time
the government released lucchese at the end of his sentence in february according to lucchese and local media reports
reuters could not find government documentation of his release
lucchese told reuters he left venezuela for an undisclosed location last august after learning the government sought his arrest once more this time for treason and inciting military rebellion
the warrant was widely reported by venezuelan media in recent months but reuters was unable to review a copy of it
lucchese said he now resides abroad and continues to work with other activists stressing that armed resistance is the only way to topple maduro
no dictator leaves power peacefully he told reuters
