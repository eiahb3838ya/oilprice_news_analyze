column-u.s. crude exports to india surge as china intake fades: russell
launceston australia reuters crude oil producers appear to have found an alternative buyer for cargoes no longer heading to china with india on track to import record volumes in august
india has booked a total of million barrels of crude about barrels per day bpd to arrive from the united states this month according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
this would be almost triple the bpd india imported from the united states in july and well above the bpd for november last year the previous record for a month
the august total is also likely to be just above the million barrels imported over the first seven months showing the scale of acceleration in india s imports of crude
indian refiners interest in crude will be welcome news to shale producers looking for buyers outside of china which is likely to scale back imports as the trade dispute between the administration of president donald trump and beijing escalates
although not imposed as yet china has proposed import taxes of up to percent on crude as well as on liquefied natural gas and coal
while crude exports to china appear to have held up in august with about bpd expected to arrive they seem set for a slump in september
so far about bpd of crude have been booked for arrival in china next month according to data and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the gulf of mexico to china s east coast
for crude exporters india is a market ripe for expansion given the voyage from the gulf of mexico to india s west coast takes about three weeks much the same as it does to china s east coast
this means shipping costs are more or less in line with sending cargoes to china
indian refiners may also be seeking alternative suppliers as they may be compelled to cut purchases from iran
iranian oil exports are under a cloud because of renewed sanctions as part of the trump administration s withdrawal from the international agreement aimed at curbing iran s nuclear programme
it must be especially galling for tehran s leaders that they stand to lose market share in india to the united states
however there is no sign yet that india is cutting back on imports from iran with a record bpd arriving in july according to preliminary tanker data
graphic india imports of crude catch those of china it s likely though that the percent surge in imports from june was a result of indian refiners buying as much as they could before they have to cut back as the renewed sanctions come into force
still indian refiners are believed to be encountering difficulties in insuring cargoes from iran and tehran is offering to insure vessels itself as well as providing generous payment and freight terms
whether this will allow iran to keep exporting to india remains to be seen but tehran will be especially keen to keep its relationship with its customer after china
the expected paring of india s imports from iran after this month and the increase in purchases from the united states also raise questions about the politics of oil
india is the world s crude importer and if it cuts its purchases from iran another likely major beneficiary besides the united states is tehran s regional rival and trump ally saudi arabia
india imported about bpd from saudi arabia in july according to the data a figure that is considerably higher than the average of bpd for the first six months of
while it s likely that saudi arabia is keen to limit iran s influence in the middle east it appears the kingdom could also be in for a benefit of increasing its exports to fill the gap left by iran and selling at higher prices assuming the market tightens on the loss of iranian barrels
