column-oil market enters post-opec era: kemp
london reuters saudi arabia and russia started to raise their oil production several weeks before the formal decision to increase output was taken by opec and its allies towards the end of june
saudi arabia increased its production to million barrels per day bpd in june from million in may and million bpd in april according to government data submitted to opec
chart russia s rosneft also started to raise output from late may anticipating a relaxation of the supply curbs according to an investor presentation released with the company s results on tuesday
the two largest suppliers within adjusted production first and then invited other members to ratify the decision that had already been taken when opec and producers met in vienna on june and
the sequence of events confirms the locus of and power has shifted decisively away from opec and to saudi arabia and russia
opec has been marginalised as a group the oil market has moved into a era where management is undertaken by riyadh and moscow with some political input from washington
the implication that the decision to increase production was taken and started to be implemented well before the meeting is consistent with movements in hedge fund positioning spot prices and spreads
hedge fund managers began to reduce their bullish position in brent and wti crudes and options weeks before the decision was formally taken and announced
net long positions in brent and wti were cut from a peak of billion barrels in to million barrels by the end of the first week in june and have changed relatively little since then
brent futures peaked around per barrel on may and slid through most of june ahead of the opec meeting
brent calendar spreads have also been sliding since late april as traders anticipated greater availability of crude in the second half of the year
the fact that the decision to raise output and probably by how much had already been taken helps explain much of what transpired in vienna
iran s oil minister who initially appeared to oppose any rise in output eventually consented to a statement that signalled an increase but without numbers or country allocations
because the output increase had already been agreed between saudi arabia and russia and was in fact underway iran had little choice
the same is true for a number of other opec members that opposed an output increase
the iranian minister could have refused to agree to the statement in which the output increase would have continued anyway or agreed to a consensus statement that omitted contentious allocations
unsurprisingly the minister opted for the latter since it provided a modicum of but it shows the extent to which other members of opec now have minimal bargaining power
russia and especially saudi arabia have strong reasons to want to keep opec and formally involved in
opec provides a convenient political shield against criticism from consumer countries especially the united states
president donald trump s twitter messages have blamed rising oil prices on opec rather than saudi arabia opec s de facto leader specifically
saudi arabia will probably want to ensure that output decisions remain attributed to opec or rather than assume sole responsibility or joint accountability with russia which is not a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
opec allows saudi arabia to deflect criticism of its production decisions and helps separate oil policy from other aspects of the bilateral relationship such as security and policy towards iran
but the fact that decisions are taken in the name of opec should not obscure the fact real has moved elsewhere
the real negotiations now take place between riyadh and moscow behind closed doors and far away from opec headquarters in vienna reflecting their market calculations and relationships with the united states
