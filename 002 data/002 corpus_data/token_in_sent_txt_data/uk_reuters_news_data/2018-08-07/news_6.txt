update 2-maersk cuts 2018 profit forecast, but eyes market recovery
copenhagen reuters
cut its earnings forecast on tuesday due to higher fuel prices although the downgrade was smaller than some analysts had feared prompting shares in the world s biggest container shipping company to rise
the container shipping industry has suffered from low freight rates amid a global oversupply of vessels while maersk and rivals have warned a global trade war could hit business
we continue to encounter very high bunker fuel prices which we have not been able to get fully compensated for in freight rates leading to an adjustment in our expectations for the said chief executive soren skou
however the danish company added spot freight rates had recovered after a significant drop in the second quarter and its volumes were growing in line with the market
maersk is more reliant than ever on the shipping industry after selling its oil and gas business last year and plans to step up competition to delivery companies ups and fedex by expanding in transport and logistics
the company now expects earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda of between billion and billion this year down from the billion seen previously
rising fuel prices are really hurting profits in an industry under pressure sydbank analyst morten imsgard said
following the unexpected announcement maersk s shares initially fell more than percent but then jumped to close percent higher at danish crowns
a thomson reuters smartestimate forecast showed analysts had already slashed their earnings expectations for maersk to an average of billion ahead of the warning
some people just sell immediately when they see a profit warning issued
but the market may have feared an even more dramatic profit warning imsgard said
maersk said it still expected to make an underlying profit this year
its previous guidance was for an underlying profit above the million achieved last year
the company due to publish full quarterly earnings on said ebitda stood at million in the second quarter on revenue of billion
average bunker fuel prices were percent higher in the period compared with a year earlier while freight rates were percent lower it said
