update 1-cez says plunge in second quarter profit marks bottom of cycle
adds cfo comments on outlook prices prague aug reuters czech power producer cez partly blamed exceptional gains a year ago for a collapse in its net profit on tuesday and said its business should now start to pick up as prices are on the rise
cez like many european utilities has seen profit squeezed in recent years by depressed whole electricity prices
the majority company maintained its profit outlook after reporting a percent slump in adjusted net profit and its chief financial officer said results should be the bottom of the cycle
much of the earnings drop was due to gains booked in the same period a year ago from the sale of shares held in hungarian oil and gas group mol and real estate in the czech republic it said
for the full year cez has forecast that adjusted net income would fall by up to percent to between billion crowns million and billion crowns
we are comfortable with this range so far and we think we should get there chief financial officer martin novak told reporters
cez also forecast ebitda to fall slightly in to billion to billion crowns down from billion crowns posted in
in the second quarter adjusted net income which strips out extraordinary items fell to billion crowns million well below an average estimate of billion crowns in a reuters poll of analysts
quarterly revenue slipped to billion crowns versus the average estimate of billion crowns in the poll
hedging of contracts for delivery in the second half meant that rising spot power prices dented earnings before interest depreciation and amortisation ebitda by billion crowns
however same amount will be compensated for in the second half when deliveries will be made at higher prices than the hedges novak said
the company s strategy of expected output means that rising market prices on the back of increasing allowance prices will not be seen in earnings until later
cez said it had percent of its output at an average price of euros per megawatt hour up from a previous average price of euros last quarter when it had sold already percent
cez contracts percent of power at an average price of euro per mwh
we can clearly see that the trend is turning our prices for the coming years are beginning to rise novak said
we think that this year should be the bottom of our czech crowns reporting by jason hovet and robert muller editing by kirsten donovan and susan fenton
