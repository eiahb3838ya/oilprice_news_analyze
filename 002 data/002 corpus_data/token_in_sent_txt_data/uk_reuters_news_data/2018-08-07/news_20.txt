wrapup 5-trump says firms doing business in iran to be barred from us as sanctions hit
reuters companies doing business with iran will be barred from the united states president donald trump said on tuesday as new sanctions took effect despite pleas from washington s allies
iran dismissed a offer from the trump administration for talks saying it could not negotiate while washington had reneged on a deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on iran s nuclear programme
trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had the deal including washington s main european allies britain france and germany as well as russia and china
european countries hoping to persuade tehran to continue to respect the deal have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out
but that has proven difficult european companies have quit iran arguing that they can not risk their business
these are the most biting sanctions ever imposed and in november they ratchet up to yet another level
anyone doing business with iran will not be doing business with the united states
i am asking for world peace nothing less trump tweeted on tuesday
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif criticized trump s tweet as a tired cliche and denounced us and it is not the first time that a warmonger claims he is waging war for world peace zarif tweeted
white house national security adviser john bolton said on monday iran s only chance of escaping sanctions would be to take up an offer to negotiate with trump for a tougher deal
if the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze they should come and sit down
the pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on bolton one of the administration s main hawks on iran told fox news
on tuesday bolton said the sanctions were already working deterring european companies the european governments are still holding to the nuclear deal but honestly their businesses are running from it as fast as they can so that the effect of the american sanctions really is proceeding few american companies do much business in iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from washington s ability to block european and asian firms from trading there
among large european companies that have suspended plans to invest in iran are france s oil major total and its big carmakers psa and renault
we have ceased our already restricted activities in iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions said german car and truck manufacturer daimler
washington accepts that iran has complied with the terms of the deal reached under trump s predecessor barack obama but says the agreement is flawed because it is not strict enough
iran says it will continue to abide by the deal for now if other countries can help protect it from the economic impact of washington s decision to pull out
tuesday s sanctions target iran s purchases of dollars metals trading coal industrial software and its auto sector
global oil prices rose on tuesday on concern sanctions could cut world supply although the toughest measures targeting iran s oil exports do not take effect for four more months
global benchmark brent crude oil futures were up or percent to per barrel at gmt
it is a reality check that this is happening and that iran s oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in november chief commodities analyst at commerzbank bjarne schieldrop said
in a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect iran s president hassan rouhani rejected negotiations as long as washington was no longer complying with the deal
if you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television
we are always in favour of diplomacy and talks
but talks need honesty rouhani said
iranian intelligence minister mahmoud alavi said trump s withdrawal from the deal meant there was no point negotiating since washington had shown it did not abide by its commitments
and iran based on past experience has no trust in negotiating with the american the nuclear deal is closely associated in iran with rouhani a relative moderate who won two landslide elections on promises to open up the economy to the outside world
european countries fear that by abandoning it washington could undermine rouhani and strengthen the hand of his hardline opponents
britain france germany and the eu as a bloc said in a joint statement on monday we deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the since the sanctions were initially lifted two years ago iranian oil exports have risen
but many iranians have yet to see major economic improvement and the prospect that washington would reimpose sanctions has helped drive a collapse in the value of iran s currency this year raising the cost of imports
iran s security forces have responded firmly to protests against rising prices
iran this week made it easier to access foreign currency and said it was prosecuting an bank official for economic crimes
sanctions will definitely make daily life harder for iranians said saeed leylaz a economist and political analyst
but if the government has a serious plan they can control the iraq said it did not agree with the sanctions on its neighbour but will abide by them to protect its own interests
as a matter of principle we are against sanctions in the region
blockade and sanctions destroy societies and do not weaken regimes prime minister haider said on tuesday
