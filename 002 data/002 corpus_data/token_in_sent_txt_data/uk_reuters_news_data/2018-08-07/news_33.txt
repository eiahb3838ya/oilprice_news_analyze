china may have to resume u.s. soybean purchases in weeks -oil world
hamburg aug reuters china may have to start buying soybeans again in coming weeks despite the trade war between the two countries as other regions can not supply enough soybeans to meet china s needs oilseeds analysts oil world said on tuesday
in july china imposed import tariffs on a list of goods including soybeans as part of the trade dispute with the united states
china is the world s largest soybean importer and has been seeking alternative supplies especially in south america where supplies available for export are down
china has to resume purchases of soybeans oil world said in its latest newsletter
the south american supply shortage will make it necessary for china in our opinion to import million tonnes of soybeans in october even if the current trade war is not chinese purchases of soybeans could in coming weeks oil world added
soybeans crushed to make cooking oil and the animal feed ingredient soymeal were the biggest agriculture export to china last year at a value of billion according to the department of agriculture
oil world said with south american export supplies expected to be down sizeably from a year earlier in the next six months china will face very tight domestic soybean supplies unless it resumes purchases of soybeans
there is a risk that china will have to cut back its livestock production implying higher prices on the domestic market it said
china is also likely to raise imports of processed soymeal as an alternative to soybeans for crushing it said
ironically this could mean china could still end up with soybeans that have been processed in argentina
the biggest increase is likely to be seen in soymeal exports from argentina to china it said
if china begins purchasing argentine soymeal a lack of soybean supplies in argentina is likely to raise argentine imports of reporting by michael hogan editing by jane merriman
