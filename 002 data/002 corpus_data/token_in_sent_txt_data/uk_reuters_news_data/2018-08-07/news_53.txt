explainer-indonesia bets big on biodiesel to limit costs of oil imports
jakarta reuters indonesia plans to require all diesel fuel used in the country contain biodiesel starting next month to boost palm oil consumption slash fuel imports and narrow a yawning current account gap
while the proposal has been welcomed by the palm oil industry and government it has raised concerns among the automobile industry the fuel could impact engine performance
environmentalists fear the boost to local palm oil consumption will hasten indonesia s already fast spreading deforestation
the following explains some of the issues surrounding the drive to increase biodiesel usage
graphic indonesian oil imports indonesia currently imports around barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products which makes southeast asia s largest economy vulnerable to the sort of increases in global crude prices seen over the past year
with the current account deficit estimated to grow by billion in the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers including power plants and railways use biodiesel that contains percent typically palm oil
officials estimate this will save indonesia around billion per year

in indonesia the bio component in biodiesel consists of fatty acid methyl esters fame made from palm oil
indonesia has fame producers including units of palm oil giants like sinar mas group wilmar and musim mas according to the indonesian biofuels producers association aprobi
fame is supplied to fuel distributors including pertamina blended with diesel and sold to
graphic indonesia energy sector in decline currently only around of indonesia s fame production capacity is utilised and the new programme could raise this to up to percent said togar sitanggang a senior official at the indonesia palm oil association gapki
the government has said it will provide incentives to biodiesel producers but has not provided details
efforts to increase fame concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from regulators and the automotive and oil industries in the past
indonesia is supporting a programme to make palm biodiesel without fame
rules introduced in make mandatory in subsidised biodiesel up to january after which is scheduled to become mandatory
while use is generally accepted for new vehicles higher fame blends may pose problems
fame has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gaskets potentially increasing maintenance costs and requiring special handling and equipment
biodiesel blends can also impact engine warranties gel in cold temperatures and may present unique storage issues the department of energy s alternative fuels data center afdc said on its website

fame use could also increase nitrogen oxide emissions although it greatly reduces other toxic emissions it said
in a assessment the japan automobile manufacturers association jama concluded that biodiesel with no more than percent fame content was acceptable for vehicles that comply with the euro iv emissions standard among other conditions
in a study by indonesia s technology assessment and application agency bppt six passenger vehicles from three manufacturers were driven over km miles using biodiesel and regular diesel
the test found that improved vehicle performance and acceleration and reduced emissions but the vehicles consumed roughly percent more fuel than vehicles using regular diesel
tatang soerawidjaja chairman of the indonesian association of bioenergy scientists and technologists said extensive tests have shown that poses no problems for diesel engines even in older models
filters would only need replacement or more frequent cleaning in the early phase of adopting biodiesel use he said referring to fame s solvent effect when mixed with regular diesel
the bio content cleans dirt off of the tank s walls and pipes and this ends up in the filter he said
