israel to shift west bank power supply to palestinian authority in $775m deal
jerusalem reuters israel signed a million million pounds deal with the palestinian authority on tuesday to put electricity distribution for palestinians in the west bank in pa hands and build four power plants to that end officials said
the nearly three million palestinians in the territory currently rely on israel for their electricity with neighbouring jordan providing power to the jericho area in the jordan river valley
the deal does not apply to the gaza strip whose two million palestinians suffer frequent blackouts due to severe fuel shortages and continued disputes between gaza s islamist hamas rulers and the west as part of the new deal the pa will pay off a debt to the utility israel electric corp iec while taking charge of the distribution of electricity to west bank palestinians
the iec will sell power to the palestinian electricity transmission company petl through four plants to be built by the iec and petl will own the power plants and channel the electricity supply
the agreement frees the palestinian electricity sector of complete israeli control which has lasted for decades said a statement issued in the name of hussein head of the pa s civil affairs agency
israeli energy minister yuval steinitz said the agreement paves the way for palestinians to develop a modern grid
the deal brings about a new reality in the palestinians energy sector reduces restrictions on electricity supply strengthens economic stability and opens a new era in economic relations between the two sides said israeli finance ministry shai babad
palestinians in gaza an impoverished coastal enclave largely blockaded by israel suffer up to hours of power cuts per day due to fuel shortages
the electricity gaza gets from israel egypt and a local power plant remains under half the estimated megawatts that would satisfy daily needs
talks on a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza have been frozen since and israel and the pa have sparred repeatedly over unpaid pa debts to the iec
the deal includes collateral and a guarantee mechanism to ensure the iec is paid
