update 3-iran says it can produce higher enriched uranium if u.s. exits nuclear deal
ankara reuters iran has the technical capability to enrich uranium to a higher level than it could before a multinational nuclear deal was reached to curb its nuclear programme state tv quoted the head of iran s atomic energy organisation ali akbar salehi as saying
president donald trump has given european signatories to the deal a may deadline to fix the terrible flaws in the agreement or he will refuse to extend sanctions relief on iran
salehi warned trump against taking that course
iran is not bluffing
technically we are fully prepared to enrich uranium higher than we used to produce before the deal was reached

i hope trump comes to his senses and stays in the under the deal which led to the lifting of most international sanctions in iran s level of enrichment must remain around percent
iran stopped producing percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile as part of the agreement with the united states britain france germany china and russia
uranium refined to percent fissile purity is well beyond the percent normally required to fuel civilian nuclear power plants although still well short of highly enriched or to percent purity needed for a nuclear bomb
tehran has ruled out any possibility of negotiating over the country s ballistic missile programme its nuclear activities beyond and its international role in the middle east as demanded by trump
britain france and germany back the deal as the best way of stopping tehran getting nuclear weapons but have called on iran to limit its regional influence and curb the missile programme
a british government spokesman defended the accord saying in a statement we have never been naive about iran and its nuclear that is why the iaea inspection regime agreed as part of the iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords the spokesman added
it remains a vitally important way of independently verifying that iran is adhering to the deal and that iran s nuclear programme is exclusively writing by parisa hafezi additional reporting by alistair smout in london editing by david stamp and peter cooney
