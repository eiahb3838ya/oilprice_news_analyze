bulgaria may buy up to 10 warplanes as process goes back to scratch
sofia reuters bulgaria could eventually be in the market for up to new or used fighter jets to replace its ageing defence minister krasimir karakachanov said on tuesday
nato has encouraged its eastern members such as bulgaria which joined in to develop buy and operate new alliance weaponry compatible with older systems
but the question of which warplanes to buy has been vexing successive governments in bulgaria for more than a decade and karakachanov said it could opt for more than the eight aircraft laid down in a plan approved by parliament in but never implemented
we have made a change karakachanov said
we have written a minimum of eight in the new project
there are options when negotiating for the number to be or karakachanov who is also deputy prime minister did not say which aircraft the government should consider
i will not go into the details of the conversations that we have held in advance or what kind of proposals we have received he said
some eastern european nato allies that were once soviet satellites still rely on russian warplanes of poland s military equipment dates from the soviet era for example
under the plan bulgaria was supposed to acquire the eight jets between and in a billion lev million deal to improve its compliance with nato standards
the process however hit procedural snags and is expected to start almost from scratch at a government meeting next week
in june last year sofia said it would start talks to buy new gripen warplanes from swedish manufacturer saab but the purchase was put on hold after lawmakers questioned if all bidders for the contract had been treated equally
three months later prime minister boyko borissov also expressed doubt that the gripen was the best choice although he had initially told his swedish counterpart that negotiations on buying them would proceed within weeks
bulgaria also received offers from portugal for secondhand and from italy for secondhand eurofighter typhoons
