update 1-australia corporate watchdog expands legal action against rio tinto, former executives
sydney reuters australia s corporate watchdog said on tuesday it has expanded legal action against miner rio tinto and two former top executives alleging a failure to recognize an impairment in its mozambique coal assets in financial statements
the new allegations against former chief executive tom albanese and former chief financial officer guy elliott come on top of claims the executives misled investors about the coal reserves in the annual report
the charges are wholly unwarranted and rio tinto intends to vigorously defend itself and is confident that asic s allegations will be rejected once all the facts are considered in court a rio tinto spokesman said
the global miner has denied any wrongdoing in a similar case brought by the securities and exchange commission
rio tinto bought riversdale mining later renamed rio tinto coal mozambique for billion in but later wrote off about billion of its value
