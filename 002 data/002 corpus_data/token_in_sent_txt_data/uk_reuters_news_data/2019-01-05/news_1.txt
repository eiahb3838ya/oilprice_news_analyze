update 2-iran says despite u.s. sanctions, it has found new "potential" oil buyers
london reuters all countries that were granted waivers from the united states to continue buying a certain amount of iranian oil imports are complying with sanctions a senior iranian energy official said noting that tehran was hopeful to find new buyers
the united states withdrew from a nuclear deal with iran last year and snapped sanctions in place to choke iran s oil and banking industries while temporarily allowing eight customers to keep buying crude from the islamic republic
china india japan south korea and other countries that were granted waivers from america to import iranian oil are not willing to buy even one barrel more from iran amir hossein zamaninia iran s deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs was quoted as saying by the oil ministry s news agency shana
however without giving details zamaninia said despite pressures on iranian oil market the number of potential buyers of iranian oil has significantly increased due to a competitive market greed and pursuit of more the exemptions were also granted to italy greece taiwan and turkey
washington seeks to bring iranian oil exports to zero in order to curb tehran s missile and nuclear programs and counter its growing military and political influence in the middle east
iran has urged european countries which are still committed to the nuclear deal to oppose the sanctions by creating a financial mechanism that facilitates payments of iranian oil sales
zamaninia said the mechanism known as spv special purpose vehicle for trade would be helpful but could not resolve the problems since influence will affect any european action
