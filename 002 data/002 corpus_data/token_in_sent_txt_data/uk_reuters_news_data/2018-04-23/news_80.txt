rpt-interview-panama canal to carry 30 mln t of lng by 2020 as global demand grows
repeats item with no changes to text canal lng volumes to hit mln t this year mln t in rise from s mln t driven by expansion asia demand authority already starting to look at adding set of locks by osamu tsukimori tokyo april reuters the panama canal may carry five times as much liquefied natural gas lng in as it did last year as production of the fuel expands in the united states and asian import demand rises the head of the canal s governing agency told reuters
lng volumes traversing the canal could hit million tonnes a year before the end of said jorge quijano who leads the panama canal authority up from million tonnes last year
demand for lng has risen significantly in the last three years as the increase of supply especially from onshore shale fields in the united states and offshore reserves in australia has made it more competitive
many countries including china have also been switching to gas more rapidly than expected away from dirtier coal for environmental reasons
the united states has only one lng export facility at sabine pass in louisiana which exports via the panama canal mostly to north asia and the pacific coast of latin america
but shipments are expected to surge over the next few years as several lng projects are under construction with total capacity slated to reach nearly million tonnes a year up from million tonnes in
right now on average we re running six lng vessels per week but in the very near future you will have several plants exporting and that starts to add up quijano said in an interview with reuters on thursday
lng exports through the canal are set to rise to as much as million tonnes this year and to around million tonnes in he said
reflecting a quickening in traffic three gas tankers transited the canal in a single day for the first time on april
and since june there have been days in which two lng ships passed through the canal in a period
shipments of lng through the panama canal began to rise after a third set of locks was added in quijano said and the authority projects growing demand for the supercooled fuel will boost such transits through the early part of the
the canal is already looking beyond the next few years to adding a fourth set of locks which would serve a new generation of even bigger ships quijano said
