transneft says rejected summa's proposal to complete port deal
moscow reuters russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft has rejected a proposal from its rival summa group to complete a deal to buy a novorossiysk commercial sea port ncsp a transneft spokesman said on monday
if the deal goes ahead it will allow transneft to take control of russia s largest port operator
but transneft said earlier this month it had suspended talks on the deal after the authorities arrested the of summa ziyavudin magomedov on charges of embezzling more than million
magomedov denied the charges at a hearing where a judge ordered that he be held in custody until may
we believe it is inappropriate to complete the deal taking into account the circumstances in which summa has found itself transneft spokesman igor dyomin told reuters
transneft s move to acquire control in ncsp by purchasing a stake from summa was initially approved by russia s regulator
the potential value of the deal has not been disclosed
last week a summa representative has offered to complete the deal on ncsp dyomin told reuters
dyomin also said that summa had told transneft that russia s largest oil producer rosneft had expressed an interest in summa s ncsp stake
rosneft denied this on monday
we have not and are not going to hold talks with individuals who are under investigation rosneft said in a statement
summa declined to comment ncsp controls russia s novorossiysk port on the black sea and the port at primorsk on the baltic
both are major terminals for exports of oil and oil products to world markets
summa and transneft jointly control novoport holding company which owns percent of ncsp
transneft also has percent in ncsp while the russian state property fund controls percent
