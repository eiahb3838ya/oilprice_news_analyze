column-china coal imports tumble on new rules, india yet to take up the slack: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia april reuters china s decision to impose fresh restrictions on imports of coal at some ports appears to have caused a sharp fall in inbound shipments of the polluting fuel
the measures announced on april included banning the unloading of imported coal at some ports and tightening customs clearances
while it s still too early to discern a definitive trend china s seaborne coal imports slumped to million tonnes in the week ended april according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
this was down almost percent on the million tonne weekly average that was recorded from to april
it s also lower than the weekly average of million tonnes for seaborne imports in
it is possible that there are other factors at play in the slump in seaborne imports last week including lower demand in the usually softer period between the northern winter and summer peaks
but a decline of the magnitude seen last week suggests that the import restrictions had an immediate and profound impact
it s believed the authorities in beijing took the steps to crimp some imports as part of efforts to boost domestic thermal coal prices and production
certainly domestic thermal coal prices have benefited with futures on the zhengzhou commodity exchange jumping percent last week to finish at yuan a tonne on april a high
prices for seaborne thermal coal were more subdued with argus media s assessment of the kilocalorie per kilogram grade at australia s newcastle port dropping fractionally over the week to end at a tonne on april
this grade of coal is generally preferred by chinese buyers because of its discount to the coal which is more usually sought by utilities in japan and south korea
since peaking this year at a tonne in early february cargoes of the grade have dropped percent while those for the are down by a more modest percent from the peak in late february
it would be logical to expect the discount of supplies to widen further if china does continue to restrict imports of coal in coming months
falling prices would help open up india to australia s thermal coal supplies although there is little sign yet that this is happening
the bulk of coal supplied to india from australia is coking coal used to make steel
australian thermal coal cargoes generally struggle to find buyers in india given the higher price and transport costs when competing against supplies from the region s other major exporters indonesia and south africa
but the recent price decline for australian cargoes may make them competitive against similar grade coal from south africa
argus assessed coal at south africa s richards bay port at a tonne well above the for coal at australia s newcastle port
some of the difference will be eaten up by the longer sea journey from australia s east coast to india but the likelihood is that indian buyers may well be open to picking up any australian cargoes that become distressed because of the recent chinese restrictions
however coal prices may still be too high to attract significant indian interest given the south asian nation generally is highly price sensitive and cuts back on imports when prices are strong as they have been in recent months
and port data show that india imported million tonnes of all grades of coal in the first quarter a monthly rate of million tonnes
this is below the monthly rate of million tonnes for showing that while imported coal may well be needed in india it s probably still too expensive to be attractive
