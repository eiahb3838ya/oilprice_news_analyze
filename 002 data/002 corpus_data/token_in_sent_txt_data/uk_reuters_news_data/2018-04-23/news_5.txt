update 1-libya to cover 2018 grain needs with imports, eyes higher harvest
clarifies role of food agency fao by ulf laessing tripoli april reuters libya will have to cover its grain consumption needs of around million tonnes almost entirely by imports but hopes to boost production from the next harvest a senior official said
abdelmoneim mohamed shihab the top official in the agricultural ministry in a government in tripoli said the oil producing nation could meet at least half of its cereal needs in future if security and power supply improved
to ramp up output libya will invest million into its farming sector of which more than million will go on seeds he said
the funds come after an emergency project with the s food and agriculture organization fao which raised the awareness of the government to the importance of food security fao officials said
this year it will be the same with imports meeting consumption but if the security improves a bit then output will improve the next season said in an interview
electricity supply has improved
we can reach percent of million tonnes of grain consumption he said when asked where output could be in the next two years
according to the ministry farmers will be supplied with the seeds
he said last year s crop output was around tonnes though no exact figures exist due to the dysfunctional libyan state in turmoil since the toppling of muammar gaddafi in
farmers have been struggling to get seeds as a fall in oil revenues since has hit the supply of foreign exchange needed to fund imports
improving output would not just lower the import bill of a country suffering from economic meltdown but also provide an income in poor rural areas often cut off from state support due to poor security and african migrants working as farmhands
but much will depend on whether security improves
the focus of the plan is on the main farming regions deep in the south in ubari and sebha which were hit by tribal fighting and lack of power supply as well as benghazi in the east
libya a country of six million was once home to farming schemes built by italian colonial rulers but has neglected the sector since oil exports started in the
still the country produced up to tonnes of cereal until officials said
since then crop output has been hovering around tonnes
an fao study showed seeds and modern equipment had become unavailable in many parts of libya
development has also been hampered by a split between two governments the tripoli one and an eastern rival though said his ministry was cooperating on a technical level with the east allowing it to ship seeds to benghazi
libya also produces some tonnes of dates some of which still get exported despite the chaos alongside cooking oil and strawberries grown in the more stable north of the country officials said
it s a difficult situation but we are more optimistic now said
but we need more foreign editing by mark potter
