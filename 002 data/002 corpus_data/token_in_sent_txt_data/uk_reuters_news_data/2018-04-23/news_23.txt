california risks severe "whiplash" from drought to flood - scientists
oslo reuters california will suffer more volatile weather this century with a whiplash from drought to rain and mounting risks a repeat of the devastating great flood of scientists said on monday
climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions would drive more extreme shifts between hot and dry summers and wet winters in the most populous state they wrote in the journal nature climate change
global warming is making california and other regions with similar climates from southern europe to parts of australia drier and warmer in summer said lead author daniel swain of the university of california los angeles
in california in winter an opposing trend toward a strong pacific jet stream is projected to locally enhance precipitation during the core months of the rainy season he told reuters
natural precipitation variability in this region is already large and projected future whiplash increases would amplify existing swings between dry and wet years the authors wrote
they projected a percent to percent increase in extreme precipitation events this century
california had its worst drought in recorded history from followed by severe rains and flooding that culminated with evacuation orders for almost residents as a precaution near the oroville dam last year
the study said that major urban centers including san francisco and los angeles were more likely than not to suffer a freak series of storms by similar to ones in that led to the great flood
the storms swamped the sacramento and san joaquin valleys flooding an area miles km long and miles wide
storms washed away bridges inundated mines and wrecked farms
a repeat would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars the study said
as part of planning swain said the state should expand use of floodplains that can be deliberately flooded to soak up rains such as the yolo bypass which protects the city of sacramento
the study assumes however that global greenhouse gas emissions will keep rising at odds with the goals of the paris agreement under which almost nations agreed to cut emissions to net zero between and
such a future can be partially but not completely avoided if the world takes tougher action swain said
he noted that existing government pledges to limit warming fall well short of the paris goals
president donald trump who doubts mainstream findings that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of warming plans to quit the deal saying he wants to promote the fossil fuel industry
