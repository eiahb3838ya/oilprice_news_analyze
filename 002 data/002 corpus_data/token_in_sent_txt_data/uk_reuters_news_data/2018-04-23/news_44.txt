australia has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to to percent below levels by
but a united nations environment programme report late last year included australia in a list of nations and regions that need to take further action to meet their paris goals
yes we have work to do environment and energy minister josh frydenberg told the thomson reuters foundation
i m confident of not just meeting it but of beating it he said on the sidelines of the rainforest summit in yogyakarta on the indonesian island of java
based on its current energy mix and growth projections australia s emissions in are estimated to be about percent higher than its target of million tonnes under the paris climate accord government research showed last year
that could change if the government is able to push through its national energy guarantee a power plan that would also include emissions cuts
political disagreements have held back climate policy in australia for many years but broad support emerged last week for the national power plan
we ve come a long way he said
where we have been very effective is in seeking emissions reduction in different aspects of the frydenberg cited contracts issued under the country s emission reduction fund which sees big emitters paid to cut carbon levels
he also mentioned work already underway in the transport sector to reduce vehicle emissions and a national energy productivity plan to boost efficiency by percent by
when it comes to the electricity sector in the last two quarters emissions have come down as renewables have gone up he said
frydenberg told summit delegates that australia would help fund the development by the coral triangle center a foundation of a learning module on protecting coastal ecosystems
such ecosystems which include sea grasses mangrove forests and salt marshes capture carbon emmissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere
