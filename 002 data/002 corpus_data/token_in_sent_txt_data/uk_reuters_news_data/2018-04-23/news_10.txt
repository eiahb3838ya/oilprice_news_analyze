asked about the crisis on monday before sarksyan s resignation the kremlin called armenia an extraordinarily important country for russia but dismissed the idea it might intervene calling the crisis a domestic matter
last week putin rang sarksyan to congratulate him on becoming premier
as president sarksyan took armenia a country of about three million people into a economic bloc and bought weapons from moscow
the protesters complaints were mainly domestic and focussed on pervasive corruption and poverty in a country that won independence from moscow in but has been hampered by its conflict with azerbaijan over the breakaway region of and other issues
but critics have also accused sarkasyan of moving landlocked armenia too close to russia at the expense of better ties with the west and increased prosperity and it was unclear whether his political demise could lead to a change in foreign policy
