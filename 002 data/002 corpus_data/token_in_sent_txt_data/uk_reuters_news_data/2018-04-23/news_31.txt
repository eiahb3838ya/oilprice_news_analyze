column-hedge fund oil bulls on the rampage as bears vanish: kemp
london reuters hedge fund managers have never seemed so convinced that oil prices are set to rise rather than fall in the near term according to the latest positioning data published by regulators and exchanges
fund managers remain even though benchmark brent prices have almost tripled over the last two years and are now trading at the highest level since november
hedge funds and other money managers raised their net bullish position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to the price of crude and fuels by million barrels in the week to april
the net bullish position was equivalent to billion barrels of crude and fuels enough to satisfy global oil consumption for more than two weeks
the net long position was still below the record billion barrels set back on
for a chartbook click here but hedge fund managers have never been so overwhelmingly convinced prices are set to rise further rather than fall back
across the six major contracts portfolio managers hold almost long positions for every short one compared with a ratio of less than back on
in total funds hold billion barrels of long positions across brent nymex and ice wti gasoline heating oil and european gasoil
the number of short positions has fallen to just million barrels down from million in january and the lowest number for at least five years
there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about oil including rapid growth in global oil consumption continued supply restraint by opec falling output in venezuela and the possible of sanctions on iran
oecd oil inventories have fallen back in line with the average and are now below the average if adjusted for increased consumption
senior opec leaders have indicated they see room for prices to rise further and have no intention of boosting output before the end of
nonetheless the hedge fund community s positioning has become exceptionally lopsided which could herald a sharp correction in prices if and when fund managers try to close some of their open positions
portfolio managers now have record or ratios of long to short positions in wti brent gasoline and european gasoil
in the past such lopsided positioning has often heralded a sharp reversal in prices when fund managers have attempted to exit from their positions
but this time around few portfolio managers seem to be worried
most seem convinced fundamentals will drive prices higher and eventually allow them to liquidate their long positions into a rising rather than a falling market
the calculation could be right but there are still reasons to be concerned by the sheer concentration of long positions
rising oil prices are filtering through into more drilling activity in the united states which will support even faster growth in production by the end of
the number of rigs drilling for oil in the united states has risen in each of the last three weeks in response to rising prices after hitting a plateau during the previous seven weeks
with oil prices now above the average oil consumption is no longer getting a boost from low prices and is increasingly reliant on strong economic growth around the world
but the economic outlook is clouded by rising trade tensions as well as increases in interest rates in the united states and the other major economies
hedge fund managers have gambled everything on a goldilocks scenario in which oil prices rise without damaging demand or spurring too much shale drilling
they also need the global economic expansion to continue without interruption throughout the rest of and to continue boosting oil consumption at record rates
perhaps this panglossian scenario will come to pass but if it does not lopsided hedge fund positioning could be setting the oil market up for some sharp price movements ahead
