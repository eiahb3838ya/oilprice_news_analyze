court blocks trump administration order delaying boost in fuel penalties
washington reuters a federal court in new york on monday blocked the trump administration s decision to delay a rule that would raise penalties for automakers who do not meet federal fuel efficiency requirements
the
circuit court of appeals issued an order vacating the july decision of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa to suspend a obama administration regulation
the regulation set to take effect in september would more than double penalties
automakers protested the hike saying it could increase industry compliance costs by billion annually
congress ordered federal agencies in to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation
in response nhtsa proposed raising fines for every gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards under the corporate average fuel economy cafe program but delayed the effective date to september
nhtsa said in a statement on monday it is aware of the order issued today by the second circuit and will review the court s opinion once it is last month nhtsa said it was proposing to cancel the planned obama administration hike in penalties for automakers whose vehicles fail to meet minimum standards a move that could eventually make monday s court ruling moot
vera pardee senior counsel at the center for biological diversity one of the groups that sued said the decision means nhtsa must justify decreasing it despite the inflation adjustment act s clear command to prevent erosion of new york california and three other states in september had sued the federal government in the
circuit court of appeals for delaying the rollout of the higher penalties as did several environmental groups
nhtsa said previously the increases would potentially result in an additional million in annual civil penalties
automakers say the increases would dramatically raise costs since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits used to meet requirements
some automakers historically have opted to pay fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements

nhtsa said last july that many automakers were falling behind current fuel standards and face the possibility of paying larger cafe penalties over the next several reporting by david shepardson editing by jonathan oatis
