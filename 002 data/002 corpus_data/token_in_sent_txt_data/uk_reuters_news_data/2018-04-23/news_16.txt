update 1-britain to set up compensation scheme for "windrush" migrants
london reuters britain will compensate some caribbean immigrants who have lived legally in britain for decades and have wrongly been labelled illegal immigrants because of trouble documenting their status interior minister amber rudd said on monday
the government will also waive fees associated with becoming a citizen and ensure these british residents do not have to pass britain s citizenship test rudd told parliament
instead she said individuals would be assigned a case worker who would decide on nationality and the burden of proof has been shifted so the government would take a more lenient approach
the state has let these people down rudd said
none of this can undo the pain already endured but i hope it demonstrates the government s commitment to put these wrongs right going thousands of people from the windrush generation were invited to britain to plug labour shortfalls between and but some of them and their descendants have been caught out by tighter immigration rules
some of these migrants have been asked to provide documentary evidence of their life in britain they had never previously been required to keep and in some cases denied rights detained and threatened with deportation
the crisis has cast britain in an unsympathetic light and raised awkward questions about how the aggressive pursuit of lower immigration sits alongside the desire to be an global economy
migrants who have already returned to their country of origin but want to come back as british citizens will be helped to do so rudd said
rudd emphasised her commitment to tackling illegal immigration but conceded that successive governments bore responsibility for the policies that had an unintended and sometimes devastating impact on people
these people worked here for decades in many cases they helped establish the national health services they paid their taxes they are british in all but legal status and this should never have been allowed to happen rudd said
rudd said all interior ministry records dating back to would be checked to see if anyone had been wrongly deported but no cases had been identified so far with about half of the documents verified
the shadow interior minister diane abbott welcomed the measures and said the compensation should be more than more than just a token amount
the home secretary has to understand that ultimately the buck stops with her abbott said
the home secretary said the situation should never have been allowed to happen
she was the home secretary
she should never have allowed them to reporting by andrew macaskill editing by david milliken william maclean
