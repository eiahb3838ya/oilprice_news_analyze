iran says will not halt aerospace programme despite u.s. warning
new delhi reuters iran will continue with its aerospace programme despite warnings foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said on wednesday adding there was no international law prohibiting such a programme
zarif who is in new delhi on a bilateral visit also told reuters that leaving a nuclear deal agreed with world powers is an option available with tehran but is not the only option on the table
the united states earlier this month issued a warning to iran against pursuing three planned space rocket launches that it said would violate a security council resolution because they use ballistic missile technology
under the security council resolution which enshrined the nuclear deal in iran is called upon to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years
iran has ruled out negotiations with washington over its military capabilities particularly the missile programme run by the revolutionary guards
it says the programme is purely defensive and denies missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads
president donald trump pulled out of an international agreement on iran s nuclear programme in may and reimposed sanctions on tehran
he said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on iran s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in syria yemen lebanon and iraq
