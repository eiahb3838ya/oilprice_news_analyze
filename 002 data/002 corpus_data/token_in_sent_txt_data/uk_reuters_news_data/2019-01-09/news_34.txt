update 2-mexico holds firm in fuel theft fight, panic buying hits capital
salamanca mexico reuters mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador said on tuesday an crackdown on fuel theft was not in vain despite shortages that spread to the capital after the government closed pipelines and refineries to choke the black market
fuel theft has dropped from truck loads per day to since thousands of soldiers were sent to company petroleos mexicanos pemex installations last month lopez obrador said at a daily news conference
the crackdown on a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions is the leftist president s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office on but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy
by closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states
worried motorists in mexico city rushed to fill their tanks on tuesday causing some gas stations to shut their doors and lines at others
critics said that with pipelines closed there was less theft only because less fuel was available to steal
one internet meme likened the strategy to closing banks in order to tackle bank robbery
criminal groups linked to drug cartels have long been blamed for a fuel black market but lopez obrador said last month that far more was being stolen directly from pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials
on tuesday he said the military had discovered a mile hose that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at pemex s salamanca refinery in the state of guanajuato a major hub in central mexico into a secret storage area
lopez obrador admitted there were complaints but said shortages were not widespread
he urged an end to panic buying and said the problem was distribution not supply
this is not in vain lopez obrador said
we are going to end within sight of the salamanca refinery s metal towers hundreds of people waited for fuel to arrive for up to five hours at two gas stations operated by exxon mobil corp
federico garcia a construction company manger waiting at one of the stations said his business was beginning to feel the pinch and would have to slow activities if normal supply did not resume in a couple of days
we are already beginning to stop work precisely because of the lack of fuel said garcia wearing sunglasses and with sweat visible on his forehead under a bright midday sun
at the refinery convoys of military vehicles transporting armed soldiers could be seen approaching the facility and inside the refinery gates uniformed soldiers could be seen inspecting tanker trucks both entering and leaving
juan pablo gonzalez who heads a gas station owners association said pemex had reopened a pipeline from the salamanca refinery for a few hours on monday but shut it quickly because officials immediately detected a drop in pressure as thieves opened up illegal taps on the line
lopez obrador said the government was investigating members of the previous administration who were involved in the fuel distribution system for signs they had taken part in the black market
the list of people under investigation includes the former head of security at pemex a military general close to former president enrique pena nieto he said
local media showed images of tanker trucks escorted by federal police heading from coastal states to the country s interior
it was not immediately clear what impact the crackdown will have on imports of fuel
mexico is the top export destination for energy products importing about million barrels every day or nearly a quarter of all overseas sales
