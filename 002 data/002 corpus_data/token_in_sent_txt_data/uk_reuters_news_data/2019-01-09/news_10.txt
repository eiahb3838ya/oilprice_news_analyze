u.s. house democrats to test republicans on trump’s wall demand
washington jan reuters as a partial government shutdown neared the mark democrats on wednesday were set to test republicans resolve in backing president donald trump s drive to build a wall on the border with mexico which has sparked an impasse over agency funding
house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi and her fellow democrats who took control of the chamber last week plan to advance a bill to immediately reopen the treasury department the securities and exchange commission and several other agencies that have been in partial shutdown mode since
democrats are eager to force republicans to choose between funding the treasury s internal revenue service at a time when it should be gearing up to issue tax refunds to millions of americans and voting to keep it partially shuttered
in a countermove the trump administration said on tuesday that even without a new shot of funding the irs would somehow make sure those refund checks get sent
but it was the republican president s insistence on a massive barrier on the border that dominated the washington debate and sparked a political blame game
in a nationally televised address on tuesday night trump asked how much more american blood must be shed before congress does its job referring to murders he said were committed by illegal immigrants
senate democratic leader chuck schumer responding to trump said he and the president both wanted stronger border security but disagreed over the most effective approach
most presidents have used white house oval office addresses for noble purposes
this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration schumer said
later this week pelosi will force votes that one by one provide the money to operate departments ranging from homeland security and justice to state agriculture commerce and labor
by using a democratic majority to ram those bills through the house pelosi is hoping enough senate republicans back her up and abandon trump s wall gambit
the political maneuvering comes amid a rising public backlash over the suspension of some government activities that has resulted in the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers
other essential employees are being required to report to work but without pay for the time being
with tempers running high over trump s demand for billion just for this year to fund wall construction there are doubts pelosi s plan will succeed in forcing the senate to act
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a republican has not budged from his hard line of refusing to bring up any government funding bill that does not have trump s backing
the funding fight stems from congress inability to complete work by a deadline on funding all government agencies
it did manage however to appropriate money for about percent of the government by that deadline mainly military and programs
as house democrats plow ahead trump and vice president mike pence will go to capitol hill on wednesday to attend a weekly closed lunch meeting of senate republicans
they are expected to urge them to hold firm on his wall demands even as some are publicly warning their patience is wearing thin
later in the day trump is scheduled to host bipartisan congressional leaders to see if they can break the deadlock
on thursday trump travels to the border to highlight an immigration crisis that his base of conservative supporters wants him to address
but so far there have been few signs that either trump or his democratic opponents in congress are moving toward a deal
