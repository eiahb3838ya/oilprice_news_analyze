update 10-in oval office speech, trump demands a wall but does not declare emergency
washington reuters president donald trump urged congress in a televised speech on tuesday to give him billion billion pounds this year to help build a wall on the border with mexico but stopped short of declaring a national emergency to pay for the barrier with military funds
facing democratic opposition in congress to a wall that he promised to build as a presidential candidate trump said in his first address from the oval office that there was a growing security and humanitarian crisis at the border
using blunt language in an attempt to win public support the republican president said illegal immigrants and drugs flowing across the southern border posed a serious threat to american safety
how much more american blood must be shed before congress does its job he said recounting gruesome details of murders he said were committed by illegal immigrants
but after days of hinting he might use presidential powers to declare an emergency as a first step towards directing money for the wall without congressional approval trump said he would continue seeking a solution to the impasse with congress
trump s speech came days into a partial government shutdown precipitated by his demand for the wall
public opposition to the shutdown is growing and that could hurt trump as he said last month he would be proud to close the government to fight for the wall
democratic leaders in a rebuttal also carried live on national television accused the president on tuesday night of using fear tactics and spreading misinformation about the situation along the border
the president has chosen fear
we want to start with the facts said nancy pelosi democratic speaker of the house of representatives
the fact is president trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health safety and of the american people and withhold the paychecks of innocent workers across the nation many of them veterans she said
a poll released on tuesday found that percent of adults mainly blamed trump for the shutdown up percentage points from late december while percent blamed congressional democrats and percent faulted republicans in congress
republican lawmakers have increasingly expressed concerns about trump s handling of the dispute
but he has shown no signs of giving up
he is scheduled to visit the southwest border on thursday and may still choose to make the national emergency declaration
vice president mike pence told reporters on monday the president was considering the possibility and the white house counsel s office was studying its legality
democrats and other opponents of a wall have threatened to take legal action if trump issues an emergency order
they say he is manufacturing a crisis in a bid to meet his presidential campaign promise for a wall that he said at the time would be paid for by mexico
the mexican government has refused to provide such funds
trump was to meet at the white house on wednesday with democratic and republican congressional leaders
politics coloured the remarks from both sides on tuesday
trump said and hispanics were especially hard hit by the border crisis both groups are key democratic constituencies
pelosi pointedly mentioned that veterans were hurt by the shutdown trump has courted veterans as a candidate and as president
trump at times tried to adopt a softer tone
this is a humanitarian crisis a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul he said suggesting that women and children were among the migrants often victimized by trafficking across the border
hoping to demonstrate flexibility during his nearly speech trump said of the border barrier he wants built at the request of the democrats it will be a steel barrier and not a concrete but democrats have opposed not just the construction materials to be used but the extent of a project that could end up costing more than billion over the long run
democrats also argue that a mix of fencing which already has been constructed in many parts of the border and tools would be cheaper and more effective in securing the border
pelosi said trump rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government agencies shuttered as a result of the fight over the wall and that he was obsessed with forcing american taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective she has previously called the wall immoral
trump took issue with that in his speech
the only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized he said
senate democratic leader chuck schumer who delivered a rebuttal along with pelosi urged the president to reopen the government while the debate over immigration policies continued
the symbol of america should be the statue of liberty not a wall he said
so our suggestion is a simple one
president reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security
