china's three gorges rules out new domestic hydro projects
jan reuters china three gorges corp ctgc operator of the world s largest hydropower plant is turning to projects offshore a senior official said as domestic costs soar and space runs out on the country s crowded rivers
we don t have any plans to build more hydropower projects in china but will develop more projects overseas said sun zhiyu the company s on the sidelines of a meeting on tuesday
we already have business in more than countries and will focus mostly on south asia southeast asia africa and latin america he added
the gw three gorges project on the yangtze river was completed in after a boom throughout china
its turbines generate billion of electricity per year
ctgc parent of listed china yangtze power corp has since completed other giant dams on the yangtze upstream and its total hydropower generation capacity including projects under construction stands at nearly gw more than the total power capacity of australia
china s total hydropower capacity hit gw last year accounting for a fifth of total generation but its reliance on large and disruptive dam projects has been controversial
advocacy groups claim capacity could safely be doubled but the government has slowed down hydro approvals amid concerns about its devastating impact on communities and ecosystems
while hydropower produces no emissions during generation opponents say it contributes to global warming by submerging forest and plant life under water
giant dams and reservoirs also cause biodiversity loss and put regions like sichuan under greater seismic pressure
worried about potential unrest china has sought to improve the way hydropower migrants are compensated
payments to displaced residents now account for half of a project s total costs and tougher rules are set to be implemented next year
china has also cracked down on small hydropower said to have caused untold damage to aquatic ecosystems throughout the country
however industry advocates said at an industry meeting in beijing on tuesday that hydropower must still play a vital role in china s clean energy goals
wang yinan researcher with the development and research center a cabinet think tank said new rules had raised costs and eroded investment incentives and transmission capacity was also insufficient
fake environment protection ideas and ignorant ecological views are flooding society and demonising hydroelectric projects which will mislead national policies national security and ecological protection she said
