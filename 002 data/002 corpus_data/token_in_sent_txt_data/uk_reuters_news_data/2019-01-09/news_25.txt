rpt-holy guacamole! mexican fuel shortage threatens super bowl snack
repeats story published tuesday to widen distribution by adriana barrera mexico city jan reuters super bowl fans may have to go without guacamole this year if avocado farmers in mexico can not send their fruit to the united states because of a prolonged fuel shortage
like clockwork mexican producers ship thousands of tonnes of avocado to the united states in early february every year where guacamole is a staple living room snack on super bowl sunday
but the mexican government s efforts to clamp down on years of mounting fuel theft has a prompted a fuel shortage that has left many states in central and western mexico high and dry
among those states is michoacan the country s main avocado grower
producers there expect to ship tonnes for this super bowl tonnes more than last year
our three most important weeks of the year are this one and the next two
this is when we ship for super bowl week said ramon paz spokesman for apeam a business association representing mexican avocado producers and exporters
we have from now to january to ship all that volume
if we don t ship it by then we can t do so later paz said
so far tonnes have been sent to the united states for the super bowl which will be held on in atlanta georgia
the annual football championship is the television broadcast of the year regularly drawing more than million viewers
the fuel shortage has not yet affected exports to the united states but it has begun to hamper transportation in mexico for workers and harvested avocados paz added
in addition to the super bowl mexican producers also have to meet commitments with supermarkets and restaurants in the united states
the crackdown on fuel theft which has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions is leftist president andres manuel lopez obrador s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office on
the move risks angering consumers and hurting the economy
