update 1-dutch court to hear demands to end groningen gas output on jan. 17
adds details amsterdam jan reuters the dutch high court said on wednesday it would consider demands on seeking an immediate end to gas production from the groningen field after the government said it would cut output gradually
the government has capped groningen production at billion cubic metres bcm in the year starting october and said it would reduce output to zero in the coming decade
the high court said it had received objections to the plan ranging from civilians to local and regional authorities expressing concerns about seismic risks caused by drilling and demanding that production is stopped at once
two of the objections would be heard this month and the rest were expected to be dealt with in april the court said adding that it would take several weeks to reach a verdict after the hearing
the petitioners in the january hearing have demanded an immediate production halt at least until the court has made a final decision on the production plan
analysts say the court was unlikely to grant an immediate halt in output because the netherlands still depends on groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply
years of gas extraction have led to a string of minor earthquakes in the groningen region damaging thousands of houses and buildings in the northern dutch province
the government said last year that production would end completely by after already being cut by more than percent since its peak in
