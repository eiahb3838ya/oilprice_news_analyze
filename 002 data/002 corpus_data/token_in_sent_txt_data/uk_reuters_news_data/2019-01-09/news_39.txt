update 2-epa says it is committed to rule for higher ethanol blend by summer driving season
new reuters the environmental protection agency said on tuesday it would complete a rule to boost sales of blends of gasoline by the summer driving season despite a partial government shutdown
the statement from the environmental regulator came after the agency warned at least two lawmakers that the shutdown had delayed its timeline for initially rolling out the rule according to two sources briefed on the matter
president donald trump pledged in the to november s congressional elections to lift the summer ban on sales of gasoline in a boost to an ethanol industry upended by trade wars and weak demand growth at home
the trump administration hoped to have the rule published by february and approved by june but the epa recently told lawmakers that the timeline would be delayed because of the partial government shutdown said the two sources who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity
an epa spokesman said the agency would still complete the rule before the summer driving season
this is a priority for both president trump and acting administrator wheeler
the ongoing partial shutdown will not impede epa s ability to keep to our deadline michael abboud said in an emailed statement in response to a request for comment
the acting epa administrator is andrew wheeler
the epa currently bans the higher ethanol blend called during summer because of concerns it contributes to smog on hot days a worry biofuels advocates say is unfounded
gasoline contains percent ethanol versus the percent found in most gasoline
trump s decision to lift the ban of summer sales of was applauded by farmers and lawmakers and criticized by the oil lobby as an illegal overreach by the epa and its acting administrator
the proposal is expected to be coupled with a slew of reforms to the market that underpins the nation s renewable fuel policy
brooke coleman executive director of the advanced biofuels business council said the epa had been drafting the proposal for a long time and should have no issues meeting its june target
he said the epa should delay the trading reforms if they are slowing the process down
that would keep the president s promise to rural communities while taking some pressure off regulators coleman said
