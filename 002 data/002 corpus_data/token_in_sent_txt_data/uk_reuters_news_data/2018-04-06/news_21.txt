corrected-texas oil output surge clogs pipelines, depresses prices
this april story corrects paragraph to show the expansion will add barrels of daily capacity not million barrels
by devika krishna kumar new york reuters the permian basin in texas is leading the way as oil production has reached an high but the prolific output is causing bottlenecks as pipelines transporting the crude have filled up more quickly than expected
that has depressed prices there posing a threat to future production while providing a boost to pipeline companies as the lines have filled to
with few new pipeline projects scheduled for this year producers may be forced to slow drilling or even shut in active production
the problem illustrates the snags that can arise in transporting crude to the gulf coast as oil prices have rebounded to more than a barrel and companies have reduced costs to make drilling more profitable in the permian
production there is estimated to have hit a record million bpd in march nearly a third of overall production of million bpd according to the energy information administration eia
permian drillers are branching out into relatively areas of the region said john zanner energy analyst for rbn energy
as these fringe areas begin to get exploited we are seeing more and more crude that needs to find a pipeline to cushing or the gulf coast he said
most analysts estimated pipelines out of the permian would fill completely by but this may already be happening
according to market intelligence firm genscape pipeline utilization from the permian to the gulf coast averaged about percent this year and percent in the last four weeks
crude for delivery in midland texas traded at under the price of benchmark futures on wednesday weakest since october
west texas sour the sour grade delivered into midland traded as much as a barrel below futures
midland light sweet crude currently trades at more than a barrel below west texas intermediate at east houston a key delivery spot for export markets the biggest discount on record
graphic prices of crude in permian texas plunge as pipelines fill graphic texas oil output surge what the spreads are telling you is that these pipelines are full going to the gulf coast said kendrick rhea at energy consultancy east daley capital
the wide spreads mean pipeline operators are now seeing a surge in demand and throughput traders and analysts said
spreads have even widened enough to cover spot shipping rates which are typically higher than committed rates offered by pipeline companies
for midstream companies this could show up in earnings reports for several quarters
analysts revenue projections for permian pipeline companies enterprise products partners lp energy transfer partners lp and plains all american pipeline lp have been revised higher over the last days according to thomson reuters data
all three rank in the top percent in terms of upward revisions for north american companies in the thomson reuters universe and the same model projects all three will exceed revenue projections in the first quarter
they re going to see record flows coming out they re going to see record margins on marketing and on tariffs for the rest of the year rhea said
as of march the permian had a total of million bpd of outgoing pipeline rail and local refining capacity according to genscape of which outgoing pipeline capacity accounts for million bpd
the next boost will be the expansion of permian express which will add barrels of daily capacity in late
the enterprise line could also expand capacity to bring it to bpd from bpd late last year
by projects including the cactus pipeline and epic lines will add more than million bpd of additional capacity
