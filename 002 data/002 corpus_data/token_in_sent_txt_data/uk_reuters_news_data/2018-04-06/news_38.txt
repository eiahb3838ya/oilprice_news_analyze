india sets oct target for gas trading exchange ahead of east coast supplies -sources
delhi april reuters india plans to set up a natural gas trading exchange as early as october this year to prepare for a surge in supply from india s east coast and a slew of liquefied natural gas lng terminals
oil minister dharmendra pradhan in a meeting last week with industry officials set a deadline of for the country s primary natural gas distribution regulator to set up the exchange said three sources familiar with the discussions
the exchange is aimed at standardizing natural gas prices said a government official a consultant and a gas company executive so that domestic prices are not set at such a discount to international market rates
india currently imports lng at global rates of around per million british thermal units mmbtu while the government sets domestic gas prices at per mmbtu
if we have proper pricing and market access then it is easier for the gas sector to develop said atanu chakraborty who heads india s upstream regulator
the exchange will also help to reduce the risks associated with the pricing differences he said
details on how the gas exchange will function and how prices will be set were not immediately available
phone calls to india s oil ministry for more information have gone unanswered
indian prime minister narendra modi has laid out a plan to increase the share of gas in india s energy mix to percent by from below percent now oil minister pradhan said at a conference in thailand last year
india currently produces close to million standard cubic meters per day mscmd of gas and imports another mscmd as lng according to government figures for
in the next three to five years as natural gas projects from india s oil and natural gas corp and a partnership involving bp and reliance industries ramp up india s domestic gas output will be in the range of mscmd said chakraborty
lng imports are expected to grow to around million tonnes a year mscmd over the same period he said referring to pradhan s speech
sufficient supplies for the smooth operation of a gas exchange are one of the primary concerns
india s industrial gas consumers such as power plants and fertiliser makers were disappointed in after promised gas output from the east coast s basin fell short of expectations
many facilities that were built in anticipation of more gas production remain stranded without adequate fuel
the partnership plans to develop three assets off india s east coast and ongc is developing another gas field in the same region
