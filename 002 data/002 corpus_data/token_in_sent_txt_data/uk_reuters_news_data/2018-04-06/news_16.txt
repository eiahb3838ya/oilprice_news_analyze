colombia's top court orders government to protect amazon forest in landmark case
bogota april thomson reuters foundation colombia s highest court has told the government it must take urgent action to protect its amazon rainforest and stem rising deforestation in what campaigners said was an historic moment that should help conserve forests and counter climate change
in their ruling on thursday the judges said that colombia which is home to a swathe of rainforest roughly the size of germany and england combined saw deforestation rates in its amazon region increase by percent from to
it is clear despite numerous international commitments regulations that the colombian state has not efficiently addressed the problem of deforestation in the amazon the supreme court said
the ruling comes after a group of young plaintiffs ranging in age from seven to filed a lawsuit against the government in january demanding it protect their right to a healthy environment
the plaintiffs had said the government s failure to stop the destruction of the amazon jeopardised their futures and violated their constitutional rights to a healthy environment life food and water
rights group dejusticia which supported the plaintiffs case said the verdict meant it was the first time a lawsuit of this kind had been ruled upon favourably in latin america
the supreme court s decision marks an historical precedent in terms of climate change litigation said camila bustos one of the plaintiffs and a researcher at dejusticia
in its ruling the court recognised colombia s amazon as an entity subject of rights which means that the rainforest has been granted the same legal rights as a human being
the ruling states the importance of protecting the rights of future generations and even declares the amazon a subject of rights bustos told the thomson reuters foundation
the court ordered the government both at the local and national level along with the environment and agriculture ministries and environmental authorities to come up with action plans within four months to combat deforestation in the amazon
the amazon s destruction leads to imminent and serious damage to children and adults for both present and future generations the judges said
the ruling stated that forests were being felled to make way for more grazing and agricultural land as well as coca crops the raw ingredient for cocaine illegal mining and logging
deforestation is a key source of greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change which damages ecosystems and water sources and leads to land degradation the court said
without a healthy environment subjects of law and living beings in general will not be able to survive let alone safeguard those rights for our children or for future generations the ruling said
the lawsuit follows a surge in litigation around the world demanding action or claiming damages over the impact of climate change from rising sea levels to pollution
