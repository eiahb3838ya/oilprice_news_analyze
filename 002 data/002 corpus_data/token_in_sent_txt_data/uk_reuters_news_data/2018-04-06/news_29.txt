exclusive-biofuels battle: senator moves to expand small refiner exemption
new york reuters lawmakers spearheading efforts to reform biofuels regulations are considering a blanket waiver for all small refineries according to four sources familiar with their draft legislation
the move would save some refiners a fortune but would outrage the powerful corn lobby
the draft bill led by republican senator john cornyn of texas adds fuel to a fiery dispute between refiners and corn growers over the future of the renewable fuel standard rfs a law that requires the refining sector to blend increasing amounts of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation s fuel supply each year
the environmental protection agency epa already has the authority to exempt small refineries of under barrels per day bpd on a basis if they can prove disproportionate economic hardship from the costs of rfs compliance
reuters reported this week that epa had given andeavor one of the nation s largest refining firms the exemption for three of its refineries that fall under the standard
the decision could save the firm more than million in regulatory costs
andeavor reported billion in profit last year
the report outraged representatives of the corn and biofuels industries who argue giving the small refiner exemption to large profitable companies is an abuse of the program that will undermine ethanol demand
the epa also recently gave waivers from the rfs to more than two dozen refineries for about triple the number granted in previous years
such exemptions free refiners from the requirement to either blend biofuels into their refined products or to buy credits from refiners who do such blending
the cost of the credits can amount to tens of millions of dollars annually
cornyn s draft legislation would seek to reduce the burden of compliance to the law by providing a blanket exemption for all oil refineries classified as small according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
but it is not yet clear whether small refineries operated by giants such as andeavor exxon mobil corp or chevron would be eligible for the blanket exemption the sources said
cornyn s blanket exemption would mainly target small plants operated by private companies they said
after the reuters report on the andeavor exemption a handful of biofuels groups called for a moratorium on new exemptions and greater transparency in the waiver program which the epa runs largely in secret to protect what it has deemed the companies private information
the renewable fuels association filed a formal request with the epa this week seeking details on who got the exemptions and why
cornyn s effort represents the oil industry s best chance for biofuels reform after efforts by president donald trump to broker an executive or fix ended in dispute
one of the sources on the draft bill said the blanket exemption was a big priority for the senate environmental and public works committee whose chairman wyoming republican john barrasso is helping prepare the bill
wyoming is home to several small refineries
cornyn spokeswoman ryann durant said the bill was still being drafted based on stakeholder and legislative she declined to comment directly on the waiver provision
environmental and public works committee spokesman mike danylak declined to speak about the draft legislation but said chairman barrasso believes the renewable fuel standard is broken and must be cornyn s draft would theoretically cut as much as percent of america s refining capacity out of the biofuels program based on the combined production capacity of all refineries operating under bpd
biofuels advocates worry the provision would translate into a similar reduction in the volume of biofuels that the government requires under the rfs currently over billion gallons per year mostly in ethanol
we support narrow exemptions that allow some small refineries out of the program but we vehemently oppose a blanket exemption said michael mcadams president of the advanced biofuels council
larger refining companies meanwhile fear the move would instead just shift a greater burden of the blending off of small players and onto them
the american petroleum institute which represents companies operating the nation s biggest refineries said in a february letter to the epa that biofuels policy must maintain a level playing field in the marketplace and must apply equally across the whole refining the sources did not say how cornyn s proposed blanket waiver would address the overall volumes mandates
the cornyn draft bill also includes a slew of other measures previously reported by reuters which are intended to help refiners while also helping maintain solid demand for ethanol
among them is the addition of a new type of compliance credit that oil companies can use to meet their requirements under the rfs the sunsetting of requirements to blend conventional renewable fuels like ethanol after combined with an extension for advanced fuels of about three years and a waiver that would allow a higher ethanol fuel blend to be sold in summertime months
