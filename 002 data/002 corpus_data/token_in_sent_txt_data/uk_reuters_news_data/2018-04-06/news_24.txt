interview-saving the world: the 'new normal' for finance?
london april thomson reuters foundation amit bouri is evangelical that members of his network and many more like them can right the wrongs of the world using the muscle of their money
and he said he knows what needs to change to make that happen the way the world s financial markets work
the system right now is not sufficiently creating an environment where there is equality and sustainability he said by phone from new york
bouri heads the global impact investing network giin a he in that supports and encourages impact investing investments that produce positive social and environmental change as well as generate a profit
we are positing a very aspirational vision where all investors take into account social and environmental impact where this becomes part of the new normal of how people according to oxfam a charity the majority of the world is missing out
last year the poorest half of the global population saw no increase in their wealth while percent of the wealth that was generated went to the richest percent
bouri said impact investing goes beyond avoiding harmful investments like tobacco and weapons and focuses on investing proactively to drive change
examples include the million fund that built affordable homes for families in rural brazil and clean energy systems for those with limited access to power including schools and hospitals that investors funded in india
the amount of money going into impact investing is rising by about percent a year said the giin whose survey found the impact investing market was worth at least billion
it is possible to make a profit and do good for the world
that is what has captured the attention of so many people when it comes to impact investing bouri told the thomson reuters foundation
he expects impact investing will keep growing not least because reports have found millennials are more interested in such issues than their parents generation as are women investors and will inherit wealth in years to come
that wealth is now going to be controlled by people that care about sustainability and impact he said
bouri said the giin has also fielded more enquiries from institutional investors in the last months the pension funds and insurance companies that collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets
these are firms that have fiduciary responsibilities they take very seriously an obligation to pay back pensioners in or years from now he said
the growing effects of inequality and climate change on market sustainability mean major fiduciaries are thinking about how they can incorporate impact into their investment aside from housing and clean energy impact investing was also effective in areas such as conservation and access to clean water said bouri
yet he feels its greatest contribution might lie in showing how finance can work in a different way
the giin absolutely believes that impact investing has a tremendous opportunity to grow not just on its own but in influencing how all investing is done
in doing so we have the potential to set the world on a different trajectory he said
