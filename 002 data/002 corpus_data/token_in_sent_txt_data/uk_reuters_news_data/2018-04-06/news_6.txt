trump to mull u.s. biofuels policy options in cabinet meeting monday
new york april reuters president donald trump will review a list of potential changes to the nation s renewable fuel laws at a meeting with members of his cabinet on monday two sources said as biofuels groups warned against any action that would weaken ethanol demand
trump in recent months has waded deep into the controversial issue of reforming the renewable fuel standard a law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel pool each year or buy credits from those who do
merchant refiners like valero and pbf energy pulled trump into the debate arguing that complying with the regulation has grown too costly and will kill off the types of jobs trump had promised to defend
but trump s efforts to reform the law have been met by fierce opposition from corn farmers and ethanol producers who are quick to remind the president that he also vowed to preserve the rfs during campaign stops
monday s meeting will include environmental protection agency chief scott pruitt and agricultural secretary sonny perdue
pruitt heads into the meeting under pressure from lawmakers to resign over allegations he broke ethics rules by renting a room in a washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist
pruitt and perdue have spent the last several weeks compiling a list of options for trump to consider on the rfs ranging from more aggressive tactics like capping the prices of the blending credits at the center of the program to deferring the whole issue to congress
in recent weeks advisers have urged trump to let lawmakers tackle the issue and use the threat of executive action to coerce them to make it a priority
iowa farmers and biofuel groups sent a letter to iowa republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst on friday urging them to reach out to trump to express their anger
we urge you to reach out directly to president trump to make clear that any administration action to waive or cap rins will be viewed as nothing less than a declaration of war on rural america and a complete abdication of his repeated promises to protect the rfs according to the letter orchestrated by the iowa renewable fuels association
biofuel groups are also frustrated with the administration over reports that the epa was exempting small refineries from the program including three owned by one of the nation s largest refining companies andeavor
