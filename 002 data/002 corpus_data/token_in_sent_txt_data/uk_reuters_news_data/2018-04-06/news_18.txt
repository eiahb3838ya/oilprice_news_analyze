apple says repeal of u.s. epa carbon plan would threaten investments
washington reuters apple inc said on friday it opposes any repeal by the environmental protection agency of the clean power plan which is a priority of the agency s administrator scott pruitt and would reverse an program to curb greenhouse gases
repealing the plan would jeopardize the country s position in the race for investments in clean energy particularly its competition with china apple said
it was the first public comment by a company on the proposed repeal of the plan which has never been implemented because of legal challenges
repealing the clean power plan will subject consumers like apple and our large manufacturing partners to increased investment uncertainty the company said in a filing to the agency
apple which says it runs its operations fully on renewable energy such as wind and solar power added that repeal of the plan would also threaten development and investments that have already been made in renewable power
lisa jackson who was the epa s chief from to under former president barack obama runs apple s program to address climate change through renewable energy and energy efficiency
the opposition from one of america s biggest and best known companies to pruitt s planned repeal comes as the epa head is battling allegations about his ethics including that he leased a room in a washington townhouse by the wife of energy industry lobbyist
pruitt proposed last october to repeal the clean power plan a set of standards for states intended to cut pollution from power plants the largest emitters of greenhouse gases by percent below levels by
in december the epa launched a comment period for a possible replacement of the plan
under pruitt the epa has said the clean power plan was illegal and exceeded the agency s statutory authority
the plan never went into effect after it was suspended by the dc circuit court of appeals
the epa has not indicated whether or when it would propose a new rule to regulate the emissions
the proposed repeal is part of trump s broader effort to support the coal oil and natural gas industries and to boost exports of the resources to cut trade deficits
epa spokesman jahan wilcox said in a response to apple s filing that the agency appreciates all public feedback and will be considering the comments as part of the rulemaking process
