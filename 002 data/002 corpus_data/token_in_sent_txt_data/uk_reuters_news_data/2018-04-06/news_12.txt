embattled epa chief's calendar shows industry had his ear
washington april reuters environmental protection agency head scott pruitt held more meetings with industry representatives than environmental advocates during his first seven months in office according to a reuters analysis of his schedule reflecting the agency s approach under his tenure
the newly released records obtained by the environmental integrity project watchdog group through a freedom of information act request come as the white house probes ethics allegations against pruitt
these include his rental of a room in a washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist
pruitt a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science has also faced criticism for frequent air travel spending on costly items in his office including a soundproof telephone booth and for a trip to morocco where he promoted exports of liquefied natural gas something outside the remit of an environmental regulator
president donald trump has praised pruitt s work at the epa for aggressively pursuing his agenda to roll back regulations he sees as unnecessary to pave the way for more oil gas and coal production and remove hurdles for a revival in domestic manufacturing
trump on thursday said pruitt was doing a fantastic job and was in coal and energy according to the calendar pruitt met with representatives of the industries epa regulates at least times from to making up about percent of his total meetings during that period
about half of those industry meetings were with representatives of the oil gas coal and mining industries including executives from companies like oil major bp refining giant valero energy corp coal producer murray energy and miner bhp billiton according to the records
most of the rest of the industry meetings were with representatives of agriculture including farm groups like the national cattlemen s association and biofuels producers like growth energy and poet according to the records
by contrast pruitt met only four times with environmental groups eager to see the epa limit pollution from those industries trout unlimited the center for climate and energy solutions a nonprofit association of state environmental agency leaders called ecos and the alliance to restore our waterways according to the records
past epa administrators have been criticized for spending too much time with environmental lobby groups and too little with industry
an epa spokesman jahan wilcox did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the balance of pruitt s meetings
liz purchia gannon a spokeswoman for former epa administrator gina mccarthy who served under president barack obama said the ratio of pruitt s industry to environmental group meetings was a contrast to the ratio of meetings mccarthy held
mccarthy met frequently with utility groups while the agency worked to form the clean power plan obama s top proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions gannon said
as head of epa she always met with environmental and public health groups and industry and business leaders
she believed strongly in meeting regularly with all sides said gannon who did not provide data on the meetings
pruitt also held a number of meetings with conservative policy like the heritage foundation and the family research council a religious group that argues that homosexual conduct is harmful to society according to the records
a portion of pruitt s schedule covering his first few months in office had already been released by the epa but the latest batch covers the broadest period so far
