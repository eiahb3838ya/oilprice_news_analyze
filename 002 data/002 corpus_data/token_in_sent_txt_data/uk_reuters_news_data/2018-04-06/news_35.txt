indonesia peatland swap plan questioned over deforestation risk
jakarta reuters an indonesian plan to curb the commercial use of peatlands by swapping nearly million hectares of forestry concessions on peat risks simply displacing environmental destruction to other parts of the archipelago green groups say
indonesia was blamed for one of the worst ever peat and forest fire crises that blanketed much of southeast asia in thick haze in and since then has sought to take back and protect vast tracts of peatlands from corporations
but environmentalists say a new land swap policy which will affect an area the size of lebanon may undermine those efforts if relatively undamaged land is given to companies that in the past have been criticized for unsustainable practices
an indonesian environment ministry official said under the deal companies will be evaluated over the course of this year to assess how well they have restored damaged peatland on existing concessions before receiving new land elsewhere
for this land swap we will look for empty land that is said hilman nugroho a senior official at the environment ministry
an alliance of environmental organizations said in a joint statement this week that the government was not being open about what land would be exchanged
we fear that vast areas of natural forest especially in kalimantan sumatra island and papua will be designated for land swaps and converted into pulpwood plantations in the name of peatland restoration the environmental organizations said
kalimantan is the indonesian portion of borneo island
the policy will also threaten the livelihoods and cultures of indigenous peoples said the statement which was issued by groups including the world wildlife fund indonesia and eyes on the forest
to estimate where potential land concessions would be given away the alliance compared satellite imagery of forested area with known government allocations of land suitable for plantations and inactive land
with this analysis we found that hectares of potential land swap locations are on natural forest area said syarul fitra of auriga one of the ngos in the alliance
the government has not made public the locations of the new concessions that will be given as part of the swap
an environment ministry document seen by reuters showed companies set to receive new land include several companies linked to asia pulp and paper app
one of those companies pt bumi mekar hijau was in found guilty by an indonesian court of illegally setting fires on its concession land in south sumatra
a spokesman for app declined to comment
bumi mekar hijau could not be reached for comment
indonesian president joko widodo approved last year a extension to a moratorium on issuing new licences to use land designated as primary forest and peatland
the country has suffered one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world often cleared for palm oil and other plantations or pulp and paper mills
in the last half century more than million hectares of indonesian rainforest representing an area twice the size of germany have been logged burned or degraded according to greenpeace
