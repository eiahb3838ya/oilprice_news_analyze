update 2-embattled epa chief's calendar shows industry had his ear
washington reuters environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt held more meetings with industry representatives than environmental advocates during his first seven months in office according to a reuters analysis of his schedule reflecting the agency s approach under his tenure
the newly released record of pruitt s schedule obtained through a freedom of information act request by the environmental integrity project watchdog group come as the white house probes allegations against pruitt
these include his rental of a room in a washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist
the pressure mounted late on friday as democratic members of the house of representatives called for president donald trump to immediately dismiss him over a host of ethics issues and for acting to counter the mission of his agency
three fellow republicans in the house have also called on pruitt to resign but the epa chief has widespread support from conservatives
pruitt a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science has also faced criticism for frequent air travel spending on costly items in his office including a soundproof telephone booth and a trip to morocco where he promoted exports of liquefied natural gas something outside the remit of an environmental regulator
president donald trump has praised pruitt for aggressively pursuing his agenda to roll back regulations he sees as unnecessary to pave the way for more oil gas and coal production as well as removing environmental hurdles to a revival in domestic manufacturing
trump on thursday said pruitt was doing a fantastic job and was in coal and energy while trump appears to support pruitt the president can change his mind quickly
last autumn trump said he had confidence in secretary of state rex tillerson even after their relationship was strained over iran and russia policy
trump fired tillerson last month
trump s chief of staff john kelly had advocated last week for trump to fire pruitt a white house official said
trump met with pruitt early on friday said the same official who declined to say what the meeting concerned
according to the calendar pruitt met with representatives of the industries epa regulates at least times from to of last year making up about percent of his total meetings during that period
about half of those industry meetings were with representatives of the oil gas coal and mining industries according to the records including executives from companies such as oil major bp plc refiner valero energy corp coal producer murray energy and miner bhp billiton
most of the rest of pruitt s industry meetings were with representatives of agriculture including farm groups like the national cattlemen s association and biofuels producers like growth energy and poet according to the records
but pruitt met only four times with environmental groups eager to see the epa limit pollution from those industries the records show trout unlimited the center for climate and energy solutions a nonprofit association of state environmental agency leaders called ecos and the alliance to restore our waterways
past epa administrators have been criticized by conservatives for spending too much time with environmental lobbying groups and too little with industry
pruitt a former attorney general of oklahoma said through a spokesman that he does not spend any time with polluters
i prosecute polluters
what i m spending time with are stakeholders who care about outcomes he said
it s washington to look at folks across the country from states to citizens to farmers and ranchers industry in general and say they are evil or wrong and we re not going to partner with them pruitt said
liz purchia gannon a spokeswoman for former epa administrator gina mccarthy who served under democratic president barack obama said the ratio of pruitt s industry to environmental group meetings was a contrast to the ratio of meetings mccarthy held
mccarthy met frequently with utility groups while the agency worked to form the clean power plan obama s top proposal to curb greenhouse gas emissions gannon said
as head of epa she always met with environmental and public health groups and industry and business leaders
she believed strongly in meeting regularly with all sides said gannon who did not provide data on the meetings
pruitt also held a number of meetings with conservative policy think tanks like the heritage foundation and the family research council a religious group that argues that homosexual conduct is harmful to society according to the records
a portion of pruitt s schedule covering his first few months in office had already been released by the epa but the latest batch covers the broadest period so far
