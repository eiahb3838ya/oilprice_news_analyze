hawaii evacuees leave newly lava-threatened homes on big island
pahoa hawaii june reuters national guard troops police and firefighters ushered the last group of evacuees from homes on the eastern tip of hawaii s big island early on saturday hours before creeping lava from the kilauea volcano severed all road access to the area officials said
a stream of lava as wide across as three football fields flowed over a highway near a key junction on the outskirts of kapoho a seaside community of private homes and vacation rentals rebuilt after a destructive eruption of kilauea in
the lava flow left kapoho and the adjacent development of vacationland encompassing about homes combined cut off from the rest of the island by road according to the hawaii county civil defense agency
authorities since wednesday had been urging residents of the area to pack up and leave before lava spewing from a volcanic fissure at the eastern foot of kilauea reached the area
the final phase of the evacuation was carried out on friday night and early saturday by fire and police department personnel with help from the hawaii national guard and public works teams county civil defense spokeswoman janet snyder told reuters by email
an estimated people live in the greater kapoho area but snyder said it was not immediately clear how many residents if any chose to stay behind
another people have already been evacuated from the leilani estates subdivision an area further west where dozens of homes have been devoured or cut off by rivers of molten rock streaming over the landscape since may
toxic sulfur dioxide gas emitted from the volcanic vents in the ground has created an additional hazard
so too have airborne volcanic glass fibers called pele s hair wispy strands produced by lava fountains and carried aloft by the wind
they are named for the volcano fire goddess of hawaiian myth
the lava itself extruded from about two dozen fissures that opened on the slope of kilauea s eastern rift zone earlier this month has also knocked out telephone and power lines and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant
the latest upheaval of kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes comes on the heels of an earlier eruption cycle that began in and continued almost nonstop for years destroying more than dwellings and other structures
the current fissure activity has been accompanied for weeks by daily periodic explosions of gas and volcanic rock from kilauea s summit crater as well as earthquakes
but the summit has quieted down over the past few days as tons of rubble shaken loose from the interior walls of the crater have fallen into the void and plugged up the bottom of the vent
scientists are unsure whether the blockage will eventually bring an end to further eruptions at the summit or lead to a buildup of pressure that could cause a much bigger explosion
