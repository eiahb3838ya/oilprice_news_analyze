klm ceo sees healthy demand in next few months
sydney reuters dutch airline klm is seeing healthy demand over the next few months the key summer period for european carriers its chief executive said and a recent fleet renewal programme will help it combat higher oil prices
looking at where we are in terms of loads and traffic we see healthy demand in europe and on long haul pieter elbers told reuters ahead of the annual international air transport association meeting in sydney on sunday
he declined to comment on yields for summer bookings
an updated industry profit forecast to be issued on monday by iata will be lower as the cost of oil infrastructure and labour rises the association said earlier this week
elbers said a fleet renewal programme will help the carrier part of the air group with new boeing dreamliners coming in jumbo jets being phased out and its ageing fleet of fokkers being replaced by new embraer jets
with these initiatives we are preparing for a situation with higher fuel prices he said
but the airline has no plans to change its jet fuel hedging policy
air is percent hedged for according to results and analysts have highlighted that with it being less hedged than european rivals its earnings are more vulnerable to rising oil prices
that hedging rate of percent for this year is up slightly compared with percent at the end of last year s first quarter
elbers said his focus remained on klm after strikes and union unrest at french sister company air france prompted the departure of group ceo janaillac last month
elbers is one of three executives in charge while the air group seeks a new ceo
brexit remains a concern for klm however with the dutch serving uk destinations from its amsterdam hub more than rival british airways serves from london heathrow
brexit is creating some uncertainty economically and that could affect our business he said
