update 3-hawaii evacuees leave homes as new lava threatens on big island
pahoa hawaii reuters national guard troops police and firefighters ushered the last group of evacuees from homes on the eastern tip of hawaii s big island early on saturday hours before lava from the kilauea volcano cut off road access to the area officials said
a stream of lava as wide as three football fields flowed over a highway near a junction at kapoho a seaside community of rebuilt after a destructive eruption of kilauea in
the lava flow left kapoho and the adjacent development of vacationland cut off from the rest of the island by road according to the hawaii county civil defense agency
also lava destroyed a freshwater lake boiling away all of the water in it the hawaiian volcano observatory reported late saturday local time
lava entered green lake within kapoho crater producing a large steam plume a hawaiian county fire department overflight reported that the lava filled the lake and apparently evaporated all the water the report said
authorities since wednesday had been urging residents of the area to leave before lava spewing from a volcanic fissure at the eastern foot of kilauea reached the area
the final phase of the evacuation was carried out late on friday and early saturday by fire and police department personnel with help from the hawaii national guard and public works teams county civil defence spokeswoman janet snyder told reuters by email
an estimated people live in the kapoho area but snyder said it was not immediately clear how many residents if any chose to stay behind
another people have already been evacuated from leilani estates an area further west where dozens of homes have been devoured or cut off by rivers of lava streaming over the landscape since may
for those whose homes have been unscathed the prolonged strain of uncertainty has grown increasingly difficult
we re waiting for pele to make the decision said steve kirkpatrick a retired mailman and resident of leilani estates referring to the volcano goddess of hawaiian myth
his home was still intact but in harm s way
you go for three weeks and you think everything is fine and then you can still lose your house kirkpatrick told reuters as he and his wife kathy ventured back to their community to help friends move out
as the lava expands so has the anxiety she said the low sound of lava spouting from the ground audible in the distance
lava was not the only challenge posed by the eruption
toxic sulphur dioxide gas emissions have created an additional hazard
so too have airborne volcanic glass fibres called pele s hair wispy strands produced by lava fountains and carried aloft by the wind
one resident nancy avery said the glass strands hurt like paper cuts slicing into her fingers and feet toes exposed because she wore only sandals
she tried to pick up a strand but it just kind of melted into my skin and cut me
it s so sharp it feels like the glass is still in the lava itself extruded from about two dozen fissures that opened on the slope of kilauea s eastern rift zone earlier this month has also knocked out telephone and power lines and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant
lava burnt two buildings at the plant a substation and a warehouse that stored a drilling rig officials said
the latest upheaval of kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes comes on the heels of an eruption cycle that began in and continued almost nonstop for years destroying more than dwellings and other structures
the current activity has been accompanied for weeks by daily explosions of gas and volcanic rock from kilauea s summit crater as well as earthquakes
but the summit has quieted down over the past few days as tons of rubble shaken loose from the interior walls of the crater have fallen into the void and plugged up the bottom of the vent
scientists are unsure whether the blockage will eventually end eruptions at the summit or lead to a buildup of pressure that could cause a much bigger explosion
