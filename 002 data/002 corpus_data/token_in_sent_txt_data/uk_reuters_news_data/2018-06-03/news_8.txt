american airlines warns of higher fares if oil remains high
sydney june reuters american airlines warned airline passengers may eventually face higher ticket prices if oil prices remain high prompting carriers to remove seats from the market
oil prices have risen around percent compared to the levels seen last year and that is putting pressure on airline profits
if it becomes clear this is the new normal you would see over time less capacity and growth in the industry and therefore higher prices but i don t think that s going to happen in the near term ceo doug parker told reporters on the sidelines of the annual iata meeting of airline executives in sydney reporting by victoria bryan editing by tim hepher
