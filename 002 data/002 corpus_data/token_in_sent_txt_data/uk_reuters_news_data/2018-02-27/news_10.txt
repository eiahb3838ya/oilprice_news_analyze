gabon accuses france's veolia of polluting amid concession dispute
libreville feb reuters gabon accused french environmental services group veolia on tuesday of widespread pollution at seeg the power and water utility it operates there amid a growing dispute over the company s concession
veolia which has already threatened legal action after the government seized seeg earlier this month and said it would cancel its concession rejected the accusations
speaking to reporters in the capital libreville government spokesman bilie by nze said an environmental inspection of power and water pumping stations discovered nearly all seeg sites were contaminated by petroleum waste
this is a very serious situation since at this stage aside from the obvious environmental damage no one knows the consequences this pollution could have had or could have on public health he said
he said that on top of legal penalties of up to million cfa francs for each polluted site gabon would force seeg to shoulder the costs
responding to the accusations veolia stated that the water it distributed continued to conform to world health organization standards and gabonese regulations
it is surprising that none of the inspections of the public authorities ever highlighted environmental damage it said
the seeg is subject to regular audits by the gabonese authorities more than in the last negotiations between the government and veolia over the concession broke down in october and authorities seized seeg earlier this month citing years of poor service quality
veolia in turn blamed the government for failing to live up to its investment obligations and on tuesday said the state owed seeg over billion cfa francs in consumption charges and unpaid tax reimbursements
gabon spokesman bilie by nze said the government had called for an audit of its billion cfa consumption bill
he rejected accusations it had neglected seeg and said the state had invested around trillion cfa francs in the company around three times more than veolia
