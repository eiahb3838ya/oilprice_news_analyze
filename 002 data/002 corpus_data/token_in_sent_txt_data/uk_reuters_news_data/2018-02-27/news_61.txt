basf predicts profit gain on specialty chems rebound
ludwigshafen germany feb reuters german chemicals maker basf said it was aiming for a gain of up to percent in group operating profit this year as an earnings rebound from specialty chemicals offsets declines at its basic petrochemicals unit
at its basic chemicals unit operating profit or earnings before interest and tax ebit adjusted for items would likely drop by percent or more in after a surge of percent in the fourth quarter the group said on tuesday
supply bottlenecks and strong demand across the petrochemicals industry have flung basf s commodities business into a surprise upward cycle last year
but basf and its rivals are busy ramping up output capacity which will likely bring down margins
