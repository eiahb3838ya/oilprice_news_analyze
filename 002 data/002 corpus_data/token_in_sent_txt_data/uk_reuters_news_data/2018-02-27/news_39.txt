graphic world fx rates in stocks set for third straight day of gains msci acwi on course for first monthly loss since oct dollar index down pct eyes on fed chair powell s first congressional testimony by ritvik carvalho london feb reuters world stocks held near highs on tuesday helped by a decline in borrowing costs ahead of federal reserve chairman jerome powell s first testimony before the united states congress later in the day
the msci world index was up percent by afternoon trade in europe
although it has recovered of its losses from a selloff earlier this month the index is set to break a streak of gains since donald trump won the elections in november

britain s ftse advanced percent
japan s nikkei rose percent to highs while msci s broadest index of shares outside japan also hit a high before giving up gains on in chinese shares
wall street was set for a lower open although falling bond yields helped the s p advance percent on monday
the treasuries yield eased to percent dropping further from its peak of percent touched on driven by buying as well as position adjustments ahead of powell s testimony
powell s debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the fed s policy normalisation following years of stimulus in the wake of the financial crisis almost a decade ago
many investors expect the fed to raise interest rates three times this year with some pundits predicting four if inflation starts to take off especially as growth is set to get another boost from the trump administration s tax cuts and spending plans
yet there are worries that higher dollar bond yields could prompt investors to shift funds to bonds from riskier assets especially when the valuation of the world s stocks are quite expensive even after their earlier this month
the treasuries yield was percent well above the dividend yield of the s p which stood at percent
the consensus view in the market is that powell will continue with a gradualist stance and deliver an upbeat view of us economic prospects said neil mackinnon economist at vtb capital research
the markets are already pricing in three basis points rate hikes with the first hike expected to be announced at the march fomc meeting
investors are alert to the possibility of a fourth hike this year though if powell emphasises the likelihood of this then markets might react fed funds rate futures were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the fed s next policy meeting on march
any talk of overheating or risks of an inflation overshoot could result in the money markets revising up estimates of where the terminal fed funds rate might end up in this cycle mackinnon said
a rise in dollar interest rates could also bode ill for potential borrowers including home buyers and many companies that have expanded borrowing for years to take advantage of low dollar funding costs
against a basket of currencies the dollar traded percent higher
elsewhere in currencies the euro was flat at off its high of hit earlier this month
oil edged lower ahead of weekly data that is forecast to show a rise in crude inventories although investor faith in opec s ability to curtail production helped stem a larger price slide
