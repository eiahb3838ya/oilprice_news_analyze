the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters hedge funds continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude and especially refined fuels in the most recently reported week but supportive comments from opec helped steady oil prices
hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by the equivalent of million barrels in the week to
the hedge funds net long position has been cut in each of the four most recent weeks by a total of million barrels in what has been the largest drawdown for more than seven months
most of the drawdown has come from the liquidation of bullish long positions rather than the establishment of new bearish short ones and it has been proportionately greater in fuels rather than crude
portfolio managers have cut their net long position in heating oil by million barrels european heating oil by million barrels and gasoline by million barrels since
over the same period the net long position in brent has been cut by million barrels while wti is down by million barrels
most of this liquidation seems to be attributable to after the big rally in oil prices over the last seven months
few fund managers have dared to initiate new short positions
short positions across the whole of the petroleum complex total just million barrels
short positions in nymex wti have fallen to just million barrels the lowest since july
fund positioning remains very stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of almost but down from almost at the end of january
despite the oil prices have steadied probably owing to a combination of strong consumption growth a continued fall in oil inventories and supportive comments from senior opec leaders
saudi arabia opec s de facto leader has confirmed that it intends to maintain production restraint throughout the remainder of even if that risks the market
if we have to err on the market a little it so be it
rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them the kingdom s energy minister said on
saudi officials have indicated they want to change the organisation s target for inventories from the average which is close to being achieved to something more ambitious
this represents a significant hardening of opec s policy and has partially reversed the recent slide in benchmark brent prices which was probably the intention
but with the market still looking very stretched especially on the crude side opec may need to sustain its verbal intervention to reassure investors and keep prices firm
