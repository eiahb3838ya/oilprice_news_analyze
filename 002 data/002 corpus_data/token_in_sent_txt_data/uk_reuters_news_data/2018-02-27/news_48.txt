german court rules in favour of city bans on diesel cars
leipzig germany reuters a top german court ruled on tuesday in favour of allowing major cities to ban heavily polluting diesel cars a move likely to hit the value of million vehicles in europe s largest car market and force carmakers to pay for costly modifications
there has been a global backlash against cars since volkswagen admitted in to cheating exhaust tests meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide nox known to cause respiratory disease
while other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars a ban in the birthplace of the modern automobile is a new blow for the car industry and an embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel s government which opposes bans
the ruling by the country s highest federal administrative court came after german states had appealed against bans imposed by local courts in stuttgart and duesseldorf in cases brought by environmental group duh over poor air quality
merkel s government which has come under fire for its close ties to the car industry had lobbied against a ban fearing it could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic in cities with public transport not in a position to take up the slack
