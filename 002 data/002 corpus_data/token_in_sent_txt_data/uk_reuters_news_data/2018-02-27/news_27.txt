update 2-time running out for brexit transition deal - eu negotiator
adds more quotes by gabriela baczynska and philip blenkinsop brussels feb reuters the european union s chief negotiator said britain was running out of time to agree a transitional deal with the european union on its departure from the bloc if it wanted to avoid a cliff edge brexit an exit with no divorce deal
michel barnier said there were significant points of disagreement on the transition period which the eu wants to end at the end of adding that london was looking to keep it
the eu wants a deal on britain s future relations with the bloc agreed by october so eu leaders can approve the whole deal at a summit and launch the ratification process in the remaining eu members
barnier said london was looking to keep it though british officials said their request had always been for a strictly adjustment period after brexit
britain is due to become the first country to leave the eu in march and failure to agree on transitional arrangements would rob firms of the clarity over trade and customs policies they need to make investment decisions
the clock is ticking time is going by we are pressed for time michel barnier told a news conference a day before presenting the remaining eu states with what said would be a draft legal agreement on brexit
i am worried by the time which is short between now and autumn
in a few months we will have to agree with the united kingdom about their orderly exit from the european union as they wish he said
his comments came as british trade minister liam fox said the opposition labour party s plan to stay in a customs union with the eu would leave britain in a worse position than now and would be a sellout of britain s national interests
for his part barnier stressed some areas have seen little or no progress since december listing outstanding issues around safeguarding the rights of citizens among others
he repeated that the eu would not accept during any transitional arrangements dismissing suggestions in london that britain could stick to eu rules in some areas diverge moderately in others and go its own way for the rest
we are responsible for the integrity of the single market barnier said
we can not accept the risk of regulatory divergence during the transition he said the eu would push ahead with contingency planning for the island of ireland for want of concrete ideas on how to reconcile britain s desire to leave the eu s single market and the customs union with pledges to avoid a hard border between the british province of northern ireland and eu member ireland
the eu s fallback option for ireland assumes full regulatory alignment would be kept between the two after brexit and barnier said his text on wednesday would propose workable solutions
