update 3-norway wealth fund to assess climate risks in power, oil, materials
oslo reuters norway s trillion sovereign wealth fund will this year step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers oil firms and basic materials companies its ceo told reuters on tuesday
separately the board of the central bank will soon decide whether to blacklist from the fund one or more companies either in the oil steel or concrete sectors for producing too much greenhouse gases the central bank chief told reuters
the fund which invests the proceeds from norway s oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks bonds and real estate abroad is one of the world s biggest shareholders with stakes totaling percent of all listed companies
in recent years the world s biggest sovereign wealth fund has become a more active shareholder trying to influence companies attitudes
among them are the way companies report on climate change such as their carbon dioxide emissions or whether companies have scenario analyses of how more heatwaves droughts or floods might affect their earnings
chief executive yngve slyngstad said the fund would first focus its efforts on electricity producers
that is the sector that we will first go through and think about in this scenario
the two next ones will be basic materials and by far the largest is electricity producers which of course has been a specific focus for us because of the coal criteria he said referring to the fund not being allowed by parliament to invest in firms that derive more than percent of their revenue from coal
the proposal to potentially exclude one or more companies in the oil steel or cement sectors over excessive greenhouse gas emissions is under review by the board of the central bank
we have received some recommendations on potential exclusions based on that new criteria
the board is working on the issues it s not going to be long central bank governor oeystein olsen said declining to give a more precise timeframe
the moves come as the fund is proposing to drop oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index which would reduce over time its stakes in oil and gas companies
that proposal is under consideration at the finance ministry and will be voted by parliament at a later stage
also on tuesday the fund said it doubled its return on investment in beating its benchmark as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio
it earned a return of percent in up from percent in
the fund s cumulative return since inception has passed billion norwegian crowns billion
one out of four crowns of return was generated in after a very strong year for the fund slyngstad said in a statement
again our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to the fund s biggest single company investment at the end of was in apple inc worth billion crowns ahead of nestle at billion and royal dutch shell at billion
apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund s returns in ahead of chinese tech group tencent holdings and microsoft
the fund s size is equivalent to for every norwegian man woman and child
the government withdrew billion crowns during to pay for public expenses compared with billion crowns in
slyngstad earned an annual salary of million crowns or roughly in while his chief investment officer for equity strategies petter johnsen earned more with million crowns
by comparison the country s prime minister erna solberg earned million crowns
