update 1-ecuador seeks to lure investors by expanding oil auction -minister
new throughout adds quotes context on the blocks to be offered by alexandra valencia quito feb reuters ecuador will increase the number of oil and gas areas it plans to offer in an auction next month by including mature crude fields and an offshore gas field oil minister carlos perez told reuters on tuesday
many latin american countries are trying to improve their offerings and contract rules to secure foreign investment amid intense regional competitions this year with major auctions expected in mexico brazil and uruguay
the minister said the amistad gas field in the guayaquil gulf will be added to the ecuadorian auction along with at least four mature or small onshore oil blocks that will be developed under service contracts with oil company petroamazonas
our goal is to attract investment and also look for an increase in production and reserves in the future perez told reuters in an interview before a public event to review the country s main oil achievements last year
amistad is the country s only gas producing field with an output of million cubic feet per day from six active wells according to official figures
the government has not yet decided the contract model for that area as new legislation for the gas industry is needed perez said
the mature onshore oilfields include the cuyabeno oso and areas at ecuador s amazon region perez said
those will be added to eight onshore areas in the country s northeast close to the border with colombia under the intracampos bidding round whose results are expected in august
ecuador which is opening to international markets tackling tax reform and austerity measures under the government of president lenin moreno has said it plans to increase crude production by barrels per day bpd this year by adding barrels from its itt block
it is switching to shared profit agreements from service contracts in the areas not operated by petroamazonas to secure more investments
the new terms will allow producers to be paid in oil and enable them to export or sell the barrels to local refineries
the andean country s crude output has fallen to bpd perez said below the output ceiling of bpd when opec agreed to restrain production starting last year
perez recently started talks with opec to be allowed to increase ecuador s production this year despite the organization s joint output cut agreement that is slated to run through the end of this year he added
ecuador s production is marginal in the opec context
it is a commitment with them to maintain opec s unity
we talked about it during the opec secretary general s visit earlier this month they are giving ecuador flexibility he said
