china urges regions to take responsibility after yangtze smog surge
beijing reuters china s regional governments need to take more responsibility for local pollution and stop blaming others a senior environmental official said on tuesday following increases in smog in the yangtze and pearl river delta regions in january
while nationwide air pollution fell thanks to a tough winter crackdown in northern regions concentrations of small breathable particles known as surged percent in the yangtze delta in eastern china which includes shanghai as well as the highly industrialised province of jiangsu
a increase in in the pearl river delta near hong kong also raised fears that polluting heavy industrial output had moved to eastern and southern regions as a result of a crackdown in the north which forced thousands of factories to curb production
speaking at a press briefing on tuesday liu bingjiang head of the air quality department at china s ministry of environmental protection mep said changes in industrial output could have been responsible for the spike noting that steel output data for indicated a shifting production structure and layout for industry
we will analyse more closely to see to what extent the rising is due to increasing industrial emissions he added
i am sure the yangtze delta governments understand very well what their tasks the top steel producing province of hebei which surrounds the capital beijing has been at the heart of a campaign to improve northern china s air quality and saw output fall percent to million tonnes last year despite a nationwide production increase
over the same period jiangsu the country s second biggest steel producer saw steel production rise percent to million tonnes in
it also saw nonferrous metals output surge percent according to official data
environmental group greenpeace said the increase in emissions in both the yangtze and pearl river deltas was caused by a rebound in polluting industries beginning in
but it also suggested that unfavourable weather conditions were partially to blame with the wind that helped cut smog in northern regions responsible for delivering pollution to the eastern coast
liu said at the tuesday briefing that favourable weather was responsible for percent of the improvements in air quality in northern china but it was irresponsible to blame smog on wind or on other regions
the local government should do its own job well and not focus on blaming other people he said
otherwise they will miss the best chance to improve their own air liu also said china was preparing to introduce even tougher air quality targets to cover the period without giving specific figures
