corrects last paragraph to state net crude oil imports fell below million barrels not total oil imports iea chief birol says could already overtake russia in birol says he does not see production peak before has already overtaken output of top exporter saudi arabia the shale revolution by osamu tsukimori tokyo feb reuters the united states will overtake russia as the world s biggest oil producer by at the latest the international energy agency iea said on tuesday as the country s shale oil boom continues to upend global markets
iea executive director fatih birol said in tokyo the united states would overtake russia as the biggest crude oil producer definitely next year if not this year
crude oil output rose above million barrels per day bpd late last year for the first time since the overtaking top oil exporter saudi arabia
the energy information administration said early this month that output would exceed million bpd by late
that would take it past top producer russia which pumps just below million bpd
birol separately told reuters he did not see oil production peaking before and that he did not see a decline in the next four to five years
the soaring production is upending global oil markets coming at a time when a group of other major producers around russia and the middle organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec have been voluntarily withholding output in order to prop up prices
oil is also increasingly being exported including to the world s biggest and fastest growing markets in asia eating away at opec and russian market share
meanwhile net imports of crude oil fell last week by million bpd to million bpd the lowest level since the eia started recording the data in further eroding a market opec has been relying on for decades
