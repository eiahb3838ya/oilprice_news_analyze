software may have helped daimler pass u.s. emissions tests - report
berlin reuters investigators probing mercedes maker daimler have found that its cars were equipped with software which may have help them to pass diesel emissions tests a german newspaper reported on sunday citing confidential documents
there has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles since volkswagen admitted in to installing secret software on vehicles that allowed them to emit up to times legally allowable emissions while meeting standards when tested by regulators
daimler which faces ongoing investigations by and german authorities into excess diesel emissions has said investigations could lead to significant penalties and recalls
the bild am sonntag newspaper said that the documents showed that investigators had found several software functions that helped daimler cars pass emissions tests including one which switched off emissions cleaning after km of driving
another function under scrutiny allowed the emissions cleaning system to recognise whether the car was being tested based on speed or acceleration patterns
bild am sonntag also cited emails from daimler engineers questioning whether these software functions were legal
a daimler spokesman declined to comment on the content of the documents saying the german company was fully cooperating with the authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the department of justice
the authorities know the documents and no complaint has been filed the spokesman said
the documents available to bild have obviously selectively been released in order to harm daimler and its reporting by edward taylor and emma thomasson editing by keith weir
