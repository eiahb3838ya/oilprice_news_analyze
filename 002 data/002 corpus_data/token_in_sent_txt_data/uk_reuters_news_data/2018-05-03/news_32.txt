qatar complains after citizen held in yemen
aden may reuters qatar has complained about the detention of one of its citizens in yemen in an incident that could further exacerbate doha s diplomatic rift with its gulf neighbours
qatar s national human rights committee condemned what it said was the april detention of mohsen saleh saadoun by a coalition that is fighting in yemen against the houthi movement that controls the capital
it said the man was in yemen visiting relatives there and was being held without charge by the coalition
yemeni security sources said yemen s own forces arrested the qatari man on the border with oman late last month on suspicion he was an intelligence officer working with the houthis
the military coalition fighting in yemen is made up of arab countries that have ostracised qatar which they accuse of supporting terrorism and being too friendly to their rival iran
qatar denies those charges
the countries have been fighting in yemen since against the houthis on behalf of the government of president abd rabbu mansour who lives in exile in riyadh
a representative of the military alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the qatari s arrest
