update 2-china bans new polluting projects in three cities - ministry
beijing reuters china has ordered three northern cities to stop approving new projects that would add to air pollution after they failed to meet air quality targets this past winter
the mayors of handan in hebei province and jincheng and yangquan in shanxi province were given the orders after being summoned to a meeting at the ministry of ecology and environment in beijing on thursday to account for their actions during a recent campaign against smog
the meeting came after the cities failed to meet targets to cut levels of hazardous breathable particles known as over the october to march period
reuters was the first foreign media organization allowed to attend such a meeting the ministry said
we will continue to fight against air pollution in the name of dignity and as our mission said handan s mayor wang litong who sat with the other mayors facing a line of eight environmental officials in a crowded meeting hall at the ministry
china launched a campaign last october to reduce average concentrations of by between percent in northern cities in an effort hit air quality targets
however though handan was ordered to reduce traffic cut industrial output and curb coal use in a bid to cut by percent over the period it only achieved an average reduction of percent
handan a major and city also saw average concentrations increase percent to micrograms per cubic meter in with one district experiencing a percent rise
wang the handan mayor said in a prepared speech that the city would make big sacrifices to tackle pollution
we will cut off our own hands to wage the battle he said
he said the city planned to close another tonnes of steelmaking capacity million tonnes of capacity and megawatts of power by august
he said three officials have been fired and given warnings
the three cities have been ordered to come up with a detailed plan to rectify the situation which they must submit to the environment ministry within days said liu changgen a ministry official
the major of jincheng liu feng said the major coal and gas city would rather sacrifice gdp growth in order to curb air pollution noting that jincheng s gross domestic product fell percent as a result of production curbs in the first quarter while investment slumped percent
after struggling for years to force local governments to toe the line china s environment ministry now has the authority to hold officials to account for failing to comply with pollution policies
the war on pollution is now a key performance indicator that could determine an official s promotion prospects and local authorities said last year that senior officials could even face dismissal if they failed to meet the winter targets
china has already held more than local government officials to account after they were found to have violated environmental rules during extensive nationwide inspections ordered by beijing beginning in
however while hundreds of officials were given official reprimands only a handful were actually fired or prosecuted
