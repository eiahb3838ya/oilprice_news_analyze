column-saudi arabia wants higher prices to kick oil addiction: kemp
london reuters saudi arabia s financial position has stabilised as a result of the increase in oil prices as well as efforts to raise revenues and trim government spending
but the country probably needs even higher prices and revenues in the next few years to pay for its ambitious transformation programme while maintaining internal stability
the kingdom s foreign reserves stood at billion at the end of march and have been basically stable for eight months after declining steadily for nearly three years
the government has introduced a tax and raised other fees and taxes to compensate for the decline in oil revenues during the slump and to diversify the revenue base
utility prices have been increased and some subsidies have been reduced to ease pressure on the budget and clean up the accounts of the oil company saudi aramco ahead of its planned share sale
but the biggest contribution to the improvement in the government s budget and the balance of payments position has come from rising oil prices
for a chartbook click here benchmark brent prices have risen by about a barrel or percent since hitting a cyclical low in january
as prices have risen the kingdom s drawdown on foreign reserves has eased and now stabilised according to data from the saudi arabian monetary authority monthly statistical bulletin sama march
the rise in oil revenues has provided fiscal breathing room and the international monetary fund has encouraged the government to slow the pace of tax increases and spending cuts
the government has announced big ambitions to transform the economy by diversifying away from oil and making it less dependent on state spending as part of its vision
in the meantime however the kingdom remains reliant on a single commodity to an unusual degree and almost the entire economy is linked to state spending
commodity exports account for percent of gdp and nearly all of this is crude oil lpg and refined products according to the united nations conference on trade and development
there was no reduction in the kingdom s dependence on oil exports between and despite repeated pledges about diversification state of commodity dependence unctad
in turn oil revenues support an enormous number of government jobs
the kingdom depends far more on public employment than most other countries
public sector jobs account for nearly percent of all employment and the wage bill alone absorbs percent of gdp according to the international monetary fund
real gross domestic product declined by percent in the first annual decrease since according to the imf regional economic outlook middle east imf may
the decline was because of a combination of lower oil production and the adverse impact of fiscal austerity on the rest of the economy
the government wants to shift the focus of the economy towards the private sector but the transition will require enormous investment even assuming it is eventually possible
economic transformation will need hundreds of billions of dollars and financing can come only from the kingdom s internal resources or in the form of foreign loans equity sales or direct investment
the crown prince s recent extended tour of the united states and europe was intended partly as a roadshow to encourage foreign investment and partly to cement alliances
but foreign investment on its own is unlikely to be enough given the scale of the task and lingering concerns about the kingdom s political direction and business environment
so the country will need to find hundreds of billions of dollars from its own resources to complete the transformation programme and smooth the difficult transition
official foreign assets amount to almost billion and there are more held in various other government funds
but the kingdom needs to maintain a large cushion of liquid assets to ensure confidence in its fixed exchange rate against the dollar
asset confiscations from wealthy saudis and the nationalisation of domestic companies could raise extra funding but risk damaging investor confidence so the potential for such measures is limited
as a result the kingdom badly needs to maximise oil revenues now to pay for the transition to a less economy in future
ironically the desire to move away from petroleum dependence has made the kingdom even more reliant on oil in the short term
and the urgency of the reform process has turned it into the most hawkish member of opec on prices
revenue requirements explain why the kingdom s price policy has developed a clear upward tilt and why policymakers want to maintain opec production curbs for as long as possible
