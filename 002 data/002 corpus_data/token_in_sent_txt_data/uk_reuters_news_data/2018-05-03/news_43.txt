their growth more than offset delays that are expected to shift a substantial portion of our agriculture earnings to the second the chemical giant said overall sales volumes fell percent but prices rose percent on a comparable basis
the materials science unit which makes chemicals that go into making everything from cosmetics to packaging material to brake fluids saw sales rise percent on the back of a percent rise in volumes

the two divisions offset a slide of percent in the agriculture division
