explainer-u.s. risks reversing iran nuclear deal's inspection gains
graphic map of iran nuclear facilities by francois murphy vienna may reuters the landmark nuclear deal iran made with major world powers slashed the scope of tehran s atomic activities and created what the united nations nuclear watchdog calls the world s most robust verification but president donald trump a critic of the deal has threatened to pull out unless a agreement is reached to fix what he calls the deal s here is what a withdrawal would likely mean for the s nuclear watchdog and its policing of iran s nuclear activities
a central aim of the agreement signed by the united states russia china germany france and britain was to ensure iran would be at least a year away from amassing enough nuclear material for a bomb
the deal made tehran among other things sharply cut the number of centrifuges machines that enrich uranium it has in operation and slash its stock of enriched uranium
it also imposes a strict limit on the purity iran enriches uranium to far below the level at which it could be used in atom bombs
in signing the deal iran also agreed to comprehensive monitoring of its nuclear facilities and related sites by the s international atomic energy agency
that includes daily access by inspectors to and continuous monitoring such as by camera feed of its two underground enrichment sites at natanz and fordow
the deal requires iran to implement the nuclear watchdog s additional protocol which provides inspectors with access to information on iran s nuclear activities and the ability to inspect any site it deems necessary to verify that those activities are peaceful
the deal officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa requires iran to grant visas and provide proper working spaces to to designated nuclear inspectors
no
inspectors must present to tehran their reason for wanting to visit a site that iran has not declared as part of its nuclear programme
the nuclear watchdog does often conduct snap inspections
the head of the watchdog in march said that since the jcpoa has gone into effect the agency has carried out more than complementary access inspections
many of those are done at short notice diplomats familiar with the agency s work say
the agency says it has had access to all the sites it has needed to visit and details of inspections are confidential
iran and the nuclear watchdog say iran is implementing its commitments under the deal
if trump does not renew waivers of sanctions against iran by may as he has threatened to it could unravel the deal by removing one of the main reasons tehran signed up in the first place
according to the text of the deal iran stated that if sanctions were reinstated it will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this jcpoa in whole or in the three european signatories and the european union which also signed the deal hope to keep the agreement alive even if the united states pulls out
iran s president has warned there would be severe consequences if trump pulled out of the deal
but iran has also discussed salvaging the deal
if iran pulled out of the deal completely it would dramatically reduce the nuclear watchdog s ability to monitor the country s activities
the agency says its presence in iran in terms of inspectors calendar days doubled to in compared to
it adds that its verification activities conducted have increased percent over that time frame without specifying total numbers
inspectors would still monitor iran s declared nuclear facilities because tehran is a signatory to the nuclear treaty
but inspectors would no longer have daily access to the fordow and natanz sites for example and would have more limited oversight of areas including uranium mining and research without nuclear material
some iranian officials have even threatened to withdraw from the treaty a drastic move that would involve expelling inspectors altogether as north korea did in
if iran did pull out of the deal the nuclear watchdog would hope that tehran would continue to apply the protocol allowing it to retain much of its power to inspect any undeclared site it needs to
there is a precedent for this even though iran has not ratified the additional protocol since it signed it in iran implemented it temporarily from to
