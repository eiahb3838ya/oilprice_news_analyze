feature-campaigners fear latin america is rolling back on eco-farming promises
rome may thomson reuters foundation the world map beamed on a large display screen shows a stark contrast between latin america where dark colours cover most of the continent and the rest of the world where there are few
this map s focus is nations that have laws and policies supporting techniques a practice known as agroecology
fewer than countries worldwide have such laws and more than half of those that do are in latin america
but in practice campaigners told the thomson reuters foundation some latin american governments are ignoring these laws and policies while brazil is accused of rolling them back
that threatens the environment and cumulatively the livelihoods of tens of thousands of farmers they said
for the last three years we have been losing resources to sustain agroecology policies said maria noel salgado a uruguayan farmer and coordinator with the agroecological movement of latin america and the caribbean maela a network of indigenous people and farmers and fishermen
the laws are there but there are no resources
we now have a lot of governments who only believe in the power of markets and biotechnology she added referring to the rise of conservative leaders across the region
agroecology as its name implies shuns chemical inputs
instead it uses methods such as planting trees on farms and rotating crops to improve the soil and protect against pests
its proponents say it can provide more nutritious and food for a growing world increase farmers earnings and make farms resilient to climate change
there is growing evidence that these systems keep carbon in the ground support biodiversity rebuild soil fertility and sustain yields over time providing a basis for secure farm livelihoods said a report by the international panel of experts on sustainable food systems
the world map showing latin america apparently leading the way was the centrepiece at an international meeting on agroecology in early april organised by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao
the laws and policies that are now in place in the region are the result of decades of campaigning by farmers and campaigners angela cordeiro a brazilian agronomist told the thomson reuters foundation at the meeting
despite the fact that we have a very strong agribusiness sector in brazil civil society and social movements managed to influence some laws cordeiro said
ross mary borja director of charity ekorural said her country s progressive laws were due to pressure its constitution which includes specific rights for nature was a result of constant campaigning by groups including hers
both brazil and nicaragua have laws and policies on agroecology and organic production for example while el salvador is considering a similar approach
brazil for instance stipulates that percent of food for its programme must come from family farms which earn a premium if they use agroecology
and in december the community of latin american and caribbean states celac an intergovernmental grouping of countries agreed to strengthen policies that contribute to the development of agroecological family farming
that said countries implementation of laws that support agroecology and sustainable agriculture has been uneven said le coq of the french agricultural research centre for development cirad a french government agency
nicaragua has not implemented its agroecology law at the grassroots level for example and costa rica has only partly implemented its law to promote organic agriculture said le coq whose organisation in studied how agroecology is practised in eight latin american countries
another problem campaigners said is the gap between what is in the law and what happens on the ground
despite ecuador s constitutional protection for nature for example its biodiversity is under threat from industrial agriculture oil exploration mining and poverty they said
there are other gaps too said stephen sherwood borja s colleague at ekorural and an organic farmer
instead of promoting cheaper and proven solutions such as using crop residues to improve soil and means of pest control ecuador s government offers farmers free synthetic fertilisers and pesticides he said
borja said the government s motives were flawed
the government thinks small farmers are inefficient so the way to help them is through these giveaways said borja
ecuador s agriculture ministry did not respond to requests for comment
borja said support for family farmers to follow an path is key given that they produce to percent of food consumed in ecuador
that holds true elsewhere too fao figures show smallholders in asia and africa provide up to percent of the food supply
meanwhile in brazil the national policy on agroecology is in limbo said cordeiro and austerity measures are affecting the food acquisition program a public procurement programme based on buying produce from local family farmers
a change in government has caused support for agroecology to wane she added
in a statement brazil s ministry of agriculture acknowledged government purchases had suffered budget cuts but insisted its commitments to agroecology were concrete and said the national policy had been in force since its publication in
changes in governments dominance of industrial agriculture and the power of agrochemical businesses play a role in the challenges agroecology is facing in latin america but there is hope said cirad s le coq who is based in colombia
although agroecology remains many policies are in place he said and there is growing recognition it could help to solve the region environmental and social challenges
