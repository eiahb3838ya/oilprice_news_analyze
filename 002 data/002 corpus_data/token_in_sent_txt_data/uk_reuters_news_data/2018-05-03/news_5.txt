new york power grid expects demand to decline through 2028
may reuters new york s power grid operator on thursday forecast that demand for power from the system will decline over the next decade due to efficiency programs and as more homes and businesses generate their own electricity on site
the new york independent system operator nyiso the grid operator projected power demand would decline at a rate of percent per year through
annual electric usage in fell to its lowest level since according to the nyiso
in demand peaked at megawatts mw which was percent below s peak of mw and percent below the record peak of in
one megawatt can power about homes
at the same time that demand for power from the grid is declining the nyiso said the state s generation mix is changing as energy companies build mostly natural units downstate and mostly wind farms update while coal and nuclear plants retire
since nearly mw of generation has retired leaving just mw in and those units are expected to shut or be repowered into units in due to state carbon dioxide emission restrictions the nyiso said
the two reactors at entergy corp s indian point nuclear power plant in westchester county north of new york city will shut in and under a deal between the company and the state
the nyiso said the grid will remain reliable after the units shut as new sources of mostly generation enter service
the nyiso said it expects about mw of renewable generation to enter service over the next decade or so to help meet the state s goal requiring percent of the energy consumed come from renewable sources by
in renewable sources of generation like hydro wind and solar power accounted for about percent of the energy produced in the state
with all the changes expected the nyiso said it will have to use price signals to reward flexible units like gas plants that can also burn oil for times when gas or renewable sources of generation may not be available as can happen on the coldest winter days when consumers use most of the available gas to heat their homes and businesses
