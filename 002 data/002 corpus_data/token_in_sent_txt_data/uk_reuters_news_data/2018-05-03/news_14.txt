it could cost up to nz billion billion to fulfil new zealand s obligations by under the paris climate change agreement which seeks to limit global temperature rises said david woods of a new board to develop impact investing
if you had to fund that out of the tax base it would be pretty substantial said wood deputy head of the national advisory board nab on impact investing which was set up last month to steer strategy and governance of the emerging market
