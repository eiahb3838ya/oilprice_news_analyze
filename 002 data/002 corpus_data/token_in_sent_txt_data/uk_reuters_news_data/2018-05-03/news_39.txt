analysis-oil-rich nigeria turns to renewable energy as population booms
london may thomson reuters foundation faced with a population boom that has sent carbon emissions soaring and stretched power supplies to breaking point nigeria is turning to renewable energy in a big way
africa s most populous country needs more than times its current electricity output to guarantee supply for its million people nearly half of whom have no access at all according to power minister babatunde fashola
campaigners welcome the shift to renewables as an efficient way to bring power to rural communities and help clean up a country with some of the world s worst urban pollution rates
ready access to electricity will reduce youth unemployment and increase productivity ifeoma malo nigeria country director at the global campaign group power for all told the thomson reuters foundation
it will contribute greatly to reducing the carbon footprint of a growing energy demand by the urban nigeria has set a target of expanding electricity access to percent of the population by and percent by
it aims to generate percent of its total energy from renewable sources by fashola said in a recent speech in london a major commitment for an economy that depends heavily on fossil fuels
oil and gas production account for around percent of nigeria s gross domestic product and about percent of total exports revenue according to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec
over the past year the country has invested more than billion in solar power projects seeking to boost the capacity of the national grid and reduce reliance on it by building in rural areas without mains electricity
just one in four people in rural nigeria is connected to the national grid adding to a trend of outward migration that is piling pressure on nigeria s already overburdened cities
power demand in nigeria s largest city lagos vastly outstrips supply meaning its million residents must either go without or rely on expensive generators
in january the country suffered six power outages in just eight days as the national grid repeatedly collapsed under the strain plunging most of the country into darkness
urbanisation and rapid population growth will only add to the problem nigeria s population is projected to swell from to million by and more and more people are moving to its cities
by the start of demand for energy is forecast to be more than double its early levels
nigeria currently has the capacity to produce an estimated megawatts mw of power but due to weak infrastructure gas supply problems and water shortages only about mw reaches the national grid according to fashola
the government is investing in hydropower with several projects close to completion
the largest is the mambilla power station in central nigeria a billion project due to be completed in with most of the financing coming from chinese lenders
it will be able to generate mw of renewable energy in the rural region and is scheduled to be completed in
given the country s climate though most of the focus is on generating solar power
a million world bank loan will be used to build by in rural areas bringing power to hospitals schools and households said damilola ogunbiyi managing director of the rural electrification agency
one of these projects sabon gari aims to generate between mw of solar energy for small and enterprises smes in nigeria s second largest city kano by the end of the year
the chief executive of the energy company behind the project rensource said companies energy costs had fallen at least percent since they started using the solar grids
up until now the entire market has been powered by a network of dirty unhealthy generators that are also quite expensive ademola adesina told the thomson reuters foundation in a telephone interview
we are replacing those generators with a network of solar hybrid systems that are powering the entire rensource hopes to expand to rural areas where the world bank estimates million nigerians live without electricity
power for all s malo said projects such as these offered the best chance of bringing power to remote areas
the rural electrification agency realises that the traditional grid extension system will not meet the demands of the growing population he said
