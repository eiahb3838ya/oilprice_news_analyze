update 2-iran says will not renegotiate nuclear deal, warns against changes
ankara reuters iran s foreign minister said on thursday demands to change its nuclear agreement with world powers were unacceptable as a deadline set by president donald trump for europeans to fix the deal loomed
trump has warned that unless european allies rectify the terrible flaws in the international accord by may he will refuse to extend sanctions relief for the islamic republic
iran will not renegotiate what was agreed years ago and has been implemented foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said in a video message posted on youtube
britain france and germany remain committed to the accord as is but now in efforts to keep washington in it want to open talks on iran s ballistic missile programme its nuclear activities beyond when key provisions of the deal expire and its role in middle east crises such as syria and yemen
a senior adviser to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also warned europeans on thursday over revising the nuclear deal under which iran strictly limited its enrichment of uranium to help allay fears this could be put to producing atomic bomb material and won major sanctions relief in return
even if allies especially the europeans try to revise the deal one of our options will be withdrawing from it state television quoted ali akbar velayati as saying
the european signatories to the deal have been trying to persuade trump to save the pact reached under his predecessor barack obama
they argue it is crucial to forestalling a destabilising middle east arms race and that iran has been abiding by its terms a position also taken by intelligence assessments and the nuclear watchdog agency
zarif said let me make it absolutely clear and once and for all we will neither outsource our security nor will we renegotiate or add onto a deal we have already implemented in good referring to trump s past as a property magnate zarif added to put it in real estate terms when you buy a house and move your family in or demolish it to build a skyscraper you can not come back two years later and renegotiate the defying western demands iran has repeatedly said it has no intention of reducing its imprint in middle east affairs and its missile capabilities which it has said are defensive in nature and have nothing to with nuclear activity covered by the deal
it now appears that some europeans have been offering more concessions from our pocket zarif said
this appeasement of trump entails a new deal that would include matters we all decided to exclude at the outset of our zarif speaking in english in the youtube video said the united states had consistently violated the nuclear deal particularly by bullying others to prevent businesses from returning to iran
major european banks and businesses continue to shun the islamic republic for fear of falling foul of remaining sanctions hampering iran s efforts to rebuild foreign trade and lure foreign investment to its economy
