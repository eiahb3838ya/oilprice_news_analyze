update 3-pennsylvania regulators allow etp mariner east 1 liquids pipe to restart
adds fine on mariner east in paragraph may reuters the pennsylvania public utility commission puc said on thursday that all five commissioners voted to allow energy transfer partners lp to restart its sunoco mariner east natural gas liquids pipeline
the puc suspended operations on mariner east on march after sinkholes were discovered near the project
after testing the integrity of the pipeline etp filed with the puc on april to restart the pipe
the puc s bureau of investigations and enforcement which recommended the pipe be shut in march concurred with etp s restart request
when mariner east was shut in as a precautionary measure there were no issues with the pipeline which has been safely operating for decades
its continued safe operation has now been verified etp spokeswoman lisa dillinger said in an email noting the company will begin the procedures to restart the pipeline immediately
the shutdown forced shippers including gas producers range resources corp and antero resources corp to find another route for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be injected into the region s natural gas pipelines according to analysts
mariner east which started service in the transporting refined products from the philadelphia area to western pennsylvania was repurposed and expanded to transport propane in and ethane in from western pennsylvania shale fields to customers in the state and elsewhere including international exports from etp s marcus hook complex near philadelphia
separately etp is building the billion mariner east pipeline which will boost total capacity of the mariner east project from barrels per day bpd to bpd and open the pipe to suppliers in ohio and west virginia
on thursday pennsylvania environmental regulators said they levied a penalty on mariner east for violations of the clean streams law that occurred between may and
that penalty is in addition to the million penalty levied against the company in february for separate violations
since may mariner east has received notices of violation from pennsylvania regulators due in part to inadvertent returns or spills
delays related to those spills among other things have pushed the expected startup of mariner east from the third quarter of to the end of the second quarter of
some analysts however have said they do not expect mariner east to enter service until the third quarter
