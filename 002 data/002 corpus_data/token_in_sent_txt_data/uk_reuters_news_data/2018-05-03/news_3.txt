update 2-venezuela's maduro defies foreign censure, offers 'prize' to voters
caracas reuters president nicolas maduro scoffed at international criticism of venezuela s upcoming may vote in which he is seeking and offered a prize for those who vote with a card
venezuela s mainstream opposition is boycotting the election on the grounds it is rigged in favour of the socialist incumbent
the united states european union and various latin american neighbours have also slammed it as unfair
so they re not going to recognise maduro around the world
what the hell do i care maduro said at an election rally in la guaira on the coast outside caracas late on wednesday
what the hell do i care what europe and washington say maduro who is casting his campaign as a battle against imperialist powers bent on seizing venezuela s oil wealth has only one serious rival henri falcon a former state governor
falcon has broken with the opposition coalition s boycott of the vote believing anger over an economic crisis will win him votes
opec member venezuela is in a fifth year of punishing recession inflation is the highest in the world oil production is at a low shortages of food and medicines are widespread and millions are skipping meals
some polls show falcon more popular than maduro who narrowly won election to replace hugo chavez in
but the opposition abstention campaign the presence of maduro loyalists in key institutions including the election board and power of state welfare programs like housing and food giveaways makes a falcon victory look a tall order
in his speech maduro told supporters that all those who vote showing a fatherland card which is needed to access certain welfare programs probably would receive a really good he did not give details but critics say that and other cash and other bonuses via the card is akin to vote bribery

capriles and another popular opposition leader leopoldo lopez are both barred from standing in the election
maduro says venezuela s election system is the cleanest in the world
but even the official operator of the voting platform smartmatic denounced fraud in an election last august
little is known about the argentine company that has replaced it for this month s election
if maduro does win attention will turn immediately to whether he plans to use the political breathing space to deepen an internal purge of rivals and if the united states will carry out a threat to impose oil sanctions
president donald trump s administration already has imposed some financial and individual sanctions on maduro s government accusing senior officials of rights abuses and corruption
opposition activists have been stepping up their campaign in recent days with scattered protests around the country
numbers however have been thin a far cry from the mass protests of
the mainstream opposition democratic unity coalition said falcon and others participating in the may vote were simply helping maduro legitimize a farcical process
we urge all citizens to not participate in this fraudulent election and to leave the streets empty in expression of our repudiation of the maduro regime it said in a statement
