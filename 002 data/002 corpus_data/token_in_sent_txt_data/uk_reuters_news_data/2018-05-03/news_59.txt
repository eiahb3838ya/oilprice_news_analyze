feature-urban nomads: mongolian herders battle new future as leave the land for the city
ulaanbaatar may thomson reuters foundation with about sheep and goats jugder samdan makes just enough to scrape by as a nomadic herder in mongolia basking in the sun as he watches over his animals but he worries about the future
samdan has seen major changes during his plus years on the vast grassland or steppe in central mongolia s arkhangai province with shifts in politics and society impacting one of the world s last remaining nomadic cultures
but what most concerns samdan and fellow herders is climate change as droughts harsh winters and threaten traditional livelihoods and drives younger people to the capital fuelling pollution crime and mental illness
everybody moves to the city samdan told the thomson reuters foundation wrapped in a felt jacket outside his ger a traditional white circular herder s tent or yurt made of felt
there are too many people about one quarter of mongolians still live a traditional nomadic life in the central asian country sandwiched between russia and china which has four times the land mass of germany but is with about three million people
but life is changing fast and about herders a year have moved to the city since according to ulaanbaatar s deputy mayor batbayasgalan jantsan setting up sprawling informal ger districts lacking facilities like water and power
the population of ulaanbaatar has almost doubled in the last years to million people according to the mongolian national statistics office with about percent of the city s population or people living in ger districts
that s almost an entire province said jantsan in an interview in his office in central ulaanbaatar a city shrouded in a dense smog during winter months due to air pollution
as winter temperatures can drop below minus celsius minus fahrenheit ger dwellers burn raw coal to stay warm driving pollution levels eight to times higher than global guidelines according to the world health organisation who
air pollution is estimated by the who to cause more than deaths a year in mongolia and is now one of the nation s most challenging issues with the burning of coal accounting for percent of air pollution from november to april
it s a threat to national security said jantsan
bazarragchaa altantsetseg a land use specialist at land consultancy vector maps llc said dwellings were traditionally designed to move in mongolia and it was not after soviet control in that fixed properties became more prevalent
the russians also had a major impact on herding
the state owned the nation s herd and grazing land with herders paid a wage for working in collective farms
the herd wsa kept at about million in line with land capacity assessments
but that changed after mongolia became a parliamentary democracy in and privatisation followed prompting a surge in numbers with the herd hitting million in according to the food and agriculture organization fao
since everything was chaos everyone wanted to have the land and animals altantsetseg said
some herders have welcomed the new system
the conditions are fair for everyone
compared to the previous regime you can work hard to have a better life you can grow your herd and get a car samdan said
but the dramatic increase in the herd has brought problems of exacerbated by desertification as witnessed by samdan s daughter altantsetseg jugdur aged in her
when i was a child you couldn t see the animals in the grass
now look at what we have
only dust and soil she said
herders accounts of climate change are backed by data with a report from japan s ministry of the environment stating mongolia s annual mean temperature rose by percent between and with drier weather leading to more dust storms
the report also highlighted an increasing frequency of cold and snow damage from dzuds since the early the name for a severe winter that comes after a summer drought
if there is grass beneath the snow then the animals will survive
when there is no grass beneath the snow then it is dzud explained herder altangerel dolgor
mongolia s recent winter killed more than livestock left weak after a drought last year the highest toll since according to the country s statistics bureau
the steppe around tuvshruulekh is littered with animals that have frozen to death
stray dogs and groups of vultures dot the landscape scavenging the frozen carcasses
samdan said he can read the signs of climate change around him
lizards are appearing for the first time while some plants are disappearing including those used in traditional medicines
before we used to have a leaf which we would boil and drink for stomach problems
now i can t find it anymore he said
but it is not just the damage to livestock and the land concerning herders but social changes
bayarmaa vanchindorj deputy director of the national mental health centre said there has been rising numbers of cases of addiction depression trafficking and sexual abuse of children
thousands of mongolians protested in front of parliament in ulaanbaatar in march to demand more action to prevent child abuse after the rape of a young boy
mongolians for many centuries roamed unlimited spaces of their own free will
so i think urbanisation took its toll on people s minds she said
narantuya nijir is one example
she lost all her livestock in a dzud and now lives in a ger in her landlord s yard at the edge of ulaanbaatar where the city meets the open pasture
it s quite difficult living in someone else s yard
even when they don t give us a hard time we worry a lot she said
up the road lives samdan s son chudur with his young family
he has adapted to city life better having bought a small plot of land where he has just built a small house in the process learning the skills to start a small business
back on the steppe samdan concedes herding is a tough life but his pleas for young people to stay go unheeded
his grandson tsendmandakh altantsetseg has no romantic view of the traditional nomadic life
nature is changing
the grasslands are turning into deserts
rivers and streams are disappearing he said
i m planning to go to university in the city after i graduate
i ll follow my profession work in the city and build a life reporting by max baring editing by belinda goldsmith
