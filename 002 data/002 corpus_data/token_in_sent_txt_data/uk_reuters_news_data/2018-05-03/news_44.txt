in u.s. gulf, robots, drones take on dangerous offshore oil work
houston reuters at bp s massive thunder horse oil platform in the gulf of mexico a robot called maggie uses magnetic tracks to creep along pipes connecting the giant oil facility to the sea floor
before magghd dubbed maggie by bp the dangerous inspection job was reserved for highly paid specialist technicians who did their jobs while rappelling along the platform
the energy industry has turned to robots and drones to cut costs and improve safety in some of the world s tougher working environments
drones inspect gear high up on floating rigs
robots crawl underwater to test subsea equipment for microscopic metal cracks
remotely operated mini submarines can replace divers
big oil producers such as bp and statoil are racing to create the oilfields of the future where smart devices replace workers
they have the potential to cut costs save lives and reduce the scope for human error
this is going to change the way oil and gas does business carri lockhart senior vice president of offshore at statoil usa said in an interview earlier this year referring to the push towards autonomous gear and facilities
maggie belongs to a group of devices known as magnetic crawlers which can move across rigs platforms and pipelines above and below water using ultrasonic test devices and cameras
they can cost pounds apiece
bp the largest operator in the gulf of mexico piloted maggie on its thunder horse platform last year and expects to roll out similar crawlers across all its gulf of mexico platforms in coming years
bp s deepwater horizon rig explosion in the gulf of mexico which killed people and was the largest accidental release of oil into marine waters underscored the dangers of offshore work
bp wants the robots to remove individuals from being in unsafe environments
the efficiencies we gain by collecting data this way are significant
the safety factor is obvious said dave truch a technology director in bp s digital innovation organization
drones and crawlers can do inspections in about half the time of rope access technicians while placing fewer workers in harm s way executives at bp said this week
other gadgets can reduce the need for shutdowns which are sometimes necessary for safe inspection of equipment by humans
drones can conduct inspections of flaring equipment which burn off dangerous gases at oil and gas production facilities without requiring a shutdown
those shutdowns could last anywhere from five to days said iain gault a business development manager at stork an energy maintenance unit of fluor we still can t do the physical work with a drone or crawler but the efficiency is gained by only putting people in the field when needed said gault who started his career in oil and gas as a rope access technician rappelling along the sides of oil structures in the north sea nearly years ago
the technology can be a hard sell because of the high upfront cost he added estimating crawler rentals run between to per day excluding the cost of an operating technician
hiring technicians for drones is even more costly because they require pilot s licenses he added
companies that provide the inspection specialists for offshore equipment say they are not worried about losing out to robots and gadgets
it is not a threat to jobs but they change
we have to adapt said ryan king a technical sales representative for oceaneering international an offshore services and equipment provider
we re at a point now where big data is helping optimise inspection programs so we don t have to send guys into the field king said
drones and crawlers may be a stepping stone
norwegian oil producer statoil is eying an unmanned remotely operated production concept
noble drilling and general electric co this year launched a partnership to produce a fully digitised drilling vessel work the companies said paves the way for an autonomous drilling fleet
we have the technology
it s just a matter of getting these projects executed
we re not there yet on unmanned platforms for deepwater but it s coming said statoil s lockhart
