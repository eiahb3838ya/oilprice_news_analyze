global markets-resurgent dollar sends commodities and emerging markets reeling again
dollar surge resumes index hits new high turkish lira extends bounce but many early gains fizzle stronger dollar pressures commodities copper gold oil slide indonesia raises rates for fourth time since may world stocks down half percent em stocks slump percent updates throughout by sujata rao london aug reuters the dollar resumed its rise on wednesday surging to new highs and upping pressure on commodities emerging markets and global stocks though the turkish lira managed out to eke out a second day of gains
wall street futures pointed to a sharply lower opening
the lira a big focus for markets in recent days bounced as much as percent as authorities tightened the screws on foreign investors aiming to short the currency
but having firmed beyond per dollar most of its early gains fizzled out
the rebound follows a drop over the past month and fears remain that turkey is headed for crisis and debt defaults
failure to tackle galloping inflation and ankara s diplomatic tiff with washington is also keeping investors wary
attention has turned once again to the dollar which opened wednesday flat but then strengthened percent against a basket of currencies
it is now up more than percent this year
the dominant theme in financial markets at the moment is the strength of the dollar aviva investors head of funds sunil krishnan said
we see scope for that move to one of the big challenges to risk appetite in markets is if the dollar moves continue and put pressure on riskier assets such as emerging market bonds and so on he said
krishnan saw the lira bounce as fragile noting turkey needed concrete policy action to improve fundamentals and also some improvement in relations with the united as the dollar rise hit commodities european stocks fell half a percent
copper prices hit lows gold slipped to lows and brent crude fell almost per barrel
the latest copper slide with futures down percent came after a chilean mineworkers strike was averted
msci s equity benchmark fell half a percent though it stayed off lows reached on monday
the lira collapse and dollar strength are driving a capital exodus from across emerging markets sending currencies such as the argentine peso and indian rupee to record lows
emerging equities fell percent and are down almost percent from january highs
there are concerns also about china s slowing economy reinforced by this week s data on investment and industrial output and the yuan s weakening to lows against the dollar
that is also pressuring other asian markets
indonesia acting after the rupiah fell to lows raised interest rates for the fourth time since may
the backdrop to all this is the escalation in global trade tensions with beijing now lodging a complaint to the world trade organisation to determine the legality of tariff and subsidy policies
turkey has also raised tariffs on some products in response to the administration s deliberate attacks on our economy vice president fuat oktay wrote on twitter
brokerage fxtm s global head of currency strategy jameel ahmad said the tensions reminded investors that it is not just the united states and china that stand at the heart of the global trade war concerns
there are signs the negative newsflow is starting to affect wall street which has so far drawn support from robust company earnings
the fears are reflected in the skew index a gauge of the cost of put options on the s index relative to calls
a put option confers the right to sell an asset at price while a call offers right to buy
the skew has risen this week to the highest since march
a rise in skew indicates higher demand for protection against market falls
s futures slipped percent while futures on the nasdaq index fell percent
trade and tighter central bank policy were stock market headwinds according to aviva s krishnan who reckons the issues need to be better discounted in terms of market pricing
it s something investors need to come to terms with in coming all those concerns have driven investors to embrace more stable assets
aside from the dollar that includes german and government bonds the japanese yen and swiss franc
german and yields are down more basis points this month
the strong dollar s biggest victims are emerging currencies but its rise is also pummelling the euro and sterling
the single currency slipped a further percent to a new low versus the dollar and also extended losses against the swiss franc
sterling tumbled to below for the first time since june having lost ground for days in a row the longest losing streak since
