feature-marked for demolition? ugandans on pipeline route fear land loss
hoima uganda aug thomson reuters foundation ugandan farmer james mubona looked pensive as he sat in a blue plastic chair under a mango tree next to three of his four wives one breastfeeding a baby contemplating the imminent loss of his farm to an oil pipeline
the government is set to take about half of the land which feeds mubona s children and numerous grandchildren to build the world s longest electrically heated oil pipeline from northwest uganda to tanzania s tanga port on the indian ocean
i am worried because i don t know where to go when this land is taken mubona told the thomson reuters foundation from kyakatemba village in hoima district a poor region along uganda s western border with the democratic republic of congo
when the pipeline takes a bigger portion of your land and you remain with a small portion what do you do with that small portion uganda discovered crude reserves estimated by government geologists at billion barrels in the albertine rift basin more than years ago
the east african country aims to refine crude oil domestically and export some via a pipeline through neighbouring tanzania by
an energy ministry official told mubona that a chunk of his land will be used to run a wide pipeline road and power line from the refinery to the sea
uganda signed an agreement in april with a consortium including a subsidiary of general electric to build and operate a refinery that will cost up to billion the president s office said
yusuf masaba a spokesman for uganda s energy ministry said the entire pipeline route had been mapped out and plans to compensate and resettle people were at an advanced stage
once the government valuer is done with valuation then compensation will be done
i can not say when they will be compensated masaba told the thomson reuters foundation
we are not going to break people s homes to pass the line
there are no settlements in the areas that the pipeline is going to pass he said emphasising that the government is only going to acquire farmland not houses
mubona will not be the first ugandan to lose land to the oil project which the government hopes will spur economic growth pay down the national debt and reduce poverty
more than people were evicted from neighbouring villages in hoima district in for the refinery and a new international airport which will fly in oil equipment according to the energy ministry
in kyakaboga resettlement village some km west of mubona s family about concrete houses with red iron roofs stood in neat lines
more than a dozen lay empty
the houses were built for families that lost their land and homes to the refinery and opted to be compensated with an equivalent amount of land rather than cash
i can t live here said christop opio one of the small minority who chose resettlement over money when the government acquired his land in kabaale for the airport
it looks like a camp and there is no privacy
all houses are so close together he said gesturing at the two rows of houses as construction workers in orange and red reflector jackets laid stones to build a police station in the midday sun
many families who have been resettled on the plot complained that they could not keep livestock at the modern houses unlike at their old rural homes and that their new farmland was too far away he said
the families who chose cash compensation have not fared much better activists said
innocent tumwebaze chairman of the oil refinery residents association which represents evictees said the million shillings per acre compensation was too little to buy land in the same area
we were compensated using outdated rates he said standing outside his house in kyakaboga resettlement village
masaba said land is valued according to the market price in the area and that people who choose to receive cash compensation agree to the rate before accepting the money
there is no one who is forced to take compensation they don t agree to
we have a grievance mechanism and they can also go to court he said by phone
some men who received the cash as the customary landowners deserted their families and disappeared to towns abandoning their wives and children who are staying with relatives
issues of compensation have broken up many families tumwebaze said
back in mubona s village red crosses painted by government officials in april mark the doors of five houses
i was told that an oil pipeline is going to pass through here said jacinta kyomukama whose house is marked adding that she is unsure whether to plant for the next season in case she is moved
masaba said the marks did not mean those houses would be demolished as the pipeline s final route has not been decided
i expect to be compensated and then go and buy land elsewhere said the mother of seven as her grandchildren milled around her
i do intend to go very far from here
