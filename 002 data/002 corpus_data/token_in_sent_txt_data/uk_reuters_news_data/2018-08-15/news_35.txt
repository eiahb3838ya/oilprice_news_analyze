after months of underproduction the organization of the petroleum exporting countries agreed with russia and other allies to raise output from july by returning to percent compliance with previously decided cuts

zanganeh told uae energy minister suhail who holds the opec presidency in that the jmmc should not distribute output increases among other producers
zanganeh s comments underline the tensions after opec s june meeting
saudi arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more to meet the group s overall conformity level meaning some members such as itself could make up for shortfalls elsewhere
