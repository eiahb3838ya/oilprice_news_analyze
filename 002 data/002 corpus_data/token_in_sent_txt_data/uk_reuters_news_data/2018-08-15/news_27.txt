feature-as tourists flock to indian himalayas, women lead plastics clean-up
leh india august thomson reuters foundation tsering chondol remembers a time when the water that flowed through the town of leh high in the himalayas in india s far north was pristine
we used to drink directly from the streams until our land became a tourist hub said chondol wearing a traditional black gown and a red scarf
leh is the largest town in the remote region of ladakh where locals have long wrested a living from herding goats and tending barley and wheat fields ringed by peaks
buddhist monasteries that dot the landscape are a reminder of ties to its eastern neighbour tibet
but as members of india s burgeoning have ventured in increasing numbers to holiday in ladakh s tranquil terrain its resources have been put under strain threatening its fragile ecosystem
more than tourists visited leh last year alone the local tourism body said twice the number of residents in the region
the result vehicles clogging narrow roads and much more pollution particularly sewage and plastic bags
with the arrival of lots of tourists people gradually forgot about the traditional ways of keeping the surroundings clean chondol said adding that the convenience and popularity of plastic bags had made matters worse
rigzin spalgon who heads leh s municipal committee said that a decade ago the city produced almost no waste
all of a sudden we started generating more than tonnes of waste and a lot of sewage per day spalgon said
the steady environmental deterioration over the years spurred more than volunteers in the women s alliance of ladakh which chondol heads to take measures to tackle plastic waste
this made us to think that we have to do something about it she told the thomson reuters foundation
the world uses up to trillion plastic bags annually the
environment programme says with some million tons of plastics ending up in the oceans each year
india generates tonnes of plastic waste daily
nearly half ends up in landfills on the streets and in drains and sewage systems according to india s central pollution control board
the issue of plastic pollution has caught the attention of india s government which in june pledged to eliminate all plastics in the country by
the jammu and kashmir region where ladakh is located has moved faster in january this year it banned plastic bags outright
using a plastic bag carries a fine of rupees or up to one month in jail or both
we were able to make ladakh free of plastic all because of the efforts of women s alliance of ladakh
they initiated the whole process and later ensured that the ban on plastic bags works said spalgon
half of india s states and union territories have introduced a ban on plastic bags yet many shoppers remain wedded to them
plastic waste litters the streets of the south asian nation
historically we have had a very poor record of plastic ban implementation with most governments only providing lip service said pratibha sharma from the campaign group global alliance for incinerator alternatives
megha shenoy a researcher at the ashoka trust for research in ecology and the environment said broader action was needed
governments need to work with citizens to collect fines and companies need to be held accountable in terms of their environmental and social responsibilities shenoy said
enforcing plastic bans also depends on people power said shakil romshoo head of the earth sciences department at kashmir university
the reason why these bans don t make an impact in india is very simple people are yet to get involved directly or indirectly in making these bans a success said romshoo
the ban on plastic in ladakh was successful because groups like women s alliance ensured people s participation in implementing the bans he told the thomson reuters foundation
in ladakh alliance volunteers backed by the local council and the police inspect shops and markets up to three times a year
they also come armed with a solution not only do they warn locals about the damage plastic bags do in the environment but they sell handmade cloth bags as an alternative
the income generated from making and selling cloth bags as well as traditional dresses helps the volunteers continue their conservation efforts while providing them with an extra source of cash in a region where most women are farmers and housewives
i want to be the part of the ladakhi women s movement as it is helping ladakh s environment and agriculture which is at risk because of the huge influx of tourists and chemical fertilisers said volunteer sonam dolma
chondol said the women s group is also now campaigning to end the use of chemical fertilisers
its actions have had other consequences too she said
before no one would think of allowing women to go out of the houses by themselves
forget about allowing them taking a lead role in bringing change in the society she said
thanks to the success of women s alliance today women in ladakh are a force to be reckoned with chondol said
