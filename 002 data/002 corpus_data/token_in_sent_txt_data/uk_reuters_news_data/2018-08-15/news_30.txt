update 2-european union carbon prices climb to 10-year high
eu carbon price rises to highest level since higher carbon prices mean more expensive to burn fossil fuels eu market reform reduced auction volumes drive rally updates prices adds more detail by nina chestney london aug reuters european union carbon permit prices have risen to their highest in years as reduced supply has prompted a flurry of buying
the permits called eu allowances are traded under the european union s emissions trading system ets which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
higher carbon prices make it more expensive for european utilities to burn fossil fuels and encourage a shift to cleaner sources of energy
the ets the eu s flagship tool for reducing emissions has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis which dragged prices down to lows of euros a tonne
eu allowances for delivery in december hit an high of euros a tonne in early trade on wednesday their highest level since november
the rise had a effect on german baseload power prices which reached a record high
when wholesale energy prices rise on the back of higher carbon utilities in some european countries pass on some of the cost to consumers through higher retail energy prices
carbon prices are still under a record high of more than euros in not long after the ets started
by gmt the eu allowance price had retreated to euros a tonne
the ets was long viewed as inefficient because it suffered from too many permits
reforms were hammered out last november after more than two years of debate in brussels
the reforms struck a delicate balance between being ambitious on climate change and protecting industries at risk of relocating abroad to avoid climate legislation
in measures to address the oversupply the european commission will withold a certain number of permits from market auctions from next year in a mechanism called the market stability reserve msr
traders said buying has increased in recent weeks as market participants stock up to build long positions due to reduced supply from auctions and amid higher energy prices
the number of permits released to the market by auctions has been reduced this month due to public holidays in several european countries
added to that weekly german auctions will stop after until the first quarter of next year as germany s current contract with the european energy exchange eex expires
nearly million permits from those auctions will have to be sold when auctions resume next year
but is already in serious deficit due to the msr reserve kicking in so million tonnes of additional supply in that year will make no difference to the deficit said analysts at investment bank berenberg
the bank said average prices could rise to euros a tonne in and euros in
in a reuters survey last month analysts raised their forecasts for carbon prices to after a bullish start to the year and on expectations that plans to reform the market will significantly curb oversupply
