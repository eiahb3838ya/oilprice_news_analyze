chinese oil importers shun u.s. crude despite tariff reversal
reuters chinese oil importers are shying away from buying crude as they fear beijing s decision to exclude the commodity from its tariff list in a trade dispute between the world s biggest economies may only be temporary
not a single tanker has loaded crude oil from the united states bound for china since the start of august thomson reuters eikon ship tracking data showed compared with about barrels per day bpd in june and july
the united states and china have been locked in a trade spat over the last few months but crude was dropped from china s final list of tariffs on billion in goods announced last week
the move underscored the growing importance of the united states as a key global oil producer and critical alternative supply source for top importer china
however buyers in china fret the commodity could be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with washington potentially getting added to tariff lists if the trade conflict takes a turn for the worse
since it takes months to get crude to china this not buying shipments is a precautionary measure to avoid any distressed selling in case the government puts tariffs on crude oil said sushant gupta research director at energy consultancy wood mackenzie
a source with a chinese refiner said the company was watching and seeing how the situation develops before placing new orders for oil
he declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media
that comes after the country s main oil importer unipec earlier this month suspended shipments from the united states
another petroleum source familiar with the chinese market said crude may have been left off the tariff list to facilitate clearing shipments that have already been committed to
the government probably wants to impose tariffs when there is no more crude on the water so i won t take it as a reversal of the political stance on crude said the source

that has been helped as a narrow between brent and dubai crude allows atlantic basin oil to be profitably shipped to asia
the spread on wednesday had nearly halved from a month ago to per barrel
although china s biggest oil suppliers are the middle east russia and west africa the united states has become an important global supplier since it opened up its market for exports in
beyond the complications of finding replacements for american oil the trade dispute also poses risks to economic growth
any further escalation in the trade conflict between them is clearly an important downside risk and could lead to a further slowdown in oil demand growth for leading to downward pressure on oil prices said gupta at wood mackenzie
