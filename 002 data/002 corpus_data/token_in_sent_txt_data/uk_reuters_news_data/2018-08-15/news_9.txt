update 2-china's jiangsu province to consolidate steel mill locations in efficiency drive
beijing reuters china s steelmaking province jiangsu will require steel mills to move to two new areas on the coast in the next few years according to a provincial government document to reduce air pollution and to make the industry more efficient
after years of getting rid of outdated excess capacity the latest measures are the next front in the government s effort to upgrade and streamline its smokestack industries
jiangsu province which accounted for percent of china s total crude steel output last year plans to create two steelmaking hubs focussing on steel production and relocate steel mills through merger and capacity trading the document said
the plan was distributed on tuesday by the jiangsu government and reviewed by reuters on wednesday
the provincial government declined to comment
jiangsu will guide and encourage steel companies to adopt furnaces eafs and to produce steel products used in military defence rail nuclear aerospace and new energy vehicles industries the document said
furnaces or emit far less harmful air than traditional blast furnaces which use coking coal as fuel
the move is similar to one outlined by hebei the country s top steel producing province earlier this year
last month zenith steel group based in the city of changzhou in jiangsu with annual capacity of million tonnes said it will move some production to a new steel factory in nantong on the coast of the province
in the document jiangsu explicitly ordered the city of xuzhou to cut number of steel mills in the city to under by the end of from currently and consolidate the remaining into one to two companies by
in april at least three steel mills were ordered closed in xuzhou
small steel mills and coke plants near the yangtze river and tai lake region will be eliminated by
the province also plans to keep its power capacity below gigawatts by and lower the portion of its power produced from coal to percent of total capacity from percent currently
it plans to build more solar and wind power generation on the coast to meet the targets
