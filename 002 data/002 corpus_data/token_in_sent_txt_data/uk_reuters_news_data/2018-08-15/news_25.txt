explainer-what is driving a rally in eu carbon permit prices?
european carbon price graphic by susanna twidale london aug reuters the benchmark european carbon price hit a high on wednesday marking a near percent rise this year with prices set to continue climbing over the next few years
the european union s emissions trading system ets charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
the scheme is the eu s key tool to meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by percent by compared with levels
each member state has a set number of permits it can auction each year which are then purchased by companies to cover their emissions
the ets suffered from excess supply following the financial crisis which kept prices low and rendered the scheme ineffective but in an effort to revive the scheme the eu agreed on reforms in to curb oversupply
the first of these reforms a market stability reserve msr comes into effect in which will take excess permits from the market
this year is all about buying in anticipation of the start of the msr energy aspects analyst trevor sikorski said
carbon analysts at thomson reuters forecast the msr will remove million tonnes of permits in cutting the supply available from government auctions by percent
over the years the analysts forecast a total of almost billion permits will be withdrawn
in addition germany europe s largest emitter of carbon dioxide said this week its near weekly auctions of permits would be paused from meaning around million fewer than expected permits will be auctioned this year
in a recent reuters survey of eight analysts the analysts on average expect prices to hit euros a tonne by with the most bullish forecast at
in addition to the msr the total quantity of carbon permits known as the linear reduction factor will be reduced by percent each year from to up from percent a year now
this means there will be fewer permits available to buy driving up the cost
high carbon costs make fossil fuel power generation more expensive which mean they also affect wholesale electricity prices
for a predominantly nuclear power generator such as france s edf strong carbon prices are bullish as the company can benefit from higher electricity prices
on the flip side companies with a large portion of fossil fuel power generation could be adversely hit by higher carbon prices if they are not well hedged and need to pay more to cover their emissions
most large utilities however will be protected as they hedge many years in advance
germany s rwe is the biggest company emitter of carbon dioxide in europe as most of its electricity is produced from fossil fuels
earlier this week the company s results revealed it has financially hedged its carbon needs until the end of limiting the impact of soaring prices
under the ets some industries are eligible for free permits if they are deemed to be vulnerable to competition from countries with looser environmental regulations known as carbon leakage
the number of sectors and companies eligible for this support will be reduced in the fourth trading phase of the scheme which runs from meaning more firms will need to buy carbon allowances another bullish factor
