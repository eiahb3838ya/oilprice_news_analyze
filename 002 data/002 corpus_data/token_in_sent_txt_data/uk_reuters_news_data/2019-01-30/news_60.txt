global oil industry braces for turmoil from u.s. crackdown on venezuela
new york jan reuters more than hours after the united states announced sanctions on venezuela s nationally owned oil company merchant trading firms and refiners were still deciphering what the measures prohibited
the sanctions announced on monday are aimed at driving president nicolas maduro from power the strongest measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of venezuelans in recent years
traders who sell venezuelan crude to the united states are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions according to people familiar with the discussions while companies who buy venezuelan oil have also been looking for seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third party intermediaries such as commodity merchants can continue
the sanctions here froze assets of pdvsa and require firms to pay for oil using accounts controlled by the country opposition party head and interim president juan guaido
pdvsa is seeking to sidestep the restrictions by asking major buyers including refiners to renegotiate contracts sources said
oil sanctions in the past have been evaded by using intermediaries said scott maberry who specializes in international trade at sheppard mullin law firm but he doubted that would happen with pdvsa
i would not be surprised if this administration is vigilant and does not feel bound by past practices said maberry
a department of treasury spokesman called the sanctions against pdvsa extremely sophisticated adding that the department would take questions from industry and stakeholders and issue faqs as no faq frequently asked questions had been issued by tuesday evening
via pdvsa venezuela exports about barrels of oil daily to the united states mostly to pdvsa subsidiary citgo petroleum and companies valero energy corp and chevron corp
it also imports products from the united states
the sanctions not only limit companies from paying pdvsa for crude but also oil sales moved through multiple third parties such as potential arrangements involving sending oil to russia or china which would later sell to an intermediary that would pass the oil on to buyers
intermediaries that comply with sanctions in general and transact in dollars would still be subject to the venezuela sanctions
transactions sent through a multitude of parties would only be allowed if the revenues were sent to accounts inaccessible by maduro s government according to a source familiar with the sanctions
treasury will be tracking this closely
the idea that this can get laundered and not tracked is said joe mcmonigle senior energy policy analyst at hedgeye in washington and a former energy department official under president george bush
the trump administration has said the restrictions should have a minimal impact on the consumer but some experts said they were concerned there could be unanticipated effects
pdvsa has so many intertwined dealings and transactions with the including through citgo that the immediate impact of these sanctions is far more comprehensive on the economy than you would typically see said scott flicker chair of the washington office of law firm paul hastings and head of the firm s global trade controls practice
the united states exempted citgo from sanctions until july
however previous sanctions have already prevented citgo from sending pdvsa its profits which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends
analysts at tudor pickering holt said that if citgo was unable to import venezuelan barrels some sort of impact on operations seems like a distinct refiners last week asked the administration not to issue sanctions according to a letter seen by reuters on tuesday
such a ban would further tighten the heavy sour crude market in the united states resulting in higher crude prices for refineries and higher fuel costs for consumers the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers a trade association said in a letter to president donald trump
