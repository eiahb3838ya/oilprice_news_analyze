corrects quote in paragraph to add word not by lesley wroughton washington jan reuters the envoy for venezuela elliott abrams cautioned socialist president nicolas maduro that acting against interim president juan guaido would be an extremely foolish speaking on wednesday days after being named the point person for venezuela by secretary of state mike pompeo abrams said the united states would keep up pressure on maduro to step down by applying further sanctions and searching for assets such as bank accounts and gold holdings
the security of interim president guaido is a concern abrams told a group of reporters
the regime has not acted against him in some time and i hope that is because they recognize that he has the support of the vast majority of venezuelans and that would be an extremely foolish move for the regime to washington has backed guaido in his push to force maduro from power
maduro who is supported by russia and china has barred guaido from leaving venezuela and frozen his assets
many opposition leaders have been imprisoned in venezuela in recent years
abrams emphasized that unseating maduro who still has the backing of the military could take time
asked whether washington may have underestimated the military s support for maduro abrams said this may well be and the democratic forces believe it can be a turning point
that doesn t mean its going to happen this week and we re not picking he said oil sanctions imposed by washington earlier this week were aimed at safeguarding venezuela s assets
the united states and other countries were searching for other possible venezuelan assets around the world including bank accounts and gold holdings he said
obviously if they have an account in moscow we re not going to get at it he added
abrams said there were discussions about ramping up aid to venezuelans including through a humanitarian corridor into the country
he did not give logistical details as to how such a scheme would operate
the humanitarian corridor is something we re looking at but of course it requires the cooperation of the regime he said
i don t know how practical that is
