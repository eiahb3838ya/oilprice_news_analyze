oecd urges australia to step up carbon emissions cuts
melbourne reuters australia needs to cut carbon emissions more sharply to meet its paris climate accord target the oecd warned on wednesday contradicting claims by the country s conservative government that the goal will be easily met
despite rapidly growing use of wind and solar power australia remains heavily dependent on coal and natural gas for energy while emissions from the transport sector are growing
that will make it tough for australia one of the worst greenhouse gas emitters in the organisation for economic cooperation and development to cut total greenhouse gas emissions by percent to percent from levels by as promised under the paris agreement
australia needs to intensify mitigation efforts to reach its paris agreement goal emissions are projected to increase by the oecd said in a review of australia s environmental performance
the report shows australia s greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise slightly from current levels to million tonnes mt of carbon dioxide equivalent well above its commitment to cut emissions to between mt and mt
graphic australia greenhouse gas emissions projections to adopting an integrated energy and climate policy framework for with an emission reduction goal for the power sector would avoid the projected rise in ghg emissions oecd angel gurria said in the report
the power sector is the country s biggest single polluter accounting for a third of greenhouse gas emissions
the report comes five months after the right wing of the coalition government forced the ditching of a comprehensive energy policy and ousted former prime minister malcolm turnbull
his successor scott morrison scrapped the effort to craft an integrated energy and climate policy to focus only on driving down power and gas prices
under pressure to do more from opposition labor the greens and the country s pacific island neighbors which face the threat of rising sea levels from global warming morrison has repeatedly said australia will easily meet its climate accord target as it has with the previous kyoto accords
this is an ambitious target but as indeed i have said on many occasions we will meet our targets at a canter morrison said on a visit to fiji earlier in january
the oecd urged canberra to set an emission reduction goal for the power sector use energy taxes and road pricing to better reflect the climate costs of fuel use and increase investment in rail and public transport
