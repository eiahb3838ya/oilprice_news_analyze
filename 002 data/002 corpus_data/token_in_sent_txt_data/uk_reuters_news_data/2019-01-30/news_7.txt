update 2-canadian province of alberta lowers oil curtailments as glut eases
adds divisions caused among oil companies analyst s comment by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba jan reuters the canadian province of alberta will ease oil curtailments in february and march earlier than expected saying on wednesday that its rare step to limit production had eased a glut of crude
alberta s move to scale back its curtailments came at the end of a volatile month in which canadian prices improved dramatically but producers were affected disproportionately
refiners are also scrambling to find a replacement for venezuelan heavy crude similar to what alberta produces because of sanctions on that country s oil company
prices for alberta oil fell in october to record lows compared with futures prices because of congested pipelines that backed up crude in storage tanks and prompted the curtailments
we re not out of the woods yet but this temporary measure is working premier rachel notley said in a statement
the province said it would set production for february and march at million barrels per day bpd up by bpd from january
storage levels have fallen by million barrels to a total of million barrels since curtailments were announced in december faster than expected the provincial government said
they have decreased by about million barrels a week this month it said
the oil cuts averted disaster for many small producers that were selling crude in some cases below cost
but they have sharply divided larger producers illustrating the messy task government faces
producers that do not fully own refineries such as cenovus energy inc and canadian natural resources ltd pressured alberta last year to impose the curtailments
those with processing capacity suncor energy inc husky energy inc and imperial oil ltd benefited from running cheap oil through their refineries and opposed the measure
there have also been unintended negative consequences
canadian natural resources said in a letter to service providers that changes alberta made in late december to how it calculated allowed production per company resulted in its shouldering a bigger share of production cuts than others
curtailments do not apply to small companies producing less than bpd
easing the curtailments may encourage oil producers to sign contracts to ship more crude by rail rbc dominion securities analyst greg pardy said in a note
