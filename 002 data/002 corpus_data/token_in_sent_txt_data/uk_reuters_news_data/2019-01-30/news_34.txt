offtakers face challenge as asia demand lags surging u.s. lng output
vienna reuters surging production of liquefied natural gas lng and slower growth of demand in asia this year could leave companies that have committed to purchase contracts struggling to find markets
several european and asian utilities have signed up to deals for lng that last to years
when they signed up five years or so ago buyers were confident asia could soak up any extra supplies produced by the lng industry which at the time had barely got going
but forecasts for asian lng demand have been reined in despite strong growth in china last year while output has been shooting up
capacity is expected to hit million tonnes a year mtpa by the end of from mtpa in
you ve seen some european utilities getting into the and i m not sure it s going well
there are some contracts where they probably wish they hadn t said david cox who runs london energy consulting
asian demand is still expanding
china s lng imports in december climbed percent from the same period a year earlier to a monthly record of million tonnes
but the surge was exceptional
the spurt at the end of the year was in part due to chinese firms stockpiling supplies to avoid a repeat of last winter s gas shortages
analysts at ihs markit and wood mackenzie expect growth to slow to percent this year as china eases up on its push to switch to gas from coal for heating
as a result some companies are pinning their hopes on europe
when cheniere energy started two new lng facilities at the end of last year it led to record amounts of cargoes heading to europe
the equation is very very simple at the moment
supply is coming on asia is growing
the extent to which supply beats asia we ll see supply coming into europe said andrew walker vice president of strategy at cheniere marketing
europe consumes half a trillion cubic meters of natural gas a year far more than the total global lng market which stood at mtpa at the end of
but most european supplies come via pipeline much of it from russia
despite washington s push to wean european states off those supplies there is little sign of major shift yet
european utilities such as centrica rwe iberdrola and edf do not face an immediate crunch
some contracts only kick in later this year
but some buyers in the asian market have already been offloading commitments to buy lng including australia s woodside petroleum gail india and indonesia s pertamina
japan s toshiba paid million to transfer its obligation to buy mtpa from a terminal
europe also made an attractive market for lng when shipping rates spiked last year because it is closer than asian markets to terminals which lie on the eastern side of the united states
elena sidorochkina head of lng at the trading arm of austria s energy company omv said high shipping rates could force more cooperation and partnerships between buyers
if there is a lack of shipping the offtakers will have to find a different way of placing them cargoes she said
tokyo gas and rwe and centrica have already reached deals to combine some shipping and delivery arrangements
there will be a day when shipping capacity will be traded in the same way you trade lng you will have shipping futures contracts said patrick dugas head of lng trading at total
