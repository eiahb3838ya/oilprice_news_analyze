drought threatens thousands of flamingo chicks in south africa
cape town reuters rescuers are moving hundreds of dehydrated lesser flamingo chicks from their breeding ground at a south african dam to a bird sanctuary in cape town to save them from death by starvation and lack of water
their birthplace kamfers dam in the northern cape is one of only three breeding grounds for the famously pink birds in southern africa the other two being in namibia and botswana according to researcher katta ludynia
the rescued chicks take three to four months to fledge and it is not yet clear whether they will eventually be released back into the wild in cape town or transported back hundreds of km miles to their home in kimberley she said
there are still several thousand birds breeding in the dam in areas that still have water said katta ludynia research manager at the southern african foundation for the conservation of coastal birds sanccob
it now depends on the water levels whether these birds will pull ludynia said the sanctuary was caring for around chicks most of them dehydrated when they first arrived on monday after being abandoned by parents who went off in search of food
the chicks are being moved to the sanctuary by plane and road
sanccob is one of several centres across south africa caring for around chicks that were rescued from the dam
although it hosts the biggest population of lesser flamingoes in southern africa kamfers dam situated to the north of kimberley is often dry and depends mainly on rain water
it also gets some water from a sewerage works that releases water into its wetlands
the dam in kimberley is so important because it is manageable so we can secure the water level there and that might be the only site the flamingoes can breed in southern africa if the drought continues in other areas ludynia said
