update 2-venezuelan oil stuck at ports, pdvsa struggles to import fuel
recasts throughout adds information on inventories by deisy buitrago and marianna parraga jan reuters venezuela s oil inventories have started to build up at the country s ports and terminals as pdvsa is finding it can not export crude at its usual rate due to sanctions imposed earlier this week according to sources and shipping data
sanctions announced on monday by the administration of president donald trump aimed at driving president nicolas maduro out of power after his contested last year have barred pdvsa s customers from transferring payments to the firm
that is effectively limiting pdvsa from shipping that oil because maduro s government can not collect the proceeds
as of wednesday venezuela had tankers with nearly million barrels of crude representing about two weeks of the country s production either waiting to load or expecting authorization to set sail
most of those were anchored near the port of jose the country s largest according to refinitiv eikon data
pdvsa responded to the sanctions by prohibiting tankers loading oil bound for the united states to leave venezuelan ports if cargoes are not prepaid
in addition pdvsa s inability to pay for crucial imports means fuel imports are delayed adding to the glut of tankers off venezuela s coast
we are facing problems to continue storing merey crude a pdvsa source said referring to the most common crude grade it exports
most cargoes were bound for customers including pdvsa s refining unit citgo petroleum chevron corp valero energy and pbf energy
other large vessels loaded with venezuelan oil and fuel were waiting to depart for singapore india and china
pdvsa exported million barrels per day bpd of crude last year including bpd to the united states
the company boosted sales in early january in anticipation of sanctions according to the refinitiv eikon data
wills rangel a pdvsa board member on wednesday told reuters the company which is currently producing million bpd of crude does not plan to cancel supply contracts with clients
that comes even though pdvsa president manuel quevedo on tuesday said a declaration of force majeure that would free pdvsa from paying penalties for undelivered cargoes was under consideration
meanwhile pdvsa is eying exports to other destinations
an instruction was given to define new export markets in to days rangel said
the company is looking to india for more imports and is also considering imports of light crude if necessary to boost domestic production of gasoline
washington s measures against the socialist maduro who has overseen the country s economic collapse and an exodus of millions of venezuelans in recent years aim to back a new government formed by the opposition leader juan guaido
pdvsa is facing problems unloading fuel imports for domestic use because sanctions are making it difficult to complete payments for deliveries according to rangel who also leads the firm s labor union
sanctions require pdvsa s customers including its refining arm citgo petroleum to deposit proceeds from imports of venezuelan oil in special accounts out of maduro s reach
they also limit dollar transactions with pdvsa but do not specify if fuel can still be exported to venezuela
even being here and having secured the money shippers in some cases have intended to block tankers from discharging said rangel
pdvsa will insist the fuel cargoes are discharged and try to find a way to pay for them according to rangel
he did not elaborate on how the company would convince suppliers and shipping firms hired to transport the cargoes to accept payments and discharge shipments under pdvsa s terms
venezuela s main fuel providers are citgo and india s reliance industries ltd which typically ships naphtha alkylate for gasoline diesel and components from the united states according to internal pdvsa trade documents
pdvsa has fuel inventories at its terminals sufficient to cover a month of domestic venezuelan consumption according to rangel s numbers as its main refining complex the paraguana refining center is working at percent of its capacity
but sources at pdvsa estimate stocks at closer to days of consumption with little finished gasoline or diesel
as of wednesday over tankers were anchored near pdvsa s ports waiting to discharge some million barrels of imported diesel gasoline vacuum gasoil liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha enough for an estimated days of consumption
that would give pdvsa more leeway to supply gas stations and power plants if tankers are finally discharged
