mexico's fuel thieves undeterred by deadly blast
tlahuelilpan mexico jan reuters days after a fireball erupted near the mexican town of tlahuelilpan killing at least people pilfering gasoline from a pipeline the area s fuel bandits were back in business
illegal taps some of them newly opened were the giveaway that fuel was flowing again
soldiers patrolling this area in central mexico after the tragedy told reuters they found illicit spigots just a few kilometers away on the same pipeline operated by the nation s oil company petroleos mexicanos or pemex
in one spot reuters saw a freshly dug hole leading to a shiny valve attached to the pipeline lying about a meter underground
nearby were discarded plastic hoses snack wrappers an empty pack of cigarettes and a blanket still wet with gasoline
such is the mammoth task confronting president andres manuel lopez obrador who has vowed to end mexico s rampant fuel theft
the practice is depriving the government of badly needed tax revenue it cost pemex an estimated billion last year alone
security experts say thieves organized crime gangs and corrupt pemex employees all have a hand in the trade
the crudest operators hack into pipelines to siphon gasoline and diesel often at night in rural outposts
they then resell it to gas station owners at roadside stands and in markets
a pemex spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment
in december lopez obrador announced a crackdown on the banditry
to thwart pipeline taps he ordered pemex to transport some fuel overland in tanker trucks
the result widespread shortages and long lines at gas stations
the bottlenecks have eased
but fuel theft is so endemic that the culture will be hard to break even in tlahuelilpan
an estimated of the town s residents many carrying buckets had flocked to a nearby pipeline when word spread on social media that a large pool of gasoline had sprung from a bootleg tap
dozens were killed when the gas ignited scores more were badly burned
marcelino valdez a catholic priest in tlahuelilpan said in between funerals that many here support lopez obrador
but he doubted the president s strategy would yield quick results in an area where nearly of the population lives in poverty according to government data
the people don t like to steal it s not something they enjoy valdez said
but they look up and see so much corruption so much injustice and they see that their hands are for a graphic on mexico fuel theft problem see hidalgo state where tlahuelilpan is located is the nation s leader in illicit breaches of pemex pipelines
fuel thieves known as huachicoleros last year drilled a record illegal taps in the state or nearly six each day according to pemex data
that is more than a increase in just two years
oil industry experts say hidalgo s location is a big reason
situated to the north of the mexican capital the state is home to pemex s oil refinery and critical pipelines supplying the giant mexico city metro area
fuel prices are a factor too
at the start of the government of enrique pena nieto hiked prices by as much as percent in a bid to end costly subsidies a move many in tlahuelilpan say is driving theft
since lopez obrador s term began on the government says it has arrested people accused of stealing fuel
it has frozen bank accounts and deployed soldiers to guard key pemex installations including the tula refinery about miles km southwest of tlahuelilpan
while organized crime is a big player the president has reserved particular disdain for pemex blaming crooked company insiders for much of the illicit trade
we re talking about a plan that has ties inside the government he said during a press conference
juan pedro cruz mayor of tlahuelilpan likewise is suspicious of pemex employees
he told reuters he visited the site of an illegal pipeline tap shortly after he was elected in
cruz said he watched as pemex workers carefully covered up the tap without disabling it
what message did that send to me cruz said
they were going to use it cruz has faced questions too
following the january accident news reports linked him to a local warehouse that once was used to store stolen fuel
cruz denied wrongdoing
he said pemex solicited his help in finding temporary storage for gasoline recovered from crooks
in addition to arresting fuel thieves lopez obrador has launched a new peso monthly scholarship for unemployed mexican youth a program he has pitched as a way to address the root causes of crime
but some townspeople in tlahuelilpan doubt it will dissuade many young people from seizing what some see as their only opportunity to get ahead
mariano hernandez a local math teacher said some fuel thieves can clear as much as pesos daily
they say i d rather make a lot of money for one or two years than live many years in poverty hernandez said
the president s steepest challenge may be persuading people such as magali ortiz that fuel theft is worthy of such scrutiny
her husband omar vasquez died in the conflagration
two other relatives are missing
stealing fuel is not a crime ortiz said
it s a mexican pesos reporting by david alire garcia editing by dan flynn and marla dickerson
