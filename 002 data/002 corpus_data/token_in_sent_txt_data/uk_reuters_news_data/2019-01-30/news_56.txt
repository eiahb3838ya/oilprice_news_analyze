refile-oil stable as economic outlook weighs, venezuela concerns support
corrects day to wednesday in paragraph by henning gloystein singapore jan reuters oil prices were stable on wednesday pressured by a cloudy outlook for the global economy but supported by worries over disruptions to supply from sanctions on venezuelan exports
west texas intermediate wti crude futures were at per barrel at gmt cents below their last settlement
international brent crude oil futures were cent above their last close at per barrel
this followed a price jump the previous session when markets first digested the sanctions on venezuela s oil exports
washington on monday announced export sanctions against venezuela s oil firm pdvsa limiting transactions between companies that do business with venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products
the sanctions aim to freeze sale proceeds from pdvsa s exports of roughly barrels per day bpd of crude oil to the united states
they are the toughest financial challenge yet to venezuela s embattled socialist president nicolas maduro
the step pushed up oil prices on monday but markets appeared more relaxed on tuesday as the sanctions only impact venezuelan supply to the united states
the venezuelan export volumes will not be eliminated from the market but rather rerouted to other countries said paola an analyst at consultancy rystad energy
with the united states dropping out as a customer for venezuelan oil she added that china and india will be able to pick up these oil volumes at great discounts
other analysts also pointed to global economic weakness as countering concerns such as the voluntary supply restraint by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which started late last year in a bid to tighten the market and prop up prices
the venezuelan political crisis as well as a saudi pledge to lower output further should have boosted crude oil but pulling in the opposite direction are heightened concerns about global growth particularly that of china said ole hansen head of commodity strategy at denmark s saxo bank
global economic growth and fuel consumption are expected to slow this year amid a trade dispute between the united states and china the world s two biggest economies
