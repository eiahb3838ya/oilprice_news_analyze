caracas reuters venezuela s government struck back at interim president juan guaido on tuesday with the supreme court imposing a travel ban and freeze on his bank accounts despite a warning from washington of serious consequences if it did so
the court also said prosecutors could investigate guaido in apparent retaliation for sweeping sanctions on oil firm pdvsa announced on monday
