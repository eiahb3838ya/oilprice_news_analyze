factbox-u.s. sanctions on venezuela's oil industry
jan reuters the united states imposed heavy sanctions on venezuela s oil industry on monday looking to cut off president nicolas maduro s primary source of revenue
the sanctions limit transactions between companies that do business with venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products
however there are currently numerous unanswered questions about the sanctions
the united states is aiming to freeze sale proceeds from venezuelan oil firm pdvsa s exports of roughly barrels per day bpd of crude to the united states
there is also a prohibition on firms exporting diluents unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude to venezuela
venezuela exports oil primarily to the united states india and china as well as some other nations
only the united states and india are notable sources of cash as russian and chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated agreements due to venezuela s heavy liabilities with those countries
the treasury department s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of venezuelan oil by refineries
however they stipulate that refiners can not make payments directly to pdvsa but into escrow accounts that pdvsa will not be able to access until the company is controlled by a new government
maduro and manuel quevedo who is both oil minister and head of pdvsa have said that they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the united states to leave the country s ports without being prepaid
pdvsa on tuesday said it was considering declaring force majeure on cargoes bound for the united states
for now companies can do business but with restrictions
refineries that import from venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to shift their supply sources elsewhere
however since payments can not be made to pdvsa this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from venezuela to the united states
the sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with pdvsa that began in recent years with customers including pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum india s reliance and russia s rosneft
chevron corp halliburton schlumberger baker hughes and weatherford international all have operations in venezuela and are allowed to continue to engage in transactions and activities with pdvsa and its joint ventures through july
this could cause venezuela s production to fall further later this year if service companies which have already reduced operations finally leave the country
chevron has four operations in the country and said it would not comment on the current situation in venezuela
conocophillips and exxon mobil both left venezuela years ago after late president hugo chavez nationalized the oil industry there

operators in venezuela norway s equinor has a percent stake in a heavy oil project in venezuela s orinoco belt area which is majority owned by pdvsa
the company also has a percent stake in a plataforma deltana block off eastern venezuela and it has employees in venezuela
we are just following the situation and making sure that we safeguard our employees equinor s spokesman said about the political developments and impact on the company s operations
russia s oil giant rosneft holds substantial interest in several oilfields in venezuela part of the nation s reserves which dwarf those of any other country
russia s lukoil was part of a russian consortium to develop production in venezuela but quit several years ago and has since then sharply reduced its presence in the country
citgo petroleum is a subsidiary of pdvsa and operates refining capacity to process about bpd
it also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the united states accounting for about percent of the nation s retail fuel market
the united states has exempted citgo from its sanctions until july
however previous sanctions have already prevented citgo from sending pdvsa its profits which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends
as of september the company had about million in cash and a credit line of approximately million according to a creditor familiar with the company s financial statements
citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from pdvsa for three more months according to the sanctions
the sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents heavy naphtha to pdvsa which are used for making the country s extra heavy crude oil ready for export
the opec member s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades from more than million bpd at the beginning of the century to between million and million bpd by late
most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy
venezuela and pdvsa are estimated to owe more than billion to bondholders suppliers allied governments lenders and creditors holding judgments
some creditors have gone to courts to try to seize citgo to satisfy their legal claims
