update 2-shareholders tell rwe to take hard line in coal compensation talks
duesseldorf germany reuters municipal shareholders in rwe have called on germany s biggest power producer to drive a hard bargain in talks with the government over compensation for a planned of power plants
a commission has proposed germany shut down all of its coal power stations by at the latest recommending at least billion euros billion pounds in aid to the regions affected
the move deals a particular blow to rwe which operates gigawatt gw of lignite and hard power plants in germany significantly more than smaller peers leag enbw uniper steag and vattenfall from the municipalities point of view the decisions can only be absorbed financially if there is adequate compensation said ernst gerlach head of vka which represents rwe s municipal shareholders
rwe should take a tough stance in the pending negotiations over power plant shutdowns he said on wednesday
in a sign that the commission s proposals could be watered down by the coalition parties a key lawmaker from chancellor angela merkel s conservatives also criticised the recommended steps
gerlach said the municipalities hold about percent in rwe after some cities and regional authorities sold shares in the group following years of poor performance
shares are down percent from their high in
rwe has said that the commission proposals which foresee gw of plant closures by would cause severe job cuts at the group which employs about staff in the rhenish coal mining area alone
we are very concerned by the looming staff reduction
an rwe worker driving an excavator can not simply find a new adequate job gerlach said
joachim pfeiffer spokesman for economic affairs in merkel s conservative bloc said the proposed measures would push up energy prices and not reduce emissions effectively
it s not only me there are also other party colleagues in our parliamentary group who see the decisions of the coal commission extremely critically pfeiffer said
it leaves the impression of implementing a climate policy only for symbolic purposes regardless of the economic costs and damage pfeiffer added
