the indian importer has deals to buy million tonnes a year of lng split between dominion energy s cove point plant and cheniere energy s sabine pass site
on wednesday gail issued two tenders to sell volumes trade sources said
in one tender gail has offered to sell a cargo from the cove point plant on apr
and buy a cargo for delivery in india on or march
in another tender it has offered two cargoes for loading from sabine pass one cargo for lifting in july and another in november
the tender closes on
gail is inherently short on shipping
they are certainly not able to lift all the cargoes they have from the on the tonnage they have a shipbroker said
the two tenders came less than two weeks after gail offered cargoes from cove point and three from sabine pass for loading in
there was strong demand for these cargoes with winners including glencore sources said
bp could also be one of the winners as it is long on shipping and may use the volumes to optimise the use of its fleet sources said
last year gail also made several swap deals with volumes
