refile-congo seeks relief talks with oil traders over $2 bln debt
london reuters congo republic is set to become the latest african country to start debt relief talks with trading houses after borrowing billion billion pounds from merchants such as trafigura and glencore but now finding its debt levels unsustainable sources familiar with the matter said
trading houses regularly lend money to clients in financial distress be it countries such as congo chad morocco or iraq s kurdistan region when other lenders walk away
but traders often charge heavy interest on loans and require access to resources
congo has recently appointed investment bank lazard as an advisor to help it renegotiate debts with the traders three banking and oil industry sources said
lazard declined to comment
the move is similar to chad which has appointed rothschild as an advisor in talks with glencore and four bank lenders
the development in congo is similar to the situation in chad which borrowed billion from glencore guaranteed by crude cargoes at a time of high oil prices
the central african country was forced to seek a restructuring because it had to channel most oil revenue towards debt repayments instead of its own budget when oil prices fell
negotiations to restructure the loan for a second time have been since and became fraught after chad said it would cut off some of the oil going to glencore when the two sides clashed over the terms
like chad congo republic has come under pressure from the imf to restructure its debt which trade sources fear may result in painful and prolonged talks with the traders unwilling to unilaterally improve credit terms
the republic of congo s overall debt including loans from oil traders is unsustainable and the authorities are planning measures to restore debt sustainability a spokesman for the imf said
glencore and trafigura declined to comment
congo republic s finance ministry declined to comment
congo is seeking an imf bailout and as in the case of chad the imf has laid out tough terms before releasing the funds
congo is regularly singled out by groups for the opaque management of its oil
in december the country pledged to cut its spending by percent in a bid to win the imf s imf said in october that congo s public or publicly guaranteed debt totalled billion or around percent of its gdp as of the end of july
out of this total the debt to traders represents about billion the country s prime minister said in october without providing a breakdown
he also said the country was weighing a moratorium on payments with private creditors
trafigura has lent the country around billion together with banks
in the case that congo defaults the trading house is fully responsible for the debt although it has insured it with according to two trade sources
glencore backed by a syndicate of banks lent brazzaville about million between and according to the company s annual accounts to be repaid with future oil deliveries over years
at the end of glencore was directly owed million while the banks were still owed about all in all we don t think the government is in a desperate situation and requires a massive restructuring
some sort of restructuring with a four to timeframe would probably be acceptable said a source at one of the trading houses who asked not to be identified because the issue can not be discussed in produces close to barrels per day bpd and is heavily dependent on its oil sales revenue
it said last june that it aimed to increase production by percent to chad congo has a wider set of creditors
glencore and its bank lenders accounted for nearly all of chad s external commercial debt
