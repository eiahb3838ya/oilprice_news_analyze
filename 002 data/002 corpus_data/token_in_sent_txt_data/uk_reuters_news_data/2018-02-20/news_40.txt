exclusive-turkey yet to issue gazprom permit for turkstream land pipeline - sources
moscow reuters turkey has yet to issue a permit for russia s gazprom to start building the part of the turkstream gas pipeline three sources familiar with the matter said stoking fears the strategically important project will be delayed
if completed the billion euro billion pounds pipeline would allow russia to reduce its reliance on ukraine as a transit route for its gas supplies to europe
ankara has authorised gazprom which has a de facto monopoly on russian gas exports by pipeline to start building two undersea sections of the project
however it has still not given gazprom the green light for the segment to ship russian gas onward to southern europe the sources told reuters
there is no permission from turkey which hampers talks about building the second line to europe one of the sources familiar with the talks said
relations between moscow and kiev have been badly strained by russia s annexation of crimea and a insurgency in eastern ukraine
even before this the countries had a series of disputes over gas prices with the kremlin accusing ukraine of diverting supplies to domestic consumers that were supposed to transit to european union countries
russia therefore wants to ship gas by alternative transit routes as much and soon as possible
it is planning to boost capacity of an existing undersea pipeline to germany a project known as nord stream which together with turkstream would remove the need to send any gas via ukraine
any serious delay to turkstream a project promoted by president vladimir putin could deepen doubts among some western analysts that it will ever be built in its current form
turkstream is designed to deliver more supplies to turkey the biggest buyer of russian gas after germany
more significantly for moscow it is also designed to extend across turkey to the borders of southern europe thus opening up a new transit route for russian gas
gazprom which did not respond to a written request for comment wants to complete the pipeline s construction in so time is of the essence
a second source said the permit problem might be related to talks between gazprom and turkish state company botas about a possible discount for russian gas
it looks like gazprom will have to give in to botas the source said
a third source in the turkish energy industry told reuters that botas and gazprom had yet to set up a joint venture they were meant to form for the part of turkstream
this was why a construction permit had not yet been issued the source added
botas and the turkish energy ministry declined to comment
for turkstream map click on gazprom has already started laying the undersea turkstream lines to turkey and southern europe respectively beneath the black sea
the pipes with a combined capacity of billion cubic metres bcm per year have yet to reach land
on monday turkstream s operating company said gazprom had already built km miles of the two lines almost half the pipeline s entire subsea portion
gazprom already supplies gas to samsun on turkey s black sea coast via an underwater pipeline called blue stream with a capacity of bcm per year
turkstream s birth has been troubled
gazprom was forced to abandon plans for a total of four turkstream lines after failing to agree on an entry point into southern europe
talks between moscow and ankara about the project were also suspended in october after the turkish military downed a russian warplane near the border
putin and his turkish counterpart tayyip erdogan eventually mended their relations and agreed to revive trade ties a year later
russia and turkey have since begun to cooperate with iran on trying to find a solution to the syrian crisis
putin and erdogan are in regular contact on this and other issues
