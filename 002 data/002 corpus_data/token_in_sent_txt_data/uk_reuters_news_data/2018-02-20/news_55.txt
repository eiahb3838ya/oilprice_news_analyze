japan task force echoes foreign minister calls to back renewables over coal, nuclear
japan s energy policies outdated task force says report commissioned by foreign minister taro kono urges more renewables less coal nuclear ambitious lawmaker a critic of nuclear by aaron sheldrick and linda sieg tokyo feb reuters an energy task force advising japan s foreign minister has proposed boosting renewable energy and shifting away from and nuclear power at home arguing the country s energy policies are outdated and undermine its global competitiveness
the advice comes in a report commissioned by minister taro kono a maverick lawmaker with prime ministerial ambitions and echoes his own convictions pitting him against japan s powerful ministry of economy trade and industry meti
meti urges using coal at home and financing projects abroad
the task force report presented to kono on monday argues nuclear power has lost economic competitiveness and says the world s economy should cut reliance on atomic energy to as little as possible and instead boost use of renewables
if japan focuses on renewable energy rooted in its abundant natural resources and reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and uranium this will contribute to its energy security and make possible a new domestic economy the task force said in the report
it is obvious that japan is the report comes as meti also a proponent of nuclear power is reviewing the country s energy policy
meti said it had no immediate response to the task force report
in its current official targets japan one of the world s biggest importers of thermal coal and natural gas aims for renewables to make up to percent of its energy mix in up from about percent now
kono in a speech in abu dhabi last month called that target lamentable since percent is the global average now
the son of a former foreign minister kono has made no secret of his ambition to lead the country at some point and has long been critical of japan s nuclear power industry
japan is the world s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas lng and the importer of coal used for power generation
thermal coal imports rose to a record last year while those of lng were near record highs as the fuels filled the gap in power generation left by the country s slow restart of nuclear power plants closed after the fukushima disaster
japanese companies are planning to build more than new coal plants
the fukushima crisis has also spurred a push into renewables mainly solar energy but renewable power only accounted for percent of japan s electricity supplies in october last year
renewable energy use has surged around the world in recent years as costs have come down
meanwhile the japanese government will next month submit a bill to parliament to make it easier to develop offshore wind power the yomiuri newspaper reported on tuesday
