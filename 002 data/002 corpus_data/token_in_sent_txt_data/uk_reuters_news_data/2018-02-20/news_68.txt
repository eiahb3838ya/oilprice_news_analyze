repeats with no changes

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters petroleum markets were hit by a heavy bout of in the second week of february as hedge funds liquidated some of the record long positions they accumulated over the previous seven months
hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by the equivalent of million barrels in the week to
fund managers have now cut the combined net long position in brent nymex and ice gasoline heating oil and european gasoil by a total of million barrels over the three most recent weeks
even so the combined net long position is still million barrels higher than at the end of june when fund managers began to turn bullish
the most recent week saw large reductions in net long positions in brent million barrels and wti million barrels
but in proportionate terms there were even larger reductions in european gasoil million barrels heating oil million barrels and gasoline million barrels
refined fuels accounted for percent of hedge fund managers net long position in the petroleum complex but almost percent of the liquidation in the week to
the reduction in net long positions across the complex was the largest pull for nine months according to position records published by exchanges and regulators
in every contract the liquidation of long positions far outstripped the creation of new short ones indicating fund managers were realising some profits after the strong rally in oil prices rather than turning outright bearish
portfolio managers positioning remains very lopsided across the complex with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of more than down from almost at the end of january but still exceptionally high
the imbalance remains a significant source of downside risk and could lead to a further sharp drop in oil prices if anything triggers further
fund managers still hold more than million barrels of long positions in petroleum futures and options a scale that was unprecedented until two months ago
there are fewer than million barrels of hedge fund short positions which is close to the lowest level since prices started falling in and means there will be little support from should prices fall
but the fundamental backdrop remains strong with oil consumption growing rapidly reported inventories declining and opec signalling production cuts will be extended through the end of
strong fundamentals have discouraged aggressive and convinced many fund managers to retain most of their existing long positions despite the recent pull back in crude prices
