bp sees self-driving electric vehicles crimping oil demand by 2040
london reuters the emergence of electric cars and travel sharing are set to dent oil consumption by oil and gas giant bp said forecasting a peak in demand for the first time
in its benchmark annual energy outlook bp forecast a growth in electric vehicles by with its chief economist spencer dale painting a world in which we travel much more but instead of using private cars we increasingly share trips in autonomous vehicles
while travel demand more than doubles over the period as economies in countries such as china and india grow higher oil demand will be more than offset by increased engine efficiency standards as well as the larger number of evs and shared traveling
unlike many other forecasts including previous bp energy outlooks which looked solely at the growing share of evs in the car fleet bp this year focused on the share of vehicles kilometers powered by electricity
under bp s evolving transition scenario which assumes that policies and technology continue to evolve at a speed similar to that seen in the recent past some percent of car kilometers are powered by electricity by from almost zero in
at the same time the number of evs is set to increase from million today to over million by representing roughly percent out of a total car fleet of billion
the gap between the increasing number of evs on the road and the kilometers powered by electricity is due to the expected growth in shared mobility by evs dale said
cars will be used much more intensely over time dale told reporters in a briefing on monday ahead of the release of the report on tuesday
as a result fuel demand from the car fleet is forecast to dip to million barrels per day bpd in from million bpd in when it represented around one fifth of total oil demand according to bp
bp expects autonomous vehicles to become available in the early
their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services
the average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car according to dale
what we expect to see in the is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars once you don t have to pay for a driver the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about or percent dale said
the vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be evs because of their lower maintenance costs
car makers including general motors and giants such as google waymo and uber technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a advantage
services are seen as the main use for most vehicles
bp sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year s forecast that evs would reach million by
the big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in ev purchases in the second half of the dale said
bp joined other oil companies such as royal dutch shell in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late when it is expected to slightly decline at around million bpd
it did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into
while the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the
oil companies such as bp shell and france s total are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades
dale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as million bpd roughly the same as the impact of evs
overall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades rising by a third into or roughly percent per year driven by growth in china and india but the world is learning to do more with less energy as economies become more efficient dale said
for example the european union s gross domestic product is set to treble in from but the level of energy demand will be the same
china s energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the when india will become the main driver of growth
bp once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power which is set to grow by percent by with its share in the energy mix increasing from percent to percent
the revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies particularly in india and china
there is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us to further boost the growth in the renewables dale said
