analysis-kazakhstan's frozen billions sound alarm for sovereign funds
london reuters when a belgian court ordered a bank to freeze billion billion pounds of assets held in trust for a kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund swf it set a worrying precedent for other swfs
the case is one of several brought to courts in europe by moldovan businessman anatolie stati who is attempting to force the kazakh government to pay up in a dispute about his energy investments in the country
court rulings imposing asset freezes in belgium the netherlands sweden and luxembourg are significant because they address the issue of whether swfs should be treated as investment arms of governments or as independent institutional investors
swfs which often invest the proceeds from the sale of national resources or manufactured goods have traditionally enjoyed the legal immunity reserved for a sovereign to protect their assets in foreign jurisdictions
the rulings in the kazakhstan case made waves because they ignore that immunity
this is a dangerous and worrisome precedent for other funds said paul rose an ohio state university law professor specialising in swfs
lots of funds will be looking very carefully at the outcome of this case and wondering whether their assets can be the kazakh government has said it will challenge the judgements
whether kazakhstan succeeds in getting the accounts unfrozen or not those watching the case reckon it is a landmark for swfs whose trillion in global investments range from real estate to equities and government bonds
in countries such as norway where disputes between investors and the government are more likely to be dealt with through efficient and independent domestic courts swfs have little cause to worry analysts say
but the kazakh case should be a concern for countries with a poor track record on investor protection as it could encourage disgruntled investors to target swfs assets
kirill dmitriev head of the russian direct investment fund predicted repercussions from the kazakh case
swfs represent a significant share of global capital and any attacks on swfs may trigger significant market turbulence he said
orders in dutch and belgian courts required bank of new york mellon to freeze monies it held in custody for the kazakh national fund and the republic of kazakhstan
the dutch court order has since been lifted
the belgian ruling is still in place but kazakhstan will challenge it at a court hearing that has been adjourned until april
kazakh assets in luxembourg and sweden are still frozen
swf assets have been frozen before but only in exceptional circumstances
for instance the united nations imposed a freeze on the libyan investment authority s overseas assets in as it feared personnel in the deposed government would spirit them away
the kazakh asset freezes followed a decision by the stockholm chamber of commerce to award stati and his some million in an arbitration
the body provides dispute resolution services to international businesses but it is not a court and is up to national courts to enforce its decisions
kazakhstan is refusing to pay and president nursultan nazarbayev s government said it has done nothing wrong
it has argued that this ruling was based on fraudulent information according to a press release from the kazakh justice ministry
stati s petition to a belgian court to enforce the award resulted in an order requiring bny mellon to freeze billion in kazakh national fund and republic of kazakhstan assets
the assets are held in custody by bny mellon s european bank the bank of new york mellon
bny mellon declined to comment
stati also obtained a separate order from a dutch court to freeze an approximately billion stake in kmg kashagan owned by another kazakh swf
kmg kashagan is a special purpose vehicle through which the country holds a stake in the kashagan energy project
there were further orders to freeze assets in luxembourg and sweden
stati has also tried to get the award enforced in courts in london and washington according to press releases from the kazakh justice ministry
those decisions would apply to kazakh assets held in england or the united states
both attempts have run into difficulties
in a preliminary hearing in june the english high court found that the initial arbitration award may have been obtained by fraud
proceedings are ongoing with a full trial scheduled to begin in october the kazakh justice ministry said
kazakhstan has also filed a separate claim against stati in washington with regard to the alleged fraud
industry participants are watching the court cases closely
if percent of a sovereign fund is frozen and you don t have access to it that should be an alarm bell for policymakers said simon a strategist at legal general investment management
it s been assumed so far that these assets were relatively swfs have laboured for years to position themselves as little different from any other institutional investor mostly to allay concerns countries might have about selling assets to foreign governments
some swfs have even renounced their sovereign immunity in investment contracts according to professor fabio bassan an swf law specialist and international law chair at roma tre university
but by depicting themselves as commercial investors rather than as agents of the state swfs have allowed their claim to sovereign immunity to be eroded experts say
the more they act like ordinary commercial investors and not as vehicles of the state it creates a risk that courts will not view them as instruments of the state and are less likely to give them immunity ohio university s rose said
as in the kazakh case courts in different countries have different interpretations of the status of an swf
graham harris a partner at law firm squire patton boggs noted that english law still makes it difficult to seize sovereign wealth but continental european courts are increasingly likely to view an swf as a commercial entity
it s a moving target he said
