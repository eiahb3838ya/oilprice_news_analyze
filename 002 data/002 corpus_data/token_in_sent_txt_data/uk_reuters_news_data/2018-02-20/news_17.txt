the united states has days to settle the issue after which time south korea could ask the wto to adjudicate

washington is already wrestling with a wto case brought by canada that challenges the foundations of trade law and is fighting china s claim to be treated as a market economy a designation that could stymie defenses against beijing
meanwhile trump has thrown the whole wto dispute settlement process into crisis by blocking the appointment of new appeals judges threatening to halt the workings of a system that has refereed global commerce for almost quarter of a century
south korea filed its complaint on challenging duties of up to percent that were slapped on south korean steel products and transformers in may
its trade ministry said last week that applying adverse facts available afa rules allowed the united states to unfairly levy high duties without thoroughly verifying data available to it
last may in a dispute with china the wto appeals judges ruled that the use of afa could be challenged in a dispute although there was not enough evidence to challenge them in the chinese case
the south korean complaint made no mention of recent trade friction over the imposition of safeguard duties on solar panels and washing machines
seoul has asked washington for compensation in that case a demand that could potentially be undermined if it became the subject of a dispute
the european union china taiwan and japan have also demanded compensation for those safeguard duties
