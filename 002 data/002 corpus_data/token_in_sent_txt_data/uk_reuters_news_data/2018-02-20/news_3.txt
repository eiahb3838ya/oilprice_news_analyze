anadarko agrees mozambique lng sale, banks discuss finance terms
london feb reuters anadarko petroleum s plan to export liquefied natural gas lng from mozambique moved a step closer to completion on tuesday after it agreed a lng sales and purchase agreement spa with electricite de france
france s utility will take million tonnes of lng annually from the mozambique area marketing venture led by anadarko and consisting of japanese trader mitsui india s ongc videsh and thailand s ptt among others
in all anadarko has agreed commercial terms including volume and price for million tonnes per annum mtpa of lng deals from mozambique closing in on its mtpa target needed to trigger a final investment decision fid said company spokeswoman helen wells
the energy company plans to build a plant estimated to cost around billion and start exporting lng drawn from vast finds in mozambique s offshore area block from or
deals so far include anadarko s first binding spa with edf as well as an earlier spa with thailand s ptt that is still undergoing government approvals
there is also a preliminary deal with japanese utility tohoku electric
additionally we are in advanced negotiations with a variety of buyers to meet our fid target wells said
the choice of european customer diversifies anadarko s supply offering and could see east african lng flowing into the region s terminals as declining indigenous gas production makes europe more reliant on imports especially russian piped gas
reaching this spa continues to validate mozambique lng s position as a competitive lng supplier and as one of the world s leading greenfield projects said mitch ingram anadarko s executive vice president of international and deepwater operations and project management
lng project developers across the board have struggled to find the buyers needed before banks and export credit agencies could commit financing for new plants
low oil prices surging global lng output and buyer s demands for flexibility shorter contract terms and competitive pricing have challenged the profitability of many projects and delayed investments in new ones
anadarko s spas hint at a potential thaw in relations and a chance at becoming the first major east african lng project to reach fid just as rising demand lifts prices and encourages investments in new supply
the between buyers and sellers has unsettled lenders
a typical financing model asked buyers to pay for a plant s entire output over thereby guaranteeing returns on loans
buyers growing rejection of this model has led to calls for shorter terms smaller volumes and flexibility to adjust or divert supply as circumstances change making it harder for banks to commit funds in light of new project risks
with regards to our project financing efforts lenders are keenly engaged and have indicated a willingness to support the initial project with the necessary levels of project finance commitments wells said
we are actively negotiating the terms and conditions of the reporting by oleg vukmanovic
