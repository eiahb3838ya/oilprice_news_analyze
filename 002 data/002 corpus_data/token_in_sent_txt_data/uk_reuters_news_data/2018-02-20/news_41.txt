the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters gasoline consumption has levelled off as the stimulus provided by low and falling oil prices between and has faded so refiners are increasingly turning to diesel and customers in emerging markets
gasoline consumption is forecast to rise by just barrels per day bpd in after remaining essentially unchanged last year according to the energy information administration
slower consumption growth stands in contrast to the earlier surge when usage rose by almost bpd in and another bpd in energy outlook eia february
traffic volumes are also growing more slowly after rising sharply during most of and according to separate estimates from the federal highway administration
traffic on roads was up by less than percent in the three months to november compared with the same period a year earlier traffic volume trends fhwa january
traffic growth has slowed from a peak of well over percent per year in the early part of shortly after oil prices hit their lowest point in the current cycle
oil prices have been trending higher for more than two years and are now within per barrel of their average real level over the entire of the last cycle
so while the cost of fuel is not expensive it is no longer especially cheap and the steady increase in prices has started to moderate consumption growth
the nationwide retail price of gasoline was per gallon in january an increase of more than cents per gallon compared with two years previously
if oil prices continue to climb through the remainder of and into as the price cycle matures gasoline consumption growth will likely slow even further
after two years in when the motorists provided a significant boost to global oil demand the main drivers of demand growth are rotating towards diesel and the emerging economies of latin america africa the middle east and asia
freight volumes are rising at some of the fastest rates this decade in the united states and around the rest of the world
since almost all cargo is moved by engines on ships trucks and railroads that use diesel fuel freight growth is providing a major stimulus for diesel consumption
in geographical terms the fastest growth in consumption will come from outside the united states and the other advanced industrial economies
developing economies accounted for most of the growth in oil consumption between and but were hit hard by the slump in commodity prices during and
the economic downturn in developing countries and associated slowdown in their own oil demand growth was one of the factors that worsened the oil price slump in and
as commodity prices rise again however economic growth across emerging markets is accelerating and propelling faster increases in fuel demand and adding to the upward pressure on oil prices
refiners exported more than billion barrels of finished petroleum products in the first months of an increase of almost percent compared with the same period in
finished product exports have accelerated significantly over the last two years and the trend is set to continue in
with the focus for demand growth shifting from gasoline to diesel and emerging markets fuel exports will become steadily more important for refiners
