insight-off-grid power pioneers pour into west africa
abidjan reuters standing by a towering equatorial forest kouame s new house may be beyond the reach of ivory coast s power grid but it s perfectly located for solar power entrepreneurs
buoyed by success in east africa solar power startups are pouring into west africa offering kits in a race to claim tens of millions of customers who lack reliable access to electricity
at least companies including leading east african players such as greenlight planet electric oge solar fenix international and bboxx have moved into the region most within the last two years
with a potential market worth billions of dollars major european energy companies such as french utilities edf and engie are taking notice too
it s important to be there now because the race has already started said marianne laigneau senior executive vice president of edf s international division
the main challenge facing smaller companies now is how to raise enough capital to supply the expensive solar kits in return for small upfront payments from customers
mobilising funding for firms providing home solar systems is also part of the government s power africa initiative
major power generation projects have been slow to get off the ground so power africa has partnered with startups such as oge and among others to accelerate access
in abidjan kouame doesn t know when or if the national grid will reach the outer edge of the urban sprawl but thanks to his new solar panel kit he has indoor lighting an electric fan and a television
but it s the light bulb hanging outside his front door that he values the most
at night we were scared to go outside the taxi driver says as his pregnant wife watches a dubbed brazilian soap opera
where there is light there is some billion people around the world have no access to a power grid according to the international energy agency iea
lighting and phone charging alone costs them about billion billion pounds a year and some estimates put their total annual energy costs at more than billion
while governments in much of the developing world are extending access to national networks africa is lagging with less than percent of african households connected iea figures show
but what has long been decried as a major obstacle to africa s development is viewed as an opportunity by entrepreneurs such as nir marom of lumos global the dutch startup that built and sold kouame his kit
i read an article about people paying cents a day for kerosene and candles and that just didn t make sense said marom
i said i can give them four kilowatt hours for the price of kerosene
and that started expansion lumos global s kits which cost about include a solar panel linked to a battery that supports power sockets a mobile phone adapter and led light bulbs
kouame who paid cfa francs upfront for his kit is now
a digital counter on the yellow battery pack tells him when he needs to top up his account using his mobile phone
if he doesn t pay the kit which also houses a global positioning system shuts down
but in five years he ll own it outright and his solar power will be free
five years is nothing he says already weighing the option of another system to run a large freezer sitting empty and unplugged in the corner of his living room
so my wife can do a little solar home systems shs like kouame s have been the main driver of power expansion in africa
in when most purchases were limited to simple lighting systems customers spent to on average over a product s lifetime according to gogla an independent industry association
now it s to
global revenues from the shs sector were million to million in gogla estimates
that should jump to billion to billion in
most of the main players in west africa cut their teeth in east africa drawn by the widespread use of mobile money transfers a key element of the model
success there drove annual growth of about percent from to
but as the east african market becomes more crowded and mobile money services spread across the continent many are now heading west
i remember doing a market sizing very early on and from a number of metrics west africa was a better market said xavier helgesen ceo of electric oge one of the sector leaders
about half of the overall african population are in west and central africa according to the iea
nigeria africa s biggest economy and most populous nation is alone home to roughly million people with no grid access
lumos is an outlier to the extent it picked west africa as its first market
it launched in nigeria in and by the end of had sold kits and was averaging percent revenue growth
late last year it expanded into ivory coast west africa s largest economy
still despite the rapid growth to date solar startups say more must be done to improve the capacity of solar home systems and to bring down their cost so the sector can reach its full potential
i don t believe electrification is a said jamie evans director of partnerships with
i believe it s here to stay
if the price of batteries starts dropping precipitously then it will almost certainly change the face of the industry he said
the need to provide consumer financing for the relatively expensive kits means expansion requires significant capital
but banks lacking expertise in the new sector often shy away from lending to companies said rolake akinkugbe head of energy at nigeria s fbnquest merchant bank
there s also a size issue
most of the solutions particularly those that deal with from a funding perspective are not within the threshold for banks she said
that means startups have largely relied on venture capital impact investors looking to generate social benefits as well as a profit and development finance institutions
but the model has its drawbacks
right now companies are having to constantly fundraise said lyndsay handler ceo of fenix international
in what was considered a milestone in the african sector engie bought fenix in october
with access to engie s capital handler says fenix aims to become a leader serving millions in the near term and tens of millions further down the road
hundreds of millions of dollars of investment are needed to have the impact we want to have she said
facing stagnating customer growth in their home markets european energy companies such as engie are increasingly looking abroad
africa s underserved growing population is seen by many as the future
the number of africans without grid access actually increased by nearly percent between and to million people
by the iea estimates that some percent of the global population will be in africa
raphael tilot engie africa s head of customer solutions likens solar to the rise of the mobile phone which landline networks on the continent
today no one is thinking about putting telecom wires to individual houses in these places
you can look at energy in the same way today he said
or solar home systems are a far better in addition to engie french giants total and edf also hold stakes in startups or are partnering with them
italian utility enel and germany s are investing in solar companies
evidence of the market growth is on exhibit on kouame s hillside in abidjan where several rooftops including his neighbour s are now crowned with solar panels
he asked me how it worked kouame smiles
then he went and bought one of his cfa francs reporting by joe bavier editing by david clarke
