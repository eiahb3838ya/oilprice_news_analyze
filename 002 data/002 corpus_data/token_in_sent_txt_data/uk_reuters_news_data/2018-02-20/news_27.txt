statkraft's investment plans may trip up over taxman's $510 mln claim
oslo feb reuters norwegian utility statkraft said it may have to put on hold some planned investments if the tax office goes ahead with a billion crown million claim for unaccounted taxes
statkraft said previously that it received a preliminary claim from the norwegian tax office in october for unpaid taxes relating to the capital structure of its now closed belgian unit statkraft treasury centre sa stc
if the tax office formalises the claim statkraft would have to pay the amount immediately meaning it would lose about a third of its record available cash earned by selling all its offshore wind assets
statkraft strongly disagrees that there is a legal basis for any reassessment a possible tax claim could affect statkraft s future financial capacity statkraft spokesman lars magnus gunther said on tuesday when asked about the possible consequences to investments of the tax claim
there is no formal decision yet but it will be possible to take it to court if necessary he added
the utility last week reported record high cash and cash equivalents of billion crowns as of the end of its fiscal year most of it intended to fund planned investments in onshore renewable energy projects
gunther said the company had no indication of when the tax authorities would make a final decision and had not made any relevant provisions in its balance sheet
the norwegian tax office found the company was not compliant with the arm s length principle statkraft said its annual results statement
the tax reassessment regards stc s income tax returns for the fiscal years and the total financial exposure until is seen at billion norwegian crowns the firm calculated
norway s tax authority declined to comment on statkraft s case
speaking generally it said that any company that receives a tax claim has to pay the full tax immediately
such claims must be paid immediately irrespective of any ongoing appeals litigation etc
in relation to the tax claim astrid dugstad tveter head of corporate law at norway s tax office told reuters in an email
the arm s length principle applies to transactions between related parties
it states that the amount charged by one related party to another for a given product must be the same as if the parties were not related said tveter
failure to comply with this principle can provide a basis for reassessment it said
