update 1-harsher sanctions needed against venezuela, targeting oil -oas chief
geneva reuters sanctions should be stepped up against venezuela s leaders and oil sector in response to the country s repressive political climate the head of the organisation of american states oas said on tuesday
under president nicolas maduro dictatorship has become more tyrannical and the suffering of its million people has increased amid dire shortages of food and medicine said luis almagro
sanctions have to become harsher this is the way to move forward
those against dictatorship should unite the secretary general of the oas told a geneva human rights forum organised by un watch a organisation
we must apply sanctions harsher ones
we must starve the regime sanctions have so far focussed on individual members of maduro s government and a ban on buying new venezuelan debt
restrictions on venezuela s oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the opec member state
almagro asked by reuters to elaborate on his remarks later told reporters the sanctions should be not only personal sanctions but sanctions also against the regime itself
that makes it necessary of course to target oil production it makes it necessary to target the family of the dictators it makes it necessary to target maduro will stand for in april in a ballot opposition leaders plan to boycott
critics say it is a farce with his main rivals barred from standing and a compliant election body bound to favour the ruling socialists
maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the oas a pawn of policy
secretary of state rex tillerson said two weeks ago at the end of a tour of latin america that the united states was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on venezuelan oil
irwin cotler a former canadian minister of justice serving on an oas panel investigating alleged crimes against humanity in venezuela said it would report its findings next month
we heard compelling witness testimony and we received documentary evidence of extrajudicial executions and widespread systematic attacks on civilians as a matter of state policy cotler told the forum
he cited cases of torture rape and arbitrary detention
we are witnessing a dismantling of democracy an assault on the rule of law and on the independence of the judiciary he added
rights groups have said than people died in protests last year
venezuelan authorities have previously dismissed reports of such rights abuses as baseless
