column-china, not trump, drives u.s. coal export revival: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
graphic seaborne coal exports by region by clyde russell launceston australia feb reuters if china does seek a way to retaliate against proposals to impose import curbs on steel and aluminium then targeting president donald trump s favoured coal would be tempting
one of trump s key campaign promises in the election victory was to end the war on what he termed beautiful clean coal
figures released last week by the energy information administration eia suggest he has met with some success
coal output surged the most in years to reach million short tonnes equivalent to about million metric tonnes in the eia said on
coal miners produced about million tonnes more in than in the eia said
so far so good for trump
but the problem is that virtually all of the good news for coal producers is on the export side and this is mainly a china phenomenon
exports are expected to have risen percent in from the prior year to about million tonnes according to the eia with volumes to asia nearly doubling to about million tonnes
these figures largely tally with and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
seaborne coal exports were about million tonnes in up from million in according to the vessel data
china bought million tonnes of coal last year more than double the million of the prior year while india remained the top asian destination with imports of million tonnes up from million in
japan remained slightly ahead of china with imports of million tonnes of coal in up from million the prior year according to the numbers
these figures don t make it explicit that china is the main driver behind the burgeoning coal exports given that the world s largest importer of the polluting fuel only bought million tonnes more from the united states last year than in
however the main dynamic driving coal markets is chinese import demand and the percent gain in its imports in from the prior year has helped prices for both thermal and coking coal remain at robust levels
the asian benchmark thermal coal price the newcastle weekly index ended at a tonne up percent from the end of
while this represents a solid gain it s worth noting that the low for was a tonne and that the index spent the majority of the year trading above something it hadn t done since
for coal exports to be competitive in asia and also in europe a thermal coal price of at least a tonne is required given the cost of mining inland transportation and shipping in the united states
chinese import demand has ensured that thermal coal prices have remained in the sweet spot for producers allowing them to be competitive in europe against exports from colombia and south africa as well as in asia
the relatively high prices for coking coal used in has also helped exporters of this fuel especially in india where they compete against supplies from top exporter australia
the outlook for coal exports is largely and this in turn is largely a function of how much china imports
if china comes close in to importing the million tonnes it did in then prices are likely to hold up providing miners with the opportunity to maintain or possibly even grow their exports
the current balance of risks is that china s coal imports will moderate somewhat this year as the country ramps up domestic output and continues its switch to fuels such as natural gas
if this is the case then prices may drift lower toward the level where exports start to struggle especially in asia
there is also no current suggestion that china would retaliate against the united states by targeting coal should trump accept the recommendation of the commerce department for a slew of curbs and tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from a variety of exporting countries
so far the chinese response has been limited to saying the trade review report is baseless and that it will take steps to protect its interests if the final decision affects china
while a trade war is unlikely to be in either the interests of china or the united states putting barriers on coal imports would be a powerful signal from beijing aimed straight at trump s heartland
