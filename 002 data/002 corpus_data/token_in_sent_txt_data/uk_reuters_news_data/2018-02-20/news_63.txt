refile-update 3-papua new guinea lng partners set plans for big expansion
melbourne reuters global giants exxonmobil corp and france s total sa have reached broad agreement on plans to double gas exports from papua new guinea their partner oil search ltd said on tuesday
the plan to expand the papua new guinea liquefied natural gas lng plant to around million tonnes per annum mtpa would see it rival australia s biggest lng projects at a cost of around billion according to analysts
oil search said the companies plan to add three new lng units or trains with two underpinned by gas from the fields run by total and one underpinned by existing fields and the new p nyang field run by exxon
there s no doubt that keeping it simple is one of the great advantages of the concept that is presently on the table managing director peter botten told analysts after the company reported a near threefold rise in annual core profit
it also allows a smart way of both marketing gas and the partners aim to start engineering and design work in the second half of this year but first need to agree terms with the png government botten said
these include domestic gas supply requirements local content and landowner agreements
the companies also need to sign off on and phasing the timing of their gas field developments
joint venture alignment challenges remain and shouldn t be underestimated said saul kavonic an analyst with consultants wood mackenzie
botten was confident exxonmobil and total are committed to the project which is aiming for a final investment decision in
i know they all have other interests around the world
but in no way do i see any blinking or any reluctance to move these projects forward
they re good economic solid projects he told reporters
the expansion is expected to be much cheaper than the original billion cost of building the png lng plant
botten said declining to comment on the cost estimate ahead of further engineering work
bernstein analysts estimate the mtpa of new capacity could be added for between billion and billion or around a ton
that would be less than half the per ton cost of chevron corp s gorgon lng plant in australia which is slightly smaller than the expanded png lng plant would be
australia s other major lng plant is the north west shelf which has annual production of around mtpa
this is the big shift in the next cycle of the lng story
it s very much about lower cost brownfield backfill developments bernstein analyst neil beveridge said
the partners in papua new guinea are racing to start producing from the new trains by around or when the lng market is expected to need new supply due to rapidly growing demand in asia and a lack of other new projects
we believe we re marketing at a perfect time for png lng and papua lng to secure these markets botten told analysts
he was speaking after oil search reported core profit for rose to million from million a year earlier on the back of sharply higher oil and gas prices and higher sales
