energy world in talks to build another lng facility in mindanao company plans to list philippine assets by manolo serapio jr manila feb reuters energy world corp expects to start up a power plant in the philippines by its chief executive said fed by the country s first liquefied natural gas lng imports
the philippines does not currently import lng but its domestic natural gas reserves are depleting and the country has been developing plans for import terminals for years
ewc s terminal on pagbilao island in quezon province if started up this year would mark the country s first lng imports
by the end of this year we should have megawatts mw in operation energy world corp ewc managing director and ceo stewart elliott told reuters in an interview in manila
the generating capacity is part of a mw power plant ewc is building in quezon located near its lng receiving plant that is percent complete and will be capable of receiving million tonnes of lng a year elliott said
the company will initially source the gas from the spot market and later possibly from its sengkang gas field in indonesia elliot said
ewc has been developing the power plant and import terminal since but completion has been set back by several delays
elliott said the project was now far enough advanced for ewc to have a tanker on in singapore to bring in lng once the facility is ready
in a sign the project is close to the national grid corporation of the philippines ngcp in charge of running the country s power grid has issued a system impact study to energy world that details how the plant s entry would affect the grid and is one of many requirements before power stations go online said an ngcp spokeswoman
power demand in the philippines is rising fast along with its expanding economy and imports of lng are expected to rise rapidly as the nation s natural gas reserves decline
the philippines plans to rely on imported lng when its malampaya gas field in western philippine waters dries up in
the field fuels around a fifth of the country s power
to meet future demand elliott said ewc was in early talks on another lng receiving site in southern mindanao island
the government is already looking for partners to invest in a separate billion lng facility to be built in batangas province also south of manila where many of the current power stations are located
ewc has also expressed interest to invest in the batangas lng project
elliott is looking as well to spin off its quezon lng terminal and power station and list the assets on the philippine stock exchange pse
the stock market is very actively talking to us saying they d like us to be listed and i would like it to be listed
i would prefer the end of this year but probably it will be next year he said
ewc has made some inquiries and the exchange is waiting for it to take any listing initiative pse chief operating officer roel refran told reuters
the company is also in discussions with local government officials for a lng plant to be built in sulu province in southern mindanao island though the project is in early stages of development
elliott said there could also be potential for the philippines to find new domestic gas reserves
there are gas wells in sulu province that have been shut in by earlier explorers looking for oil elliott said
there s gas sitting there
i know one concession holder was planning to sell it to malaysia but that would look stupid wouldn t it
