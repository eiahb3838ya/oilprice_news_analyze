interview-in the deepwater vs shale oil contest, shell backs both
london reuters royal dutch shell will expand deepwater output and turn a profit from its shale production in coming years as both together will help the oil major cope with a world of low crude prices the head of its oil and gas production said on tuesday
shell s deepwater production in brazil nigeria the gulf of mexico is much bigger and more profitable but the firm sees the nimble onshore shale as an engine for growth
we can see strong shale production growth strong cash surpluses that gives us a balance in our portfolio where you can ramp investment up and down you can moderate that very unlike deepwater which is quite chunky andy brown told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the ip week conference
they sit nicely together in a now mammoth deepwater projects and smaller shale fields both compete for shell s capital and could generate profits with oil as low as a barrel brown said
benchmark brent crude is now trading at about up from below at the start of
following shell s billion acquisition of bg group in the company became a major player in deep water which is set to produce barrels of oil equivalent per day boed by the end of the decade roughly a fifth of shell s total output
today it produces about boed
shell made its deepwater goals clear when it swept up nearly half the gulf of mexico oil and gas blocks awarded in a mexican auction in january months after picking up brazilian blocks
the offshore business was set to generate billion to billion a year in free cash flow in the next three years roughly a quarter of shell s total free cash flow brown said
the aim is to get it the cash generation and sustain it through the next decade he said
shell aimed to approve several new deepwater developments this year including vito in the gulf of mexico and bonga southwest in nigeria he said adding it would also work on plans to develop its gulf of mexico whale discovery
brown has overseen a sharp reduction in development costs in recent years with the help of new technology and by simplifying designs to make projects profitable at lower oil prices
but shell along with others such as exxon mobil and chevron has invested heavily in the shale businesses lured by lower development costs and quicker start up
shell still did not generate a profit from its shale activities much of it focused in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico but aimed to break even by a year earlier than originally planned brown said
we had an ambition to get cash flow positive in we accelerated that to
there are circumstances we can be cash flow positive this year brown said
shell would increase its shale output to barrels of oil equivalent per day boed by he added
