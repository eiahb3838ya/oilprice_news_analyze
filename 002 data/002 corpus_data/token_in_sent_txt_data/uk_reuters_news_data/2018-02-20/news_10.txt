stadler said the diesel scandal would continue to plague the company of course i am aware that the legal proceedings will continue to occupy us for some but he added that he and his management team had enough space to focus on the company s future strategy we are doing that with great stadler ran finance at audi for four years before becoming ceo in
he was a confidant of and former assistant to chairman ferdinand piech the scion of volkswagen s controlling clan who was himself ousted in
his position as ceo has been questioned before but so far audi s board has rallied around him
