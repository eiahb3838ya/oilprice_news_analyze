update 2-qatar says may switch part of a350 order to biggest model
toulouse france reuters airbus got a boost for its largest jet on tuesday when qatar airways said it was considering upgrading some of its orders to the largest model as it took delivery of the first such plane
the is designed to seat people and competes with boeing s profitable
the first was handed over to the gulf carrier on tuesday joining the smaller which has been in service for three years
airbus says the lightweight is percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the the
but sales of the have picked up and boeing is working on plans to leapfrog the with an upgraded boasting over seats
boeing last year sold against just one order for the
some airlines have begun downgrading some orders to the
qatar airways which has ordered both the and the indicated it was moving in the opposite direction and said it could shift more of its orders to the largest model
there is a possibility that we could convert some of the to the chief executive akbar al baker said
qatar is the top customer with on order including which have a list price of million
it recently canceled four orders following delays but subsequently to the new european jet family
the prospect of upgrades will come as a relief to airbus which is gambling on the to contain any market pressure from the as boeing develops its new model
last summer the european planemaker shelved tentative plans for an even bigger that would compete more directly with boeing s planned
fabrice bregier speaking on his last day as airbus chief operating officer said on tuesday studies had shown the idea worked in principle but that airbus would focus instead on pushing the
it s now time to start to be more aggressive and to explain to our customers or boeing s customers that this aircraft will be a better choice than a bregier said
boeing insists that its jet will be the world s most efficient aircraft in its category thanks to new wings
baker said qatar airways one of the world s major fleet buyers is not interested in an version of the being floated by airbus for carriers like qantas but could buy more of regular jets
yes there may in future be a requirement for more of these airplanes for qatar airways especially when we do further enhancements of our acquisitions he said
and of course there is a probability we will buy more of these airplanes to put in our leasing he also ruled out orders for the largest and smallest airbus jets whether the of which it has bought and has options for another three or the bombardier cseries a to that airbus agreed to rescue last year
