analysis-belgian reactors shutdown a test run for nuclear-free future
brussels reuters belgium s energy production is plunging as its nuclear reactors are taken offline for repairs with the power shortfall this winter seen as a test of the country s ability to cope when the reactors are phased out from
four nuclear reactors at doel near antwerp and three at tihange in liege all operated by electrabel part of france s engie produce about half of belgium s electricity when they are fully operational
six of the seven all built between and with an original lifespan of years are currently closed for repairs and maintenance reducing their combined gigawatts gw capacity by nearly
they are expected to come back online between late november and june
grid operator elia has warned it may have to ration electricity during the winter months while fears of a supply shortage that could see lights go out and trains stand still have pushed power prices to record highs
the doel and reactors were shut down in the spring for repairs to their systems while tihange went offline on for refuelling and regular maintenance
tihange and and doel are closed while concrete degradation in bunkers close to the reactor buildings is investigated and repaired
similar concerns led to a shutdown last year at doel the only reactor scheduled to remain online through november
engie built a new roof for the bunker at doel and will do the same at the other reactors with concrete degradation deputy director general pierre mongin told a briefing on thursday
belgium s nuclear regulator fanc has said problems in the concrete structures surrounding the four reactors are classed as the lowest level of severity with no impact on the population or the environment
this year belgium extended the area within which it distributes free iodine tablets for use in a nuclear emergency to all its territory and parts of germany and the netherlands although it said there was no specific risk from the reactors
john large an independent nuclear engineer and analyst said fixing the concrete degradations could take months longer than electrabel has projected
based on the problems at the other reactors he said the finish targeted for the repairs at doel was optimistic adding i would expect them to go into very certainly into the mid of next year before they can come back electrabel spokeswoman huge told reuters the dates given for restarting the reactors which will need permission from fanc were its best estimate given the information it has
elia estimates it will need about megawatts mw of additional capacity for the winter because of the outages of which mw has yet to be found
to help make up the loss engie has fired up old gas plants and brought in diesel generators as well as paying heavy industrial consumers to curb their use mongin said
grilled by lawmakers this month engie electrabel s chief nuclear officer thierry saegeman said it would work with elia to find power but that its first priority was safety
if shortfalls persist an plan devised by elia could see daily power cuts in rural areas danielle devogelaer of the federal planning bureau told the hearing
trains could not operate beyond the first stage of thomas baeken spokesman for rail operator infrabel told reuters halting passengers and freight within belgium a major transport hub for goods coming from asia to europe
energy minister marie christine marghem said imported power would help avoid blackouts
the month of november which was critical is now a lot more secure
for the rest of winter we will continue working she told reuters
a deal to free up capacity on belgian interconnectors through which much renewable electricity produced in northern germany reaches southern germany will allow more imports
elia ceo chris peeters told lawmakers that france would supply mw in november and december
belgium s liquefied natural gas lng imports from overseas are at high levels with six tankers due to arrive within days
but peeters was less positive about january and february especially if a cold winter limits the energy neighbouring countries can export
france for example has issues with energy availability in winter due to safety concerns at its own nuclear reactors
many european reactors are reaching the end of their lives and showing defects that ultimately can not be fixed
the struggle to meet energy demand this winter has raised questions about how belgium will cope after its nuclear reactors are decommissioned
a law passed in extended the lifetime of the oldest reactors to with phasing out due to start in
energy expert devogelaer told reuters belgium is likely to rely on natural gas while an elia spokeswoman said it expects to make up the loss from nuclear with gas and renewables such as solar and wind plus higher imports
the grid operator said in that at least gw of new build adjustable thermal capacity would be needed to cope with the shock of the nuclear exit
belgium has an lng terminal and by will have interconnectors with france luxembourg the netherlands britain and germany
but it has yet to begin building new power plants
it would require the construction of between six to eight generators in belgium to replace the nuclear capacity said pierre georges lead emea utilities analyst at s p global
the problem is that as of today no one is willing to build a gas power plant without a market design that would make them a belgian government plan to subsidise investment in gas plants is being reviewed to ensure it meets european union competition rules marghem said
but the clock is ticking
time is up now so if we have learned anything from this situation it is that we should not linger on we should really go ahead with the construction devogelaer told reuters
