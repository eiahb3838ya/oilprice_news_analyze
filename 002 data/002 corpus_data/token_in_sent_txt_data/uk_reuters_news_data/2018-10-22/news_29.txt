column-china's winter pollution cuts may boost high-grade iron ore: russell
launceston australia reuters with china s restrictions starting to take effect one of the conventional market wisdoms is that this will boost demand for iron ore
the logic is sound if steel mills are restricted as to how much they can pollute they will use the best possible quality iron ore in order to maximise the amount of steel produced relative to the energy consumed
this means that ore with an iron content of percent or higher should command a greater period during the winter restriction period than those poorer quality grades such as percent it s still not absolutely certain how much iron ore capacity will be idled or forced to run at lower production rates over the winter period as part of efforts to limit air pollution from burning coal
this time around beijing has allowed local authorities to set their own measures changing from last winter s policy of imposing blanket cuts on certain regions
this had made it more difficult to work out precisely how much steel capacity may be cut and how many tonnes of production may be lost
some areas such as top producer tangshan appeared to have imposed less stringent measures but have made them last for longer this time to the end of march as opposed to the middle of march in this year s curbs
analysts at barclays bank said in a research note on that the longer period will outweigh the more lenient capacity reductions resulting in the loss of million tonnes this winter from tangshan compared to million tonnes the previous winter
the output restrictions will also apply to more regions than last year raising the possibility that steel output will decline over the winter period
this didn t happen last winter as mills in areas not subject to restrictions were able to increase output by more than the volume lost by plants subject to pollution controls
whatever ends up being the case the likelihood is that steel mills will seek to use iron ore in order to produce the most amount of steel from whatever capacity they are allowed to use
this should boost demand for iron ore although this dynamic has yet to show up in pricing
iron ore for china delivery with a iron content as assessed by argus media ended last week at a tonne while ore was and was
this put the ore at a premium of percent to and at a premium of percent to the grade
that may seem like quite substantial but it s not far off the percent commanded by the ire over the at the end of october last year and the percent premium over
interestingly last winter the premium didn t actually widen over the season it narrowed with ore ending february just percent above grade ore and percent higher than that would seem to fly in the face of the market view that winter should lead to stronger demand for ore given that the last year the poorer quality grades actually closed the gap on the ore
however the explanation is likely that steel mills outside the pollution control areas took advantage of the wide discount for ore at the start of winter and bought cargoes of the cheaper supplies
this winter the dynamics may end being slightly different given the likely wider application of measures
certainly there is some evidence to suggest that ores such as those supplied by brazil s vale are seeing increasing demand
and port data compiled by refinitiv suggests that china may import as much as million tonnes from brazil this month
that would be the strongest monthly result since the data series began in
while this data is subject to revision due to the timing of vessels arriving and discharging their cargoes it still points to strong chinese demand for iron ore
