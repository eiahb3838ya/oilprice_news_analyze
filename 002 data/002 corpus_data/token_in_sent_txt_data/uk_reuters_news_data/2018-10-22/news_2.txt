update 4-biya wins cameroon election to extend 36-year rule
yaounde reuters cameroonian president paul biya has won by a landslide official results showed on monday extending his rule despite claims from two leading opposition candidates that the vote was fraudulent
at biya is the oldest leader in africa and the victory cements his place as one of africa s rulers
most cameroonians have known only him as president
but looming over his victory are allegations of ballot stuffing and intimidation while turnout was low because of a secessionist uprising in the anglophone northwest and southwest regions in which hundreds including unarmed civilians have died over the past year
biya won percent of the vote on a turnout of percent according to figures announced by the constitutional council
he won strongly in nine of regions including the south and east where he took more than percent of the vote
his closest rival maurice kamto won percent overall
thank you for your renewed and large confidence biya said on twitter
let us now join in taking up together the challenges that confront the announcement follows two weeks of tension in the and country where despite economic growth above percent a year since the last election most people live in poverty
kamto claimed victory for himself on based on his campaign s figures and in recent days police silenced opposition marches in the port city of douala where he is popular
we solemnly and categorically reject these manufactured results and refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the head of state kamto said in a statement
we will use all means of law to restore the truth of the ballot candidate cabral libii also rejected the results saying they did not reflect reality in cameroon
authorities have defended the voting process
the election was free fair and credible in spite of the security challenges in the regions the president of constitutional council clement atangana said on monday
the secessionist movement began in reaction to a government clampdown on peaceful protests calling for an end to the marginalisation of cameroon s minority
police killed civilians sparking further protests
the army burned villages and killed unarmed civilians residents told reuters forcing thousands to flee to regions or neighbouring nigeria
ghost towns are all that remain of once vibrant cities in those regions
turnout was percent in the northwest and percent in the southwest
in an area of million english speakers less than voted
despite the unrest and a desire among the young for change the opposition appeared unable to mount a credible challenge to biya who despite long absences in switzerland has kept core support
he has also benefited from apathy from many who saw no point in voting
i voted for the opposition even though i did not trust them
i wanted anything but paul biya said jerome an unemployed
my three children will have no future as long as he is the only current african president to have ruled longer than biya is equatorial guinea s teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo
