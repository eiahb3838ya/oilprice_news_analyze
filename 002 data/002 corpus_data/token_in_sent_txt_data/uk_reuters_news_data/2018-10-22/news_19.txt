rpt-analysis-new trade pact leaves most u.s. industry at mercy of mexico's courts
repeats story with no change to headline or text by chris prentice and frank jack daniel new city oct reuters the new north american trade agreement ends key legal protections for many businesses operating in mexico leaving their operations exposed to a risk they had avoided under the old trade deal mexico s court system
for thousands of firms the change could add complications and uncertainty to doing business south of the border
mexico is the trading partner
the previous trade agreement nafta included provisions that gave firms operating in mexico and canada the option to challenge government decisions at an international tribunal
a change in mexican or canadian regulations for example that had a material impact on a firm s operations could be challenged through an international panel instead of local courts
the removal of the investment protection means firms would now be at the mercy of mexico s courts which are notorious for corruption an energy industry source said
the provision has been part of numerous trade pacts to lessen risks for firms operating overseas
its removal makes the new agreement an outlier trade experts and industry sources in washington said
the administration of president donald trump took a negative view on the provision
trade representative ustr robert lighthizer sees it as a subsidy for companies to invest in mexico
a spokeswoman for ustr declined to comment for this story referring to lighthizer s previous statements which essentially said the old provision encouraged companies to move operations overseas at the cost of american jobs
trump blamed nafta for the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs to mexico where labor is cheaper
he threatened to end the free trade deal until mexico and canada agreed to more favorable terms
a revised pact was signed last month
a of protections the new deal officially called the united agreement usmca will phase out much of the old dispute settlement isds protections over coming years
lighthizer had initially wanted to remove all such protections but agreed to some carve outs after pressure from mexico and industry groups mexican sources said
he took a more moderate position because mexico wanted to preserve isds because it is very important for investment said jesus seade lead trade negotiator for mexico andr√©s manuel lopez obrador
republican lawmakers in the united states including senator orrin hatch from utah also opposed lighthizer s attempts to cut isds from the deal
he led other lawmakers to press lighthizer to keep nafta s robust investor protections in a march letter
a spokeswoman for hatch said he is still reviewing the deal and working to ensure it will build on nafta s proven success
under the new deal the isds tribunal would only be an option for firms disputing a small number of issues such as state expropriation of assets or discrimination against foreign entities
a handful of industries retain broader protections under usmca
they are oil and gas telecommunications power generation and infrastructure sectors that have contracts with the mexican government
but even those sectors face some uncertainty industry sources said because it is unclear if contracts with enterprises such as oil company petroleos mexicanos pemex and state power utility comision federal electricidad would be covered
this is a major degradation of investor protections a business industry source in washington said
large firms have typically won these kinds of disputes sources said
in agribusiness cargill inc won million from the arbitration tribunal over trade barriers the company said mexico erected against corn syrup from to
in ottawa was forced to pay exxonmobil corp and murphy oil corp million in damages after the companies won a victory against a requirement to spend money on research and development
the change to isds is certainly deliberate and signals what ustr will pursue in the future said inu manak a trade specialist at the cato institute a conservative think tank in washington
ustr last week said it plans to open trade talks with the european union the united kingdom and japan
we ll have to see how far they push it in the coming year as more negotiations begin manak said
