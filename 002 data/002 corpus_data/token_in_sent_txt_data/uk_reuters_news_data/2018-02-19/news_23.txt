update 1-no new tremor-tackling steps needed at dutch gas field, operator says
adds more detail amsterdam feb reuters the operator of the groningen gas field in the netherlands sees no need for further measures aimed at reducing the risk of tremors it said on monday following a series of small quakes
earlier this month the dutch government ordered production at the field to be cut by percent as quickly as possible and the immediate shutdown of five production points
that was in response to a magnitude tremor the largest in years that hit the groningen region in january
but both the operator nam and gas sector regulator sodm warned further quakes caused by decades of gas extraction couldn t be ruled out completely
this was underlined by three tremors with magnitudes of to between and which prompted sodm to demand a new review on production levels
in its report nam said the latest tremors did not merit additional measures as the closing of the production points in the loppersum cluster and the overall output reduction were expected to dampen earthquake risks within six months
nam expects the latest measures to reduce production by to billion cubic metres bcm in the year ending october compared with the original target for that year of bcm
the government will present by the end of march a full overview of possible measures to cut production towards its ultimate goal of bcm and will also decide on the production cap for the year through october
