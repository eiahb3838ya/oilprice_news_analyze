croatia's krk lng project faces opposition as investment decision looms
zagreb feb reuters croatia s plans for a floating liquefied natural gas lng terminal on the adriatic island of krk require a final investment decision by june if it is to hit a start target the managing director of project manager lng hrvatska said on monday
the project part of european union efforts to diversify away from russian energy imports is opposed by some environmentalists and residents
the end of june is a definite deadline for the final investment decision if the terminal is to be completed by the end of and start operating in early lng hrvatska boss goran francic told reuters
the eu has said it would invest million euros or percent of the project s assessed value and the united states has also expressed strong support for the terminal which could be used to import gas
the terminal s initial annual capacity is planned at billion cubic metres bcm which is roughly croatia s annual consumption
croatia produces around a half of its gas consumption and the terminal would also supply central and eastern european countries
by the end of may we should have agreements on using the terminal s capacity
the number of offers from last year mostly from foreign firms bodes well for the ongoing binding tender francic said
he said land and construction permits are expected in april and june respectively pending confirmation by the energy minister that the project poses no threat for the environment
an expert commission is likely to give its opinion on the terminal s environmental impact next month
francic said an environmental study provided by lng hrvatska had properly addressed all concerns about protection of the environment
however environmentalists and local communities on krk island have raised concerns about the impact on sea life and tourism and suggest the terminal be built on land instead which is more expensive
the problem for us is the use of sea water in the process of converting liquefied gas which will cool the water and is damaging in a small bay as well as the plan to use chlorine for protection of the pipes from algae and shells said vjeran pirsic from environmentalist group eko kvarner
the government has recently announced a special law to speed up the construction of the terminal which pirsic also finds inappropriate
it s a restriction of democracy if the government goes against the will of the local communities by imposing a special law said pirsic adding that the project does not have to be scrapped but rather substantially improved
environmentalists and krk local municipalities have announced a protest against the terminal for march in the nearby port of rijeka
pirsic said all legal means and methods of civil disobedience will be used to stop the terminal as it is currently planned
marija mileta from ecology group zelena akcija said croatia should scrap the lng terminal altogether and focus on renewables as emitting energy sources
