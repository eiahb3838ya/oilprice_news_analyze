column-congo's cobalt hopes risk the same ruinous road as thai rice: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia feb reuters what do the moves by the democratic republic of the congo drc to boost its share of the country s cobalt bounty have in common with the former thai government s attempts to control the global market for rice exports
both are examples of dominant producers of a commodity trying to extract more wealth from that position
it s also likely that similar to the ultimate disaster that befell ousted thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra the drc s attempts to extract more from cobalt will unleash a wave of unintended consequences none of which will be positive for the government in kinshasa
cobalt has gone from a minor metal with an almost public profile to the major threat to the future of the switch to electric vehicles and battery storage for electricity
this is because cobalt is a key ingredient in the current technology batteries essential for both cars and electricity storage and the drc produces more than half of the world s supply
the drc is hardly a paragon of stable government with president joseph kabila still refusing to hold elections even though his term expired two years ago
much of the country remains beyond the control of the central government and its recent history has seen numerous conflicts that involved several neighbouring countries and various armed factions
however kabila s government has made it clear that it now wants a greater share of the revenue from its vast reserves of cobalt with the country producing tonnes of the metal last year a jump of percent from
parliament has approved a new mining code that increases royalties to percent and removes a stability clause in the current law that protects miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for years
the code still has to be signed into law by kabila and miners active in the country including glencore and ivanhoe mines are lobbying for changes and talks about future taxation arrangements
the drc s miner gecamines also wants to contracts with international partners to secure a bigger share of revenues
the drc situation occupied much of the recent investing in african mining indaba conference in cape town with miners in attendance privately expressing fears that the drc would ultimately move down the road to full nationalisation of the industry
what does this have in common with yingluck s policy of subsidising thai rice farmers a policy she introduced to win the support of the rural population who helped her to election victory in july
yingluck s government saw what they thought was an opportunity to make global rice consumers pay more for the staple grain which would allow them to pay generous subsidies to rural farmers
at the time thailand was the world s largest exporter of rice with a market share above percent and there was real market concern not only of rising prices but also of shortages much like today with cobalt
but what happened was that as soon as the new thai government tried to raise export prices the country became the supplier of last resort and buyers moved increasingly to competitors such as vietnam and india
ultimately the thai government spent billions of dollars buying rice it couldn t sell forcing it to stockpile millions of tonnes of the grain leading to fiscal pressure and allegations of mismanagement that helped spur the military takeover that removed yingluck in may
this isn t suggesting that the drc is heading toward a military coup but there are similar dynamics starting to play out
the first is that the hunt for cobalt outside the drc is going to be massively stepped up with the united states and sweden among those countries that have already said they are targeting new deposits of the metal
secondly huge amounts of capital are about to flow into finding alternatives to using cobalt in batteries or at least reducing the amount of cobalt used for each unit
thirdly the drc is likely to suffer an investment boycott if it goes ahead and implements terms that punish the mining companies that have taken a risk and put their money into developing the central african nation s resources
numerous commentators have pointed out that there is still a cobalt supply crunch on the horizon as new mines improved battery technologies and extensive recycling of used batteries is likely to still leave a shortfall of cobalt assuming the forecasts for electric cars and batteries are accurate
this may be the case but past experience has shown that when the price signal is strong enough the response tends to happen far more quickly than anticipated
right now the price signal is flashing red with london cobalt futures ending at a tonne on up percent so far this year but also up an astonishing percent since the low of from february
the drc is in pole position to benefit from the expected surge in demand for cobalt but only if it decides to pursue polices that don t alienate mining companies and encourage the rapid development of alternatives
