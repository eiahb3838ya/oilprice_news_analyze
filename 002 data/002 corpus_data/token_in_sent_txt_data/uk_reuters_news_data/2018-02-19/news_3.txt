british columbia challenges alberta wine ban in oil row
vancouver reuters british columbia said on monday that it will formally challenge a ban of its wine by alberta under canada s national pact as a battle between the two provinces over a crude oil pipeline expansion project rages on
british columbia
a top canadian wine producer said it had notified alberta it was seeking consultation under canadian free trade agreement s cfta dispute settlement process as it looks to end alberta s ban of
wine
alberta halted purchases of wine from its western neighbor earlier this month after
proposed new rules to block increased oil shipments through the province potentially holding up kinder morgan canada ltd s planned c billion billion trans mountain pipeline expansion
alberta canada s energy heartland province is a major supporter of the project while british columbia is fiercely opposed
it was approved by canada in though construction has been delayed by permitting issues
british columbia has defended its proposed rules saying it has every right to take steps to protect its land and waters while alberta says the rules are outside of the province s jurisdiction as the pipeline is federally regulated
the spat has led to alberta forming a task force to find new ways to strike back at while british columbia has proclaimed april as
wine month and has ramped up the promotion of its wine within its borders and abroad
