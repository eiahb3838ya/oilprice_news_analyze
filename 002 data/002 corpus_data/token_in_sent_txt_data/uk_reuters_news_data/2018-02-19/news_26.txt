poland's coal imports from u.s. rose five-fold in 2017
warsaw feb reuters poland s coal imports from the united states jumped last year to tonnes due to shortages on the domestic market data from the arp agency which monitors the polish coal market showed
poland which generates most of its electricity from coal faced coal shortages last year mostly because mining giant pgg failed to meet its original output targets
that is why coal trader weglokoks which mostly exports coal has received two imported cargoes from the united states since november and is awaiting one more a source familiar with the firm said
the cargoes will be mixed with polish coal and exported and sold to local power plants
coal imported from the united states accounted for percent of total coal imports in
over sixty percent of the coal was coking coal used in steel making but unlike in poland also bought thermal coal overseas
most of the coal imported last year came from russia and poland also significantly increased purchases in colombia
the polish unit of steelmaker arcelormittal also said it had imported coking coal from suppliers including in north america
due to the shortfall in domestic supplies of coking coal last year arcelormittal poland was forced to import the missing volumes a spokeswoman for the polish unit said in an email
the increase of high sea imports in versus amounted to around percent
the main import directions included australia africa and northern america she added
according to the energy ministry poland will remain dependant on coal for decades with its share in electricity production seen falling to percent by from around percent now
