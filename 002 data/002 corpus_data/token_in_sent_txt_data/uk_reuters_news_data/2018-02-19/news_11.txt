france assails equatorial guinea claim of immunity of obiang's son in graft case
the hague reuters france asked the world court on monday to throw out a case launched by equatorial guinea saying the african country was wrongly using the court to shield the son of its ruler from prosecution in france following a corruption investigation
the case before the united nation s highest court formally known as the international court of justice is seen as an important test of the limits of diplomatic immunity
equatorial guinea launched the case in after france raided the paris residence of teodorin obiang as part of a corruption investigation that eventually resulted in his conviction for embezzlement in october
equatorial guinea argued that obiang was the country s second when the raid took place and that his paris residence therefore was part of its diplomatic mission
the french criminal proceedings against the second constitute a violation of the immunity to which he is entitled under international law it said in its complaint invoking the vienna convention on diplomatic relations
but at the start of jurisdictional hearings on monday france argued that guinea only sought to add the residence to its diplomatic residence after the raid had taken place
france s representative alain pellet told the court to disregard the wholly unbelievable circumstances under which the apartment on avenue foch suddenly became a part of the how ever many positions he holds obiang is no diplomat pellet said
equatorial guinea is due to respond on tuesday
a french court found obiang guilty of embezzlement in october during a trial in absentia and ordered the confiscation of more than million euros worth of his assets
the residence at the centre of the guinean dispute is a luxury residence on avenue foch in paris a grand sweeping road near the arc de triomphe often favoured by wealthy african expatriates and politicians
the property bought for million euros in had rooms a gym studio and disco with cinema screen
pellet said french investigators found luxury cars on the premises when they searched it the first time
obiang is the son of president teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo who has ruled the former spanish colony for more than three decades
rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world s most corrupt
if judges decide the international court has jurisdiction then they would then move to hear equatorial guinea s claim on its merits a process likely to take more than a year
