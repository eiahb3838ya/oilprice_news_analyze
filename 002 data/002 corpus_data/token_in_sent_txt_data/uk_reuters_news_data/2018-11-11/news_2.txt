update 3-saudi arabia to ship less oil in dec as it floats cut talks possibility
abu dhabi reuters saudi arabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by million barrels per day in december its energy minister said on sunday as the opec power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut
khalid told reporters that saudi aramco s customer crude oil nominations would fall by bpd in december versus november due to seasonal lower demand
the cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about percent
saudi arabia has increased output by just about million bpd this year under pressure from president donald trump and other consuming countries to help balance the market to compensate for lower supplies from iran due to sanctions
but since iran s customers were given generous waivers to continue buying crude concerns grew about market oversupply and oil prices fell to below per barrel on friday from a barrel in october
we have been increasing production in response to demand falih told reporters in abu dhabi ahead of a joint opec market monitoring committee meeting
i ll tell you a piece of news which is that december nominations are barrels less than november
so we are seeing a tapering off part of it is year end part of it is maintenance so we will be shipping less in december than we are in saudi arabia is discussing a proposal that could see opec and oil producers cut output by up to million bpd two sources told reuters earlier on sunday as the world s top oil exporter grapples with a drop in crude prices
the sources said any such deal would depend on factors including the level of iranian exports after the united states imposed sanctions on tehran but granted iran s top oil buyers waivers to continue buying oil
russian participation was key to helping opec rebalance the market during
but russian energy minister alexander novak said on sunday he wasn t certain the market would be oversupplied next year
he said the oversupply for the next few months would be seasonally driven while by mid the market could be balanced again and demand could even exceed supply
riyadh was surprised by the waivers granted by washington to iran s main customers such as china and india a move which hit oil prices at least three industry and opec sources told reuters
now saudi arabia wants to act to prevent a further slide in prices and is leading discussions on cutting oil output next year the sources said
under a deal set to expire at the end of the year opec and producers agreed to curb output by around million bpd
but producers ended up cutting more and so agreed in june to limit their reductions by more than their output targets meaning restoring about million bpd in output
opec and its allies will meet in vienna on to decide on output policy for
there is a general discussion about this cut
but the question is how much is needed to be reduced by the market one of the sources said in abu dhabi on sunday
no one expected the waivers
saudi arabia wants to at least put a floor under oil prices
no one wants a free fall in prices the source added
kazakh deputy energy minister magzum mirzagaliyev told reporters in abu dhabi that he understood saudi arabia was suggesting using output levels as a baseline for determining cuts
falih did not rule out the possibility of a cut next year but also said he would like to move into with minimum i think ideally we don t like to cut
ideally we like to keep the market liberally supplied and comfortable
we will only cut if we see a persistent glut emerging and quite frankly we are seeing some signs of this coming out of the us we have not seen the signs globally he told reporters
brent crude on friday fell cents or percent to settle at a barrel
it lost about percent on the week and has shed more than percent this quarter
washington gave waivers to eight iranian oil buyers china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey
this group takes as much as of iran s seaborne oil exports trade data shows
the administration has vowed to reduce iranian oil exports to zero and trump has put pressure on saudi arabia to raise output to cool the market
iran s crude exports could fall to little more than million bpd in november roughly a third of their peak
but traders and analysts say that figure could rise from december as importers use their waivers
falih said last month the kingdom would pump million bpd in november up from million bpd in october
he also said there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles after increases in recent months
