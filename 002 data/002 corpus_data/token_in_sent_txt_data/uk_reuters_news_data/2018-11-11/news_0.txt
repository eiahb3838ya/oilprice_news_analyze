engie brasil energia is negotiating the contracts on the free market that would allow it to build new wind farms without going through brazilian government auctions its cfo carlos freitas told reuters in an interview
we are already closing contracts and aim to reach a critical mass that will make the investment viable freitas said
we hope to make an announcement fierce competition in brazil s regulated energy market depressed wind power contracts last year to record lows of reais per mwh
but on the free market contracts can be signed for reais per mwh according to the bbce electronic trading platform
the prices from the auctions on the regulated market are not attractive for us so we prefer to focus on the free market where we are have the advantage of being the biggest player in brazil freitas said
large wind farms that engie is building already allow economies of scale that bring down costs but require heavy investments he said
the mw umburanas wind farm complex in the brazilian state of bahia which has percent of its future energy output already sold on the free market involves investment budgeted at billion reais
phase of the campo largo complex also in bahia will cost billion reais to build with a mw capacity all of which has already been contracted he said
