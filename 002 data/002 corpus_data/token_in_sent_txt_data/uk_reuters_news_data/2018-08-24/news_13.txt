exclusive-china's unipec to resume u.s. oil purchases after tariff policy change -sources
reuters china s unipec will resume purchases of crude oil in october after a halt due to the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies three sources with knowledge of the matter said
the decision to start buying crude oil again from the united states comes after beijing earlier in august excluded it from its import tariff list
a source with knowledge of the matter said unipec will buy some crude loading in october following the change in beijing s unipec s imports shrunk when china retaliated by putting crude oil on the tariff list but now it is coming back to normal business with import volumes recovering a second source said
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss commercial deals with media
unipec did not respond to a request for comment
graphic crude oil exports to china unipec the trading arm of asia s biggest refiner sinopec and also one of the largest buyers of oil stopped loading american crude in august and september after beijing announced in june that it plans to impose a percent tariff on crude oil imports from the united states
following lobbying by sinopec crude was dropped from china s final tariff list earlier in august allowing unipec to resume importing oil the sources said
it was not clear how much oil unipec would buy
oil takes about months to reach china which means cargoes loaded in october would arrive in november or december
it also was not clear however whether all of the crude bought by sinopec would end up in china
a third source said the october cargoes were meant for trading meaning they may be sold on and end up in other countries
before the trade dispute broke out china overtook canada as the largest importer of crude in the first five months this year importing an average of nearly barrels per day data from energy information administration showed
the resumption of oil purchases may not last long however
and chinese talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute ended on thursday with no breakthrough and both countries instead activated another round of tariffs on billion worth of each other s goods
many analysts expect crude to be hit with tariffs eventually should no solution be found
