shelved aramco ipo hits at heart of saudi prince's reforms
reuters saudi arabia s decision to shelve what was billed as the biggest share sale ever is a major blow to the credibility of crown prince mohammed bin salman but there are other ways to finance reforms to strengthen the economy bankers and investors say
the initial public offering ipo of percent of oil giant saudi aramco was a centrepiece of the crown prince s plan to diversify the kingdom s economy beyond oil by raising billion billion for investment in other sectors
the ruler widely known as mbs also promised that listing saudi aramco on international stock markets would help create a culture of openness in the secretive kingdom and make it more appealing to foreign investors
the decision to shelve the ipo raises doubts about the management of the process as well as the broader reform agenda sapping the momentum generated by prince mohammed s dramatic vision announcement in that helped propel him to power in the world s top oil exporter
the problem is the more it gets delayed and the more there s not clarity on why it s getting delayed and what the issues are the more it undermines confidence said james dorsey a senior fellow at singapore s rajaratnam school of international studies
he s been very good at creating expectations but not as good at managing expectations said dorsey
industry sources told reuters this week that both the international and domestic legs of the ipo had been postponed indefinitely
energy minister khalid said the government remained committed to conducting the ipo at an unspecified date in the future
the reform process has to be judged on its entirety and over a period of years but this will negatively affect perceptions of its credibility overall considering that the ipo was promised in such terms said richard segal senior analyst at manulife asset management in london
graphic saudi finances and oil price prince mohammed launched his vision programme with promises to fundamentally transform saudi arabia s economy and open up its people s cloistered lifestyles
he has implemented a series of reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom
but those moves have been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on dissent a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges and a costly war in yemen now in its fourth year
the crown prince s increasingly aggressive stance towards iran and in relations with supposed friends such as canada and germany has unnerved allies and investors alike
the aramco ipo was supposed to be an example of a new global level of transparency
perhaps because there s so much going on and so little explained it looks like they ve gotten worse at transparency said a former senior western diplomat
but some bankers said the reform programme was far bigger than the aramco ipo and despite the possible political fallout many changes could still go ahead or even accelerate now that senior officials are no longer preoccupied by listing aramco
the reality is there is a lot of other stuff that the authorities could do before doing this huge move of the aramco ipo said a senior banker whose institution pitched to help arrange the sale
riyadh s circumstances have improved greatly since plans for the ipo were first announced in
oil was about a barrel at the time and the government was desperate for cash
oil prices have more than doubled since and the state budget deficit has narrowed sharply so riyadh has more room to find other ways to finance projects
msci and ftse russell decided this year to add saudi arabia to their emerging market equity indexes so even without the ipo the kingdom can expect an inflow of billion billion or more of foreign funds next year
meanwhile the authorities are proceeding slowly with other reforms to attract foreign direct investment fdi
in july riyadh published draft rules for partnerships between the state and private firms to build infrastructure
last week the kingdom s water utility said it was talking to international companies about involving them in water distribution and treatment
in addition to aramco authorities have said they aim to sell another billion billion worth of state assets in the coming years
while many analysts say this looks ambitious freezing the aramco ipo may clear the way for smaller sales to go ahead
the ipo always had important symbolic value but would not have affected the rest of the saudi economy very much said steffen hertog associate professor at the london school economics and political science and a leading scholar on saudi arabia
challenges like private job creation for saudis and improving the legal and regulatory environment for local and foreign investors are more important for kingdom s economic health he said
graphic saudi economic growth while prince mohammed put the value of a percent stake in saudi aramco at about billion analysts reckon the ipo would have only raised some billion to billion as the prince s valuation was
the money would have gone to the government s public investment fund pif largely to fund projects creating jobs
with unemployment among saudi citizens officially at a record percent finding ways to boost employment is seen as vital
but even without the ipo those projects could still go ahead because aramco said in july it may buy a strategic stake in petrochemicals maker saudi basic industries sabic from pif potentially giving the fund as much money as the ipo
at market prices the sale of the pif s entire percent stake in sabic to saudi aramco would raise about billion
if the pif can create jobs suspending the aramco sale may even prove politically positive for prince mohammed because some saudis were uncomfortable with the ipo
the average citizen saw it as a misguided of the national patrimony
many saudi royals worried it would expose their source of wealth and privilege said jim krane fellow for energy studies at rice university s baker institute
so there is probably some level of relief in saudi arabia that the state is backing away from the additional reporting by rania el gamal editing by david clarke
