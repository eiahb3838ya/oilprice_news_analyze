survivors of last major islamic state battle in iraq beg for food
mosul iraq reuters on a scorching august afternoon an angry crowd besieged a loaded with meat of two slaughtered cows amidst the ruins of what was the last islamic state is bastion in mosul
in a desperate scramble they grabbed beef from a man standing in the open back of the truck and after it pulled away some stayed on to descend on the next one to arrive
part of an annual ritual of eid celebrations the deliveries did little to satisfy people living in the rubble of mosul s old city more than a year after is was ousted in a final battle reduced many inhabitants to homeless beggars
there are many residents who need aid in getting food and rebuilding their houses ali sharif said on thursday after taking a plastic bag with meat from one of the cars
everyone here was affected by since iraqi forces celebrated victory over is life for the sunni muslim inhabitants of ancient west mosul some of whom welcomed is s arrival in has hardly improved
that has left them no happier with the shi government in baghdad they long accused of treating them like citizens
we will give this to the poor people here to help them and we ask god to bless us
our government doesn t do anything to help them ali aga a local logistics specialist said as he headed into a labyrinth of alleyways in mosul s ancient old city to knock on doors and hand over packets of fresh beef
many of the old city s narrow streets remain inundated by wreckage left by the air strikes of coalition forces that helped iraqi government forces drive out is after nine months of devastating urban warfare
the remains of some walls look like they are about to collapse
decayed body parts can still be seen and smelled amidst the debris where the most severe fighting raged west of the river tigris that bisects iraq s second city
to help towns laid to waste in fighting that broke is s grip on a third of iraq baghdad set up the reconstruction fund for areas affected by terroristic operations refaato
the reconstruction plan for mosul and the whole of surrounding nineveh governorate targeted projects for worth billion iraqi dinars million supplemented by a million loan from germany according to refaato figures published on
but experts say rebuilding mosul alone which had a population of million and now has homeless is expected to cost billions of dollars
low budgets compared to size of damage pose a major challenge refaato said in a statement this month
in early august hazem mohammed and his family returned to a heap of debris that used to be his home next to a heavily damaged former football field a few minutes walk from deserted ruins still reeking of unrecovered human remains
mohammed settled down in a tent pitched outside his old house affording his family a little shade in the celsius summer heat
on thursday his wife boiled water on an open fire outside the tent with small children playing inside
i decided to live with my family in this tent to encourage the iraqi government and humanitarian organizations to rebuild my house and other destroyed houses in the old city he said
we are a poor family
we don t have money to live in dignity
we suffer from lack of food and we don t have enough furniture because it is under the ruins of our house a passing car stopped at the tent and the driver who gave his name as mohammed saleh handed out a bag of eid meat
i m afraid that the government s failure to rebuild infrastructure could bring a return of extremism saleh said
mosul municipal officials and western donors are concerned that the slowness of reconstruction might rekindle ite sectarian grievances that islamic state exploited
even a walk through an upscale district of eastern mosul which escaped the worst fighting and where life has largely returned to bustling normality can be dangerous
an explosion on tuesday night in the hay neighbourhood injured no one but left a roadside crater next to what residents said was the makeshift grave of an is militant killed in battle
the blast might have been an old grenade or part of the militant s suicide vest one resident suggested
