special report-morales, indigenous icon, loses support among bolivia's native people
charagua bolivia reuters in years as president of south america s poorest country evo morales has accomplished many of the goals he set forth when he became the first indigenous person to lead bolivia
the leftist and former coca farmer has presided over an economy that has grown by an annual average of percent since he took office more than twice the rate for all of latin america
after nationalizing the country s bounteous natural gas reserves he pursued economic policies and invested export revenue in social programs that helped lift more than two million people nearly a fifth of the population from poverty
with a new constitution in he even changed the name of the country from the republic of bolivia to the plurinational state of bolivia reflecting diverse ethnicities that for centuries had felt like citizens
for bolivia s more than million indigenous people support for morales appeared to pay off
the poverty rate dropped from percent in to percent last year
access for indigenous communities to electricity sewerage and water service all grew according to the world bank
here in charagua in the country s remote southern lowlands guarani people recently dissolved the local municipality and launched bolivia s first experiment in autonomous government
the move made possible by the new constitution is meant to replace distant homogenous rule with policies tailored to the local indigenous reality
yet here and across bolivia indigenous people are increasingly turning against evo as the morales is known
the dissatisfaction over everything from proposed development of indigenous lands to his successful gambit to end term limits is marring what had been widespread acclaim for a leader emblematic to first peoples movements worldwide
his way of thinking and his actions aren t indigenous said gualberto cusi a former judge and ethnic aymara an influential andean tribe from which morales himself also hails
cusi who was barred from the constitutional court by congress last year after disagreements with the government now leads a group of indigenous dissidents
many aymara have flourished under morales rule
building upon a long history selling textiles along lake titicaca they now thrive in commerce like importing chinese electronics they sell as far afield as the amazon rainforest
but even they are increasingly fed up
he should go said joaquin quispe a cook whose aymara family moved from bolivia s interior to el alto a city where a swelling indigenous influx in recent years made it outgrow nearby la paz the country s administrative centre
what particularly bothers some are moves by morales using supporters in congress and the judiciary to consolidate power
although his own constitution set a limit of two terms morales asked voters in a referendum to let him run again in
when they said no morales convinced the constitutional court to let him anyway
the court consisting of jurists nominated by congressional allies ruled that term limits are a violation of his human morales spokeswoman gisela lopez declined to make the president available for an interview and didn t respond to requests for comment for this story
a close ally former senate president jose gringo gonzales said morales hasn t abandoned indigenous peoples but has evolved as president to represent and work with everyone
he can sit for one minute with a businessman and the next with a worker said gonzales who stepped down from the senate last week for undisclosed reasons
he still has the humility and simplicity that were highlighted when he took morales is now the longest consecutively serving head of state in the americas
he is the sole leader remaining from a wave of leftists including venezuela s hugo chavez and luiz inacio lula da silva of brazil who dominated latin american politics early this century
his name which graces schools stadiums and cultural centres is increasingly voiced in street protests and scrawled in graffiti
all over the divided country bolivia said no sprayings compete with evo yes signs painted by supporters of his party movement toward socialism or mas
morales won t go before voters again until late next year
and the opposition remains fragmented meaning no other leader in bolivia as yet compares in political stature
still in a july poll commissioned by newspaper pagina siete support for the president among likely voters fell to percent from percent last november
a survey by pollster ipsos this week showed a similar level of support at percent of likely voters with a drop over the past year in his approval rating now at percent
over the past eight months reuters travelled across bolivia to better understand the waning support for the president among indigenous peoples
from his native altiplano the high arid plateau home to the aymara to lowlands where the government has authorized extraction on indigenous lands many native bolivians say they no longer feel represented by morales
for many the years following morales s election were marked by jubilation and hope
before his official inauguration in january aymara maestros or ritual leaders held their own ceremony at the site of tiwanaku west of la paz
morales in a traditional red tunic climbed the akapana pyramid where shamans presided over a fire ritual and presented him with a staff symbolizing his right to lead the assembled tribes
today begins a new era for the native peoples of the world morales said
tens of thousands of indigenous activists along with native delegations from as far away as chile and the united states cheered
within months he began asserting his plans to decolonize bolivia and give locals more voice in government and a greater share of national wealth
on may labor day he ordered troops to occupy natural gas fields and nationalized all hydrocarbons
the time has come the day a historic day for bolivia to retake absolute control of our natural resources he said in a speech while surrounded by soldiers at an oil field operated by petroleo brasileiro or petrobras the brazilian energy company
morales began renegotiating energy contracts for a bigger share of the profits a move that ultimately many companies agreed to
the negotiations earned him plaudits from supporters and boosted government revenues at a time when gas prices were soaring
with the windfalls morales enacted measures including school vouchers for kids and pensions for workers who had never held formal employment
for the business of governance morales appointed women indigenous peoples and labour leaders to his cabinet
he embraced organizations and forged a unity pact comprising leaders of andean lowland and amazon tribes
together they helped draft the new constitution approved by percent of bolivians in a referendum
that year in a landslide morales won a second term
tensions with indigenous groups first emerged in
enjoying what by then was steadily improving economic growth morales proposed a road through the isiboro secure indigenous territory or tipnis a refuge in the amazon
the highway morales argued was necessary to bring basic services to remote tribes
but native groups and environmentalists were enraged
the road they argued more likely would facilitate drug trafficking illegal logging and other unwanted activity
protesters marched for more than a month during which police and demonstrators clashed in clouds of tear gas and flurries of rubber bullets
when evo took office we thought indigenous people would never have to march again said adolfo chavez a native tacana and former president of the confederation of indigenous people of bolivia or cidob a grouping of lowland tribes
the marching succeeded at least for a time
that september morales halted work on the road for further study
but relations with some native groups were damaged
two major indigenous rights organizations cidob and the national council of ayllus and markas of qullasuyu left the unity pact
since then the split has widened into divisions that fall along political lines not rivalries among bolivia s three dozen ethnicities
soon government supporters began to pressure both groups using mas loyalists to stage what some members described as coups within the organizations
politics and loyalty to morales began to matter more than the indigenous cause they said
cidob leader chavez was voted out in
chavez who left bolivia and now lives in peru says he was a victim of political persecution for leading the tipnis demonstrations
pedro vare cidob s current leader in local media has continued to back morales and criticise the protesters
reuters was unable to reach vare for an interview
one rainy evening in december mas activists broke down the door of the la paz headquarters of conamaq as the other indigenous rights group is known
once inside they forced members some of whom were visiting la paz from remote regions and living there during their stay to leave
we had nowhere to go recalls cristobal salles an aymara and quechua speaker who was a conamaq councilman and now farms potatoes
dissent at both groups vanished
hilarion mamani a quechua who led the conamaq takeover told reuters a purge had been necessary
using a charge long wielded against opponents by some leftists in latin america mamani said previous leaders were acting on behalf of north american now he added there are no that s because most of the previous members went on to form dissident indigenous groups
those groups have campaigned to enforce presidential term limits and against renewed efforts to build the tipnis road and other projects on native lands
in morales began his sustained effort to stay in power
despite the constitutional limit of two terms morales argued that his first administration shouldn t be counted because he had been elected under a previous constitution
in the constitutional court by then composed mostly of judges nominated by allies of morales in congress he found a sympathetic audience
except for one justice cusi the fellow aymara who at that time sat on the court
cusi sought a strict interpretation of the charter and argued against another term
but the other judges prevailed
morales ran for and with percent of the vote won a third term starting in january
before long relations with native groups grew worse still
in february a government comptroller discovered a million million shortfall in a state fund for indigenous projects finding records of initiatives that had been funded but never carried out
two of morales former rural development ministers were convicted of misusing public funds and served brief jail terms
some onetime morales supporters were outraged
it seems corruption has been institutionalized edwin prada a lawyer and former advisor to conamaq said in an interview
morales in public comments has said the fund was poorly run
reuters couldn t reach either of the two former ministers for comment
that year natural gas prices fell from a peak in
the country s economy while still healthier than that of many neighbours cooled
criticism of morales and his party grew
in march residents of el alto formerly a bastion of morales support handed mas its first big electoral defeat
they voted out the city s mas mayor who had polarized local voters because of municipal spending and elected soledad chapeton an aymara from a party who became the city s first female mayor
morales meanwhile kept working to prolong his own mandate first through the failed referendum and then through another plea to the constitutional court
by last year the court was firmly allied with morales
after opposing other government initiatives cusi the aymara judge was impeached by the senate
the day before the may ruling cusi donned chains in front of government headquarters and scoffed at what he considered his foregone ouster
lord king evo morales he said before television cameras order your puppet senators to condemn officially cusi was accused of failing to fulfil duties
but many government critics called his removal political
they found a pretext to oust me cusi told reuters
now the head of a conamaq breakaway group cusi recently announced he would seek the office of attorney general
with the to pursue a fourth term morales stoked even more ire
early last year students at the public university of el alto a bastion of political activism began demonstrating for more educational funding
the ruling on term limits sparked further discontent fuelling demonstrations that continued into this year
in a clash with police one student died
police said the student jonathan quispe was killed when students hurled marbles
university officials said he was shot by police
reuters couldn t independently determine what led to quispe s death
last august congress approved a project to restart the tipnis highway
other construction projects are also drawing fire
at a cost to taxpayers of million morales last year inaugurated a museum with large modern windows in orinoca the remote altiplano town where he grew up herding llamas
the museum of the democratic and cultural revolution tells bolivia s recent history through morales own achievements
this month morales presided over the opening of a new presidential palace in la paz
he calls the million building the big house of the the projects some critics say are further proof morales lost touch
he always said he would consult the people said salles the former conamaq leader
now he doesn in charagua the lowland guarani region residents are struggling with autonomy
one recent afternoon locals at a school auditorium hashed through problems now plaguing their experiment the first of three autonomous regions approved by voters recently
charagua roughly the size of panama in the was the site of successful resistance against paraguayan invaders who sought to seize area gas reserves
despite having gas however charagua remains poor accessible only by dirt roads
the regional budget financed in part by la paz remains the roughly million it was before autonomy
but locals say the national government has all but abandoned them otherwise
we are worse than before said one resident who identified himself as victor before storming out of the auditorium
i want a recall on this reuters was unable to reach the morales cabinet official in charge of indigenous autonomy
guarani leaders there said they too are unhappy
ramiro lucas a leader of a southern portion of charagua lamented that the region recently had to halt school breakfasts because money was needed for health centres
now we have land but what good is that if we don t have resources he told reuters
