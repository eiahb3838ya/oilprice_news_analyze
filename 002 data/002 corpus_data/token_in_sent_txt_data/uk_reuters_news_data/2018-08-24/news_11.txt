fighting to survive: noble group's fate hangs on investors restructuring vote
singapore reuters noble group ltd faces a shareholders meeting on monday as investors vote on a billion debt restructuring plan that its creditors and board say is vital to prevent insolvency
the company once a global commodity trader with ambitions to rival glencore or vitol has shrunk to an business focused on coal and freight trading after it slashed hundreds of jobs and sold prized assets to cut debt
noble whose market value has been nearly wiped out from billion in february is expected to win the required simple majority of voters in attendance at the meeting said multiple sources familiar with the matter
equity owners include china investment corp and abu dhabi fund goldilocks investment co noble did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the vote
noble already has majority support from its creditors and the backing of percent of its shareholders such as founder richard elman who stepped down as chairman last year
under the swap it plans to halve its debt after surrendering percent of control to its senior creditors mainly made up of hedge funds while existing shareholders stakes will dwindle to percent and its management would get percent
the expectation is for the restructuring to be passed as noble needs a simple majority at the meeting said neel gopalakrishnan credit strategist at dbs group
it would come as a big surprise if it doesn t come noble s accounting came under scrutiny in february when a former employee arnaud vagner started to publish reports anonymously under the name of iceberg research alleging noble inflated the prices of derivative contracts the company held to appear more profitable
noble has always stood by its accounts
as noble s shares and bonds plunged after the allegations the company lost its investment grade rating took billions of dollars in impairment losses and lost access to funding
it also changed its chief executive officers
graphic the rise fall of noble group desperate to slash debt noble sold a string of assets but this was not enough to run a trading business where profit margins are tiny
it posted a record billion loss for and then defaulted on its debt in march
it s just impossible in commodity trading to operate with so high interest costs
it is what people are once again going to realise vagner told reuters referring to the restructured noble
is the new team more competent than the previous one
no it s the same
the share price is down percent with this management he said by email
noble s restructuring plan gained ground in june after it won over a key shareholder with a sweetened offer
if noble does not obtain shareholders approval it will seek to implement a similar restructuring to keep the firm as a going concern but that plan does not provide for shareholders to receive any equity in the new company
analysts are still wary of the new company s prospects
while its current debt problems will be temporarily fixed it will need ready access to trade financing which is critical to its business said brayan lai analyst at bondcritic who publishes on independent research platform smartkarma
noble s ability to make profits on a sustainable basis would be the main challenge for its remaining business said annisa lee head of asia s flow credit analysis at nomura
