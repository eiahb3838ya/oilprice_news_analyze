eu set to end chinese solar panel import controls in september
brussels reuters the european union will scrap import controls on solar panels and cells from china in september rejecting a request from eu producers who argue that the bloc will be opening its doors to a flood of dumped products
the european commission which coordinates eu trade policy proposed dismissing the request for an expiry review and received backing from a majority of the eu s countries according to eu sources familiar with the discussions
the european union first imposed and measures for chinese solar panels wafers and cells in and extended them in march by months signalling that they should then end
chinese manufacturers are allowed to sell solar products in europe free of duties if they do so at or above a minimum price that has progressively declined
if sold for less than that price they are subject to duties of up to percent
the european union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of eu manufacturers and those such as importers and installers pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation
it has also been concerned about the response from beijing given the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in
eu prosun the grouping of eu producers that launched the initial complaint in had said there were good reasons for measures to be prolonged
beijing s decision to limit installations meant chinese producers had some gigawatts of excess capacity to shift with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the united states and planned by india the second and third largest markets behind china
the total eu market is some gigawatts
only the eu is at the same time irresponsibly dropping all measures and inviting chinese producers to eliminate european and competition in the eu market eu prosun president milan nitzschke said adding some companies were considering a legal challenge at the european court of justice
solarpower europe which represents those in the solar industry opposed to duties has referred to commission and ey studies indicating demand could increase by up to percent creating about jobs if the measures were removed
