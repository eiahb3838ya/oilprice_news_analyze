exclusive-petrobras oilfield gets bids from petrorio, karoon energy -sources
rio de janeiro reuters brazil s petrorio sa and australia s karoon energy ltd are among the bidders for a mature shallow water oilfield owned by petroleo brasileiro sa according to two sources speaking on condition of anonymity as the oil major marches ahead with an ambitious divestment program
with oil production of about barrels per day the bauna field in brazil s santos basin is among the largest mature production assets in petrobras billion divestment portfolio
while the sources did not disclose a potential value petrorio had previously placed a bid of about million for bauna in that was ultimately unsuccessful
oil prices have increased moderately since then
the slightly more productive pampo and enchova clusters in the adjacent campos basin which are being sold together were seen as fetching bids of around billion in june
karoon and petrobras declined to comment
petrorio did not respond to a request for comment
one of the sources said that other bidders were involved in the auction which closed late last year and it was possible neither petrorio nor karoon would emerge as the winner for the concession set to last through
petrobras could enter exclusive talks with one of the bidders in a matter of weeks the sources said
this is the second time petrorio and karoon have attempted to purchase bauna
karoon had entered into exclusive negotiations in to purchase bauna as well as the tartaruga verde field which has recently started producing though that process was scuttled following a court injunction
karoon at that time beat out petrorio s million bid which was geared strictly toward bauna
for petrorio the asset fits well with the independent oil firm s strategy of acquiring stakes in mature oil fields to boost their productivity
for karoon which has said that it remains interested in bauna the asset would present significant synergies with its nearby kangaroo and echidna oil discoveries
petrobras is cutting its stakes in shallow water and mature fields to refocus its efforts on brazil s promising deepwater play
there is some legal uncertainty hanging over the bauna divestiture
in december a supreme court justice suspended sales of exploration and production assets by petrobras but the company later said it believed that decision applied only to processes begun in may or later
