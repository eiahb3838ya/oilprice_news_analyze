oil shipments from georgia's batumi port drop 51 pct in 2018
tbilisi jan reuters oil and shipments from georgia s black sea port of batumi fell percent in from a year earlier an official at a terminal at the port said on thursday
some crude oil was to the pipeline and to the caspian pipeline consortium last year the official added while some fuel oil was sent to the port of taman in russia and georgia s other black sea port of kulevi
the fall in shipments is partly because azerbaijan prefers to send its oil through the pipeline or via its own terminal in kulevi rather than from batumi which is operated by a kazakh company
shipments of crude oil and refined oil products from batumi totalled million tonnes last year down from million tonnes in said the official who asked not to be identified
in december overall shipments were tonnes compared with tonnes the previous month and tonnes in december
some volumes have been to other routes last year the official said
