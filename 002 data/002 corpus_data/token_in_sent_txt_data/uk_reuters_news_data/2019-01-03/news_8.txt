india's top court says "every second counts" for miners trapped for 3 weeks
new delhi reuters india s supreme court on thursday ordered the government to list the steps it plans for the rescue of at least miners trapped in a coal mine for three weeks in a remote hilly state warning that every second counts
the workers were ensnared on when the illegal mine in the northeastern state of meghalaya was flooded
rescuers have so far only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground
the country s top court wondered why attempts to reach the miners had not yet been successful
tell us by tomorrow because for people who are trapped every second counts justice arjan kumar sikri told the federal government represented by tushar mehta
the meghalaya government told the court that nearly people were working on the rescue effort since including employees of coal india ltd the world s biggest miner of the fuel
kyrmen shylla meghalaya s disaster management minister told reuters both government and private agencies had been involved in the bid to reach the miners many of whose family members have given up hope
mining has killed thousands of workers in meghalaya including children before india s environmental court banned the practice in early
at its peak the state produced coal worth billion a year or about a tenth of india s total production
despite the ban many mines continued operatihere requiring workers often children to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow horizontal seams
the unsuccessful rescue bid has drawn criticism of a lack of urgency shown by government agencies particularly given the remote location of the mine a journey to which can take more than five hours from the nearest commercial airport in guwahati
would we have cared more if the miners had not been at the fringes of national consciousness in the northeast senior journalist vir sanghvi asked on twitter
i have not given up hope but our response to this crisis shames us as a additional reporting by zarir hussain in guwahati writing by krishna das editing by clarence fernandez
