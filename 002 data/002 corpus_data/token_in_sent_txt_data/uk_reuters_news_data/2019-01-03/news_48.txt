concerns grew about income inequality poor productivity and rural areas of advanced economies by economic and social changes
by the end of the year commentators as well as politicians were invoking nationalism patriotism and a bigger role for democratic governments as part of a broad backlash against unaccountable multilateralism
technology became something to be feared for its negative impact on existing industries rather than a positive force for productivity and social and economic change
journalists and politicians focused on the disruptive effect of internet platforms social media data collection and artificial intelligence on incumbent businesses and workers now also including professionals
social media was blamed for intensifying political polarisation and spreading propaganda rather than hailed as an agent for reform and democratisation with growing calls for government regulation of various platforms
china s leading technology exporters zte and huawei bore the brunt of a backlash as the worries about technology intersected concerns about the security of global supply chains
surveillance and hacking by russia china iran north korea saudi arabia israel and the united states among others along with private security companies and criminal organisations added to the jittery mood

italy elected an avowedly populist government determined to confront the eu while there were concerns about judicial independence press freedom and authoritarianism in parts of eastern europe
voters continued to desert moderate and politicians to back parties and movements with more radical agendas leading to fears about the eu s future direction stability and cohesion

south korea s index which is heavily exposed to world trade ended down percent in its worst performance since may
despite the worries world trade has held up reasonably well so far with volumes up percent in the three months from august to october compared with the same period a year earlier
growth has moderated but is not yet showing the sharp slowdown anticipated by global equity markets
however some indicators paint a gloomier picture
in hong kong the world s busiest air freight hub seen as a leading indicator for world trade air freight volumes fell percent in the period compared with a year earlier the worst performance since april
china s economy also appears to have been slowing since the middle of squeezed by tighter credit the tariffs imposed by the united states and an increasingly uncertain outlook for exporters
the country s manufacturers reported a significant decline in business activity in december with the composite purchasing managers index falling to just its lowest level since february and below the threshold dividing economic expansion from contraction
mirroring the slide in global equity markets brent crude futures ended the year almost percent lower the worst performance since june and the calendar spread remains in a small but significant contango
most traders expect the oil market to remain modestly oversupplied in as worries about the impact of a slowing economy on consumption outweigh the impact of production cuts by opec and its allies
