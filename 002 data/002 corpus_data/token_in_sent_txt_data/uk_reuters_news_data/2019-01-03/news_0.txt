graphic china pmi vs iron ore coal prices by clyde russell launceston australia jan reuters the slump in china s purchasing managers index pmi is likely to prove an unwelcome new year s gift to the world s major exporters of bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal
the manufacturing gauge compiled by beijing s national bureau of statistics dropped to in december dropping below the that demarcates growth from contraction for the first time since july
the outcome was also below the median forecast in a survey of analysts and the weakest reading since in almost three years
the problem for iron ore and coal producers shipping to the world s biggest commodity importer is that the pmi has a strong correlation to prices once a lag of a month or two is factored in
the chinese pmi showed a solid uptrend from july to a peak of in september a period that coincided with gains for the prices of iron ore and thermal coal
iron ore with a iron content for delivery to china as assessed by argus media almost doubled in price from june to a peak of a tonne in february
thermal coal at australia s newcastle port as assessed by argus media also enjoyed a strong run from june to november of that year more than doubling to reach a peak of a tonne
both coal and iron ore reverted to the usual seasonal pattern of peaks in the northern hemisphere winter and troughs in the summer but prices remained above the lows
a slowing in the chinese pmi to in february was matched by lower iron ore and coal prices by march
but a recovery in the pmi to by may saw iron ore prices stabilise and coal prices regain strength
the issue for iron ore and coal exporters such as australia brazil indonesia and south africa is that the chinese pmi is now in an established downtrend having peaked in may last year and fallen every month since apart from a slight bump in august
iron ore and coal have both managed to hold up relatively well in that period especially considering the rout in other commodities such as crude oil
newcastle coal did retreat from its high of a tonne reached in july last year but it only fell as far as in late november and has since then actually managed to move higher to in the week ended
iron ore in contrast to the pmi climbed for most of the second half of reaching as high as a tonne in early november before dropping to by the end of the month
however since then similar to coal iron ore has managed to stage a little rally closing at a tonne on wednesday
there are drivers of the iron ore and coal price that can outweigh a correlation with the pmi
these include winter peak demand for coal and restocking by steel mills ahead of the lifting of china s winter pollution controls
but it also appears that for iron ore and coal much of the recent resilience in prices is built on the hope that beijing will open the stimulus taps and boost and industries such as infrastructure and construction
the optimistic view in the market is that the authorities will do what is necessary to ensure that economic growth remains above percent in china a level that seems to be taking on some sort of iconic status as a line in the sand that beijing will defend even at the risk of creating more credit problems from unrestrained spending
it may yet be the case that china does successfully stimulate its economy or it may get a boost if its trade dispute with the united states is resolved in the coming months
but unless there is some evidence to back up the optimistic scenario iron ore and coal prices would seem increasingly likely to weaken in line with the pmi
