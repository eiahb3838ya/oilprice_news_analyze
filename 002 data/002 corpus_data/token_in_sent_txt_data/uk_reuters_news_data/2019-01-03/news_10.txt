update 2-socalgas extends natgas conservation request during cold snap
new throughout adds details jan reuters southern california s gas utility on thursday extended its request for consumers to reduce natural gas use through the weekend to avoid straining the system as cold weather lingers over the area
regional gas supplies were expected to remain tight this winter due to limitations on several southern california gas co socalgas pipelines and reduced availability of the utility s biggest storage field at aliso canyon in los angeles following a massive leak between october and february
socalgas a unit of california energy company sempra energy said it pulled gas from all four of its storage fields during the cold this week including aliso canyon
when aliso canyon returned to service after the leak the state mandated the facility was only to be used as an asset of last resort to maintain system reliability after other storage facilities and pipelines have been exhausted
without withdrawals from aliso canyon increased demand may have resulted in further curtailments to customers socalgas said in a customer notice
customers include electric generators and some large industrial businesses
the national weather service issued a freeze warning for some inland cities in southern california like riverside
in addition to asking consumers to reduce gas used to heat homes and businesses socalgas also extended a voluntary curtailment notice to electric generators from wednesday through friday
consumer gas demand was expected to reach billion cubic feet bcf on thursday bcf on friday and bcf on saturday and sunday after hitting bcf on wednesday
one billion cubic feet is enough to supply about million homes for a day
state agencies forecast socalgas pipelines and storage facilities could send out up to billion cubic feet per day bcfd this winter before the utility would have to tap aliso canyon according to a report in october
socalgas can get about bcfd from its pipes and the rest from storage depending on how many pipeline outages and reductions the utility is able to fix according to a state report
if needed aliso canyon can deliver around bcfd
but like all storage facilities the amount of gas it can deliver will decline rapidly as pressure in the cavern decreases when the utility pulls fuel out
