renewables overtake coal as germany's main energy source
frankfurt reuters renewables overtook coal as germany s main source of energy for the first time last year accounting for just over percent of electricity production research showed on thursday
the shift marks progress as europe s biggest economy aims for renewables to provide percent of its energy by in a costly transition as it abandons nuclear power by and is devising plans for an orderly exit from coal
the research from the fraunhofer organization of applied science showed that output of solar wind biomass and hydroelectric generation units rose percent last year to produce terawatt hours twh of electricity
that was out of a total national power production of twh derived from both green and fossil fuels of which coal burning accounted for percent
green energy s share of germany s power production has risen from percent in and just percent in
bruno burger author of the fraunhofer study said it was set to stay above percent this year
we will not fall below the percent in because more renewable installations are being built and weather patterns will not change that dramatically he said
green power skeptics say that output merely reflects favorable weather patterns and does not prove the sector s contribution to secure energy supplies
solar power increased by percent to twh due to a prolonged hot summer while installed capacity expanded by gigawatts gw to gw last year according to the fraunhofer data
the wind power industry produced twh from combined onshore and offshore capacity of just under gw constituting percent of total german power output
wind power was the biggest source of energy after domestically mined brown coal power which accounted for percent
coal plants run on imported hard coal contributed twh or percent of the total
hydropower only accounted for percent of power production at twh as extreme summer heat dried out rivers and was accompanied by low rainfall
biomass output contributed percent
plants accounted for percent of the total nuclear energy for percent with the remainder coming from oil and waste burning
germany was a net exporter of twh of power in mostly to the netherlands while importing big volumes from france
