catch them young: indian writers tell tales of land rights for kids
mumbai jan thomson reuters foundation deadly disputes over land and indigenous rights are not obvious themes for children s books but indian writers are using conflicts to help the next generation understand their impact on communities across the country
i will save my land by rinchin is about the impact of coal mining on a village while siddhartha sarma s year of the weeds novel for young adults is based on a successful fight to save indigenous land from a mining company
when people are displaced from their land children are also affected but perhaps no one explains it to them said rinchin who goes by one name and published her book last year
in rinchin s picture book a little girl named mati asks her father and grandmother for her own piece of land in the field where they work
she tends to her plot until she hears that they will lose their land to a coal mine
it is a common occurrence said rinchin in the central indian state of chhattisgarh where coal mining has forced tens of thousands of farmers off their land many of whom are adivasis or indigenous people
while indigenous people have customary rights over ancestral land and forests the state can acquire the land for infrastructure and development projects
those displaced are rarely consulted or compensated activists say
last week in a rare move the newly elected government in chhattisgarh said it would give back land taken from indigenous farmers for a steel plant more than a decade ago but never used
an adivasi s right over land is so tenuous it can be taken away at any time by the government or an person said rinchin whose books are also translated into regional languages
the story also highlights the role of caste and gender in land rights issues she said
women do so much of the work but have so little say rinchin told the thomson reuters foundation
women make up nearly half the agricultural labour in india yet own less than percent of its farmland according to the think tank national council of applied economic research
about disputes over land have forced millions of people from their farms across india according to the research organisation land conflict watch
movies and children s books are focusing on such issues that bollywood films and mass paperbacks generally ignore
in year of the weeds also published last year sarma tells the story of the dongria kondh tribe in odisha state which managed to stop vedanta resources from mining bauxite in the sacred niyamgiri hills
residents of villages whose opinion the state sought for a court order in unanimously voted against allowing mining
it was a rare positive story and i decided to write it for teenagers because i still have hope that the younger generation will engage with these issues and grow up to be kinder gentler more humane citizens said sarma
