update 2-u.s., russian officials discuss sanctions, russian gas pipeline plans
washington reuters russian energy minister alexander novak said on tuesday he discussed sanctions on russia and moscow s plan to expand its nord stream gas pipeline to germany which has irked washington in talks with treasury and energy secretaries
russia is one of the world s biggest crude oil and natural gas producers and the united states has been urging global energy producers to boost output to stem an increase in prices
we met
we discussed energy issues among other things
we touched upon questions related to sanctions novak said of his meeting with treasury secretary steven mnuchin at a press briefing in washington
we can t sidestep these difficult questions so of course we touched upon them during our novak said other discussions with energy secretary rick perry covered russia s nord stream undersea gas pipeline
plans to double the capacity of the pipeline to billion cubic meters per year have riled both washington and brussels which is trying to cut its reliance on energy supplies from russia
washington believes the pipeline would give russia which has at times frozen deliveries to parts of europe over pricing disputes more power over the region and the administration of president donald trump has followed that of barack obama in opposing the nord stream project
the planned volumes are more than half of russian total gas exports to europe which is seen reaching a record high of bcm this year
the move to expand the pipeline is also designed to bypass ukraine the main route of russian gas exports to europe
novak said politics should not be allowed to intrude into discussion of the nord stream project which stood on its own economic merits
the implementation of such infrastructure projects has to be built on the economic basis without any political evaluation of this project novak said after his meetings
the meetings took place while energy executives and ministers from around the globe converged on washington for the triennial world gas conference the industry s biggest summit
the congress has imposed economic sanctions in recent months against russia that among other things seek to prevent companies from participating in russian pipeline projects or oil and gas development efforts
the sanctions were designed to punish russia for its annexation of crimea from ukraine and for meddling in the presidential election
moscow denies it interfered in the election
russia depends heavily on pipeline networks to get its energy production to european markets and is also keen to develop energy reserves in its arctic
novak has said in the past that the united states should not be permitted to impose such sanctions without a vote of the united nations security council of which russia is a permanent member
the united states has been urging increased supply from the world s biggest producers including opec members to help stem an increase in oil prices that threatens economic growth
it is also renewing sanctions against iran after abandoning a global deal meant to stem its nuclear ambitions and urging consumers of its oil to stop their imports completely another factor pushing up oil prices
perry told reporters on monday before meeting with novak that he was amenable to having conversations to creating a relationship with russia
he had invited me to actually to come visit some of the things that they are doing in the arctic perry said
i think we ve got our issues with russia but i m one of those that believe you need to be having conversations with folks and finding places that we can work additional reporting by polina ivanova and vladimir soldatkin in moscow editing by richard balmforth
