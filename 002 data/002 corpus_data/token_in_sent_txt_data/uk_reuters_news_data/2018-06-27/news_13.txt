update 1-minnesota pipeline foes pan route options for enbridge line 3
adds enbridge comment by rod nickel paul minnesota june reuters indigenous tribes and environmental groups took aim on wednesday at enbridge inc s preferred route for its rebuilt line oil pipeline while others panned all options ahead of an expected decision this week by a minnesota regulator to determine whether the project can proceed
enbridge wants to replace the aging km pipeline that runs from alberta canada to wisconsin
it needs approval from the minnesota public utilities commission which must decide whether the project is needed and the route
public scrutiny has focused on enbridge s preferred route which would follow line s existing corridor partway through minnesota before veering south to miss the leech lake reservation and avoid a nine to pipeline shutdown
an administrative law judge recommended in april that line follow the existing corridor instead
the commission this week has also unexpectedly looked at route alternatives
you may find that all of them suck said paul blackburn a lawyer for the activist group honor the earth
the sierra club environmental group echoed that view saying line should operate as is until regulators ultimately shut it down
enbridge s preferred route is a said david zoll a lawyer for the mille lacs indigenous band adding that the best solution might be more time to study alternatives
we should not feel compelled to make uninformed decisions he said
enbridge s favored route is by far the worst said seth bichler a lawyer for the fond du lac band
but leech lake said enbridge s preferred route is the best option as it means the pipeline will no longer bisect the reserve
line which began service in operates at half its capacity because of age and deterioration
its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of barrels per day
selecting a route is a tricky task for the commission which must balance concerns about indigenous wild rice harvesting areas and culturally important sites with possible construction delays and a pipeline shutdown that could harm refiners
enbridge lawyer christina brusven said there are few buildable alternatives because of tribal opposition
its preferred route twists and turns to avoid harming and culturally important sites she said
we think that is a testament to our engagement and this process brusven said
bottlenecks in alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude this year while refiners in minnesota and surrounding states say line is necessary to increase crude supplies
this is a very important project for canada canada s natural resources minister jim carr told reuters in washington we re very hopeful that there will be a positive but if three projects proceed the industry could soon see surplus capacity transporting canadian crude
line the trans mountain pipeline expansion and transcanada corp s keystone xl would raise canada s crude export capacity to million barrels per day from nearly million bpd in according to the canadian energy research institute ceri
canada s crude oil production is not forecast to reach million bpd until
retiree terry lamb a volunteer with activist group mn used to build pipelines for a living
now he opposes them first the dakota access pipeline in north dakota and now line
we don t want to take the chance of a spill lamb said
it s another big giant corporation rolling over everyday phillip wallace business representative for pipeliners union said its members will have to leave minnesota for work if the project is defeated
if this is shut down it would be another trophy for activists he said
but let s face it we need reporting by rod nickel in paul minnesota additional reporting by julie gordon in washington editing by david gregorio
