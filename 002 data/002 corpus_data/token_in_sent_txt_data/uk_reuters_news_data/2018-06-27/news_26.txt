westinghouse eyes saudi, india deals as end to bankruptcy nears
westinghouse sees no regulatory roadblocks to takeover brookfield to recapitalise the bankrupt reactor builder westinghouse resumes talks with india on deal company confident it will be on saudi tender shortlist by geert de clercq paris june reuters nuclear firm westinghouse expects to emerge from bankruptcy with sufficient equity in coming weeks and is targeting saudi arabia and india for new reactor sales its ceo said
canada s brookfield asset management in january agreed to buy westinghouse from toshiba for billion after cost overruns on reactors pushed the atomic energy pioneer into bankruptcy in march
westinghouse ceo jose gutierrez said the brookfield deal would close as soon as it had been approved by and british nuclear regulators and the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius
we are confident we will get those approvals in the next few weeks we don t see any roadblocks gutierrez told reuters at the world nuclear exhibition in paris
once the deal is closed westinghouse will officially emerge from bankruptcy and brookfield will recapitalise the firm
we will have the right capital structure and the necessary cash for running our business gutierrez said
the amount of money to be injected is under discussion
westinghouse hopes sales will get a boost when the first of four reactors in china starts up this year
gutierrez said fuel had been loaded in the haiyang reactor on tuesday and the sanmen reactor was waiting for permission to load fuel
the haiyang had finished hot functional testing and would be ready to load fuel soon he said
sanmen in zhejiang province loaded fuel in april ran its first nuclear reactions in june and is set for commercial operation by november chinese authorities said this month
contracts for the four reactors two at sanmen and two at haiyang in shandong province were signed in
the first one had been scheduled to launch in
gutierrez said chinese authorities expect two or maybe three will connect to the grid before end of
projects for six more in china are pending and westinghouse expects china will build a fleet of at least in the coming decade
as westinghouse has transferred the technology to china it will not benefit from new builds but expects to earn money on providing fuel and maintenance
about percent of westinghouse revenue comes from fuel and services only about percent from building new reactors
not having a working has hampered westinghouse and other vendors have won major tenders instead
this month russia s rosatom stole a march on westinghouse with a contract to sell four reactors
two of those will be built at xudaobao in northeast china on a site once earmarked for westinghouse
in april westinghouse received strong support from energy secretary rick perry for its plan to build six in india a massive project set in motion by a agreement years ago
but since toshiba will no longer act as master builder there are doubts about the plan
now that we are emerging from chapter we are resuming conversations with india gutierrez said
westinghouse is also waiting for saudi arabia to decide on a shortlist of two to three bidders to build two nuclear plants
besides westinghouse companies from russia france china and south korea are in the running
it is a reality that the other four bidders are countries and we are a private company gutierrez said adding that he was confident that westinghouse would be on the shortlist
the saudi authorities had been due to decide at the end of march
once the shortlist is made bidders will discuss business models and financing a process that will take at least another year before saudi arabia picks a winner
gutierrez said that during its bankruptcy westinghouse which sells services fuel and spare parts to almost percent of world s reactors had not lost a single contract
gutierrez had no news on toshiba s attempts to sell its nugen unit which has a project to build reactors in britain
westinghouse is also working on finalising two reactors in vogtle georgia by
two other under construction in the united states were abandoned as costs got out of hand
