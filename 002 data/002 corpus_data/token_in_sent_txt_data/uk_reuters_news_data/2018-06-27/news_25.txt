refile-feature-in hunt for clean jet fuel, south africa swaps tobacco for weeds
fixes typos in paras and by munyaradzi makoni cape town june thomson reuters foundation when a south african airways boeing took off from
tambo international airport in johannesburg two years ago headed for cape town it was powered by an unusual fuel tobacco
south africa hasn t yet repeated the jet biofuel feat but in an effort to cut its emissions and promote greener power the country s researchers are looking for innovative ways to manufacture green aviation fuel at larger scale
a new waste to wing project aims to one day produce a significant share of the country s aviation fuel from waste plants including invasive species
south africa produces a large amount of agricultural waste as well as waste from plantation forestry and waste biomass from alien vegetation clearing programmes said tjasa an energy economics and policy specialist for the world wide fund for nature wwf one of the groups involved in the biofuel push
so far the effort is a small proof of concept project likely to produce just enough jet biofuel for one more flight she said
but if the technology works production could be scaled up significantly perhaps to as much as percent of the aviation fuel used at johannesburg s international airport she said
finding clean fuel for planes ships and other forms of transport hard to plug into a clean energy grid remains one of the biggest challenges for reducing climate changing emissions
but as airlines face increasing pressure to become more sustainable countries around the world are trying to find solutions from hydrogen powered barges to in south africa s case planes that could fly on weeds
scaling up jet biofuel and making it cost effective hasn t been easy however
farmers in south africa s limpopo province today continue growing solaris a tobacco that produces large amounts of oil and that was used as a feedstock for the country s first flight
but there is no local refining capacity available and the sheer scale of farming needed to make the economies of scale work at this moment in time is difficult merel laroy a spokesman for skynrg a alternative jet fuel supplier told the thomson reuters foundation
one of the lessons learned she said is that making the biofuel locally is key
when there s no local production capacity the feedstock must be shipped out of the country and shipped back after refining
this makes the sustainable aviation fuel much more expensive she said
the waste to wing project with million in funding from the european union s switch africa green programme aims to solve that problem and cut costs and protect agricultural production and forests by using waste to create fuel
the effort a partnership by south african social enterprise fetola wwf and skynrg aims to create a clean jet fuel supply in south africa a country with a long history of developing and using alternative fuels
as part of the project small businesses will collect and supply the plant matter needed to make the biofuel an effort to create jobs in a country with one of the world s biggest unemployment rates
amanda dinan fetola s project manager said the businesses could use invasive plants collected in environmental restoration projects and currently simply stored or abandoned as the raw material for jet fuel
such stores of dried plants today can present a wildfire risk in a country suffering drought so are often purposely burned to avoid that risk she said
but the waste could provide jobs in its harvesting collection and transport dinan told the thomson reuters foundation
she and said no biomass will be produced for being converted to fuel
as the name suggests the waste to wing project will focus on waste biomass including leftovers from food and livestock feed production paper making and furniture production said
at the moment most of the agricultural waste produced in the country is burned she said
in some areas harvested invasive plants already are being used to produce charcoal or fibrous products such as coffins but most of the waste is unused she said and only that unused supply will be diverted to the jet fuel project
said the project was designed to stand up to worsening drought linked to climate change in southern africa and ensure land isn t used to make fuel instead
south africa still has large swathes of invasive plants to clear and the weeds are spreading faster than they can be cut back dinan said which means the jet fuel project could both aid that effort and is unlikely to run out of stock to make fuel
sampson mamphweli director of the centre for renewable and sustainable energy studies at stellenbosch university agreed the country has plenty of organic waste
whether they use organic waste or they plant the biomass for energy whichever way the project is worth investigating he said
one huge challenge with such projects is the cost of transporting plant waste so material would need to be sourced as close as possible to where jet biofuel is produced mamphweli said
and the cost of the actual biomass material is also a big factor he said
often a once useless and free material becomes valuable when there is a use for it he said
said it was too soon to get any real picture of how much of south africa s aviation fuel needs might be met by the project
but our previous research into biomass availability suggests that technically there could be enough biomass to meet percent of our aviation fuel demand she said
but under current technology the biofuel would need to be blended with conventional jet fuel meaning the waste technology could supply at best half of the country s needs she said
