update 1-imf board to consider bailout for congo republic on july 6
johannesburg reuters the executive board of the international monetary fund will examine opec member congo republic s request for a bailout on july according to an imf calendar seen by reuters on wednesday
like other central african oil producers congo has been hit hard by low crude prices and is struggling under the weight of over billion in debt equivalent to around percent of its gross domestic product
following a mission to congo in april an imf delegation said it had reached broad understandings on policies it could support within the framework of an arrangement under the fund s extended credit facility
however before it could submit a deal to the board the delegation said congo would need to fulfill conditions including making progress toward restructuring debt the fund considered unsustainable
congolese authorities are currently in talks with creditors including trading houses trafigura and glencore from which it has borrowed around billion
congo joined the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec last week as it moves ahead with new projects that could see it become africa s oil producer with a target of barrels per day this year
