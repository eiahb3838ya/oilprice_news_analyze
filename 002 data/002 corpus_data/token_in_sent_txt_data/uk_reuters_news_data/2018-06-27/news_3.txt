interview-chevron renewal of rokan block not assured - indonesia minister
washington reuters energy giant chevron corp must compete if it wants to continue operating indonesia s rokan block the country s biggest source of crude oil after its contract expires in indonesia energy and mines minister ignasius jonan said on wednesday
chevron asked indonesia s government earlier this year to extend its operating contract for rokan beyond and since then has been in discussions with indonesian officials on the issue
i just talked to chevron s new ceo and told him that it is up to him
if they propose to continue to operate the rokan block the economics have to be justifiable jonan told reuters on the sidelines of the world gas conference in washington
and they may face some competition as well from foreign operators and from pertamina he said referring to indonesia s state oil and gas company
michael wirth who has been with chevron since became ceo in february
a chevron spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment
indonesia has earned a reputation for favoring pertamina to take over expiring oil and gas contracts in the past stoking concern among foreign energy investors about the security of their projects
jonan who said he is eager to earn the trust of investors to boost development of indonesia s natural resources said the days of playing favorites were in the the only maxim we stick to is the economics
there is no favoritism about the origin of the company there is no political play
the answer is no and no
it is the economics
that applies to everyone foreign companies local companies and government companies he said
jonan said indonesia was also in discussions with chevron about another project it is operating indonesia deepwater development a natural gas production effort in east kalimantan after chevron cut billion in spending plans there
we both agreed to go and find the best way to work on this block for both sides he said adding the negotiations now will go down to the technical jonan said he had not yet used his authority to adjust fiscal terms for oil and gas blocks to encourage investment but was ready to do so in any cases where investment returns were projected to be below percent
jonan said he is seriously considering offering fiscal adjustments to a number of smaller blocks in indonesia but he did not name the blocks or the companies involved
jonan also said he met this week with freeport mcmoran ceo richard adkerson to discuss the company s grasberg gold and copper mine in papua
the company has been in tricky negotiations with indonesia to secure operating rights at the mine after the government introduced rules last year forcing it to divest its controlling interest
jonan said the two agreed that freeport needs freedom to operate the mine in the way it sees fit in the near term but that the government insists on having a voice
we agreed that freeport has to be in charge at the moment
honestly we don t have the expertise he said
but if you talk about control it is a very delicate word in terms of management
i would like to say we both jonan added that indonesia which produces and exports large amounts of coal currently viewed the fuel as critical to keeping electricity costs down for its population
we have a serious concern about global warming and are trying to reduce the use of coal as the primary energy for our power plants he said
but we go with the affordability for the he said indonesia would find it difficult to reach its target of generating percent of its power from renewable sources by as pledged under the paris agreement to combat climate change but remained hopeful it could reach somewhere above percent by that time
