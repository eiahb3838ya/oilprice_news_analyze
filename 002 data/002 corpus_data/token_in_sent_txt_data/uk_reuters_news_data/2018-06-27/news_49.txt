global markets-bears prowl world markets, maul chinese stocks as trade tensions simmer
china yuan skids to fresh low stocks follow oil sharply higher as us pressures allies on iran crude asian markets hesitant amid trade uncertainty yen firmer as currencies ease updates throughout changes byline dateline by sujata rao london june reuters a percent slide in chinese equities on wednesday and a fresh weakening in the yuan highlighted mounting stress on the world s number two economy from trade tensions with the united states while global stocks slipped to approach lows
while the prospect of trade protectionism and tariffs are raising serious fears for the world economy the growth and inflation outlook is being further complicated by oil prices rising back above per barrel due to washington pressuring its allies to halt iranian imports
oil s rise despite last week s deal by crude producers to raise output helped wall street rebound on tuesday while technology stocks also jumped as president donald trump said he endorsed a measured approach to restricting chinese investment in tech companies
but that rally has fizzled
equity futures indicate wall street will open weaker and msci s asian equity index fell percent to a fresh low
losses were led by china where blue chips sank percent to stand a whisker above lows
chinese equities have now fallen into bear market territory having tumbled percent from recent peaks
the yuan slipped to a fresh low against the dollar as the central bank allowed the biggest weakening in the currency in percentage terms since january
many analysts now see authorities allowing currency weakness in order to counter the hit to trade
after a lot of we are seeing shanghai suffering a lot more than wall street so clearly the first round of trade war has been won by america
unfortunately that then overflows into emerging markets and europe so it s not a pretty time for investors said peter lowman chief investment officer at uk wealth manager investment quorum
lowman said a equity bullmarket had left many assets priced for perfection meaning setbacks could have an outsize impact especially because central banks led by the federal reserve are tightening policy after years of interest rates
oil trading near is going to put pressure on inflation around the world which means central bank policy may have to tighten quicker than expected lowman added
the iran supply worries have overshadowed a supply increase agreed by opec and other oil producers last week pushing brent futures over a barrel european shares meanwhile fell percent to the lowest since april
a percent fall in auto shares among the most vulnerable to tariffs took german equities percent down to nearly lows
many investors still caution against reading too much into the fallout from the trade tensions citing robust global growth and hopes of an ultimately pragmatic approach by leaders on the trade issue
we still have fundamental macro drivers
it s very much a between fundamentals mattering more versus political factors kristina hooper global chief market strategist at invesco said
nevertheless assets including currencies continue to feel the heat the australian dollar weakened towards lows hit recently and the new zealand dollar touched seven month lows to the dollar
the greenback itself firmed modestly against a basket of currencies recovering from lows but it fell percent against japan s yen which is considered a asset
bonds also gained from the turmoil with treasury yields slipping basis points to around percent a month low
political concerns in europe are also worrying investors at the margin as a row over migration policy in germany s coalition government rumbled on raising concerns that the euro zone s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections
that also contributed to pushing german yields lower also edging towards lows
