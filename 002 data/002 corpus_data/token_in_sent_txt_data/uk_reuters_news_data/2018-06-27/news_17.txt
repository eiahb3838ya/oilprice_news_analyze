public demonstrations are rare in iran but in recent months there have been several over the state of the economy
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the hardline cleric in power since demanded the judiciary punish those who disrupt economic security in remarks clearly intended to send a message to iranians who may plan more demonstrations
the atmosphere for the work life and livelihood of the people must be secure he said in a meeting with judiciary officials according to his official website
and the judiciary must confront those who disrupt economic the bazaar strike is the biggest sign of domestic disquiet in iran since the united states abandoned a deal to lift economic sanctions in return for curbs to tehran s nuclear program
the deal was the centerpiece of rouhani s plans to open iran s economy which won him two landslide elections but has yet to bring widespread economic benefits for many iranians
washington has pledged even tighter sanctions than before although its european allies and other world powers say they still support the nuclear deal
we will take problems
we will take pressure
but we will not sacrifice our independence said rouhani in an address broadcast on state television
in the latest push against tehran a senior official said on tuesday that countries buying oil from iran should prepare to halt all imports of it starting in november or face punishment

the rial traded at against the dollar in the unofficial market on wednesday according to foreign exchange website

an iranian oil official dismissed efforts to squeeze iran s oil industry
iran exports a total amount of million barrels per day of crude and condensate and eliminating it easily and in a period of a few months is impossible the official told the tasnim news agency
trump s determination to deprive iran of funding raises the stakes for rouhani who has attempted to appease anger over his government s handling of the economy
the iranian parliament showed the level of discontent over rouhani s performance issuing a letter signed by representatives more than half of the total asking that the president change his administration s economic team
mehrdad emadi an iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at london s betamatrix consultancy estimated sanctions could cause iran s crude oil exports to drop by between and bpd in coming months
he said a fall below million bpd the level two years ago before the nuclear deal was unlikely as iran would remain able to sell some oil abroad through barter deals
turkey said on wednesday it did not consider itself bound by the effort to stop iran exporting oil
but the sanctions may stifle iran s plans to expand its oil industry
after a deal reached this month among global oil producers to raise output saudi arabia and russia look set to take market share from iran
iran is in a weaker position to cope with these sanctions than it was during the last sanctions period two years ago emadi said
then iran had some billion of currency stored abroad in countries such as china and turkey as well as european banks
detailed figures for foreign exchange reserves are secret but tehran has now drawn down much of that buffer to handle expenses such as capital flight and foreign intervention emadi said
he predicted iran might ultimately enter a fresh recession as lower oil revenues prompted the government to put public sector projects on hold and as the economy became more militarized in response to pressure
a downturn in growth could worsen bad debt problems in the banking sector which the international monetary fund has warned could destabilize the economy
