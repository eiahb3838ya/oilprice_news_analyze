feature-legal fight over bali coal power plant illuminates indonesia energy dilemma
celukan bawang indonesia june thomson reuters foundation o ver the last three years fisherman iputu gede astawa has watched his daily catch off the northern tip of indonesia s bali island fall at an alarming rate
having swapped his paddle for an outboard motor in a futile effort to fish further out to sea where waters are more dangerous astawa blames a nearby coal power plant for harming his livelihood
my catch is totally different to what it was before the power plant began operating said astawa a fisherman based near the port town of singaraja who heads a group of about other fishermen
where once they caught buckets of fish a day they now net just
astawa is one of three local residents fighting a legal battle to stop the planned expansion of the celukan bawang power plant about km miles from the main tourism hub of denpasar which began operating in
all the fishermen will be impacted and we will lose our jobs said astawa who now makes furniture to get by
the legal bid backed by environmental group greenpeace claims the planned expansion which would more than double power capacity at the site will be a setback to the remote area s fledgling tourism industry
the legal action also warns of worsening air and water pollution crop damage and a negative effect on wildlife at a nearby national park
pt general energy bali which runs the celukan bawang power plant could not be reached for comment while the company s majority owner china huadian corporation did not answer calls
building additional coal or power capacity at celukan bawang or elsewhere on bali is needed to meet rising power demand jisman hutajulu a senior electricity official at indonesia s energy ministry said by email
but the decision on whether to opt for more fossil fuel capacity or renewable energy is for local governments to make he said adding that energy security the environment and cost should all be considered
central government policy on renewable energy has sought to encourage investment while keeping electricity prices affordable for consumers he noted
indonesia is among the countries for energy consumption due to a steadily increasing population economic development and a rise in urbanisation
like other asian nations jakarta also faces the challenge of boosting electricity access while meeting its pledge to cut emissions under the paris agreement
indonesia s emissions targets can only be achieved by reducing its reliance on coal power and ramping up investment in clean renewable energy projects several power experts said
indonesia currently has about gigawatts of installed electricity capacity but to meet rising demand especially on the main islands of java bali and sumatra the country wants to more than double this over the next decade
with huge coal resources the archipelago relies heavily on power stations to generate more than half of its power according to experts
natural gas contributes about percent renewable energy percent and diesel the rest
but having committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by percent by under the paris accord to curb global warming jakarta wants renewable projects to provide almost a quarter of its power needs by and nearly a third by
dolf gielen director of innovation and technology with the international renewable energy agency said indonesia was focused on coal for power generation as recently as a couple of years ago but that seems to be somewhat changing
with more than islands scattered atop the volcanic pacific ring of fire power experts say indonesia has plenty of options on renewable sources especially geothermal
the united states is the world s biggest geothermal energy producer but largely untapped indonesia is second since the massive sarulla geothermal power plant on sumatra was expanded earlier this year
is another good renewable energy option for indonesia said yuichiro yoi head of indonesia infrastructure finance at the asian development bank adb in manila
north sumatra s asahan hydroelectric power plant which began operating in has helped indonesia reduce its reliance on fossil fuels he added
solar tidal and wind farms are also suitable for many parts of indonesia experts said
indonesia s first wind power project the sidrap wind farm on the island of sulawesi began operating earlier this year and is a source of national pride
there are also plans to build the world s largest tidal power plant in east flores media reports say
although a clean and abundant power source indonesia s geothermal resources are often located on or near protected forest areas which can put off many financial backers
one solution may be to exploit them on a smaller scale said almo pradana energy and climate manager at the world resources institute wri indonesia
similar to challenges facing other renewable projects indonesia s complicated land ownership structures and land acquisition procedures can create further risks said adb s yoi
new renewables plants also have to reach a power supply agreement with the utility and such discussions can lack transparency and lead to delays power experts added
in addition government legislation stipulates new renewable energy projects must provide electricity at a price about percent cheaper than existing power plants in a province
as a result renewables often can not compete with coal
the wri is working with international corporations operating in indonesia that have pledged to cut their emissions to try and force the government to change tack
if you don t facilitate a company to switch to renewables they will move to the philippines or vietnam where renewable energy regimes are more friendly pradana said
back in northern bali surayah who goes by one name is the only resident left on cleared land that was pungkukan village where residents once lived
all her neighbours have been paid to leave their homes over the last decade to make way for the celukan bawang plant s planned expansion
surayah did reach an agreement to sell but it collapsed due to changes she said strengthening her resolve
living alongside six family members the is adamant she will not leave despite her family s regular hospital trips to treat fevers and respiratory problems she said
i feel the coal power plant does care about me anymore said surayah whose house is more than three hours drive from the sprawl of hotels and restaurants in southern bali that need the power from the plant
i feel exhausted
