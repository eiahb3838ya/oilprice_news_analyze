interview-zimbabwe's chamisa worried about opposition clampdown after rally blast
harare reuters zimbabwe s main opposition leader on wednesday said he feared the government would use a blast that hit a weekend rally by president emmerson mnangagwa as an excuse to clamp down on opponents ahead of a july vote
mnangagwa is the election favourite and a spokesman for his ruling party simon moyo said the government was not planning any clampdown
nelson chamisa leader of the movement for democratic change mdc which has formed a poll alliance with smaller parties said mnangagwa was leading an unstable government without capacity to resolve zimbabwe s problems including the economy
we know that they would also want to use that as a pretext to clamp down on the opposition they would want to use it to start targeting certain individuals certain candidates that they perceive to be their credible opposition chamisa told reuters in an interview
mnangagwa blamed a faction loyal to former leader robert mugabe s wife grace for the attempt on his life in bulawayo city and has said the government is taking steps to ensure peace endures
two people died and dozens were injured in the explosion
the presidential and parliamentary vote is the first since mugabe was forced to resign in november after a coup
it is seen as a contest between generations
chamisa said he was confident he would form the next government which would include elements but complained the electoral field was tilted in mnangagwa s favour
he said the mdc was worried about ghost voters on the poll register and was also concerned over which firm would be granted the contract to print the ballots
he said the army should publicly declare it would respect the result even if mnangagwa lost
the military remains averse to any leader who was not part of the liberation war against white rule analysts say
while zimbabwe lacks a reliable polling system an unofficial survey released early this month in bulawayo by the mass public opinion institute put mnangagwa s popularity on percent against chamisa s percent
the survey showed that a large group percent declined to disclose a preference
the institute will publish another survey just before the vote
chamisa whose party has promised to revive the economy said his government would review all investment deals signed by the government to ensure zimbabwe did not lose out
platinum and coal deals are among those that would be scrutinised chamisa said adding he would seek better trade terms with china a big investor in the country
zimbabwe signed a billion platinum deal with a cypriot investor karo resources in march and is developing a billion platinum joint venture with russian partners
we need to investigate to see what was involved chamisa said referring to the coal and platinum deals
he said he was not afraid to antagonise powerful forces
i am not worried about the anger of dealers
we do not want dealers in zimbabwe we want investors he said arguing that some of the investors were mere dealmakers
