u.n. aviation agency approves standards to kickstart emissions deal
montreal reuters the united nations aviation agency on wednesday approved new standards needed to implement a global agreement that seeks to limit emissions from international flights an aviation industry group said
starting most airlines flying international routes will begin monitoring their fuel and carbon emissions as part of the landmark agreement brokered two years ago by the international civil aviation organization icao
airlines had called on icao to approve the standards which they need to prepare for the agreement that officially goes into effect in
this now allows governments and industry to make final preparations for implementation before the emissions monitoring and reporting obligations commence in january michael gill executive director of the air transport action group atag said in a statement
the icao deal requires airlines to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world
the new standards approved by a majority of icao s governing council including the united states give governments a technical guide on how to compile airlines emissions and how much the carriers will need to offset
this is a very significant step but there are still important details needed to be filled in annie petsonk international counsel for the environmental defense fund said in a telephone interview
icao has yet to finalize the specific criteria for fuels allowed under the agreement she said
in principle fossil fuels can qualify but they will have to meet the agreement s standards
complying with the agreement is estimated to cost airlines less than percent of industry revenue
the deal is voluntary for the first five years and becomes mandatory from for the world s largest emitters
airlines have supported a global agreement in favor of a potentially more costly patchwork of national and regional deals
an icao spokesman could not provide an immediate comment
