east libyan officials say oil money will go to their central bank
benghazi libya june reuters east libyan officials said on wednesday they would send oil revenue from areas under their control to a central bank based in the east defying pressure to return recently recaptured ports to the internationally recognised state oil firm
the comments were made as a parallel national oil corporation noc in the eastern city of benghazi said it had formally taken delivery of eastern oil ports at a ceremony at es sider terminal
it is unclear whether the benghazi noc will be able to export any oil despite the libyan national army lna promising them control of all eastern ports and fields
but the move has created deep uncertainty over opec member libya s oil production and risks deepening a split between factions based in the east and west of the country
the ceremony at es sider was attended by representatives of libya s parliament and government which are aligned with the lna and oppose the internationally backed government of national accord gna in the capital tripoli
noc benghazi head faraj said who was also present called it a happy and historic day
we undertake that the money won t go to someone shorn of legitimacy he said a reference to tripoli central bank head sadiq whom eastern factions have repeatedly tried to oust
we have a central bank in the eastern town of bayda and it is recognised by the libyan es sider and the neighbouring terminal of ras lanuf have been under lna control since
it let the tripoli noc operate the ports along with other eastern oil facilities with revenue flowing to the tripoli central bank
but after fighting off the latest in a series of attempts by their opponents to seize the ports the lna said on monday that this time they would hand ras lanuf es sider and other eastern ports and fields to noc benghazi instead
eastern government spokesman hatem said all previous oil contracts would be respected but eastern authorities had taken the step because oil revenue had been going to militias and extremist groups
in the past western powers have prevented noc benghazi from exporting oil independently of tripoli under security council resolutions that give power over oil exports to the gna and noc in the capital
on wednesday the united states france britain and italy said in a joint statement they were deeply concerned by the lna s offer of oil facilities to noc benghazi and that the international community would hold those who undermine libya s peace security and stability to account
secretary general antonio guterres called for the return of oil resources production and revenue to the control of the recognised libyan authorities
