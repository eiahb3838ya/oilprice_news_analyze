update 1-groningen gas output falling faster than planned
adds more detail on advice to government to ensure further reduction of output changes dateline the hague june reuters production at the groningen natural gas field will be lower than originally envisaged this year as the dutch government works towards the end of extraction in the next decade because of the risk of earthquakes
output will have fallen to between and billion cubic metres bcm in the year ending october the dutch gas sector regulator said on wednesday lower than the original cap of bcm set for the year and down from bcm last year
the dutch government will end production in groningen completely by it said in march as it tries to limit seismic risks in the region
as a first step it promised to reduce production to less than bcm as quickly as possible in the coming years as that level would significantly reduce the risks of earthquakes
that level could be reached by economy minister eric wiebes said this month mainly by switching large industrial users from groningen gas
but regulator sodm on wednesday said more measures are needed to ensure that goal is met
the government will need to offer financial incentives to large industrial users in the short term it said and will ultimately have to ban them from using groningen gas completely
reducing demand from large users is critical for reducing seismic risks sodm director theodor kockelkoren told reporters
we need to give them an incentive to switch and we need to be clear exactly how much time they will the regulator did not say when it thought factories should be cut off from groningen gas as it said that decision was up to the government
