pakistan ex-pm banned in one seat as election bias claims persist
islamabad reuters a pakistani election tribunal disqualified outgoing prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi on wednesday from running in his home constituency dealing the latest blow to the party of ousted leader nawaz sharif
the surprise barring of abbasi applies only to the constituency of murree and not the separate islamabad seat in which he is also standing in the july election
however with four weeks until the vote he could still face new challenges
the ruling follows the arrest by an body of another member of sharif s pakistan muslim after he was named to contest a seat
in the case of abbasi an election commission tribunal ruled that he did not declare an accurate value of his assets in his nomination papers
abbasi denied the charges and termed the decision illegal saying he will appeal against the ban
i declared an actual value of my property at the rate which my father bought it in he told local tv channels
it is an election for the parliament
they have made it a abbasi was named prime minister last year after the supreme court disqualified sharif who had served twice as prime minister before and was ousted both times
since his removal sharif has been arguing that the pakistani military establishment aided by top members of the judiciary backed a series of decisions which banned him from politics for life
sharif has a history of differences with the military which has ruled the country for almost half of its history
in his third term sharif and the military clashed over differences over handling islamist militants and his desire to mend diplomatic ties with india
sharif is separately facing criminal charges in an court that could see him jailed in the coming weeks
the body has also approved a fresh inquiry into both abbasi and sharif over a liquefied natural gas lng terminal project
sharif and his party have termed the cases and other several measures as a attempt to tip the scales in favour of opposition politician imran khan
on monday another candidate qamarul islam was arrested on orders of the national accountability bureau over accusations he awarded government water contracts at over the market price
former premier abbasi was among the leaders who decried the arrest of islam as bias ahead of the election
