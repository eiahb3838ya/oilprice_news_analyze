update 2-london court backs deripaska in battle of russian tycoons
reuters russian tycoon oleg deripaska got a boost on wednesday in a battle for control of norilsk nickel when a high court judge ruled fellow investor roman abramovich did not have the right to sell shares in the miner to a third businessman
deripaska who controls aluminum giant rusal wants to stop abramovich from selling norilsk nickel nornickel shares to russian businessman vladimir potanin saying that would violate a shareholder agreement
at london s high court judge stephen phillips ruled such a sale by abramovich the owner of england s chelsea soccer club breached the terms of that shareholder pact
he found abramovich s company crispian was and is precluded under the framework agreement from disposing of shares
the judge added the court was adjourned pending applications including for permission to appeal
potanin said in march he purchased a percent stake in nornickel from abramovich for about million
the deal increased potanin s holding in the miner to percent but the court said previously the sale could be reversed if the london court ruled in favor of rusal
rusal is pleased with today s london court ruling
this completely vindicates rusal s decision to challenge the notice rusal said
interros which manages potanin s assets declined to comment
a spokesman for abramovich was not immediately available for comment
rusal which has been hit by sanctions since april holds a percent stake in nornickel
nornickel competes with brazil s vale for the rank of the world s top nickel producer and is also the world s largest palladium producer
deripaska and potanin have periodically been at loggerheads since rusal the world s largest aluminum producer outside china bought a stake in nornickel just before the global financial crash
abramovich stepped in as a white knight minority shareholder in to act as a buffer between potanin and deripaska
deripaska made his first public appearance since being made a target of sanctions to give evidence to the hearings in may that preceded wednesday s judgment
the judge has yet to detail his reasons which he said would be published at a later date
