update 2-norway awards oil permits to 11 firms in arctic licensing round
adds equinor drilling ban details by nerijus adomaitis oslo june reuters norway has awarded oil and gas exploration licences to equinor and other companies focused mostly on the arctic where oslo believes it has the greatest potential for significant new discoveries
nine of the licences are located in the barents sea and three in the norwegian sea off central norway the ministry of oil and energy said on monday
this licensing round confirms that the oil companies see opportunities for further profitable petroleum activity in the north oil and energy minister terje soeviknes said in a statement
equinor formerly known as statoil was awarded five licences and will participate as a participant in a further two
in contrast to the awards of the licensing round the majority of these awards are less mature and therefore require more work before the drilling candidates are ready equinor said in a statement
the award includes one firm commitment to drill an exploration well in the southwestern part of the barents sea it added
shell aker bp lundin omv and spirit energy a joint venture between britain s centrica and germany s bayerngas were also offered operatorships
licence operators determine exploration programs and sign contracts with suppliers in coordination with partners
in addition dea idemitsu m vest energy vng and wintershall were awarded participating interest
the number of firms applying for blocks in the licensing round fell to from in the previous round two years ago with analysts pointing to last year s disappointing exploration campaign that resulted in a few minor discoveries
aker bp won operatorships in two licenses located near bear island although the government said drilling would be banned between april and august to protect important nesting grounds for arctic birds
the company was not immediately available to comment on how this would impact plans
the restriction was added as a result of coalition talks after parliamentary elections last september
environmental groups have protested against oil exploration in arctic waters citing the risk of oil spills and norway s commitments to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide
greenpeace and other activists this year lost a lawsuit arguing that exploration in norway s northernmost region is unconstitutional and should be banned as it violates the right to a clean environment
an appeal in the case is pending
oil and gas production accounts for about percent of norway s exports and helped to build the world s largest sovereign wealth fund
