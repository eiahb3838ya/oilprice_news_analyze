singapore reuters china s threat to impose duties on oil imports will hit a business that has soared in the last two years and which is now worth almost billion per month

following a year and a half of voluntary supply cuts led by the middle organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec as well as the producer russia oil markets have tightened pushing up prices
the potential in american oil exports to china would benefit other producers especially from opec and russia
the opec kingpin saudi arabia and russia indicated on friday they would loosen their supply restraint and were starting to raise exports
a cut in chinese purchases of oil may also benefit iran s sales which washington is trying to curb with new sanctions it announced in may
the chinese may just replace some of the american oil with iranian crude said john driscoll director of consultancy jtd energy services
china isn t intimidated by the threat of sanctions
they haven t been in the past
so in this diplomatic spat they might just replace crude with iranian oil
that would obviously infuriate trump he said
to view a graphic on crude oil exports to china click china s aggressive riposte to trump took some in the industry by surprise
crude exports to china have been rising sharply thanks to a production surge in the past three years that was a welcome alternative to make up for the cut in supplies from opec and russia
we re caught by surprise that crude oil is on the list said an official with a chinese state oil major asking not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media
we were actually preparing to raise imports according to an earlier government line he added referring to a beijing policy enacted earlier this year to help reduce the trade deficit with china
oil exports which have been surging thanks to a sharp increase in production in the past three years were seen as a viable alternative to make up for the cut in supplies from opec and russia
shipping data in thomson reuters eikon shows that crude oil shipments to china have soared in value recently jumping from just million per month in early to almost billion per month currently
the threatened tariff would make oil more expensive versus supplies from other regions including the middle east and russia and likely disrupt a business that has soared recently
with trump s politics we re in a world of alliances
china will not just swallow tariffs said driscoll
this is petroleum diplomacy he added
the cartel is the big beneficiary of all this oil diplomacy as it will squeeze global spare oil capacity and likely push up crude to view a graphic on exxonmobil chevron share prices click this version of the story has been refiled to fix graphic links
