update 2-s.african union open to inflation-linked pay deal at eskom - source
eskom began power cuts last week after wage protests utility produces pct of south africa s electricity unions had wanted pct pay hikes eskom offered no rise wage settlement now more likely recasts to focus on deal by ed stoddard and alexander winning johannesburg june reuters south africa s national union of mineworkers num is open to an pay rise for its members at struggling state power firm eskom instead of its initial demand for a percent increase a source at the union told reuters
africa s most industrialised economy suffered power outages last week because of what eskom had said was an illegal protest action by the num and two other unions
the unions who were incensed by eskom s initial refusal to offer pay rises for this year had threatened a total shutdown of the power firm
the last time there were controlled power outages in south africa in economic output suffered
the num source who did not wish to be named told reuters on monday that the mineworkers union would consider a wage offer from eskom of inflation plus a certain percentage
south africa s consumer inflation was running at percent in april well below the level unions had initially targeted
cutting costs at troubled state entities such as eskom is a top priority for president cyril ramaphosa and the labour dispute at eskom will test his administration s commitment to reforms aimed at putting a sluggish economy on a sustained growth path
eskom produces more than percent of south africa s power and was embroiled in corruption scandals under former president jacob zuma
it has said it could be forced to resume controlled power cuts known locally as on monday evening when electricity demand is higher in the winter season
a potential stumbling block to the conclusion of a wage deal between eskom and unions this week was that the num is scheduled to hold its national congress from wednesday to friday when new union leaders will be elected
but the num the national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa and solidarity all agreed to resume talks on tuesday after public enterprises minister pravin gordhan said that eskom would make a pay hike offer
gordhan oversees eskom in ramaphosa s cabinet and is guiding efforts to reform south africa s companies
the three unions the num numsa and solidarity say they together represent more than half of eskom s employees
deon reyneke deputy secretary general of the solidarity trade union which represents mostly skilled workers said eskom had signalled to unions that it would be looking at a formula linked to consumer inflation for its next wage offer
phakamile a numsa spokeswoman said the metalworkers union would not reveal its negotiating position until talks had started
eskom has now conceded that it will grant some increase in wages
asked about the num source s comment on an increase eskom spokesman khulu phasiwe said the company s management was still crunching the numbers ahead of the resumption of talks
phasiwe said eskom had been able to return several generating units to the grid on sunday as some workers had returned to work
he said the power firm which narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year had sent a positive signal to employees by agreeing that a zero percent salary increase was now off the table
