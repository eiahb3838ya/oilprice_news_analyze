corrected-column-china's threat to u.s. crude, coal exports is a tactical masterstroke: russell
launceston australia reuters china s threat to impose tariffs on crude oil certain refined products and coal is possibly the only sign of clear thinking in the increasingly muddled escalating trade dispute with the administration of president donald trump
the tariffs on energy imports were mooted by the chinese on june as part of their response to the announcement of tariffs on billion worth of imports
to be clear the tariffs on crude oil and products and coal are still in the realm of the possible and it will likely take a further deterioration in the relationship between the world s two largest economies to turn them into a reality
it was also curious that the list of potential targets for customs included natural gas in its gaseous form but not as liquefied natural gas lng
china imports zero gaseous natural gas from the united states but is major buyer of its lng
graphic china imports of lng coking coal crude oil the chinese threat to impose tariffs on energy imports makes sense from two perspectives
the first is that in economic terms it s generally best to put tariffs on goods with high elasticity in other words goods you can substitute relatively easily from other suppliers
the second is that if the aim of your tariffs is to inflict sufficient pain on the other country it s best to target them where they can do the most damage to the economy or the politicians promoting the trade war
looking at the first point it s clear that china would be able to source crude oil refined products and coal from other countries even if it had to pay slightly more
the chinese have become a major buyer of crude importing about barrels per day bpd in the first five months of the year according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
this makes china the biggest net buyer of crude canada imports more but also exports to the and therefore an important customer for the booming shale industry
with crude exports running at about million bpd china s purchases represent about percent of the total
however crude supplies to china account for only about percent of the country s total daily imports
what this is likely to mean is that china will find it easier to replace crude imports than producers will to get new customers
it s not hard to imagine a scenario whereby china encourages saudi arabia and russia the world s top oil exporters and partners in the agreement to restrict output to pump more crude
china would then buy the additional saudi and russian output using it to replace cargoes from the united states and even from iran assuming the renewed sanctions against the islamic republic force beijing to curtail imports
turning to coal the majority of china s imports from the united states are coking coal used in steel making
supply of this type of coal is more concentrated with australia dominating the seaborne market
but absent a disruption in australia it s likely china could buy all it needs without tapping supplies although this may result in a shuffling among buyers
for example japan may buy more from the united states and less from australia
looking at natural gas and while lng remains off the customs list for the time being the chinese could also probably replace what they buy from the united states from other countries if needed
in the first five months of the year the united states supplied about percent of china s lng imports according to data
however china bought about percent of all lng exports meaning that china is more important to lng producers than they are to the chinese
by putting energy imports on the agenda for tariffs even if lng is excluded so far the chinese have put doubt in the minds of investors thinking of putting capital into a new lng project
the second leg to china s threat is that any tariff on energy imports will strike at the heart of president trump s support base
coal miners count among trump s most vocal backers but if china does stop buying coking coal it may force producers to accept lower prices from other buyers in order to move cargoes
the oil and natural gas industries have also been viewed as largely in trump s corner and they are concentrated in states won by the former reality television star in his unexpected triumph
losing as big a buyer as china may force producers to accept lower prices or even reduce output
energy is also one of the few areas where the chinese have genuine scope to increase purchases from the united states thereby making it key to any efforts to lower the trade surplus china has with the united states
flagging energy imports as a possible target in the current trade skirmish comes across as a sign that beijing is entirely serious about engaging in a escalation with trump
the chinese have probably calculated that they can take the pain from a trade conflict longer than trump can or at least longer than the economy companies and workers will be prepared to tolerate
