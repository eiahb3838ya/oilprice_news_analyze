nuclear, coal bailout worth any cost 'to keep america free' -us energy chief
washington june reuters energy secretary rick perry said on thursday that bailing out struggling coal and nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong and that the cost to americans should not be an issue
you can not put a dollar figure on the cost to keep america free he told reporters at a press conference in washington when asked how much the administration s effort to extend the lives of the facilities would cost
when asked about the cost of a potential bailout he said he did not yet know
we look at the electricity grid as every bit as important to national security as making sure we have the right number of ships aircraft and personnel he said
what is your freedom worth president donald trump ordered the doe to take emergency measures to slow the retirements of coal and nuclear power plants arguing those kinds of facilities can store months of fuel on site and therefore withstand supply disruptions that could be caused by storms hacks or physical attacks
aging coal and nuclear facilities have been shuttering at a rapid pace in recent years pushed out by cheaper natural gas as well as renewable energy sources like wind and solar
the trump administration considers renewable energy vulnerable because plants rely on pipelines that can be disrupted and solar and wind facilities only produce energy under certain weather conditions
perry said nearly all military bases rely on power from the civilian grid
the emerging grid policy fits neatly with the administration s broader agenda to boost fossil fuels production and to save the coal industry
the doe is currently studying ways to bail out coal and nuclear facilities including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them
cyber experts have questioned the reasoning behind a potential bailout
they said it will not toughen the power grid against cyber attacks because hackers have a wide array of options for hitting electric infrastructure and nuclear facilities that are targets
perry said the doe is examining the costs now
