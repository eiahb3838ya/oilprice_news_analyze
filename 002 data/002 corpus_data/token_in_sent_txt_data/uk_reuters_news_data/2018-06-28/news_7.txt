refile-update 3-baltic states to decouple power grids from russia, link to eu by 2025
fixes typo by alissa de carbonnel and andrius sytas june reuters the leaders of the baltic states and poland signed a deal on thursday to connect their power grids to the european union by and break their dependence on russia a soviet legacy
nearly ten years in the making the politically fraught technically challenging and costly plan to unplug estonia latvia and lithuania from russia comes amid mounting concerns over russian posturing in the region
the baltic states once ruled from moscow but members of the european union and nato since view being linked into russia s power network as a threat to their national security
the agreement seen by reuters was signed with the eu s chief executive juncker on the sidelines of a summit of eu leaders in brussels
it ends years of bickering among the three countries over how best to synchronise their electricity grid with the continental synchronous area of their partners to the west and paves the way for eu funds to be disbursed for the billion euro project
we worked nine years for the agreement president dalia grybauskaite told lithuanian lrt television on thursday
this is the last millstone tied to our feet keeping us from real energy independence she said
that tool of blackmail which was used by russia to buy our politicians and meddle in our politics will no longer approaching deadlines to tap into eu funding for the project as well as upgrades to the russian network which give the former overlord an apparent ability to decouple the baltics unilaterally forced the sides to work out a solution
under the deal states would use the existing overland litpol link between lithuania and poland as well as a new direct current cable to run under the baltic sea looping around the territorial waters of russia s kaliningrad exclave
this project to be confirmed by august would cost around million euros a diplomatic source said
i think this as a historic event which helps to finally solve the question of the energy independence of the baltic states latvian minister of economics arvils aseradens told reuters
the underwater cable will offer megawatts mw capacity and could be completed by lithuania s energy minister zygimantas vaiciunas told reuters
it will be used both for power trading and synchronisation purposes he added
brussels is to negotiate with moscow over how to maintain the power supply to kaliningrad which is currently synchronised with mainland russia through the baltic states
the deal proposes connecting kaliningrad with two power converters
russia on which the baltic states currently rely to balance their power flows has never cut power or threatened to do so but the three eu nations fear it might and say there is a lack of transparency on upkeep of the network in russia
lithuania expects baltic states to test their ability to work autonomously from moscow in june before formally switching by
the russian and continental european systems both operate at a frequency of hertz but are not synchronised
the russian system is run from moscow whereas the continental one is decentralised
