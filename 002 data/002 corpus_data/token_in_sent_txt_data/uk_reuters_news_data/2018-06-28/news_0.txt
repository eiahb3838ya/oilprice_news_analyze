update 1-us gas pipeline industry wants help beating back green groups
reuters the united states should help the natural gas industry push back against opposition by environmental groups to pipeline projects by adopting new regulations or laws that favor infrastructure backers of the industry said at a conference this week
suppliers in the united states the world s biggest natural gas producer have had a difficult time in recent years getting shipments to some regions including new england as environmental lawsuits by states green groups and property owners have tied up pipeline construction
the administration of president donald trump has said that constraints on pipelines and other energy infrastructure can trigger price spikes and pose a risk to national security but has yet to intervene in state or permitting issues
it s definitely not getting easier to build a new pipeline stanley chapman executive vice president and president of natural gas pipelines at transcanada corp told reuters on the sidelines at the world gas conference in washington
i m seeing more pipeline projects that are under construction get held up by a judge in lawsuits and this has to be addressed either by ferc or with legislation he said
ferc or the federal energy regulatory commission oversees construction of new pipelines
transcanada owns about miles kilometers of gas pipeline in the united states making it one of the country s biggest operators
it has been trying for more than a decade to build its keystone xl oil pipeline project linking canada s oil sands to refineries
other pipeline developers feel the same
fifteen years ago nobody cared that much about pipelines today pipelines are under siege said al monaco president and ceo of enbridge inc with over miles of gas transmission lines in north america
ferc in april asked stakeholders to submit comments on whether the commission should revise existing pipeline approval policies yielding feedback from industry backers
i have encouraged the ferc commissioners that if they move forward in revising this policy they should focus on timely review and approval or disapproval of pipeline certificates
senator shelley moore capito republican of west virginia said at the world gas conference
she said it was tough for firms to invest in new pipelines when every regulatory action yields a lawsuit that leaves no project safe from the retroactive pulling of in recent weeks environmental groups like the sierra club have won court orders delaying construction on eqt midstream partners lp s mountain valley pipeline at several locations in west virginia and are now seeking a court order to also stop construction in virginia
we don t need these pipelines to meet our energy needs so it makes no sense to lock us into generations of dependence on dirty fossil fuels said joan walker who helps lead the sierra club s beyond dirty fuels campaign
eqt said it was disappointed and was evaluating legal and regulatory options to continue construction
if you stop the pipelines you stop energy development
that s how the thinking goes enbridge s monaco said about the efforts of environmental groups
mountain valley is one of several pipelines under construction to move gas from the marcellus and utica shale formations in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio to consumers in the southeast gulf coast and midwest
production in the marcellus and utica the biggest shale gas formations in the united states has ballooned to billion cubic feet per day bcfd from bcfd a decade ago according to federal energy data
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
the industry is now eyeing growing export markets by investing in facilities that can liquefy gas for shipment overseas
the united states has sent cargoes to nearly countries in the past year
senator capito said it was ironic that gas is headed around the world but struggles to reach new england
right now gas from the marcellus and utica shale is being blocked by some of our neighboring states which cuts off our markets in new england she said referring to new york which spans the canadian border to the atlantic
energy secretary rick perry said new york s efforts to stop new pipelines could pose a national security issue that outweighs the political concerns in albany new he said polar vortex weather in the winter or a cyber attack could threaten to leave wall street in the dark and hospitals without power
the leadership of new york is keeping pipelines from being built for strictly political purposes perry said
in january gas prices soared to a record high due to pipeline constraints during an extreme cold spell that forced power generators in new england to resort to burning diesel and russian imported lng
new york has denied water permits for a few pipelines from pennsylvania including williams cos inc s constitution and northeast supply enhancement projects and national fuel gas co s northern access
the new york department of environmental conservation dec said the department has a rigorous review process to protect public health and the environment
