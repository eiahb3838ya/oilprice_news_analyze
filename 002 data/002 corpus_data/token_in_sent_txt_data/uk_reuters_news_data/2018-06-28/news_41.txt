oslo reuters norway s supreme court ruled on thursday in favour of the government in a lawsuit brought by owners of the gassled gas network over tariffs ending a legal fight the owners said raised questions about norway as an investment destination
shareholders in gassled had argued the government acted unlawfully when cutting pipeline tariffs and that it would cost them a combined billion norwegian crowns billion in lost earnings through
there was no ground to make the change in regulation invalid the unanimous supreme court panel said
the case against the government was pursued by four investment companies solveig gas silex gas infragas and capeomega which together hold a combined percent of gassled that transports norway s gas to the rest of europe
some of the companies involved have said norway s unexpected decision to lower gas transportation tariffs would hurt its image as an investment destination
the nordic country is europe s gas supplier after russia
while tariffs were cut by percent for some future gas resources that are added to the network gassled s owners will still receive accumulated payment of billion crowns by a reduction of billion norway s energy ministry said
the owners have received a reasonable return on their investments the ministry said in a statement adding that lower pipeline fees could boost the extraction of offshore gas
the four investment companies were originally owned by allianz ubs the abu dhabi investment authority canada s public sector pension investment board the canada pension plan investment board and france s caisse des depots
in october ubs and caisse des depots said they were selling their stakes to capeomega but would still help pay legal costs
the government cut tariffs shortly after the four investors bought their stakes in gassled in and from exxonmobil total statoil now know as equinor and royal dutch shell for billion crowns
at least two of the partners said they would continue to be prudent owners

we will focus on our role in gassled
we will make sure that gassled stays solveig gas cei trygve pedersen said
that doesn t say if we will look at other projects in the future or not
i do not want to comment on hypothetical scenarios
