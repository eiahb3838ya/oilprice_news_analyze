transcanada urges u.s. to help gas pipelines beat green critics
june reuters the united states should help the natural gas industry overcome environmental challenges to new pipeline projects by adjusting regulations or adopting new laws favoring infrastructure an executive at transcanada corp said at a conference this week
suppliers in the united states the world s biggest natural gas producer have had a harder time getting shipments to market as more environmental lawsuits by states green groups and property owners have tied up pipeline construction
it s definitely not getting easier to build a new pipeline stanley chapman executive vice president and president of natural gas pipelines at transcanada corp told reuters on the sidelines at the world gas conference in washington
i m seeing more pipeline projects that are under construction get held up by a judge in lawsuits and this has to be addressed either by ferc or with legislation he said
ferc or the federal energy regulatory commission oversees construction of new pipelines
transcanada owns about miles of gas pipeline in the united states making it one of the country s biggest operators
it has been trying for more than a decade to build its keystone xl oil pipeline project linking canada s oil sands to refineries amid ongoing environmental delays
ferc in april asked stakeholders to submit comments on whether the commission should revise existing pipeline approval policies something that has yielded feedback from industry backers
i have encouraged the ferc commissioners that if they move forward in revising this policy they should focus on timely review and approval or disapproval of pipeline certificates
senator shelley moore capito republican of west virginia said at the world gas conference
she said it was tough for energy firms to invest in new pipelines when every regulatory action yields a lawsuit that leaves no project safe from the retroactive pulling of in recent weeks environmental groups like the sierra club have won court orders delaying construction on eqt midstream partners lp s mountain valley pipeline at several locations in west virginia through federal lawsuits and are now seeking a court order to also stop construction in virginia
eqt said it was disappointed and was evaluating legal and regulatory options to continue construction
mountain valley links west virginia and virginia
it is one of several pipelines under construction to transport gas from the marcellus and utica shale formations in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio to consumers in the southeast gulf coast and midwest where gas demand is growing fast especially for power generation and lng export
the sierra club says the united states should focus on clean energy sources like wind and solar
we don t need these pipelines to meet our energy needs so it makes no sense to lock us into generations of dependence on dirty fossil fuels said joan walker who helps lead the sierra club s beyond dirty fuels campaign
walker said she believe ferc currently acts as a rubber stamp for energy infrastructure projects
the united states is the world s biggest producer and consumer of natural gas and is on the cusp of becoming one of its top exporters
production in the marcellus and utica the biggest shale gas formations in the united states has ballooned to billion cubic feet per day bcfd from bcfd a decade ago according to federal energy data
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
the boom came as producers figured out how to use hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to unlock the gas from the rocks
the industry is eyeing growing export markets by investing in facilities that can liquefy gas for shipment overseas
the united states has sent cargoes to nearly countries in the past year
capito said it was ironic that gas is headed around the world but struggles to reach new england
right now gas from the marcellus and utica shale is being blocked by some of our neighboring states which cuts off our markets in new england she said
new york has denied water permits for a few pipelines that would move gas into the state from pennsylvania including williams cos inc s constitution and northeast supply enhancement projects and national fuel gas co s northern access
the new york department of environmental conservation dec said the department subjects all applications for environmental permits to an extensive and transparent review process designed to deny any permit that is found not to be protective of public health and the utilities in boston this winter had to resort to burning diesel and russian imported lng to supply enough electricity to consumers during a january cold spell capito noted
