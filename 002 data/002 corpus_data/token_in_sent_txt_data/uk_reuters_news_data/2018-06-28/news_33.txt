column-after opec, oil market enters a new era: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london june reuters opec is changing fundamentally as power in the oil market shifts towards saudi arabia acting in concert with russia while the other members of the organisation are increasingly marginalised
in theory all members of the organization of the petroleum countries are equal and the group has always taken decisions by consensus statute of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and
opec s founding statute stipulates that it shall be guided by the principle of sovereign equality of its member countries article
in practice some members of opec have always been more powerful than others but that imbalance has been widening with saudi arabia becoming the dominant
saudi arabia s oil production overtook iran s in the and the gap has grown steadily wider as a result of the iranian revolution the war and multiple rounds of sanctions
saudi arabia is the only member of the organisation with a large enough share of output to have a measurable influence prices and the budgetary flexibility to adjust its production significantly
in reality saudi arabia decides how much to produce given market conditions playing the role of swing producer while the other members of the organisation essentially produce as much as they are technically able
since the late saudi arabia has increasingly coordinated production policy with neighbouring kuwait and the united arab emirates largely ending their former rivalry and accusations of cheating
these three gulf countries have become the core of opec with the other members playing a peripheral role in output policy
the balance of power within opec has been shifting towards saudi arabia and its allies for the last years but production problems in other member countries have accelerated the trend in recent years
venezuela s output has fallen sharply as a result of mismanagement and internal unrest
libya s production has been cut by the country s civil war
nigeria and angola are suffering from chronic production problems
iran s output has been hampered by repeated rounds of sanctions
iraq is the only opec member which has experienced a significant increase in output since the country has recovered from the invasion and ensuing internal security problems
but iraq has always attempted to maximise output because of its enormous need for revenues to meet heavy budget commitments and it plays little practical role in opec s production policy
since saudi arabia and its key allies have consistently accounted for around percent of total opec output statistical review of world energy bp
more importantly saudi arabia and its allies account for almost all the organisation s spare production capacity and therefore almost all its production flexibility
saudi arabia and its allies accounted for most of the voluntary production cuts implemented during and now hold most of the spare capacity that could be made available to the market in
saudi arabia has around million barrels per day bpd of unused output capacity while the uae has around bpd and kuwait around according to the international energy agency
most other members of the organisation have only negligible amounts of unused capacity that could be readily and reliably available to the market oil market report iea june
and among the three gulf allies saudi arabia has by far the largest production and unused capacity cementing its role as the de facto leader of opec
opec s biggest problem in attempting to manage the oil market has always been its inability to control production from countries which remain outside the organisation
opec s efforts to stabilise and raise prices have frequently been undermined by the growth of alternative sources of supply alaska china the soviet union the north sea and now the shale fields of north america
saudi arabia as opec leader has made repeated overtures to countries since the to restrain their production with uneven success
since however saudi arabia has forged an effective working relationship with russia and a group of other smaller producers to limit output
just as saudi arabia has dominated opec russia dominates the group of allies contributing most of the output production cuts and spare capacity
in effect saudi arabia and russia have emerged as joint market managers with other opec and countries relegated to a marginal role
opec is no longer the primary forum for producing countries trying to coordinate policy on output and prices
real power has passed from opec and its group of allies into the hands of saudi arabia and russia
saudi arabia and russia have been careful to maintain the formal involvement of opec and the wider group of countries known as
but the real decisions on production policy are now being made bilaterally and outside the opec and structures
the marginalisation of opec as a formal group was evident during the organisation s meetings in vienna between june and june
despite four days of discussions opec and failed to reach a detailed agreement on production policy in the second half of
the final communiques issued after the opec and meetings did not specify either a formal output ceiling or country allocations
instead it was left to saudi and russian officials to brief the media afterwards that collective output would increase by around million bpd
saudi arabia and russia will contribute almost all the increase in output with smaller contributions from kuwait and the uae
in theory this decision was taken by consensus among opec and members with iran and other members persuaded to give their assent to a vague joint statement
in practice saudi arabia and russia are likely to have increased their production by million bpd whether other opec and countries agreed or not
if iran or any other country had walked out of the discussions it would not have made any practical difference to the amount of oil supplied to the market in the second half of
saudi arabia is keen to maintain the formal structure of opec and cooperation the consensus outcome of the meetings was an important step towards that objective
but the preservation of the group masks the fact real power in the oil market has shifted decisively to saudi arabia and russia with some political input from the united states
saudi and russian market power will become even more evident in the second half of if the two countries proceed with the agreed increase in production
assuming saudi arabia and its two gulf allies increase their combined production by bpd their share of total opec output will climb above percent for the first time since the
and if venezuela s output continues to fall which seems likely and iran s production is curbed by sanctions the three gulf allies will see their share of opec output climb to the highest level since
by the oil market will have less than million bpd of spare production capacity essentially all of it located in saudi arabia
saudi arabia will exercise more market power than at any time since the iranian revolution and iraq s invasion caused iranian output to plummet in
market power will be in the hands of saudi arabia and to a lesser extent russia not opec or the broader group
the formal structures of opec and will remain but real power has shifted elsewhere
