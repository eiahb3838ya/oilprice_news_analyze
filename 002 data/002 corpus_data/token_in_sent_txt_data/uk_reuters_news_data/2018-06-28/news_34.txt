special report-as mexico oil sector sputters, crime and violence rattle industry towns
paraiso mexico reuters until recently edgar barrera enjoyed a life many mexicans could only hope for
in a few short years the bookkeeper rose from handyman to worker at what seemed to be one of the most stable companies in latin america oil firm pemex
thanks to pemex barrera met his wife vacationed on the mayan riviera and envisaged a rewarding career without leaving his hometown in tabasco a rural state at the southern hook of the gulf of mexico where more than half the population lives on less than roughly a month
then everything changed
oil prices plummeted forcing pemex to cut his and thousands of other jobs across mexico
an energy reform meant to spur business with private competitors struggled to attract immediate investment
and the gang violence that has crippled mexico over the last decade finally spread to tabasco previously a relatively peaceful corner of the country
mounting consequences from an economic recession to soaring murder rates have rapidly made tabasco one of mexico s most troubled states
its small but once seemingly solid now struggles with a downturn and lurid violence
barrera himself after brushes with extortionists and kidnappers who may have once been pemex colleagues recently sought asylum in canada
paraiso or paradise is the tabasco town where barrera grew up and worked at a pemex port
it is now a hell he said
it s little surprise that industry turbulence would hurt tabasco home to mexico s first petroleum discovery and a state where more than half the economy and nearly half the jobs rely on the oil sector
but the extent of the problems has caught locals industry executives and government officials off guard especially as criminals increasingly exploit what s left of any prosperity by targeting pemex resources equipment and employees
the oil debacle hit us hard said tabasco governor arturo nunez
it caused social problems that without question are contributing to higher president enrique pena nieto now in his last year in office made an overhaul of the energy industry his signature initiative ending pemex s longstanding grip on exploration production refining and retail fuel sales
proponents long argued that operators besides pemex are needed to reverse more than a decade of declining crude output and unlock potential in untapped deposits
but the reform finalised in came into law just as global oil prices collapsed dampening companies willingness to invest
despite a recent rebound the price of crude in global markets plummeted by as much as percent as of june of that year
since then pemex has slashed nearly jobs across mexico about percent of its workforce according to company figures
in tabasco pemex let go workers or roughly percent of the jobs the state shed between and according to government data
many of the other layoffs were among suppliers and other businesses that rely on pemex
combined the cutbacks gave tabasco mexico s highest unemployment rate and mired the state in recession
in the most recent year for which data is available tabasco s economy shrank by percent
it is the only state where both poverty and extreme poverty defined by the government as monthly income of less than about have risen in recent years
compounding troubles nationwide the woes have eroded support ahead of a july presidential election for pena nieto s successor as the candidate of the ruling institutional revolutionary party
instead a leftist former mexico city mayor and native son of tabasco dominates polls
andres manuel lopez obrador the frontrunner promises to build a refinery in his home state
although pemex has recently begun to hire back a few workers other companies have been reluctant to invest in states like tabasco where oil production is now nearly percent below a peak in the early
with supply abundant worldwide and an flow of crude from shale investors are wary of mexico s crime corruption and violence
we decided not to start said javier lopez a attorney who recently scrapped plans to launch a business trucking fuel from the united states into mexico
we really were afraid we d get a truck stolen a driver for more than a decade mexico s government has deployed police the military and intelligence forces to topple powerful drug kingpins
as they fell cartels morphed and moved into new rackets including theft and extortion of businesses in industries from agriculture to mining and oil
earlier this year reuters reported how fuel thieves are crippling mexico s refineries and unleashing bloodshed in formerly calm centres of pemex operations
in tabasco police registered murders last year over triple the number in
despite a population of million people small compared with many of mexico s other states and giant capital district tabasco had the kidnapping tally and number of extortions reported last year
current and former pemex workers are at both ends of the crimes some as victims but others as instigators participants or informants
emboldened by the impunity and graft that have enabled crime nationwide some locals have turned to illicit businesses joining or seeking to start gangs that steal pemex fuel machinery and supplies
others are targeting relatively current and former pemex workers such as barrera
in a statement pemex said it has zero tolerance with any worker involved in any the company said it cooperates with local state and federal police to investigate illegal activity but declined to comment on specific episodes or cases involving individual workers mentioned in this story
during a recent interview carlos trevino pemex s chief executive conceded that employees are increasingly at risk because of their jobs and pay
petroleros have a better salary than many other people he said using the spanish term for oil industry workers
across mexico trevino added the company is increasing measures to ensure the security of personnel and property
it has taken its name and logo off trucks
it told workers to stop wearing pemex uniforms off site
still he said it s hard to have a completely safe this thing in tabasco he added it s not mexico s first known oil discovery took place in tabasco in
manuel gil y saenz a priest was rushing to see his ill mother when his horse s hoof got stuck in black sludge according to a local history of the find
despite warnings by natives that a witch there turned people into salt the priest returned and began tapping the oil
with partners he later sold his venture to a british oil company
in mexico expropriated oil assets and created petroleos mexicanos as pemex is formally known
over the following decades production grew in other regions along the gulf coast
in prospectors found a giant deposit known as the mesozoic oilfield prompting a rush to develop the state
to handle growing output from tabasco pemex in began building the dos bocas port and terminal in paraiso a hot marshy town of people surrounded by cacao and coconut plantations
for locals who previously subsisted on agriculture and fishing pemex came and changed our lives said ricardo hernandez daza head of a local union of roughly workers who staff many industry sites
barrera the auditor now seeking asylum joined pemex in
that year the country s oil output reached a record high and opportunities seemed boundless
mexico was one of many producers poised to benefit from steadily climbing prices as the global industry before the shale boom faced peak oil the assumption that most of the world s supply was known and diminishing
first hired as a maintenance worker barrera worked his way up through other positions got training and eventually began reviewing company accounts for a salary of about a month
he married a fellow pemex auditor bought two cars and enjoyed regular seafood outings with his wife their daughter and two stepsons
until oil prices plunged
barrera weathered initial pemex layoffs but in november was let go
he immediately sought other jobs but with many others already scrambling for work he found only occasional freelance assignments
soon paraiso was reeling
two brothers mario and pedro maciel emerged as local crime bosses according to state prosecutors
rumours swirled they had set up a branch of the jalisco new generation cartel known for drug trafficking fuel theft and countless other crimes across mexico
some gulf of mexico oil workers many of whom come from inland states were already getting extorted by the cartel on trips into jalisco new generation territory
alayn herver a native of the central state from which the cartel took its name until last year worked on offshore oil rigs that dot the tabasco shoreline
because of the intense schedules required there herver would spend two weeks on the rigs and then two weeks on leave back home in jalisco
in october while in a bar in his hometown of ciudad guzman a stranger approached him and demanded roughly about half his monthly salary
we know you earn well the man said
do you want something to happen to you at first herver thought the man was joking
outside though some of the man s colleagues awaited in an suv ready to take him to an atm
herver realized they were members of the jalisco cartel
he paid the men who told him a similar payoff would be expected each month
for half a year herver complied
the transaction became so routine that the gang members appeared to lose interest
herver didn t report the extortion
like many mexicans he was wary of widespread corruption in police ranks and feared they would only make matters worse
the following april he decided to skip a payment
on his next trip home in may local police pulled him over herver said
they handcuffed him and put him in their patrol car
you ve got yourself into trouble he recalled one officer telling him
alejandro romero a senior officer with the ciudad guzman police force declined to comment on the incident
the jalisco state attorney general s office didn t respond to requests for comment
as another policeman followed in herver s car a mini cooper the officers drove to a spot near the city dump he said
there six armed men including the gang member who first approached him pummeled herver
pull his pants down one of the gangsters said
they beat his bare buttocks with a paddle and repeatedly threatened to rape him
one of the assailants put a gun to his head while another grabbed his cell phone and began posting live video to herver s own facebook feed
horrified friends and family watched the raw footage shifting from herver s drained expression to of his bloody behind
i thought they were going to kill me herver said
instead they let him go keeping the mini as payment
in paraiso the maciel brothers denied connections to the cartel or any such crimes
they published an open letter on facebook stating they were citizens
we are a family they wrote in the letter dedicated to its work for pemex at dos bocas the port
a worker named pedro maciel did in fact work for pemex in tabasco as recently as according to a database of company workers reviewed by reuters
mario s name didn t appear in the registry
for locals the brothers reassurances made little difference
it was already apparent that a pemex job wasn t what it once was
others besides the maciel brothers were suspected across paraiso of using their positions as perches from which to steal fuel extort workers and commit other crimes
those familiar with the industry say it makes sense that criminals not just victims could emerge from the pemex payroll
even if not committing atrocities themselves some employees are believed to cooperate with gangs for their own cut of the proceeds or merely out of fear
they know the guts of the place so they can provide information said raul munoz a former pemex chief executive who now has private business with the company in tabasco and says he faces regular security problems
everyone wants a piece of the barrera the auditor and his family soon were swept up in the action
last october kidnappers captured a
days before after three decades of pemex service he had received a retirement bonus of roughly
within days the family cobbled together a ransom of about
the kidnappers released him
with contact information stolen from his telephone though they began calling friends and family demanding more
the declined to speak with reuters about the kidnapping
like herver the family opted not to go to the police
pemex s workforce is contaminated barrera said echoing family members who believe the kidnapping was planned with inside information
the workers are feasting on one last november barrera secured a few weeks work as a pemex contractor
the threats grew closer
a colleague told barrera s wife who still works at pemex that suspicious men had been asking about her outside the office gates
colleagues then told barrera that armed men were waiting outside the office for him too
terrified he slept in the office that night
enough he thought
barrera booked a ticket to canada where mexicans can travel with no visa
he landed in toronto last christmas and applied for asylum
he hopes to bring his family who moved to villahermosa tabasco s capital in order to avoid the gangsters in paraiso
herver the rig worker whose beating was streamed live on facebook also fled to canada
i was doing well at pemex he said
but after the assault my only alternative was to he too applied for asylum
a spokeswoman for the immigration and refugee board of canada declined to comment on either case citing privacy laws
on january coordinated shootings erupted overnight across paraiso
among the dead the maciel brothers
local prosecutors said they were killed in a dispute
their assassins prosecutors added died two months later in a shootout with police
even what should be legitimate business is getting more violent
daza the local union boss said his sprawling collective of construction welding tubing and other labourers has grown aggressive to protect its share of dwindling oil work
the union is one of many independent labour groups that represent workers and compete with one another for industry jobs
among other tactics he admits to assaulting rival union members to keep them from job sites
they wield baseball bats not firearms or knives to avoid felony charges he said
when strangers in rental cars arrive in paraiso the union and others like it send members to their hotel to demand work at whatever project they re planning
if they don t deliver the unions sometimes shut sites down
the tactics are not out of the ordinary in a country and industry where corrupt labour leaders are known to bribe both companies and members in exchange for keeping positions filled
but they have also fuelled job losses
because of the unions demands oil services companies oro negro and constructora y perforadora latina left depriving paraiso of jobs according to a local newspaper report
neither of the companies based in mexico city responded to requests for comment
daza said he has little choice but to use force at a time when the oil business is both the root of paraiso s problems and its only hope of recovery
we re in danger of extinction daza said
if nobody comes to save us we re additional reporting by shadia nasralla in london
