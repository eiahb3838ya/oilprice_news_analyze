vw's labour boss says eu c02 rules could ruin profits
stuttgart reuters volkswagen s labor chief bernd osterloh said the german carmaker needed to sell million electric cars by to comply with proposed european union rules a step which may ruin profits
european lawmakers will vote on tightening emissions rules in july to help the bloc cut overall greenhouse gas emissions by at least percent below levels by
of course the auto industry has some homework to do but if the infrastructure is not there then it is difficult to convince a person to buy an electric car osterloh told the stuttgart press club
carmakers say governments need to help subsidize the roll out of essential infrastructure such as charging points on streets and in homes to help make the vehicles popular
osterloh who spoke on wednesday said the industry would struggle if electric cars did not gain traction with consumers given the investment companies were having to make to develop the new vehicles
he said without sufficient demand from consumers carmakers faced a choice between paying fines for exceeding carbon dioxide limits or encouraging sales with prices too low to earn a profit
once prices are ruined we will never get them back up osterloh said
