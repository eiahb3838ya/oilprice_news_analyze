update 1-nuclear, coal bailout worth any cost 'to keep america free' -us energy chief
washington reuters energy secretary rick perry said on thursday that bailing out struggling coal and nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong and that the cost to americans should not be an issue
you can not put a dollar figure on the cost to keep america free he told reporters at a press conference in washington when asked about the administration s effort to extend the lives of the facilities
when asked about the cost of a potential bailout he said he did not yet know
we look at the electricity grid as every bit as important to national security as making sure we have the right number of ships aircraft and personnel he said
what is your freedom worth president donald trump ordered the department of energy doe to take emergency measures to slow the retirements of coal and nuclear power plants arguing those kinds of facilities can store months of fuel on site and therefore withstand supply disruptions that could be caused by storms hacks or physical attacks
the effort fits neatly with the administration s broader agenda to boost fossil fuels production and to save the coal industry but has been criticized by an unusual alliance of drillers renewable energy advocates environmentalists regulators and grid operators who say it is unnecessary and unfair
aging coal and nuclear facilities have been shuttering at a rapid pace in recent years pushed out by cheaper natural gas as well as renewable energy sources like wind and solar a driving factor in declining emissions of greenhouse gases
the trump administration considers natural gas and renewable energy vulnerable however because plants rely on pipelines that can be disrupted and solar and wind facilities only produce energy under certain weather conditions
perry pointed out that nearly all military bases rely on power from the civilian grid
the doe is currently studying ways to bail out coal and nuclear facilities including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them
perry said the doe is examining the costs now
federal energy regulators rejected a previous effort by perry to require them to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing resilience to the grid
that did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration
in late march firstenergy s firstenergy solutions unit which runs coal and nuclear power units called on the energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors
coal company ceo robert murray of murray energy also called for perry to use emergency powers to save coal plants
