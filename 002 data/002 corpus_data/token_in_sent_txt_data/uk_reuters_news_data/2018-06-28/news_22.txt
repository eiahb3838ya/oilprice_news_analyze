saudi arabia's sabic working on tightening clariant ties -sources
reuters saudi basic industries corp sabic is considering increasing its holding in clariant and pursuing joint ventures as the saudi firm looks to strengthen ties with the swiss chemicals group sources told reuters
the world s number four chemical firm bought a percent stake in clariant this year and is expected to intensify research and development with the swiss specialty chemicals maker as well as hike its stake over time the sources said
it already has a new partnership with clariant that licenses chemical process technology to customers including huntsman and akzo nobel
sabic s narrative is clearly not to stay at percent and do nothing a person close to the matter said adding that a combination of businesses would precede any potential merger
in january sabic said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover of clariant
however the group wants to extract value from its investment in a friendly manner the sources said adding that it does not want to be perceived as an aggressive acquirer and any attempt to hike its stake may take time
sabic declined to comment while a spokesman for clariant said it was in ongoing talks with sabic about possible future collaboration prospects and any outcome would be communicated at the appropriate time
middle eastern firms have been eager to expand into advanced downstream chemicals operations like the catalysts that clariant produces to help speed up processes at chemicals plants
saudi oil company saudi aramco in bought half the synthetic rubber business of germany s lanxess for around billion euros
the moves show that saudi companies are increasingly trying to raise their influence outside the kingdom as part of the ambitious vision plan which was set out by crown prince mohammed bin salman to diversify the country s economy from oil
sabic which is percent owned by saudi arabia s public investment fund sovereign wealth fund would initially stop short of taking control of clariant which has a market value of billion the sources said
under swiss takeover rules anybody with percent of the shares would have to make an offer for the full company
while sabic s purchase of a stake in clariant ended the swiss firm s fight with activist investors it must be vetted by regulators in countries including brazil germany and austria
the sources said the deal would be cleared during the summer and would pave the way to the implementation of closer ties
clariant s boss hariolf kottmann told investors in march that management viewed sabic s commitment as very positive and a strategic update would be provided in september
plastics production is an area where sabic may implement closer ties with clariant two of the sources said
sabic has a strong plastics business since its billion purchase of ge plastics in and a combination with clariant s would make sense one of the sources said
plastics coatings accounts for more than percent of clariant s billion francs in annual sales
although the division s revenue grew by percent last year producing much of clariant s cash flow its profitability trails that of divisions like catalysts and care chemicals which include soap and shampoo ingredients
last year clariant abandoned a billion deal with group huntsman to create the world s specialty chemicals maker behind evonik after opposition from activist investors
