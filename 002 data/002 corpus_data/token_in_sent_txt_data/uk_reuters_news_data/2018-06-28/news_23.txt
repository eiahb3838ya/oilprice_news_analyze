half of south asia living in vulnerable climate "hotspots" -world bank
new delhi reuters changes in temperature and rainfall will impact almost half of south asia in the coming decades reducing economic growth in one of the world s poorest regions the world bank said
a world bank report released on thursday analyses two scenarios climate sensitive based on collective action by nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensive which assumes no action on climate change
the report combines future changes in temperature and rainfall with household survey data linking living standards to weather conditions for the first time
more than million people now live in areas predicted to become hotspots or affected areas by under the carbon intensive scenario with india accounting for almost three quarters of them the report said
moderate hotspots are areas where projected consumption spending declines by percent and severe ones are where the drop exceeds percent
there seems to be some kind of correlation between climate hotspots and water stressed areas muthukumara mani a world bank economist said
the world bank s expectation of about half of india living in moderately or areas by tallies with a federal think tank s report two weeks ago
this warned that million indians could suffer high to extreme water stress as the country faces the worst water crisis in its history
rising temperature and changing monsoon rainfall patterns from climate change could cost india percent of gross domestic product gdp and depress the living standards of one in every two indians by the world bank report said
in terms of gdp per capita it predicted changes in average weather would hit bangladeshis living in severe hotspots the hardest among south asians
it projected a percent fall in income by for them
the comparative figures for sri lanka and india were percent and percent respectively under the carbon intensive scenario
nepal and afghanistan as well as hilly areas in india may benefit from the weather changes because of their colder climates
however their extensive reliance on streams fed by melting snow would mean that higher temperatures may affect timing and availability of water resources
climate changes will impact you based on where you live and what you do said mani who is also the main author of the report
inland areas would be more affected than coastal areas and mountainous regions and the most vulnerable would be those dependent on agriculture as their main livelihood he added
targeted policies such as enhancing educational attainment reducing water stress and improving opportunities in the sector could reduce the impact of climate change on living standards the report added
