u.s. house panel investigating pruitt's condo rental
washington april reuters a congressional panel is investigating environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt s use of a condominium tied to an energy lobbyist a house republican aide said on saturday
the house of representatives oversight committee chaired by republican representative trey gowdy has begun looking into pruitt s housing arrangements according to the aide who was not authorized to speak publicly
the epa had no immediate comment
the panel s probe adds to the pressure on pruitt a vocal critic of mainstream climate change science who sued the epa more than a dozen times when he was oklahoma s attorney general
many democrats and even a few republicans have said should resign or be fired
lawmakers have been scrutinizing pruitt for renting a room in a townhouse by the wife of energy industry lobbyist steven hart for a night an arrangement that has drawn fire from ethics experts
media reports say the payment is less than the price of similar properties
hart lobbies for companies regulated by the epa
pruitt is also under fire for frequent air travel and for purchasing costly items for his office including a soundproof telephone booth
i don t have a lot of patience with that kind of stuff gowdy said of pruitt in a video released by the environmental group friends of the earth
you ve just got to be a good steward of public as part of the committee s investigation the epa has produced documents including a memo from the epa ethics office that initially cleared pruitt of accepting a gift from a lobbyist but did not address whether he broke other federal ethics regulations
an administration official said pruitt met with president donald trump on friday morning a week after white house chief of staff john kelly advocated for trump to fire him
trump told reporters on thursday that he would take a look into ethics allegations against pruitt but added the official was doing a fantastic reporting by david morgan editing by tim ahmann and sandra maler
