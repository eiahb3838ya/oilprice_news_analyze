interview-california's air regulator says state could back some emissions rule changes
new york reuters california s top clean air regulator told reuters on monday the state is willing to give automakers more flexibility to comply with vehicle emissions rules even as her agency prepares to fight the trump administration over car and truck pollution standards
mary nichols who chairs the california air resources board said in an interview she thinks the trump administration california and automakers can reach agreement to revise and extend the standards
we think there s a way you could give some recognition to the concerns of the auto companies have raised that would not do fundamental damage to those standards nichols said suggesting the state could endorse new credits and flexibilities or she said the state s precondition for discussing changing the rules is that you also need to talk to us about the next set of rules extending to at least
last week scott pruitt administrator of the environmental protection agency said the standards on model year to vehicles were not appropriate and should be revised reversing a decision by the obama administration in january that had sought to lock in the rules
nichols said california and other states are actively examining a lawsuit challenging pruitt s decision on the appropriateness of the rules before the administration proposes specific changes to the requirements
a legal filing seeking to preserve states rights is under consideration but does not mean they could not still try to reach agreement with automakers and the federal government
we can sue and talk at the same time nichols said
the obama standards agreed to by california and major automakers called for roughly doubling by the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the united states to about miles km per gallon by
proponents said they could help spur innovation in clean technologies
auto industry executives asked the trump administration to revise the obama standards to make it less costly to meet complex emissions and fuel economy targets which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks
nichols said federal and state governments and automakers should work on setting rules through and suggested california is open to a significant overhaul of the way the emissions rules work
she rejected the idea that there is a crisis facing automakers in meeting existing emissions rules
she said current federal corporate average fuel economy standards do not effectively incentivize electric vehicles or other advanced vehicles
those standards commonly known as cafe were set in in response to the arab oil embargos
nichols said the state could agree to new credits to account for zero emission ride sharing vehicles or revise earlier rules that held automakers accountable for upstream emissions from the generation of power for electric vehicles
california has long been allowed by an epa waiver to impose stricter standards than washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants but the state agreed to adopt the obama emissions rules in
and other states including new york pennsylvania and massachusetts follow california s lead on cleaner cars
the trump administration has not shared any data with california yet and there have been no substantial talks with the state and federal regulators nichols said
a primary concern among automakers is to avoid overlapping conflicting regulatory standards
the national highway traffic safety administration sets corporate average fuel economy or cafe requirements that are not identical to the epa limits on vehicle carbon dioxide emissions
automakers agree and we do too that the cafe standards have somewhat outlived their usefulness nichols said
auto regulations should be focused on overall vehicle emissions as the driving factor she said
