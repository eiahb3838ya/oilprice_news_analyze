national grid forecasts low electricity demand in britain this summer
london april reuters britain s national grid said on tuesday it expects low demand for electricity this summer as renewables output increases
in its summer outlook report national grid said peak transmission system demand for high summer was forecast at gigawatts gw and the summer minimum at gw
the increase in distribution connected generation for example wind and solar pv has contributed to this downward trend in demand the grid operator said in the report
however increased renewables output can create challenges
as a result we may need to take more actions to curtail generation and possibly instruct inflexible generators to reduce their output in order to balance the system the report added
total uk gas demand for this summer is forecast at billion cubic metres slightly lower than last summer
however national grid said its expects one of the highest volumes of maintenance on the gas transmission system to date this summer
