saudi-led coalition says it does not seek permanent yemen presence
dubai reuters the spokesman for a coalition said on tuesday that its military campaign in yemen was not aimed at establishing a permanent presence along the country s west coast but at restoring its internationally recognised government
a yemeni official had told reuters that saudi arabia and its main ally the united arab emirates would likely seek to remain deployed along the country s red sea coast where it is currently fighting an offensive against the houthi movement
saudi arabia and uae are very worried about iran s influence so they are seeking to keep some military presence on the yemeni coasts even if the civil war ends said the official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
in a response to a request for comment the coalition denied the allegation
the coalition is working by all means to restore yemen s legitimacy so it can become stable and secure spokesman colonel turki said in a statement
the yemeni republic will restore its role in protecting its lands and territorial waters as well as contributing to the maintenance of regional and international security he added
the kingdom and its mostly gulf arab allies intervened in a civil war in yemen in to roll back the houthis after they had pushed the government into saudi exile
coalition and yemeni forces have been making modest territorial gains in recent months against the group in an armed push moving northward from the bab strait toward the port city of hodeidah
yemen lies beside the southern mouth of the red sea one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers which pass near yemen s shores while heading from the middle east through the suez canal to europe
