update 3-hydro denies brazil alumina plant contaminated local environment
oslo reuters aluminium producer norsk hydro denied on monday its alunorte alumina refinery in brazil had contaminated local waters contradicting the findings of a brazilian public health group
citing an internal study and a report commissioned from green consultancy sgw services hydro said no evidence was found of overflow from its bauxite deposits or of any significant or lasting environmental impact
the company has previously admitted making some unregulated spills of untreated water which it said was completely hydro reiterated on monday it would improve the plant s water treatment
both reports confirm our previous statements that there was no overflow from the bauxite residue deposit areas as well as no indication or evidence of contamination to nearby local communities from alunorte as a result of the heavy rainfall in february hydro ceo svein richard brandtzaeg said in a statement
the public prosecutors office in the northern brazilian state of para where alunorte is located said in a statement that scientific evidence shows the serious impact of regular discharges from the plant disputing hydro s account
any attempt to conceal this fact is a violent attack on the rights of families who have had their health and livelihoods seriously undermined it said
alunorte is currently running at about percent capacity under a judicial order
the firm believes the two environmental reports will help the company win permission to resume full output from the plant brandtzaeg told reuters
this puts the facts on the table and gives us a foundation for resolving the situation he said adding the firm was in a constructive dialogue with local authorities
alunorte is the world s largest alumina refinery with around employees and a production capacity of million tonnes transforming bauxite to alumina which is turned into aluminium at smelters
hydro shares close up percent outperforming a flat oslo benchmark index and extending gains from before the firm s statement was published
they were benefiting from sanctions imposed on rival rusal of russia traders said
on april alunorte sued prosecutors in the brazilian state of para asking a court to reject findings from the evandro chagas institute a public health research organisation
marcelo lima a researcher at the institute in an interview on monday repeated that its analysis was scientifically rigorous and in line with international standards
in late february brazilian authorities ordered hydro to temporarily halve its output from the plant
