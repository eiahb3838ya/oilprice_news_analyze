japan energy panel sees role for nuclear in 2050 emissions targets
tokyo reuters an influential japanese energy panel on tuesday left the door open to building nuclear plants to help meet emissions targets urging rapid technology improvements to allow industry to develop safer and more economic reactors
the advisory panel whose recommendations will feed into a review of the country s basic energy plan and its measures to cut carbon emissions by said japan should reduce its dependence on nuclear power shift from coal to gas and boost renewable energy
however it listed nuclear power as an option for decarbonization in implying the possibility of new reactors which is not part of the current policy of the ministry of economy trade and industry
the report does not specifically talk about possible building of new reactors or replacing existing reactors but it does not deny such a possibility either shogo tanaka director of the ministry s energy strategy office told reporters
nuclear faces strong public opposition in the wake of the deadly fukushima disaster with just five of the country s commercially viable reactors currently operating
the closures have boosted japan s reliance on coal and natural gas and it is currently the world s carbon emitter
the country has pledged to trim its emissions from levels by percent by and by percent by
it is currently aiming for a electricity mix of percent renewables percent nuclear and percent fossil fuels including percent gas and percent coal
in the fiscal year to march fossil fuels accounted for percent of japan s electricity renewables percent and nuclear just percent
the advisory panel made up of industry and academic representatives and including hitachi ltd chairman hiroaki nakanishi did not give a proposed energy mix for future years
it called for a further boost in renewable energy to make the sector a key and economically independent power source by citing accelerating development in hydrogen and energy storage technology
while urging a shift away from coal it also recommended the continued development and export of coal power technology to help curb emissions overseas
