column-saudi efforts to raise crude prices get chinese slap: russell

by clyde russell singapore april reuters saudi aramco may have shot itself in the foot by unexpectedly increasing the price of its crude oil to asia with a major chinese refiner responding by sharply cutting back on the volume of cargoes from the world s top exporter
sinopec asia s largest refiner aims to slash its crude oil imports from saudi arabia s state producer by percent in may according to an official from the company s trading arm unipec
such a large cut sends two very clear messages to aramco the first being that sinopec didn t agree with the price hike and the second that the chinese refiner feels it can make up any shortfall from other suppliers
it s an almost unprecedented response by a significant buyer of saudi crude and it underlines the extent to which the market was caught by surprise by aramco s decision to increase the official selling prices osps for cargoes
and it s not just sinopec that is sending a message with trading sources at two north asian refiners saying they also plan to reduce volumes from saudi arabia by percent in may
aramco boosted the osp for its benchmark arab light grade for asian customers for may cargoes to a premium of a barrel over the average of quotes for regional grades oman and dubai up cents from the prior month
the market had been expecting a cut of between and cents a barrel based on movements in the price curve between and cash dubai prices
unlike brent and west texas intermediate the two largest global crude benchmarks the dubai market is in contango where prices for cargoes are higher than those for immediate delivery
this suggested to the market that aramco would lower their osp as the company usually sets its osps in line with changes in the pricing structure for dubai crude
aramco doesn t disclose reasons for changes in its pricing leaving the market somewhat nonplussed at the action
the most plausible explanation for the deviation from previous practice is that aramco is doing its best to keep oil prices high ahead of its planned initial public offering ipo
the listing which is slated for later this year but is probably more likely in needs a strong oil price to be successful with a figure above a barrel seen as a minimum
brent crude is currently around a barrel meaning the saudis have to continue to do everything possible to keep the price biased higher
up to now the main vehicle for boosting prices has been the deal to cut output struck by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and allied producers including russia
the surprise increase in the osp for its major customers in asia may be another tactic aimed at keeping oil prices strong
but as the sinopec reaction shows aramco may end up with the worst of possible outcomes
it s likely to continue to surrender market share to rivals in china and if sinopec has no difficulty obtaining alternative supplies it undermines any narrative that oil markets are tight and prices should rise further
saudi arabia used to be china s largest supplier of crude oil but has lost that spot to russia in the past two years
chinese customs data showed imports from saudi arabia rose only percent on from the previous year below the overall increase of percent
imports from russia jumped percent and those from supplier angola by percent
detailed figures for are only available for the first two months of the year but these show china s imports from saudi arabia down by percent while those from russia surged percent and those from angola rose by percent
if angola continues to gain market share in china it may well overtake saudi arabia to take second spot behind russia this year a possibility that surely should concern aramco s executives and their political masters
it appears as if the saudis are increasingly putting themselves between a rock and a hard place
they need to keep the crude price high to boost the ipo but face the loss of market share in asia and potential damage to relations with customers
