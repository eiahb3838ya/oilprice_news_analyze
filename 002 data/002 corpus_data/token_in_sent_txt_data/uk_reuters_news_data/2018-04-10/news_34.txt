serbian president calls on balkan peers to create common market
mostar bosnia april reuters serbia s president called on western balkan countries to settle their differences and create a common market to attract badly needed foreign investment
armed conflict in the balkans ended more than years ago but five of the states that emerged after the former yugoslavia broke up bosnia macedonia montenegro kosovo and serbia still have border disputes to settle
all five along with albania hope to join the european union which has called on them to settle their disputes before they join but little progress has been made
serbian president aleksandar vucic told a business fair in the bosnian town of mostar the six need to work more closely to create a better investment climate
split into small states and even smaller markets we have nothing to look and hope for
our only chance to catch up with the rest of the world is in creating a much bigger market in the future vucic said
he said economic cooperation could also help build stability and peace in the region where persistent ethnic tensions still block economic progress
such a market could attract more investors open bigger projects create jobs and fuel growth and development vucic said
to create the market the six countries need to lift barriers to the flow of goods and people harmonise taxes and abolish fiscal charges vucic said
such measures could attract up to billion euros in investment in coming years more than triple their current value he said
our businessmen need it more than our politicians vucic said operating costs for companies whose trucks wait as long as hours more than necessary to cross borders have increased by percent
but to create a common market belgrade would need to resolve all outstanding issues with kosovo among others
little progress has been made there despite eu meditation belgrade still refuses to recognise kosovo s independence
the idea of a common market has drawn a mixed response in the region
some of the countries fear it would be dominated by serbia
it would mean a lot for boosting economic ties said pane skrbic a member of the european association of managers
the businessmen have been erasing these borders much more easily than politicians
