repeats april column

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london april reuters hedge funds trimmed their bullish position in crude oil and fuels in the most recent week after increasing it significantly over the previous fortnight
but the overall reduction conceals a sharp shift away from light crude wti and towards the international marker brent according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges
hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by million barrels in the week to april
portfolio managers cut their net long position in wti nymex and ice by million barrels while trimming their net long in brent by just million barrels
the fall in wti net length was the largest reduction since the end of august when hurricanes disrupted the refining system and continues a trend evident in recent weeks
funds have been steadily cutting their exposure to wti over the last two months while maintaining a strong bullish position in brent
the net long position in wti has fallen by million barrels since it peaked on even as the net position in brent has risen by an extra million barrels over the same period
the result is that the position in brent now looks exceptionally stretched while positioning in wti looks far less lopsided
fund managers now hold almost long positions in brent for every short position a record imbalance up from a ratio of on
by contrast funds hold fewer than nine long positions in wti for every short down from a ratio of almost in late january
the shift in relative positioning between wti and brent mirrors the changing calendar spreads at the front end of the futures curve
the calendar spread in wti has gradually eased from backwardation towards contango since the start of february
crude stocks have been increasing around the wti delivery point at cushing and there are reports of spreading pipeline bottlenecks throughout the west region
by contrast brent calendar spreads have remained firmly in backwardation and recently tightened again after softening during much of the last three months
hedge funds are being drawn from wti towards brent in the search for roll yield long positions have a positive yield in a backwardated market but cost money to maintain in a contango market
with oil prices having been basically flat since december roll yield is becoming increasingly important to portfolio managers
