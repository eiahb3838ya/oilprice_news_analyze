cryptocurrency miners seek cheap energy in norway and sweden
reuters cryptocurrency miners are moving in to norway and sweden to take advantage of cheap energy and low temperatures to power and cool their servers
iceland has been europe s most popular location for miners of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum
but at euro cents and cents per kilowatt hours respectively commercial power prices in sweden and norway are cheaper than iceland s cents and far below the european average of cents
the interest is good news for sweden s vattenfall and norway s statkraft the dominant utilities in their countries
supplying power to cryptocurrency miners is a tiny part of current business but the two firms have said they see it as an opportunity
the process is energy intensive
miners plug in thousands of servers at a time to get the computing power to produce cryptocurrencies which is done by solving mathematical equations
miners of bitcoin will use about terawatt hours of energy this year matching argentina s consumption or the projected usage of all the world s electric vehicles by the according to morgan stanley
we re on a global hunt to secure as much power as we can said olivier roussy newton director and of canadian group hive blockchain technologies which started mining ethereum in sweden in january
the company said it was expanding energy capacity for its crypto mining in sweden to megawatts with funds available to ramp up a further mw by september
last month it agreed to buy data centre company kolos norway as for million million pounds with a view to expanding its mining operations
in march miner bitfury opened a new million mining data centre in norway
the miner will be buying gigawatt hours of pure clean energy from local renewable energy provider helgeland kraft
many bitcoin miners are looking at the area including the chinese because of abundant cheap hydro power said bill tai a member of bitfury s board of directors
china s bitmain the world s largest bitcoin miner which recently set up a unit in switzerland has also been investigating sweden and norway s potential two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said
china accounts for around percent of the crytopcurrency mining industry but beijing has discouraged it in part due to concerns about pollution from power
this has forced them to look elsewhere
a lot of miners are keen to get into norway and that includes bitmain and other chinese names said mark collins chief executive of cbh consulting ag a clean energy consultant running for the blockchain industry
a second source with knowledge of the matter also mentioned bitmain s interest
a number of nationalities are turning to the nordics that source said
bitmain spokesman nishant sharma said the company would announce expansions in europe and other regions as they occur
he said he was not aware of any special plans for sweden or norway
mining a single bitcoin requires worth of electricity up to a quarter of the total costs and about the annual power bill of a household in germany
this means that cryptocurrency miners are under pressure from policymakers to prove their green credentials and norway and sweden s clean energy holds even greater appeal
this area is the saudi arabia of green energy said tai
in norway hydropower accounts for over percent of electricity production while in sweden the number is about percent with the same again from nuclear
some utilities in europe such as italy s enel and germany s are worried that the speculation behind cryptocurrencies could lead to a market crash
enel said in february it was not interested in powering cryptocurrency miners
but norway and sweden have welcomed the business
it is an opportunity for energy providers in the area
it s a consistent power draw for them without spikes and troughs and energy providers like that said collins
norway recently changed tax rules to exempt data centres from paying property taxes in a bid to attract foreign companies
node pole a swedish investment advisor owned by vattenfall and smaller peer skelleftea kraft helped chinese tech company canaan creative a miner and one of the world s largest makers of bitcoin mining chips to set up shop in sweden last year
for the last months there has been an increasing interest in opportunities in sweden node pole chief executive patrik oehlund said
vattenfall provides canaan with the roughly mw of power capacity it needs and the utility sees more bitcoin deals on the horizon
there are a number of companies in different phases of evaluating establishment on the nordic market said matts wesslen vattenfall s manager of energy intensive industries
nevertheless alex de vries blockchain specialist at pwc said the opportunities in cryptocurrency mining may be
if bitcoin energy consumption continues like it does today it will become unsustainable he said
that might be an opportunity for utilities in the but over the miners will have to find ways to become more efficient to cut electricity for a graphic on bitcoin energy consumption click additional reporting by patricia uhlig in frankfurt and lefteris karagiannopoulos in oslo editing by anna willard
