update 2-china utilities plan new coal import price index to curb volatility
huaneng datang zhejiang working on index plan exec utilities have complained about wild volatility in prices index to cover pct of china coal imports plan comes as utilities fret over falling imports updating with reaction comment by meng meng and josephine mason beijing april reuters china s major utilities are preparing to launch their own coal price index for imports an official at china huaneng group said in a move the power firms hope will give them more control over how much they pay for their key raw material
huaneng is working on the plan with china datang corp guangdong yuedean group and zhejiang energy said xu zanfei director of planning for huaneng s fuel department in a presentation at the coaltrans china conference
the plan for an index also has the backing of smaller power companies he said
even as china s government tries to cut the use of dirty fuels coal still accounts for a majority of the country s power
utilities have complained over the past two years that a prolonged rally in prices to record highs due to tighter supplies of the fuel and strong demand has hurt profits
the plan also comes as utility executives say they are increasingly worried the government will expand efforts to curb imports potentially fueling another rally and cutting their access to raw materials
imports are expected to fall percent this year
the new index which xu said will be launched soon will cover percent of china s total coal intake and will offer prices for southern and eastern imports
the utilities hope the huge volumes involved in supplying major chinese power producers will induce coal suppliers to use the index in their contracts
we hope china can have some consistency in its import policy
imported coal is crucial for power plants in the coastal areas especially in the summer when rail freight capacity is tight xu said
speaking on the conference sidelines after his presentation xu said the index will mainly reflect prices for material from austrialia and indonesia which together accounted for almost of china s coal imports last year
zhao jianguo the vice chairman of china s coal transportation association said the index has a decent chance of being used as an industry benchmark because it has backing from major utilities
this index is likely to be influential because it will reflect prices purchased by power plants he said on the sidelines of the conference
this would be china s first price index for coal imports
the price index bspi is a widely used spot price benchmark for domestic trade
companies have different schemes for pricing their imports but traders said having a coal price index may help make the market more transparent
