update 4-china agrees to import more from u.s., no sign of $200 bln figure
washington reuters china has agreed to significantly increase its purchases of goods and services the two countries said on saturday but made no mention of a billion target the white house had touted earlier
beijing and washington agreed they would keep talking about measures under which china would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the united states to close the billion annual goods and services trade deficit with china
a joint statement issued at the conclusion of intensive trade talks in washington did not indicate whether the two countries would delay or drop their tariff threats on billions of dollars worth of each country s goods which has sparked fears of a wider trade war and roiled financial markets
there was a consensus on taking effective measures to substantially reduce the united states trade deficit in goods with china the joint statement said
to meet the growing consumption needs of the chinese people and the need for economic development china will significantly increase purchases of united states goods and president donald trump has threatened to impose tariffs on up to billion on chinese goods to combat what his administration says is beijing s misappropriation of intellectual property through joint venture requirements and other policies that force technology transfers
beijing denies such coercion and has threatened equal retaliation including tariffs on some of its largest imports among them aircraft soybeans and autos
a report by china s xinhua news agency described the statement from the two governments as vowing not to launch a trade war against each while the statement said the two sides would engage at high levels and seek to resolve their economic and trade concerns in a proactive manner it made no mention of tariffs
it said there was consensus between washington and beijing on the need to create favourable conditions to increase trade in manufactured goods and services
this could be a reference to china s previous pledges to open up more economic sectors to services
a commentary published by xinhua on sunday declared the statement a good example of noting that it would help america reduce its trade deficit by increasing exports to china and allow china to diversify and raise the quality of its imports
it also argued that china has always resisted any unreasonable demands by the united states never compromising or accepting restrictive conditions
the commentary added that a resolution to the trade dispute will be complicated difficult and take a long time
the united states will also send a team to china to work out the details of increased agricultural and energy exports the countries said without specifying timing
a senior official said that during discussions with a member of president xi jinping s office china was considering a package that relied on major purchases of liquefied natural gas including a contract for a firm to build lng receiving and processing facilities in china
the package which also would include new commitments on intellectual property protections could be agreed by a potential visit to washington by china s vice president wang qishan the official said
trump made cutting the trade deficit with china a promise in his presidential campaign
during an initial round of talks earlier this month inbeijing washington demanded that china reduce its trade surplus by billion a figure most economists say is impossible to achieve because it would require a massive change in the composition of commerce between the two countries
as of late thursday officials were still pressing china to agree to that size reduction
but economists say that level would be extremely difficult to achieve especially as tax cuts are spurring demand for more imports
the billion figure is equivalent to about of boeing co s annual aircraft production and is larger than all of the united states global annual agricultural and oil exports
eswar prasad a cornell university trade professor and former head of the international monetary fund s china division said that beijing had clearly balked at a specific quantitative commitment
it is a very limited and tentative agreement mainly designed to deescalate tensions prasad said of the joint statement
the statement was vague on the trump administration s core intellectual property complaints saying that both countries attach paramount importance to intellectual property protections china will advance relevant amendments to its laws and regulations including the patent there are concerns among some legislators and trade experts that trump could give priority to a narrower trade deficit over tackling what they say is china s abuse of intellectual property rights
any deal under which china would import more goods could easily be reversed economists say
the statement made no mention of whether there would be a relaxation of paralysing restrictions on chinese telecommunications equipment maker zte corp imposed last month by the commerce department
the action related to violation of sanctions on iran banned american companies from selling semiconductors and other components to zte causing the company to cease operations
earlier this week trump tweeted that he directed the commerce department to put zte back in business and said the company s situation was part of an overall trade deal with china
