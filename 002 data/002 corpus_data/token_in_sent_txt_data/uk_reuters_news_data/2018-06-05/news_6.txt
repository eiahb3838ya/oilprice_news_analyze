update 2-u.s. asks opec producers to pump more oil, no specific figure -sources
reuters the united states government has unofficially asked saudi arabia and some other opec producers to raise oil output but it has not requested a specific figure three opec and industry sources said on tuesday
the request to raise output has been made unofficially from washington to each of the oil producers rather than to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries as a group the sources said
earlier on tuesday bloomberg reported that the government had asked saudi arabia and some other opec producers to increase oil production by about million barrels per day bpd
treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on may the day that president donald trump announced washington would withdraw from the iran nuclear deal and sanctions on tehran that some countries were willing to increase oil output to offset losses to the global market
a spokeswoman at the white house s national security council asked about requests for more oil output said we welcome any action that increases energy access and fosters a healthy global opec is in the midst of a deal with russia and other
with oil recently reaching a barrel the highest level since producers are discussing easing some of the cutbacks and will meet to set policy later in june
any decision has to be a collective decision and taken after debate
now the most important thing for opec is to keep this group together an opec source said
even if the has asked for million does it mean that opec and its allies would raise by million the source said
reuters reported on may that the producers were considering a supply increase of million bpd with a final decision to be made at the june meeting in vienna of opec and ministers
