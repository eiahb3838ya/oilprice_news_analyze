property losses mount on hawaii's big island as lava flow spreads
pahoa hawaii reuters a river of lava spewing from the foot of hawaii s kilauea volcano swallowed about three dozen more homes on the big island during a weekend of destruction that brought to nearly the number of dwellings devoured since last month officials said on monday
mounting property losses were reported a day after five or six people who initially chose to stay in the newly evacuated kapoho area after road access was cut off were rescued by helicopter according to the hawaii county civil defense agency
all but a few of the estimated inhabitants of kapoho and adjacent vacationland development are now believed to have fled their homes an agency spokesman said
the area lies near the site of a seaside village buried in lava from a eruption
the latest damage came from a large lava flow that crept several miles km before severing a key highway junction at kapoho on saturday and then obliterating about a half dozen blocks of the subdivision over the weekend the spokesman said
one finger of the lava poured into a small freshwater lake boiling away all its water late on saturday while another finger spilled into kapoho bay on sunday night officials said
on monday civil defense reported a total of homes and other structures destroyed across the island s larger region as the eruption from kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes continued through its day
about three dozen of those structures mostly private homes and vacation rentals were lost during the weekend in kapoho
the rest were consumed weeks earlier in the larger leilani estates subdivision several miles km to the west where fissures in the ground first opened on may
about residents have been displaced from leilani since earlier this month as fountains of lava and high concentrations of toxic sulfur dioxide gas continued unabated
a mandatory evacuation of much the subdivision was imposed last week
plumes of volcanic ash belched into the air by periodic daily explosions from the crater at kilauea s summit have posed an additional nuisance and a health concern to nearby communities
so too have airborne volcanic glass fibers called pele s hair wispy strands carried aloft by the wind from lava fountains and named for the volcano goddess of hawaiian myth
seaside residents and boaters also have been warned to avoid noxious clouds of laze a term combining the words lava and haze formed when lava reacts with seawater to form a mix of acid fumes steam and specks
lava flows have knocked out telephone and power lines causing widespread communication outages and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant that normally provides about a quarter of the island s electricity
at the same time most of the hawaii volcanoes national park one of the island s biggest tourist attractions remains closed indefinitely due to hazards from ash and volcanic rock ejected from the summit crater and accompanying earthquakes that have damaged park facilities
kilauea s current upheaval comes on the heels of an eruption cycle that began in and had continued nearly nonstop for years destroying more than homes
scientists say they are unsure whether the latest activity is part of the same eruption phase or a new one and how long it may last
