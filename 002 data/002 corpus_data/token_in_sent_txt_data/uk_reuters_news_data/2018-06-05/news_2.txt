mexico could reach 2 mln bpd oil output by 2022 - minister
mexico city june reuters mexican oil output could return to million barrels per day by about if the next government pursues plans to auction off development blocs to private investors energy minister pedro joaquin coldwell said on tuesday
mexico will elect a new president on july but the in opinion polls leftist andres manuel lopez obrador has threatened to delay opening up the energy sector to private investment
he wants further oil and gas auctions to be halted if he wins
prising open the oil and gas industry was a central pillar of president enrique pena nieto s plan to lift mexico s sluggish economic growth
however that policy has been shaken by president donald trump s threats to dump the north american free trade agreement nafta
the next mexican president is scheduled to take office in december
the current energy minister joaquin coldwell told reuters in an interview that two further auctions planned before the handover would go ahead as would tenders for seven joint ventures known as farmouts
joaquin coldwell says mexico must invest around billion to arrest a longstanding slide in production and return output to million barrels per day bpd
production which peaked at almost million in stood at million bpd in april official data show
it will probably not return to million bpd for a few more years he said
two million bpd could be in the second half of the next government if the auctions continue he said
from approximately
and three million bpd by mexican presidential terms last six years
the auctions stem from changes to mexico s energy laws and began in
however they have yet to translate into higher crude oil output in latin america s no
economy
joaquin coldwell said oil exploration and production was a process and companies that had already made discoveries could add around to bpd to output by the second half of next year
lopez obrador says the contracts awarded under the opening should be revised to ensure there was no corruption involved and that all further auctions should be halted in the meantime
several of lopez obrador s economic advisers have said they expect the process to continue after the revisions though he has floated the idea of unpicking the reform
minister joaquin coldwell said the process of auctions had been the most transparent in the history of mexico
