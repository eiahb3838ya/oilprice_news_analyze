western europe 2018 car sales to be dampened by italy, co2 -lmc
frankfurt reuters car sales growth in western europe will be tempered this year by political uncertainty surrounding italy and a new emissions test cycle which is leading to higher readings of carbon dioxide pollution forecasters lmc automotive said
lmc has lowered its forecast for sales growth in western europe to percent from percent last month lmc s european analyst david oakley said on tuesday
several carmakers including volkswagen have said they face challenges adapting their vehicle fleets to meet a new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp which is based on data rather than theoretical scenarios
because the new wltp regime gives higher readings than the old nedc system it will force some carmakers to delay road certification and sales or push vehicles into a higher tax bracket
the elephant in the room at the moment is the response of national governments and manufacturers to the new wltp emissions and fuel economy testing procedure which has the potential to cause significant tax increases in countries which have taxation regimes based on emissions oakley explained
western europe sales in may were flat when compared to the same month a year ago which lmc automotive said was a good result given that there were fewer selling days than in the month
sales in italy which was rocked by political turmoil last month fell percent in may
based on the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate saar demand improved to million cars a year up from million vehicles in april despite weak demand in britain which is down percent lmc said
