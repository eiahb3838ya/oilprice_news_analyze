insight-europe up against asian juggernaut in electric car battery drive
reuters chinese electric vehicle giant byd is looking at launching battery production in europe joining asian rivals aiming to cash in on a green car revolution and threatening attempts by brussels to nurture a industry
keen to capture a european car battery value chain that will be worth an estimated billion euros billion pounds by the european commission launched an alliance of local companies last year aiming to build huge battery factories
but only sweden s northvolt and germany s terrae have plans for large battery factories in europe so far and some leading european carmakers have already struck deals with asian suppliers setting up in hungary and poland
we are considering cell production outside of china and that includes europe julia chen global sales director at byd batteries told reuters speaking about the production of both automotive and home storage batteries
byd which also makes electric buses cars and solar panels said it was not clear where in europe a battery site might be
it would be possible wherever there s a the company which is backed by warren buffett s berkshire hathaway joins korea s sk innovation japan s gs yuasa corp and china s contemporary amperex technology catl in looking to locate battery plants in europe
south korea s lg chem samsung sdi both have european factories due to open soon while china s gsr capital already produces battery cells at a uk plant it bought from nissan
while asian electric vehicle ev cell battery factories in europe would bring jobs brussels is concerned companies in the bloc are missing out on a growth industry and risk becoming dependent on foreign technology
we have to move fast because here we are in a global race
we need to prevent technological dependence on competitors european commission vice president maros sefcovic said at the launch of the european battery alliance s action plan in may
but some investors say they are wary of backing european ev battery suppliers after seeing local solar panel firms founder in the face of cheap chinese imports over the past decade
european battery companies would need billions in eu support to rival asian firms that have received similar state subsidies and brussels may be better off promoting ev batteries instead investors say
i don t believe anyone in europe can be competitive with the asians said gerard reid founder of alexa capital which advises firms in the energy technology and power infrastructure sectors
for a graphic showing european ev battery supply and demand electric and hybrid vehicles are expected to account for percent of the global auto market by according to metal consultants cru up from percent of the million vehicles sold last year
global automakers plan to invest at least billion in electric cars and batteries the most expensive component in the vehicles to finance hundreds of new models over the next five years
for now carmakers in europe have been importing batteries from asia but as production ramps up that will become less viable
setting up production in europe would cut shipping costs by a quarter consultancy group estimates
but some carmakers are not waiting for a european industry instead signing contracts with asian firms coming to the region
german s bmw said it was not involved in the european alliance while europe s biggest automaker volkswagen said it plans to get batteries from lg chem s polish factory due to open this year
mercedes maker daimler has awarded a contract to catl
the european commission s plan calls for million euros in battery related research help for projects from a billion euro eu innovation fund and the development of an eu green battery trademark
supporters of the initiative argue europe can carve out a niche by selling green batteries produced with renewable energy and ethically sourced raw materials
northvolt which has held talks with european automakers aims to launch its billion gigafactory in late and produce gigawatt hours of battery capacity each year by
but investors have been cautious about pouring money into new european battery ventures
northvolt s first financing round intended to raise million euros to million euros to help set up a test factory took slightly longer than expected a spokesman said
in the end the bulk of the financing was provided by the swedish energy agency and the european investment bank which provided a loan of up to million euros
much of the profit from the battery value chain is generated by producers of raw materials such as cobalt and lithium and those who assemble cells into complex systems experts say
there s been a bit of imbalance in that value chain and that s one of the reasons you see a limited amount of players in europe said northvolt founder and chief executive peter carlsson
but we think that the model that we re applying is changing carlsson who used to work for electric car pioneer tesla says northvolt can make a profit through economies of scale by using cheap hydropower and controlling the processing of raw materials
but northvolt and terrae will probably need about billion each in government funding to build their gigafactories given the state support provided for similar projects in asia and the united states said asad farid an associate director at private bank berenberg who specialises in battery technology
four months after the european alliance launch the world s biggest automotive supplier germany s robert bosch abandoned plans to make battery cells saying it was too risky
solution
investors are wary because of their experience with solar panel manufacturers as well as rapid advances in technology that are slashing the price of battery packs which consultants arthur d little puts at per kilowatt hour now
in battery manufacturing it very much about scale
so the established producers in korea china and japan have clear advantages over new entrants said simon webber lead portfolio manager on the global international equities team at schroders
tim crockford who manages hermes investment management impact opportunities fund here said he was more interested in european firms researching cathode technology areas with major barriers to entry in terms of research and development
the attraction of the industry decreases as you move further down the value chain
things like battery manufacturers and the battery pack assemblers it s much more fragmented market with lower barriers to entry said crockford
while hermes has avoided companies ev cell batteries it has taken stakes in a lithium producer and a company that makes materials for battery cathodes he said
the batteries used now are also likely to be overtaken in a matter of years by technology that is expected to produce even cheaper batteries with higher energy density
the development cycle and the speed of technology progress in batteries is so huge at the moment there an opportunity for new and additional players to enter said timo moeller head of the mckinsey center for future mobility here in cologne
developers in europe believe that gives the region an opportunity to catch up
everybody is developing batteries so the gap with asia will be narrower and narrower as we go along said diego pavia ceo of innoenergy a sustainable energy company that has invested in northvolt
