update 2-emirates sees oil, dollar 'double whammy', but demand strong
sydney reuters the president of emirates airline said the rare combination of higher oil and a stronger dollar which usually move in opposite directions represented a double whammy in terms of their impact on costs but that passenger demand remained strong
we have very strong summer bookings at higher prices tim clark told reporters at an airlines summit in sydney adding emirates was monitoring those trends for any sign higher ticket prices were hurting demand
global airlines body iata on monday downgraded its profit forecast for the industry citing higher oil and labour costs but also said yields a proxy for air fares were expected to rise percent this year
iata has cautioned that rising fares as airlines seek to make up for higher costs could temper growth in demand
clark however said he had not seen any sign of this yet and that the airline had managed to raise prices for the summer without hurting bookings
the velocity of growth in bookings exceeds what we had seen last year he added
some analysts warn that passengers who upped their spending when fares were down amid lower oil prices would quickly evaporate when prices moved higher
if airlines have to start putting prices up you can actually see a very quick fall in that growth rate said analyst peter harbison chairman of for aviation
to combat higher oil prices airlines are locking in fuel hedges lowering capacity raising fares and retiring older jets industry executives at the annual meeting of the international air transport association said
clark also said emirates business had returned to growth after being hit by curbs on carrying large electronic devices in passenger jet cabins last year
however emirates said it had no current plans to expand the fifth freedom flights to the united states services which have irked some airlines critical of the airline s growth
fifth freedom flights are ones where an airline from one country operates between two different countries
for example emirates operates two such flights between milan and new york and between athens and newark
the united states last month agreed a deal with the united arab emirates and in january with qatar to resolve claims from the three largest carriers that gulf airlines had received unfair government subsidies
uae as qatar did in january told the united states that the two uae airlines have no current plans to add additional fifth freedom flights
some in the united states have suggested the deal stops the gulf carriers from adding fifth freedom flights but clark said the agreement does not rule out such flights
fifth freedom routes are not central to emirates business he added
clark downplayed talk of a global pilot shortage saying availability was back to normal
as for aircraft availability boeing is on schedule to deliver the first upgraded in june he said
the world s largest passenger jet which features folding wingtips to allow it to park in existing airport stands has been hit by engine snags but boeing has reorganised testing to try to keep it on track
clark also said he expected to make a decision soon on engines for the carrier s latest order of airbus superjumbos
the planes are due for delivery from
the general electric and pratt whitney engine alliance venture powers most emirates but it lost out to competitor on the latest deliveries
clark said the trent engines on its has shown good performance on maintenance since being introduced to the emirates fleet months ago
however emirates has delayed some deliveries to allow to fix a fan blade problem
emirates which recently announced the launch of premium economy services in a challenge to rivals plans to install up to of the seats on the using a bespoke seat design to be out to seat makers clark said
