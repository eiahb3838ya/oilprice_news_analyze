rpt-update 2-new proposals may help resolve israel/lebanon oil and gas dispute
repeats to additional subscribers israel lebanon in over maritime border room for cautious optimism to end dispute minister says both countries planning new offshore exploration israel to modify new licences to attract bidders by ari rabinovitch jerusalem june reuters new ideas proposed in mediation of an maritime dispute over oil and gas exploration in the eastern mediterranean raise the prospect of a partial deal this year israel s energy minister said
israel kicked off a gas bonanza in the eastern mediterranean almost a decade ago with the discovery of two huge gas fields
others were found in egypt and cyprus and companies are now exploring lebanese waters as well
one of the lebanese blocks being explored block borders israel s maritime zone and contains waters claimed by both countries
the disputed border also touches two other lebanese blocks
this has led to years of brinkmanship with officials on both sides promising to protect their resources and warning about encroachment
there are some new ideas on the table
more than that i can not discuss energy minister yuval steinitz said in a reuters interview
he oversees energy exploration in israel and is the pointman in indirect negotiations with lebanon
david satterfield the acting assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs has shuttled between the countries in recent months as a mediator
steinitz said that president donald trump s middle east peace negotiator jason greenblatt has also been involved
there is room for cautious optimism
but not beyond cautious steinitz said
i hope that in the coming months or by the end of the year we will manage to reach a solution or at least a partial solution to the but he added nothing has been settled even a partial agreement would be a major diplomatic achievement as well as timely since both lebanon and israel are planning new rounds of tenders for offshore exploration
a spokeswoman for lebanon s energy and water minister cesar abi khalil declined to comment on the negotiations between lebanon and israel or the specific points raised by steinitz
israel recently warned energy companies in lebanon not to drill close to its border and the consortium set to explore block made up of france s total italy s eni and russia s novatek has said it would stay away from the disputed area
steinitz also said he expected israel to begin a new round of tenders for offshore blocks sometime between september and november
the new offshore exploration licences will be modified to make them more attractive to energy groups after a previous auction got a tepid response steinitz said
israel launched a bidding round in november after a number of the fields were found in israeli waters
it accepted the only two bids it received from greece s energean and a consortium of indian firms including ongc videsh bharat petroresources indian oil corp and oil india
steinitz said there were lessons to be learned
we will change the method in a way that it will be more accessible and attractive he said without elaborating
additionally i think there were two developments that will make the exploration more he said companies were put off by concerns that they might not find a buyer for gas they discovered since israel has a gas surplus and export options at the time were limited
but he said that had changed referring to the opening of two markets over the past year
progress has been made in plans for an subsea gas pipeline and a billion export deal to egypt was signed
