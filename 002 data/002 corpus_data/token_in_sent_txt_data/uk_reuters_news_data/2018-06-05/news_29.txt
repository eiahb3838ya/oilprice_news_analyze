malaysia to probe najib govt's $2-bln payments to chinese pipeline firm
kuala lumpur june reuters malaysia s finance minister on tuesday announced plans to report to the agency upfront payments of billions of ringgit the previous administration made to a chinese firm for two pipeline projects that have barely begun
since taking office two weeks ago lim guan eng has been driving a campaign to expose financial scandals in the administration of former prime minister najib razak unseated in a stunning election defeat last month
lim said najib s government had paid billion ringgit billion or percent of the total value of two pipeline projects awarded to china petroleum pipeline bureau ccpb although they are less than percent complete
we have discovered that the payment schedules for the above contracts are based almost entirely on timeline milestones and not on progressive work completion milestones lim said in a statement
in november ccpb won the contracts to build a petroleum pipeline along the west coast of peninsular malaysia and the gas pipeline in eastern sabah state
lim said the contracts were negotiated directly by najib s office and the former prime minister had ignored red flags raised by the s office on both deals
in march the finance ministry raised percent of the project funding from china exim bank through a subsidiary suria strategic energy resources sser
the rest was raised by issuing sukuk or bonds
both the china exim bank borrowings and the sukuk are secured with federal government guarantees lim added
telephone calls from reuters to ccpb s office numbers listed on its website were not answered
an aide to najib could not respond immediately to a request for comment over text
lim said he had ordered a report filed with the agency and the ministry would consider seeking china s help to decide if moneylaundering figured in either deal
najib and his family had been dogged during the last three years of his rule by a scandal over billions of dollars allegedly siphoned from state fund development berhad and a key reason for his may election defeat
is also the subject of probes in at least six countries including the united states switzerland and singapore
