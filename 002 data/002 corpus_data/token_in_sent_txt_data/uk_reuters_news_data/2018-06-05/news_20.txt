cross-border power flows may be disrupted as sweden replaces old grid
oslo reuters sweden s plans to renew its power grid in the densely populated southwest region may disrupt supplies that run through the area to neighboring states operator svenska kraftnat svk said
some kms miles of electricity lines will be gradually replaced in the next decade in an area through which swedish power and supplies from norway with its abundant and cheap hyrdropower flow to denmark germany and other countries
svk did not give details of the extent of any disruption to its interconnections as the upgrade was still in the planning phase
but it said the risk of unscheduled interruptions or blackouts would rise if the work was not carried out
in the oldest parts of the transmission grid s kv power lines will approach an age of years and parts of the kv grid are even older so old that it is no longer enough to maintain them svk said in a statement to reuters
replacing the grid along sweden s west coast would cost roughly billion swedish crowns million and would require decommissioning of some local lines that are used as international interconnectors it said
the existing power line needs to be out of commission for periods while the new one is being built it said
upgrading the grid is only part of the renovation taking place between and svk said adding that further components in the national network would also be renewed
about substations control facilities and reactors and transformers are due for renewal svenska kraftnat said adding that nearly devices would be replaced
if the power lines are not replaced before they get too old the risk of interruptions increases and so does the risk of blackouts svk said in a statement
power line replacements will not cause risk to the electricity supply of the data centers of the region it added
