wrapup 2-venezuela opposition plans to get oil money from u.s. fund
caracas reuters venezuela s opposition on wednesday said it would use a fund to receive some of the country s oil income in a key step to bankroll its efforts to dislodge president nicolas maduro
the fund would receive income accrued by oil firm pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum corp since last month when president donald trump recognised juan guaido as venezuela s legitimate head of state opposition legislator carlos paparoni told reuters
guadio head of venezuela s national assembly last month declared himself to be the south american country s interim ruler
white house national security adviser john bolton said on wednesday the united states would consider lifting sanctions on senior venezuelan military officers if they recognise guaido as interim leader
if not the international financial circle will be closed off completely bolton wrote on twitter
aside from one senior general who recognised guaido in a video and urged others in the military to do the same most of venezuela s top military officers have not defected from maduro
citgo the refiner and venezuela s top foreign asset is in the middle of a tug of war as the united states has made aggressive moves to remove it from maduro s control and imposed sanctions on venezuela s oil industry
this is already quite advanced i hope that next week it can be announced by our representative in the united states paparoni said though he did not give details about the nature of the fund or the financial institution involved
pressure is building on maduro a socialist to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation
maduro was last year in a vote critics have called a sham
yon goicoechea a member of guaido s policy team told reuters that guaido was in contact with pdvsa s international partners and they were willing to keep operating in venezuela
he did not identify the partners
guaido s team is planning for a government with an emergency arrangement to supply fuel domestically given widespread shortages across venezuela goicoechea said
most latin american and european countries also recognise guaido although italy so far has not
guaido has reached out to italy s ruling coalition seeking its support
maduro who retains control over the state denounces guaido as a puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him
he is supported by china and russia while slovakia on wednesday joined italy in defying the coordinated action of european union nations and the united states
the opposition has also sought to prevent the government from selling gold believing that it is using the proceeds to try to stay solvent as the sanctions cut off other revenue streams
but maduro s government last year sold tonnes of gold to turkey and the united arab emirates without the required approval of the national assembly paparoni told a news conference
abu dhabi investment firm noor capital bought the largest amount tonnes of gold and a turkish firm bought tonnes paparoni said
we will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold paparoni said
venezuela had gold reserves of tonnes between the central bank s vaults and the bank of england at the end of november according to central bank data
venezuela s information ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment
noor capital said it does not engage in any illegal or prohibited in recent days at least five tankers carrying gasoline gasoil for power generation and naphtha have been ordered to unload at venezuela s ports as fuel inventories dwindle
pdvsa issued court orders for most of the tankers to discharge according to shipping and pdvsa sources
guaido asked italy s ruling coalition leaders in a letter to meet with his representatives as he seeks their explicit backing
italy s league has expressed strong support for guaido but coalition partner the movement has not making italy the only major european union nation not to recognise him as venezuela s interim head of state
league leader and deputy prime minister matteo salvini s office on wednesday said he would meet guaido s envoys on
as the world s countries line up to support either maduro or guaido the united nations warned against using aid as a pawn
the united states has sent food and medicine to venezuela s border even though it is unclear how it will get past the objections of maduro
humanitarian action needs to be independent of political military or other objectives spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters in new york
the international committee of the red cross has doubled its budget in venezuela in recent weeks and is also helping venezuelan migrants in neighbouring colombia and brazil icrc president peter maurer said in geneva
