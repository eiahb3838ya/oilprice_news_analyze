update 3-trump nominates critic of global institutions to lead world bank
washington reuters president donald trump said on wednesday that the world bank group should be led by treasury official david malpass a trump loyalist and critic of multilateral institutions who has vowed to pursue reforms at the development lender
trump s nomination of malpass the treasury department s top diplomat is subject to a vote by the world bank s executive board and could draw challengers from some of its other shareholding countries
the united states is the largest shareholder with percent of its voting power and has traditionally chosen the bank s president but jim yong kim who stepped down from the job on faced challengers from colombia and nigeria in
the nomination of malpass signals that the trump administration wants a firmer grip on the world bank
he was an economic adviser to trump s election campaign
malpass treasury undersecretary for international affairs a job in which he oversees the role in the world bank and the international monetary fund has criticized them for growing ever larger more intrusive and he also has pushed the bank to cut back lending to china which he argues is too wealthy for such aid when it is saddling poorer countries with debt in its belt and road infrastructure drive
last year as part of a billion world bank capital increase malpass helped negotiate reforms aimed at refocusing resources towards the poorest countries and winding down lending to china
he has fought to ensure financing is focused on the places and projects that truly need assistance including people living in extreme poverty trump said in announcing his choice at the white house with malpass by his side
malpass said at the white house he would work to implement these reforms and also focus on women s economic empowerment
i m very optimistic that we can achieve breakthroughs to create growth abroad that will help us combat extreme poverty and create economic opportunities in the developing world malpass said
malpass will continue to participate in trade negotiations as he campaigns for the world bank presidency
he will join a delegation heading to beijing for more talks next week a senior trump administration official said
but as trump s america first trade agenda and tariff war with china puts strains on many developing economies some development experts say that malpass candidacy will be a difficult sell
david malpass will have a lot of work to do to convince other shareholders that he is prepared to move beyond his past statements and track record when it comes to the world bank s agenda said scott morris a former treasury development finance official who is now a senior fellow at the center for global development in washington
morris said that includes the global lender s role in climate finance and the need for constructive engagement with by naming malpass a day before the world bank board begins a nomination process trump could deter the emergence of other candidates
malpass would honor the bank s standards and obligations including its initiatives to combat climate change the senior trump administration official said
if approved malpass would replace kim a physician and former university president who resigned more than three years before his term ended to join private equity fund global infrastructure partners
kim had differed with the trump administration over climate change effectively ending the bank s financing of power projects
malpass served in treasury and state department roles during the ronald reagan and george
bush administrations and at investment bank bear stearns where he was chief economist before its collapse
