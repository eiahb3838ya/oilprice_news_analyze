explainer-anything goes as uniper, fortum push relationship reset button
frankfurt reuters german utility uniper said on wednesday there were no taboos in the fresh talks it will hold with its largest owner fortum breaking a deadlock between the two and potentially paving the way for a full take over
fortum majority owned by finland has a percent stake in uniper
activist investors elliott and knight vinke have disclosed stakes of percent and percent respectively
talks between uniper and fortum which will not include uniper s ceo and cfo who will step down in august could result in a cooperation agreement or follow up bid for the remainder of uniper investors analysts and sources say
below are some of the developments that could take place in the course of the year since becoming uniper s largest shareholder last year following a deal with fortum has tried to strike a cooperation agreement with uniper whose management had opposed the transaction from the
while fortum s chief executive pekka lundmark as recently as last week described the results of these efforts as disappointing the resignations of uniper s ceo and cfo which were announced late on tuesday could move things along
the discussions which will take place in a working group where uniper will be represented by its remaining two management board members aim at exploring partnership opportunities on a strategic and operational level
talks could lead to closer cooperation between the two energy firms in some markets including russia with jefferies estimating potential cost saving synergies for uniper of million euros million or euros per share
expectations are that fortum will one way or another eventually gain full control of uniper given the finnish group approached its german peer regarding a takeover in the summer of albeit without success
instead fortum spent billion euros on buying the percent stake in uniper that held onto after spinning the company off three years ago picking up only a few additional shares in the full bid it had to make as part of the deal
at uniper s current market value the remaining stake would cost fortum billion euros plus any premium the group would certainly have to pay
analysts at jp morgan are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a bid pointing to uncertainties raised by a recent government proposal to close power stations in germany and its impact on local utilities
if anything this unlocks an unproductive situation and we believe that fortum is likely to wait for more clarity on the german coal and lignite compensation jp morgan analysts wrote
uniper supervisory board chairman bernhard reutersberg despite saying nothing was in discussions said that no substantial results were expected before the group s shareholder meeting in may
the relationship between both companies has been shaped by mistrust and allegations in the past with uniper calling fortum a wolf in sheep s clothing and fortum saying uniper actively tried to prevent a takeover from happening
one hurdle to fully integrating the two companies is a water license owned by uniper s russian unit unipro
if unipro keeps the license a russian ban on foreign entities owning a majority in local strategic assets would prevent fortum from owning more than half of uniper
elliott which has also recently taken stakes in thyssenkrupp and bayer will certainly have an external influence on the talks
the activist investor has significantly raised its stake in uniper in recent months and a source familiar with the matter told reuters that a further increase was possible
elliott has so far remained in its role as a shareholder at least publicly apart from backing a motion last year to investigate whether uniper tried to block the sale of s stake to fortum
given the size of elliott s stake it will be difficult for fortum to gain full control over uniper via a domination agreement unless it is supported by the fund given fortum needs a majority at uniper s annual general meeting to make that happen
elliott declined to comment and knight vinke was not immediately available for comment
