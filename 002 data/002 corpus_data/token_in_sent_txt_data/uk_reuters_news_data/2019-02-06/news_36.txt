update 2-renewables niche reaps profits for finnish refiner neste
helsinki reuters biofuel producer and oil refiner neste reported a bigger than expected profit on wednesday after seeing robust demand for its renewables fuels which it expects will continue to grow
the finnish company which produces diesel and other fuels from renewable materials at plants in singapore and rotterdam said sales at its renewables business in the first quarter would likely surpass those of the fourth quarter of adding that utilization rates would be high
chief executive peter vanacker said the company s main growth drivers going forward would be rising jet fuel sales and marine fuel sales as shipping companies prepare for new sulfur emissions rules coming into force in
in we have already produced the first tonnes of renewable jet fuel and we see a big market coming up in the aviation industry vanacker told reuters in a phone interview
neste s cooperation with furniture giant ikea on plastics announced last june would be another growth area he said
the company s shares rose as much as percent after its results and were up percent at euros by gmt
neste which also has two conventional oil refineries in finland said margins for its oil products business would be low in the first quarter due to a weak gasoline market but would strengthen towards the end of that period
renewables account for percent of group profits and neste said its total core operating profit rose percent to million euros million beating analysts average expectation of million in a reuters poll
operating profit at its renewables operations rose to million euros beating analysts forecasts in the poll which ranged from million to million
neste announced in december plans to build a new billion euro refinery in singapore expecting to expand its total renewables production capacity to million tonnes annually by from million tonnes currently
as you can see from the singapore investment quite a lot of our efforts are going into expansion in the renewables space where we still see quite a lot of opportunities for the future vanacker said
neste said its cooperation with ikea aimed to utilize renewable residue and waste raw materials as well as sustainably produced vegetable oils in the production of plastic products
the company sees room for growth in its marine fuel business ahead of the new sulfur emissions limits which will fall to percent in bunker fuel from percent currently
we are very well positioned because here in the baltic sea the regulation is already even lower than percent it s percent vanacker said referring to the new emissions limit for ships
this will have a positive influence on our additional margin he said adding some industry consultants has estimated the effect at between and per barrel
neste proposed a dividend of euros per share slightly above the average forecast
