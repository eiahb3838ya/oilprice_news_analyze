feature-'water from air' aims to turn back thailand's tide of plastic
phuket thailand feb thomson reuters foundation staying at a hotel on the thai island of koh samui in meghan kerrigan noticed the four bottles of water she was given every day were clogging her bin with plastic
outside her door chaweng beach was smothered in rubbish
it was then that she and kohler brothers ryan and matthew had a moment
instead of trying to solve the problem by cleaning the beaches every day let s go to what the source of the problem is and take the plastic bottle away said kerrigan now
in the trio founded startup company generation water based on the thai resort island of phuket
they partnered with marriott the world s largest hotel brand in january to come up with a sustainable alternative to plastic bottles that would be commercially competitive and meet the needs of resorts and authorities
two years on the south entrepreneurs explained the workings of a pilot water plant at the jw marriott phuket resort spa on mai khao beach next to slogans saying save water drink air and made from the air
here in the sweltering heat two water generators suck in vapour from the air which then condenses into water when it hits cold coils
the water drips into tanks making litres a day
it is filtered minerals are added and it is put into reusable glass bottles
these are placed into guestrooms at the jw marriott phuket and neighbouring renaissance phuket resort spa
the bottled water is also being trialled at two marriott vacation clubs nearby
the move is part of a wider effort on the holiday island to cut down on plastic bottles rife in the hospitality industry and a major problem in asia and its travel hotspots
in many parts of asia tap water is unsafe to drink so hotel guests get complimentary water mostly in plastic bottles
as much as percent of the plastic found in the ocean comes from five asian nations including thailand according to group ocean conservancy
in the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific organised a forum to encourage sustainable water management on resort islands
on phuket which is half the size of hong kong more hotels are being built and water is already in short supply
trucks navigate crowded roads as resorts without their own catchment area bring in water from reservoirs
phuket was the world s top city destination in with million international arrivals according to global research company euromonitor international
to cope with the environmental impacts of this influx nearly hotels from the phuket hotels association have pledged to cut plastic bottles and straws by the end of
since marriott started producing its own water four months ago it has stopped more than plastic bottles from entering landfill or oceans the chain says
it plans to expand the scheme to all marriott resorts in southern thailand handing out million glass bottles
carsten siebert marriott international s director of operations for thailand vietnam cambodia and myanmar said the company understood it had a greater obligation to operate responsibly given our expanding global footprint
the chain has a goal to reduce water consumption per occupied room by percent between and
the water from air technology uses percent less energy than producing standard bottled water has a lower carbon footprint and is about a third cheaper generation water says
the good thing is that it starts to become financially affordable said matthias sutter general manager at jw marriott phuket
nor does the system rely on pulling water from the ground rivers or lakes
we don t have to invest in land to secure our own water said kanokwan corporate social responsibility manager for the same marriott hotel
guests here have reacted positively since the bottled water was introduced in september happy that finally a big brand made a move she said
they also like the taste
michael lawson a lawyer from sydney sitting at the sala sawasdee lobby bar said his children were quite picky about water
but it s very refreshing and they are fighting over it in the room he said
downstairs in the siam deli teenage student jeremy frydman from melbourne said it was better than tap water at home
one challenge for generation water is explaining the science behind the technology
many guests ask about air pollution for example
but the water collected is clean to start with and the technology still works if the air is polluted as only water condenses not the air or its contaminants said ryan kohler
and with human activities emitting more greenhouse gases the atmosphere is warming up causing more water to evaporate which further heats the air in a vicious circle he added
the system helps reduce this vapour said kerrigan adding that it has no impact on rainfall levels
thailand s food and drug administration approved generation water last august and the company is now expanding
it is building a plant in phuket which will use solar energy to make water producing more than litres of water per day by the end of the year
nine marriott resorts on phuket are in the process of signing up along with other hotels
generation water is now eyeing the rest of thailand and is talking to hotels in singapore indonesia vietnam and the maldives kohler said
it also sells smaller water production units that can be used in homes offices classrooms and yachts
the company s goal is to stop billion ml plastic bottles from entering landfill and the oceans every year by the end of equal to supplying hotels of rooms
as for marriott staff on phuket they have no excuse now said
their birthday gift from the company will be a reusable tumbler which they can fill up with water from the air
