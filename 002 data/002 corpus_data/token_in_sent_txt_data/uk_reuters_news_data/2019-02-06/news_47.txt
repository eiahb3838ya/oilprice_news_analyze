refile-tests at cuadrilla's uk fracking site show substantial gas flows
removes extraneous items at top of the article cuadrilla says it could only partially test shale well uk rules demand fracking work halted if tremors detected environmentalists oppose new gas development by nina chestney london feb reuters tests of the first shale well at cuadrilla s site in northwest england show a rich reservoir of high quality and recoverable gas the british firm said on wednesday adding that rules that have constrained its testing work should be eased
cuadrilla is using a technique called hydraulic fracturing that involves injecting water and chemicals at high pressure to break up rock and extract gas
the practice known as fracking can cause tremors and environmentalists oppose the development
the company repeatedly stopped operations last year at its preston new road site in lancashire because of minor seismic events
british regulations demand work be suspended if seismic activity of magnitude or more is detected
cuadrilla said it could only partially test the horizontal shale well because of the operating limits
nonetheless the natural gas still flowed back from the shale at a peak rate of over standard cubic feet scf per day and a stable rate of some chief executive officer francis egan
scaling up the results suggested a flow range of between million to million for a km miles section once all stages were hydraulically fractured cuadrilla said
we have also confirmed that the bowland shale formation fractures in a way that from experience is typical of an excellent shale gas reservoir egan said
fracking techniques were pioneered in the united states which has turned from an importer of gas to a net exporter
cuadrilla said more production data was needed to refine the preliminary results and this could only be done if seismicity limits are lifted to allow more effective fracturing
the firm has asked the regulator to review rules on seismic activity to allow more thorough testing of exploration wells
depending on the outcome cuadrilla plans to complete fracking its first well at preston new road start a second and carry out flow testing of both later this year
environmentalists have campaigned against the work saying extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with britain s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
but the government wants to cut reliance on imports of gas which heats about percent of british homes
the british geological survey estimates shale gas resources in north england could reach trillion cubic feet tcf percent of which could meet britain s demand for about years
cuadrilla is percent owned by australia s aj lucas and percent owned by a fund managed by riverstone
