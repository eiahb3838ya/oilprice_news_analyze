french senate gives go-ahead for lower state share in engie
paris feb reuters the french senate on wednesday voted in favour of allowing the state to lower its minority stake in gas and power group engie despite rejecting a proposal to privatise airport operator adp earlier in the week
the french state owns percent of engie s capital and percent of the shares voting rights and is required by law to keep at least percent of the voting rights
finance minister bruno le maire told the senate that if engie wanted to issue new capital to finance its expansion the state would have no choice but to subscribe to respect the law
that is why we ask for the possibility to lower the state s stake in engie below the legal limit le maire told senators
the government has given no indication of how much of its shares it may want to sell
the senate controlled by the conservative opposition voted against in favour of the government proposal
a could only have delayed the operation rather than definitively block it since the assemblee nationale lower house of parliament where president emmanuel macron s centrist lrem party has a comfortable majority has the final vote
the logic is the same for all government asset sales we want to give these companies the chance to grow and develop le maire said adding that engie would boost its investment in renewable energy notably biogas and offshore wind power
the planned sale of more engie shares is part of a government plan to raise around billion euros billion for innovation as part of its loi pacte legislation
