gazprom seeks bigger gas market share in europe after bumper exports
vienna reuters russia s gazprom is looking to gain an even larger gas market share in europe following exports expecting a decline in europe s gas output combined with rising demand a senior manager at the company said
last year it sold more than billion cubic metres of gas to europe including turkey while its gas market share in the region rose to more than a third
elena burmistrova in charge of the russian company s exports said gazprom would be able to offset a production decline in the european union mainly at the netherlands groningen once europe s largest natural gas field
north sea production is also gradually declining
so the space for russian gas is being freed up she said on the sidelines of the european gas conference in vienna
eu gas production will halve by the international energy agency has said
moscow has piped gas to europe from its fields in siberia and northern russia for more than years
it can ill afford losing the lucrative market for gazprom whose sales account for over percent of russia s trillion economy
burmistrova said gazprom was striving to raise its market share in europe where the company generates two thirds of its gas sales
according to preliminary estimates our share in europe stood at percent in while in it could have reached around percent burmistrova said in remarks cleared for publication on wednesday
russian energy sales have become increasingly politicised since following the annexation of the crimean peninsula from ukraine accusations of meddling in the presidential election in and a nerve gas attack in britain
gazprom last year escaped the spectre of big fines in a case that had dragged on for seven years after it clinched a deal with eu antitrust regulators to reform its pricing structure and allow rivals a foothold in eastern europe
burmistrova said gazprom did not want to look too aggressive in the eyes of europe with its plans to boost sales
we don t set a target of gaining or percent of the eu market she said
some european countries mainly in eastern europe have voiced concern about russia s growing energy clout
the gazprom manager said the company had proven to be a reliable gas supplier and that its exports in europe would not suffer because of politics
however gazprom s exports have been jeopardised by a shale gas production boom in the united states and president donald trump s plans to sell vast amounts of liquefied natural gas lng to europe
lng shipments to europe totalled million tonnes or cargoes in october to january compared to million tonnes or nine cargoes a year earlier
the united states is now second only to qatar the world s largest lng producer as an lng supplier to europe refinitiv eikon data showed
burmistrova played down the danger to russian gas dominance in europe from the united states
we will always be competitive against american lng she said
