the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters the deadline for the united states and china to reach a trade deal before tariffs increase on billion worth of chinese imports scheduled for march is the most important date in the calendar for oil traders
the deadline will probably have more impact than the next joint ministerial monitoring committee march opec s extraordinary meeting april or even the white house review of iran sanctions waivers may
the outcome of trade talks will have a decisive influence on the oil consumption outlook for the rest of the year since the threat of tariffs and associated uncertainty are proving the largest drag on global economic growth
because the trade deadline comes first the outturn will shape the subsequent strategic choices made by opec and its allies over oil production and the white house on how far to toughen iran sanctions
uncertainty about the outlook for global trade has already pushed the world economy close to the brink of recession judging by a range of business surveys and statistics on trade volumes
china s manufacturers reported a fall in business activity in december and january and the official purchasing managers index has fallen to its lowest level for three years
global manufacturers have reported declining export orders for five months now according to the new export orders component of the jpmorgan global pmi with new business falling at the fastest rate since
freight flows through hong kong international airport the world s busiest air cargo hub are also falling at the fastest rate since according to government statistics
the only significant exception to the global slowdown has been the united states itself where manufacturers report a continued widespread upturn albeit more slowly than the frenzied rates in late and early
in the rest of the world the slowdown has taken a toll on current and prospective oil consumption growth pushing the global market towards surplus and causing prices to fall sharply in the fourth quarter
the biggest impact of the slowdown is being felt in the consumption of middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel used in trucking shipping railroads and airlines as well as by manufacturers miners and farmers
given distillate s predominant use in freight transport and industry distillate consumption and prices have been closely correlated with the business cycle at and global levels in the last years
if the economy slides into an extended slowdown or worse an outright recession distillate prices will come under renewed pressure and take crude prices down with them
the global economy has been battered by a series of negative shocks in the last six to months including the stalled brexit negotiations rising interest rates an appreciating dollar and sharp falls in world equity markets
but the largest source of uncertainty stems from the deteriorating trading relationship between the united states and china which is spilling over to both countries trading networks
the resolution of tensions will therefore have more impact on the global economic outlook and oil consumption than any other single factor in
of all possible outcomes four are the most likely comprehensive agreement settling all or nearly all outstanding issues between the two countries limited agreement settling some issues but leaving more difficult items to be dealt with later risking recurrent tensions no deal but with an agreement to postpone the tariff deadline while the two sides continue negotiating risking recurrent tensions no deal with an immediate imposition of tariffs on china s exports
a comprehensive agreement on all issues would be the most positive result and could lead to a major boost in business confidence but because some issues are so difficult it is also probably the least likely of those four possible outcomes
at the other end of the spectrum no deal and immediate imposition of tariffs would be the most negative outcome and the resulting shock to confidence and markets would make a recession very likely
the risks of no deal give policymakers in china and the united states a powerful incentive to compromise provided they can save face and present any accord in a favourable light to domestic audiences
the intermediate outcomes of a limited accord or continued negotiations would avoid the worst recession risks but do little to rekindle business confidence so have little impact on the trajectory of the economy
comprehensive agreement is obviously more positive for oil consumption while no deal would pose the greatest risk for oil demand
comprehensive agreement would allow the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies to contemplate relaxing their output curbs but might make the white house hesitate about toughening sanctions on iran
by contrast no deal would probably force opec and its allies to consider even deeper production cuts but also give the white house more scope to reduce or eliminate sanctions waivers for iran s crude customers
opec and its allies will need a clear idea of the white house s approach to iran before they make any decision about adjusting output to avoid repeating the miscommunication that dogged the last sanctions deadline in
the white house will therefore come under pressure to make its position on iran sanctions clear before the meeting in to avoid further oil price volatility
the imposition of sanctions on venezuela s oil company pdvsa to deny financial support to the maduro government and force a transfer of power to the opposition has further complicated the outlook
the scope of the sanctions remains unclear intentionally but they appear to include primary sanctions on buyers of venezuelan oil and secondary sanctions on firms doing business with pdvsa
if the sanctions are sustained for any length of time they will probably remove several hundred thousand barrels per day of crude from the global market which would tighten the balance significantly
but the lack of much price response so far suggests most traders expect the showdown between the united states and the maduro government to be resolved relatively quickly
the abrupt and aggressive escalation of the crisis has engaged the full political and diplomatic credibility of the white house and the united states in forcing a swift transition of power
the united states has pushed the crisis so far it would be very difficult to back down now and allow the maduro government to remain in place
most traders seem to be betting the standoff will end quickly with the replacement of the maduro administration and a resumption of venezuela s exports or alternatively exports will be allowed to resume to third countries
if the standoff lasts longer and exports remain sanctioned crude prices will eventually have to rise unless opec makes up the difference
while venezuela remains an immediate concern the outlook for oil prices in the rest of the year will be dominated by what happens in trade talks between the united states and china in the next three weeks
