uk wylfa nuclear project could still be deployed in 2030s- energy secretary
london reuters britain s energy secretary said on wednesday it is still possible to deploy the wylfa nuclear power project in the if a financing model can be agreed
last month japan s hitachi ltd put its plans for a nuclear plant at wylfa in anglesey wales on hold after it failed to find private investors
it is still possible to deploy wylfa in the if a financing model can be agreed greg clark told a parliamentary committee
the government is looking at the potential for a different funding model such as a regulated one which it will update on during the summer
one of the reasons nuclear plants have proved difficult to finance is because there is an abundance of alternatives which are cheaper
nuclear has a much longer lead time than any of those alternatives
there is no shortage of ability to replace that power clark added
