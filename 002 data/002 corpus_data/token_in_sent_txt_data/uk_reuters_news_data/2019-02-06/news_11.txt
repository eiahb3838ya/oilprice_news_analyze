trump administration proposes exempting some light bulbs from green standards
washington reuters the department of energy on wednesday proposed exempting some light bulbs from federal efficiency standards that take effect next year a move environmentalists said would boost pollution and power bills for consumers
the department said in a notice that revisions in two rules published by the obama administration in january days before president donald trump was inaugurated misconstrued existing law and that it was proposing to scrap the changes
the proposal was part of a push by the administration to ease regulations
an executive order trump signed the month he became president called for agencies to ditch two old regulations for each one they propose
the administration has also rolled back regulations on pollution and emissions as it seeks to boost oil gas and coal output
the proposal would remove bulbs bulbs used in chandeliers reflector bulbs used in recessed lighting and others from having to comply with the new efficiency standards
advanced technologies including diode or led light bulbs use far less electricity than incandescent light bulbs which produce far more wasted heat
the changes would result in billion in extra power bill costs for consumers said the natural resources defense council an environmental group
this is another senseless and illegal trump administration rollback that will needlessly hike our energy bills and spew tons more pollution into the air harming the health of our children and the environment said noah horowitz director of nrdc s center for energy efficiency standards
the department of energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on criticism of its proposal
the department will hold a public meeting on the proposal in washington on
the alliance to save energy a nonprofit alliance of business government environmental and consumer interests said the proposal would give a lifeline to makers of inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs
the rules stemmed from bipartisan energy legislation passed in and signed by trump s fellow republican george bush that called for phasing in lighting efficiency standards the alliance said
