insight-bet everything on electric: inside vw's radical strategy shift
wolfsburg germany reuters if volkswagen realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history
the german giant has staked its future to the tune of billion euros billion on being able to profitably electric vehicles a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving
so far mainstream automakers electric plans have had one main goal to protect profits gleaned from conventional cars by adding enough vehicles to their fleet to meet rules
customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive can be inconvenient to charge and lack range
the biggest strategy shift in volkswagen s years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the rothehof guesthouse in wolfsburg on october senior executives told reuters
at the meeting hosted by then vw brand chief herbert diess nine top managers gathered on a cloudy saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company s emissions cheating a scandal that cost it more than billion euros in fines and tainted its name
it was an intense discussion so was the realization that this could be an opportunity if we jump far enough said juergen stackmann vw brand s board member for sales
it was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars he told reuters
we asked ourselves what is our vision for the future of the brand
everything that you see today is connected to just three days after the rothehof meeting of the vw brand s management board volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform codenamed meb paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car
for months after the volkswagen scandal blew up in rival carmakers treated as a vw issue according to industry experts
but regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines forcing a rethink
now the villain of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years analysts say putting it in pole position to flood the market should the demand materialize
decisions to convert the emden factory in lower saxony to build electric cars would never have happened without this saturday meeting said stackmann one of five senior vw executives who spoke to reuters
however the full scale of vw s ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries dwarfing the investment of rivals
it plans to raise annual production of electric cars to million by from in
it s a risky bet
with regulators and lawmakers rather than customers dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road analysts at deloitte say the industry could produce million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand
it s also an bet in the long run
vw whose id electric car will hit showrooms in has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines
the final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by
arndt ellinghorst analyst at evercore isi said betting on electric vehicles evs could be risky because customers did not want to own cars dependent on facilities
what if people are still not ready to own evs
will adoption be the same in the europe and china he said
but he added that eu and chinese emissions regulations made electric vehicle adoption inevitable and that being an early industry mover in that direction offered a positive
another of dieselgate that quickened vw s electric drive according to the senior executives was a purge of the company s old guard who became the focus of public and political anger
this empowered diess a newcomer who had joined as vw brand boss shortly before regulators exposed the carmaker s emission test cheating
diess who joined from bmw where he helped pioneer a electric vehicle has since been appointed ceo of volkswagen group a empire that includes audi porsche bentley seat skoda lamborghini and ducati
carmakers have failed to electric cars profitably largely because of the prohibitive cost of battery packs which make up between percent and percent of the cost of an electric vehicle
a battery costs around compared with a gasoline engine that costs around
add to that another for the electric motor and inverter and the gap is even wider
even electric tesla s cheapest car the model is on sale in germany at euros priced just below a base model porsche macan a compact suv
in the united states model prices start at
vw believes its scale will give it an edge to build an electric vehicle costing no more than its current golf model about euros using its procurement clout as the world s largest car and truck maker to drive down the cost
we are volkswagen a brand for the people
for electric cars we need economies of scale
and vw more than any other carmaker can take advantage of this a senior volkswagen executive told reuters declining to be named
the carmaker s budget outstrips that of its closest competitor germany s daimler which has committed billion
general motors the automaker has said it plans to spend a combined billion on electric and vehicles
said in late they would spend billion euros by on developing electric and autonomous cars
on a view we expect volkswagen to be the number one electric vehicles producer globally ubs analyst patrick hummel said
tesla is likely to remain a niche vw s test cheating using engine management software defeat devices resulted in the introduction of tougher pollution tests which revealed in and that emissions readings across the industry were up to percent higher under driving conditions compared with lab conditions
this has raised the bar on the auto sector s efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide blamed for causing global warming
eu lawmakers in december agreed a cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars of percent by compared with levels
this was after the european union forced a percent cut in emissions between and
this goal is no longer reachable using combustion engines alone volkmar denner chief executive of bosch the world s biggest auto supplier said about the proposals
every gram of excessive carbon dioxide pollution will be penalized with a euros fine from this year onwards
strategy firm pa consulting forecasts vw will face a penalty for overstepping average limits in europe by while ford and face fines of million euros and million euros respectively
daimler bmw psa mazda and hyundai will miss their average emissions targets pa consulting forecasts
toyota volvo honda and jaguar land rover are on track to meet their goals
pa consulting s forecasts were extrapolated using registration data for each powertrain type and consumer buying trends but do not include more recent sales trends
ford vw and bmw said they would meet their targets because of a push to sell more hybrid and electric cars in
daimler said it aimed to meet the targets psa said it would respect the targets while declined to comment
mazda had no immediate comment while hyundai did not respond to a request for comment
carmakers have struggled to lower their average fleet emissions because of a shift in customer taste toward heavier bigger suvs sports utility vehicles which make it harder to maintain the same levels of acceleration and comfort without increasing fuel consumption and pollution
suvs are now the most popular vehicle category in europe commanding a market share of percent according to jato dynamics
even porsche which makes lightweight sportscars relies on sports utility vehicles for percent of sales
as the scale of excessive emissions prompted brussels to push through tougher laws late last year vw executives concluded that purely electric cars were the most efficient way to meet carbon dioxide goals across its fleet
this was the point of no return according to executives when the company made the final electric investment decisions and committed to staying the course it had plotted after dieselgate
after evaluating alternatives we opted for electromobility chief operating officer ralf brandstaetter told reuters about vw s deliberations in november
