update 3-suncor expects alberta oil cuts to end early as rail shipments slow
adds alberta government comment updates stock price by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba feb reuters suncor energy inc one of canada s biggest oil producers expects the province of alberta to end mandatory production curtailments ahead of schedule as they have caused a price boost that makes rail shipments uneconomic chief executive officer steve williams said on wednesday
such unintended consequences are happening faster than the alberta government likely expected and it should now plan for a soft exit from curtailments that is fair to producers williams said on a quarterly conference call
the rail economics are seriously damaged and a lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped he said
that s going to have the opposite impact than what the government alberta curtailed barrels per day bpd in january to drain a glut of crude in storage that was caused by congested pipelines
the output cuts boosted canadian oil prices from record lows last year but suncor and other producers that have ample pipeline space and refineries say the sharp correction harmed their integrated businesses
the curtailments were applied fairly and saved jobs in the sector said mike mckinnon spokesman for alberta s energy minister
he said the government will monitor storage levels and adjust production levels as needed
williams said that the case for forced curtailments is likely to abate with seasonal maintenance shutdowns by oil producers during the second quarter and with enbridge inc s line expansion likely to start filling for later this year
you re going to see the pressure start to come off he said
suncor s shares turned positive after williams remarks and were up percent at c on wednesday afternoon in toronto
alberta eased the curtailments modestly for february and march
its plan is to reduce the curtailments further to an average of bpd through the end of once storage levels are sufficiently reduced
suncor s comments echo those of rival imperial oil ltd which said last week that it is ending nearly all crude by rail shipments because of the price impact of the curtailments
late on tuesday suncor reported a quarterly loss due largely to a charge related to how it accounts for inventory
