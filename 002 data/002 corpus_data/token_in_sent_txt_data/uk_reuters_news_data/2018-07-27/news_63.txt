chartbook by john kemp london july reuters world trade volumes continued to rise in may but the rate of growth is decelerating consistent with other signs that the global economic expansion is moving into a slower phase
trade volumes rose by percent in may compared with april according to the latest data from the netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis world trade monitor cpb july
but volumes in the three months from march to may were just percent higher than in the same period a year earlier a marked slowdown from growth of over percent in late and early
the fastest growth in may was reported in china asia the middle east and the united states with volumes in most other regions actually declining during the month
volumes on the routes are likely to have been flattered by the race to beat tariffs announced by the united states and china which led to an upsurge in container arrivals in may and june
the impact will probably prove temporary and is likely to unwind in the second half of the year as the tariffs go into effect and the supply chain digests higher than normal inventories after stocking up
in much of the rest of the world the picture is one of moderating and increasingly unbalanced growth after the strong synchronised upturn in
the trade figures are consistent with leading indicators compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd which show the rate of economic growth peaking in the second half of
the oecd s composite indicators show growth accelerating in the united states china and india in the early months of this year but losing momentum in other countries
signs of a moderation in growth are also evident in south korea s kospi share index often seen as a leading indicator for world trade growth given the country s heavy export orientation
over the last two decades the kopsi share index has been closely correlated with world trade volumes as measured by the netherlands government statistics
the index peaked at the end of and has been steadily sliding throughout the first seven months of
kospi was up percent in the months to october but the annual comparisons have gradually become less favourable and annual growth turned negative in june and july
if kospi remains a good early warning indicator global trade growth seems likely to slow further over the next few months
