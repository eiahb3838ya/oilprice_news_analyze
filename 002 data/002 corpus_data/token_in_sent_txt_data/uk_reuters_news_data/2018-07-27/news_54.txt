australia's darwin seeks to shed frontier image to become world-class lng export hub
fields off darwin hold tcf of natural gas enough space at ichthys and darwin lng to add trains study recommends million expansion of darwin lng but conocophillips focused on backfill for darwin lng train by sonali paul and osamu tsukimori july reuters australia s tropical city of darwin wants to establish itself as a energy export hub building on its closeness to demand centres in asia and abundant nearby natural gas resources
with the imminent of inpex corp s billion ichthys liquefied natural gas lng project the capital of the northern territory will be home to two lng exporting facilities with a total capacity of million tonnes a year including conocophillips darwin lng plant that opened in
darwin is poised to become the nucleus of the northern territory s push to expand lng exports by tapping trillion cubic feet tcf of gas offshore northern australia
perched at the top of the continent in a region known for saltwater crocodiles darwin is closer to jakarta than sydney
the city will vie with projects from alaska to qatar that will beef up global lng supply from onwards to meet growing demand in asia the world s top consuming region
we have the gas location and proximity to markets whether it s china india japan or indonesia said paul tyrrell chairman of the northern territory gas taskforce appointed to lead the region s gas push
ichthys and darwin lng have the space to add five more lng production units know as trains with a feasibility study at darwin lng suggesting another unit producing million tonnes per year tpy of the fuel would be optimal
darwin lng s expansion would build off existing facilities an advantage over the billion of projects built from scratch in australia over the past decade said graeme bethune chief executive of advisory firm energyquest
there s a reasonable chance an expansion decision could be made within the next five years bethune said
a second train at darwin lng would raise the northern territory s lng output to nearly million tpy equivalent to indonesia the world s exporter according to data from the international gas union igu
we remain open to all options for a potential expansion of darwin lng a spokesman for conocophillips australia said adding the company wanted to get the most out of the region s reserves
but first conoco wants to secure gas to keep the original train filled when supply from its current source the bayu undan field in the timor sea north of darwin runs out in
conoco and its partners santos and south korea s sk e s have agreed to conduct preliminary design work to develop the barossa field kilometres miles north of darwin to supply darwin lng
darwin excites the heck out of me said santos chief executive kevin gallagher at an industry conference in may
santos also has stakes in the petrel tern and crown lasseter fields that could also feed darwin lng
other reserves offshore darwin are evans shoal operated by italy s eni greater sunrise operated by woodside petroleum cash maple operated by thailand s pttep and conocophillips poseidon
inpex would only make a decision to expand exports after getting the initial ichthys trains up and running after the project has missed several deadlines for first production
we have to produce million tonnes first and then examine whether there is demand
at this stage there is no concrete plan inpex chief executive officer takayuki ueda told reuters earlier this month
still ueda said the infrastructure for an expansion is in place
we can develop new gas fields nearby and send gas through the current pipeline he said
in addition to the offshore gas the northern territory holds tcf of onshore shale gas resources that could fuel manufacturing around darwin
the territory lifted a ban on fracking in april and is developing strict environmental rule before exploration starts
however environmental groups farmers and indigenous communities are concerned about damage to water supplies
we don t think the government here is up to the task of managing this high risk industry said lauren mellor a spokeswoman for the frack free nt alliance
