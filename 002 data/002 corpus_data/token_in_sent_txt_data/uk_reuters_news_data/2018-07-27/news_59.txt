u.s. epa will enforce 'glider truck' limits after states sue
washington reuters the environmental protection agency s acting chief said late thursday the government will withdraw a decision to lift strict sales limits on remanufactured heavy duty vehicles known as glider trucks
the vehicles have a used engine in a new frame and rules introduced under former president barack obama a democrat said nearly all new trucks on the road must use more efficient less polluting engines
the glider trucks emit up to times more diesel particulate matter and up to times more nitrogen oxides than new trucks on the market the epa has said
environmental defense fund edf president fred krupp said the decision is a huge win for all americans who care about clean air and human these diesel freight trucks fill our lungs with a toxic stew of pollution
epa s effort to create a loophole allowing more of them onto our roads was irresponsible and dangerous he added
the epa issued a no action memo on july that declared the agency would not enforce a limit of up to gliders per manufacturer
acting epa administrator andrew wheeler who took over earlier this month said in a memo thursday withdrawing the guidance he had concluded that the application of current regulations to the glider industry does not represent the kind of extremely unusual circumstances that support the epa s exercise of enforcement a federal appeals court on july temporarily blocked the epa reversal after environmental groups including edf sued the agency to force the agency to enforce the existing rules
on july states and the district of columbia also sued the epa
new jersey attorney general gurbir grewal said the july memo was blatantly unlawful by letting more of these super polluting trucks on the road epa is putting politics before the public s health and the epa had said in its july memo that enforcing the rules would result in the loss of jobs and threaten the viability of companies making the glider trucks
the epa in november issued a proposal regulation to undo the glider rule but has not finalized it
wheeler s memo thursday said the epa will move as expeditiously as possible on revising the regulations that apply to the introduction of glider vehicles into commerce to the extent consistent with statutory requirements and due consideration of air quality an epa spokesperson confirmed thursday the guidance had been withdrawn
volvo group north america cummins inc and navistar international corp told the epa last year they opposed efforts to reverse the limits on glider trucks
glider kits should not be used for circumventing purchase of currently certified the move could inflict uncertainty and damage to our industry the companies said
the epa has previously said that if gliders were allowed through they would make up percent of the freight trucks on the road but would account for one third of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the heavy truck fleet
new york attorney general barbara underwood one of the state officials suing said the epa has estimated that adding glider trucks with engines onto our roads in a single year could result in up to premature deaths and tons of additional nitrogen oxide emissions
glider companies told the epa that glider trucks are percent cheaper than new vehicles
in august the obama administration issued final rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from medium and heavy duty trucks through a sector that accounts for percent of carbon pollution from vehicles
the commercial vehicle rules are expected to cut billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions the obama administration estimated
