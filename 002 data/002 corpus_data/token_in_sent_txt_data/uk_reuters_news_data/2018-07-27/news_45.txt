poll-nigerian economy to grow more slowly before 2019 elections
nigeria s economy to grow percent this year political wrangling to lead to more cautious business decisions kenya growing at solid pace despite challenges reuters nigeria gdp forecasts reuters kenya gdp forecasts by vuyani ndaba johannesburg july reuters nigeria s economy is expected to grow more slowly this year than previously forecast as investors hold off before elections in early a reuters poll showed on friday while kenyan growth is forecast at more than double the pace
in the poll taken in the past week analysts and economists forecasts showed a median of percent growth for nigeria accelerating to percent next year
that was a significant downgrade from the previous poll taken three months ago which showed africa s largest economy expanding percent this year after a lacklustre percent in
upcoming elections and the associated politics already underway would instigate caution on the part of economic stakeholders said rafiq raji chief economist at macroafricaintel in lagos who expects the economy to slow in the next few quarters
business and investment decisions are thus likely to be postponed till after the elections he added
nigerians vote in february
on tuesday senators quit president muhammadu buhari s ruling party and the country s third most senior politician said he might follow suit in a blow to the leader who is seeking next year
this comes at a tough time for the economy
growth slowed in the first quarter of for the first time since the country pulled out of recession last year as the sector struggled
fellow heavyweight south africa also suffered its worst quarterly contraction in nine years in a reminder to investors of the huge challenge president cyril ramaphosa faces to deliver long term economic growth
a separate survey earlier this month showed south african gdp is expected to grow percent this year
however reserve bank governor lesetja kganyago shocked markets last week when he revealed the bank projects growth at only percent slower than last year
it is a different story for kenya east africa s biggest economy where analysts forecasts showed a median of percent growth this year despite its debt problems
that was unchanged from a poll taken three months ago
growth is expected to accelerate next year to percent slightly faster than in the last survey
raji attributed this to the fact that kenya is now an oil producer even though robust production levels are a long way off
he cautioned that the recent suspension of production by tullow on security grounds could cause problems
tullow aims to produce the first oil from its billion kenya project by allowing the country to export crude
however protests and security problems have halted a pilot scheme which trucks around barrels of oil per day to a storage facility in mombasa
major african economies are also at risk to what may be more difficult times for the world economy
reuters polls of several hundred economists taken this month show global economic activity remains solid but has already passed its peak with protectionist trade policies likely to slow activity significantly
the impact of higher trade tariffs will weigh on inflation and consumption expenditure in advanced economies said gaimin nonyane head of economic research at ecobank group
extended sentiment is also a downside risk to price levels and growth in developing but many african economies have been relatively insulated from the challenges facing larger global economies
in ethiopia for example growth has averaged nearly percent for the past decade albeit from a very low base
