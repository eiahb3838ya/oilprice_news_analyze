update 3-imperial oil seeks to diversify refinery's supply after syncrude outage
reuters an unplanned shutdown this summer of canada s syncrude oil sands site has caused imperial oil ltd to look to lessen its biggest refinery s reliance on it imperial s chief executive said on friday
imperial holds a percent stake in syncrude which is majority owned by suncor energy inc
it was forced to shut down last month after a power transformer failed
syncrude s barrel per day mine and oil upgrading site in northern alberta accounts for percent of canada s oil production
nearly all of imperial s share of its output feeds the strathcona refinery to produce gasoline and other products accounting for of the refinery s oil supply chief executive rich kruger said
when syncrude has an unplanned event the supply folk at strathcona do need to scramble and unfortunately they have had to scramble the last few years more than they would like kruger said on a conference call with analysts
imperial is testing the suitability of other types of light and synthetic crude to determine if it should secure other supply agreements for the refinery kruger said
the syncrude events are more troubling for their impact on strathcona
it does affect the ability to run that refinery at the highest level of reliability without suncor said this week that some syncrude production has been restored and full production may come online in september
imperial s profit missed analyst estimates by a wide margin on friday hurt by costs from planned maintenance at various projects
shares of the company which is majority owned by exxon mobil corp dipped percent in toronto
the company had scheduled maintenance at several projects including a turnaround at strathcona
but cost overruns hurt its bottom line with analysts at eight capital saying the hit from maintenance of about c million or canadian cents a share was bigger than expected
the company reported net profit of c million million or canadian cents per share in the quarter compared with a loss a year earlier
on an adjusted basis it earned canadian cents a share while analysts expected a profit of canadian cents according to thomson reuters
gross production rose to barrels of oil equivalent per day from boepd a year earlier but missed some analysts estimates
