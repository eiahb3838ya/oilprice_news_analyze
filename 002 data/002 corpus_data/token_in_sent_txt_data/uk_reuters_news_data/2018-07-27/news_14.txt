update 1-lopez obrador seeks to boost mexico oil output to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.9 mln
mexico city reuters mexican andres manuel lopez obrador said on friday his administration will look to boost the country s crude oil production to million barrels per day bpd from million bpd now
lopez obrador elected in a landslide july victory and who will take office on has said he is committed to expanding mexico s oil and gas output which has declined steadily over the past years due to a lack of investment and natural depletion of oil fields
the leftist leader said he will look to revamp the nation s six refineries so they are operating at full capacity within two years and plans to build a new refinery in dos bocas in mexico s southern tabasco state with an investment of billion pesos billion over three years
with this new refinery and the rehabilitation of the six that already exist we re going to make good on our campaign promise of stopping purchases of gasoline abroad and of lowering fuel prices by the middle of my term he said
mexico has imported an average of about barrels per day bpd of gasoline and another bpd of diesel so far this year almost all of it from the united states as gasoline output at the country s six refineries owned and operated by pemex has halved since the first year of outgoing president enrique pena nieto s term
he tapped rocio nahle who also won a senate seat in the election to be energy minister and named octavio romero oropeza to be pemex s next chief executive
lopez obrador said his government would look to increase electricity production by revamping mexico s hydroelectric power stations
we re going to start by modernizing hydroelectric plants because we have underutilized infrastructure
we re going to generate electricity with the dams that currently exist he said
lopez obrador said he expects his administration to invest billion pesos billion next year to strengthen the energy sector
