norway oil, gas union widens six-day drilling rig strike
oslo july reuters a norwegian union for workers on offshore oil and gas drilling rigs stepped up a strike on monday that has slightly hit oil output after employers did not respond to demands for higher wages and pension benefits
the union is adding workers to the strike under a plan announced last week after failing to win concessions before a midnight gmt deadline since almost workers on the rigs went on strike on tuesday
the expanded strike will not have any immediate extra impact on oil or gas production beyond the closure last week of shell s knarr field which produces barrels of oil equivalent per day
both the safe union and employers in the norwegian shipowners association said late on sunday they had no contacts or new offers during the weekend
the websites of both sides which they said would notify workers of any breakthroughs had no updates as the deadline passed
the escalation takes place from midnight as planned safe union spokesman roy aleksandersen said just before deadline
the workers on the offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike after rejecting a proposed wage and pension deal
the employees joining the action work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by saipem transocean songa offshore odfjell drilling archer and cosl among others
