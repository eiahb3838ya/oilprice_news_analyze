u.s. oil boom delivers surprise for traders - and it's costly
york reuters the world s biggest oil traders are counting hefty losses after a surprise doubling in the price discount of light crude to benchmark brent in just a month as surging production upends the market
trading desks of oil major bp and merchants vitol gunvor and trafigura have recorded losses in the tens of millions of dollars each as a result of the whipsaw move when the spread reached more than a barrel in june insiders familiar with their performance told reuters
the sources did not give precise figures for the losses but they said they were enough for gunvor and bp to fire at least one trader each
the companies declined to comment and none of them publish details of their individual trading books
it highlights the challenges of trading in wti futures the benchmark for crude when pipeline and storage infrastructure struggles to keep pace with surging shale output that has lifted the united states above saudi arabia to become the world s second biggest crude producer behind russia
as the exporter of crude traders are naturally long wti and hedge their bets by shorting brent
when the spreads widen so wildly you lose money said a top executive with one of the four trading firms
the discount of wti to brent hit a barrel on june the widest in more than three years as output surged to record highs and surpassed pipeline capacity as traders rushed to export
the discount had been about just a month before
betting on the price spread a popular trade in oil markets is based on predictions of price differences between european and market fundamentals
for a graphic on wti to brent spread click the jump in output now almost million barrels per day bpd from below million bpd a decade ago has upended the spread
until crude mostly traded at a premium to brent
but the growing availability of crude has meant that it has almost always been at a discount since then
however it is the big sudden moves that tend to claim trade casualties sometimes earning the moniker widowmaker
since the june spike the spread has narrowed sharply again
the shrinking discount was helped by a rise in the price of wti due to an unexpected outage at the syncrude oil sands site in canada which can produce up to bpd
due to the canadian outage inventories last week at the cushing delivery point for crude futures fell to their lowest since december data showed
volatility in the spread has been just one of several trading hazards that emerged in the first quarter of
traders have also had to pay heavy premiums to exit storage leases as the oil price structure flipped to backwardation when prices are higher than those for later delivery making it unprofitable to store crude
climbing output has put strains on the pipeline network particularly in the permian basin in texas which has been the biggest contributor to the production surge
a bottleneck that hit crude for delivery in midland texas caught bp off guard and led to losses when the discount to wti shifted sharply during april to june according to four market sources and one source close to bp
in late april the discount was close to a barrel before widening to as much as on may
this was followed by a sharp bounce back to around in the second half of may followed by a similar move in june
three bp traders took the heat for losses related to the midland rollercoaster
the source close to bp said one was sacked and two others were reshuffled internally
