update 1-russia's novatek ships first lng cargo to china via arctic
first ever lng cargo to china via northern sea route drastically cuts delivery time to asian customers writes through adds detail moscow july reuters russian natural gas producer novatek delivered on thursday the first ever liquefied natural gas lng cargo to china via the northern sea route nsr alongside the arctic coast which drastically cuts delivery time to asian consumers
the shipments of lng from yamal lng project via the nsr to china cuts transportation time and costs in comparison to other routes such as suez canal
novatek said a ceremony was held to commemorate the arrival of lng tankers vladimir rusanov and eduard toll with cargo capacity over cubic meters each to the chinese port of jiangsu rudong
utilizing the northern sea route as a viable transportation route contributes to the development of the northern regions and is very important for our country s economic development novatek s head leonid mikhelson said in a statement
china s national energy administration said china national petroleum corp cnpc will start lifting at least million tonnes of lng from yamal starting in
the passageway is important for yamal because it cuts shipping times to its main customers in asia by nearly half to days and thus saving time and suez canal fees incurred on the westward route
the billion yamal lng plant developed by novatek and france s total despite sanctions started exporting in december but cargoes ferried on lng tankers have only sailed to europe so far
the nsr which is crucial for yamal lng typically opens for summer navigation from june until november but severe ice conditions this year have delayed the start of deliveries
from there yamal s lng was transferred on to standard tankers for onward shipment to asia via the suez canal or else sold and used in europe at a time when the nsr was shut
novatek also plans to develop another project of producing the frozen gas arctic lng which is set to start producing lng in
tass news agency citing mikhelson said novatek was in talks with cnpc and the silk road fund on participating in the arctic lng project
novatek hopes to complete the talks in the near future in order to take an official investment decision on this project by the middle of mikhelson was quoted as saying
total agreed to buy a percent stake in the arctic gas project under a deal struck during french president emmanuel macron s visit to russia in may
novatek is interested in saudi aramco joining the arctic plant as a partner mikhelson said in february highlighting growing ties between russia and saudi arabia
