japan's lng imports fall to lowest since may 2016 as nuclear units come online
tokyo july reuters japanese imports of liquefied natural gas lng in june fell to the lowest in more than two years as the country s utilities switched on more nuclear reactors that had been shut in the wake of the fukushima atomic disaster in
japan has six reactors operating and three others have passed safety inspections and could be operating by october allowing utilities to switch away from lng
spot prices for the fuel rose to high in june
japan the world s biggest importer of lng brought in million tonnes of the fuel in june down more than percent from a year earlier official data showed on wednesday
that was the lowest monthly import number since may
imports of thermal coal also fell in june down percent from a year earlier and the lowest since may the data showed
the fukushima disaster in march sparked the country s worst energy crisis in the period forcing it to import huge amounts of lng and driving prices to record highs
they also turned to cheaper coal imports
all of the country s reactors were eventually shut down to be relicensed under new safety rules after the disaster highlighted regulatory and operator failings
nine out of commercially operable units have been relicensed under the new rules
one of the three not operating has been shut down by a court order that expires in september while the other two are under regular maintenance and refuelling and due to start operating within weeks
still nuclear power remains unpopular in the country and many hurdles remain to getting more units operating beyond the nine approved analysts have said
