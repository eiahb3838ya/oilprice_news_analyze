column-u.s. spr oil release would be a mistake: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chart chart by john kemp london july reuters releasing crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve spr in response to a rise in prices resulting from the reimposition of sanctions on iran would be a mistake and ultimately
the spr has sufficient crude to offset any loss of exports from iran for many months especially if stock releases are combined with increased oil production by saudi arabia and other members of opec
the statutes governing the operation of the spr grant the president broad discretion to order a drawdown and any order is unlikely to be constrained by congress or the courts
but the spr was established to deal with interruptions of crude supplies and is not suited to managing changes in the supply situation
in particular if the purpose is to relieve upward pressure on prices it would blunt the signal needed to help the market adapt to sanctions
if the spr release succeeded in holding down prices it would discourage the rise in production needed to replace lost iranian barrels while allowing rapid consumption growth to remain unchecked
deploying the spr to manage a loss of iranian oil supplies would ultimately prove and deplete the reserve if pursued for any length of time
like a management system which can even out shifts in supply and demand but not enduring ones the spr is best employed to deal with supply interruptions not changes
the united states is considering releasing crude stocks from the spr possibly in conjunction with its partners in the international energy agency iea according to news reports to prevent a sharp rise in oil prices
the trump administration is actively assessing whether to dip into the country s emergency oil stocks while it simultaneously pushes other countries to boost output the wall street journal reported on july
a drawdown is not imminent but being considered if increased output from saudi arabia and other opec members fails to avert another sharp increase in prices the journal reported citing people familiar with the matter
the president has broad authority to order a drawdown in response to a severe energy supply interruption under the energy policy and conservation act as amended pl
the law authorises the president to direct a drawdown in response to an interruption in physical supplies usc or a significant rise in prices that is likely to have a major adverse impact on the economy usc
while the decision is subject to conditions set out in the statute they are written so vaguely that the president has almost complete flexibility
congress and the courts have traditionally deferred to the president on national security so it is unlikely either would constrain a drawdown order
presidents have twice ordered emergency drawdowns in response to the first gulf war and hurricane katrina
and the white house has once ordered a sale in response to supply interruptions in libya and other countries as part of coordinated action with other iea member states
other sales have been authorised to test the release process or mandated by congress for budgetary reasons history of spr releases department of energy
the reserve has also swapped or loaned oil to refiners on a number of occasions to deal with shortfalls
if the administration determines that a release of crude from the spr would be advantageous for policy or political reasons there is nothing to prevent the president from ordering it in the coming months
the spr s formidable size makes it a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy according to the department of energy s website
the reserve contains around million barrels of crude down from a peak of million barrels in january mostly as a result of sales
even so the spr holds enough crude to cover refiners net import requirements for more than days which provides a huge degree of supply security
import cover has continued to climb in recent years even as the number of barrels in storage has fallen slightly
thanks to the shale revolution oil production has risen and net crude imports have fallen from almost million barrels per day in to million bpd in
as a result the spr s import cover has climbed from a recent low of just days at the end of and days at the end of to days at the end of
some analysts argue the spr now holds more barrels than is needed for national and economic security reasons doe needs to strengthen its approach to planning the future of the emergency stockpile gao june
in these circumstances the president could easily direct the release of million million or even million barrels without compromising its ability to meet future supply shortages
releasing million barrels would be enough to offset the complete loss of iranian exports for more than a month
assuming some exports continued saudi arabia boosted its own production and spr releases were matched by other iea members a drawdown could make up for the loss of iranian barrels for many months
the spr contains enough crude to enable the united states to enforce a total or partial oil blockade against iran for at least six to months and perhaps longer while trying to limit the rise in oil prices
in theory the united states could try to cut off iran s oil exports partially or completely while ensuring global oil supplies remained unchanged
policymakers appear to be exploring this option if recent briefings given to journalists are anything to go by
it is consistent with the president s repeated public messages on twitter and television calling on the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to increase production
it would facilitate the trump administration s policy of maximum pressure against iran while trying to avoid an economically and politically damaging spike in prices
the administration is likely to be especially sensitive to the political fallout with congressional elections due on
but the problem with employing the spr to manipulate prices is that it will create growing distortion in the global market
using the spr to hold down prices at a point in the cycle when they need to rise to boost production and restrain consumption growth will ultimately add to volatility
releasing the spr might have some value as economic shock and awe especially if the number of barrels offered for sale was large
however like every other attempt to manipulate the market employing the spr to manage oil prices is unlikely to be successful in the medium term
it might have a calming effect allowing the administration to subject iran to an intense economic siege for several months in the hope tehran buckles under the pressure
but the longer any spr release is sustained the more distorting it will become
