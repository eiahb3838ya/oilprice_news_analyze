exclusive-general electric's power unit faces threat in saudi arabia
new york and abu dhabi reuters one of general electric co s largest and most valuable customers saudi arabia is lining up competitors to bid against ge for lucrative power plant work according to five people familiar with the situation
saudi electricity co sec has qualified at least two companies power systems mfg llc and combustion parts inc to provide service or parts for some of sec s more than turbines and is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the sec plants over many years according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter
the qualifications for the first time puts sec in position to break ge s hold on that work by having others bid against ge on maintaining the fleet among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry when the existing contracts come up according to the sources and industry databases
saudi arabia the world s largest oil producer has grown increasingly cost conscious and under its vision reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence lower state budget deficits and create jobs
the kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies according to a source with direct knowledge of sec
the utility is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services rather than relying on ge as the sole provider because qualifying competitors will lower prices the source said
saudi electricity co previously created competition for an of turbines known as the according to the sources
after bidding began ge ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about percent sources said
one side effect of saudi electricity co qualifying firms to repair its is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside saudi arabia potentially threatening portions of ge s service business globally three sources said
for bidders qualifying also provides inroads to selling to other utilities and even other industries because sec is seen as technically sophisticated and other companies would rely on its qualification one of the sources said
sec declined to comment as did power systems manufacturing a unit of ansaldo energia spa of genoa italy and san combustion parts inc
in response to questions from reuters ge said at present ge s units in sec continue to be covered under service ge chief executive john flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to ge s power business where profit fell percent last year
the division which makes equipment for gas coal and nuclear power plants is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants
as a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue ge in may posted videos on youtube saying it is offering upgrades to turbines made by rivals siemens ag and mitsubishi hitachi power systems
saudi electricity co has not yet offered any substantial contracts to new bidders and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids the sources said
one source with knowledge of ge s service history in saudi arabia said some turbines that sec purchased more recently may not be under agreements because the service price was high and those could be opened for bidding by sec at any time
in addition to psm and cpi two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on sec s plants chromalloy based in palm beach gardens florida and al masaood john brown in dubai
both said they already work on sec s turbines
al masaood john brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain components at its dubai facility
it plans to present this to sec as a way of kick starting the formal process general manager brian waddell said in an email
chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on sec s turbines for the long term
we re definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with sec on that said spokesman jeff romaine
we re looking at doing parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term he added
that s what sec is asking us reporting by alwyn scott in new york stephen kalin in saudi arabia and stanley carvalho in abu dhabi editing by joe white and edward tobin
