update 1-in sign of supply flexibility, russia wields oil stocks to boost output
russia increased oil output by bpd in june part of that came from storage three sources russia has around bpd storage calculations saudi arabia has spare capacity of mln bpd russia saudi oil output graphic adds graphics more comments from transneft by olesya astakhova and gleb gorodyankin moscow july reuters russia used stocks held in tanks at its oilfields to help boost crude production in june three industry sources told reuters in a sign of supply flexibility as opec kingpin saudi arabia pushes other major producers to increase spare output capacity
russian oil production last month rose by around barrels per day from may
from july the country s average oil output was million bpd an increase of bpd from may two industry sources said
saudi arabia increased its oil output by bpd in june from may pumping an average of million bpd and selling even more with some of that supply coming from storage opec sources told reuters
the difference between the two countries numbers lies in the scale and sustainability of the increase thanks to the geological structure of saudi fields producer saudi aramco can quickly add and cut supply
such adjustments are harder to perform in russia where oilfields and production equipment in siberia for example are beset by freezing temperatures
but the country does have some flexibility thanks to spare capacity in the transneft pipeline system and in oil tanks at fields sources say
oil production has restarted so quickly thanks to stocks in reservoirs tanks in western siberia
they belong both to transneft and to the oil companies a senior oil executive told reuters
another oilman and an industry source confirmed that russian oil companies had boosted production partially thanks to their stocks
they did not say how much of june s increase came from stocks
according to the sources and an analyst russia has around bpd in spare capacity that can be used to stock oil
last month the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other producers led by russia agreed to ease global output cuts adding around million bpd to the market from july
of that increase moscow promised to contribute bpd
under an agreement that took effect at the start of russia s initial cut was bpd
in may saudi energy minister khalid said he was concerned about possible shortages of spare crude output capacity
we certainly don t feel we are where we need to be with complete market stability falih said
transneft s system can hold around million tonnes of stocks equal to about days of russian crude production according to the pipeline monopoly
but much of that capacity is needed for pumping and mixing different types of crude sources say estimating that only a third can be used for stockpiling oil
igor dyomin an adviser to transneft s president said in emailed comments to reuters that the company s inventory capacity was not used for oil storage
the inventories capacity of transneft is not used for storage of oil including from the oil companies
it is a part of the system which ensures the technological process of seamless oil and oil products transportation from the producers to the consumers he said
for the past three years these volumes have been alternating insignificantly on a monthly basis and are not related to the production curbs within the deal with opec dyomin said
another two industry sources said russian oil firms combined had storage facilities with a capacity of around million tonnes located at their fields
these facilities house the mixture of mostly water and oil that producers extract from the ground
given that many oilfields in western siberia have significant water content such storage can stockpile million tonnes of pure crude oil according to estimates by mikhail sheybe an analyst with sberbank cib
this brings total spare capacity to as much as million tonnes of oil equal to bpd
in june russian average oil output exceeded million bpd for the first time since april
saudi arabia by its own estimates has million bpd of spare capacity that could be deployed to help compensate for falling output in venezuela and iran
one source said russia s oil storage was overloaded by the time moscow negotiated an easing of global production cuts with saudi arabia and other nations
the covers on tanks had been torn off at many oil production sites that source said
not all of the increase in russian supply came from storage as oil companies were ramping up production following the easing of output curbs the sources said
they did not provide a breakdown or identify the companies
according to analysts top russian oil producer rosneft was believed to be able to restore bpd of output in just two days
gazprom neft promised half of that
lukoil russia s oil producer has increased output by bpd chief executive vagit alekperov said on wednesday thanks to what he said was the restart of previously suspended wells
russia s rosneft gazprom neft lukoil and the energy ministry did not immediately reply to reuters requests for comment
