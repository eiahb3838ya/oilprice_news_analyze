update 1-saudi aramco in talks to buy stake in world's no. 4 chemical firm
dubai reuters saudi aramco said on thursday it is looking to buy a strategic stake in saudi petrochemical maker sabic a move that could boost the state oil giant s market valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering
aramco said in a statement that it was in very discussions with the kingdom s public investment fund pif to acquire the stake in sabic via a private transaction
it has no plans to acquire any publicly held shares it said
sabic the world s petrochemicals company is percent owned by the pif saudi arabia s top sovereign wealth fund
it has a market capitalisation of billion saudi riyals billion pounds
reuters reported on wednesday that saudi aramco had invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in saudi basic industries corp sabic citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter
the size of the stake aramco is interested in acquiring is not known
aramco said it had been evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities both local and global in line with its strategy of rebalancing its portfolio by moving further into downstream particularly the petrochemical sector
in a separate statement the pif said that talks on a sale were in the early stages
there is a possibility that no agreement will be reached in relation to this potential transaction the pif said
aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to percent of the world s largest oil producer possibly by next year
boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract investors for the ipo
shares in sabic the largest listed company in the gulf were down by percent at gmt on thursday
aramco invited the banks to pitch for a potential sabic deal last month the sources told reuters on wednesday declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities
the aramco ipo is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by crown prince mohammed bin salman to diversify saudi arabia s economy beyond oil
prince mohammed has said the ipo will value aramco at a minimum of trillion although some analysts estimates are between trillion and trillion
preparations for the ipo which may be the biggest in history have slowed with some sources close to the process say the plans for a domestic and international listing might be pushed further into next year or even beyond
a final decision has yet to be made by prince mohammed who oversees the kingdom s economic and oil policies the sources said
the complexity of the listing legal worries and conflicting recommendations from different advisers have delayed they added
the decision by prince mohammed is pending said one of the sources familiar with the ipo process
saudi arabia s energy minister khalid said last month it would be nice to see aramco floated in adding the timing was not critical to the government
aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand
the oil giant is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants
aramco s push into chemicals includes a it is building at home with sabic
the billion project would be to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly bypassing the refining stage
