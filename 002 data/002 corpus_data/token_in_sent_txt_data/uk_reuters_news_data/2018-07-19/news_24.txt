industry body gives detail on timing of potential import halt comes as demands nations stop taking oil cargoes from iran shippers tell japan refiners will not carry iran oil adds comment detail graphic by osamu tsukimori tokyo july reuters japanese oil refiners will likely stop loading iranian crude by with final shipments arriving in the first half of october the head of the nation s oil refiners association said on thursday as the pressures countries to halt such imports
president donald trump s administration has demanded nations cut all their imports of iranian oil from november as it reimposes sanctions over tehran s nuclear programme
although it has said that some allies who are particularly reliant on iranian supplies may be granted waivers that would give them more time to wind down shipments
japanese oil refiners have been making preparations for lifting plans on the assumption that sanctions are to be applied the president of the petroleum association of japan paj takashi tsukioka said
considering that payment is to be finished by end of october it is important that the refiners would finish loading iranian oil before tsukioka added that the industry is asking the japanese government to push to maintain current levels of iranian imports in talks with the united states
but a japanese government source who declined to be identified said winning a waiver was seen as difficult
paj had said last month that japanese refiners would likely stop importing from iran but on thursday gave more details on potential timings
many refiners in japan the world s oil importer say they are resigned to completely halting imports from one of their historically important suppliers unlike during a previous round of sanctions when they substantially reduced imports from the middle eastern country
three industry sources familiar with the matter said shipping companies had told refiners in japan that they would stop carrying oil cargoes from iran
the sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media
that would follow similar announcements by the world s biggest shipping companies including
of denmark
unlike japan china and some countries in europe have significantly raised purchases following the lifting of previous sanctions
it would be unreasonable for japanese refining industry to be influenced similarly by such countries said tsukioka who also serves as chairman of japan s refiner idemitsu kosan

japanese refiners are looking to secure alternative supplies from the middle east and the among others industry sources have said
