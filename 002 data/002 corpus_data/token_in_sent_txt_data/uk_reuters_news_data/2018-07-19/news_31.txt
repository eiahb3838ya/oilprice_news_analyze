big crude oil margins should boost u.s. refiner earnings
new york july reuters refiners ran in the second quarter fueled by cheap domestic crude and fat margins that should boost earnings though their heavy activity could eventually saturate the market with gasoline sapping profits down the road
independent refiners including phillips and marathon petroleum corp are expected to announce strong results due to the heavy discounts for and canadian crude along with strong fuel demand and lower costs to comply with the nation s biofuel laws analysts said
strong crack spreads the margin on turning crude oil into diesel gasoline and other products have spurred refiners to keep production high
that margin averaged about per barrel in the second quarter its highest since
for a graphic on daily crack spreads see among the largest independent refiners marathon cvr energy and hollyfrontier corp rank in the top percent in thomson reuters analyst revisions models which weighs recent changes in estimates for revenue and earnings suggesting positive trends headed into reporting season for refiners which begins next week
the discount on crude prices in midland texas widened by nearly a barrel against benchmark futures during the second quarter as production in the permian surged beyond pipeline capacity to move oil out of the region
increased export demand also led to high utilization rates a positive said sandeep sayal vice president in the refining and marketing group at ihs markit
the united states exported about million barrels per day bpd of products through the second quarter according to data from the energy information administration
refinery utilization rates hit their highest levels since in june as they processed record amounts of crude oil in june according to the eia
however high utilization rates could lead to oversupply of gasoline in the coming months which would dampen refiners future profit margins
the next month or you might have some question marks around the gasoline market justin jenkins lead refining analyst at raymond james in houston said
the outlook is a tale of two stories analysts said
gasoline inventories have swelled amid high runs and tepid demand growth which will hurt the margin for further processing of gasoline
however stockpiles of distillates which include diesel and heating oil have sunk below lows this summer amid surprising domestic demand and continued pull from latin america
as the winter approaches the traditional season for heating oil demand that could again help refining margins
it s going to be a real tug of war the higher price of diesel versus a weakening gasoline market zachary rogers a refining analyst at wood mackenzie said
refiners have already begun switching yields to distillates to chase margins despite being in the heart of the busy summer driving season rogers said
however they can only alter their yield by a few percent particularly because refiners are flush with light crude that produces naphtha rogers said
refiners such as delek us holdings inc and hollyfrontier which source a majority of their crude from the permian and are capable of processing mostly light sweet crude stand to benefit from cheap feedstock
gasoline days of supply stood at days last week just shy of the highest on record for this time of year eia data showed
overall inventories are percent above the historical average data shows
refiners may have to consider more dramatic measures such as refinery run cuts if gasoline inventory does not clear out
at the same time distillate inventories are at their lowest seasonally since and about percent below the same time last year
