focus-after crisis, colombia's ecopetrol spends big to boost output, reserves
acacias colombia reuters splattered with mud a dozen workers wrestled a drill bit into position on a oil rig platform in central colombia readying it for work once the storm passed
the rig at the castilla oil field in the wide central plains of meta province is one of a fleet deployed by colombian oil company ecopetrol under a billion investment plan this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves
the company has boosted its investment by more than billion from billion a year earlier to finance drilling wells in
ecopetrol is targeting output of barrels per day bpd of crude and gas equivalent by the end of the year up from about now and the has set a more aggressive target of bpd by
castilla ecopetrol s most profitable oil field is pumping about bpd but should approach by the end of next year said jose cotello for the orinoquia region in eastern colombia which includes castilla
the expansion would make it the country s biggest producing field
it pumps heavy oil which typically sells at a discount to lighter crude that is easier to refine
right now however heavier crude is in demand among refineries worldwide because of a fall in output of similar oil from neighbouring venezuela where lack of investment has pushed production to its lowest level in decades
ecopetrol has earmarked billion of the investment budget for the orinoquia region nearly double the year before but had to halt drilling for a month because protests closed castilla and other nearby fields in february
protesters angered by ecopetrol s alleged violations of labour agreements have blocked roads invaded fields and burnt buildings including a control room
the disruptions led to about million in losses over a month and delayed the start of operations at five wells
the big question is on drilling because we were stopped for a month cotello said in an interview after visiting the castilla field
nationwide ecopetrol will double the number of rigs in operation this year from last
it will operate rigs in the second half of the year and an additional rigs in joint operations with partners
the number of rigs had dwindled since the oil price crash of
the company is equally focused on finding more oil that it can produce in the future cotello said
the reserves on the company s books have dipped to the equivalent of about years of production according to ecopetrol
the country s energy ministry has a less optimistic estimate of years
both are well below the average of nearly years for the world s top oil and gas companies
investors look at reserves as a gauge for the sustainability of oil and gas firms
ecopetrol needed a big boost in spending after several years of underinvestment said an executive working for an international oil company working in a joint venture with ecopetrol
ecopetrol expects to quicken investment in the second half of the year after spending just million of the total budget during the first quarter of
the country s presidential election slowed spending because laws make it difficult for public companies to open bidding processes for contracts during the electoral process ecopetrol said
colombia s incoming president ivan duque will be inaugurated in august and has promised to help the energy industry
he has said he will invest in the company s refineries and crack down on militant groups that have attacked oil pipelines
he has also promised tax cuts across the economy including for the energy industry although has yet to disclose detailed proposals
colombia has struggled to attract investment and maintain energy output as conflict protests and attacks by criminal gangs have frequently interrupted operations
pumping through the cano oil pipeline restarted last week after days stoppage due to repeated attacks by marxist eln rebels military and industry sources said on tuesday
the pipeline has been attacked times this year by the national liberation army eln the largest active guerrilla group according to military sources
although the latest outage was one of the most extensive since the pipeline opened in the activity in the cano limon field operated by occidental petroleum corp and located in the northern arauca province has not been affected
the protests and attacks threaten to slow the momentum the company has gained since stabilizing its finances and reinvesting in production said jairo lastra investment manager at lastra capital management who previously worked at the money desk at ecopetrol
this year s expanded investment marks a big change for a company that cut drilling and shuttered an oil field when it lost more billion in after oil prices crashed
the rise in crude prices to highs has given the company the cash it needs to rebuild
profits rose by more than percent in to more than billion
in the first quarter of this year ecopetrol s profit topped million executives say
the crisis is in the rear view mirror cotello said
