u.s. solar installations will be flat this year -report
june reuters solar installations are expected to be flat this year compared with due to weakness in several major residential markets and slower growth in big projects according to a report released on tuesday
the solar market which for much of the last decade experienced runaway growth is expected to be about the same as the gigawatts installed in gtm research said in a report commissioned by the solar energy industries trade group
government policies that support renewable energy and a sharp fall in the price of the technology propelled expansion
but the solar market fell percent in
the decline was anticipated because in developers completed a slew of projects ahead of what was supposed to be an expiration of a key tax credit
ultimately the credit was extended
gtm research raised its forecast for installations by percent to gigawatts saying projects are relatively insulated from import tariffs on panels implemented by the trump administration this year because many developers secured supplies prior to their implementation
most of the impact of the tariffs will be seen next year and beyond gtm said reducing its forecast for by megawatts
that market will still grow next year by about percent but will be flat in and due to project delays the report said
module prices averaged cents per watt during the first quarter of percent higher than the cents they averaged a year ago due to the tariffs
the research firm ratcheted down its residential market outlook for by percent from gw to gw
mature residential markets including massachusetts new york and new jersey are expected to decline this year according to gtm analyst austin perea
residential solar fell percent last year but was flat during the first quarter
gtm said that was a promising sign that the market was recovering from a pullback over the last year by national installers like tesla inc
in the residential market total system prices have stagnated due to the high cost of acquiring customers
those costs have risen steadily over the last four quarters gtm said
