in oil market fundamentals however not all things point to higher prices with output from the three biggest producers russia the united states and saudi arabia on the rise
russian production has reportedly risen from below million barrels per day bpd to million bpd in early june
in the united states production has risen by almost a third in the last two years to a record of million bpd
now top exporter saudi arabia which has so far led opec s efforts to withhold supplies is also showing signs of upping production
saudi arabia has told opec that it raised oil output to a little more than million bpd in may up from million bpd in april
this fits with the theory that the saudis and russians are subtly moving toward a change to the agreement at this month s meeting mckenna said
opec together with some producers including russia started withholding output in to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices
