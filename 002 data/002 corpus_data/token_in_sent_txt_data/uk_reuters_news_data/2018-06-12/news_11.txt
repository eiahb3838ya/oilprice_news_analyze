u.s. electricity commission sees no emergency in power market
washington june reuters all five members of the panel that regulates the power grid indicated at a senate hearing on tuesday there was no emergency in the country s electricity markets potentially undermining efforts by president donald trump s administration to save ailing coal and nuclear plants through subsidies
trump this month directed energy secretary rick perry to take emergency measures to keep coal and nuclear plants running in order to protect national security
many of the plants have shut in the face of plentiful natural gas growth in wind and solar power and stagnant power demand
more closures are expected in coming years
kevin mcintyre the chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and one of three republicans on the five member panel said there was no immediate calamity or threat to power plants operating or serving the needs of consumers
senator martin heinrich a democrat later asked all members of the ferc at the senate energy committee hearing whether any of them saw a national security emergency in power markets
cheryl lafleur a democrat said she did not and the other four members responded to the question with silence
neil chatterjee another ferc republican cautioned that even though the power grid is reliable regulators need to be vigilant that the turn away from coal and nuclear to natural gas does not make the grid less able to bounce back from weather disasters and physical and cyber attacks on the infrastructure
but robert powelson a republican member of the commission said a directive to the energy department to subsidize coal and nuclear could result in significant rate increases without any corresponding reliability resilience or cyber security he said intervention threatens to collapse the wholesale competitive markets that have long been a cornerstone of ferc richard glick a democrat on the ferc said trump s push to save aging coal and nuclear plants would clearly raise power bills for residents and businesses
the question is how much he said
glick said estimates he had seen showed the country s utility rates could rise tens of billions of dollars
chatterjee from kentucky commiserated with senator steve daines of montana about how the loss of coal plants means job cuts at power generators and mines
but he suggested that lawmakers may have to legislate changes to help save those jobs
that is not something we factor into our record chatterjee said about the deliberations of ferc which ensures that power markets run efficiently
