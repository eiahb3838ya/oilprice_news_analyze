u.s. epa chief hints he could order more ethanol in fuel
new york june reuters a week after the white house suspended its bid to reform the nation s biofuels policy to aid oil refiners the head of the environmental protection agency on tuesday dangled a tantalizing prospect to midwest corn farmers saying the agency has the power to expand sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends
epa administrator scott pruitt made the comments during a tour of the midwest as he fended off criticism from farmers and heartland lawmakers that his attempts since last year to overhaul the renewable fuel standard rfs marked a betrayal of republican president donald trump s promises to support rural jobs
those efforts aimed at helping the oil industry cope with the costs of the rfs came to a halt last week when the white house delayed indefinitely the announcement of a deal that had been months in the making
the deal would have effectively reduce the amount of ethanol refiners were required to blend while also allowing summertime sales of gasoline containing percent ethanol a practice epa currently bans due to smog concerns
he said they have the authority to allow gasoline sales said bill pracht president and ceo of east kansas after pruitt visited his ethanol plant in the town of garnett
he didn t commit to it as a the corn industry has long sought approval to sell gasoline containing percent ethanol a blend called in the summer because it would increase demand for ethanol
epa currently bans during summer due to concerns the product contributes to smog a finding contested by the biofuels industry which has some research to back its position
epa spokesman lincoln ferguson confirmed pruitt s comments the administrator shared that he believes statutory authority to grant the waiver for exists under the clean air act and to be effective would require a subsequent notice and comment rule making the rfs requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel each year and prove compliance by earning or acquiring blending credits that must be handed in to the epa
the law has helped midwest corn farmers by creating a market for ethanol but refining companies have complained it incurs steep costs for them
the white house deal last week would have allowed biofuels exports to count for the first time toward the annual volumes quotas reducing the blending burden on refiners and lowering their costs
farm state lawmakers refused to support that idea even though it also would have provided the waiver as a concession to the corn lobby
during his visit pruitt added that he still supported allowing exports of ethanol and other renewables to qualify under the rfs though he said the decision from the white house on that was put on hold according to pracht
it was important he finally got a glimpse of our industry firsthand said pracht
this is such an economic driver for our community said of his operation which employs people
