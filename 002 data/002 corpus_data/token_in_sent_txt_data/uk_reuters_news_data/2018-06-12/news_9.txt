analysis-colombia vote worries oil, mining investors
bogota reuters investors in colombia s oil and mining sectors have much at stake in sunday s presidential race with the frontrunner pledging measures to revive production while his leftist rival wants to end reliance on petroleum and coal the country s top exports
leftist candidate gustavo petro a former member of the guerilla group has promised to overhaul oil firm ecopetrol sa the south american nation s biggest company to refocus it on renewable energy
ecopetrol is responsible for about percent of colombia s flagging oil production of around barrels per day and operates export pipeline infrastructure
at current rates of production colombia has just six years worth of oil the energy ministry says and urgent investment in exploration is needed to replace reserves making sunday s vote decisive for its future as an oil exporter
petro has also stirred alarm with promises to let coal mining contracts lapse in colombia the world s coal exporter target a shift towards agricultural production
however the favourite to win sunday s poll ivan duque has diametrically opposed positions pledging to cut taxes and boost colombia s competitiveness in extractive industries
we can t have a policy of destroying productive sectors duque told reuters
we are not yet an oil country
we are a country with potential
we must continue exploration of conventional and offshore oil so that we maintain the foreign currency flows that oil exports bring ecopetrol declined comment but it has said any transition to renewable energy should be orderly
companies are already grappling with security concerns as well as local referendums and environmental court rulings that have stymied major mining projects in latin america s economy
we like duque obviously continental gold inc chief executive ari sussman said during a visit to the company s buritica project which will begin full production in
i do not think petro would be good for colombia because i think everything would freeze sussman said referring to the legislative bottlenecks that the leftist s lack of support in congress could cause
anglogold ashanti ltd suspended a potentially billion billion pounds project last year after the surrounding community voted to ban mining
a recent paper by the colombian petroleum association acp which represents private crude producers warned that planned referendums put of oil production at risk
petro however has voiced strong support for such local community referendums and also wants to ban mining which accounts for almost all colombia s coal and gold production
although petro lies some points behind duque in opinion polls his economic proposals are stirring alarm among some investors
there is unified concern over what petro has proposed economically said analyst sergio guzman of control risks
the chances that it happens are slim but the fear doesn t stop being most companies and trade associations declined to comment for this story
graphic on latin american elections duque s solution to dwindling oil reserves is to encourage investment in exploration which he says could provide years more oil production though his campaign has declined to give precise figures
the acp says the industry needs to spend up to billion a year just to keep output between and bpd
private oil companies plan to invest up to billion this year acp said while ecopetrol plans to spend up to billion
duque has promised tax cuts for the sector combined with investment at ecopetrol s refineries meant to allow exports of more derivatives
duque will bolster foreign investor sentiment into extractive industries analysts molly shutt and mara roberts duque of bmi research said
the former senator has also pledged to improve transport for crude as part of a billion in industrial improvements and bolster security to curb attacks by the leftist eln rebels on ecopetrol s pipelines
bombings have kept the export pipeline which runs from colombia s eastern border with venezuela to the caribbean coast offline since january
the transandino which runs near the southern border with ecuador was also recently halted by attacks
the acp declined to comment on candidates proposals but has warned about the damaging effect of referendums high taxes and pipeline bombings
petro has said he will replace lost commodities income over a decade with agricultural production which he says will provide more jobs
his platform mentions food production but he has not provided further details
his campaign did not respond to questions
despite petro s pledge to aid poor farmers with land reform the agricultural federation which includes coffee growers made a rare presidential endorsement last week backing duque who has promised to modernize the industry incentivising a crop output increase with tax cuts and credits
petro s pledge to buy unproductive land to give away to poor farmers has sparked concern
opponents said the rhetoric reeked of the expropriation practiced by socialist leaders in neighbouring venezuela which is in deep economic and social crisis
petro denies he would expropriate
