opec will squeeze oil buffer to historic lows with an output hike
london reuters the oil industry will face the biggest squeeze on its spare production capacity in more than three decades if opec and its allies agree next week to hike crude output leaving the world more at risk of a price spike from any supply disruption
spare capacity is the extra production oil producing states can bring onstream and sustain at short notice providing global markets with a cushion in the event of natural disaster conflict or any other cause of an unplanned supply outage
that buffer could shrink from more than percent of global demand now to about percent its lowest since at least if the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and other producers decide to increase output when they meet on june bank jefferies said
you would essentially be taking million barrels per day bpd of spare capacity down to approximately million bpd jefferies analyst jason gammel said adding global demand was million bpd
some analysts say spare capacity could even fall below percent after years of low oil prices drove down investment in new production across the industry
saudi arabia opec s de facto leader which has indicated its support for hiking output at next week s meeting in vienna has said it is alert to the potential squeeze on the market
we are concerned about tight spare capacity nowadays saudi energy minister khalid told reuters last month although he also said the industry was in better shape than in when oil prices plunged below a barrel
opec and its allies have been curbing supply since january to boost oil prices and cut bloated global inventories
the price of crude has since surged climbing above a barrel last month while inventories have also fallen

today we no longer have an inventory cushion or a large spare capacity claudio descalzi chief executive of italy s eni said in january
in this context any geopolitical event can create a price oil prices have faced one jolt already this year
a decision to pull out from an international nuclear deal with iran and reimpose sanctions helped prices climb to their highest since
sliding venezuelan output has added to supply concerns

iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters last week that the oil price could jump to if sanctions hurt his oil exports from this country the third biggest producer in opec behind saudi arabia and iraq

martijn rats morgan stanley s global oil strategist said oil prices would be supported if supply and demand is in balance if inventories have drawn significantly and spare capacity isn t all that the precise level of spare capacity available depends in part on how it is defined
the international energy agency iea which bases its figures on oil production that can be brought onstream within days and sustained for an extended period estimates opec s spare production capacity was million bpd in april with saudi arabia accounting for roughly percent
the energy information administration eia which defines it as production that can be brought online for days and sustained for at least days put opec s spare capacity at million bpd in the first quarter
based on the eia definition robert mcnally at consultancy rapidan energy group said saudi arabia russia kuwait and united arab emirates together had spare capacity of about million bpd
so were they to raise by million bpd then million bpd is left scraping the low end of the range historically and uncomfortably tight given the high and rising geopolitical disruption risk mcnally said
graphic opec spare production capacity but opec russia and others have said any increase in output would be made gradually
consultancy energy aspects said gulf opec members would likely add less than million bpd immediately rising to about million bpd in three to six months
energy aspects analyst sam alderson said he expected opec and russia to add about bpd of production in the second half of which would reduce spare capacity as a percentage of demand to about percent by december
graphic actual opec spare capacity png saudi arabia with the bulk of the world s spare capacity has said it would need days to move rigs to drill new wells and raise production to million or million bpd
the kingdom s output in may was about million bpd
but saudi arabia could even boost production beyond its stated output capacity of about million bpd possibly adding another million bpd of what is known as surge capacity
the kingdom did this during wars in the gulf and iraq but the surge in output was only sustained for a few months
