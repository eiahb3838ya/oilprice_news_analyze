interview-omv seeks talks with norway to secure gazprom deal approval
omv agreed deal with gazprom on norway concerned at russian access to its continental shelf austrian group working with gazprom on new europe pipeline adds comments from ceo on gazprom deal iran by kirsti knolle and alexandra vienna june reuters omv will seek talks with norway about the austrian energy group s planned asset swap deal with gazprom in order to address oslo s concerns the chief executive said
in omv agreed to swap percent of its norway assets for percent of the russian company s urengoy gas field
but norway s energy minister terje soeviknes said in may this year he was concerned the deal would give gazprom access to the norwegian continental shelf
we now have to hold discussions and talk to the minister chief executive rainer seele told reuters on tuesday
talks would take place in at the earliest he said in an interview
i do not even want to think about setting up a date during the world cup the german added
omv and gazprom remained committed to the deal he said when asked whether an outright purchase of gazprom s assets as suggested by sources was also an option
should any obstacles arise in the talks with the ministry then we must discuss with gazprom how to deal with it he said
russia is a core region for omv as production is cheap and transport pipelines to austria are in place
omv bought about a quarter of the yuzhno russkoye field one of russia s largest gas fields last year and is one of gazprom s construction partners in the nord stream pipeline
nord stream which will double russia s capacity to pipe gas to europe has been criticised by some in the european union who say it will make the bloc too reliant on russian gas and strengthen gazprom s already dominant position
seele said the pipeline would protect european energy security against possible transatlantic interventions
he also said russia could be relied on to keep gas flowing as it needed the revenue from european importers
as long as russia needs this market we can manage that wonderfully he said
with more than percent of necessary approvals on the route already granted seele said he hoped denmark would give approval for the pipeline to be built near its coast in the summer
regarding omv s work in iran seele said the austrian group planned to conclude seismic studies but would not pursue projects further after the united states withdrew from a nuclear pact with tehran and said it would reimpose sanctions
let s face it you can not simply carry on in iran he said

sanctions are a much bigger risk for omv s business than any possible compensation that europe could the european union signatories to the nuclear pact with iran have said they want to keep the deal in place
omv started operations in iran in as operator of the mehr exploration block in the west of the country
it halted work in due to sanctions but signed several agreements for new projects when the deal was reached
