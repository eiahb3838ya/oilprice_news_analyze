update 1-iran to issue bonds for investment in oil sector - irna
adds background london june reuters iran will issue bonds in the coming months to fund oil projects the head of its securities and exchange organization seo said on tuesday a month after the united states withdrew from a nuclear deal and said it would reimpose unilateral sanctions
it was not immediately clear whether iran would seek foreign buyers for the bonds something which could prove difficult given concerns among western companies that they could be penalised by washington for continuing to work with tehran
the sanctions on iran s petroleum industry will take effect on but many european refiners as well as buyers in asia are already winding down iranian oil purchases
in may french oil major total said it might pull out of its investment in iran s south pars gas field if it can not secure a waiver from the government
the securities and exchange organization seo and the oil ministry have been negotiating for one and a half years over the issuing bonds for oil projects we are hopeful that this would be implemented in a few months the head of seo shapour mohammadi was quoted as saying by state news agency irna
this will help all iranians to participate in investment in oil projects he added
iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh said last month that foreign investment was needed to develop its oil industry but that it could survive if foreigners decided to stay away
