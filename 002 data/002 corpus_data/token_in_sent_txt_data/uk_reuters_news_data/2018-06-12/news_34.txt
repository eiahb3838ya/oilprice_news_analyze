update 2-opec cautious on oil outlook despite end of global glut
london reuters opec said the oil market outlook in the second half of is highly uncertain even though the producer group s figures show a global glut has ended suggesting talks next week on relaxing a supply cut deal won t be straightforward
opec russia and other producers have been cutting output since january to get rid of excess supply and boost prices
the deal s goal was originally to reduce inventories in developed nations to that of the average
in a report on tuesday the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said those inventories in april fell to million barrels below the average
that s down from million barrels above the average in january
with oil hitting a barrel this year the highest since saudi arabia and russia are discussing raising output
but iran disagrees and iraq has voiced restraint pointing to a tough policy meeting on june in vienna
opec in the report was cautious on the outlook for the rest of citing a rise in oil production and the chances of global demand weakening
recent developments in the oil market have led to pronounced uncertainty about the second half of the year opec said in the report
while oil demand in the china and india shows some upside potential downside risks might limit this potential going oil pared an earlier decline after the report was released trading just above a barrel
while the main goal of the supply deal was to reduce oil stocks to the average ministers have said other metrics should be considered also suggesting they are in no hurry to end supply cuts
the report said opec members were still cutting much more than needed even though output in may rose slightly and top exporter saudi arabia is boosting supply
opec output climbed by barrels per day to million bpd opec said according to figures it collects from secondary sources
that is almost bpd less than the amount opec says the world needs from the group this year
figures reported directly by opec members showed some bigger rises in production
saudi arabia told opec its output rose to million bpd up bpd from april although this is still below riyadh s opec target
venezuela whose plunging output due to an economic crisis has helped boost opec compliance with the deal told opec production rose by bpd to million bpd
april s figure was the lowest in decades
strong demand due to a robust economy has helped remove the glut
opec left its global demand growth estimate this year unchanged at million bpd and said oil use would surpass million bpd for the first time during the fourth quarter
but the higher prices that have followed the deal have prompted growth in rival supply and a flood of shale
opec expects supply to expand by million bpd this year about bpd more than expected last month
opec said there is a wide forecast range of million bpd in estimates of the amount of crude the group needs to pump in the second half meaning demand could be significantly more or less than members current output
this outlook for the second half of warrants close monitoring of the factors impacting both world oil demand and supply that will shape the outlook of the oil market going forward opec said
