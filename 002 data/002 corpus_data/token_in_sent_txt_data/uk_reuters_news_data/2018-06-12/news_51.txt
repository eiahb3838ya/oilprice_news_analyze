global markets-stocks, dollar rise as trump says us-north korea summit "really very positive"
updates with fresh levels throughout adds analyst comment msci up pct south korea s kospi reverses losses trade volatile as korea summit gets underway dollar rises to the highest in weeks against yen by swati pandey sydney june reuters the dollar jumped to a top on tuesday and asian shares rose as president donald trump said a summit meeting with north korea s kim jong un had made a lot of progress boosting hopes of a landmark deal to end a nuclear standoff on the korean peninsula
asked by reporters how the historic talks were going trump said a lot of progress really very positive
i think better than anybody could have expected
top of the line very good
we re going now for a he gave no further details
kim had earlier said the meeting was a good prelude to peace just months after the two leaders traded insults and tensions spiralled in the region over the reclusive regime s nuclear programmes
yet there was some unease among investors about the outcome of the talks given the tense relations between the two nations
the combatants of the korean war are technically still at war as the conflict in which millions of people died was concluded only with a truce
the dollar rose against the yen while the korean won gained percent to edge above a recent trough
for the s p were barely changed
in asian equity markets trading was volatile with japan s nikkei paring early gains to add percent after earlier rising as much as percent
msci s broadest index of shares outside japan seesawed between positive and negative territory and was last up percent
south korean shares reversed losses to inched percent higher while chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red with the jumping percent
the key question is whether this summit will lead to a lasting materially positive outcome analysts at ocbc said in a note
from an international relations perspective this appears unlikely
what is perhaps more likely is a positive opening act in a long drawn drama they said
expect a positive risk environment to persist if the summit can conclude without many analysts said the bar was pretty low for what will be deemed a successful summit given the past failures in talks with north korea
so today we have the opportunity for a historic meeting a possible end to the korean war and a possible move to denuclearise and maybe even demilitarize the korean peninsula said robert carnell chief economist at ing
all of that s great but how can you make money from it
well the short answer is you probably shouldn t even carnell said that a far bigger existential global threat was the ongoing tariff dispute after trump upset the group of seven s efforts to show a united front choosing to back out of a previous joint communique
the action drew criticism from germany and france and trump called canadian prime minister justin trudeau very dishonest and however markets are generally shrugging off the trainwreck said ray attrill head of forex strategy at national australia bank
instead they are looking ahead to a busy week
tuesday s north korea summit will be followed by policy meetings of the federal reserve and the european central bank as well as a brexit bill vote in the british parliament
the dollar was well bid on tuesday with the dollar index up percent against a basket of major currencies
the federal reserve is virtually guaranteed to raise interest rates this week while investors are focused on the monetary policy outlook
on the safe haven yen the dollar jumped to a top of in early deals
it was last at
helping calm markets were comments from italy s new coalition government that it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt
the euro stepped back from a high of to be last down percent at
in commodities crude was rose cents to per barrel while brent dipped cents to
