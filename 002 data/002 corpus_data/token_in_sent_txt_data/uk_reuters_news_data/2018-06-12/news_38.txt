aramco pumps around million bpd of crude oil
our strategy is very simple
we want to be at to million barrels per day of participated refining capacity and we are going forward by trying to be a top leader in chemicals by judaimi said
the market that we want to grow in has to be growing a strong market with good demand and of course these assets have to be integrated to the whole value chain of the downstream he said in an interview at aramco s headquarters in dhahran
to help it reach these targets aramco has entered a percent joint venture with three indian refiners to build a billion refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities on india s west coast
aramco has said it may introduce a strategic partner to share its percent stake in the indian refining venture
judaimi said aramco was working with abu dhabi national oil co adnoc toward securing a partnership
it would be the first time for the two national oil companies to join hands in an international venture
we are now finalizing the mou with adnoc that would cover certain commercial principles between us he said adding that the memorandum of understanding would be finalised this year
he said engineering for the project could start by early
apart from india aramco is also taking a percent stake in petronas huge rapid project in the southern malaysian state of johor

asia has to have the lion s share we believe markets east of the suez canal will continue to grow including the middle east as well judaimi said adding that the united states is another market we want to grow in

it s a smart refinery with higher conversion of liquids into chemicals he said declining to give details
aramco has been integrating its refining with petrochemicals to help the company expand its market share and refined products portfolio
the company is betting on growing demand for fuel in india and southeast asia but also shifting more into petrochemicals in case those consumption forecasts prove too optimistic
in the long term we are thinking of investing more into chemicals he said
we know the world needs chemicals as populations grow they need more plastic he added
one centerpiece of aramco s push into chemicals is a project it is building at home with saudi basic industries corp sabic the world s petrochemicals company
the billion project with sabic is to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly bypassing the refining stage
