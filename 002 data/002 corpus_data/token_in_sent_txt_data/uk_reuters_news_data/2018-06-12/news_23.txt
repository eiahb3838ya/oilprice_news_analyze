skb s application for the nuclear waste repository needed to replace an interim storage facility it is currently using was dealt a blow earlier this year when an environmental court said it was not sure of the proposed plan s safety
the company is working on additional requested research and will submit it by a deadline set by sweden s environment and energy ministry which will in turn rule on the application said skb spokesman simon hoff

we are doing the research needed and will produce what is needed by then he said
