afghanistan's 30-year pipe dream could bring power, industry
kabul april reuters afghanistan is pressing ahead with plans to turn natural gas from an pipeline into economic development with projects ranging from fertilizer plants to power generation but first it needs to start construction
the tapi pipeline named after the countries involved turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan and india was first proposed three decades ago
the problem of crossing afghanistan is a major reason it has not been built
surveying work is finally underway in afghanistan s western province of herat with construction planned to start later in the autumn
obstacles loom however starting with convincing donors to fund afghanistan s percent share of the cost and attracting private investors
they re thinking why a project that has not come into practice will be able to fully function in a few years there is still that resistance that maybe we will not be able to implement on time said afghanistan s acting minister of mines and petroleum nargis nehan in an interview
the taliban militant group has pledged support for tapi but security remains a concern
tapi will transport billion cubic metres of gas a year along an km mile route from turkmenistan s galkynysh the world s gas field to fazilka in northwest india
afghanistan s share billion cubic metres annually would meet a huge need for the country which relies on imported electricity and faces frequent power shortages
the asian development bank adb which is financing afghanistan s contribution to tapi s cost and the world bank are conducting for kabul a feasibility study into generating electricity from the gas and using it to supply fertilizer and petrochemical plants said samuel tumiwa the adb s country director
a gas distribution system in herat afghanistan s city could also pipe gas directly to homes for heating and generate electricity for plants to process juice and nuts he said
this opens up the possibility of herat as an industrial city tumiwa said
the priority of afghanistan s power utility da afghanistan breshna sherkat dabs is producing power and it is examining where it should build a power plant to convert tapi gas said the utility s chief executive officer aman ghalib
afghanistan could access additional gas from turkmenistan during the early years of tapi s operation until the pipeline extends to pakistan and india ghalib said
tapi is expected to start carrying gas by although the adb s tumiwa said a later start was more realistic
to utilize the gas additional infrastructure from gas mains to feeder lines and compression stations may be needed tumiwa said
those costs plus afghanistan s share of capital would likely come from international donors since the international monetary fund restricts borrowing
the country also expects to collect at least million in annual transit fees
kabul hopes to attract private investment possibly including foreign fertilizer companies nehan said
unlike other projects in afghanistan tapi will immediately generate revenue and gas when it starts operating she said
this is a project where we see a very immediate return
from investment perspective i think it is better that we focus on such reporting by rod nickel and rupam jain editing by robert birsel
