buhari remarks on young nigerians' work ethic stirs social media storm
lagos reuters president muhammadu buhari has drawn criticism from social media and the opposition alike for saying many young nigerians think they need do nothing to enjoy free homes hospitals and schooling because they live in an country
buhari who said last week he will run for a second term in elections next february made the comments in london where he is attending a commonwealth heads of government meeting
more than percent of the population is below the age of he told a business forum on wednesday
a lot of them haven t been to school and they are claiming that nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing healthcare education this went down badly with the very people the will need if he is to remain leader of africa s top oil producer
the median age in the nation of around million people is just according to the united nations
his remarks prompted the ironic hashtag lazynigerianyouths on twitter even though buhari a former general who was also a military ruler in the did not use the word lazy
young nigerians cited examples of their industry and fortitude in a nation where most people live on less than a day public services are poor and corruption is rife
imagine living and surviving in a country that has no plan for you and constantly tries to make life hard yet we survive and try to break through
we are not lazynigerianyouths wrote twitter user umehoma
others used another hashtag lazynigeranpvc in reference to the permanent voter card pvc used to cast a ballot linking buhari s comments to next year s election
dear lazynigerianyouths is around the corner let us get our lazynigerianpvc so that we can show him our laziness said one twitter user called blessmhe
buhari has promised to fix the economy and reduce nigeria s dependence on oil but it fell into recession in largely due to low crude prices
growth returned last year but remains sluggish and four out of every people in the workforce are unemployed or underemployed
the opposition people s democratic party pdp described buhari s comments as false derogatory and unpatriotic
most disheartening is that these are the same young persons who form the highest demography of voters that put their confidence in him in it said in a statement
the pdp which was in power in has not selected a presidential candidate
buhari himself still requires his party s endorsement although many see this as a formality
atiku abubakar a former vice president and erstwhile buhari ally said he backed the young
i will never refer to nigeria s youth as people who sit and do nothing
they are hardworking abubakar who left the president s party in november and rejoined the pdp said in a tweet
abubakar who has declared his readiness to run for president in also said their entrepreneurial spirit work ethic and creative abilities are things of pride and should be applauded
bashir ahmad a presidential aide tweeted that buhari had always applauded and celebrated nigerian youths who excel in different areas of endeavour from sports to academia and other realms
