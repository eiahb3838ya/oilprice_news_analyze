explainer-plans to end cocoa deforestation face multiple hurdles
duekoue ivory coast reuters faced with the prospect of losing all its forests ivory coast has partnered with chocolate makers to try to halt the spread of cocoa plantations in protected national parks and reserves
ivory coast the world s biggest cocoa producer and major chocolate companies from mars to hershey to barry callebaut pledged last year to eliminate the production and sourcing of cocoa from protected forests
stamping out deforestation in the cocoa supply chain is just one of the commitments made by the world s chocolate makers to make the industry more sustainable along with finding ways to end child labor and boost farmers incomes
if deforestation continues unabated ivory coast risks losing all its forest cover by environmental campaigners say see the forest ivory coast report here
the country rapidly disappearing forests are home to western chimpanzees classified as critically endangered since forest elephants and the rare pygmy hippopotamus
yet plans to end deforestation a major threat to the sustainability of the cocoa industry face major hurdles
ivory coast estimates percent its cocoa comes from protected areas providing livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of farmers and their families
ethical certification schemes and ivory coast s laws have failed so far to stop forests being replaced by plantations while farming alternatives are typically difficult and costly to implement on a large scale
ivory coast s forests have been cut down to make way for agricultural products such as cocoa palm oil and rubber for decades since the country s independence from france in
the decimation of its national parks and forests since the turn of the century however has shocked researchers and led to the agreement to end deforestation which was signed at the
climate change conference in november
see the agreement here a study published in the journal tropical conservation science in concluded that of the land in five national parks and forest reserves in ivory coast had been transformed for cocoa production
see the study here in a mighty earth investigation here the director of ivory coast forest reserve protection agency sodefor estimated that percent of the country cocoa came from protected areas
almost half the mont peko national park had been converted to cocoa by data from the environmental campaign group seen by reuters shows
marahoue national park had lost percent of its forest by the same year
one contributing factor was the outbreak of civil war in ivory coast in
the country was split for a decade between a north and south with the forest regions in the west home to several armed groups
many park rangers and forest officials abandoned their posts allowing warlords to move in and parcel off fertile forest land ideal for cocoa production to locals and immigrants alike accelerating the deforestation
despite an end to the war in many of the lucrative fiefdoms carved out by former rebels remain in place
attractive world cocoa prices also encouraged farmers to move deeper into protected forests helping ivory coast consolidate its position as the world s biggest cocoa grower ahead of neighboring ghana
the deforestation agreement was signed by ivory coast and ghana along with trading firms and chocolate makers including ferrero nestle lindt mondelez ritter sport olam cargill
a number of chocolate makers have committed separately to ensuring none of the beans they buy come from deforested areas by
the details of the plan have yet to be worked out but cocoa exporters are pinning hopes on global positioning system gps mapping and relationships with cooperatives producing beans under certified schemes such as the rainforest alliance
the idea is to trace all cocoa back to the farm where it was produced to prevent beans grown illegally in national parks and protected forests getting into the chocolate supply chain
we believe cooperatives are the best driver said lionel soulard africa director for cargill the region s top exporter
it starts with gps mapping the farmers then making sure we can trace where the cocoa comes from and how we can prove it comes from there he told reuters in an interview in ivory coast s main city of abidjan in february
ivory coast s government is due to publish maps on forest cover and land use for different forests along with data on cocoa farmers and communities that depend on the forests by the end of the year
the government has committed to beefing up surveillance of its forest reserves and applying sanctions for any new infringements by the middle of the year at the latest
ivory coast is also coming up with a plan to restore its national forests and develop models for sustainable a model that aims to restore forest cover while also allowing cocoa production to continue in protected areas
it s a lot of work said jean claude koya a specialist on sustainable development for ivory coast s government
some of these forests are so degraded there s nothing we can do but some can still be to halt deforestation ivory coast may be forced to kick out hundreds of thousands of farmers out of forests and find alternative livelihoods for them
to prove the provenance of all cocoa every smallholder s farm would need to be mapped and every cocoa bean tracked from farm to port
but tracing where cocoa comes from is tricky and the supply chain is prone to manipulation
reports by mighty earth and others have shown that cocoa farmed in national parks still ends being sold by cooperatives to large cocoa traders
certification schemes such as rainforest alliance are meant to ensure cocoa sold under the brand has not come from illegal farming in protected forests but sustainability experts acknowledge the schemes are not foolproof
in duekoue a town in west ivory coast surrounded by cocoa farms and thick bush members of three cooperatives told reuters that it was common for beans grown in protected forests to be mixed with cocoa from farms considered sustainable
there are weaknesses in the system
companies may think they re buying certified cocoa but there s some going on edward millard rainforest alliance director for africa and south asia told reuters
you do the best you can but there are risks in any system of attempts by the government to crack down on illegal cocoa farming since a second civil war in defused the country s political crisis have also foundered partly because of inertia and corruption
in the past ivorian authorities tended to respond to encroachment on protected areas by sending agents to forcibly remove farmers and destroy their crops
park authorities evicted thousands of illegal cocoa farmers from mont peko in destroying cocoa trees and settlements
but no alternative livelihoods were on offer and many cocoa farmers returned afterwards
see the story here farmers interviewed by reuters in the scio reserve said agents from sodefor often came to remove them from the forest but always ended up accepting bribes instead to let them stay
ivory coast s minister of water and forests donwahi declined a reuters interview
a ministry spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions
cargill s head of cocoa sustainability taco terheijden thinks kicking farmers out of forests is undesirable unless alternative livelihoods can be found
if hundreds of thousands of farmers are to be expelled i would not want to be responsible for a social disaster he said
if we expel them out of their own source of cocoa we need to make sure there s an alternative last year the ivorian government began drafting plans to legalize cocoa plantations in some forests and reserves creating protected agroforests where new trees are planted while farmers continue to grow cocoa
under this model trees are threaded through crops helping shade cocoa plants while also doing less harm to biodiversity and keeping the soil fertile for longer
this strategy could help ivory coast curb deforestation without evicting farmers or slashing cocoa output which provides more than half the country s export revenue
but ivory coast s aim to roll out on million hectares of protected reserves is likely to prove costly and neither the government nor the cocoa industry have yet committed to footing the bill
rolling out in million hectares wow that s expensive said etelle higonnet of conservation watchdog mighty earth referring to the amount of land devoted to cocoa in west africa as a whole
you can t ask farmers to foot the bill
the companies have to stump up
