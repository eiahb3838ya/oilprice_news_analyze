analysis-european utilities retrench as cross-border deals lose appeal
reuters european utility companies are retrenching in their home markets and looking to unwind mergers deals as increasingly nationalist governments balk at foreign ownership of strategic power supplies
hungary was one of the first european countries to turn against foreign ownership of utilities back in but there are growing signs that borders are springing up again in an industry that has struggled to make international deals pay off
several european utilities were lining up to buy german utility rwe s subsidiary innogy but in march rwe and domestic rival agreed to carve up the renewable energy firm themselves in an deal
then this week french electricity retailer direct energie the biggest independent challenger to market leader edf went to french energy giant total in another deal
in a business as sovereign and strategic as utilities it is hard to see major deals materializing in today s europe said a banker in paris who has worked on mergers and acquisitions m a in the utilities sector
bankers say the german deal hammered out within two months was partly aimed at keeping innogy s prized assets out of foreign hands and the backlash against foreign owners is now fuelling speculation some big deals may be unwound
edf s italian energy subsidiary edison the power producer in italy is seen as a prime example of a legacy investment ripe for unwinding
edison s oil and gas activities no longer fit edf s strategy and its prospects of winning retail market share from enel in which the italian state has a percent stake look limited
the italians have never accepted that edison is no longer italian said the paris banker adding that the firm s growth outlook in italy would always be constrained by its french ownership
sources told reuters this month that edison had selected banks to sell its oil and gas exploration and production division joining other utility firms that have sold off hydrocarbon assets as they grapple with sluggish energy demand low wholesale prices and a surge in cleaner renewable energy
spain s endesa is another asset owned by a foreign utility seen as a potential candidate for resale
italy s enel europe s biggest utility outbid for endesa in during a spate of european utility mergers
while enel which owns percent of endesa has denied it has plans to sell its control has drawn criticism from spanish politicians who say endesa is not investing enough locally and pays too much in dividends to its owners
enel chief executive francesco starace acknowledged nationalism was having an impact on utilities m a in europe
there is some but i don t think europe s big countries can afford to be nationalistic because they would need really deep pockets to keep these companies off their markets he told reuters
edison and edf declined to comment
the spate of utility takeovers before and just after the financial crisis came as countries joined the european union in its biggest enlargement and european power companies saw a chance to become regional power giants
spent billion euros billion on foreign assets after losing the battle for endesa rwe bought britain s npower edf bought edison and british energy france s engie bought britain s international power spain s iberdrola bought scottish power and sweden s vattenfall bought dutch nuon energy
but the collapse in wholesale power prices since has undermined many of these deals
engie and vattenfall alone have written a combined billion euros at least off the value of their international acquisitions
now not much of the deal euphoria is left
with nationalists in power in hungary poland and austria and parties on the rise in other large european countries utilities are feeling a backlash against the internationalization they embraced a decade earlier
this is still a very national business said a senior banker who worked on the innogy deal
the most difficult situations in a big transaction are those that involve players from different while potential foreign ownership had not become a political issue ahead of the innogy deal german politicians publicly opposed attempts by china state grid corp to buy a stake in german grid operator from australian fund ifm
a source familiar with the situation told reuters that german officials had encouraged belgium s elia the leading shareholding in to increase its stake rather than let state grid buy it
the first moves against international ownership of utilities came in hungary where populist prime minister viktor orban said in the state would seek to buy back hungarian assets of rwe edf engie and italy s eni
since then orban has imposed sharp cuts in energy prices making mostly firms foot the bill and several foreign utilities have sold their operations to the state
in poland edf and engie felt the sting of nationalist energy policies in when the ruling law and justice party put assets owned by french utilities on a list of firms deemed important for energy security to block their potential sale
edf which had been in talks with czech firm eph and ifm about selling its assets in poland was ultimately forced to sell to polish firms
has there ever been a big m a deal in the utility world
i would have to think very hard to find an answer said an m a banker based in frankfurt who has worked on german and european sector deals
