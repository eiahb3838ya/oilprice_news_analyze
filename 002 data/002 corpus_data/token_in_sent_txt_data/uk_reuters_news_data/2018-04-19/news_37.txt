angolans laugh a little louder as iron grip loosens
luanda reuters a front page complains that the city traffic lights do not work audiences laugh a little louder at risky political gags and a policeman admits mistakes were made
after decades of iron rule in angola there are signs of a softer touch
for sure institutions from public media to the courts remain weak and the state almost but president joão lourenço appears to be easing the grip held by his predecessor jose eduardo dos santos who governed for years including nearly three decades of civil war
since taking over last september lourenço has promised to revive an economy battered by lower oil prices and tackle corruption
he also said he would nurture civil liberties
greater transparency in what was one of africa s most secretive states could help restore investor confidence in the continent s second largest crude producer
lourenço is already being tested
on a recent saturday in a poor and polluted corner of luanda around men took to the streets waving placards and chanting for the removal of a local government chief
just months ago this would have been unthinkable
now with the new government there is a certain margin a certain liberty and we are using that to make ourselves heard said denilson alexandre a accountancy student
state news organisations covered the demonstration without labelling protesters dangerous delinquents
national papers increasingly write about the lack of medication in hospitals or functioning traffic lights in luanda
state television and radio invite guests from opposition parties to discuss policy
in a recent radio debate callers lambasted a police commander as he repeatedly apologised for the tactics of the past and guaranteed the force was working to correct errors
we want our public media to actually serve the public and not the government social communications minister joão melo told reuters
for melo the opening is not just right it is also vital for the ruling mpla party to regain relevance and reverse haemorrhaging support
the party may have governed angola uninterruptedly since independence from portugal in but since regular elections were introduced in its share of the vote has tumbled from percent to percent though the opposition contests those results
so far lourenço s popularity has soared
isabel dos santos the daughter of the former president has been sacked as chair of the state oil company sonangol and her jose filomeno dos santos has been charged for attempted fraud
but critics wonder if openness will continue if criticism mounts or once lourenço secures the party presidency a position still held by dos santos
the press is freer but there s no guarantee it will stay this way said teixeira candido head of angola s journalist union explaining the president still appoints the board of state media organizations
the president also remains seemingly beyond criticism
when his convoy hit a girl in the province of cabinda in november far from causing a scandal local media applauded lourenço for organising her transfer to a private clinic in luanda
adolescent crashes into government caravan read the headline on state news agency angop
minister melo accepts there is still much work to do
he hopes to see state media entirely independent and said the government would seek to change laws such as against insulting public officials used to prosecute journalists and activists
it s all just window dressing said rafael marques an activist and journalist currently on trial for allegedly insulting the former prosecutor general with a story about an illegal land grab
why don t the stories dig into who s to blame for the traffic lights not working or for the hospitals having no medication
why aren t people being sacked he asked
it s not because the journalists aren t intelligent enough i know it s manipulation angolans do however seem to view their government and president with less fear making tiago costa s work as a that little bit easier
i m still making the same political jokes but people are happier to laugh than they were before he said
they ve stopped being at the protest in luanda receding fear is palpable
we will keep pushing for more alexandre said
we ll be back every month until we see change
