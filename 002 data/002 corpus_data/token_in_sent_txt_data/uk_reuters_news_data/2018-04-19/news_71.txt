brazilian state prosecutor opposes total drill plan at mouth of amazon
brasilia reuters the public prosecutor s office in the northern state of amapá recommended on wednesday that brazil s environmental regulator ibama deny french major total a license to drill for oil near the mouth of the amazon
the office said in a statement the company s environmental impact study was insufficient and warned that drilling in the area could result in the destruction of an ecosystem where a coral reef has been found
scientists aboard a greenpeace ship have documented the existence of coral in an area off the northern coast of brazil and total s plans to drill for oil should be banned the environmental organization said on monday
greenpeace said on monday that scientists aboard a ship have established that the reef extends further than previously thought and overlaps the perimeter of two blocks that total plans to explore
total led a group including britain s bp plc and brazilian oil company petrobras in buying five exploration blocks in the foz do amazonas basin in but the discovery of a massive coral reef just kilometers miles from the blocks has thrown environmental approval for drilling by ibama into doubt
as the operator total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses
some geologists say the area could hold up to billion barrels of oil or more than the entire proven reserves in the gulf of mexico
environmentalists said potential oil leaks in the foz do amazonas basin named for its location near the mouth of the amazon river could wreak havoc in the rainforest in brazil s far northern amapá state in addition to harming the reef
