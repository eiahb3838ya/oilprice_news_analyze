update 3-kinder morgan says investment in oil pipeline expansion may be untenable
reuters kinder morgan inc said on wednesday that recent events confirm an investment in the trans mountain pipeline expansion may be untenable and said ottawa s pledge of financial support does not resolve political risk related to british columbia s opposition
the comments come as the british columbia
government pledged to file a legal challenge by to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to stop the c billion billion project which was approved by the federal government in and would nearly triple capacity on the pipeline from alberta to a port
kinder morgan canada a unit of kinder morgan halted most spending on the expansion earlier this month and set a may deadline to decide if it would scrap the project entirely citing legal and jurisdictional issues
as we said then it s become clear this particular investment may be untenable for a private party to undertake
the events of the last days have confirmed those views chief executive steven kean said on a conference call
while canadian prime minister justin trudeau has said canada is prepared to offer financial aid to ensure the project goes ahead kean dodged a question about whether that support would ensure construction
they re really two separate things he said
most of the investment is in british columbia where the government is in opposition to the project that is an issue that in our view needs to be the trans mountain expansion is considered crucial for alberta s oil industry which has been beset by transportation bottlenecks
it is fiercely opposed by some
cities some aboriginal groups and environmentalists concerned about possible oil spills
the company said while it is not in a position to move on takeovers until the uncertainty around trans mountain is resolved it sees good opportunities in the western canadian midstream space
there are some very capable players with good midstream assets kean said adding intent is and was that kml would be the vehicle to invest in those the company has a strong balance sheet and is well positioned for takeovers especially if cash earmarked for capital projects is freed up said paul bloom investment manager with bloom investment counsel
i think you can expect if the trans mountain pipeline does not go ahead kinder morgan will be bidders for various assets here in canada and probably fairly quickly as well he said
