exclusive-china nears first americas refining capacity as cnpc, petrobras talks mature -sources
rio de janeiro reuters brazil s oil company is nearing a deal in which china national petroleum corp ltd cnpc would invest in an oil refinery in exchange for crude oil two people with knowledge of the talks told reuters potentially giving china its first refining capacity in the americas
petróleo brasileiro sa or petrobras may give the chinese firm stakes in oil fields it operates in the campos basin off the rio de janeiro coast along with the right to use the new comperj refinery the sources added
we are going to have a deal but it is complex
we should have an integrated solution said one of the sources who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private
the second source said talks with the chinese intensified recently and a deal could be only a few weeks away
two other people familiar with the matter said the refinery needed about billion of investment to reach an initial capacity of barrels per day adding that it was not clear if petrobras would foot part of the bill
petrobras declined to comment
cnpc did not respond to a request for comment
the talks highlight rising chinese interest in the brazilian energy sector which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocs as the government lowers barriers to foreigners
chinese state companies have also taken a central role in brazil s electric grid acquiring rights to hydropower dams major transmission lines and the country s largest distributor
the comperj deal would not be the first in which petrobras offered oil to attract chinese funding
in it renewed a billion credit line with china development bank originally opened in that was guaranteed by brazilian oil exports
china has also provided more than billion to venezuela over the past decade under agreements that helped beijing secure energy supplies for its economy
cnpc and petrobras signed a memorandum of understanding last year to reach a strategic partnership in oil exploration and production
cnpc has already partnered with petrobras in the libra field of the santos basin one of the largest discoveries in brazil s prolific oil area
the investment at comperj would help to offset brazil s fuel imports and resolve a headache at the complex where petrobras has little to show for some billion in investments over the past decade
the project was caught up in a corruption probe in recent years and petrobras has booked some billion reais billion in writedowns there linked to overpriced works and services
the company said it wants to finish comperj but preferably without pouring in any more money so it is talking to potential partners
petrobras chief executive pedro parente said last year that cnpc was in talks to invest in the refinery
on thursday petrobras announced plans to sell percent stakes in four of its existing refineries underscoring its willingness to give up a near monopoly on brazilian refining
parente told journalists the comperj project was not included in the plans because it is not yet a productive asset
he said negotiations for a partnership at the comeperj refinery were still underway
separately petrobras awarded a contract last month worth billion reais to china s shandong kerui petroleum equipment co to build a natural gas processing unit at the comperj complex
the privately run kerui group partnered with brazilian engineering company método potencial engenharia sa to build the plant in itaboraí about kilometers miles east of rio
