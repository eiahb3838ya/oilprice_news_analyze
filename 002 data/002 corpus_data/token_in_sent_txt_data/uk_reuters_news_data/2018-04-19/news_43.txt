nigeria plans power tariff overhaul by 2021 to attract investment
london april reuters nigeria plans to overhaul its energy tariff system by to try to attract investment and improve power supply the vice chairman of the country s electricity regulator said
only about half of the million people in africa s most populous country have access to power
the problem has been exacerbated by prices that are capped below what it costs to generate and deliver power
nigeria s ailing power infrastructure which forces businesses and households to run costly fuel generators is often blamed for hobbling growth and is likely to be major issue in campaigning ahead of next february s presidential election
sanusi garba vice chairman of the national electricity regulatory commission nerc told a panel at the developing market associates trade and investment forum in london that nerc had devised a recovery plan that would fix the tariff issue
under the plan by tariffs regular tariffs will reach parity with tariffs garba said
he said increasing tariffs was difficult given the lack of regular power supply and the relatively few paying customers on the system he said there are currently just million customers on the billing platform
the few that are paying are actually paying for others that are not paying he said of the current system
garba said the reset plan would bring in more investors in order to add generation capacity diversify power sources away from the gas that most of the grid relies on now expand the transmission system and crucially add to million customers to the billing platform
he said that while investments were currently stalled the government would soon invite utilities to submit the investments they need so the government can choose the most crucial projects facilitate outside investment and hold those who do get the money accountable for what they do with it
garba said the potential millions of new customers was a tremendous opportunity for those looking to place money in nigeria
