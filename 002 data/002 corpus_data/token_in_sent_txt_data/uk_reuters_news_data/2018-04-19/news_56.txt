china environment ministry warns of 'stalemate' in war on smog
beijing reuters china s war on pollution is at risk of reaching a stalemate with poor weather conditions undermining the country s efforts to reduce smog an environment ministry spokesman said on thursday
air pollution rose by more than a quarter in parts of northern china in march and the region has been hit by another bout of smog in the second half of april which the ministry of ecology and environment mee has blamed on weak air circulation
weather conditions last month in beijing were the worst over the past six years with slow wind little rain and high temperatures but average pollution readings were able to stay at same level as the past five years liu youbin spokesman for the ministry of ecology and environment mee said at a regular press briefing
the air pollution campaign has entered a stage of stalemate as chairman mao described in his famous book on protracted war
the efforts we made have sometimes been offset by unfavourable weather and it will take time for us to slip the leash of weather conditions to win the war he added
china met its air quality targets after forcing major polluters like steel mills and power generators to raise standards and upgrade their technology and it also shut down thousands of smaller enterprises
liu said china shut down as many as and dispersed pollution sources in noting that they were responsible for around percent of total emissions of small particles that lodge in the lungs
but experts have warned that china s campaign is getting even harder with improvements in air quality starting to level off now that relatively straightforward programmes like the desulphurisation of power plant emissions have been completed
while the focus has primarily been on reducing concentrations of experts have also urged the authorities to take action against other hazardous forms of air pollution like ozone which has been on the rise in northern china
the easy actions have been done very well but now there is more that needs to be done said chen songxi an expert in environmental statistics at the guanghua school of management at peking university
motor vehicles in cities have to be curbed so far there has been little action in that regard because it will be very unpopular with drivers he added
