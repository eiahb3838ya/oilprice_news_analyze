lyft to offset emissions from rides with projects combating climate change
san francisco reuters lyft inc is launching a programme on thursday to offset emissions from the million cars that drive for the service by investing in projects to reduce other sources of greenhouse gas the company said
the move comes as lyft and uber technologies inc as well as and startups face scrutiny for clogging city streets and sidewalks worsening traffic
the company will purchase carbon offsets to support projects such as renewable energy and reforestation balancing the carbon impact of every mile driven by a car working for lyft including the miles driven to pick up a passenger
that will be a dollar investment in the first year and the cost will rise as lyft grows
this in a sense puts a tax on ourselves to continue to move toward shared rides and lower emission vehicles said lyft and president john zimmer in an interview
the company declined to provide a precise dollar amount for the programme
lyft drivers completed million rides in accounting for well over a billion miles according to the company
lyft said in a statement it is working with environmental firm which sources carbon reduction projects
lyft will tap its more than billion in venture capital funding to pay for the carbon offsets
zimmer said the project took on a heightened sense of urgency since the environmental protection agency this month moved to ease vehicle emissions standards
initial projects funded by lyft include an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emission from an auto parts factory in michigan by using alternative materials and recycling transformer oil in ohio
it s really important that we know what the projects are that they are real and tangible and that they would not have happened otherwise zimmer said
lyft s effort is the latest example of a silicon valley company working to mitigate some of the harm its services have caused
this week airbnb announced its office of healthy tourism aimed at easing crowding from tourism that has plagued cities such as barcelona and amsterdam a problem exacerbated by airbnb
san francisco s city attorney last year issued subpoenas to lyft and uber for records of driving practices amid concerns the companies had created traffic hazards
zimmer acknowledged traffic is a major issue and said the company also has plans to invest in electric autonomous vehicles and expand its carpooling service
