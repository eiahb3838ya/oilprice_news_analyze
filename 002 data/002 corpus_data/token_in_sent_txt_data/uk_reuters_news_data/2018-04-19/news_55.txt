rpt-interview-gates backs gene technologies in fight to end malaria
repeats wednesday s story with no changes to text by kate kelland health and science correspondent london april reuters technologies that alter mosquitoes dna could prove critical in the fight against malaria bill gates said on wednesday and ethical concerns should not block progress in such research
speaking at the malaria forum conference in london the billionaire microsoft and philanthropist said that while gene editing raises legitimate questions that should not jeopardise exploration of tools such as crispr gene editing and gene drive technologies
i m very energised about the potential of gene drive
it s the kind of breakthrough we need to support gates said
it may prove critical gene drive technologies alter dna and drive genetic changes through multiple generations by overriding normal biological processes
crispr technology enables scientists to find and modify or replace virtually any gene
the techniques are being explored across science from human medicine to and
in mosquitoes that transmit malaria genetic alterations can be used to induce infertility to reduce populations or alter the insects ability to carry and pass on the malaria parasite
the technologies can be extremely powerful but they are also controversial since such genetically engineered organisms released into the environment could have an unknown and irreversible impact on the ecosystem
asked in a interview with reuters about that controversy gates said there were understandable concerns about safety and efficacy that would need to be addressed in research and trials
but he countered malaria itself is quite controversial it kills about kids a year
so we re definitely not on the side of he also noted that at their summit in january leaders of the african union endorsed gene drive research as part of the fight against a disease that continues to kill their people
they spoke out to say that for them getting rid of malaria is worth using innovative science gates said
the world health organization who warned late last year that global progress against malaria had stalled and could be reversed if momentum in the fight to wipe it out was lost
the disease infected around million people in countries in an increase of million cases over the previous year
it killed people about the same number as in with the vast majority of deaths occurring in babies and young children in africa
gates told the forum that his almost years of involvement in global efforts to beat malaria had been both gratifying in terms of progress and tough in terms of suffering he witnessed
he described seeing a child in a hospital in tanzania convulsed with seizures due to cerebral malaria
with the state of science and the wealth of the world that really should be an affront he said
we really shouldn t accept that this disease can gates said that ending malaria for good would take many years and a range of tools both new and old from bednets and mosquito traps to a new vaccine and next generation gene tools
he said he thought it unlikely that creating gene drives in mosquitoes would have a major impact on the wider ecosystem because it would only target a few species and suppress their populations for a period of time
none of these gene technology constructs will actually wipe out the species he said
it will evolve back
after all evolutionary pressures always push dramatically reducing mosquito populations with such technologies could however give a window of opportunity to help limit the human reservoir of disease so that transmission of the disease among people is stopped he said
gates also said genetic information and data gathered in the field and transmitted swiftly to sophisticated surveillance systems is allowing scientists to identify evolving strains of malaria parasites and track drug and pesticide resistance helping them stay one step ahead of the disease
