update 3-as zinke departs, trump says he will name new interior secretary next week
washington reuters
interior secretary ryan zinke who has aggressively sought to roll back environmental protections will be leaving his post at the end of the year president donald trump tweeted on saturday the latest departure from his administration
trump did not give a reason for zinke s departure
however the former navy seal and from montana has faced scrutiny of his use of security details chartered flights and a real estate deal
ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation trump said on twitter
the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next zinke has run the interior department which oversees america s vast public lands since early
he has aggressively pursued trump s agenda to promote oil drilling and coal mining by expanding federal leasing cutting royalty rates and easing land protections despite environmental protests
zinke was among trump s most active cabinet members cutting huge wilderness national monuments in utah to a fraction of their size and proposing offshore oil drilling in the arctic pacific and atlantic
he became a darling of the energy and mining industries and a prime target for conservationists and environmental groups
senate democratic leader chuck schumer welcomed zinke s departure in a tweet ryan zinke was one of the most toxic members of the cabinet in the way he treated our environment our precious public lands and the way he treated the govt like it was his personal honey the swamp cabinet will be a little less foul without him schumer said
jamie williams president of the wilderness society said he expects zinke s deputy and likely successor david bernhardt to continue with the drill everywhere agenda
deputy secretary bernhardt has made it his mission to stifle climate science and silence the public so polluters can profit said williams
unfortunately even with secretary zinke out the interior department remains disturbingly biased in favour of special interests over the health of american communities and the public lands that they critics have questioned zinke s ethics and some of his moves triggered government investigations
in july the interior department s office of inspector general began investigating a montana land deal between a foundation zinke set up and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company halliburton co which has business with the interior department
in late october that investigation was referred to the justice department for a possible criminal investigation according to multiple media reports
the department of justice and the interior department have declined to comment
there are two other investigations of zinke s conduct
interior s watchdog is examining whether the department purposely redrew the boundaries of utah s grand national monument to benefit a state lawmaker who owns adjoining property
it is also probing zinke s decision to block casinos proposed by two connecticut native american tribes
critics allege he made that move overruling his staff s recommendation shortly after he met with lobbyists for mgm resorts international which owns a new casino in the region
zinke has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing
earlier this year interior s inspector general wrapped up two other investigations related to zinke s travel expenses
those probes found that a private flight he took after a meeting with a professional hockey team could have been avoided and that the security detail he took on a family vacation to greece and turkey cost taxpayers
trump who has repeatedly praised zinke said on that he would look at the allegations
zinke s departure makes him the ninth official to leave since trump took office two years ago
other departures have included attorney general jeff sessions and environmental protection agency chief scott pruitt
