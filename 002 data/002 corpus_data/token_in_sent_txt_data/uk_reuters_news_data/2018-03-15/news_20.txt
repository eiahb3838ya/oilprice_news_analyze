shell warns against proposed magellan oil trading arm
new york reuters the trading arm of royal dutch shell plc urged regulators to stick to their ruling denying magellan midstream partners permission to form a marketing affiliate saying the move would undercut other oil shippers
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in november denied a proposal by magellan to create a marketing affiliate to buy sell and ship crude oil on grounds it would essentially be offering pipeline space below cost which is against the law
magellan requested a rehearing on in a filing that rivals have criticized
the companies contend that the request raised broader issues that could jeopardise the existing structure of oil trading on pipelines
most of the top largest pipeline operators have already established their own marketing or trading arms
shell trading co or stusco said in a filing to ferc late on wednesday that it was concerned about the negative impact to the market when affiliated marketing and pipeline companies act in a coordinated fashion because it gives pipeline companies ways to get around rates
shell also asked ferc to hold a generic proceeding instead of a rehearing of magellan s proposal to review marketing and oil trading issues broadly and receive comments from all interested parties
last month airlines for america and the national propane gas association separately asked ferc to prevent unlawful coordination between pipelines and marketing affiliates and promote transparency
