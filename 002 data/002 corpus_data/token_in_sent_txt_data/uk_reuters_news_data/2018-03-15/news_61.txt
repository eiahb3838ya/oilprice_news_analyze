u.s. solar forecast ratcheted down as tariffs weigh
reuters solar energy installations will grow slower than previously expected in the coming years due to the trump administration s tariffs on panel imports and new federal tax laws that will restrict investment in the clean energy source according to a report published on thursday
installations between and will be percent lower than originally forecast gtm research said in the quarterly solar market report it conducts for industry trade group the solar energy industries association
it will be years before solar installations again hit the peak level of gtm said
the market is not expected to return to the gigawatts installed that year at least through
in the united states installed gw of solar and is expected to be similar
the slowdown marks a major shift for the solar industry which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade thanks to government policies that support renewable energy and a sharp fall in the price of the technology
in the market fell percent
the decline was widely anticipated because in developers completed a slew of projects ahead of what was supposed to be an expiration of a key tax credit
ultimately the credit was extended
but in january president donald trump imposed a percent tariff on solar panel imports in a move billed as a way to protect american jobs but which the solar industry said would raise prices and hurt investment
large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the tariffs as panels can account for up to half the cost of their projects
that market is expected to grow this year and in but remain largely flat between and as more projects are procured purely for economic reasons and outside of mandates
when you increase the price for modules they are either going to be pushed out to when the tariff expires or shelved for the time being austin perea senior solar analyst at gtm said in an interview
lower corporate tax rates resulting from the tax overhaul passed by congress last year will also crimp demand for tax equity financing a mechanism by which banks and others invest in solar projects to claim the associated percent tax credits and offset their large tax bills
the tax equity market is a key way solar projects are financed
