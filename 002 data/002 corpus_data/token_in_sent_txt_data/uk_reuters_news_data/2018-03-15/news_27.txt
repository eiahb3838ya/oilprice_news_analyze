trump administration seeks swift action on alaska oil leases
anchorage alaska reuters the trump administration is seeking to sell leases in the arctic national wildlife refuge as quickly as possible drawing fire from opponents of drilling in the sensitive area who are warning against a rushed process
a top department of interior official who traveled to alaska last week promised an imminent start to the leasing process saying he wanted to wrap up environmental studies within a year more quickly than such documents have been completed in the past
the department will move very very quickly on that project david bernhardt deputy secretary said in a speech in anchorage one of several stops he made in an alaska trip that included visits to the north slope and to fairbanks
bernhardt said in the future he wants environmental impact statements to be finished in a year not just for anwr calling the study process as unproductive and just these documents that are written today when they re pages with appendices and everything i can tell you no one on the planet reads he said
but anchorage attorney erik grafe said environmental studies can be especially in alaska because federal law requires consultation with native tribes and public meetings in affected communities many of which are remote
none of that can be rushed and done adequately said grafe of the environmental organization earthjustice
doing this in a year is an extraordinarily fast timeline for a complicated process a rightfully complicated alaska senator dan sullivan a staunch drilling supporter said at an industry conference in houston last week that we re hoping to have a lease sale as early as on the prospect of a process for environmental review drew fire from critics who said it risks the climate and habitat of wildlife and inadequate input from local communities
it s really insulting said bernadette demientieff executive director of the gwich in steering committee which represents the gwich in athabascan people of alaska and canada
you can t open up a place with such little time
what about regulations
what about laws demientieff said the gwich in oppose anwr oil development because it threatens the caribou herd that is central to their diet and culture
we re going to fight them every step of the way she said
grafe represented opponents to the chukchi sea offshore lease sale in which royal dutch shell spent over billion to acquire exploration rights
a sale environmental analysis which took two years to complete was found by federal courts to be too rushed
the bureau of ocean energy management had to produce two separate revisions forcing delays in exploration work
shell ultimately abandoned the program in after failing to find commercial quantities of oil
grafe said history could be repeated with the anwr
if the trump administration takes shortcuts we won t hesitate to go to court he said
