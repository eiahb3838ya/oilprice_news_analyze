but as the government seeks to become more efficient its current spending recurring expenditure on goods and services will average about percent of gross domestic product in down from percent in the plan says
the government would run small fiscal surpluses during the period and gdp growth would average between and percent with higher private sector investment in response to regulatory reforms compensating for slower growth in the energy sector
the projections assume that average oil and gas prices in will be in line with their levels in january when brent oil was trading around a barrel
