feature-none like it hot - warmer winters worry arctic scientists
longyearbyen norway march thomson reuters foundation o n a damp winter s afternoon in february a bus driver taking visitors to the local airport grumbled that this small arctic town halfway between mainland norway and the north pole was the warmest place in the country
his comment followed two days of rain and temperatures in longyearbyen a town of about people even as the mainland was struggling with frigid weather and snow
relatively warm weather inside the arctic circle ought to be highly unusual for february increasingly that is not the case
the arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet something norway s svalbard archipelago where longyearbyen is located is seeing firsthand said kim holmen international director of the norwegian polar institute npi
it has been consecutive months where every month has been above normal temperatures he told the thomson reuters foundation in his office at the university centre in svalbard unis
this type of weather was highly unusual the scientist said gesturing at the rain lashing his office window
now we have it every winter and several times a svalbard s winter temperatures have increased by to degrees celsius to degrees fahrenheit per decade since said ketil isaksen senior scientist for the norwegian meteorological institute met norway
the increased temperatures have brought avalanches thinning sea ice and thawing permafrost
the fjords no longer freeze completely and the glaciers are retreating scientists said
arctic regions are losing land ice and losses from greenland and arctic glaciers are a big contributor to sea level rise globally isaksen said by phone
and while higher temperatures might make it easier to grow food in northern norway researchers have said the appearance of species new to such climes could threaten existing ecosystems
longyearbyen the administrative centre of norway s svalbard archipelago was established little over a century ago as a company town
the decline of mining meant it had to rebrand itself to lure tourists eager to visit the most northerly town in the world that can be reached on a scheduled flight
scientists and students have also been drawn here to research the arctic
despite its harsh climate and lack of social security benefits longyearbyen boasts residents from mainland norway and other countries including ukraine germany thailand and the philippines
that is a legacy of its status although part of norway it is governed by an international treaty signed in that gives citizens and companies from treaty nations the same right of access to and residence in svalbard
homes and buildings are made with wood and built on the permafrost
hanne hvidtfeldt christiansen a danish professor at unis said temperatures in the frozen soil have been slowly increasing
in addition the permafrost s active layer the surface that freezes and thaws each year is increasing by approximately half a centimetre to a centimetre on an annual basis she said
this means the frozen layer is decreasing correspondingly said christiansen who is also president of the international permafrost association
that would require strengthening buildings foundations researchers have said additionally thawing permafrost could release harmful greenhouse gases and cause landslides and subsidence threatening buildings roads and pipelines
in late for instance an unexpected thawing of permafrost caused water to enter the entrance tunnel of the svalbard global seed vault a safehouse here that guards seed samples of the world s food crops
scientists fear that the situation will get worse in the coming decades
a study by met norway s isaksen said that in the scenario svalbard could by see a rise in the annual average temperature from minus to as much as plus and percent more rain
the study was commissioned by the state s construction group statsbygg which starting this year plans to build residential units in svalbard in response to avalanche fears
it is not clear what other adaptation plans the local authorities have the mayor of longyearbyen declined a phone interview with the thomson reuters foundation preferring to speak
meanwhile climate change is being felt across svalbard s ecosystem scientists said
warmer waters are bringing atlantic cod which could threaten native polar cod
and warmer winters mean more rain which freezes on the ground trapping the plants under ice and making it hard for grazing animals to feed
the locals are anxious npi s holmen said
windy nights like last night when houses are shaking used to be cosy
the sort of feeling that we live in the high arctic we know what a storm is like he said
that sort of pride has turned into worry and he said the only way to prepare for the unknown was to keep as many options open as possible
that requires the biodiversity the diversity in people the diversity in economy in technology holmen said
the consequences of a warming arctic would be felt far beyond this tiny settlement he said
the oceans and the atmosphere are connected
so whatever you do wherever you are on the planet influences the arctic and the arctic will undoubtedly also influence you he said
you and i are part of the problem
