bulgaria launches gas hub feasibility study
sofia march reuters bulgaria which has ambitions to transform from a transit country for russian gas to an energy trading centre said it would start a feasibility study on creating a natural gas hub at the black sea port of varna
sofia s plans for the hub are backed by the european commission
they followed the cancellation in of russian gazprom s south stream gas pipeline project which would have shipped russian gas under the black sea via bulgaria to central europe
state gas company bulgartransgaz signed a million levs million contract on thursday with a consortium consult to conduct the feasibility study and complete it by early july the bulgarian energy ministry said in a statement
the european union has also committed to provide euros for the feasibility study
the cancellation of south stream was a blow to bulgaria which relies almost exclusively on russian gas and sofia hopes the balkan gas hub project would keep russian gas flowing through its territory on its way to central europe
european commission vice president maros sefcovic reiterated brussels support for the plan which will help boost gas liquidity and energy security in the southeastern europe
we in the european commission very much support the plans of bulgaria to be transformed from a transit country into a gas trading country sefcovic told reporters at an energy forum in sofia
we want the balkan gas hub to be efficient to be the hub where the gas supplies are coming from different directions but the gas should be traded here should be sold to the partner and shouldn t be just rushed through the territory to other countries he said
at present bulgaria transports about billion cubic metres of russian gas to turkey a year but these shipments may stop in if russia delivers on its plan to complete turkstream pipeline
bulgaria also hopes to attract azeri natural gas as well as lng supplies from greece qatar and elsewhere
the cost of building a hub is estimated at between billion euros billion and billion euros billion
it would use existing and new pipelines in bulgaria as well as interconnector links it is building with romania serbia and turkey and eventually an undersea pipeline from russia
russia has made no commitments to provide gas for bulgaria s hub project and its scope would be limited it if failed to attract any gas from russia
moscow has said it would consider the hub only if it has guarantees that the project would not run counter to eu energy rules
