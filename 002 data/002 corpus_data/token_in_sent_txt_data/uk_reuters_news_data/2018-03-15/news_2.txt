bishop said that australia would very seriously consider any formal invitation to join the grouping a move advocated by indonesian president joko widodo
asked whether the meeting was a direct counter to china s growing interest in the region bishop said australia believed the bloc brought it peace stability and security
we don t see it as having a role to balance the powers in the but rather be at the heart of the engagement collaboration with other countries she told australian broadcasting corp radio ahead of the opening of the summit

it is in our interest to engage all asean members including aung san suu kyi at this summit because it gives us the best chance of influencing outcomes and making our concerns known so these are matters that we would be discussing with the myanmar delegation bishop said

i can use violence against asked about the threat bishop said australia was certainly going to raise our concerns with the cambodian officially the summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the members of asean and australia and countering the threat of islamist militants returning to the region from the middle east
