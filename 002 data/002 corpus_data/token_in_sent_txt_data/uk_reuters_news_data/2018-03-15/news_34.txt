by clyde russell launceston australia march reuters the between fundamentals and sentiment appears to be getting stronger for many commodities as the market tries to reconcile factors such as robust demand numbers from china and increasingly worrying rhetoric and actions from the united states
iron ore steel and copper all performed well on wednesday after chinese data showed real estate investment and industrial output rising at a faster than expected pace
spot iron ore prices in china rose percent to close at a tonne while copper futures gained percent to a tonne
china s real estate investment over the first two months of the year grew percent from the same period a year ago marking the fastest pace since
industrial output in the january to february period gained percent from the same period in beating the market consensus forecast of a rise of percent and coming in well above december s percent growth rate
given that property and industry are among the major consumers of commodities like steel and copper the price gains aren t that surprising as they seem to indicate that china s economy remains in a healthy state and likely to support strength in commodity imports in coming months
indeed china s imports of major commodities were solid in the first two months of the year with customs data last week showing iron ore imports up percent from the january to february period last year crude oil up by percent copper by percent and coal by percent
but despite the strength in china s commodity demand prices have at best meandered so far in with iron ore down percent from the end of to wednesday s close lme copper lower by percent and brent crude oil down by almost percent
while china isn t the sole factor driving commodity prices it s clear that the current positive demand picture isn t enough to spark or even sustain a rally
instead market participants seem once again focused on the mounting risks posed by geopolitics particularly in the form of the agenda of president donald trump
the imposition of a percent tariff on steel imports and percent on aluminium spooked markets far more than the positive china data supported them
trump first announced he planned to impose the tariffs on march and iron ore prices fell percent between march and before recovering slightly on the chinese economic data
china s exports of steel to the united states are a miniscule percent of its total production so in theory the tariffs are inconsequential and should have zero to minimal impact on the country s demand for seaborne iron ore
yet iron ore prices slumped on the news of trump s tariffs not because of the expected immediate impact on demand but rather on the concern that the government is prepared to wage a trade war than runs the risk of sparking the next global recession
the potential for trump s policies to impact other commodities is also looming large with the firing of secretary of state rex tillerson and his planned with replacement with central intelligence agency head mike pompeo raising concerns over the future of iran s crude exports
pompeo is believed to be more aligned to trump s view that the deal between western powers iran over the islamic republic s nuclear programme was bad and needs to be
this raises the chance of the administration the nuclear deal a move that could lead to restrictions on iran s crude exports an eventuality that could tighten the market and raise prices
brent crude futures didn t show much reaction to tillerson s sacking gaining a mere percent on wednesday
but what trump has done for crude oil and for other commodities is put geopolitical risk back on the agenda
while it may not yet have displaced the interplay between supply and demand as the main driver of markets a focus on geopolitics has to be on the radar screen of producers traders investors and buyers
commodity markets with deep and liquid markets such as crude oil and natural gas are more at risk of sharp increases in volatility but even those where futures contracts are limited such as coal iron ore and liquefied natural gas will be affected
