france considers developing mini nuclear reactors, eyes cost
paris reuters the french nuclear industry is considering developing small modular reactors smrs but will have to ensure these miniaturised generators are not only technically feasible but also financially viable executives said
framatome formerly called areva builds the world s largest nuclear reactor model the epr but is now also conducting research into small to reactors with state nuclear agency cea
in france we have always preferred reactors but we need to also consider smaller models said xavier ursat edf s head of new nuclear at an innovation seminar organised by french nuclear industry lobby sfen
sfen says small reactors could be suitable for countries regions or islands that are isolated from the main regional power grids and could also be useful for urban heating networks or seawater desalination
cea head of nuclear energy françois gauché said the agency would study the technical and financial feasibility of smrs in the coming months
he said some organisations notably nuscale by fluor corp had submitted smr models to their nuclear regulators for design approval
philippe knoche chief executive of french nuclear fuel group orano said factory production as opposed to construction for big reactors could lower the cost of smrs making them competitive if manufacturers built dozens
critics say smr economies of scale will be limited because each reactor will need its own control and safety systems
they also point at the danger of spreading radioactive material more widely increasing radiation and security risks
the british government said in december it would provide funding for research into mini nuclear plants
