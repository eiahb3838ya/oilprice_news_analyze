yemen's houthis and saudi arabia in secret talks to end war - sources
saudis in oman talk to houthi both sides seek comprehensive solution to the war proposed first step would be a truce war has led to severe civilian suffering by mohammed ghobari and noah browning march reuters saudi arabia and its adversaries in yemen s armed houthi movement are holding secret talks to try to end a war that has unleashed the world s worst humanitarian crisis diplomats and yemeni political sources said
a coalition is fighting to counter the influence of riyadh s iran an ally of the houthis who deny any help from tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and gulf powers in thrall to the west
speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity two diplomats and two yemeni officials said the houthi spokesman mohammed had been in direct communication with saudi officials in oman on a comprehensive solution to the conflict
there are consultations between the houthis and the saudis without a representative of the internationally recognized government and it is clear that there is a desire of the houthis and the coalition to go toward a comprehensive agreement one diplomat told reuters
neither saudi nor houthi officials provided an official comment
hailing from yemen s zaydi shi ite sect the houthis seized the capital sanaa and drove the internationally recognized government of president mansour hadi into saudi exile
fearing the advance was part of a regional power grab by tehran riyadh and other mostly sunni muslim gulf arab states armed and supported by the united states and britain intervened to restore his rule
the hoped for accord would begin with a truce to pause fighting on nationwide battlefronts and culminate in the signing of a peace deal addressing the political interests of the warring parties the sources added
thousands of air strikes have killed hundreds of yemeni civilians while rocket attacks on saudi arabia have led to hundreds of casualties
coalition forces have made modest territorial gains but appear far from seizing back the capital from seasoned houthi fighters
with no victory in sight and as the war pushes the country towards famine saudi officials including the powerful crown prince and defence minister mohammed bin salman have expressed a desire to wrap up the conflict
diplomats said the dialogue had been going on for about two months and appeared aimed at providing a framework for a resolution to coincide with the arrival of a new envoy to yemen former british diplomat martin griffiths who began his term on sunday
but it was not immediately clear how much progress has been achieved
peace talks between the houthis and the yemeni government were last held in kuwait in august
that round of dialogue and two previous ones in switzerland where there was no saudi presence ended without success
the current talks appear to have bypassed yemen s government whose restoration was the justification for the intervention underlining a series of deepening yemeni squabbles which have hobbled the coalition war effort
two hadi government officials contacted by reuters were unaware of the dialogue and their criticism of the coalition has mounted in recent days accusing them of barring hadi and other officials from returning to the country
hadi has mostly resided in riyadh while areas in yemen suffered a series of deadly attacks by islamic state militants
he last visited in february
