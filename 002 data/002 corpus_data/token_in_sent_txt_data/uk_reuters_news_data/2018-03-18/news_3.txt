suu kyi spoke at length about myanmar troubles - turnbull
sydney reuters myanmar leader aung san suu kyi spoke at length about her country s troubled western state of rakhine at a sydney conference on sunday and appealed to southeast asian neighbours for help australia s prime minister said
we discussed the situation in rakhine state at considerable length today prime minister malcolm turnbull told reporters at the end of a summit of association of southeast asian nations asean and australia much of it held behind closed doors
daw aung san suu kyi addressed the matter comprehensively at some considerable length herself she seeks support from asean and other nations to provide help from a humanitarian and point of view he said using a burmese honorific
suu kyi s spokesman zaw htay was not immediately available for comment on turnbull s comments
turnbull did not tell reporters whether suu kyi gave details of what support she was seeking or whether she spoke specifically about violence against the rohingya however asean s coordinating centre for humanitarian assistance has been providing some aid since october
officials say nearly muslim rohingya have fled myanmar to bangladesh after militant attacks on last year sparked a crackdown led by security forces in rakhine that the united nations and united states have said constitutes ethnic cleansing
the independent investigator on human rights in myanmar yanghee lee said in geneva this month she saw growing evidence to suspect genocide had been committed
myanmar denies the charges and has asked for clear evidence of abuses by security forces
since coming to power in suu kyi who won the nobel peace prize for her struggle for democracy has failed to condemn the violence against the rohingya
australia s attorney general on saturday rejected a private bid by activist lawyers to have suu kyi face charges for crimes against humanity saying she has diplomatic immunity
in response to questions posed by reuters about the lawyers move suu kyi spokesman zaw htay said earlier in the day such pressure was unhelpful in solving the conflict in rakhine which he called the bengali problem using a term to describe the rohingya that suggests they are interlopers from bangladesh
militants from the arakan rohingya salvation army arsa had instigated the violence with attacks on government forces in october and august said zaw htay director general at the state counsellor s office in myanmar s capital naypyitaw
all of this happened because of arsa
the government did nothing he said in response to a question about the legal move
those who are putting pressure like this need to be careful that doesn t become encouraging singaporean prime minister lee hsien loong said it was a complex situation which asean leaders would continue to discuss frankly
it s an issue which is also in the public attention and it s one of those where intense public attention sometimes makes it more difficult to solve he added
suu kyi s attendance at the asean summit hosted by australia despite it not being a member of the bloc drew street protests in sydney on saturday
