mexico leftist says he would try to halt energy auctions if president-elect
mexico city reuters mexico s leftist presidential said on sunday that if he wins the july election he will ask president enrique pena nieto to stop at least two energy auctions scheduled to take place before the new president takes office
andres manuel lopez obrador is a sceptic of pena nieto s energy reform enshrined in and he and his team have delivered fluctuating messages on what they would do if they win
foreign investors and energy companies are paying close attention to what might happen in one of the most important and recently opened energy markets in the americas
there are two official authorised oil auctions in july and september that could be threatened by lopez obrador s comments and the energy ministry wants to squeeze in another before pena nieto leaves office although it has yet to be given the green light
speaking in mexico city on the anniversary of the nationalisation of the country s oil industry lopez obrador also said that within three years of his possible term mexico would stop buying foreign fuel following extensive upgrades of the country s refining sector
his government would also stop selling crude abroad to focus on fuel production he added
i m going to ask pena nieto that he doesn t hand out any more oil blocks neither onshore or shallow waters and that he puts a stop to the privatisation of oil and electricity sectors lopez obrador said
if lopez obrador wins the july vote he would take office on
since the energy reform was enacted mexico has conducted eight oil and gas auctions awarding some contracts covering onshore and offshore acreage
the energy reform ended state oil company pemex s nearly years of monopoly control over the sector and paved the way for the auctions ending a constitutional prohibition on private companies operating fields on their own
lopez obrador who enjoys a poll lead over his rivals also gave a clear indication of what his government s larger energy polices would be
i m committed to having stopped buying foreign fuels by midway through the next term because we re going to rehabilitate the six existing refineries and we will build two big refineries he said
we re not going to sell crude oil abroad
we re going to process all the raw material in our country to lower the price of reporting by ana isabel martinez and david alire garcia editing by lisa shumaker
