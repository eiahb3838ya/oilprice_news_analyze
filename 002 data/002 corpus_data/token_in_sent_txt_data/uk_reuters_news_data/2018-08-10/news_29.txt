iea says calm in oil markets could be short-lived
moscow reuters oil markets have entered a brief period of calm but a storm might be looming later this year when new sanctions are poised to slash supplies of iranian oil the international energy agency said on friday
the recent cooling down of the market with supply tensions easing currently lower prices and lower demand growth might not last the iea which oversees the energy policies of industrialized nations said in a monthly report
oil prices have rallied close to per barrel their highest since on concerns about supply shortages but cooled in recent weeks as libya regained some lost production and washington signaled it could give asian buyers of iranian oil some exemptions from sanctions for next year
however the united states said it was still seeking to force iran s oil customers to stop purchases completely in the long run
iran is opec s producer with output at around million barrels per day bpd or percent of global supply
as oil sanctions against iran take effect perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion the iea said
saudi arabia iran s and a close ally of washington has pledged intervention to prevent any supply shortage
saudi arabia is producing around million bpd and could in theory raise output to above million bpd
but such a move would leave the world with virtually no spare capacity to cushion against possible supply disruptions in producer countries like libya venezuela or nigeria
thus the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today the iea said
besides supply fears oil prices are being supported by healthy demand growth that has repeatedly surprised on the upside in recent years despite a recovery in prices
the iea kept its oil demand growth forecast unchanged at million bpd but raised its forecast by around bpd to million bpd
another factor to consider is that trade tensions might escalate and lead to slower economic growth and in turn lower oil demand the iea said referring to a trade dispute between the united states and china
