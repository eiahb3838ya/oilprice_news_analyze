gulf of mexico oil lease auction to test response to trump-era regulations
new york aug reuters a federal auction of exploration leases in the gulf of mexico next week will test energy companies appetite for acreage after the trump administration left royalty rates for deepwater parcels unchanged bucking an industry call to lower them
the gulf of mexico has faced waning interest in recent years as competition stepped up from other basins globally as well as from onshore shale basins and mexico s waters in the gulf
oil companies had lobbied for lower royalty payments for deepwater acreage because of the projects high cost and long lead time before production can begin
in february the interior department s royalty policy committee had recommended lowering the rates
some companies may have bid on fewer parcels in march s auction waiting to see if the interior department would cut royalties said william turner a senior research analyst at wood mackenzie
in that auction only percent of the million acres million hectares on offer received bids
next week s sale is the first since
interior secretary ryan zinke said in april that he would leave deepwater royalty rates unchanged at percent rather than drop them to the percent rate for parcels
the uncertainty is gone it is off the table said imran khan senior manager at consultants wood mackenzie
the clearer royalty rules may draw companies that held off in march said khan and turner
the auction is likely to draw the largest and smallest gulf of mexico participants companies such royal dutch shell and chevron corp on one end and llog kosmos energy and fieldwood energy on the other they said
if you re a company like chevron or exxon who plays in multiple basins you have to make sure it is competitive with other basins globally said bob fryklund chief upstream strategist at ihs markit
in the march lease sale companies largely stuck close to acreage they already held and did not acquire new territory to explore
we re seeing a little bit of a resurgence in the gulf said fryklund adding that the rig count has climbed to about rigs from in march
the focus is still on evaluating current acreage rather than looking for new prospects
by though ihs expects that pattern to shift slightly with over newfield wildcat wells expected in the side of the gulf
