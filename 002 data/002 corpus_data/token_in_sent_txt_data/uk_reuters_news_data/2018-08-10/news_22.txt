feature-refugees sow crops with kenyan hosts - and reap integration
turkana kenya aug thomson reuters foundation kenyan villager ekeno pedo never considered that golden fields of sorghum or indeed any crop might one day flourish on the outskirts of his village in turkana county
from the time i was a small herdsboy in this community i never imagined the possibility of farming in this area given the tough climate and our nomadic lifestyle said pedo
the fields that have sprung up in this vast and arid scrubland in kenya s northwest are in part due to the hard work of refugees who have come here from neighbouring south sudan ethiopia and uganda in recent decades
turkana is kenya s county and its poorest yet in it donated hectares acres of land for the refugee settlement of about people near pedo s village of kalobeyei
the idea was to develop an agricultural project that would help bring together the new arrivals and locals
residents and refugees alike say it has worked well
apart from seeing our people marry some of the refugees they also guide us a lot when it comes to farming because some of them came from communities that depended on agriculture said nomadic pastoralist jeremiah kazimoto
namuzungu berta a refugee from the democratic republic of congo said it was liberating for refugees to grow their own food and earn an income instead of relying on aid
with this arrangement we now have the freedom to choose what to eat because we can either grow it or buy from the community said berta
the project began as kitchen gardens in but today it includes hectares of sorghum a cereal with large fields subdivided between refugees and the local community which both harvest and earn money from the crop
when the sorghum ripens the farmers sell it to aid agencies which grind it and use it to feed the refugees
i harvested seven bags of sorghum from my piece of land and i sold four of them to the red cross at a premium price of kenyan shillings for a bag said jackson akure sokona a resident from nearby kolioro village
the kitchen gardens and the more recent sorghum crop were part of a million euro million development project for the area funded by the european union emergency trust fund for africa and implemented by the local authorities and the united nation s food and agriculture organization fao
the project which ends in aims to provide refugees with sustainable livelihoods through agriculture while helping them integrate with their host community
it is the first of its kind in kenya officials said
due to prolonged political instability in some neighbouring countries refugees are almost permanent here
so it makes sense to allow them to generate an income alongside the host community said gabriel rugalema from the fao in kenya
when you allow them to mingle and work together they get used to each other he told the thomson reuters foundation
kenya continues to experience an influx of refugees the fao said which reinforces the need to help them become economically and less dependent on aid
local authorities say they also hope to avoid complications encountered in at kakuma camp some kilometres away where the host community felt they did not benefit from the refugees presence
the goal at kalobeyei is for the local community of about people to take over the refugees farms if and when they go home allowing the area to remain productive
food security is one of our priorities and if the refugees can work alongside our communities to produce food locally then we must support such an initiative turkana deputy governor peter emuria lotethiro told the thomson reuters foundation
turkana s low rainfall makes farming here challenging
the area is sorely in need of rainwater harvesting techniques such as sand dams and underground water tanks
in addition its soils and water are saline and struggle to support agriculture which is why most local people keep livestock mainly sheep and goats
but technologies like farming and irrigation have enabled them to use stored rainwater to cultivate crops
we are using proven rainwater harvesting techniques to capitalise on perennial floods in this area whenever it rains said zippy mbati a programme officer at the world food programme
community members who take part in the farming project are trained to plant sorghum using a method in which a sand barrier is built in front of the growing area capturing rainwater and releasing it slowly the fao said
work is underway to expand the area under cultivation the turkana government and the fao are due to set up an irrigation system on a piece of land set aside for farming in kalobeyei said fao field officer michael ngututo
this will give people enough land to produce about metric tonnes of food worth million kenyan shillings ngututo said
meantime refugees who have made this arid part of kenya home said they were glad of the difference the project has made to their lives
as a refugee it is very exciting that i am able to grow and feed my children on fresh vegetables said hellen chebachoge who was relocated here from dadaab refugee camp in northeast kenya earlier this year
i came from a farming community in uganda and so having a kitchen garden makes me feel at reporting by isaiah esipisu
