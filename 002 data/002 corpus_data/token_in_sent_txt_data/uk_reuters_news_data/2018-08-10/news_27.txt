billionaire's huge nigerian oil refinery likely delayed until 2022 - sources
billionaire s production target seen as ambitious government hopes refinery will end need for imports construction problems weather logistics could delay project by julia payne and libby george london aug reuters a huge oil refinery being built in nigeria by africa s richest man is unlikely to start production until two years later than the target date sources with direct knowledge of the matter said
the barrel per day bpd refinery near lagos set to be africa s biggest is expected to boost nigeria s growth and turn the country from an importer of refined products into an exporter transforming global trade patterns
billionaire aliko dangote who built his fortune on cement told reuters last month he hoped to finish building the refinery in and to start production in early
however the sources who have been on the site many times said they do not expect gasoline or diesel output before early and even then many units at the refinery and accompanying petrochemical plant would not be complete
dangote group executive director devakumar edwin who oversees the project described the suggestion that the refinery is unlikely to start production until as the product of someone s wild imagination
percent of engineering has been completed percent of procurement has been we started civil works in july last year and we have scheduled years for mechanical completion he said referring to the point where a plant is ready to be handed over for commissioning
dangote who expects the project to cost billion said in july he has raised more than billion
i ve never seen a refinery of that scale built in two years
it s highly improbable due to the sequence of events that need to happen it can not be safely a source advising the nigerian government said
the sources said a refinery on such a scale would likely need five years to complete and the piling underpinning the plant had only started in the second half of last year and would take some more months to complete
extra piling was needed to support the plant s units in the swampy area causing an unforeseen delay the sources said
analysts also anticipate delays owing to the scale of the project in an area with limited infrastructure
in our forecast we are putting late at the earliest for some gasoline production but it may slip to said gary still executive director of citac a specialist consulting company focused on african downstream energy
fuel shortages are common in nigeria despite the country of million people being africa s biggest oil producer
the existing bpd refining system operates well below capacity due to corruption and lack of investment leaving the state oil firm to import the bulk of its gasoline and gasoil needs paid for with cargoes of crude oil
edwin told reuters last month that more than half the plant s output could be exported after covering domestic needs
the plant will be the world s largest refinery meaning it will have only one crude distillation unit cdu
the government adviser said the cdu would not be ready for commissioning until the third or fourth quarter of at the earliest and that process would take about six months
major pieces of equipment have yet to arrive or are still being constructed overseas
a lack of infrastructure to transport and install oversized equipment and risks from rainy season storms could add unforeseen delays the government adviser said
the refinery project was first announced in as a smaller plant to be finished in
a site move to lekki in lagos state and a currency crisis caused initial delays
the first producing unit of the fertilizer plant at the same site is complete but the pipeline that was supposed to bring its key input natural gas is not finished meaning that the start would also be missed two of the sources said
