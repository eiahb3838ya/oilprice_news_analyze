china to target emission monitoring in steel, coal-fired power in 2018-2020
reuters china will work to improve the monitoring of emissions from heavy industries like steel power generation coke and chemicals in key regions over the coming three years stepping up an campaign to tackle smog
there remain some outstanding problems in environmental monitoring such as repeated data forgery and illicit administrative intervention the ministry of ecology and environment mee said in a statement on friday
china has been trying to crack down on fraudulent data reporting and the misuse and manipulation of monitoring equipment
since issuing new rules last year it has exposed dozens of cases and punished hundreds of officials
however a report to china s parliament in july warned that there were still enforcement gaps and a shortage of monitoring points in some regions
this week the mee castigated officials in the city of linfen in the major province of shanxi province for deliberately interfering with air pollution monitoring stations on nearly occasions in the past year
according to the friday statement china aims to ensure that environmental monitoring data is accurate genuine objective and comprehensive and wants monitoring institutes and staff to be completely independent of local governments by
china already has set up a total of monitoring stations in cities since and plans to install even more equipment to provide a more detailed picture of pollution across the country
it also aims to plug all major polluters into a online monitoring system by the end of the year
eventually it aims to extend the system to all industrial enterprises allowing authorities to detect and treat excess emissions almost immediately
steel mills paper makers heat and power generators chemical producers and urban sewage disposal plants in the yangtze river delta and fenwei plain regions will be the main target of the latest campaign
the mee also plans to randomly select around environmental monitoring institutes across the country every year to check their qualifications and operations
inspections will focus on air pollution monitoring this year water pollution in and remaining issues in
the ministry said it will also urge local authorities to draw up their own regional plans to coordinate with beijing s efforts
