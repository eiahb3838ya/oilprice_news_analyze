union may strike over black employees' share plan at s.africa's sasol -state mediator
johannesburg may reuters south africa s solidarity trade union can go on strike in a dispute with petrochemicals group sasol over its plan to provide a share ownership scheme exclusively to black employees a government mediator has ruled
south africa has a drive to lift black ownership levels across an economy still riddled with racial disparities
the ruling opens the way for white workers to down tools over the issue a new flashpoint in a country riven with labour conflict
solidarity which represents mostly skilled and white workers declared a dispute with the commission for conciliation mediation and arbitration ccma over sasol s plan to exclude white employees from its new share scheme
the commission found in a ruling last week but only made public on monday that there is nothing in law that would prevent it from providing solidarity with a strike certificate needed for workers to down tools over the issue
the two sides are still in talks being mediated by the ccma
solidarity represents about employees at sasol about a fifth of its south african workforce
what we argue is that all employees should be treated the same so that all employees who contributed to the success of the company receive the same amount and treatment deon reyneke deputy general secretary at solidarity told reuters
in a statement sasol said it was confident that the share ownership plan incorporates what we consider to be the most appropriate and best features of black economic empowerment structures in south reporting by ed stoddard editing by gareth jones
