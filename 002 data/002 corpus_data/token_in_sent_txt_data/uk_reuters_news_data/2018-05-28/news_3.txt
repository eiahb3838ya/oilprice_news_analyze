update 2-brazil truckers slow to end strike, despite concessions
sao paulo reuters a nationwide protest by brazilian truckers was slow to unwind on monday even after the demonstrations against diesel price hikes got the government to cave to their demands causing stocks and the currency to slide
brazilian truckers association abcam which says it represents at least independent truck drivers called on members to stand down but warned that unwinding protests would take time
we are working to spread the word of a deal to all the drivers abcam said in a written statement
it is worth remembering that even though we are calling for an end to the blockades not all protesters agree with by monday night most of the country had not returned to any semblance of normality
the truckers protest left south america s biggest city and economic hub sao paulo and hundreds of communities across the country without fuel emptying normally gridlocked roads
hospitals said they were running out of supplies
schools cancelled classes businesses told employees to work from home and virtually every part of the powerhouse agribusiness sector said the damage was massive if not yet quantifiable
in a televised sunday night address president michel temer said he signed three decrees with immediate effect to address the main demands of truck drivers adding that we gave everything they asked one of the decrees cuts the price of diesel at the pump by percent for days another ordered toll operators across the country not to charge for rear axles that are not in use and another mandates the minimum fare paid to truckers for freight
finance minister eduardo guardia said on monday that the measures temer announced will cost billion reais billion pounds of which billion will come from cutting government expenses
the benchmark bovespa stock index dropped percent sliding into negative territory for the first time this year
leading the losses was a nearly percent plunge by petroleo brasileiro sa due to investor concerns about political interference in the oil company fuel pricing policy
brazil s currency also lost about percent on monday against the dollar on concerns about further pressure on the government s gaping fiscal deficit
the market is focused on the fiscal problem with the impact the government s actions will have on public accounts said fernando bergallo head of currency at fb capital
guardia acknowledged that the truckers protests would have a relevant impact on this year s gross domestic product
in the central bank s weekly survey released monday economists polled revised their economic growth forecasts to percent growth in down from a median forecast of percent the week before
in a sign of the uncertainty of how or when the protest may wind down one of the leaders of independent truckers in rio de janeiro vicente reis said that drivers were not happy with what temer offered
we are not satisfied with what was offered nor even with who was negotiating reis said
our goal is no longer just a cut in diesel prices
