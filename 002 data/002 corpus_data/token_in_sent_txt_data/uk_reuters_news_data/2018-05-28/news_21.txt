column-lng starts rally early, and it's mainly (but not only) china: russell
launceston australia reuters the slack period for liquefied natural gas lng in top consumer asia is usually the shoulder season between winter and summer or march to may but this pattern hasn t really repeated this year
the spot price of the fuel in asia has been on a rising trend since the beginning of april and hit per million british thermal units mmbtu at the end of last week
it touched its low for of per mmbtu in the week ended march remained unchanged the next week and then posted gains in six of the seven weeks since
last year the shoulder season low of per mmbtu was first reached in late march and the price drifted in a narrow band until early july when it started climbing from in the week to july
in the low was hit in early april before a mild rally for the northern summer and then another dip in the autumn shoulder season before strong gains in the winter period
what appears to be different so far this year is that while seasonal price fluctuations are still evident the dip was shallower than in previous years and the rally from the low looks sharper so far
spot lng fell percent from its peak of per mmbtu for the winter of to the low in late march while in the slump from winter peak to shoulder season low was percent and it was percent the prior year
so far lng has rallied percent from the low in the space of eight weeks
in eight weeks after reaching the low lng had gained just percent while the increase was percent in
for a graphic showing china lng imports spot price click here what the numbers show is that while seasonality is still in place the price lows aren t as deep as in previous years and the rally from that low appears to be on track to be steeper and higher
the easy explanation for this dynamic is china which has continued to buy lng at a frantic pace this year after the percent jump in imports in to a total of million tonnes making it the world s buyer behind japan
china s lng imports rose percent to million tonnes in the first four months of this year compared to the same period a year earlier according to customs data
this would put it on target for imports of more than million tonnes for the full year but this is likely to be a conservative estimate given lng buying tend to ramp up in the months ahead of the peak winter demand period
but it s not just china that is sucking up more lng with south korea making a bid to reclaim its former place as the world s importer
in the first four months of the year south korea brought in million tonnes of lng up percent from the same period last year according customs data
even top importer japan is buying modestly more lng with imports in the first quarter up percent from the same period in a faster pace of growth than the percent for the whole of
it s not only the top three importers that are showing growth with total global seaborne lng flows rising according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
in the first five months of a total of million tonnes of lng has been discharged a figure that may rise to closer to million by the end of this month as more vessels are unloaded
this would be some million tonnes or almost percent more than the million tonnes discharged in the first five months of last year
the data shows that while china is the standout when it comes to driving lng demand and prices it s not the only show in town
