update 3-lava flow stalls, sparing hawaii geothermal plant from more damage
honolulu reuters a lava flow from hawaii s erupting kilauea volcano that damaged a geothermal power station has stalled as have lava fountains gushing feet meters into the air offering momentary relief to an area under siege for days officials said on monday
even so new blasts from the crater sent ash plumes billowing as high as feet meters into the sky and a new fissure was pumping out lava at a rate of three feet metre per second geologists said
the new fissure sent more lava into the to evacuated leilani estates district in the eastern corner of hawaii s big island
because the lava was spread out over a wide area the frontier of the flow was only moving at about three feet per second carolyn parcheta a geologist with the geological survey said in a video message posted online
lava engulfed the heads of two wells that tap into steam and gas deep in the earth s core at the puna geothermal venture on saturday
its operator ormat technologies inc said it had not been able to assess the damage
residents fear the wells may be explosive
officials have said the power plant is safe but lava has never engulfed a geothermal plant anywhere in the world leaving a measure of uncertainty
the lava flow at pgv stalled on monday hawaii county spokeswoman janet snyder said
ormat said the plant represented about percent of its total generating capacity and that major damage or a shutdown could have an adverse impact on the company s business
authorities have shut down the plant removed gallons litres of flammable liquid and deactivated the wells
at least homes have been destroyed in the southeast corner of big island and about people have been ordered evacuated since kilauea began erupting on may
about acres hectares have been scorched and the eruptions are expected to cut tourism revenues
the sole reported serious injury from the eruption so far came when a man was hit by flying lava
an eruption from the summit s halemaumau crater on monday sent ash almost feet m into the air a national weather service meteorologist said
hawaii county officials later cut the estimated height to feet
magma has drained from kilauea s summit lava lake and flowed around miles km east underground bursting out of about two dozen giant cracks or fissures
