german mail service to deliver british milk floats
frankfurt reuters many britons will have their daily milk delivered by german vans after deutsche post won a contract to deliver electric trucks to doorstep delivery service milk more
electric milk floats as they are known in britain have been a part of daily life for generations with milkmen delivering glass bottles to people s homes every morning
the service has recently regained popularity as public concerns over pollution caused by plastic containers has risen
milk more said the deutsche post streetscooter order aimed to keep milk deliveries quiet and environmentally friendly
but it could face political noise as since britain s vote to leave the european union there has been increased scrutiny of such deals amid concerns that british firms are losing out
some politicians were critical when firm gemalto rather than britain s de la rue recently won the contract to make uk passports
milk more which is owned by german dairy group theo mueller makes more than million deliveries a day to over british households deutsche post said on monday
we wanted to make this unique tradition relevant again to the requirements of today s customers patrick mueller managing director of milk more said in a joint statement
deutsche post developed the streetscooter for its own deliveries after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries
but it has since sought to step up production and sell the vans to other customers
this has fuelled expectation for strategic options for the business which is also benefiting from a regulatory on diesel vehicles
earlier this month deutsche post ceo frank appel said it was too early to say whether the group would float part of streetscooter
