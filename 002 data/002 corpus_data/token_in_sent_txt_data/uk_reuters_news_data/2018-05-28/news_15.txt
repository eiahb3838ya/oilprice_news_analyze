update 1-germany grills daimler boss over extent of vito van emissions fix
reuters germany s transport ministry quizzed daimler chief executive dieter zetsche on monday over how many vans and cars need to be fixed after a regulator said it had found illegal software in one of its models
the luxury carmaker was summoned to a meeting to answer questions about software devices found in vans by germany s kba motor vehicle authority
daimler was last week ordered by kba to recall vito vans fitted with litre diesel engines because it said they breached emissions rules
daimler has said it will appeal against kba s decision to classify the software as illegal and contest its findings in court if necessary although it said it was cooperating fully
german transport minister andreas scheuer said daimler had been given until june to come up with a solution to the vito delivery van s emissions issues following an exchange about highly complex technical questions
at a further meeting in days concrete results will be on the table scheuer added in a statement
asked how the meeting went zetsche told reuters it was a good discussion
we will see each other again in global carmakers are facing a regulatory since volkswagen admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests in
regulators are now focussing on narrowing the gap between pollution levels on the road when compared to exhaust emissions measured during testing
germany s transport ministry said the vito had been equipped with a software device which manipulated the an emissions filtering system which relies on injecting a liquid to help neutralise nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes
some models including the vito use diesel engines supplied by daimler s partner renault
french prosecutors opened a probe into renault in january after the country s consumer watchdog dgccrf found engine software deactivated functions
daimler has previously said mercedes vehicles being scrutinised by kba were fitted with a renault supplied engine which had been used in around vito tourer models in germany
under european rules carmakers rather than suppliers are responsible for the legality of road certification of each model they sell even if engines and software were supplied by third party
daimler and robert bosch which supplies engine management systems are both being investigated by criminal prosecutors in stuttgart
asked whether french prosecutors were being briefed as part of the mercedes probe the stuttgart prosecutor s office said only that it was in touch with foreign authorities
renault declined to comment
daimler said on monday that no diesel engines supplied by renault were used in vehicles sold in the united states where the discovery of illegal software devices carries far higher penalties than in europe
european rules on using software to manage exhaust emissions filtering systems are more lax than in the united states allowing carmakers greater leeway to switch off exhaust filtering systems if engine damage can be reduced as a result
german newspaper bild am sonntag without citing sources said regulators are probing around vito vans and models for possible software that allowed them to emit excess pollution without detection
european carmakers had invested heavily in diesel engines which produce less carbon dioxide but more of other pollutants blamed for causing respiratory disease than petrol engines
however german cities are now entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets to bring air pollution levels in line with european union rules
