germany grills daimler boss over extent of vito van emissions fix
may reuters germany s transport ministry grilled daimler chief executive dieter zetsche on monday over how many vans and cars need to be fixed to meet emissions rules
the luxury carmaker was summoned to a meeting to discuss a regulatory probe of software devices found by germany s kba motor vehicle authority
daimler was last week ordered to recall vito vans fitted with litre engines because they breached emissions regulations
the inquiry follows the volkswagen emissions test cheating scandal
we will have an in depth exchange about highly complex technical questions with the aim of examining how many models are impacted german transport minister andreas scheuer said adding that daimler has been given until june to come up with a solution to resolve the emissions issues on the vito
at a further meeting in days concrete results will be on the table scheuer added in a statement
asked how the meeting went zetsche told reuters it was a good discussion
we will see each other again in germany s transport ministry said the vito had been equipped with a software device which manipulated the scr emissions filtering function leading to higher nitrogen oxide emissions
bild am sonntag without citing sources said regulators are probing around vito vans and models for possible illicit software that allowed the vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection
daimler has said it will appeal against kba s decision to classify the software as illegal and contest kba s findings in court if necessary although it said it was cooperating fully
european carmakers have invested heavily in diesel engines which produce less carbon dioxide but more of other pollutants blamed for causing respiratory disease than petrol engines
german cities are entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels in line with european union rules
