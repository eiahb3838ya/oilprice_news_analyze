new nafta talks aim to clear pathway to toughest issues
mexico city reuters mexico and canada aim to finish reworking less contentious chapters of the nafta trade deal with the united states in new talks beginning on sunday hoping to clear the path for a breakthrough on the toughest issues before upcoming elections
in six months negotiators have ground out progress on the technical details of a revamped north american free trade agreement but made little advance on the most radical demands made by the administration of president donald trump
ranging from demands for major changes to automotive content rules and dispute resolution mechanisms to imposing a clause that could automatically kill nafta after five years the chief stumbling blocks laid by the white house look unlikely to be removed in the latest mexico city round officials say
but if the three negotiating teams manage to iron out remaining differences on areas of broader consensus officials hope the political leaders will turn their attention to brokering a compromise on the trickiest proposals
i think there s going to be major progress on the technical issues and major obstacles on the critical issues bosco de la vega head of mexican farm lobby the national agricultural council said of the talks running until march
once agreement is reached on technical chapters such as enterprises barriers to trade and about percent of the modernized accord would eventually be left over for political leaders to work out de la vega estimated
mexico hopes to build on the previous round of talks in montreal when canada floated what it called creative solutions to the demands
we will address and deepen the discussion on canada s proposals a mexican official told reuters speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter
canada countered demands for a higher auto content requirement with a proposal to include expenses for engineering research and development and other work in the total
under nafta at least percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the region to avoid tariffs
trump wants the threshold raised to percent
you can t have a successful negotiation if there s no change to the rules of origin said the mexican official adding it won t be percent
we re not sure what the number is going to mexico s economy minister ildefonso guajardo has said his negotiating team aims to present a proposal on rules of origin though he has not provided details
any final agreement would need to be reached between trump and auto sector bosses in the united states who oversee the nafta region an industry source close to the process said
rules of origin are due to be discussed during the first three days of this round of talks
the north american auto industry has so far pushed back against trump s demands arguing it would damage competitiveness and regional supply chains
the latest round comes amid between washington and ottawa and growing if cautious optimism in mexico that the trade agreement will remain
talks are running behind schedule and some officials believe the longer they last the less likely it is that trump will dump nafta which he has threatened to do if the overhaul of the accord does not benefit the united states
negotiators had wanted to wrap up talks by march to avoid them being politicized by mexico s july presidential election
but officials have already raised the possibility that they will run past mexico s vote and some say they could continue at a technical level for several months if necessary
a official noted there has never been a hard deadline and among mexicans following the process belief is growing that lobbying efforts by business leaders and politicians to preserve nafta has been gaining traction
nafta will survive because the economy wins out in the end
the bosses of the big firms are making the argument for us said ernesto ruffo a mexican senator from the border state of baja california
that s why we re onto the seventh still a source familiar with canadian government thinking said ottawa had little idea what would happen at the round
canada s chief negotiator steve verheul struck a downbeat tone last week telling a business audience there are large gaps between what we re trying to achieve and what the is trying to but canada would stay in the talks as long as it saw a chance of striking a deal verheul said
heading into the next round we will bring a lot of ideas to the table he said
we will be aiming to try to achieve real progress and we re hoping the will bring a similar additional reporting by sharay angulo in mexico city lesley wroughton in washington and david ljunggren in ottawa editing by daniel wallis
