u.s. northeast carbon market creating jobs, revenue -study
reuters nine states in the northeast have slashed greenhouse gas pollution created thousands of jobs in clean energy and cut consumer power costs using a scheme to slash carbon emissions according to a study released on tuesday
the report on the regional greenhouse gas initiative from consultancy analysis group comes as the trump administration seeks to unwind federal efforts to fight climate change arguing they would kill jobs and stifle growth
the rggi a scheme adopted in has provided its nine members billion in net economic benefits since according to the study
it has generated more than in the renewable energy and efficiency sectors
a is the equivalent of a job for a year
those benefits come in addition to a more than percent cut in emissions of carbon dioxide in the region since the rggi s inception a trend aided by the retirement of aging power plants cheap natural gas and sluggish demand in the wake of the financial crisis
all of the states have benefited from an actual reduction in carbon emissions sue tierney a senior adviser with analysis group said in an interview last week
from a monetary and economic point of view consumers are a bit better a report by the congressional research service last year however said the rggi program s direct impact on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions was arguably negligible in part because the region overall is responsible for just percent of total greenhouse gas emissions
the rggi system which was meant as a model for other states and countries to join or replicate seeks to encourage carbon cuts by requiring industries like power plants to acquire tradable permits to cover their emissions
each year fewer permits are made available by the states creating an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon output
the revenue from the permit sales has amounted to some billion since
the revenue goes to the member states which then invest in programs that support energy efficiency renewable energy and jobs training according to the report
analysis group said the permit costs had led some fossil fuel generators most affected to hike power prices but that the states investments in energy efficiency and renewables had more than compensated for that by reducing consumer demand resulting in an overall decline in costs for electricity
wholesale power prices in new england averaged roughly per megawatt hour in among the highest in the country but still less than half the level in before rggi was adopted according to data from grid operator iso new england
the rggi states include connecticut delaware massachusetts maryland maine new hampshire new york rhode island and vermont
new jersey an original member is seeking to rejoin after withdrawing in
the analysis group s report was funded mainly by progressive and environmentalist foundations including the barr foundation the energy foundation and the merck family fund
