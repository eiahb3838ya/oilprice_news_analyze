update 1-abb shareholders demand rethink on power grids business
zurich reuters abb faces renewed shareholder demands to break up its sprawling business empire and to start by ditching its struggling power grids division
the power and automation company reports figures on thursday with investors braced for another tepid performance from power grids its largest but least profitable division which it decided to keep in
concerned by weak share performance since then investors say abb should simplify operations ranging from industrial plugs and fittings to electric motors for ships and factories
abb is too big it is too complicated and the company would gain significantly by achieving more focus said david samra portfolio manager at artisan partners abb s shareholder with a percent stake
so far we have seen no evidence of an underlying improvement in power grids nor in the company as a whole he told reuters
artisan which describes itself as a investor said that abb should follow rivals siemens and honeywell international in streamlining
siemens floated its medical equipment business as part of its drive to attract investors for businesses outside its core industrial engineering and automation operations
it also separated its wind power operations
honeywell which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats will also divest divisions
in contrast abb insisted in on keeping the power grids business which makes transformers substations and semiconductors to transmit electricity despite pressure from cevian capital its shareholder to spin it off
power grids generated sales of billion in accounting for percent of abb s billion in sales
cevian argued that abb was too complex and projected that separation would produce two companies with a combined share price of swiss francs
chief executive ulrich spiesshofer said in october that abb could reach a franc share price while remaining intact
abb stock has lost percent this year to trade at about francs
the ceo who took charge in september has supervised a more than reorganisation that has yet to pay off with the company hit by a collapse in demand from the oil and gas market
spiesshofer has quit some businesses to improve the power grids division s performance selling cables and exiting the engineering procurement and construction business last year
abb has evolved significantly as we have strengthened and streamlined the business and we are making good progress against our strategic goals a company spokesman said
management and board are fully one investor who asked not to be named said that spiesshofer is under tremendous pressure adding i am quite disappointed in a very strong economy the company is treading water if it does not perform now when will it ever however abb s biggest shareholder investor ab supports the strategy
we believe the key focus for abb is to execute on the transformation of power grids continue to invest for the future and strengthen customer focus and cost efficiency the swedish investor said
fidelity which has abb as a holding in its swiss fund questioned the structure adding that could bring limited growth and struggling profitability
from the outside there are some areas like power grids that don t really fit for many reasons end markets growth drivers or margin profile fund manager andrea fornoni told reuters
i don t think this is something that necessarily needs to be done over the next six months but over time a stronger view should be taken on thursday s results are unlikely to provide much respite with power grids revenues and profitability slipping a reuters poll showed
christer gardell managing partner at cevian has said he was disappointed with abb s performance since the decision
the decision the board made a year and a half ago regarding the structure of abb seems to have been wrong he told swedish newspaper dagens industri this month
abb shares have risen percent since the decision against a percent gain for the stoxx european industrial sector index
we want to see proof that the synergies and the advantage they abb argue are there in keeping the structure intact are materialised in higher growth and profitability than for competitors said john hernander portfolio manager at abb shareholder nordea
