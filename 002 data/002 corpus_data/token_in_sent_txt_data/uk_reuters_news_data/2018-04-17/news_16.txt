trump energy aide catanzaro returns to lobbying
washington april reuters the top white house official on domestic energy issues including biofuels quotas and upending rules on car and power plant emissions is stepping down to return to the lobbying practice he left last year the firm said on tuesday
mike catanzaro became special assistant to president donald trump for domestic energy and environmental policy in february last year a role within the national economic council
catanzaro previously served in the environmental protection agency and in the white house under president george bush
under trump he worked at the white house with george david banks who handled international energy and environmental issues such as the president s plan to leave the paris climate accord
catanzaro joins other officials on economics who have recently left the white house
banks resigned in february because of difficulties getting security clearance
their boss gary cohn who was trump s top economic adviser resigned last month
next week catanzaro will return to cgcn group an advocacy and public relations company where he worked for energy clients who wanted washington to lift a ban on oil exports as crude output exploded thanks to shale drilling
congress killed the ban in late after president barack obama s administration had allowed exports of some light oil
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment on catanzaro s move which was first reported by e e news
cgcn managing partner steve clark said in a statement that catanzaro s experience in the white house will be an invaluable resource for current and future clients and we will make every effort to ensure his work complies with all relevant ethics days after taking office in trump who promised to drain the swamp of washington put restrictions on the types of lobbying that white house aides can accept after they leave government
trump signed an executive order that said his appointees would refrain from lobbying their own agency for five years after leaving although there is no criminal penalty for doing so
