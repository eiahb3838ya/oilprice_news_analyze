rpt-focus-after setbacks, anglo american counting on turnaround for minas-rio mine
repeats to additional customers with no changes to text by alexandra alper and barbara lewis santiago april reuters two leaks in a month a outage and million in fines is not enough to temper anglo american s ambition for its dollar iron ore mine in brazil
purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for billion anglo american was once counting on to produce million tonnes of iron ore by
the mine s strength is its iron ore that commands a premium as the world s biggest commodity consumer china seeks to cut pollution
is anglo american s biggest development project and its bet on the future of iron ore but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in phase
the project has been delayed by brazil s labyrinthine permitting process and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline which will be shut during a three month inspection
renewed focus on environmental standards at mines after leaks at the alunorte refinery and from anglo s pipelines has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes
brazil s federal environmental regulator ibama levied fines against anglo american of million reais million related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the mine
that was in addition to million reais million from the brazilian state of minas gerais on april
ibama said it will need to evaluate a technical report provided by anglo after its pipeline inspection before it can resume operations
ibama did not provide a timeline for that evaluation
anglo american executives are confident a project that has cost more than billion to build will hit that million tonne production target in and expect the mine will soon break even with output expected at only around million tonnes this year
regardless of the leak we expect a cash flow very close to the break even this year anglo american ceo for brazil ruben fernandes told reuters adding he expects the company to get a vital final permit from brazil
some industry veterans see financial woes weighing heavily as anglo continues to pay fixed costs and stops receiving revenue for the expensive mine
this without a doubt is a setback for anglo said roberto castello branco a former senior executive at vale and board member at petrobas of the leak
he added it is also a negative for the brazilian mining industry which may now face tougher scrutiny to operate a mine in a country that has suffered repeated environmental damage from mining
it is a situation in which everyone loses said branco
rival miners have already pulled back production after their own leaks
norway s hydro has halved capacity at its alunorte alumina refinery after a leak while samarco a joint venture between bhp and vale has yet to resume output after a dam collapse in that killed people
recovering anglo s initial investment was complex but not impossible fernandes said
he has not put a figure on lost revenue during the shutdown over next few months telling reuters that the focus is on stable production of million and a half in keeping with the project
then we will know the cost of without the permit to expand would run out of ore at the end of the year
anglo american executives have played down the pipeline leaks saying the spills were not toxic and swiftly contained
we should be ready to apply for the operating license in the third quarter of this year fernandes said
the stakes for brazil are high when it comes to how strict its regulators get on mine safety given the country is to supply the united states as president donald trump s tariff war aims to boost his domestic steel industry
a more robust industry would need more iron ore and brazil is geographically in the right region to supply it having gotten a tariff exemption
if the price stays high it will be a very profitable asset said steve magill head of european value at ubs asset management a top anglo american shareholder
but we have to acknowledge that because of past mistakes the company spent a huge amount on it so the return on the total investment won t be that said anglo has outperformed peers this year in part because of improved efficiency in production of bulk commodities coal and iron ore and strong output from its kumba operations in south africa
for the anglo american s most profitable divisions were coal followed by iron ore and manganese accounting for respectively and percent of ebitda
rbc capital markets analyst tyler broda said the bank continued to see relative upside in anglo american versus peers on a view because it has recovered well from crash cost cutting and improved efficiency
but acquiring permits remains a worry
hennie faul anglo american s global copper unit ceo said each country has its own challenges but the company s balance sheet was to keep developing its brazil assets which also include nickel
we re certainly not trying to get out of brazil faul told reuters in santiago
