interior secretary says won't lower oil, gas offshore royalty rates 'at this time'
washington april reuters interior secretary ryan zinke said on tuesday he will not lower royalty rates for offshore oil and gas lease sales at this time despite a recommendation from an advisory panel to do so
zinke cited the success of president donald trump s energy strategy as a reason for not adhering to the recommendation of his appointed royalty policy committee which in late february advised him to slash the royalty rate for offshore drilling by nearly to percent
right now we can maintain higher royalties from our offshore waters without compromising the record production and record exports our nation is experiencing zinke said
