exclusive-russia's drive to replace western power technology hits snag
moscow reuters russia s drive to build a large turbine to lessen its dependence on western technology has suffered a major after a prototype broke beyond repair two sources familiar with the project told reuters
in the past few years russia has imported the gas turbines required to run modern power stations from firms such as siemens ge and alstom
after western sanctions were imposed on russia over the conflict with ukraine four years ago russian president vladimir putin urged officials to replace imported technology with substitutes in energy software aerospace and medicine
the mishap with the megawatt turbine a capacity large enough to power a sizeable town underlines the technical challenges
testing was underway on a prototype mw turbine at the saturn engineering plant in rybinsk central russia in december last year according to one of the two sources who are both in the energy sector and familiar with the results of the tests
the turbine fell apart said the first source who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject
they tried to repair it in time for march but they did not manage march was the target date for completion of tests on the turbine
putin in power since won a second consecutive term in an election on march
the first source and a second source both said it was not possible to rebuild the prototype turbine and the project would have to start again with new equipment
the turbine broke up said the second source who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media
there s no turbine that s without any equivalents russia should in most cases still be able to buy turbines from western suppliers but and european union sanctions have made it harder to import western power technology under certain circumstances
last year russia clandestinely delivered turbines made by siemens to a power station in crimea which is subject to sanctions and the european union retaliated by imposing extra sanctions on officials and companies involved in the operation
to the domestic turbine programme could hamper the modernisation of power generation if growing tensions with western states result in tighter sanctions since russia s modernisation plan is focused on using gas turbines
the technical hitch also carries a potential political cost putin has publicly trumpeted progress in replacing western technology imports so any failures will jar with the picture of success he has painted
the new turbine is being developed by a consortium of odk a unit of conglomerate rostec that owns the saturn factory where the testing was being conducted russian state technology firm rusnano and state energy firm interrao
in a statement odk said one of the mechanisms of the prototype turbine had malfunctioned
it said that would delay work on the project but could be fixed
it is not fatal for the it said were to be expected since this was a pioneering project for russia
rusnano acknowledged there had been an accident but gave no details
it said it remained committed to the turbine project and expects it will be completed
interrao declined to comment
russia s trade and industry ministry which oversees the sector declined to comment and referred questions to rostec
large capacity gas turbines have been in use around the world for years but their construction is tricky to perfect
because they operate at extremely high speeds and high temperatures they need to be engineered to very precise standards and they use sophisticated electronic control systems to make sure that they operate efficiently
for many years russia made no major investment in developing the technology because it was able to import the turbines or the to produce them
a scheme started in the to develop a turbine produced prototypes but they did not go into production
at a meeting in russia s second city of saint petersburg in may last year chaired by prime minister dmitry medvedev energy minister alexander novak said a mw turbine had been developed and testing should be completed by march
this is the first russian produced powerful machine with domestic manufacture and it will of course help us to completely substitute purchases of foreign equipment of this capacity novak told the meeting
his ministry did not respond to questions on tuesday about the
