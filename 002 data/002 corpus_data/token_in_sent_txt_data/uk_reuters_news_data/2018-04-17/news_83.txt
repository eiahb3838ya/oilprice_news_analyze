china shale gas output to nearly double over 3 years - consultancy
beijing april reuters china s shale gas production will likely reach billion cubic metres bcm in nearly double the level as local oil companies make big progress with drilling technology and cost cutting consultancy wood mackenzie said in a note on tuesday
nearly new wells will come onstream between and at three key projects sinopec s fuling and petrochina s and zhaotong all located in the country s southwest and at a total cost of billion woodmac estimated
the forecast bcm of output in falls short of beijing s goal of bcm which was slashed by more than half from the government s initial target set in
that means the world s gas user will need to keep its imports of liquefied natural gas lng at elevated levels
woodmac has separately forecast china s lng imports will increase by a quarter to nearly million tonnes this year from record highs in
china produced bcm of shale gas last year or percent of its total gas output
china is eager to materialise its shale gas potential to fuel its massive gasification initiative and support rising demand growth said wood mackenzie s tingyun yang
despite estimates that china is home to the world s largest recoverable shale gas resource its shale formations tend to be deeper more fractured and located in densely populated mountainous terrains leading to higher costs and complications in drilling
however state firms have managed to reduce well costs significantly by percent for exploration wells versus and percent for commercial wells versus by deploying local service companies equipment and improving drilling technologies said yang
explorations and joint studies by global majors such as shell bp exxon and total at chinese shale blocks have yielded little success
shell which pledged billions of dollars of investment in china s shale sector pulled out of shale operations in sichuan several years ago
