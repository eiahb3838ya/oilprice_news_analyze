suniva creditor wins u.s. bankruptcy court approval to sell company's assets
reuters a bankruptcy court judge on tuesday granted a request by suniva s biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company s solar manufacturing equipment through a public auction
the development casts fresh uncertainty on the future for suniva the company that fought for and won stiff tariffs on solar panel imports from the administration of president donald trump in january but still has not restarted manufacturing at its factories
the creditor sqn capital management said tuesday s order by bankruptcy judge kevin gross will enable it to attract an investor interested in injecting capital into suniva s idled operations
as of february sqn was owed more than million by suniva court papers show
the outcome we want is for suniva to be producing once again sqn chief executive jeremiah silkowski said in a phone interview following a hearing at the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware in wilmington
through a subsidiary sqn last month asked gross to lift a stay that prevents suniva s creditors from collecting the company s debts while it is in bankruptcy
in its request sqn said it saw no reasonable possibility of a successful reorganization within a reasonable time for suniva and that it and other lenders could no longer fund the company through the bankruptcy process
a public auction for the assets will be held at least days following the judge s order according to court papers
at the hearing judge gross granted sqn relief from the stay and at suniva s request amended the company s financing agreement to allow it to fund operations for the weeks ahead
an attorney for suniva jeremy ryan told the judge that the company was still hoping for a positive outcome to the bankruptcy case
no one is sure exactly what that is ryan said
this case has a lot of twists and suniva officials could not be reached for comment following the hearing
suniva filed for bankruptcy a year ago days before it petitioned the government for trade relief
the norcross company argued it could not compete with the cheap imports that dominate the market
the solar energy industries association the industry s leading trade group fought the tariffs saying they would drive up the cost of solar and lead to thousands of job losses
the group also argued that the tariffs would not be enough to enable suniva to restart operations
