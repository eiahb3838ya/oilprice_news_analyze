by clyde russell launceston australia april reuters the price of seaborne thermal coal in asia may come under pressure as china moves to impose some import restrictions on imports of the polluting fuel
several ports in southern and eastern china have introduced controls on coal imports ranging from bans on unloadings to tightening customs clearances
among ports banning imports is the chuanshon anchorage at ningbo port according to a manager at a coal trading house quoted by reuters on monday while zhoushan near shanghai is restricting the number of vessels allowed to dock
what is not clear yet is just how severe these restrictions are how widespread they will become and how long they will last
what does appear somewhat clearer is that the authorities in beijing wish to restrict growth in coal imports in order to support domestic coal prices and encourage an increase in local production
certainly news of the restrictions boosted domestic prices with benchmark thermal coal futures on the zhengzhou commodity exchange jumping almost percent on monday to close at yuan a tonne
this was the biggest gain since august last year although the price is still well below the highest closing price so far this year which was yuan a tonne reached on
while the authorities don t officially target domestic coal prices it s widely believed in the industry that a range anchored around yuan a tonne is a level that beijing feels provides miners with sufficient revenue while not unduly boosting costs for power generators
it s also currently a price level that makes domestic coal attractive versus seaborne supplies especially once the duties and taxes on imported coal are taken into account
the spot thermal coal price at australia s newcastle port closed at a tonne on monday up a mere percent from friday s close
the price is also down about percent from the peak so far this year of a tonne reached on
it s not unusual for prices to retreat after the peak winter demand period but the risk for the seaborne market is that the restrictions on imports in china actually cuts into demand
imports of all types of coal rose percent to million tonnes in the first three months of compared to the same period last year according to china s preliminary customs data
while not as fast a pace of increase as in the first quarter of it s likely that the authorities would rather see coal imports retreat rather than rise
much will depend on the nature of the restrictions being put in place making it key to track imports to try and calculate if they are dropping more than what may be seasonally expected
and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts suggest april may see a drop in china s coal imports
filtering the data to show cargoes already discharged or awaiting discharge as well as those already en route to a chinese port and expected to unload by the end of the month shows imports are likely to be around million tonnes in april
even if this figure does increase somewhat by the arrival of more cargoes from suppliers such as indonesia it s still likely that april s imports will be below the seaborne imports of million tonnes in march the million in february and the million in january reported by thomson reuters
again a drop in china s imports in the shoulder season between winter and summer won t be too concerning for coal exporters but any sign of a sustained downturn will likely result in prices of export coal coming under pressure
the domestic price of thermal coal normally tracks newcastle prices although a divergence is possible with a notable occurrence being in late when seaborne prices surged as chinese buyers stocked up for winter
it s possible that a event such as the current restrictions on imports could strengthen domestic prices relative to seaborne cargoes
