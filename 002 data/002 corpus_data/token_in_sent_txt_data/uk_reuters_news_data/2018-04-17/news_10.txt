update 7-oil prices rise on crude supply worry, wall street strength
new york reuters oil prices rose on tuesday as support from the possibility of supply disruptions and a strong equities market offset the effects of following last week s rally above highs
brent crude oil futures gained cents to settle at a barrel while crude futures rose cents to settle at
it seems as though the volatility has for the most part dissipated and part of that can be attributed to the lack of escalation in the events over the weekend and we have an s p that s a little bit stronger today said brian larose technical analyst at
the s p and the dow jones industrial average were both up about percent tuesday
over the weekend the united states and allies launched air strikes on syria raising concerns about continued access to regional crude supplies
such concerns compounded existing supply worries related to the possibility of renewed sanctions against iran and falling output in troubled venezuela
brent has risen percent so far this month
it hit a peak last week of the highest since late
the rally upwards was purely on geopolitical risk and if now we haven t had any further stimulus we re seeing prices slip off a bit natixis commodities strategist joel hancock said
still analysts expected uncertainty over the iran nuclear deal to continue to support prices through may the deadline that president donald trump gave to congress and european allies to fix the deal
if washington does not renew sanctions relief iran may have difficulty exporting crude
bullish enthusiasm over the outlook for oil prices however might be contained by an increase in supplies in cushing oklahoma the delivery point for crude futures
we ve seen that front spread in wti swing back into contango today
and that s somewhat of a bearish it implies a continued up trend in cushing crude supply said jim ritterbusch president of ritterbusch and associates
there s not much volatility today as we wait for api and eia data ritterbusch said
the american petroleum institute publishes weekly inventory data later on tuesday while data from the energy information administration eia is due wednesday
if we can move higher tomorrow that would be a constructive sign said larose
we want to see follow through in order to be sure that this is a break out and not a fake out he said
