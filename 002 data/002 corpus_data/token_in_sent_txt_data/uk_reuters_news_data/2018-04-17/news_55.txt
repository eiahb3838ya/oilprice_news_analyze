refile-plastic-eating enzyme holds promise in fighting pollution
refiles this april story to fix affiliation in paragraph
reuters scientists in britain and the united states say they have engineered a enzyme that could in future help in the fight against pollution
the enzyme is able to digest polyethylene terephthalate or pet a form of plastic patented in the and now used in millions of tonnes of plastic bottles
pet plastics can persist for hundreds of years in the environment and currently pollute large areas of land and sea worldwide
researchers from britain s university of portsmouth and the department of energy s national renewable energy laboratory made the discovery while examining the structure of a natural enzyme thought to have evolved in a waste recycling center in japan
finding that this enzyme was helping a bacteria to break down or digest pet plastic the researchers decided to tweak its structure by adding some amino acids said john mcgeehan a professor at portsmouth who the work
this led to a serendipitous change in the enzyme s actions allowing its abilities to work faster
we ve made an improved version of the enzyme better than the natural one already mcgeehan told reuters in an interview
that s really exciting because that means that there s potential to optimize the enzyme even the team whose finding was published on monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal is now working on improving the enzyme further to see if they can make it capable of breaking down pet plastics on an industrial scale
it s well within the possibility that in the coming years we will see an industrially viable process to turn pet and potentially other plastics back into their original building blocks so that they can be sustainably recycled mcgeehan said
independent scientists not directly involved with the research said it was exciting but they cautioned that the enzyme s development as a potential solution for pollution was still at an early stage
enzymes are biodegradable and can be produced in large amounts by microorganisms said oliver jones a expert in analytical chemistry at royal melbourne institute of technology university
there is strong potential to use enzyme technology to help with society s growing waste problem by breaking down some of the most commonly used douglas kell a professor of bioanalytical science at manchester university said further rounds of work should be expected to improve the enzyme yet further
all told this advance brings the goal of sustainably recyclable polymers significantly closer he added
