johannesburg april reuters south african power utility eskom which is battling to recover from a financial and leadership crisis said on tuesday that it was facing coal shortages at seven power stations
eskom supplies around percent of south africa s electricity predominantly by burning coal
the utility has been forced to introduce nationwide electricity cuts in the past decade the latest in denting economic output
no one wants eskom spokesman khulu phasiwe said referring to forced interruptions to power supply
eskom will do everything possible to prevent phasiwe said eskom was redirecting coal supplies from power plants with surpluses to the seven affected plants in mpumalanga province as winter approaches for southern hemisphere countries
eskom has asked the finance ministry for permission to procure more coal and is temporarily using turbines to meet electricity demand
part of the reason for the coal shortages is that tegeta exploration and resources a firm owned by the gupta family has cut supplies to eskom as it seeks insolvency protection phasiwe said
a judicial inquiry into state corruption is investigating whether the guptas used their friendship with ousted president jacob zuma to influence cabinet appointments and win contracts at state firms including eskom
the guptas and zuma have denied any wrongdoing
