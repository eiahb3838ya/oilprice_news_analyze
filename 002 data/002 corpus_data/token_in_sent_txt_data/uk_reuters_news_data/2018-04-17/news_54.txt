we need to invest more because algeria still has a lot of gas eni ceo claudio descalzi told an energy conference in the western algerian city of oran adding that eni was eyeing the opec member s offshore holdings
offshore is very interesting in algeria we are working on it

the italian government which controls eni is keen to turn italy into a southern european gas hub capable of moving african supplies from algeria and libya and future flows from azerbaijan into europe

sonatrach has struggled to attract foreign investment a position that ceo abdelmoumen ould kadour is trying to reverse
one delayed algerian gas field was brought online last year with three more expected to start producing this year lifting annual gas output of billion cubic metres by billion cubic metres

the programme would lead to the production of new gas reserves using existing infrastructure eni said
the renewed collaboration between our companies enshrined in today s agreements allows eni to make a further important step forward in a key country like algeria and to consolidate further our strategic partnership with sonatrach descalzi said in the statement
