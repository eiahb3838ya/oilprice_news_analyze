greenpeace says coral at amazon mouth should bar total oil drilling
rio de janeiro reuters scientists aboard a greenpeace ship have documented the existence of coral in an area off the northern coast of brazil and plans by french major total plans to drill for oil should be banned the environmental organization said on monday
greenpeace said that a coral reef near the mouth of the amazon extends further than previously thought and its findings would be published soon by the scientific journal frontiers in marine science
the research could further complicate plans by oil companies to explore an area that some geologists say could hold up to billion barrels of petroleum or more than the entire proven reserves in the gulf of mexico
now that we know that the amazon coral overlaps the perimeter of total s two blocks the brazilian government has no choice but to deny the license for the company to explore for oil in the region greenpeace said in a statement
total led a group including britain s bp plc and brazilian oil company petrobras in buying five exploration blocks in the foz do amazonas basin in but the discovery of a massive coral reef just kilometers miles from the blocks has thrown environmental approval for drilling into doubt
as the operator total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses
representatives for total did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the greenpeace statement
brazil s environmental regulator ibama has repeatedly refused to accept total s environmental impact study
last august ibama warned that it needed more information or it would suspend the french oil firm s license application
environmentalists said potential oil leaks in the foz do amazonas basin named for its location near the mouth of the amazon river could wreak havoc in the rainforest in brazil s far northern amap√° state in addition to harming the reef
