column-world economy at risk from proliferating restrictions on trade and investment: kemp
london reuters trade and investment restrictions are proliferating around the world driven by a combination of security concerns and protectionist pressures
in each instance policymakers can usually cite a justification of why trade and investment restrictions are necessary
but taken together a thickening web of restrictions on transactions is imposing a growing burden on business as well as complicating supply chains
the united states and china have threatened to hit each other with tariffs covering up to billion of bilateral trade in a dispute over intellectual property and technology transfers
the united states has already imposed and countervailing duties on imports of steel aluminium and solar panels from china citing concerns about unfair trade
china has responded with its own duties on imported sorghum from the united states and is investigating other products
officials have raised security concerns about telecommunications switch gear from chinese firm huawei and sought to exclude it from the united states market
the united states has also suspended export licences linked to chinese telecoms company zte while britain has warned companies not to install any more zte equipment on the country s network
zte is accused of violating secondary sanctions on the supply of equipment to iran and north korea but there are also broader concerns about its equipment being used for spying and
the government has pledged to restrict chinese investment and acquisitions in sensitive sectors
the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius has already been applying heightened scrutiny to transactions involving chinese firms
in turn china s antitrust authorities have started to slow down merger approvals involving western companies operating in the chinese market
the united states has also hit russian companies and individuals with multiple rounds of sanctions in a dispute over ukraine
in many cases the united states has imposed secondary sanctions which apply extraterritorially and aim to catch businesses for transactions that occur wholly outside the country
the european union has implemented its own sanctions on russia though it has generally refrained from extraterritorial application
the united states and the eu are both readying further sanctions on iran in response to its ballistic missile programme and regional activities
the united states the eu china and other nations are enforcing sanctions on north korea including secondary sanctions for activities
the united states also appears to be preparing sanctions on venezuela
enthusiasm for sanctions is spreading with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates imposing an economic boycott on qatar including a secondary boycott
sanctions represent a relatively way of inflicting economic pain on an adversary and have become the instrument of choice for foreign policymakers the art of sanctions a view from the field nephew
the result is a rapidly growing complex led by the treasury s office of foreign assets control security services and financial regulators in the united states and the european union
the complex also includes a growing army of specialist compliance firms and compliance officers embedded within businesses
in addition to the complex a growing number of regulators and trade authorities show an increasing propensity to favour greater restrictions
the office of the united states trade representative the department of commerce cfius and the departments responsible for antitrust policy all show a rising preference for protection rather than openness
mark
for most of the period since and especially since the end of the soviet union the main thrust has been towards greater openness on trade and investment
the dismantling of trade and investment barriers was embodied by eight rounds of successful trade negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade culminating in the ambitious uruguay round
but the liberalisation thrust has stalled in recent years with the failure to conclude any new multilateral trade agreement for almost a quarter of a century
the mark of globalisation may have passed
now trade and investment barriers are rising rather than falling
liberalisation openness to trade and investment have few defenders within the and european political class
politicians and labour unions blame trade liberalisation for stagnating wages and incomes in the advanced economies
politicians and security hawks fear liberalisation investment and technology transfer is strengthening potential adversaries
sanctions experts financial regulators intelligence agencies and foreign policy specialists all increasingly employ trade and investment restrictions as their policy instrument
traditional mechanisms for resolving trade and investment disputes through the are to handle the new round of restrictions citing national security and foreign policy concerns
complying with the number of restrictions is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses operating across national frontiers and is causing a growing number of distortions
setting aside the question of whether restrictions are justified in individual cases there are broader questions about the economic impact of the proliferating barriers if increasing openness to trade and investment was a major driver of improved efficiency and living standards in the period does its retreat threaten to slow economic growth
can the spreading web of trade and investment restrictions often imposed at short notice be consistent with a and predictable trading system that facilitates transactions
if the global trade and investment regime becomes less predictable will the growth in international trade and investment slow or even go into reverse
sanctions are generally treated as an extension of foreign policy a traditional area reserved for executive authority with minimal legislative and judicial oversight does that raise concerns about due process
policymakers are rapidly embracing trade and investment restrictions for a range of reasons ranging from trying to raise wages to protect strategic sectors and national security concerns
but their enthusiasm for trade and investment barriers arguably threatens the foundations of the international economic system and could end up doing more harm than good
