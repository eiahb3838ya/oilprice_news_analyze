update 3-australia's northern territory lifts fracking ban
sydney reuters australia s northern territory on tuesday lifted a nearly moratorium on fracking to extract gas unlocking vast onshore reserves in the region and raising the possibility of other provinces following suit
the northern territory nt a million sq km sq miles expanse of outback extending from the center of australia to its northern coastline had banned hydraulic fracturing commonly known as fracking in september amid concerns the drilling method could harm the environment
it commissioned an inquiry into the environmental social and economic risks of the extraction process and on tuesday accepted the inquiry s conclusion that the risks were manageable
the moratorium on fracking in the northern territory will be lifted with strict new laws to be in place before exploration or production can occur chief minister michael gunner told reporters in the territory s capital darwin
the announcement which drew criticism from environmentalists reopens shale gas reserves in the beetaloo and mcarthur basins for development
it immediately sent shares in commodity explorers in the region sharply higher even though production is not expected to begin for about a decade
it also raised industry hopes for pushing australia with trillion cubic feet of identified unconventional gas reserves like the united states before it towards energy if blocks on fracking were lifted elsewhere in the country
origin energy ltd said it would resume plans as soon as practical to drill and frack the beetaloo basin shale gas field which it says contains trillion cubic feet in contingent reserves
its shares rose percent
shares of mcarthur basin explorer empire energy group ltd jumped by two thirds and shares in armour energy ltd which also holds exploration acreage in the region rose percent
the broader market edged higher
jemena ltd owned by china state grid corp ltd and singapore power ltd said it now intends to expand the capacity of a gas pipeline linking the territory with the state of queensland sevenfold
given the vast geography we are talking about some significant infrastructure investment will be needed to bring this gas to domestic and international markets said andrew koscharsky director for energy at commodity trading house rcma which deals in australian power and gas

victoria state has outlawed fracking
new south wales and tasmania have introduced moratoriums as has western australia in its canning basin
in south australia a government has promised a ban on fracking in the state s southeast
there s been this cascading effect and so one place has a moratorium then the next place has a moratorium said graeme bethune chief executive of energy quest an energy consultancy
this should cause thoughts by other jurisdictions about moratoria he said
the nt government said it would tightly regulate the industry after lifting the ban
almost half the territory will remain including national parks and reserves
drillers will need to make wells compliant with new design codes and present plans for decommissioning and rehabilitation before production begins it said in a statement
but environmentalists condemned the move
this decision is a betrayal of the science and of the significant community opposition which has been expressed over the last few years said lauren mellor a spokeswoman for environmental group frack free nt alliance
