u.s. to spend $105.5 mln to advance solar technologies
april reuters the department of energy will spend million to fund projects aimed at advancing solar energy technologies and smoothing their integration into the electricity grid it said on tuesday
the funding will be split among four areas of research photovoltaics concentrating solar workforce development and grid integration doe said in a statement
technologies that focus on integrating solar onto the grid like power electronics energy storage and sensors will receive the largest share of the funding at million
late last year doe said the cost of solar energy had hit a government target three years ahead of schedule prompting it to change the focus of its solar program to integrating higher levels of the renewable power source with the grid
the most widely used solar technology photovoltaics will receive up to million
those projects will aim to halve the cost of generating power from the sun s light by to cents per kilowatt hour doe said
concentrating solar power technologies which use the sun s heat to generate power will receive million
csp is far more expensive than photovoltaic solar panels and the united states has only a few such projects
job training and other workforce initiatives will receive up to million doe said
the solar energy industries association the industry s primary trade group in washington cheered doe s announcement calling it a positive step in strengthening this important relationship between the federal government and the american solar seia has been at odds with the trump administration this year over tariffs imposed on imports of solar panels in january
the group argued vehemently against the tariffs saying they would drive up the cost of solar and lead to job losses
awards will range between and million doe said
doe will start receiving applications for funding next month and decisions are expected to be announced in september
