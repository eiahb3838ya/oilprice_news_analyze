abb shareholders demand rethink on power grids business
zurich april reuters abb faces renewed shareholder demands to break up its sprawling business empire starting with ditching its struggling power grids division
the power and automation company reports figures on thursday with investors braced for another tepid performance from power grids its largest but least profitable division that it decided to keep in
concerned by weak share performance since then investors say abb should simplify operations ranging from industrial plugs and fittings to electric motors for ships and factories
abb is too big it is too complicated and the company would gain significantly by achieving more focus said david samra portfolio manager at artisan partners abb s shareholder with a percent stake
so far we have seen no evidence of an underlying improvement in power grids nor in the company as a whole he told reuters
artisan which describes itself as a investor said abb should follow rivals siemens and honeywell international in streamlining
siemens floated its medical equipment business as part of its drive to attract investors for businesses outside its core industrial engineering and automation operations and separated its wind power operations
honeywell which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats will also divest divisions
in contrast abb insisted in on keeping power grids which makes transformers substations and semiconductors to transmit electricity despite pressure from cevian capital its shareholder to spin it off
power grids generated sales of billion in equivalent to percent of the abb s billion in sales
cevian argued abb was too complex and projected separation would produce two companies with a combined share price of swiss francs
chief executive ulrich spiesshofer said in october that abb could reach a franc share price while remaining intact
abb stock has lost percent this year to trade around francs
spiesshofer has quit some businesses to improve power grids performance selling cables and exiting the engineering procurement and construction business last year
abb has evolved significantly as we have strengthened and streamlined the business and we are making good progress against our strategic goals a company spokesman said
management and board are fully sweden s investor ab abb s largest shareholder supports the strategy
we believe the key focus for abb is to execute on the transformation of power grids continue to invest for the future and strengthen customer focus and cost efficiency it said
fidelity whose swiss fund has abb as a holding questioned the structure adding could see limited growth and struggling profitability fund manager andrea fornoni said
from the outside there are some areas like power grids that don t really fit for many reasons end markets growth drivers or margin profile he told reuters
i don t think this is something that necessarily needs to be done over the next six months but over time a stronger view should be taken on thursday s results are unlikely to provide much respite with power grids revenues and profitability slipping a reuters poll shows
christer gardells managing partner at cevian who wanted to split up abb has said he was disappointed with abb s performance since the decision
the decision the board made a year and a half ago regarding the structure of abb seems to have been wrong he told swedish newspaper dagens industri this month
abb shares have risen percent since the decision while the stoxx european industrial sector index has gained percent
we want to see proof that the synergies and the advantage they argue are there in keeping the structure intact are materialised in higher growth and profitability than for competitors said john hernander portfolio manager at abb shareholder nordea
