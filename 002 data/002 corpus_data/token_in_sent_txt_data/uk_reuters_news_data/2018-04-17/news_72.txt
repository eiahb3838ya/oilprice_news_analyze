china cuts smog but health damage already done - study
shanghai reuters while china has made progress cutting smog the damage to the health of millions of people may already have been done especially as the population ages the head of a research agency said
china faces about million premature deaths a year as a result of air pollution the health effects institute hei said in a report based on data going back to published on tuesday
china cut concentrations of hazardous particles known as by percent in cities last year
northern regions also met air quality targets after a winter campaign to cut industrial output coal consumption and traffic
nevertheless deaths could still rise as china ages and overall air quality remains below the country s own standards the study showed
people are living longer and older people are more susceptible to the diseases most closely linked to air pollution the major causes of death in china like stroke heart attack and lung cancer hei president dan greenbaum told reuters in an interview
we have done some projections in china up to and even with improvements in air quality you see the number of deaths going up as the population gets older he added
the number of chinese people over reached million at the end accounting for percent of the population and up million since according to the national bureau of statistics
the china association of social security a research group expects the number to reach million by
as the government prepares a new smog action plan for the next round of measures could prove harder to implement greenbaum said
the pollution itself gets harder to treat and even though china has been making progress it has pretty much leveled off he said
he pointed to the challenge of cleaning up smaller factories that emit particles as well as the need to tackle other pollutants
concentrations of ozone caused in part by urban traffic congestion are rising and experts say china should target it in its new action plan
authorities should also focus on the countryside where indoor pollution caused by direct fuel combustion is responsible for more than a third of total annual deaths the hei study said
inhaling fumes from the indoor burning of coal or biomass for cooking and heating is associated with higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in rural areas
china has provided incentives allowing households to switch to cleaner natural gas and biogas from pigs and cattle
the number of annual deaths related to indoor burning in rural areas has halved since to the study said
however the millions of migrant workers who moved to cities and industrial areas over that period may have replaced one serious health risk with another greenbaum said
average stood at micrograms in china last year but rose to micrograms in the heavy industrial region of according to environment ministry data
china aims to reach an interim national standard of micrograms by around the environment ministry said last year
