column-what saudi arabia does now is key for global crude oil markets: russell
launceston australia reuters if it were possible to boil the crude oil market down to just one determining factor for the coming months it would be this what will saudi arabia actually do
the saudis appear to have emerged as the winners from last week s meeting of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and the subsequent talks between opec and its allies in the deal to restrict output
the outcome of the meetings would seem to indicate that crude oil supply should rise by as much as million barrels per day bpd
that s based on the assumption that opec and allies will return to percent compliance with the november cut of million bpd from a current situation of
however the reality on the ground is that many opec countries lack the ability to pump their full quotas
saudi arabia is the only producer that can ramp out output significantly within a short period of time
the market consensus after the opec meeting in vienna on june and the talks with allies the following day was that the agreements reached wouldn t actually result in an extra million bpd reaching global markets
while there is some debate on the likely increase in supply the upper end of the range is around bpd
the question is whether this would be enough to prevent prices from rallying again
given that the saudi arabia the world s largest crude exporter is going to have to provide the lion s share of any increase in output watching its export numbers and price signals in the coming months will be key
in fact the saudis already are supplying more crude according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
saudi seaborne crude exports were million bpd in may the most in a year the data shows
prior to the november agreement saudi arabia was regularly exporting more than million bpd
but it s also worth noting that only in two months january and february in did the kingdom ship more than million bpd
what this shows is that the saudis definitely have the scope to export more crude but boosting output above million bpd on a sustained basis isn t something they have done in recent years
the saudis are on track to export more than million bpd in june with thomson reuters data estimating seaborne shipments of million bpd
but it s interesting to note that the saudis have been somewhat vague when it comes to saying exactly how much more they will produce
saudi energy minister khalid said after last week s meetings that the kingdom s oil company will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels with precise figures to be decided later
who can and who ca raise crude output within opec there is also some confusion over whether saudi arabia will be permitted in terms of the agreement to its quota to make up for shortfalls from other members such as venezuela and libya currently unable to pump more
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said saudi arabia wouldn t be allowed to pump more on behalf of venezuela meaning the kingdom can increase its production by less than bpd
with no certainty on exactly who can produce what it becomes more important than ever to monitor crude oil flows in coming months and perhaps less important to hang on every word uttered by the various parties to the agreement
another factor often bypassed in the discussion is exports of refined fuels
saudi arabia s exports of gasoline were around bpd in the first four months of this year according to the joint organisations data initiative jodi
that s up by around bpd from last year s average
saudi shipments of gasoil averaged just under bpd in the january to april period about bpd more than for
for all oil products the jodi data show that saudi arabia s exports averaged million bpd in the first four months of up percent from the million bpd recorded in the same period last year
what this shows is that saudi arabia is already boosting exports to global markets but in the form of refined products rather than crude
that brings us back to the burning question for oil markets how much more can or will the saudis add to the global supply of both crude and refined products
there is certainly a risk in relying on the kingdom to virtually balance supply and demand thereby keeping prices in the sweet spot of around a barrel which seems to be high enough to prevent fiscal problems in most producers but low enough to prevent demand destruction
