analysis-all about the gas: australia primed for more m&a
melbourne reuters private equity firms are expected to drive a wave of merger activity in australia s gas sector hunting for bargains amid soaring demand in china rising domestic prices and a broader oil market recovery
the energy sector has dominated australian m a activity over the past months led by a spurned billion bid for oil and gas producer santos and a billion bid for pipeline operator apa group by hong kong s ck infrastructure
still the share prices of smaller companies in the sector have yet to fully reflect the sharp recovery in oil markets over the past year and gains from lower drilling costs say bankers and consultants
private equity firms clearly see strong turnaround opportunities in the oil and gas sector
stocks are trading below their earnings potential with serious upside said deloitte consulting partner bernadette cullinane
firm harbour energy pursued santos for a year before its bid ended in acrimony while private equity fund lone star bid a million million in march for australia s sino gas energy holdings which has stakes in two shale gas projects in china
more deals are seen as small oil and gas companies look to fund new gas developments to feed the east coast market and bigger companies like santos look to replenish their reserves following years of cuts in exploration
most of the market cap companies with reasonable resources and cash flow or near term cashflow would be attractive to private equity funds said eddie rigg head of corporate finance at argonaut who advised a private chinese firm that lost out in a bidding war for gas producer awe ltd in february
such companies include senex energy central petroleum cooper energy and strike energy
rigg predicted sino gas will attract a rival bid from a european or asian group as most of the geological and well engineering risks on its project have been dealt with
it s a reasonably safe entry into a growing gas market he said
australian domestic gas prices have more than doubled in the past three years as east coast supply has been sucked into exports of liquefied natural gas lng to feed demand
china s lng imports driven by a clean air push are expected to jump percent over three years to million tonnes by according to australian government forecasts
for investors australia is handy way to play into that growth
australia s attractiveness as an oil and gas m a and investment proposition is driven primarily by its low geopolitical and sovereign risk and of course its proximity to asia s energy demand centres said deloitte s cullinane
the next likely target is in australia s west
gas supplier quadrant energy potentially worth a billion is attracting interest as one of its two owners canada s brookfield asset management is looking to sell its stake bankers say
quadrant by macquarie group produces more than a fifth of the gas going into the domestic market in the state of western australia has oil production and untapped gas reserves
potential suitors include santos
the appeal for santos is that it knows the quadrant business well as the companies share stakes in a number of gas fields bankers and analysts say although santos may not want to risk alienating shareholders by splashing out on a deal so soon after having rejected a takeover
quadrant s domestic business in western australia is a prized cash cow in santos portfolio
doubling down there makes sense said wood mackenzie analyst saul kavonic
santos brookfield and macquarie declined to comment
graphic australia lng projects and gas basins within the next two years there could be other deals on the west coast where woodside petroleum and chevron corp are looking to develop new gas fields to feed their lng plants
the biggest hurdle to their plans is the myriad of in their gas fields and lng plants all with competing priorities making it difficult to agree on development plans
the best way to overcome that hurdle analysts and bankers say would be for woodside or chevron to buy out some of their partners as woodside did in february with the million purchase of exxonmobil s stake in the scarborough gas field
obviously if an interest owner in a particular part of the value chain no longer desires to participate chevron or other companies are always looking for opportunities to improve their portfolio chevron s exploration and production president stephen green said in a recent group interview
