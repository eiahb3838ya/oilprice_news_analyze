mexico city reuters mexico s leftist presidential andres manuel lopez obrador may allow more oil and gas fields to be auctioned off if elected on july a top adviser said on monday striking a moderate tone days before the election
lopez obrador who has a commanding poll lead ahead of sunday s vote has been a longstanding critic of the energy reform that opened up oil and gas production and exploration to private and foreign investors
however alfonso romo his top business adviser and nominee for chief of staff said lopez obrador was open to permitting more auctions if the process had not been tainted by wrongdoing
lopez obrador has vowed to review outgoing president enrique pena nieto s energy overhaul and threatened to cancel the reform if he found corruption in the awarding of contracts

he said it in new york
andres manuel not alfonso romo a business tycoon reiterated his vote of confidence in the energy sector liberalisation saying he felt very at ease with the oil contracts he had reviewed so far
members of lopez obrador s campaign team have sent out mixed signals on the reform with some arguing mexico should not be giving up its oil to private or foreign interests
romo said that mexico needed to lower energy dependence on the united states and if the private sector could help it do so it should
he also said a lopez obrador government should consider allowing private investment in oil refining
a lopez obrador government would also like to strengthen a very undervalued peso currency by boosting investor confidence and the rule of law romo said
he took pains to stress that a lopez obrador government did not plan to resort to intervention for that purpose
this government s straitjacket will be that we don t want to raise the debt romo said
and we will achieve the peso sank to a low this month hit by a broad dollar rally a deadlock in talks between the united states canada and mexico to rework the north american free trade agreement and some nerves ahead of the election
lopez obrador was in the last two campaigns and has long been the foremost voice in mexico

romo said the process of revising the energy reform and its contracts should ideally be completed by about october
the next president will take office at the start of december
