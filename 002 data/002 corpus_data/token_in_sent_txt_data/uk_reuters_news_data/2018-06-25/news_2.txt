update 4-advent takes over ge distributed power unit for $3.25 bln
new reuters buyout group advent agreed to buy general electric co s distributed power unit for billion billion the companies said on monday marking ge s exit from a growing segment of the power business
ge had put the unit which makes jenbacher and waukesha brand reciprocating gas engines up for sale as part of a plan to exit about billion in industrial assets
ge hopes to book as much as billion in such proceeds this year
the sale expected to close in the fourth quarter highlights the growing demand for reciprocating engines by utilities which pair them with wind and solar generators
because the engines start quickly they can fill in when wind and sun falter and then be shut off when not needed conserving fuel
large power turbines can not start as quickly and so must be kept spinning at partial power even when wind or solar electricity supplies are ample
distributed power is a terrific asset said ranjan sen managing partner at advent international
the business has significant growth potential on a global scale and talented employees all over the advent plans to invest substantially in critical areas such as the product portfolio service network and digitization he said to build up the company s market position
advent prevailed against engine maker cummins in the final stages of the auction
engine makers kohler and wartsila and investor kkr had dropped out earlier people close to the matter said
ge stock slid percent to close at in new york
while the sale was not likely to have much effect on ge s stock it checks the box on another action by ge ceo john flannery said rbc capital markets analyst deane dray
advent s purchase values the unit at about times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization of just below million said a person close to the matter
last year it posted revenue of billion
faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up ge is aggressively cutting costs selling units and strengthening its balance sheet under a new board and managers
selling the industrial gas engine business is expected tohelp streamline ge s power division whose profit plunged last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply
jenbacher and waukesha engines range from kilowatts to megawatts
one of ge s key customers is the german port city of kiel which is using jenbacher engines to create a megawatt plant replacing a plant opened in ge said
the engines will supply heat and electricity to homes and buildings with power supplemented by nearby wind turbines ge said
the last of the jenbachers was delivered in march and the old coal plant is due to shut down next year ge said
finland s wartsila which makes similar engines dropped out of talks for the unit several weeks ago as it did not see enough synergies to allow it to pay the mooted price of as much as billion according to a source with knowledge of the discussions
