update 1-shell, exxon not to seek compensation for end of groningen gas production -govt
amsterdam reuters energy companies royal dutch shell and exxon mobil will not submit a claim for missed revenue due to the dutch government s decision to halt gas production at the groningen field by the dutch ministry of economic affairs said on monday
a lot of gas will be left in the ground economy minister eric wiebes said at the presentation of his deal with the oil majors responsible for extracting groningen gas
that gas is the property of the oil companies but they will not submit a claim and the government is not required to compensate the dutch government in march said it would end gas production at the groningen field by the end of the next decade in an effort to stop a string of relatively small but damaging earthquakes caused by gas extraction
this will leave around billion cubic metres bcm of gas in the ground wiebes said with an estimated value of approximately billion euros billion pounds
the decision to halt groningen production forced the government to broker a new deal with shell and exxon mobil whose joint venture nam is responsible for the field
nam will be required to pump as much gas as the government says is needed in the coming years
in return it will see its share of the revenue from groningen rise from to percent wiebes said starting this year
as part of the deal nam will also contribute a total of million euros to strengthen the economy in the groningen region
