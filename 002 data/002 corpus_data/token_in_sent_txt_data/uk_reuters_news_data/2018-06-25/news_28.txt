global energy players converge on washington as china trade war lurks
reuters the world s biggest oil and gas players are gathering for a summit in washington this week that will be overshadowed by the specter of shifting trade patterns due to a trade dispute between the united states and china
the uncertainty comes at a historic moment for the united states which has become the world s biggest natural gas producer one of the top crude oil producers and a growing exporter of both
it will host the triennial world gas conference for the first time in years
the timing is unfortunate said charlie riedl executive director of the center for lng noting the trade scuffle has ramped up uncertainty just as the next wave of liquefied natural gas producers are trying to finalize offtake deals needed to start construction
beijing this month proposed percent tariffs on petroleum imports a retaliation against president donald trump s tariffs on chinese goods that is expected to dent sales to the shale industry s largest customer adding new pressure for firms that produce natural gas as a byproduct of crude production
while lng imports have so far been spared the industry is concerned that the supercooled gas could be next if china s talks with washington sour something that would disadvantage developers but help rivals also courting china
i don t know that it prevents deals from happening but i think it gives buyers pause riedl said
the conference will draw executives from global energy giants like exxon mobil corp bp plc and total sa along with senior officials from the state department s energy bureau and ministers from energy producers and consumers like argentina and indonesia
it follows last week s opec meetings in vienna where the partner countries agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs
the trump administration is eager to expand its energy dominance agenda by offering more oil coal and lng to europe and other takers as an alternative to supplies from geopolitical rivals like russia while also forging bonds with big players like china
the united states has made some inroads with sales of lng to poland and lithuania but faces a tough task selling large amounts of lng to wider parts of europe especially as russia s gazprom and a consortium of partners advance a new pipeline under the baltic sea to germany
we want to see a global gas market that is prevents countries from using gas for political purposes and drives economic growth across the world frank fannon the top energy diplomat told reuters
rising crude prices have producers drilling for more oil than ever with natural gas produced as a byproduct
while some of that gas is going into power generation offsetting coal power even as trump has promised to bail out struggling nuclear and coal plants there is still more than is needed domestically
that has producers hoping for new export capacity
globally there has been a dearth of major decisions on lng projects since as sagging energy prices and worries over a looming glut left buyers hesitant
but the glut has not materialized and global demand has taken off fanning fears of an lng shortage instead
gas trade rose percent in according to a report by bp with lng demand up more than percent in its best year since
the needle is moving significantly both on the supply and demand side said eric fell an analyst with genscape
that should smooth the path for at the washington conference said industry players and analysts despite the trade dispute with beijing
the asian superpower is not the only buyer in town said gregory vesey chief executive of lng ltd which is developing the magnolia lng project in louisiana
all across europe there are opportunities that are starting to feel very real he said noting european gas prices are up while lng prices have stayed flat
