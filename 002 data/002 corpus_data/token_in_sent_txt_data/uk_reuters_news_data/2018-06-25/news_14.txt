u.s. coal miners worry trump-china trade dispute could hit exports
washington reuters coal mining companies are worried president donald trump s intensifying trade dispute with china could hurt their booming export business one of the ailing sector s most important lifelines according to industry players
beijing this month added coal and other energy products to a list of goods facing import tariffs in retaliation for trump administration levies
the measure has already dampened chinese demand for coal multiple and chinese industry sources said
for instance trade sources said china national building material international one of the biggest metallurgical coal importers in china pulled back from supply talks with coal broker xcoal and miner consol energy shortly after beijing s announcement
a source familiar with the matter said consol had been in talks with china to supply up to million tons per year of metallurgical coal but would not confirm whether the deal would be delayed
officials at xcoal declined to comment
we re obviously watching it closely particularly given what a bright spot exports have been for our industry of late said ashley burke a spokeswoman for the national mining association which represents mining companies
anything that would chip away at the appetite for coal abroad would be of the energy information administration said coal exports to asia doubled from million tons in to million tons in
exports to china totaled million tons in up from zero in and according to the eia
the coal industry s concerns mirror the unease spreading in farm country over unintended consequences of the trump administration s protectionist stance which has roiled foreign market for american crops
the farm and coal industries are critical trump supporters that the president and his republican party are relying on to help them retain control of congress in the elections in november
steve roberts president of the west virginia chamber of commerce said trump s protectionism was a dilemma for his organization which represents a number of companies benefiting from the export trade
because of our small population we export far more than we consume he said
we are concerned about the momentum slowing down we are literally holding our breath to make sure this dispute is part of a bigger picture and the parties see the advantage of trade with each jason bostic vice president of the west virginia coal association said he hoped the dispute would blow over or at least that the trump administration s steel and aluminum tariffs would boost domestic demand for metallurgical coal
demand for met coal is currently about million tons a year and could rise if steel manufacturing increases
we are walking a tight rope he said
the addition of coal to the list of more than items facing higher tariffs from china also came as a shock to chinese steel mills and trading firms
just last month beijing had been encouraging them to buy more coal to narrow the trade gap four sources with knowledge of the plan said
coal operators like pennsylvania s consol had been in talks with chinese buyers and hope those talks revive
we think that coal will be part of the solution with china buying coal to offset the trade deficit said zach smith a spokesman for consol
a number of appalachian operators are banking on it
in a may investor presentation corsa coal said it was aiming for million tons per year of metallurgical coal sales by with percent for export and percent domestic
in its presentation corsa said chinese and indian infrastructure as well as a rising population were positive drivers for coking coal to serve growing demand for steel
corsa coal did not respond to a request for comment
earlier this month bluestone coal owned by the family of west virginia governor jim justice announced it planned to hire workers for two reopened mines and two new metallurgical mines in west virginia
some percent of its coal is marketed for overseas export
a representative for bluestone could not be reached for comment
