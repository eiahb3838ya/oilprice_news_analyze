france's orano, china's cnnc prepare nuclear fuel plant deal
new agreement signed as spring deadline expires france china still can not agree on price most other nuclear nations gave up on reprocessing paris june reuters french nuclear fuel group orano has agreed with china s cnnc to do preparatory work for the sale of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to the chinese company in the latest attempt to seal a deal that has been years in the making
orano said on monday the agreement which runs until the end of and covers work to be carried out by orano to prepare the sale of the recycling plant was confirmed during a visit by french prime minister edouard philippe to china
an orano spokeswoman said the work would cost the french company about million euros million and cover in particular project management and quality control paperwork
she added talks about the plant were continuing with the price being one of the remaining issues to be agreed
negotiations about the tonne capacity plant have been going on for a decade with new agreements signed regularly usually during diplomatic meetings
but so far the two parties have not been able to agree on a price for transferring the technology
following a visit to china by french president emmanuel macron in january finance minister bruno le maire said the deal would be worth billion euros billion and that france had been given assurances a contract would be signed this spring
that deadline passed last week without a contract
ten years ago orano formerly called areva had hoped for billion euros
leading civil nuclear nations such as the united states britain and japan have ended or are phasing out processing
france and russia are the only two nations recycling spent fuel from nuclear reactors but france no longer operates the breeder reactors which are suitable to use this fuel
critics say that recycling increases the risk of nuclear proliferation as it separates out plutonium and is not cost effective because uranium is trading near decade lows
