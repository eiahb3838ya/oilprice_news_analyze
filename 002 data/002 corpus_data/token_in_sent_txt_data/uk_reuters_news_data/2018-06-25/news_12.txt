europe's first solar panel recycling plant opens in france
paris reuters french water and waste group veolia has opened what it says is europe s first recycling plant for solar panels and aims to build more as thousands of tonnes of ageing solar panels are set to reach the end of their life in coming years
the new plant in rousset southern france has a contract with solar industry recycling organisation pv cycle france to recycle tonnes of solar panels in virtually all solar panels that will reach their end of life in france this year and is set to ramp up to tonnes by
this is the first dedicated solar panel recycling plant in europe possibly in the world gilles carsuzaa head of electronics recycling at veolia told reporters
the first ageing photovoltaic pv panels which have lifespans of around years are just now beginning to come off rooftops and solar plants in volumes sufficiently steady and significant to warrant building a dedicated plant veolia said
up until now ageing or broken solar panels have typically been recycled in glass recycling facilities where only their glass and aluminium frames are recovered and their specialty glass is mixed in with other glass
the remainder is often burned in cement ovens
in a study on solar panel recycling the international renewable energy agency irena said that in the long term building dedicated pv panel recycling plants makes sense
it estimates that recovered materials could be worth million by and exceed billion by
the robots in veolia s new plant dissemble the panels to recuperate glass silicon plastics copper and silver which are crushed into granulates that can used to make new panels
a typical crystalline silicon solar panel is made up of percent glass percent aluminium for the frame percent plastic and just percent silicon
the new plant does not recycle solar panels which make up just a small percentage of the french market
veolia said it aims to recycle all decommissioned pv panels in france and wants to use this experience to build similar plants abroad
installed solar capacity is growing to percent per year in france with tonnes installed in and tonnes in veolia said
worldwide veolia expects tonnage of decommissioned pv panels will grow to several ten of millions of tonnes by
irena estimated that global pv waste streams will grow from tonnes end less than one percent of installed capacity to more than five million tonnes by
by then the amount of pv waste will almost match the mass contained in new installations it said
