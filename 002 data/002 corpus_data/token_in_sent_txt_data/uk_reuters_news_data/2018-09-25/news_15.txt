update 1-no delays to implementing shipping fuel sulphur cap in 2020 -imo
reuters the international maritime organization imo will not delay implementing a reduction in the amount of sulfur in marine fuel in officials with the un s shipping agency said on tuesday
i can categorically say there will not be a delay said edmund hughes the head of air pollution and energy efficiency at the imo during the asia pacific petroleum conference appec in singapore
from imo rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulfur content above percent compared with percent now unless they are equipped with scrubbers to clean up sulfur emissions
this will be enforced by fines levied by the imo s member states
the imo regulations will create a level playing field for the global shipping industry and if it were to back down it could lead different rules being implemented in different regions creating greater levels of uncertainty for the global industry hughes said
a delay to the regulation would damage the imo s reputation and credibility as a body for international shipping and would lead to more regional and national action to control air pollution from ships he said
frederick kenney director of legal affairs and external relations with the imo said separately that even if a motion was proposed by member states to change the implementation date it would take months for any amendments to take effect which would run beyond
you have to look at how strong the majority was to implement and it would be up to the proponents of any change to change that consensus kenney told reuters at a capital link shipping conference in london
a paper submitted to the imo by the bahamas liberia marshall islands and panama together with bimco intertanko and intercargo shipping associations called for ways to gather and analyze data to see if changes needed to be made to the regulations
the paper said challenges in implementation of the regulations must be resolved satisfactorily in the months to come in order to preserve the smooth flow of maritime trade
the shipping and oil refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were announced in
but some shippers have been slow to respond and have argued that the burden of compliance with the imo s stricter fuel standards should rest with refiners to produce lower sulfur fuels
this is a shipping regulation and it s amazing how many times i ve heard this is a refining problem said savvas manousos global head of trading at maersk oil trading at the conference
the onus of compliance is on the shipping industry not on the refining industry said manousos adding that the two industries must work together to address the global issue
maersk oil trading purchases marine fuel for its parent company
and is among the biggest ship fuel buyers in the world
