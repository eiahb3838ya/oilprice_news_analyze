lundin petroleum says arctic oil test points to bigger reservoir
oslo sept reuters swedish oil firm lundin petroleum expects to increase its resource estimate for the alta discovery in norway s arctic region following a successful production test
finding significant oil reserves in the norwegian arctic has been challenging for oil firms but alta is among the exceptions
the company and its partners are considering developing the discovery as a subsea field connected to a floating production and storage vessel and may also tie in the smaller gohta find which is located nearby
prior to the production test the combined gross resource range for the alta and gohta discoveries was estimated at between and million barrels of oil equivalent
these positive results are expected to increase the alta resource estimate and reduce the uncertainty range lundin said on tuesday
we have significantly advanced our understanding of this complex carbonate reservoir the development of which would be a first for norway
we will now concentrate our efforts on further defining the route to commercialisation and progressing development concept studies it added
lundin holds a percent stake in alta while idemitsu petroleum and dea hold percent each
lundin also holds percent at the nearby gohta while aker bp holds percent
