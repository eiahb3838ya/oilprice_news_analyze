chinese state-owned marine builder says to work with singapore trader to buy fuel
singapore sept reuters the marine construction unit of the china communications construction company cccc on tuesday signed an agreement to work with commodities trader zenrock group to purchase fuel
marine construction development co mcd which is involved in major infrastructure projects around the world as part of china s belt and road initiative wants to streamline its process for buying fuel said chief financial officer jin xinxiang
in the past our oil procurement activities have been very segregated into individual projects
with this new joint venture initiative it is envisaged we will have all oil procurement activities centralised under one umbrella jin told reuters
we own over construction vessels around the world which consume close to about tonnes of marine fuel on average each year and we have many more ships on hire said jin adding that the group s oil requirements go beyond just marine fuels and include crude oil refined products and bitumen used in road construction
he also said the company could use the joint venture to sell oil it may receive as payment on some of its infrastructure projects
in countries where payment issues may arise and there is a need for payment in oil for example we want to prepare ourselves so we are able to monetize that said jin
zenrock an oil and petrochemicals trader with offices in china and indonesia hopes the deal will help its expansion outside asia
zenrock president xie chun said the firm is looking to tap into markets including africa the middle east europe and the united states because asia s growing refining capacity is expected to leave the region with an excess supply of refined products such as gasoline and diesel
established in zenrock expects its trading volumes to reach million tonnes of crude oil and oil products in with billion in revenues up from million tonnes of traded volumes and billion in revenues the year before
through the joint venture we expect turnover to be increased to billion in with a percent increase in traded volumes said chun
