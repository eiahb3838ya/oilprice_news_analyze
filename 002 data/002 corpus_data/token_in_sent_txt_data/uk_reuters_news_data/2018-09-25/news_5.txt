update 2-rouhani says iran wants no war, sanctions, threats, or bullying
united nations reuters iranian president hassan rouhani on tuesday criticized washington for its hostile policy towards his country and said the approach was doomed to failure
rouhani in a speech to the united nations general assembly said the united states had waged economic war against iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions which were lifted under the country s multinational nuclear deal in return for tehran curbing its nuclear program
the united states policy the islamic republic of iran has been wrong from the beginning and its approach of resisting the wishes of the iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure rouhani said
president donald trump pulled the united states out of the pact in may and his administration reimposed sanctions on iran in august
harsher sanctions on iran s oil and banking sector are expected in november
the economic war that the united states has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade rouhani said
what iran says is clear no war no sanctions no threats no bullying just acting according to the law and the fulfilment of mounting pressure from the trump administration combined with discontent among many iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the islamic republic with little sign that its leaders have the answers officials and analysts say
the rial has lost percent of its value against the dollar since april

washington maintains a fleet in the gulf that protects oil shipping routes
the security of the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz has always been important for us we will confront any and all disruptive efforts in this critical waterway in the future said rouhani
the strait of hormuz is a strategic artery linking middle east crude producers to key markets in the europe north america and beyond
a third of the world s seaborne oil passes through the strait in southern iran
trump in his annual speech said he would keep up economic pressure on tehran to try to force a change in its behaviour
but rouhani said iran had no intention of succumbing to the pressure
the united states understanding of international relations is authoritarian
its understanding of power not of legal and legitimate authority is reflected in bullying and imposition rouhani said
no state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force said the pragmatist president adding that iran did not want any war
our proposal is clear commitment for commitment violation for violation threat for threat and step for step instead of talk for talk he said
rouhani expressed iran s willingness to improve ties with the regional countries
sunni muslim saudi arabia has been at loggerheads with shi ite iran for decades fighting a proxy war in the middle east and beyond that has influenced conflicts in iraq syria lebanon and yemen
riyadh and its gulf allies have hailed trump s decision to exit the nuclear deal and to reimpose sanctions on tehran reflecting their concern about iran s influence in the region
we believe in the formation of a collective mechanism for the persian gulf region with the presence and participation of all regional countries rouhani said
