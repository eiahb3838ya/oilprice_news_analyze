above the russian arctic circle, prisoners of putin's pension reform
vorkuta russia reuters russian railway worker andrey bugera had a singular goal get to pension age so he can leave the polluted frigid coal mining town above the arctic circle where he works and move south to live out even a brief bit of retirement in comfort
but now that president vladimir putin has said he plans to raise the retirement age by five years bugera fears this will never happen
in his city of vorkuta a place so isolated it can not be reached by road temperatures dip below minus degrees celsius in the winter and clouds of coal dust can turn the white snow black
thin polluted air scarce sunlight and winters lasting up to months weigh heavily on the average life expectancy in the city labelled the eighth most polluted in russia by the government last year
in june in the space of two weeks three of bugera s friends died before reaching the age of
one of my colleagues came home from his night shift and just didn t wake up
left his family three kids
he was years old
it was his heart a blood clot
so how can they even think about us retiring at bugera said
though one long time concession in the far north has been early retirement to help attract workers to its harsh environment the government s planned reforms will raise the pension age by five years to for men and for women
yet males born in in komi republic where vorkuta is located on average are expected to live to government data shows or four years short of the proposed new retirement age
in the rest of russia the retirement age is set to rise to for men and for women making matters little better as the nationwide life expectancy for men was years old in government data shows
two years ago bugera and his wife used their savings to buy an apartment in sokol a small riverside town in the vologda region in central russia
they have spent their holidays there since gradually renovating the apartment in the hope of one day leaving the arctic
now bugera said he has given up thinking about ever leaving vorkuta
with this pension reform with everything pushed back i feel like i ll never get out bugera said
the government s decision to raise the retirement age is part of efforts to balance russia s creaking finances after four years of weak growth made worse by sanctions but it is proving its most unpopular move in more than a decade
putin s grip on power is not directly threatened because he has no real challengers but his popularity rating has slipped and once loyal putin voters are starting to express scorn for their rulers
around people lived in vorkuta in the most coming from across the soviet union in search of the high wages miners in the desolate city used to earn
now just four of its coal mines remain and the population has fallen closer to
districts of empty blackened apartment blocks with collapsed roofs and yards littered with rubble surround central vorkuta
with no roads leading out of the city it is too expensive for most residents to take their belongings with them when they leave
in abandoned apartments furniture rots and clothes and books lie strewn across the floor
when i leave i ll take my guns and my guitar that s it
people drop everything and go said sergei a coal miner travelling to vorkuta by train
a doctor at a district hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity said she did not want to stay in a town where everything was being shut
she was due to retire next year and like bugera planned to move to a home she had prepared for her family in the south
with this reform probably none of that is going to happen
i don t know
but i have no more strength will anything to live in a town like this
where everything is in ruins she said
you walk around like a bugera attended protests in vorkuta against the pension reforms
the events were relatively small attracting around people in july and are expected to dwindle as the snows set in next month
if we don t manage to change anything with our protests at least i ll leave some sort of base for my children bugera said
a muted anger was registered in regional elections on however
vorkuta saw a turnout of just percent election commission data showed
the presidential election which took place in march before the proposed pension reform was announced saw a turnout of percent
this pension reform has become the final straw
people have summed everything up and understood that this is the final straw for them said former miner and security guard alexander golyanchuk referring to the low election turnout
we live in tough conditions and we don t live for very long
now they re taking away our pensions as well he added
walking through vorkuta olga lebedeva said she previously had four years to go until her pension
now they ve added five
so now it s nine
i ll grin and bear it she said before pausing
no i ll writing by polina ivanova editing by christian lowe and jason neely
