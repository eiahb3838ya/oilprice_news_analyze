total finalises plans to expand texas bayport polymers in petrochems push
paris sept reuters french oil and gas major total has made a final investment decision to expand its texas bayport polymers joint venture to double polyethylene production capacity to around million tonnes a year the company said
total said it aimed to become a major player in the polyethylene market when it announced the joint venture in march with borealis and canada s nova chemical
the bayport project is in line with the company s billion programme that began a year ago with a billion investment to build an ethane steam cracker at its port arthur refining complex in texas
the cracker will process ethane which is abundantly available from shale gas at competitive prices and will supply bayport polyethylene units
production is expected to start in
the new unit is expected to have a capacity of a tonnes a year that will added to the existing tonnes per year unit
the bayport unit engineering procurement and construction has been awarded to the company mcdermott total said
polyethylene is used in packaging pipes bottles plastics and other composite materials
it is also seen as a growing market that total is targeting with a global expansion of its petrochemicals refining units
the project is in line with our strategy to develop petrochemicals at our major integrated refining complexes and leverage competitively priced feedstocks said bernard pinatel total s president for refining and chemicals
pinatel said light materials are increasingly used as substitutes for metals in various industrial sectors such as transport and energy all of which is lifting demand for plastics and polymers
it is a market that is growing by to percent per year pinatel said
as part of this expansion into the polyethylene market total and saudi aramco had said in april they would invest around billion to build a petrochemical complex at their jubail satorp refinery
in may total also signed a billion deal with algeria s sonatrach to build a polypropylene plant in western algeria that will supply plastic to the algerian and wider mediterranean market
last december its south korean joint venture with hanwha group had also said it would invest million in the group s refining and petrochemicals platform to increase polyethylene output by tonnes per year by
that increased investment was planned to deal with growing demand particularly from china
