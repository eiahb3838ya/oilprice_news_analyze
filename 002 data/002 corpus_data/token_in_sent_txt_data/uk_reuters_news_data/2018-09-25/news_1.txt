iran oil exports fall before us sanctions -global banking group
new york sept reuters iranian oil exports are declining ahead of a second round of sanctions to be imposed on and iran s economy is likely to contract percent this year and percent in the institute of international finance said on tuesday
exports of crude oil and condensates have declined by million barrels a day mbd from april to september the iif which represents major banks and financial institutions from around the world said
it said crude oil and condensates exports were mbd in april and are now estimated at mbd in september
the iif said in an updated note on iran s economy that oil exports are falling even although iran is selling key grades at a deep discount and using its own tankers to ship products to china and india at no extra cost
the iif said iranian shippers were also providing generous payment terms and in some cases accepting euros and chinese yuan instead of dollars
the iif said barter trade and cash could play a bigger role as sanctions are enforced
the updated report comes as president donald trump and iranian president hassan rouhani exchanged taunts at the united nations general assembly on tuesday
the remaining parties to the iran nuclear deal which curbed iran s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and from which trump withdrew the united states in may agreed on monday to work to maintain trade with tehran despite skepticism this is possible as sanctions to choke off iranian oil sales resume in november
in a statement after a meeting of britain china france germany russia and iran the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible
the european union s plans for a special purpose vehicle spv designed to circumvent sanctions against iran s oil exports is deeply counterproductive secretary of state mike pompeo said on tuesday
several european diplomats said the spv idea was to create a barter system similar to one used by the soviet union during the cold war to exchange iranian oil for european goods without money changing hands
the iif said such a system would likely fail to persuade major european companies to do business with iran for fear of sanctions
iran may continue to be committed to the nuclear deal providing the eu and others do the same the iif said
however failure to renegotiate the deal with the would likely bring about even deeper damage to iran s economy it added
