update 12-oil prices climb on opec-led cuts, but off session highs
new york reuters oil prices ended more than percent higher on friday after opec members and allies like russia agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market but the gains were capped by concerns that the cuts would not offset growing production
the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies referred to as agreed to slash production by a combined million barrels per day next year in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in april
this was larger than the minimum million bpd that the market had expected despite pressure from president donald trump to reduce the price of crude
opec will curb output by bpd from january while allies contribute an additional bpd of cuts iraqi oil minister thamer ghadhban said after the organisation concluded two days of talks in vienna
the deal had hung in the balance for two days first on fears that russia would cut too little and later on concerns that iran whose crude exports have been depleted by sanctions would receive no exemption and block the agreement
but after hours of talks iran gave opec the green light and russia said it was ready to cut more
russia gave a commitment to reduce output by bpd from october levels of million bpd though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months
without cuts there would have been extreme downward pressure on the market said john paisie executive vice president at stratas advisors a consultancy
i think the saudis tried to walk a tightrope they want to make sure they maintain their relationship with the but they also need to make some cuts because they need a higher oil price to balance their brent crude rose or percent to settle at a barrel

while the announcement of the cuts initially sent prices higher some of the enthusiasm cooled on fears that the cut would not absorb new output coming online in the united states that has made it the word s top producer
a cut if implemented fully should be enough to largely attenuate but not eliminate expected implied global inventory builds in the first half of next year harry tchilinguirian global oil strategist at bnp paribas in london told the reuters global oil forum
given supply due to come online some analysts and market participants said the cut may not be sufficient to end oil s rout
relative to how big this looming supply tsunami is it is not nearly enough to prevent big inventory builds next year said robert mcnally president of rapidan energy group in washington
president trump and president putin prevented from cutting by more which was certainly needed to put a sturdy floor under prices

russia had initially balked at cutting production alongside opec
output from the world s biggest producers opec russia and the united states has increased by million bpd since the end of to million bpd meeting almost percent of global consumption
