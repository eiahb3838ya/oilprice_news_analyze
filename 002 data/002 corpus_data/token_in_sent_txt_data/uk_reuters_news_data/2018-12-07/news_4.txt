update 9-opec, russia agree to slash oil output despite trump pressure
vienna reuters opec and its allies agreed on friday to slash oil production by more than the market had expected despite pressure from president donald trump to reduce the price of crude
the producer club will curb output from january by million barrels per day versus october levels while allies contribute an additional million bpd of cuts in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in april
oil prices jumped about percent to more than a barrel as the combined cut of million bpd was larger than the minimum million bpd that the market had expected
saudi arabia de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has faced demands from trump to help the global economy by refraining from paring supplies
an output curtailment also would provide support to iran by increasing the price of oil amid attempts by washington to squeeze the economy of opec s producer
asked whether the decision to cut could sour riyadh s relations with washington saudi energy minister khalid told reporters the kingdom was ready to pump more should a major supply outage occur
we will not squeeze consumers beyond what they can afford he said adding that given the united states had recently become the biggest nation its energy companies were breathing a sigh of relief
further complicating riyadh s decisions this week was the crisis around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul in october
trump has backed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman despite calls from many politicians to impose stiff sanctions on the kingdom
falih refrained from answering a question on whether the opec decision might prompt washington to withdraw support but said relations were based on shared values
marathon the opec deal had hung in the balance for two days first on fears that russia would cut too little and later on concerns that iran whose crude exports have been depleted by sanctions would receive no exemption and block the agreement
but after hours of talks iran gave opec the green light and russia said it was ready to cut more
russia gave a commitment to reduce output by bpd from october levels of million bpd though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months
the country s energy minister alexander novak said russian president vladimir putin had discussed an output decrease with saudi prince mohammed
iraq opec s producer pledged to cut bpd
falih said saudi production had dropped to million bpd in december from million in november and was set to decline to million bpd in january
iran libya and venezuela were effectively given exemptions
nigeria which has been exempt since the previous round of cuts from january agreed to participate
helima croft managing director at rbc capital markets said the deal exceeded expectations
having the next meeting in april will be important for planning purposes to speed the cycle up a bit she said
opec normally meets once every six months
we don t know what will iran s sanctions picture look like
we don t know the iranian volumes which will be coming off the market croft said
but bob mcnally president of rapidan energy group said the details of the cut were fuzzy and would likely result in a lesser reduction than the headline figure
president trump will not be happy to see today s headlines but how strongly he reacts depends mainly on whether crude prices rise strongly as a result in coming days and special representative for iran brian hook met falih in vienna this week in an unprecedented development ahead of an opec meeting
saudi arabia first denied the discussion took place but later confirmed it

political pressure is clearly a dominant factor at this opec meeting limiting the scope of saudi actions to rebalance the market said gary ross chief executive of black gold investors and a veteran opec watcher
the price of crude has fallen almost a third since october as saudi arabia russia and the united arab emirates raised output to offset lower exports from iran
