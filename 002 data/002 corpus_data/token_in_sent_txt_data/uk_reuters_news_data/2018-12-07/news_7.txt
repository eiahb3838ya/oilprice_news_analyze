house in order: carbon emissions from buildings level off
katowice poland dec thomson reuters foundation h emissions from buildings and construction appear to have peaked at a global level the united nations said on friday a trend that could encourage countries to take up the issue more aggressively as a way of curbing climate change
greenhouse gas emissions attributed to buildings levelled off over but still represent about a third of the global emissions that cause climate change a report by un environment and its partners said
the finding is a rare bright spot amid a spate of warnings that not enough is being done to stop the planet heating up
global carbon emissions are set to rise nearly percent this year due to continued fossil fuel use scientists said this week dashing hopes that an increase in was temporary after two years of slowdown
the un environment report called for more pledges to make building construction greener in national climate action plans submitted for the paris agreement to curb climate change
it s a very complex field but one that s absolutely critical nick nuttall a un environment spokesman told reporters on the sidelines of climate talks in poland
delegates from more than nations party to the paris agreement are gathered in the polish city of katowice to meet an deadline to agree rules on how to enforce the pact
the rule book as it is known is expected to include details about how countries will report and monitor curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen their national plans
a positive outcome at the negotiations could encourage governments to double down on promises to cut emissions from the construction industry said nuttall
that might increase the enthusiasm of nations to revise their action plans he said
if they re revised upwards to include the building and construction sector then what happens here will have a very strong impact on the sector being able to move forward to encourage buildings the national plans could push for better insulation and windows by aspiring to revamp building codes and set up energy certification schemes
they could also plan to lower emissions from common building materials like cement and steel whose manufacturing generates large amounts of carbon the report said
even if such rules require consumers to open their wallets to retrofit a home for example it is unlikely to cause the kind of public anger seen recently in france over fuel taxes said jennifer layke global director for energy with the world resources institute
higher fuel taxes proposed by french president emmanuel macron to fight climate change have stoked violent protests in the european nation forcing the government to shelve the plan this week
if you told everyone they had to spend next month to renovate their home you would see a backlash said layke
but most countries had proven strategies to help consumers shoulder the costs such as financing or rebates she said
in june the european union gave its member states months to put into law a goal to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of buildings by
