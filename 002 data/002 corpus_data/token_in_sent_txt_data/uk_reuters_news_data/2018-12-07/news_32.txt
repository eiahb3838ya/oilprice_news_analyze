graphic-take five: uk may-day and us curveballs: world markets themes for the week ahead
reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them
with major parts of the economy visibly slowing the treasury market has reacted in a striking manner the yield is close to falling below the yield which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last years
signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year
but wait
inflation is running at a high annual wage growth a year high and unemployment at a year low
so november inflation due on will play into how fed chair jerome powell frames the path of future tightening
so it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here
there are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert
depending on how the incoming data looks stagflation anyone
the fed s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear
one part of the yield curve just inverted what does that mean
tariff effects broaden across wage growth higher fed as fed says on track narrowing yield curve could complicate debate mayday
mayday
buckle up for another wild week of brexit on sterling and other markets
britain s parliament is at the time of writing at least set to vote on prime minister theresa may s brexit transition deal on tuesday but the chances of it being approved don t look good
what happens then is well that s the thing there are multiple possibilities all with very different implications
a really heavy defeat would make it difficult for may to carry on
she has staggered through the last couple of years taking direct hits from all angles but this could finally bring her down
could that then lead to a hard brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal
perhaps and sterling won t like that one bit
but it s equally possible that whoever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the article notice
that could even raise the chances of a second public brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring
as brexit crunch nears campaign for new referendum gathers pace may brexit deal under fire as legal advice stiffens opposition qe no more thursday marks the end of an era for the ecb which is set to formally announce the end of its long monetary stimulus scheme
for markets that s a done deal
what matters now is what the ecb does in the face of a weakening economy global trade tensions brexit and italy
policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when qe ends
one suggestion is for loans to banks
what investors appear more certain about is that the ecb will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent especially if a slowdown encourages the fed to pause its cycle
money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a pct chance of a ecb rate hike in
but that s down from percent just a few weeks ago
ecb policymakers debate new ways out of easy money italy spain and france would face billion euro hit on new ecb key euro zone inflation dips as ecb braces to end bond buying trade off so much for the trade truce
if financial markets are any guide the detente between washington and beijing struck over a steak dinner at the in buenos aires barely lasted hours
fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment
on oil markets that signals that a percent price slump since october has little hope of reversing
oil has also had to contend with opec whose failure to agree an output cut accelerated the slump in prices pushing brent below and wti futures close to breaking below
the possibility of small cuts by the likes of russia and kazakhstan are unlikely to save the day given the magnitude of market oversupply
commodities overall are in some trouble
copper is near lows having lost around percent so far in while most base metals are down a similar amount
and the australian dollar a good proxy for commodities chinese demand and world trade was the major currency in the world all week
without good news on the trade front respite is unlikely
iran agrees to opec oil cut focus shifts back to russia trade deficit hits high private hiring slows china says confident it can clinch trade deal with as doubts grow beijing cocktail the united states has just reported its trade deficit hit a high in october and its politically sensitive deficit with china surged to a record billion
so markets will watch to see how china hawks in the trump administration react to china s trade data due for release on december
the data should show whether china is carrying out promises to import more from america
it could well provide more grist for the mill for officials pushing for more reasons to punish china and for investors sceptical of the trade ceasefire
the prospect of a chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy
so while trade contributes far less to the country s gdp than it used to there are other data points coming up too credit growth and retail sales among others which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war
