cocoa companies fail on pledge to stop africa deforestation - report
dakar dec thomson reuters foundation major chocolate companies have failed to keep a promise they made a year ago to stop forests in west africa being destroyed for cocoa production a campaign group said on friday
companies from mars to hershey to barry callebaut joined the governments of ivory coast and ghana to launch the cocoa and forests initiative last year pledging to eliminate the production and sourcing of cocoa from protected forests
but satellite images of ivory coast s southwest region showed about the same amount of forest had been lost in the months since the pledge was made as in the previous year campaign group mighty earth said in a report
i would have expected to see some deforestation continue because it s very hard to transform an entire industry overnight but i did not expect to see it continue exactly the same as before said the report s author etelle higgonet
if deforestation continues unabated ivory coast the world s top cocoa producer risks losing all its forest cover by environmental campaigners say
but stopping it is a challenge since the cocoa grown on that land provides livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of farmers and their families
land is scarce so poor farmers often expand into forests or parks to raise their incomes experts say
mighty earth recorded hectares of deforestation equivalent to football fields in ivory coast s southwest region between and
this put it on track to reach about the same figure as last year ha by november higgonet said
the group was not able to obtain data as precise from ghana but observed a similar lack of change there she added
the world cocoa foundation wcf the industry group behind the cocoa and forests initiative said recent reports show there has been progress in national parks and classified forests
our immediate priority has been to stop deforestation in the most ecologically important and environmentally sensitive areas and we are encouraged to see positive results in less than one year said wcf president richard scobey
most of the recent deforestation hotspots are in rural areas outside protected forests which is legal but still environmentally damaging he told the thomson reuters foundation
mighty earth also accused companies of not upholding their pledge to stop buying cocoa from national parks
ivory coast has estimated percent of its cocoa comes from protected areas
i feel like people are taking me for a fool
because if you do the math somebody s buying it said higgonet
