update 2-brazil environment regulator denies total permit to drill amazon basin
rio de janeiro reuters brazil environmental regulator ibama said on friday it had denied a permit to french oil major total sa to drill in the environmentally sensitive foz do amazonas basin for a fifth and final time
ibama said in a statement that it agreed with a technical assessment that indicated oil exploration in the area would present risks to reefs and biodiversity
bp plc and petroleo brasileiro sa are also investors in the project near the mouth of the amazon river which is being operated by total
ibama said it had given total all possible opportunities to correct problems found during the technical evaluation and that the company had been informed of the decision earlier on friday
total has been seeking to explore the offshore basin which geologists believe could contain up to billion barrels of petroleum or more than the entire proven reserves in the gulf of mexico for more than four years
the french company did not immediately respond to a request for comment
