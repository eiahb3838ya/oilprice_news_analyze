turkey's top spy in u.s. to meet senators, intelligence officials -sources
washington dec reuters turkey s head of intelligence has traveled to washington to meet with lawmakers and intelligence officials sources said in an apparent bid to improve ties with the americans after a breakdown in the nato allies relationship last summer
hakan fidan a close confidant of turkey s president tayyip erdogan has met with senators to discuss nato issues and was expected to meet with intelligence officials later on friday according to five sources familiar with the matter who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity
the killing of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul was discussed in the meeting with members and staff of the nato observer group a bipartisan group of senators that advocates for the alliance two sources familiar with the matter said
but it was not a central subject in discussions with senators and the turkish side has refrained from making it the focus of their meetings the sources added
top senators have said they want to punish saudi arabia for the killing despite president donald trump s decision to stand by the ally
while the two countries have collaborated on the khashoggi investigation ties have been strained by disagreements over a number of issues from syria to turkey s desire to buy russian defense systems
relations between ankara and washington began to improve after pastor andrew brunson who was on trial over charges in turkey was released in october
but the nato allies remain divided on other issues including policy in syria ankara s ambition to purchase russian missile defense systems and turkey s request for the united states to extradite fethullah gulen a cleric ankara blames for organizing an abortive putsch
gulen denies involvement
fidan was expected to discuss the murder of khashoggi a washington post columnist and critic of the saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman in his meeting with intelligence officials sources said
it was not immediately clear if fidan was to meet with gina haspel director of the cia
the cia has assessed with medium to high confidence that the crown price the kingdom s de facto ruler ordered the killing of khashoggi when he visited the consulate on
saudi arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge
trump cast doubt on the cia assessment saying the agency had not formed a definitive conclusion
secretary of state mike pompeo has said there was no direct evidence linking the prince to the killing
