number of electric vehicles on roads reaches 3 million-iea
london reuters the number of electric vehicles on roads worldwide rose to a record high of million in but more research policies and incentives are needed to drive further uptake the international energy agency iea said
the number of electric cars including hybrid electric and fuel cell electric passenger vehicles increased by percent compared with the iea said in a report
china accounted for percent of the global total last year
research and development policy support charging infrastructure investment and production improvements are resulting in lower battery costs and higher electric vehicle ev uptake
battery costs however are still a major component of ev costs so financial incentives such as rebates tax breaks or exemptions will be needed to support electric car deployment
dynamic market uptake of electric vehicles has occurred in recent years the iea said in a report
ongoing support and commitments for increased deployment of evs from policy makers and the automotive industry suggest that this trend is not going to abate in the coming decade it added
by the iea estimates there will be million evs on the road based on existing and announced policies
that could rise to million if policies become more ambitious to meet global climate goals and other sustainability targets
the shift to evs will increase demand for some materials especially cobalt and lithium used in batteries
cobalt demand is expected to be ten times higher than current levels by at kilotonnes kt per year under current policies and could be as much as times higher at with more ambitious government policies the iea estimates
lithium demand is forecast to be by based on current policies and if more ambitious polices are implemented
so far rising numbers of evs on the road have had a limited impact on electricity demand
in estimated global electricity demand from all evs was terrawatt hours equivalent to slightly more than the power demand of greece
however as electric vehicle uptake continues to rise their charging will increase electricity demand and impact transmission and distribution grids the report said
