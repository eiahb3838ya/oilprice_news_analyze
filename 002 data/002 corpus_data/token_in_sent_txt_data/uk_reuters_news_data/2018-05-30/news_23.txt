update 1-exxon shareholders reject proposal to split ceo, chair roles
dallas reuters exxon mobil corp shareholders rejected a proposal on wednesday that would have split the roles of chairman and chief executive securing ceo darren woods s role as he looks to improve results at the world s largest publicly traded oil producer
woods who became chairman and ceo in january has struggled to recover from failed bets taken by his predecessor rex tillerson the former secretary of state that resulted in billions of dollars in and a stock price that has lagged peers
exxon under woods has moved aggressively to launch major expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas as well as expand the company s refining and chemical footprint
woods in march told wall street investors that the expansions should help double exxon s earnings by to about billion billion pounds
still exxon s earnings fell short of expectations as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices
by voting to keep the roles combined shareholders effectively gave support to woods to lead the board and employees as they jointly try to meet those goals
no one in our industry can match our opportunity set today woods told fellow shareholders at the company s annual meeting in dallas
shares of exxon rose percent to on wednesday after an analyst upgraded the company s stock saying its low valuation relative to peers presented a buying opportunity
woods vowed that he would continue to work to address climate change especially through biofuels research
but outside the dallas meeting about people gathered to protest what they said was exxon s lack of accountability for its impact on global climate change
there were no proposals for exxon s shareholders to consider at this year s meeting after one was approved last year requiring an annual carbon report
protesters on wednesday said they were biding their time this year
there s not a lot of optimism they ll exxon executives will make good on it but if they don t we ll be back next year with an even stronger shareholder proposal said molly rooke a former exxon employee who now volunteers with the environmental group
rooke s fellow protesters held a bevy of signs outside the meeting emblazoned with such slogans as exxon mobil climate criminal and arrest shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced exxon to provide greater disclosure on its lobbying expenditures and change its bylaws to how special meetings are called
shareholders approved a full slate of nominees to the company s board of directors
