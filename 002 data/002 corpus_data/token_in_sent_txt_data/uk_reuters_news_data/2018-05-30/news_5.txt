update 1-exxon ceo urges new york prosecutor to rethink climate change probe
dallas reuters exxon mobil corp s chief executive said on wednesday he hopes the new attorney general in new york comes to a different conclusion than predecessor eric schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world s largest publicly traded oil producer
schneiderman who resigned earlier this month here after allegations of physical abuse by four women that he denied had alleged exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew
exxon has long denied the charges here the investigation has spread to other states including massachusetts and has put exxon squarely in the middle of the ongoing debate about fossil fuels and climate change
ceo darren woods who spoke at exxon s annual shareholder meeting in dallas said he was committed to being part of the solution on climate woods added he had not reached out to barbara underwood who was appointed to replace schneiderman
he said he was not sure if exxon attorneys have talked to underwood or her office
i m real confident on where we stand
i hope whoever comes in steps back and takes an objective look and comes to a different conclusion woods said
underwood a democrat appointed by the new york state legislature has said she would not run for election to a full term this november
at least six candidates of various political backgrounds have announced their candidacies
let s see what that election brings woods said
underwood s office said on wednesday that the exxon climate probe was ongoing
our office s work has continued without interruption and that certainly includes the exxon investigation said amy spitalnick spokeswoman for the new york attorney general
new york state comptroller thomas dinapoli who oversees state pension funds that hold about million exxon shares has also long criticized the company s response to climate change and voted against a slate of board nominees at the company s annual meeting
the fund can not support board directors who refuse to acknowledge substantial risks to exxon bottom line and fail to help it transition to a lower carbon future dinapoli said in a statement
all board nominees were approved here by exxon shareholders
