interview-up on the roof: china's renesola bets on small-scale solar projects
shanghai reuters chinese solar developer renesola is banking on the growing appetite for small projects on city rooftops after hiving off its struggling manufacturing business last year a senior executive told reuters
the strategy underscores how many industry officials see solar projects on roofs and in car parks as the best available option with chronic land shortages forcing conventional renewable power developers to take steps such as building on depleted mining areas
china s solar sector has seen rapid growth with newly installed capacity reaching a record gigawatts last year but manufacturers are now coming under pressure from the land constraints falling subsidies and a decline in project approvals
there is still a lot of room for growth every year there are lots of new buildings and factories and throughout the regions there are buildings that still have no solar said liang xiaoliang renesola s chief financial officer
while central government subsidies for smaller distributed generation dg projects fell to yuan per this year from yuan regions like shanghai and zhejiang are offering additional support to meet targets he added
china s dg capacity nearly tripled to gw last year spurred by growing demand from building owners who pay zero construction costs and receive discounted power
renesola is targeting around mw of capacity in china by and does not plan to get involved in plants
there are land issues grid interconnection issues curtailment issues as well as the postponed payment of subsidies he said adding that a distributed project needed only two permits compared to for a plant
though solar still struggles to compete with conventional energy sources some expect it to achieve cost parity within just a few years
china itself has cut solar costs by percent in the last decade offsetting the subsidy declines
liang said a project built in xinjiang in cost about yuan per watt while some industry estimates now say prices could fall to as low as yuan by
the government is also offering alternative means of support including a scheme compelling regions to ensure a fixed proportion of their power comes from renewables
renesola formerly a polysilicon wafer producer last year transferred its manufacturing assets and debts to chairman li xianshou in exchange for additional equity switching its business model to downstream generation projects in the process
