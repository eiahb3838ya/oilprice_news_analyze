global markets-stocks rebound as italian risk ebbs
new york reuters global stocks staged a recovery on wednesday buoyed by optimism that italy may avoid a potentially damaging general election
msci s gauge of stocks across the globe gained percent lifted by a rebound in both europe and the united states
the recovery was partly driven by news that italy s two parties were renewing efforts to form a government rather than force the country to the polls for the second time this year
the prospect that no government would be formed leading to elections that could be a referendum on italy s euro membership had sent italian bond yields up by the most in nearly years

then we get some news that comes out and we start to see evidence of that change but each and every time those have tended to be a bit of a pain browne said he expects volatility to continue
the italian election risk had also sent investors scurrying for safer german and government bonds as well as currencies such as the yen and swiss franc at the expense of the euro
that trend receded on wednesday with the euro bouncing nearly one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its tuesday losses which had taken it down to lows
it also rose against the swiss franc and yen
