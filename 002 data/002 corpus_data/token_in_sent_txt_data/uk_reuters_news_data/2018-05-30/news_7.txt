update 1-canada finance minister defends trans mountain purchase
calgary alberta reuters canada s decision to buy kinder morgan canada ltd s trans mountain pipeline was brought about by a particularly problematic situation and is not a symbol of how things get done in the country the finance minister said on wednesday
canada on tuesday agreed to buy the pipeline for c billion billion in an effort to save a project that faces formidable opposition from environmentalists and british columbia officials worried the pipeline could spill its heavy oil
finance minister bill morneau said the decision was exceptional and that the rule of law needs to be seen as a business advantage to investing in canada
we don t see this as a symbol of the way to get things done in this country morneau told a business audience in calgary home to canada s energy industry
he was briefly interrupted by several protesters
but perrin beatty chief executive of the canadian chamber of commerce said the government needs to revamp the badly broken regulatory system for major energy projects
he said the liberal government s planned reforms are not sufficient to preclude the repeat of another situation like trans mountain
we have to have a system where it s possible to get an answer and where it s possible to act on that answer beatty said
what we ve been getting in canada is decision by morneau said that while the government will listen to bidders for the pipeline in the its sale will depend on being certain that it will get built
ottawa has said it does not intend to own the project in the
morneau reiterated that multiple potential investors have approached the government
he gave no specifics though he said pension funds and aboriginal groups have approached him personally
the planned expansion of trans mountain would nearly triple the capacity running from alberta s oil sands to the pacific province of british columbia which is opposed to the project
the federal government has repeatedly said the project is in the national interest
but opposition in british columbia threaten to further delay the project which was approved by the federal government in
british columbia s premier john horgan told broadcaster global news on wednesday that he rejected the idea that his relationship with the federal government has deteriorated over the dispute
we disagree on one issue horgan said
