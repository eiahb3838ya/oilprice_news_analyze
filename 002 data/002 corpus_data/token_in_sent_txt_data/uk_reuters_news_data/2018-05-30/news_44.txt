global markets-italy leads european mini-bounce as election risk fades slightly
world stocks hit by trade war fears italian bonds stocks bounce on hope vote may be averted euro rises off lows vs dlr bounces vs yen franc updates throughout by sujata rao london may reuters hopes that italy might avoid a potentially damaging general election lifted european markets on wednesday bringing italian bond yields off highs and dampening some of the recent buying interest for german and government bonds
the backdrop for world markets remained sombre however as the united states revived trade war fears with an announcement that it would press ahead with tariffs and restrictions on chinese investments and beijing threatened to retaliate
the prospect of acrimony between the world s biggest two economies added to fears for the global economy already feeling the hit from the risk of an crisis in the euro zone
however equity futures signalled wall street indexes would open around half a percent higher after the previous day s harsh session and losses across asia earlier on wednesday where a key equity index shed more than percent
world stocks slipped percent heading for their sixth day in the red but european shares made tentative gains after falling almost percent in the past five days
the recovery was partly driven by news that italy s two parties were again renewing efforts to form a government rather than force the country back to the polls for the second time this year
another positive was a smooth auction of italian debt that raised billion euros easing concerns about rome s ability to finance itself
the auction clearly indicates that investors still have faith in the italian economy if not the government said seema shah global investment strategist at principal global investors
but she warned that political uncertainty would remain elevated
japan s biggest private life insurance firm nippon life which holds some trillion yen billion worth of euro zone bonds said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its italian debt holdings
equities snapped a losing streak and bounced almost percent while italian bond yields a sensitive gauge of political risk fell more than half a percent from highs
they had suffered their worst day in nearly years on tuesday
italian yields slipped bps
the risk for investors is that eurosceptic political parties are further boosted with any election viewed as a de facto referendum on italy s euro membership
the events have evoked memories of the euro debt crisis with potentially huge implications for the single currency
the risks had sent investors scurrying for safer german and governmment bonds as well as currencies such as the yen and swiss franc at the expense of the euro
that trend receded on wednesday with the euro bouncing almost one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its tuesday losses which had taken it down to lows
it also rose between percent and one percent against the swiss franc and yen respectively
the political problems in italy heighten the risk of a systematic problem within the euro zone and within the euro zone financial system but that is still a risk rather than a probability said laith khalaf senior analyst at hargreaves lansdown
the improved mood encouraged investors to sell and german bonds reversing some of the bps yield rises seen on tuesday
yields jumped more than basis points to percent while their german counterparts were up basis points
most investors remain cautious though with goldman sachs cutting its forecast for the euro s exchange rate against the dollar due to italian political developments
it said it now expected the euro to trade at in months time versus its previous prediction
with brewing trade conflicts world growth is another concern
the organisation for economic cooperation and development warned in its latest report that a trade war was threatening the growth outlook
that is likely to weigh especially hard on the developing world emerging equities were down more than one percent to month lows while shanghai shares dropped percent
emerging markets are also suffering from the dollar s surge since with indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency
