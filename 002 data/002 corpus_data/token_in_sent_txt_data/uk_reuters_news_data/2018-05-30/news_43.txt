london may reuters iran s crude oil exports have declined slightly in may according to estimates from a leading company in the first sign that the threat of sanctions may be deterring buyers
the estimates from also suggest iranian oil buyers are not rushing to cut volumes from opec s producer
the sanctions have a period during which buyers should wind down purchases
president donald trump on may said the united states was exiting a international nuclear deal with iran and would impose new sanctions that seek to reduce the country s oil shipments
exports are down by more than barrels per day bpd from the very high levels seen in april but there is no sign of a mass exodus at this time daniel gerber chief executive of told reuters
supply and demand in large parts of the oil market is opaque and is among a number of consultancies that estimate supply from opec countries by tracking tanker shipments and other methods
did not specify the absolute volume of iran s exports in may or april
iran said it exported million barrels per day bpd in april a record since the lifting of international sanctions on tehran in january
reuters shipping data also suggests iranian crude exports have dropped since trump s sanctions announcement falling to around million bpd in may a drop of about bpd from april
the bulk of iran s crude exports at least million bpd goes to asia
most of the rest goes to europe and these volumes are seen by analysts and traders as the more vulnerable to being curbed by sanctions
said the overall rate of iran s exports remained strong in may compared with recent months and companies in europe were still buying
in fact may exports remain significantly higher than the previous average with european refiners continuing to load cargoes throughout the month gerber said
iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh said on may tehran s oil exports would not change if the eu could salvage the nuclear pact as it is trying to do
but trading sources expect financing issues to hinder iranian oil trade as banks grow wary
