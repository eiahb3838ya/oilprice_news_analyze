buffett utility to be first in u.s. to reach 100 pct renewables
reuters midamerican energy co will become the first utility to source percent of its customers electricity needs from renewable energy when it completes a million wind farm in the company said on wednesday
the utility owned by warren buffett s berkshire hathaway inc began investing in wind power about years ago to both hedge against volatile fuel prices and generate more power its chief executive said adding that federal tax credits for renewable projects have kept costs low
we have not had to raise customers rates and that s a big part of the way we evaluate these projects midamerican ceo adam wright said in an interview
we re not building wind just for the sake of building the company based in des moines iowa serves electric customers
with the completion of the utility s twelfth wind project midamerican will generate enough renewable energy to equal the amount consumed by customers in its iowa service territory
because of the intermittency of electricity generated by wind the utility will continue to use its existing natural gas nuclear and power plants midamerican said adding that it is seeking sites to add more wind farms
wind power accounts for more than percent of the electricity generated in iowa more than any other state
midamerican s wind xii project is subject to approval by the iowa utilities board
