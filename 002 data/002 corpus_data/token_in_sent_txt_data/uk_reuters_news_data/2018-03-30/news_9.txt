modi ally says india's ruling party suffers from perception it is anti-muslim
new delhi reuters indian prime minister narendra modi s ruling party is struggling to change a perception that it is against minority muslims and people a political ally said which could cost it votes in a general election due next year
modi s hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp trounced the opposition at the last election in but it has lost a handful of recent after opposition groups banded together
veteran politician ram vilas paswan a federal minister and the chief of the lok jan shakti people s power party which is allied with the bjp and says it represents india s socially backward classes predicted another term for modi
but he said the bjp would have to work towards changing its image as a group that caters mainly to hindus
whatever the government is doing it is doing for everyone even for the minority community it has done a lot paswan said in an interview in his bungalow seated on a couch under a huge oil painting of himself
but despite everything the perception is not changing among the minorities and the scheduled castes socially backward classes irrespective of the work being india s billion people are about percent hindu and percent muslim according to the latest census data
backward classes make up about of the hindu population
critics say the bjp s hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the population
since modi came to power in hardline hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows
many hindus believe cows are sacred and killing them is banned in most states
a crackdown on abattoirs tanneries and leather factories mostly run by muslims has also hit a large number of hindus who transport cattle and work in tanneries
paswan said the opposition could take advantage of the bjp s class hindu image and it needed to be countered aggressively
the bjp said paswan s comment was a observation from an ally but that the party has foiled repeated attempts of the opposition congress party to create an impression that the bjp is losing the perception battle
we need to be cognizant of the fact that opposition parties have been raising a bogey of but so far they ve failed said bjp spokesman
narasimha rao
when modi won office in his party or its partners ruled only seven of india s states
today it is in power in of them and has replaced congress as the party with strongest nationwide presence
but in for parliamentary seats since last year the bjp has lost all of them and two small regional parties have walked out of the ruling coalition
paswan whose party enjoys considerable support from the muslim community in his home state of bihar in the east said ending ties with the national democratic alliance nda was unthinkable
this is essentially a government of the bjp they have an absolute majority
still modi has given space to allies like us said paswan a member of parliament who began his political career in
can t even think of leaving the nda
