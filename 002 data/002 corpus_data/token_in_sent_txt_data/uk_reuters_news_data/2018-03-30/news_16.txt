update 3-u.s. judge dismisses exxon lawsuit to stop climate change probes
new york reuters a federal judge on thursday dismissed exxon mobil corp s lawsuit seeking to stop new york and massachusetts from probing whether the oil and gas company covered up its knowledge about climate change and lied to investors and the public about it
district judge valerie caproni in manhattan rejected as implausible exxon s argument that the states democratic attorneys general eric schneiderman and maura healey were pursuing politically motivated bad faith fraud investigations in order to violate its constitutional rights
caproni dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice meaning the irving company can not bring it again
exxon is evaluating its legal options spokesman scott silvestri said in an email
we believe the risk of climate change is real and we want to be part of the solution he added
we ve invested about billion on energy efficiency and technologies such as carbon capture and next generation the case is one of several including shareholder and employee lawsuits centered on whether exxon has for decades lied about climate change including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew
schneiderman in a statement welcomed the end of what he called exxon s frivolous nonsensical lawsuit that wrongfully attempted to thwart a serious state law enforcement healey called caproni s decision a turning point in our investigation and a victory for the exxon sued in june after receiving subpoenas seeking documents about its historical understanding of climate change and communications with interest groups and shareholders
the company accused schneiderman and healey of conspiring to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate violating its rights to free speech and due process and against unreasonable searches
much of exxon s case was based on a march news conference with the attorneys general and former vice president al gore which it called a bid to coerce its adoption of policies that they and climate change activists preferred
caproni however said nothing that was said can fairly be read to constitute declaration of a political vendetta against she said the belief by schneiderman and healey apparently shared by exxon that climate change is real does not mean they had no reason to believe exxon may have fraudulently sowed confusion to bolster its bottom line
nowhere she said did exxon suggest that the attorneys general believed the company was itself confused about the causes or risks of climate the case is exxon mobil corp et al v schneiderman et al district court southern district of new york no
