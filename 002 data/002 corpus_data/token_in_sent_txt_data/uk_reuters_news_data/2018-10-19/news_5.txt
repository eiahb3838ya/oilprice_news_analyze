the imf announced the deal hours after the government decided to raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter an outstanding imf requirement
ukraine s prime minister had warned the country was headed for default without an imf deal but the gas price hike triggered fierce criticism from opposition politicians giving a taste of the backlash that is likely to follow
the new agreement would span months and replaces the previous billion aid programme that has propped up ukraine s economy since
it is subject to ukraine passing a budget in line with the imf s requirements and the approval of the imf s executive board which is expected to take a decision later in the year the imf said
the new sba will provide an anchor for the authorities economic policies during an imf statement said

former prime minister yulia tymoshenko who hopes to unseat president petro poroshenko in next year s election called the price hike a genocide against the ukrainian people and asked for an emergency parliamentary debate
the imf joined efforts to rescue ukraine from economic crisis following russia s annexation of crimea in and the outbreak of a separatist insurgency
but imf aid had effectively been frozen since april as ukraine s performance on reforms slowed down and due to the government s refusal to raise gas prices kept artificially low since soviet times to market levels

one sticking point could be ukraine s plans for a change to how companies are taxed
