coronado mainly produces metallurgical coal with annual output of million tonnes from three mines and million tonnes from the curragh mine in australia which it bought from wesfarmers ltd in december for a million
that makes it one of the biggest metallurgical coal producers outside the big diversified miners competing with firm warrior met coal inc
it also produces million tonnes a year of steaming coal used for energy generation at curragh which it sells to the queensland state government s power producer stanwell corp
metallurgical coal prices are back where they were at the start of the year at around a tonne having jumped by percent from the start of august when they plumbed a low
but according to the ipo prospectus metallurgical coal prices are expected to decline in coming years due to new coal supply and lower chinese demand
the proceeds from the ipo will be used to repay debt and will help the private equity firm realise part of its investments
