update 1-pakistan's engro says "no obligation" to renegotiate lng contract
updates with additional comment background by asif shahzad and kay johnson islamabad oct reuters pakistani conglomerate engro corp ltd said on friday it had no obligation to renegotiate a contract with the government for imported liquefied natural gas lng a day after the new petroleum minister said it would seek new terms
a spokesman for engro said the total contract to process and supply up to million cubic feet of lng per day for years is currently worth about per day or about million per year
engro s stance sets up a potential conflict with the new government of prime minister imran khan who has promised to scrutinize for corruption all deals made by the previous administration of ousted premier nawaz sharif
engro said in a statement that the bidding for its karachi terminal pakistan s first was done in a auditable and transparent tender process
the terminal came into operation in
the government does not have a contractual right to its terms and we are accordingly under no obligation to renegotiate the same the firm said in a statement
it also said the government was miscalculating its net profits from the venture
petroleum minister ghulam sarwar khan said on thursday that the government would seek to renegotiate two lng terminal deals saying the previous government had agreed to pay too much
he cited a contractual clause allowing for renegotiation with mutual consent but hinted the government would take other action if engro refused
if they don t come to renegotiation then the further remedies that exist we will definitely avail them the minister said
he did not name the company involved in the second lng contract
it was unclear whether he was speaking of pakistan s other completed terminal or one of several new ones planned
the rapid adoption of lng infrastructure has made pakistan one of the industry s markets in asia sparking interest from the world s major energy producers and traders
it also helped ease electricity outages of up to hours per day that had crippled industry and disrupted daily life for the population of million people
prime minister khan however is scrutinizing the deals
while in opposition the former cricket star spearheaded a campaign accusing sharif of corruption that led to the supreme court removing him from office last year
sharif was convicted by an court and sentenced to years in prison in july just ahead of elections won by khan
the premier denies wrongdoing
sharif s former petroleum minister shahid khaqan abbasi who became prime minister after sharif was ousted is also under investigation by the state body over an unnamed lng deal
abbasi has denied any wrongdoing
sharif s party officials say the corruption cases are part of a conspiracy by the judiciary and military to bring down their previous government and discredit their leaders
the army and courts deny any interference in politics
