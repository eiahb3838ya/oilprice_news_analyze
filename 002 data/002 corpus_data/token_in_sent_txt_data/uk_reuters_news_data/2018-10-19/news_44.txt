update 1-ecuador expels venezuela ambassador after official says moreno lied
caracas reuters ecuador expelled venezuela s ambassador to quito on thursday after a venezuelan government minister called ecuadorean president lenin moreno a liar and venezuela reciprocated by ordering ecuador s top diplomat to go home
in a wednesday press conference venezuelan communication minister jorge rodriguez said moreno was a liar and accused him of exaggerating in a speech at the united nations the number of venezuelan migrants arriving in ecuador
saying the comments were offensive ecuador expelled the venezuelan ambassador and called its charge d affaires at its embassy in caracas back for consultations its foreign ministry said in a statement
venezuela later declared the charge d affaires elizabeth méndez persona non grata and gave her hours to leave the country in what its foreign ministry described as a reciprocal measure according to a statement read on state television
ecuador s highest representative in venezuela has been the charge
the ambassador position has been vacant for more than a year because of diplomatic disputes
as many as million venezuelans have emigrated since according to the united nations fleeing an economic crisis that has resulted in shortages of food medicine and other basic goods
that flow has overwhelmed other countries in the region including ecuador
socialist president nicolas maduro has said no more than venezuelans left in the past two years and state television gives daily coverage to a government programme offering migrants free flights back to venezuela
