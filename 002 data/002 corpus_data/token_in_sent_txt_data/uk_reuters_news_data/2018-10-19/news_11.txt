group led by edp renewables to invest in floating wind farm
lisbon oct reuters a consortium led by portugal s edp renewables edpr will invest million euros million over three years in a megawatt mw floating offshore wind farm edpr s principal shareholder energias de portugal said on friday
the project europe s second floating wind farm involves anchoring three turbines on platforms at water depths of up to metres
the wind farm will be in the atlantic about km miles off the coast of viana de castelo in northern portugal
the farm s total capacity of mw will be enough to power homes for a year
the turbines each with mw capacity will be the most powerful turbines installed on a floating base at sea the company said
this is an absolutely pioneering and innovative project for renewable offshore energy energias de portugal ceo antonio mexia said in a presentation
the consortium which includes spain s repsol has spent million euros testing the platforms for two years
the tests showed the technology known as windfloat could withstand waves up to metres high
the european investment bank eib is providing million euros of the funding for the new wind farm
offshore floating wind farms are an attractive alternative energy source because they open up areas of deep ocean to harness energy unlike fixed offshore wind turbines that need to be installed in shallower coastal waters
norway s equinor formerly known as statoil launched the world s first floating wind farm last year off the scottish coast with capacity of mw
it has said floating turbines could be used in areas where the sea was up to metres deep
