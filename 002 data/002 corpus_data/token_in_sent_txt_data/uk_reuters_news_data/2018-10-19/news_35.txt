update 1-china ministry says coal region lacks "will" to fight pollution
shanghai reuters china s environment ministry on friday called out officials in a northwestern coal producing zone for lacking the will to fight pollution the latest region to come under scrutiny in beijing s war on smog
in its latest review of how regions are complying with tougher pollution laws the ministry of ecology and environment singled out ningxia for criticism on the day china said the country s coal output hit its highest in nine months in september
some districts and departments in ningxia did not have the will or confidence to control pollution inspectors said in a report in the china environment news a ministry publication
they said ningxia s economic and trade commission had submitted reports alleging that environmental protection was a burden on industrial growth
the commission blamed a tougher smog control and inspection regime for a slowdown in industrial activity despite what inspectors said were obvious errors in the commission s data
they the commission tried to get rid of their responsibility and interfere with decision making the inspectors said
ningxia a poor and region wants to exploit its reserves of coal and export electricity through a power grid
but it has been forced to shut down small coal mines and millions of tonnes of annual production capacity in sectors like steel and aluminum since a national campaign began in
ningxia is the latest region to be chastised by the environment ministry for failing to enforce measures
three cities in jiangsu were accused this week of exaggerating coal consumption cuts last year
hebei the biggest steel producing region came under fire on thursday with inspectors criticizing some officials for not rectifying previous failings in controlling pollution
hebei s dependence on fossil fuels remained high with coal accounting for percent of the province s primary energy consumption percentage points higher than the national average the ministry said
officials have faced some form of punishment as a result of the latest round of poor environmental reviews
in the three regions reported so far officials were held responsible for violations of which were reprimanded and detained
the region is one of china s most industrialized with hebei province producing nearly a quarter of the country s steel
it has been on the front line of the country s war on pollution for more than four years
the region is about to embark on another tough winter campaign against smog with inspectors set to force industrial factories to curb output if they have not done enough to clean up their operations
vice premier han zheng said on thursday authorities must ensure residents have enough heating this winter even as thousands of households switch from coal to cleaner natural gas
han who leads a committee to tackle pollution in the region said it was absolutely forbidden to dismantle boilers and leave households without a source of heat the xinhua news agency said
parts of the region were left without heating last year after governments demolished boilers but failed to secure enough natural gas as a replacement fuel
hebei was home to four of china s cities with the poorest air quality according to data for the first nine months of
that is down from six cities in
