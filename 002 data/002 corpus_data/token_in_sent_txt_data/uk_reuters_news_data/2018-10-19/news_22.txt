column-low u.s. gas market stocks tempered by mild el niño forecast: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london oct reuters natural gas stocks are going into winter at the lowest level for fifteen years despite a slightly faster rate of injections into storage over the summer than in or
low inventories have encouraged hedge funds to build their largest position in futures and options for more than eight years and pushed benchmark prices to their highest level for almost nine months
but pressure on stocks and prices is being tempered by the development of el niño conditions over the pacific which should lead to a relatively mild winter for much of the country
higher prices will encourage power producers to run units for fewer hours in the coming weeks and increase generation from coal which has been languishing at lows
the resulting switch from gas to coal should help boost gas stocks faster than normal in the remainder of the injection season and limit drawdowns in the early stages of the winter heating season conserving scarce stocks
if the winter starts with prolonged cold periods in november and december however the gas market could come under severe pressure with prices spiking
working gas stocks in underground storage reached billion cubic feet bcf on according to the energy information administration weekly natural gas storage report eia
stocks have risen by bcf since the injection season started on april compared with increases of bcf in and bcf in
even so gas stocks are the lowest level since and the market has struggled to eliminate the deficit to the average that developed during the long cold winter of
until a few weeks ago most traders appeared unconcerned by low inventories and benchmark futures prices were stuck below until the final week of september
since then hedge funds and other money managers have turned strongly bullish increasing their net long position in futures and options by nearly bcf over the last three weeks
portfolio managers net long position is the highest for weeks according to position records published by the commodity futures trading commission
fund managers now hold more than five bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices for every bearish short position the most lopsided bullish ratio for more than eight years
the accompanying jump in gas prices should encourage owners of generation units to conserve fuel stocks
prices would probably have jumped even further but for the relatively mild winter being forecast for as a result of el niño conditions developing over the pacific
the government puts the probability of el niño developing by the end of the year at around percent
el niño typically brings warmer temperatures into the northern united states but colder wetter and stormier weather in the south
in a mild el niño which this one seems likely to be the weather impact can be masked by other developments relationships between climate variability and winter temperature extremes in the united states higgins et al
nonetheless the government is forecasting average or temperatures across the entire country this winter winter outlook favours warmer temperatures for much of the noaa
the gas market is now delicately poised between low stocks and the likelihood of a winter that it is warmer than average and warmer than either or
lopsided bullish hedge fund positioning in natural gas poses the main downside price risk if fund managers try to realise some of their profits and close out some of their positions
on the other hand the market is relying on a relatively mild winter to eke out the meagre inventories so any period of prolonged cold could send prices sharply higher
