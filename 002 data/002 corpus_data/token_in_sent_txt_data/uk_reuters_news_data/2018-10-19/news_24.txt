carrots could be key to making greener buildings, say researchers
london oct reuters crunchy and tasty yes but could carrots also strengthen cement and cut carbon dioxide emissions for the building industry
a group of researchers at britain s lancaster university has been using a household food blender to mix particles from the root vegetable with concrete to see if they can produce a stronger and more environmentally sound product
we found out you could increase the strength of concrete by percent by using a small amount of this new material lead researcher mohamed saafi told reuters
the addition of carrots prevent any cracks in the concrete the team said
it also means less cement is required therefore lowering the global carbon dioxide output
cement is responsible for seven percent of total global emissions according to international energy agency estimates
our preliminary results show that adding about half a kilogram of carrot nanomaterial will reduce about kilograms of cement per one cubic metre of concrete saafi said
the team have also tried sugar beet fibres in cement mixtures with all their vegetables coming from food waste
they will continue to test their mixtures alongside their commercial partners a scottish company which makes paint using root vegetable fibres
