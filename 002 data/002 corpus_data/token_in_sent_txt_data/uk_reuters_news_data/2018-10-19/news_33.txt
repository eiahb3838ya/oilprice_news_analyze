update 1-uk should bring forward new petrol and diesel car ban to 2032 â€“ lawmakers
london reuters britain should bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by eight years to to help the country reduce its greenhouse gas emissions a parliamentary committee said on friday
britain hopes to become a world leader in electric vehicle technology and currently plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from as a part of efforts to meet its climate targets
if we are serious about being ev electric vehicle world leaders the government must come forward with a target of new sales of cars and vans to be zero emission by said rachel reeves chair of the business energy and industrial strategy committee which authored the report
the report said the country should improve incentives for the uptake of electric vehicles and criticised a recent decision to cut grants for new hybrid electric vehicles from november
it also said the country s infrastructure to allow for the charging of electric vehicles was not fit for purpose
the government needs to get a grip and lead on coordinating the financial support and technical necessary for local authorities to promote this infrastructure and help ensure that electric cars are an attractive option for consumers reeves said
britain has around charging points but will need this to increase to at least by a report from data company emu analytics said in may
britain s energy industry association energy uk backed the call for an earlier start to the ban
we firmly support the committee s call for greater ambition and believe that an accelerated timetable for the roll out of electric vehicles evs is both desirable and feasible it said
however britain s society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt said the ban was already ambitious and said meeting the target earlier would be almost impossible
zero emission vehicles make up just percent of the market meaning consumer appetite would have to grow by some percent in just over a decade
this is unrealistic smmt chief executive mike hawes said in a statement
