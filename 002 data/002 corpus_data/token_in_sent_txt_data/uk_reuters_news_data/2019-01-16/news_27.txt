india's soymeal sales to iran surge to offset rupees-for-oil imbalance
iran buys soymeal with rupees received from oil sales india s exports seen at t vs t yr ago soybean prices jump on demand makes soymeal expensive by rajendra jadhav mumbai jan reuters india s soymeal sales to iran are set to spike as the oil producer uses the rupees it receives for its crude exports to cover its animal feed demand amid sanctions that have crimped the country s ability to import necessities
iran has agreed to sell crude oil to india the world s oil consumer in exchange for rupees after sanctions imposed by the united states blocked its access to the global financial system
the country must spend those rupees on indian goods and iran does not produce enough of the soymeal domestically
higher meal exports will support indian soybean prices and limit the complaints from farmers that had demanded relief from low prices from the government which faces elections by may
india s soymeal exports to iran could jump to tonnes during the fiscal year ending in march up from just tonnes during the previous fiscal year mehta executive director of the solvent extractors association sea a industry body for oilseed processors said this week
exports could rise to tonnes during the next fiscal year if the sanctions remain he added
iran has started buying aggressively due to the sanctions and it seems demand will remain there in coming months said mehta
india started paying iran for oil imports in rupees after receiving a waiver from the sanctions that started in november
india wants to continue buying oil from iran since it offers free shipping and an extended credit period while iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for indian exports
iran is paying a premium of as much as percent compared to other buyers since the country was struggling to secure soymeal from other sellers and keen to use oil payments said an exporter based at indore in central indian state of madhya pradesh
we have to charge a premium as many times payments get delayed he said
during the previous sanctions india settled percent of its iranian oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros
but this time new delhi wanted to make all payments in rupees to reduce its trade deficit with iran
local soybean prices have jumped percent in just three weeks as oil mills started procuring the oilseed to fulfill the export orders for iran
however soymeal prices have also jumped and made indian exports less lucrative for traditional buyers such as south korea thailand vietnam and bangladesh
indian soymeal was available at about per tonne on a fob basis compared to for south american supplies said a dealer with a global trading firm
in coming months thailand and vietnam are likely to switch to brazil and argentina
their supplies are cheaper even after factoring in higher freight cost the dealer said
still india s soymeal exports could jump percent in the fiscal year to million tonnes estimates the sea s mehta
