democrats to grill trump's new epa chief pick over past lobbying
washington jan reuters democratic lawmakers will grill president donald trump s new pick to run the environmental protection agency on wednesday over his past coal lobbying but have little hope of blocking his confirmation in the senate
trump nominated epa acting administrator andrew wheeler to run the agency permanently last week a pick that could provide him another avid supporter of his deregulatory and fuels agenda without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that plagued wheeler s predecessor scott pruitt
a washington insider with years experience as a top aide to republican senator and climate skeptic jim inhofe wheeler has been running the epa since july when pruitt resigned in a flurry of criticism over his expensive travel and use of resources and staff for personal matters
democrats on the senate environment and public works committee running wednesday s confirmation hearing said they would press wheeler on his past lobbying which includes work for underground coal giant murray energy a vocal proponent for reduced environmental and safety regulation
they are also likely to needle wheeler about his record so far at epa which has largely been a follow through on pruitt s moves to undo or weaken environmental regulations including on power plant pollutant emissions
i urged him to restore public trust in the agency by heeding lessons of the past and by remedying some of scott pruitt s most egregious actions and proposals
he has not done so said senator tom carper the top democrat on the committee
industry representatives and republican lawmakers however have largely praised wheeler for his deregulatory stance arguing the epa has for years imposed requirements on businesses that have hurt growth
he understands how the regulatory process works and the type of effort that is required to develop effective and legally defensible regulatory reforms said jeff holmstead a partner at industry law firm bracewell and former epa air administrator
environmental groups including moms clean air force an organization that advocates for children s environmental health plan to attend wednesday s hearing in protest
dominique browning a member of the group wrote in a new york times on monday that wheeler should not be entrusted with protecting us from harm and that his recent move to weaken mercury limits by downplaying their benefits was harmful
