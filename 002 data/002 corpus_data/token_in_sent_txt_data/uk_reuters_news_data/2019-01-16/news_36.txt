norway's northernmost oil find could start production in 2026 -omv
sandefjord norway jan reuters austria s omv and partners plan to invest up to billion initially to develop the arctic wisting oil find norway s northernmost oil discovery which could start production within a decade a senior executive said on wednesday
omv owns a percent stake in the wisting license and the other stakeholders are norway s equinor norwegian firm petoro and japan s idemitsu
omv said on monday that the recoverable resource estimate of the find had increased to million barrels of oil from million barrels previously after drilling of an appraisal well at the site in
knut mauseth head of omv s norwegian subsidiary told reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference on wednesday that the group plans an initial investment of billion norwegian crowns bln to develop the find
trade publication was first to report the preliminary cost estimate
wisting is norway s northernmost oilfield located kilometres miles north of the nordic country s mainland
mauseth said a floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel would be used as a production facility and oil from the field would be exported from the field by tankers
a decision on the type of fpso would be taken in with production expected to start in he said
the norwegian government is keen for oil firms to develop new oil and gas in the barents sea and is considering building an oil terminal on mainland norway to handle oil exports from offshore fields
mauseth however said omv did not believe a terminal would be economically viable
if it makes sense we are prepared to consider that but so far the numbers haven t been favourable it s not economic to do it that way he told reuters
on other projects omv plans this year to drill one appraisal well at its gas and condensate discovery in the norwegian sea one of the largest finds off norway in mauseth said
the discovery near the morvin field so far is estimated to hold billion cubic metres of gas and million cubic metres million barrels of condensate
the norwegian petroleum directorate the state agency managing the nordic country s oil and gas resources said the discovery was expected to have a significant upside
if it the appraisal well provides good news then we have another development project mauseth said
