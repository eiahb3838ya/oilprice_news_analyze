update 1-u.s. automakers push for deal on fuel efficiency rules
detroit reuters executives at the major automakers are pressing the trump administration and california to agree on standards for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions through as risks increase that a deadline for setting national standards will pass without a deal
automakers are already entering the time frame when decisions should be made about what engines and technology such as hybrids or fully electric cars will be in use in and beyond executives said
in august the trump administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at levels through and stripping california of the ability to impose stricter rules
the administration may also eliminate compliance credits that automakers get for making electric vehicles
a group of about states led by california has challenged the administration proposal as unlawful and promised to sue if federal regulators move forward with the freeze
trump s proposed freeze would result in barrels per day more oil consumption by the
the administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than billion billion pounds over the next decade
at a hearing wednesday
senator tom carper a democrat said he had heard that the trump administration now plans to finalise a percent annual increase in the stringency of the standards a rate that is times weaker than the current carper said that will only lead to extensive litigation and uncertainty for automakers
that s not a outcome
it s a several automakers said they have heard the administration could finalise an increase ranging from no increase to percent per year but nothing has been finalised
epa administrator nominee andrew wheeler said at the hearing he was still pushing for an agreement
nobody wants a deal more than i do wheeler said
the administration is supposed to finalise the new rules by the end of march in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the model year but some automakers and officials question if it will meet that deadline in the wake of the partial government shutdown
most automakers oppose freezing the requirements but also want relief from standards that called for a roughly percent annual reduction in carbon emissions targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles
pick the middle
pick percent and get on with life jim lentz chief executive officer of toyota motor corp s north america subsidiary told reuters at the detroit auto show this week
lentz told reuters last month he was concerned that automakers are stuck between california and the white house
i kind of feel like this is the ok corral and we re the settlers walking across the middle lentz said
ford motor co which floated a compromise proposal last year to other automakers is still pushing for a deal executive chairman bill ford told reuters
we ve been very clear and very open that we want one national standard we want california at the table ford said
we re not asking for a rollback but we ve got to get everybody at the table especially detroit automakers have the most at stake
general motors co ford and fiat chrysler automobiles nv generate most of their global profits from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the united states
all three have discontinued or planned to drop small and sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and suvs
trucks are front and centre at the detroit auto show where fiat chrysler s ram brand exhibit displays a gleaming ram power wagon heavy duty truck on a pedestal and gm s gmc brand features its newly redesigned sierra denali luxury pickup line
but asian automakers that have more efficient fleets are also seeking a middle ground
henio arcangeli a senior vice president at the unit of honda motor co ltd said without a national deal the consumer s going to mitch bainwol who heads the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing major automakers said a deal makes the most sense but time is running out
a successful negotiation is a win for everyone more carbon reduction for california a stronger and economic context for the administration and common sense certainty for our reporting by david shepardson in detroit
