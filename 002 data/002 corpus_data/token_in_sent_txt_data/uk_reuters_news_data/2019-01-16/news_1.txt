update 4-'not the greatest crisis': trump's epa pick downplays climate threat
washington reuters president donald trump s new pick to run the environmental protection agency told lawmakers on wednesday he does not believe climate change is a major crisis and would continue to undo emission limits if confirmed
trump nominated epa acting administrator andrew wheeler last week to run the agency permanently seeking a strong advocate for his fuels agenda a choice that cheered business interests and drawn scorn from environmentalists
i would not call it the greatest crisis wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when asked if he believed the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats from global warming
wheeler s confirmation is expected to sail through the senate despite democratic opposition
a washington insider with years of experience he has been running the epa since july when his predecessor scott pruitt resigned in a flurry of criticism over his use of resources and staff for personal matters
democratic lawmakers focused on wheeler s record at epa his past lobbying work for energy companies and his stance on global warming casting him as a extremist not fit to run the nation s top environmental regulator
democrat senator ed markey of massachusetts and senator bernie sanders of vermont an independent who caucuses with democrats asked wheeler his view of global warming which scientists say is driven by fossil fuels consumption and is leading to sea level rise and more frequent flooding wildfires and extreme weather
wheeler said he believed global warming is an important issue that needs to be addressed but that federal regulation forcing deep emissions cuts was the wrong approach and more faith should be put in the hands of states and private enterprise
you are putting up a smokescreen to ensure there is an advancement of donald trump s dirty policies markey said in one of the hearing s most heated exchanges
that s why it is relevant that you are a former coal industry a federal report written by government agencies late last year said climate change will cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production
trump who has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change and has indicated his intention to withdraw from a global pact to fight it dismissed the report after its release saying i don t believe it
wheeler said he had been briefed on the assessment but was waiting for further briefings from his staff before taking a public position on its findings
wheeler defended his record at epa which has been largely defined by moves to undo or weaken environmental regulations
he cast the agency s rollbacks as a way to reduce the regulatory burden on business while also protecting air and water quality for americans
among his accomplishments wheeler last year finalized a proposal to replace federal curbs on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with a new rule placing much of that power in the hands of states
he has also overseen the epa s gutting of the justification for mercury emissions limits a proposal to reduce the number of waterways under federal protection and efforts to lower targets for vehicle fuel efficiency
democrats pressed wheeler on whether his epa work was in any way linked to his previous lobbying on behalf of energy companies like underground coal giant murray energy a vocal proponent of reduced environmental and safety regulation
senator sheldon whitehouse a rhode island democrat held up photos of wheeler attending meetings between murray s chief executive robert murray and trump administration officials and asked wheeler for a full accounting of the number of such meetings he had arranged for the coal company
wheeler said he would provide a written response
industry representatives and republican lawmakers have largely praised wheeler for his deregulatory stance
he understands how the regulatory process works and the type of effort that is required to develop effective and legally defensible regulatory reforms said jeff holmstead a partner at law firm bracewell and a former epa air administrator
environmental groups have taken a different view
activists briefly interrupted wheeler s testimony on wednesday shouting shut down wheeler not the epa and several were arrested after demonstrating outside the hearing room
