croatian lng terminal to go ahead despite low demand
zagreb jan reuters croatia will press on with a planned floating liquefied natural gas lng terminal project in the northern adriatic despite a low number of binding bids from gas buyers energy minister tomislav coric said on wednesday
croatia is trying to diversify its energy sources but late last year received few bids for the use of the lng terminal on the northern adriatic island of krk which cast some doubt over its viability
it is a strategic project and is being implemented within that context
it is planned to be used by several countries not just croatia and is part of the european union plans to diversify energy sources coric told the parliament while answering a deputy s question
he did not elaborate on how the government planned to financially support the lng terminal which is tentatively seen as starting operations from the beginning of
the floating terminal has a planned capacity of billion cubic metres bcm of gas per year while croatia received binding bids amounting to bcm
coric also said croatia had also received the letters of intent for use of the terminal from some hungarian companies
the terminal is being partially financed by the european union as part of eu efforts to diversify away from russian energy imports
the targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern europe
the value of the terminal is seen at million euros million with the eu providing just over million euros
the rest was originally planned to be financed on commercial terms
croatia annually consumes gas volumes slightly higher than the terminal s planned capacity
domestic production which has fallen in recent years accounts for slightly more than percent of the country s requirements
