failure to curb climate change a top risk - davos survey
washington reuters the risk that global efforts to tackle climate change will fail has risen despite concerns about powerful storms floods and droughts a survey released by the world economic forum said on wednesday days before its annual gathering in davos
the annual global risks report which incorporates the survey highlighted several top risks for including massive incidents of data fraud and theft and large scale cyberattacks
but the top risk by likelihood in the survey was extreme weather in a survey of experts from government business academia and organizations
and the risk that failure by governments to limit the magnitude of climate change and adapt to it has risen to second place in terms of both likelihood and impact compared to only fifth place and fourth place in those categories last year in the survey
of all risks it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe said the report
after countries including the united states agreed to tackle climate change in at talks in paris worries in the survey about governmental failure to tackle global warming fell
but that has changed after president donald trump announced in his intention to pull out of the paris agreement a move he emphasized in
in addition deadly wildfires in greece and california and hurricanes in florida and north carolina were frequently in the news
people are beginning to understand increasingly the gravity of the situation and that the paris agreement even if fully implemented can not be seen as a panacea aengus collins the report s author and project leader told reuters
the intergovernmental panel on climate change in october said global temperatures are likely to rise by degrees celsius between and if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures
and emissions of carbon dioxide spiked percent last year after falling for the previous three the rhodium group an independent research group said last week
trump who attended last year s talks in davos plans to send treasury secretary steven mnuchin and secretary of state mike pompeo to the talks that begin as he grapples with democrats over a partial government shutdown
the report said rapidly growing coastal cities particularly in asia are making people more vulnerable to climate change
a vicious circle of urbanization concentrates people and buildings in areas of potential damage while also increasing risks by destroying natural sources of resilience such as mangrove forests or increasing strain on groundwater reserves it said
