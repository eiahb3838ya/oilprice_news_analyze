the ets has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis but this will be addressed by new measures including the market stability reserve which from this year will remove some surplus allowances from the market
as is the first year of the operation of the market stability reserve msr this will be still the most important factor impacting the carbon market said sandrine ferrand analyst at engie global markets
analysts at berenberg who had the most bullish forecasts said the msr will lead to a deficit of million tonnes of carbon permits in
and this is not a year the eu ets system has just begun a decade of deficits said berenberg analyst lawson steele
in the shorter term however several analysts warned that prices now around will be volatile due to uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union
british lawmakers voted on tuesday against prime minister theresa may s brexit deal leaving the country no clearer on its exit plan and with the government facing a no confidence vote later on wednesday
