adnoc awards wintershall pct in ghasha for years deal aimed at unlocking reserves wintershall has first exploration production licences due in adds frankfurt dateline additional details from wintershall context nov reuters abu dhabi national oil co adnoc and germany s wintershall said on monday they would develop offshore gas and condensate fields as wintershall widens its regional focus and the uae firm benefits from its partner s experience in sour gas
wintershall said it had signed a deal to acquire a percent stake in the ghasha concession in abu dhabi with investments running into billions of dollars
this would be alongside adnoc as operator and italy s eni which was awarded a percent stake earlier this month
contracts to develop the deposits were awarded for years
the deal builds on adnoc s new integrated gas strategy aimed at unlocking value from abu dhabi s reserves as the united arab emirates moves towards gas wintershall cited adnoc chief executive sultan as saying
wintershall has extensive experience of appraising and developing gas resources in technically complex fields he said
wintershall has more than years experience in production from sour gas fields in germany
sour gas is a hydrocarbon that is now mostly exhausted in germany where wintershall has produced billion cubic metres of it and built four gas purification plants
in the middle east mass production of sweet gas which does not need cleansing used to be the norm
the partners envisage producing more than million cubic metres per day from around the middle of the next decade when the project could supply gas for electricity for over million homes
once completed the project could also produce over barrels of oil per day
wintershall a subsidiary of chemicals company basf has been present in the uae since
apart from the middle east it also has operations in europe russia latin america and north africa
european gas resources are falling in the long term and libya s oil output has been eroded by years of armed conflict and political turmoil prompting wintershall to emphasise gas over oil as well as new regions
wintershall is merging with sector peer dea
as for the ghasha project the first exploration and production licences for six oil and gas blocks are expected to be awarded in the first quarter of adnoc said last week
