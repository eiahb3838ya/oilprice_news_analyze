eu progress on renewable energy, efficiency targets slows - eea
london reuters the european union s progress towards increasing the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency is slowing putting its ability to meet its and targets at risk the european environment agency eea said on monday
rising energy consumption particularly in transport is to blame for the slowdown the eea said in an annual report on eu efforts on its renewables and energy efficiency targets
renewable energy such as wind and solar accounted for a percent share of gross final energy consumption in the eu last year according to the eea s preliminary data up from percent in
this indicates that the eu remains on track to reach its target of a renewables share of percent by although the report said the pace of growth had slowed
the agency said there was insufficient progress towards a percent target for renewables use in transport by
with approaching the trajectories needed to meet the national targets are becoming steeper
increased energy consumption and persisting market barriers are hindering the uptake of renewables in several member states the report said
preliminary eea data for showed member states were on track to reach their individual targets on renewable energy by a decline from when countries were on track
on energy efficiency both primary and final energy consumption were above the trajectory needed towards
the continued growth in energy consumption particularly in transport but also in other sectors made achieving the target increasingly uncertain the report said
the eu also has new targets for but the report said current trends would not be enough to reach them and additional and more ambitious efforts would be needed in the coming decade
by the end of this year member states must submit the first draft of their national energy and climate plans to help them achieve targets for
