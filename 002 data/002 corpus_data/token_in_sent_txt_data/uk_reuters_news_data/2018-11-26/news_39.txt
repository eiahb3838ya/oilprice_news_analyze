norway eyes offshore wind to power nyhamna gas processing plant
oslo nov reuters norwegian gas system operator gassco and canadian energy firm enbridge are working on reviving a megawatt mw offshore wind project to boost power supply security at norway s nyhamna gas processing plant they told reuters
the project which would be the country s first offshore wind farm is called havsul and was fully licensed by norwegian energy regulators in before being abandoned in due to profitability concerns and insufficient subsidies
nyhamna is one of norway s biggest gas processing plants handling output from shell s ormen lange field
its capacity was raised to million cubic meters mcm per day this year to accommodate gas from the aasta hansteen field
however the plant s power supply is fed by a single grid line the fragility of which has caused outages in recent years affecting exports to britain
gassco spokeswoman lisbet kallevik said the company was undertaking a technical study for enbridge evaluating the possibility of a of havsul to the nyhamna plant
the study was expected to be completed by spring
the windmill project will if decided secure power supply for the nyhamna processing plant and the region for years to come she said
the additional capacity at nyhamna means the need for a reliable power supply is increasing but discussions to upgrade the power line between gassco and state grid statnett have failed to produced results
havsul with a capacity to produce about terawatt hour twh of electricity annually would not only benefit the gas plant but also feed the local grid enbridge told reuters
our intention is to enter into a commercial agreement with nyhamna gas processing facility to supply a dedicated source of renewable electricity also enhancing security of supply for the facility and local grid spokeswoman mandy dinning said adding the partners would only be able to reach a final investment decision after
initially havsul was part of a larger plan to construct three offshore wind farms with around megawatts capacity but norway s regulator rejected the other farms
the estimated cost for havsul was up to billion crowns million at the time of its licensing
since then the project s rights have changed ownership twice with enbridge securing its licenses earlier this year
however development costs for offshore wind have fallen since havsul was abandoned in while norway said last year it would offer some concessions for such projects
