column-oil market power ebbs from opec to the troika: kemp
london reuters the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has been marginalised as critical decisions about the oil market are taken by a troika of the united states russia and saudi arabia
the rise and subsequent fall in oil prices this year has been almost entirely driven by production decisions in these three countries and their policies towards managing the impact of renewed sanctions on iran
the troika accounted for million barrels per day of crude and condensates production in percent of the global total compared with just million bpd from the rest of opec percent of the global total
troika production has surged even further this year as shale firms ramped up output in response to higher prices while russia and saudi arabia relaxed production curbs put in place at the end of
output from the troika is the element in global oil supplies which will likely push its share above percent in while the rest of opec falls below percent statistical review of world energy bp
production decisions made in the troika tend to determine whether the oil market will be or in the short to medium term while other opec and countries watch from the sidelines
the rest of opec is struggling under sanctions mismanagement and unrest is too small to matter is maximising production rather than participating in output controls or simply aligns its output policies with those of saudi arabia
the only opec member that operates an independent production policy and has been able to increase its output significantly in has been iraq
in this context it is not surprising that the distinction between opec and members has become increasingly blurred and shifted outside the organisation
discussion and analysis have moved away from opec s ministerial conference to the joint ministerial monitoring committee jmmc which blends opec and members
the jmmc contains two leading producers russia and oman and just four opec countries saudi arabia kuwait algeria and venezuela plus the opec president currently the united arab emirates
the jmmc s membership is a tacit admission that russia and to a lesser extent oman play a more important role in production policy than most opec members
dividing oil production into opec and has become an obsolete way of analysing the oil market
a better approach recognises a hierarchy of with varying degrees of freedom and importance
the inner core of consists of saudi arabia and russia which have closely coordinated their output policy during and act as the de facto leaders of opec and respectively
next comes the united states which is not in opec and lacks a unified production policy but has a decisive influence on oil supplies and prices through its rapidly growing shale output and sanctions
decisions about the severity of sanctions including scope enforcement and waivers give the united states significant influence less than saudi arabia and russia but more than other opec and members
the united states has acted as a third member of the troika even though it is formally forbidden by law from coordinating production policy domestically or with foreign countries
recognising their joint influence policymakers from saudi arabia russia and the united states have regularly briefed one another about production decisions and sanctions in
and the president of the united states has expressed strong and clear views about the appropriate level of oil prices and exerted pressure on saudi arabia
the third level of the hierarchy consists of opec members kuwait and the united arab emirates and oman which have proved willing to adjust their production under saudi and russian leadership
the troika plus kuwait the uae and oman account for almost half of global liquids production
the fourth level consists of iraq which has also to some extent coordinated its production policy with saudi arabia and russia but retained much more independence
the fifth and final level consists of all other opec and producers which essentially maximise their output and are not part of the production control system
in this hierarchical system production policy is driven by initial consultations between saudi arabia and russia paying due attention to the diplomatic requirements and anticipated output reactions of the united states
kuwait the uae oman and later iraq are then brought on board followed eventually by the rest of opec and allies
in this hierarchy only saudi arabia russia and the united states are genuinely independent actors while kuwait the uae oman and iraq are important followers
other opec and members are largely inconsequential in terms of and production outcomes
iran which was a founder member of opec and its important member through the has been pushed out of the process by sanctions
iran s exclusion from membership of the jmmc is symptomatic of its marginalisation within opec and the wider oil market
in this new system the locus of has shifted from the opec conference in vienna to the periodic meetings of the jmmc and bilateral briefings among ministers
in saudi arabia and russia took the critical decision to start increasing output in bilateral discussions held well before it was formally ratified by the opec conference and then countries in june
under pressure saudi arabia backed by russia kuwait the uae and oman decided to raise output further in september again outside the formal opec framework
experienced observers expect the next round of critical production decisions will be taken at least in outline form at this week s group of meeting in buenos aires rather than at opec s formal conference next month
top political leaders from all members of the troika will attend the with their senior economic and energy advisers
for the oil market it looks like the real opec meeting will come a week ahead of schedule according to javier blas chief energy correspondent at bloomberg
the cartel is set to meet on in vienna but days earlier the key decision makers are set to gather on the sidelines of the summit blas notes
it provides an opportunity for leaders and their ministers to reach an understanding about the preferred direction of prices next year as oil plunges the real opec meeting will be at next week s bloomberg
oil policy is increasingly driven by the political and diplomatic priorities of saudi arabia s de facto leader crown prince mohammed bin salman mbs russia s president vladimir putin and president donald trump
the triangle sets the political context with operational decisions left to energy ministers and officials how strongmen play their cards will determine next move for oil financial times
as the balance of power has shifted away from historically important producers such as iran nigeria and venezuela so the focus of has also flowed into new channels
as power shifts to the troika and its closest allies the opec conference and its have become a theatrical stage rather than where the real decisions are taken
