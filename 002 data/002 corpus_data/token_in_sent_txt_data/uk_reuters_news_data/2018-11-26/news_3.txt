update 2-iran nuclear chief warns of unpredictable consequences if deal breaks down
brussels reuters iran s nuclear chief warned the european union on monday of ominous consequences if it did not follow through with action to keep the economic benefits of the nuclear agreement alive
ali akbar salehi said the european union was doing its best after the united states pulled out of the deal and sanctions on iranian oil exports this month even as the bloc s efforts to salvage trade ties have floundered
but salehi the head of iran s atomic energy organization told reporters in brussels if words are not turned into deeds then it is very ominous the situation would be the eu and other remaining parties to the accord china and russia hope to convince tehran to respect the curbs that the deal placed on its nuclear programme despite washington s and the its sanctions that aim to force the rest of the world to stop buying iranian oil
striving to circumvent those sanctions eu nations plan to facilitate transactions with iran
a special purpose vehicle spv would act as a barter system offseting iranian exports with purchases of eu goods
speaking on the sidelines of talks on civilian nuclear cooperation eu diplomats admitted they could only do so much to urge firms to brave the risk of penalties and do business with iran
what we are doing now is a lot of symbolism said one eu diplomat involved in talks with iran
the spv isn t going to be a game changer said another eu official
the prospects are pretty no eu country has yet agreed to host the spv and progress in creating it is likely to be slow despite the political will in paris berlin and london
this is a hugely complex and unique undertaking technical work has been advancing europe s climate and energy commissioner miguel arias canete said at a joint briefing with salehi
nobody should have any doubt on the level of political ambition and determination by the member states involved in particular france germany and the united kingdom to swiftly operationalise the reporting by alissa de carbonnel and jan strupczewski editing by robin pomeroy
