by clyde russell launceston australia nov reuters president donald trump has boasted that falling crude prices are like a tax cut for the world however motorists in much of asia have yet to pocket substantial savings from the recent rout in oil markets
since its closing peak of a barrel on brent crude has tumbled percent to end at on
this decline has been matched by the price of gasoline in singapore which was down by percent from its peak of a barrel on to on
however the retail price of gasoline in major asian countries has fallen by significantly smaller margins
the pump price of gasoline in india s capital new delhi was rupees a litre on according to price monitoring website
this is down percent from the peak of rupees on illustrating that the sharp decline in crude and gasoline prices has yet to filter through to consumers
however the above calculation doesn t factor in the impact of fuel taxes which in india are about of the retail price
excluding taxes from the price reveals a slightly larger percent drop in the untaxed component of india s gasoline price from the october peak until
australia s national average gasoline price has dropped by about percent from a peak of a a litre in the week to to a in the week to according to data from the australian institute of petroleum
australia s fuel taxes are about the same percentage as those in india meaning there has been a slightly larger drop in the untaxed component of the fuel price but still nothing close to the plunge in brent
china which has a managed system for retail fuel prices has seen a lower drop than india and australia with gasoline falling percent to yuan a litre in the week ended according to data on the website
it s likely that retail gasoline prices will drop in those countries in coming weeks but it would be unlikely that they fall by as much as motorists might hope for given the slump in crude
asian refiners are already struggling to make any money producing gasoline with the profit margin or crack for making a barrel of from brent crude in singapore at cents on
this is up from a loss of a barrel on which was the weakest crack in seven years but still well below the peak for reached on
with profits from gasoline currently tenuous the scope for refiners to lower prices further is likely constrained
in some ways it s a sword for the region s refiners as they can lower gasoline prices and make a loss in the hope of boosting demand in order to remove a surplus of the fuel
asian refiners are also in a quandary over strong margins for middle distillates such as diesel which encourage them to run their plants at high rates even though this also ensures they produce more gasoline than the market is demanding
the profit margin for producing a barrel of gasoil the base for diesel and jet fuel from dubai crude in singapore was in early trade on monday down from the peak of on but well above the low of from june
given the strong demand for diesel and robust refinery profits it s no surprise that the retail price in india and australia has failed to reflect the recent decline in crude
diesel in new delhi was rupees a litre on down percent from the recent peak of rupees on
the national average diesel price in australia was a in the week to down only percent from the recent high of a in the week to
while much of the focus in crude markets has been on the supply side and the rapid switch from fears of tightness to oversupply the demand side of the equation shouldn t be ignored
probably the best method for producers traders and refiners of clearing oversupply in crude markets is to have demand gain to clear the surplus
however given the modest declines in retail prices for gasoline and diesel in major asian countries a tightening of the market may remain elusive
