reuters summit-big oil traders set to cash in on shipping fuel overhaul
london reuters the world s biggest oil traders are gearing up to cash in on big disruptions that could hit the shipping fuel market in just over a year due to new environmental rules
international maritime organization imo regulations will cut the limit for sulfur in marine fuels globally from percent to percent from the start of
we re going to hopefully facilitate the new rules in by helping out the industry and the participants in general to have a reasonably smooth transition marco dunand the chief executive of trading house mercuria told the reuters global commodities summit
he said mercuria was in talks to finance shipowners who want to install expensive sulfur cleaning kits called scrubbers allowing them to burn cheaper high sulfur fuel
he declined to name those clients
the company is offering a package that would include providing compliant fuels via its subsidiary minerva as well as hedging
traders are widely expected to benefit as they thrive off efficiently moving products between regions with price dislocations
but the market currently lacks a benchmark for the new compliant fuel grade
there are legitimate concerns about this product being available in multiple locations vitol group chief executive russell hardy told the summit
he added that planning for the changes in the absence of a futures market was complicating matters
it s doable but we would like a bit of transparency he said
while s p global platts the agency that publishes benchmark physical fuel oil price assessments plans to launch a set of new percent sulfur prices starting in january a paper market does not yet exist
i think it will be a bit chaotic in the beginning of but we don t think it s going to be extremely disruptive gunvor ceo torbjorn tornqvist told the summit
other winners from the changes will be complex refineries that have invested in the right kit to turn products into or sweet ones
this leaves simple refiners that can t easily clean sulfur from petroleum products at a risk of losing out
shipowners on the other hand could be facing an extra billion in fuel costs in according to a base case scenario from consultancy wood mackenzie
this compares with a total global shipping fuel bill of roughly billion today
vitol sees scrubbers installed around the implementation date a number that means high sulfur or heavy fuel oil is expected to remain in demand
vitol has opted to install scrubbers on its bigger ships
it s not the amount of scrubbers you do but on which ships because the majority of bunker fuel that is consumed today goes on percent of the global fleet tornqvist said
as such gunvor which has also invested in some scrubbers believes there will still be demand for heavy fuel oil as scrubber uptake increases through and
vitol expects around barrels per day bpd of middle distillates to go into the million bpd bunker pool to make the new product
that equates to about percent of the entire million bpd distillates market hardy said
he added this transition could be achieved with the right price incentives
tornqvist said the future price difference of around a barrel between gasoil and heavy fuel oil gave an extreme incentive to install a scrubber
