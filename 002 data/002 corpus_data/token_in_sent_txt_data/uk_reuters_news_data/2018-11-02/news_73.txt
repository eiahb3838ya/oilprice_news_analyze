reuters summit-mercuria predicts new wave of consolidation in global oil trading
london reuters global energy trading businesses are set for a new wave of consolidation as rising interest rates and high oil prices compress already thin profit margins said mercuria one of the world s biggest oil traders
the overall industry is oversized chief executive marco dunand told the reuters global commodities summit
in the trading world if you look typically over the last few years what the return on equity in trading is it s not so bad
but if you look at profit compared to turnover it is very small he said
the industry usually operates with a net margin of below percent and during poor years closer to percent which dunand said leaves very little room for error
the net margin compared to turnover is probably one of the lowest you can find in markets we believe there should be consolidation within the mercuria grew rapidly in recent years by buying trading books and businesses of rivals such as jp morgan as banks exited commodities trading and some parts of struggling rival noble group
one way to grow or at least reduce your cost base is consolidation said dunand citing opportunity to reduce expenses such as back and legal offices once you have those in place you don t have to double in size
also spurring consolidation might be higher oil prices requiring larger working capital to fund trading operations as well as increasing interest rates around the world he said
mercuria is still looking to enter the liquefied natural gas lng market dunand said where its rivals such as gunvor and trafigura have already carved out a chunk of the increasingly liquid market
the firm tried to gain exposure to lng earlier this year when it was part of a failed bid by harbour energy to buy australian gas producer santos ltd
the firm reported a gross profit of million in down from million in while traded volumes of crude and refined products rose to million tonnes from million tonnes
volumes will go slightly up in and the trader will have more than percent of its business in gas power coal and metals trading and less than percent in oil and products said dunand
