the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london nov reuters crude oil production is rising at the fastest rate on record as the increase in prices over the last year boosts drilling and completion activity and energy firms employ more horsepower to fracture larger wells
crude and condensates output hit a record million barrels per day in august up from million bpd in july according to the energy information administration petroleum supply monthly eia
crude output has increased by more than million barrels per day over the past months an absolute increase that is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry
in percentage terms output is up by nearly percent over the last year the fastest increase since the excluding the recovery from hurricanes
oil production is now rising faster than at the height of the last drilling and fracking boom before prices slumped in the second half of
most of the increase is coming from onshore shale fields where output has risen by more than million bpd over the last year with a smaller contribution from the gulf of mexico where output is up bpd
in the first nine months of the year the number of wells drilled in the united states was up by percent while well completions were up by percent drilling productivity report eia
increasing output has helped alleviate earlier concerns about a possible crude shortage following the of sanctions on iran with effect from
surging domestic output coupled with increased production from russia saudi arabia and a number of other opec countries has pushed oil prices lower and driven the futures markets back towards contango
spot prices and calendar spreads for wti have weakened rapidly since july much further and faster than for brent in response to the improved availability of crude in the midcontinent of the united states
wti calendar spreads are trading around cents contango compared with a backwardation of more than per barrel in july as traders become more confident about availability
but the accompanying increase in domestic inventories and crude exports has ensured weakness in inland wti has begun to bleed into the seaborne crude market and started to pull down brent prices too
experience suggests there is an average delay of around months between a change in futures prices and the number of rigs drilling for oil
completions take an extra six months or so giving a total lag from futures price changes to production of roughly months
the surge in production reported in the first eight months of the year is therefore the lagged effect of the sharp rise in oil prices during the second half of and early
but benchmark futures prices have levelled off since april and wellhead prices have softened significantly as a result of insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity in west texas
the number of rigs drilling for oil was basically flat between the end of may and the end of september which is likely to lead to a slowdown in production growth by the second and third quarters of
the energy information administration forecasts average crude and condensates production will rise by just over million in after increasing by almost million in
production in the lower states excluding federal waters in the gulf of mexico most of it from shale plays is predicted to rise by next year down from million in
provided they are sustained lower prices should help bring an unsustainable production boom back under control and keep domestic and international markets closer to balance
