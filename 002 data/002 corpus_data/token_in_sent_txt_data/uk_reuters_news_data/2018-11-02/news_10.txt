update 2-u.s. top court rejects trump administration bid to halt climate trial
washington reuters the supreme court on friday rejected for now a bid by the president donald trump s administration to block a trial in a lawsuit filed by young activists who have accused the government of ignoring the perils of climate change
the loss for the administration means it now faces a examination of climate change policy during the trial that was due to begin on in eugene oregon but has since been postponed by the judge
chief justice john roberts on had temporarily put the case on hold while the court as a whole decided how to proceed
the supreme court s order noted that the administration may still have grounds to take its arguments to the san
circuit court of appeals
conservative justices clarence thomas and neil gorsuch indicated they would have granted the administration s request
there was no indication how trump s new supreme court appointee conservative brett kavanaugh voted on the issue
in the lawsuit activists ages to said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels
the lawsuit was filed in against former president barack obama and government agencies in a federal court in eugene oregon
both the obama and trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out
the administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy
this suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions trump administration solicitor general noel francisco said in court papers
francisco noted that the plaintiffs are seeking to hold the government liable for the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions from every source in the world over lawyers for the young activists led by julia olson of a group called our children s trust that brought the lawsuit have said their clients have suffered irreparable harm from the effects of a changing climate
this is a case about the fundamental rights of children and whether the actions of their government have deprived them of their inalienable rights olson said in court papers
on july the high court rejected an earlier application by the trump administration calling it premature
eugene federal judge ann aiken has repeatedly allowed the case to move forward to trial over the objections of the government
the trial will proceed if neither the high court nor the circuit intervene
aiken said in an ruling that although the case raised questions about the role of the judiciary delving into a matter of policy those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case
