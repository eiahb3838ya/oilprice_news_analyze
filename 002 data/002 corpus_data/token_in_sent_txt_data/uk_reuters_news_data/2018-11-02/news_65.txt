update 1-reuters summit-engie stays focused on gas for power generation despite divestment
singapore reuters french energy group engie remains committed to using natural gas for power generation despite selling its oil and gas exploration and production e p unit and lng assets during the past two years
the company which generates half of its electricity globally from natural gas and the rest from renewables sees a strong global movement to tap biogas for power generation engie s executive vice president didier holleaux told the reuters commodities summit
having a strong position in upstream and midstream lng is no longer necessary for us holleaux said
we also see a strong move into more and more renewable gas gas produced through the methanization of agricultural waste and from waste engie sold its oil and gas e p unit to uk upstream independent neptune energy group last year and also completed a sale of its liquefied natural gas lng business to total in july
the company continues to be involved in gas distribution in the asia pacific and is working on various lng infrastructure projects as it believes that replacing coal with gas is the easiest and quickest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region holleaux said
these include a project in indonesia with perusahaan gas negara and perusahaan listrik negara the gas and power companies to supply lng to different power plants said holleaux who was attending the singapore international energy week
engie is also rebuilding its lng trading business globally with a team headed by gordon waters in singapore
the fact that we have sold our business doesn t mean that we have no need for lng trading because from time to time we need cargoes holleaux said
lng globally will be growing trading will be growing because there are needs for adjustment to supplies for this market
we ll just be a small part of this for renewables engie is seeking to expand its market share in selling electricity directly to corporations instead of grids and it is working with partners such as french retailer casino and unisun in china
engie will exit the power business in asia once it completes the sale of its thai subsidiary glow energy part of the company s plan to sell off coal upstream oil and gas businesses and to invest in areas such as renewable energy power grids and energy services
the billion deal to sell glow to global power synergy company pcl gpsc a unit of ptt pcl s was blocked by thailand s energy regulator earlier in october
it s for the buyer gpsc to decide if they will appeal to the thai government
we will act accordingly holleaux said adding that engie would have to look for other buyers if gpsc decides not to appeal
we still have a few coal assets outside of asia pacific which we want to divest he said
