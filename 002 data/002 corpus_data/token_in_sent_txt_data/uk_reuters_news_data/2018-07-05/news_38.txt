update 1-china's ethanol push in doubt as u.s. trade dispute widens
beijing slows approval process for new ethanol plants nationwide of fuel by in doubt industry concerns over securing sufficient corn for biofuels trade dispute raises import hurdles for corn ethanol adding charts by hallie gu and michael hirtzer july reuters china s ambitious push to use biofuel in cars nationwide by is in doubt amid concerns about supplies of raw material such as corn complicated by an escalating trade dispute with washington producers and analysts say
in september last year the government outlined radical plans to roll out the use of ethanol in gasoline nationally by in part to digest its huge corn stocks
producers like china s state development investment corporation sdic agribusiness cofco and jilin fuel rushed to draw up plans to invest billions of yuan to double output in the world s largest car market
but since then only one major project sdic s tonnes per year plant in liaoning province in china s northeast has received the to start construction
three big expansion plans by major producers are stalled because the companies haven t got approval from the government three sources with direct knowledge of the situation say
they declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media
the government has not revised its timeline or commented publicly on a change in policy
but executives at two producers three policy experts and market analysts say the drawn out approval process and project delays suggest beijing is quietly rethinking its initial plans
the slowdown comes as a brewing trade dispute with the united states intensifies raising the threat of further tariffs that could make imports of corn or ethanol to meet any shortfall in domestic supplies uneconomic
the plan was too ambitious and will have a huge impact on the whole industry chain
it was too big a step forward
there might be change to the policy said michael mao analyst with zhuochuang a consultancy based in shandong province
the commerce ministry ministry of agriculture and rural affairs and the national development reform commission did not respond to requests for comment
building enough capacity to meet the target was always going to be tough for the country s nascent ethanol industry
in fuel ethanol capacity was million tonnes according to zhuochuang far short of the million tonnes needed for a national of gasoline known as containing percent ethanol
with just months to go there is little sign of the building boom the sector anticipated
in the northeastern region of heilongjiang the local government said it would launch a bidding process to apply for approval to build new ethanol plants but interested companies are still waiting to hear
i have been mainly doing some paperwork since i got here said a manager in charge of the building of his company s new plants in the cornbelt province
i meet with local government officials frequently but there s no news about what s an executive at another major producer said his company also wanted to expand output following the mandate but could not get permits from the government
cofco has not started building new ethanol plants it had planned waiting on further announcements on government policy according to two people familiar with the matter
the slowdown comes amid concerns that the world s most populous country may struggle to secure enough corn to produce biofuel without disrupting food supplies and prices of the grain
some million tonnes of corn almost a quarter of the country s current annual demand would be needed to make enough ethanol for a national
domestic corn supplies have dwindled in recent years leaving little cushion for the extra demand just as beijing ratchets up pressure on washington in their escalating trade dispute
beijing will hit corn imports from the united states one of its top suppliers with hefty extra tariffs from friday
china already imposes a percent tariff on all ethanol imports keeping arrivals to a trickle
in april it slapped an extra percent tariff on imports from the united states the world s top producer and is set to impose another percent on friday
and after years of selling off its million tonne corn stockpile the state reserves which were expected to help feed the new factories will run out of corn by the end of next year according to reuters calculations
the chinese government expects the supply deficit from domestically grown corn to balloon to million tonnes from million in as the crop shrinks percent and demand grows
once we run out of stocks in the reserves where can you get extra corn to make fuel ethanol said meng jinhui analyst with shengda futures
