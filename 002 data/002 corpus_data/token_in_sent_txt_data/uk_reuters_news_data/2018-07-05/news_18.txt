iran to trump: oil will cost $100 per barrel, and it is your fault
london july reuters oil will soon cost per barrel due to supply disruptions caused by president donald trump iran s opec governor told reuters on thursday as he warned expectations that saudi arabia and russia would help bring down prices were in vain
trump again accused the organization of the petroleum exporting countries of driving fuel prices higher on wednesday and urged allies such as saudi arabia to pump more if they wanted washington to continue protecting them against their top foe iran
iran opec s producer is facing sanctions on its oil exports that are prompting some buyers to cut purchases
iranian opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters that trump should have expected when blocking iran s access to the global markets that it would end up as hostage to saudi arabia and russia who he said had little vested interest in bringing down prices
the responsibility of paying unnecessary prices for oil by all consumers of the whole world especially in gas stations is solely upon your trump s shoulders and the price of over per barrel is yet to come kazempour said
the republican president has lashed out at opec in recent weeks
rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for trump before november congressional elections by offsetting republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the economy
in a tweet on saturday trump said saudi arabia had agreed to increase oil output by up to million barrels an assertion the white house rowed back on in a subsequent statement
the leader of saudi arabia opec s biggest member has assured trump that the kingdom can raise oil production if needed and that the country has million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool oil prices to compensate for falling output in venezuela and iran
trump has been complaining about opec at the same time that washington is piling pressure on its european allies to stop buying iranian oil
iran has threatened to block oil exports through a key gulf waterway in retaliation against any hostile action
kazempour said we are neighbours and will remain so we know we can and we must live together
no one wants you trump to protect anybody you are fighting with everybody sir since you came to office
