uk lawmakers oppose plan to remove local role in fracking decisions
london july reuters british government plans to transfer shale oil and gas exploration planning decisions from local authorities to the national level will be a backward step and harm local democracy a committee of uk lawmakers warned on thursday
in may the uk government announced plans to speed up planning applications to support development of the country s shale gas industry which it believes will reduce britain s dependence on imported gas in the future
among the measures is a proposal for fracking sites to be classified as nationally significant infrastructure which would mean approval for planning applications would be done at a national rather than local level
changing the process in this way would likely exacerbate existing mistrust between communities and the fracking industry the housing communities and local government committee said in a report
taking powers away from local planning authorities would be a backward step
it would remove the important link between fracking applications and local plans and be hugely harmful to local democracy and the principles and spirit of localism said clive betts chair of the committee
instead local mineral planning authorities have the best knowledge of their areas to determine the impacts of fracking the report said
hydraulic fracturing involves extracting gas obtained from rocks broken up or fractured with water and chemicals at high pressure
it has become a contentious issue in europe after it helped reverse a fall in oil output transformed its gas sector and boosted the economy of several states
despite that critics argue that fracking can be associated with environmental issues such as increased industrial activity and water contamination and boost fossil fuel production when more renewable energy should be encouraged
commercial production of shale gas in britain has not yet started as developers complain that progress has been slowed by protests and regulatory processes
british shale gas developer caudrilla expects to fracture its first two horizontal wells in blackpool later this year subject to approvals
the scottish government has in effect banned fracking by ordering local authorities to reject planning applications from companies seeking to do shale gas exploration after a public consultation found overwhelming opposition to it
