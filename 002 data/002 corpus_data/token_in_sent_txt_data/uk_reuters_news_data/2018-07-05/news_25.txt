french nuclear safety at risk from outsourcing - report
paris reuters france s nuclear plants are a safety threat because of their excessive reliance on outsourcing the risk of terror attacks and a lack of operational rigour a parliament report said
france is the world s most country with edf generating percent of its power from ageing nuclear reactors spread around the country many of which have suffered safety scares in recent years
following a string of nuclear plant by greenpeace militants aimed at highlighting the vulnerability of edf s reactors the french parliament launched an investigation into nuclear security in february
nuclear plants are not chocolate factories this is a dangerous activity report coordinator barbara pompili said
she said an excessive reliance on outsourcing with up to percent of maintenance handled by contractors was leading to a loss of internal competence at the utility
edf has had to close several reactors and delay the opening of a new one because of quality issues with some suppliers
the falsification of manufacturing documentation at the creusot foundry of edf supplier areva now bought up by edf and renamed framatome has led to temporary plant closures and an ongoing investigation
edf is also waiting for the results of an inquiry into faulty weldings executed by a subcontractor at a nuclear plant under construction in flamanville in northwest france
the report blamed the fall of a steam generator during maintenance at edf s paluel reactor on problems with cooperation between edf and its subcontractors
paluel has been offline since the may incident
edf denied it was on subcontractors
a large part of the maintenance on our reactors is done by the firms who have produced their components they know these parts better than anyone else dominique miniere the head of edf s reactor fleet told reporters
the report criticised the industry s ruling out rupture concept the assumption that key nuclear components are made so well that malfunctioning can be ruled out
there are no emergency procedures for certain types of accidents because they are assumed to be impossible it said
illustrating that risk has produced a flawed reactor vessel cover for the flamanville reactor which will force edf to replace the piece by just a few years after its expected commercial startup
parliament also warned against external threats
french nuclear installations have not been designed to withstand terrorist aggression simply because terrorism was not an issue at the time they were built the report said
following discussions with mps pompili said google had agreed to pixellate the contours of nuclear plants on its maps
the report warned of the risk of germanwing syndrome referring to a crash where a pilot purposely flew his passenger jet into a french mountainside saying nuclear plant operators needed some level of psychiatric supervision
