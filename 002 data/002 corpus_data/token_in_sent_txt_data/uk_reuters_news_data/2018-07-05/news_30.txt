trump effort to lift u.s. offshore wind sector sparks interest - from europe
reuters the trump administration wants to fire up development of the offshore wind industry by streamlining permitting and carving out vast areas off the coast for leasing part of its america first policy to boost domestic energy production and jobs
the europeans have taken note
the drive to open america s offshore wind industry has attracted europe s biggest renewable energy companies who see the east coast as a new frontier after years of success across the atlantic
less experienced wind power companies meanwhile have struggled to compete in their own backyard according to lease data and interviews with industry executives
many are steering clear of the opportunity altogether concerned by development costs and attracted to cheaper options on land
the trump administration hopes the industry will help supply power to the northeast eventually creating american jobs in manufacturing turbines towers and other components
its efforts are part of a broader push to relax regulations and spur development across the energy complex
this would be american produced energy and american jobs said vincent devito energy policy advisor to interior secretary ryan zinke
it fits well with the america first for the moment however europe s renewable energy companies are the ones using the opportunity to advance their already sizable headstart in offshore wind projects
since companies have won all eight of the government s competitive offshore wind lease auctions with aggressive bids that have pumped up prices into the tens of millions of dollars
graphic european firms dominate offshore wind leases bidding in an auction last year for nearly acres off the coast of new york for example lasted rounds with norway s equinor formerly known as statoil eventually winning the lease for a record million
an individual lease had never before sold for more than million according to public records
europeans claimed another victory in may when a partnership between copenhagen infrastructure fund and avangrid the arm of spain s iberdrola won the largest ever contract for offshore wind power in massachusetts
of the federal government currently active offshore wind leases seven are owned by companies according to bureau of ocean energy management records

trump s interior department gave the industry a boost this year when it announced major lease sales off massachusetts sought input on potential lease areas off new york and new jersey and began a study of all atlantic coast waters for wind energy potential
it also proposed easing permitting including by allowing developers to get some permits before making key decisions like what size of turbines they would use
such aggressive leasing and flexible permitting helped europe become the world s largest offshore wind market with thousands of wind turbines installed in the last two decades and more than billion euros in investment expected this year according to trade group windeurope
while the east coast has wind conditions and sea depths similar to the north sea it boasts just one wind farm off the coast of rhode island
that wind farm was developed by firm deepwater wind llc which is backed by hedge fund shaw group
deepwater wind s chief executive jeff grybowski called the wind industry s hesitation to move offshore outdated
i m sure that we will see more american entrants in this business as time goes on he said
until then we re happy to fly the other chief executives are less sanguine
jim robo ceo of leading renewable energy company nextera told investors on a recent conference call that development time of to years and uncertainty around permitting raised serious questions about prospects offshore
it is a moon shot in terms of building in terms of finding people who actually know what they re doing from a construction standpoint robo said
nextera which owns wind farms in the united states and canada did not respond to a request for additional comment
those concerns are echoed across much of the industry
there are so many opportunities to do onshore at substantially lower cost said mike garland the ceo of pattern energy group
it makes more sense for us to be focused in that foreign companies are not just dominating the offshore leases
most of the early projects according to executives will rely almost exclusively on imports of everything from subsea cables to turbines that are not currently made domestically meaning much of the work will be overseas
components for deepwater wind s five turbines off rhode island for example were shipped from spain denmark and france according to grybowski
their steel foundations were made in louisiana
if construction demand picks up the picture could change according to a report by consultants bvg associates limited
the report said building gigawatts of offshore wind projects by would likely justify making most turbine components on soil helping support up jobs
the interior department s devito said he saw the possibilities first hand during a visit to an offshore wind component manufacturing site in copenhagen
he said he was he was amazed by the level of activity the blades the steel towers the cranes the opportunity is to make them here he said
