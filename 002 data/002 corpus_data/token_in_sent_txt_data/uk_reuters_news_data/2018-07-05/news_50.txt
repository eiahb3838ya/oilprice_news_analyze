explainer-what the failed glencore-tohoku coal talks mean for the market
reuters electric utilities in japan and other asian countries are driving blind when it comes to coal prices after the failure of japan s tohoku electric and glencore to agree on an annual thermal coal contract that is used to set prices for the region
tohoku electric a major japanese utility and glencore the world s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal abandoned the talks last month on their annual australian supply contract
both parties seem to have tried hard to come to a consensus but always had large difference in price expectations this year energy consultancy wood mackenzie said in a note to clients
coal prices spiked as japanese and asian utilities jumped into the spot market to cover their needs after the talks broke down
companies that were relying on the talks to set a price for their previously delivered cargoes and future shipments under their april to march contracts now lack a reference for netting out prior payments based on temporary prices
the collapse of this year s talks has raised questions about the industry s dependence on this method of setting prices
japan s utilities which buy about percent of australia s thermal coal exports have a relationship with glencore and its predecessors that goes back over years
the two sides typically sit down early in the year to negotiate fixed prices for annual supplies for april to march
those prices are published by media and used by utilities in thailand taiwan and malaysia for their own contracts
however during the talks this year spot coal prices rose making it difficult for the sides to settle on a contract
because tohoku already signed some deals with smaller suppliers when spot prices were lower they were not willing to pay significantly more for coal from their biggest supplier glencore said one source with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak publicly about commercial deals
glencore had the opposite view
they were unwilling to agree to a supply deal significantly below spot market prices the source added
without this year s deal utilities need to find another reference price for their annual supplies or they can buy in the spot market
finding another benchmark is difficult because the coal market is more opaque than other commodities such as crude oil where exchanges readily publish futures prices
rising prices have made going into the spot market expensive
spot thermal coal prices at australia s newcastle terminal have climbed by percent from their lows to over per tonne the highest since
but buying from newcastle supports glencore which exported million tonnes of coal from australia in a quarter of the country s overseas sales according to government and company data
market participants are divided on the industry s next steps
some traders expect another japanese utility to become an alternative negotiator for this year or tohoku will renew negotiations for another term contract as it wants to reduce its exposure to the volatile spot market
others expect the failed talks to mark a more significant change
power market liberalization in japan now demands that utilities have more flexibility in coal prices in their ability to fuel costs wood mackenzie said
national australia bank said in its july commodity outlook published this week that spot prices for thermal coal may become increasingly important given the breakdown of the traditional japanese financial year contract some japanese companies are improving their ability to operate in the spot market
jera a between tokyo electric power and chubu electric power and one of the world s biggest fuel importers has taken over the coal operations of europe s edf trading and plans to buy its liquefied natural gas operations
jera president yuji kakimi said the company has reduced its coal requirements using contracts to only a few percent from as much as percent a decade ago
another option is to use spot price indexes
japan s steel sector moved to this model last year after nippon steel sumitomo metal ended their fixed price mechanism settled through talks with australian miners for coking coal
however a senior official at glencore said that is not what we desire to reporting by yuka obayashi in tokyo and henning gloystein in singapore additional reporting by aaron sheldrick and osamu tsukimori editing by christian schmollinger
