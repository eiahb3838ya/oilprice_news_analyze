trump late on wednesday said the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec producer cartel was driving up fuel prices
the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up they are doing little to help
if anything they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members for very little s
this must be a two way street
reduce pricing now trump wrote on twitter
opec together with a group of producers led by russia started to withhold output in to prop up prices
recent price rises have also been spurred by a announcement that it plans to sanctions against iran from november which will also target its oil industry
a key driver of the rise in prices has been the deal to cut oil output compounded by collapsing venezuelan production and the decision to end the iran deal national australia bank nab said in its july outlook
ship brokerage banchero costa said iran s crude oil production was currently around million barrels per day bpd but added there is the risk of production decreasing going forward as exports are again affected by renewed sanctions implemented by the opec and russia announced in june they were willing to raise output to address concerns of emerging supply shortages due to unplanned disruptions from venezuela to libya and likely also to replace a potential fall in iranian supplies due to sanctions
nab said its oil price forecasts point to brent spending the next few months largely in the per barrel range although meaningful output increases could push prices lower later in the year and higher shale production should impose an upside limit on meanwhile crude oil production has soared by percent in the last two years to million bpd
that means just three countries russia the united states and saudi arabia meet a third of global oil demand
