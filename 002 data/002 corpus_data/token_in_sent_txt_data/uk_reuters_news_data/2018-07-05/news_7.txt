in ortega s government started receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in oil cooperation from venezuela
most of those funds are run by albanisa to finance social projects and build a business conglomerate to pay back the loans
protests began in april against ortega s perceived corrupt and authoritarian regime
police and masked militias fired at the protesters leaving more than people dead
the treasury accused madriz of ordering the nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital managua killing six people including two children
it said police also asked gang leaders in nicaragua to attack protesters fired on and killed peaceful protesters
briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully ordered violent attacks against marchers and beat protesters and stole money from managua municipal projects according to the treasury
centeno exploited government taxes and fines siphoned funds from infrastructure projects and used his position to his benefit the statement said
the state department said it would hold those responsible for the violence and intimidation campaign accountable
these actions must end the department said in a statement
