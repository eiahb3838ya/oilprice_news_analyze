update 2-epa won't force refiners to make up waived biofuels volumes
new york reuters the environmental protection agency said on friday it can not make large oil refineries blend additional biofuels into their gasoline to make up for volumes waived under the small refinery hardship waiver program unless congress authorizes it
the agency s decision was certain to anger the powerful corn lobby and congressional members from farming states
epa has issued a record number of waivers freeing small refineries from the renewable fuel standard rfs in the past year drawing criticism from the biofuel industry and its legislative backers that the program undermines demand for ethanol
lawmakers like republican senator chuck grassley of iowa have demanded that other refiners take on bigger obligations to compensate for the volumes exempted under the program as a way for president donald trump s administration to keep its promise to protect the biofuel mandate
the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend specific volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel supply each year and prove compliance by acquiring credits called rins that can be either earned or purchased
the law has helped farmers by creating a big market for ethanol but refining companies have complained it costs them a fortune
the epa under administrator scott pruitt has issued more than two dozen small refinery exemptions from the rfs for including waivers to plants owned by some the largest refining companies
refiners have until early to comply with all or a portion of the obligation
the biofuel industry says the waivers have cut the billion gallon mandate to roughly billion and have asked the epa to reallocate the waived volumes to the remaining refineries who must comply
law says gallons congress intended gallons trump promised gallons why can t pruitt do gallons
poor excuses killing farmers iowa senator chuck grassley a republican said on twitter on friday
while the epa said there is a path to reallocation it is a near impossible one
our regulations only allow reallocation of an exempted refinery s rin obligations for a given year if the exemption is granted before we finalize the volumes for that year epa spokeswoman molly block said
that is impossible because hardship waivers are not granted until after the annual volumes are set
binding precedent holds that agencies can only impose retroactive obligations if congress has given them the authority to do so block explained
scott segal an attorney at bracewell who works with refiners including valero said the epa is correct about retroactively calling it a staple of administrative law
if the ethanol industry would like to open the renewable fuel standard in a comprehensive way i am sure that many parties fuel makers environmentalists consumer groups and others would be very happy to join in segal said
the biofuels industry did not like the message
that certainly contradicts what epa has stated before
the agency has admitted in past rfs rulemakings that its decision not to reallocate exempted volumes is an interpretive decision made by epa not one directed by the statute renewable fuels association executive vice president geoff cooper said on friday
