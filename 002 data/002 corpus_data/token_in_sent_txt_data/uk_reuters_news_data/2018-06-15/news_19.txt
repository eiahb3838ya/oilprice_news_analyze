from norway to portugal: europe's largest intraday power market is on
oslo june reuters europe s largest intraday power market launched on tuesday to trade electricity between countries has had a smooth start and offers traders better access to energy resources and volumes norway s statnett power grid told reuters
the new market called intraday or xbid came online after years of development and testing and is a collaboration between a number of power exchanges and transmission system operators across europe
in principle trades can be made directly from portugal to norway if transmission capacities are available
increasing the market allows for more trading and better access to resources for doing that statnett s spokesman henrik glette said
xbid allows electricity trading between austria belgium denmark estonia finland france germany latvia lithuania norway the netherlands portugal spain and sweden and more countries are due to join it in
the first days have shown positive results and the system has performed well
this is a major step towards an integrated european power market said glette
the new intraday market will not only ensure better utilisation of europe s resources but will also create a wider balancing mechanism for its members when they need more electricity than they have expected said statnett
the nordpool power exchange received xbid s first bid in denmark and the first deliveries were made on wednesday said the exchange
xbid relies on a common it system and a shared order book a capacity management system and a transmission system
it allows the matching of orders entered by market participants in the different countries it covers if capacity allows
after its first week project members expect trading volumes to increase said power exchange nordpool
the system is designed to handle up to trades per day and will be developed to process both more trades and more products said statnett
xbid is so far backed by system operators including statnett as well as power exchanges
in finland a country that had struggled to agree with its nordic neighbours a new balancing market in the grid fingrid also praised the project
