japanese utilities aim to curb plutonium stockpiles
tokyo june reuters japanese nuclear operators want to curb stockpiles of plutonium extracted from spent nuclear fuel by using them as feedstock for reactors the industry s top official said on friday
he was responding to a media report that the united states has called on tokyo to reduce its mounting stockpiles
the nikkei business daily citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter reported on sunday that the department of state and the national security council had requested that japan trim its stockpiles ahead of an extension next month of a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement
japan is also the only nation without atomic weapons to have significant amounts of plutonium which has led to constant criticism from neighbouring countries scientists and others
the chairman of the japanese power utilities federation satoru katsuno who is also president of chubu electric power said he was not aware of such diplomatic discussions and added that japanese utilities had not received any request from the japanese government to set an upper limit on plutonium stockpiles
under the principle of not having plutonium with no purpose for usage we are trying to carry out mox mixed oxide fuel usage at reactors promptly
we will continue to try to curb plutonium stockpiles he said during his monthly news conference in tokyo
chubu electric wants to use its plutonium stockpiles as fuel for its hamaoka reactor which has been shut pending rigorous safety checks imposed after the fukushima disaster in he said
with most of japan s commercial reactors still shut down in the wake of the fukushima nuclear disaster the stockpiles have been gradually building up
at the end of japan had tonnes of plutonium including tonnes domestically and the rest held in reprocessing facilities in britain and france under contracts with japanese nuclear operators according to the latest available data from the cabinet office
japan says it has firmly maintained the principle of not owning plutonium whose use is unspecified and of putting all nuclear materials under the international atomic energy agency s safeguards in accordance with the nuclear treaty
only a limited number of reactors in japan can use mox in reactors but the use of mox a blend of uranium and plutonium recycled from spent nuclear fuel in conventional commercial reactors is a pillar of japan s energy policy
