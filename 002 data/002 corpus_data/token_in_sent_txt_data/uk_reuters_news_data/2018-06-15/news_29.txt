russian state reinsurer shoulders more risk after u.s. sanctions
moscow reuters dozens of industrial plants in russia have turned to the state s reinsurance company for cover after an extension of sanctions made it difficult to get reinsurance elsewhere the head of that firm told reuters
the russian national reinsurance company rnrc has signed the new contracts for dozens of industrial plants since new sanctions took effect in early april to cover risks including a halt in production or shipping he said
nikolay galushin s comments underscore the impact of fresh sanctions on the russian economy as it chokes off access to regular reinsurance a critical process that backstops insurance by sharing large risks
rnrc was set up chiefly to offer reinsurance to firms barred from using western providers
on april the treasury department imposed sanctions against russian magnate oleg deripaska and companies in which he is a large shareholder including the world s aluminum producer rusal in response to what it called malign activities by russia
the firms owned by billionaire viktor vekselberg were also sanctioned as the united states responded to suspected russian meddling in the election
the insurance company which was covering these risks asked the foreign market counterparts where these risks were offloaded are you with us or with the sanctions galushin said
basically each single reinsurer said we ve pulled out we can t do it he said
galushin did not name any companies whose risks rnrc has taken since april
galushin said that previously such risks had been almost entirely offloaded in the west
we have taken the risks of all who had pulled out he said
relations between russia and the west have worsened after moscow annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine
since then a wide range of sanctions on companies banks and individuals were imposed on russia by the european union the united states and other western nations
washington suggested it might lift the sanctions against rusal and its parent if deripaska cuts his stake to below percent and introduces independent board members
the firms are set until to come up with a plan to meet requirements to escape sanctions
there are a couple of dozen industrial plants which are insuring their property potential losses from stoppage in production cargoes liability etc galushin said
deripaska s business empire includes insurer ingosstrakh as well as eurosibenergo
the treasury gave deripaska s counterparts until to wind down business with rusal
galushin said that the reinsurance liability limit on the single event on the new sanctioned risks exceeds billion rubles million
rnrc s capital is billion rubles and it also has central bank guarantee worth billion rubles
he said that the current capital was enough to cover for any potential payouts under the commercial contracts it has while in an event of a sanctioned company payout the central bank was ready to provide more funds
