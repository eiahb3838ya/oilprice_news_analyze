transcanada fixes part of leach xpress natgas pipe after w.va. blast
june reuters transcanada corp s columbia gas transmission tco unit said it fixed a section of the leach xpress natural gas pipeline downstream of a pipe blast in west virginia last week
that work enabled the xpress meter in southeast ohio to return to service late thursday according to a notice to customers
the stagecoach meter in monroe county on the virginia border connects to eqt midstream partners lp s strike force south gathering fields in monroe and belmont counties in ohio
strike force can also deliver to energy transfer partners lp s rover and enbridge inc s texas eastern transmission tetco pipelines
columbia gas said all other meters affected by the blast will remain at zero until the pipeline returns to service
the company did not say when the full pipe would return to service noting the site of the incident is in the restoration process
columbia gas told customers it will provide an update on the status of the pipe on june
the shutdown of leach xpress forced producers using the line to find other pipes to ship gas out of the marcellus and utica shale regions of pennsylvania west virginia and ohio
alternative pipelines include etp s rover tallgrass energy partners lp s rockies express rex eqt midstream partners lp s equitrans and enbridge s tetco according to analysts at s p global platts
columbia gas which declared a force majeure after the blast said the damaged section of pipe could affect movement of about billion cubic feet per day bcfd
one billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
energy analysts said overall output in the appalachian region was little changed by the blast as producers like range resources corp and southwestern energy co found other pipes to ship their gas
appalachian output rose from bcfd on june the day of the blast to bcfd over the weekend before easing back to bcfd on thursday according to thomson reuters data
the leach xpress in west virginia and ohio which entered full service at the start of this year transports marcellus and utica shale gas to consumers in the midwest and gulf coast
the columbia pipeline system which transcanada acquired in serves millions of customers from new york to the gulf of mexico
