explainer-why yemen is at war
yemen s war has exposed old divisions conflict is between unstable local coalitions no guarantee a decisive battle in hodeidah will bring peace by angus mcdowall beirut june reuters the battle for the western yemeni port of hodeidah could be an important milestone in the civil war
but analysts say the conflict is so complex that even a decisive outcome there might not bring peace
why is yemen so divided
yemen s internal splits have festered for years
north and south yemen united into a single state in but separatists in the south tried to secede from the north in
their forces were swiftly beaten and more power and resources flowed to the northern capital of sanaa angering many southerners
former president ali abdullah saleh had ruled north yemen since and the unified state after
but he alienated many yemenis
his relatives controlled core parts of the army and economy and critics said corruption was rife
in the far north some of the zaydi sect of shi ite islam also chafed
zaydis had ruled northern yemen until the revolution but their heartland was now impoverished
in the late some zaydis formed the houthi group which fought yemen s army and grew friendly with iran
though allied to saleh the muslim brotherhood and other sunni islamists were also gaining strength particularly under general ali mohsen who built a power base in the army
taking advantage of factional rivalries jihadist fugitives set up al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap one of the group s most powerful wings and began staging attacks
how did arab spring protests lead to war
when mass protests broke out in some of saleh s former allies turned on him
the army split between units loyal to saleh and those who followed ahmar
separatists rallied in the south
the houthis seized more areas
aqap attacks increased
after a year of crisis including a bombing that nearly killed saleh yemen s gulf neighbours persuaded him to step down but he stayed in yemen
deputy president mansour hadi was elected in to a term to oversee a democratic transition
a national dialogue meeting of all yemen s opposing groups began hashing out a new constitution
but despite the dialogue things were falling apart
hadi was widely seen as weak and his administration corrupt
saleh s allies in the army and government undermined the transition
aqap set up a and hit sanaa with ever bloodier bombings
in the houthis seized sanaa with help from army units loyal to saleh forcing hadi to share power
when the national dialogue proposed a federal constitution both houthis and southern separatists rejected it for blunting their sway
the houthis arrested hadi in early but he escaped and fled to aden
the houthis pursued him battling loyalists of the transitional government
days later saudi arabia entered the war on hadi s side backed by a coalition of arab allies to prevent iran from gaining influence via the houthis on its border and to preserve the transition
they plucked hadi from aden and took him to riyadh notionally preserving his internationally recognised government and the democratic transition plan
why was there deadlock for so long
the crisis was now a war between two unstable coalitions
the houthis and saleh were old enemies jointly ruling the populous highlands and red sea coast
hadi had no personal power base but became a nominal figurehead for southern separatists tribes in the northeast sunni islamists and army remnants loyal to ahmar
internal rivalries even emerged in the coalition set up by saudi arabia to back hadi
riyadh and its main ally the united arab emirates differed over local allies and tactics
the houthis and saleh s forces were driven from aden and its environs in south yemen and from central marib and the desert area to its east in
years of military stalemate followed
the houthis held most of the easily defended highlands
they also held the flat red sea coast and its port of hodeidah the last entry point for supplying northern yemen
the coalition kept up intense air strikes aiming to split the houthis and saleh
they imposed a partial blockade to stop iran arming the houthis something it denies doing
but despite this pressure talks went nowhere
how have internal divisions played out
then last year saleh finally abandoned his houthi allies hoping to cut a deal and regain power for his family
but he was killed fleeing sanaa in december
his loyalists turned on the houthis helping the advance towards hodeidah that culminated in this week s assault
divisions widened on the other side too
the uae supported separatists in the south who sometimes clashed with fighters backed by saudi arabia
in the north the saudis brought in ahmar to command forces around marib a red flag for the uae because of his connection to the muslim brotherhood its biggest bugbear
meanwhile the death toll from air strikes and the near famine aggravated by the partial blockade prompted international outrage making it harder for gulf states key western allies to maintain military aid
if the hodeidah fighting lasts long causing big coalition casualties and an outcry over a humanitarian catastrophe the houthis may hope the advance will fail
if the houthis are driven out and lose all ability to keep supply lines open they might lose the war
but there is no guarantee the victors could put aside their own divisions and build a real peace
