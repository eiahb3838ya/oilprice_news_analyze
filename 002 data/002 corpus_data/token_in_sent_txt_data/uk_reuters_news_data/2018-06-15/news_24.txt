german court says investors can seek redress from porsche se in vw case
berlin reuters a german court ruled on friday that investors pushing for damages over a sharp fall in volkswagen shares after the carmaker disclosed emissions cheating in can also seek redress from majority shareholder porsche se
investors from around the world have lodged lawsuits at a regional court in braunschweig seeking around billion euros billion in damages from volkswagen which they say did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its cheating of emissions tests in the united states
the lawsuit at the regional court in braunschweig near vw s wolfsburg headquarters is led by investment firm deka
due to procedural matters the suit will now be extended to porsche se the investment vehicle for the porsche and piech families that controls percent of vw s voting stock a spokeswoman for the court said
the third civil senate of the higher regional court of braunschweig today clarified that besides volkswagen porsche automobil holding se is also a defendant in the capital investor model procedure pending at the court the court said in a statement
lawyers for vw have said the carmaker had no obligation to disclose the possible financial damage of its emissions manipulations prior to when it specified the implications of its use of illicit software because it believed the financial costs of the cheating would be insignificant
this move by the braunschweig court is giving investors another chance to submit further claims said axel wegner of law firm tilp which represents deka investment gmbh
deka lost money on its vw shares when they fell sharply after the emissions cheating but says the purpose of its legal action is to provide a test case resolving generic or common issues for other related cases
however unlike in a class action suit this case does not have the legal effect of resolving all individual claims
public hearings of the braunschweig case are due to start in early september
