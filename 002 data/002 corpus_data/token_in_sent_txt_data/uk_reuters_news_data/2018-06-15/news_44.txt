update 1-china cuts subsidies for some renewable power projects - finance ministry
some biomass plants ineligible for support finance ministry trying to resolve huge subsidy backlog grids can now pass renewable connection costs on to customers adds background shanghai june reuters some chinese biomass and plants will no longer be eligible for renewable energy subsidies the country s finance ministry said on friday as it bids to resolve a huge payment backlog
the ministry of finance has been struggling to find the funds to pay a subsidy backlog now amounting to an estimated billion yuan billion following a rapid surge in solar and wind capacity
the ministry said in a notice that biomass and plants including plants that burn a mixture of coal forest waste and household refuse would no longer be entitled to financial support
the move follows a decision earlier this month to cut subsidies for new solar power plants this year and also restrict the number of new projects
china has sought to phase out subsidies for renewable projects but it has promised to replace them with more direct policy support
it aims to give clean energy plants priority access to the grid and will also introduce a mandatory renewable quota system later this year
grid firms have been accused of failing to meet their legal obligation to buy all the renewable power available in their jurisdiction preferring instead to source cheaper power
the finance ministry also said on friday that it would now allow grid companies to pass on some renewable energy connection costs to customers
