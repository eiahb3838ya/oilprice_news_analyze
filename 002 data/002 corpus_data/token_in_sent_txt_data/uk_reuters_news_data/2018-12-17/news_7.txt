update 3-sse weighs options as innogy uk retail merger collapses
reuters sse and innogy scrapped plans to merge their british energy retail operations on monday after the industry regulator proposed a cap on consumer bills leaving sse searching for new options for its struggling business
this now at least clears the way for german utility to consolidate innogy s british npower division it will receive as part of a bigger breakup deal with innogy s parent rwe
the plan more than a year in the making collapsed after the companies failed to agree on new commercial terms in light of the proposed cap on energy bills
sse and innogy had warned last month the deal which would have created britain s second biggest retail power provider behind centrica s british gas would be delayed
britain s big six energy suppliers have been squeezed by efforts to cap energy bills following a government promise to tackle prices
the level of the cap was tighter than expected and the performance of both companies retail businesses had changed since the was first announced sse ceo alistair said during a call with journalists
as a result the deal was not in the best interests of its customers employees and shareholders sse said
said sse would take time to consider other options for its retail unit including a standalone demerger and listing an outright sale or an alternative transaction but said no specific talks had taken place with any other potential buyers
a source close to the deal said that for now sse is more likely to create a standalone retail business
innogy cut its outlook for the current year as it will have to consolidate npower again adding this would also hit next year s adjusted earnings before interest and tax by about million euros million pounds
npower has struggled among competition from britain s near smaller energy suppliers
an october report from regulator ofgem said the company s margin for supply energy was minus percent
said the collapse of the venture had no fundamental impact on a bigger breakup deal which will result in it taking over all of innogy s networks and retail activities including npower and would also not delay it
and fellow german utility rwe agreed in march to break up innogy and share out its assets a complex transaction that is forecast to be completed by the end of
shares in innogy and sse were all down to percent at gmt
analysts said abandoning the deal was a positive move for sse
we see the options under consideration as more optimal for sse than a merger with a troublesome npower analysts at jefferies said
would likely have to absorb npower and would likely spend several painful years to and integrate sse s latest talks with innogy covered the potential impact of regulatory caps on tariffs the new company s requirement to post collateral against its credit exposure and its ability to obtain and retain an appropriate credit rating
these implications meant the new company would have faced very challenging market conditions particularly during the period when it would have incurred the bulk of the integration costs sse said
