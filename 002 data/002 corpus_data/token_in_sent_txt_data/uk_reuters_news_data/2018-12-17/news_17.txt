shaken by a sharp drop in oil prices in recent months boards are generally expected to stick to spending discipline imposed following the price crash
global investment in oil and gas production known as upstream is expected to reach around billion next year according to woodmac analyst angus rodger
that compares with a total spending of billion billion pounds in which dropped to billion in and
although spending levels have slightly recovered since then next year s capital expenditure will still fall short of the billion required to meet demand growth and to offset the natural decline of output from fields rodger told reuters
