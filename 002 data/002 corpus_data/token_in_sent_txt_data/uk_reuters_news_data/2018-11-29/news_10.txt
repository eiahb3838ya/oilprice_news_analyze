feature-in mexico, resistance to solar projects bodes badly for fast-tracking train
adds comment from sunpower corp by sheky espejo and noe torres san josé tipceh mexico nov reuters the yucatan peninsula dividing the gulf of mexico from the caribbean is among mexico s top destinations for renewable energy firms thanks to its strong winds and sunny climate
home to bustling tourist resorts such as cancun the area is also a big energy consumer
but some of its mayan indigenous communities are resisting rapid development of billion of renewable energy projects and preparing to fight a plan to build a railway across the peninsula
andres manuel lopez obrador who takes office on saturday wants to fast track the construction of the tourist and freight line
in the communities there is concern that their opinion will not be taken into account once again with this project said carlos escoffié lawyer for the collective of mayan communities in the chenes region
in san jose tipceh a town of people surrounded by jungles indigenous leaders delayed by months a dollar renewable energy project by solar company sunpower corp which planned to begin operations in august
we are practically selling our families for a little bit of money said resident damián mugarte threatening to take the battle to mexico s highest court
indigenous resistance capitalizes on a law passed in the wake of the zapatista uprising in southern mexico that compels the government to consult with indigenous people for projects on their land
but the rules are ambiguous for investors and communities alike
some experts warn that unless the new government puts in place clear guidelines all sides agree on the issue has the potential to stall railways ports mines and other infrastructure projects
if not fixed the problem can become the main obstacle for economic growth said hector garza of international law firm ritch mueller who has advised the current government in developing the legal framework for this process
rodolfo salazar who heads the consultation department for the current government at the ministry of energy said rules put in place had helped resolve some conflicts but acknowledged they were not adequate to win the trust of indigenous populations
lopez obrador has pledged to amend the constitution to further reflect the indigenous rights a move that will force the government and companies to pay more heed to their concerns
that may make it harder to build the mayan train a railway planned in the states of yucatan quintana roo campeche tabasco and chiapas connecting the rainforest and the beach
it could also spell difficulties for another railway to connect the pacific and atlantic oceans which lopez obrador hopes could boost the economy of the poor southern state of oaxaca
in an effort to win popular backing for the project lopez obrador last week held a national referendum on the mayan train and nine other policy initiatives including an oil refinery in the gulf of mexico as part of his pledge to allow greater popular say in government during his term
but the referendums have stirred controversy because of low participation rates and opaque monitoring of results
only around people voted in the consultation representing just percent of eligible voters
his first consultation last month called for canceling the construction of a partially built billion airport for mexico city sending the peso currency and the stock market sharply lower as investors fretted over how he would manage the economy
although lopez obrador vowed to respect the opinion of towns and villages affected by the mayan train he has also pledged to launch a tender to find a private sector partner for the project soon after he takes office
in yucatan activists say that none of the communities through which the train will pass have been provided with information about the project
the fear is that they will find people close to the government to simulate popular support something which has happened repeatedly on the peninsula said escoffié of the collective of mayan communities
rights groups including amnesty international have highlighted the need for consultations on projects that will drive through some pristine natural habitats and indigenous lands
lopez obrador has said that the train project which he expects to take four years to complete and to cost between billion and billion will provide a boost to the economy of the five southern states which remain less developed than the more industrialized north
the train will provide easier access to key tourist sites like the mayan coastal ruins at tulum and the famed complex at chichen itza
lopez obrador has said much of the project would be paid for with revenues from tourism taxes in coming years
indigenous communities already oppose almost a dozen projects across mexico s southern states awarded in as part of president enrique pena nieto s bid to generate more than a third of mexico s electricity from renewable energy by
under existing law projects are put to a vote which the majority must support for projects to go ahead
but regulations are vague and communities and international organizations including the united nations argue that in many cases indigenous peoples have not been consulted properly
the process has caused frustrations for investors
on the oaxacan coast an indigenous zapotec community won a court order to suspend the construction of a wind farm by french state company edf since april
edf said the delays jeopardize its investments in mexico
how much can we stand said víctor tamayo edf s regional director in mexico
much of the difficulty we are experiencing is because there are no rules and the federal government is in san josé tipceh sunpower s investment finally won approval in a consultation
the launch of the massive solar park has been postponed until september
every day that passes there are costs associated said adrien mallet director of business development at sunpower in mexico
however he said the company was not frustrated by the delay and was focused on strengthening its links with the local community
many in the impoverished town where most inhabitants work in agriculture growing corn lemons and tangerines say the park will bring jobs
we are barely surviving here complained anastacio ake a evangelical pastor saying he would welcome the money and the solar panels the company has promised to install in homes
