analysis-pressure mounts to bury carbon emissions, but who will pay?
london reuters when countries gather on sunday to hammer out how they will enact pledges to cut carbon emissions a oil consortium will offer a solution pump some of your excess carbon dioxide to us and we could store it for you
environmentalists worry the costly technology known as carbon capture and storage ccs will perpetuate the fossil fuel status quo when rapid and deep cuts energy use are needed to limit global warming
but proponents of ccs will be lobbying hard at the climate conference in katowice poland for the extensive investment and regulatory change required to employ it at scale citing assessments that it could play a role
the expectation is that katowice will be important said stephen bull a senior vice president at norwegian oil company equinor which is involved in developing a ccs project called northern lights
ccs is the only way to go he said arguing that countries need the technology to help fulfil the pledges they made around the time of the breakthrough paris climate change agreement in
a united nations report warned on tuesday that nations would have to triple their current efforts to keep global temperature rises within boundaries scientists say are needed to avoid devastating floods storms and drought
along with the united states norway is one of the countries at the forefront of drive for ccs building on years of diverting carbon dioxide from its vast gas output and using some to push out oil from aging fields
oslo plans what it says will be the first viable project to use ccs to limit industrial emissions by taking carbon dioxide from industrial plants at home and abroad and storing it permanently in empty oil reservoirs under the seabed
the relatively small scale of the project along with the unsolved problem of who will pay for it highlight the obstacles to getting ccs technology off the ground
organizers of the estimated billion euros billion northern lights project say it could store around million tonnes per year of emissions from a norwegian energy plant a cement plant as well as emissions from other countries
this is a tiny fraction of the billion tonnes per year that would need to be stored by according to the international energy agency which coordinates industrialized nations energy policies
the project still needs the norwegian government to take a final investment decision something which trude sundset ceo of gasnova the norwegian state s ccs enterprise said was scheduled for or
that would depend on how the project developed she said adding it was also necessary to bring industry and other countries on board
it is not easy to find a good business model in the short medium term she said
it s naive to think one country can pay it has to be a collaboration between industry and a european union climate strategy published on wednesday said rapid deployment of renewables meant the potential of ccs to be a major decarbonization option appeared lower than before
but it said ccs would be needed especially if the bloc wanted to reach a goal of greenhouse gas emissions by
for sure we have to improve carbon capture and storage and we have to invest eu climate chief miguel arias canete told reuters
earlier attempts to fund ccs in europe have largely failed
an eu program in did not go on to fund a single ccs project and a british support scheme was canceled in
britain s government now plans to help develop the country s first commercial project which will capture carbon dioxide to be used in industrial applications by the
europe s green party prioritizes energy efficiency recycling and renewable energy but says there could be a role for ccs in offsetting emissions from processes like steelmaking
we need to experiment with it
there is an industrial application think steel bas eickhout dutch green mep and climate spokesman for the greens told reuters
the problem is that the longer we wait the more it ccs becomes a necessary graphic carbon capture technology eighteen ccs plants are in operation around the world according to the global ccs institute which says ccs facilities each able to store million tonnes a year would be needed by to keep global warming within a rise
countries as far afield as algeria and japan are working with ccs but only two of the world s ccs operations are on power plants
the ccs industry sees potential for many more
while europe focuses on renewables and replacing coal with gas developing countries say they can not move so fast and president donald trump who pulled his country out of the s paris climate change accord promotes coal
but the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa think tank said this month that coal plants are having a difficult time competing with wind and solar resources which have come down rapidly in price even without ccs
economics is a serious issue
and to do ccs on a wide scale you need to build a whole new infrastructure new pipelines find repositories which would work inspection equipment and then monitoring said ieefa s david schlissel
ieefa estimates putting ccs on an average coal plant would cost nearly hour mwh
this compares to average power purchase agreement prices for wind and solar of around or less since
the ccs institute which represents companies involved in developing the technology said on wednesday a feasibility study on fitting css to a second power station in saskatchewan canada had shown it could be done more cheaply
it cited a cost of capture at per ton of saying the study showed coal could be competitive with natural gas
major mining companies are also counting on ccs
bhp the world s biggest listed miner and biggest producer of coking coal used in has set a goal for its own operations to be net zero by the second half of the century in line with the paris agreement on climate change
bhp has spun off many operations into another company south but the indirect emissions from the products it sells remain very high because of the use of its iron ore and coking coal to make steel
it has also said it hopes to expand its oil production
if you re not serious about ccs you re not serious about achieving degrees celsius warming let alone fiona wild vice president climate change and sustainability at bhp said referring to limits the says are needed to avoid a dramatic increase in heat waves floods and droughts
bhp has given money toward ccs research in china but says the technology needs investment and regulatory support from countries around the world including a global carbon tax rather than locals ones something which remains a long way off
poland which depends heavily on coal mostly mined in silesia where the december climate talks will take place has been an advocate for ccs but now emphasizes the role of its forests calling for them to count as carbon sinks
professor stuart haszeldine from edinburgh university s school of geosciences acknowledges the role of trees but says ccs is the only way to reach the goal of net zero emissions by the middle of the century
trees can mop up but one tree takes kilograms of every year
each one of us would need three wembley stadium football pitches to soak up our emissions he said
