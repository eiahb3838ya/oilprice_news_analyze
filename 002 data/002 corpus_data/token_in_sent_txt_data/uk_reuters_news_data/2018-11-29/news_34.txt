update 4-canada's alberta province to buy rail cars to reduce oil glut
ottawa reuters canada s alberta province is in talks to buy rail cars to transport barrels per day of crude oil and expects a deal to be concluded within weeks premier rachel notley said on wednesday as the province tries to move oil stuck in the region because of a lack of pipeline capacity
notley who said the cars were needed to help deal with a glut that has slashed the price of alberta oil told a business audience she was disappointed the federal government was not helping fund the purchase
reuters reported last week that alberta had proposed a joint purchase of two unit trains worth of capacity and estimated the capital cost at about c million million pounds
federal officials are cool to the idea saying that by the time the first cars come on line late next year the supply problems will have eased
alberta estimates it is producing about bpd more than can be shipped using existing pipeline and rail capacity
alberta will buy the rail cars ourselves to move this oil notley said in a speech
we have already engaged a third party to negotiate and work is well under way
we anticipate conclusion of the deal within she later told reporters a deal could be announced before year end
based on the initial talks alberta expects the first bpd of capacity to come online in december ramping up to the full bpd by august with the agreement running for three years
it s a lot of trains and a lot of cars notley told maclean s magazine in a webcast interview on wednesday evening noting it took multiple unit trains to move the equivalent of bpd
the added transport capacity is expected to improve the canadian crude discount by about over the term the provincial government said
under that time line the first rail cars would roll out just as an expansion of enbridge inc s line oil export pipeline is set to start operation although notley argued the rail capacity would still be needed
line only clears the market for three months before we find ourselves back in this situation again she told maclean s
notley said the cost of buying the cars would be fully recouped through royalties and the selling of shipping capacity
her spokeswoman cheryl oates said the province did not anticipate keeping the unit trains beyond
notley said there was no excuse for ottawa not helping and castigated the federal government for proposing tougher environmental standards that she said would make it harder than ever to build pipelines
the supply glut is happening because canada willfully holds alberta s economy and canada s economy hostage she said estimating the losses at c million a day
ottawa denies it is being unhelpful noting that it bought kinder morgan canada ltd s trans mountain pipeline earlier this year
vanessa adams a spokeswoman for federal natural resources minister amarjeet sohi said ottawa was analyzing alberta s proposal about splitting the cost of the unit trains
several canadian crude producers have curtailed production and asked alberta to mandate cuts for other producers
oates said a decision on that would be made within a week
oates also said alberta was not considering a royalty holiday to incentivize output cuts adding a number of tools were being considered including the way royalties were applied
last week federal finance minister bill morneau said businesses would be allowed to write off additional capital investments something that he said oil industry executives had pressed for
