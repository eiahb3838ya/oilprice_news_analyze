houston reuters india s vedanta resources wants oilfield services companies to set up consortia to help develop the blocks in india acquired this year by its cairn oil gas unit the company s chairman said on thursday
vedanta chairman anil agarwal and cairn chief executive sudhir mathur met with executives from services companies this week in houston to encourage the firms to organise consortia to compete for contracts agarwal said in a briefing
they re very encouraged by the blocks and they re looking to work together agarwal said
the company won of the blocks auctioned under india s first licensing round for small discovered fields earlier this year
it expects the blocks will eventually produce barrels per day of oil equivalent said mathur
some of the acquired blocks are near existing cairn fields and could be producing as early as months to months after contracts are awarded he said
vedanta hopes to receive offers from companies including schlumberger nv halliburton co and general electric s baker hughes by the first quarter of next year he said
vedanta hopes to speed up development of the blocks by getting the oilfield firms to organise consortia that would deliver integrated services
it is hoping to get at least four groups to submit bids and will offer incentives to the consortia that can beat production targets he said
if we have one unified team the can be faster said mathur
