update 2-india's adani says to fully fund its troubled australia coal project
adani says it will fully fund australia mine itself does not give timeframe for starting production project has faced raft of delays green groups have strongly opposed the development adds adani green group comment by sonali paul nov reuters india s adani enterprises will fully fund its coal mine and rail project in australia itself the company said on thursday taking a big step closer to building the project that has faced fierce resistance from green groups
adani mining chief executive lucas dow announced the funding milestone for the carmichael mine in a speech in queensland a state that has been counting on the project to create jobs
he did not comment on the actual cost
last year the company said it was looking to borrow under a billion billion to get the a billion project off the ground targeting its first exports in march
having missed many deadlines over the past few years adani also declined to give a timeframe on thursday for beginning construction or the first production from carmichael
adani shrank the project plans early last year to make it more affordable after running into problems lining up financing as banks backed away from funding new coal mines under pressure from investors worried about climate change
it now plans to start by producing around million tonnes a year for the company s own use eventually ramping up to million tonnes for the first stage of the project
a mine of that size with a rail spur would typically take around two years to build
initial output is just a quarter of adani s original plan to produce as much as million tonnes a year spending a billion to build a mine along with rail and port infrastructure
the reduced plan only requires a rail spur connecting to aurizon holdings rail line rather than a whole new competing line and no port expansion which helped drive down the cost
the sharpening of the mine plan has kept operating costs to a mininum dow said in his speech
the project stacks up both environmentally and financially he said
the mine has battled a string of lawsuits from environmental groups who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage australia s great barrier reef
we will fight this to the end
this is not a done deal australian marine conservation society spokeswoman imogen zethoven said in a statement saying the company still needed some final approvals
adani said the only approvals the project now needs are standard clearance for mine management plans
