corrected-italy's di maio warns against party divisions after pipeline u-turn
corrects last paragraph to show chiamparino is a member of the pd party ruling party under pressure over pipeline party leader says can not accept weakness within attention switches to rail link by crispian balmer rome oct reuters italian deputy prime minister luigi di maio called on monday for unity within his movement after the party was forced to renege on an electoral pledge to halt a major international gas transport project
former party sympathisers set fire to the flag in the southern italian town of melendugno on sunday to protest at the government s decision to endorse the trans adriatic pipeline tap that will bring azeri gas into italy via their coastline
ahead of elections in march promised to abandon the project if it took power but after months of deliberations di maio acknowledged at the weekend that the pipeline would have to go ahead
he said italy would face penalties of billion euros billion if it pulled out at this late stage
facing ridicule and criticism on social media di maio said the party was under attack both from inside and out and urged supporters to close ranks in the same way ancient roman soldiers locked their shields together to keep out enemy arrows
today in our army some people are showing signs of weakness we can not allow ourselves such weakness di maio wrote on the party website
the slightest failure on any front means that all the land we have conquered will return to being s the formed a coalition with the league in june and is battling against the restraints of government which sometimes clash with its roots
besides giving way on the tap di maio has also had to ignore party objections to keeping the giant ilva steelworks open
he is also having to back a tax amnesty which was endorsed by the league but is anathema to his own supporters
anxiety di maio said he only found out how much it would cost to cancel tap after he had taken office and gained access to official documents
ministers from the former government denied his version of events and said all documentation was public
they are lying minister matteo renzi said
promised to block tap within two weeks of taking office they won votes on the back of this promise
after six months they changed their mind
we lost the election italy has lost time
di maio has lost face renzi said in a statement
with tap and ilva moving ahead attention is switching to another major project that has always opposed and that is under consideration a rail link known as tav that is meant to connect turin with the french city of lyon
infrastructure minister danilo toninelli who is a member of called timeout on the project in june saying he wanted a analysis of the line
the turin newspaper la stampa quoted di maio on monday as warning the league that his party would implode if tav went ahead
however the league supports the link which involves building a tunnel under the alps arguing that it will strengthen big business in the league s northern heartlands
i hope the government having given the green light to the tap in puglia will not offer up the line and other major projects in the north as a sacrificial lamb to make up to voters said sergio chiamparino a member of the democratic party who heads the piedmont region centred on turin
