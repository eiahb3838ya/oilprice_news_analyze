analysis-under the radar: iran's oil exports harder to track as sanctions loom
london reuters according to saudi energy minister khalid no one has any idea how much oil iran will be able to export after new sanctions against the islamic republic kick in on
but more precisely iran s shipment figures crucial to oil markets are already a mystery
iran s oil exports are becoming harder to measure as ships switch off tracking systems oil industry sources say adding uncertainty over how far sanctions are scaring off buyers
the prospect of more oil heading into storage could make even tougher
amid pressure from president donald trump to cool the price of oil the lack of export clarity adds to the challenge for other opec members chiefly top crude supplier saudi arabia to make up for falling iranian shipments
iran is the producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and estimates of its crude exports in october vary by more than million barrels per day bpd
that amount is enough to cover the oil demand of turkey and move prices in the world market
before trump s may announcement of the sanctions iranian exports were above million bpd
falih acknowledged the challenge in an interview with russia s tass news agency published on
nobody has a clue what iranian exports will be he said
an iranian oil official asked how much crude iran was exporting in october declined to comment
oil prices have extended a rally on expectations the sanctions will test opec and other producers
brent crude on reached a barrel the highest since although it has since eased to
while the saudi minister may have been referring to what happens after sanctions kick in the range of estimates of how much iran is exporting now is already widening
a large set of numbers estimating iranian october exports have been thrown to the market these last few days ranging for million bpd to million bpd which is a massive spread kpler a data intelligence company said
according to refinitiv eikon data iran exported million bpd in the first three weeks of october higher than the million bpd seen in the first two weeks of the month
kpler put iranian exports at million bpd in the first days of october
an industry source who also tracks the exports estimated a similar volume of million bpd in the first half of october including vessels not showing on satellite tracking
a second source initially agreed and later trimmed his figure to million bpd through
it s pretty high i have to admit this source said of estimated exports in the first two weeks of the month
it s possible that there is a at any time adjustments to tanker schedules and variation complicate the task
while easier than in the past due to satellite information the tracking of tankers is still both art and science
another element may be making this harder industry sources say
tankers loading iranian crude sometimes switch off their ais signal an automatic tracking system used on ships only to switch it back on at a later stage of their journey according to oil industry sources
this could create a problem for services trying to pinpoint the exact date or even the exact hour on which a tanker loaded its crude cargo
neither iran s national iranian oil co nor national iranian tanker co responded to an emailed request for comment
concretely we are able to confirm loadings of vessels having shut down ais transponders by other means such as satellite imagery or by tracking tugs which has proven especially valuable given the lack of ais coverage throughout much of the gulf kpler said
iran was believed by oil trading and shipping sources in to be hiding the destination of its oil sales by strategically switching off vessels tracking systems
attempts by reuters to seek official iranian comment on that development both in and for this article received no response
iran insists it will keep exporting oil and says the sanctions will ensure the market remains volatile
iranian oil exports can not be stopped tasnim news agency quoted oil minister bijan zanganeh as saying on
iranian vice president eshaq jahangiri said on sunday despite sanctions iran s oil exports will not fall below a million barrels a as the number of buyers dwindles a large volume of iranian crude is set to arrive at china s northeast dalian port this month and in early november
china intends to cut purchases in november
but iran is undeterred planning to send buyers such as india and china oil for storage rather than consumption making it harder to measure how much oil is reaching the market sources say
analysts in assessing a producer s supply of oil to the market generally do not take into account crude moved into storage
we will give them oil even for our inventory there a source familiar with iranian thinking said referring to india
the same we will do for the data seen to date suggests iranian crude exports in october are still down from at least million bpd in april before trump in may withdrew the united states from a nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions
exports dropped below million bpd under previous sanctions that were lifted following that nuclear agreement
while washington has said it wants to cut iran s oil exports to zero iran and saudi arabia say that is unlikely
the trump administration is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports
iran says waivers will be granted allowing shipments to continue at a lower level as it contends that saudi arabia and other producers can not fully replace iran s crude exports
waivers are expected as saudi arabia and russia can not do it the source familiar with iranian thinking said
