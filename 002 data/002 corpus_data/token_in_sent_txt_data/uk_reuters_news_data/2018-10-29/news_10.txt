coal union boosts giving to democrats as hopes dim for industry revival
washington oct reuters the top coal miners union has put a larger share of its campaign donations behind democrats ahead of the elections than in as dimming hopes for a coal industry revival led by president donald trump reinforce fears about the safety of worker pensions
the united mine workers of america has donated nearly percent of its money to democratic candidates and committees in national races according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance data
that is a roughly jump from when trump courted coal miners with promises of an industry comeback
the umwa pumping more money into races this year has spent of its more than million in total on donations to democrats and advertising supporting them through compared with of to democrats through
the shift marks a setback for efforts by trump and the republican party to maintain control of congress
he had won over many coal miners during the last election with promises to scrap environmental regulations blamed for the industry s demise
while the trump administration has rolled back some environmental protections in its first two years the promise of a coal comeback has yet to be fulfilled
a reuters survey of utilities found that the administration s replacement of carbon regulations will not save power plants from shutdown
ongoing closings of plants have meanwhile pushed coal consumption by utilities this year to the lowest since according to the energy information administration
the umwa said it is not intentionally favoring democrats but rather donating to lawmakers who support miners pension funds which have been undermined by coal company bankruptcies and which the congress has failed to backstop
we have one primary criteria for making contributions to any candidate of either party do they support our fight to preserve our retirees pensions
if the answer is yes then we support that candidate said phil smith the umwa s spokesman
the umwa s support for democrats sagged in when trump focused his campaign on undoing regulations limiting greenhouse gases which he described as part of a war on simon haeder a political scientist at west virginia university said the union s donations this year marked a shift back to the union s core labor values and away from hopes for the promised rebound in coal country
the war on coal narrative is basically over
now the things that people are concerned about are health care and pensions these are the overwhelming issues that dominate their lives he said
still the umwa s support for democrats remains below where it had been earlier in the decade
in the union gave percent of its money to democrats while in it was percent
trump s campaign team did not immediately comment
the republican national committee did not comment
umwa has boosted donations to sitting democratic senators from industrial states who championed funding miners pensions sherrod brown of ohio bob casey of pennsylvania and joe donnelly of indiana who is in a tight race with republican mike braun
but the union has also been favoring a different breed democrat in many races often military veterans who in addition to supporting labor causes can hold their own against republicans that cast democrats as or weak on crime
conor lamb a marine veteran for example won a special house race in pennsylvania earlier this year against republican rick saccone aided in part by coal miner rallies and a umwa endorsement
the umwa is also backing west virginia congressional hopeful richard ojeda a army veteran who served in iraq and afghanistan
once seen as a candidate ojeda now only trails his republican opponent carol miller by a few percentage points in a district trump carried by about a margin in
other democratic veterans with umwa support include anthony brown of maryland chrissy houlahan of pennsylvania and randy bryce in the wisconsin district of republican house speaker paul ryan who is not seeking reelection
underscoring the point the umwa s political action committee in july gave to votevets a progressive political action committee that supports veterans running for office a increase from its donation to the group
people who have been out in the field in the military understand the plight of people who work for a living in the coal mine said jon soltz the chairman and of votevets
republicans who support miner pensions who received umwa donations include representatives david mckinley of west virginia and mike bost and rodney davis of illinois
