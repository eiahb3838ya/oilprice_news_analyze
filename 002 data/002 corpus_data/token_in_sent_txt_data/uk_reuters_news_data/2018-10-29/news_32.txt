update 1-cuadrilla pauses gas fracking again at english site after tremor
london reuters british shale gas company cuadrilla has paused fracking at its preston new road site in northwest england for the second time in two weeks after a tremor with a magnitude of was detected on monday the company said
the tremor is the third recorded at the lancashire site over a magnitude limit set by the government since the company restarted fracking for natural gas on although cuadrilla said one was a so called trailing event which didn t stop production
fracking or hydraulically fracturing involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure
it is opposed by environmentalists and green groups who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with britain s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
however britain s government is keen to reduce the country s reliance on imports of natural gas which is used to heat around percent of britain s homes
cuadrilla said monday s magnitude tremor was way below anything that can be felt at the surface and a very long way from anything that would cause damage or harm
in line with regulations hydraulic fracturing has paused for hours now during which seismicity will continue to be closely monitored well integrity has been checked and verified cuadrilla said in a statement
the company which is percent owned by australia s aj lucas and percent owned by a fund managed by riverstone first attempted to frack gas near the coastal town of blackpool in northwestern england in but the practice led to a magnitude earth tremor
it said then that the quakes at that site were caused by an unusual combination of geological features but they led to an nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out
the government has since introduced a system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude or above is detected
cuadrilla said earlier this month it expects to spend at least three months fracking two wells to determine whether gas extraction would be viable
