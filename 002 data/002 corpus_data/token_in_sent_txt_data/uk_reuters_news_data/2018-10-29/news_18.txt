focus-vattenfall looks to gas and biomass as end of coal power looms
reuters vattenfall is considering converting its german power stations to use fuels including gas or biomass as utility companies in the country brace for a government deadline for phasing out coal altogether
the end of coal is the latest major challenge power firms face in germany whose energy transformation or energiewende has already included a rushed exit from nuclear power and a costly expansion of solar and wind capacity
vattenfall owned by the swedish state operates gigawatts gw of power stations in germany including the gw moorburg site that only opened three years ago and supplies percent of hamburg electricity
the way german power station operators deal with their coal assets is crucial for investors jittery ahead of a december announcement from a commission about how coal plants will be phased out of europe s largest economy
how long moorburg will run significantly depends on what the coal commission decides vattenfall board member tuomo hatakka told reuters
we will also examine alternatives for how to shape moorburg s future for example through the use of biomass
we are at a very early stage in this german rivals enbw rwe and uniper have also started to retrofit coal plants for biomass or gas or are considering such steps to soften the hit to earnings a shutdown of the power stations would entail
an accelerated shutdown of moorburg would be a major blow to vattenfall which spent billion euros billion on the plant
converting plants to fuels such as gas or biomass would also lead to marked drop in generating capacity
hatakka also said vattenfall was planning to shut its reuter west and moabit stations no later than and partially replace them with industrial waste heat waste burning biomass and gas technology
for graphic on dirty addiction click shutting coal plants will be the third major shift for power companies in a decade
they scrambled to cope with a expansion of renewable energy and then faced the sudden decision to stop nuclear power after japan s fukushima disaster
as a result of the policy changes german electricity consumers now stump up more than billion euros a year to subsidise solar and wind power while utilities had to write off billions of euros from their nuclear stations
berlin later had to compensate them for the forced closures
i do believe that wind turbines and solar modules will be enough to generate power in the future said georg oehm chair of the administrative board of the million euro mellinckrodt equity fund
in cheap nuclear power accounted for just percent of germany s power production down from percent a decade ago
meanwhile the share of renewables in the energy mix more than doubled to a third last year
germany aims to raise that to percent by to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments
britain and spain in contrast have taken a more measured and less costly approach to expanding renewable energy and kept nuclear plants on line to provide cheap energy eu data shows
the use of coal to generate electricity in germany is on the wane but it is still the most commonly used fuel
in coal and lignite or brown coal accounted for percent of power production down from percent a decade ago
biomass usually refers to energy generated by burning wood pellets often made from compressed sawdust or other organic matter
the coal commission will likely recommend an for coal plants in the several people close to the commission told reuters
two said ronald pofalla last month recommended a complete phase out between and
the commission declined to comment
the oldest and most polluting plants are expected to be shut down right away though operators may be allowed to compensate for a fall in capacity by producing more power at newer coal plants for a while
enbw said switching to gas and biomass could work for its plants as did rwe germany s leader with gw of production capacity
it said building new plants on coal sites would be an option
premises like that are in demand rwe said adding that it could also sell sites to investors as it did in britain last year by selling its littlebrook plant to real estate investment trust tritax big box
rwe reeling from a court decision this month that effectively delayed brown coal mining in the hambach forest singled out its former plants at voerde and bochum as being potentially attractive for investors
uniper sees similar potential for converting its mw scholven plant in the industrial heartland of north
it is spending at least million euros to retrofit the plant with gas turbines by
as part of the plan uniper has teamed up with german chemicals company evonik to build a km mile gas pipeline to connect scholven to the network of open grid europe
the retrofit however will drastically cut scholven s capacity to about mw because it is harder to turn a profit from gas which is imported mainly from russia and is more expensive than coal
it s open how many employees will still be working here in the future said the plant s manager lars wiese adding that scholven s current workforce of about could more than halve
to make sure its scholven investment will pay off uniper has agreed a partnership extension with an industrial enterprise nearby
it declined to name the partner
companies with operations close to scholven include british oil company bp and chemicals firm saudi basic industries corp sabic
wiese said scholven could also offer services such as delivering compressed air water treatment waste heat utilisation and plant maintenance
leag germany operator of power stations with about gw of capacity declined to comment on its plans
leag is owned by czech energy company eph and private equity firm ppf investments
investors such as germany union investment and norway trillion sovereign wealth fund are watching for cuts in exposure to polluting assets closely as they are not allowed to invest in companies that derive a substantial share of sales from coal
we have to regularly review our stance also with regard to coal said thomas deser senior portfolio manager at union investment which holds shares in rwe and uniper
