uk north sea oil output to resume decline after brief respite
london reuters the uk north sea is set to resume a decline in oil production next year snapping a brief period of growth since consultancy bernstein said in a report on monday
production in the north sea home to the brent global crude benchmark peaked in at million barrels per day bpd and had steadily slipped until when it hit around bpd
in the past four years output has stabilised or even recovered
the halt to the decline stemmed from the of several new fields such as the quad west of the shetland islands and enquest s kraken field east of them
the revival was due also to improved output from existing fields as operators slowed the natural decline of reservoirs by accelerating drilling around wells a process known as infill drilling and ran platforms better bernstein said
graphic uk north sea oil production decline rates improved from around percent in to percent in and percent in the report said
output from fields naturally decreases as they age and their resources dwindle
the stability and even growth from to will prove temporary in nature for this million bpd basin the report said
production from the uk north sea considered the world s first deepwater oil basin is expected to grow by percent or roughly bpd in before declining from to
infill drilling sharply accelerated following a drop in rig rates in the wake of the oil price downturn
in wells were completed more than double the number in
at the same time the production efficiency of wells and platforms increased to percent in from percent in accounting for a gain in output over the period according to bernstein
the decline in output has had a profound impact on north sea producers
nimble often privately owned companies such as siccar point neptune and chrysaor that specialise in extending the life of ageing fields are gradually replacing large producers such as royal dutch shell and bp which were among the first to develop the basin but see less opportunity there today
