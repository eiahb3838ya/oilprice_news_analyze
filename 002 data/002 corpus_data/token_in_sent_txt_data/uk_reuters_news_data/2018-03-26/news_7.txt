refile-update 1-china oil futures launch may threaten primacy of u.s. dollar: ubs
corrects grammatical error in first sentence by kate duguid new york march reuters china s launch on monday of its crude futures exchange will improve the clout of the yuan in financial markets and could threaten the international primacy of the dollar argues a new report by hayden briscoe apac head of fixed income at ubs asset management
this is the single biggest change in capital markets maybe of all time briscoe said in a telephone interview
the launch of the oil futures denominated in china s renminbi currency also known as the yuan is china s first commodity derivative open to foreign investors
this marked the culmination of a push by the shanghai futures exchange shfe to give the world s largest energy consumer more power in pricing crude sold to asia
already on monday unipec the trading arm of asia s largest refiner sinopec has inked a deal with a western oil major to buy middle east crude priced against the shanghai crude futures contract
this helps cement the exchange s viability and challenges the system in which oil deals are executed in dollars
this would decrease demand for the greenback and boost inflation
china surpassed the united states in to become the world s largest oil importer
nevertheless the existing price benchmarks brent and wti crude are both in dollars and importers across the world must buy dollars in order to conduct oil deals
but the move to trade oil in yuan will diminish the role of the greenback in global financial markets argues briscoe
pricing oil in renminbi and launching a trading hub will raise china s prominence and integrate it further in global markets
and demand for yuan from foreign investors eager to participate in the shanghai international energy exchange will boost the currency s value and divert trading away from the dollar
appetite for dollars would shrink driving the price of the currency down
the renminbi s prominence will only grow with china s consumption demand will increase percent to million tons per year in according to bp
this power will let china bypass the system and demand that its oil purchases be priced in yuan as seen in monday morning s unipec deal
this may be even more likely in deals in which china has outsized leverage such as their offer to buy percent of saudi aramco
as it stands oil exporters store the revenue from their oil sales in treasury bonds a process known as as a result the rise of the would also jeopardize a key source of financing for deficit spending
