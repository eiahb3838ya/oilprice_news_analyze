oil prices are on the ups driven by rising geopolitical risk in the middle east said stephen innes head of trading for at futures brokerage oanda in singapore

that may begin to change gradually going forward as monday saw the launch of chinese crude oil futures out of shanghai asia despite being the world s biggest and fastest growing oil consumer has so far not had a benchmark
few analysts doubt that asia is overdue a financial oil price benchmark and that china with its vast consumer and production base is a prime location for it
the government in beijing seems determined to support it and i hear a number of firms are being asked or pressured to trade on it which could help said jeff brown president of energy consultancy fge
despite this brown said there were concerns over regulatory interference as seen in other chinese financial commodity markets including iron ore and coal
the fact that the government is encouraging the exchange and also is not shy about stepping in to occasionally change the rules may discourage international players brown said
