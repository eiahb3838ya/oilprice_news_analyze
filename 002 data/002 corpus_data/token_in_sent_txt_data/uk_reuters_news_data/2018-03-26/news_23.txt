as uber bows out to grab, drivers and riders bemoan loss of choice
singapore march reuters a mix of concern and disappointment met uber technologies inc s deal to sell its southeast asian business to bigger regional rival grab as drivers and users of the firms took in the prospect of sharply reduced competition
the services throughout asia have long relied on discounts and promotions for consumers and incentives for drivers which made for tough competition pushing down profit margins
grab said the uber acquisition accelerated its path to profitability in its core transport business as it would become the most southeast asian platform
while drivers were split on which of the two services offered better compensation they generally expected fares to go up with the reduced competition
rennu mahajan who has driven a combined years for both companies in singapore said some of her driver friends were concerned because now they would not be able to switch to the other app
but i am personally not worried
i am quite confident that the fares will go up
if incentives don t go up fares will increase and we will still get a little bit more said mahajan
on its singapore website grab said passengers could expect better service with more drivers and transport options available on one app and that fares would not change
for drivers it said the benefits and incentives structure remained the same
according to mobile data analytics firm app annie grab was ranked fifth among top apps based on monthly active users in singapore in versus uber at no

in indonesia was at no
just ahead of grab
whether the merger would eliminate competition in singapore will be the focus of government review a spokeswoman for the land transport authority said
we will ensure that no one single market player dominates the sector to the detriment of commuters and drivers she said
malaysia s land transport authority issued a similar statement saying it will work closely with relevant consumer and various regulatory agencies such as the malaysia competition commission to safeguard passengers from unfair terms
for both ricky tan who has driven for uber in singapore for over a year and andre pereira who uses both services grab s ability to exert greater control on prices was cause for concern as it may drive away customers to public transport
as the only app left grab can easily increase prices pereira said
while there are smaller apps in each market grab and uber have a presence across the region while indonesia s popular only operates within its home country
drivers in cambodia one of the last frontiers in the battle of apps say competition is fierce and the market will not be easy for grab
a lot of people are used to using uber grab isn t strong yet uber is stronger grab just arrived said krem sokhom
the apps have also grown in popularity in countries with fewer public transportation options such as vietnam
le minh quan who drives with both grab and uber in vietnam said without competition they could enforce higher commission or reduce their support and that s worrying
before we had a choice but now we don banker le hoang ngan also uses both
whoever gives me discount codes i ll go with it if not i ll skip
so one down will just give me less option he said
in thailand services by privately owned vehicles are illegal but many drivers work with both uber and grab
there was no shortage of drivers and riders who liked the service that grab had to offer
grab provides enough promotions for my liking and even if sometimes they don t i don t mind paying the full price said choltanutkun a magazine writer who said she preferred grab s services and relied on it in her everyday life
i prefer convenience and what s the quickest reporting by aradhana aravindan and dewey sim in singapore mai nguyen in hanoi prak chan thul in phnom penh patpicha tanakasempipat in bangkok editing by jack kim
