land degradation drives mass migration, climate change - experts
bogota march thomson reuters foundation billions of people live on farmland that is deteriorating and producing less food and this situation could force hundreds of millions of people to migrate over the next three decades a major report said on monday
the study which is backed by the united nations said climate change and worsening land quality could see crop yields halve in some regions by and warned that larger tracts of degraded land meant conflict over resources was more likely
decreasing land productivity also makes societies more vulnerable to social instability particularly in dryland areas where years with extremely low rainfall have been associated with an increase of up to percent in violent conflict said robert scholes the report s
the report was written by more than experts from the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes a global scientific group
the body said that as degraded land becomes less productive through deforestation overgrazing flash floods or drought people many of them poor farmers are forced to migrate to cities or abroad
and it warned when arid or dryland areas degrade further deserts spread which means lower crop yields
in just over three decades from now an estimated billion people will live in drylands scholes said in a statement
by then it is likely that land degradation together with the closely related problems of climate change will have forced million people to migrate he said
increasing demand for food has led to the rapid expansion and unsustainable management of crop and grazing lands which are key factors in worsening land quality the report said
it said the problem had reached critical levels in many areas with wetlands particularly badly affected
land degradation drives climate change with deforestation which contributes percent of greenhouse gas emissions and soil erosion worsening the problem it said
land degradation biodiversity loss and climate change are three different faces of the same central challenge the increasingly dangerous impact of our choices on the health of our natural environment said robert watson an atmospheric scientist and chair of ipbes in a statement
the report said land could be restored by planting trees using crops and drained wetlands
