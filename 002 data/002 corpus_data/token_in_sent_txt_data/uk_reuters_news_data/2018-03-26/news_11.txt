update 1-iter nuclear fusion project avoids delays as us doubles budget
paris reuters the united states has agreed to double its planned budget contribution to the iter project to build a prototype nuclear fusion reactor avoiding delays to the international project this year its director said on monday
washington cut the united states contribution from a scheduled million to million and had planned to cut its contribution from a scheduled million to million

he added that if the united states would make up for missing cash contributions of about million for the period iter would remain on track in future years
the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter project is a cooperation between europe the united states china india japan russia and south korea to build a prototype fusion reactor to generate electricity in a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun
with an estimated cost of about billion euros billion the project is more than halfway towards the first test of its plasma by and first fusion by
iter member countries contributions to the project are not mainly in cash but in kind as they finance the manufacturing of iter components via their own national companies
these parts are then shipped to france and assembled on iter s cadarache southern france site
but there is also a cash contribution which for the was million euros per year in the to period or about million euros bigot said
we hope that at least maybe a small part of the contribution could be in cash so as to give a political signal to the other iter members said bigot who was appointed iter director in
iter s main supplier is general atomics which is building the project s central solenoid an tall magnet that will be one of the first components to be installed by
