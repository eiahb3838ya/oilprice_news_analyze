in the long run yuan crude price will mirror the moves of brent he said
the september contract opened at yuan per barrel versus a reference point of yuan jumping as high as yuan in the first few minutes
the jump came after brent futures for may delivery opened above per barrel for the first time since january on expectations saudi arabia may extend supply cuts into as well as over concern that the united states may sanctions against iran

brent and wti in contrast were down by that time weighed down by concerns over a looming trade dispute with china
chinese exchanges count each side of a trade the buy and the sell as two lots meaning the total oil changing hands was lots equal to million barrels
