egypt economy stabliises under sisi but prices remain to be tamed
economic growth up under sisi economists expect further acceleration but austerity under imf deal hurts egyptians inflation falls from peak but achieving single digit rate will be tough by patrick werr cairo march reuters egyptian president abdel fattah has revived economic growth and tackled pressing problems in power and gas supply but as he heads for a second term he must juggle austerity under an imf programme with the need to tame inflation
sisi inherited an economy in tatters when he took over the presidency in requiring aggressive reforms that have largely stopped the rot while hurting most egyptians through a currency devaluation and withdrawal of some price subsidies
he s now at the crossroads that every egyptian president has found himself in said reham eldesoki an independent economist long focused on egypt
he needs to push forward on intensive reforms to move forward in building services and industry and to make egypt really sisi s performance in consolidating the gains over the next four years he is set to cruise to victory in a presidential election which began on monday will be watched well beyond egypt s borders
european nations particularly worry that any faltering of reforms could worsen unemployment and encourage young egyptians to cross the mediterranean illegally aggravating already sizeable flows of migrants from north africa
sisi who led the military s overthrow of egypt s first president in was elected president the following year after a prolonged period of popular protests had scared away many investors and foreign tourists
successive governments reluctance to devalue the overpriced currency had led to an acute foreign exchange shortage dampening imports and pricing egyptian exports out of foreign markets
sisi s signature economic achievement so far has been concluding a deal with the international monetary fund in
under this the government has raised the price of subsidised fuel to ease the huge burden on the budget increased tax to percent and devalued the egyptian pound against the dollar by more than half
many say the reforms were needed to stablise egypt as it recovers from the chaos and tackles an islamist insurgency
however the currency reform hit the middle classes particularly hard while inflation remains high poverty has increased and unemployment is not going down as quickly as people had hoped
economists see some grounds for hope
gdp growth increased to percent in the three months to december from a low of percent in according to the central bank
i think we should see growth continuing to escalate said mohamed abu basha an economist with egyptian investment bank efg hermes
tourism has space to recover and consumption and investment should continue to recover over the next few egypt once a net energy exporter had struggled to get enough fuel to run its antiquated power stations with the country of million people suffering regular blackouts
under sisi the government signed construction contracts for new plants and arranged for floating gas terminals to allow more imports
the power shortages were soon brought to a near halt
sisi has also acted to break a logjam in gas exploration and development
likewise he moved to reduce vast arrears in payments to international energy companies for oil and gas
this has encouraged them to revive their activities in egypt leading to several gas discoveries including the zohr field the largest in the mediterranean region
zohr operated by italy s eni shipped its first gas at the end of
other fields that were brought on stream included bp s atoll and west nile delta
the government says the country will be in gas by the end of this year
sisi launched a series of large infrastructure projects designed partly to put egyptians back to work
many won praise such as new roads and expanded electricity capacity
more controversially sisi has begun work on several megaprojects some of which economists say will produce little immediate return
these include dredging a new branch of the suez canal
sisi insisted the project be completed within a year adding to the cost but because of a worldwide trade slowdown canal revenue was little changed
he has begun building several new desert cities including a billion new administrative capital east of cairo
egypt has also been negotiating with russia for a new billion nuclear power plant
many investors and economists worry that the army is becoming too involved in these projects and in other ventures threatening to crowd out private investors
austerity measures imposed under the imf deal pushed annual inflation to percent in august
by last month the rate had dropped back to percent
but more planned measures will make it difficult to bring it down further
the government is widely expected to raise fuel prices again at the start of the new fiscal year on july
the challenge now will be to get inflation down to single digits abu basha said
we know that they will eliminate most of the fuel subsidies by the end of the imf programme in reporting by patrick werr editing by samia nakhoul
