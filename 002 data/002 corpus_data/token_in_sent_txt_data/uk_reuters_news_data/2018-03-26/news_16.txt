judge approves philadelphia refiner's bankruptcy plan
wilmington march reuters a bankruptcy judge approved philadelphia energy solutions plan for chapter bankruptcy in a delaware court on monday after a series of objections to the plan were withdrawn
the confirmation in the bankruptcy court of delaware removes the biggest hurdle for the philadelphia refiner as it seeks to rebound from financial difficulty after filing in january citing the high cost of complying with the nation s biofuels obligations
the state of pennsylvania had filed an objection based on tax liabilities but that was withdrawn
the environmental protection agency and the refiner had previously agreed to a settlement that allowed it to shed about half of its roughly million in outstanding compliance costs under the renewable fuel standard
the court has to approve this settlement as well on april
