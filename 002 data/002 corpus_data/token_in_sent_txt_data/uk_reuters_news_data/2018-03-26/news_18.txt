analysis-denmark faces dilemma over russian gas pipeline
reuters denmark is under pressure to rule on whether a new russian pipeline supplying gas to germany can be built near its baltic coast a decision that puts it in the line of fire from friend and foe alike
denmark does not want to act alone in resolving one of the biggest foreign policy quandaries that the small european union nation has faced since the cold war
but its search for a united eu stance on the proposed pipeline is deadlocked by divisions among member states over whether to do more business with moscow despite its military incursions in ukraine and syria and accusations it used a nerve agent in an attempted assassination on british soil
the danish government is facing fierce lobbying by russia eu allies and the united states over the billion euro billion nord stream project championed by president vladimir putin and financed by five western firms
they are under huge pressure from all sides one senior eu official said
there is no definite timing for a decision which had been expected this spring but has been delayed while denmark considers the security implications
but officials say it can not be postponed indefinitely
a danish veto under new legislation allowing it to do so on security grounds would force russia which supplies about one third of europe s gas needs to find a new route for the pipeline
this is not about gas it is one of the most important foreign policy decisions in denmark since the cold war said senior foreign policy researcher hans mouritzen at the danish institute for international studies
a delay would weaken russian gas giant gazprom s hand in talks with ukraine for a new gas transit deal after and create uncertainty for the firm s partners germany s uniper and wintershall shell austria s omv and france s engie
access to cheap russian gas to offset declining dutch production takes priority for nations in northern europe particularly germany but eastern european countries fear the pipeline will make the eu a hostage to russian gas
graphic eu imports of russian gas in the nordic states where moscow s military posturing in and around the baltic sea has rattled nerves security is the main concern
the united states has played up these worries in its opposition to nord stream
confidential guidance from washington seen by reuters for embassy officials in meetings with eu governments argues that the pipeline could strengthen russia s projection of power in the region
sweden and finland have yet to issue permits for the km mile pipeline to run under the baltic sea through their exclusive economic zone which is regulated by law
germany did so earlier this year
but only in denmark would the undersea pipe pass through sovereign territorial waters giving it a greater say
diplomat sandra oudkirk who visited copenhagen on her first european tour as deputy assistant secretary for energy diplomacy last week said washington does not want nord stream built and wants to understand if the danish law is a means to that end
danish officials say they are loath to take sides and are unwilling to rush the decision
in some ways this is too big for denmark one official said
under the new legislation danish diplomats are drafting an opinion on whether foreign and security policy concerns justify blocking km of the pipeline passing through danish waters
the opinion may take account of objections by eu allies that the pipeline would undercut eu support for kiev by depriving it of gas transit fees increase dependence on gazprom or concentrate gas supplies along a single route to germany
lawmakers gave the government powers to reject the pipeline s application for a permit last november but had expected support from brussels where efforts to reach a consensus have stalled
denmark is one of eu states to expel russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack in britain
it was too early to say whether the attack would be included in the foreign and security assessment of nord stream foreign minister anders samuelsen said
if denmark acts alone to veto the project that could have unwelcome consequences
if we are to handle this difficult case alone denmark will end up in an unfortunate situation in relation to both russia and germany said martin lidegaard a senior lawmaker with the danish social liberal party which is against the project like the rest of the danish opposition
with ties between moscow and kiev badly strained after russia s annexation of crimea and a insurgency in eastern ukraine russia wants to reduce dependence on ukraine as a gas transit route
any serious delay to the billion cubic meter a year pipeline could imperil that plan as gazprom seeks to extend two years of record gas sales to europe
the nord stream consortium says it is carrying out surveys for an alternative route north of the danish island of bornholm outside denmark s territorial limits
that would cost time and money
we have to plan for the possibility its financial officer paul corcoran told reuters
it will cost more he admitted
pipeline contractor allseas has said a change of route would add less than percent to total costs
but sources close to the matter doubt it will be as easy to reroute the pipeline as the company says
the nord stream company takes it as a real threat said a senior eu source who has seen an estimate of the cost of changing routes
i was shocked by how high it was the source said without disclosing figures
nord stream declined to comment on the cost of rerouting saying it did not wish to speculate about alternatives and its impacts
for now denmark is holding off as long as possible on making the decision
in this case we re hurrying very slowly a government source said
