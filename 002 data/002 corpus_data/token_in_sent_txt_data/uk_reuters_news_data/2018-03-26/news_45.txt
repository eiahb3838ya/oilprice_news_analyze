column-two risks threaten commodities, one bullish, one bearish: russell
launceston australia reuters it s not quite time to run up the red flags but some recent developments in commodity markets suggest it may be time to start looking for them in the locker
the are two main factors that appear to be emerging that may threaten an end to the current quite rosy picture surrounding demand for commodities such as iron ore steel and the metals most exposed to the battery boom cobalt lithium and nickel
on the supply side there is a renewed rush of optimism that may set off another round of mining companies for assets or sinking way too much capital into projects approved on the back of too bullish forecasts
on the demand side the drums of a trade war are starting to beat a little louder with beijing announcing duties on up to billion of imports on march
that came after the trump administration announced plans for tariffs on billion of chinese goods in addition to import taxes on steel and aluminium
while equity markets take the first hit in the opening salvoes of what markets fear may become a trade war it is most likely that commodities will suffer longer and harder if the worst does come to pass
commodities are generally seen as more exposed to the global growth outlook and a trade conflict will almost certainly result in economic growth being downgraded
this is especially important for commodities as they also tend to be the top performers when an economic cycle is mature as is the case with the current global recovery in the decade since the financial crisis
however there is still a chance that trade wars remain mainly in the sphere of rhetoric rather than sustained damaging actions
whether the seeming optimism among major mining companies about the future results in a return to the bad old days of and poor deals remains to be seen
certainly the company bosses seem at their most bullish in recent years with the world s biggest miner bhp talking up prospects for demand for minerals
andrew mackenzie bhp s chief executive told a conference in switzerland on march that the world may have to spend trillion annually to develop and upgrade its infrastructure
if we look at china s belt and road initiative demand for steel is expected to increase by an additional million tonnes over the next decade mackenzie said
these figures were echoed by bhp s president of iron ore edgar basto at last week s global iron ore and steel forecast conference in perth in a presentation that went a long way toward justifying the company s planned billion south flank iron ore project in western australia
while the new mine is mainly planned as replacement for depleting existing operations bhp is far from alone in planning new operations with rivals rio tinto and fortescue metals group also looking at signing off on developments
graphic china belt and road initiative the industry is still a long way from undertaking the same sort of massive expansion it did in the years from in the flush of optimism over china s demand for ingredients
but there are some similarities emerging with chinese demand once again at the forefront
both mackenzie and basto made much of china s belt and road initiative bri the government plan to build infrastructure and energy projects across asia and africa as part of a new silk road promoting trade and development
the problem is that for now much of the bri remains at the vision stage and very little at the implementation phase
if china was really undertaking vast infrastructure projects across south and central asia as well as in africa it would be logical to expect that it was exporting significantly more capital machinery and materials such as steel
instead foreign investment fell percent in from the year earlier and this accelerated in january with a drop of percent in the prior months according to official figures
steel exports slumped percent last year and were down percent in the first two months of compared to the same period last year
exports of cement and clinker dropped percent in from the prior year and while vehicle shipments did jump percent last year this was mainly because of an percent surge in car exports which is most likely not related to bri spending
bhp rio tinto brazil s vale and fortescue all had sunk billions into expanding iron ore capacity resulting in a collapse of the material s price
it has since recovered with argus media quoting benchmark percent iron ore delivered to china at a tonne on march down from at the end of last year but still almost double the low of hit in december
it took the price slump for bhp and rio to somewhat reluctantly back away from their forecasts that chinese steel output would rise to billion tonnes and the risk is now once again the bri reality may be somewhat less rosy than the current optimism
more positive for miners looking to enter the battery metals space was the percent increase in china s exports of storage batteries
but as some mining executives have pointed out doing deals at the right price in sectors the market sees as hot is challenging
there s probably about percent of those opportunities out there that you can really add value with mark cutifani chief executive of anglo american told the ft commodities global summit in switzerland last week
but in most cases you are going to pay high prices for assets so it s a hard way to make money he added
it s too early to say that the major miners are about to leap headlong into the old cycle of expanding supply to meet forecasts but the cash generated from the recovery in commodity prices over the past two years may be starting to burn holes in their pockets
