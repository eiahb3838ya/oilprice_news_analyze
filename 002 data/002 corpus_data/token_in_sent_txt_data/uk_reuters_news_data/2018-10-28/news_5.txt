update 3-brazil leftist's hopes of catching bolsonaro slim, but gap narrows
paulo reuters the chances of brazil s leftist presidential candidate fernando haddad narrowing the lead of jair bolsonaro took a hit when he failed to win a crucial endorsement on saturday a day before the two face off in a runoff election
however polls published late saturday from brazil s two biggest surveying firms showed momentum shifting toward haddad though he still trails bolsonaro by a solid margin
former candidate ciro gomes said in a video on social media that he would not take sides in the election campaign withholding support for haddad of the workers party pt
gomes a former governor of ceará state in the northeast is influential in brazil s poorest region
his endorsement could have given haddad a big lift in the south american country s most polarized election in a generation
but rodrigo janot brazil s influential former prosecutor general under whose watch the country s unprecedented investigations and prosecutions of endemic political graft took place tweeted late saturday that he would vote for haddad
that was a blow to bolsonaro s work positioning himself as the only candidate
i think we are at the brink of a process that could push our democracy beyond its limits janot told reuters late saturday
freedom equality and fraternity always and at any haddad narrowed bolsonaro s lead to percentage points in an ibope poll released late saturday a survey that gave him percent compared with bolsonaro s percent
as only two candidates remain and those figures discard voters who say they will annul their votes that in practice means haddad needs to win percentage points to overtake the
in a datafolha poll also released late saturday bolsonaro had percent of voter backing compared with percent for haddad
while haddad failed to get gomes to endorse him he won the backing on saturday not just of janot but of brazil s most popular youtube host felipe neto who has million followers on his channel
a popular judge joaquim barbosa who jailed several top pt leaders for corruption also came out for haddad
gomes finished third in the first round vote with percent of the vote behind bolsonaro s percent and haddad s percent
gomes had hoped to be the standard bearer of the left but was outmanoeuvred by jailed pt leader luiz inacio lula da silva who is serving a prison sentence for corruption and anointed haddad as his
bolsonaro a former army captain is poised to become brazil s first president since the end of the military dictatorship
the congressman has promised to crack down on crime and corruption pitching himself as the candidate for voters fed up with political graft and violent crime
bolsonaro s sudden rise comes as brazil finds itself in its worst recession and embroiled in its biggest corruption scandal after the leftist pt ran the government for of the last years
until his presidential run bolsonaro was best known for defending the former military regime and its use of torture
he has faced charges for misogynist racist and homophobic rants
the supreme court rejected the racism charge but has not ruled on a charge of inciting to rape in a case in which he told a fellow lawmaker she was not pretty enough to rape
he called the case political persecution
a week ago bolsonaro vowed to run all the red leftists out of brazil or put them in jail harsh words that probably contributed to the narrowing of his lead
youtuber neto said he had been neutral until that point
everything changed when bolsonaro said he will sweep opponents out of the country or into jail
in years of pt i have been robbed but never threatened neto said by twitter
in the final two days of campaigning bolsonaro has sounded more moderate in his statements backing down on a plan to follow president donald trump s example and pull brazil out of the paris climate change accord
on friday he told xingú tribes people they had a right to charge royalties for mining and hydro electric power generation on their reservations a proposal welcomed by some natives but rejected by anthropologists and environmentalists who see the tribes as the last guardians of the amazon rainforest and its biodiversity
you are as brazilian as any of us he said in a video posted on social media
i want you to have the right to use your land and exploit its biodiversity and mineral in his final hours of campaigning in sao paulo haddad accused the bolsonaro camp of sweetening their candidate to make him appear what he is not
he is a truculent and dangerous person and that s how he should be presented to the nation he said
