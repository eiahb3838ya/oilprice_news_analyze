france will ask auto makers to fund new car trade-in payments
paris reuters france will ask carmakers on monday to help fund an expanded program to get older polluting cars off the road with incentives for new ones the french finance minister told daily le parisien on sunday
the existing scrappage scheme which mainly targets old diesel cars is already oversubscribed
the widening of the incentive is partly funded by a hardening of the tax on polluting vehicles adopted on tuesday which should raise million euros million pounds to reach a total of million next year to finance contributions for the purchase of more cars
the minister s agenda says he will hold meetings with environment minister francois de rugy and carmakers such as renault and psa to discuss measures aimed at speeding up the vehicle fleet s ecological with francois de rugy we will ask carmakers tomorrow to contribute to the conversion premium finance minister bruno le maire told le parisien in an interview adding that the incentive should be more efficient and reach more french people
the level of carmakers contribution to the wider scheme would have to be discussed with them he said
newspaper les echos earlier this week said french carmakers were already discussing between them the implementation at their expense of a bonus for the conversion of old vehicles
the precise outlines remained under discussion
there has been a global backlash against cars since leading german carmaker volkswagen admitted in to cheating exhaust tests
the scandal has boosted investment in electric vehicles and incentives for green cars
german chancellor angela merkel and her coalition partners agreed earlier this month on plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners incentives and hardware fixes
but carmakers had said the focus should instead be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles which would bring a boost in sales albeit at discounted prices
volkswagen on thursday said it will offer incentives and a bonus for scrapping older diesel vehicles in germany
separately le maire dismissed calls to reduced taxes on fuel prices which have surged at french petrol stations after a spike in crude oil saying this would contribute to climate change
france s budget includes an increase in diesel taxes of more than cents per liter and those on gasoline by almost cents an increase that the government has tried to downplay comparing it to soaring oil prices
