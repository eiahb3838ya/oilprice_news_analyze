update 2-uk watchdog threatens full investigation into sse, npower utility merger
london reuters britain s competition watchdog said the planned merger of sse s retail power and gas business in the uk with npower owned by german rival innogy could lead to higher prices for customers and warrants further scrutiny
the watchdog said the merger would be referred for a longer phase investigation unless the parties offer acceptable undertakings to address the competition concerns
we know that competition in the energy market does not work as well as it might said rachel merelie senior director at the competition and markets authority cma
however competition between energy companies gives them a reason to keep prices down
we have found that the proposed merger between sse retail and npower could reduce this competition and so lead to higher prices for some customers
we therefore believe that this merger warrants further sse said on thursday it remained confident the proposed merger will benefit customers and the energy market as a whole and that it will be able to demonstrate this to the cma
the utility will take its time to assess cma s response
combined sse and npower have around million customers making the new company second only to centrica s british gas which has more than million customer accounts
energy prices have come under the political spotlight after household bills doubled over the past decade to an average of about a year
the government now aims to impose price caps for a large portion of customers
the proposed merger between sse and npower risks damaging the development of a more competitive energy market reducing consumer choice and threatening to be a bad deal for energy consumers said rachel reeves a british lawmaker who chairs the business energy and industrial strategy committee
the british market is dominated by the big six of british gas sse iberdrola s scottish power npower and edf energy which account for about percent of the retail electricity market
but aside from facing price caps on their most common tariffs standard variable tariffs these companies have also been rapidly losing market share to smaller rivals they had percent of the market just three years ago
