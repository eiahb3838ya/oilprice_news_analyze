china orders local governments to ease burden on renewable power firms
shanghai april reuters china has ordered local governments to ease the burden on renewable power generators by strengthening guaranteed purchase agreements and giving them priority access to new grid capacity the national energy administration nea said on thursday
according to china s renewable energy law power transmission companies are obliged to take on all the electricity generated by local renewable sources but many projects have still been left with inadequate grid access a problem known in the industry as curtailment
the nea said in a notice that it would strictly implement the guaranteed renewable power procurement system and it would also order grid firms to promptly accept grid access applications from wind solar and biomass power projects
for regions that fail to make the guaranteed purchases the nea will take action to slow the pace of project construction
the nea also urged local authorities to reduce land costs and stop imposing arbitrary charges and unreasonable project approval conditions on renewable energy firms
local governments have been ordered to pay back fees that have been illegally collected from renewable companies
two grid companies in northwest china are currently being sued by an environmental group for failing to maximise purchases of renewable power causing more than million yuan million in lost earnings
china wasted billion kilowatt hours kwh of wind power in as a result of poor grid connectivity percent of total wind generation
wasted solar amounted to billion kwh percent of total generation
in data published this week the nea said the situation improved somewhat in the first quarter of with wind curtailment at percent and solar at percent
the government is cutting the subsidies available to renewable energy providers after costs have declined over the last decade but it is looking for other ways to encourage clean energy projects
the nea said in the notice that it would encourage financial institutions to increase the credit available to renewable energy developers and would also encourage the issuing of green bonds
authorities are also now ironing out the details of a mandatory renewable energy quota system that will compel grid firms and big power consumers to acquire a minimum proportion of electricity from clean sources
