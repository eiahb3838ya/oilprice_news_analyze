update 1-fortum plays down risks from russian media criticism
helsinki reuters finnish utility fortum on thursday played down concerns that moscow might block its planned purchase of a stake in uniper after an article in a russian government newspaper described fortum as a real threat to russian security
the article here in rossiskaya gazeta this month by economist mikhail delyagin sparked worries in finland that moscow might turn down fortum request for approval to buy a percent stake in germany uniper
uniper has some power plants in russia and the deal has to pass a russian law that effectively prohibits foreign states or entities from gaining control over strategic national assets
fortum ceo pekka lundmark said on thursday however he was confident of winning approval for the deal
we are in good discussion regarding russian clearances and we expect to receive them by he told a news conference
we have not received such messages or information that we would not be getting these asked about the article lundmark said the negative articles that we have seen do not reflect the views of the russian government our view of the business environment is rather stable
we are calm in that fortum recently completed a billion euro billion investment program in russia and last year generated sales of billion euros in the country
the risks of doing business in russia are a familiar theme for the company
a few years ago fortum was in talks with russia s gazprom over a plan to restructure russian hydro and thermal power company
fortum was supposed to get a controlling stake in a planned hydropower company if it took a stake in a finnish nuclear project here which needed new investors
fortum made that investment but the hydropower talks made slow progress and last month fortum said it had abandoned hopes for the gazprom deal
several finnish companies have a long history in doing business in neighboring russia
some including retailers kesko and stockmann have recently pulled out of the market
