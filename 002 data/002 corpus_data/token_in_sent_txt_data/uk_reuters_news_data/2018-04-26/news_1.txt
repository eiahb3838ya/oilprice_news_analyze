first solar to build new u.s. panel factory in win for trump
april reuters first solar inc on thursday announced it will expand its domestic manufacturing the second such announcement by a solar firm this month that has been an apparent effect from trump policies on trade and taxes
first solar inc will spend million to build a new solar panel factory in ohio creating jobs the company said in a statement
the factory will be located near an existing facility the company has in perrysburg
strong domestic demand for solar energy and changes in tax policies underpinned the decision said first solar s senior vice president of global manufacturing mike koralewski
last week first solar rival sunpower corp said it would buy a domestic panel maker as it sought to dodge the impact of percent tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the administration of president donald first solar benefits from having a technology that is not subject to tariffs
its panels are made from cadmium telluride while the tariffs apply only to traditional silicon solar products
as a result solar project developers have increasingly sought out first solar s panels and in february the company said it would restart some production at its ohio factory that was stopped late last year and hire new employees to run those lines
the new factory will produce first solar s series solar panel technology
in a statement provided by first solar commerce secretary wilbur ross said the company s domestic expansion was exactly the result we had hoped tempe first solar is one of the world s largest solar energy companies
most of its manufacturing is done in malaysia
the ohio expansion will triple the company s domestic capacity
construction will begin later this year and is contingent on state and local incentive packages first solar said
