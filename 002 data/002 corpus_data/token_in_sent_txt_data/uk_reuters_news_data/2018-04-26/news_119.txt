rpt-column-oil prices, or how i learned to stop worrying and embrace the cycle: kemp
london reuters discipline has become the oil industry s favourite word as it emerges from the deepest and longest downturn in a generation
senior executives are pledging to maintain a cautious approach to investment and spending despite the recovery in oil prices over the last two years
business leaders and shareholders are still scarred by the memory of project spiralling costs and frenzied drilling during the last boom and the painful adjustments during the subsequent slump
corporate leaders are under pressure to focus on returning more cash to investors rather than indulging in expensive and risky plans to boost production
the case for a more disciplined approach has been powerfully argued by my counterpart liam denning at bloomberg this is big oil s quarter to lose april
this time really will be different according to the industry with earnest promises to learn from past mistakes
but there are good reasons to be sceptical
the oil industry has been characterised by deep and prolonged cycles since the first modern well was drilled in
deep cycles are the natural condition of the oil industry and there is no reason to think the future will be any different
cyclical behaviour is the oil market s most distinctive characteristic and deeply rooted in the industry s structure rather than mistakes by its leaders
price cycles stem from the low of supply and demand the prevalence of expectations and behaviour and the lumpiness of new discoveries and investments
they also stem from the prevalence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms which alternately amplify and dampen the initial impact of price changes
the oil market is really multiple for crude fuels refining services engineering construction drilling skilled labour steel raw materials etc
each market is subject to its own feedback mechanisms operating at different speeds and timescales with constantly changing supply and demand
balancing the oil market would mean balancing all these simultaneously
in practice the are never simultaneously balanced or in a state of equilibrium except accidentally and never for very long
economist paul frankel s essentials of petroleum published in remains the best explanation of the oil industry s cycle
frankel noted the basic features of the oil industry made for continuous crises with hectic prosperity followed all too swiftly by complete collapse
frankel concluded the oil industry was not and had an inherent tendency towards extreme crisis
as a result he was sympathetic to the need for leading interests and planners to act as eveners and stabilizers
frankel urged a form of managed competition in which oil producers would recognise their common interests and coordinate their policies at strategic level while remaining competitors at tactical level
i m not sure how this distinction would work in practice
frankel did not explain it in detail and seems to have been unsure himself
at different times frankel argued that the role of adjusters and eveners had been played by monopolies such as standard oil the major international oil firms and governments sometimes in combination
but this was the least convincing part of frankel s argument
there is no evidence that any monopoly or combination of interests has ever managed to stabilise the market for long
even the long period of apparent stability during the and came to a dramatic end with the oil shock of which was rooted in the long period of low prices during the previous two decades
the price cycle can not be tamed
companies and countries have to learn to ride with the volatility
we ve never been good at predicting these price cycles neither when they occur nor their duration
we don t spend a lot of time even trying exxon mobil s rex tillerson told investors in march
how the future is going to look we take no particular view on it other than to recognise that whatever it is today it will be different sometime in the future and after that it will be different in my nearly years with exxon
i didn t learn anything about my ability to foresee that
i learned a lot about how you deal with the major companies and countries are always cautious in the first stages of a cyclical expansion when memories of the previous slump are still fresh
in the early stages of the last boom between and the major companies were notoriously conservative about investment worried the rise in prices would not prove sustainable
ironically the slow response of investment and production accelerated the boom and pushed prices much higher than they would have risen otherwise
but the combination of high and seemingly sustainable prices eventually triggered a rush of investment not just from the majors but also the independent shale producers
the sluggish response of investment to changes in oil prices is one of the biggest causes of instability in the oil market
however it is not clear the major oil companies could or should have behaved any differently
if they had adopted an even more restrictive approach to investment prices would have risen higher providing an even sharper incentive for other suppliers to fill the gap most likely shale producers
the history of the oil industry is of attempts to restrict investment and production to stabilise prices
in every case price stabilisation efforts have been undone when rival sources of supply were developed to fill the gap pennsylvania

there has never been a shortage of petroleum resources
every attempt to restrict investment and production has failed because it encouraged the development of new and alternative sources
opec and the oil majors may exercise some influence over oil prices in the very short term but in the medium run they have proved to be not
if the oil majors were to attempt to be more disciplined this time around the resulting rise in prices would simply accelerate the development of alternative sources of supply as well as curbing demand growth
the majors would end up with lower prices and a smaller market share
much the same fate awaits opec if it tries to tighten the oil market too much again
what about control over costs
here too the oil majors and other producers are at the mercy of the industry cycle
costs for everything from skilled workers and drilling contracts to steel raw materials seismic surveys engineering and a host of other oilfield services are
in the aftermath of a slump it is easy for corporate leaders to preach the need for continued cost control but as the cycle matures and the supply chain tightens cost pressures inevitably build
oilfields are a declining asset
if oil companies want to remain in the game they must invest accept the price cycle and manage it as best they can
most oilfields will produce for decades so producers must take a view through the cycle and accept the inevitable volatility
