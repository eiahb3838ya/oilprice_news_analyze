update 2-no oil majors win contracts in iraq oil licensing round
baghdad reuters iraq failed to attract investment from the top global energy companies in its oil and gas contract auction on thursday with no major firms winning any bids and only italy s eni submitting an offer
the oil ministry held an auction to award contracts to international energy companies with blocks on offer near the borders with iran and kuwait and in offshore gulf waters
we have decided to speed up the development of border fields after five decades without investments leaving them without investments meant wasting the oil wealth of the country oil minister jabar said ahead of bidding
i say to the companies that will bid thank you because this means trusting iraq and it means services and education for the citizens who live in the regions where you are going to operate he added
five of the exploration blocks failed to attract any bids
three went to united arab crescent petroleum two to china s and one to united energy group also based in china
eni made two unsuccessful bids while no other majors bid
fourteen companies had expressed interest and bought a package containing the bidding documents and terms for the blocks the ministry had said on april
it is a very successful round
as an iraqi company it s not a commercial matter it s about investing and developing the production of iraq crescent executive director abdullah told reuters
the blocks were initially to be auctioned in june
the date was brought forward to april then postponed to april to give bidders more time the oil ministry had said
a combination of factors was behind the failure by five blocks to draw bids said abdul mahdy director general of iraq s petroleum contracts and licensing directorate
some cover former battlefields some are hard to access and the one offshore plot needs more data he said
ameedi said another round could be held for the five blocks but provided no further details
the contracts on offer excluded oil from the companies revenue established a link between prevailing oil prices and their remuneration and introduced a royalty element
oil companies operating in iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases which include crude and oil such as liquefied petroleum gas
opec s producer after saudi arabia iraq decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in reducing baghdad s ability to pay such fees
companies including bp exxon mobil eni total royal dutch shell and lukoil have helped iraq expand production in the past decade by over million barrels per day to about million bpd
the kurdistan regional government produces oil and gas from fields it controls in northern iraq under a model that is more profitable to companies
the new contracts offered by baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oilfields they develop
iraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel
iraq hopes to end gas flaring by
flaring costs the government nearly billion billion pounds in lost revenue each year and could cover most of its unmet needs for power according to the world bank
below is a summary of iraq s bidding round detailing the blocks on offer and the winning bids in terms of remuneration as percentage from oil revenue
the winners were companies offering to take the lowest percentage
block winner bid crescent percent khashim crescent percent naft khana percent zurbatiya no bid shihabi no bid huwaiza percent sindbad united energy percent fao no bid jabal sanam no bid khider crescent percent arabian gulf offshore no bid the remuneration is before tax and after the payment of royalties and cost recovery
royalties are set at percent of total revenue of the field and tax at percent of the company s income
for example if the revenue from the field s production is the operating company s costs and its percentage remuneration percent it will first pay to the government a quarter of which is the revenue minus cost in royalties and split the remaining with the government along the percentage agreed taking and giving the government
