skinny and sweet: u.s. refiner earnings depend on the oil diet
new york april reuters smaller independent refiners with less complex facilities are surging in the stock market of late as investors expect strong earnings growth thanks to the recent fall in price of their primary cost light sweet crude oil coming out of west texas
over the last years the nation s biggest refiners spent billions building units capable of turning heavy sour crude into gasoline diesel fuel and other products
but the shale revolution has boosted crude production to a record million barrels per day upending the global oil market by adding millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix
a majority of that new production is light sweet west texas crude
recent trends have turbocharged this shift full pipelines in west texas where light oil originates from have depressed prices for midland texas crude to more than lows
on the other hand opec production cuts and supply issues among big producers of heavy crude like venezuela and mexico have raised the cost of heavy sour oil
that gives an advantage to some independent refiners equipped for lighter crude which is less complicated to process
investors have been buying up independents with less complex refineries like delek us holdings inc and hollyfrontier corp as they could benefit from low permian prices for several quarters to come
to have your major feedstock be in such abundant supply is unequivocally a positive for refining said matthew blair a refinery analyst with tudor pickering holt
the benefits of that are going to be unevenly spread through the to be sure shares of most refiners have been rallying as refining margins recently hit a high and gasoline demand is near record levels
results are likely to show strong profits across the sector beginning with valero energy corp on thursday
however over the last three months as permian crude has slumped delek shares have soared returning more than percent with hollyfrontier close behind at percent besting all other independent refiners
the two are also ranked highest among refining companies in the thomson reuters earnings revisions model which looks at analyst revisions for earnings and revenue and recommendation changes
light grades are distinguished based on what is known as api gravity a measurement of density
a majority of shale crude output growth is at the top of the scale with api gravity above degrees
more complex refineries are configured to run on grades of crude with an api gravity of around degrees
most refineries can not simply take in only lighter crude because it would affect operational efficiency
in order to process more shale from here on refiners will need access to more heavy crude too morgan stanley analysts said in a note last week
about percent of delek s crude slate is based on permian crude according to a march company presentation
the company did not respond to a request for comment
hollyfrontier is less reliant on the permian it accounts for percent of its crude slate said craig biery director of investor relations
however its imports of heavy crude have exclusively been discounted canadian oil in the six months through january according to energy information administration data
the company has existing pipeline commitments for that oil so it can take full advantage of those discounts said barclays analyst paul cheng
valero marathon petroleum corp and andeavor three of the largest independent refiners have had more downward earnings revisions over the last days than other independent refiners according to thomson reuters data
those refiners with multiple facilities on the gulf coast rely more on imports from latin america
for the six months through january valero imported million to million barrels a month and only to percent is from canada according to the eia with the bulk from mexico venezuela or other latin american nations
the spread between international benchmark brent crude and crude a proxy for import costs has surged to more than a barrel the biggest premium seen all year
valero has only about percent of its crude slate directly linked to crude and its exposure to midland is even smaller cheng said
a march investor presentation says sweet crude makes up an average of percent of its gulf refineries
the company declined comment
