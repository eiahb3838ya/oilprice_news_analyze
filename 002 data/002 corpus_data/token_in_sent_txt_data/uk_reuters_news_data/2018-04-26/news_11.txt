update 4-british interior minister refuses to quit over immigrants' treatment
london reuters british interior minister amber rudd said she had no plans to resign after giving contradictory statements about meeting targets for deportations deepening a scandal over britain s treatment of caribbean immigrants
for nearly two weeks british ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the windrush generation invited to britain to plug labour shortfalls between and had been labelled as illegal immigrants
the windrush scandal overshadowed the commonwealth summit last week in london and has raised questions about theresa may s stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the brexit referendum
may apologised to the black community on thursday in a letter to the voice britain s national newspaper
we have let you down and i am deeply sorry she said
but apologies alone are not good enough
we must urgently right this historic rudd said at a lunch with reporters in parliament that it had been a difficult few weeks but she was committed to the home office
she told lawmakers on wednesday that britain did not have targets for the removal of immigrants but on thursday was forced to clarify her words after leaked documents showed some targets did exist
i have never agreed that there should be specific removal targets and i would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people rudd told parliament in answer to an urgent request for a statement from the opposition labour party
the immigration arm of the home office has been using local targets for internal performance management rudd said
these were not published targets against which performance was assessed
but if they were used inappropriately then this will have to opposition lawmakers called for her to resign
isn t it time that the home secretary considered her honour and resign asked the labour party s home affairs spokeswoman diane abbott
rudd told reporters she did not want immigration officers to be set targets for the number of people who need to be removed from britain and distanced herself from government statements it wanted to create a hostile environment for illegal immigrants
i have not approved or seen or cleared any targets for removals she said
looking ahead i will not be doing rudd who is tipped by some as a future prime minister also denied a story in the sun newspaper on wednesday that she is raising money for a future leadership bid when may resigns
i am just thinking about staying in the game she said
may s spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in rudd
the spokesman added that the idea of removal targets went back a number of decades under successive governments
the home secretary is working hard in order to address the concerns that have been raised in relation to windrush and to ensure they are addressed and put right the spokesman added
may has apologised for the windrush scandal and promised citizenship to all those affected
but the fiasco has raised awkward questions about how the pursuit of lower immigration after britain s exit from the european union sits alongside the desire to be an global economy
some of the windrush migrants have been made homeless lost their jobs been threatened with deportation and denied benefits according to the guardian newspaper
the crisis has focussed attention on may who as interior minister set out to create a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants imposing tough new requirements in for people to prove their legal status
she said in her letter to the voice the government would do whatever it takes to end the anxieties faced by those affected
this country is your home and britain would not be britain without you she said
