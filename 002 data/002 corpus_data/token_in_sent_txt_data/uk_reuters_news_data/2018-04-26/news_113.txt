graphic china coking coal imports sgx price by clyde russell launceston australia april china s imports of coking coal staged a strong comeback in march after a weak start to the year and may be poised for further strength as steel output rises
imports of coking coal used to make steel jumped to million tonnes in march up percent from the million tonnes recorded in february according to customs data released on april
however the robust outcome in march went only some way to reversing the weaker trend so far this year
imports for the first quarter as a whole totalled million tonnes a drop of percent on the same period last year
in some ways the decline in coking coal imports isn t that surprising given the winter restrictions placed on steel production as part of the authorities efforts to limit air pollution
however steel production in china wasn t actually weak over the first quarter with output rising percent from the same period in to million tonnes
in fact march s production of million tonnes was the most since september according to data from the national bureau of statistics
what is the likely explanation is that steel production was curbed in the north of country where winter pollution concerns are most acute but mills in other parts of china were able to increase their output to take advantage of good prices
the higher steel output in the first quarter doesn t fit well with the lower imports of coking coal but there are some factors that may help explain some of the issues
the first is that steel mills have been using higher quality iron ore therefore requiring less coking coal to produce the same amount of raw material
certainly recent months have seen widening premiums for iron ore and traders have reported mills have been preferring quality over quantity
a switch to quality probably isn t enough by itself to explain lower coking coal imports and it s doubtful that domestic production has been making up the shortfall
china s total coal production including both thermal and coking grades fell to the lowest in five months in march totalling million tonnes
output was up percent on the same period in to million tonnes suggesting that if anything there was only a modest increase in domestic supply of coking coal
it s likely that steel mills and producers of coke which is made from coking coal and used in blast furnaces have been running down inventories
coking coal prices in the first quarter certainly wouldn t have been encouraging additional buying beyond what was absolutely necessary to sustain operations
the main domestic price dalian commodity exchange futures hit the highest in a year in late january closing at yuan a tonne on
however recently the price has been in retreat with the contract dropping to yuan a tonne at the close on wednesday down almost percent from the january high
coking coal futures on the singapore exchange which track the price in australia the world s largest exporter of the fuel have also declined in recent weeks ending at a tonne on wednesday
this is down almost percent since the january peak of a tonne a high
lower prices may well encourage steel mills and coke producers to restock especially if steel prices and demand hold up in the coming months
both of china s largest providers of coking coal australia and mongolia have the capacity to supply more and competition between the two is somewhat limited given they largely supply different regions
both mongolia and australia have seen volumes supplied drop in the first quarter at a rate just below the overall drop of percent
however supplier russia has bucked the trend with china s imports increasing percent as buyers take advantage of the price advantage of russian cargoes over those from australia
