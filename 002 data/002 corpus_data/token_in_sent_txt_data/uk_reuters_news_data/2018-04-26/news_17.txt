total ceo says libya raised no objections over waha deal
total ceo says deal closed on march says informed libyan authorities says total will develop field in libyan interests by bate felix paris april reuters libyan authorities were informed before french energy major total closed a million deal with marathon oil to take over the firm s percent share in the waha concession total s chief executive said on thursday
patrick pouyanne told analysts during total s earnings call that despite reports that the deal could hit a snag over libyan displeasure libyan authorities raised no objections before it closed on march
we informed libyan authorities far in advance that the deal had been settled between total and marathon and we were intending to close it by the end of march pouyanne said
from a strictly legal point of view neither in libyan law nor in the oil concession agreement is there a request for a formal approval he said adding that as of now the shares of marathon in libya were with total
we informed them
there was a target for us for the end of march to close the deal we wrote to them again before there was no objection and so we decided to libya is considering whether to intervene and its options include pushing for better terms sources have told reuters
libya s national oil corporation said on monday any such deal must have the approval of noc and the libyan authorities and any attempt to conclude the sale prior to this approval would be in breach of the concession contractual agreement
a government source also said the deal needed formal libyan approval
pouyanne said total was able to move in and rapidly close the unplanned deal because it was willing to take in the political risk of the libyan situation
libya an opec member has been mired in seven years of turmoil that have hit its oil sector
total can take these kinds of libyan risk in our portfolio more than marathon was willing to keep them which is why we did the deal he said
total said the waha concession represented about million barrels of oil reserves with production of around barrels per day
the cost of access to these barrels was quite attractive due to the political situation
maybe it created some moves in libya after they discovered the value of the deal but the terms of the concession did not change pouyanne said
seeking to sooth concerns in libya pouyanne said the company was in permanent dialogue with libyan authorities
we will give them all the comfort they are legitimately requiring to reassure them of our willingness to develop the waha field in the national interest of libya he said
