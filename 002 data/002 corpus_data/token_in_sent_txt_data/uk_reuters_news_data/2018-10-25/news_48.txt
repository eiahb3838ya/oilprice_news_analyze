china gave the to build four reactors in
the first unit at sanmen in zhejiang province was originally scheduled to go into full operation in but the unproven technology has been beset by years of delays as a result of safety concerns and unanticipated design problems

westinghouse which was acquired by brookfield business partners from japan s toshiba in august hoped china would serve as a shop window for its design which boasts enhanced passive safety features as well as higher levels of generation capacity
westinghouse filed for bankruptcy last year after its nuclear projects in the united states were also hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns
china also hoped that technology would be at the centre of its own ambitious nuclear power plans after signing a technology transfer agreement in
