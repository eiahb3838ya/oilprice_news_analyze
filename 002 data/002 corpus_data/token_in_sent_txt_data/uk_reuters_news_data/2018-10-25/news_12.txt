rpt-insight-swamped with plastic waste: malaysia struggles as global scrap piles up
pulau indah malaysia reuters hundreds of sacks filled with plastic waste from the united states britain south korea and spain spill onto the streets of an industrial zone in pulau indah an island town just an hour s drive from kuala lumpur and home to malaysia s biggest port
the stench of burning plastic and fumes from nearly a dozen recycling factories wafts through the neighbourhood even as more of plastic waste are unloaded
pulau indah ironically the name means beautiful island in malay is one of many towns in malaysia where illegal plastic recycling factories have popped up in recent months as the southeast asian nation became the top choice for plastic waste exporters from around the world
the trigger for this dumping deluge was a chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year which disrupted the flow of more than million tonnes of plastic scrap a year
malaysia quickly became the leading alternative destination importing nearly half a million tonnes of plastic waste between january and july from just its top
dozens of factories have opened up in malaysia to handle that waste many without an operating licence using technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal
the situation is getting worse especially with more and more illegal plastic recycling factories yeo bee yin malaysia s minister of energy technology science climate change and environment told parliament last week
used plastic is recycled into pellets which are then used to manufacture other plastic products but the process comes with pollution risks
plastic unsuitable for recycling is burnt which releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere
or it ends up in landfill potentially contaminating soil and water sources
yeo said she does not want malaysia to be the trash can for developed nations but housing minister zuraida kamaruddin who oversees the waste management department told reuters that the government also does not want to miss out on a business that could be worth billions
both ministers are members of a government committee studying its options for dealing with the growing pile of plastic waste
in the pulau indah industrial zone reuters reporters saw nearly a dozen recycling plants many of them without signboards or company names though government data shows only two factories in that area have a licence to import plastic waste
one of the bigger ones jingye manufacturing sdn bhd was shut down in august for not having a licence according to an official notice seen by reuters
but workers in the factory and others nearby say it reopened within weeks and when reuters reporters visited earlier this month it was operating
plastic waste was stacked up within the premises and all along the road
the factory supervisor declined to comment
company records show jingye was set up in malaysia in october three months after china said it would ban imports of foreign waste from
reuters could not reach the owners of the factory and no contact details were listed in records
one worker in the industrial zone who did not want to be identified said there were as many as eight illegal factories in the zone and many openly burned plastic that can not be recycled
every night they burn
i see black smoke at night so i go over and ask him why are you trying to kill me they ignore me he said
in the nearby district of kuala langat authorities found factories operating illegally many of them run by chinese companies according to housing minister zuraida
around were shut down by authorities in the last three months after residents complained of open burning of plastic and health complications
it is unclear how the illegal factories are sourcing plastic waste
zuraida said some of the companies that have a permit to import and recycle such waste are subcontracting to illegal factories as they lack the capacity to handle such volumes
malaysia s imports of plastic waste from its biggest jumped to tonnes between january and july versus tonnes purchased in all of and tonnes in
the united states the world s top exporter of plastic waste sent tonnes of such waste to malaysia between january and july nearly twice as much as it sent to second top destination thailand according to the united nations trade database and the institute of scrap recycling industries
britain another big plastic waste exporter sends a quarter of its waste to malaysia also more than any other country
environment minister yeo estimated that the plastic recycling industry would earn malaysia billion ringgit million pounds this year
zuraida said she planned to introduce new rules soon that will make it harder for factories to qualify for an import licence
i understand plastic recycling is quite lucrative
so i am also thinking should we miss this economic opportunity
this is something the committee will study zuraida told reuters
if such an option is pursued malaysia would do so on strict terms require green technology and allow factories to operate only in heavy industrial areas she said
the factories are currently located haphazardly including near or within residential areas
in kuala langat southwest of kuala lumpur a massive recycling factory nestled between palm plantations was shut down three months ago
but metre tall towers of plastic waste mostly consumer packaging material from the united states britain france netherlands germany and australia were still piled in the front yard
a large plot of land next to the factory has been turned into a dumping site for scrap
