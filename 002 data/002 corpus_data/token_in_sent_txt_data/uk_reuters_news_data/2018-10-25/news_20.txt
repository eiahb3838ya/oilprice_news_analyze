update 2-saudi arabia says oil market could shift to oversupply in q4
riyadh reuters saudi arabia said on thursday the oil market could be shifting towards oversupply in the fourth quarter of the year as oil inventories rise and demand slows and the top oil exporter will mirror such changes in its production
we are of the view that the market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks saudi opec governor adeeb told reuters on thursday
so we want to be watchful not to and cause a substantial inventory build who heads a joint opec and committee which monitors compliance and market fundamentals said after a recent meeting of the panel known as the jtc in vienna
opec and oil producers agreed in june to relax their oil cuts but the group said on thursday they may need to change course because of rising inventories and economic uncertainties
asked about concerns of slowing economic growth in countries such as china a major oil consumer said growth risks are a concern particularly in emerging countries we are aware that oil demand responds to global macroeconomic factors and will be responding with our partners proactively
he added saudi arabia does not push oil to the market but responds to its customers needs and said the increase in the kingdom s oil production over the past months was in response to rising demand
saudi arabia produces only what its customers ask for not more
we saw strong demand for our crudes in the third quarter and we have increased our production accordingly he said
saudi energy minster khalid said on the kingdom would soon raise output to million barrels per day bpd from the current million
as we and other producers raise production spare capacity will tighten by the same amount said
however in the case of saudi arabia while the remaining spare capacity will tighten further in november it will definitely not be tapped until there is market demand for it he added
he said oil demand was expected to seasonally fall towards the end of the year
we have the flexibility to adjust our production to mirror it he added
the opec governor is typically one of the most senior posts in a country s opec delegation after the energy minister
