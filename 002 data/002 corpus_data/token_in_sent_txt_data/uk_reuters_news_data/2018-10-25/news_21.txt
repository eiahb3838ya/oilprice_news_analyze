corrected-retired hedge fund boss martin taylor says he plans to get back in the game
this version of the story corrects description of nick barnes in paragraph also corrects names of founders to taylor eoghan flanagan and rory landman in paragraph by maiya keidan london reuters british investor martin taylor who closed his billion hedge fund nevsky capital and retired at plans to get back in the market with a fresh perspective and a new firm
in december taylor and nick barnes who he considers a of nevsky told investors it was not likely they could reproduce past gains and gave clients their money back
it was a rare move in the industry and it came after a volatile year in financial markets with falls in oil commodities and emerging markets
in a colourful letter to investors taylor said nevsky s future returns would be hampered by distorted macroeconomic data the rise of highly unpredictable nationalist governments and algorithmic funds exacerbating volatility in stocks
but after nearly three years out he is launching global equities hedge fund crake asset management in october to bet on shares and trade underlying commodities
the strategy mirrors that of nevsky
i did retire and i did say i was never going to come back and i absolutely did mean it at the time but obviously i ve now changed my mind said taylor who has spent the past two years teaching and trading his own money
with hindsight what i realised is i was exhausted
i d been running a hedge fund manager for more than years he told reuters
now i ve had a sabbatical it s left me refreshed and i want to do this for another two investors who declined to be identified told reuters they welcomed the move
the rise of algorithmic trading during his break meant that by the time he returns markets may be closer to a tipping point at which it will become easier for a fund like his to make money he said
the increasing dominance of passive investors will eventually make underlying markets more inefficient because there will be fewer and fewer genuinely active managers in the market he said
at his new firm taylor will be joined by yuri maslov a former partner at nevsky and richard walker who has previously worked at societe generale according to filings with britain s companies house
taylor will be the fund s chief investment officer and manager while maslov will be head of research and walker chief operating officer and
crake will also be adding four to five analysts over the next several months and aims to have the team in place in april
it will begin accepting outside money from

having had years off i m very keen to get back to my first love but i want to do it properly
that is why it won t be another year until i take money from clients he said
i need to build and train my team nevsky fund plc s assets peaked at billion and it returned percent annually net of fees over years
its average peer returned percent over the same time period data from industry tracker hedge fund research showed
nevsky was launched in by taylor eoghan flanagan and rory landman who left the business in and is now senior bursar at trinity college cambridge
taylor is a fan of west ham united soccer club and he opposed britain s departure from the european union
he donated around pounds to britain s labour party between and according to electoral commission data
i m absolutely going to remain in britain regardless of what happens with brexit he said
