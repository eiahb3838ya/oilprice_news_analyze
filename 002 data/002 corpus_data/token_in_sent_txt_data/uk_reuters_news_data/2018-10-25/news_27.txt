injury rates jump at coal giant murray's west virginia mines
oct reuters injury rates have more than doubled at five west virginia coal mines acquired by murray energy in according to a reuters review of federal data as the firm sharply increased the amount of coal produced per manhour
although injuries and productivity rates rose over the same period the causes of the increase in injuries remain unknown and could include a host of factors in the complex business of underground coal mining
murray the nation s largest underground coal mining company with about employees producing more than million tonnes of coal annually bought the mines from rival consol energy
those mines now account for more than half the firm s production
the injury rate at the five mines averaged per work hours last year up from in the last year consol operated them according to data from the
mine safety and health administration
that s the highest injury rate for the group in a decade and percent above the national average for underground mines the data show
at the same time coal output per manhour at the five mines rose nearly percent since to tons in according to msha figures
by comparison the industry average in the last year for which data is available was tons per manhour
murray spokesman cody nett said that productivity has no correlation to injury rates
strategies that murray has used to increase output at the mines such as continuing production through the overnight maintenance shift and keeping machinery and vehicles running during shift changes are standard practices widely utilized throughout the industry nett said
nett said the injury rate at the former consol mines was inflated by false claims from workers who took time off for other reasons
he also attributed the doubling of injury rates since murray acquired the mines to by the previous owner during the preceding years an assertion disputed by the department of labor and its mines safety and health administration msha which collects the data
regulators did cite consol for in a audit
but msha later revised the company s data to include injuries that consol initially failed to properly report said msha spokeswoman amy louviere
asked about the agency s adjustments nett said it was flat out incorrect that the mine safety agency had corrected consol s data
consol spokesman zach smith declined to comment on the company s reporting violations
the injury rate at the five mines translated to about injuries requiring days off work in
workers at the five sites have suffered injuries so far in according to the msha data
murray controls six other mines in kentucky ohio illinois and utah and each has an injury rate below the national average according to the data
the company has won numerous safety awards in recent years including from the government s national institute of occupational safety and health in
davitt mcateer a mine safety expert in west virginia who had directed msha under former president bill clinton said that many factors could have played into the increased injury rates at the murray mines in west virginia
those particular mines are decades old meaning miners are having to work deeper more complicated coal seams with aging equipment and infrastructure he said adding that such conditions are more dangerous for workers
the company s ceo robert murray is among the coal sector s most vocal advocates for rollbacks of environmental and safety oversight frequently arguing that government regulation is unnecessarily onerous and costly for companies
murray energy has also sued the government to invalidate an rule called the pattern of violations rule intended to beef up enforcement of safety standards against repeat offenders
that case filed in the district court for the southern district of ohio is now in settlement negotiations with the trump administration
