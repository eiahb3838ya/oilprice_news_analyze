update 1-trump appoints chatterjee to head energy regulation panel
adds details about current chairman stepping down background washington oct reuters the white house said on wednesday president donald trump has appointed neil chatterjee an avid supporter of subsidizing aging coal and nuclear power plants as chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission
chatterjee a republican from kentucky who was a ferc commissioner had been a backer last year of a directive by energy secretary rick perry that the commission ultimately rejected to bail out coal and nuclear plants
ferc an independent office of the department of energy makes decisions on electricity transmission and interstate natural gas pipelines and facilities
chatterjee served as ferc s acting head for several months last year before kevin mcintyre was sworn in as the chairman of the agency in december
mcintyre who underwent surgery last year for brain cancer will step down to become a commissioner on the panel he said in a letter posted on ferc s website on wednesday
mcintyre also a republican sat out ferc s monthly open meeting last week and the previous one in september
i very recently experienced a more serious health setback leaving me currently unable to perform the duties of chairman with the level of focus that the position demands mcintyre said in the letter
perry had issued ferc a directive in to bail out aging nuclear and coal plants that are suffering competition from plants that burn abundant and cheap natural gas
ferc rejected the plan in january
but in coming months it could consider similar plans by the administration to support the plants for national security reasons
earlier this month president donald trump nominated the republican bernard mcnamee another prominent supporter of subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants to a vacant seat on the panel
critics said if the senate approves mcnamee it could make ferc more politicized because he helped roll out perry s bailout plan while head of the energy department s policy office
