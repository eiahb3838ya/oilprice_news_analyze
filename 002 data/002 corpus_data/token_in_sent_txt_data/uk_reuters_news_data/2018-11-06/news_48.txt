update 2-iran oil exports to plummet in nov, then rebound as buyers use waivers
reuters iran s oil exports have fallen sharply since president donald trump said at he would reimpose sanctions on tehran but with waivers in hand the islamic republic s major buyers are already planning to scale up orders again
the original aim of the sanctions was to cut iran s oil exports as much as possible to quash its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and curb its support for militant proxies particularly in syria yemen and lebanon
but the exemptions granted to iran s biggest oil clients china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey allow them to import at least some oil for another days and could mean exports start to rise after november
this group of eight buyers imported over percent of iran s roughly million barrels per day bpd of oil exports last year refiniv eikon data shows
the decision by the to grant waivers represents a departure for now from the stated aim of reducing iran s oil exports to zero said pat thaker regional director for the middle east and africa at the economist intelligence unit
iran s crude exports have fallen significantly from at least million bpd in april before trump in may withdrew the united states from a nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions although estimates vary
as a result of pressure by washington iran s oil exports in november may not exceed million to million bpd according to industry estimates
companies that monitor iran s shipments are already seeing a drop in tanker activity this month
we ve only seen tankers loading at or signalling for iranian terminals in november so far which is significantly lower than what we usually see at the beginning of the month said kpler a data intelligence company
according to refinitiv eikon data iranian crude exports have fallen to million bpd so far in november
an industry source who also monitors such shipments said the figure was likely to be on the low side
iran expects to maintain crude exports of at least million bpd after the reimposition of sanctions a source familiar with iranian thinking said as the global market is too tight to allow a full stoppage
in october iran s crude exports were estimated at million bpd by kpler and million bpd by another firm that monitors iranian shipments
japan s trade minister hiroshige seko said on tuesday that japanese buyers of iranian oil were expected to resume imports from the islamic republic after the country received a waiver from sanctions
s p global platts reported on tuesday that south korea would be able to take around million barrels a month bpd of iranian crude and condensate under a sanctions waiver
japan and south korea close allies had toed the washington sanctions line and stopped buying crude from iran
india iran s oil customer also cut orders ahead of the sanctions hoping its effort to reduce reliance on tehran would pay off in washington and win it a waiver once the sanctions restarted
even china locked in a bitter trade war with the united states bowed to pressure from washington and dialled back imports
trading sources said several asian oil importers were looking to increase their orders for iranian oil soon
two chinese sources familiar with the matter said the country would be allowed to buy bpd of iranian crude during the exemption period
that would be about half the daily average china has been importing from iran since january trade data showed
one of the sources said the united states had attached some strings to the import allowance including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods which were being evaluated before placing new orders with iran
both sources were not permitted to talk to the media about iran sanctions and declined to be identified
a merchant trader who also declined to be named said enquiries for cargoes from iran are coming in from several asian buyers
the exemptions have reduced fears of a supply shortage taking pressure off companies governments and economies around the world that have struggled with the surging cost of fuel
trump facing crucial midterm elections that may cost republicans control of the congress said on monday he wants to impose sanctions on iran s oil gradually citing concerns about shocking markets and causing global price spikes
that has helped to take the sting out of the sanctions threat which helped to lift international benchmark brent crude futures to highs of almost a barrel in early october
brent prices are now about percent lower than that peak and have barely budged over the last two sessions
now it will be key to watch what happens after the exemptions expire in days the merchant trader said
iran s oil exports rose sharply after the previous round of sanctions were lifted in early
including condensate an form of crude shipments peaked around million bpd in according to trade data in refinitiv eikon
