china's industrial heartland shandong to overhaul energy intensive industries
new plan to cut excess capacity in polluting industries will merge small refineries cut crude processing capacity aims to build mega energy complexes move downstream to cut pct of steel mills in key cities beijing nov reuters china s shandong province home to a fifth of china s oil refining capacity is planning to consolidate dozens of small refineries and build complexes as part of a new plan to overhaul energy intensive industries
the plan published on monday is aimed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness in seven sectors including steel fertilizer aluminium coking coal and oil refining
it comes amid an ongoing push by beijing to tackle excess capacity in heavy industry and shift its economy to higher sectors and improve its dirty air
we will cap capacity of steel petrochemicals coking coal and aluminium and achieve a drop in energy intensity as well as total emissions from these sectors the shandong government said in the document published on its website
the province home to percent of china s private refiners wants to reduce total crude processing capacity from million tonnes per year or million barrels of oil per day bpd to million tonnes
it will merge refiners with less than million tonnes annual capacity by and later target those with up to million tonnes or about bpd before
it also wants to significantly reduce the output of diesel and gasoline by
the move is seen as positive for china s independent refining industry currently facing fierce competition in local fuel markets and subject to frequent shutdowns due to environmental scrutiny
the small private refiners known as teapots have a small share in domestic petrochemical markets which are dominated by state companies such as sinopec and foreign majors like exxon mobil
shandong is being forced to reshuffle its oil industry under pressure from companies and foreign oil majors said zhong jian chief analyst with consultancy jlc
shandong said it will lobby for policy support from beijing including seeking approvals for new mega refining complexes and getting crude oil import quotas for new refineries
in the future the province wants to build huge refining complexes with million tonnes of yearly processing capacity and shift production to chemicals products
the document also outlined plans for other sectors such as capping annual fertilizer output at million tonnes and reducing the number of coking coal producers from to in two years
it also said percent of steel mills built in polluted cities such as jinan zibo and binzhou will be forced to relocate to coastal areas
the province said it would give incentives such as tax breaks and credit lines to help companies relocate and compensate workers made redundant during the relocation process
