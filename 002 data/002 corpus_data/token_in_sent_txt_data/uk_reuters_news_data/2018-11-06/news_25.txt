update 2-italy's enel plays down talk of move for colombia's electricaribe
milan reuters italy s enel played down talk it was interested in buying colombian distributor electricaribe after citing acquisitions as one of the reasons for raising its debt guidance on tuesday
enel cfo alberto de paoli told analysts the utility had paid a fee to look at the books of electricaribe but said this made sense for a power company operating in the area
a lot of things have to happen before we have a clear interest in it he said adding that many regulatory and legal changes would first need to take place
recent press reports have said that enel could be interested in buying electricaribe
europe s biggest utility is one of the leading players in latin america where it makes more than a quarter of its core earnings
it agreed in june to spend almost billion billion to buy a majority stake in brazilian power company eletropaulo and also said it could spend more than billion to buy a latin american fibre company
on thursday it said its acquisition of eletropaulo and restructuring costs in chile had helped to bump up its debt pile at the end of september to about billion euros billion
it said it now expected net debt this year to be between billion and billion euros about billion to billion euros higher its previous forecast
but the group one of the world s biggest listed green energy companies said it expects higher cash flow this year and reiterated core earnings guidance of billion euros
de paoli said the group was working on another deal to sell assets but was not sure if it could be closed before year end
enel which also controls spanish utility endesa said core earnings ebitda in the first nine months of the year rose percent to billion euros boosted by its green energy business and better margins in brazil after the eletropaulo acquisition
renewables were once again the basis for the group s positive performance while geographic diversification was important to cope with the negative trend in certain currencies ceo francesco starace said
