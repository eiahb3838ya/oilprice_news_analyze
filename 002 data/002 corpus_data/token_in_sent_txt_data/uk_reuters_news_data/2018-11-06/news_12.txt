the buyers including some of the world s biggest oil companies and traders such as bp royal dutch shell total vitol and gunvor are fiercely opposing the move according to trading sources
the is likely to force rosneft to soften its demands the sources said adding that the development shows the extent to which the oil giant is concerned about widening sanctions on russia
it is all very uncertain with the sanctions and rosneft is clearly worried and is trying to minimize possible risks said a trading source with a european major
we said no we couldn t accept this he added
rosneft did not immediately respond to a reuters request comment
bp and gunvor declined reuters requests for comment
shell total vitol did not respond to reuters inquiries
russia has been under and eu sanctions since when it invaded ukraine s crimean peninsula
the sanctions have been repeatedly widened to include new companies and sectors making it tough for russian oil firms to borrow money abroad raise new capital or develop arctic and unconventional deposits
president vladimir putin s administration has been hoping for a thaw in relations with the united states since president donald trump came to power but washington has imposed new sanctions instead including on some of russia s richest people
russian businesses are preparing for a new wave of sanctions expected in the coming days and months
the firms are trying to diversify away from dollar payments and tapping asia for more of their financing and technology needs
rosneft is run by a close ally of putin igor sechin
he and his company have been under sectoral sanctions since
rosneft has so far avoided being put on the special designated nationals sdn list which would make it impossible for major western companies to have dealings with it
when washington put russia s aluminum giant rusal on the sdn list earlier this year the move brought its metals exports to a near standstill and disrupted its access to raw materials from suppliers around the world
a rosneft tender document seen by reuters showed the company had asked its oil buyers to accept a new clause in its annual tender to sell oil products
no sanctions shall terminate or amend any obligations of the parties stated by the contract the document said
it also said that if a buyer walks away from the contract because of sanctions it must compensate rosneft with a payment that could either be a fixed amount or a sum calculated on the basis of the contract terms
currently rosneft has relatively mild sanction clauses which say that none of the parties has an obligation to abide by the contract if sanctions are imposed and no penalty is levied
rosneft is the world s largest listed oil firm with oil and gas output at around million barrels per day
it produces over percent of global oil on par with iran and counts all the global oil majors among its buyers
the buyers have insisted on sticking with the old clauses according to five trading sources
rosneft has so far said that it could not guarantee to consider buyers bids at tenders as valid unless they accept the new terms
rosneft will award its annual oil products supply tenders on according to the tender documents giving the companies more time to negotiate
