after oil imports from iran surge, india must now contemplate big cuts
india s oil imports from iran surge pct in most refiners purchases before new us sanctions india s waiver against us sanctions still carries restrictions already signs that indian demand is dropping off by nidhi verma new delhi nov reuters india s oil imports from iran in could be higher than the previous year despite the imposition of sanctions a reuters analysis of industry data shows forcing the government to rein in purchases in coming months
india s oil imports from iran jumped by about percent in from a year earlier totalling bpd or million tonnes tanker arrival data showed
the sharp increase was due to of purchases by indian refiners ahead of renewed sanctions on tehran which came into effect on monday
by choking iran s oil and shipping industries washington aims to try to force tehran to quash its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile programme as well as its support for militant proxies in the middle east
the united states granted exemptions to india china and six other countries allowing them to temporarily continue buying iranian oil but those waiver carry conditions
for india iran s no
oil customer the waiver allows refiners to buy only up to million tonnes a month or about bpd
that means india will have to slash its monthly purchases from iran by about half to comply with the waiver
analysts still expect that india s purchases of iranian crude in the full fiscal year ending in march will exceed the bpd or million tonnes that it imported in the previous year according to government data
but there have been some signs of a in demand
in october india imported about bpd of iranian oil according to preliminary tanker arrival data obtained from sources a decline of percent from september and marginally down from october last year
most india refiners boosted purchases from iran ahead of the sanctions as iran was offering almost free shipping and extended credit periods according to oil analysts
refiners also wanted to offset the impact of rising global oil prices and a weak indian rupee
indian refiners imported a lot from iran in the first half of the fiscal year mainly due to the discount offered by iran said sri paravaikkarasu head of east of suez oil for consultants fge in singapore
she said new delhi could even ask refiners to cut imports below the waiver level to curry favour with washington
last year india s imports fell as refiners had curtailed iranian oil purchases due to a dispute with tehran over development rights to a giant gas field
indian refiners that control about percent of the country s capacity had contracted to buy bpd of iranian oil in the current fiscal year
but with new sanctions in place they will now have to tell iran that they can not fulfil those agreements
