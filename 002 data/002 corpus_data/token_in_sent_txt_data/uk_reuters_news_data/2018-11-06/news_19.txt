tullow sees first kenyan crude shipments in first half 2019
tullow sees kenya crude shipments next year company s guyana drilling plans to mid by ed stoddard cape town nov reuters tullow oil expects the first crude shipments from its kenyan oilfields in the first half of and is pricing the product for the market the company s chief executive said on tuesday
paul mcdade also told reuters that tullow which has expanded beyond africa to the coast of guyana was bringing forward its drilling plans for the south american country and was looking to drill at least two wells there in the middle of
in kenya one of africa s newest oil plays where tullow is already trucking crude the next phase is getting ready to roll
we will have a shipment of kenyan crude ready to go probably in the first or second quarter of next year
we will market that and it allows the refiners to see the crude and try the crude so that helps the marketing process mcdade told reuters on the sidelines of the africa oil week conference
the price for crude from kenya and neighbouring uganda has not yet been fixed
the product is light crude but is waxy a drawback as it needs to be heated for transport to stay liquid
but its extremely low sulphur content is a plus
a percent sulphur limit will be imposed on marine fuels from by the international maritime organization down from percent to help protect the ocean environment
it is as close as you can get to zero sulphur which is quite unusual
that will give it a premium mcdade said
he would not be drawn on what he thought its price ultimately would be in relation to the brent benchmark
tullow also has a planned pipeline project in kenya and its ceo said tenders would go out for that probably in the first half of next year
some of the contractors tullow has spoken to have said they can get their own financing
that is a novelty it s not the conventional way to go mcdade said
meanwhile in guyana tullow has accelerated drilling plans in its concessions
we had originally thought we would drill some of those wells late next year but we have now accelerated and will probably drill at least two wells in our block around the middle of the year mcdade said
