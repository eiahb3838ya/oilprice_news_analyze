us allows williams more time to get okay for ny-penn. natgas pipeline
nov reuters energy regulators gave williams cos inc two more years until december to get the approvals needed to build its constitution natural gas pipeline from pennsylvania to new york according to a federal filing made available on tuesday
before it can start building the project williams still needs water quality certification
new york state denied the permit in saying the company failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the project would comply with state water standards
williams sued in federal court arguing that new york waived its authority to decide on the certification by failing to act within a reasonable period of time
the case went all the way to the supreme court which declined to review the appeals court judgment that upheld the state s decision
the company has filed a new federal lawsuit
this is the second extension for the pipeline which has been bogged down in regulatory and legal battles since ferc approved construction in december
the company and the utilities that sell gas to fuel power plants and heat homes favor the line which is opposed by environmental groups local landowners and new york governor andrew cuomo who argue that the state should rely more on energy efficiency and renewables
if built the pipeline would transport billion cubic feet per day bcfd of shale gas
when williams proposed constitution in it estimated the project would cost about million and enter service in
delays however have boosted that estimate to as high as million according to upstate new york newspapers
williams has said it would take about to months to build the pipeline after it receives the necessary approvals
constitution is owned by subsidiaries of williams cabot oil gas duke energy and altagas ltd
in addition to williams court appeal there is another possible path to get constitution built
some federal officials including energy secretary rick perry have said the federal government could overturn state decisions that block pipelines for national security reasons
president donald trump is unlikely to see much progress on his policy goals from a divided congress
we expect his administration will on regulatory issues like constitution to eke out wins ahead of his campaign analysts at height capital markets said in a note
