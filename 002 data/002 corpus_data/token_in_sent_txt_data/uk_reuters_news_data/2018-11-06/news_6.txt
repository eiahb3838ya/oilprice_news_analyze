exclusive-iraq to increase oil output and exports, waits on iran sanctions - minister
baghdad reuters iraq plans to increase its oil output and export capacity in with a focus on its southern oilfields and is close to reaching a deal with international companies oil minister thamer ghadhban said on tuesday
the new minister also said the shortfall in oil supply caused by new sanctions on iran had yet to be gauged before iraq and other opec members could decide what action to take ahead of their policy meeting next month
iraq opec s producer is targeting production capacity of million barrels per day bpd in with average exports expected to reach around million bpd
iraq currently pumps around million bpd second only to saudi arabia in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
the bulk of iraq s oil is exported via its southern terminals which account for more than percent of state revenue
upgrading capacity especially in the south is a top priority ghadhban told reuters in his first interview since taking over at the ministry last month
we have had talks with international companies which lasted for a while but now we are about to reach a deal and will settle this issue soon he said
in the coming years iraq plans to boost export capacity to million bpd after upgrading its infrastructure ghadhban said
this would include million bpd from southern oilfields with million bpd to become available after a new pipeline from the northern city of kirkuk to turkey s ceyhan port on the mediterranean is built
the country is trying to recover from years of violence including a war with islamic state militants that wrecked infrastructure
baghdad is also seeking to reduce corruption and manage rivalries with the kurdish authorities who run areas in the north
ghadhban who replaced jabar as minister is also looking to diversify iraq s export outlets through new pipelines
one of iraq s immediate challenges will be to gauge the shortfall in global oil supply caused by sanctions washington reimposed on iran s oil sector on monday
ghadhban said iraq wanted to see the actual decrease before baghdad and other opec members decide how to deal with a reduction in iranian shipments
what will be the physical increase in demand on iraqi oil if there s no demand how can i say we ll compensate ghadhban did not specify what oil price he expected for
he said a price above per barrel was fair and that the higher the price the better it was for iraq
i compare it with previous prices when we talk about prices above
i say it s a fair price it s not or and it s not
in principle the higher the price the better for iraq
but we re not working alone we re a member of opec
we see the interests of consumers and we want to be a viable producer and exporter ghadhban said
washington s sanctions target iran s oil banking and transport sectors and it has threatened more action to stop what it calls outlaw policies steps that tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy
a official confirmed iraq had been granted a waiver to import some iranian products
iraqi officials said last week baghdad would still be allowed to import crucial gas and energy supplies for its power stations as well as food items
in a tumultuous region iraq hopes to have more avenues for export
the oil ministry received bids from three foreign contractors to build a giant water treatment facility vital for the opec member to grow its oil production capacity ghadhban said
he said he expected work to begin in early and that the cost of the project was several billion dollars
an additional million bpd of export capacity would be added from a pipeline that eventually connects the southern city of basra with jordan s red sea port of aqaba he said adding that building new pipelines aims to diversify our export outlets
a final deal is expected to be reached with energy company bp to boost output from oilfields around kirkuk ghadhban said
i have met their representative bp yesterday and i hope very soon we reach an arrangement it s one of the priorities he said
