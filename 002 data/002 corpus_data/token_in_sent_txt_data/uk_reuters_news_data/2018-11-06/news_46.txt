adia, citi analysts see ample oil supply to withstand iran sanctions
abu dhabi reuters sanctions on iran are unlikely to impact the oil market due to a glut in supplies globally but iran s production capacity could be hit due to a possible squeeze in investments the head of research at abu dhabi investment authority adia said
big producers such as saudi arabia russia the united states and others have enough capacity to ensure global supply analysts at adia and citigroup said
you can t exclude spikes but basically there s too much oil in the world and that will prevail in the christof ruhl head of global research at adia said on the sidelines of a financial conference in abu dhabi
the system has already shown that there s ample surplus capacity in the world to more than meet the amount of oil taken out of iran for the time being said ed morse managing director global head of commodities research at citi
there is significant production coming out of the united states canada brazil and middle eastern countries he said
citi s outlook for prices is strong prices of a barrel through the winter and then with coming production brent will end at
the united states on monday restored sanctions targeting iran s oil banking and transport sectors and threatened more action to stop what washington called its outlaw policies steps tehran called economic warfare and vowed to defy
washington however gave exemptions to eight importers china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey
this group takes as much as of iran s seaborne oil exports trade data shows meaning iran will still be allowed to export some oil for now
iran s crude exports could fall to little more than million barrels per day bpd in november roughly a third of their peak
but traders and analysts say that figure could rise from december as importers use their waivers
when production declines it damages fields and capacity and that is more important in the medium to long term said ruhl
it is not going to help the sector it means pulling out investments it means financial isolation declining exports and revenues and potentially declining production he said adding that it depends on how stringently the sanctions are executed
iran s ability to store crude oil is crucial to keep production up rather than its ability to sell in the short term said ruhl
