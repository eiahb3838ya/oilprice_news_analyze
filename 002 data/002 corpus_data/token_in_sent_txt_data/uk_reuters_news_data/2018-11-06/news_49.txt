update 2-qatar's ruler hopes gulf crisis will end for sake of region
doha reuters qatar s ruler voiced hope on tuesday the country s bitter dispute with saudi arabia and its arab allies would pass saying it had harmed regional security by weakening a gulf arab bloc
saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain and egypt cut transport and trade ties with qatar in june accusing it of supporting terrorism and their foe iran
doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to undermine its sovereignty
history teaches us that crises pass but if they are handled badly then this may leave traces which last for a long time emir sheikh tamim bin hamad said in a speech to the country s consultative shoura council
it is very regrettable that the continuation of the gulf crisis exposed the failure of the gulf cooperation council gcc which has weakened its ability to face challenges and threats and marginalized its role in the region he said urging the bloc to adopt dispute resolution mechanisms
the united states an ally of the sunni muslim gcc sees the rift as a threat to efforts to contain shi ite iran and has pushed for a united gulf front
saudi arabia and the uae have repeatedly said the dispute is not a top priority and assured washington it will not affect defense cooperation
riyadh recently appeared to soften its tone on qatar as the kingdom faces its worst political crisis in decades over the murder of journalist jamal kashoggi at its consulate in istanbul which has strained saudi ties with the west
the emir said qatar s economy had emerged stronger from the sanctions and that the state continued to support vital projects including preparations to host the world cup in and to develop oil and gas industries to maintain its position as the world s largest liquefied natural gas exporter
doha has moved to attract investors and new trade partners as it builds an economy less reliant on its neighbors easing restrictions on foreign ownership of stocks and property
qatar grew its exports by percent last year and slashed spending by percent under a conservative fiscal policy while preserving the value of its currency the emir said forecasting the budgetary surplus would increase in coming years
he told the shoura council that doha would push ahead with economic diversification plans to ensure food and water security but continue to build on its already powerful energy sector
qatar s objectives in diversifying the economy and reducing its dependence on oil and gas does not ever mean neglecting the oil and gas sector as a fundamental source of wealth he said
