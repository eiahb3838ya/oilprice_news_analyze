we will absolutely not abide by such sanctions
we buy billion cubic metres of natural gas
we can not freeze our people in the nato member turkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighbouring iran has been one of its main suppliers of oil because of its proximity the quality of its crude and favourable price differentials
in an interview erdogan s spokesman ibrahim kalin mentioned a temporary waiver period of six months and said turkey would evaluate developments during this time when holding talks following the end of their exemption
we are not going to abandon our interests because the united states is imposing sanctions on this or that country for whatever reason kalin said
we will evaluate the period but we will not compromise our principles at the table he told broadcaster haberturk late on tuesday
