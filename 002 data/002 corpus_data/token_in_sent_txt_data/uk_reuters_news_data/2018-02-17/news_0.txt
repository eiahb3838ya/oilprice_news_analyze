update 3-three held as $1.8 bln fraud ripples through indian banks
new reuters india s federal police detained two employees of punjab national bank the lender that says it has been the victim of a billion fraud in the first arrests in a probe into the country s bank scam
gokulnath shetty and manoj kharat are suspected of steering fraudulent loans to companies linked to billionaire jeweler nirav modi and entities tied to jewelry retailer gitanjali which is led by modi s uncle mehul choksi
india s income tax department warned in an internal note seen by reuters that domestic banks could take a hit of more than billion from loans and corporate guarantees provided to modi and choksi
the arrests late on friday came two days after india s lender said it had been hit by massive fraud sending its share price tumbling
the accusations against the two relatively junior pnb officials were detailed in the lender s disclosure and also contained in a preliminary police report
the central bureau of investigation cbi also arrested a third person hemant bhat whom a source described as the authorized signatory of the companies tied to nirav modi
all three appeared before a hot packed courtroom in mumbai on saturday afternoon where they were ordered to remain under police custody until march to allow the cbi to continue its investigation
no charges have yet been laid
cbi must get fair chance to investigate this very serious offence which has consequences for the country s economy said judge s r tamboli as pnb employee shetty shifted nervously and blinked frequently
the other two stood passively
family members of the accused present at the court defended them saying they were innocent
kharat s uncle told reuters the pnb employee was just following orders of superiors and added he wasn t aware of what he is doing
a police source said six more pnb employees were being examined after the cbi conducted additional searches at the pnb s branch in southern mumbai where the alleged fraud took place
police sources say modi whose jewelry has been worn by hollywood stars including kate winslet and choksi left india last month and their whereabouts are unknown
neither modi nor choksi have so far commented on the allegations
gitanjali has previously denied choksi s involvement in the fraud and said he would take necessary legal action to get his name removed from the police case
tv station ndtv on friday reported modi was at a suite in a new york hotel citing household staff who answered the door
on saturday a police source said that the cbi had sent a notice through interpol in a bid to help locate modi
meanwhile the enforcement directorate india s financial crime agency said on saturday it conducted additional searches at locations of companies tied to modi seizing million rupees million in precious stones metals and jewelry
both authorities have conducted dozens of raids since pnb disclosed the fraud targeting pnb modi and choksi with the enforcement directorate now having seized diamonds gold and jewelry worth billion rupees
a tax department spokeswoman told reuters officials had seized properties and bank accounts linked to modi
the biggest bank fraud in india s history has sent rumbles through india s financial system raising fears about the scale of problems in the banking sector that is already saddled with billion of soured debt
pnb said on friday it was running an audit of its systems to prevent a recurrence of such a fraud but did not see a hit to its operations
the bank which has billion in total assets has lost more than a fifth of its market value since it disclosed the fraud
the hindu newspaper reported on saturday that the central vigilance commission which investigations corruption in the government has summoned senior officials of the reserve bank of india and the finance ministry to assess how all internal checks and balances failed to detect the fraud
pnb officials were also summoned the report said citing an official aware of the development
the rbi did not reply to an emailed request for comment
a finance ministry spokesman was not immediately reachable
scrutiny of banks technical systems will intensify even further after india s city union bank ltd on saturday said it had suffered three fraudulent remittances of nearly million that had been pushed through the swift financial platform
the case was reminiscent of the million cyber heist that hit bangladesh s central bank in
