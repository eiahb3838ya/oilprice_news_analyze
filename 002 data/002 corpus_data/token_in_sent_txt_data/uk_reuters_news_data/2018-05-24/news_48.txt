general electric's power unit fights for growth as wind, solar gain
new york reuters vistra energy corp and dominion energy inc which serve about million electricity customers in more than a dozen states both say they are done building natural power plants
instead they are building large solar plants which offer plentiful and inexpensive electricity
this bearish view of energy reflective of a growing acceptance by utilities of renewable power sources poses a hurdle to john flannery s plan to turn around general electric co s power unit
ge s chief executive spelled out the difficulty on wednesday
power profits will be flat this year after falling percent in he said and ge is planning that demand for natural gas power plants will be less than half what it forecast just over a year ago and will stay at that level through
new plant sales are going to be tough flannery said at an investor conference on wednesday
this is not going to be a quick fix but there is at the end of the day assets here with intrinsic economic value
we re going to make the most of what we have in the long run flannery and russell stokes the head of ge power have said demand for electricity and natural gas power generators will grow about percent a year in line with global forecasts as utilities make a gradual transition to renewable power
following a strategy he laid out in november flannery is cutting jobs and billion in costs at the unit
on wednesday he said ge has tripled some sales incentives in the power division and is competing aggressively for new contracts to maintain plants and to get the call when utilities need parts or repairs during an unexpected outage something of which ge had lost sight
but some analysts and investors are skeptical about the prospects of a business devoted to natural gas and coal power plants that are falling out of favor with utilities
the competition from solar and wind along with abundant gas produced by fracking is curbing orders for new plants and forcing the closure of old ones
some utilities are even filing for bankruptcy
that means companies are going to have trouble selling new plants said mark dyson a principal at the rocky mountain institute an organization that researches the power industry
over years ge has weathered ups and downs in power market before and has legions of sales and service people around the world
last year it booked orders for its newest gas turbines in mexico bangladesh and elsewhere
it is investing in its separate renewables unit focused on wind and hydro which saw revenue fall percent last year
ge also sells battery storage software and technology to work with wind and solar systems
ge power equipment orders an indicator of future sales fell percent in the first quarter accelerating from a percent drop last year according to ge s earnings reports
ge s performance reflects the broader trend of utilities shifting to renewables from fossil fuels
global sales of large natural gas power plants have fallen by half since according to mccoy power reports
coal and plants accounted for just percent of new electricity capacity financed globally last year down from percent a decade ago according to thomson reuters data
solar and wind now draw percent of such investment up from percent a reuters analysis shows
for a graphic click rivals siemens ag and mitsubishi heavy industries are cautious about the scope for growth
we see a structural change lisa davis the chief executive officer of siemens corp the unit said in an interview
there are fewer large units being sold globally than there were five years ago
i don t see that changing dramatically going siemens is cutting power and gas jobs to adjust
many utilities share the view that the shift is permanent because it is driven by economics rather than government policy and concerns
while conventional power plants will continue to be built sales may never reach the levels seen just two years ago industry experts said
with electricity prices trending downward utilities are increasingly unwilling to risk capital on a new plant unless then can lock in a price executives said
building new large gas plants is challenging without the stability of a power contract said timothy menzie chief executive officer of intergen an international power generation company
ge faces a further challenge erosion of the large base of plants it services
after acquiring the alstom power business in ge has a base of customers that produces of the world s electricity
contracts to service those plants bring ge billions of dollars in annual revenue
but as utilities close older coal and plants the revenue growth from services is under pressure
wind and solar can cost as little as a megawatt hour compared with for a large gas plant said mikael backman north america regional director at wartsila energy solutions part of the finnish company that makes natural generators
across much of the united states some utilities now buy all the cheap renewable power they can on electricity markets and use gas engines to fill in when wind and sun falter
in california regulators have put on hold a project that planned to buy one of ge s large turbines while southern california edison which planned to buy the power studies using wind and solar instead
the shift from fossil fuels stretches beyond states like california which is aggressively switching to renewable power
in texas wind and solar now provide percent of the state s electricity
utilities there are shutting down the equivalent of about coal plants this year according a reuters analysis of data from power system operator ercot
out of projects on the drawing boards only four would run on fossil fuels ercot said
the rest are wind and solar
exgen texas power an affiliate of exelon corp filed for bankruptcy protection in november for five plants the second such bankruptcy in texas last year attributed to low power prices
ge supplied parts and service to several of the plants according to the bankruptcy filings
reuters could not determine whether the contracts will remain in effect
in virginia dominion energy ended several maintenance contracts it had with ge this year when it mothballed a large plant built by companies ge later acquired and idled seven other coal and natural gas units in the state
dominion aims to build megawatts of solar by the equivalent of about five large power plants
it is opening a new plant in virginia this year built with ge and mitsubishi equipment
it said it has no current plans to build more such plants
solar is very cheap spokesman dan genest said
these units were just not cutting reporting by alwyn scott editing by joe white and edward tobin
