in full flow: pipeline additive sales boom amid oil bottlenecks
alberta reuters pipeline bottlenecks have vexed north american oil producers this year but for companies making a additive called agent dra they have provided a veritable windfall
dra is injected into pipelines to reduce the contact between the oil and the wall of the pipe allowing more crude to flow through
it is a tiny but booming business accounting for about million in global sales half of that in the united states but is growing about percent annually said brian watt senior vice president at specialty chemicals producer innospec inc based in englewood colorado
pipeline companies are increasing dra usage because of bottlenecks in the key north american producing regions of texas s permian basin and western canada
those crude grades have traded at discounts to benchmark futures this year because of inadequate pipeline space
planned pipelines in the permian will not largely start coming online until late this year while new canadian pipeline capacity faces scrutiny by politicians activists and regulators
anything that allows you to increase capacity or reduce the energy pumping those lines is going to look like a good investment watt said
adding dra which sells for to per gallon allows pipeline operators to reduce pump pressure
we re using a lot more dra in the system said guy jarvis executive of liquids at canada s biggest pipeline company enbridge inc because it can provide a bit of a boost to flow as well as reduce power bills
transcanada corp used dra to maintain flows on its keystone pipeline despite pressure restrictions after a leak late in november in south dakota industry sources told reuters
one month after the leak throughput on keystone was at barrels per day just percent below nameplate capacity despite the percent pressure restriction according to previously unreported data from the national energy board canada s energy regulator
in the first quarter of average flow was above capacity even though restrictions were not lifted until may
transcanada did not confirm the use of dra in the keystone line citing commercial sensitivity
dra has been around since the but pipeline operators kept its use quiet believing it gave them a competitive advantage
even now few companies disclose how much dra they produce
because the demand picture is shifting pretty rapidly matching up supply and demand is critical to maintaining a profitable business said greg jones head of downstream products at general electric unit baker hughes which is expanding output in oklahoma by an undisclosed amount
everybody s a bit cautious about not tipping their innospec said on monday that it is building a new dra production plant in texas while liquidpower specialty products inc a berkshire hathaway unit doubled manufacturing capacity late last year
private equity has also noticed
csl capital management funded optum energy solutions new dra plant in oklahoma
we saw an opportunity for steady and growing demand for dras for the next several years said csl founding partner charlie leykum noting it can help maintain volumes on aging pipelines where pressure has to be carefully managed
he declined to disclose the size of his firm s investment
recently companies have started including dra into pipeline designs to reduce capital costs by using smaller pipe said marina kaplan liquidpower s director of strategy marketing and business development
politically volatile regions also generate high demand as companies have to contend with damaged pipelines jones said
older lines in iran use dra to increase or maintain output said patrick bayat chief executive of dra producer partow ideh pars co in an email
nugentech chief executive donato polignone said the emeryville company sells dra to kuwait oil company
