update 4-higher pjm auction prices won't save some u.s. nuclear plants
recasts first paragraph adds details on size of auction by scott disavino new york may reuters nuclear power generators are sticking with plans to shut several reactors after none of them won the right to supply capacity in an auction by the country s largest power grid despite higher winning prices energy companies and analysts said on thursday
major nuclear power providers including exelon corp and firstenergy solutions bid in an annual auction held this month by grid operator pjm interconnection to make sure there is enough resources available for upcoming years
this year s auction which was awarded on wednesday came to billion for the june delivery year said pjm which controls the grid in and midwest states
last year s auction fetched billion
in recent years natural gas has become the nation s dominant provider of power generation with nuclear and coal slipping because of elevated costs for those fuels
nuclear and coal operators have said they want to see additional subsidies and market rule changes to allow them to keep operating as they provide what is known as generation power available around the clock
this auction involves bids for capacity pjm awards the capacity to the generators that can offer the lowest cost
this auction produced a price of per for much of the pjm footprint compared with last year
that figure was still too low for some of exelon and firstenergy s plants
those operators are looking to washington and individual states for relief to keep operating
exelon the biggest operator of nuclear power plants said after the auction that it still planned to shut its three mile island reactor in pennsylvania in october and the oyster creek plant in new jersey this october
oyster creek did not participate in the auction
firstenergy solutions a bankrupt unit of firstenergy corp said the auction had no impact on its operations
the company said in march it planned to retire the perry and nuclear plants in ohio and beaver valley in pennsylvania in and
one megawatt can power about homes
while the auction was tough on nuclear reactors it was a boon to energy companies that burn gas and coal to generate power like nrg energy inc and vistra energy corp which both saw their shares rise by nearly percent on thursday
exelon and firstenergy both said they will continue to work with federal and state officials and pjm on broader market reforms that could keep some reactors from shutting
now more than ever we need federal regional and state policymakers to urgently take action to preserve the benefits that our nation s largest and most resilient source of energy provides to our customers kathleen barrón exelon s senior vice president of government and regulatory affairs and public policy said in a statement
nuclear operators have complained that the way energy prices are set in pjm does not compensate them for their contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of carbon free energy
some states provide subsidies including new york and illinois and this week new jersey passed a bill that will compensate nuclear operators providing power to the state
resiliency became an issue after energy secretary rick perry in september asked federal energy regulators to adopt rules to protect fuel secure coal and nuclear plants from early retirement
we remain skeptical that federal or state subsidies are likely but we re more optimistic about reforms put forward by pjm said katie bays an energy analyst at height securities in washington
pjm is testing the resiliency of its grid and is also developing a plan that could change the way the market compensates generators for the energy they produce which could increase revenues for both coal and nuclear plants
of the nuclear reactors operating in the united states capable of generating about mw are in pjm
those units are capable of producing almost mw
