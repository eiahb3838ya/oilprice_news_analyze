european utility power struggle goes to the wire in brazil
may reuters a bitter feud over a brazilian power grid operator has taken a global rivalry to new levels as europe s top two utilities ready bids for eletropaulo
brazil s biggest power distributor became one of the world s most prized power assets last month when italy s enel and spain s iberdrola locked horns in a country both see as key to expansion virtually doubling its value overnight
although enel outdid iberdrola in an early skirmish with a reais per share bid for eletropaulo best offers are due on thursday in a complex bidding process with sources close to the auction saying there could be room to raise the bar
shares in eletropaulo which has a market value of billion reais billion stood at reais on thursday indicating the market expected higher offers
we are ready to keep on participating in the process but for strategic reasons i can t tell you to which point the chairman of iberdrola s brazil unit neoenergia mario jose said last week
earlier this month neoenergia agreed debt issuance of billion reais billion and got consent from its main shareholders to make new offers for eletropaulo
meanwhile enel which generates more than percent of its earnings in south america is said to have financial firepower of up to billion euros for acquisitions
but the price tag has left some investors concerned the utilities could be overpaying despite obvious synergies with their other businesses in latin america s most populous country
brazil s power company energisa sa dropped out of the race in may while sources said cpfl the brazilian power group owned by china state grid corp gave up to focus on other assets deeming the price too rich
the aggressive bidding surprised me
given their rivalry in spain it looks to me like this might have become a question of principle roberto lottici fund manager at ifigest and an enel shareholder said
the chilean minority shareholders of enel s americas unit have said they oppose the takeover and are not happy with the idea of enel americas financing the potential deal
enel which controls spanish utility endesa is competing with iberdrola in spain and latin america and recently another front opened in italy
the in brazil has frayed tempers further leading iberdrola to write to the european commission in april alleging enel was taking investment decisions it would not be able to do were it not
brazil is a strategic market for iberdrola
it helped drive a percent rise in core profits in the first quarter and will absorb a fifth of a billion euro investment plan to
buying eletropaulo would boost its client base in the country to more than million with km of grid
for enel a deal would nearly double its brazilian client base to million
europe s biggest utility which last year bought brazilian power distributor for million said in april it was keen to grow in the country
last week a source told reuters that enel would look at any assets of portugal s edp which is the subject of a bid by china three gorges after a breakup of the utility which has generation and distribution in brazil
bank of america merrill lynch said in a recent report that despite high multiples an eletropaulo deal could be percent accretive for enel by but percent for iberdrola due to the geographical proximity of assets
brazil is the third biggest electricity producer in the americas with strong growth potential and energy consumption is set to grow percent by the latest bp energy outlook report says
after years of and government interference brazil has taken steps to improve regulation and investor returns to attract utilities to help upgrade its infrastructure
a source with knowledge of the matter said the average duration of a blackout on the grid was minutes compared to minutes in italy
that s a lot of revenue that can be recouped just by streamlining the grid the source said
thursday is the last day for offers from enel and iberdrola ahead of registration on june
unless that is a new investor appears in which case everybody will be allowed to raise bids at a june auction
