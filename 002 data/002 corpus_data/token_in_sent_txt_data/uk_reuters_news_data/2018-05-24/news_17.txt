update 1-naftogaz says gazprom must be part of new russia-ukraine gas talks
changes dateline from kiev adds quote context brussels may reuters the head of ukraine s naftogaz said on thursday talks over future russian gas transit via the country to europe must include gazprom and must be based on firm commitments
commenting on an invitation from the bloc to relaunch trilateral gas talks naftogaz chief andriy kobolev voiced doubts over russia s willingness to engage in serious talks
he said russia s energy minister has agreed to the talks but not gazprom
for the success of the talks it is important to have gazprom in the room kobolev told reuters in brussels
i am struggling to understand what outcome we are trying to achieve because from what i know they are not ready to give any russian president vladimir putin said on friday that moscow was ready for talks with ukraine on continued gas transits after their contract expires in following talks with german chancellor angela merkel last week
russia s gazprom and five european companies with german backing plan to build the north stream gas pipeline on the baltic seabed to connect russia directly with germany
the pipeline bypassing eastern europe would allow gazprom to reduce gas flows through ukraine costing it valuable transit revenue
kobolev added that the eu s decision to settle its antitrust case with gazprom on thursday would not bring any positive market changes saying the commitments were too vague
it seems gazprom is getting away with everything he said
