saving the planet...one dumpling at a time
london may thomson reuters foundation canadian scientists have collaborated with hong kong climate campaigners to create dumplings in the hope of persuading the world s biggest carnivores to stop pigging out
china eats more meat than any other nation twice the amount consumed by americans alone and a campaigning hong kong business is launching a more sustainable diet that it says has less impact on global warming
but all of the taste
just to tell people what not to do is not going to solve the problem
you ve got to give them alternatives david yeung founder of green monday told the thomson reuters foundation
climate change water scarcity food insecurity these are mega giant problems
the easiest way to help the planet is to reduce meat consumption the business founder said
green monday was founded in as a social enterprise a business with a mission to benefit society as well as turn a profit
it will launch omnipork at its six green common foodstores all in hong kong at the beginning of june
it is the latest product aimed at carnivores open to ethical alternatives with less environmental fallout
scientists attribute nearly percent of global greenhouse gases to meat production
the industry is the largest driver of global environmental change due to feed production land use and methane emissions according to the food and agriculture organization fao
china consumes a lot more meat than any other country
people ate about million tonnes of pork beef and poultry in about twice as much as the united states according to government estimates
omnipork is the first food product from green monday which campaigns for people to ditch meat at least once a week
made of shiitake mushroom rice and pea protein the new food will initially only be available in prepared dishes such as dumplings and a traditional asian dish of dan dan noodles
as well as running grocery stores the social enterprise has an online directory of restaurants with vegetarian menus and has invested in beyond meat a firm that produces a burger made from plants
yeung said it took canadian food scientists about months to achieve the right texture moistness and taste that means the product is almost indistinguishable from real pork
nearly three quarters of consumers globally are limiting or avoiding meat altogether according to globaldata a data analysis company that surveyed nearly people in countries including china
the shift toward foods is being driven by millennials who are most likely to consider the food source animal welfare issues and environmental impacts fiona dyer a consumer analyst at globaldata said in a statement
