update 2-ukraine adds russian tycoons and news agency ria to sanctions list
kiev reuters ukraine has put russian businessman oleg deripaska whose company rusal owns a large alumina plant in the country and other prominent russians on an expanded sanctions list a document on the president s website showed on thursday
it was not clear what effect the blacklisting would have as many russian companies have already sought to wind up their activities due to earlier sanctions
but restrictions on deripaska could affect the operations of the mykolaiv plant in southern ukraine which is the alumina asset of his aluminium business rusal
the mykolaiv plant did not respond to a request for comment
kiev first implemented sanctions against hundreds of russian companies and entities after moscow s annexation of crimea in and over its support for a separatist uprising in eastern ukraine
earlier in may it expanded these restrictions to mirror those of the united states which blacklisted officials and businesspeople around president vladimir putin in april
this was one of washington s most aggressive moves to punish moscow for its alleged meddling in the election and other malign activity
ukraine s updated list was published online on thursday confirming sanctions on deripaska as well as on other russian tycoons such as viktor vekselberg owner of renova holding group and alexei miller the ceo of russia s gas exporter gazprom
the additions to the list also include the ukraine operations of russian state news agency ria novosti
it did not reply to a request for comment
on may ukrainian state security agents searched ria novosti s kiev office and detained its director accusing ria of being used in an information war by russia against ukraine
kiev says the kremlin uses an array of tactics to undermine and destabilise ukraine spreading propaganda while supporting the eastern separatists with troops and sophisticated weaponry and launching cyber attacks on ukrainian infrastructure
moscow denies the accusations
