update 4-iran complying with nuclear deal, but could do better -iaea
vienna reuters iran continues to comply with the terms of its nuclear deal with world powers despite the withdrawal but could be faster and more proactive in allowing snap inspections the atomic watchdog policing the accord said on thursday
in its first such report since president donald trump announced washington s pullout on may the international atomic energy agency said iran remained within limits on the level to which it can enrich uranium its stock of enriched uranium and other items
but the iaea seemed to rebuke iran for dragging its feet on complementary access inspections under the agency s additional protocol which iran is implementing under the deal
such inspections are often carried out at short notice
the agency has conducted complementary accesses under the additional protocol to all the sites and locations in iran which it needed to visit the iaea said in a confidential report that was sent to member states and obtained by reuters
timely and proactive cooperation by iran in providing such access would facilitate implementation of the additional protocol and enhance confidence it said
the report came with france britain and germany scrambling to salvage the deal s core bargain of sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on tehran s atomic activities
trump is reimposing sanctions against tehran threatening to scupper the deal and prompt iranian retaliation
the iaea has repeatedly defended the deal saying it created the world s most robust verification regime
speaking at a news conference with russian leader vladimir putin in saint petersburg french president emmanuel macron said the report went in the right direction and was comforting
diplomats who follow the agency said an inspection last month went down to the wire but a senior diplomat also familiar with the iaea s work said on thursday the report was not taking iran to task
there was no problem
it s just an encouragement
the iaea wants to make sure that there won t be any problem he said adding that there had been no change in iranian behaviour either over the first quarter of or since trump s announcement
trump sees various flaws in the deal including that many of its restrictions lapse over time and that it does not address iran s ballistic missile programme or its role in regional conflicts like the wars in syria and yemen
some western companies such as french oil giant total have already said they may have to quit iran because of the move
senior officials from the other countries that signed the deal france britain germany russia china and iran are meeting in vienna on friday to discuss next steps
at a meeting with the european union s foreign policy chief in brussels last week the french british and german foreign ministers pledged to preserve the deal by trying to keep iran s oil and investment flowing but acknowledged they would struggle to provide the guarantees tehran seeks
iran s supreme leader set out a series of conditions on wednesday for iran to stay in the deal including that european banks should safeguard trade with the islamic republic
