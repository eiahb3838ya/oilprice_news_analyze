update 1-french army chief: ready to strike syria if chemical weapons used
paris reuters france s top military official said on thursday his forces were prepared to carry out strikes on syrian targets if chemical weapons were used in an expected government offensive to retake the northern province of idlib
russia an ally of president bashar resumed air strikes against insurgents in idlib on tuesday after weeks of bombardment and shelling by syrian forces in an apparent prelude to a offensive against the last major enclave held be rebels
we are ready to strike if chemical weapons were used again armed forces chief francois lecointre told a small group of reporters
they can be carried out at national level but it s in our interest to do it with as many partners as in april france the united states and britain launched more than missiles at targets in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack
the prospect of an offensive on idlib alarms aid agencies
the united nations has said about half of the million people living in areas of the northwest have already been displaced
it estimates some jihadists are in the area
lecointre said he expected the final pockets of islamic state resistance in syria and iraq to be defeated by the end of november
idlib s fate now appears likely to rest on a summit on friday in tehran between the leaders of russia turkey and iran a meeting that russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said would make the situation clearer
while the united states and its allies have warned of a blood bath they have made clear they would only intervene should they deem that chemical weapons have been used
a french military source said the indications were that russia and its allies wanted to wrap up the idlib offensive by the end of the year
the source said paris believed the united states would maintain its military presence in northwestern regions of syria given that washington wanted to limit iran s influence in syria
