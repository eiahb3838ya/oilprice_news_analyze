worldâ€™s largest offshore wind farm opens off northwest england
london reuters the world s largest offshore wind farm will open on thursday off the northwest coast of england when danish energy group orsted unveils the walney extension project
the wind farm has a capacity of megawatts mw enough to power almost homes and overtakes the london array off england s east coast which has a capacity of mw
walney extension is made up of turbines built by siemens gamesa and mhi vestas and covers square kilometers square miles which is equivalent to around football pitches
the mhi vestas turbines being used stand meters yards tall and are the largest wind turbines in operation globally
graphic world largest wind turbine orsted said they have been optimized to generate as much as mw each
matthew wright orsted uk managing director told reuters in an interview britain s offshore success was due to a combination of strong wind speeds and shallow waters in the north sea and irish sea as well as continued support from the government
for the last years governments of all colors have supported renewable energy and offshore wind in the uk leading to a thriving industry he said
britain is the world s largest offshore wind market hosting percent of globally installed offshore wind capacity data from the global wind energy council showed
walney extension was among the first renewable projects to secure a contract for difference cfd subsidy from the british government in
the contract guarantees it a minimum price for electricity of pounds per megawatt hour mwh for years
since this was awarded the cost of offshore wind has fallen dramatically to a low of pounds per mwh in the last auction held in
blades for both sets of turbines were made at british factories in hull and the isle of wight and wright said the company was keen to use local facilities
approximately percent of the value of the project over its lifetime will have come from uk sources he said
walney extension is a project between orsted percent and two danish pension funds pfa and pka percent each
