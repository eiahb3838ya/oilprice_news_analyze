rpt-dirty secrets: tainted shipping fuel sparks calls for tighter quality control
repeats with no changes to text marine fuel sector is notoriously opaque tainted fuel can spread quickly is hard to trace source shippers preparing for shift to fuel in shipping network is backbone of global trade singapore shipping bunker volumes by roslan khasawneh singapore sept reuters a wave of contaminated fuel that has clogged and damaged engines on hundreds of oil tankers and container vessels in the past months has pushed shippers to demand stricter quality controls around the world
the calls are shining a light on the notoriously opaque shipping fuel sector where any contamination can spread quickly and be difficult to trace back to its source
that is because large volumes of fuel oil are blended with cutter stocks by suppliers and sold on through an extensive network of middlemen before finding their way into ships fuel tanks
this tide of dirty fuel comes when the shipping industry the backbone of global commerce with over percent of the world s traded goods transported on the oceans is bracing for an unprecedented shift to fuel from
we strongly believe that the marine fuel industry should get a grip on the situation and take on the responsibility it has in these matters said mads zacho chief executive officer at danish shipping company lauritzen
the contamination first emerged at the gulf coast as early as january this year but the exact suppliers and sources of the contaminants remain unknown
it then spread to places such as singapore the world s largest hub for marine fuel also known as bunker fuel and onto other ports in asia
when approached by reuters for comment on the tainted fuel the international bunker industry association ibia referred reuters to statement issued in in which it said it was not useful to seek to apportion fault when there is no agreement as to what the root cause is
the maritime and port authority of singapore and the port of houston authority did not immediately respond to requests for comment
more than ships call at singapore for refuelling each year with port authorities typically licensing bunker supplier operations
you have bunker ports where the contaminated fuel exists then it gets sliced and diced over different suppliers and different bunker barges then eventually it hits the ship operator said douglas raitt regional consultancy manager at ship classifier lloyd s register
he added that while it was difficult to give an exact number around to ships could have been affected globally which would dwarf previous such problems
the tainted fuel can harm engines in ways such as clogging pipelines or overwhelming fuel filters marine fuel surveyor and consulting firm maritec pte ltd has said
some damage can be repaired at sea but other cases have required vessels to return to port
a source with direct knowledge of the matter said that at least two oil tankers operated by oil giant bp had been hit by cases of contaminated fuel that cost big money and big delays
he declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media while bp did not respond to reuters request for comment
this lack of investigation into such a serious breach of safety norms is totally inadequate and hugely disappointing intertanko an association of independent tanker owners and operators with a combined fleet of almost ships said in a statement in august
it did not specify which authorities it thought should investigate the issue
while regulations governing marine fuel standards have been established by the international maritime organization imo the united nations shipping agency in practice few countries appear to be properly discharging these obligations said john bradshaw technical director at the international chamber of shipping which represents over percent of the world s merchant fleet
most countries take a position that it is a commercial matter between fuel suppliers and purchasers and that they have no obligation in ensuring the quality of fuel oil supplied to ships in areas under their jurisdiction said bradshaw
fuel standards in other mass transport sectors including aviation tend to be strictly enforced as problems there could lead to fatal accidents
the marine fuel industry has had its fair share of scandals including and illegal of fuel through what the industry calls the cappuccino effect where sticky fuel oil is frothed to inflate its apparent volume to buyers
the ibia said that a common but speculative view was that the current wave of contagion likely came from inappropriate cutter stocks used in the production of bunkers at one or more refineries terminals
the industry uses cutter stocks to help meet marine fuel grade specifications
in similar cases in the past the source of the contaminant was never adequately identified but the root cause was by and large a lack of control of the quality of cutter stock used in the marine pool the ibia said
meanwhile the imo will from force shippers to use fuels with percent sulphur content by mass down from percent currently
problems with contaminated fuels might become an even bigger problem in because you have to think about the fact that percent mass sulphur fuel requires a lot more blending than percent mass sulphur fuel said raitt at lloyd s register
intertanko said that if the fuel delivered to ships continued to lack quality controls that could also undermine a safe and smooth enforcement of the rules
if those responsible for providing good lasting quality fuels show the same lack of interest as shown so far in addressing and solving the root causes of current contamination problems the landscape only looks more troublesome for ship owners said dragos rauta technical director at intertanko
