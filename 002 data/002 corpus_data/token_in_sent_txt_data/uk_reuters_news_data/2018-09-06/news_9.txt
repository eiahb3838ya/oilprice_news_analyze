update 1-japan nuclear plant's power restored after quake triggers hokkaido blackout
mag quake hit northern hokkaido island early on thursday fuel rods cooled using diesel generators fukushima disaster came after tsunami knocked out power restoring full power to island may take a week minister recasts throughout adds comment by osamu tsukimori and aaron sheldrick tokyo sept reuters power was restored to a nuclear energy plant in hokkaido northern japan on thursday after a strong earthquake left it relying on emergency generators for nervous hours but it may be a week before lights are back on all over the major island
triggering a blackout just after local time the magnitude quake left at least seven people dead more than injured and dozens missing on hokkaido an island of about million people whose capital is sapporo
a major power station was also damaged in the temblor that shut down the grid
the situation at utility hokkaido electric power s tomari nuclear plant provided an uncomfortable if comparatively brief echo of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in
reactors there melted down after a massive tsunami knocked out generators designed to maintain power to cool reactors in emergencies
though tomari was shut down after the fukushima disaster in it needs electricity to keep fuel rods cool and had to rely on diesel generators that kicked in after the quake until power was restored to all three reactors by local time
hokkaido electric is now scrambling to get power restored to households factories and other customers even as rescuers bring in heavy machinery and digging equipment to search for survivors that may be trapped in stricken buildings
in another echo of the disaster hokkaido s situation was compounded by difficulties in receiving supplies from neighbouring regions that remain dominated by separate utilities with their own grids
a hokkaido electric spokesman said the utility was not receiving any supplies from the island of honshu to the south home to tokyo osaka and nagoya despite there being a megawatt connection for transferring power from the coast of japan s main island
nationwide they have been trying to bolster power systems by linking these fairly balkanized domains but it s not as easy as it sounds said andrew dewit professor of energy policy at rikkyo university in tokyo
it requires equipment like transformers that is quite expensive and damage to transmission lines transformers and other equipment from the quake is likely also delaying the restoration of power dewit said
by early afternoon hokkaido electric had restarted one megawatt unit at its sunagawa station
its coal station which normally supplies about half the island s electricity remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake
the abrupt halt in supplies from caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on hokkaido had to be shut own industry minister hiroshige seko told reporters in tokyo
it may take a week to restore power fully to hokkaido he said
thursday s blackout prompted the shutdown of hokkaido s new chitose airport a popular gateway to the most northern of japan s main islands the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation s
a number of industrial plants and factories were also affected
a fire that broke out at a steel production facility at mitsubishi steel manufacturing s joint venture with nippon steel sumitomo metal corp in muroran hokkaido was extinguished with little damage to the facilities a company official said
the plant will work towards resuming special steel production after power supply from hokkaido electric is restored the official said
it usually takes about eight hours to resume production after the power supply has been secured he said
meanwhile idemitsu kosan japan s refiner by sales stopped all refining and product shipments at its barrels per day hokkaido refinery the only one on the island an official told reuters
kirin beer part of giant drinks maker kirin holdings co said it closed its chitose plant which accounts for about percent of its beer output because of the power outage
there was no structural damage to the factory it said
sapporo holdings ltd said it closed down its hokkaido brewery because of the lack of power
