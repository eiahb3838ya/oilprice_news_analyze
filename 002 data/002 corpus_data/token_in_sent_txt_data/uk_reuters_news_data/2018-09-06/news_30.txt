under the sea: antiquities make way for israel's leviathan pipeline
dor beach israel reuters underwater archaeologists have been scouring the seabed where a gas pipeline is being built off israel s coast in a bid to preserve relics near a port which once was a key trade hub for the mediterranean s ancient civilisations
the pipeline from the leviathan gas field that is due to begin production late next year comes ashore near dor beach in northern israel a popular spot among israeli sunbathers
it is also the site of the ancient port of dor where hidden in the seabed lie the vestiges of marine traders throughout the ages from the phoenicians to the romans
to minimise damage to such relics the israel antiquities authority has been working over the past year with the leviathan field s operator noble energy
a team spent weeks scuba diving in the warm crystal clear water off the beach dispersing silt to uncover ancient artefacts
a robot was used for searches in deeper water
they found earthenware jugs anchors and the remains of wrecked ships setting new guidelines for similar future projects
there has been unprecedented cooperation to protect the antiquities and the cultural assets yaakov sharvit director of the marine archaeology unit of the israel antiquities authority told reuters tv
sharvit said noble financed most of the archaeological surveys and a large research ship to help extract ancient objects along the pipeline s route
the pipeline is being buried meters below the seabed to minimise any impact on the surroundings
leviathan was discovered in about km miles off israel s coast
its development will be the largest energy project in israel s history
what is unique here in israel is the ancient place that we re operating said binyamin zomer vice president for regional affairs for noble energy
we work very closely with the antiquities authority here in israel to make sure that should we discover such finds we first of all avoid causing harm to those areas and secondly to make sure that they are aware of the resources and potential finds that they his company says the project will not harm the environment and will replace less healthy fossil fuels
but some local environmentalists and residents oppose the plan which along with the pipeline includes a towering production platform to be built just km from shore
local resident and marine archaeologist kurt raveh who has been excavating at dor for decades and founded its diving club thinks the survey being done is insufficient
he worries the area is at risk from potential pipeline leaks
we have so many treasures and old shipwrecks and things like that we should get them out of the water before we can t enter the water anymore he said
