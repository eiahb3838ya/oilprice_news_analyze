column-india boosts purchases of indonesian coal as prices drop: russell
launceston australia reuters one of the standout commodity performers this year has been thermal coal but not all coal is created equal and disparities in pricing may help explain why india s imports have stayed strong despite the higher costs
the main benchmark for thermal coal in asia is priced at australia s newcastle port the world s largest harbour
the price has gained percent so far this year to close at a tonne in the week to according to assessments by argus media
this isn t far off the year high of nearly a tonne hit in july with the price surge this year largely coming on the back of increased chinese demand for coal to be burned in power stations
what has been somewhat surprising is that india the world s coal importer behind china has defied its prior history of being a buyer and boosted its imports this year
but delving into the detail offers an explanation as to why this is the case the price of the bulk of the coal india imports has been declining especially in recent months
india imported million tonnes of coal in the first eight months of the year up percent on the same period last year according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters
of this million tonnes came from indonesia making the southeast asian nation india s top supplier
india tends to import lower quality coal from indonesia with a typical grade being fuel with an energy rating of kilocalories per kilogram
the price for this type of coal as assessed by argus media has been declining since late june dropping to a tonne in the week ended
it has fallen percent since june and is now down percent so far this year
the gap between newcastle coal with an energy content of and indonesian is now at its widest since early
this appears to have shored up indian buying of indonesian coal with imports rising in august to million tonnes up from million in july according to the data
given the recent difficulties coal india has experienced in meeting domestic requirements it s little surprise that indian buyers have ramped up purchases from indonesia
it s also worth noting that india hasn t increased the amount of coal it buys from other top suppliers
australia is india s supplier but it ships almost exclusively coking coal used in steelmaking and is thus not a competitor with indonesia
however south africa exports thermal coal which is similar in quality and pricing to australia s newcastle benchmark
india imported million tonnes from south africa in august down from million in july perhaps indicating less of an appetite for the more expensive but higher quality fuel
one question that remains to be answered is why is the price of indonesian coal falling while higher grades are still either rising or staying close to highs
while it s too early to provide a definitive answer it appears that china may be buying less indonesian coal with imports dropping to million tonnes in august from million tonnes in both july and june according to data
china has also struggled with domestic coal availability mainly as a result of output restrictions as part of efforts to combat air pollution
this has boosted demand for imports but it seems chinese buyers are preferring higher energy content australian coal over indonesian grades
much of the coal china buys from indonesia is used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies in a compromise that sees a drop in overall energy content but also a drop in sulphur and ash given indonesian coal is low in these pollutants
