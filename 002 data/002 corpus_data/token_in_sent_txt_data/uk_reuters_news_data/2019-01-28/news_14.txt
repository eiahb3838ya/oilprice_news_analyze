updates with background on citgo venezuela by corina pons and marianna parraga city jan reuters venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido s team of advisers is rushing to take control of the country s main foreign asset refiner citgo petroleum before a potential bond default that could leave half the company in creditors hands sources close to the talks told reuters on monday
guaido who proclaimed himself president last week and has not yet appointed a cabinet faces the intricate legal challenge of nominating new leadership for pdvsa the oil and natural gas company and its subsidiaries including citgo who would manage the companies during a transition
other ideas are also in discussion to gain control of the firms
guaido who runs the congress assumed venezuela s presidency after president nicolas maduro was last year in a voting widely considered a sham
the united states and numerous nations in the hemisphere recognized guaido as the president but maduro still controls the military and pdvsa
holders of venezuela s most watched pdvsa bonds which mature in are due a million interest payment in late april
those bonds are collateralized with percent of citgo holdings equity meaning in the absence of a payment creditors could seize control of the company
without sources of revenue and control of foreign assets guaido s team faces long odds in succeeding despite massive protests against maduro s regime due to an economic crisis that has caused millions to flee the country
many people are starving while inflation has skyrocketed and left basic goods unaffordable
the united states imposed sanctions on venezuela in that have prevented citgo from repatriating dividends to its parent company
it had about million in cash at the end of september according to a creditor who spoke to reuters last week and million in available credit
citgo separately faces a july deadline to refinance its revolving credit a task that is facing delays due to sanctions affecting the subsidiary s ability to access to credit
