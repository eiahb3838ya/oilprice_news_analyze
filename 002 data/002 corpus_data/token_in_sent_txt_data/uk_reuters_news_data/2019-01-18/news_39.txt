u.s crude gains, slowing global economy challenge oil market in 2019 - iea
london reuters oil production growth combined with a slowing global economy will put oil prices under downward pressure in challenging opec s resolve to support the market with output cuts the international energy agency said on friday
the iea which coordinates the energy policies of industrial nations said it was keeping its estimate of oil demand growth for this year unchanged at million barrels per day close to levels
the impact of higher oil prices in is fading which will help offset lower economic growth the iea said in its monthly report
oil rallied above per barrel in the second half of on concern about lower supplies from iran due to new sanctions
but crude fell towards at the end of due to an economic slowdown and rising supply prompting producer group opec to cut output in an effort to keep prices above
the iea said global oil supply last month fell by bpd roughly percent led by lower opec output even before the organization s new pact took effect in january
the iea said production growth was set to slow to million bpd in after record annual gains of million bpd in
however the united states will continue to surprise on the upside
the united states already the biggest liquids supplier will reinforce its leadership as the world s number one crude producer
by the middle of the year crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either saudi arabia or russia the iea said
