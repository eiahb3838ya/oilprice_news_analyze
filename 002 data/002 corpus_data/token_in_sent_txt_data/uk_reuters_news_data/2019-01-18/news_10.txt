update 4-brazil shifting to self-monitoring of food, meat plants -minister
adds abpa comment in paragraph by jake spring and anthony boadle brasília jan reuters brazil is moving toward a system for food processors agriculture minister tereza cristina dias said on friday including meatpackers still recovering from an inspection scandal that hurt trade with key markets
dias said in an interview that the south american nation s new government plans to send draft legislation on to congress in the first half of this year
widely used in the united states and other developed countries in europe would be introduced gradually across various agricultural products and eventually be used for oversight of meatpackers
why can t brazil do when europe and the united states use it dias told reuters
commercial partners banned certain brazilian meat producers after a federal probe revealed alleged bribery and falsified inspection results in the country s meat exporting industry the world s largest
the scandal briefly threatened about billion in exports from brazil s powerhouse protein industry as markets from china to europe curtailed shipments of meat pending a review of the south american nation s inspection protocols
but dias a farm lobby congresswoman who was picked to head the agriculture ministry by new president jair bolsonaro adamantly defended the food industry s ability to monitor itself
our agriculture sector can provide guarantees
just because of one episode we shouldn t demonize brazil s food industry she said
dias argued that brazilian multinational companies already use at subsidiaries abroad
brazil is home to meatpacking giants jbs sa and brf sa both of which were implicated in the ongoing food probes
the federal investigation which started in and was expanded last year is examining relations between food processors agriculture ministry officials and laboratories with a mandate to certify the safety of meat sold domestically and in foreign markets such as china japan the middle east and europe
jbs and brf declined to comment on the introduction of a system
meat industry lobby group abpa said it supports initiatives to strengthen quality controls without elaborating
dias said she could not give specifics on what oversight would remain in the hands of the government since the matter was still under discussion with companies
dias said she has not begun talks with the european union over lifting its ban on brazilian chicken imports as the bolsonaro government which took office on was still formulating its policies
the agriculture minister said she may travel to china in february or march but no date for the trip has been set
beijing has imposed measures on brazilian chicken products which brasília is trying to get lifted
brazil s farm sector is also concerned that bolsonaro s plan to move the country s israeli embassy to jerusalem could hurt halal meat sales to muslim countries dias said
exports of halal food including beef chicken honey and cheese rose to an estimated billion last year
of course the agricultural sector that i represent is worried she said when asked about possible repercussions for trade with arab countries angered by the foreign policy shift by brazil which has traditionally backed a solution to the conflict
she said the policy is still being ironed out within brazil s government and talks are being held with trading partners
we have to find a middle ground going forward because brazil can not lose markets
what we need is to open new markets dias said
