oil refining capacity to grow at record pace this year - iea
london jan reuters global oil refining capacity is set to increase at its fastest pace on record this year possibly boosting stocks of products such as diesel gasoline and marine fuel the international energy agency said on friday
oil refining capacity will rise by million barrels per day bpd and demand for refined products by around million bpd the iea said in a monthly report
it was not clear yet what that meant for margins which slumped as the price of crude rose last year said the iea which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised countries
this demand growth utilises only half of the new capacity coming on stream
if refining margins are supported by accommodating crude prices utilisation rates will not decline
this should mean that product stocks will increase it said
an increase in stocks of refined products could be useful the iea said ahead of the implementation next year of regulations by the international maritime organization to reduce sulphur content in shipping fuel
margins remain under pressure from rising oil throughput which hit a historic high last month at million bpd
refineries will process million bpd this year compared with million bpd last year according to the agency
the global refining industry is facing a challenging
if average crude prices continue moving higher for the third consecutive year refining margins may decline to levels that force slowdown in some refining regions the iea said
