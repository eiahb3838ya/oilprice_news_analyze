brazil ag minister wants to open indigenous land to commercial farming
brasilia reuters brazil should open indigenous land to commercial farming agriculture minister tereza cristina dias said on friday while also seeking to soften many of president jair bolsonaro s controversial stances on native people and the environment
farmers form a key base of support for firebrand bolsonaro who since taking office has placed policies at the center of his agenda
activists warn his government s positions would strip away protections for the environment the amazon rainforest and indigenous peoples
reservation land covering roughly percent of brazil s territory is currently off limits for commercial farming
they could plant there and maybe have income for their community dias told reporters
they can not do this today
that needs to be changed in reservations should still be required to preserve a minimum percentage of native vegetation as all farmers currently are she said
bolsonaro has given control over indigenous land designations to the agriculture ministry after arguing on the campaign trail that no new indigenous reservations should be created
but dias struck a more moderate tone saying bolsonaro did not favor new reservations in areas that have long been settled by farmers
small farmers that have been there years and have deeds issued by the state or federal government if you kick them out there aren t conditions there for indigenous people to hunt and fish and have their lives she said in a press briefing
when the president says he doesn t want more demarcations he s talking about this type of contested but the amazon deserves completely different treatment and tribes with little contact with the outside world should be protected she said a position that is shared by brazil s new rights minister who will be responsible for indigenous affairs
bolsonaro has suggested brazil may exit the paris agreement on climate change and appointed a foreign minister who calls global warming a leftist fabrication
but dias said she is fine with staying in the accord as the country is on track to meet its climate change goals
as for a campaign promise to end the industry of environmental fines dias told reuters prior to the briefing that brazil must end indiscriminate fines levied by multiple agencies without working with the farmers to resolve misunderstandings
