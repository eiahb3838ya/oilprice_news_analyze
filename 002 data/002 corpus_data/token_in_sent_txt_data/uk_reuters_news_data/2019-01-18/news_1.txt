madrid jan thomson reuters foundation spain s prime minister vowed on friday to make up for a decade of inaction on climate change brought on by a harsh economic recession during which he said the country lost its passion and creativity to tackle the issue
socialist leader pedro sanchez who came into power in june said the transition spain is now aiming for must be socially just and not leave anyone behind including coal miners set to lose their jobs in the shift from fossil fuels
spain is ready to contribute to creating a global economy that is prosperous fair and ecological sanchez told a discussion on boosting climate ambition in madrid
a new national plan for energy and climate expected to mobilise investments of billion euros billion from will soon be submitted to the european union he said
officials said the socialist government also plans to present a new climate change law to parliament by the end of this month
a draft published last november included targets for the southern european nation to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least percent below levels by and to produce all of its electricity from renewable sources by the same date
sanchez noted that legislation on climate change was often unpopular with the general public
it could usher in tough adaptation in the but the aim was to avoid damage and governments should ask citizens to understand and support this he added
communicating the need for urgent action on climate change was a key motivation for two days of debate on sustainable development and climate change organised by spain s ministry for ecological transition
speakers included top global experts such as climate chief patricia espinosa economists nicholas stern and jeffrey sachs and former new zealand prime minister helen clark
clark who headed the united nations development programme from said spain could play a key role in an alliance of governments that get it on climate change alongside others such as sweden canada and her own country
we need political will and leadership she said
teresa ribera spain s minister for ecological transition emphasised the importance of international solidarity in fighting climate change
at climate talks in poland in december governments understood it was worthwhile continuing to work together despite efforts by a few such as the united states to break the united front shown in the paris agreement she said
the s espinosa said success at those negotiations on agreeing the rules for putting the paris accord into practice showed multilateralism is still in force
we can only tackle global problems through cooperation and joint work she added
in an interview with the thomson reuters foundation she said she hoped a climate summit called by the for september would spur countries to raise their targets for cutting emissions so as to meet the paris pact goal of limiting warming to well below degrees celsius
under the accord governments have committed to strengthen their national climate plans by
espinosa said some could come forward with those plans as soon as the september summit inspiring others to follow
stern warned that if global temperatures rise degrees c above times as they are now on track to do it would bring mass migration conflict destruction and decline
but moving to adopt clean energy and reduce carbon emissions would create jobs in renewable power generation and other sectors and result in cities where we can move and breathe
it is crystal clear that this transition to the economy is the growth story of this century he said
