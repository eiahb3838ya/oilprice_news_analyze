exclusive-canadian oil firm meg says husky balked at friendly takeover talks
winnipeg manitoba reuters canadian oil producer meg energy corp s ceo invited his husky energy inc counterpart this month to negotiate a friendly takeover of meg but husky did not follow up meg s vice president of investor relations john rogers said on friday
husky abandoned its hostile bid for meg on thursday saying it could not win sufficient meg shareholder support after alberta s government ordered production cuts to reduce a crude glut
meg s chief executive officer derek evans phoned husky ceo rob peabody in early january and invited him to visit and discuss a possible friendly deal to sell meg rogers said
we approached them and said you know with a little bit of negotiation i m sure we can find a way out of this rogers said recalling meg s invitation
they never got back to husky spokesman mel duvall said its offer expired without the minimum tender condition being met
meg produced an estimated barrels of oil per day in according to gmp first energy equal to about percent of husky s production
the company whose investors include chinese oil producer cnooc ltd is the largest canadian heavy oil producer
publicly husky whose majority investor is hong kong tycoon li continued to urge meg shareholders to tender to its offer leading up to its expiry this past wednesday
husky was expected to secure over percent support from meg shareholders sources told reuters and other media outlets on wednesday
it was expected to consider extending its offer to win the required
but husky allowed the offer to expire citing alberta s curtailment orders and a lack of progress expanding pipelines as recent negative developments
it has not said publicly how much support it received
the company s decision to abandon its bid may dent its credibility rbc analyst greg pardy said in a note
meg had invited husky in november to sign a confidentiality agreement and enter its data room rogers said
husky did not take meg up on it although several other companies did he said
no rival bids were made
meg s spurned invitations suggest that husky s commitment to the deal may have wavered after conditions in canada s oil patch deteriorated
discounts on canadian oil hit levels in october leading the alberta government to order the curtailments which husky has criticized
rogers said he did not believe meg was in play any longer despite a percent selloff of its stock on thursday that could make the heavy oil producer a bargain buy
