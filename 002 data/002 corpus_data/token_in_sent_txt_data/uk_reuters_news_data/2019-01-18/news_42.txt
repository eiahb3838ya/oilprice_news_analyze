focus-after billion-barrel bonanza, bp goes global with seismic tech
london reuters buoyed by the success of seismic imaging that found an extra billion barrels of oil in the gulf of mexico bp is looking to take its latest technology to angola and brazil
the software used in the gulf based on an algorithm created by xukai shen a geophysicist straight out of stanford university led to bp discovering the crude in an area where it had long thought there was none to be found
industry experts said the scale of the discovery km below bp s thunder horse field announced last week marked a major leap forward for deepwater exploration a costly business known for its low success rate and high risk
it is an example of how technology is helping deepwater make a comeback after a decade when the industry has focused on advances in onshore shale
the new deposit was found with software known as full waveform inversion fwi which is run on a and analyses reverberations of seismic soundwaves to produce images of ancient layers of rock thousands of metres under the sea bed helping geologists locate oil and gas
it is more accurate than previous surveying methods bp said and processes data in a matter of days compared with months or years previously
while the discovery marked the biggest industry success for digital seismic imaging the british oil major s rivals are hot on its heel with similar techniques
bp scientist john etgen the company s top adviser on seismic imaging said it aimed to retain its edge with a new machine it has developed wolfspar to be used alongside fwi
the wolfspar is dragged by a ship through the ocean and emits very low frequency soundwaves which are particularly effective for penetrating thick salt layers that lie above rocks containing fossil fuels he added
etgen told reuters that bp planned to roll out wolfspar alongside fwi in the second half of this year at the atlantis field in the gulf of mexico where a large salt layer still hides parts of the site
the company plans to expand the use of the technology to other big oil and gas basins including brazil next year and angola at a later stage he said
seeing through very complex very distorted salt bodies was the hardest problem we had the most challenging the scientist said in an interview
in both brazil and angola oil deposits are locked under thick salt layers
brazil s deepwater oil fields comprise one of the world s basins in terms of production
bp last year signed a partnership with brazil s national oil company petrobras to develop resources there
oil finds are rare particularly in mature basins like the gulf of mexico
but the scale of output from deepwater wells means they can compete with the most basins in the world in particular shale
bp is far from alone in focusing on technology all big oil companies have put a growing emphasis on digitalisation to reduce costs following the oil price collapse of
in fact bp s spend on r d was the third lowest among the world s top publicly traded oil companies in at million compared with exxon mobil s billion and royal dutch shell s and total s budgets of over million
other majors have also made advances
italy s eni has launched the world s most powerful industrial computer to process seismic data for example while france s total is using drones to carry out seismic mapping in dense forests such as in papua new guinea
however barclays analysts said in a report last year that bp and norway s equinor had the most advanced deployment of technology among oil majors
the seismic breakthrough for bp came when xukai shen tested a new idea he had for the fwi algorithm in
what happened was magic the pieces came together recalled etgen
we finally had the right algorithm with the right data set to create the model of the salt formation and use the model to remove bp says its new seismic technology could save it hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration hours by pinpointing the location of the most promising deposits
it allows us to drill the right wells drill wells at lower costs drill wells in the best part of the reservoir drill fewer wells etgen said
the costs of the technology are a fraction of bp s oil and gas production budget of around billion per year
an fwi survey costs up to million to carry out while processing the data costs up to million etgen told reuters
the annual spend on the that runs the software is about million
the companies that are investing in technology are coming through and winning the race henry morris technical director at independent north explorer azinor catalyst
that s where bp are doing a good job
it s seeing through salt layers with confidence adds real value and saves companies the premiums they must pay to acquire resources through acquisitions according to bernstein analysts
with computing the seismic processing and interpretations are being done in two weeks rather than years as it would have been if they still used century computers they said
investors should therefore expect more from bp with this additional reporting by shadia nasralla editing by pravin char
