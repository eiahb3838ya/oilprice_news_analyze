germany's 2019 hard coal imports seen rising after mining ends
for vdki data on seaborne coal trade click imports expected to gain percent this year forecast rise would follow percent fall in politicians seek of coal by vera eckert frankfurt jan reuters germany is expected to import million tonnes of hard coal this year up roughly percent from despite mounting competition from renewable energy as the closure of domestic mines reduces domestic supply importers said on friday
the total would comprise an estimated million tonnes for power generation and million tonnes of coking coal and coke products used in steelmaking data from lobby group vdki showed
germany s last two mines in the west of the country closed at the end of december under a deal to stop unprofitable mining in favour of imports
the pair had contributed an annual million tonnes of power station feedstock
the coal importer lobby said hard coal usage would benefit from a court ban on logging in an ancient forest a move that will impede the mining of domestic rival lignite or brown coal by utility rwe
the court ruling curbs supply to rwe s power plants and hard coal could cover part of the deficit
the two types of coal accounted for a combined percent of german power production last year
despite the forecast rise there could be import losses in as a result of a national plan due within the next fortnight on phasing out coal vdki said
the projected increase would also be from a weaker base
volumes in declined by percent to million tonnes as renewable energy gets priority on grids elbowing out thermal plants output
steam coal imports for power stations alone fell percent to million tonnes
green power made up percent of total generation in resulting from germany s politically driven process to replace fossil fuels
vdki estimated the addition of green power plants lost it million tonnes of imports last year while relatively high solar production in a hot year also played a part
just like was a very bad year for hard coal in germany vdki chairman wolfgang cieslik said during the presentation of the data in hamburg
vdki managing director wodopia said steelmaking usage of coal could benefit from higher demand projections by the world steel association for but cautioned that the macroeconomic environment had recently worsened
we cautiously expect the same level of imports as in he said of coking coal
