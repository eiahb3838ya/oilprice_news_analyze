wrapup 4-u.s. seeks to cut off money for venezuela's maduro to aid opposition
reuters the united states is seeking to ensure that venezuelan oil revenue goes to opposition leader and interim president juan guaido and to cut off money from isolated president nicolas maduro a top official said on thursday
although short on details the announcement signals that washington is willing to go beyond traditional diplomatic measures and will seek to drain cash from maduro s government which is already struggling under an unprecedented economic meltdown
such a move would significantly strengthen the hand of guaido who swore himself in as interim head of state on wednesday with the support of washington and nations around the region
what we re focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate maduro regime from the sources of his revenues national security advisor john bolton told reporters at the white house
we think consistent with our recognition of juan guaido as the constitutional interim president of venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate bolton added that the process was very complicated and that officials were still studying how this would function
venezuela s information ministry did not reply to a request for comment
guaido in an interview with broadcaster univision said he believed this was the beginning of the end for maduro and he would work to guarantee humanitarian aid and implement new economic measures to rachet up pressure
our challenge is to secure free elections and we want them as soon as possible
but we are living in a dictatorship he said from an undisclosed location
washington s support for guaido prompted maduro venezuela s leader since to break relations with the united states
on thursday he said he was closing venezuela s embassy in washington and its consulates in the united states
guaido s was the opposition s boldest challenge yet to the socialist party and has given maduro s adversaries an unprecedented diplomatic platform to press for change in a nation dogged by hyperinflation rising malnutrition and political conflict
but guaido now leads what amounts to a shadow government disavowed by the armed forces and with no influence over administration such as importing and distributing food and medicine
the industrial engineer said he had spoken on thursday by telephone with supportive heads of state from around the world
in the univision interview guaido repeated his proposal of future amnesties to officials and military members who disavowed maduro even saying the offer could be extended to government ministers and to maduro himself if they willingly left power
guaido s ascent was greeted with excitement by investors holding venezuela and state oil company pdvsa bonds which hit their highest level since despite being almost entirely in default
concerns about potential disruption of venezuelan crude supplies gave support to global oil prices
oil revenues are crucial to the already crumbling venezuelan economy and routing that money away from maduro as the united state seeks to do would be a serious blow
the state department on thursday ordered some government workers to leave venezuela and said citizens should consider leaving the country
guaido took the helm of the national assembly on with a call for the armed forces to recognise maduro as a usurper after his may widely viewed as fraudulent
backing for him has come principally from the western hemisphere
venezuelan allies including russia and turkey both important commercial partners criticized guaido s rise as a sign of interference
the european union which has imposed sanctions on maduro s government noted that venezuelans had massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny but stopped short of recognising guaido
maduro in a rambling speech dismissed guaido s inauguration and said he himself remained the country s legitimate leader
he has relied extensively on the military to maintain power amid annual inflation of nearly million percent and an exodus of venezuelan refugees into neighbouring countries
guaido has said maduro s inauguration to a second term amounted to a usurpation of power
the vote was boycotted by venezuela s main opposition parties with maduro s two most popular rivals banned from running and socialist party aggressive campaigning opponents called
guaido and allies argue that the presidency is vacant as a result and that the constitution calls for the head of congress to assume the interim presidency in such a situation
that still leaves guaido struggling against a state unwilling to recognise him and security forces that could jail him as they did his mentor leopoldo lopez who is under house arrest for leading protests in
can he name ministers
ministers of air
phantom ministers asked maduro during a speech before the supreme court
is he going to name commanders of military units
will the armed forces obey his command
protesters clashed with security forces on wednesday night around the country and in both affluent and working class areas of caracas with some demonstrations spilling over into looting
a total of people have been killed in violence linked to this week s protests according to local rights groups
