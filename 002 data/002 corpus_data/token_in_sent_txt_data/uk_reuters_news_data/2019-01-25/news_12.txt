mexico city jan reuters mexico said on friday that it is willing to mediate between the government of venezuelan president nicolas maduro and opposition leader and congress chief juan guaido if both sides request and agree to it
guaido declared himself interim leader on wednesday with washington and most latin american nations backing the move
but mexico once a vocal member of the lima group regional bloc created to pressure maduro to enact democratic reforms struck a discordant tone
leftist president andres manuel lopez obrador s government said it would not take sides and branded support for guaido a violation of sovereignty
let both sides ask for it
we re willing to help in the mediation we can t do so just because one of the sides proposes it and says here we are lopez obrador told journalists
if they come to an agreement and really want dialogue to find a peaceful solution our country as it has done in the past on issues of foreign policy would again serve as a mediator he added during his daily press conference
socialist maduro said he supported proposals by mexico and uruguay to create an international initiative for dialogue between the political forces in venezuela to seek an agreement within the framework of our constitution which guarantees stability and peace to all maduro who has led the nation since and was last year in an election largely seen as a sham severed diplomatic ties with the united states earlier this week
some diplomats left the caracas embassy for the airport on friday
russia on friday also offered to mediate between the government and opposition in venezuela if necessary saying it was ready to cooperate with all political forces that acted responsibly
