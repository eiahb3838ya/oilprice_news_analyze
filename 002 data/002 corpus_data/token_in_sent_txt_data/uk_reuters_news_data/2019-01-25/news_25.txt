graphic-venezuelan oil exports to u.s. still a primary source of cash
reuters venezuela s oil exports to the united states remain the primary cash resource for its oil company and efforts by the united states to cut off that revenue would likely force it to send crude to china india or other asian countries
refineries that depend on venezuela s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as canadian and mexican crude are often not as discounted and are limited in availability
the united states has considered moves to cripple venezuela s oil shipments which account for nearly all of the country s exports in response to the reelection of socialist president nicolas maduro a vote that was widely viewed as a sham
however it has not yet taken that step nor has it elected to cut off supply of oil that goes to mexico
washington has recognised opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s head of state
guaido is considering naming a board to pdvsa s subsidiary citgo petroleum in a gambit to generate revenue for the opposition
venezuela on average exported about barrels of crude a day to the united states in according to energy department data
the share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to russia and china

venezuela s output has been cut in half since to less than million bpd according to figures from opec secondary sources
shipments to the united states account for about percent of the cash venezuela gets for crude shipments according to a barclays research note published last week
the primary importers of venezuelan crude are citgo valero energy and chevron
the country could seek additional deals with turkey india or other asian nations

while venezuela will be hard hit the first month they will find some market for their crude said diego moya ocampos principal americas analyst in country risk at ihs markit

prices of heavier grades like mars sour an offshore medium crude and heavy louisiana sweet crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply
mars traded at a premium to crude on thursday a high according to refinitiv eikon data as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter traders said
it would make a tight market even tighter
if it happens it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies said bob mcnally president of rapidan energy group an energy consultancy in bethesda maryland

traders said the united states may need to sell oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via canada or mexico
sanctions could also include exports of petroleum products to venezuela that are used for blending with venezuelan heavy crude
