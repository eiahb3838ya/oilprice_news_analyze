france makes biogas support conditional on cutting costs
paris reuters france is ready to provide to billion euros billion of subsidies for renewable gas but only if the industry can substantially lower its costs the government said on friday
produced from methanisation of agricultural and other biological waste biogas still costs about four times more than natural gas imported by pipeline or lng tankers from countries like russia norway algeria or qatar
under its draft ppe energy plan the government set a target for biogas to account for seven to percent of gas consumption by from well below one percent today if costs can fall rapidly
gas grid operator grtgaz said in a statement the draft ppe was worrying for the outlook of the nascent biomethane industry
it said a goal to reduce costs to euros per mwh by was way too ambitious
current tariffs are around euros per mwh
no other renewable energy sector that is mature today has seen its development conditional on such terms grtgaz said
it said the ppe did not account for the fact that biogas is can easily be stored helps deal with waste and provides income for farmers
as it is the ppe trajectory threatens the development of this young industry grtgaz said
through a system of tenders the government wants to boost the amount of biogas produced in france from terawatt hour in to twh in and to twh in
it also wants to boost the amount of biogas injected in the gas grid from virtually nothing today to more than half of production
although france is way behind biogas pioneers like denmark and germany the sector is growing quickly
the amount of biogas injected in grtgaz pipelines rose percent to gwh last year
installed capacity is twh at sites and there is a pipeline of new projects for a total capacity of twh
a year ago french utility engie ceo isabelle kocher said biogas has the potential to grow from about one percent of gas consumption in france to percent by percent by and percent by over the next decade the government wants to reduce total french gas consumption from twh in to about thh in through energy savings and better insulation
