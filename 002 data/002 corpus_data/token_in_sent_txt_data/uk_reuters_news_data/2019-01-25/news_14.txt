update 1-dutch need drastic measures to reach 2020 climate goals
amsterdam reuters the dutch government is lagging far behind on its climate goals and will need to take immediate action in order to meet legally required improvements new data showed on friday
carbon dioxide emissions next year in the netherlands one of the most polluting countries in europe are expected to be percent lower than in the government s environmental agency said despite a court order to reduce them by percent
the calculations are a blow for the government which is already struggling to generate support for measures needed to reach its ultimate goal of halving emissions by and banning them by
the government said in october that it would implement the court order
in recent days however politicians have expressed doubt about the expensive and often unpopular measures that would be needed to do so at such short notice
it s complicated prime minister mark rutte told reporters on friday
we will take it step by step to make sure our measures are well supported
the task is big but the aim is to reach the plans to reach the goal will be presented in april rutte said around the time the government is due to decide how to reach the targets set in the paris climate agreement
uncertainty over the cost of meeting those goals has put rutte s government under pressure less than two months before elections that could cost the coalition its majority in the upper house
the court order to step up the fight against climate change has increased pressure on the government to close immediately at least two of five energy plants
current plans call for two to be shut in and the other three by
shutting two immediately would cost hundreds of millions of euros and deliver just half of the reduction required
further savings would need to come from measures such as lowering speed limits improving home insulation and raising energy prices experts have said
closing the coal plants is the most obvious option abn amro energy expert hans van cleef said
another option is to buy emission rights abroad
but that will be a hard sell politically as it doesn t reduce emissions in the reporting by bart meijer editing by dale hudson and jason neely
