rpt-focus-ge urges speedy fix for power turbine blades, says blade broke in 2015-sources
repeats to additional customers with no changes to text ge offers to extend warranty coverage for turbines ge says blade broke in on turbine after hours ge says executing its plan to fix the blade issue ge says customer feedback is positive by alwyn scott new york jan reuters general electric co is advising some buyers of its big power turbines to switch out faulty blades sooner than expected and has disclosed that a blade broke in according to a presentation reviewed by reuters and people briefed on the matter
the second blade break which has not been previously reported involved an earlier turbine model and was similar to a break last september that severely damaged a turbine in texas and shut it down for two months of repairs
the defective blade issue affects ge s newest turbine technology which cost billions of dollars to develop and is among the challenges facing new chief executive larry culp as he tries to revive the profits and share price of the conglomerate
ge s advice for fixing the problem can curb turbine use by utilities according to the sources and utilities that use ge turbines potentially threatening the revenue streams at the power plants
at private meetings in florida and london last month ge executives said the company is offering extended warranty coverage and making spare parts available to ease concerns of insurers lenders and utilities interested in buying turbines according to a ge executive s slideshow presentation and three people who attended the meetings
some said they signed agreements
ge told participants that turbines with blades should run for fewer than about hours depending on individual plant circumstances before shutting down for blade replacement according to two people who attended the meetings
ge said it had advised customers of the change
ge s previous guidance for blades was after hours
the executives also said in the meetings that the blade that broke in at an undisclosed power plant was in a ge turbine which has similar technology to the ha turbine that broke in texas
the break prompted ge to work on new protective coatings and alter a heat treatment process for the parts a second presentation showed
ge told reuters that after the blade broke in ge did not know at first that the problem would also afflict its ha models
the ha components were in development before the initial issue occurred and the ha units began to ship while the analysis was in process and before it was determined that it was a component issue that impacted the fleet and the ha ge said in a statement to reuters
ge declined to provide more detail about the blade break or usage restrictions saying some of the information is proprietary
we are executing the plan we laid out to fix the blade issue ge said in a statement to reuters
the feedback from customers has been positive and they continue to choose the ha which remains the fleet of advanced technology turbines in the world the details from ge s meetings come as ge is installing new blades in about and ha turbines according to a person familiar with the matter fewer than the estimated after the blade break in texas prompted it to warn that other turbines are at risk for blade failure
reuters previously reported that ge found an oxidation problem not a break in and developed a fix before the failure in texas
scaling back use of ge turbines reduces how much electricity they produce a threat to revenues and profits for exelon corp pseg power llc chubu electric power co inc and others with the ge machines that form the core of modern power plants according to utilities and industry experts
japan s chubu electric said it learned about the blade problem with its six new ge turbines last october
it is restricting operation time at one of the two plants that use ge s ha turbines but expects to have enough reserve capacity to generate sufficient electricity to meet demand during this winter a spokesman told reuters
he said chubu will tally the financial impact depending on how long the plants would be shut down to replace blades
it expects repairs to be completed by the end of february
pseg power and exelon based in the united states declined to comment on how restrictions would affect them
ge is continuing to sell turbines in a slumping market for big power plants where it has lost share to rivals mitsubishi hitachi power systems and siemens ag
ge has said it booked orders for three large turbines last month
ge s share price fell after ge revealed a blade issue in texas on september saying such teething problems are not uncommon with new technology and would require minor adjustments to fix
ge has said it would set aside million for repairs and warranty claims
three days after the break in texas became known electricite de france sa shut down its ha turbine to replace blades
edf did not respond to requests for comment
at the london meeting about insurance industry people gathered in the old library room of lloyd s of london on december according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information
ge power executives marcus scholz and tom dreisbach gave presentations about ge s turbine technology
in its turbine documentation ge has advised its power customers to inspect turbines with generation blades after hours of use
ge said its improved blades known as generation are designed to last hours or more before being replaced
according to page of his presentation dreisbach said the generation blade that broke in failed after hours
new parts treated with a special coating were inspected by technicians after about and hours and cracking was still observed the presentation said
ge inspected other turbines at about hours and early stages of cracking were observed the presentation said
