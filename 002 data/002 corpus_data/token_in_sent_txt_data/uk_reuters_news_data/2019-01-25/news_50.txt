analysis-tunnel exposes deep conflict in italy's populist government
france reuters italy s movement and league party were rivals going into last year s national election became coalition partners in a populist government afterwards and now an alpine rail tunnel threatens to tear them apart
the dispute over whether to forge ahead with one of europe s most ambitious engineering projects is rooted in the divergent nature of the two parties and highlights their conflicting visions for italy s future
the league wants the tunnel to go ahead as do of italians according to an emg acqua poll last week
on the other hand more than half of s and environmentally friendly supporters oppose it
it s striking because they are two populist forces with two very different groups of people supporting them said lorenzo pregliasco a founder of youtrend a political consultancy based in turin the northwestern city where trains are supposed to arrive from france after passing through the tunnel
a boring machine nicknamed federica is already working around the clock more than metres feet below ground on the french side of the border even though rome is threatening to pull the plug as it reviews the project
the tunnel is stoking tension within the coalition because of regional and european elections in may which could reverse the balance of power within the coalition and destabilise a government that manages one of the world s largest debts which is closely monitored by financial markets
polls foresee the league surging above which has already compromised on other major battles in recent months but appears not to want to give ground on the billion pounds tunnel
transport minister and member danilo toninelli told reuters a decision would come before the elections and bigwig alessandro di battista said the project was idiocy
in december italy agreed with france to freeze new contracts on the km tunnel until completion of an italian analysis by a panel of experts which toninelli has said should be published by the end of the month
if the analysis says that we re throwing away money only a madman would move forward leader luigi di maio said on monday
however it might not prove so easy to kill the project
deep in the bowels of the mount cenis moncenisio geothermal energy heats the air to about degrees fahrenheit
with a force equal to the power of eight formula engines boring machine federica rumbles and shakes as she cuts into rock advancing as much as metres per day
so far the joint french and italian company the tunnel euralpin lyon turin telt has dug more than miles km inside the mountain including four access tunnels and about miles km of one of the two main passageways
some people are employed either directly or indirectly telt says and that number will balloon to if and when work reaches full capacity
those in favour of the project known in italy as the tav say the costs of shutting it down with km miles already dug could equal those of finishing it
you can t turn off the boring machine leave it there and walk away said piergiuseppe gilli telt s chief of construction who has worked on the project for years
the european union is picking up percent of the cost which could increase to percent because it is part of a mediterranean corridor meant to link rail yards and ports from spain to the ukrainian border with hungary
french transport minister elizabeth borne has emphasised the geostrategic importance of the project saying it must not lose eu funding
deputy prime minister matteo salvini who is also leader of the league expressed his categorical support for it on friday the tav absolutely must be done
it would cost more not to do it than to do supporters of the rail link have staged two large rallies in recent months in turin which is about miles km from the french border
local league politicians attended the demonstrations
it would improve italy s links to other european countries and permit faster movement of passengers and goods turin resident salvatore bellomo said in the city s central square
this project would bring italy into the in the past the movement which is also supported by activists has frequently clashed with police and after death threats two of telt s top managers are under armed guard
the argument makes against the project is that it is a huge waste of public money and a potential health concern for people who live near the italian work site where some of the rock dust could release asbestos into the air
the money would be better spent on italy s existing infrastructure which is crumbling says citing the collapse of a motorway bridge in august that killed people
the flow of goods is not expected to be large enough to justify public works of these dimensions said angelo tartaglia a retired professor at turin s polytechic university
it would not be profitable and what s worse is the maintenance costs would be higher than the tunnel s tartaglia is on a committee of experts formed by the turin mayor chiara appendino after she became one of the first heads of a major italian city in
the fight against the tunnel dates back to a time when it was still trying to make its name known and the party s founder comic beppe grillo was calling for an environmentally friendly economic model based on happy negative growth
but being in government has forced to shed some of its identity
the movement has already relented on promises to close the ilva steel plant or shut down construction of a gas pipeline from albania
these kind of reality checks are part of the nature of this government consultant pregliasco said referring to ilva and the pipeline
the difference with the tunnel is its higher symbolic value for additional reporting by gavin jones in rome and simon carraud in paris editing by giles elgood
