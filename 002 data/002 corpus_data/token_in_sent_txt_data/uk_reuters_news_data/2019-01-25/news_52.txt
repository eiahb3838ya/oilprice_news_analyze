update 1-german energy regulator to shield power users from coal exit costs
berlin reuters german consumers must not be burdened with higher electricity network fees when the country abandons stable power for environmental reasons the chief regulator of power transport grids said
a coal commission is tasked with drawing up a schedule for the exit from coal on friday or latest building in compensation for operators employees and affected regions in a process
i consider it important to do everything possible to prevent rising prices for consumers because of the coal exit jochen homann president of the bundesnetzagentur or federal network agency said
it is my job to ensure that no unnecessary costs are added to grid fees he said on the sidelines of an industry conference this week
the bundesnetzagentur supervises grid operators to ensure that networks are kept in balance
it also monitors costs which operators charge to consumers
homann s concern about spillover costs is not given the government is keen to keep all sides happy in the coal compromise looking to spread costs and limiting burdens on the general budget
network companies charge consumers percent of their final bill for network investment and management
these costs are already rising because green energy is difficult to integrate due to its intermittent nature causing high spending on handling shortfalls and drawing on reserve plants
in this bill came to billion euros billion and stood at million in the first three quarters of
generation costs could also rise after germany quits coal homann said
it is a simple economic fact if coal plants are taken out of the system supply gets tighter and then you would have to think about prices going up and how to handle that he said
regarding the technical challenges homann said his agency had factored in the possibility that half of germany s existing coal plant capacity of gigawatts gw might close by
of some km miles of additional grids and power line improvements planned to accommodate the increase in renewable installations in the next decade only km have been approved and just km implemented
the picture for plans up to is more favorable
power network operators have completed km out of a necessary km and km have been approved
