update 1-qatar to pay aid into gaza, with hamas approval
gaza reuters qatar on friday said it will pay million million pounds in humanitarian aid to boost the ailing economy of gaza a day after the coastal strip s palestinian rulers stopped the gulf state from paying money directly to impoverished government workers there
the move was widely seen as a compromise between qatar which appears intent on increasing its regional influence and the palestinian islamist group hamas which controls gaza
qatar s for gaza relief efforts mohammed said in gaza it was agreed to allocate the qatari financial grant to pay for humanitarian projects with full cooperation and coordination with the united he said the first agreement with the would be signed on monday next week setting up a million job creation project
a hamas official sami abu zuhri on friday welcomed qatar s decision to give money to humanitarian projects
a day earlier hamas had blocked direct qatari payments to thousands of unpaid palestinian civil servants in gaza claiming that israel had broken agreements about how the arrangement would be carried out
the compromise follows a tortuous regional standoff that has left civil servants in gaza caught up in a bitter power struggle between hamas and the palestinian president mahmoud abbas in the occupied west bank
hamas wants to pay the workers that it hired but doesn t have enough money after years of blockades wars and the failure of reconciliation efforts with abbas
wages have been cut in half for several years and payments were often behind schedule
abbas has refused to pay them hoping that by slashing salaries and thereby worsening economic conditions in gaza he can force hamas back to the negotiating table
israel regards hamas as an implacable islamist enemy but fears that instability in gaza will spill over into violence against israelis
prime minister benjamin netanyahu s government initially blocked the latest qatari transfer but relented on thursday after the israeli military recommended that it be allowed in

an israeli military spokeswoman said that about palestinians had amassed along the gaza border and that some of them hurled grenades and stones toward the soldiers across the way
idf israel defence forces fighters responded by using riot dispersal means and in accordance with the rules of engagement the spokeswoman said
palestinians launched weekly border protests nine months ago demanding the right of return to land from which their ancestors fled or were forced to flee during israel s founding in and an end to a grinding israeli blockade of the territory home for two million people
another palestinian was killed on friday by israeli soldiers in a separate incident in the west bank the palestinian health ministry said
the israeli military said its troops had opened fire at three palestinian suspects who were throwing stones at israeli vehicles driving along a west bank highway and that after receiving medical treatment one of the suspects died
