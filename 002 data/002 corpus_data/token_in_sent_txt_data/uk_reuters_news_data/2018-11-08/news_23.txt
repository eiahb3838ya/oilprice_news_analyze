analysis-iran's economy to suffer but likely ride out us sanctions storm
reuters iran is likely to ride out the storm from oil sanctions suffering recession but no economic meltdown thanks to rising crude prices and deepening divisions between the united states and other major powers officials and analysts say
iran s situation is better than because of high oil prices and the fact that the is isolated this time said a european diplomat who asked not to be further identified
iran emerged in early from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear program
but president donald trump withdrew the united states from the deal in may calling it flawed to iran s advantage and reimposed sanctions in phases with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on
trump aims to force washington s longtime adversary to accept tougher restrictions on its nuclear activity drop its ballistic missile program and scale back support for militant proxies in middle east conflicts from yemen to syria
but the broadly united front of world powers that enforced sanctions on iran previously pushing iran into nuclear restraint has unraveled since trump took office and clashed with allies over everything from trade to collective security
the other signatories to the nuclear deal germany france britain the european union russia and china have condemned trump s walkout from the pact
the eu is preparing a special mechanism to enable payments for iranian oil and other exports without dollars possibly through a barter system
it will be a difficult period but iran s economy will withstand it for various reasons a second diplomat said including the fact of russia being under and eu sanctions saudi arabia having its own financial and political issues and trade war between china and the united big power disunity and eu moves to circumvent trump s sanctions regime have given tehran a psychological boost but not dissuaded foreign businesses ranging from oil majors to trading houses and shipping concerns from pulling out of iran for fear of incurring new penalties
still while the clampdown will probably trigger recession in iran next year economic meltdown should be avoided with a reduced but still significant volume of oil exports continuing a fitch solutions analyst said
tehran is still likely to see a substantial share of its foreign exchange earnings maintained andrine skjelland told reuters
this will enable tehran to continue subsidizing imports of selected basic goods keeping the costs of these down and thus limiting inflation to some in hopes of mitigating the immediate economic hit iranian authorities have hinted that tehran might have to sell its oil at a discount to entice buyers going forward
oil revenues might decline but they will still be enough to run the country said an official involved in iran s international commerce
if we sell our oil for less than market price it will have tens of in another made possible by state control of the oil sector iranian authorities are using special exchange centers to sell dollars at cheaper rates to importers of basic foods medicine and other essential goods
ihs markit senior economist patrick schneider doubted that iran could cushion the economic blow in the near term
despite the rhetoric and attempts to mitigate the downside effects uncertainty will remain prevalent for the next months he told reuters
the international monetary fund has forecast that iran s economy will contract in by percent and by percent in due to the dwindling of oil revenues
at the same time the world bank anticipates inflation in iran jumping to percent in from percent in and to percent in
but iranian officials are defiant citing trump s isolation in repudiating the nuclear deal climbing oil prices and trump s agreement to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries especially dependent on iranian crude
crude prices are rising
even if iran s oil sales drop to barrels per day bpd we will be able to run the economy
but we will send much more than that
our economy will be far from collapse said a senior iranian official
our budget is based on oil of per barrel and is now over per in october iran s crude exports were estimated at million bpd by data intelligence company kpler and million bpd by another firm that traces iranian shipments
trump granted sanctions waivers to china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey which together took in over percent of iran oil exports last year refinitiv eikon data shows
even without the exemptions we will sell our oil
we will bypass sanctions
we have so many countries that are on our side
america can not do a damn thing said a senior official close to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei
the sanctions however will inevitably erode iran s state finances and raise already high inflation and jobless rates making life harder for ordinary iranians
since may when trump took washington out of the nuclear deal prices of bread cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged
the rial s weakness has sent prices of some imports rocketing destroying jobs as some factories using imported parts have folded
around percent of small factories businesses and workshops have begun to close down in the past few months due to scarcity of raw materials and hard currency according to the iranian state news agency irna
moreover trump s sanctions against iran s financial sector essentially make banks and their subsidiaries to foreign lenders undermining its means to facilitate trade
still iran demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in coping with earlier international sanctions and there is little to suggest tehran could not do this again
while ordinary iranians struggled iran s clerical and security establishment and business world sought kept the economy running by means including resorting to barter as well as foreign currencies other than the dollar
