analysis-after defeat in west, u.s. carbon tax push looks east
seattle nov thomson reuters foundation washington state voters have turned down what would have been the first carbon tax but carbon pricing efforts are expected to push on in with nearly a dozen largely eastern states considering legislative proposals experts say
lawmakers in new york pennsylvania connecticut maryland massachusetts new jersey rhode island and vermont aim to introduce carbon pricing legislation including carbon taxes and carbon measures said michael green with carbon pricing think tank climate xchange
the rejection of the washington ballot initiative in elections this week shifts the limelight to legislative approaches he said
also california washington oregon and british columbia have dominated the issue green said
it s going to be the east coast s turn to make it happen and lead on putting a pricetag on greenhouse gas emissions is considered crucial to stemming global climate change as it factors damage from climate change into economic decision making including by businesses economic experts say
in washington the carbon emissions fee and revenue allocation initiative would have imposed a fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions rising a year until the state s emissions target is met
while backers had not yet conceded defeat as of late wednesday the no votes were leading with more than percent
the initiative s defeat came after washington voters turned down a similar proposal in and the state legislature failed to pass a carbon tax in the legislative session despite having a democratic majority and a governor who strongly favors climate action
voters in portland did approve a business tax to fund renewable energy on tuesday
but some carbon pricing advocates think state legislatures now represent a better path forward
green said he believes carbon pricing will have more success if leaders take a approach
for example proposed legislation in rhode island and connecticut contains trigger clauses that would enact carbon pricing only if their larger neighbours in massachusetts and new york respectively adopt such policies
this strategy builds on the existing regional system for electricity in the northeastern and states
massachusetts republican governor charlie baker who was tuesday expressed support for a regional carbon tax during a gubernatorial debate on november
but legislative groups believe that washington state s multiple unsuccessful attempts at a carbon tax advanced the issue nationally
despite the setback of the washington ballot initiative failing the progress made from this fight can not be overlooked said jeff mauk executive director of the national caucus of environmental legislators
washington was the first state to progress a carbon price to the senate floor he said and a strong and diverse coalition of backers formed around the latest ballot initiative
mauk pointed to the likelihood of a bill being introduced in oregon s next legislative session and the potential for action in new mexico a state that has previously studied carbon pricing
progressive legislators are also pledging to continue pushing for carbon pricing in washington though this week s defeat suggests there may be less immediate momentum
carbon pricing advocates pointed to the continuing financial power of big oil which funded the successful opposition campaign to washington s carbon tax with more than million spent on negative ads
the industry also successfully opposed a ballot initiative in colorado calling for greater distances between oil and gas drilling and public spaces
state legislators nationally need to learn a really difficult lessons from this the oil companies will stop at absolutely nothing and they will spend anything they need to make sure that if any carbon pricing initiative ever goes to the ballot it is defeated washington state senator kevin ranker told the thomson reuters foundation via telephone
oil lobbyists insist their opposition to taxes does not equate to rejection of carbon pricing
with this election behind us there is an opportunity for interested parties to work together on a program to provide real greenhouse gas emission reductions without leaving consumers and industries that fuel our state s economy to bear an unfair burden said catherine president of the western states petroleum association which helped bankroll the no campaign in washington
green believes petroleum lobbyists will have a harder time influencing lawmakers in states without significant oil industry jobs than it did influencing voters in washington and colorado
according to the world bank countries and states cities or other jurisdictions have put a price on carbon with another carbon pricing schemes scheduled for implementation
carbon pricing in the united states is not dead and in fact i think it has greater momentum ranker said
