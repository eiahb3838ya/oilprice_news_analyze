argentina biodiesel chamber: u.s. review of tariffs could revive halted exports

this is a necessary and important first step victor castro executive director of the argentine chamber of biofuels carbio whose members include biodiesel exporters cargill inc and bunge ltd told reuters
we are convinced that tariffs are a totally unfair measure and it is very important to be able to export to that market he said adding that due to limited international commercial activity the production level in argentine biodiesel plants has been very low
argentina is one of the world s top producers of biodiesel fuel exporting million tons worth billion in
this year biodiesel producers in argentina exported almost million tons of the fuel between january and august of which percent went to the eu according to official data from argentina state statistics agency indec
however in september and october the volume of biodiesel shipped abroad was zero
the halt in exports coincided with the eu s expected decision on whether to sanction argentina s biodiesel industry over suspicions of receiving subsidies
