update 2-toshiba to pay enn more than $800 million to exit u.s. lng business
reuters japan s toshiba corp will exit its liquefied natural gas lng business by paying china s enn ecological holdings co more than million to take over the unit as part of a plan to shed assets
the sale is the disappointing culmination of a venture that puzzled analysts when it was announced in
asian lng prices have plunged percent in the past five years and the potential for future losses spurred toshiba s exit
under the deal toshiba will sell its toshiba america lng corp unit to enn ecological a unit of enn group for million the japanese company said in a statement on thursday
however once that sale is complete toshiba will then make a payment of million to enn to pass on its roughly billion commitment starting in to purchase million tonnes per year of lng over years from freeport lng in texas
the project posed a huge risk because no one knows how the situation will be over the next years toshiba s chief executive officer nobuaki kurumatani told reporters at a press conference
the company booked a charge of billion yen million for exiting the lng business in its earnings it announced on thursday
the deal is our second major step to expand in the overseas upstream business
we expect to get million tonnes of relatively lng starting in to meet growing domestic demand said clarissa zhang public relations director of enn ecological
toshiba has spent years trying to either sell the gas to power customers or offload the business
toshiba s annual cost of its deal with freeport was a bit over million dollars meaning the company is paying about two years of those costs to enn to take the obligations said nicholas browne director of gas and lng at wood mackenzie
for enn this represents a relatively low cost and immediate way to source significant volumes browne said
for toshiba it clearly ends their short foray in the lng business
enn has been very open that it plans to set up an lng trading business
as such these volumes will contribute to their portfolio and some will not end up in still the deal is a positive sign for lng developers that china is still open for business amid a trade war between the world s economies
toshiba stunned the market in when it decided to enter the lng business
with no experience in shipping or the logistics of the gas and lng business it seemed an odd fit analysts said at the time
toshiba s plan was to pitch lng supplies as a sweetener to likely asian buyers of its turbines used in combined cycle power plants
the company probably wanted to add value to its power plant business by selling not only the power plants but also fuel but for plant builders it s always better to do it all via tenders said junzo tamamizu managing partner of clavis energy partners in tokyo
