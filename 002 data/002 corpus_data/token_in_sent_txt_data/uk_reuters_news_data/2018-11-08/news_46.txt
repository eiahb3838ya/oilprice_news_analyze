update 3-toshiba sheds more assets, cuts jobs to regain investor trust
tokyo reuters toshiba corp announced on thursday it is shedding assets cutting jobs and buying back its stock starting this week sending its shares up percent as the japanese conglomerate aims to regain investor confidence
the company announced it is liquidating its british nuclear power unit and selling its liquefied natural gas lng business to china s enn group as part of a new business strategy which also includes job cuts or percent of its workforce over five years
toshiba s shares surged percent to close near highs after the announcement helped also by a much anticipated move to repurchase up to percent of its own shares starting friday
the company has been trying to win back the market s trust after a accounting scandal uncovered widespread irregularities at the conglomerate for years
the scandal forced it to recognise huge cost overruns at nuclear unit westinghouse prompting it to sell its prized memory chip unit earlier this year to a consortium led by private equity firm bain capital and leaving it with few growth businesses
there had been reports about a possibility of selling business and job cuts so such moves had been expected at some point
but investors are taking heart said hiroyuki fukunaga chief executive of investrust a financial advice firm
the share buyback announcement worth up to percent of outstanding shares is definitely positive toshiba had already promised a share buyback of billion yen earlier this year but the timing had been undecided

south korea s korea electric power corp kepco had been in talks with toshiba to buy a stake in nugen
south korea s energy ministry said on thursday it will coordinate with the british government and monitor the liquidation process with kepco
toshiba said it will sell the lng business to enn ecological holdings a unit of chinese gas company enn group
it has spent years trying to either sell the gas to power customers or offload the business after signing a contract to buy lng from freeport in a venture announced in
asian lng prices have plunged percent in the past five years raising fears of future losses
toshiba will be paying the buyer million to assume its commitment to purchase million tonnes per year of the fuel from freeport lng in texas a cost booked as a charge for the current financial year
the company said its exit from the troubled businesses along with the job cuts and other restructuring moves will help it bolster its profitability in the longer run
