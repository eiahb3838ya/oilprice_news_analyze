vw ceo says arrest of audi's stadler hard to comprehend - bild am sonntag
berlin reuters the ceo of volkswagen herbert diess told a german newspaper the arrest of audi head rupert stadler was a shock and hard to comprehend
vw has suspended stadler head of vw s most profitable brand after german authorities arrested him as part of an emissions probe
it was a massive shock for me
the arrest of a ceo of a major car brand that s never happened before diess told germany newspaper bild am sonntag
the arrest is hard to comprehend
i knew rupert stadler as a problem solver the newspaper quoted him as saying
diess said that for him diess was innocent until proven guilty
stadler who has not made any public comment has not been charged and prosecutors are set to continue questioning him next week
asked whether he could imagine stadler returning diess said it depended on what facts emerge should the accusations of the state prosecutors prove to be true then it s a clear he said that he did not believe audi would suffer immediately from the departure of its ceo
but if it lasts too long then it does become a problem
however i am convinced that we will get through reporting by victoria bryan editing by robin pomeroy
