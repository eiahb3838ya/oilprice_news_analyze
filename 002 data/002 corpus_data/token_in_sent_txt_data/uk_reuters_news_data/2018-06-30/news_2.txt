update 1-libya's oil output down to 315,000 bpd as exports blocked - sources
adds details background london june reuters libya s oil production has been reduced to barrels per day bpd as storage tanks at hariga and zueitina ports fill up due to eastern officials blocking exports two libyan oil sources said on saturday
the production drop has been gradual as ships have been barred from loading at the ports since thursday
some of storage capacity at eastern ports is out of action and the remaining capacity is nearly full one of the sources said
storage at oil fields is also limited due to attacks by islamic state militants in previous years
libya had been producing more than million bpd in recent months but on june an attack against forces loyal to commander khalifa haftar at the ports of ras lanuf and es sider shut them down slashing production by bpd
after recapturing the ports haftar s libyan national army lna announced it would be handing them to a parallel national oil corporation noc in the eastern city of benghazi which said it would stop exports under the internationally recognised noc in tripoli raising the prospect of prolonged output losses
the tripoli noc has said it expects to declare force majeure on exports from zueitina and hariga on sunday bringing total production losses to bpd
port sources said there was no change to the situation on saturday with tankers booked by the noc in tripoli still blocked from loading
western powers have called for the ports to be returned to the exclusive control of noc tripoli
past attempts by factions to sell oil independently of tripoli have been thwarted by security council resolutions
