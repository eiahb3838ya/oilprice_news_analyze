by agnia grigas march reuters as another energy conflict is erupting between russia and ukraine moscow seeks to start construction of the second branch of the nord stream pipeline to deliver russian natural gas directly to germany
while the european union countries remain divided the united states needs to maintain its consistent and principled position to reduce europe s on russian natural gas
on march russian state gas company gazprom announced that it would terminate all gas contracts with ukraine s energy company naftogaz after a stockholm arbitration court ordered gazprom to pay more than billion to naftogaz for failing to uphold contractual obligations regarding volumes of transit gas through ukraine
gazprom s apparent reprisal has increased european fears of a possible gas war in the midst of a cold winter ukraine has already closed schools to conserve energy and the eu is worried about its own gas supplies
these fears could play into gazprom s efforts to push through its nord stream which moscow presents as a simple business project to ensure europe s gas supply
to buy into this line of thinking however is to misunderstand the rationale for this project
gazprom is not a commercial entity but the right hand of the kremlin and russia today is no ally of europe but rather a sanctioned state engaged in war on the continent and bent on destabilizing the eu and nato
nord stream may give the russian military a freer hand in ukraine impede the eu s foreign policy and energy strategy and increase moscow s influence over germany s political and business elites thus aggravating divisions between europe and the united states
initially conceived in moscow as a means of eliminating uncooperative transit countries from its gas business the nord stream project gained momentum when kiev started turning toward the west in the years following its orange revolution
the first nord stream pipeline was completed in and following the annexation of crimea and the war in eastern ukraine moscow has vowed to limit gas flows through ukraine by the end of
the nord stream infrastructure would enable gazprom to cut ukraine out of gas transit traffic which could cost the country about billion in transit fees the equivalent of nearly percent of its projected budget for
revenues aside as polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki recently stated in berlin the real danger lies in the fact that russia can launch a massive land offensive against ukraine without fear of damaging ukraine s pipeline infrastructure and interrupting gazprom s exports to western countries
german chancellor angela merkel disagrees with morawiecki saying that nord stream is an economic project that poses no danger to energy diversification
german business interests see economic benefits if the country becomes a key european gas distribution hub for russian gas
likewise germany wants to ensure its gas supply as it is phasing out nuclear power
unfortunately completing nord stream would go counter to the main principles of the eu s energy and foreign policy strategy
it would challenge nearly two decades of brussels efforts of trying to boost eu energy security by offering alternatives to russian gas such as pursuing the southern gas corridor pipeline to bring caspian gas to europe investing in lng import terminals and pipeline interconnections and increasing reliance on renewables as well as supporting ukraine and maintaining unity moscow
germany does not seem to have learned any lessons from its history
as i write in my newest book on the geopolitics of gas when german chancellor willy brandt signed the country s first gas contract with the soviets in he considered such gas trade as part of his ostpolitik an economic policy toward the east that could reduce cold war tensions and help reestablish contact with communist east germany
but it was washington s military spending and containment policy not the german marks that went to moscow that eventually bankrupted the soviet union and brought down the berlin wall
washington should recall its own efforts during the cold war era when it tried to discourage its european allies from dependence on soviet gas
president ronald reagan imposed sanctions on the ussr in late in response to soviet martial law in poland and also to block soviet construction of the pipeline that would have brought vast quantities of siberian gas to germany and western europe
in the administration extended sanctions to american energy equipment so it would not be used for the pipeline s construction
yet the effort failed to convince europe and by late washington cancelled the sanctions while the pipeline was built
today the united states faces a similar predicament
washington s july russia sanctions threatened to target nord stream but the most recent sanctions implemented in january did not do so explicitly
more recently poland has called for nord stream to be included under sanctions
there is still time for president donald trump to try to achieve what reagan could not and derail russian pipeline plans
american sanctions against nord stream would not be easy to implement given the resistance from countries like germany austria the netherlands and france
german support for future russia sanctions is crucial but getting merkel to agree to add nord stream to these measures seems unlikely
instead washington should push brussels to take a harder look at nord stream s compliance with eu energy policy
while washington today has less sway over its european allies than it did during the height of the cold war the united states can now offer europe an alternative to russian gas american liquefied natural gas lng
american lng has been exported to europe since and expanded to include countries like poland and lithuania last year
the abundance of gas in the global markets due to the booming global lng trade makes nord stream less commercially or strategically necessary for europeans
already opinions have shifted in europe
denmark initially accepted nord stream but has had a change of heart about its second phase
danish legislators passed a law this year that could allow the government to ban russia s nord stream gas pipeline from going through its waters for security reasons
based on this new law the danish energy agency will likely release its decision on nord stream s application for permission to pass through danish waters by the end of march
however as danish sources told me on a recent visit copenhagen wants the eu to take the lead on any pipeline decision
this would prevent denmark from damaging its relations with germany and the united states and incurring the wrath of russia
it would also prevent russia from developing an alternative route to bypass danish waters and eliminate the division emerging in the eu as some member states the czech republic estonia croatia hungary lithuania latvia poland romania and slovakia oppose the project
fifty years since the first soviet pipelines were laid to supply western european countries with soviet gas the eu stands again at a crossroads in its energy policy
while security considerations and economic interests divide the eu countries washington should continue to make its opposition clear
nord stream has no place in europe s security and energy strategy
