dakar march thomson reuters foundation a united nations programme to halt deforestation in the democratic republic of congo home to the world s rainforest is harming local communities and failing to protect forests land rights researchers said on wednesday
the group rights and resources initiative rri called on the world bank to withhold funding from current or pending projects in the province of which has been a test case for a conservation scheme known as
in an area rife with land conflict an rri report said the forest protection projects in this western province threatened the rights and incomes of rural women and indigenous groups including about pygmies
was created to both halt deforestation and benefit local communities yet the current projects in fail to address both objectives said marine gauthier the report s author
a spokesman for the s programme did not respond to requests for comment
the world bank was not immediately available for comment
one of the focal cases involves company wildlife works carbon wwc which denied the accusations
the company obtained a large land concession in order to protect a forest from loggers and uses a share of the money earned from selling carbon credits to benefit people living there said president mike korchinsky
millions of dollars of benefits have gone to the communities he told the thomson reuters foundation
he said wwc had built schools invested in medical clinics and provided years of agricultural support
but gauthier said local communities which signed agreements with the company were not properly consulted and claimed the project had hindered their farming and other activities
these communities actually bear the burden of reducing deforestation she said
rri said women and minorities had been worst affected by the projects that were up and running because they often lack formal land rights and are not consulted about decisions
or reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation was one of the solutions to climate change laid out in the paris accord
it offers monetary incentives to scale back deforestation
congo could become the first country to sign a deal with the world bank this year setting an example for more than developing countries that plan to follow suit said rri
however it warned that deal could exacerbate conflict and set a dangerous global precedent if changes were not made
rri said it had shared the results and that discussions with donors were underway
