gazprom says it is working on reorganisation of trading and export activities, says too early to comment on numbers and moves
moscow reuters russian gas giant gazprom will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices including britain and move them to st petersburg according to two sources familiar with the plan which comes at a time of rising tensions with the west
one of the sources said the decision reflected a broader trend of russian state firms retreating from the west as part of president vladimir putin s drive to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions and also shore up the domestic economy
in russia this story can be sold as a job creation exercise on home turf
this is useful especially ahead of the presidential election said the source referring to the vote on sunday that putin is widely expected to win
the reorganization comes as relations between russia and britain where gazprom has the largest trading office by far have hit a new low after prime minister theresa may said moscow was to blame for the attempted murder a former russian double agent in an english city
however the jobs decision was taken earlier this year long before the spy scandal erupted according to the sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
gazprom which has its headquarters in st petersburg said it was too early to comment on numbers and moves
the company last month that it planned to reorganize its overseas trading and export operations but gave no details
this work is aimed at strengthening the company s position abroad a spokesman said
gazprom s overseas trading and exports divisions employ around people with the bulk of them around in london
it also has offices in locations including paris houston singapore and cities in germany
not all employees are traders as they also include finance and logistics specialists
the reorganization will see the number of people more than halved while about the same number of people will be hired in st petersburg from where many trading operations will be executed according to one of the sources who did not give more specific details about where the cuts would happen
since setting up gazprom s trading offices in london in gazprom has hired dozens of top traders from rival companies such as total and gunvor
russia s annexation of crimea from ukraine in triggered a series of and eu sanctions against the kremlin and its companies and ties have worsened further after russia was accused of meddling in the presidential election
russian state banks such as vtb and companies such as rosneft have since scaled back their presence in the west while some of putin s closest allies such as businessman gennady timchenko have sold their assets in the west and repatriated capital to russia
the west has repeatedly accused putin of using gazprom as a economic and political weapon after the gas behemoth cut supplies to ukraine thus disrupting deliveries to europe
moscow denies that charge
europe gets a third of its gas from russia and gazprom has spent years on building a mighty trading division to help it further boost that share
the plan to move gazprom s trading headquarters from london to st petersburg was first considered by the company s management in but it was put on ice due to concerns about an exodus of people and the difficulties of raising credit for a operation according to gazprom sources
the last time gazprom s marketing and trading division published its results for it said it made a net income of million and a return on equity of percent while staff costs stood at million
the unit has not published results since
