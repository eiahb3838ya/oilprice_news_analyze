update 1-norway close to adopting eu energy rules, averting break with bloc
oslo reuters norway s main opposition party said on wednesday it would support the government s plan to adopt european union energy rules likely securing the law s passage and allowing the european union outsider to remain a full member of eu markets
however labour s support may come with the condition that all power cables should be raising questions about the future of northconnect a planned power cable between norway and scotland
for the past years norwegian companies have enjoyed market access on equal terms with companies in the eu via the european economic area treaty in return for the country s adoption of eu common market regulations
the minority government feared that rejecting the eu s third energy package designed to enhance energy flows and improve regulatory oversight would put norway on a slippery slope to a ending of its close eu relations
norway s parliament is expected to vote on the package on march said a spokesman for the oil and energy ministry
trade unions and several centrist and parties have opposed the regulation believing norway could lose control of its abundant hydroelectric resources
however the opposition labour party the biggest party in norway s parliament said it would back the proposal in return for government guarantees of continued ownership of most power production and infrastructure
under the eea treaty norway retains the right to refuse the adoption of eu rules but has never done so as this would allow the eu to retaliate by suspending other parts of the agreement
norway is working on three cables two of which are under construction by grid statnett and will export electricity to britain and germany
plans for a third cable to scotland called northconnect could come under scrutiny as it is backed by a private consortium consisting of norway s agder energi lyse and as well as sweden s vattenfall
if this goes through northconnect must be taken over by statnett or it will be very difficult to realise the project leiv ingve oerke lyse s head of energy business told reuters
cancelling the gigawatt cable will mean all subsidies that european union so far spent on it will be lost he added
labour is also asking that any decision on a cable built after the first two should be made after they are completed and have been assessed
statnett which in january said northconnect should be delayed as it may overburden the existing power infrastructure in the nordics declined to comment
the government did not want to comment on the final outcome of its talks with the opposition a ministry spokesman said
