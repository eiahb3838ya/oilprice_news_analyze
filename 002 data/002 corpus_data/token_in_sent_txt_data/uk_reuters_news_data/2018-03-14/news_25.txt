u.s. energy pipeline developers to seek exemptions to steel tariff
reuters energy pipeline developers say they intend to pursue exemptions to the trump administration s proposed steel tariffs as concerns grow for those companies and from key exporters to the united states like south korea
we have a number of pipeline projects that would be impacted significantly by this cost increase said adam bedard chief executive of arb midstream an energy transportation and marketing company
if exemptions become available we d certainly try and qualify for he was referring to the commerce department s effort to devise a procedure for companies to apply to avoid paying a percent tariff on imported steel or percent on imported aluminum
commerce has days to come up with the procedure to apply for exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariff declaration issued last week
there is a national security exemption for companies to buy steel items that domestic manufacturers do not produce in the volumes or quality required
the president also said exemptions would be available to certain countries
imports account for percent of the steel used in pipelines according to a study conducted for the pipeline industry
some manufacturers already have customers waiting two years for pipeline to construct lines to carry shale oil and gas from west texas fields to gulf coast export hubs
energy trade associations fought for a way around the tariff
they argued that manufacturers either do not offer key metal grades or diameters or have long production times that would impede development of shale oil and gas pipelines
namerico partners lp which is proposing a multibillion dollar pipeline to move natural gas from west texas to the gulf coast estimates the steel tariff would raise the cost to its customers by between percent and percent
we will do everything we are capable of to limit the impact to our shippers said jeff welch the company s managing partner
namerico has not yet made the final decision to begin construction of the kilometer pipeline he said
even with exemptions tariffs could still raise costs and slow down projects said nicolas adrian mctyre an austin texas attorney and former trial attorney for the federal energy regulatory commission
you are looking at a new regulatory hurdle potentially and there are a lot of unknowns to that process one of the primary providers of steel for pipeline companies is south korea
manufacturers there have said they are considering sending exports to other parts of the world due to difficulties with shipping to the united states even before the tariffs go into effect
john stoody a spokesman for the association of oil pipe lines said at least one member firm which he did not name tried to buy steel from south korea in recent days but was rebuffed due to tariff uncertainty
foreign pipe sellers are hesitant to sell pipe he said
executives at steel companies in south korea say the move is nudging them toward markets
seah steel whose sales to the united states account for percent of total revenue is exploring other markets a company official said
trump s tariff will inevitably impact our exports and make it necessary for us to find a new channel for exports the seah official said
he declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
seah acquired two plants in to reduce any tariff burden according to the company but still has to rely on its korean manufacturing lines for sales
the commerce department said in april that it had found that korean steel producers had been unfairly dumping octg in the market
imports of oil country tubular goods octg from south korea which includes drill pipes casing and tubings were valued at about billion for the to period it examined
that accounted for nearly percent of all octg imports ahead of all other countries commerce said at the time
commerce responded by raising duties as high as percent from a previous range of about percent to percent
the best case is to get exempted but there s nothing else we can say said park hoon ceo of husteel on the sidelines of a meeting between korean government officials and industry executives to discuss the tariffs
he said nearly percent of the company s business relies on sales and the company also is looking to other export markets
