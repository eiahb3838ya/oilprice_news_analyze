it expects to start paying a million a year in corporate tax from the company s tax manager stuart brown said
gorgon is unlikely to start paying petroleum resource rent tax until the he said
however over the past decade exxonmobil australia had an effective tax rate of more than cents in every dollar including income tax and the petroleum resource rent tax
