south australia poll offers voters a choice of clean or cheap power
reuters south australians go to the polls on saturday in a tight race with big implications for national politics and foreign investment in a state with the most wind and solar power but the highest electricity prices in the country
while its outcome will not dislodge prime minister malcolm turnbull the vote presents a choice between renewable energy pushed by south australia s labor government and coal backed by turnbull s conservative government which has mocked the state s big experiment in wind and solar energy
south australia s economy has suffered blow after blow in the last six years with mining giant bhp billiton scrapping a plan to expand its olympic dam copper mine in the collapse of steel maker arrium and a blackout in followed by general motors closure of its holden car plant last year
labor in power for years has turned to renewable energy luring foreign investors such as elon musk s tesla which built the world s biggest battery at a windfarm run by france s neoen and british billionaire sanjeev gupta who wants to revive steel works using solar power
we re sending really a market signal to the world to come to south australia state premier jay weatherill said at the launch of a poll campaign that targets percent of state energy to come from renewables by
south australia already gets nearly half its electricity from renewables but has suffered blackouts when power from coal and gas is unavailable
the plan is a potential bonanza for renewable energy developers as south australia has the nation s highest power prices which are a big deterrent to other investors along with supply reliability concerns
south australians know that jay weatherill is like a problem gambler doubling down to chase his losses on energy policy josh frydenberg the federal energy minister said in an email to reuters
if labor wins an unprecedented fifth term it will be a blow to the federal government s plans for a national energy policy that has no renewable energy target but sets requirements for emissions cuts and reliability
south australia s liberal party promises to cut power bills by cancelling labor s plan for a new power plant and fund instead a new power link to a neighbouring state to back up wind and solar power
the federal government has proposed its own plan but it requires all the states to sign up
south australia has refused to go along concluding it could inhibit their plans for higher renewables said david blowers an energy policy specialist at the grattan institute
if the liberals were to win in south australia you would expect the government will get the approval it needs to labor and liberals are running almost with support of percent and percent respectively the latest newspoll on the south australian election showed
clean air is also the hottest issue in a federal on saturday in melbourne capital of the southeastern state of victoria where labor is battling the greens over the fate of a huge coal project
