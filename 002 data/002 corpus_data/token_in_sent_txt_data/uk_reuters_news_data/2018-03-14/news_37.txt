oil majors give in to investors with share buyback spree
reuters after almost three barren years for investors who have poured millions into the oil sector producers are finally opening the floodgates to a wave of share buybacks that will return money to shareholders this year
oil production topped million barrels per day earlier this year approaching a record set in but until recently many investors in the shale oil revolution were still waiting for their payday
here since the beginning of year companies have promised buybacks with six alone in the past three weeks including devon energy hess corp and noble energy inc
in all companies have committed to buy back about billion worth of shares since february
graphic buyback mania the united states second largest producer chevron corp also weighed in last week hinting it would start buying back shares if it produced stronger cash flow in
the payouts come courtesy of a combination of higher and more stable oil prices and pressure from investors
west texas intermediate wti has more than doubled crossing per barrel
back in oil fell to its lowest in years
there was a time when the consensus was that we d be stuck at around a barrel for oil and obviously conditions have improved since then said derek rollingson a portfolio manager at icon advisers
there is a disconnect between commodity prices and returns from exploration and production before oil started to take a downturn in energy companies had spent billions of dollars in exploration and new projects

that s how angry shareholders are david beard lead energy analyst at research firm coker and palmer said
reacting to market sentiments hess and devon said they would either buy back billion worth of shares or add that much to existing programs
anadarko added a further million to its buyback program while noble energy authorized a repurchase of million
for hess the announcement was also a way to avoid a skirmish with activist hedge fund elliott management ahead of nominations for its board
elliott which owns more than percent of hess had criticized the company for continuing underperformance but supported the buy back program earlier this month
we believe that repurchasing our shares represents a highly compelling return opportunity for our shareholders said hess energy chief executive officer john hess
shale producers have started believing they can drill more profitably as crude prices hold steady at around a barrel
propping up share prices also makes sense if they do want to raise more funds to invest over the next year
as long as oil holds to current prices companies can afford to keep focusing on shareholder returns analysts said
i think we re likely at the beginning of a theme there is a lot of room to improve in terms of equity icon advisers rollingson said
