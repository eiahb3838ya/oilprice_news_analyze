update 2-saudi arabia to keep april crude oil exports under 7 mln bpd  - ministry
dubai reuters saudi arabia plans to keep its crude oil production in april below million barrels per day bpd and maintain exports under million bpd the energy ministry said on wednesday as the top opec producer wants to end a global supply glut and boost prices
saudi arabia the world s biggest oil exporter has been pumping below its opec target since january and reducing its crude shipments particularly to the united states as it turns its focus on cutting exports in an attempt to drain global oil stocks
despite nominations coming in at barrels a day higher than the previous month allocations were maintained on par with their march levels the ministry said in a statement
a spokesman for the energy ministry said that saudi arabia along with the opec and oil producers participating in a global supply cut agreement remain committed to pursuing the common objective of restoring inventories back to their normal the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and producers led by russia have agreed to maintain oil output cuts until the end of aiming to reduce global inventories and support prices
opec has made the average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to around million barrels above that benchmark from above million when the cuts began in
opec has delivered more than percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal according to figures from opec and other analysts helped in part by an involuntary drop in venezuela where output is falling amid an economic crisis
we are happy with the excellent overall conformity levels and look forward to all participating countries maintaining or exceeding full conformity with their commitments as agreed the saudi energy ministry spokesman said
but the relentless rise in production has this year put pressure on oil prices
oil is also increasingly being exported including to the world s biggest and fastest growing markets in asia eating away at opec and russian market share
brent crude futures were trading at around per barrel on wednesday down from above in january
crude oil production pushed up largely by shale oil drilling has risen by almost a quarter since and output soared past million bpd in late overtaking production by saudi arabia
opec meets next in june to decide its output policy
global oil producers agreed they should continue cooperating after their agreement expires at the end of this year saudi arabia s energy minister khalid said in january
