update 10-oil edges up after choppy session on mixed u.s. crude stocks data
new york reuters oil prices gained percent in choppy trade on wednesday after a report showing a crude stock build was offset by large distillate and gasoline inventory draws
crude stocks rose by million barrels the biggest jump since late january the energy information administration eia said
expectations had been for a million barrel build
but there was a draw on fuel stocks
we re not pressuring the downside that much
of course the reason is because we had some unexpectedly large draws in distillates and gasoline that when added together are two times bigger than the crude build said bob yawger director of energy futures at mizuho
brent crude oil futures were up cents or percent to settle at per barrel
west texas intermediate wti futures also gained cents to settle at per barrel
i don t think we have a clear set of directions and i don t think this eia report gives that much of an insight as to whether the rebalance continues or not
we continue to just chop around here said gene mcgillian manager of market research at tradition energy
prices were pressured after the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec said in its monthly report that supply from is likely to grow by million barrels per day bpd in almost double the growth it predicted in november largely due to rising supply
opec also said oil inventories across the most industrialized countries rose in january for the first time in eight months a sign the impact of its output cuts may be waning
opec trimmed its demand forecast for its own crude by bpd to million bpd a fourth consecutive decline
according to the opec report demand for opec s oil must be million barrels per day for the rest of the year to get rid of any remaining oversupply commerzbank strategist carsten fritsch said
oil prices got a boost early in the session from a broader investor push into commodities after chinese data showed industrial production in the world s largest importer of raw materials grew more than expected over the first two months of the year
oil may also soon get some support from seasonal demand
we are now only two to four weeks away from when weekly oil inventory data will start to draw again which should be supportive for oil prices seb commodities strategist bjarne schieldrop said
