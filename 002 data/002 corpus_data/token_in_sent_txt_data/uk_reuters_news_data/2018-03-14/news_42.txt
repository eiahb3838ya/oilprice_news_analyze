oil companies temper iraq's dreams of production expansion
london reuters iraq opec s producer of crude is hitting a roadblock in the next phase of expanding its oil production capacity as the appetite of international energy firms for investing in the country s environment slackens
having slashed production targets in and most international oil firms in iraq are revising their oilfields plateau production levels even lower and the discussions involved are moving slowly iraqi and company sources say
growth has been the hallmark of iraq s oil production in the past decade with a rise of over million barrels per day to a peak of million bpd in late reuters assessments show
iraq owes much of that growth to the likes of bp exxon mobil lukoil eni total and royal dutch shell which oversaw the redevelopment of its oilfields after the invasion in
progress to plateau production levels in iraq but those companies have long complained that the technical service contracts baghdad offers are too stringent and give little return on investment
most companies in the past five years negotiated their production plateaus lower forcing iraq to reduce its capacity expansion plan from million bpd to million bpd by
now this new target is far from attainable and iraq aims to raise capacity to million bpd by
all companies except petronas and total are suggesting their plateaus be lowered abdul mahdi head of the iraqi oil ministry s licensing and contracts office told reuters
on the sidelines of a conference in berlin last month told reporters in principle we accept that we reduce the plateau level for certain fields to lower production rates but this is all under total with partner petrochina has committed to phase three of the expansion of the halfaya oilfield which will double production there to bpd in
petronas is on track to attain production of bpd at its garraf oilfield
iraq monthly crude oil production what you re seeing now is a second wave of renegotiations in light of the oil price and the fact that budgets are down considerably compared to five years ago ian thom principal analyst at consultancy wood mackenzie said
there are alternatives in tight oil and deepwater from many of the iraq players that are more favourable thom said
only lukoil has so far reached a preliminary agreement with the oil ministry on a lower plateau target bringing the goal for its west qurna oilfield down to bpd from million bpd said
but the two sides have not yet finalised talks as discussions continue on when lukoil can hit the new target he said
we are in discussions but nothing has been approved yet said
iraq wants the plateau to be hit earlier than lukoil does said but he declined to specify which timeframes were being discussed
lukoil declined to comment
delays in such negotiations are a headache for any oil company that needs to plan its annual budget based on how many oilfields it wants to drill and what new facilities it needs to bring extra production on stream
the impact of negotiation delays is being felt disproportionately with companies that have production levels farthest from the previously agreed plateau feeling the most heat a source at one of those firms told reuters
iraq s oil capacity is near million bpd and it can easily increase that by a further percent in the next year or two even without a new agreement on plateaus analysts and industry sources say
if you bring the few fields where there is activity under way and if the kirkuk and bai hassan fields return you could see production capacity from existing investments getting close to million bpd in the next year or two thom said
but beyond those investments at oilfields such as rumaila west qurna halfaya and zubair you would certainly expect a of iraq s oil production with the element of natural decline kicking in thom said
