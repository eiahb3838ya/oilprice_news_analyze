facing boycott, qatar focuses on self-reliance in five-year plan
dubai reuters qatar launched a development plan on wednesday that focuses on making the tiny country more in the face of a boycott by other arab states
the national development strategy for pledges to rationalise energy consumption and encourage development of renewable energy while raising levels for farming and fishing production
the plan released by prime minister sheikh abdullah bin nasser aims for qatar to satisfy percent of its demand for farm animals and percent of its demand for fish domestically by partly through fish farms
the document does not give figures for qatar s current level of in these areas but the desert country of million is heavily dependent on food imports
only percent of its land is arable the document says
saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain and egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with qatar on june accusing it of backing terrorism a charge which doha denies
the boycott disrupted qatar s imports many of which used to come across its border with saudi arabia and triggered the withdrawal of billions of dollars from qatari banks by depositors from the four states
qatar s economy and financial markets were hurt as imports plunged about percent from a year earlier in the first weeks of the boycott
but the world s top exporter of liquefied natural gas developed new trade routes and deployed tens of billions of dollars from its sovereign wealth fund estimated to have about billion of assets to protect its banks
gross domestic product data for the third quarter of showed the economy had largely recovered from the boycott and was again growing robustly
efforts to make qatar more began within weeks of the boycott starting as a privately owned local company with government support baladna flew in cows on state airline qatar airways
it plans to build a herd of housing them in sheds cooled by fans and jets of mist
there have been few signs of any resolution to the diplomatic dispute and a senior uae official has said qatar s isolation could last years
in january qatar filed a complaint to the united nations about an alleged violation of its airspace by a uae military aircraft the uae denied any violation
other parts of the development plan deal with social conditions such as encouraging qatari citizens to play sport and improving the health of young people
