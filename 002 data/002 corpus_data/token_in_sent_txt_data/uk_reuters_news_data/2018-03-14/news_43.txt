norway close to adopting eu energy rules, averting break-up with bloc
oslo march reuters norway s main opposition party said on wednesday it would support the government s plan to adopt european union energy rules likely securing the law s passage and allowing the european union outsider to remain a full member of eu markets
for the past years norwegian companies have enjoyed market access on equal terms with companies in the eu via the european economic area treaty in return for the country s adoption of eu common market regulations
the minority government feared that rejecting the eu s third energy package designed to enhance energy flows and improve regulatory oversight would put norway on a slippery slope to a ending of its close eu relations
norway s parliament is expected to vote on the package later this month
trade unions and several centrist and parties have opposed the regulation believing norway could lose control of its abundant hydroelectric resources
however the opposition labour party the biggest party in norway s parliament said it would back the proposal in return for government guarantees of continued public sector ownership of most power production and infrastructure
under the eea treaty norway retains the right to refuse the adoption of eu rules but has never done so as this would also allow the union to retaliate by suspending other parts of the agreement
