ugandan legislator lauds wife-beating, stirs outrage
kampala reuters a ugandan male lawmaker has provoked outrage among rights activists by exhorting men to beat their wives in order to discipline them in comments carried by a ugandan tv channel
onesmus twinamasiko s remarks followed a speech by president yoweri museveni on women s day on march in which he condemned assaults on women by husbands and called it cowardly
as a man you need to discipline your wife the lawmaker told local ntv uganda in an interview on march
you need to you know touch her a bit and you tackle her and you beat her somehow you know to really streamline the majority christian east african country is conservative and as in many countries on the continent homosexuality is illegal
but physical abuse of women is a crime under laws that penalise various forms of assault
the remarks have since triggered mostly condemnation online and in the ugandan press
onesmus responded in an interview with the bbc on monday that slaps are fine but beatings which cause injuries or death are unacceptable
he also told reuters that he was being comic and that his remarks were misunderstood
it is a shock that an honourable member of parliament could mention such words that justified violence said diana kagere mugerwa program officer at uganda s centre for domestic violence prevention
she also said he should make a public apology to women and the nation because he is abrogating the constitution that he swore to writing by elias biryabarema editing by william maclean
