s.korea fuel oil imports soar as coal, nuclear plants shut
coal plants shut to reduce air pollution closure of nuclear plants for maintenance adding to shortfall increased lng imports helping meet shortfall in power capacity by roslan khasawneh and jane chung march reuters south korea s move to shut generators to control air pollution at the same time as nuclear reactors are going into scheduled maintenance is resulting in surging fuel oil imports as utilities burn the dirty feedstock to meet power demand
south korea s trade ministry said in february it would suspend five power plants with a combined capacity of gigawatts gw from march to june part of a broad campaign to reduce pollution
that plan may backfire at least in the
a cold winter has raised power and heating demand forcing utilities to burn more fuel oil in order to meet demand
a of the crude oil refining process fuel oil s biggest use ahead of power generation is as a shipping fuel
in the fuel oil imports will increase to make up for the shortfall in generation capacity said pat markey managing director of consultancy sierra vista resources
fuel oil imports by power producers into asia s fourth largest economy have jumped to tonnes in march so far up from tonnes in february tender data compiled by reuters showed
fuel oil imports are expected at tonnes up percent from a year ago and already more than percent of the tonnes taken for all of last year
burning fuel oil for power results in lower carbon dioxide emissions than plants but releases more toxic particles into the air
pollutants generated during combustion of fuel oils are nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide greenhouse gases volatile compounds like unburned hydrocarbons and toxic trace metals according to the commission for environmental cooperation
an official from a south korean utility said the increased fuel oil demand was partly a result of the government s decision to halt plants temporarily due to pollution and reduced nuclear power because of planned maintenance
the official who declined to be identified as he is not unauthorized to speak to the media said some tonnes of fuel oil would be needed in april
only two of south korea s major utilities korea power co ltd ewp and korea western power co wp issue tenders for fuel oil for power generation mostly during peak summer and winter demand data on thomson reuters eikon shows
the two utilities declined to comment
coal power generates about percent of south korea s total electricity needs nuclear around percent and natural gas meets percent
the rest comes from oil and renewables
even with the increase in fuel oil purchases south korea will have to raise imports of other fuels to meet demand as nearly half of its nuclear power plants are down for maintenance
liquefied natural gas lng is the most likely to fill the gaps
thomson reuters eikon data shows south korea s lng shipments reached nearly million tonnes between january and march up percent from the first quarter of last year
