update 2-opec sees oil supply surge from rivals, countering its cuts
london reuters opec on wednesday raised its forecast for oil supply this year to almost double the growth predicted four months ago as higher prices spur shale drilling offsetting output cuts and a collapse in venezuelan production
in a monthly report the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said producers would boost supply by million barrels per day in
that was the fourth straight rise from bpd forecast in november
for higher growth is expected on the back of the projected increase in shale production following a better price environment not only for shale producers but also for other countries such as canada the uk brazil and china opec said of the outlook for supply
this would lead to a higher quarterly distribution throughout the year with a level projected for the fourth quarter opec said
opec russia and several other producers but not the united states began to cut supply in january in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since
they have extended the pact until the end of
the deal has helped boost oil prices which topped a barrel this year for the first time since and were near on wednesday
but it has also encouraged a flood of shale fuelling a debate about the curbs effectiveness
oil pared much of an earlier gain on wednesday after the release of the opec report
the iranian oil minister said opec could agree at its next meeting in june to start easing the curbs in the wall street journal reported
he also said opec should aim for oil around to contain shale growth
top exporter saudi arabia however said in february it was premature to discuss an exit strategy
growth in demand due to a robust world economy has added a tailwind to the opec supply effort
although opec in the report slightly raised its estimate of growth in world demand to million bpd it now projects the expansion in supply outside the group will exceed gains in demand
this brings opec s view closer to that of the international energy agency which expects a less rosy balance
while rivals are pumping more opec s production in february fell according to the report
total output dropped by bpd to million bpd led by declines in iraq the united arab emirates and venezuela according to figures opec collects from secondary sources
adherence by the opec members with output targets rose to percent according to a reuters calculation based on the opec figures higher than percent in january based on last month s report
the figures that opec members reported themselves showed some deeper declines in production
venezuela whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis told opec its production sank by about bpd to million bpd in february
the number is believed to be the lowest in decades
with outside producers expected to increase supply by more than demand opec cut its estimate of the global requirement for its crude in by bpd to million bpd
should opec keep pumping at february s level and other things remain equal the market could move into a deficit of about bpd suggesting inventories will be drawn down
this is less than the deficit of about bpd implied last month
the supply cut s original aim was to shrink oil inventories in developed economies to their average
the latest figures gave a mixed picture on stock movements
stocks rose by million barrels in january to billion barrels although this was only million above the average the closest yet opec has come to the original target
opec is now talking of looking at other metrics to assess the market s rate of return to balance
