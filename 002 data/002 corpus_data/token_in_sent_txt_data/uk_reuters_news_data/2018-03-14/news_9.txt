west virginia orders etp to stop some work on rover natgas pipe
march reuters environmental regulators in west virginia ordered energy transfer partners lp to again halt work on its rover natural gas pipeline in the state due to permit violations
these are just the latest of numerous permit violations that the billion rover pipeline has racked up since etp started building the project in the first quarter of
rover is the biggest gas pipe under construction in the united states
it is designed to carry up to billion cubic feet per day bcfd of gas from the marcellus and utica shale fields in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia to the midwest and canada s ontario province
one billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
the west virginia department of environmental protection dep issued the order on march following inspections in mid to late february
the state said inspectors observed permit violations including problems with storm water and trash
we continue to work with the dep to resolve any outstanding concerns etp spokeswoman alexis daniel said
this is not the first time west virginia stopped etp from work on rover
the dep ordered the company to halt some work from july to due to violations of storm water rules
in addition the federal energy regulatory commission stopped etp from horizontal drilling in ohio from may to after an estimated million gallons of drilling fluid spilled into a wetland near the tuscarawas river
energy companies use horizontal drilling to cross under obstacles such as rivers and highways
before those stop work orders etp expected to finish rover in november
etp said it still expects to complete the project by the end of the second quarter of
rover has been partially in service since august and is now able to transport up to bcfd
some analysts however said it would be difficult for etp to complete rover that soon
etp has said in filings that it plans to conduct some horizontal drilling in april and may making it more likely that they will not finish the project until the third quarter said peter busk a research analyst at energy research firm east daley capital in centennial colorado
