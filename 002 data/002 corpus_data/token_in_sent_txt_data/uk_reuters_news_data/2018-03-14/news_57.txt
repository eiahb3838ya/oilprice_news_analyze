update 3-republicans scramble to salvage congressional seat in pennsylvania
adds background about lamb by david morgan canonsburg march reuters republicans are scrambling to avoid a political embarrassment in a conservative district of pennsylvania where a democrat could be about to win a congressional election in one of president donald trump s white strongholds
democrat conor lamb a marine veteran and former federal prosecutor is in a dead heat with republican state representative rick saccone in tuesday s special election for an open seat in the house of representatives that republicans have held since
the race is seen as a referendum on trump and a harbinger for november s congressional elections according to pollsters and party insiders who say the moderate democrat could emerge as a model for democratic candidates in other competitive house districts that trump carried in
the democrats have nominated the ideal candidate because he fits the profile of the electorate
if they d nominated a liberal who allowed the campaign to become nationalized it would be over by now said terry madonna director of the franklin and marshall college poll in lancaster pennsylvania
if he wins or even if he just comes close he is a model for democrats in competitive trump districts trump won the district in southwest pennsylvania by nearly points in and has endorsed saccone
the economy is raging at an all time high and is set to get even better
jobs and wages up
vote for rick saccone and keep it going the president tweeted on tuesday
still lamb has fought to make the contest a local referendum and said he was focused on issues in his district even as he welcomed democratic enthusiasm over the race
this is a local race lamb told reporters after voting at a church in his hometown of mt
lebanon shortly after sunrise on tuesday
i don t think it has anything to do with the polls closed at gmt
republican dominance has been so strong in the district that democrats ran no candidates in the previous two house elections even though state voter registration records show democrats outnumbering republicans
but dynamics have changed in the district which runs from wealthy suburbs south of pittsburgh through hardscrabble steel and coal mining towns to farmlands along the west virginia border
saccone a conservative who has described himself as trump before trump was trump led the race by more than percentage points in january
the contest has since narrowed to a on a wave of democratic voter enthusiasm for lamb
republicans have also found it harder than expected to mount effective attacks on lamb s positions on abortion guns and the national democratic party
he has eschewed the national democratic brand saying he would not support house democratic leader nancy pelosi as speaker
lamb says he personally opposes abortion but accepts the supreme court s roe wade landmark decision allowing abortion as the law of the land
he favors enforcing existing gun laws and improving the current system of background checks over setting new gun restrictions
larry gdovic a state government employee from elizabeth township voted for lamb
he s a young new guy with a lot of good fresh ideas
i don t believe he s a total democrat gdovic said
