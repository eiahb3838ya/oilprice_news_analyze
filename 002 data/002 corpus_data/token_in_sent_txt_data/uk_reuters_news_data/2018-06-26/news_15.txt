update 10-ge breakup leaves it with best and worst performers
reuters general electric co said on tuesday it will spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in firm baker hughes effectively breaking up the conglomerate which was once the most valuable corporation and a global symbol of american business power
the company will focus on jet engines power plants and renewable energy which ge hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past years
this is really the culmination of years of observations i ve had about the company said chief executive john flannery a ge veteran who took the helm in august with a mandate to revamp the company
flannery s comments came on a conference call with investors and analysts
ge said its plan will strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt building up cash and further shrinking ge capital
shareholders will receive percent of the value of ge healthcare as a distribution of shares
ge shares jumped percent to on track for their best day in three years
effective tuesday ge was kicked out of the dow jones industrial average the iconic stock index of which it was a founding member in
the company will spin off the profitable healthcare unit over the next to months and sell its baker hughes stake over two to three years
ge will likely either need to hold an initial public offering of baker hughes organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors or find an entirely new investor to acquire its holding since the only two strategic buyers of its stake schlumberger nv and halliburton co would have major antitrust risks in the oilfield services market analysts said
in an interview flannery declined to rule out selling healthcare or the baker hughes stake to strategic buyers but he said the company intended to have them both trade publicly so ge shareholders benefit from future growth
the decision to divest does not mean ge dislikes the businesses he said
it s quite the opposite
we re trying to get these out directly into our shareholders hands and in an environment where they can grow more ge pledged to preserve its dividend until the healthcare unit is spun off partially appeasing investors who have expressed concerns about the company s ability to pay it
the moves which end a strategic review mirror changes that analysts had sought a year ago
ge said its plan to divest billion in assets is substantially complete leaving a simpler and stronger company that it hopes will boost growth operating profits and shareholder returns
major shareholder trian fund management supports ge s plans and believes that the initiatives will create substantial value for shareholders it said in a statement
the remaining businesses share similar technologies and industrial markets in contrast to limited synergies that exist with ge healthcare fitch analyst eric ause said in a note
to view a graphic on ge market capitalization under past ceos click but the changes leave ge with some of its and units
aviation has been highly profitable but power business profit has tumbled as sales of plants and services have slowed and renewable energy profit margins are less than percent a result of fierce price competition
flannery said in the interview that he expected electricity generation to keep rising over the next years
but new power plant sales will be weak and frankly we re planning for that as sort of indefinite flannery said
we re making management actions now premised on we ve got to live in that world he said
if it changes great but don t the healthcare unit spinoff follows rival siemens ag s floating its medical business as a separate company siemens healthineers in march
on monday ge said it agreed to sell its distributed power unit for billion to buyout group advent
ge also has agreed to shed its transportation unit which makes railroad locomotives
ge bought baker hughes in and combined it with its own equipment and services unit to create a new company in which ge owns percent
the unit reported sales of billion in
ge estimated restructuring costs at between million and billion and said it plans to reduce industrial net debt by about billion by and maintain more than billion of cash on its balance sheet
the company has foundered in key markets in recent years and a foray into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in
ge has since largely divested ge capital but lingering liabilities forced it to take a billion charge last year and begin setting aside billion more in reserves against insurance claims
former ge ceo jeff immelt who ran the company for years from shortly before the attacks to last summer said in a statement that important elements of ge s history would continue after the latest batch of sales are done
ge remains a formidable company he said
