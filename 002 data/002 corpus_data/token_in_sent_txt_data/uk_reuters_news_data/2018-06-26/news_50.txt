china to become top gas importer in 2019 boosted by lng -iea
london june reuters china will become the world s top importer of natural gas next year boosted by liquefied natural gas lng purchases as its superpower economy grows and weans itself off energy the international energy agency said on tuesday
in its gas annual report the iea said chinese demand for natural gas will rise by almost percent between and to billion cubic metres bcm including a rise in its lng imports to bcm by from bcm in
imports of lng natural gas to liquid form so it can be transported around the world on vessels will rise to bcm by from bcm last year a rise of bcm including china s bcm growth
global lng exports meanwhile will surge percent by with the united states becoming the second largest supplier in the world compared to its negligible exports last year thanks to the shale revolution that has transformed its energy markets
the report from the agency highlights the might the two powerhouses have over global energy markets just as president donald trump squares off with beijing over trade
china threatened tariffs on oil and gas in retaliation to taxes imposed by washington on billion worth of chinese goods although lng was not included in that threat
china s rise to the top spot next year as an importer of both piped gas and lng will knock japan into second place but they together with south korea continue to dominate the markets
china japan and south korea imported percent of the bcm of lng sold last year and will buy percent of the bcm of lng sold in
when all of asia is taken into account lng sales there will rise to percent of all lng sold globally from percent last year
the demand for lng in the top three asian buyers has been driven by policy as they move to the energy source from power plants
in japan the fukushima nuclear disaster accelerated demand after nuclear plants went off line
in other asian countries such as indonesia composed of hundreds of islands gas is a convenient cleaner and cheaper way of receiving energy than constructing pipelines for gas or using petroleum products such as diesel
on the production side global natural gas output will rise percent by to trillion cubic metres tcm with the united states contributing by far the largest amount to growth of bcm extra gas in that period
much of that excess gas will be liquefied into lng to be exported making the united states the second largest seller of lng by in the world with bcm pushing australia into third place with bcm and biting at the heels of qatar as the top exporter at bcm
lng from the three countries will account for percent of global sales of bcm
