update 5-iran says it can handle fresh sanctions amid national strike
london reuters president hassan rouhani promised iranians on tuesday the government would be able to handle the economic pressure of new sanctions amid a second day of demonstrations in protest at financial hardship and a weakening rial
parts of tehran s grand bazaar were on strike for the second day running state media reported after traders massed outside parliament on monday to complain about a sharp fall in the value of the national currency
video footage posted on social media showed protesters setting fire to garbage dumpsters in tehran streets to block riot police from attacking them
reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the footage
other videos showed riot police breaking windows of closed shops and striking parked motorcycles with batons
the police has accused protesters in recent days of causing damage to public property
metro stations near the bazaar were closed for hours as the result of protests state media reported
pictures also showed shopkeepers were on strike in other cities including arak shiraz tabriz and kermanshah
on monday police patrolled the bazaar following clashes with protesters angered by the rial s collapse which is disrupting business by driving up the cost of imports
defending his economic record rouhani said the government s income had not been affected in recent months and the fall in the rial was the result of foreign media propaganda
even in the worst case i promise that the basic needs of iranians will be provided
we have enough sugar wheat and cooking oil
we have enough foreign currency to inject into the market rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television
washington is to start reimposing economic penalties on tehran in coming months after president donald trump quit an agreement between major world powers and iran in which sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme
this may cut iran s hard currency earnings from oil exports and the prospect is triggering a panicked flight of iranians savings from the rial into dollars
a senior official said on tuesday that countries buying oil from iran should prepare to halt all imports of it starting in november or face punishment
the international monetary fund estimated in march that the government held billion of foreign assets and reserves and that iran was running a current account surplus
these figures suggested iran might withstand the sanctions without an external payments crisis
iran s judiciary chief warned on tuesday that the economic saboteurs who he said were behind the fall of rial would face severe punishment including execution or years in jail
the enemy is now trying to disrupt our economy through a psychological operation
in recent days some tried to shut down the bazaar but their plot was thwarted by the police ayatollah sadeq larijani was quoted as saying by fars news agency
tehran s prosecutor abbas said some protesters near the bazaar were arrested on monday and would not be released before going to trial
the iranian government is implementing new plans to control rising prices including banning imports of over products preparing its economy to resist threatened sanctions
rouhani who is under pressure to change his economic team said the fresh sanctions were part of a psychological economic and political war adding that washington would pay a high price for its actions
withdrawal was the worst decision he trump could make
it was appalling
it hurt america s global reputation he said
in late december demonstrations which began over economic hardship spread to more than iranian cities and towns
at least people died in the ensuing unrest the biggest expression of public discontent in almost a decade
demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption but the protests took on a rare political dimension with a growing number of people calling on supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei to step down
