graphic china seaborne coal imports price by clyde russell launceston australia june reuters china s seaborne coal imports are on track to have surged by around percent in the first half of the year with indonesia emerging as the big winner among exporters
imports are likely to be around million tonnes in the first six months of this year up from million tonnes for the same period in according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
it also appears that june may be the strongest month so far this year with million tonnes discharged or in the process of discharging as of tuesday
the final figure may be slightly higher at around million tonnes the data is filtered only to show ships that have already discharged are discharging or awaiting unloading and more cargoes may be handled in the final days of june
the strongest month so far this year for china s coal imports from the seaborne market was march s million tonnes according to the data
a look at the breakdown of where china is sourcing its coal reveals a surprise packet indonesia
china has imported about million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first half of compared with last year
on a net basis it s all from the southeast asian country
imports from indonesia were around million tonnes in the first half up from million for the same period in
the strength of shipments from indonesia may raise some eyebrows among those who believe china is trying to lower air pollution from burning coal partly by using less and partly by switching to coal
indonesia s exports are predominantly coal typically with an energy value of kilocalories per kilogram or less
however indonesia s coal is also typically low in sulphur
that makes it useful for chinese coastal power plants to blend with domestic supplies or imports
this allows them to lower emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide albeit at a small penalty to the efficiency of the boiler
it s also worth noting that indonesian coal trades at a substantial discount to thermal coal from main regional rival australia
indonesian coal as assessed by argus media was at a tonne in the week ended june
the weekly index for coal at australia s newcastle port was
the discount of the indonesian grade to newcastle has widened substantially over the past year going from percent at the end of june to the current percent
while this is encouraging additional cargoes from indonesia it also means that australian exporters are enjoying higher prices even if their volumes are more or less the same
china imported million tonnes from australia in the first six months of the year fractionally higher than the million tonnes in the same period in according to the data
while indonesia and australia dominate supply to china it s worth noting that russia also managed to lift deliveries with imports rising percent to million tonnes in the first half
china s imports from the united states which are predominantly coking coal used in dropped in the first half to million tonnes a decline of percent
this occurred well before any potential impact of proposed chinese tariffs on coal from the united states which may be imposed as part of the escalating trade dispute between the world s two largest economies
the decline so far this year in imports from the united states is more likely related to australian coking coal being more competitive and available given the absence this year of major outages
overall china s increased appetite for imported coal appears to be contributing to higher prices with the newcastle index up percent so far hitting a high of a tonne in the week ended june
