the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london june reuters hedge funds left their positions largely unchanged in the run up to last week s meetings among oil ministers from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies
hedge funds and other money managers trimmed their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum for the ninth week in a row
but the combined net long position was cut by just million barrels in the week to june the smallest weekly amount since the middle of april taking the total reduction so far to million barrels since april
there were only very minor changes to positions in all crude and fuels contracts
portfolio managers cut net positions in nymex and ice wti million barrels heating oil million and european gasoil million but added positions in brent million and gasoline million
in most cases position changes were driven mainly by small reductions in existing bullish long positions rather than the creation of new bearish short ones
even after the long liquidation over the last nine weeks fund managers remain overwhelmingly bullish about the outlook for oil prices later in
bullish long positions outnumber bearish short positions by a ratio of more than down from a peak of almost in but still exceptionally high
hedge fund managers have become slightly less bullish about the outlook for oil prices rather than outright bearish
short positions remain at unusually low levels in all petroleum contracts and there has been no sign of significant new short selling
