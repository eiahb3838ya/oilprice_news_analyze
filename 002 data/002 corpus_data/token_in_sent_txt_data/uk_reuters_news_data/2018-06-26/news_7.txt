washington is pushing countries to halt imports of iranian oil from november a senior state department official said adding it will not grant waivers to sanctions
that lit a fire under oil markets today said matt smith director of commodities research at clipperdata
it overshadowed saudi arabia s plans to pump up to million barrels of oil in july the most in its history traders said
president donald trump in may said his administration was withdrawing from a deal between iran and six world powers aimed at curbing tehran s nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions
during the previous sanctions regime some asian countries received waivers enabling them to buy iranian crude
if waivers are not granted that suggests reduced flows to asia as well as to europe
this is a new development smith said
if we are going to see more iranian barrels coming off the market that is likely to be bullish for iran s seaborne crude exports fell to about million bpd in june from mln bpd in may and mln bpd in april based on thomson reuters data
the official specifically cited india and china as countries that would have to stop accepting iranian imports though officials have not yet spoken with those countries
india imports large quantities of oil from iran though the country has suggested it would comply with washington beijing meanwhile has not committed to an agreement to stop buying iranian oil and rising trade tensions with the united states may make such an agreement less likely
the market was also dealing with the outage at syncrude canada s bpd oil sands facility near fort mcmurray alberta which a spokeswoman confirmed will remain offline through july
traders expect this to reduce crude flows to cushing oklahoma delivery point of the crude futures contract
in addition a power struggle among the two parallel libyan national oil companies created uncertainty on the country s export ability
these output losses follow a move by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil producers last week to increase supply by around million barrels per day bpd
there is concern that the recent agreement by opec and producers will not be enough to satisfy oil demand said andrew lipow president of lipow oil associates
the api data showed builds in gasoline and diesel inventories
the figures are followed with wednesday s release of energy information administration figures on oil and refined product stocks
