palm oil ban likely to displace, not halt, biodiversity losses -study
paris reuters a ban on palm oil due to fears it may cause deforestation could displace rather than halt global biodiversity losses as it would likely increase output of other oil crops to meet rising vegetable oil demand an international survey showed on tuesday
palm oil has been at the heart of heated debate in recent years notably in the european union where the parliament has suggested banning its use in transport fuels altogether raising outcry in top world producers indonesia and malaysia
an eu deal was adopted earlier this month to phase out of its use by
the report released by the international union for conservation of nature iucn acknowledged palm oil was eating into tropical forests and stressed that because palm trees were grown in the tropics its production could have catastrophic effects on global biodiversity
the iucn a group of governments conservation organisations and scientists said palm oil production was threatening over species with orangutans gibbons and tigers among those suffering severe harm
areas into which palm oil could potentially expand are home to more than half of the world s threatened mammals and almost of all threatened birds the report found
but if other oil crops which require up to nine times as much land to produce than palm oil were to replace palm oil the damage could shift to ecosystems such as the south american tropical forests and savannahs iucn said
palm oil is decimating south east asia s rich diversity of species as it eats into swathes of tropical forest report lead author and chair of iucn s oil palm task force erik meijaard said in a statement
but if it is replaced by much larger areas of rapeseed soy or sunflower fields different natural ecosystems and species may the report was released on the sidelines of the european conference of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo in paris
certified palm oil had so far proven to be only marginally better in preventing deforestation than its equivalent the report said
it noted however that the approach was relatively new and held potential for improvement
the organization also called on governments to protect forests in all vegetable oil producing countries and limit demand for uses of palm oil such as biofuels
the iucn report comes in response to a resolution adopted by its government and members and aims to provide a constructive path to improving sustainability in the palm oil industry it said
it only looks at palm oil s impacts on biodiversity not its social or economic impacts which should be addressed next year
