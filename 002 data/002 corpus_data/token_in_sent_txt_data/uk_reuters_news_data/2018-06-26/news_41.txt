exclusive-trump's epa ignored energy department calls to limit biofuel waivers
new york june reuters the trump administration s environmental protection agency has consistently ignored recommendations from the department of energy to reject or limit waivers to oil refiners seeking exemptions from nation s biofuels law according to five sources familiar with the matter
the renewable fuel standard requires the firms to cover costs of blending ethanol into gasoline
but the epa after consulting with the energy department can exempt small refineries in cases where compliance presents a disproportionate economic the waivers can save refiners tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year
under epa chief scott pruitt an appointee of president donald trump the agency has issued more than two dozen such exemptions in recent months about triple the usual number granted under past administrations
during that time epa has consistently granted full waivers in cases where the energy department recommended only partial exemptions and at least once granted a full approval when the energy department advised an outright rejection according to two sources familiar with the decisions
that approach marks a sharp break from obama administration s epa which had often either adopted energy department recommendations or when it didn t ruled against exempting oil refiners the sources said
the shift between the democratic and republican administrations shows how political ideologies and constituencies can steer bureaucratic interpretation of a law that never changed with major impacts on industry
the waivers save refineries money by freeing them from their obligation to blend ethanol into their gasoline or to purchase compliance credits from those who do
the broad use of waivers lately has angered the powerful corn lobby which argues they threaten corn demand
the renewable fuels association which represents ethanol makers last month estimated that the waivers have reduced the amount of ethanol refiners are required to blend by billion gallons
the law currently requires refiners to blend billion gallons of the biofuel per year
the surge in waivers has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to lows saving refiners such as valero energy corp and pbf energy hundreds of millions of dollars
until now it was not known if the epa gave the waivers on the basis of the energy department recommendations or despite them
the epa has denied public records requests seeking information on the waivers which it considers proprietary company information
biofuel groups have asked the court of appeals for the circuit in washington to review legality of the waivers arguing the epa is methodically destroying the demand for renewable fuels and to force the epa to disclose them
epa spokeswoman molly block declined to comment on the pending litigation or on whether the agency has approved waivers that the energy department recommended rejecting
from the beginning of this administration we have worked closely with our partners at doe on this issue she said in a written statement
doe spokeswoman shaylyn hynes did not respond to requests for comment
during a recent midwest tour pruitt told nebraska farmers that the epa works in alliance with the department of energy to grant the waivers saying there was just one example of disagreement
epa spokespeople have repeatedly said the agency s criteria for granting waivers have not changed
the sources with knowledge of the two agencies interactions disputed the assertion that the epa and doe are acting as partners in these decisions
they declined to provide a specific number of cases in which the epa has gone against energy department recommendations or to name most of the companies involved but did provide two examples of what they said has become regular practice
in one case the epa provided a full waiver to a refiner after the energy department had recommended rejecting the exemption two sources told reuters
in another the epa granted full waivers to refineries owned by andeavor a large refining company which reported billion in net income last year after the energy department had recommended a exemption according to two other sources familiar with the company s approval
the waivers for andeavor were first reported by reuters in april
the company said in a may earnings statement that the waivers provided to its smallest refineries saved it about million in compliance costs
scott labelle an andeavor spokesman declined to comment beyond the company s previous statements
obama s administration was accused of being too stingy with the waivers
last year an appellate judge said obama s epa had used too narrow a definition of financial hardship when it denied sinclair oil waivers for its wyoming refineries for and
but appellate judges in two other similar cases upheld the epa s denials and its methods
neither the rulings nor the change in presidential administrations changed the way energy department analysts scored applications according to the sources
energy department analysts score applications on a test that considers whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact or threaten a refinery s viability
qualifying under either leads to a partial exemption qualifying under both leads to a full exemption
the epa s relaxed standard for the waivers is the latest illustration of the agency s leadership seeking to deliver relief to refiners from the law which was signed under republican president george bush to help farmers reduce petroleum imports and improve air quality
pruitt has repeatedly recommended overhauling the law to reduce strain on refiners and advocated for changes during months of failed negotiations between oil and corn representatives mediated by president donald trump
republican senator joni ernst from iowa the top state said pruitt s handling of the waivers appeared to be based on a political goal of helping the oil industry a charge the epa has denied
this is definitely a workaround that they have figured out
that s why we are demanding transparency ernst said in an interview referring to requests her and other lawmakers for the epa to disclose information on the waivers
the current administration has attempted to lower compliance costs for some refiners since billionaire investor and carl icahn first raised concerns to trump during his campaign and then again after trump named icahn as a special advisor on industry regulation after his election
icahn resigned from his advisory post in august under pressure from lawmakers who said his dual role as investor and advisor posed ethical concerns
icahn s cvr energy was among the refining companies that received a waiver from epa reuters reported earlier this year
