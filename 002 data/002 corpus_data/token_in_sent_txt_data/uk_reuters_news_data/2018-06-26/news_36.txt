update 4-as investment stalls, auto industry warns pm may: avert a brexit car crash
london reuters uncertainty over brexit has halved new investment in the british car industry and prime minister theresa may should urgently change tack to keep the world s fifth largest economy in the eu s customs union the country s main car lobby group said
public announcements of fresh investments into new plant machinery models and model development fell to million pounds million between january and june down from million pounds in the first half of
there is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of brexit negotiations said mike hawes head of the society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt
government must rethink its position on the customs union hawes said referring to may s position that britain will leave the customs union which groups eu members in a area where there is a common import tariff for goods
with only nine months left until britain is due to leave the eu there is little clarity about how trade will flow as may who is grappling with a rebellion in her party is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc
in a sign of just how worried big business is getting siemens airbus and bmw have publicly cautioned britain in the past week that their businesses will be hurt by a disorderly brexit
when asked about business worries by ambassadors british foreign secretary boris johnson was reported by the daily telegraph newspaper to have quipped business
a spokesman disputed that he had used bad language
under the current timetable both london and brussels hope to get a final brexit deal in october to give enough time to ratify it by brexit day in march though few diplomats expect the deal to be struck until months later
the nature of the future relationship with the world s biggest trading bloc remains unclear and there is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade
that could be highly damaging for an industry which is dependent on the speedy movement of huge numbers of parts across borders
the average car for example has about parts
bmw s mini plant in oxford brings in five million components a day and the company is increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity around how it will be able to do that in future
the car manufacturer s uk boss ian robertson told reuters that if britain tumbled out of the eu without a deal on march there was no longer enough time to put in place the systems to ensure components could keep moving easily across borders
what we are asking for is negotiations to take place decisions to be made clarity to be achieved and then we can plan our business model accordingly robertson said on the sidelines of the smmt conference
bmw has quietly ramped up production capacity at a new export hub for the mini on continental europe with dutch contract manufacturer vdl nedcar thereby cutting its dependency on oxford
it quadrupled staffing in born the netherlands where the mini is also built and added the assembly of bmw s model to the dutch production line in august last year
more people now work at vdl nedcar than bmw employs at its plant in oxford
even a small increase in paperwork or customs checks after brexit for example could lead to spiraling costs for big manufacturers which depend on vast supply chains that stretch across europe and the globe
at stake is the future of one of britain s few manufacturing success stories since the a car industry employing over people and generating turnover of billion
much of the industry is owned by foreign companies
the world s biggest carmakers including toyota bmw and ford have urged britain to ensure that they can import and export without hindrance after brexit
one british manufacturer is mclaren automotive which produces about cars a year
its chief executive mike flewitt said the industry needed to know the shape of the new trading relationship in good time
the thing we plea for most is time is notice flewitt said
if we don t know what s coming then we just run into a brick pain supporters of brexit admit there may be some pain for britain s trillion economy but that it will prosper when cut free from the eu which they cast as a failing experiment in european integration
around percent of britain s total trillion trade in goods last year was with the eu so may wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible
smmt chief hawes said the british government s current position leaving the eu single market and the customs union would hurt the industry
the current position with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the uk automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership he said
