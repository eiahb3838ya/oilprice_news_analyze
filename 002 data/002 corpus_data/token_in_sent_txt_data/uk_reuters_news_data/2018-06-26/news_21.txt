bulgaria to build new link to turkey in hope of russian gas
russia laying turkstream under black sea to bypass ukraine bulgaria sees some russian gas going to new hub gazprom yet to decide on turkstream route beyond turkey
by tsvetelia tsolova and alissa de carbonnel june reuters bulgaria launched a tender on wednesday for a new gas link with turkey in a push to persuade russia to extend the second part of the turkstream pipeline to its border rather than greece
sofia has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy with moscow and istanbul in recent weeks to ensure it receives the gas russia plans to send to europe through its black sea pipeline bypassing ukraine to the south
bulgaria has also been building a business case
it has tapped market interest in a billion euro billion pipeline to take mainly russian gas via bulgaria to central and eastern europe
state gas firm bulgartransgaz has said five firms expressed an interest in shipping gas through bulgaria s network and sources said russian energy giant gazprom was interested in using most of the capacity
sofia is planning to seek firm commitments from companies by the end of
the moves have alarmed some in brussels
it has tentatively backed a plan to build a balkan gas hub in bulgaria s black sea port of varna to ensure any more russian gas coming into the eu would compete with gas from at least two other sources such as azerbaijan or liquefied natural gas lng shipped from greece
but eu officials fear sofia may opt to simply send the gas onto europe to earn transit fees rather than allowing it to be traded at new a gas hub cementing the small eu nation s near percent dependence on gazprom
europe s energy chief warned that any new pipeline infrastructure in bulgaria would come under very very close scrutiny to ensure it complies with eu rules
i understand that this transit pipeline looks like something which is much easier and simpler european commission vice president maros sefcovic told reuters
the most important thing is to have a choice to have options and to become the trader not a mere transit he said
bulgarian prime minister boyko borissov who visited russia and turkey recently has said russian president vladimir putin was ready to send russian gas to bulgaria if it could find a way of shipping it to the rest of europe and wins brussels nod
bulgaria is still smarting from the cancellation of russia s plan to bring gas to its shores with its south stream pipeline
the project which had promised the balkan country on the eu s periphery money and clout was dropped by russia after it blamed opposition from brussels
borissov has regretted that the huge steel pipes intended for south stream staked high at bulgaria s ports are now being used to build turkstream instead
borissov whose vision is still to turn bulgaria into bridge between east and west has also said he is in talks with brussels about having some russian gas traded and some sent through a transit network
two eu sources said they would have little power to stop bulgaria going ahead with a new transit pipeline project as long as it follows eu internal energy market rules
the eu sources worry such a pipeline for russian gas would be more attractive to the bloc s poorest member state promising more money sooner given that any gas hub is still considered a long way off
bulgaria has yet to fully implement eu energy rules and follow through with plans to open gas pipelines with neighbouring greece and serbia
after years of delays it has now built a gas interconnector with romania
it s like putting the cart before the horse
you can t have a hub in place by decree said katja yafimava senior research fellow at the oxford institute for energy studies
the over what route gazprom uses to supply some percent of the europe s gas needs is intensifying with its contract for gas transit through ukraine due to expire in
the planned nord stream pipeline to germany and turkstream are part of the kremlin s drive to reduce flows through ukraine
with moscow and kiev at loggerheads sofia fears gas supplies via ukraine could be cut and that it would lose about million euros million a year in transit fees
russian gas now flows from ukraine through romania to bulgaria
some billion cubic metres bcm is for bulgaria s use while bcm is shipped on to turkey
although bulgaria is carrying out a feasibility study for the balkan gas hub paid for in part by brussels and due later this year it is also getting ready to receive russian gas coming to the region via turkey
besides the million levs million tender to build a new km link to turkey launched on wednesday bulgaria also completed new gas infrastructure at the border this month
it has expanded its pipeline capacity to turkey and allowed for reverse gas flows from its southern neighbour once the two lines of turkstream with an annual capacity of billion cubic metres are completed
the tender for the new link runs until july but the contract will only become valid once a final decision has been made to link turkstream to bulgaria bulgartransgaz said
gazprom will decide by year s end whether to send gas on from turkey to europe via greece and italy or bulgaria a source close to the matter said
if bulgaria opts for transit then this would be the last nail in the coffin of ukrainian transit one eu source said
