exclusive-crews to abandon 2 venezuelan tankers stuck in portugal -operator
lisbon reuters the crew of venezuelan oil tanker the rio arauca that has been stuck in the middle of the river tagus in lisbon for nearly two years due to unpaid debt is set to be dismissed managers bernhard schulte shipmanagement bsm said on thursday
bsm also said in a statement sent to reuters another venezuelan tanker the parnaso which is in dry dock at the port of setubal south of lisbon will also have its crew removed later this week due to a lack of payment from owners pdv marina a subsidiary of venezuela s oil company pdvsa
lisbon s maritime court ruled to take possession of the parnaso last august
both vessels are under bsm management
pdvsa had no immediate comment on the issue
the amount owed by pdv marina to bsm globally is at least million according to a source at the company and a document seen by reuters
bsm said the rio arauca arrived in lisbon in may but has been inactive and unable to dock since then
bsm as the manager for rio arauca has operated a crew rotation maintaining sufficient manning levels aboard to ensure the vessel s safety and security while at anchor in the tagus for the past months bsm said adding that the vessel was securely at anchor
legal responsibility for the vessel now sits with the arresting parties it said
the port authorities in lisbon and setubal declined to comment on bsm s intention to remove the crews
lisbon s port authority apl said rio arauca had entered the port with a cargo of crude for the local oil firm galp energia but later portuguese navigation company navex declined to continue to be the tanker s agent
the tanker was then subject to successive arrest orders apl said
apl filed a petition against the ship owner pdv marina in april over accumulating monthly charges of euros
apl said pdv marina owed it a total of million euros as of the end of last year
in august another arrest order was issued by bunker fuel broker amoil
bsm said that amoil secured a maritime lien on the vessel claiming an unpaid debt by pdv marina
rio arauca arrived in lisbon with crew members but portugal s immigration and border service sef said only people still remained aboard
various tankers with venezuelan crude around the world have been arrested by authorities or otherwise prevented from leaving because pdvsa has not been able to pay for hull cleaning inspections and other port services
