update 1-czech pm outlines nuclear expansion with state control over construction
adds quotes background details by robert muller prague feb reuters czech prime minister andrej babis on thursday outlined the government s plan to build a number of nuclear reactors saying the state should control construction so it can halt the expansion should power prices fail to support the project
the government expects to sign a contract with majority cez to build one or more new reactors at dukovany with a tender towards the end of and a supplier chosen by
babis said the government would not provide cez an unlimited state guarantee and that the utility would cover any extra costs not generated by the state or foreign regulators
the basic aim of the state should be to take control of construction of new nuclear capacity babis told a nuclear conference
the state would get such control by signing a contract with cez on it is simpler and more favourable for customers than state guarantees which would in fact amount to a blank the government has been considering how to fund a expansion of cez s nuclear power plants before some units reach the end of their lifetime
cez has balked at starting a tender without receiving state guarantees but babis has said the company central europe s largest listed utility can handle the project itself
it is necessary to start the first stage immediately to get building permission at the dukovany site and to organise the tender babis said
the state will have an option to make appropriate decisions on whether to continue or stop the planned construction in case the resulting consumer electricity price is at an unacceptable some minority shareholders fear nuclear expansion through reactor construction would dent dividend payouts if cez were pushed to finance it on its own
the company could face shareholder lawsuits
but cez chief executive daniel benes told the conference the best model for the expansion had not yet been determined and that any plan must not harm minority investors
the contract has to be construed in a way not to harm the minority shareholders he said
in cez scrapped a previous plan to expand nuclear capacity after failing to receive state guarantees on power prices
this time firms from countries including russia china and the united states are set to vie for the project which marks the country s tender
the six potential bidders are china s cgn atmea a joint venture between mitsubishi heavy industries and edf group westinghouse south korea s kepco french areva and russia s rosatom
