shell, petrochina spat holds up australia's biggest coal seam gas project
feb reuters royal dutch shell and petrochina are at loggerheads over gas sales pricing at their arrow energy joint venture holding up development of australia s biggest coal seam gas resource three industry sources said
shell and petrochina acquired the surat gas resource in a a billion billion takeover of arrow in and had expected to reach a final investment decision in with first production around
that was after the arrow energy venture signed a deal in december to supply natural gas from surat to the queensland curtis lng plant qclng which is operated by shell
petrochina though is unhappy with the price in the sales agreement with qclng and the technical plan for developing the gas issues that are now holding up final approvals according to three industry sources familiar with the talks who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
petrochina as a stakeholder in arrow expects to maximise interests from the jv versus qclng
but for shell it may be thinking of using its operator role at qclng to protect its interests a chinese oil industry executive said
we are working hard to manage approvals with joint venture partners a shell spokeswoman said
petrochina did not respond to a request for comment
