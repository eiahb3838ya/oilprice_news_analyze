venezuela gets fuel from russia, europe but the bill soars
mexico reuters venezuela is paying heavy premiums for fuel imports from russia and europe with fewer than a dozen sellers seeing the risk as worth the reward after flows from the united states dried up because of sanctions trading sources said and data showed
the south american nation exports crude but its refineries are in poor condition hence the need to import gasoline and diesel for petrol stations and power plants as well as naphtha to dilute its heavy oil
since the united states imposed fresh sanctions on venezuela on products supplies have mainly come from russian state oil major rosneft spain s repsol india s reliance industries and trading houses vitol and trafigura according to sources and data
russia has been a traditional political backer of caracas while india and spain also have trade ties
but supplies even from those allies are coming at a cost
the prices they are charging us are horrifying said an executive at venezuelan oil firm pdvsa who is familiar with recent purchases
the executive said the heavy premiums were partially due to the fact that single cargoes passed through several hands before reaching venezuelan ports and also involved complex and expensive transfers
a trader involved in one fixture said shipowners were now charging a fee of up to cents per barrel to venezuela versus cents before sanctions
last year venezuela imported most products from the united states with the main providers being pdvsa s own subsidiary citgo petroleum and a unit of india s reliance
monthly supplies fluctuated but in december alone pdvsa imported almost barrels per day bpd of fuel as its domestic refineries worked at just below a third of its capacity according to pdvsa data
imports have fallen to some bpd of gasoline diesel naphtha and other fuels since the end of january refinitiv eikon data shows
in addition at least cargoes carrying million barrels of various fuels are heading to pdvsa s terminals or waiting in venezuelan waters to discharge according to shipping sources and eikon data
the new sanctions aimed at forcing out socialist president nicolas maduro bar oil dollars from flowing to venezuela
however the sanctions were later clarified allowing persons to purchase and engage in swaps and deals for petroleum and petroleum products with pdvsa until april in a move aimed at easing flows and averting a fuel crisis
but even though the clarification meant washington was still allowing fuel supplies to pdvsa sellers have been scarce so far
from russia vitol and trafigura are taking fuel from the ports of and taman to the caribbean island of aruba where pdvsa s unit citgo operates an oil terminal according to shipping sources and refinitiv eikon data
vitol is bringing tonnes of gasoil in the orient challenge vessel while trafigura chartered the elandra fjord to ship tonnes of gasoline produced by russian oil firm surgutneftegaz
rosneft is also lifting tonnes of naphtha in a transfer off cyprus refinitiv eikon data shows
reliance has booked the tanker albiani to ship naphtha from northwest europe
repsol chartered several gasoline cargoes as part of a swap deal for venezuelan crude with pdvsa sources said
pdvsa rosneft and reliance did not reply to requests for comment
surgutneftegaz declined to comment
vitol and repsol said they fully complied with all legislation and sanctions
we continue to closely monitor events on a basis a repsol spokesman said
trafigura declined to comment
the trading house will stop business with pdvsa after completing a small number of trades sources have said
pdvsa s president manuel quevedo traveled to india last week to secure larger sales of venezuelan oil to refiners as his country needs to divert up to bpd of crude once bought by customers
executives from rosneft have traveled to venezuela in recent weeks for talks industry sources said
rosneft is a major lender to pdvsa and oil projects in the country
some venezuelan petrol stations have been receiving insufficient fuel from pdvsa in recent weeks so scarcity of supply has worsened in regions including the south of the country and the andean states
venezuela has so far however avoided a fuel crisis
