funding for the new investments rose to billion euros billion pounds
even though percent more future capacity was invested in the amount spent on the investments was percent more than a year earlier a sign that costs continue to fall
cost reductions across the industry s value chain and increased industry competition have made it possible for investors to finance more capacity for less cash it said

however the report distinguishes between finance for future projects over the next few years and farms actually installed saying the amount of capacity newly installed last year fell
last year was the worst year for new wind energy installations since eu countries didn t install a single wind turbine last year said windeurope s chief executive giles dickson
in the european union member nations plus switzerland norway and turkey the amount of capacity added last year was gigawatts gw percent less than in due to poorly designed auctions and issues with permits the report said
in the eu bloc new wind installations fell to gw the lowest level since
investments in future capacity were quite good last year thanks to the uk spain sweden and thanks also to the further expansion of offshore wind dickson said

there are structural problems in permitting especially in germany and france
and with the notable exception of lithuania and despite improvements in poland there s a lack of ambition in central and eastern europe he added
in total gw of wind power capacity is now installed in europe percent higher than in
that accounts for percent of the eu s total installed power generation capacity
