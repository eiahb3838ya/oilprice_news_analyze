rising uk-china oil trade could soften blow of no-deal brexit
london reuters a rise in exports of british oil may soften the potential blow to the sale of uk crude to asia from a brexit export data showed and trade sources said offsetting likely lower shipments to south korea
while britain and the european union remain in talks over brexit tariffs and other terms governing britain s trade with most of the globe would be set under world trade organization rules under a departure from the eu
the flow of british crude to asia is significant for the global market as it can affect prices and is a popular trading play
oil companies have been worried a brexit could limit this arbitrage creating excess supply in europe
according to uk government and oil trading sources the flow of british crude to china would not face increased tariffs under a brexit
china has in recent months been purchasing more than south korea the other major asian buyer of uk oil
leaving without a deal wouldn t impact the tariffs we face from china a uk government source said since britain already trades with china under wto rules
this would go some way to leaving the arbitrage in asia open for forties the most popular british crude grade among asian buyers
with the way forward still unclear the uk s department for international trade said the government recommended planning for all brexit outcomes including no deal
our priority is to avoid disruption to our global trading relationships as we leave the european union and we are seeking continuity for existing free trade agreements the department said in a statement
a trader with an oil company dealing in forties said china would remain a viable outlet under a brexit
yes i think it would he said
but i suppose looking at the overall picture you would have fewer options for your flows to south korea may decline he said since the uk would drop out of a agreement fta the eu has with that country
with the fta south korea became a big buyer of forties a trade that has helped support the grade s value
such shipments also affect global prices as forties is part of the brent benchmark used for oil deals
as a result trading plays hinging on sending uk crude via tanker to the east or appearing to do so have become a popular feature of the market
oil companies that trade forties are concerned its value could drop if south korea imposes a customs tariff that matches levels should the uk leave the eu with no deal or without a separate trade agreement with seoul
we worried about the impact it would have on forties if the obvious arbitrage was not there any more a second north sea trading source said
this would lower the value as there will be too much crude in the north sea that needs to find a still china has increasingly been providing that home buying between million and million barrels of forties a month since october according to refinitiv eikon data
the economics of the trade hinge on a number of factors such as freight rates and the competitiveness of a crude such as forties against a more local crude grade based on the dubai benchmark
clearly the uk has found a ready market for this type of crude in china kpler which researches oil trade patterns said in a report
the flow of forties into china is particularly interesting given the unusually long distance and shipment editing by dale hudson
