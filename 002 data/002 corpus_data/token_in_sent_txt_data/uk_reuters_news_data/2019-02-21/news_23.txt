update 2-mexico president says no more pemex 'farm-out' joint ventures for now
mexico city reuters president andres manuel lopez obrador said on thursday mexico will not offer more oil joint ventures between private companies and state energy company pemex indefinitely raising doubts about auctions set for october
in reply to a question about the contracts known in the industry as lopez obrador said the country would not offer more until existing projects began producing oil
credit ratings agency fitch downgraded pemex in january citing precarious finances and a collapse in oil output
lopez obrador is betting on raising oil production through service contracts mainly with mexican companies to squeeze more oil from existing shallow water and onshore fields
he has long been a critic of his predecessor s liberalization of the energy industry which allowed private and foreign companies to bid for oil exploration and production both alone and in association with pemex
lopez obrador who is from state tabasco has previously said he will give companies three years to start producing before he decides whether to allow more auctions
he has not been clear whether this also applies to pemex joint ventures
in december a few days after lopez obrador took office the national hydrocarbons commission canceled two auctions for private energy companies set for february
but it chose to delay until rather than cancel a round of auctions
