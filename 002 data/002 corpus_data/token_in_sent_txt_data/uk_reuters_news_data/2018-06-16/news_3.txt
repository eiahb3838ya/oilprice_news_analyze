factbox-who is fighting in yemen's messy civil war?
beirut june reuters each of the parties to yemen s messy civil war has its own agenda making the conflict harder to resolve
this factbox looks at some of these groups and what they want
in the late the houthi family in far north yemen set up a religious revival movement for the zaydi sect of shi ite islam which had once ruled yemen but whose northern heartland had been marginalised
as friction with the government grew they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with saudi arabia
they built ties with iran but it is not clear how deep that relationship goes
since seizing the capital sanaa in the houthis have relied on parts of the existing bureaucracy to govern and their strategy is unclear
ali abdullah saleh took power in north yemen in and after unification with the south in he stayed on as president
he joined with tribal power brokers to dominate the country placing his clansmen in key positions in the army and economy prompting accusations of massive corruption
when former allies deserted him during the arab spring forcing him from power saleh disrupted the political transition and joined with his erstwhile foes the houthis helping them seize sanaa
despite their differences they ruled much of yemen together until last year
then saleh saw a chance to regain power for his family by turning on the houthis but was killed trying to flee
when saleh switched sides so did some commanders and troops loyal to him
they are now fighting against their former houthi allies under the late president s son ahmed an army general with ties to the uae
a general in south yemen before unification hadi sided with saleh during the brief civil war
after defeating the separatists saleh made hadi vice president
when saleh was forced from power hadi was elected to a term in to oversee a transition to democracy with a new constitution and new elections scheduled for
but his government was constantly undermined by saleh faced a renewed southern separatist movement houthi rebellion and many bombing attacks by al qaeda
the houthis rejected the new constitution and elections were shelved
after the houthis took sanaa hadi fled and then went into exile in saudi arabia
he lacks any power base of his own and is widely seen as weak
but the arab coalition s military intervention is based on upholding the legitimacy of his internationally recognised government and the political transition vested in it
after independence from britain south yemen became the only communist country in the middle east but it suffered constant infighting
weakened by that and the collapse of the soviet union it unified with saleh s north yemen in
as it became clear most power was in northern hands the old southern leadership tried to secede in but was swiftly beaten by saleh s army which sacked aden
many southerners have complained of increasing economic and political marginalisation
the southern separatist movement has remained internally divided but it is a powerful force across the old south yemen and has provided many of the fighters against the houthis
set up by members of the global jihadist group who had escaped prison in yemen and their comrades who fled saudi arabia last decade al qaeda in the arabian peninsula became one of its most powerful branches
it took advantage of arab spring chaos to create mini states in remote eastern regions and launched numerous bloody attacks that undermined hadi s transitional government
during the civil war it has carried out attacks against both sides
any prolonged chaos in yemen will give it more room to consolidate and plot attacks abroad
saudi arabia regards the houthis as a proxy for iran its greatest regional rival and it wants to stop tehran gaining sway in its neighbour
its other war aims are to end houthi missile strikes and shelling to the transition process it backed in and to prevent chaos in yemen that would let aqap plot attacks on the kingdom
saudi arabia s air force has been particularly involved in yemen but the kingdom has also provided a for hadi and assisted the ground fighting in northern yemen
the uae which also backed the transition plan is the other main participant in the coalition
it wants to prevent islamist militancy growing in yemen and regards the country s ports as strategically important
it has focused on the war in southern yemen and the red sea coast
the other countries in the coalition have been less closely involved though sudan has put some troops on the ground
iran champions the houthis as part of its regional axis of resistance and the movement has adopted elements of tehran s revolutionary ideology
but while saudi arabia and its allies accuse iran of arming and training the houthis the extent of the relationship is disputed and tehran has denied funnelling weapons into yemen
