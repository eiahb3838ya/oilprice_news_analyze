opec unlikely to agree official output increase in algeria, but pressure mounts
dubai reuters opec and its allies are unlikely to agree an official increase in crude output when they meet in algeria this weekend although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new sanctions on iran opec sources said
opec kingpin saudi arabia is worried that any spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from president donald trump but is concerned about a lack of spare oil capacity to offset shortages the sources said
the kingdom is caught between a rock and a hard place seeking to prevent prices from rising far above a barrel ahead of congressional elections while fending off doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in iranian supply
it s complicated
saudi arabia has to balance oil supply and demand and it has to balance oil prices so they don t rise too much before the elections one opec source said
it s also political because the saudis don t want to pump too much oil then the iranians complain to opec that it saudi arabia is taking iran s market share
they also don t want oil prices to fall too trump took aim at opec on thursday writing on twitter we protect the countries of the middle east they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices
we will remember
the opec monopoly must get prices down now under pressure from the president the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and other allies agreed in june to boost production by million barrels per day having participated in a deal since
the coalition meets on sunday in algeria to discuss how to allocate that million bpd increase within its quota framework
opec sources say there is no immediate plan for any official action as such a move would require opec to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting which is not on the table
the weekend gathering will discuss how to share the previously agreed output increase and examine whether the market needs more oil to offset the loss of iranian supply as well as a decline in venezuelan output the sources said
two sources said the meeting could produce a recommendation on dividing the increase as most participating countries would be represented
there are no proposals for an extraordinary meeting in algeria another opec source said
the source added that the joint opec and ministerial committee known as the jmmc which meets in algiers on sunday can still recommend to the wider coalition a further increase in output if needed
a separate opec source said to make a decision you need to have all the ministers
not all ministers are attending but most delegations will be sanctions on iran s oil exports come into force in november with supply from the country already at lows
falling venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere will also keep the balance tight
fears over supply shortages have boosted crude prices in recent weeks and international benchmark brent was trading above a barrel on thursday
washington wants to cut iranian oil exports to zero by november and is pushing saudi arabia other opec members and russia to pump more to meet the shortfall
opec and industry sources told reuters that chinese indian and other asian refiners had been asking middle eastern producers such as saudi arabia iraq the united arab emirates and kuwait for more cargoes
while some producers face supply restrictions due to infrastructure constraints or a desire not to be seen as flooding the market others are quietly boosting exports to asia the sources said
though opec production has increased since july saudi arabia has added less crude than it initially indicated
saudi officials believe there is insufficient oil demand so far to justify raising saudi output much beyond the roughly bpd that it has pumped above its million bpd target opec and industry sources told reuters
but that has raised some doubt over whether riyadh can quickly boost output to what the kingdom says is its maximum sustainable capacity of million bpd the sources said
though saudi arabia has never tested such high levels it has said it pumped million bpd in the past
industry sources familiar with saudi oil plans say state energy giant aramco can raise output quickly to million bpd but reaching million bpd could take up to six months
spare capacity refers to a producer s ability to ramp up production in a relatively short time
much of it is located in the middle east
opec mohammad barkindo meanwhile warned this week of underinvestment in the global oil industry
we have seen a contraction in the level of investments in the last couple of years in response to the impact of the downturn barkindo told reuters tv in an interview referring to a drop in oil prices that started in
it is our hope that with the gradual return of confidence in the market we will be able to see a higher level of investment in the industry that will ensure that at any given time a certain level of spare capacity will serve us as a buffer against reporting by rania el gamal additional reporting by alex lawler in london editing by dale hudson
