rpt-exclusive-russian oil firm seeks dollar alternative amid us sanctions threat-traders
repeats wednesday s story with no changes to text surgutneftegaz is russia s fourth biggest oil firm by output wants buyers to agree to use euros if some traders link push to threat of more sanctions company relies on contracts and so more vulnerable by gleb gorodyankin and olga yagova moscow sept reuters russian oil producer surgutneftegaz is pushing buyers to agree to pay for oil in euros instead of dollars if the need arises apparently as insurance against possible tougher sanctions traders who deal with the firm told reuters
russia has been subject to western sanctions since its annexation of ukraine s crimea region but washington has threatened to impose extra sanctions citing what it has called moscow s malign activities abroad
the prospect that causes most alarm for russian firms is inclusion on a treasury department blacklist that effectively cuts them off from conducting transactions in dollars the lifeblood of the global oil industry
surgutneftegaz whose chief executive vladimir bogdanov is already on a blacklist in a personal capacity declined to respond to reuters questions
we do not comment on our commercial activity said the company russia s fourth largest by output
to date russia s oil industry has been able to weather western sanctions
in response to restricted access to western finance and technology firms have switched to borrowing from russian state banks and developed their own technology
most russian oil majors including rosneft and lukoil also sell the lion s share of output via contracts with clients giving them more time to work out alternative forms of payment when the contracts expire
but most of surgutneftegaz s exports around million tonnes per month is sold through monthly tenders on the spot market the largest volumes by far among its russian peers
so it would have only around days to find alternative payment methods
six traders who regularly deal with surgutneftegaz said the company had been asking buyers to agree to an addendum to their contracts stating that they accept the option of settling payments in euros
according to a message sent by surgutneftegaz to one of its customers asking them to sign the addendum the oil company cited the need to avoid any possible problems with payment in reuters has seen a copy of the message
three of the traders said surgutneftegaz had already begun discussions with its partners last summer about the possibility of settling payments in euros
but the company was now raising the issue with greater urgency and had in some cases warned it would reject bids from buyers for cargoes of oil unless the buyers signed the addendum according to four of the traders
in its message to customers surgutneftegaz did not mention the risk of new sanctions but two traders said from their interactions with the company it was clear to them that this was the reason behind the change
surgut is afraid of sanctions a source in a european oil major which has dealings with surgutneftegaz told reuters on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media
the government can not forbid anyone from using dollars but it can prevent banks from doing business with a sanctioned entity
most transactions pass through the banking system and those banks to avoid violating sanctions can refuse to handle money linked to blacklisted companies or individuals
it is not clear how widely the russian oil sector is preparing for the possibility of tougher sanctions
a source at gazpromneft russia s oil company by output said most of its contracts already contained a clause on possible payments in currencies
a second source at the company said that when it is drafting supply contracts with customers for it will make sure they include a payment option in all cases
gazpromneft was not immediately avilable to comment
several other oil firms also already have clauses in their contracts allowing payments under some circumstances said four industry sources
washington s decision in april to include on its sanctions blacklist russian firm rusal one of the world s biggest aluminium producers signalled to russian business that washington was ratcheting up the pressure
it was the first time a major russian company with international partners had been blacklisted
some elements of the sanctions have been temporarily watered down but rusal s inclusion has disrupted its access to raw materials led to the cancellation of some orders and prompted some foreign partners to sever ties
washington has not spelled out when or how it plans to toughen sanctions further but it has signalled that they are coming this year partly in response to the poisoning in britain of former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter
britain and its western allies say russian intelligence agents carried out the poisoning using a nerve agent an allegation moscow has denied
state department official manisha singh said this month there would be a very severe second round of sanctions unless russia meets a november deadline to comply with international chemical weapons law
the source in the european oil major said surgutneftegaz in its push to arrange the option of payments in euros was focussed on what might happen in november
there is no indication from washington if surgutneftegaz would be a target for the next round of sanctions
but ceo bogdanov was included on the treasury department list published in january of russian oligarchs with a net worth of billion or more
in april the treasury department added bogdanov to its specially designated national list freezing any assets he owns and barring him from travel to the united states
it said he was being blacklisted for operating in the energy sector of the russian federation reporting by gleb gorodyankin and olga yagova writing by vladimir soldatkin editing by mike
