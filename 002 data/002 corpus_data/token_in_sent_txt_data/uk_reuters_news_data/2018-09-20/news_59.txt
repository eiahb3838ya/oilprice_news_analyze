bangladesh puts aside gunvor, vitol lng projects as others ramp up
gunvor vitol trafigura eye global lng market bangladesh seeks gas imports as domestic supply slides lng officials says smaller lng projects costlier by ruma paul and sabina zawadzki sept reuters bangladesh has put aside two smaller liquefied natural gas lng projects with trading houses gunvor and vitol to focus on two larger lng import terminals one of which is already in use while the second will start up in march
bangladesh has turned to lng to offset falling domestic gas output to feed industrial demand and electricity generation in a nation of million people where a third have no power supply
it aims to import million tonnes a year of lng by which in today s terms would make it a top five importer
this attracted commodity merchants vitol gunvor and trafigura in their bid to muscle in on the global lng business
bangladesh began importing lng on a regular basis this month after the arrival of a floating storage and regasification unit fsru in april in moheshkhali port by cox s bazar
a second fsru project operated by summit corp with japan s mitsubishi corp as partner will start operations in march and double the country s import capacity to million tonnes a year
bangladesh had also touted several smaller projects drawing interest from vitol gunvor and trafigura as well as energy giants like exxon mobil
it is now changing tack
these small projects are not a priority anymore said mohammad quamruzzaman managing director of the rupantarita prakritik gas co the unit in charge of lng imports at oil firm petrobangla
these are costlier than the bigger ones
why should we go for the costlier option when there is no urgency right now
one fsru has started operations and another is expected to be commissioned by march he told reuters
trafigura and gunvor had vied for smaller lng projects close to chittagong an industrial region north of cox s bazar
bangladesh said in may it had terminated talks with trafigura
vitol was chosen above exxon to develop a small fsru by the ageing sangu gas platform in the bay of bengal
vitol said on thursday it had no comment when asked about lng plans in bangladesh
gunvor appeared to have progressed the farthest with its plan to import lng for a fertiliser complex
belgian shipping firm exmar said in may that gunvor had chartered its small fsru for years
when asked about the gunvor project quamruzzaman said its chances were very slim although he said all the lng projects could be revived at anytime
a gunvor spokesman said our project has not been exmar said this month the fsru was at a shipyard being modified
a senior petrobangla official said the terms for the gunvor deal was for lng priced at percent of brent crude plus a fixed per million british thermal units mmbtu and an additional per mmbtu as infrastructure cost
when brent crude prices are at a barrel that translates to per mmbtu and at a barrel it is per mmbtu compared to per mmbtu for october delivery on the spot market last week
the deal with the trader gunvor was almost finalised but it got delayed the senior official said
now the big fsru came online and we doubt this the gunvor deal will additional reporting by julia payne editing by edmund blair
