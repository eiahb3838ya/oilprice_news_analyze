diesel demand to grow up to pct this year higher industrial output truck sales mining boost diesel use but diesel demand increase likely temporary researcher by jessica jaganathan and meng meng sept reuters china s diesel demand will grow at its fastest in at least five years as a in sectors in the world s economy coincides with lower output from domestic refineries several sources and analysts said
estimates of the hike in diesel use from three analysts and two oil industry sources range from to percent for compared with last year s stagnant growth pointing towards a recovery for the industrial and transport fuel
diesel accounts for about percent of china s appetite for petroleum products and is typically used to fuel trucks as well as mining and construction equipment
the slight in chinese demand helped to boost asian diesel margins to their highest in more than three years earlier this month
our outlook for chinese diesel demand remains positive with consumption set to remain supported over the coming years with positive trends in key sectors such as construction manufacturing freight and mining said richard taylor oil and gas analyst at fitch solutions
this year s diesel growth will be the fastest since said energy aspects analyst nevyn nah
the demand increase is likely temporary however said the research unit of china national petroleum corp cnpc with economic growth moderating and tighter environmental scrutiny from beijing
china s diesel demand will stay around peak levels until
after that consumption will slowly go down said wang lining researcher from cnpc research institute of economic and technology
we noticed the recent pickup in infrastructure investment which led to a temporary boom in diesel consumption wang said
besides increased demand from industry and mining the lifting of an annual fishing ban of up to four months in certain areas this year has created demand for diesel the industry sources said speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media
higher industrial output ahead of the golden week holiday in early october also boosted demand the sources said
industrial output in china rose percent in august from a year earlier the national bureau of statistics nbs said last week a tick higher than in july
medium and heavy truck sales were up percent in the first eight months from a year ago as car producers sold million trucks in the period data from china association of automobile manufacturing also showed
also tightening tax rules implemented in march have led to a cut in imports of blending stocks such as light cycle oil lco stoking demand for diesel in the domestic market instead two of the sources said
premiums for lco exported from south korea this year have at least halved to to a tonne since last year indicating a drop in demand from its main customers in china one of the sources said
led by a spike in benchmark crude prices wholesale diesel prices in china have jumped percent from the start of the year to yuan per tonne the highest in four years according to consultancy jlc
in comparison the price of diesel loading in singapore is just over about yuan a tonne reuters data showed
the disparity in prices also led to a recent rare import of diesel cargo into china and has boosted margins and diesel appetite among fuel sellers the sources said
diesel margins were also lifted because of lower diesel output due to prolonged maintenance by independent chinese refiners amid higher oil prices and a shift towards cleaner diesel in the marine sector
