trump has called on saudi arabia opec s largest producer to raise output saying that it should help the united states lower fuel prices since washington is aiding riyadh in its struggle against iran
opec and its allies are unlikely to agree to an official increase in crude output when they meet in algeria this weekend although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new sanctions on iran opec sources told reuters on thursday
the new sanctions take effect in november as a result of with trump s decision to pull out of a agreement on iran s nuclear program
saudi arabia is worried that any spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from trump but it also faces doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in iranian supply the sources said
in a visit to moscow this month energy secretary rick perry said saudi arabia the united states and russia can between them raise global output in the next months to compensate for falling oil supplies from iran
