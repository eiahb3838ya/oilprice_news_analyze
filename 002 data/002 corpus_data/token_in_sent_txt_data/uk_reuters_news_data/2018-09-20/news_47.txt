update 2-italian judge jails two in nigerian oil graft case
case revolves around nigerian opl field sentence comes ahead of main trial involving shell eni next hearing in main trial on recasts adds shell and eni comments campaigner by emilio parodi milan sept reuters an italian judge sentenced two defendants in a nigerian corruption case to jail on thursday in the first ruling on one of the oil industry s biggest graft scandals
nigerian emeka obi and italian gianluca di nardo were found guilty of international corruption and each given jail sentences three sources with knowledge of the ruling said
lawyers for obi and di nardo declined to comment
the case revolves around the purchase by italian oil company eni and peer royal dutch shell of nigeria s opl offshore oilfield for about billion
milan prosecutors allege bribes totaling around billion were paid to win the licence to explore the field which because of disputes has never entered into production
the main trial which besides eni and shell also involves eni ceo claudio descalzi and four managers including former shell foundation chairman malcolm brinded is expected to drag on for months
but obi and di nardo accused of being middlemen and taking illegal kickbacks had asked for a separate trial which under italian law allows sentences to be cut by a third
thursday s ruling will not tie the court s hand in the main trial
but barnaby pace campaigner at global witness said this judgment will send shivers down the corporate spines of the oil in an emailed statement a spokeswoman for shell said neither obi nor di nardo worked on behalf of the company adding it was waiting to see the judge s written decision

shell is the biggest foreign investor in the country producing barrels of oil equivalent per day in

prosecutors had alleged obi received a mandate from former nigerian oil minister dan etete to find a buyer for opl collecting million
di nardo they said took million of that amount for putting obi in touch with eni
