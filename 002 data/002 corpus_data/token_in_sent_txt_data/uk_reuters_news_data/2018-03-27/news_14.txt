macron lawmaker seeks parliamentary inquiry over arms sales to saudi-led coalition
paris reuters a lawmaker in president emmanuel macron s party is asking for a parliamentary investigation into the legality of french weapons sales to a coalition over concerns the arms are being used to kill civilians in yemen
pressure has been mounting on macron to scale back military support for saudi arabia and the united arab emirates which are leading the coalition fighting the houthi group that controls most of northern yemen and the capital sanaa
the conflict has killed more than people and displaced more than three million
i am submitting a request for a commission of inquiry knowing that france ratified the arms trade treaty sebastien nadot a lawmaker elected last year as part of hundreds of new parliamentarians that form macron s majority told reuters on tuesday
on the question of french weapons being used against civilian populations in yemen i want to know if france is respecting its international it remains to be seen whether nadot will get the necessary backing from other lawmakers to set up the inquiry committee
the move by nadot is surprising in that macron has faced little opposition in parliament since coming to power last year and commands an overwhelming majority with few of his lawmakers willing to question the executive s decisions
unlike many of its allies french export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances
they are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign defence and economy ministries
details of licences are not public and once approved are rarely reviewed
parliament must be able to control whether these weapons are sold in respect of international law nadot said
if we are just a transmission belt and not a body of control and evaluation then abstention in elections has a bright future ahead of percent of french people want macron to suspend arms exports to saudi arabia and the uae a yougov poll showed on monday
several rights groups have warned of possible legal action if the government does not halt its sales
france is the world s third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers
while some european countries notably germany have curtailed ties with the military coalition france britain and the united states have not followed suit
