nissan spins up new plant to give second life to ev batteries
namie japan reuters at a small plant intended to help revitalize a town ravaged by the earthquake nissan motor co is giving its costly electric vehicle ev batteries new life after they pass their peak performance
global automakers are looking for ways to make cheaper evs and prolong the life of their batteries which can account for up to of each vehicle s cost and are made from increasingly costly materials including cobalt and nickel
starting in may energy corporation a joint venture between the nissan and sumitomo corp will begin selling rebuilt replacement batteries for the leaf
the batteries will be produced at the new factory in namie by reassembling modules removed from batteries whose overall energy capacity has fallen below percent
they will be sold in japan for yen roughly half the price of replacement batteries for the world s first and best selling ev
by reusing spent ev batteries we wanted to raise the residual value of evs and make them more accessible said eiji makino ceo of which on monday opened the plant in namie fukushima prefecture around kilometers north of the site of the fukushima nuclear disaster the world s worst since chernobyl in
the flat rectangular battery packs that line the bottom of each leaf chassis are trucked into the plant where each module is assessed
sumitomo has come up with a way to analyze all modules contained in each battery pack in four hours a huge time savings from the days nissan engineers previously used for similar measurements
modules with capacities above percent are assigned for use in replacement leaf batteries lesser modules are reassembled and sold as batteries for fork lifts golf carts and applications such as streetlamps
the plant can process battery packs a year and initially plans to refabricate a few hundred units annually makino said adding that would see whether the process could also be used for batteries from the latest leaf model which uses a different battery chemistry
bracing for a sharp increase in the price of key ev battery materials including cobalt nickel and lithium more automakers are focusing on reuse and recycling with toyota motor corporation announcing in january it would partner with a japanese electric power company to explore such options
makino said it would be difficult for to completely break down and recycle ev batteries on its own but may consider partnering with another company to retrieve reusable materials a process industry experts say is key to sustainable ev battery production
second use is potentially a really great option but at the end of it all batteries still need to be recycled said jeff spangenberger energy systems researcher at the argonne national laboratory adding that the profitability of battery recycling operations would depend on the highly volatile price of component materials
