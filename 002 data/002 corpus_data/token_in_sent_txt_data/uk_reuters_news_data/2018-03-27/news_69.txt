vedanta to shut copper smelter in india for about 15 days
reuters vedanta resources plc said on tuesday its india unit vedanta ltd s copper smelting operations at thootukudi in the southern state of tamil nadu will be closed for about days as part of a maintenance shutdown
the news of the maintenance activity which vedanta said was earlier scheduled for april comes amid local media reports that thousands had taken to the streets and shut shops in thootukudi to protest against the expansion of the smelter
the refining and copper rod manufacturing operations would continue as usual at the smelter vedanta said in a statement
the company did not return calls from reuters seeking further comment
the copper smelter run by vedanta s sterlite copper unit is one of the india s biggest and has been a target of protesters who call it a major source of pollution and a risk to fisheries
the plant was shut for more than two months in after residents complained about emissions
an environmental court later ruled the smelter could operate but should take extra steps to prevent pollution
