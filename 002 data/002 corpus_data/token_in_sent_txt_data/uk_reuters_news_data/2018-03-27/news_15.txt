update 1-british vw drivers start "dieselgate" claim in high court
london reuters lawyers for more than british car owners kicked off a lawsuit against volkswagen in london s high court on tuesday in a battle for compensation over a diesel emissions scandal that has engulfed europe s largest carmaker since
the hearing will determine whether the claims can be managed collectively under a group litigation order glo and will set a deadline for claimants to sign up to what lawyers say could become the largest group action in british legal history
volkswagen has said about million cars worldwide and million in the uk were fitted with software that cheated diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide pollution
vw agreed to pay up to billion in the united states to settle claims from owners environmental regulators states and dealers
it offered to buy back polluting vehicles
the company has not reached a similar deal in europe where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis of its history dubbed dieselgate
law firm slater and gordon which says it represents more than claimants in britain alleges vw deceived people into buying cars that breached emissions regulations by installing defeat devices engine management software designed to mask pollution levels
the german company dismissed the allegations and said it intended to defend itself robustly
it said it had broken no english laws that british drivers had suffered no loss and that the legal proceedings were premature and unfounded
we are confident of a successful outcome the firm said in a statement
it said it had not been established that the software was an illegal defeat device and emphasised that the situation was materially different
the vehicles are different the regulatory environment is different and the technical measures are different
the affected vehicles in the uk do not cause more pollution on the road than expected it said
volkswagen has offered european drivers a software update removing a mode that operated when cars were experiencing test conditions
slater and gordon one of at least three law firms acting for affected vw audi seat and skoda drivers in england and wales alleged that the software fix had led to mechanical problems
it said it had surveyed more than affected car owners who had agreed to the vw fix
some reported that cars lost power at high speed had poorer fuel efficiency and engine power and that cars had juddered it said
vw said the survey s methodology had not been explained and that it was in the financial interest of respondents to allege they had suffered damage
we have implemented the technical measures in over vehicles in the uk and in over million vehicles across europe and the overwhelming majority of customers with these vehicles are satisfied it said
lawyers say that if the case was not settled it might not come to trial before
