bmw faces u.s. class action lawsuit over emissions
frankfurt march reuters german carmaker bmw faces a lawsuit filed in a new jersey court on tuesday for alleged emissions cheating on diesel vehicles including its and models
bmw s representations were misleading for failure to disclose its emissions manipulations the suit which was filed in the united states district court of new jersey said
the suit was filed by law firms steve w berman from hagens berman sobol shapiro llp and james cecchi from carella byrne cecchi olstein brody agnello the filings show
bmw s model built between and and the model which was sold between emit levels of nitrogen oxide many times higher than their gasoline counterparts the suit alleges
the vehicles promised power fuel economy and efficiency are obtained only by turning off or turning down emission controls when the software in these vehicles senses that they are not in an emissions testing environment the suit said
bmw was not immediately available for comment but has said in the past it did not use illegal defeat devices
software management programmes to manage emissions are not illegal unless they are designed specifically to evade pollution tests or unless a carmaker fails to disclose their existence
shares in bmw reduced gains sharply earlier on tuesday with traders pointing to a bloomberg report saying the german carmaker was being sued for installing defeat devices in diesel cars
