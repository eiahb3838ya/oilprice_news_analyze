exclusive-traders back local firms to buy petrobras' nigerian oilfield stakes
london reuters global oil traders vitol and glencore are in talks to financially back nigerian firms racing to buy assets owned by brazil s petrobras valued at up to billion billion pounds several sources familiar with the matter said
cash is being lined up for purchases of stakes in two major oilfields in the west african country according to the banking and industry sources
the potential consortiums including glencore and vitol offer the local bidders financial backing that would otherwise be hard to secure directly through international banks
for the traders a deal would guarantee access to crude oil for many years
they would then be able to syndicate out the debt to banks
signing up to financing deals to increase volumes and gain exclusive access is one of the traders strategies to compensate for increasingly thin profit margins
last november petroleo brasileiro sa known as petrobras launched the sale of percent of petrobras oil gas bv or petrobras africa as part of the company s plan to offload billion in assets through as it also faces a massive corruption scandal
petrobras holds half the shares in the company while percent are held by a subsidiary of grupo btg pactual sa and percent by helios investment partners
scotiabank is running the process with evercore according to the sale launch document
the venture has stakes in two offshore blocks that contain two producing fields the major agbami field in oml operated by a local chevron affiliate and the akpo field in oml operated by total sa
the assets could fetch as much as billion according to bankers involved in the process
trading and mining giant glencore was looking to back nigerian producer seplat in bidding for the assets
the world s top oil trader vitol is examining backing several bidders in the process according to the sources
commodities trader mercuria was involved in the initial bidding round but was unlikely to continue in the process sources said
oil major bp s trading division had also considered participating in a possible consortium but dropped out
glencore vitol mercuria and bp declined to comment
a spokesman for seplat did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the result of the auction is expected to be announced in early may but some participants said the assets might not be sold in one package
industry sources in nigeria said the winner of the petrobras blocks would likely be a local company due in part to government pressure
while the government already has local content laws a sale so close to the presidential elections in early has raised pressure to secure local involvement in the upstream sector
this has made it more difficult the sources said for international companies to bid for the assets without a local partner
the akpo field produces nearly barrels per day bpd of condensate and total is also due to start production at the egina development in oml later this year
the agbami oilfield is the main prize however producing about bpd of light sweet crude
petrobras holds a percent stake in the field statoil has percent and chevron holds a percent stake
the operator is a chevron affiliate called star deep water petroleum famfa oil is one of the concessionaires of star deep water petroleum and was also looking to increase its stake in the oilfield
