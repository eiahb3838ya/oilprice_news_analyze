china meets 2020 carbon target ahead of schedule - xinhua
shanghai reuters china met its carbon intensity target three years ahead of schedule last year the official xinhua news agency reported on tuesday citing the country s top climate official xie zhenhua
china the world s biggest energy consumer cut its carbon intensity level or the amount of carbon dioxide it produces per unit of economic growth by percent in xie told a forum in shanghai on tuesday
carbon intensity fell percent in compared to the previous year xinhua said suggesting that china s war on pollution also helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions
china originally promised to cut its carbon intensity by percent to percent
the pledge first made in was included in the country s commitments to the international community ahead of negotiations for a new global climate pact in paris in
however china struggled to honor another promise to establish a nationwide emissions cap and trade system by with the scheme delayed by technical problems including the reliability of emissions data
the country eventually settled for a scheme involving only the power sector which was launched in december last year
in his speech xie said the national market though only at an embryonic stage already covers about power firms with total carbon dioxide emissions in excess of billion tonnes making it the world s biggest
he said china would continue to work to expand coverage to other industries
but the issue has been complicated by the decision made at this year s full session of parliament to transfer responsibility for climate change and carbon emissions to an expanded ministry of ecology and environment
it was previously under the remit of the state planning agency the national development and reform commission ndrc
xie was formerly of the ndrc and is now a special envoy with the ministry of foreign affairs
it is a daunting task to launch china s national carbon trading market said peter corne managing partner at the legal firm dorsey whitney in shanghai who follows china s environmental policies
it is questionable whether in the short term the new ministry can be elevated in status and power to the extent that it will be able quickly to assume the influential role that the ndrc occupied in the area of climate change he added
