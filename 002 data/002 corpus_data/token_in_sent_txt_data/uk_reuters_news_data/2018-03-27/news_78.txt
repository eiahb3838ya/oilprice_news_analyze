update 1-japan's shikoku electric to scrap 1 nuclear reactor
adds graphic tokyo march reuters japan s shikoku electric power co inc said on tuesday it will decommission an ageing reactor at its ikata nuclear plant as the country s power industry struggles to meet new nuclear safety standards set after the fukushima disaster
the announcement brings to the number of reactors being scrapped since the meltdowns at the fukushima daiichi plant more than seven years ago
the move comes as japan s return to nuclear power is slowly gathering pace although the industry still faces public opposition court challenges and unfavourable economics
shikoku electric will scrap the no
reactor at the ikata plant about km miles west of tokyo
the reactor began operations in with a capacity of megawatts but has been shut since
the decision took into account factors including the cost of reinforcing work to meet new safety standards and the need to extend the reactor s operations after a standard operating life of years the company said in a statement
shikoku electric earlier decided to scrap the reactor at ikata while a japanese court in december ordered the utility not to restart the reactor overturning a lower court decision
the reactor has been idled for maintenance since october after resuming operations in
just five reactors are currently operating out of commercially viable units
all reactors in japan had to be relicensed following the fukushima disaster which highlighted shortcomings in regulation
