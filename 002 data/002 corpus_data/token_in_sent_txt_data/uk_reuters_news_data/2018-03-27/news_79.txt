diesel consumption growth in calendar may be more than double last year analysts and traders told reuters aided by an expected regular monsoon this year that should boost demand in the world s oil consumer for diesel used in harvesting and other farming leading to higher rural spending
barring extreme events and expecting a continuation in good gdp gross domestic product growth accompanied by an average monsoon india s diesel consumption should be up to about million tonnes towards the end of the year said sukrit vijayakar director of consultancy trifecta energy
strong growth would end two choppy years which saw consumption dented by a surprise demonetization programme launched by india s government that crimped public spending after the most commonly used bank notes were removed from circulation at virtually no notice
india s average monthly diesel consumption was about million tonnes or about million barrels per day bpd in
that was up about percent from when average monthly consumption was million tonnes

eying the elections modi is budgeting trillion rupees billion on rural infrastructure in the business year
indians will also go to the polls in five states by january next year
bullish factors to look forward to in regards to indian gasoil include solid economic growth with special emphasis towards rural development improving activities an uptick in the construction sector and not the least the upcoming elections said sri paravaikkarasu head of east of suez oil at consultancy fge
meanwhile an expected plentiful monsoon would boost agricultural expansion as seasonal rainfall is likely to be unaffected by an el nino weather pattern forecast to set in after the rainy season ends in september
in the absence of rain diesel will be used for power generation
however a good rainfall will mean that diesel will be used a lot more in harvesting vijayakar said

election spending and the tendency of refiners to refrain from increasing diesel prices during this period will particularly support the fuel s demand said abhishek kumar senior energy analyst at interfax energy s global gas analytics in london
