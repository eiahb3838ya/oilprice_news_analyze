oil, gold to gain on syrian strikes, russian retaliation in focus
markets should take heart from limited surgical strikes riskier assets such as equities unlikely to suffer major losses new western strikes or russian retaliation are major fears by vidya ranganathan jan harvey and dmitry zhdannikov london april reuters gold and oil will extend their gains on monday albeit modestly when the markets open for the first time since western powers launched a missile attack on syria but equities and bonds are unlikely to suffer big losses unless the west strikes again or russia retaliates
the newsflow is actually better than what it looked like at one point during last week as the strike was surgical followed by a pullback
reports show a lot of care was taken not to hit russian targets which is a good sign and the market should take heart from that said salman ahmed chief investment strategist at lombard odier investment managers in london
gold has benefited in recent days as a asset amid a trade dispute and the escalating conflict in syria which also pushed oil above per barrel due to concerns about a spike in middle eastern tensions
world stocks wobbled last week but still ended with the best weekly gain in over a month as investors await potentially healthy company earnings
despite heightened risks the impact on assets has been and modest while the yen rose initially on fears of a syrian strike it ended near lows to the dollar last week
on saturday french and british missile attacks struck at the heart of syria s chemical weapons programme in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago although the assault appeared unlikely to halt syrian president bashar s progress in the civil war
for map of syrian strikes the bombing denounced by damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression was the biggest intervention by western countries against assad and his powerful ally russia
but the three countries said the strikes were limited to syria s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling assad or intervening in the civil war
naeem aslam chief market analyst at think markets said gold was poised to gain on monday but the rally wouldn t be very steep the focus will be on the from gold often used as a store of value in times of political and economic uncertainty could rally towards per ounce after two consecutive weeks of gains
if we do break above that next week we would be very bullish said aslam
others were less convinced of the market s ability to gain much further ground
i think the strikes were well targeted and as such gold market impact will be minimal as it will be hard to justify a major retaliation said a trader at a leading bullion bank
tokyo will be the first major market to open on monday and the yen will likely strengthen to the dollar but not beyond said itsuo toshima market analyst at toshima associates adding that he didn t expect stocks traders to take sharp moves tomorrow
the first attack was within expectations and was already priced in the market
however if there is second round of strikes that is not in line with expectations
so that should prompt a sharp move in markets
stocks will plunge the yen and the oil prices will surge he added
frank benzimra head of global markets for asia pacific at societe generale corporate and investment banking also said stocks were set to plunge only in case of new strikes by western powers
in case of such an escalation assets should outperform asia markets oil would rally further the yen would spike and japan s domestic defensive stocks would outperform international stocks
for the stress on asia equity markets to be sustainable we would need to have oil prices spiking to such a level that fundamental concerns
higher inflation and risks on growth return to the market he said
amrita sen from energy aspects said that despite middle eastern tensions and looming new sanctions on iran she believed oil has outperformed most expectations this year and may have rallied too far too fast
we are likely to get a this week as the extent of the syrian strikes have been muted and in general calmer nerves prevail in washington she said
