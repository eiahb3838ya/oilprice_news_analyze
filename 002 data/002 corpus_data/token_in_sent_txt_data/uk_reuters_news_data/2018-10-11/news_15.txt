update 1-ex-nigerian president obasanjo backs former deputy for 2019 election
lagos reuters nigerian of state olusegun obasanjo backed his former deputy on thursday for next year s presidential election ending a public feud that had threatened to undermine the main opposition candidate
atiku abubakar who on sunday won the race to be the candidate of the opposition people s democratic party pdp was vice president under obasanjo from but their relationship became strained at the time
opposition to his candidacy by obasanjo a former military ruler who was democratically elected when nigeria switched to civilian rule years ago and remains influential could have cut abubakar s access to vital patronage networks needed to mobilise grassroot support and funds
abubakar poses the biggest challenge to president muhammadu buhari who is seeking a second term in the february election
the country emerged in from its first recession in years but economic growth remains sluggish and inflation is above the central bank s target
you have capacity to perform better than the incumbent
you surely understand the economy better you have business experience which can make your administration and boost the economy and provide jobs obasanjo said in a statement carrying comments addressed to abubakar
abubakar has long enjoyed support from the business elite in nigeria s commercial capital lagos for his ideals and as vice president he implemented a liberalisation programme in areas including the telecoms sector
the statement was issued when the two men met in the southwestern city of abeokuta where they posed for pictures that were posted on abubakar s twitter feed
whenever or wherever you might have offended me as a christian who asks for god s forgiveness of my sins and inadequacies on daily basis i forgive and i sincerely advise you to learn from the past said obasanjo
abubakar told reuters earlier this year that if elected he would privatise parts of the state oil company and allow the naira currency to float to attract foreign investment
buhari s spokesman garba shehu said the former president s comments amounted to a predictable and somersault
shehu added we will not allow ourselves to be reporting by alexis akwagyiram in lagos additional reporting by paul carsten and felix onuah in abuja editing by david stamp
