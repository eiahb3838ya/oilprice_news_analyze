update 3-opec says oil market well supplied, wary of 2019 surplus
london reuters opec sees the oil market as well supplied and is wary of creating a glut next year the group s said on thursday suggesting producers are in no rush to expand a june agreement that raises output
oil prices have rallied this year on expectations that sanctions on iran will strain supplies by lowering shipments from opec s oil producer
brent crude last week reached the highest since
opec mohammad barkindo speaking at the oil money conference in london said there were many factors influencing the oil market that were beyond oil producers control
the market has been reacting to perceptions of a possible supply shortage
the market remains well supplied he told a briefing
the projections for clearly show a possible rebuild of stocks he said of the supply and demand balance for next year
opec separately updated its oil supply and demand forecasts on thursday cutting demand estimates for next year due to economic challenges such as trade disputes and volatile emerging markets and pointing to excess supply
one of the factors boosting prices according to analysts and some members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has been the decision by president donald trump to reimpose sanctions on iran
trump has demanded that opec cool prices by pumping more oil
barkindo asked whether trump s criticism of opec was unfair said the market is currently being largely driven by decisions taken elsewhere outside opec outside opec and allied producers not including the united states agreed in june to return to percent compliance with output cuts that began in january after months of underproduction in venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above percent
opec s report said its own production rose by barrels per day in september to million bpd the highest this year although producers have yet to increase supply enough to reach percent compliance
barkindo responding to a question whether producers needed to go beyond full delivery of the agreement said they were taking it step by step
we have to continue to assess to see how and when we will achieve the percent conformity and how the market would respond hoping that some of these factors will evaporate by then he said
we remain faithful to what we agreed in opec and its allies hold their next meeting in december to decide policy for next year
in the report released on thursday opec cut the estimate for demand in for its own crude to million bpd because of weaker demand and rising supplies outside the group
should opec keep pumping at september s rate the report points to an excess supply of almost million bpd in although this is before any sizeable reduction takes place in iranian output
iran pumped million bpd in september according to figures in opec s report on thursday down bpd from august
production dropped below million bpd under previous sanctions that were lifted following the nuclear deal
graphic iran monthly oil production barkindo said oil producers were worried about their levels of spare output capacity which reduces their ability to make up for sudden supply shortages amid a reduction in investment
we are very concerned barkindo said when asked about spare capacity citing a continued decline in oil industry investment resulting from a market downturn that began in
saudi arabia the de facto leader of opec is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity on hand to supply the market if needed
the kingdom will invest billion in the next few years to maintain and possibly expand its spare oil production capacity saudi energy minister khalid said this month
