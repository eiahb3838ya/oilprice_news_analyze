column-indonesia wants to export more coal, buyers ignore the call: russell
launceston australia reuters indonesia wants to export more coal in order to earn dollars to shore up its faltering currency but the problem is buyers don t seem to be hearing the message
indonesia s coal exports dropped to million tonnes in september down percent from august s million tonnes and percent from million tonnes in the same month last year according to and port data compiled by refinitiv
if the drop isn t worrying enough it comes even as the price of indonesian coal is at its widest discount to australian thermal coal
indonesia is planning to increase its output of coal to around million tonnes up from a previous target of million tonnes
the aim is to convert the additional dollars from sales of the polluting fuel into rupiah which has dropped about percent so far this year against the currency
in theory importers should be keen to ramp up purchases of indonesian coal as the massive discount to australian cargoes more than compensates for the lower energy value
the price of thermal coal at australia s newcastle port as assessed by argus media was a tonne in the week ended
indonesian coal with an energy content of kilocalories per kilogram was at a tonne at the end of the same week according to argus
this represents a discount of a tonne the widest on record exceeding the recorded in november according to the argus data
even indonesian coal with a similar energy content to newcastle is trading at a fairly wide discount with the indonesian government s reference price known as the hba set at a tonne for october
graphic the hba is a composite price made up equally of the platts kalimantan assessments the coal index for newcastle export index of and the globalcoal newcastle grade of
in effect the hba index sets the price for much of indonesia s thermal coal exports and its discount to newcastle should provide support for exports from the southeast asian nation
indonesia the world s largest exporter of thermal coal used in power stations has two major customers china and india the planet s two largest coal importers
chinese buyers mainly use indonesian coal as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies trading off a loss in energy value for lower sulphur and ash
indonesia s exports to china are up strongly in the first nine months of the year reaching million tonnes percent above the level for the same period last year according to the data
however much of this strength was in the first quarter of and september marked a third month of declining imports from indonesia
china imported million tonnes from indonesia in september down sharply from august s million tonnes making it the weakest month so far this year
the news on india s imports isn t quite as bad for indonesian exporters with september s million tonnes down slightly from august s million tonnes
however for the first nine months of the year india s imports from indonesia have been relatively flat dropping fractionally to million tonnes from million in the same period in
what may be worrying for indonesian coal exporters is that their rivals seem to be gaining on them in india while they stand still
india bought million tonnes of coal from the united states in the period up percent on the million tonnes imported in the same period last year
from south africa india imported million tonnes in the first nine months of up percent from million tonnes in the same period a year ago
although the overwhelming majority of australia s coal exports to india are coking coal used in it s worth noting that these are also up in the first nine months of climbing to million tonnes compared to million tonnes in the same period last year
what the numbers are showing is that indonesia is likely to struggle to ramp up exports of its mainly thermal coal as there doesn t seem to be appetite among buyers even though the discount to fuel is as wide as it has ever been
