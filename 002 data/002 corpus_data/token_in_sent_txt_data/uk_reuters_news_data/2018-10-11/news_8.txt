big oil still reluctant to open spending taps -goldman
focus on returns even after oil prices hit high concerns over oil demand weigh m a likely to remain constrained by ron bousso and dmitry zhdannikov london oct reuters energy companies and investors are focused on profits and reluctant to boost spending even after crude prices surged to highs a senior goldman sachs banker said on thursday
rattled by the recent downturn in the sector and concerns over oil demand and the switch to renewables big oil is facing an unprecedented challenge
we re firmly through that survival phase and the better capitalized players are now positioned to do well on the other side of it andrew fry global head of energy at goldman said at the oil money conference in london
companies typically seek to increase spending as they emerge from a downturn in order to capture low drilling costs and an expected supply shortage
but this time round the barriers for investments are high with investors seeking returns of as much as to percent from dollar oil and gas projects fry said
in the near term the focus is on returns as opposed to growth for the sake of growth he said
as a result companies are currently focusing on buying back shares and paying dividends to investors with the excess cash they generate
for the first time since the downturn the oil companies now have their balance sheets in order
they are all starting to think about growth but it is very conservative james janoskey global of oil and gas at jpmorgan said
when we came out of downturns in the past we didn t have energy transition issues and there probably wasn t that much pressure from capital expenditure among the world s top oil companies is expected to rise to billion by from the current billion but will remain well below the billion before the oil price collapse according to adam brett hsbc global head of natural resources advisory
that means oil majors will show very healthy returns on capital invested he added
he said that even in the united states where oil output has resumed spectacular growth on the back of high oil prices large companies will try to maintain capital discipline and focus on returns rather than pure production growth
for big oil value will prevail over volume brett said adding that most remuneration reports now made clear that top executives at oil majors are being rewarded for delivering robust cash flows rather than production increases
acquisitions another way to boost production and reserves are also expected to be constrained and focused
energy mergers and acquisitions amounted to billion last year and stand at billion so far this year said brett
although the volume of m a has been relatively stable in recent years the structure has changed since china largely suspended its buying spree over the past three years he said
an drive and revisions of overly expensive deals have prompted china to cut down on buying resources around the world in the past three years
brett said that m a were currently dominated by downstream and transactions with the share of upstream declining to percent from as high as percent when china was an active asset buyer
you see much more downstream m a activity
and i expect this to continue in the years ahead brett said
