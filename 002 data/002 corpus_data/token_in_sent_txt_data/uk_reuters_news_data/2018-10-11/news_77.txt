update 1-u.s. oil ceo says corporations should work to stem climate change
houston reuters corporations around the world should work together to reduce carbon emissions and stem climate change rather than wait for government mandates the chief executive of oil producer occidental petroleum corp said on wednesday
pressure is rising on companies especially in the energy sector to slash their greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent climate change
oxy which has for years been a vocal supporter of efforts to reduce carbon emissions is the largest oil producer in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico the biggest oilfield
we as corporations we have to do our part
there are enough companies committed to making it happen vicki hollub said in an interview on the sidelines of the tudor pickering holt co energy disruption conference in houston
it needs to be a worldwide oxy rival exxon mobil corp said on tuesday it would donate million to a political action committee s lobbying campaign to promote a tax on carbon emissions
the donation is designed to help sway public opinion around climate change legislation
a carbon tax would shift the financial burden of climate change mitigation efforts from corporations to consumers
i think it goes beyond making a donation to some organization said hollub
it really needs to have the collaboration of all the oxy believes it is too soon to support a carbon tax and that corporations should work with regulators and environmentalists to study the best approach hollub said
we re not really prepared right to say it needs to be a tax said hollub who became ceo in
oxy s production prowess in the permian stems from its use of a technique that harnesses carbon dioxide produced from power plants forcing it back into aging oilfields
that boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface
it is a process that oxy has historically used in conventional oilfields but is studying how to use in shale wells hollub said
still oil producers remain controversial in the fight against rising temperatures
a report from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change released on monday said renewable energy would need to supply percent of electricity by to help stem climate change compared with about percent now
the paris climate accord s goal of capping global temperature increases to well below degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit is important to us hollub said
president donald trump s decision to pull out of the paris agreement was the right thing for the country hollub said adding that oxy and other corporations should still focus on cutting emissions
and we re committed to doing our part she said
