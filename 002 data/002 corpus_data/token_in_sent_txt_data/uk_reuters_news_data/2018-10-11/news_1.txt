exclusive-naftogaz courting partners to develop ukraine gas fields
london reuters ukraine s naftogaz is in talks in london with a number of big oil and gas firms to help it develop the country s existing and gas fields the company s chief executive has told reuters
ukraine is looking to increase domestic production so it can lessen its energy dependence on hostile neighbour russia the cost of which is straining kiev s limited finances
ukraine used to produce around billion cubic meters bcm of gas a year when it was part of the soviet union but now draws out only around bcm
one of the reasons why i am currently in london is that i am negotiating with big international oil and gas companies potential partnership agreements to develop gas fields in ukraine chief executive andriy kobolev said in an interview
kobolev believes the potential to recover some of the production lost over the last years is sizable if it can revive existing gas fields and tap new shale and offshore areas
we have done lots of studies we have lots of geological materials we have lots of experience producing from those fields and we see huge potential he said
by the end of the year we will sign at least one partnership and i believe if we have one partner this year i would expect we could sign partnership agreements with at least two big names next ukraine imported almost percent of its gas during last year s icy winter but the cost has risen in recent years due to the hryvnia s devaluation in international currency markets
the international monetary fund is also demanding kiev hike what households are charged for gas to match what it costs the country to buy it
at the moment that requires a roughly percent increase
it s a tough political sell ahead of presidential elections next year but without it the imf is unlikely to disperse a trillion aid tranche
my hope is the imf deal will be reached this month kobolev said
this might sound strange he added but at the end of the day such reforms gas price rises if they are done the right way they can actually be positive for the his advice was to make sure poorer parts of the population receive special payments to help cover their increased bills
on top of that they should be able to keep any money they save by cutting their consumption
it is simple you need to monetise if kiev and the imf can not agree a new aid deal however kobolev said naftogaz would almost certainly have to shelve its plans for a billion bond sale that has been pencilled in for sometime over the next month
if the deal doesn t happen our probability of success will be very very additional reporting by natalia zinets in kiev editing by dale hudson
