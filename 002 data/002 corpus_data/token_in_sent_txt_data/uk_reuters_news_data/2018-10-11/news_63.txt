china coal city vows 'no-coal zones' in bid to curb pollution
shanghai reuters datong a major city in northern china s shanxi province will establish zones in urban districts as part of its efforts to curb pollution the provincial government said on thursday
the shanxi government said the restrictions would cover square kilometers square miles and would include bans on the storage sale and direct combustion of all kinds of coal
power and central heating systems will still be permitted
it said households in datong would switch to cleaner gas heating this winter and that it had already demolished boilers
datong was one of china s major coal producing regions for decades but many of its collieries are now depleted
overmining has contaminated the city s soil and underground water tables as well as causing devastating subsidence
that has left large parts of its old mining districts unfit for farming or construction
the city was also ranked as one of the country s worst performers when it came to meeting water quality standards in the of this year
shanxi which produces nearly a billion tonnes of coal a year has been forced to relocate more than people from unsafe former mining districts at risk of collapse
the province is one of china s major pollution control zones over the period and it is under pressure to keep coal consumption levels unchanged from
neighboring hebei which has been on the frontline of china s war on pollution since established similar zones in several districts in the smog prone cities of langfang and baoding last year
hebei was ordered by the central government to cut coal consumption by million tonnes over the period as part of its commitments to boost air quality
however the province struggled to find the natural gas supplies required to replace coal heating systems for thousands of rural households last winter forcing the government to slow the conversion process
according to a report submitted to parliament earlier this year all households in the region as well as the neighboring provinces of shanxi and shaanxi will have converted from coal to natural gas heating by
the report said million households throughout northern china had already made the switch over the period
