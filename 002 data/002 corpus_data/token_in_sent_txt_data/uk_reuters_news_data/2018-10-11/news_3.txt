escalating oil prices rising interest rates an appreciating dollar and growing uncertainty about the outlook for international trade are proving a poisonous cocktail for global growth and have been triggered crises in the past
economic growth and corporate earnings have remained strong in the united states but in much of the rest of the world momentum has been slackening since the start of the year
strong and synchronised growth in has been replaced by an unbalanced expansion that increasingly relies on consumers and businesses to be sustained

air freight volumes are still rising but more slowly than in reflecting a mixed outlook for export orders according to the international air transport association
manufacturers around the world reported global export orders fell slightly in september for the first time in months according to the new export orders component of the jp morgan global pmi
these indicators are all correlated closely with one another and with the rate of expansion in the world economy and they all tell a consistent story of slowing momentum outside the united states
the global economic expansion shows signs of increasing maturity with unemployment rates falling to lows in many of the major economies spare capacity dwindling and input prices rising
oil prices have risen strongly especially when expressed in terms of currencies other than the dollar and are now at levels that have preceded recessions in the past for countries outside the united states
the global economy shows signs of being at a relatively late stage in the cycle and policymakers have made a series of choices that have complicated the outlook still further in the united states the combination of an expansionary fiscal policy tax cuts with a restrictive monetary policy rising interest rates is causing the real exchange rate to appreciate
dollar appreciation is worsening trade deficit while rising interest rates are increasing costs for some of the most vulnerable and borrowers in emerging markets
aggressive sanctions on iran are reducing global crude supplies and using up what remains of the industry s spare capacity intensifying the upward pressure on oil prices
proliferating tariffs are increasing costs for businesses and sowing uncertainty about the future of global supply chains which will likely cause a pause in investment
intensifying superpower competition between the united states and china has led to growing concerns about national security and the proliferation of trade and investment restrictions
national security officials have increasingly become more influential than officials in many countries reversing the balance of power that had prevailed for much of the previous years
sanctions policies have disrupted supply chains from oil and aluminium to electronics and telecommunications equipment
the political environment for business has turned much more uncertain with increasing country risk and weakening commitment to a international order
as the global economic expansion has become longer and memories of the downturn have faded policymakers have started to take it for granted and adopted policies that put it at increasing risk
there is a significant possibility that the global economy experiences either a gradual slowdown or an outright recession before the end of
slower growth in economic activity may be needed to ease some of the pressure on oil supplies and in other parts of the supply chain
crucially the threat of slower growth might concentrate the minds of policymakers on the need to provide a more predictable and supportive environment for growth
