update 1-regulator ties pipeline work to deadly massachusetts gas explosion
adds details from report by liz hampton houston oct reuters a nisource inc affiliate failed to require contract repair crews to relocate pressure sensors during pipeline work the national transportation safety board ntsb said on thursday resulting in overpressured lines that caused explosions and fires in three massachusetts communities last month
overpressurized gas poured through columbia gas co of massachusetts distribution system in lawrence north andover and andover flooding into homes and businesses and sparking explosions and fires that killed one person and injured
critical valves controlling the gas flow were not shut for nearly hours after the first alarm was raised at columbia gas s monitoring center ntsb said in a preliminary report
the center had no ability to remotely open or close valves on its own but did notify technicians it added
nisource is fully cooperating with the ntsb chief executive joe hamrock said in a statement on thursday
however it will not comment on the cause of the incident until the ntsb completes its work he added
the incident raised safety concerns about the sprawling networks of aging pipelines
the september explosions and fires damaged homes and businesses as columbia gas was replacing pipe with safer plastic lines when the accident occurred
the ntsb laid out the timetable of events in a dry account of the company s activities that day
crews were working for columbia gas in lawrence a city northwest of boston to replace an aged main with a new plastic distribution main line
the abandoned main had regulator sensing lines used to detect pressure in the system
after that main line was disconnected the sensing lines lost pressure and the regulators fully opened allowing the full flow of gas into the distribution system supplying the neighborhood the report said
columbia gas had approved a work package that did not account for the location of the sensing lines or require their relocation to ensure the regulators were sensing actual system pressure according to the ntsb
minutes before the explosion columbia gas monitoring center in columbus ohio received high pressure alarms for its south lawrence gas pressure system
the company shut down the regulator at issue about minutes later around the ntsb said
september s explosion was the largest natural gas pipeline accident since in terms of structures involved
eight years ago an interstate gas transmission line operated by pacific gas and electric company ruptured in san bruno california killing eight people destroying buildings and damaging others according to the ntsb
columbia gas has said all cast iron and bare steel piping in affected neighborhoods will be replaced with high pressure plastic mains that have regulators at each service meter
