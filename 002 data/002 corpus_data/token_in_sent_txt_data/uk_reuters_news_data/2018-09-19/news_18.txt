french draft power sector reform draws criticism from independent firms
edf operates all france s nuclear reactors smaller power firms can buy electricity at fixed price edf says existing mechanism unfair needs reform by bate felix paris sept reuters the french government plans to reform the way independent power firms buy nuclear electricity from edf but has drawn criticism from the smaller firms which say the draft proposals will reduce competition and increase their costs
under the existing arenh mechanism edf offers up to twh per year or about a quarter of its french nuclear production to its smaller rivals for delivery at a fixed price of euros per megawatt
the mechanism was set up to encourage competition and offset edf s monopoly on nuclear power production
edf operates all of france s nuclear reactors that generate more than percent of the nation s electricity needs
edf has long complained the mechanism gives rivals unfair access to its nuclear output and says competitors profit from arbitrage trade buying power via the arenh window at a fixed price and reselling it when wholesale market prices are higher
the proposed reform aims to curb this arbitrage by setting new conditions for purchasing nuclear power changing quantities allocated for a given period and locking buyers into contracts the draft reform seen by reuters showed
the proposed reform poses a serious threat to competition in the electricity market the independent power providers said in a statement sent through their gas and power lobby groups
they said the reform would mean they would carry more risk would have less visibility about the volume they would receive and would face increased costs for accessing the mechanism
under the changes sales of nuclear power under the arenh mechanism would be staggered with percent of the twh sold on percent on july and percent on
supplies would be delivered from the following january
currently independent providers bid for the whole arenh volume at the same time in november with delivery made from january the following year
the independent providers have urged the french new energy minister françois de rugy to halt the reform and increase their access to edf s nuclear power
the reform could artificially reduce the size of the arenh mechanism a source at one independent power provider said adding the changes could violate european competition laws
french and european electricity contracts for delivery have soared well above the arenh price in recent weeks tracking gains in coal gas and european carbon emission prices
the french cal delivery contract hit an high of on
it was trading at on wednesday
