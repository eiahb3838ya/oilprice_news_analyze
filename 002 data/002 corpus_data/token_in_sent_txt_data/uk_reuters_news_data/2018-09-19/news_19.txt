coca-cola moving ahead with takeover of nigeria's chi juice
lagos reuters is moving ahead with plans to take over nigeria s leading juice company chi ltd and aims to complete the deal early next year a senior executive told reuters
the acquisition for an undisclosed price is one of several steps the company is taking in a global strategy to diversify from its core business of sugary sodas
last month it agreed to buy costa coffee for billion and sources familiar with the matter say it is also bidding for glaxosmithkline s indian horlicks nutrition business
we are still on track to complete the acquisition of chi ltd by the end of the first quarter of peter njonjo president of s west africa business said on wednesday
bought a percent stake in the nigerian juice and snack producer in january and said at the time it aimed to increase ownership within three years
juice sales form a central plank of the company s attempt to offer drinks at a range of price points in nigeria to improve affordability in a country where njonjo sees high inflation and modest economic growth in the coming year
focusing on smaller bottles and cans is another way the company is trying to woo consumers in nigeria which emerged from its first recession in years in but continues to suffer from sluggish growth and high inflation
affordability will start becoming a bigger issue in this market than it was in the past
as a company that is what we need to factor in as we are thinking about the future of our business in nigeria njonjo said in an interview
he pointed to the introduction of a centilitre bottle of coke zero for naira compared with the standard centilitre bottle for naira as just one example
njonjo said the company s drive to diversify its product range could also give it more flexibility in a market where unemployment is high and the united nations estimates most of the population of million lives on less than pounds a day
we realise that in certain pack formats you can only go down so low he said in an interview at his office in the commercial capital lagos
but once you start looking at pouches and still products like juice and drinking yoghurts that allows you to start accessing much lower price njonjo said the purchase of costa could present a significant opportunity in nigeria despite the absence of a culture of drinking there
there definitely could be opportunity around coffee here in nigeria having iced coffee blends of dairy and coffee packaged in different formats he said
njonjo said horlicks a hot beverage was an interesting proposition that could be a significant opportunity on the african continent
but while the company was researching drinks from locally relevant ingredients such as ginger he said he could not see a market for marijuana drinks something the company has said it was closely watching in the past
in january announced a global goal to help collect and recycle its packaging
njonjo said the company was working in nigeria to collect bottles and find a way for them to be through a partnership with lafarge in which bottles would be burned in kilns as an energy source
a memorandum of understanding was being formalised and would be signed in the next few weeks he said adding that implementation would begin in the last quarter of this year
he said the company was also working with lagos state government on marine collection to remove waste from waterways in the city which is built on a lagoon
