column-u.s. natural gas prices remain on defensive despite low stocks: kemp
london reuters benchmark natural gas prices have remained stuck below per million british thermal units for most of this year even as consumption has soared and gas stocks have slipped to their lowest seasonal levels since
working stocks in underground storage amounted to just billion cubic feet at the end of the first week in september down from bcf at the same point last year and a average of bcf
gas consumption by power producers has risen strongly as a result of high demand during a long hot summer and the commissioning of another wave of generating units
cooling demand has been more than percent higher than in and percent above the average so far in
chartbook cumulative demand has been similar to the heatwave of according to statistics from the
climate prediction center
power producers gas consumption is also being boosted by the large number of new generating units that have started up
power producers had gigawatts of generating capacity available at the end of june up percent compared with
and low gas prices have encouraged power producers to run them for more hours with capacity utilisation rates several percentage points higher every month so far in compared with
much of the increase in generation has come at the expense of coal where capacity has declined by more than percent from levels and utilisation rates have been down in most months so far in
power producers generated almost percent more electricity from gas in the first six months of the year while generation was down almost percent electric power monthly energy information administration august
as a result power producers consumed an extra bcf percent of gas in the first half of compared with
natural gas exports also rose by bcf in the first half as new pipelines opened to mexico and lng terminals ramped up
despite the enormous increase in consumption and exports domestic production has been rising even faster keeping prices low
natural gas production excluding liquids surged by bcf in the first half of compared with the same period in natural gas monthly eia august
the of domestic gas production coupled with the growing volume of exports and the increased use of gas in the power sector is fundamentally altering the relationship between stocks and prices
gas traders now anticipate a large potential increase in inventories during the shoulder season after summer demand ends and before winter heating demand picks up
to ensure there is enough storage availability gas prices remained low over the summer to encourage power producers to maximise gas consumption keeping stocks much lower than in recent years
and to limit the increase when it comes in the next few weeks gas prices have to remain low to continue incentivising high power burn during the shoulder season
low prices are also curbing new drilling with the number of rigs targeting predominantly formations down to last week from a peak of in after rising steadily for the last two years
because production is now so plentiful the market is comfortable carrying lower inventories over the summer months
the calendar strip of futures prices for remains stuck well below per million btus a sign supplies are expected to remain plentiful notwithstanding strong consumption growth and relatively low inventories
most traders see little prospect of a sustained rise in gas prices
hedge fund managers hold a net long position in natural gas futures and options equivalent to bcf down from bcf on
fund managers long positions outnumber short ones by a ratio of just down from recent highs of at the end of january and in may
