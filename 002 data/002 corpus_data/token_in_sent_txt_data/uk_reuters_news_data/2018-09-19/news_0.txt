rpt-column-lng industry is super bullish, but in no rush to benefit: russell
repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell barcelona sept reuters bullish as a word doesn t quite capture the stampede of optimism that was gushing out from the natural gas industry at its biggest annual event this week in barcelona
the demand is there stated saad sherida the chief executive of qatar petroleum the world s largest producer of liquefied natural gas lng in confirming that his country was on track to lift its output to million tonnes of the fuel by
s remarks were among the more measured at the gastech conference with some executives making predictions that the market for lng currently around million tonnes a year will more than double by
speaker after speaker on the panels offered up various versions of the view that natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel from dirtier and coal and crude oil to renewables but is now a major part of world s energy mix for the long term
but in stark contrast to the swathes of optimism there was very little talk of when the next round of major lng projects will reach the stage of final investment decisions fid
if the denizens of the natural gas industry truly believe in the forecasts of rapid and strong growth in lng demand led by emerging buyers in asia and china s ongoing embrace of the fuel it would be logical to expect a new round of project approvals
instead progress toward fids for many of the planned projects around the world appears glacial
the exception to this slow process are those developers who have access to capital and can take higher investment risks than more cautious energy companies who have to satisfy not only a board of directors but also bankers and shareholders
qatar s planned additional million tonnes of lng capacity is a case in point
the small middle eastern country has the capital to underpin such a decision and its structure means it can still prosper even if the extra capacity turns out to be surplus to market needs thereby lowering prices
another exception appears to be russia s novatek the developer of the yamal lng facility
novatek chairman leonid mikhelson told a media briefing at gastech that the company s planned project would add million tonnes of lng taking his company s total output to about million tonnes by
mikhelson expressed confidence that the funding for the new venture would be secured and also that there was no doubt in his mind that asia would soak up the additional lng
while mikhelson may well be correct and is prepared to invest to back his vision western oil companies may find it harder to get the necessary approvals
there is no shortage of lng projects around the world with several planned in canada the united states east africa and australia
but the scars from the last round of major lng developments perhaps haven t quite healed and are fresh in the memories of many developers
over the past decade australia has built eight new lng projects at a cost of more than billion and will at least temporarily overtake qatar as the world s top producer when the last two come online later this year or early in
however many of the projects ran over budget and were delayed and the surge of supply caused spot lng prices to at one stage fall to around a quarter of the record levels reached in
the other major contributor to lng supply has been the united states which now has two operating lng export facilities and four more under construction and likely to be producing by
but if the demand forecasts for annual lng trade to rise from the current million tonnes per annum to something closer to million tonnes or even more by are accurate then there isn t enough new lng being developed
in theory this should spark a new round of fids but the lng world has been changing at a rapid pace and the traditional methods of developing large projects appear unlikely to work this time
the traditional way of developing a dollar plant was to underpin the financing by contracting sales most often linked to the price of crude oil
but lng buyers no longer want these kind of deals and are embracing the model of agreement and spot purchases from a variety of suppliers
it would take a brave or reckless board of directors to sign off on project of up to billion on the hope that if we build it they will buy it
bankers are also unlikely to be impressed with that sort of justification for a new venture
projects in the united states now face the additional hurdle and uncertainty being created by president donald trump s escalating trade dispute with china with lng now included in beijing s retaliatory tariffs
the trade war may turn out to be a relatively affair
but while it remains resolved it may well give pause to any planned fids in the united states
overall companies are going to have find new ways of underwriting project developments or risk losing out to those developers that can afford to take the risks
