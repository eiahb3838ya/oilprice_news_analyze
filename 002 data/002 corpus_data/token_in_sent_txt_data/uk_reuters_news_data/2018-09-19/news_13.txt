update 7-u.s. oil prices surge as inventory draw adds to supply concerns
new york reuters oil futures surged nearly percent on wednesday as they were bolstered by a fifth weekly crude inventory drawdown and strong domestic gasoline demand amid ongoing global supply concerns over sanctions on iran that come into force in november
crude inventories fell million barrels last week to million barrels the lowest level since february government data showed
gasoline stocks fell million barrels versus forecasts for a drop
it was a squarely bullish report said john kilduff a partner at again capital management in new york
the demand from drivers is proving gasoline consumption usually picks up in the summer and wanes in autumn but demand remained strong in the latest week estimated at million barrels per day
crude futures settled up or percent at a barrel
brent futures also rose but the gains were more muted as the global benchmark ended cents or percent higher at a barrel
in the previous session brent rose percent on a media report that saudi arabia the world s largest oil exporter was comfortable with prices above indicating the producer would not try to increase output to drive prices lower
reuters reported on that saudi arabia wanted oil to stay between and to keep a balance between maximising revenue and keeping a lid on prices until congressional elections
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other producers including russia meet on in algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases within their quota framework to offset the loss of iranian supply
sanctions affecting iran s oil exports come into force on and many buyers have already scaled back iranian purchases
but it is unclear how easily other producers can compensate for any lost supply
