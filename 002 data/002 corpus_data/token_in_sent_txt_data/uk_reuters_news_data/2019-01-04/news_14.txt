column-dollar cycle may be about to turn, supporting oil prices: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london jan reuters the dollar has recently appreciated to its highest level in real terms since the start of and before that september
dollar appreciation weighed on oil prices in as prices in some currencies hit record levels earlier in the year and dampened consumption growth
yet there are signs that the dollar s rise may be coming to an end as trade tensions with china weigh and pressure to raise rates dissipates lifting prospects for oil prices to recover
for now dollar strength has helped hold down inflation even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades
but it has contributed to a worsening trade deficit and cut the dollar value of overseas earnings of companies
the united states is currently running a mix of expansionary fiscal policy tax cuts and increased spending on the military and a less accommodative or contractionary financial policy rising interest rates
the consequence is an improvement in the between employment and inflation internal balance but a deterioration in the trade deficit external balance
exchange rate movements have suppressed inflation despite the booming economy but at the cost of declining international competitiveness despite tariffs
the strong dollar has posed a dilemma for the federal reserve halting interest rates hikes runs the risk of pushing down the real exchange rate and pushing up inflation

the trump administration and the federal reserve are to some extent the policy mix of the reagan administration and the central bank under paul volcker in the
the reagan administration s tax cuts and defence coupled with higher interest rates caused the dollar to surge and the trade deficit to soar
the reagan administration pressed trading partners to cut exports to the united states especially cars steel and electronics and boost their currencies
eventually the white house pushed the fed to adopt a more accommodative policy triggering the departure of the chairman
it is worth noting the current trade representative robert lighthizer was the deputy trade representative in the reagan administration when it forced japan to accept voluntary export restraints to curb its exports to the united states
the administration went on to press the other major economies to appreciate their currencies and depreciate the dollar as part of the plaza accord in
the strong dollar of the early worsened the demand destruction and oversupply of oil in the early and contributed to the price crisis of and
subsequent dollar depreciation likely helped steady oil prices in the second half of the at least it did once saudi arabia s oil minister ahmed zaki yamani was replaced and the kingdom abandoned netback pricing and its volume warfare strategy
just as japan was the target for policymakers in the complaining about unfair trading practices china has become the target in the
the experience of the fiscal expansion strong dollar and trade deficits of the hold important lessons for the next two years and a possible roadmap
the trade war between the united states and china has pushed both economies as well as their trading partners towards a slowdown or even a recession in
as economic growth slows both countries are likely to become increasingly eager for a negotiated solution that kickstarts business activity and raises equity prices
the worse the economic news becomes the greater the pressure on both countries particularly the united states which holds a presidential election in to reach a deal
lighthizer s involvement suggests any eventual deal with china and deals with the european union and other trading partners will likely employ some combination of managed trade to reduce the deficit
voluntary export restraints purchases of big ticket items such as aircraft and farm products together with selective tariffs and quotas are likely to form part of the eventual deal
negotiators will also push for structural reforms on intellectual property subsidies and enterprises probably even harder than they did with japan in the
the trump white house has already made its displeasure with the fed over recent interest rate increases very clear
signs of a domestic slowdown will give the central bank an opportunity to the case for further rises or even contemplate a cut if policymakers wish to do so without more pressure from the white house
the white house has been vigilant over the strength of the dollar pressing other trading partners not to depreciate their currencies further
it is not clear whether the administration will try to repeat the plaza accord or include exchange rate conditions in any trade with china
even without a formal exchange rate agreement an end to interest rate increases could halt the currency s upward move and interest rate cuts would probably send it lower again as they did between and
in the short term lower oil prices have been an important part of global rebalancing and will support economic activity in consuming countries and ultimately buy back some demand growth in
but a scenario with lower interest rates dollar depreciation easing trade tensions and an improving global economic outlook could ultimately help push oil prices higher
everything hinges on whether policymakers in the united states and china can find a way to avoid further escalation of their economic war and avert a prolonged global recession
