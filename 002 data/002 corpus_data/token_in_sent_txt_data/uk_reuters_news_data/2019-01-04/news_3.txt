libyan authorities seeking 37 suspects over attacks on oil, military facilities
tripoli reuters libyan authorities issued arrest warrants for suspects over attacks on key oil ports in the east of the country and a military base in the south a source in the attorney general s office said on friday
the source who asked not to be named confirmed the authenticity of the arrest warrants which were dated and were leaked on facebook on thursday
the warrants showed that members of the chadian and sudanese opposition based in libya along with six libyan nationals are wanted for attacks on the oil crescent in the east of the country and on the tamanhint military base as well as for their participation in fighting between libyan rivals
after the toppling of veteran libyan leader muammar gaddafi in a uprising in fighters from neighbouring chad and sudan joined the ensuing turmoil
competing libyan armed factions frequently accuse each other of deploying mercenaries from africa
the libyan suspects include abdul hakim belhadj a rebel leader who helped to topple gaddafi in and is now an islamist political leader
last year britain apologised to belhadj and his wife over the role of british intelligence officers in their rendition from thailand to libya
ibrahim jadhran who is accused of launching an attack last june on the oil crescent is also among those sought by the libyan authorities
jadhran s forces controlled the oil crescent for years until it was taken over in by the libyan national army which is loyal to commander khalifa haftar in eastern libya
the closure of the oil crescent where key oil ports are located has led to production losses of up to barrels per day bpd from a total national output of little over one million bpd
last september the security council added jadhran to the list of individuals subject to an assets freeze and a travel ban
libya s division in place since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments and the shifting military factions they are aligned with
