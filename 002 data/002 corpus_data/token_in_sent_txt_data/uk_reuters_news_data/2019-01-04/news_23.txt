analysis-kim's vision of a coal-fuelled north korean future may be tough to realise
seoul reuters when north korean leader kim jong un used his new year speech to highlight coal as a primary front in developing the economy he was making a case for what analysts see as a flawed but key resource on which his country increasingly relies
coal has long been a major resource for north korea and kim s call for self sufficiency in the face of international pressure is a recurring theme
but as international sanctions have increased over the past year coal is one of the few local resources to which kim can turn as he tries to make good on promises to improve life in a country notorious for limited electricity analysts and defectors say
last year kim declared that his nuclear arsenal was complete and vowed to focus on building the economy
south analysts and north korean defectors report that with sanctions still blocking most coal exports the north has put more of its stockpile to use domestically
my acquaintances in north hamgyong province told me they got power for hours a day in versus hours in said kim young hui a defector who now works as an economist at south korea s korea development bank
a highly noticeable increase in electricity in compared to the year before has increased power availability for many homes and boosted the operations of factories and trains said kang a defector who now writes about north korea for the website daily nk and speaks to sources inside the north
as kim jong un said in the new year speech north korea will focus on the domestic economy she said
instead of finding another route to sell coal they will continue to use it but the ageing technology is limited in how much it can contribute to the broader economy analysts said
focussing on coal and electricity is a way to survive and kim jong un is trying hard to make the country a bit more but coal is not enough to turn around the whole economy as long as exports are capped economist kim young hui said
in the new year speech kim jong un called for the coal industry to focus on helping power stations normalise electricity generation without he noted that output at the country s largest coal power plant in pukchang had increased remarkably and called for more progress on a plan to develop tidal wind and atomic power
politically and economically isolated and repressed under kim s authoritarian regime north korea has long suffered from electricity shortages
in recent years the lack of a reliable power supply led many north koreans to install cheap household solar panels to charge mobile phones and light their homes
during a reporting trip to pyongyang in september multiple north korean sources told reuters that more electricity could help make some of kim s most prized building projects usable
at some recently constructed apartment buildings for example potential residents fear facing dozens of flights of stairs during power outages
electricity in north korea is prioritised for factories or areas of political importance but people with money or connections are often able to tap power lines illegally
a source who regularly speaks to pyongyang residents told reuters that coal for boilers was no longer necessary because it had become more abundant
people had to book coal early about two months before running boilers when the weather gets chilly
but thanks to reduced coal exports it is not hard to buy it anymore after last year
sanctions have been tougher but north koreans can buy coal whenever they want if they have money the source said
north korea generates nearly percent of its electricity from seven coal power plants and one plant and the rest from hydroelectric facilities
many of its coal plants were built by the former soviet union and china according to south korean data
since north korea has been working to convert the oil power plant to coal according to monitoring group north
in the last year it has added generators to the biggest coal power complex and built a new hydro power plant
a deal for an international consortium to provide two reactors to north korea in exchange for its ending some of its operations fell through
since then the country has been working on an experimental light water reactor
coal exports to china fell to million tonnes in from more than million tonnes in according to chinese data
china says it imported no north korean coal from january to march
north korea s coal production rose from to but fell percent to million tonnes in from according to south korean government data
reliable data on north korea s reserves is hard to come by but bp s statistical review of world energy reported that north korea has million tonnes of coal as proven reserves while south korea says the north has billion tonnes in reserve
north korea is known to have billion tonnes of anthracite a higher quality of coal and the rest is lignite which is mainly suitable for power plants
the north mostly exports anthracite according to south korean government data
north korea has tried unsuccessfully to circumvent sanctions by smuggling coal into china and south korea monitors say
smuggling coal into china is not easy these days as even bribes for chinese traders have become more expensive said choi head of the north korea resources institute
