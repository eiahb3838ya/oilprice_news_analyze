feature-solar-pumped water slakes rural kenya's thirst for development
marimanti kenya jan thomson reuters foundation stooped over rows of green gram plants at her farm in eastern kenya grace kaari hums to herself as she slices out weeds with a blunt machete
two years ago kaari would not have had time to tend her crop in the morning
instead she would have been traveling to gather water at a river kilometres miles away
i used to spend the whole day fetching water
i could not do anything else for the day because of tiredness she told the thomson reuters foundation
but a recently installed water pump has now brought the precious resource direct to her village
and with the village water storage tanks full she has time for the endless other tasks on her piece of land she said
access to clean water remains a struggle for many of rural kenya s poorest households with families blaming the problem on everything from a lack of infrastructure to a lack of government commitment to help the country s most marginalised
but some counties such as kaari s tharaka nithi where rural electrification is widely lacking now are tapping solar energy to pump water to villages from nearby rivers
the water is then directed into village storage tanks where household members can fetch it free of charge
people have been struggling with water scarcity yet this county has three permanent rivers
the challenge was to tap water from the sources and bring it near homes said jasper nkanya the county s executive commissioner for agriculture water irrigation and fisheries
nkanya said the county has plenty of sunshine a resource that went untapped for years though that is now changing
the solar units are able to absorb energy which can be used to pump water during the day and at night using a a battery system he said in an interview
established at a cost of million kenya shillings the solar pump project which serves over people is funded by the county government nkanya said
residents say easier access to water has made a difference in their lives particularly those of women and girls who are traditionally charged with gathering water
my daughter used to miss school as she accompanied her mother to fetch water said martin mwiti a motorbike taxi operator in marimanti
now her performance has improved because she is always at school he said
nkanya said the government hopes to expand the project to other parts of the the county that face similar water security problems once more funds are available
another kenyan counties also are seeing solar power put in place to boost development including access to water as part of a world effort said joseph njoroge the energy ministry s principal secretary
the aim is to use solar energy to bring development in marginalised parts of kenya including access to water lighting and heating njoroge said of the million project launched in
mbeo ogeya an african research fellow at the stockholm environment institute said the use of solar power to fuel water pumping and irrigation can be a game changer in energy and food security for marginalised parts of kenya
in marimanti the impact of access to water is already becoming visible
modern homes are gradually replacing huts in the area long one of the poorest in kenya as easier access to water spurs new businesses in part by freeing women s time
health centers now have enough stored water to ensure good hygiene while babies are delivered while children no longer have to spend lesson time at school fetching water said john kibaara a marimanti resident
njoroge of the energy ministry sees much more use of solar power ahead for kenya
we are looking at the potential we have looking ahead and counting on renewable energy to supply our energy needs
this is will reduce energy costs and spur the growth of micro and medium enterprises especially in rural areas he said
