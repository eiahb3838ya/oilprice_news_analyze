india disaster exposes lack of enforcement against deadly illegal mines
mumbai jan thomson reuters foundation ongoing efforts to reach victims of a mining disaster in northeastern india have exposed what campaigners say is poor enforcement against such illegal mines where undocumented workers risk injury or death
at least people were trapped when an illegal coal mine in meghalaya state flooded on
rescue efforts continue although relatives said this week they had lost hope that the miners were still alive
environmental concerns have led to india imposing bans on the mining of coal mica and sand among other minerals
yet workers across the country continue to put themselves at risk as illegal mining continues
a ban does not mean you close your eyes to mining
it means you physically protect natural resources in some way said sumaira abdulali founder of the environmental advocacy group awaaz foundation
but we never set systems in place
we would prefer for things to remain the most recent disaster highlighted the dangers of mines where workers crawl into narrow shafts on bamboo ladders to extract coal
in meghalaya campaigners estimate that mines continue to function despite a ban imposed in by india s environmental court the national green tribunal ngt
india s courts have ordered bans on mining various minerals but it is up to state authorities to enforce them according to niranjan kumar singh a joint secretary in the mining ministry
the role of states has become important as the centre s role is in policy making he said by phone
we do not have the machinery to monitor or but teining dkhar commissioner of meghalaya s mining and geology department said his state has no regulatory mechanism to enforce bans on illegal mining
only when we give a licence for mining we ensure that all environmental and labour laws are followed he said by phone on friday
illegal mining tends to attract workers from around india and neighbouring countries who are lured by the promise of relatively high wages but are faced with dangerous conditions once they arrive
workers in the coal mines are promised about rupees per day more than times the average indian daily wage said angela rangad of thma u war of the oppressed a collective of democracy and human rights groups
they think they will work a few days and return
but they are never paid on time and remain trapped as they keep waiting for their wages said rangad
other workers including children are trafficked
when the charity impulse ngo network surveyed mines in meghalaya between and it found children many of whom were trafficked from nepal and bangladesh
india is one of the world s most dangerous countries to be a coal miner with one miner dying every six days on average in according to government data
the number is likely even larger as deaths in illegal mines are common but often go unreported according to campaigners
a thomson reuters foundation investigation in maharashtra state found that workers were drowning as they illegally extracted sand from the bottom of a creek near mumbai india s commercial capital
the deaths were not reported and employers paid only a few families a small amount of money
in response to the revelations the maharashtra state government promised to end illegal mining along the creek impose regulations and provide alternate jobs
but a year later sand mining was continuing and most of those promises remained unfulfilled
campaigners said state governments need to draw up protocols on how to monitor and enforce bans against illegal mining while the central government must follow up as well
if the state fails to take action the centre should intervene to check the negligence and apathy said hasina kharbhih founder of the impulse ngo network whose petition against mines led the ngt to ban them in meghalaya
