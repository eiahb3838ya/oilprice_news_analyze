update 3-u.s. limits on coal plant mercury emissions too costly -trump's epa
washington reuters the trump administration on friday said limits on mercury emissions from power plants were unnecessary as they were too costly sparking an outcry from environmentalists who feared the next step would be looser rules favouring the coal industry at the expense of public health
under the mercury and air toxic standards or mats enacted under former president barack obama power plants were required to install expensive equipment to cut output of mercury which can harm pregnant women and put infants and children at risk of developmental problems
the environmental protection agency left the emission standards in place but proposed using a different cost analysis to evaluate whether the regulation is needed a move that paves the way for looser rules going forward
its statement was issued on friday during a partial government shutdown
since august the environmental protection agency has been reconsidering the justification for the rule
a coalition of electric utilities had said the looser rules were not needed since they have already invested billions of dollars in technology to cut emissions of the pollutant and comply
epa said it was proposing that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate hap hazardous air pollution emissions from and power plants because the costs of such regulation grossly outweigh the quantified hap it said its reassessment showed the cost of compliance with mats was between billion to billion annually while the monetized benefits were between million to million
it also said the identification of unquantified benefits was not enough to support the standards
among such benefits environmentalists say are reduced healthcare costs breathing cleaner air and drinking cleaner water
the policy acting epa administrator andrew wheeler and president donald trump proposed today means more pregnant women young children and the elderly will be exposed to deadly neurotoxins and poisons just so wealthy coal and oil barons can make a few extra bucks sierra club beyond coal campaign director mary anne hitt said in a statement
wheeler is a former coal industry lobbyist
virtually every coal plant in the has already met this lifesaving standard and now trump is recklessly trying to roll it back she said
a study published this month by harvard university s school of public health said power plants are the top source of mercury in the united states accounting for nearly half of mercury emissions in
it said the standards have markedly reduced mercury in the environment and improved public health
since taking office in january trump has targeted rolling back environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels including crude oil
oil production is the highest in the world above saudi arabia and russia after a boom that was triggered more than a decade ago by improved drilling technology
the coal industry had challenged a conclusion by obama s epa that the rule was justified because savings to consumers on healthcare costs would exceed compliance costs
the calculations accounted for how equipment would reduce emissions of other harmful substances in addition to mercury
trump s industry allies including robert murray ceo of private coal mining giant murray energy corp had complained that the mats rule contributed to the demise of the coal business by triggering hundreds of power plant shutdowns and driving coal demand to its lowest in decades
power generation has fallen more than since a peak in while natural generation soared by about the same amount according to the energy information administration
utilities demand for coal is projected to fall further this year by around percent to million short tons the lowest in years according to the eia
in july electric utilities and utility groups favouring the rule asked the administration to keep it in place
they noted that billions of dollars in investments for equipment have already been made and costs are being recovered from electricity customers through regulated pricing
this is like when your kid tries to clean up your kitchen it actually makes things worse
please stop helping said a utility industry lobbyist based in washington who asked not to be named
the rule itself forced coal plant shutdowns but they aren t coming epa said it will take comment for the proposal for days and will hold at least one public hearing
