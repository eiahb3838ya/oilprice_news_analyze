tough to stop nord stream 2 now it's being built - eu's oettinger
berlin reuters president donald trump s criticism of the nord stream pipeline is no reason to stop the project and any attempt to do so would be difficult now that it is being built european commissioner guenther oettinger said
trump has attacked berlin for supporting the billion gas pipeline spanning the baltic sea accusing germany in july of being a captive of russia due to its reliance on russian energy
energy secretary rick perry said last month that washington retained the option of imposing sanctions on companies working on the pipeline which would bring russian gas directly to germany
berlin and moscow have been at odds since russia annexed crimea four years ago but they have a common interest in the nord stream project which will double the capacity of the existing nord stream route from next year
i was never a great supporter of nord stream oettinger the eu s budget commissioner told german magazine der spiegel
but the truth is the pipeline has long been under construction and can no longer so easily be he added trump s threats are no reason for germany refuses to join opposition to the project from many eu states and thus far from the eu executive describing it as a private enterprise
washington is concerned that the pipeline which will bypass ukraine by running under the baltic sea will strip ukraine of important transit revenue and says moscow is using the project to divide europe
ukraine derives up to percent of its gross domestic product gdp from transit charges
construction of the project is progressing
oettinger a german pressed russian gas giant gazprom which is leading the project to agree a fair deal on the further use of the existing pipelines through ukraine
gazprom is the sole shareholder in nord stream shouldering half of the billion euro billion construction cost
gazprom s european partners are germany s uniper and wintershall group royal dutch shell france s engie and austria s omv
