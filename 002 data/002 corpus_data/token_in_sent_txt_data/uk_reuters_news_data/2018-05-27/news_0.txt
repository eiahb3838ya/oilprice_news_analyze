as clock ticks, doubts grow over kinder morgan's canada oil pipe expansion
manitoba reuters as a hard deadline set by kinder morgan canada ltd for scrapping a key pipeline expansion looms there is growing doubt among investors contractors and government officials about reaching a deal to save the c billion billion project
the company a unit of kinder morgan inc set a may deadline to decide if it will proceed with the expanded line from edmonton alberta to a port in the vancouver area which would give landlocked canadian crude greater access to foreign markets
the project s fate will create political ripples in ottawa where justin trudeau s liberals have promised the pipeline will be built one way or another and sway investor confidence in canada s oil sands which already produce far more oil than can move on pipelines
building more pipelines was a cornerstone of trudeau s energy policy
but the federal government is increasingly convinced that any assurances ottawa gives kinder morgan will be rejected said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter
they are not authorized to speak publicly
investors and project contractors are also increasingly pessimistic
i can t walk out of my office or have a beer with someone where a conversation around this doesn t occur said rafi tahmazian senior portfolio manager at canoe financial which manages shares of several canadian oil producers
i m worried very worried that kinder will walk kinder morgan canada declined to comment
if trans mountain fails it would be the third major canadian export pipeline project to stall in two years putting greater pressure on canadian heavy crude prices that already trade at a discount to global prices due to limited transport
kinder morgan set the deadline in part due to frustrations with delays caused by british columbia government which is concerned about possible oil spills
trudeau has publicly vowed to build the pipeline with or without kinder and offered to indemnify the company against losses related to s delays
kml s share price has fallen percent since early april when the company halted all work underperfoming a percent rise in the benchmark canada share index
we think the stock itself is pricing in a less than chance of the project going ahead said matthew murphy an analyst with investment bank tudor pickering holt and danny mott owner of mott electric the electrical contractor on trans mountain said he does not think the federal government has done enough to enforce its jurisdiction nor to crack down on protesters who block access to kinder morgan work sites on a basis
if we don t have strong laws and the intent to follow through with them i wouldn t invest in that
i think i would walk away he said
