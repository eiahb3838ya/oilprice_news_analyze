hundreds of workers on norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal closing shell s knarr field which produces barrels of oil equivalent per day
one of the unions safe plans to escalate actions from monday sunday gmt and send more workers on strike
the stoppage will have no immediate extra impact on oil and gas output
the norwegian association said it planned no contact to resolve the strike before the deadline and was considering countermeasures instead
a middle way is not a solution
our position is unchanged
i don t think that there will be any contact during the weekend the association chief negotiator jakob korsgaard told reuters
the safe union also told reuters on saturday that it expected no contact before the planned escalation
the employees who will join the action work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by saipem transocean songa offshore odfjell drilling archer and cosl among others
chief executive john lechner of archer from which more than workers plan to strike hitting drilling operations and possibly future output from aker bp s wells in valhall field also said he did not know of any efforts to resolve the standoff
the employers who say workers already have fair wages are considering countermeasures if the strike doesn t end soon
obviously a conflict like this can not go on for ever
all are considered said korsgaard without giving details
in employers threatened to shut down all oil and gas operations in norway after a strike choked off percent of the country s output
in that strike the government ordered offshore workers back to work to avoid a total shutdown invoking laws that allow it to end strikes that threaten big economic damage
the government has that measure if they find it relevant said korsgaard
