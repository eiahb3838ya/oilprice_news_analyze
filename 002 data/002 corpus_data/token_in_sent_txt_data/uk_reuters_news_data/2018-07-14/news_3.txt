czech pm says cez could expand in nuclear via subsidiary - paper
prague reuters czech prime minister andrej babis said utility cez could expand its nuclear capacity via a subsidiary and reiterated his opposition to splitting the company
babis s government postponed a decision on building new nuclear units in may saying it needed more time to evaluate the impact on its budget and find out european union views on state aid for such a project
cez operates two nuclear power plants in the eu member country in dukovany and temelin
it is a simple operation
i would take dukovany appraise it put it into a subsidiary run a tender for a supplier financing and possibly even a babis said in an interview published on saturday by the mlada fronta dnes daily paper
let cez guarantee that so that is has good conditions
and to make it even better and more serious the state can be the second one guaranteeing babis said
besides splitting cez which babis has opposed and a subsidiary building the new blocs his government has been working on one more option that the government could buy a small cez unit to build the plants
cez chief executive daniel benes has said that a part of cez would be best placed to build the new nuclear blocs
the nuclear project and other matters have been on the since october as czechs did not have a government until thursday when babis s second minority government leaning on communists finally got the backing of parliament
cez has refused to invest into new plants without some form of state support
