nasa launches probe to go deep into sun's scorching atmosphere
reuters nasa launched a space probe early sunday that will go closer to the sun than any spacecraft before the agency announced
the craft will endure extreme heat while zooming through the solar corona to study the sun s outer atmosphere that gives rise to the solar winds
the parker solar probe a spacecraft the size of a small car launched from cape canaveral in florida about sunday on a mission
it is set to fly into the sun s corona within million miles million km of the solar surface seven times closer than any other spacecraft
the corona gives rise to the solar wind a continuous flow of charged particles that permeates the solar system and can cause havoc with communications technology on earth
nasa hopes the findings will enable scientists to forecast changes in earth s space environment
the project with a billion billion pounds price tag is the first major mission under nasa s living with a star program
the probe named after american solar astrophysicist eugene newman parker will have to survive difficult heat and radiation conditions
it has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius at its closest pass
