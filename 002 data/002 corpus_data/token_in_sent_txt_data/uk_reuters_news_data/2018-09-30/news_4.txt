the general strike has been suspended not called off said chris uyot deputy secretary general of the nigerian labour congress
a meeting with the government will be held on the union said in a letter to members
unions want the monthly minimum wage raised to about naira from naira
the strike began on thursday after talks between president muhammadu buhari s government and unions had broken down
in the letter the nlc said the meeting was as a result of united and sustained action adding that the suspension was part of an attempt to provide a conducive atmosphere for the talks to reach a satisfactory conclusion
unions and state councils are requested to maintain a high level of vigilance and mobilization until the struggle for a reasonable minimum wage is successfully concluded the letter stated
evidence suggested patchy adherence to the strike and its impact on the economy has been difficult to calculate
president buhari had promised to review the minimum wage after a fuel price hike and currency devaluation in the last two years
those were aimed at countering the effects of a global oil price plunge on nigeria
buhari s handling of the economy and the cost of living since he took office in has become a campaign issue in the build up to the country s presidential election which is scheduled to take place in february
nigeria s ruling all progressives congress party on saturday nominated buhari as its candidate to stand for in next year s poll after he ran unopposed in a nationwide primary to select a candidate
the main opposition people s democratic party has not yet selected a candidate
