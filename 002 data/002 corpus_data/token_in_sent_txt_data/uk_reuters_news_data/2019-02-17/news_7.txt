indonesian presidential hopefuls vow energy self-sufficiency through palm
jakarta feb reuters indonesia s two presidential candidates pledged on sunday to achieve energy by boosting the use of bioenergy particularly fuelled by palm oil to cut costly oil imports by southeast asia s biggest economy
indonesia the world s biggest palm oil producer has been pushing for all diesel fuel used in the country to contain biodiesel to boost palm consumption slash fuel imports and narrow a yawning current account gap
in a televised election debate president joko widodo said if he won a second term the government planned to implement a programme referring to fuel made entirely from palm oil after last year making it mandatory to use biodiesel containing percent
we hope percent of total palm production will go to biofuel
the plan is clear so we will not rely on imported oil widodo said adding that indonesia s crude palm oil production had reached million tonnes a year
agreeing on the importance of bioenergy for his opponent prabowo subianto said if elected he would also boost the use of palm oil palm sugar cassava and ethanol from sugar cane
the challenger did not elaborate on his bioenergy plan but his campaign team has proposed using millions of hectares of degraded land to cultivate palm sugar to produce energy
widodo s government has previously said it would offer incentives for developers of which the net oil importer hopes can replace fuel imports within three years
indonesia s state energy company pt pertamina has signed an agreement with italian oil company eni to develop a refinery in indonesia that would produce fuel completely derived from crude palm oil cpo
oil imports have contributed to indonesia s widening current account deficit and the volatility of the rupiah currency
the government claimed that its biodiesel programme would save billions of dollars in diesel fuel imports
although retired general prabowo agreed with widodo on several points during the debate he said indonesia s land and water and the resources within must be controlled by the government
we are of the view that the government must be present in detail thoroughly firmly and actively to correct inequalities in wealth he said
the challenger said the proportion of small farmers holdings in the country s palm plantations should also be larger
smallholders currently account for roughly percent of indonesia s million hectares of palm oil plantations
both candidates expressed support for greater control of indonesian natural resources
president widodo hightlighted pertamina s takeover of stewardship of major oil and gas blocks from foreign operators and an agreement for a state company to purchase a percent stake in the giant grasberg copper mine from freeport mcmoran
