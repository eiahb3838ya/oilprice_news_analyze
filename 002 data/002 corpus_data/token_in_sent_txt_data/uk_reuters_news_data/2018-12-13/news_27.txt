maldives tells un climate talks: "we are not prepared to die"
katowice poland reuters the maldives will do all in its power to keep our heads above water the head of its delegation at climate talks said on thursday in an impassioned appeal for nations to overcome their divisions over how to tackle global warming
the maldives is among countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and coral reef deterioration
we are not prepared to die
we are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis
instead we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water mohamed nasheed told delegates at the talks in katowice poland
climate change is a national security issue for us
it is an existential threat he said adding that a rise in global temperatures could still be avoided but countries had to unite
nasheed was the maldives first democratically elected leader but was ousted in in a coup imprisoned then granted asylum in britain
the maldives current president ibrahim mohamed solih invited nasheed to head the country s negotiating delegation at the katowice talks which are aimed at agreeing rules for implementing the paris agreement on climate change
with less than two days until the conference is formally scheduled to end delegates are still grappling with many issues not just how the accord will be implemented including finance strengthening emissions cuts and monitoring action
a draft more concise text of the deal should be available later on thursday but it is expected to still be laden with brackets for wording to be decided on and gaps
since last addressing a climate conference in nasheed said he had been deposed in a coup imprisoned and then forced into exile
but almost years since i was last at these climate negotiations i must say nothing much seems to have changed
we are still using the same old dinosaur language he said
carbon emissions are rising rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking talking and reporting by nina chestney and bate felix editing by gareth jones
