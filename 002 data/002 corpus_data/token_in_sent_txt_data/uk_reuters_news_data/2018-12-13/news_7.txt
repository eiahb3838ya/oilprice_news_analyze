fiat chrysler may review $5.7 bln plan if italy taxes diesel, petrol cars
milan reuters fiat chrysler fca could review its billion euro billion pounds italian investment plan which includes a shift to cleaner engines if rome raises taxes on petrol and diesel cars
were these measures to be confirmed as of a thorough examination of their impact and an update to plans already announced would be necessary fca s europe head pietro gorlier said in a letter to government representatives in the northern piedmont region where some of the new investment would be targeted
in an amendment to the budget law passed in italy s lower house last week the government approved subsidies of up to euros for lower emission vehicles but included a surcharge of up to euros on petrol and diesel cars
however the government immediately vowed to change it in the senate where it will be voted on next after one of the ruling parties contested the measure
italy s ruling parties the movement and the league have been at odds over the issue with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars while the has encouraged the new rules
unions and auto sector associations have also warned about the proposed new tax saying it would hurt not only the carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs
fca said last month it plans to spend more than billion euros on new models and cleaner engines in italy over the next three years to boost jobs and profitability
leader luigi di maio has since said the government would seek to improve the measures to not harm families in difficulties and to not create a shock to the italian economy
we will find a solution without damaging or causing a shock to companies industrial plans di maio said when asked about gorlier s letter
possible changes to the amendment could result in the exclusion of vehicles from the proposed tax government officials have said
the sector scenario has been significantly modified by interventions in the car market under discussion in the budget law which in our opinion alter the whole framework within which we outlined our plan for italy fca s gorlier said
at the moment we do not yet have visibility on what the regulatory scenario will be in the coming years he added
