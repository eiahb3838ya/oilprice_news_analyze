u.s. solar takes hit from trump tariffs but is cheaper than ever -report
reuters solar installations fell percent in the third quarter as the trump administration s tariffs on panels forced developers to put off large projects according to a report commissioned by the industry s primary trade group
current weakness in the market however will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever the report said
quarterly installations of solar were megawatts the lowest quarter since and a more than percent decline from a year ago the report by wood mackenzie for the
solar energy industries association said
the total market which includes residential and commercial installations came in at gigawatts
the slowdown is a shift for solar which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade
through the first three quarters of the year solar accounted for percent of electricity generating capacity additions
large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the percent tariffs as panels can account for up to half their costs
trump announced the levy on all imported solar panels in january his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping manufacturers rebound from years of decline
solar installers opposed the move because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels
most of the panels installed in the united states are made in asia by companies including china s jinkosolar holding co ltd canadian solar inc and sunpower wood mackenzie lowered its forecast to gw from gw as more projects get pushed into
the firm raised its forecasts for through by a combined gw however as utilities procure projects that will qualify for a federal tax credit that begins to phase out in
developers will start projects next year but delay buying modules until or later because the tariff drops by percent each year
sliding solar panel prices are also spurring demand from utilities
a move by china earlier this year to slash subsidies for solar installations has unleashed a flood of panels onto the global market pushing down prices
solar energy system prices are at historical lows in all segments of the market the report said
module prices are down more than percent from a year ago
