rpt-insight-vitol, rival oil traders in spotlight of brazil bribery probe
sao reuters brazil s epic car wash corruption investigation has taken down presidents and elite businessmen and led to the largest corporate leniency deal ever signed
but graft allegations lodged by prosecutors last week against four of the world s largest oil trading companies vitol sa trafigura glencore plc and mercuria energy group have opened an explosive new phase in the probe
federal prosecutors allege the european multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least million in bribes over a period to employees at brazil s oil company petrobras to sell them oil at sweetheart prices
they said the firms top brass had total and unequivocal knowledge that they were fleecing petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing
more than pages of legal documents reviewed by reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by creativity competition and greed
authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries
emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections authorities said
some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked petrobras employees
prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favor of the big firms
some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals
one intermediary griped that vitol was not at all sentimental and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns
now you are the flavor of the month next month there is a new flavor the middleman lamented in the email
brazilian authorities last week searched the rio de offices of vitol trafigura and glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme
police said they could not locate a physical office in brazil for mercuria
no charges have been filed
mercuria has denied wrongdoing
mercuria vitol and glencore said they would cooperate with the brazilian investigation while trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations
trafigura mercuria and vitol said they have policies for bribery and corruption
glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously
petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption
eight people have been arrested including two employees of petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities the company said in a written statement
interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside brazil including a petrobras trader based in houston
none have been arrested
the european firms vitol is based in london the three others in switzerland are powerhouses in commodities trading
they have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world including in brazil
together they control about percent of the world s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than argentina s gross domestic product
brazilian federal judge gabriela hardt as part of her legal order authorizing last week s arrests and search warrants wrote there is proof the companies and their affiliates paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from petrobras to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the the stakes are high for the trading firms
the probe could jeopardize their current and future business in brazil an increasingly important global oil producer
a consortium has a billion deal pending to purchase petrobras stake in prized nigerian oilfields
the new developments also signal that brazil s landmark car wash probe may be far from over
launched in to investigate contracting graft at petrobras the juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures including the former presidents of brazil and peru
brazil s odebrecht sa latin america s largest construction firm in cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least billion for its role in a massive ring
foreign firms are now in the crosshairs said prosecutor athayde ribeiro costa who is heading the latest phase of the probe
all foreign companies that have done business with petrobras in the past years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations to have confidence that they are not exposed to car wash costa told reuters
he said several foreign oil companies had already approached brazilian prosecutors to sound them out about leniency deals
costa would not disclose names of the firms
some of brazil s political class have maneuvered to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralyzed key sectors of the economy
but jair bolsonaro who takes office on is under pressure from the public to keep going
he has chosen sergio moro a crusading judge who led car wash to be brazil s next justice minister
car wash will continue its brutal transformation of brazil s corporate culture said carlos melo a political scientist with insper a leading brazilian business school
it is not going to costa said the supply and refining units at petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery
traders in the company s offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from petrobras executives he said
because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on liters costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved
brazilian authorities allege that petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate and also sold them petrobras oil products and storage leases at rates hurting the firm s bottom line authorities said
prosecutors say trafigura vitol glencore and mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with petrobras insiders
authorities allege the illicit funds moved through and european banks among others
a pivotal figure brazilian authorities allege was bo hans wilhelm ljungberg an independent oil broker who operated out of rio de janeiro
they say he was a key agent who secured business for vitol and other firms by funneling bribes to petrobras traders in particular to one in houston
vitol s first business relationship with ljungberg dates back to the when it bought one of his companies more recently he acted as an agent vitol said
an interpol alert has been issued for ljungberg who prosecutors said returned to sweden
he did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents nor to messages sent to social media accounts
prosecutors allege vitol paid just over million to offshore trading entities that ljungberg called encom trading sa and celixore ab to secure deals with petrobras between and
prosecutors showed reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms accounts
judge hardt s ruling said that one of vitol s top executives mike loya head of the firm in the united states was fully aware that ljungberg was securing vitol s business through bribes based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the swede about the alleged scheme
loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media
as for trafigura prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe petrobras employees
judge hardt s order alleges that mariano marcondes ferraz a former trafigura top executive and marcio pinto magalhaes a local country representative funneled bribes to petrobras employees between and september
lawyers for ferraz and magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment
ferraz is already serving a sentence in brazil for bribing a former petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company decal do brasil
he was arrested in late and resigned from trafigura
prosecutors allege that magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies including glencore s subsidiary chemoil
apart from payments via magalhaes glencore subsidiaries paid million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed petrobras officials the judge s ruling said
prosecutors say that they know the least about mercuria s dealings with petrobras
they said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company s representatives in brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals
