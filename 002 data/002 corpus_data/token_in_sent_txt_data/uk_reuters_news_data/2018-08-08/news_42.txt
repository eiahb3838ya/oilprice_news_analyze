update 1-china defends iran business ties after trump threat
beijing reuters china s business ties with iran are open transparent and lawful its foreign ministry said on wednesday after president donald trump said companies doing business with iran would be barred from the united states
new sanctions on iran have taken effect despite pleas from washington s allies
iran dismissed a offer from the trump administration for talks saying it could not negotiate while washington had reneged on a deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on iran s nuclear programme
trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had the deal including washington s main european allies britain france and germany as well as russia and china
beijing has cultivated close commercial links with tehran especially in the energy sector
china has consistently opposed unilateral sanctions and jurisdiction the chinese foreign ministry said in a faxed statement to reuters responding to questions on the new sanctions and trump s threats on firms doing business with iran
china s commercial cooperation with iran is open and transparent reasonable fair and lawful not violating any united nations security council resolutions it added
china s lawful rights should be china iran s top oil customer buys roughly barrels a day of crude oil from tehran or percent of china s total crude oil imports
at current market rates the imports are worth some billion billion a year
state energy firms cnpc and sinopec have invested billions of dollars in key iranian oil fields such as yadavaran and north azadegan and have been sending oil to china
european countries hoping to persuade tehran to continue to respect the nuclear deal have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out
but that has proven difficult and european companies have quit iran arguing that they can not risk their business
few american companies do much business in iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from washington s ability to block european and asian firms from trading there
among large european companies that have suspended plans to invest in iran are france s oil major total and its big carmakers psa and renault
