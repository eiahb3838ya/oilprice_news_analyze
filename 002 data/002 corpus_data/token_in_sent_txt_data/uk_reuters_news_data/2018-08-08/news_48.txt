lng export volumes fall to low in july petronas yet to resume ops at gas pipeline after leak source petronas says no disruption to cargo deliveries by jessica jaganathan singapore aug reuters malaysia s exports of liquefied natural gas lng fell to a low in july as domestic gas pipeline issues plaguing the country since january took their toll according to industry sources and thomson reuters data
natural gas supply from the sabah oil and gas terminal to the petronas lng complex in bintulu was cut in january following a gas leak in the kilometre pipeline which transports gas from kimanis in sabah to the bintulu plant in sarawak for processing

petronas did not comment on the pipeline issue but a spokeswoman said that there is no disruption to cargo deliveries from the petronas lng complex in bintulu and that operations at the complex are being carried out as scheduled
the petronas lng complex which has a capacity of million tonnes per annum mtpa comprises three lng plants owned and operated by petronas and joint venture companies
it is supplied with gas from several facilities off sarawak according to the company website
malaysia s lng exports fell to about million tonnes in july the data showed the lowest since july when it was about million tonnes
petronas has purchased replacement cargoes to meet some of its contractual obligations to term customers one source said which would reduce spot exports as a result
the drop in export volumes comes at a time when demand from japan the world s biggest importer of lng has been robust amid sweltering heat
overall the market is quite tight in terms of supply but new supply from australia should help going forward a trader said
