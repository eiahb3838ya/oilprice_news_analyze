feature-green, green hills: pakistan's incoming government pledges to plant billions of trees
islamabad aug thomson reuters foundation pakistan s government which is expected to be sworn in within days with cricket legend imran khan as prime minister will plant billions of trees to tackle the effects of climate change
malik amin aslam who is tipped to become environment minister said the billion tree tsunami programme would see trees planted nationwide including in the four provincial capitals
that follows a vast project in recent years in khyber pukhtunkwa province by khan s pakistan pti party
pti is a party with a green promise aslam said adding that the combination of environmental degradation and damage due to climate issues was costing percent of pakistan s billion economy annually
aslam said the country was spending one billion rupees million a day on issues arising from environmental neglect
climate change is only making it worse aslam told attendees at a discussion on the environment and climate change at the sustainable development policy institute sdpi a thinktank in islamabad on july
aslam told the thomson reuters foundation that khan believed climate change was an enormous challenge that had to be tackled head on
and aslam added khan felt the pti s green promise was central to how the party views a sustainable future for pakistan with cleaner air cleaner water and a country prepared to face up to and combat climate change
khan s party won seats of the seats in parliament in the july poll while the party of ousted and jailed premier nawaz sharif trailed in second with seats
in khan s pti won enough seats in khyber pukhtunkwa s assembly to form the provincial government
it introduced a initiative to tackle deforestation build more hydroelectric projects and overhaul national parks
the billion tree tsunami project was part of that initiative
aslam the project s architect said it had changed the province s landscape
he said pakistan needs to do more
pakistan s green cover is going down
our cities have become concrete jungles and there is increasing air pollution
our mode of development is wrong aslam said
at the pti s launch of its first days agenda held a month before the july ballot khan told the audience of party members and media that global warming is a reality
we will be badly affected we can counter it with trees
growing trees is not a luxury it is for our khan lauded his provincial government s project which he said had met its targets percent from planting trees and the remainder from assisting the natural regeneration of existing forests
pakistani climate expert adil najam who is dean of boston university s pardee school of global studies said the pti had made the environment especially planting trees its issue
and it has demonstrated that you can get political mileage from environmental issues he said describing that as a major step forward
this also comes at a time when the public awareness of these issues especially water and climate concerns are on the rise
so there is certainly the potential of he said the key test would be keeping the political focus on the policy and ensuring action
experts say pakistan is facing enormous environmental challenges
a survey conducted by the sdpi ahead of the poll found that respondents prioritized three key environmental issues rising temperatures water shortages and air pollution
aslam said pti s experience in delivering on the green agenda for khyber pukhtunkwa province had put it in good stead to do so nationally
we set out targets in clean energy forests clean water and we met them he said adding that the province s project had been the largest in the country s history and had met its targets using just half the allocated budget
the pti s days agenda document also stated it would establish a task force to draft green legislation and devise more projects
kashmala kakakhel a climate finance expert who helped with the days agenda document said thinking on climate change needed to evolve from piecemeal interventions to a guiding principle for pakistan s development agenda
we need to recognise it as an economic opportunity with an immense potential for job creation she said
this government plans to review or develop new targets for our renewable energy mix for increasing our forest cover for developing along a climate resilient she pointed out that once targets were set nationally specific interventions could be designed
this will also aid in identifying which interventions we can fund ourselves and for which ones we will need to tap into international climate finance funding aslam also said the new government wanted to green the economic corridor cpec a infrastructure project
he said that while visiting china in his capacity as the of the international union for conservation of nature iucn a he had been amazed at the astronomical changes underway as china cleans up its environment
we would like to strive for a green charter for cpec he said
despite the pti s green focus pakistan remains committed under cpec to developing its lignite coal reserves in the thar desert with two coal power plants already functional according to cpec s website
coal is an issue aslam admitted adding that pakistan could look to counter pollution by introducing environmental controls
the head of the sdpi s study centre shakeel ramay said coal s share of the country s energy mix is less than percent
for the time being coal is an option and pakistan should benefit from it as others have he said
however in the long run pakistan must look for renewable sources of energy he said
