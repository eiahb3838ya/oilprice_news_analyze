coal lobby's push for lower black lung tax clashed with u.s. studies
reuters coal companies lobbied congress to allow a drop in their payments to help miners with black lung disease by arguing the incurable ailment was in decline and a victims trust fund was financially healthy assertions contradicted by government findings according to documents seen by reuters
coal companies are currently required to pay a tax of per ton on underground production to finance the federal black lung disability trust fund which pays medical and living expenses for some eligible miners and their families
that excise tax is scheduled to revert to the level of cents per ton at the start of
a bipartisan effort earlier this year to extend the higher rate failed though lawmakers may raise the issue again in the coming months
changing the schedule now would effectively impose a tax increase on an industry struggling to recover from the regulatory excesses of the past administration national mining association president hal quinn wrote in a june letter to
representatives kevin brady of texas and virginia foxx of north carolina both republicans
brady is the chairman of the powerful ways and means committee and foxx heads the education and the workforce committee
an accompanying on the issue which was also seen by reuters included the assertion that black lung was in decline and that the trust fund would be in good stead without an extension of the excise tax
despite a decline in medical black lung disease claim approvals have skyrocketed the nma said in the pamphlet
it also stated the tax even at the reduced rate that will go into effect on january is more than sufficient to provide monthly disability benefits for the trust fund
at the time the nma sent the documents government research showed incidents of black lung disease which was nearly eradicated in the rising rather than falling
in february for example the national institute for occupational safety and health confirmed cases of advanced black lung disease in three clinics in rural virginia from to the highest concentration ever seen
it also confirmed many hundreds of other cases in southwestern virginia southern west virginia and eastern kentucky
the labor department also found that nearly half the benefits claims from miners with the worst form of black lung disease had been made since according to kirsten almberg an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the university of illinois at chicago who analyzed the data in a study earlier this year
last month the niosh issued a more comprehensive report showing more than percent of america s coal miners with or more years of experience have black lung disease the highest rate recorded in roughly two decades
nma spokeswoman ashley burke said the letter and pamphlet accompanying it were sent to lawmakers before the latest niosh report and that previous studies had been unconvincing
prior data showed the heightened incidence of disease was localized to a small geographic region not national she wrote to reuters in an email
she said the nma was concerned by the latest niosh report but did not say whether the group had updated its lobbying materials
president donald trump has vowed to revive the ailing coal industry which has been shrinking for years under pressure from cheaper natural gas and advances in solar and wind energy
the assertion that the black lung trust fund would have more than enough money if the excise tax reverted to the lower level also clashes with government research
the government accountability office said in a june report that the fund would need a dollar taxpayer bailout if the coal production tax was not extended
with the scheduled tax rate decrease our moderate case simulation suggests that expected revenue will likely be insufficient to cover combined black lung benefit payments and administrative costs as well as debt repayment expenditures according to the report from the gao
nma s burke said the group had relied on its own calculations to conclude otherwise in the materials sent to lawmakers our calculations were based on current gao future the fund which was established in the is already roughly billion in debt because revenues have failed to keep up with outflows
the nma has repeatedly argued the fund is mismanaged and covers victims of lung disease caused by smoking not mining though medical experts have countered that it is easy to identify lung damage caused by coal dust in an
the national coalition of black lung and respiratory disease clinics and the appalachian citizens law center called the nma s lobbying materials misleading
while nma or any trade association has the right to defend the interests of the industry it represents it is unacceptable to attempt to mislead members of congress and their staff they said in a joint statement
