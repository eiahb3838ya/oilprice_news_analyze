china to slap additional tariffs on $16 bln worth of u.s. goods
reuters china is slapping additional tariffs of percent on billion billion worth of imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment the chinese commerce ministry said as the world s largest economies escalated their trade dispute
the tariffs will be activated on the ministry said the same day that the united states plans to begin collecting percent extra in tariffs on billion of chinese goods
the united states published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on tuesday
china s final list announced on wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in june which included crude oil
the number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to from in the june draft although the total value is unchanged
the action that prompted the chinese retaliation was the latest by president donald trump to put pressure on china to negotiate trade concessions after washington imposed tariffs on billion in goods last month
china has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any action
this is a very unreasonable practise the chinese commerce ministry said of the action on wednesday as it rolled out china s
to compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil china added fish meal wood waste paper and paper waste metal scraps and various types of bicycles and cars among other products
last week china proposed additional tariffs on another billion of goods after trump raised planned tariffs on billion worth of chinese imports to percent from percent
so far china has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on billion of goods representing the vast majority of its annual imports of american products
items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft
a spokeswoman for the trade representative s office could not immediately be reached for comment on china s retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger trump s next round of threatened tariffs on billion worth of chinese goods
ustr is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs which could reach percent due to end
it would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at customs and border protection to begin collecting the duties
gary hufbauer a senior fellow and trade expert at the peterson institute for international economics in washington said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions
my expectation is that tariffs on billion of imports from china will be in effect about a month prior to the november elections
that s soon enough to be used by trump as a rallying argument but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before january
of course china will retaliate probably dollar for dollar hufbauer said
china however would run out of imports to levy as it bought only billion worth of american goods last year
it would likely have to impose penalties on companies doing business in china to make up the difference
