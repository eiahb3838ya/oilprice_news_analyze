update 2-turkey to continue buying natural gas from iran despite u.s. sanctions
ankara reuters turkey will continue to buy natural gas from iran in line with its supply contract turkey s energy minister said on wednesday a day after president donald trump threatened that anyone trading with iran will not do business with america
nato member turkey is dependent on imports for almost all of its energy needs and iran is a key supplier of ankara s natural gas and oil purchases
while the turkish refiner tupras has already cut back on oil shipments from tehran a complete halt of energy imports would be near impossible
energy minister fatih donmez told a haber broadcaster that he expected ankara s talks with washington on the issue to yield a positive outcome
a delegation of ours is in the united states right now and negotiations are being held on a series of matters including the sanctions issue donmez told broadcaster a haber
i think a good outcome will emerge from this a turkish delegation is visiting washington this week to discuss growing friction between the nato allies according to reports on tuesday while washington said the two countries remained at odds on its core demand that ankara free american evangelical pastor andrew brunson
donmez said turkey s supply contract with the islamic republic was valid until and ankara was set to buy the billion cubic meter of the contract amount
we will be continuing this trade as we can t possibly leave our citizens in dark he said
nearly percent of turkey s electricity production is sourced with natural gas
president donald trump pulled out of a deal to curb iran s nuclear program and said firms doing business with tehran would be barred from the united states as new sanctions against iran took effect on tuesday
the sanctions target iran s purchases of dollars metals trading coal industrial software and the auto sector and did not include iran s oil exports but global oil prices rose on tuesday in anticipation
sanctions on iran s energy sector are set to be after a period ending on
anyone doing business with iran will not be doing business with the united states trump tweeted on tuesday
turkey s biggest oil importer tupras has cut back purchases of iranian crude since may and analysts say tupras is likely to stick to lower volumes in coming months
donmez described the sanctions as unilateral
even european union eu is extremely annoyed by this
we are conducting legitimate trade here he said
and this is important for us in terms of supply security as pulling out of the iran agreement trump has ignored pleas from the other world powers that had the deal including washington s main european allies britain france and germany as well as russia and china
european countries hoping to persuade tehran to continue to respect the deal have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out
but that has proven difficult european companies have quit iran arguing that they can not risk their business
