update 1-iran says opec may need extraordinary meeting over output changes
adds quote opec sources background dubai aug reuters iran s oil minister said opec may need to hold an extraordinary meeting should the organisation of oil producers fail to prevent member countries from adjusting their crude production without approval the shana news agency reported on wednesday
after months of underproduction the organization of the petroleum exporting countries agreed with russia and other allies to raise output from july by returning to percent compliance with previously decided cuts
that would mean an output increase of roughly million barrels per day
minister bijan zanganeh sent a letter of complaint to his united arab emirates counterpart after noticing that some opec members were trying to adjust output the iranian agency said
zanganeh told uae energy minister suhail who holds the opec presidency in that an committee that monitors output compliance known as the jmmc should not distribute output increases among other producers
in case the jmmc does not fulfil its mandate and has a different understanding from the decision of the opec conference the issue should be raised at an extraordinary meeting of the opec conference for zanganeh wrote
opec sources however played down the possibility of an extraordinary meeting
there is no need one opec source said
zanganeh s comments underline the tensions after opec s june meeting
saudi arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more to meet the group s overall conformity level meaning some members such as itself could make up for shortfalls elsewhere
iran which faces sanctions disagreed and criticised saudi plans to boost output above targeted levels
the jmmc is chaired by saudi arabia and is due to meet next on in algeria
iran is not on the committee which also includes russia the uae oman kuwait algeria and venezuela
last month zanganeh told his saudi counterpart that the opec supply pact does not give member countries the right to raise oil production above their targets
