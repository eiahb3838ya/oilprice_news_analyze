rpt-insight-inside tesla's troubled new york solar factory
repeats for additional clients with no changes to text by salvador rodriguez and nichola groom san angeles aug reuters tesla inc s production of solar roof tiles has been delayed by problems at its new publicly subsidized factory and difficulties producing a product that satisfies the aesthetic demands of ceo elon musk eight former and current employees of both companies told reuters
repeated since the buffalo new york plant opened last year have forced tesla s partner in the joint venture panasonic to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to tesla according to a panasonic employee a former panasonic employee and a former tesla employee
the issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in tesla s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for million in state subsidies
the production challenges add to doubts over tesla s solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its electric vehicles which have also seen repeated production delays
tesla acquired the solar business in in a controversial billion purchase of solarcity a sales and installation company founded by two of musk s cousins but the business has been shrinking ever since
for a graphic showing the decline in tesla solar business see the solar roof produced at the new york factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity a combination that has proved challenging
aesthetic look is the key point that elon is always not satisfied with said another former tesla employee who works in fremont california
that s the big in a call with tesla investors last week musk said hundreds of homes already had solar roofs but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to reuters saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were being scheduled for in california the nation s leading solar market there were twelve tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of may all in northern california according to records from the state s three utilities
the cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly according to the records
that s about double the national average for solar systems
tesla began accepting deposits from customers for the solar roofs in may seven months after it unveiled a prototype
tesla confirmed in a statement to reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the new york plant
we are steadily ramping up solar roof production in buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process the company said in the statement
we plan to ramp production more toward the end of the company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner panasonic which shares space in the factory and plans to produce tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs
panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to tesla panasonic said in a statement
it has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from tesla according to the panasonic employee and a former tesla employee
panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than tesla or signed alternate supply deals
we believe tesla will use panasonic cells when it the solar roof the company said in a statement
some new york state lawmakers worry tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain
the state provided million to build the factory along with million for equipment and million for additional specified scope costs according to a tesla filing with the securities and exchange commission
the subsidy package requires tesla to employ people in buffalo including at the plant within two years of the facility s completion and to spend billion in the state over a decade
empire state development the state s economic development arm is overseeing the agreement
the agency believes tesla is currently meeting its obligations said spokeswoman pamm lent adding that the company would face penalties of million a year if it falters
republican new york state assemblyman ray walter who represents a district near the factory said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in march
after investing million of taxpayer money we want it to work out he said
it just does not look like it s heading down that tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about people and is on track to meet all of its commitments
none of the tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted
they said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far one of four varieties tesla is marketing
several of the sources at the plant said musk had never visited the site tesla declined to comment
panasonic recently produced about conventional solar panels per day at the plant meant to be sold under the tesla brand and about photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof according to two panasonic sources one who recently left the company
that would put annualized production at about a quarter of tesla s target for the plant which is gigawatt per year by
and tesla isn t buying most of the cells being produced according to the panasonic employee
we have been entertaining outside customers the employee said
tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns using cells from ja solar because they reflect light differently said a current tesla employee and a former tesla employee
the current employee said a similar panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof
ja solar declined to comment
panasonic started cell production at the factory in february but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines the panasonic employee said
full production will restart in september the employee said
for now wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory according to the panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations
some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed two of the workers said
one of the few customers that has taken delivery of the solar roof is tri huynh who works in business development in silicon valley
huynh said he paid about for the system which included three tesla powerwall home batteries to store the power produced
it took two weeks and a dozen workers to install compared to a day for most traditional panel systems
it s fantastic
i love it he said adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs
i m a tech guy so i kind of wanted the latest warren jason a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an house in the hollywood hills is not so pleased
he put down to reserve a roof in early but it has not yet arrived and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers
we ve been begging tesla for information he said
it s been extremely additional reporting by makiko yamazaki and ritsuko ando in tokyo editing by richard valdmanis and brian thevenot
