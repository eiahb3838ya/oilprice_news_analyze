iran has nothing to be concerned about-supreme leader
beirut reuters supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the highest authority in iran said the country has nothing to be concerned about a report on his official website said on wednesday in an apparent reference to the imposition of strict sanctions this week
the sanctions imposed on tehran this week have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with iran
companies doing business with iran will be barred from the united states president donald trump said on tuesday
with regard to our situation do not be worried at all
nobody can do anything khamenei said recently the website reported
they can be sure
there is no doubt about this khamenei was quoted as saying in comments that appeared only a day after the new sanctions took effect
officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from iran in a bid to force tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programmes and involvement in regional conflicts in syria and iraq
these are the most biting sanctions ever imposed trump tweeted on tuesday
separately iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said wednesday that a plan to reduce iran s oil exports to zero will not succeed according to the iran newspaper
if the americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences zarif told the iran newspaper
they can t think that iran won t export oil and others will president hassan rouhani hinted last month that iran could block the strait of hormuz a major oil shipping route if the attempted to stop the islamic republic s oil exports
president donald trump responded by noting that iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the united states
the americans have assembled a war room against iran zarif said
we can t get drawn into a confrontation with america by falling into this war room trap and playing on a last month trump offered to meet iran s leaders
zarif said that oman and switzerland have acted as mediators in talks with america in the past but that there are currently no direct or indirect talks being held with the united states
rouhani speaking in a meeting with north korea s foreign minister on wednesday said that america can not be trusted according to the islamic republic news agency irna
today america is identified as an unreliable and untrustworthy country in the world which does not adhere to any of its obligations rouhani said
