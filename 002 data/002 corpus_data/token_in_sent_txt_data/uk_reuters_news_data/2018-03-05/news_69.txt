collapse of iran nuclear deal would be "great loss" -un watchdog chief
vienna march reuters any collapse of the nuclear deal between iran and major powers would be a great loss the head of the atomic agency policing the accord said on monday alluding to a threat to pull out of it
president donald trump has threatened to pull out of the deal unless congress and european allies help fix it with a agreement
international atomic energy agency chief yukiya amano whose agency is monitoring iranian compliance with curbs on its disputed nuclear activity imposed by the agreement has long called the deal a net gain for nuclear verification since it has provided the iaea with more thorough oversight of iran
but in a speech on monday to a quarterly meeting of the iaea s board of governors he went further evoking the possibility of the deal officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa unravelling
the jcpoa represents a significant gain for verification amano said according to a text of his speech published by his agency
if the jcpoa were to fail it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for amano said iran was implementing its commitments under the deal which also lifted painful economic sanctions against the islamic republic
he confirmed the findings of a quarterly confidential iaea report on iran issued last month
as mentioned in the report the iaea has requested clarification from iran about its plans to develop nuclear marine propulsion amano said suggesting the iaea has still not heard back from the islamic republic
the agency has requested iran to provide further clarifications regarding its plans relevant to the development of the nuclear fuel cycle related to naval nuclear propulsion amano told the meeting of member states
iran has long said publicly that it plans to develop nuclear propulsion for naval vessels but analysts and diplomats say remains a distant prospect
it formally notified the iaea of that intention in january in what was widely seen as a diplomatic warning shot aimed at the trump administration which reversed a policy of detente with iran introduced by his predecessor barack obama
but the move prompted the iaea to ask what exactly iran s plans are
france s foreign minister visited iran on monday on a delicate mission to affirm european support for the nuclear deal that opened up iran s economy while echoing concern about tehran s ballistic missile programme and role in middle east conflicts
