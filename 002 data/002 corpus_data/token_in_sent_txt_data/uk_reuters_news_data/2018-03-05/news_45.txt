update 1-oil demand growth to shift to petrochemicals away from motor fuels - iea
london reuters strong global demand for oil and gas will shift in the next five years toward petrochemicals and away from motor fuels gasoline and diesel the international energy agency iea said on monday
demand for products ranging from fertilisers to plastics and beauty products will drive roughly a quarter of the expected oil demand growth to the iea said in its outlook
the shift represents a major challenge to the oil industry as many of the petrochemicals will be produced using gas cutting out refineries
at the same time growth in gasoline and diesel usage will be held back by fuel efficiency improvements and declining consumption in the developed world the iea said
world oil demand is expected to rise by million barrels per day bpd to it said with a quarter of this growth or million bpd coming from demand for petrochemical feedstocks ethane and naphtha
global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services the iea said
a large group of chemicals derived from oil and natural gas are crucial to the manufacture of many products that satisfy this rising demand it added
naphtha is made by oil refineries processing crude but other petrochemical feedstocks ethane or liquefied petroleum gas lpg are processed outside traditional oil refineries
ethane liquefied petroleum gases and naphtha pose a bigger threat to the refiners market share than electric vehicles and transportation combined the iea said estimating refiners would see just million bpd of the demand growth to missing out on percent of it
the boom in shale oil has dramatically expanded the availability of ethane and a string of new projects on the gulf coast are underway to process it
in total the world is expected to add million bpd in new steam crackers to the iea said
demand for ethane will expand at the fastest pace in the next five years rising by bpd followed by naphtha with growth of bpd and lpg with growth of bpd it forecast
jet fuel supported by growing demand for air travel will grow by percent to the iea added
but it said demand for gasoline and diesel would rise by just percent each with expansion slowed by fuel efficiency standards that now cover two thirds of the world s top car markets
more than percent of global car sales are now in markets covered by efficiency standards including china india the united states and europe
the iea said this will impact strongly on future oil partially as a result the iea warned that refinery additions totaling million bpd would outstrip growth in demand for refined products by by some million bpd
the gap between refinery capacity growth and refined product demand growth has never been so large in recent history the iea said
