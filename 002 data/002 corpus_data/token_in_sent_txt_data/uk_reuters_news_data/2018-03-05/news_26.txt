update 4-iea sees u.s. oil output surge stealing opec share in next 5 years
reuters shale oil output is set to surge over the next five years stealing market share from opec producers and moving the united states once the world s top oil importer closer to self sufficiency the international energy agency said on monday
a landmark deal in between opec and rivals including russia to curb output to reduce global oversupply improved the outlook for other producers as prices rose sharply throughout the year the iea said in oil an annual report looking at the next five years
with supply surging the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will see demand for its crude fall below current production in and the report forecast suggesting a return to oversupply if opec output keeps steady
oil output hit a record late last year and is expected to rise by million barrels per day bpd to million bpd by as growth from shale fields more than offsets declines in conventional supply
last year the iea forecast shale production to grow by million bpd by with oil prices of up to a barrel and by up to million barrels with oil at a barrel
natural gas liquids will add another million bpd to supply to reach million bpd by
the united states is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years said fatih birol the iea s executive director in a statement
birol speaking at a media briefing at the ceraweek energy conference in houston said output forecasts could be revised upward if oil remains above a barrel
he said he expects shale output to keep rising regardless of opec policies and said opec and other established oil producers need to reconsider their future growth plans in light of huge growth from shale
he also said he expects export capacity to double over the next five years
with total liquids production set to reach nearly million bpd in up from million in the united states will be by far the world s top oil liquids producer
oil production growth from the united states brazil canada and norway will more than meet global oil demand growth through the iea said adding that more investment would be needed to boost output after that
production is set to rise by million bpd by to million bpd with the united states alone accounting for nearly percent of global supply growth
production in rose by bpd as drillers added rigs beating all expectations the iea said
output from opec producers will grow at a much slower pace the iea said adding it expected venezuelan production declines to accelerate offsetting gains in iraq
birol said venezuela s production outlook may need to be cut in coming years as well
as a result opec s crude oil capacity will grow by just bpd by the iea said
with shale and other supply rising demand for opec crude plus withdrawals from inventories will average million bpd in the iea said million bpd less than its last forecast
this is lower than demand of million bpd expected in and below the iea s latest estimate of opec s production of million bpd
with forecast capacity of million bpd opec will be supplying less than percent of global demand by compared to its historic share around percent
boosted by economic growth in asia and a resurgent petrochemicals industry global oil demand will increase by million bpd by to million according to the iea
despite steep oil production gains the iea warned that a decline in mature fields meant more investment was needed across the globe after
upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after it said
