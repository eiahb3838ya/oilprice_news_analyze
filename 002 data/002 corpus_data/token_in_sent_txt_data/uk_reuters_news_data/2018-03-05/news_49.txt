shell gives up on gaza's offshore gas field - palestinians
gaza march reuters royal dutch shell has given up its stake in an undeveloped natural gas field off the gaza strip sending the palestinians looking for a new foreign group to replace it palestinian officials said on monday
cabinet ministers from the palestinian authority said in a statement they had been informed that the energy giant was pulling out of the project and were now in the process of trying to attract a global company to take its place
shell had been struggling to find a buyer for its percent stake in the gaza marine field which it took over during its acquisition of bg group in
the company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment
gaza marine located about km miles off the gaza coast has long been seen as a golden opportunity for the palestinian authority to join the mediterranean gas bonanza providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid
plans to develop the field estimated to hold over trillion cubic feet of natural gas the equivalent of spain s consumption in were put off several times over the past decade
the delays were due to internal palestinian rivalry and conflict with israel as well as economic reasons
with shell s exit the palestine investment fund a sovereign wealth fund remains the sole stakeholder
a palestinian official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity told reuters that once a potential buyer is located they will discuss options of how much control of the project could be acquired
