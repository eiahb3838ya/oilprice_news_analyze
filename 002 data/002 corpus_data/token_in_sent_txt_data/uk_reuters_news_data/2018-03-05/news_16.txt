exclusive-chevron in talks to sell stake in canada lng project -sources
reuters chevron corp is exploring options including the sale of a minority stake in its canadian liquefied natural gas lng project as it pushes ahead three people familiar with the matter told reuters
among the parties in talks with chevron for a possible stake in kitimat lng are petroliam nasional bhd or petronas which scrapped its own billion lng project in british columbia last year due to challenging market conditions two of the people said
reuters spoke over the past week to the sources who said there is no certainty that chevron would proceed with the stake sale
the persons spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private
chevron declined to comment and petronas did not respond to a request for comment
chevron is also considering selling a stake in the project to a financial investor such as a canadian pension fund or a private equity firm the people added
canadian companies seven generations energy ltd and tourmaline oil corp are in discussions to supply natural gas to chevron s project the people said
seven generations may also consider buying a stake in the project by partnering with other gas producers the people said
while any possible deal with a financial investor would be strictly a cash infusion to help support the cost of building the project a deal with a producer could be structured as a commitment to supply natural gas to the plant for a period of to years the people said
canadian pension funds have a huge appetite for assets that offer stable cash flows over a long period and pipeline investments tend to have those attributes
the project in british columbia a joint venture with australia s woodside petroleum ltd has a export license for lng and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to build
kitimat could become one of the largest capital investments in a canadian energy project chevron says on its website
taking such a substantial investment decision has been difficult for the duo given concerns over a global lng supply glut for the last three years
fierce political opposition in western canada to building pipelines and other energy infrastructure has also escalated in the last several years
however surging gas demand from china and southeast asia is reassuring export project developers that the market cycle is finally beginning to turn
seven generations declined to comment and tourmaline did not respond to a request for comment
located about kilometers north of vancouver the kitimat project was earmarked to utilize shale gas extracted in the northern part of british columbia and export lng to markets in asia
san ramon chevron acquired its percent stake in kitimat in early from eog resources inc and encana corp
