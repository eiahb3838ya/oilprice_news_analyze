wrapup-ceraweek-shale boom, oil price stability dominate houston energy conference
houston reuters the world s largest oil producers appealed to shale producers to join their efforts to hold global prices at their current level at a major energy conference monday as the boom in shale is continuing to undermine opec s production curbs
opec secretary general mohammed barkindo said monday at the ceraweek conference in houston that there is a common understanding between nations and shale producers that we all belong to this industry even as exports have eroded opec s market share over the last year
this year s ceraweek conference continues outreach between the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and shale producers
members of opec will meet with shale producers on monday evening at a dinner for the second year in a row though barkindo said that price levels and production will not be discussed
however shale s surge in the last year was heavy on the minds at the houston conference particularly as production surged to an record late last year
nigeria s oil minister emmanuel ibe kachikwu was more explicit than barkindo saying that oil majors operating in both shale fields and in opec members should bear some responsibility for prices
we need to begin to look at companies that are very active in these areas and begin to get them to take some responsibilities in terms of stability of oil prices kachikwu told reuters on the sidelines of the ceraweek energy conference in houston though he did not name any specific companies
some of the same companies that are working in shale are the same companies working in opec member countries the price of oil rose steadily throughout in the wake an agreement between the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and including russia to cut production by million barrels a day beginning last year
that surge in prices however boosted production sharply which hit a record in november at more than million barrels a day and is expected to surpass million barrels a day later this year
going forward fatih birol head of the international energy agency said here in houston that shale growth may continue to rise regardless of opec policies warning that larger producers may need to reconsider their future growth given huge growth in shale
rising prices have shale producers pumping more while opec has maintained its price cuts with output from members at a low
the cartel s leaders have even expressed interest in keeping some production curbs in place through though suhail mohamed al mazrouei the united arab emirates oil minister said opec has not at this stage discussed extending cuts into next year
kachikwu said that the rapid growth in shale supply is not just a problem for opec it s a problem for the entire oil i don t think it requires pressure
i think the oil companies would be the first to tell you that stability in the oil price is important to them he said
oil majors however can not engage in supply restrictions to affect the price as the opec cartel does and some ministers on monday played down the idea that the growth of shale could not be handled
ecuador s oil minister carlos perez noted that shale fields tend to have lower total oil recovery than conventional fields
it has an impact but not the impact we expected
recovery factors are still low so right now there is no additional impact perez said
