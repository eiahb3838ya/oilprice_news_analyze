update 2-china to cut more coal, steel output to defend 'blue skies'
beijing reuters china s state planner pledged on monday to cut more steel and coal production capacity this year putting the country on track to beat its targets as beijing reinforced its vow to beat smog and make skies blue again
at the opening of the annual meeting of parliament the national development and reform commission ndrc said in a work report it will reduce steel capacity by around million tonnes and coal output by about million tonnes this year
the cuts would put the world s top steel maker and coal miner on track to meet its targets in the government s plan about two years ahead of schedule
the cutbacks came as premier li keqiang said in prepared remarks that the government would consolidate gains made in the country s fight against pollution to defend the blue of our skies
china planned to cut emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide major sources of hazardous airborne particles known as by percent this year li said
that s the same as the targets which were easily exceeded
elsewhere the ndrc report largely reiterated existing goals underscoring china s determination to crack down on pollution cut back supply in bloated heavy industries and upgrade energy sources by cutting coal use in favor of cleaner energy
in both steel and coal it has focused on shutting outdated more polluting plants while bringing on more efficient operations with lower emissions to ensure supply
steel output hit a record last year while coal production also rose
the cuts were higher than expected said zhang min a coal market analyst at china sublime information group
setting a high target this year showed the government is not slowing down the pace of reform for the two industries said zhang
ahead of targets cutting million tonnes of steel capacity in will bring the total reduction over three years to million tonnes
that will put china well ahead of a plan to reduce excess by up to million tonnes by to
steel rebar prices dipped percent in morning trade as the news was largely priced in after beijing flagged last month that it expected to meet the objective in
a cut of million tonnes of coal this year would bring the total cut since the start of to million tonnes well ahead of the plan by the world s top coal consumer to slash million tonnes of coal capacity by
thermal coal futures were down percent hitting their lowest since as concerns about falling demand offset news of the cuts
in china produced billion tonnes of coal in up percent from the previous year and a record million tonnes of steel
also in the report the government said it will shut power plants with capacity of less than kilowatts that fail to meet emission standards in
the ndrc said it also will continue to focus on merging and restructuring steel companies and guard against eliminated capacity coming back online
