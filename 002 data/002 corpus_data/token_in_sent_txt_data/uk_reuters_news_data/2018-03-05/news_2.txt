ceraweek-ecopetrol to focus on expansion, trade after budget cut -ceo
houston reuters colombia s ecopetrol sa will look for assets to buy this year and bid in oil auctions in the united states and latin america after emerging from a period of deep budget cutbacks chief executive felipe bayon told reuters on monday
low crude oil prices had forced ecopetrol and other oil companies in latin america to tighten their belts in recent years cutting exploration investment or delaying key projects and severely hitting output and refining
colombia s ecopetrol halted production at oilfields as it reduced spending
but its operations started expanding again last year when it reached a net profit the highest in the last four years
last year was a very good year for us
analysts were expecting a lower profit bayon said on the sidelines of the ceraweek energy conference in houston
the company expects its oil and gas production to remain flat or to rise slightly this year to barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd under an investment budget of billion almost completely focused on exploration and production
part of that spending will go to projects aimed at replenishing the firm s energy reserves including a pilot program to explore unconventional resources at the magdalena medio basin where ecopetrol estimates there could be up to billion barrels more than triple colombia s proven reserves
another part of the investment plan could go to bidding rounds in the gulf where it currently participates in two blocks as well as mexico brazil and argentina which plan oil and gas auctions this year
one of ecopetrol s main refineries the recently expanded cartagena has increased crude processing to barrels per day bpd while reducing the proportion of imported oil it needs to percent versus to percent a year ago bayon said
the cost of cartagena s modernization doubled to billion compared with the billion originally planned but it has made the company less dependent on imports while leaving a small fuel surplus for export
ecopetrol is also reducing the volume of imported naphtha it needs to dilute its heavy crude output by making changes at its transportation system according to bayon
using alternative transport has allowed it to avoid frequent declarations of force majeure on its crude exports when its cano pipeline is attacked by rebels which has happened times this year alone
bayon also said that tighter controls by the colombian government at the venezuelan border had cut gasoline imports increasing the domestic need for gasoline and other fuels in about bpd
ecopetrol s barrancabermeja refinery where workers recently went on strike due to a salary dispute is expected to restart its cracking unit in seven to days after completing maintenance work he said
