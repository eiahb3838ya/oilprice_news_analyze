adds zinke quote by valerie volcovici washington march reuters
interior secretary ryan zinke said on monday he has postponed a second federal oil and gas lease sale planned for march in less than a week in response to local opposition to the possibility of drilling near national parks and monuments
zinke said the interior s bureau of land management blm will remove acres out of the planned march sale of acres of federal land for oil and gas leases near the tourist city of livingston montana which is a gateway to the yellowstone national park
i ve always said there are places where it is appropriate to develop and where it s not
this area certainly deserves more study and appropriately we have decided to defer the sale zinke said in a statement
the remaining parcels which cover over acres will be offered for lease via an online auction as planned
the leases last for years
zinke s announcement came just four days after he made a similar surprise statement to the albuquerque journal postponing an oil and gas lease sale planned for march near new mexico s chaco canyon a unesco world heritage site which contains numerous anasazi ruins
we re going to defer those leases until we do some cultural consultation zinke told the newspaper
blm which oversees federal oil and gas leases received over protests about the sale and said it will complete an analysis of over cultural sites before it proceeds
in just over a year in office the trump administration has taken numerous steps to expand and speed up energy development on federal land
the blm last month quietly removed reforms to the leasing of federal land for oil and gas drilling in a move to simplify and streamline the process to speed up permitting of new lease sales
the move removed a policy aimed at including input from environmentalists and local tourist industry groups in the process of leasing federal land for drilling which the oil and gas industry said was and redundant
environmentalists said the change in policy means that places such as livingston need to rely on lawyers to help them win a pardon
the trump administration could have avoided this debacle if they hadn t eliminated policies that guarantee local communities a voice in where drilling should and shouldn t happen said kate kelly public lands director at the center for american progress
in southeastern utah local environmental and archaeological groups have protested a march auction of around acres near the former boundaries of the bears ears national monument reduced by percent last year by president donald trump that is known to contain significant cultural sites
zinke has not yet signaled whether he plans to delay that sale
kathleen sgamma president of industry group the western energy alliance said zinke likely felt pressure from communities that aren t used to development how it s done responsibly to protect the environment while coexisting with reporting by valerie volcovici editing by susan thomas and james dalgleish
