philippine judge rules out any china gas deal without sovereignty recognition
manila march reuters any deal between the philippines and a chinese firm to jointly explore for gas in the reed bank of the south china sea will be illegal unless china recognises the southeast asian nation s sovereign rights there a philippine judge said on monday
manila has identified two areas in the crowded waterway suitable for joint exploration and the two countries seek a way to tackle the diplomatic and legal headache of jointly exploring in the waters but without addressing the issue of sovereignty
the reed bank is claimed by both sides but international law says it falls within the exclusive economic zone eez of the philippines
china says it falls within the line on maps recording its historic rights in the area
antonio carpio the acting top judge of the supreme court said it was legal for the philippines energy ministry to talk to china national offshore oil corp cnooc as a possible
there s no problem as long as cnooc will recognize that that is our exclusive economic zone he told news channel anc in an interview
but that is the problem because cnooc will not recognise philippine jurisdiction carpio was speaking as an expert on international law and staunch advocate for the philippines to assert its maritime sovereignty claims
he was among the lawyers involved in the philippines legal challenge against china which manila brought to the permanent court of arbitration in the hague in
the tribunal in its ruling invalidated china s line making clear that the reed bank fell within the philippines eez and that manila had sovereign rights to resources there
china is a signatory to the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos but it does not recognise the hague court ruling
the stumbling block has always been the insistence of china that we recognise their sovereign rights carpio said
we can not do that anymore because there s already a ruling
and the philippine constitution says the state shall protect its marine wealth in its exclusive economic zone it s very the reed bank was the site of exploration by the philippines pxp energy corp to evaluate the block s gas reserves until the energy ministry suspended activities there in late because of the arbitration case
pxp has had talks with cnooc for possible joint exploration and development but the arbitration halted negotiations
carpio said who should collect taxes was also an issue between the two companies
last week philippine presidential spokesman harry roque said any potential deals between manila and beijing should be agreed with a company and not the chinese government
on monday he said the philippines and china would have to sign a treaty to enter into joint exploration and development in the reed bank
that s on the assumption that the reed bank is contested territory he told reporters
we have no treaty on joint exploration as of reporting by enrico dela cruz editing by clarence fernandez
