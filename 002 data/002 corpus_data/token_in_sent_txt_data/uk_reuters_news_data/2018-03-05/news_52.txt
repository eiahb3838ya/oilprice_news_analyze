update 2-collapse of iran nuclear deal would be 'great loss', iaea tells trump
vienna reuters a collapse of the iran nuclear deal would be a great loss the atomic watchdog s chief warned president donald trump on monday giving a defence of the accord and his agency s work under it
trump has threatened to withdraw the united states from the accord between tehran and six world powers signed in before he took office unless congress and european allies help fix it with a pact
trump does not like the deal s limited duration among other things
iran has stayed within the deal s restrictions since trump took office but has fired diplomatic warning shots at washington in recent weeks
it said on monday that it could rapidly enrich uranium to a higher degree of purity if the deal collapsed
if the jcpoa were to fail it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism international atomic energy agency iaea chief yukiya amano said in a speech to his agency s board of governors using the deal s official name the joint comprehensive plan of action
amano whose agency polices the deal s nuclear restrictions later gave his most defence of the accord to date listing numbers of buildings inspected images captured and even seals placed on equipment since the accord was put into effect
the iaea now has the world s most robust verification regime in place in iran
we have had access to all locations that we needed to visit the veteran japanese diplomat told a news conference after his speech
amano declined to comment on the position of the united states or any other country but his remarks were clearly a response to trump s threat to scupper the accord which also lifted painful economic sanctions against iran
we have carried out more than complementary accesses and visited more than buildings since jcpoa implementation day he said referring to a specific type of inspection under the iaea s additional protocol which iran is implementing under the deal
washington is telling european allies it wants a agreement that ensures strong iaea inspections according to a state department cable obtained by reuters last month
that suggests that from washington s standpoint there is something deficient about the current inspection system
trump and his ambassador to the united nations nikki haley have made similar comments
but diplomats familiar with the iaea s thinking have said the trump administration s view arises from a poor understanding of how the iaea does its work in iran
iran said on monday it could produce higher enriched uranium within two days if it were no longer bound by the deal
if america pulls out of the deal iran could resume its percent uranium enrichment in less than hours behrouz kamalvandi spokesman for the atomic energy organisation of iran told arabic language tv
iran is not allowed to enrich uranium beyond percent fissile purity under the deal a level that is suitable for fuelling some civilian nuclear power stations and far short of the percent that is considered weapons grade
kamalvandi reiterating tehran s official stance said the nuclear deal is not
the other countries that signed the deal germany britain france russia and china are committed to preserving it
as mentioned in a quarterly iaea report on iran last month amano said in his speech that the agency had requested clarification from iran about its plans for naval vessels suggesting the iaea has still not heard back from the islamic republic
iran has long said publicly that it intends to develop nuclear propulsion for naval vessels though analysts and diplomats say that remains a distant prospect
it formally notified the iaea of that intention in january in what was widely seen as a rebuff to pressure from trump
