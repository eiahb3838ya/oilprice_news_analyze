france calls on eu nations to adopt carbon price floor
brussels reuters france called on other eu nations to adopt a regional carbon price floor for power generators to promote a shift away from coal to more fuels
at a conference hosted by france on monday to debate the issue french ecology minister brune poirson called for a price floor of from to euros per ton in power generation to help accelerate the shift from coal to gas and renewables
power generation accounts for about a fifth of the bloc s total emissions
the prices are often too weak to push real changes in behavior and yet this is what we need if we are going to accelerate the fight against climate change poirson said
the conference in brussels brought together officials from france germany britain finland the netherlands and sweden to discuss how to send a strong market signal toward meeting the bloc s goals of reducing greenhouse gases by at least percent by
carbon prices under the european emissions trading system ets which charges more than companies for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit have suffered from a glut of permits prompting reforms agreed this year
benchmark prices in the eu s system hit on monday
analysts expect prices to continue rising as measures designed to curb supply from get closer
it s true we have reformed the european trading scheme but with the expected price levels for emission permits coal will remain the most competitive fossil fuel for years to come poirson said
such a regional initiative could bring additional emission reductions revenues for national budgets and reduce the need to subsidize renewables she argued
traders however said there is little expectation a floor price would ever materialize in the eu s trading system
it s really not realistic one carbon trader said
and i don t see what the point would be
they ve just passed very ambitious market reforms which will lead to higher reporting by alissa de carbonnel adecar additional reporting by susanna twidale in london editing by susan fenton
