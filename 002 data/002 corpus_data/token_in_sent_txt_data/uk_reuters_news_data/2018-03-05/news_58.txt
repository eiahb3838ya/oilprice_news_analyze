merkel rejects plea to make national anthem gender-neutral
berlin reuters angela merkel does not want germany s national anthem to be changed her spokesman said after a member of the chancellor s social democrat spd coalition partner said words such as fatherland and brotherland should be made gender neutral
the spd s kristin equality commissioner for germany since wrote to family ministry staff to suggest striking references in the song of germany which has been germany s national anthem since media reported on sunday
the reports surfaced shortly before the spd announced that of its members had voted in favour of joining an alliance with merkel s conservatives with whom they have been in power since
that paves the way for a new government under merkel to start work in
proposed replacing vaterland fatherland in the anthem with heimatland homeland and ditching brotherly with heart and hand in favour of courageously with heart and hand
but merkel deems any such tweaks unnecessary
the chancellor is very happy with our nice national anthem as it is in its traditional form and doesn t see any need for change spokesman steffen seibert told a regular news conference on monday
a spokesman for the family ministry said s letter had been a personal proposal and he could not comment on it especially as it was an internal letter to employees at the family ministry
the first stanza of the anthem which declares germany germany above all else reflecting efforts to unify germany in the century and the second with its refrain of german women german loyalty german wine and german song were officially dropped in following reunification
