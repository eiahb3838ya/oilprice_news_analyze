in iran, france blends hard talks with soft power at louvre exhibit
tehran reuters after a day of tough talking in tehran on monday france s foreign minister and one of iran s vice presidents ambled through the halls of the national museum of iran to admire a collection of artworks on loan from the louvre in paris
relations between iran and france have grown fraught of late rattled by the uncertain future of the iran nuclear accord and french concerns over tehran s ballistic missile tests and military activities in the middle east
but president emmanuel macron s government hopes the soft power of cultural diplomacy can help strengthen bilateral ties
in the turbulent ocean of international diplomacy cultural diplomacy is a beacon we must keep alight french foreign minister yves le drian told a large audience at an event sponsored by french oil giant total
a french diplomat was more blunt whatever disagreements we may have with iran we want to keep and develop a cultural relationship with iranian the louvre exhibition in tehran is the first by a major western cultural institution and was agreed upon during a visit to paris by iranian president hassan rouhani in when francois hollande was france s leader
in a statement the louvre said its international strategy was directly influenced by french diplomatic priorities
the exhibition will display some works from the louvre including a sphinx statue and other artefacts linked to greek egyptian and mesopotamian culture as well as objects from ancient iran
france has historically had a less fractious relationship with iran than either britain or the united states
while britain explored for iranian oil in the century france undertook archaeological digs
i think our archaeological past in iran has at least left a positive imprint the french diplomat said
in an ironic twist the louvre in late opened its first overseas branch in abu dhabi capital of the united arab emirates which accuses iran of destabilising the middle east and has broken off diplomatic relations
the future of iran s nuclear deal with world powers is shrouded in doubt after president donald trump pronounced it flawed and gave europeans until may to fix it
le drian on monday delivered a message to tehran that europe wanted to keep alive the accord that eased economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear programme while echoing concerns about iran s missile programme and role in regional wars
the brick building of the national museum of iran which opened in was designed by two french architects influenced by iran s sassanian heritage
