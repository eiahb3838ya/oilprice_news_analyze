with gas and diplomacy, russia embraces cold war foe pakistan
islamabad reuters as influence in islamabad wanes pakistan s former adversary russia is building military diplomatic and economic ties that could upend historic alliances in the region and open up a gas market for moscow s energy companies
russia s embrace of pakistan comes at a time when relations between the united states and its historical ally are unravelling over the war in afghanistan a remarkable turnaround from the when pakistan helped funnel weapons and spies across the border to aid afghan fighters battling soviet troops
though the rapprochement is in its infancy and it is neighbour china that is filling the growing void left by the united states in pakistan a slew of energy deals and growing military cooperation promise to spark life into the relationship that was dead for many decades
it is an opening khurram dastgir khan pakistan s defence minister told reuters
both countries have to work through the past to open the door to the the cosier diplomatic ties have so far focused on afghanistan where russia has cultivated ties to the afghan taliban militants who are fighting troops and have historic links to islamabad
moscow says it is encouraging peace negotiations
both russia and pakistan are also alarmed by the presence of islamic state is inside afghanistan with moscow concerned the group s fighters could spread towards central asia and closer to home
in pakistan is has already carried out major attacks
we have common ground on most issues at diplomatic levels pakistan s prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi told reuters
it s a relationship that will grow substantially in the during a trip to moscow last month by pakistan s foreign minister khawaja asif the two countries announced plans to establish a commission on military cooperation to combat the threat of is in the region
they also agreed to continue annual military training exercises that began in and followed the sale of four russian attack helicopters to pakistan as well as the purchase of russian engines for the pakistan air force s fighter jets that pakistan s military assembles on its own soil
the detente has been watched with suspicion by pakistan s neighbour and india which broadly stood in the soviet camp during the cold war era
in the last two decades the close relationship has been underpinned by huge arms sales by moscow to a country it calls a strategic partner
if the russians start backing the pakistanis in a big way at the political level then it creates a problem for us said sushant sareen a leading expert on india s relations to pakistan and afghanistan with new observer research foundation
india s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on russia s ties with pakistan but has previously said that its own relations with moscow have stood the test of time and that the two nations are building up defence and energy relations including collaboration on nuclear reactors in india
russian overtures to pakistan offer a badly needed diplomatic lifeline for the south asian nation as it faces growing friction with western powers over its alleged links to militants
at urging and with backing from britain france and germany a global financial watchdog the financial action task force fatf last month decided to place pakistan back on its watchlist of countries with inadequate controls potentially hurting pakistan s fragile economy
the move which islamabad angrily dismissed as an effort to embarrass pakistan followed washington s announcement in january to suspend billion in military assistance
asif pakistan s foreign minister said his nation made a historical error by tilting percent to the west and was now eager build alliances closer to home with the likes of china russia and turkey
we want to correct the imbalance of our foreign policy over years asif told reuters
we are not divorcing that relationship with the west
but we want to have a balance in our relationships we want to be closer to our friends in our defence minister khan said pakistan s military which has historically been heavily reliant on weapons and aircraft may have no choice but to ramp up purchases from the likes of russia
the cooling relationship with washington is already pushing islamabad closer to china which is investing about billion in infrastructure in pakistan
but analysts say pakistan is wary of becoming overly dependent diplomatically on beijing
pakistan is among several nations that have been courted by moscow after falling out with washington including the philippines and qatar but russia s aims for the pakistan relationship are unclear according to petr topychkanov a senior researcher at the stockholm international peace research institute
it s not very transparent even in russia he said
there is no serious public debate there is no detailed explanation to the russian public about what russia wants in russia s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about moscow s increasingly close relations with pakistan
russia and pakistan are negotiating potential energy deals worth in excess of billion according to pakistani energy officials
asif said four to five huge power projects will cement our relationship further
russia last month appointed an honorary council in the pakistan s northern khyber pukhtunkhwa province where its companies are in talks to build an oil refinery and a power station
but the biggest deals focus on gas supply and infrastructure to pakistan one of the world s fastest growing liquefied natural gas lng import markets
on a strategic basis russia is coming in very fast on the energy side said a senior pakistani energy official
in october pakistan and russia signed an agreement iga on energy paving the way for russian gazprom to enter negotiations to supply lng to pakistan
the talks are expected to conclude within three months and gazprom is considered one of the to clinch a supply deal according to the pakistani official
based on two monthly lng cargo deliveries that deal would be worth about billion over years he added
there is also growing confidence that a gas pipeline due to be built by russia stretching km miles from lahore to the port city of karachi will go ahead
sanctions against russian state conglomerate rostec as well as a dispute over pipeline transport fees have held up the billion project since it was signed in
the pipeline would be the biggest infrastructure deal by russia since early when soviet engineers constructed the pakistan steel mills industrial complex
a russian company according to defence minister khan is eying up a deal to take over the disused steel mills
