japan betting heavily on hydrogen society fuelling stations needed to boost vehicle new venture will nearly double number of stations adds comment details tokyo march reuters an alliance of japanese firms including automakers and energy firms has pledged to build fuelling stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by to help accelerate of the fuel technology
japan mobility llc whose backers include toyota motor corp and jxtg nippon oil energy said on monday it would oversee the construction and operation of the new fuelling stations nearly doubling the number at present
as countries seek low emissions energy sources to power vehicles homes and industry japan is betting heavily on becoming a hydrogen society despite the high costs and technical difficulties of a process that creates electricity from a chemical reaction of fuel and oxygen

we must lower costs which will remove many of the bottlenecks to developing more stations he told reporters at a briefing
by about the japanese government aims to roughly halve the cost of building a hydrogen fuelling station which is currently about million yen to million yen million well above million yen for a gasoline station
the path to adopting hydrogen has been dogged by the difficulty in driving widespread given high costs of vehicles fcvs limited production capabilities and low numbers of fuelling stations
only a handful of automakers currently market fcvs including toyota honda motor co and hyundai motor co
toyota has sold only units of its mirai fcv since its launch in while it has sold a total of around million gasoline hybrids since launching the prius years ago
japan wants to have hydrogen stations and fcvs on the country s roads by march
by it aims to have stations to service some fcvs buses and forklifts
