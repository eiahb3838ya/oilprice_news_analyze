russia's rosneft holds key to fixing iraqi kurdistan oil flows - sources
erbil reuters russian state oil company rosneft has emerged with an important role in talks between iraq s government and iraqi kurdistan on resuming full oil exports from the region two industry sources said
the central government took charge of half of the oil fields that were under iraqi kurdistan s control last october soon after the northern region voted for independence in a referendum opposed by baghdad
exports via turkey were halved
prime minister haider said on that an agreement had been reached at talks with the kurdistan regional government krg based in the city of erbil for full oil exports to resume soon
but he gave no more detail of when exports would resume and said some differences would have to be resolved later
the two sides are at odds over payment of iraqi kurdistan s debts and the transfer of funds to the region from the national budget
the two industry sources who are involved in the talks said the krg has told baghdad it is ready to resume full exports and transfer the funds raised to the iraqi government on two conditions that some oil is kept for local refining and baghdad pays pumping tariffs to rosneft
the russian oil major took over ownership of the region s export oil and gas pipelines last year and agreed to provide it with over billion in loans but the deal is not recognised by baghdad which says independent kurdish oil exports are illegal
erbil offered a solution and has written to baghdad but has yet to hear a final answer one of the sources said requesting anonymity because the talks are not public
in the long run we need to agree on budget transfers and debts to find a compromise over exports the source added
rosneft declined to comment
moscow did not oppose the referendum which the united sates and the european union urged the krg to postpone
rosneft s role in the talks underlines its growing international clout under chief executive igor sechin an ally of president vladimir putin despite western sanctions on russia over its role in the ukraine conflict
rosneft s role was discussed by one of the company s vice presidents didier casimiro during a visit to baghdad in february and by iraqi foreign minister ibrahim in talks in moscow last month the industry sources said
jafari said iraq was not closing the door on any foreign oil company and iraq s oil minister has said baghdad has no problem with rosneft operating in the kurdistan region
krg spokesman safeen dizayee said no concrete agreement was in place yet but he was hopeful baghdad would agree to the plan which included proposals on rosneft and local refining
he declined further comment
sources in iraqi kurdistan say baghdad s takeover of half the oilfields near the kirkuk area had cost the region nearly billion in lost revenues
the krg also says baghdad owes it billions of dollars in unpaid transfers from the state budget
since the fall of dictator saddam hussein in kurdistan has traditionally been allocated percent of the federal budget after sovereign expenses but the regional government says it has not been receiving that amount
the federal government says it stopped the transfer of funds after iraqi kurdistan began independent oil exports which baghdad says are illegal
the dispute has been complicated by the budget approved by the national parliament on saturday in a vote boycotted by kurdish parties
iraqi kurdistan s will now receive a budget allocation after sovereign expenses which reflects its share of the iraqi population which abadi says is percent
industry and political sources in baghdad and erbil said differences were still too big to reach a lasting deal on oil exports before iraq holds a parliamentary election on may
erbil will not commit to a deal with abadi until he gets
and abadi doesn t seem to be willing to commit to a deal that could weaken his position before the election a source involved in talks in erbil told reuters
an ally of abadi who is taking part in the talks said both sides are betting on time
we are in election season and faces might change
but any delay in solving the kurdistan problem is not helpful to either debts have piled up over the years as the iraqi kurds borrowed money from turkey trading houses such as glencore and vitol and rosneft to pay state salaries and develop the infrastructure of its pipelines and oilfields
baghdad says only somo has the right to export iraqi crude
this is a massive problem
their the kurds view is if they are to hand over exports to somo then the iraqi government should take on that debt said the baghdad negotiator
baghdad will pay salaries for oil but will not take on the krg s before the independence referendum last september iraqi kurdistan was hoping to raise oil exports above million barrels per day from around bpd becoming one of the world s fastest growing oil regions
but after iraqi troops took control of the kirkuk oil fields with the help of militias krg s exports have been running at around bpd
another bpd worth million a day at current prices are trapped under the ground
