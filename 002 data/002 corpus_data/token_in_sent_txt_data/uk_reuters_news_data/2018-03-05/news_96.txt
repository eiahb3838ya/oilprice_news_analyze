french minister to lay out concerns on ballistics, regional role in iran visit
le drian in tehran for talks with senior iranian officials visit comes as trump deadline to fix nuclear deal looms france to assess if iran ready for talks on ballistic programme by john irish tehran march reuters france s foreign minister was in iran on monday to reaffirm europe s commitment to a nuclear deal that opened the iranian economy to investment but also to echo concerns raised by president donald trump who has threatened to quit the agreement
le drian will tell iran it must address the west s misgivings about its ballistic missile programme and military activities around the middle east points the white house says need attention if the nuclear pact is to survive
we re not going to be donald trump s envoys or iran s defence lawyers said a french diplomatic source
we have our own concerns and will talk to the different sensibilities of the iranian system to get our point trump has said european allies must help fix the nuclear deal before a may deadline
the accord between france britain germany russia china and the united states gave iran relief from economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear programme allowing tehran to talk trade with europe for the first time in years
france has been quick to restore trade ties
planemaker airbus oil major total and automobile manufacturers peugeot and renault have signed deals all of which could be at risk if trump walks out of the accord
in an effort to keep him on board french president emmanuel macron has criticised iran s ballistics programme and raised the possibility of new sanctions
on the eve of le drian s visit he told president hassan rouhani france expects iran to make a constructive contribution to solving crises in the middle east macron s office said on sunday
tehran supports syrian president bashar against rebels including groups backed by the west and backs israel s enemy hezbollah in lebanon
the two presidents agreed in their phone call to work together in the coming days with the united nations the syrian government and other countries involved to improve the situation for civilians and make a ceasefire effective paris said
france has urged washington to see the nuclear deal separately from iran s regional activities and its missile programme and le drian will stress macron s commitment to the nuclear accord especially as iran is respecting its terms french officials said
le drian is due to meet rouhani and foreign minister mohammad javad zarif as well as officials close to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei including ali shamkhani secretary of the supreme national security council
khamenei said on march that iran would keep supporting assad s war effort and a foreign ministry spokesman on sunday rejected macron s comments about iran s missile programme insisting its defensive missile work would continue
an official close to rouhani said iran has always been open to talks and to resolve issues through diplomacy but this does not mean we will yield to unjust pressure over our inevitable rights whether defensive or anything while france says iran is sticking to the terms of the nuclear deal it may not be respecting part of resolution that calls on it to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads
the resolution enshrines the nuclear deal which itself makes no explicit reference to the ballistics programme but it is unclear whether the wording binds tehran to an obligatory commitment on missiles
on the ballistics the iranian programme is not compatible with and we have a particular concern on the transfer of of ballistic capacity to regional actors and by that we mean hezbollah said the diplomatic source
a second diplomat said while our concerns aren t directly linked to the nuclear deal it s important we make progress on these other subjects because otherwise trump risks killing the additional reporting by parisa hafezi editing by richard lough and robin pomeroy
