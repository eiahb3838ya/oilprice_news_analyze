as of now shell continues to holds its equity in the gaza marine gaza marine located about km miles off the gaza coast has long been seen as a golden opportunity for the palestinian authority to join the mediterranean gas bonanza providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid
plans to develop the field estimated to hold over trillion cubic feet of natural gas the equivalent of spain s consumption in were put off several times over the past decade
the delays were due to internal palestinian rivalry and conflict with israel as well as economic reasons
