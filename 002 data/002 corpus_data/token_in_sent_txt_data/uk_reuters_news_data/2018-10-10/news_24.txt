governments must change tack to contain global warming, says big oil
london reuters governments not energy firms need to take the lead in achieve targets to contain global warming with policies that will change fuel and other energy consumption habits oil and gas companies said
a panel called this week for unprecedented changes in how the world consumes energy and a dramatic rise in the use of renewable power to contain global warming at lower levels and protect the planet from heatwaves floods and rising sea levels
clearly it s a call to action bp chief executive dudley told an oil money conference in london this week
not only oil and gas companies but you need that in agriculture you need that in steel production you need that in the use of people pushing the button on the wall to get electricity he said
several oil and gas firms are among those taking steps to contain emissions of some greenhouse gases
royal dutch shell bp and exxon mobil have all set targets to reduce methane emissions
let s stop quibbling in society about whose fault it is and who should do more shell chief executive ben van beurden said
to contain the rise in global temperatures at degrees celsius the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipc said manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about percent by from levels
it said emissions should be net zero by
van beurden said that while such a target could be met it would not be commercially viable under today s regulations and policies and market designs so things would have to bp s dudley said more industry collaboration would help saying cooperation between the energy industry and carmakers was helping achieve greater fuel efficiency and reducing emissions
we can do this even faster and more efficiently i think with clearer smarter policy signals from governments he said
governments have been introducing steps to reduce emissions including promoting the use of electric cars phasing out sales of more polluting diesel vehicles and encouraging use of renewable sources of energy
emissions have fallen to levels last seen years ago as it uses more gas which produces lower emissions than other fossil fuels such as oil and coal
britain s carbon pricing policy has cut its emissions to the lowest in over a century
but demand for oil continues to climb
the international energy agency iea estimates global oil demand will hit million barrels per day bpd for the first time this year
without a major shift in policies the iea expects world oil demand to rise for at least the next years heading for million bpd around
the era of oil is far in fact very far from over chief executive of abu dhabi oil company adnoc sultan said
there is healthier demand for our product which is undeniably good news for our qatar petroleum ceo saad al kaabi said it was too much to expect a dramatic reduction in the use of oil and gas given demand vehicle fuel and petrochemicals
oil is not going to completely go away but it is going to reduce he said
unless you give me a solution that s different than just renewables or say you want to do away with nuclear power also and so on unless there is another way of getting there it s difficult to comprehend how we ll achieve it he said
