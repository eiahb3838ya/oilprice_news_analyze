update 1-france's asn to rule on edf reactor lifespans by end 2020 - asn nominee
lifespan ruling key for edf france has nuclear reactors nuclear power crucial for french energy needs adds quotes context paris oct reuters france s asn nuclear regulator will issue by the end of its and generic ruling on the life span extension of utility edf s nuclear plants said the french government s nominee to head the asn
based on the information at my disposal the generic ruling should be issued at the end of bernard doroszczuk said at a french senate committee hearing about his nomination
the ruling which is crucial for edf has been repeatedly delayed most recently by outgoing asn chief chevet
chevet said in november that the asn would rule on those reactor lifespans in with a first recommendation in to be followed by a legally binding ruling in
france s nuclear reactors operated by edf were built in large part between the end of the and the early
they are coming to the end of their design lifespan which edf wants to extend to years
the first of edf s reactors with megawatt capacity will reach the threshold in the next years
at that point each individual reactor is given a thorough inspection and the asn then rules on whether it can continue to operate
doroszczuk said the asn s generic ruling on lifespan extensions was not a prerequisite for the inspections
he said these inspections would take place between starting with the tricastin reactor and continue until for edf s oldest generation of megawatt reactors
the french government will publish its energy strategy at the end of this month which is set to define by when france will reduce the share of nuclear in electricity generation to percent from the current percent
that process could involve closing up to a third of edf s reactors
the government has said the asn ruling will be a major factor in this decision and could hedge the energy strategy on the outcome of the asn ruling
doroszczuk confirmed that the absence of a core catcher feature in edf s existing reactors will be an issue in the asn s lifespan decision
edf s new epr reactor under construction in flamanville has a giant bowl that can contain its core in case of meltdown but older reactors lack this feature and could suffer the china syndrome with molten fuel burning into the ground and reaching the water table in case of an accident
doroszczuck said that not all edf s mw reactors have the necessary space to add such a feature
