feature-a waste mountain to climb: can africa make plastic recycling pay?
yaounde oct thomson reuters foundation prince djabea stamps on a plastic bottle as if squashing a cockroach then using the heel of his other foot flicks the bottle cap through the air with a pop
he is not showing off the latest street dance craze in douala cameroon s commercial capital but taking part in one of the country s biggest plastic recycling schemes striving to turn waste into something useful while cleaning up the environment
behind djabea about teenagers gather plastic bottles clogging up drainage canals and gutters while others go door to door asking residents for their plastic rubbish
it is all loaded into giant tarpaulin sacks that are weighed at the end of the day and then sent to be remade into shoes chairs and floor tiles among other products
the initiative led by brainchild of environmental engineer alain rodrigue ngonde elong operates in yaounde too collecting to tonnes of plastic waste per year roughly the weight of african forest elephants
elong came up with the idea as a student in douala
you just saw the rubbish the plastic everywhere you looked he told the thomson reuters foundation describing open drainage channels lining the streets blocked by plastic bottles
in the rainy season the channels overflowed and attracted mosquitoes which bred and in turn increased rates of malaria and dengue fever among local inhabitants elong said
no one had a solution for it he added
today elong s team works on the problem by organising a rubbish collection campaign every quarter employing everyone from teenagers eager for work experience to street children needing fast cash
the youngsters earn on average cfa francs per month though their income varies according to how much they collect and the amount is paid by the city council
in recent years young activists and entrepreneurs across west and central africa have launched a host of creative solutions to tackle the problem of discarded plastic
in cameroon s coastal town of kribi engineer ismael essome builds boats from plastic bottles for fishing and
in lagos nigeria wecyclers runs a trash collection and recycling business providing revenue for slum residents who gather rubbish by bicycle and are paid for the service
further afield in south africa the rethaka foundation transforms waste plastic into school bags fitted with a portable light to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds do their homework after dark
meanwhile in towns and villages across africa street vendors collect plastic bottles and refill them with goods to sell from peanuts and oil to fresh juice and even petrol
yet despite growing efforts across africa to reuse plastic much of the waste continues to blight local environments as litter is burned or buried in the ground
around the world researchers estimate that about million tonnes of plastic waste leak from land into the sea each year
in cameroon essome s plastic boats have won international awards and recognition making waves as far away as madrid where his team was asked to construct an
but they have received no funding from governments or charities that would allow them to expand their venture
because we are young and working in a new field in cameroon it s a big challenge said essome who is set to represent his country at the one young world summit for young global leaders in the hague this month
founder elong said obtaining government funding was a slow process but the group had succeeded in securing subsidies from several local authorities as well as income from businesses that buy the waste to make plastic products
yet his outfit still lacks the resources to collect plastic on a daily basis which would boost results elong added
enterprises like his also have a mountain to climb as the amount of plastic waste is increasing
in africa was estimated to have million metric tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste a figure that could rise to million tonnes in if nothing is done scientists warned in a study published this month
coupled with unprecedented population growth ballooning waste is likely to pose major problems even as local recycling initiatives multiply environmental activists say
osric tening forton an environmental risk expert with the african development bank said better regulation and stronger enforcement of existing laws are needed for recycling to flourish
the problem is not exclusive to africa
the organisation for economic and development said in may that plastic recycling around the world is failing to reach its full potential
it called for the introduction of higher taxes on the manufacture and use of new plastics and more mechanisms to make consumers pay for plastic bags cutlery and straws
another major challenge is changing individual behaviour said elong
some people tell me i haven t eaten for two days why should i care about recycling plastics he told the thomson reuters foundation
in response he explains recycling can help them earn money to improve their lives while also benefiting the environment
at the end of the day we need to make people understand that recycling is also profitable said elong
