adds details background by lefteris karagiannopoulos oslo oct reuters a consortium s plan to build a nuclear reactor in western finland by is likely to be delayed as more time is needed to secure licenses its chairman said on wednesday
the fennovoima consortium includes russia s state nuclear company rosatom whose involvement has raised concerns in finland about russia s influence in the country
the finnish parliament however approved the project to build the gigawatt gw reactor which is expected to cost billion euros billion to boost domestic energy production
normally when a plane departs late it arrives late
would be extremely ambitious if not unrealistic the consortium s chairman esa harmala told reuters
the consortium also includes finnish power company fortum and stainless steel maker outokumpu among other companies
finland s nuclear regulator stuk said last week it would make a decision on a license to start construction of the reactor named hanhikivi in pending the provision of documents from its owners including rosatom
the fennovoima consortium said last year it would submit the documents in and that it expected to get a permit in a year later than originally planned
stuk said last week that the consortium informed it in august that the documents would be submitted by july
harmala also said he expected that the documents would be supplied by summer next year as more information is required from rosatom
that means the consortium may not get stuk approval until and would struggle to meet its target to start the plant in
we are still discussing with the supplier rosatom
by the end of this year we will get an updated timetable on the schedule said harmala
a spokesman for rosatom which holds a percent stake in fenovoima consortium said that as of now there has been no change on the planed startup date agreed by its members
rosatom which has been stepping up an overseas expansion agreed in to take the stake in the project and to supply the reactor
a finnish project to build another nuclear power plant in finland olkiluoto is already more than a decade behind schedule and may face further postponements plant operator teollisuuden voima tvo said on last week
