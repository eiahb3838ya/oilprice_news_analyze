update 2-germany backs eu climate deal over car lobby's protests
berlin reuters german chancellor angela merkel endorsed a eu compromise deal for a percent cut in car emissions by despite protests from her country s own automakers which said the target was unrealistic and pursuing it would cost jobs
torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry competitiveness eu environment ministers in luxembourg talked for more than hours on tuesday to reach a compromise over what carbon dioxide limits to impose on europe s powerful car manufacturers
asked on wednesday at a berlin news conference for her view on the deal merkel described the cuts softer than those demanded by some eu countries as defensible partly because of the scope for later revising them
there is a revisions clause for since the question of how fast we can cut carbon dioxide emissions depends on the extent of market penetration by electric cars or other cars with alternative propulsion systems she said
under these circumstances i think the agreement is wholly the eu talks were lent added urgency by the publication of a report this week warning that time was running short for the rapid and unprecedented global action needed to contain global warming
the car emissions target was harsher than the percent cut wanted by germany with its vast auto industry and the eu s executive but short of the percent some other member states were seeking
while merkel said the agreement at least provided certainty to european carmakers the industry s umbrella group protested at the pace of the cuts envisaged and called for more public support for the transition to electric vehicles
it s very regrettable that a majority of eu member states didn t find it in themselves to strike a balance between climate protection and preserving jobs said bernhard mattes head of the vda auto industry umbrella group
eu governments need to take on more of the financial burden of building out networks of charging stations if they want swifter adoption of electric cars he added
volkswagen s chief executive herbert diess warned in a german newspaper interview that the planned environmental regulations could have dire consequences
an industry can collapse faster than many believe diess told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung on wednesday
a percent cut in car emissions by would result in the loss of about a quarter of vw s factory jobs or positions he said
the percent reduction doesn t look much better he added
in an indication of the depths of divisions in germany over the role of its most important export industry the toughened targets brought home from luxembourg failed to win over the opposition
a percent cut is nothing like enough for the challenges of tomorrow said greens leader anton hofreiter
