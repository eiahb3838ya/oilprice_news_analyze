in a letter the senators said they had triggered a provision of the global magnitsky human rights accountability act requiring the president to determine whether a foreign person is responsible for a gross human rights violation

the republican and democratic leaders of the senate foreign relations committee senators bob corker and bob menendez and their counterparts on the appropriations subcommittee that funds the state department lindsey graham and patrick leahy triggered the magnitsky action
but the others also signed the letter to send trump a strong bipartisan message of support for a serious response to khashoggi s disappearance senate aides said
the global magnitsky act requires a report within days of the letter with a decision on the imposition of sanctions on anyone deemed responsible for a serious rights violation such as torture prolonged detention without trial or extrajudicial killing of someone exercising freedom of expression
the recent disappearance of saudi journalist and washington post columnist jamal khashoggi suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of international recognised human rights the letter said
the magnitsky act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on russian officials linked to the death in prison of sergei magnitsky a russian whistleblower
it became the global magnitsky act in when it was expanded to cover rights abusers in any country
