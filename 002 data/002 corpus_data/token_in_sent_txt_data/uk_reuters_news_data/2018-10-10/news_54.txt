update 4-trump raises ethanol use in gasoline, appeases farmers ahead of elections
york reuters president donald trump launched an effort on tuesday to increase ethanol use in the nation s gasoline pool delivering a political victory to the country s farm belt and angering oil refiners ahead of november s congressional elections
trump announced the lifting of a ban on summer sales of gasoline blended with percent ethanol known as at a meeting at the white house republican senators told reporters after the meeting
my administration is protecting ethanol
today we are unleashing the power of to fuel our country all year long trump told a cheering crowd of supporters at a rally in council bluffs iowa
the announcement capped a effort by the white house to thread the needle between rival corn and oil industry interests by boosting ethanol demand while also cutting costs for refiners
in the end trump is moving ahead without the support of the oil refining industry which wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer ban
the move is also aimed at helping the political fortunes of republican candidates in the midwest saddled with a tough farm economy and the imposition of import tariffs by trump and china
polls show close election races in iowa for the governor s seat and two congressional seats
trump told the rally that democrats would end ethanol if given the chance
you d better get out there and vote for republicans he said
nancy pelosi the top democrat in the house of representatives said in a statement democrats remain vigilant to ensure that this new measure will create real benefits for america s iowa is the nation s biggest producer of corn and farmers there have been frustrated with falling corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the united states and china
it s about time said warren bachman a corn and soybean farmer in iowa
with all the trade wars tariffs and low crop prices it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the since ethanol is cheaper than gasoline the administration hopes to lower pump prices which currently average a gallon more than cents higher than this time a year ago according to the american automobile association
the environmental protection agency prohibits summer sales of in certain areas because of smog concerns
for the ban to be removed it must draft and finalize a rule in the spring
i feel certain this rule can be accomplished before the driving season next year secretary of agriculture sonny perdue told reuters in an interview
biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will boost ethanol sales
geoff cooper chief executive of the renewable fuels association trade group said allowing sales could double sales of the blend from roughly million gallons currently
it depends on how quickly new pumps would be added the greatest impact will be cooper said
he said the move was a great first step but noted it faced significant political and legal opposition
we are happy but we know there s still a long road ahead cooper said
the rule would be coupled with restrictions on the biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like valero energy corp and pbf energy those rules will seek to stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws
refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices
the epa will consider forcing blenders retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly to reduce market volatility a white house official said
but that is not enough for the refiners
the american petroleum institute the largest oil trade association opposes lifting the ban saying gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties
the only certainty from today s actions is a lawsuit chet thompson head of american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers said on tuesday
he said the industry would challenge the finalized rule in court saying the epa had acknowledged it lacks the authority to change this rule
last year biofuel credit prices rose to nearly each near a high as merchant refiners warned that plants may be forced to close without federal action
prices dropped after the epa expanded its use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations
the credits were trading at roughly cents each on tuesday traders said
