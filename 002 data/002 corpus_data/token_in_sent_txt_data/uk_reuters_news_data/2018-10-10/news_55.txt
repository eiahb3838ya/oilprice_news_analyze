refile-update 3-trump raises ethanol use in gasoline, appeases farmers ahead of elections
fixes spelling of perdue in paragraph by jarrett renshaw and humeyra pamuk washington oct reuters president donald trump launched an effort on tuesday to increase ethanol use in the nation s gasoline pool delivering a political victory to the nation s farm belt and angering oil refiners ahead of november s congressional elections
trump announced the lifting of a ban on summer sales of gasoline blended with percent ethanol known as at a meeting at the white house republican senators told reporters after the meeting
he plans to comment positively on the move at an iowa rally on tuesday evening
the announcement caps a effort by the white house to thread the needle between rival corn and oil industry interests by boosting ethanol demand while also cutting costs for refiners
in the end trump is moving ahead without the support of the oil refining industry who wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer ban
the move is also aimed at helping the political fortunes of republican candidates in the midwest saddled with a tough farm economy and the imposition of import tariffs by president trump and by china
polls show close election races in iowa for the governor s seat and two congressional seats
iowa is the nation s biggest producer of corn and farmers there have been frustrated with falling corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the united states and china
it s about time warren bachman a corn and soybean farmer in iowa
with all the trade wars tariffs and low crop prices it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the since ethanol is cheaper than gasoline the administration hopes to lower pump prices which currently average a gallon more than cents higher than this time a year ago according to the american automobile association
trump will be in council bluffs iowa later in the day for a rally where he will talk up the changes though the move requires the environmental protection agency to draft a rule on the removal of the ban
the epa prohibits summer sales of in certain areas due to smog concerns
it must now draft and finalize a rule in the spring
i feel certain this rule can be accomplished before the driving season next year secretary of agriculture sonny perdue told reuters in an interview
biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will boost ethanol sales
geoff cooper ceo of the renewable fuels association trade group said allowing sales could double sales of the blend from roughly million gallons currently
it depends on how quickly new pumps would be added the greatest impact will be cooper said
he said the move was a great first step but note it faces significant political and legal opposition
we are happy but we know there s still a long road ahead cooper said
the rule would be coupled with restrictions on the biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like valero energy corp and pbf energy those rules will seek stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws
refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices
the epa will consider forcing blenders retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly to reduce market volatility a white house official said
but this is not enough for the refiners
the american petroleum institute the largest oil trade association opposes lifting the ban saying gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties
the only certainty from today s actions is a lawsuit chet thompson head of american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers said on tuesday
he said the industry would challenge the finalized rule in court saying the epa has acknowledged it lacks the authority to change this rule
last year biofuel credit prices rose to nearly each near a five year high as merchant refiners warned plants may be forced to close without federal action
prices dropped after the epa expanded its use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations
the credits were trading at roughly cents each on tuesday traders said
