as 'monster' michael storms in, no fear at the lighthouse motel
panacea reuters for mary grasberger even the threat of the worst storm to hit the florida panhandle in recorded history could not persuade her to leave her pets and evacuate the lighthouse motel her home in the beach town of panacea for the last four years
we have nowhere to go said grasberger who lives in the motel with her daughter brenda and their dogs and cats
we have animals so we re not leaving without the motel where they live with the help of government assistance is about miles east of mexico beach where hurricane michael crashed into the florida panhandle on wednesday with miles per hour kph winds and the potential for a devastating storm surge
the tempest was expected to be the worst hurricane ever recorded in florida
about two hours before it made landfall wakulla county sheriff s deputies arrived at the lighthouse and urged the residents most of whom depend on disability checks and social welfare to flee
you ll be dead
you really need to leave one officer told residents many of whom had no intention of obeying what authorities termed a mandatory evacuation order ahead of what officials are describing as a monstrous storm
we re leaving in minutes so you need to get the deputies asked why residents had not heeded earlier warnings and taken a bus that they said came around on tuesday to give them a ride to safety
residents said they knew nothing about a bus
by wednesday with the storm just hours away there was no transportation available
frustrated the deputies said they would try to arrange for a van as landfall approached

she said she had weathered other storms and could ride this one out too
i ve been through this before she said
