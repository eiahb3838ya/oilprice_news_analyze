feature-boomtown seattle aims to add jobs - and subtract emissions
seattle oct thomson reuters foundation from the bullitt center s roof seattle s status as the north american crane capital is in full view
cranes are currently reshaping the seattle skyline a building boom that reflects this city s phenomenal growth spurt
in census data released this year seattle was ranked the fastest growing big city over the last decade with new residents pouring in to take jobs at companies such as
but that growth is a worry as the emerald city nicknamed for its evergreen trees and environmentalist politics strives to become carbon neutral by meaning it will produce no more emissions than it can offset by measures such as planting trees
a building boom unlike any seen since the late century yukon gold rush is making an already challenging goal harder experts say
seattle s greenhouse gas emissions have fallen percent since according to data the most recently available from the city s office of sustainability and the environment
over the same period the city s population grew percent
we have decoupled growth from emissions the city s chief climate official jessica finn coven told the thomson reuters foundation
but nonetheless we re not on track to meet our ambitious goals she said
as old structures fall and new ones are built heating and lighting them account for a third of the city s emissions finn coven said
figuring out how to slash emissions further without either scaring off economic development or hampering the pace of housing construction is a challenge she admits
but it s not rocket science she said
we have to stop heating our buildings with fossil companies leasing office space in the bullitt center a modern edifice eight blocks from downtown are doing their part to help seattle become carbon neutral
the bullitt center is the world s largest living building one that produces more energy than it consumes thanks to an design that exceeds the highest standards set by leed a green building ratings system
windows allow ample natural light during working hours
windows open and close automatically to adjust the temperature and an heat pump takes advantage of stable temperatures below ground to heat the building in the winter and cool it in the summer
a cantilevered roof carpeted in photovoltaic panels captures enough solar energy in this cloudiest of major cities to power the needs of an engineering firm a tech company satellite office and a home contractor among others
occupants of the building say it s comfortable as well as efficient
i love that there s so much daylight said amanda falkenhagen a lighting designer with rushing an engineering and sustainability consulting firm with an office in the center
i was recently in a traditional office building and it made me realize all the things in this building i take for granted the lightness airiness connectedness to the outside she said
denis hayes president of the bullitt foundation an environmental philanthropy serving the pacific northwest noted that often in the center there are no lights on but nobody complains
the foundation invested more than million a third of its million endowment in to erect the bullitt center hoping to pave the way for other similar buildings
it suddenly takes something that developers thought was impossible and shows that it s in fact practical hayes told the thomson reuters foundation in the center s airy conference room
the problem is the bullitt center still remains one of a kind despite hayes saying that if it was still the biggest living building in the world five years after being commissioned i would consider our efforts a failure
seattle hopes to change that through incentives
the bullitt center for instance benefitted from a pilot initiative that waived some zoning requirements on height and roof design in order to accommodate its makeup
in april mayor jenny durkan reauthorized that programme and launched a new pilot that will allow up to buildings to be built higher than existing rules permit if they meet certain energy efficiency standards
she also directed the utility company whose electricity comes almost entirely from hydropower to feed excess energy created by buildings such as the bullitt center back into the power grid and pay the building owners for creating it
the directive which allows up to buildings to feed power into seattle s electrical grid aims to provide a financial incentive for building owners to make hefty investments in energy efficiency
seattle also has put in place one of the united states strictest codes for energy efficiency in commercial buildings
it requires most new buildings to achieve an energy use index eui rating in the according to susan wickwire who directs the seattle district an initiative to encourage real estate developers and building managers to meet tough standards
the average seattle building has a rating between and hayes said while the bullitt center s is
wickwire s group tracks the energy performance of buildings out of in an square km area of the city that includes downtown seattle
she thinks the incentive programme is a good one and believes real estate developers and property managers are getting on board with greater energy efficency
there is a shift in the dna of the city to move away from fossil fuels to greener electricity and that s only going to get tighter wickwire said
but the overall energy efficiency of her district is dragged down by inefficient buildings constructed in the and she said
owners of those buildings are hesitant to pursue retrofits she said because they would also trigger demands for other upgrades such as improved access for the disabled and better ability to withstand earthquakes
overcoming that problem may require further tweaks to city government policy to keep seattle on target with its climate change goals
those goals are ones activists such as hayes see as key to helping set similar standards nationwide
if you ca do it in seattle i do know how you can do it in cleveland he said
