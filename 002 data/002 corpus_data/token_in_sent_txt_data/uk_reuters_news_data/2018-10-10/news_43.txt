update 2-sse, npower win regulatory nod for energy retail tie-up
london reuters british energy suppliers sse and innogy se s npower on wednesday won final regulatory approval for a of their retail units clearing the way for the creation of the uk s retail power provider
the merger given the by britain s competition and markets authority cma would create a new entity with a percent market share the second largest in the uk market behind centrica s british gas with percent
it would also cut the big six providers to five
the companies aim to complete the deal by the first quarter of next year at the latest they said earlier this year
after a review of the deal the cma decided to clear the merger as sse and npower are not close rivals for customers on standard variable tariffs svt it said
with many energy companies out there people switching away from expensive standard variable tariffs will still have plenty of choice when they shop around after this merger said anne lambert chair of the cma s inquiry group
the cma found that the number of people switching energy providers in britain was the highest in a decade and the proportion on svts has fallen
those who do not switch are usually on one of the large energy suppliers already expensive svts so the cma examined whether the merger would change how those prices are set
while svt prices are mainly driven by changes in wholesale costs large energy suppliers take account of each other s tariff changes when setting their own the cma said
the watchdog looked at whether a reduction in the number of large suppliers would encourage larger or earlier tariff changes
in this case sse and npower do not pay special attention to each other consistent with the evidence that they are not close rivals for svt customers who instead prefer to move to other suppliers the cma said
energy regulator ofgem s cap on such tariffs should also help to protect svt customers the cma said
both sse and innogy welcomed the cma s decision
innogy said preparations for the new british retail energy company are progressing and both parties have achieved important milestones in recent months
this is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months said alistair chief executive of sse
however we ve always believed that the creation of a new independent energy and services retailer has the potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole he added
