update 1-hydro ceo says focus on full output at alunorte, no layoffs
keeping all staff in anticipation of full production can not give time for full operation aluminium demand little affected by trade dispute adds ceo comments on aluminium market oslo oct reuters norway s norsk hydro is focused on a return to full output at its alunorte alumina refinery in brazil and is not contemplating layoffs there ceo svein richard brandtzaeg told reuters on wednesday
hydro had said last week it would close down the world s largest alumina refinery and lay off workers as attempts to resolve an environmental dispute with brazilian authorities faltered
this week it announced it has been granted permits from the authorities to restart operations at half capacity
the way we are operating now requires more staffing
as long as we have a positive dialogue with the authorities we will keep the staffing
we believe the embargo will be lifted and then we need all our people brandtzaeg told reuters in a telephone interview
hydro was ordered by brazilian regulators in february to slash output by half at the refinery after the company admitted making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains
it s difficult to give exact timeline for a full restart but we are now in the process of implementing measures we agreed on with authorities in september he said
the plant has an annual capacity of million tonnes of alumina or percent of capacity outside china
alunorte transforms bauxite into alumina which is turned into aluminium at huge smelters
alumina and aluminium prices have been pushed up by hydro s production cut at alunorte
brandtzaeg acknowledged it was unfortunate that hydro one week announced plans for closure and the next week plans to recover output
we want stable and predictable operations but in this case it was not possible he said
overall demand in the market was quite good driven by auto industry and global gdp growth brandtzaeg said repeating hydro s forecast for an aluminium market deficit of million tonnes this year
there s still a lot of aluminium in storage but its gradually reducing
the supply deficit is covered by reserve capacity in china but even with china we have a deficit of million tonnes globally brandtzaeg said
he said the trade war between china and so far had little impact
it seems consumers have to pay for this
margins for exporters seems to be the same despite a tariff increase on chinese aluminium brandtzaeg said
