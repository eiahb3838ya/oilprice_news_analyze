germany's spd calls for fines for diesel carmakers if necessary
berlin reuters germany should fine carmakers if they fail to fix dirty diesel vehicles a senior member of the social democrat spd coalition party said on wednesday accusing the transport minister of being too close to the auto industry
the kid gloves need to come off said carsten schneider a senior figure in the spd s parliamentary group adding that carmakers could be fined up to euros per vehicle if they did not carry out remedial work on older diesel cars
the german government last week outlined plans to cut pollution from diesels by asking carmakers to offer owners incentives and hardware fixes in an attempt to avert further driving bans in major cities
but its efforts were dealt a blow by a berlin court ruling on tuesday that ordered germany s capital to ban older diesel vehicles from some of its roads
the comments from schneider highlighted strains between parties in chancellor angela merkel s coalition over the issue
schneider said he had doubts whether transport minister andreas scheuer a member of merkel s conservative allies from bavaria was treating the issue with the necessary urgency
the transport minister should not behave as though he was the country s chief car salesman but rather like someone who represents the interests of those who have bought diesel cars he said
merkel on wednesday endorsed a eu compromise deal for a percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars by despite protests from her country s own carmakers who said the target was unrealistic and that pursuing it would cost jobs
there has been disagreement within the german government on balancing demands to make carmakers pay for the cost of reducing pollution in the wake of an emissions scandal and calls to protect the auto industry the country s biggest exporter
while the spd has called for binding measures to make carmakers fix older diesels merkel s conservatives favor a softer solution offering car owners a discount if they wish to trade in their diesel cars for new ones
