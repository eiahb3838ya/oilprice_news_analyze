maersk oil trading leases singapore storage ahead of 2020 ship fuel changes
singapore oct reuters maersk oil trading has leased oil storage space in singapore signalling a push by one of the world s biggest ship fuel buyers into the asian bunkering hub ahead of changes to global fuel standards from trade sources said
maersk oil has taken storage at the tankstore oil terminal in singapore a spokesman for parent
told reuters without giving further details
the firm has leased cubic meters of space for fuel oil for six months said three trade sources with direct knowledge of the matter
the sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media
maersk oil is a major ship fuel supplier globally but has not had its own storage tanks in singapore for the supply of marine fuels to its customers which include
the world s biggest container line
the move comes ahead of the introduction of new rules on marine fuels that will limit the sulphur content to percent from percent currently to curb pollution
maersk announced in august a deal with royal vopak an independent tank storage operator to launch a percent sulphur fuel bunkering facility in rotterdam
the joint initiative will meet about percent of maersk s global demand for imo compliant fuels and we are looking into more bunkering facilities like this lindegaard head of maersk oil trading told reuters last month
the singapore storage lease comes at a time of a steeply backwardated market structure which has led several suppliers not to renew their fuel oil storage contracts in singapore this year the sources said
storing oil products is difficult in a backwardated market since prompt prices are higher than forward prices making it difficult for traders to recover the costs of storage
the singapore strait is one of the world s busiest shipping superhighways allowing singapore to position itself as the world s largest bunkering hub with more than ships calling at the for refuelling each year
