minutes of the central bank s policy meeting published on wednesday showed many officials were of the view that the fed could afford to be patient about further policy but with core inflation remaining firm despite a strong dollar and slowing global growth economists say further rate increases this year can not be ruled out
in addition a tighter labor market is boosting wage growth
