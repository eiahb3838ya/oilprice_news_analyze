explainer-mexico's fuel woes rooted in chronic theft, troubled refineries
mexico city reuters president andres manuel lopez obrador has launched the most sweeping attack against rampant corruption and organised crime of his young administration aiming to stop a growing fuel theft racket that has grown dramatically in recent years
the new leader is seeking to stem the theft from key pipelines that transport fuel but the effort to distribution via trucks has provoked long lines at gas stations while threatening to crimp the economy and damage his popularity if shortages persist
since last month veteran leftist lopez obrador has ordered the closure of six major pipelines especially vulnerable to illegal taps where criminal gangs and other thieves have siphoned off stolen fuel worth billions of dollars
the new president who took office in december won a landslide election victory on promises to root out endemic corruption strengthen ailing national oil company pemex and ensure stable fuel prices
mexico s motor fuel market is a juicy target for thieves
it is the world s sixth biggest according to energy ministry data featuring a total daily demand of nearly million barrels of gasoline and diesel
the mexican government s lack of attention has allowed organised groups to open clandestine taps along pemex s main pipelines
internal complicity at pemex refineries and terminals have also opened the door for theft of entire trucks loaded with fuel
fuel stolen from pemex s infrastructure mostly ends in the hands of the same retailers that legally sell pemex gasoline and diesel
fuel theft has been a problem in mexico for decades but it has been growing in recent years
the crackdown on the drug war has caused gangs to turn to other forms of theft and the nation s network of pipelines proved to be ripe targets
theft escalated in recent years following reforms to the country s oil sector by previous president enrique pena nieto who liberalized the industry for foreign investment
in turn retail prices rose giving cartels an opportunity to undercut those prices through sales of gasoline
thieves tap into pipelines and are currently siphoning off the equivalent of around of total national gasoline consumption about barrels per day bpd according to reuters calculations based on official data
they then mostly to complicit gas stations
pemex documented more than illegal taps to its fuel pipeline network during the first months of more than in the previous year
the widespread theft costs pemex more than billion annually according to official numbers
lopez obrador has said upwards of percent of the theft is organised by pemex employees though he has not provided evidence
he has also pointed to reports that the union has been restricting access to parts of the company s operations
central and western states including queretaro guanajuato hidalgo michoacan and jalisco are most afflicted by the pipeline theft as well as pemex s salamanca refinery which has been especially plagued by organised crime and violent disruptions
for years pemex s six domestic oil refineries have operated well bellow their capacity due to a mix of underinvestment deferred maintenance and frequent accidents including deadly explosions that have provoked costly stoppages
las year the refineries operated at about a third of their day crude processing capacity compared with when they processed nearly million barrels of crude a day
pemex gasoline output falls as imports rise mexico has grown increasingly dependent on fuel imports in recent years with imported gasoline distillates and liquefied petroleum gas growing last year to about of total demand
in imports and domestic production each accounted for roughly half
mexico has marine terminals capable of receiving imported fuel plus storage facilities and over kilometres of pipelines
the imports flow mainly through the pajaritos tuxpan and veracruz terminals on the country s gulf coast which have recently turned into bottlenecks for the imports
mexico is a critical export market for refiners and trading firms and is the biggest buyer of gasoline and diesel
in october the united states exported bpd of gasoline to mexico accounting for roughly percent of the million bpd exported that month according to the energy information administration eia
while the volumes are much lower than supplies transported by sea rail shipments of fuels across the land border have also grown substantially as firms have capitalized on mexico s growing demand hitting record highs several times since early according to data from the association of american railroads the largest rail trade group
the new government began the closure of major fuel pipelines on december
production at pemex s gulf coast madero and minatitlan refineries has also been partially or completely halted which contributes to the need for imported fuels as a replacement
lopez obrador hopes some tanker trucks can distribute supplies to over gas stations scattered across the country
while the vast majority of the stations are pemex franchises a growing number belong to new private entrants including giant exxonmobil and trading firm glencore which in some cases import their own fuel
the cost of transporting gasoline and diesel by tanker trucks is nearly times more expensive than via pipelines according to a study by mexico s federal commission for economic competition or cofece
both pemex and lopez obrador have sought to assure an increasingly restless public that there is plenty of gasoline and that refineries and other key installations are being supervised by soldiers
he has also pleaded with citizens to be patient while the new distribution system is normalized
lopez obrador s team has yet to explain how it will finance the much more expensive distribution costs it is now incurring
