update 1-mexican ports see bottlenecks as fuel distribution slows -traders
mexico city reuters bottlenecks for offloading imported fuel are forming at some mexican oil ports following government orders to shut pipelines to limit losses from widespread fuel theft according to traders and refinitiv eikon data
with storage limited in mexico the decision by president andres manuel lopez obrador to shut pipelines and move fuel mostly by rail and truck has slowed transport causing long lines for consumers and slowed deliveries at ports where more than million barrels of fuel enough for several days of use in mexico languish
the crackdown on fuel theft a crime that has drained billions of dollars from state coffers and is blamed for rising violence in some regions is the leftist president s first major move against criminals and corruption since taking office in december but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy
lines of drivers snaked from gas stations in mexico city on wednesday as the government crackdown on fuel theft led to panic purchases despite assurances from lopez obrador that his efforts were succeeding
rocio nahle mexico s energy minister said in an interview on thursday that the she had no information on port bottlenecks but added that terminals are almost full and inventory drainage from them is running slow as a portion of distribution is being made by truck
there is product
we are buying
terminals are almost full we have much product and are moving it
transportation by truck is slower than by pipeline she said
petroleos mexicanos pemex started building an inventory on in preparation for pipeline closures nahle said on wednesday
she denied there was fuel scarcity in mexico which is among the world s top four importers of gasoline
but fuel distribution to stations has slowed in recent days because of the switch to less efficient truck transportation
backlogs of tankers bringing imported fuel have started forming around pemex s maritime terminals which are not draining inventories at their typical rhythm also creating delays for tanker unloading the traders said
as of mexico s main port of entry for fuel imports pajaritos in the gulf had tankers waiting to discharge some of them since december
the neighbouring tuxpan terminal had tankers waiting to discharge gasoline and other fuel including liquefied petroleum gas lpg according to the eikon data
the vessels are jointly carrying about million barrels of fuel enough for nearly five days of consumption
as limitations to import fuel by vessel have grown pemex s trading arm pmi has tapped suppliers to secure fuel by rail from the united states one of the traders added
pmi is securing as much by rail as possible both for gasoline and ultra low sulphur diesel ulsd
this is limited by the rail loading and unloading capabilities still in both the and mexico the trader said
the company has had no problems finding suppliers in the united states another trader said adding that fuel shortages in some areas of mexico are not the result of fewer imports but caused by domestic distribution hiccups
pemex is producing some barrels per day bpd of gasoline lopez obrador said slightly above november s average of bpd
there s enough fuel in the country lopez obrador said on monday
he said that retail domestic prices have not increased mostly because of lower international prices
but pemex s fuel production from january to november was percent less than for all of and it has recently struggled to maintain refineries in service
to compensate for declining domestic fuel output pemex has ramped up imports
for last year through november it purchased bpd about of mexico s consumption compared with the bpd it imported in which represented percent of consumption
some independent retailers that started operating in mexico after reforms opening the energy sector are separately importing themselves
all the purchases are making mexico increasingly dependent on imported fuel mostly from the united states
but the country still only has enough storage capacity for three days of consumption causing bottlenecks to show up quickly
more vessels booked from west coast refineries in december are on the way causing more of a logjam
if the plan was to use trucks instead of pipelines to move product it has failed one broker said
