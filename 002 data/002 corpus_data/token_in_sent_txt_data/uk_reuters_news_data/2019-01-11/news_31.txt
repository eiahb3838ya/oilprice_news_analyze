exclusive-lessors to india's troubled jet airways consider taking back planes -sources
delhi reuters crisis talks between india s jet airways ltd and aircraft lessors have failed to ease a row over late payments prompting some lessors to explore taking back aircraft three people familiar with the matter told reuters
in what one of the people described as an showdown between the airline and some of the world s leading leasing firms jet s main lender state bank of india sought to provide reassurance that india s biggest carrier is doing all it can to pay its staff suppliers and creditors
jet has been delinquent for many months
nobody wants to get in a situation where the problems worsen and it becomes even more difficult to take out aircraft one of the people said
jet controls over a sixth of a market experiencing an unprecedented boom in air travel
yet high fuel taxes a weak rupee and price competition have squeezed profitability leaving jet with billion rupees billion in net debt as at the end of september and defaulting on payments
the airline had previously told some lessors it would clear arrears by but was unable do so the people close to the matter said
for an interactive graphic on india aviation market click at meetings on tuesday held at sbi s headquarters in mumbai s business district the bank s chairman rajnish kumar was asked how jet planned to raise equity or debt said one of the people an attendee who found the responses lacked sufficient detail
other attendees included jet s management team including the airline s founder and chairman naresh goyal as well as a senior adviser of etihad airways which owns percent of jet and which did not provide any assurances the person said
an official from punjab national bank later said lenders have agreed to extend some help to jet but details on the mechanics of it are still being worked out
some lessors have engaged with lawyers are working with their technical teams about repossession and are monitoring the planes but the situation could be complicated by a new bankruptcy law that allows up to days where no action is permitted against the debtor or its assets the person said
lessors such as ge capital aviation services gecas smbc aviation capital and jackson square are looking into stopping the transfer of boeing co max jets that had been due for delivery to jet the person said
a second person said deliveries of max jets from lessors had been behind schedule since november
avolon dae aerospace boc aviation ltd and aircastle ltd also attended the meetings along with gecas and smbc one of the people said declining to specify which are considering reclaiming planes
jet airways in a statement on friday said the airline is working on its turnaround strategy and updating its partners in real time on efforts taken to improve its liquidity
a comprehensive plan that will ensure business sustainability preserve value and enable the company to honor its obligations was outlined a jet spokesman said in the statement adding that the meeting took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual appreciation
the turnaround plan involves creating a competitive cost structure and restructuring the balance sheet among other things and is expected to deliver a positive impact on the financials of the company he said
sbi and smbc aviation did not immediately respond to requests for comment
dae aerospace gecas aircastle and jackson square did not respond outside of regular business hours
etihad boc aviation and avolon declined to comment
the people familiar with the talks were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified
jet controlled by goyal has turned to etihad for financial help
however the abu dhabi airline is not in any position to sink new equity into jet at this juncture said a person familiar with etihad s position
etihad posted a significant loss at the end of last year that would continue into according to an internal memo seen by sources on thursday
the memo also showed pilots would lose their jobs as the airline cut costs
jet held talks with indian conglomerate tata sons ltd about financial aid last year
sources told reuters that goyal ended the talks because tata would have wanted him to step down or take a less prominent role
a source close to tata on thursday said there had been no recent engagement with jet and doing so was extremely unlikely because tata people had moved on internally
tata sons declined to comment on friday
after the disorderly collapse of kingfisher airlines in india modified rules in line with the cape town convention an international treaty making it easier for foreign owners to repossess aircraft when airlines default on payments
lessors can file a complaint with the government which has the power to cancel the registration of a plane within five working days and allow lessors to repossess it subject to certain conditions including unpaid dues on the aircraft
some laws conflict with full implementation of the convention and the government in october said it was consulting to revise those laws a move that could reduce lease rates for indian carriers
nevertheless the ability to repossess a plane can be a more complicated process in india than in some other countries
on tuesday jet proposed to creditors that it would catch up with debt payments in arrears as of september and from april meet debt payments as they come due showed a document seen by reuters
jet s debt payments will be large over the next few years starting with about billion rupees due by firm icra said in a research note
