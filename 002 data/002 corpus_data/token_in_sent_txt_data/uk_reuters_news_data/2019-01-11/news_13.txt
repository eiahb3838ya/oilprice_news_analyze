the houthis said in november they were halting drone and missile attacks on saudi arabia the united arab emirates and their yemeni allies but tensions have risen recently over how to implement a united deal in hodeidah
the houthis and the government agreed at peace talks in sweden in december to stop fighting in the red sea port city of hodeidah and withdraw forces following months of diplomacy and western pressure
but implementation of the deal the first breakthrough in peace efforts in five years has stalled as the sides disagree on who will control hodeidah after the withdrawal
