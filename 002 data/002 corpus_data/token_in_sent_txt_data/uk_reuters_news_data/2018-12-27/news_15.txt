update 1-russia says unpredictable u.s., protectionism behind oil price volatility
moscow reuters rising protectionism and trade wars and the unpredictability of the administration have greatly contributed to global oil price volatility over the past two years russian energy minister alexander novak said on thursday
oil prices have been volatile falling by more than a third this quarter partly due to rising oil production in the united states
all these uncertainties which are now on the market how china will behave how india will behave trade wars and unpredictability on the part of the administration those are defining factors for price volatility novak said
president donald trump has been a vociferous critic of opec demanding the cartel act in order to cut prices of oil
russia s novak also told reporters that the decision to allow some countries to trade iranian oil after putting tehran under sanctions was one of the key factors behind this month s global pact to cut oil output by million barrels per day
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other top oil producers led by russia have agreed to cut their output beginning in january in order to prop up oil prices
had it been hard sanctions against iran we wouldn t have done it reduce output novak told reporters
he also said that it was highly unlikely that opec and other oil producers would set up a permanent joint structure
according to the minister russia would cut its output by between and million tonnes in the first half of as part of the deal and then it would be able to restore it to million tonnes million barrels per day for the whole on par with
russia has pledged to cut production under its global pact with other producers by around bpd from the million bpd it produced in october its baseline for cutting its output
novak said russia would be able to boost its annual output by million tonnes bpd over the next two years
currently the united states which is not part of the global deal is pumping million bpd of crude more than saudi arabia or russia
novak said it is only a question of time before oil production in the united states begins to decline
i think they are faced with some difficulties
despite the recent boom in their output their efficiency has fallen it is more difficult for them to raise funds he said
