the ministry of economy trade and industry meti estimated crude steel output of the world s producer would drop to million tonnes for the period down percent from a year earlier
this would mean a third consecutive quarterly decline

in october jfe cut its annual crude steel forecast to million tonnes from million tonnes due to severe rains in july and september and technical trouble at the furnace in kurashiki

for the current financial year to march the ministry forecast the country s crude steel output would fall for a second year to million tonnes against million tonnes a year earlier
