russia plays down idea of forming joint organisation with opec given u.s. sanctions risk
moscow reuters it is highly unlikely that opec and other oil producers would set up a joint structure due to the additional red tape it would create as well as the risk of sanctions russian energy minister alexander novak said on thursday
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other top oil producers led by russia have since the end of made an unprecedented joint effort to curb output and support prices
opec and russia jointly produce more than percent of the world s oil
russia s energy ministry had said that moscow and opec lynchpin saudi arabia had reached a general agreement that the format should be institutionalised and extended until and beyond to monitor the market and take joint action if needed
however novak said such an idea has been ditched
there is a consensus that there will be no such organisation
that s because it requires additional bureaucratic brouhaha in relation to financing cartel with the side novak told a briefing to reporters
i think countries will not agree as they don t want to be hit by proposed legislation known as nopec could open opec up to lawsuits but has long laid dormant with previous presidents signalling that they would veto any move to make it law
however president donald trump has been a vocal critic of opec blaming it for high oil prices and urging it to increase output
this won t be an organisation this is some mechanism of cooperation to convene to discuss adopt some memorandums joint resolutions novak said about future cooperation with opec
