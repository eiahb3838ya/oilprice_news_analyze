germany clears legal path for diesel retrofits - bild
berlin dec reuters germany s transport minister has cleared the way for retrofits or hardware fixes to older diesel cars to reduce pollution daily bild reported citing a technical paper it had seen
the paper sets out the requirements for a general operating permit which is necessary for the motor vehicle authority kba to approve the hardware kits a first legal step for retrofits of diesel cars bild said
the kba has however not yet received complete applications for retrofits bild added in an advanced release of an article to run in its friday edition without citing a source
in october the government presented plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners incentives and hardware fixes
but carmakers have not all committed to covering the cost of retrofits which could run into billions of euros
the government can not force carmakers to pay for hardware upgrades but it shares an interest with the industry in preventing further driving bans for cars that pollute more which hamburg has already imposed
other cities including berlin and stuttgart the home of germany s car industry are set to introduce similar bans
