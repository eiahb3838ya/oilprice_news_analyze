germany to extend electric company car tax incentives - paper
berlin reuters german finance minister olaf scholz plans to extend tax incentives for electric company cars he told a newspaper on saturday the government s latest attempt to boost demand for clean vehicles
germany is trying to increase electric car sales in the wake of a diesel emissions cheating scandal that has engulfed its auto industry in the last three years
half of all cars sold in germany are company cars scholz told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung
so i have decided that we will not end tax support for electric cars and hybrid company cars in but extend them maybe over the whole decade he said adding that would help improve air quality and meet climate goals
he added however that the rules for hybrids would be tightened so that only cars that can travel on electric power further than they do today would be eligible
since january drivers of electric company cars which they also use for private journeys pay less tax than they would for a vehicle with a combustion engine
government subsidy schemes have helped boost sales but even with rising demand electric cars made up only percent of new car registrations last year according to the kba motor vehicle authority
the government has acknowledged it will miss its target of having million electric vehicles on the road by by two years
