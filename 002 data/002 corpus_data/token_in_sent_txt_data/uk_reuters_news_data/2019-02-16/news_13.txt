update 7-mexico to inject $3.9 bln in pemex, seeks to prevent credit downgrade
mexico city reuters mexico will inject billion into ailing state oil company pemex officials said on friday promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade although investors saw the plan as only a fix
falling oil output corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride
it now holds roughly billion in financial debt the highest of any national oil company in latin america
fitch and moody s rate its credit one notch above junk
fitch said on friday that the plan which includes additional tax cuts more government spending on the company and debt refinancing would likely not be enough to prevent continued deterioration in pemex s credit quality
the agency cited an ongoing significant level of underinvestment for pemex
pemex will receive billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown officials said in a presentation that was short on details
they vowed the mexican government will not take on new debt in
pemex must make more than billion in debt payments over the next three years
investors said they had expected stronger measures and while encouraged by government vows of support they said the plan offered only relief
the measures are not a long term fix and won t be enough to stabilize oil output said edward glossop latin america economist at capital economics
if oil prices and output decline further he estimated yields on pemex bonds could rise by around percent this year
the price fell after the announcement for pemex s most heavily traded bond on friday maturing in as its yield rose basis points according to marketaxess data
the price on a pemex bond maturing in also dropped with its yield up basis points reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan
what s more the measures will do little to shore up pemex s standing with the ratings agencies said julie murphy a latin america analyst at jp morgan
we are extremely disappointed with the measures she said
the mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement before recovering later on friday
over time pemex taxes will go down and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year finance minister carlos urzua told a press conference
if pemex requires more help the government will do whatever it takes to keep pemex s finances healthy he added
fitch downgraded debt issued by pemex by two steps last month making it the second agency after moody s to put the company just barely within its investment grade category
the move stoked fears that further credit downgrades could significantly raise pemex s financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government
president andres manuel lopez obrador who took office in december and ran on a promise of strengthening pemex did not fully detail in his comments at the news conference how the government would finance the company s lower tax bill and capital injection
he said efforts since late december to battle rampant fuel theft would result in savings of about billion however while a plan to increase production will generate more resources
it s injecting resources it s lowering the tax obligation lopez obrador said
but above all it s cleaning out corruption from investors had expected a stronger response said luis gonzali a portfolio manager at franklin templeton investments
even so he praised the administration s unconditional support to double down on relief measures if necessary
wilbur matthews founder of vaquero global investment also saw the announcement as positive
it is a good sign that the lopez obrador administration recognizes that pemex needs to change profoundly he said
the company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to billion this year refinitiv ifr reported on friday
the company has previously said it would refinance around billion in
