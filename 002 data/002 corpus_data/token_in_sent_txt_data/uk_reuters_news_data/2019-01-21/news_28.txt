corrected-update 2-china's coal output hits highest in over 3 yrs as mines start up
beijing reuters china s december coal output climbed percent from the year before government data showed hitting the highest level in over three years as major miners ramped up production amid robust winter demand and after the country started up new mines
miners produced million tonnes of coal in december according to data released on monday by the national bureau of statistics
that is the largest volume since june
china approved more than billion yuan s billion worth of new coal mining projects last year much more than official documents show
that came after the country closed old and coal mines as part of its battle to clean up the environment
coal mining capacity coming online will lead to another increase in output this year after boosting december output to a more than high said a coal analyst with a major broker
he declined to be identified as he was not authorised by his company to speak to media on the matter
the new projects stoked overall coal output last year with annual production rising percent to the highest since at billion tonnes
however some miners and traders expect supplies to fall sharply in january following a crackdown on coal mines after a major accident on in the northwestern province of shaanxi potentially dragging on output through the year
it is now possible that shaanxi will implement the regulations on illegal production which would significantly reduce output in the province for the year zhai yu senior consultant at analysts wood mackenzie said in a note published last week
if stricter checks are extended to other provinces domestic supply could tighten from its currently relaxed situation helping coal imports as a result zhai wrote
shaanxi accounts for about percent of china s annual coal production
