to meet climate goals, world urged to reuse natural resources
kuala lumpur jan thomson reuters foundation more of the billions of tonnes of materials the world uses each year must be recycled and reused to keep climate change in check researchers said on tuesday
only about a tenth of the nearly billion tonnes of materials utilised annually including minerals metals fossil fuels and biomass are currently put back into service said a report by social enterprise circle economy
ceo harald friedl told the thomson reuters foundation more efficient use of those resources could help avoid overshooting the goals adopted in the paris agreement to limit the average rise in global temperatures to well below degrees celsius and ideally to above times
the circle economy report said percent of emissions excluding land use and forestry are released during the extraction processing and manufacturing of goods
to tackle climate change government policy has so far focused on adopting renewable energies boosting energy efficiency and stopping deforestation the report said
it is like when you look in your closet on a morning and you only look for pants said friedl by phone
we need to change the whole the amount of materials the world uses has tripled since and could double again by if no action is taken the united nations estimates
to reduce waste and emissions economies should seek to become circular by reusing products friedl added
to make things circular may be painful from changing consumer and business habits to telling countries to put up the right regulations but it is feasible he said
in asia economies and urbanisation are driving huge investments in construction and infrastructure offering chances to promote a circular economy said friedl
in europe the report urged countries to maximise the value of existing buildings by extending their lifespan improving energy efficiency and finding new uses for them
the report outlined three broad strategies to shift to a circular economy
the use of products should be maximised such as through or keeping vehicles for longer it said
recycling and reducing waste are also key as is using natural materials in construction like bamboo and wood instead of cement it said
governments should adopt taxation and spending plans that encourage a circular economy raising levies on emissions and excessive waste production while cutting them for labour innovation and investments the report added
financial incentives that promote the overuse of natural resources such as fossil fuels should be abolished it said
it a way to save the world said friedl
