update 4-missteps in mexican pipeline blast trigger new scrutiny of fuel plan
city mexico reuters mexico s new government knew a pipeline was leaking but did not act for hours before a blast killed at least people a minister said on sunday increasing scrutiny of a push to stop fuel theft seen as the president s first crackdown on crime
state oil firm pemex did not close the gasoline pipe when first notified by the military about four hours before friday s blast because it considered the leak minimal security minister alfonso durazo told a news conference
in the hours that followed the leak grew and as many as people brought plastic containers to the gushing duct filling up with free fuel in what witnesses described as an almost festive atmosphere
relatives of some of the victims said fuel shortages stemming from president andres manuel lopez obrador s plan attracted people to the leak at the pipeline a few miles from a major refinery
in december lopez obrador sent soldiers to refineries to help fight organised crime and fuel theft while shutting down pipelines tapped by thieves
the measures have reduced theft but in early january also led to shortages and lines at gas stations stretching for miles
soon after dark on friday in the tlahuelilpan district of the central hidalgo state gasoline and fumes ignited in a fireball that killed at least people and left a black scar on the land
dozens were so badly charred they will only be identified through dna testing officials said
critics say the government did too little to prevent people from gathering at the scene before the explosion was too hasty in sending gasoline through the duct after weeks of it being closed due to the fuel theft crackdown and acted too slowly once the leak was detected
half a dozen people told reuters their relatives went to the leaking duct because they had been struggling to find fuel and were desperate to fill up cars to get to work or run their farms
a lot of innocent people came here perhaps their car didn t have enough gasoline for tomorrow and they said i m just going to go for a few litres said farmer isidoro velasco who said his nephew mario hidalgo was probably killed
pemex had been in a rush to reopen the pipeline to avoid a new round of gasoline shortages in mexico city said gonzalo monroy the head of energy consulting firm gmec citing conversations with oil industry professionals
disputing accounts that fuel thieves opened up the pipe he said sources in pemex indicated the fissure occurred at a spot pemex had previously repaired and gave way under the pressure of a new surge of fuel
pemex officials decided to keep fuel running after the first signs of a leak and send a team to inspect it he said
pemex did not respond to requests for comment
when questioned about why it took so long to close the pipe s valves after the leak was detected durazo said pemex followed protocol
the explosion occurred half an hour after pemex closed the valve he said because gasoline remained in the pipe
lopez obrador said on sunday that the disaster had not weakened his resolve to fight fuel theft
i won t take a single step backwards he said at the first of two news conferences
i can only offer people apologies if this action causes sacrifices harm and lopez obrador said he hoped supply would normalise soon as mexico buys more tanker trucks for distribution by road
if successful in uprooting a parallel fuel network that siphons off about billion worth of fuel from pemex each year the veteran leftist who won last year s election on promises to root out endemic corruption will have scored a big early victory strengthening ailing national oil company pemex and helping stabilise fuel prices
the blast however has raised the stakes
failure would likely not only erode his popularity but pose risks for the economy the world s fuel market
an opinion poll last week showed the fuel strategy was a polarizing issue with about half the population supporting the measure despite the lines at gas stations and other difficulties
pemex initially took the pipeline out of service in late december as the government tried to protect it from gangs who had hit it times in tlahuelilpan pemex chief executive officer octavio romero said on saturday
after pemex began attempting to restart operations on wednesday the line experienced four more attacks
romero said pemex closed a valve at the pipeline on friday after noting a drop in pressure from the leak
pemex informed other authorities of the leak at he added
responding to questions about why fuel kept flowing from the leak up until the explosion lopez obrador said that barrels of gasoline were accumulated in the pipeline between the tula refinery and the village
energy minister rocio nahle said the pipeline was pressurized
lopez obrador said the army which deployed just soldiers before the explosion gave orders for villagers to stay back but were ignored
