ukraine earns transit fees from russian gas russian gas no longer sold to ukraine ukraine still important gas import route for eu no threat to russian gas supplies via ukraine eu adds details on meeting from sources by alissa de carbonnel brussels jan reuters russia and ukraine will meet for further gas talks in may after an discussion in brussels on monday yielded no concrete results russian energy minister alexander novak said
the talks have focused on russian gas transit via ukraine to europe the source of up to percent of ukrainian gross domestic product
with russia embroiled in conflict with kiev over breakaway regions in ukraine s east and the european union reliant on russian gas to fuel its industries the future of gas transit seen by kiev as a crucial guarantor of its independence from moscow is the subject of intricate diplomacy
russian president vladimir putin has said moscow is ready to keep its transit of gas to europe through ukraine once the current deal with kiev expires on if supplies are economically viable
ukrainian state energy company naftogaz accused russia of delaying negotiations in order to get its nord stream pipeline built first
russia s planned doubling of capacity on the nord stream pipeline across the baltic sea to germany could help moscow bypass exports via ukraine
that would deny kiev transit fees
gazprom is delaying real talks in terms of transit in order to build nord stream naftogaz deputy chief executive yuriy vitrenko told reuters before the talks on monday
then they will say we are ok without any ukrainian transits at all russian gas giant gazprom s partners in the billion nord stream pipeline project include germany s uniper and wintershall and france s engie
talks sources familiar with monday s talks said european commission maros sefcovic who chaired the meeting with ukrainian foreign minister pavlo klimkin and novak had floated a proposal for the two countries to agree a new transit contract with a guaranteed minimum yearly transit volume of billion cubic metres bcm and bcm of additional flexibility
there was no immediate reaction from either the russian or ukraine delegations
executives from naftogaz and gazprom also attended the meeting
moscow and kiev have clashed frequently over energy
talks are complicated by a lengthy legal dispute between gazprom and naftogaz that led to a stockholm arbitration court ruling in february that each company must compensate the other
sefcovic said the stockholm arbitration was the elephant in the room
naftogaz emerged the net winner of that ruling gaining billion from gazprom
gazprom is challenging the decision a process that could take years
for the russians it is a huge stumbling block sefcovic said
for them it is difficult to negotiate a good contract for the long term when they are still fighting the legal reporting by alissa de carbonnel in brussel and vladimir soldatkin in moscow editing by jason fenton
