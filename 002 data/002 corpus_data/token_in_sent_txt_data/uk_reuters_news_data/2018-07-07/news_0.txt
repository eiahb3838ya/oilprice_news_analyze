mexico's next president aims to end foreign fuel imports in 3 years
mexico city july reuters mexican andres manuel lopez obrador will seek to end the country s massive fuel imports nearly all from the united states during the first three years of his term while also boosting refining at home
the landslide winner of last sunday s election told reporters on saturday morning before attending private meetings with members of his future cabinet that he will also prioritize growing crude oil production domestically which has fallen sharply for years
the objective is that we stop buying foreign gasoline by the half way point of my term said lopez obrador repeating a position he and his senior energy advisor staked out during the campaign
we are going to immediately revive our oil activity exploration and the drilling of wells so we have crude oil he said
on the campaign trail the leftist former mayor of mexico city pitched his plan to wean the country off foreign gasoline as a means to increasing domestic production of crude and fuels not as a trade issue with the united states
lopez obrador also reiterated on saturday his goal to build either one large or two oil refineries during his term which begins on december
while he said the facilities will be built in the gulf coast states of tabasco and possibly campeche he has been less clear on how the refineries would be funded
so far this year mexico has imported an average of about barrels per day bpd of gasoline and another bpd of diesel as output at the country s domestic refineries has steadily declined
foreign gasoline imports have grown by nearly while diesel imports have more than doubled since the first year of outgoing president enrique pena nieto s term according to data from national oil company pemex
meanwhile the six oil refineries in mexico owned and operated by pemex are producing at far below their capacity or an average of bpd of gasoline so far this year
gasoline production at the facilities is down percent compared to and domestic gasoline output only accounts for slightly more than a quarter of national demand from the country s legions of motorists
during the campaign the presidential also promised to strengthen pemex
he also was sharply critical of a constitutional energy overhaul that ended the company s monopoly and allowed international oil majors to operate fields on their own for the first time in decades
the overhaul was designed to reverse a oil output slide and has already resulted in competitive auctions that have awarded more than exploration and production contracts to the likes of royal dutch shell and exxonmobil
what s most important is to resolve the problem of falling crude oil production
we re extracting very little oil said lopez obrador
during the first five months of this year mexican crude oil production averaged about million bpd a dramatic drop compared to peak output of nearly million bpd in or million bpd in
