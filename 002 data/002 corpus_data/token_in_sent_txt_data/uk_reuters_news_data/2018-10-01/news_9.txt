just as saudi arabia is about to switch the way it prices its oil exports the new benchmark throws a spanner in the works by surging inexplicably
oman crude futures traded on the dubai mercantile exchange dme rushed to their highest level in four years last week trading as high as a barrel on
while the sharp rise in prices isn t without precedent especially given market concern over the imminent loss of much of iran s exports what was unusual was that oman swept past brent futures the global benchmark
this has happened only on a handful of occasions in the past decade most recently in september last year and then only for a day and at a relatively modest premium of cents a barrel according to calculations by s p global platts
oman and brent futures have different daily settlement times but when the dme contract finished on it was at a barrel while at that time brent was at
oman normally trades below brent as it is a crude which is typically more costly for refiners to process and doesn t yield as much of the products such as gasoline as does brent which is a light sweet oil
for oman to romp to such a large premium to brent and maintain it for four sessions is unusual and will no doubt be of concern to both the dme and saudi arabia as well as the refiners who buy saudi crude
traders appear largely to have been caught by surprise by last week s spike in oman if comments at the annual industry gathering in singapore were anything to go by
but the likelihood is that the increase in oman will be unwound in coming days given that it seems to have been largely driven by buying by chinese refiners
the bulk of delivered oman heads to china and it appears that refiners in the world s largest crude importer especially smaller independent operators were keen to stock up before the end of the year to use up their import allocations
chinese buying may also have been boosted by the fact that this week is a holiday for the country s national day meaning most crude trading businesses will be closed
there is also likely a smaller element of buying boosting the oman contract and that is the potential looming shortage of heavier and sour grades of crude as renewed sanctions against iran ramp up to include all of the islamic republic s crude exports from november
many asian refiners prefer heavier crudes having invested in units that can process these grades into higher value products especially middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel
while it s likely that oman s premium to brent will be unwound in coming days the timing couldn t have been worse for saudi aramco the producer that is the world s largest exporter of crude
from october aramco was changing the benchmarks used in calculating its official selling prices osps for the first time since the
the saudis used to use the average of oman and dubai prices as assessed by s p global platts in calculating the osps
from this month it will use the average monthly price of dme oman futures as well as the platts average for physical dubai quotes
the change has been a long time coming and is perhaps a reflection of the success the dme has had in building oman futures into a viable benchmark for middle east medium heavy and sour crude
the platts assessments are also and in the market but were perhaps more vulnerable to price spikes given the relatively small amount of physical crude underpinning the pricing
this happened in when the trading arms of china s refiners bought up large amounts of the oil available through the platts pricing mechanism in a matter of days leaving the pricing subject to volatility and spikes
the switch to using dme futures as of the saudi benchmark was supposed to make the pricing more transparent and robust given the oman contract has more physical volumes behind it and the backing of a cleared exchange
but last week s surge has shown that the oman contract can also shift dramatically in a short space of time if the demand for crude is there
the saudi osps tend to set the pattern for crude pricing from iran iraq and kuwait meaning some million barrels per day of exports are impacted
asian refiners will now be worried that last week s price action will result in higher than anticipated osps with the saudis likely to announce their prices at the end of this week
this isn t the start the dme and aramco would have wanted for the new pricing system but the chances are it is merely a blip rather than the harbinger of sustained volatility and uncertainty
