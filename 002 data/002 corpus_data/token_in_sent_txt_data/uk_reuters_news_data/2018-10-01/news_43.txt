analysis-electric cars cast growing shadow on profits
goals push prices lower vw among brands seen pricing aggressively concerns mount over profitability by laurence frost paris oct reuters electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in european showrooms after years of hyped launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers
now comes the hard part selling them at a profit
battery models making their debut in paris this week from psa group s electric crossback to the mercedes eqc will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black executives generally acknowledge
but concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals
what everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is like organic food it s more expensive said carlos tavares chief executive of peugeot citroen and opel manufacturer psa
a profit warning by bmw blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules was a first alarm signal tavares said in a weekend radio interview
either we accept paying more for clean mobility or we put the european auto industry in underlining the turbulence facing automakers british prime minister theresa may will confront conservative rebels demanding a harder brexit stance at her party s annual conference just as the paris show gets underway on tuesday
on its second day the european parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as percent by from an average grammes per kilometre in a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros
after declining for a decade carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to suvs and from diesel to gasoline engines
diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates but less
early signs suggest prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite
that promises more red ink as discounted battery car sales finally take off
volkswagen has said the id hatchback due to open the brand s electric onslaught next year will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the golf compact
vw is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines and therefore at a loss said laurent petizon a managing director at consulting firm alixpartners
our interpretation is that the fines have already been factored into their sales strategy he said
rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail
we want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped golf diesel a spokesman said
volkswagen and mercedes parent daimler which between them have announced billion euros billion in electrification investment both warned last month that it would not be enough
they and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in china and a group of states led by california
more than electric and model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years
electric cars still cost euros more to produce on average than conventional ones alixpartners calculates
hybrids which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine overshoot by euros
when that cost gap is reflected in the price few are sold
electrics such as the renault zoe and nissan leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade and heavily subsidized in europe while tesla has made inroads into the premium business
yet cars claim just percent of the market overall
despite their higher cost bmw models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels
the luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner
mercedes also says the eqc electric suv will be priced close to its glc cousin to tackle tesla s model
it absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry said rebecca lindland a senior analyst at kelley blue book which tracks vehicle pricing
demand doesn t justify investment at all it s all which is why on this subject more than most european carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths
while executives exude confidence for investors and customers benefit their brussels lobby group acea warns of an imminent threat to the region s million automotive manufacturing jobs
the conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren t met and consumers just aren t ready for acea secretary general erik jonnaert said recently
carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks which may yet awaken mass demand
economies of scale should also bring some relief
but batteries which claim percent of an electric car s value face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way inflating costs as production volumes rise
perhaps more critically generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth
in markets where incentives have been dropped electric car sales have fallen
renault is discounting its recently upgraded zoe in the uk market with a pound bonus in addition to the government s pound incentive
french rival psa will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates programme director olivier salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold
we don t launch vehicles with negative operating margins salvat said
german luxury carmakers including volkswagen group which includes audi and porsche could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners upscale suvs and large sedans
that would leave competitors such as psa and renault which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost in a tougher bind
in electromobility you have to be a cost leader bmw research and development chief klaus froehlich told reuters
if you are not a cost leader you will not pounds reporting by laurence frost additional reporting by esha vaish in stockholm gilles guillaume and joe white in paris edward taylor in frankfurt editing by mark potter
