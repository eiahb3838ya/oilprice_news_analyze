rwe still comfortable investing in uk despite prospect of 'hard' brexit - executive
london reuters german utility rwe is still comfortable investing in britain despite the possibility of a hard brexit when the country leaves the european union next march a senior executive at the company told reuters on monday
rwe generation uk is the country s electricity generator producing more than percent of britain s power
it operates the largest fleet of power plants in britain along with some coal and biomass plants and employs up to people in the uk
britain is due to leave the european union on march yet little about the process is clear
there is so far no full exit deal rivals to prime minister theresa may are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a second referendum
a hard brexit is not good for companies on a level with the possibility of economic downturn tom glover chief commercial officer at rwe generation said on the sidelines of the bloomberg nef future of energy summit
there is operational risk from a hard brexit but we are still comfortable investing money in the uk he said adding that rwe invests around million pounds million a year in britain currently
the company would like more detail from the government when it delivers its autumn budget statement later this month on carbon price plans after brexit glover said
currently britain is a member of the eu s emissions trading system which charges the eu s factories and power plants for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
prices of eu carbon permits have rallied to around euros a tonne making it more expensive to burn fossil fuels
however it is not clear whether britain will have to leave the eu ets due to brexit and whether it will set up its own carbon market and link to the eu one
in march this year german utility and rival rwe announced a major asset swap
under the deal rwe s networks and renewables business innogy will be broken up and its assets split between and rwe
glover said rwe will get wind power assets from innogy and becoming the second biggest offshore wind player in the world and the third biggest renewables player in europe
rwe is still working on its renewables strategy which will commit at least billion euros a year to renewables investment
exactly how and where that will be deployed will be detailed in the strategy next year probably in the first quarter of next year glover added
