column-hedge funds doubt saudi arabia will replace iranian oil:kemp
london reuters hedge fund managers are increasingly betting saudi arabia and its allies can not or will not replace all the crude lost from the market when sanctions on iran go into effect fully from november
hedge funds and other money managers increased their combined net long position in the six major petroleum contracts by another million barrels in the week to
portfolio managers have raised their combined net long position by a total of million barrels over the last five weeks according to exchange and regulatory data
bullish long positions now outnumber bearish short ones by a ratio of more than and the imbalance is rapidly closing in on the record back in april
but the new wave of hedge fund bullishness is concentrated almost entirely in brent rather than wti or refined fuels
chartbook fund managers have raised their net in brent by million barrels since compared with an increase of just million in wti
fund managers now hold a net long position of almost million barrels in brent betting prices will increase even further from their current high
hedge fund long positions outnumber short ones in brent by more than up from a ratio of just at the start of august and closing in on the record set in april
traders foresee a shortage of seaborne crudes linked to brent as sanctions on iran go into effect on despite reassurances from saudi arabia russia and the united states supplies will remain adequate
concern about feedstock shortages linked to sanctions explains why has been overwhelmingly concentrated in brent rather than wti or refined fuels
the inland crude market remains and refined fuel markets appear balanced as an international freight slowdown and higher prices take their toll on consumption
but brent spot prices have climbed by more than per barrel percent since while the calendar spread has risen almost and swung from contango into a pronounced backwardation
saudi arabia and russia have both pledged to increase production to make up for the loss of crude oil exports from iran
officials have been working with refiners in asia to find replacements or iranian oil
none of that has assuaged fears about shortfalls in crude availability as sanctions go into effect
some analysts question whether saudi arabia has enough spare capacity to replace all the barrels lost as a result of sanctions while maintaining enough in reserve to meet any further shortfalls
others question whether the kingdom is willing to increase production enough to act as a cap on prices or bring them back down below despite political pressure from the united states
the enormous concentration of hedge fund long positions in brent creates a significant risk of a price reversal if and when fund managers attempt to realise some of their profits following the rally
for the time being however with doubts swirling around the outlook for oil supplies the message from hedge fund managers is simple show me the barrels
