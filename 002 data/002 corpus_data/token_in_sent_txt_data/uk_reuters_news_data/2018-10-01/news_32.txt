feature-long road ahead for asian drivers revving up to go electric
kuala lumpur oct thomson reuters foundation when benjamin jacob stops his new scooter at traffic lights in malaysia s capital fellow drivers sometimes flash their lights or honk their horns at him though he has done nothing wrong
with his silent electric motorcycle other users of kuala lumpur s congested roads wrongfully assume the has turned off his engine or fallen asleep at the wheel
but the delivery driver is always alert especially since he was picked to take part in a new pilot project run by logistics giant dhl ecommerce
when drivers beep at him or wind down their windows jacob lets them know he rides an electric bike that makes no sound
parcel delivery firm dhl ecommerce is testing electric vehicles in malaysia and vietnam for a year as it works towards a goal of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by
as well as helping companies boost their green credentials electric vehicles ease air pollution and can reduce a country s costly oil imports
if the electricity that powers them is from renewable sources they can also help meet the emissions reduction targets submitted by governments for the paris agreement to curb climate change
cities in the region have seen unprecedented growth over the last two decades
many face air pollution crises crippling congestion and other challenges related to mobility and infrastructure
tackling noise pollution is also becoming increasingly important to improve the wellbeing of residents
the dhl project is rare in asia which experts say lags other regions in creating the right incentives regulatory frameworks and infrastructure needed to make electric vehicles more attractive to both drivers and businesses
at first dhl wanted to pilot the project in three countries but regulatory issues and limited availability of in thailand prevented it from launching there it said
globally the group hopes to replace percent of all the vehicles it uses for first and delivery services with cleaner energy versions by
after one year we will see which bike does the best and how practical it is to scale up and look at more fleet joining us anil gautam managing director for dhl ecommerce malaysia told the thomson reuters foundation
around the world electric and hybrid cars topped million in a percent jump from according to a report by the international energy agency iea
china was the largest electric car market accounting for half sold last year about cars
facing public health risks from increasingly polluted cities the chinese government has put in place clear targets for electric vehicle sales said nick twork general manager for innovation and technology communications at the alliance in paris
china has also invested in technology and mass production to bring down costs and make electric vehicles more affordable he added
the united states had the number of vehicles with about cars sold last year although nordic countries lead on market share the iea said
norway was in the top slot with electric cars making up percent of new car sales
china and japan aside experts said asian governments should consult more with industry and consumers to improve policies on electric vehicles especially as the economic advantages of switching to electric from fossil fuel vehicles are slim
there is a need to expand infrastructure for electric vehicle charging beyond homes and work places a key barrier to of electric vehicles in the region said dominic patella a transport specialist with the world bank in brussels
governments can also provide incentives or subsidies for electric vehicle buyers including registration and tax breaks for sellers experts said
where this generally works is when you have close cooperation between industry and government and there are economic incentives for both infrastructure and the purchase of vehicles said twork of
preferential parking and lane access are other options for cities many of which already ban diesel vehicles from the centre at busy times of day or have curfews to reduce noise pollution
governments meanwhile can make it easier to import electric vehicles and play a role in persuading public and private transport providers to go electric
sometimes it takes government intervention to enable the uptake of electric mobility and that s where you need good policy good programmes good investments to enable good things to take place in the transport sector said patella
businesses like parcel delivery and taxi companies have an easier route to switching to electric fleets because they can track routes and busy times and recharge during quiet periods
charging time for the dhl scooters is between to minutes for a range of about km miles but this differs depending on the make of motorcycle tested weight of the load and driver battery age and the type of charger used
most privately owned electric vehicles take hours to charge up a process usually done overnight but experts said the cost of batteries and charge times are falling fast
between and aims to cut the cost of its batteries by percent with a charge time and an overall range of km
while electrified delivery fleets are expected to take off in other parts of the world first asia is a fast follower given the rise in parcel delivery and freight across the region especially from china said andrew campbell who provides technical support for the philippines project
the programme aims to electrify and replace all the country s tuk tuks and has rolled out about so far
somewhere between the five and mark we are going to see a said campbell
