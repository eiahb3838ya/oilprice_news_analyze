exclusive-u.s. prepares high-seas crackdown on n.korea sanctions evaders - sources
washington reuters the trump administration and key asian allies are preparing to expand interceptions of ships suspected of violating sanctions on north korea a plan that could include deploying coast guard forces to stop and search vessels in waters senior officials said
washington has been talking to regional partners including japan south korea australia and singapore about coordinating a crackdown that would go further than ever before in an attempt to squeeze pyongyang s use of seagoing trade to feed its nuclear missile programme several officials told reuters
while suspect ships have been intercepted before the emerging strategy would expand the scope of such operations but stop short of imposing a naval blockade on north korea
pyongyang has warned it would consider a blockade an act of war
the strategy calls for closer tracking and possible seizure of ships suspected of carrying banned weapons components and other prohibited cargo to or from north korea according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
depending on the scale of the campaign the united states could consider beefing up the naval and air power of its pacific command they said
the initiative which has not been previously reported shows washington s increasing urgency to force north korea into negotiations over the abandonment of its weapons programs the officials said
north korea may be only a few months away from completing development of a missile capable of hitting the mainland despite existing international sanctions that at times have been sidestepped by smuggling and transfers at sea of banned goods according to officials
there is no doubt we all have to do more short of direct military action to show north korean leader kim jong un we mean business said a senior administration official
the white house declined official comment
the effort could target vessels on the high seas or in the territorial waters of countries that choose to cooperate
it was unclear however to what extent the campaign might extend beyond asia
washington on friday slapped sanctions on dozens more companies and vessels linked to north korean shipping trade and urged the united nations to blacklist a list of entities a move it said was aimed at shutting down north korea s illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal
tighter sanctions plus a more assertive approach at sea could dial up tensions at a time when fragile diplomacy between north and south korea has gained momentum
it would also stretch military resources needed elsewhere possibly incur massive new costs and fuel misgivings among some countries in the region
the initiative which is being developed would be fraught with challenges that could risk triggering north korean retaliation and dividing the international community
china and russia which have blocked efforts at the united nations to win approval for use of force in north korea interdiction operations are likely to oppose new actions if they see the united states as overstepping
a chinese official speaking on condition of anonymity said such steps should only be taken under united nations auspices
china s foreign ministry in a statement to reuters said they did not know anything about the plan but that in principle china believes resolutions on north korea should be fully and thoroughly implemented
at the same time we hope relevant countries act in accordance with security council resolutions and international law it added without elaborating
but washington is expected to start gradually ratcheting up such operations soon even if discussions with allies have not been completed according to the senior official
experts are developing legal arguments for doing more to stop vessels citing the last security council resolution which they say opened the door by calling on states to inspect suspect ships on the high seas or in their waters
washington is also drawing up rules of engagement aimed at avoiding armed confrontation at sea the officials said
a japanese ruling party lawmaker briefed by the government said discussions with the united states were focussed on the need for stepped up cooperation on surveillance and between washington tokyo and seoul regarding transfers suspected of violating sanctions and on the need to notify authorities in ports of origin
the lawmaker as well as a japanese defence ministry official involved in policy planning said that under current sanctions the agreement of the flag state and ship captain was necessary to conduct inspections on the high seas
i think it is unlikely that the will strengthen the sanctions so that inspections on high seas are possible without agreement the japanese defence official said
from the viewpoint of the country in question that would be an act of war he said referring to north korea
treasury secretary steve mnuchin told reporters in washington on friday the united states does not rule out boarding ships for inspections
but officials said privately that such action especially the use of boarding crews would be decided on a and with utmost caution
some officials believe the risk could be minimized if coast guard cutters which carry less firepower and technically engage in missions are used in certain cases rather than warships
the coast guard declined to address whether it might deploy ships to the region but acknowledged its ties to countries there
future ship deployments would depend on foreign policy objectives and the operational availability of our assets said spokesman lieutenant commander dave french
a senior south korean government official said there had been discussions over intensified maritime interdictions including at a foreign ministers meeting in vancouver last month where secretary of state rex tillerson pressed counterparts on the issue
we are discussing with various countries including the and south korea how to fully implement the sanctions but i have not heard talk of creating a framework or a coalition said the japanese defence ministry official involved in policy planning
japan s foreign ministry in reply to a question from reuters repeated tokyo s call for maximum pressure on pyongyang
the ministry declined to comment on specific discussions with other countries but said japan continued its close collaboration with the rok south korea and the international community including china and russia to secure the effectiveness of security council resolutions to achieve the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula
the trump administration has also sought greater cooperation from southeast asian countries which may have little military capability to assist but are seen as sources of intelligence on ship movements officials said
the more partners we have the more resources we have to dedicate to the effort said chris ford assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation
he declined to talk about discussions with specific countries
washington is especially interested in detecting of transfers at sea of banned goods something north korea has increasingly resorted to as vessels have faced greater scrutiny of their cargo in asian ports the officials said
reuters reported in december that russian tankers had supplied fuel to north korea at sea in a violation of sanctions
washington also said at the time it had evidence that vessels from several countries including china had engaged in shipping oil products and coal
china denied the allegation
interception of ships close to chinese waters is something likely to be avoided in favour of informing chinese authorities of banned cargo onboard and asking them do the inspection one official said
it s probably impossible to stop everything but you can raise the cost to north korea said david shear former deputy secretary of defence for asia under president barack obama
