update 1-germany could impose limited diesel car bans in strategy shift
berlin reuters germany s government which has steadfastly opposed barring diesel cars from cities is working on changes to allow driving bans on certain routes on an emergency basis documents seen by reuters showed
junior transport minister norbert barthle a conservative disclosed the shift in a reply to a parliamentary question by the greens party first reported by the rheinische post
the plans come days before a german court rules on whether cities can implement bans which carmakers say could cut the resale value of up to million vehicles in europe s largest car market forcing manufacturers to pay for modifications
german chancellor angela merkel s government is under pressure to help cities whose emissions violate european union standards and is keen to find ways to avoid broad bans
a new legal basis is to be established that would allow driving bans or restrictions on certain limited routes to protect human health against particulates or emissions nitrogen oxide barthle said in the reply
that would make possible for the first time emergency measures to protect against particulates he said
the new rules could be finalised by the end of the year
merkel has stressed the need to find solutions quickly for the affected cities and said she wants to avoid driving bans which could anger drivers by focusing on switching fleets of taxis and buses to electric propulsion
germany is also considering plans to make public transport free in cities suffering from poor air quality
germany s highest federal administrative court is due to rule on tuesday on an appeal brought by german states against bans imposed by local courts in stuttgart and duesseldorf over bad air quality
there has been a global backlash against cars since volkswagen admitted in to cheating exhaust tests meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide nox which cause respiratory disease
while other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars bans in germany would be a big blow to the car industry and an embarrassment for merkel s government which has long backed the industry which employs people
german carmakers have invested heavily in diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals but the vw scandal has forced manufacturers to increase efforts on electric cars and invest in making diesel engines cleaner
oliver luksic transport expert for germany s free democrats fdp said the plans were a disappropriation for millions of drivers and a confession from the government that they had failed to tackle the diesel scandal
many people have bought diesel cars in good faith now their vehicles will lose value and won t be used in many big cities
there is no way to avoid modifications of diesel cars at the expense of carmakers luksic said
