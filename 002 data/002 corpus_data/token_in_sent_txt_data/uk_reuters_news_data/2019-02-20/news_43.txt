update 2-air france-klm to battle fuel costs with deeper integration
paris reuters air pledged new efficiency gains to offset higher fuel costs this year as the airline group deepens cooperation between its two main carriers
presenting earnings for the group he joined in september chief executive ben smith promised networks and fleets after overcoming klm resistance to closer integration with air france in a new boardroom deal
these first achievements pave the way for our ambition to regain a leading position in europe and worldwide smith said
after opening lower air shares rose percent to euros at gmt
underlining smith s challenge earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda fell pct to million euros million as the fuel bill mounted despite a percent revenue gain to billion
unit revenue fell pct in the last three months of and will decline further in the current quarter the group said
air has trailed rivals lufthansa and british airways on profitability held back by restrictive french union deals and strikes that last year wiped million euros off earnings and forced out its previous ceo
but smith an air canada veteran has restored labor peace by granting wage hikes in return for increased flexibility with which he now hopes to make better and more profitable use of the group s aircraft and networks
on the eve of the results presentation air struck a new pay deal with its french pilots and resolved a standoff with klm and the dutch division s popular leader pieter elbers over smith s integration plans
wariness on the dutch side is partly explained by the relative underperformance of air france whose operating margin was percent or percent excluding the impact of strikes compared with percent for klm
almost years after the air merger decisions on networks fleets and commercial strategy will now be taken by the group rather than the individual carriers under the plans unveiled on tuesday which also see elbers and air france counterpart anne rigail become deputy group ceos
the financials were broadly in line with expectations of million euros of ebitda on billion in revenue based on the median of seven analyst estimates in a poll by infront data
while a new ceo with an impressive track record has been appointed and pay deals agreed with the french unions we await details of his new strategy liberum analysts said in a note
the fuel bill rose by million euros in and will climb another million this year as hedges expire chief financial officer frederic gagey told reporters on a call
overall unit costs up percent last year before currency and impacts were well under control gagey said adding that while a later easter holiday will likely lead to lower unit revenue in the first quarter summer bookings are already better positioned
the group said costs are expected to come in somewhere between flat and a percent decline on the same basis
passenger traffic rose pct to million in the last quarter the group said while crossing the million threshold for the full year
the transavia arm was a bright spot posting a percent operating margin for its french operations as it expand services by percent in with a more modest percent growth at group level to include eight new air france destinations from
the new labor deals should provide a financial lift in the cfo said avoiding the strikes and disruption that led to a spike in air france s customer compensation bill last year
the rollout of new digital sales platforms will also generate savings along with improvements to network planning and the gradual replacement of less airbus and boeing planes
the management changes may boost efforts to increase synergies in areas such as purchasing which lacked a single chief procurement officer until last year
smith s centralization push builds on years of painstaking integration that had already assigned some staff to services and managers said gagey who joined air france in
it s not as if we just realized we should begin to look for synergies he said
