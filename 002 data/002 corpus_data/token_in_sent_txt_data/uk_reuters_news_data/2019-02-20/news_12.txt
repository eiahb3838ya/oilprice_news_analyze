verus petroleum outlined last november plans to move to a new phase of growth after its oil and gas production rose fold to barrels of oil equivalent per day boed following three key acquisitions
verus petroleum last year bought cieco the north sea subsidiary of japanese commodity trading house itochu for million

the deals were funded by equity provided by hitecvision cash and debt
verus petroleum s production averaged boed in at an average cost of a barrel according to its website
the north sea has seen a slew of investments in recent years as oil companies such as royal dutch shell and bp reduce their presence in the ageing basin while new often private firms see opportunities to squeeze profits from fields in the region through more nimble operations
verus petroleum s sale process comes as a number of companies are also trying to sell assets in the basin including chevron france s total and conocophillips
