oil near 2019 highs amid opec supply cuts, but rising us output weighs
sanctions on iran venezuela tighten markets but soaring shale output offsets some of the disruptions economic slowdown to weigh on oil prices by paribas by henning gloystein singapore feb reuters oil prices hovered near highs on wednesday supported by supply cuts and sanctions on iran and venezuela but capped by soaring production and expectations of an economic slowdown
west texas intermediate wti crude oil futures were at per barrel at gmt down cents from their last settlement but not far off their high of reached earlier this week
international brent crude futures had yet to trade
they also hit a high of per barrel this week
prices have been driven up by supply cuts led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec
opec s and the world s biggest oil exporter saudi arabia is expected to reduce shipments of light crude oil to asia in march as part of the effort to tighten markets
opec as well as some producers such as russia agreed late last year to cut output by million barrels per day bpd to prevent a large supply overhang from swelling
we have lowered saudi crude oil output in line with announcements and are now assuming that saudi arabia will produce in the first three quarters of less than the million bpd target it agreed to at the december opec meeting french bank bnp paribas said in a note
because of the cuts bnp said it expected oil prices to rally through with brent to average per barrel by then and wti to average
another key oil price driver has been sanctions on oil exporters iran and venezuela
despite the sanctions iran s crude exports were higher than expected in january averaging around million bpd according to refinitiv ship tracking data
many analysts had expected iran oil exports to drop below million bpd after the imposition of sanctions last november
standing against the supply cuts and sanctions is crude output which soared by more than million bpd in to a record million bpd thanks to booming shale oil production which the energy information administration on tuesday said was expected to keep rising
bnp paribas said surging output would feed into lower oil prices towards the end of the year with brent to dip to an average of a barrel by the fourth quarter and wti to average

oil production growth driven by shale will be increasingly exported in greater volumes to international markets while the global economy is expected to witness a synchronised slowdown in growth the bank said
