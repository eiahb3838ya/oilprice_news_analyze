commonwealth lng finds european demand for gas from louisiana terminal -ceo
tokyo feb reuters commonwealth lng has received commitments from european buyers to take almost half of the liquefied natural gas lng from its planned export terminal in louisiana chief executive officer paul varello said on wednesday
the commonwealth project is one of more than lng export terminals under development or construction in the united states along the coast of the gulf of mexico to take advantage of soaring demand for the supercooled fuel amid booming gas production
we are exchanging documents with counterparties that will represent three to four million tonnes of capacity varello told reuters in an interview adding he expects to sign heads of agreements hoa shortly
we have to work hard to get closer to the full million tonnes in heads of agreements to allow us to feel good about getting million tonnes in final agreements he said because prospective buyers are overcommitting to projects
our bankers say that if we can decent pricing with million tonnes that will give us enough debt coverage to make it work varello said
the prospective buyers are european with their own importing terminals he said
varello said the company will process natural gas into lng at the terminal at well below per million british thermal units for buyers signing supply contracts
the company expects to make a final investment decision by the third or fourth quarter of next year after getting final environmental approvals and aims to begin shipping lng in
varello who is in tokyo pitching lng to importers in the country while attending an industry conference said japanese buyers were reluctant to sign agreements
the resistance to signing contracts is coming because electric utilities are getting nuclear reactors back online after prolonged shutdowns following the fukushima disaster and the rising use of renewables varello said
the commonwealth project is one of many that could be approved this year and next as worldwide consumption of lng is expected to more than double to million tonnes a year by
gas production has soared to new records bolstered by shale production increasing the need for export capacity to absorb the supply
energy companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than million tonnes per year of lng capacity this year a record
qatar petroleum and exxon mobil corp said earlier this month they will proceed with a billion project that will expand a lng export plant in texas
