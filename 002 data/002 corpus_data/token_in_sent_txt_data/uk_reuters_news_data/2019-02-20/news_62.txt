the electoral commission announced a week s delay to voting in the early hours of saturday citing logistical problems even as some of nigeria s million registered voters were already making their way to polling stations
the vote pitches president muhammadu buhari against former vice president atiku abubakar in what is seen as a tight race

its bonds got ejected from key indexes

nigeria s debt in particular has seen a sharper acceleration of inflows since the start of the year than emerging market debt more widely
nigeria s debt may have got kicked out of key indexes but its stocks escaped a similar fate

broader frontier and emerging equities have performed better however

this is a deeply unloved market whether measured by overall market volumes foreign participation valuation relative to history or performance versus frontier or peers said hasnain malik at exotix capital
that level of despair usually means with the international monetary fund estimating nigeria s ratio at just under percent in its outlook the country compares favourably to the average of percent
nigeria s debt has long been a favourite play
the issues have outperformed both wider emerging market sovereign debt and african peers returning some percent
eurobond valuations still look attractive as yields are likely to remain anchored regardless of outcome and the election means we are unlikely to get issuance until said diana amoa emerging market debt portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management
investors are split on local debt markets
on markets the arbitrage between high yields and stable hedging costs through currency forwards delivers solid returns for anything up to a year
the picture is less clear further out
we continue to like the trade as it s an attractive carry play on oil said kevin daly investment director at aberdeen standard investments in london
others say the trade has become too crowded
and plans by presidential contender abubakar to possibly float the naira currency makes it a risky play
