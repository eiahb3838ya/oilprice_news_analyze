preview-senegal's modernising president leads field in upcoming election
repeats story issued on tuesday no change to text projects boost image of macky sall as he seeks critics concerned by president s authoritarian stance weakened opposition not expected to put up a fight by sofia christensen dakar feb reuters president macky sall is the strong favourite to win senegal s election on sunday boosted by a modernising first term that propelled economic growth although critics accuse him of jailing his rivals for political gain
sall is facing only four contenders in the first round of voting the smallest presidential field since after two of senegal s opposition figures were ruled out because of corruption convictions
rights groups say this represents a crackdown on dissent in a country long seen as west africa s most stable democracy which has seen peaceful transitions of power via the ballot box since independence from france in
but many voters and foreign backers applaud sall for boosting economic growth to over six percent one of the highest rates in africa last year
the growth was driven in part by a series of infrastructure projects including a new airport km miles of motorways a wrestling stadium and an express train that will connect the capital to a new city that has begun to rise from the outside dakar
billboards of sall in a suit dot dakar s main coastal road and tout his achievements as the builder of modern senegal
we are happy said fisherman diabel mbeguere pulling his wooden boat onto dakar s yoff beach after a day at sea
there are highways here now many things the president has electricity used to be a big problem he added
long power cuts that used to blight urban senegal are rarer under sall
thousands of villages have gained access to electricity for the first time too although more than half remain without power according to the international monetary fund
opinion polls are banned in the to elections but a widely cited survey conducted by a senegalese data company in november gave sall percent support
none of the other candidates had more than percent
his main challengers are former prime minister and runner idrissa seck and old political rookie ousmane sonko who is popular among senegalese youth
it is not yet clear how voting will be affected by the exclusion from the race of presidential hopefuls khalifa sall a popular of dakar who is no relation to macky and karim wade the son of former president abdoulaye wade
under senegalese law khalifa sall and karim wade are barred from running as they were jailed for graft and corruption in and respectively
the opposition says this was a strategy to boost the president s chances of winning a charge the ruling party denies
sall and wade denied the charges
khalifa sall has urged his supporters to vote for seck with whom he forged an alliance from behind bars earlier this month
meanwhile karim wade s father abdoulaye says the vote is rigged and told supporters during a political meeting this month to take out the electoral roll and douse it with petrol
his comments have been criticised by other opposition candidates and civil society groups and election day is not expected to be disrupted by widespread protests
even so frustration with the incumbent is palpable among the educated youth who struggle to find jobs in an economy based on exports of fish phosphates and cement and where more than half the population works in agriculture
macky sall promised to create jobs for young people but this never happened said old romuald preira who recently completed a law degree at dakar s cheikh anta diop university
i can t even find a small job or an internship and i m not the only in response to a social media campaign a televised debate between candidates is scheduled to take place on thursday
the event is a first for senegal but sall has refused to take part
more than million people are registered to vote with polls opening on sunday at gmt and closing at six gmt
if no candidate secures a majority in the first round the top two will face each other in a second round on march
