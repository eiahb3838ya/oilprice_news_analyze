fisherman's friend: pre-election thumbs-up for senegal's president
dakar feb reuters senegalese fisherman diabel mbeguere credits the government s modernisation programme with helping to keep him in work so he ll be voting for incumbent macky sall in sunday s presidential election
mbeguere says the fish have got smaller and are swimming a lot futher out in the atlantic ocean than they were years ago
he blames climate change while others also cite increased competition for limited resources but thanks to sall s subsidy programme for an industry that accounts for around percent of senegal s labour force mbeguere s pirogue now has an engine that allows him to go further afield for his daily catch
for those of us who live off fishing we are satisfied he said
some of his fellow fishermen were still waiting to get their boats upgraded however
so we hope macky sall will get a second mandate so all the fishermen get what they need he said
