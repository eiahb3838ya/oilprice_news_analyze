this means that there will not be any felling of trees until the autumn of said armin laschet in the state parliament in duesseldorf
a commission said last month germany should shut down all of its power plants by at the latest
the hambach forest has become a symbol of the protest
laschet said preserving hambach would be subject to negotiations between rwe and the government over how to handle the national coal withdrawal plan
he added protesters squatting in the forest to signal their opposition to the mining of lignite also called brown coal and the burning of it in nearby power plants should go home
a spokesman for rwe confirmed the company had agreed to the moratorium but added the decision implies significant operational rwe chief executive rolf martin schmitz said last month that preserving the forest could cost tens of millions of euros given the space needed for mining waste
mining has come to a standstill in the area since a court order in october
