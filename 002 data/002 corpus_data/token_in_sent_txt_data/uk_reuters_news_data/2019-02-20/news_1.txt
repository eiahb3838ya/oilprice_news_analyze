corrects typos in paragraphs and agreement similar to framework deal acacia says has not seen deal yet sources say barrick and acacia to meet next week by john benny feb reuters canadian miner barrick gold outlined on wednesday details of a deal it reached with the government of tanzania to settle its disputes with acacia mining including a million payment to resolve tax claims in the country
the news sent shares in acacia which is percent owned by barrick up percent to their highest since october when an initial framework agreement was announced
barrick s announcement confirms the deal which called for the creation of a local firm in tanzania to manage acacia s assets a split of economic benefits and a million payment to resolve all outstanding tax claims in the east african country
acacia which was not allowed to negotiate for itself and tanzania s government have been locked in a prolonged conflict with the government tearing up mining contracts hiking taxes and royalties and banning exports of raw minerals
sources have said initial agreement had been difficult to reach due to differing views from the government and the two companies about how the million would be paid
while the original deal details have been known for over a year now we believe that the actual execution of the us million payout will remove a major overhang for barrick and acacia credit suisse analysts said in a note
this also marks a victory for barrick s new chief executive mark bristow who took the helm in january after the gold company merged with randgold resources
significant amounts of real value have been destroyed by this dispute and in barrick s view this proposal will allow the business to focus on rebuilding its mining operations in partnership with their respective stakeholders barrick s bristol said in a statement
separately acacia said it had not yet received barrick s proposal
barrick said the proposal would soon be presented to acacia s independent directors
a source at acacia said the company planned to meet barrick next week to get more details
the deal is expected to be implemented by the end of march the tanzanian government said in a statement
this announcement provides opportunity for bulyanhulu to be restarted and some value to be recreated within the company said investec analyst hunter hillcoat referring to a mine where acacia lowered operations due to the export ban
acacia s troubles in tanzania began after president john magufuli nicknamed the bulldozer swept to power in pledging to secure a bigger share of resource wealth and cut corruption
it was handed a billion tax bill about four times the country s gross domestic product for underreporting output
that was later revised down to million
