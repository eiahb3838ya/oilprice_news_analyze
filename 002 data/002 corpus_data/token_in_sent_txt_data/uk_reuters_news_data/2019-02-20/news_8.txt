update 4-south africa pledges $5 bln eskom bailout as budget creaks
budget forecasts slower growth wider deficits funds eskom by reprioritising spending borrowing more analysts say utility s underlying problems remain ramaphosa struggles with divided party before may vote adds moody s market reaction eskom chair more mboweni by olivia wendell roelf and mfuneko toyana cape town feb reuters south africa will bail out state utility eskom with billion rand billion over three years the centrepiece of a budget that exposed the limited room president cyril ramaphosa has to fix the economy ahead of an election in may
ramaphosa who is fighting rifts within his own party before the parliamentary election has made reforming eskom one of his top priorities as its billion rand debt pile poses a direct threat to africa s most developed economy
analysts said the financial support would give the ailing power firm several years to implement a restructuring plan which will see it split into separate entities for generation transmission and distribution
but it still leaves eskom which last week subjected south africa to the worst series of power cuts in several years facing an uncertain future with unsustainable debts crippling costs and stagnant sales
the money for eskom is insufficient given the length of time over which the eskom reorganisation will occur and the practical and political pitfalls that are ahead said peter attard montalto head of capital markets research at intellidex
those pitfalls include major job cuts an option that was unlikely to be implemented before the election amid fierce opposition from leftist sections of the ruling african national congress anc and powerful trade unions
the anc is expected to win the election but only a handsome victory would give ramaphosa the mandate to push through painful reforms that are opposed by those within the governing party still loyal to his predecessor jacob zuma
in his maiden budget speech finance minister tito mboweni told parliament the emergency funds for eskom would be financed through reprioritised spending and increased borrowing but he rejected eskom s request that the state take on billion rand of its debt

i want to make it clear the national government is not taking on eskom s he raised the possibility of selling off more than parastatals often cited as a risk to the public purse
isn t it about time the country asks the question do we still need these enterprises mboweni asked

we need to put more pressure on our operational he said the utility hoped the energy regulator would agree to the large tariff hikes eskom had requested when it announces a decision around
the regulator has in the past tended to approve smaller increases that eskom has asked for
some business leaders wanted more detail on how eskom s debt mountain would be reduced over the longer term
eskom received a billion rand bailout in via a loan which was later converted into equity
the government later sold state assets to give it another billion rand
we were hoping that the government was going to look at debt and take some of the burden off the utility but unfortunately that didn t materialise said tanya cohen chief executive of business unity south africa
eskom s turned off the lights across swathes of the country last week due to problems diesel shortages and planned maintenance
the outages exposed the risks to the economy from eskom s virtual monopoly and the failure of successive governments to take on labour unions and factions in the anc who consider any form of privatisation as a red line
