update 1-iran's oil customers in europe might reduce imports, flag financing issue
london reuters european oil companies are not ruling out reducing iranian oil imports after the threat of new sanctions with some expecting banking issues to hinder trade but there was no rush to immediately cut volumes
president donald trump said on tuesday the united states was exiting an international nuclear deal with iran and would impose new sanctions that seek to reduce oil exports from opec s producer
but as of friday companies in europe said they were still taking iranian oil
iran pumps about percent of the world s oil and exports about barrels per day bpd of crude to europe according to data
at this moment our trading activity is business as usual said marta llorente a spokeswoman for spanish oil company cepsa one of iran s customers in europe
we strictly conform with european union and international laws and regulations and scrupulously respect any trade restriction that could occur from any potential international sanctions or another european buyer italy s eni said it is buying million barrels a month of iranian crude as part of a contract running to adding any new sanctions would take six months to kick in
the sanctions have a period during which buyers should wind down oil purchases meaning any loss of supply will not be immediately felt and companies don t have to rush to find alternatives
but greece s biggest oil refiner hellenic which was the first european company to agree to buy crude oil from the national iranian oil company nioc after sanctions on iran were lifted in january rang a cautious note we are closely monitoring developments following the administration decision and will assess our position and commercial arrangements accordingly hellenic said
in any case we will make sure that we comply with the applicable international regulatory framework and given our crude supply flexibility and diversification we do not expect any significant effect on our the bulk of iran s crude exports about million bpd go to asia
a decline in volumes due to the sanctions will add to upward pressure on oil prices which have gained this year because of an supply cutting deal and strong global demand
crude has topped a barrel the highest since following trump s sanctions announcement
market participants said there were still many unanswered questions about how the united states might impact european companies
we re doing nothing said the head of trading at another european refiner
it s wait and see
if we re forced to reduce we will
iranian is not the only sources at global trading companies predicted an imminent drop in iranian exports due to banking issues such as availability of trade finance
a source at a trading company buying iranian oil said it hoped to keep buying at least during the wind down period before new sanctions take effect but expected banking issues to put a stop to trade
it looks like you can still go on for six months the source who declined to be identified said
the key is banks
if banks stop us we might a senior trader with another company said he expected banking to pose a major problem to iranian oil trade and a third said even if waivers are granted volumes would still decline
waivers seem a sensible course of action the third source said referring to potential exemptions from the latest sanctions
but you need to reduce your volume take over the grace period of days to be favourably treated in the waiver discussion
you can t just stay at current levels until then and get a additional reporting by angeliki koutantou bate felix and shadia nasralla writing and additional reporting by alex lawler editing by jane merriman and louise heavens
