refile-analysis-some u.s. fund managers finally convinced oil rally is for real
new york reuters fund managers are barrelling into the energy sector by making broad bets on anything connected with oil finally convinced that gains in crude prices on track for their fourth consecutive quarterly gain the longest such stretch for more than years are more than a mirage
ever since oil prices slid in late after rallying above a barrel mutual fund managers have largely stayed underweight the sector convinced that advances in fracking technology would allow production to ramp up at any moment and keep a lid on prices
yet with oil futures hitting highs on thursday up approximately percent from this time last year after top exporter saudi arabia and producer russia led efforts since to cap output some fund managers are convinced that high oil prices are finally here to stay
fund managers from westwood hotchkiss and wiley and hodges capital are among those who say they are making broad bets on anything oil
they say that oil prices will not dip back down quickly because global demand is rising at a time when energy companies are showing less inclination to take on debt to fuel production and have tightened operations
oil companies are so much more efficient then they were even a year ago and much more disciplined
i think that you can finally say that this is the real deal said gary bradshaw a portfolio manager at hodges capital
at the same time president donald trump s decision to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal on tuesday raises geopolitical risks giving oil another leg higher fund managers said
crude hit per barrel on thursday its highest since november
a reuters poll at the end of april forecast that oil would average in
bradshaw expects crude oil prices to stay at roughly between and for the remainder of the year boosting the earnings of companies such as schlumberger nv and diamondback energy inc
still bradshaw does not see them spiking high enough to significantly cut into consumer spending or the broader economy although they may crimp the spending power for the most customers he said which could eat into the revenues of value chains like dollar general corp
the dramatic comeback in oil prices which have jumped nearly percent for the year to date has helped the s p energy sector jump percent over the same time
the broad s p as a whole by comparison is up less than percent since the start of the year
that in turn is prodding fund managers back into the sector they had largely shunned
nine months ago global funds were underweight energy stocks by percent on average the largest collective underweight since according to a september report by bank of america merrill lynch
in april by comparison equity allocations to commodities and energy stocks hit highs bank of america merrill lynch noted
we ve already had some of the trade but we still have a long way to go said bill costello a senior portfolio manager at westwood who has been adding to his positions in energy companies such as callon petroleum co and src energy inc while energy stocks have rallied shares are still trading at levels that suggest that oil will remain between and a barrel for the remainder of the year costello said
if people believed in a barrel plus for the next months they would be foolish to be underweight now costello said adding that he expects more money to flow into the sector as fund managers sell utilities and telecom stocks that are getting hurt by rising interest rates
the stretched valuations of the s p which is about percent below the record high it hit in january should provide another support for energy stocks said stan majcher of the hotchkis wiley mid cap value fund
we look at it and say the overall market is close to expensive and this is one area which is and viewed in the last few years as a risky place he said
signs of declining production by opec countries such as venezuela and bottlenecks that could slow production in the permian basin in the could push oil prices well above by the end of the year leaving fund managers flatfooted majcher said
we think that the biggest risk is not preparing for higher oil prices he said
