exclusive-n.korean traders offering cheap coal on hopes sanctions will ease - chinese traders
beijing reuters some north korean traders are offering cheap coal to chinese buyers who are stockpiling it at ports inside the isolated country hoping recent diplomatic moves lead to an easing of sanctions barring purchases of north korean coal three chinese traders told reuters
official data shows china has not imported any coal from north korea since october last year after the united nations banned pyongyang from exporting coal in september
in china pyongyang s main trading partner bought million tonnes of coal from north korea worth almost billion
but the chinese traders said offers of coal had surged after north korean leader kim jong un made a surprise visit to beijing in march and ahead of a planned meeting with president donald trump
the day kim jong un visited beijing i was approached by a north korean trader asking if i wanted inventory at nampo port one coal trader based in northern china told reuters referring to north korea s main west coast port
the north korean trader had a couple thousand tonnes of anthracite coal which he was willing to sell at around per tonne the trader said less than a quarter of the price of similar chinese coal
the two other chinese traders confirmed that price range
all three requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation
prices were even lower during the lunar new year period in february hovering at less than per tonne said another of the traders who is based in northeastern china
the chinese traders reuters spoke to said they had not personally purchased north korean coal but all said they were aware of stockpiling in the hope of sanctions being eased
over the past few weeks more and more people have been stockpiling coal one trader told reuters
north korean coal producers and coal trading houses are allowed to decide prices and volumes for export even though they are owned by the state and don t operate in a fully liberalised market one trader said
the north korean trading houses also pay hefty export taxes a major source of income for the regime
if un sanctions were lifted the coal could be sold on to steel mills in china
anthracite produced in china s shanxi province currently sells at around yuan per tonne data provided by china sublime information group shows
the price is exceptionally good but i decided not to buy because i am worried the cargo will be seized back by the north korean government one trader said
buyers had to pay in full instead of the to percent deposit required before sanctions were imposed he said
chinese traders who accepted the terms were required by the north korean sellers to send money to accounts in banks held by chinese agents who were in contact with north korean firms the trader added
he said he could not track if and how the money left china and reuters was unable to verify any transfers between the two countries
catherine dill a senior research associate at the james martin centre for nonproliferation studies said any completed deals were likely to violate un sanctions which cover a wide range of north korean exports and are aimed at cutting off up to percent of its foreign exchange earnings
although the coal is still in north korea the phrasing of the un resolution that north korea can not supply sell or transfer its coal to other countries suggests the intent of the resolution is to prohibit any transaction that would financially benefit north korea dill said
independent experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions believe north korea earned nearly million in from banned commodity exports including coal
the united nations and china s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment
calls to the north korean embassy in beijing went unanswered
the united states has repeatedly said it will not relax sanctions on north korea until it denuclearises
the white house said trump and chinese president xi jinping had agreed on the importance of continued implementation of sanctions on north korea until it permanently dismantles its nuclear and missile programmes during a phone conversation this week
the three sources said they expect north korean coal prices to rise significantly if the un ban is lifted
traders were expecting chinese customs to allow in new cargoes from north korea as early as this month said zhang min a senior coal analyst with china sublime information group
the chinese trader based in northeastern china said he was heading to north korea this week to meet his contacts
the situation with north korea is improving so i want to touch base with my business partners as soon as chinese yuan renminbi reporting by wong and beijing newsroom
