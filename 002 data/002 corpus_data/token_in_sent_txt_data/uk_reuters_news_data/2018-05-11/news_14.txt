update 1-trading in portugal's edp suspended after reports of likely chinese bid
lisbon reuters trading in the shares of utility company de portugal was suspended on friday as media reported that a chinese group was set to make a takeover bid for the firm
a spokeswoman for portugal s market regulator cmvm said the shares were suspended pending an announcement about the company but would not provide more details or comment on media reports
the online edition of the expresso newspaper said earlier that a chinese consortium that includes edp s largest shareholder china three gorges ctg was preparing a takeover bid for portugal s leading company by assets
the financial times later quoted its sources as saying ctg was set to launch an offer for edp
expresso said the portuguese government was unlikely to create obstacles to the potential takeover but edp would probably consider the offer hostile
edp had no immediate comment
the company has a stock market capitalization of around billion euros billion
china three gorges holds a percent stake and chinese state company cnic holds nearly percent meaning that the chinese state owns just over percent in edp
a compulsory takeover offer is required if the stake exceeds percent
the suspension of edp shares which also encompassed edp s wind power unit edpr was announced after the market close on friday
edp shares had closed percent higher at euros
reports and rumors about edp being an acquisition target of foreign companies have been circulating for months
last month following a news report that french utility engie was examining a possible bid edp denied the existence of any contact with engie
there were reports last year that spain s gas natural was seeking a merger with edp but the company denied there were any talks at the time
china three gorges has continued to raise its stake in edp since reports of gas natural s interest
