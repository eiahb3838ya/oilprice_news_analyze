india's modi to launch work on nepal's biggest power plant
kathmandu may reuters indian prime minister narendra modi will on friday initiate work on nepal s biggest hydroelectric project being built by an indian company as he seeks to regain ground in the himalayan republic where china has made deep inroads
india has an open border with nepal and tens of thousands of nepalis work in india
the neigbours share close religious and cultural bonds
but india has been slow to implement projects despite ambitious plans and it has also often been a target of nepali politicians critical of what they see as meddling by their overweening much bigger neighbour
china on the other hand is pouring aid and investment into hospitals roads and hydroelectric plants
modi who began a visit to nepal on friday will with his counterpart oli lay a foundation of the mw project through remote control from kathmandu
as nepal enters a new era of consolidating the gains of a democracy and achieving economic growth india remains a steadfast partner modi said on twitter before seeing out on his visit
the hydro project which is expected to cost billion and is being built by indian firm satluj jal vidyut nigam sjvn limited will be the single biggest foreign investment project in nepal
project officials say they are in final stages of agreement with the state bank of india for investment of about billion indian rupees million with the rest coming from equity investment by sjvn
the project is moving forwards just as a chinese proposal to build a mw power plant in west nepal has run into a roadblock
china s three gorges international corp is haggling for better terms nepali officials said
modi is visiting for the first time since protests for a greater say in government by ethnic madhesis in nepal s lowland south led to the closure of the border for months in and
the blockade chocked off nepal s imports of fuel medicine and construction material just as it was struggling to recover from the worst earthquake on record in which people were killed
many in nepal saw india s hand in the protests although india denied that
guna raj luintel editor of the nagarik daily said there was lingering anger towards india over the blockade
modi is under pressure to bring the nepal ties back to normal and win the confidence of the nepali people luintel told reuters
after arriving in nepal modi offered prayers at a hindu temple in the border town of janakpur which was a hub of the madhesi protests in which more than people were killed
