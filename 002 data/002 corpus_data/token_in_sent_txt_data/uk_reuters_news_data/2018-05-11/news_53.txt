update 1-china's jiangsu province may shut some coke plants in smog fight -source
beijing reuters china s jiangsu province is considering shutting small coke plants along the yangtze river and near lake tai as the eastern province steps up its campaign against pollution an official at the provincial government familiar with the matter said
the move is part of a broader proposal being considered by the provincial government said the official who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media
jiangsu province is china s steel producing region and its output of coke used to smelt iron ore in blast furnaces accounts for percent of the country s total on average
local officials in the eastern province have become more aggressive in tackling pollution with a flurry of chemical plant and steel mill closures in recent weeks
coke futures prices jumped more than percent on friday to yuan per tonne as investors bet that the proposal will reduce coke supplies two traders said
the latest proposal is likely to increase costs for steel mills
bringing in coke from elsewhere could also add to pressure on the country s rail system after china cracked down on diesel trucks carrying bulk commodities in many regions
it is not known when the authorities will make a final decision the official said
the jiangsu state planner did not respond to a request for comment
