hawaii residents shaken by quakes, brace for new lava outbreaks
pahoa hawaii may reuters more than a week after the eruption of the kilauea volcano hawaii residents felt tremors and earthquakes on friday as molten rock flowed underground towards a rural area where more lava was expected to burst to the surface and threaten homes
fifteen large cracks or fissures have so far opened on the eastern flank of kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes destroying dozens of houses and forcing thousands from their homes on hawaii s big island
fissure activity has paused but new lava outbreaks were expected in or around the leilani estates area in the southeast puna district about miles km south of hilo the hawaii volcano observatory and local authorities said
steaming ground cracks from volcanic activity the first signs a fissure may open closed roads in areas to the northeast and southwest of leilani estates where scientists believe the next lava vents may appear
i ve been feeling earthquakes
lots and lots of tremors said cindy conda whose house lies just east of leilani estates where homes have been torched by lava in the last eight days
conda said that at a meeting thursday night hawaiian volcano observatory scientist steve brantley told residents that lava that has lain dormant in the area since a eruption was being forced to the surface by kilauea s activity
he said that lava s underneath your house said conda
really it s worrying we ve been doing a lot of praying
there is not much else you can the first explosive eruptions on kilauea in nearly a century may soon begin dusting downwind communities with ash that is an eye and respiratory irritant observatory scientists said
the national park around the summit was closed to visitors on thursday given the risk that the eruptions could launch ballistic blocks over half a mile and hurl projectiles for miles
residents of kona on the west coast of the island have complained of volcanic smog or vog from the large amounts of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from kilauea
hawaii s governor warned that mass evacuations may be required in the lower puna district as more fissures open
kilauea s eruption began last week after the crater floor of a side vent collapsed in a cloud of ash triggering a plunge in the lava lake inside the larger summit crater
