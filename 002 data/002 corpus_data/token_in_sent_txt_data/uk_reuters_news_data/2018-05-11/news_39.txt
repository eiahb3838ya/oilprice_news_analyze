interview-chinese, mideast, russian firms in talks to build refinery in sri lanka
four investors in discussion for up to bln refinery sri lanka needs to upgade from bpd refinery china india also in discussion on other refinery proposals by shihar aneez colombo may reuters chinese middle east and russian companies are in preliminary discussions to build an up to billion bpd refinery for sri lanka s ceylon petroleum corporation cpc the head of the fuel retailer said on friday
sri lanka has a single bpd oil refinery in colombo suburb sapugaskanda built originally to refine iranian light crude
however when toughened sanctions were imposed on tehran in to curb its nuclear ambitions cpc was forced to look for other light crudes
cpc chairman dammika ranatunga said the fuel retailer is looking for a partner to build a bpd refinery on a bot basis
it is going to cost anything between billion and billion ranatunga told reuters in an interview
a chinese firm two middle eastern companies and a russian company have all expressed interest to invest in the new refinery
ranatunga declined to name the potential investors but said the discussions are in a preliminary stage
ranatunga said a bpd refinery could knock million a year off of sri lanka s import bill for refined fuels
the country spent billion on fuel imports in
investors would have the option of building a refinery with a capacity greater than bpd and exporting any excess refined fuels he said
sri lanka had earlier planned to upgrade its sole refinery which accounts for percent of the country s fuel requirement and double its capacity to boost output and reduce the cost of importing refined fuels
upgrading the refinery may not be the solution
it is important for us to refine all types of crude that is the way we can get crude at a competitive price ranatunga
russia s energy ministry said in march its officials have discussed an oil refinery project in sri lanka
two chinese companies have jointly bid for a separate bpd refinery with an annual output of around million tonnes a year or bpd in the southern town of hambantota near an important shipping route where china controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone
sri lanka is still in discussion on the hambantota refinery although the government has blocked a proposal by the chinese companies bidding on the refinery there to sell fuel locally
sri lanka has also discussed another bpd refinery in partnership with indian oil corp but there has been on progress on that plan
