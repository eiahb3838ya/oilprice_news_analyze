insight-plastics mines? europe struggles as pollution piles up
oslo reuters europe has sent just over half the plastic waste it used to ship to china to other parts of asia since beijing s environmental crackdown closed the world s biggest recycling market in january
the knotty problem is what to do with the rest
some of the surplus is piled up in places from building sites to ports officials say waiting for new markets to open up
recycling closer to home is held back by the fact that the plastic is often dirty and unsorted the same reasons china turned it away
countries led by malaysia and vietnam and india imported far more of europe s plastic waste in early than before european union data show but unless they or others take more the only options will be to either bury or burn it
in an overcrowded continent where landfills are much more restricted than elsewhere burning is the obvious option to help generate electricity or heat from hundreds of thousands of tonnes of surplus waste
but more radical ideas such as putting oil derived plastic back underground to mine back when recycling becomes more sophisticated are being aired as europe tries to work out what to do
european waste policies need to become much more nuanced because some landfill might actually be quite good professor ian boyd chief scientific adviser for the british government s department of environment food and rural affairs told reuters
i m putting out a challenge to the current system he said referring to the fact that waste policies in europe either ban or limit landfill but do little to restrict what has been dubbed skyfill the release of pollutants into the air
europe has favoured the construction of power plants that burn waste for electricity or heat because land is scarce and landfills produce toxins and greenhouse gases such as methane as organic waste from food to nappies rots
plants produce greenhouse gas emissions too but in most of europe they are exempt from carbon taxes that stand at about euros a tonne in an industrial market
boyd said buried plastic could become a valuable resource only if the penalties for emitting greenhouse gases both in making plastics and burning them were far higher than today
globally plastics accounted for million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in ranging from production to incineration and equivalent to the emissions by a nation such as turkey according to the ellen macarthur foundation a that specialises in recycling
the plastics industry takes issue with such assessments saying they ignore the vast contribution of plastic in reducing other emissions by for example preserving food and reducing the weight of transport
the confederation of european plants cewep a group of some plants using million tonnes of municipal waste to provide heat and electricity for millions of people said burying and then mining back plastic was a fantasy
digging waste into landfills and then waiting until a magic technology pops up in the future is not a responsible option cewep managing director ellen stengler said adding that the idea was a minority view she heard here and there in europe
just cleaning plastic waste before burial would be hugely expensive plastic would degrade underground and there would be risks such as fire she said
the latest major assessment of climate change in also floated the idea that cities might sort and bury waste such as metals paper and plastics to create a material reservoir that can be mined sometime in future
plastic pollution is surging and could according to un environment exceed the weight of fish in the oceans by
china which used to process half the world s exports of plastic waste has insisted on higher standards of cleanliness and sorting to prevent waste that can not be recycled being burnt which in its case often means in open pits
for europe the restrictions have so far acted as an effective ban according to official data reviewed by reuters which showed exports to china crashing by percent in the first two months of the year
for graphic click nations led by malaysia vietnam turkey india and indonesia took on around percent of the waste but the surplus means europe s market for waste has collapsed
a tonne of plastic waste for export with up to percent impurities such as paper labels could be sold for between and pounds a tonne in april according to british recycling group
last month by contrast you had to pay between and pounds to get someone to take it away
despite this patawari borad of the bureau of international recycling in brussels said recycling within europe had not increased dramatically
one can only guess that this unsorted material is going for either energy or body cewep said it saw no sign extra plastic was being burnt
incinerators would notice a higher share of plastics stengler said because tonne for tonne they produce a lot of energy
proponents of the idea of burying plastic include keith freegard a director of axion polymers in england one of europe s leading recyclers of waste from cars and electronics
all those tonnes of waste material that were going into the landfill are now being released into the sky
why are we allowing this free access to skyfill said freegard who is vice chair of the british plastic federation s recycling group
we should separate and store plastic in a landfill as a future mine he told reuters
to produce a megawatt hour of electricity he said a plant would need to burn kg of plastic emitting kg of carbon dioxide
by contrast a power plant would generate the same amount of energy by burning kg of natural gas emitting just kg of carbon dioxide
stengler and nations that favour plants say such accounting is misleading and that helps replace fossil fuels a key goal of the paris climate agreement to limit heat waves floods droughts and rising seas
swedish government estimates for instance show that three tonnes of municipal waste contain as much energy as a tonne of oil
world production of plastics has increased about twentyfold since the and is expected to double again over the next years according to the european commission
erik solheim head of
environment in nairobi said the global focus for plastic policies should be to cut use especially products such as microplastics used in some cosmetics or drinking straws that he said were unnecessary
the best of all is to avoid the plastics we don t need he said
burying waste and mining it sounds a difficult option
of million tonnes of plastic waste collected in europe in percent went to energy generation percent to recycling including in china and percent to landfills according to plastics europe
it was the first time that recycling rates exceeded landfills it said
by contrast in the more spacious united states percent of million tonnes of collected plastics was landfilled in according to the environmental protection agency
fifteen percent was burnt and percent recycled it said
and worldwide a report by scientists in estimated that only about percent of municipal solid waste is recycled about percent used to generate energy and the rest dumped
