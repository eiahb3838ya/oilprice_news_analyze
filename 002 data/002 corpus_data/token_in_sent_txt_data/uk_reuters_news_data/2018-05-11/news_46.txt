china's cnpc ready to take over iran project if total leaves - sources
cnpc has put thorough contingency plans in place cnpc has acquired some expertise operating offshore banking unit kunlun could be funding clearing vehicle by chen aizhu beijing may reuters china s energy major cnpc is ready to take over total s stake in the giant iranian south pars gas project if the french company leaves amid newly announced sanctions industry sources said
the united states this week said it would impose new sanctions against major oil and gas producer iran after abandoning an agreement reached in late that limited tehran s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief
while the new sanctions are unilateral many companies including japan s inpex already appear to be bowing to washington s pressure and abandoning projects in iran
if total walks away from the south pars field which has the world s biggest natural gas reserves ever found in one place cnpc is prepared to step in the sources said
it was not clear whether cnpc had received top government approval to do so
but such a move could further strain the tense trade relationship between beijing and washington
reuters reported in december that a billion deal signed last july gave the chinese firm the option to take over total s stake if it left iran
since then the giant has conducted significant due diligence and planning several industry sources told reuters
the possibility of total s pullout is quite high now and in that scenario cnpc will be ready to take it over fully said a senior state oil official with knowledge of the contract
an executive with direct knowledge of the project added that planning began the day the investment was cnpc foresaw a high probability of a reimposition of sanctions the executive said
all the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media
under the terms of the agreement to develop phase of south pars cnpc could take over total s percent stake and become operator of the project
cnpc already holds a percent stake in the field while iranian national oil company subsidiary petropars holds the remaining percent
so far the chinese oil giant which already operates two oil fields in iran has spent about million on planning to develop the field the sources said
despite cnpc s preparations the two sources said they were not aware of any meetings between total and cnpc after trump s move
cnpc and total declined to comment
a source close to total said the french company was analysing the impact of new sanctions and whether it could get a waiver that would allow it to keep its stake
an experienced onshore oil and gas producer cnpc is relatively green in offshore drilling
most of its experience lies in its subsidiary china petroleum offshore engineering company cpoe which has worked in shallow waters off north china
the south pars gas reservoirs are buried beneath the seafloor metres underwater
the project will have a production capacity of billion cubic feet per day or barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate total has said
at current market prices the whole reserves of the field which iran shares with qatar would be worth around trillion
the field is set to start supplying the iranian domestic market in
cnpc is prepared to use its banking unit bank of kunlun ltd as a funding and clearing vehicle if it takes over operation of south pars the second senior state oil official said
the bank was used to settle tens of billions of dollars worth of oil imports during the un sanctions against tehran between and the official added
most of the bank s settlements during that time were in euros and chinese renminbi
the treasury sanctioned kunlun in for conducting business with iran
if cnpc goes ahead it would also likely have to develop crucial equipment such as compressors needed for developing gas deposits on this scale on its own
leading manufacturers like firm ge and germany s siemens could be barred from supplying to iran under sanctions
