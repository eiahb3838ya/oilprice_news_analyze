update 6-u.s. targets iran-russia network over oil sent to syria
washington reuters the united states has moved to disrupt an network that it said had sent millions of barrels of oil to syria and hundreds of millions of dollars to indirectly fund militant groups hamas and hezbollah
the complicated arrangement described by the treasury in a statement on tuesday involved a syrian citizen allegedly using his company to ship iranian oil to syria with the aid of a russian company
syria then helped transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in cash to hezbollah which functions as a political party that is part of the lebanese government and as a militia as well as to hamas the palestinian group that rules the gaza strip
the treasury department alleged that since vessels carrying iranian oil have switched off transponders to conceal deliveries to syria
the treasury the state department and the coast guard have issued an advisory to the maritime community about the sanctions risks of shipping oil to syria s government
russia will continue supplying oil to syria in line with its agreement with damascus despite pressure from the united states ria news agency quoted oleg morozov a member of the russian federation council as saying late on tuesday
the political defeat in syria apparently prompts the united states to return to the idea of regime change in damascus
therefore economic pressure through oil supply shutdown becomes a tool of the new economic war with syrian president bashar and indirectly with moscow and iran he said
morozov said russia acts and will act absolutely legally
we have an agreement with syria and therefore it s up to us to decide what we supply and to whom
this will be our answer it is much more effective than he added
the russian energy ministry declined immediate comment
an iranian foreign ministry spokesman called the sanctions fruitless illogical and inefficient
bahram qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency irna on wednesday those who designed and implemented these sanctions will understand sooner or later that they will not achieve their the alleged arrangement shows how russia has sought to undercut policy toward syria where washington and moscow back opposite sides of a civil war that began in as well as toward iran which the united states wants to curb its nuclear and missile programs and support for militant proxies
today we are acting against a complex scheme iran and russia have used to bolster the assad regime and generate funds for iranian malign activity treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement announcing sanctions on those it said were tied to the network
central bank of iran officials continue to exploit the international financial system he added
richard nephew a sanctions expert at columbia university said the arrangement exposes russia s efforts to support assad for their own interests which has the function of thwarting the desire to no longer have assad in those targeted include syrian mohammad amer alchwiki and his company global vision group which were central to the delivery of iranian oil to syria and the transfer of funds to the islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force s lethal proxies the treasury department said in a statement
other targets include syrian national hajji abd lebanese national muhammad qasim and russian national andrey dogaev as well as iranian nationals rasoul sajjad and hossein yaghoubi miab the statement said
sajjad and yaghoubi central bank of iran officials worked to facilitate alchwiki s transfers it said
others sanctioned include russian company promsyrioimport a subsidiary of the russian energy ministry which the treasury alleges had facilitated shipments of iranian oil to syria as well as mir business bank and tadbir kish medical and pharmaceutical company
the treasury s designation of the individuals and entities effectively cuts them off from the global financial system by blocking any of their assets under jurisdiction and in effect warning institutions against dealing with them
the united states is at odds with britain france and germany as well as with russia and china over president donald trump s may decision to abandon the iran nuclear deal negotiated with the other world powers during democratic president barack obama s administration
that agreement removed many and other economic sanctions from iran in return for tehran s commitment to curtail its nuclear program
trump restored sanctions on and has threatened more action to stop its outlaw policies
iran in turn called trump s actions economic warfare and vowed to defy the sanctions
european powers that continue to back the nuclear deal said they opposed the reapplication of sanctions
