feature-girl power! india's 'solar gal pals' light up rural homes
alwar india nov thomson reuters foundation buffalo trampled over it
rain drenched it
child dropped it
no problem
this solar flashlight can endure it all said bassi in a pitch to her neighbours in rural india to convince them to power their homes with clean energy instead of polluting fuels
bassi is one of solar sahelis or solar women friends who fan out to different villages and persuade families to use solar energy in the western desert state of rajasthan which sees about days of sunshine every year
with unreliable electricity and power cuts every day many rural families in rajasthan are often forced to rely on candles kerosene oil lanterns or burning wood which emit soot and noxious fumes
they not only can lead to premature death due to disease but can also cause fire accidents and burn injuries
that is why solar is the way to go bassi who goes by one name told the thomson reuters foundation in her village of moonpur about km miles from state capital jaipur where buffalos and cows wander the dusty streets
they just makes more sense affordable durable and safe said bassi who has sold up to solar flashlights since becoming a solar saheli last year
even then bassi said it can be a challenge to win over villagers who are usually wary of the initial higher costs and distrust solar products due to experience with some flimsy products from china
the most popular product the solar rakshak or solar protector flashlight costs between and while a regular one would be about
but once doubts are cleared almost every customer is satisfied said bassi
kamlesh devi a mother of two bought the solar rakshak in june after bassi assured her that it would save her frequent trips to the market for new batteries and lights and help her children study without any irritation to their eyes
i used to buy flashlights for rupees about that would malfunction within six months
sometimes it would fall here or there
the batteries would die quickly
but this is a great thing said devi her head veiled with her sari
the kids are studying well
until at night even if there is no electricity they study very comfortably she said
frontier markets the social enterprise behind the project said its mission is to provide over million clean energy products to million households in india by
but the project is not just about going green
it also aims to empower women in the conservative state where child marriage is rife and girls are routinely denied an education and live a life largely confined to home
bassi s life was headed there too
forced to marry at she was regularly beaten up by her husband before she ran away and moved back in with her parents
when she insisted on studying further her elders refused saying she brought shame to the family
that is when frontier markets found bassi in a group for women and trained her to spread awareness and sell solar lights in remote areas of rajasthan
if not for this
i would have just stayed at home tended the buffalos and done household work
that is all i would have been good for said bassi
having never ventured out much or spoken in public before bassi said she was jittery at first unsure whether she would be taken seriously or be able to sell anything
but now i feel like i have no fear said bassi who unlike most rural women travels miles out of her village interacts with men and earns an income up to rupees every month
women are not weaker than men
at least i do not have to depend on anybody for money she said
on days when i feel like buying something or wearing something new then i know i have my own money and i can do whatever i the solar sahelis have collectively earned more than million by lighting over homes according to frontier markets
in order to drive true women empowerment they need to be economically secure
the second you put money into women s hands everything changes said ajaita shah the founder of frontier markets
the rise in family incomes has made the sahelis confident and more involved in household decisions she said
the fire we saw in some of these women it is like they were finally recognising that their voice has value said shah
repeated studies show that when women control the family s finances they invest more in their children s education healthcare businesses and communities which can be a step out of poverty
while such programmes seek to boost women s rights experts warn they can backfire at times as they upset traditional norms and spark conflict especially in conservative pockets of india
rajasthan is known as much for its beautiful palaces desert safaris and colourful apparel as for its customs like purdah or veiling of women
it is home to some of india s poorest villages where politically powerful councils mostly comprising elderly men have an iron grip over social and moral life
women are often expected to conform to established gender roles such as being the main caregivers who look after the home and children despite modern urbanising times experts say
that is why it is essential to sensitise villagers about changing dynamics said shashank bibhu of care india a charity that works for women from poor marginalised communities
otherwise in the past we have seen that it has led to domestic violence he said
he urged organisations to counsel communities about gender equality and promote supportive men as role models who share household responsibilities
for radha devi working as a solar saheli has not been very easy due to the lack of help from the men in her family
i struggle to balance household work and this work said the who became a saheli last year
men do not have to worry about household work so they progress in life
but women have to think a lot about how they will take out time for their jobs she said
still that does not dim her hopes of making it big one day
the plan is to open up my own store and make a name for myself she said wearing a bright yellow solar sahelis vest
success takes time
one should not lose confidence
