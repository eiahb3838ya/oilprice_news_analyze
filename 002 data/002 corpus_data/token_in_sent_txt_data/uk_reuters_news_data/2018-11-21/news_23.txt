momentum stocks have come off in a fairly spectacular fashion

that s come off the boil and set the cat among the pigeons we ve seen a lot of reflexivity when selling begets selling the market starts to turn over people take profits it leads to another leg down and so markets also appear to be preparing for a loss of momentum in global economic growth as china takes a hit from washington s trade tariffs and the united states comes off the of president donald trump s tax cuts
vickers said that after earnings growth at companies some investors were disappointed with signs this would slow to single digits as the stimulus effect wore off
if you have a market like the s which is two standard deviations expensive it becomes difficult if you don t think you will get the same kinds of earnings growth in future he added
growth worries have also been revived by comments from federal reserve officials who suggested economic outlook concerns could slow the pace of its monetary policy tightening cycle or even end it

we have to keep an eye on these dynamics but factors related to economic momentum in the euro zone and the fed interest rate outlook are far more important for the euro he added
