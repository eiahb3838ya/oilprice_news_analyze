tanzania asks bank to finance hydropower project in heritage site
dar es salaam reuters tanzania has approached the african development bank afdb to finance a mw hydroelectric plant in a world heritage site renowned for its animal population despite concerns from conservationists
the east african nation considers the project at stiegler s gorge in the selous game reserve to be vital in its bid to diversify its energy mix and end chronic electricity shortages
the project would more than double the country s power generation capacity
but critics say securing financing for it could prove difficult because construction of a dam on a major river that runs through the selous game reserve could affect wildlife and their habitats downstream
tanzania s finance ministry said in a statement on saturday that president john magufuli who is personally pushing the project made the financing request to afdb president akinwumi adesina during talks in tanzania s administrative capital dodoma over the weekend
the afdb confirmed that it was reviewing magufuli s request but did not say how much the project would cost
president magufuli is very committed to ensure that the country industrializes but you can not industrialize unless you have access to electricity adesina told journalists on saturday after his talks with the president
the president is very keen to talk to us about the stiegler s gorge project he mentioned that to us and we are going to be looking at that with him and the government but we are also very keen to look at other alternative sources of adesina said the afdb plans to work with the tanzanian government to develop integrated power projects with the private sector
tanzania s finance and planning minister philip mpango said on saturday that east africa s economy was also seeking a million loan from the afdb to build a new airport in dodoma and additional financing for the construction of roads
the government invited bids in august for the stiegler s gorge project and hopes construction work will begin as early as july
covering sq km the selous game reserve is one of the largest protected areas in africa according to unesco
it is known for its elephants black rhinos and giraffes among many other species
