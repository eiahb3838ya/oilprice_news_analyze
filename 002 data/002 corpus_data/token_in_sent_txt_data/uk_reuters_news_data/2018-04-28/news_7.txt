south korea says scrambles jets to intercept chinese reconnaissance flight
seoul reuters south korea said on saturday it had scrambled military jets to intercept a chinese aircraft that had entered the south s air defence territory less that two months after seoul officially lodged a complaint over another incursion
the chinese aircraft was believed to be a military reconnaissance plane and spent nearly four hours in the korea air defence identification zone the south korean joint chiefs of staff said in a statement
it would be at least the third such incident this year
south korea summoned the chinese ambassador in february to formally complain
china s defence ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on saturday the start of a long holiday weekend
the foreign ministry in beijing said in february the flights were completely in line with international law and practice and that air defence identification zones are not territorial air space
china s air force is increasingly active far from the country s shores including flying missions into the western pacific that often pass through a southern japanese island chain and around taiwan claimed by beijing as its own
china generally says that it has no hostile intent
however the government has said drills near taiwan are aimed at sending the democratic island the message that there will be consequences if it tries to push for formal independence
