update 9-brent crude settles flat, u.s. oil up on short covering
new york reuters oil markets were mixed on thursday with brent flat even though the dollar slid while crude rose as investors covered short positions
this is kind of an thursday said dominick chirichella at the energy management institute in new york
he said he was puzzled at why a weaker dollar did not boost brent futures prices
the rise we ve seen in crude has been more of a short covering rally rather than a return to the uptrend he added
global benchmark brent slipped cents to settle at a barrel
west texas intermediate crude gained cents or percent to settle at
those price moves cut the premium of brent over wti to its lowest in six months
if the spread narrows the big incentive to export crude oil starts to narrow chirichella said noting he did not expect prices to hold at these higher levels for long since all of the fundamental snapshots over the past couple of weeks have been the dollar slid to its lowest since it touched a low in late january
a weaker dollar often boosts prices for oil and other commodities making them cheaper for holders of other currencies
