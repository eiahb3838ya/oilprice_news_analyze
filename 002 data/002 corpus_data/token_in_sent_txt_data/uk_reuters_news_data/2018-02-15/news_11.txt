the stunt a day before the start of london fashion week saw the designer strut along the street wearing a black graphic dress emblazoned with the slogan fracking climate chaos
models and activists wore similar outfits
fracking is over
the people in this country are not going to accept it corre said at the event
the company was granted an injunction in by britain s high court preventing protesters from interfering with its operations
corre told crowd that activists were not frightened of the injunction
an ineos spokesman said that activists assertions that their legal action had made all protest unlawful in the uk was not the case
our injunctions prohibit unlawful acts by protesters and in no way impinge on the right to peaceful protest
these injunctions simply protect ineos and our people from hard core activists who game the system and treat the law with reporting by helena williams writing by mark hanrahan in london editing by andrew heavens
