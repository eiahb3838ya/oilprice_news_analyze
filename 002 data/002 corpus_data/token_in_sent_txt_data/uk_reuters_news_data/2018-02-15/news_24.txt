vw's german staff unconvinced of culture change -labour chief
berlin reuters volkswagen s drive to improve accountability has made zero progress in the view of a large number of its workers in germany the carmaker s top labor representative said
almost two thirds of staff see no improvement in volkswagen s vw corporate culture almost two and a half years after the diesel emissions fraud was revealed works council chief bernd osterloh said on thursday citing results of a labor survey of more than workers carried out in december at german plants
the attempt by europe s largest automaker to become more transparent and improve troubleshooting is seen by investors as a key part of vw s ability to regain trust and avoid any future scandals
there is also the potential for vw employee discontent with management to prompt labor leaders to adopt a tougher stance in dealings with top executives
culture change for us remains a permanent work site osterloh said on thursday in comments released on vw s internal communications network
group human resources boss karlheinz blessing commissioned to lead the change in culture at vw said the transformation needs more broadbased support to succeed
we have been saying all along that a culture change can not be implemented over the short term and takes time and is also not the work of an individual or of individual participants he said in a separate interview published internally at vw
all stakeholders are urged to bring about this culture separately osterloh who is seeking as works council chairman next month said that workers were critical of internal communication by management and expressed concerns about job safety and retirement conditions
given the continued negative news flow about vw with the latest revelations of diesel fume tests involving monkeys and humans and prosecutors raids on luxury brand audi it s no surprise that sentiment among staff is declining blessing said
with the negative headlines that keep surprising us it would be remarkable if sentiment was not affected he said
we can only apologize to staff for what they have to put up with even though we are not the originator of these reporting by andreas cremer and jan schwartz editing by david goodman
