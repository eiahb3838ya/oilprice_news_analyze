update 2-iran leader backs suggestion to block gulf oil exports if own sales stopped
dubai reuters iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on saturday backed president hassan rouhani s suggestion that iran may block gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped and said negotiations with the united states would be an obvious mistake
rouhani s apparent threat earlier this month to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring countries came in reaction to looming sanctions and efforts by washington to force all countries to stop buying iranian oil
khamenei said remarks by the president that if iran s oil is not exported no regional country s oil will be exported were important remarks that reflect the policy and the approach of iran s system khamenei s official website said
iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the strait of hormuz a major oil shipping route in retaliation for any hostile action
khamenei used a speech to foreign ministry officials on saturday to reject any renewed talks with the united states after president donald trump s decision to withdraw from a international deal over iran s nuclear program
the word and even the signature of the americans can not be relied upon so negotiations with america are of no avail khamenei said
it would be an obvious mistake to negotiate with the united states as washington was unreliable khamenei added according to his website
the endorsement by khamenei who has the last word on all major issues of state is likely to discourage any open opposition to rouhani s apparent threat
khamenei also voiced support for continued talks with iran s european partners in the nuclear deal which are preparing a package of economic measures to offset the pullout from the accord
negotiations with the europeans should not be stopped but we should not be just waiting for the european package but instead we should follow up on necessary activities inside the country against sanctions khamenei said
france said earlier this month that it was unlikely european powers would be able to put together an economic package for iran that would salvage its nuclear deal before november
iran s oil exports could fall by as much as by the end of the year because of new sanctions putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere in the world
washington initially planned to totally shut iran out of global oil markets after trump abandoned the deal that limited iran s nuclear ambitions demanding all other countries to stop buying its crude by november
but it has since somewhat eased its stance saying that it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on iranian supplies
