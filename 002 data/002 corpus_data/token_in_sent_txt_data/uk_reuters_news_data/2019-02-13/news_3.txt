update 2-mnuchin hopes for 'productive' trade meetings in china
beijing reuters treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on wednesday he hopes for productive trade meetings in china this week as the two countries seek to hammer out an agreement amid a festering dispute that has seen both level tariffs at each other
tariffs on billion billion pounds worth of imports from china are scheduled to rise to percent from percent if the two sides can not reach a deal by a march deadline increasing pain and costs in sectors from consumer electronics to agriculture
mnuchin asked by reporters as he left his beijing hotel what his hopes were for the visit said productive meetings
he did not elaborate
mnuchin along with trade representative robert lighthizer arrived in the chinese capital on tuesday
president donald trump said on tuesday that he could let the deadline for a trade agreement slide for a little while but that he would prefer not to and expects to meet with chinese president xi jinping to close the deal at some point
trump s advisers have previously described march as a hard deadline but trump told reporters for the first time that a delay was now possible
a growing number of businesses and lawmakers have expressed hopes for a delay in the tariff increase while the two sides tackle the difficult demands for major structural policy changes by china aimed at ending the forced transfer of american trade secrets curbing beijing s industrial subsidies and enforcing intellectual property rights
trump said last week he did not plan to meet with xi before the march deadline
mnuchin and lighthizer are scheduled to hold talks on thursday and friday with vice premier liu he the top economic adviser to xi
the latest round of talks in beijing kicked off on monday with discussions among officials to try to work out technical details including a mechanism for enforcing any trade agreement
a round of talks at the end of january ended with some progress reported but no deal and declarations that much more work was needed
china and the united states the world s two largest economies have a series of other disagreements too including over chinese telecoms giant huawei technologies
secretary of state mike pompeo cautioned allies on monday against deploying equipment from chinese telecoms giant huawei on their soil saying it would make it more difficult for washington to partner alongside them
the united states and its western allies believe huawei s apparatus could be used for espionage and see its expansion into central europe as a way to gain a foothold in the european union market
both the chinese government and huawei have dismissed these concerns
