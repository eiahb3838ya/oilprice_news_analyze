the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters sanctions on venezuela s oil company are tightening the global oil market and sending refiners around the world scrambling to find replacements for the country s heavy and extra heavy crudes
venezuela s heavy crudes such as merey have few close substitutes with the nearest being grades such as brazil s marlim mexico s maya canada s bow river and cold lake or iraq s basra heavy
most of those crudes have an even higher sulphur content than venezuela s which will require extra processing to make fuels of acceptable quality and in any event the quantities are limited in the short term
venezuela sanctions have arrived in a market that was already likely to be short of medium and heavy crudes because of sanctions on iran and opec s output cuts
the major oil exporters in the middle east gulf saudi arabia iraq united arab emirates kuwait and iran market mostly medium and heavy crudes
sanctions on iran and venezuela together with opec s output cuts have therefore removed mostly medium and heavy oils from the market leaving lighter grades relatively unaffected
the result is that prices of medium and heavy crudes have surged relative to their lighter counterparts since the middle of january
mars a medium crude grade from the gulf has moved to a rare premium over louisiana light sweet
oman another medium crude has moved to a premium over brent a light one
venezuela has the world s largest proven oil reserves amounting to around billion barrels ahead of saudi arabia on billion and canada at billion statistical review of world energy bp
but the country s oil industry has been in relative and absolute decline for the last years as problems of producing and marketing its heavy crudes have been compounded by an unattractive investment regime and mismanagement
venezuela s crude production slumped from million barrels per day in to just million bpd in recovering to million bpd in before slumping again to million bpd in
venezuela accounted for percent of opec output and percent of world production in but those percentages had fallen to just percent and percent respectively by
the country s very dense crudes some of which barely float on water are complicated to process and sell for a large discount compared to other producers
production has been hampered by corruption political interference and lack of foreign investment and technology to maintain existing fields and develop new ones
like iran another founding member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries venezuela s oil industry has been blighted by mismanagement unrest political instability diplomatic isolation and sanctions
output has gone into free fall as the country s isolation has increased shrinking from million bpd in to million bpd in and million bpd in according to the joint organisations data initiative
venezuela was once a major oil exporter to the united states but shipments have fallen from million bpd in to around bpd in petroleum supply monthly eia jan
venezuela s diminished importance in the global oil market and as a supplier to the united states has emboldened the administration to take a tough approach in attempting to oust the government of nicolas maduro
sanctions announced last month prohibit corporations and persons from financial transactions with oil company pdvsa
the treasury s guidance which appears deliberately unclear has left many buyers uncertain about whether they can do business with pdvsa without also falling foul of sanctions
the administration likely calculated any fallout from sanctions on oil prices would be small given the limited volumes of crude involved and the expectation that the standoff would be resolved quickly
but while venezuela s crude now accounts for a very limited share of the global oil market it plays a much more important role in the niche market for heavy crude
venezuela accounted for million bpd of crude production out of a worldwide total of million bpd in world oil review eni
heavy crudes are much harder to refine and tend to contain significant quantities of sulphur and other impurities that are costly to remove which is why they sell at a hefty discount to medium and light oils
for refineries that have invested in delayed coking units however heavy crudes can yield large volumes of middle distillates gasoil diesel and jet fuel
middle distillates are used mostly in freight transportation as well as manufacturing mining and farming and are particularly valuable late in the business cycle when economic activity is near to the peak
are especially prized at the moment with the forthcoming introduction of new bunker fuel regulations by the international maritime organization from the start of
in effect sanctions have shifted the balance of global oil production in the direction of lighter crudes at the same time that the economy and forthcoming regulations are pushing refinery demand towards heavier grades
the sudden embargo on venezuela s exports has therefore sent refiners in the united states and elsewhere scrambling to find alternative supplies compatible with their equipment
if refiners are unable to source enough heavy and extra heavy crude they will buy the next best alternative in this case medium density crudes so the impact of sanctions is rippling through the entire oil market
