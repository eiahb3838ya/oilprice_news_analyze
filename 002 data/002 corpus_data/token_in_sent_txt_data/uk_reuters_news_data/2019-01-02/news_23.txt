refile-rio tinto, mongolia sign power deal for oyu tolgoi copper mine
reuters rio tinto and mongolia have signed a deal for the supply of power to the miner s giant copper mine extension at oyu tolgoi by with both sides saying the framework agreement marked a step forward after a protracted dispute
the oyu tolgoi project is central to rio tinto s push to diversify its portfolio away from iron ore but it has faced a series of challenges as mongolia s fragile government wrangles over how to maximise benefits for the country
first production at the billion underground expansion located near the southern border with china is scheduled for early next decade creating one of the world s biggest copper suppliers
the construction of a megawatt plant close to the tavan tolgoi coalfields to supply electricity to the mine will start in under the new agreement
the plant is expected to be operational by slightly later than the date mooted after the government cancelled an earlier power agreement in february
the government of mongolia owns percent of oyu tolgoi with the remainder held by turquoise hill resources which in turn is percent owned by rio tinto
in a joint statement with oyu tolgoi the mongolian government said the agreement was a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of the tavan tolgoi coal mines and to supplying the wider region with domestic power
the statement said the partners would also consider how to incorporate the use of renewable power
oyu tolgoi would be the majority owner of the power plant with funding possibly including third party debt the statement said without giving further details
analysts welcomed the deal but said the deadline looked optimistic
this was the last major hurdle for the underground production badral bontoi chief executive of market intelligence group cover mongolia said
a mongolian government spokesman said the agreement was the first step to retain in the country the estimated million oyu tolgoi currently pays china for electricity each year with the figure set to rise when the underground extension comes online
rio tinto in july entered agreements with three chinese contractors on designing a power station to supply oyu tolgoi
on monday a spokesman declined to comment on the status of those tenders
rio tinto s shares have fallen by around percent this year and were down percent on monday
