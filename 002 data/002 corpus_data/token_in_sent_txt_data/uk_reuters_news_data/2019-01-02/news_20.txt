feature-biogas guzzlers: karachi's public buses to run on cow poo
islamabad jan thomson reuters foundation in a bid to freshen its air and cut emissions the pakistani port city of karachi will introduce buses powered by a decidedly unclean fuel cow poo
with funding from the international green climate fund karachi will launch a green bus rapid transit brt network with buses fuelled by
locals said the new bus system due to start operating in would help reduce air pollution and street noise but doubted whether it would have enough buses to resurrect the city s ailing transport system
karachi s public transport system has totally collapsed and most people have to use online services and auto rickshaws said commuter afzal ahmed who works as a medical sales representative
after management problems forced the karachi transport corporation to fold some two decades ago buses running on compressed natural gas fell into disrepair and were taken off the road worsening public transport woes he noted
malik amin aslam advisor on climate change to pakistan prime minister imran khan said the brt system was the first transport project the green climate fund had approved and would bring multiple environmental and economic benefits
it would not require operating subsidies he added
the cheap clean bus network will cater for passengers daily and will reduce emissions by million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over years according to project documents
the brt will consist of a corridor that will benefit million residents adding new bus stations secure pedestrian crossings improved sidewalks cycle lanes and facilities
the green climate fund set up under climate talks to provide finance to developing countries to help them grow cleanly and adapt to a warming climate will provide million for the karachi project out of a total cost of million
the other major funders are the asian development bank and the provincial government of sindh where karachi is located
the brt system to be rolled out over four years will have a fleet of hybrid buses that will run on produced from manure excreted by karachi s water buffaloes and collected by the authorities
the project will prevent about tonnes of cow manure entering the ocean daily by converting it into energy and fertiliser at a biogas plant and will save more than gallons of fresh water now used to wash that waste into the bay aslam said
ali tauqeer sheikh ceo of leadership for environment and development lead pakistan a policy said calculating the overall impact on the environment was complex as the buses would be introduced in stages
pakistan s authorities often lack maintenance budgets he noted highlighting the risk the buses could break down and not be repaired
pakistan has a history that it does not utilise donors project funding at an optimum level he said
but if all goes well sheikh said the project as the country s first green brt system would lay the foundation for urban transportation systems in other places
it could shake up approaches to public transport among policy makers and planners serving as a model for other cities including lahore multan peshawar and faisalabad he said
pakistan needs to launch such projects in big cities to discourage personal vehicle use thereby easing traffic emissions and smog and improving air quality and public health sheikh added
he recommended setting a target for percent of the urban population to use public transport
another way to ease air pollution would be to import petroleum fuels for vehicles he added
we are importing fuel and our refineries have capacity to refine only fuel he said
ahmad rafay alam an environmental lawyer said previous brt projects in pakistan s large cities had not focused on environmental sustainability
planners should start connecting transport systems with wider urban development alam said
we need to introduce urban design by encouraging the use of public transport and discouraging the use of private vehicles to reduce emissions he said
zia ur rehman a journalist covering civic issues noted that the sindh provincial government had run less than buses in the city in the last years while private buses and had dwindled from to
one reason is that buses were torched during strikes and at times of political upheaval he said
the new bus system alone was unlikely to resolve the city transport problems but would be a relief for commuters and also help in reducing air pollution he added
