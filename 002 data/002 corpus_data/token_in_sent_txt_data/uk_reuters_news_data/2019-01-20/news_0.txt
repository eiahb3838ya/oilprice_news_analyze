australia's solar, wind boom to power past grid woes in 2019
melbourne reuters australia s wind and solar boom looks set to power through following a record year despite grid constraints and extra scrutiny from network operators to make sure new projects don t spark blackouts like ones that hit two years ago
abundant wind and sun falling turbine and panel costs and corporate demand for contracts to hedge against rising power tariffs have attracted dozens of international developers looking to build wind and solar farms down under
even though the developers have met with on energy policy a strained grid that has trouble integrating intermittent renewable power and unexpected costs they still see australia as a growth market
we believe that we have a great future in australia because we have the right answers said xavier barbaro chief executive of france s neoen whose biggest market is australia
companies like neoen its compatriot india s adani utility aes corp and germany s sonnen are expanding in australia looking to fill a gap as ageing plants are retired over the next two decades
confidence is high as the industry enters with unprecedented levels of construction activity under way said anna freeman a director at the clean energy council an industry group
australia generates nearly percent of its electricity from renewables
this is forecast to jump to percent over the next years
a total of gigawatts gw of solar and wind projects worth a billion billion were under construction or reached financial close last year more than double s record according to the clean energy council

the australian energy market operator aemo the energy council and network companies are working out clear guidelines on where to build plants and how to connect them to the grid
we re moving from what was an approach into something that will be much more planned said currie whose company wants to develop australia s biggest renewable energy hub with gw of wind solar and pumped hydro capacity in new south wales
renewable projects added to the grid have grown from with gw of capacity in to a record projects with gw added in aemo said
there are more applications representing gw pending indicating plenty of potential congestion ahead
the biggest challenge is that developers are all vying to connect to a grid running km miles from queensland in the north to south australia and tasmania
see graphic this grid was designed to deliver power mainly from plants near three big mining areas while wind and solar farms generate intermittent power from more remote sites where network capacity can be limited
to keep the grid stable equipment such as synchronous condensers or batteries need to be added which can increase costs by at least million for a condenser alone
batteries could be much higher
developers who failed to account for these issues have run into delays on project approvals or grid bringing unanticipated costs which in one case led to the collapse of engineering firm rcr tomlinson last november

solar investor octopus investments said grid issues were what took it two years to choose its first investment in australia
the darlington point solar farm is about to begin construction and will be the country s largest
the grid is the biggest issue where assets fail in our project filter octopus managing director sam reynolds told reuters declining to name projects the company rejected
developers and project lenders said they need to consider grid congestion which can curtail power that gets to the network from any one plant intermittency of wind and solar power which affects current flow and transmission losses called marginal loss factors mlfs
there s a bit of nervousness around mlfs curtailment and then there s construction and commissioning risk said stephen panizza head of renewable energy at federation asset management
mlfs measure energy lost over power networks and have been increasing with renewable projects being on the outer reaches of the grid weakening returns for some operators
another factor is the cost of the extra technology to keep current steady on the grid as more intermittent power is added
in november france s agreed to buy a synchronous condenser to secure a connection agreement so it could build the a million kiamal solar farm in victoria
delays due to talks with aemo about the condenser however led to losing one of its power purchase agreements ppas
s asia pacific director michael vawser says other projects will face the same trouble
i do think there are other projects caught by new grid regulations that will lose their ppas through delays in being allowed to connect to the grid vawser told reuters in an interview in november
neoen which has built gw of wind and solar farms and the world s biggest battery in australia over the past four years said in a recent prospectus it had collected million euros million in damages from a contractor building three solar farms because of delays
despite the challenges neoen and their rivals are still scouring australia for more opportunities
australia is still an attractive market for us vawser said
