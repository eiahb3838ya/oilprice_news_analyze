update 1-emphasis on urgency as climate talks begin in coal city katowice
katowice poland reuters delegates from nearly nations on sunday began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important meeting on global warming since the landmark paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels
expectations are low that negotiations in katowice at the heart of poland s coal region will fully resolve concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions
the political climate has also been transformed since the paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered
this is a very very important conference climate chief patricia espinosa told reporters
it also takes place in a scenario where we have clear signals about the urgency with which we need to address the issues of climate four former presidents of talks including laurent fabius of france who led negotiations for the paris agreement issued a statement urging decisive action
the world is at a crossroads and decisive action in the next two years will be crucial to tackle these urgent threats they said in the joint statement
however political divisions were clear from the outset with brazil having withdrawn its offer to host the talks
the united states meanwhile reiterated at the summit in argentina on saturday its decision to withdraw from the paris accord and a commitment to all energy sources
deadline the other members of the group of industrialised nations including the biggest polluter china reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the paris deal taking into account their national circumstances
the katowice talks precede an deadline to produce a rule book to flesh out the broad details that were agreed in paris on limiting the rise in global temperatures to between and degrees celsius
delegates said that one of the trickiest issues could be monitoring emissions as the united states which can not quit the pact until uses the talks to press for a level of detail it perceives as useful to its foreign policy dealings
poland is hosting climate negotiations for a third time but the nation remains hooked on coal the most fossil fuel
coal provides about percent of poland s power and has been a major source of employment and national pride
the younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware though any phasing out of the fuel in poland is likely to be slow
the energy ministry said only last week that poland plans to invest in new coal capacity while its energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about percent of its power from coal in
