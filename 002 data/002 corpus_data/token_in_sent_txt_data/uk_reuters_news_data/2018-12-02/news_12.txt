climate talks begin in polish coal city katowice
has deadline to agree rule book members except united states sign declaration of support brazil pulls out of hosting talks by barbara lewis and anna koper katowice poland dec reuters delegates from nearly nations on sunday began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important meeting on global warming since the landmark paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels
expectations are low that negotiations in katowice at the heart of poland s coal region will be sufficient to address concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions
the political climate has also been transformed since the paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered
fijian prime minister frank bainimarama declared the conference open on sunday and handed over the presidency of the talks to michal kurtyka poland s deputy environment minster
we will all have to show creativity and flexibility kurtyka said
stoking the tensions brazil has gone back on an earlier promise to host next year s climate conference
the united states meanwhile reiterated at the summit in argentina on saturday its decision to withdraw from the paris accord and a commitment to using all energy sources
the other members of the group of industrialised nations including the biggest polluter china reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the paris deal taking into account their national circumstances and relative capabilities
the katowice talks precede an deadline to produce a rule book to flesh out the broad details that were agreed in paris aimed at limiting the rise in global temperatures to between and degrees celsius
to give the negotiations a better chance the start of the katowice talks was brought forward by a day
poland is hosting climate negotiations for a third time but the nation remains hooked on coal the most fossil fuel
coal provides about percent of poland s power and has been a major source of employment and national pride
the younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware though any phasing out of the fuel in poland is likely to be slow
the energy ministry said only last week that the country plans to invest in new coal capacity while its energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about percent of its power from coal in
