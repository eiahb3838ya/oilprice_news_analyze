update 5-macron tells pm to hold talks after worst unrest in paris for decades
paris reuters french president emmanuel macron ordered his prime minister on sunday to hold talks with political leaders and demonstrators as he sought a way out of nationwide protests after rioters turned central paris into a battle zone
riot police on saturday were overwhelmed as protesters ran amok in paris s wealthiest neighbourhoods torching dozens of cars looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since
the unrest began as a backlash against fuel tax hikes but has spread
it poses the most formidable challenge yet to macron s presidency with the escalating violence and depth of public anger against his economic reforms catching the leader and battling to regain control
after a meeting with members of his government on sunday the french presidency said in a statement that the president had asked his interior minister to prepare security forces for future protests and his prime minister to hold talks with political party leaders and representatives of the protesters
a french presidential source said macron would not speak to the nation on sunday despite calls for him to offer immediate concessions to demonstrators and said the idea of imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed
arriving back from the summit in argentina macron had earlier rushed to the arc de triomphe a revered monument and epicentre of saturday s clashes where protesters had scrawled macron resign and the yellow vests will triumph
the yellow vest rebellion erupted out of nowhere on with protesters blocking roads across france and impeding access to some shopping malls fuel depots and airports
violent groups from the far right and far left as well as youths from the suburbs infiltrated saturday s protests the authorities said
government spokesman benjamin griveaux had indicated the macron administration was considering imposing a state of emergency
the president was open to dialogue he said but would not reverse policy reforms
we won t change course
we are certain of that he told europe radio
as he spoke workmen in the district of central paris set about cleaning the defaced arc removing charred hulks of cars and replacing the shattered windows of banks restaurants and glitzy boutiques
while the protests were initially against macron s fuel tax hikes necessary he says to combat climate change they have also mined a vein of deep dissatisfaction felt towards his liberal reforms which many voters feel favour the wealthy and big business
police said they had arrested more than people in paris on saturday and that were injured
some tear gas canisters and stun grenades were fired as well as water canon as security forces fought for control
macron s plight illustrates a conundrum how do political leaders introduce policies that will do good for the environment without inflicting extra costs on voters that may damage their chances of
his unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with common folk outside of france s big cities who worry about the squeeze on household budgets and job security
the protests have driven macron s popularity to record lows and left him facing a situation said gael sliman president of the odoxa polling institute said
either macron caves in to the pressure and is derided by opponents as weak or he puts down the dissent sliman said
in the second scenario macron will still come out loser because what everyone will remember is that he wrestled with the popular classes
he would be victorious but at the cost of having crushed before heading into sunday s meeting macron met under heavy security with police and firefighters near the champs elysees boulevard
some bystanders cheered others jeered and called on him to resign
so too did melenchon head of party la france insoumise france unbowed and leader marine le pen who both demanded the government unwind its fuel tax hikes
they called for parliament to be dissolved and snap elections held
such an outcome is unlikely however
macron has years left of his mandate and a strong majority in parliament albeit with signs of simmering unease on the backbenches over his response to the protests
tv footage showed the interior of the arc ransacked a statue of marianne symbol of the french republic smashed and graffiti scrawled on the exterior ranging from slogans to social demands and calls for macron s resignation
on nearby streets some parisians worried of a repeat of the violence next weekend
the yellow vests have already called another demonstration in paris
the violence is increasing at an exponential rate said claude a resident in the affluent district
the state is losing control it is scary
they can not let this happen
