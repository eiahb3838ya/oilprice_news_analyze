update 6-big is back: canada's mega lng project gets green light on asia demand
reuters the approval on tuesday of a massive liquefied natural gas export lng terminal in canada is being touted as the return of the ending a lean period where low energy prices and oversupply concerns kept investors from taking big risks
the c billion billion lng canada project led by royal dutch shell was given the by the giant and its partners making it the fuel s first major new project to win approval in recent years
construction will start immediately with first shipments of the fuel expected before aiming to feed surging demand from asian buyers primarily china
it seems that are back said dulles wang director north america gas at wood mackenzie in an email note adding that lng canada is the biggest greenfield project to be approved globally since russia s yamal lng in
lng from the project will reach asia in about half the time it takes from the gulf coast lng canada said
global lng demand is expected to double by with much of that growth coming from asia where gas is displacing coal it said
at the same time output from older projects is set to decline in coming years just as soaring demand from china india and southeast asia is devouring a supply glut previously expected to last for years fanning fears that an lng shortage may be looming
lng canada s fid would signal the appetite to invest in lng is back said saul kavonic director for asia pacific markets and head of energy research at credit suisse in australia
lng canada to be built in the northern community of kitimat british columbia also marks the largest investment project in canadian history prime minister justin trudeau said at a vancouver news conference
the announcement provides a boost for trudeau s ruling liberals who have struggled with an exodus of global energy firms from alberta s oil sands as well as setbacks in building a crude pipeline expansion to canada s pacific coast
we can t build energy projects like we did in the old days where the environment and the economy were seen as opposing forces trudeau said
they must go the project was approved by all its stakeholders shell malaysia s petroliam nasional bhd petronas petrochina co ltd korea gas corp kogas and japan s mitsubishi getting an lng project to a final investment decision is like a moon landing maarten wetselaar shell s integrated gas and new energies director said in vancouver
it is very very difficult to do and requires the project s c billion price tag includes the export terminal the associated pipeline and site work contingency and upstream carrying costs
within that broader number the cost of building the terminal has been pegged at billion with the coastal gaslink pipeline running c billion
pipeline operator transcanada corp said it expects to start construction on the pipeline in early which will carry natural gas from the montney region of british columbia and alberta to the lng canada facility
the project owners will provide their own natural gas supply and will individually market their share of lng
lng canada s initial output will be million tonnes per annum mtpa from two trains or processing units with the option to add two more trains to expand to mtpa
canada has committed c million to infrastructure and environmental performance measures related to lng canada which will have the lowest carbon intensity of any large lng facility in the world trudeau said
the project will boost canada s oilpatch which has struggled to attract investment amid pipeline constraints and investor malaise over a recent court decision overturning the approval of the trans mountain pipeline expansion
natural gas producers such as encana corp and tourmaline oil corp stand to gain as canada s depressed gas prices rise raymond james analysts said
smaller pipeline companies including pembina pipeline corp will also benefit said rbc analyst robert kwan
the construction decision comes amid a trade dispute that has led to tariffs being imposed by china on lng shipments from the united states threatening president donald trump s energy dominance plan
china is the major buyer of lng and in overtook south korea to become the world s no
importer behind japan
energy consultancy wood mackenzie said it appeared project partners had pushed hard to reach an investment decision with rival projects progressing in qatar russia mozambique and the united states
i don t see it as a case of replacing cargoes more about meeting projected demand growth said wood mackenzie analyst nicholas browne
