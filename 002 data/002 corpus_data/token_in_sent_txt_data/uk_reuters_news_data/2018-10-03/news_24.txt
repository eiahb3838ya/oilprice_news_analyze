french energy plan to go slow on cutting nuclear dependency
focus to prevent nuclear closures no closures seen beyond fessenheim during macron term by benjamin mallet paris oct reuters france will adopt a approach to reducing its reliance on nuclear energy with a focus on cutting carbon emissions in its new energy plan this month industrial sources said
this scenario has been put forward in order to maintain a high share of nuclear and to protect the interests of the state as power utility edf shareholder an energy industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told reuters
france s energy plan ppe for and is set to lay out how and by when it will cut the share of nuclear in its overall power generation to percent from percent and to detail how many of edf s nuclear plants will have to close to achieve that target
several sources involved with drafting the plan said that it will be framed by the energy ministry s strategy and will attempt to preserve edf s nuclear fleet
an edf source said that the strategy is set to protect percent edf from nuclear closures through a focus on phasing out stations
the edf source said it was unlikely the plan would require any closures before the end of president emmanuel macron s term in apart from the already scheduled shutdown of the two fessenheim reactors unless regulator asn ordered any
macron is a staunch defender of the nuclear industry but is under pressure from the left wing of his centrist movement following the resignation of his popular environment minister nicolas hulot and ahead of european elections next year
hulot resigned in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals and nuclear energy policy
the ppe could possibly buy more time by delaying a decision on which reactors will have to be closed until asn has given a generic ruling on the feasibility of lifespan extension which is not expected before
edf has repeatedly said it wants to extend the lifespan of its nuclear plants from to and even years and does not plan any reactor closures before other than fessenheim
french daily les echos reported on wednesday that edf proposes closing to reactors between and while rte considers six of edf s oldest reactors could be closed between and
the ppe is also expected to advise on edf s request to build a new nuclear plant once it completes the flamanville reactor
new environment minister fran√ßois de rugy has said it first needs to prove the viability of flamanville
