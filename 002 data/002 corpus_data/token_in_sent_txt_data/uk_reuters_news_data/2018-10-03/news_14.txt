global energy bosses send trump a message: world needs russian gas
moscow reuters global energy bosses assembled in moscow on wednesday said the world needed russian gas to keep the lights on in a clear message to president donald trump who has warned he may impose sanctions on russian gas export projects
trump s administration citing what it calls russia s failure to act as a good global citizen has said it may take steps to block the nord stream gas pipeline which will increase the volumes russia can export to northern europe
the position has prompted a backlash from the kremlin and from business groups in germany and on wednesday leading figures in the global energy industry attending a forum in the russian capital joined the chorus
while not explicitly singling out trump s policies for criticism they said russian gas was a vital part of the energy mix and that liquefied natural gas touted by washington as a viable alternative was too expensive
royal dutch shell ceo ben van beurden said if the imposes sanctions on export projects his company will have no choice but to abide by those restrictions
but he added it s clear that europe will need more imports indigenous production in europe is in decline we will need to import in europe from multiplicity of russia has been a very reliable supplier of gas for many decades
the cost of supply of russian gas is probably one of the most competitive he said at the forum
patrick pouyanne chief executive of french oil major total said lng produced at russia s yamal project was highly competitive with more competitive projects still to come
i think it s just only the start of the story and this will be one of the largest provinces for natural gas in the both shell and total have a vested interest in keeping russian gas flowing to world markets
shell is an investor with russia s gazprom in the lng project off russia s pacific coast while total is an investor in the yamal project
saudi arabia is russia s rival on the global oil market but saudi energy minister khalid who was also at the energy forum said the world needed russian gas
he said national energy firm saudi aramco wanted to be involved in delivering russian lng to world markets including to saudi arabia
there are great resources great conditions in russia and the market forces here in russia are very conducive to globalisation and to allowing this competitive healthy process of bringing the cheapest resources to the markets he said
the trump administration has sought to sanction russian export pipelines before but stayed its hand after intense lobbying from the european union eu and business groups
but the issue has returned to washington s agenda this year
russian president vladimir putin told the forum that russian gas exports to the eu would this year reach a record level of billion cubic meters
he said that lng imports from the united states were percent more expensive than russian gas and that the german economy would be rendered uncompetitive if it had to rely on the imports
referring to the president s warnings of sanctions putin said i understand donald he s fighting for his country s interests for his industry and he s right to do but in this case american lng on the european market is more expensive not by a bit but by percent
