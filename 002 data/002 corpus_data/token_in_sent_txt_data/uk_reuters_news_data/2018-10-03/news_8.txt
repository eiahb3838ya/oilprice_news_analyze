exclusive-saudi arabia, russia agreed in sept to lift oil output, told u.s.
reuters russia and saudi arabia struck a private deal in september to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the united states before a meeting in algiers with other producers four sources familiar with the plan said
president donald trump has blamed the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the congressional elections on
the deal underlines how russia and saudi arabia are increasingly deciding oil output policies bilaterally before consulting with the rest of opec
the sources said saudi energy minister khalid and his russian counterpart alexander novak agreed during a series of meetings to lift output from september through december as crude headed toward a barrel
it is now over
the russians and the saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on trump s order to pump more one source said
the saudi minister told energy secretary rick perry that saudi arabia will raise output if its customers asked for more oil another source said
originally the two countries had hoped to announce an overall increase of barrels per day bpd from opec and russia at a gathering of oil ministers in algiers at the end of september
but with opposition from some in opec including iran which is subject to sanctions they decided to defer any formal decision until a full opec meeting in december
saudi is trying to thread a needle with a rope by satisfying customer concerns about higher oil prices but also wanting to keep prices from falling and sending the wrong price signal to industry which absolutely needs to continue to invest to prevent a supply crunch yasser elguindi energy market strategist at consultancy energy said
executives at the world s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves and halt declines in crude production after years of austerity
since the meeting in algiers reuters has reported that riyadh planned to lift output by some bpd to bpd from september to help fill the gap left by lower iranian output due to the sanctions
russian output rose bpd in september
iran accused saudi arabia and russia on wednesday of breaking opec s agreement on output cuts by producing more crude adding that the two countries would not be able to produce enough oil to make up for a reduction in iranian exports
a source at a major russian oil company told reuters i would expect russia s oil production will hover at around to million bpd until the end of and may increase further to million bpd later on in russian produced million bpd in september up from million bpd in august energy ministry data showed
russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday it could raise production by to bpd to tackle possible fuel shortages while falih said saudi arabia will increase output further in november from million bpd
perry was made aware of the plan to lift output before the algiers gathering meeting with falih three times in september and novak once
the three did not meet together
perry s spokeswoman shaylyn hynes did not comment on details of the talks but said the energy secretary continues to be engaged with leaders from other major oil producing nations and remains confident in their ability to boost output if needed
she said perry had in recent meetings impressed upon his counterparts that keeping supply up is important for the global economy
oil prices rose to a barrel this week as buyers of iranian crude wound down their purchases to meet the terms of sanctions on tehran
sources said riyadh would help fill that shortfall because buyers needed replacement supplies
saudi arabia has spare capacity to produce oil at a higher rate and holds a large volume of crude in storage
at the same time saudi arabia is keen to maintain unity among the alliance a group comprising opec states russia and several other producers that has agreed on output curbs
that s because it may need to change course and seek the collaboration of for any future production cuts
iranian crude exports are considerably lower and market participants are concerned of a wide market deficit this quarter said giovanni staunovo analyst at swiss bank ubs
to cover those losses saudi arabia russia and the other gulf countries are increasing production but this will bring down the global spare capacity to a in the run up to the private deal with russia falih flew to the united states during the second week of september where he and fellow texas a m university alumnus perry attended a football game in college station texas
falih then held official talks with perry in washington on the energy department has said
perry flew to moscow two days later to meet novak while falih also met novak in moscow a day later
perry told reuters during his moscow visit that saudi arabia the united states and russia had enough capacity between them to compensate for the loss of iranian supply over the next months
after moscow falih and perry met again in vienna where they attended an event in the austrian capital sources said
perry was aware that russia is going to ramp up oil output a third source familiar with talks said
it was at this point that falih and novak discussed announcing a increase at the algiers meeting of opec and countries
the plan did not materialize with any formal decision deferred until a regular opec meeting in vienna on
saudi arabia is not going to flood the market and risk a price crash
saudi arabia has to work with other producers and see what are they doing who is raising exports and to which market another source said
