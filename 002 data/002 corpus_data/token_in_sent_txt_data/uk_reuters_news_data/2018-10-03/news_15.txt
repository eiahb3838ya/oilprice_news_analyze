governor of nigeria's commercial hub lagos defeated in bid for second term
lagos oct reuters the governor of nigeria s commercial hub lagos a prominent ruling party figure lost his bid on wednesday to seek a second term following a primary selection process that exposed internal divisions in a crucial state months ahead of polls next year
lagos state with a city of some million inhabitants is the driving force in one of africa s biggest economies and a key election battleground in the southwest
the region s support for president muhammadu buhari and his ruling all progressives congress apc party proved to be crucial in the presidential and gubernatorial races that swept the leader to power
but there have been signs of waning support for buhari and his party in the southwest most recently in the apc s narrow win last week in the governorship election in osun state
and the lagos primary race exposed rifts within the party
akinwunmi ambode who took office in was defeated by babajide in the apc s primaries for gubernatorial elections to be held in march just weeks after february s presidential election in which buhari will seek a second term
i declare babajide the winner said clement ebri chairman of the apc lagos governorship primary committee at a briefing broadcast on national television
the hard fought contest in lagos was at times rancorous and prompted ambode to call for unity in the wake of his defeat
in a televised address he urged apc members to unite behind the candidate of the party so that we can continue to move this state forward
the governor of lagos is a powerful figure who controls a budget bigger than many african countries
ambode s defeat follows weeks of reports in local media that he had lost the support of bola tinubu himself a former lagos state governor and a political godfather in the region
tinubu s backing for buhari in the predominantly christian southwest played a pivotal role in the northern muslim securing his first term delivering much needed support beyond the president s core northern base
