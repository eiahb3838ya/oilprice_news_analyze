update 1-looming large: shell's lng canada seen as tip of megaproject iceberg
reuters the launch of a massive liquefied natural gas lng export project in canada could fire the starting gun on a wave of other approvals around the world potentially curbing a supply crunch expected after
royal dutch shell on tuesday said it would export lng from the west of canada by after approving a c billion billion project capable of initially producing million tonnes a year
that comes just weeks after qatar the world s top lng exporter said it would expand its already huge annual output of million tonnes to million tonnes in the coming years
the canada and qatar developments will significantly boost the around million tonnes of lng traded per year helping ease a supply shortage expected in the next decade amid surging appetite for cleaner fuels from places such as china and wider asia
the projects are seen as just the start with a host of other approvals known as final investment decisions fids expected to follow after waiting in company drawers while lng prices recovered from a slump
lng canada s fid signals the appetite to invest in lng is back said saul kavonic an energy researcher at credit suisse
with prices almost tripling from lows to over per million british thermal units mmbtu as demand gathers steam the industry has regained confidence and is preparing to invest in new projects again
another million tonnes per year of capacity is expected to be approved by the end of
we believe could be the busiest year of lng fids ever said wood mackenzie s director of north america gas dulles wang
forecasts vary but lng demand is expected to jump to about million tonnes by the international energy agency has said while consultancy wood mackenzie expects tonnes a year
as well as china appetite is also expected to grow strongly in south asia where india pakistan and bangladesh are all driving ahead on lng import developments
if you look at the demand curve and the supply coming on stream there are simply not enough supply projects that are being sanctioned or under development to meet demand by shell s chief financial officer jessica uhl said on tuesday
the firm is the world s biggest single lng supplier
but the wave of projects in the pipeline will go some way to crimping any shortage
projects with a total of another million tonnes per year of production capacity in the united states have already been approved and are expected to start operations by the end of
a host of other companies are also looking to approvals including for tellurian s million tonnes driftwood project
other large project approvals on the horizon include novatek s arctic project with million tonnes capacity after the russian gas company s yamal export facility started operations smoothly and quickly at the end of last year
several projects are also planned in africa including two in mozambique one led by exxon mobil corp and the other by anadarko petroleum
in asia exxon expects to expand its operations in papua new guinea and there are also plans to extend australia s huge facilities
even with strong demand growth many analysts warn that not all lng projects vying for fid will make it especially as renewable energy is becoming increasingly
consultancy deloitte warned during september s gastech industry gathering that projects that failed to lower costs to compete with solar plus storage would likely fail
similarly rbc capital markets said the test for canada lng will be whether shell can deliver the project on the stated budget without cost increases and on time
rbc said it estimated canada lng s cost breakeven was around per mmbtu
that s below the average spot lng price of around per mmbtu since but only on a par with its average
