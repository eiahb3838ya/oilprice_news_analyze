analysis-after lean years, big oil is under pressure to spend
london reuters executives at the world s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves halt output declines and take advantage of a crude price rally after years of austerity
with oil at a high of a barrel exploration departments are urging company boards to drill more wages are creeping higher service companies say rates will have to rise and some investors say big oil must start growing again soon
for the heads of companies such as bp chevron and royal dutch shell who have pledged to stick to lower spending after slashing budgets by as much as percent since the pressure may become hard to resist
as in previous oil price cycles there are concerns about the strength and duration of the business cycle now in its year of growth after the financial crisis
unlike previous oil price cycles there is the prospect eventually of an end to growth in oil demand as the world shifts to cleaner energy
but there are already signs some cost cuts implemented after oil slumped from a barrel in to in are being rolled back
shell for example said last month its teams in the uk north sea will switch to a less tiring rota of two weeks offshore then three weeks onshore
during the austerity years teams spent three weeks offshore then four onshore
more frequent rotations mean more ships and helicopters will need to be chartered
shell says the change will increase costs slightly but is convinced it will make its north sea operations more cost effective and productive
more generally salaries across the oil and gas sector have edged up about percent so far in after declining in the previous three years according to a survey published by rigzone
at one major firm senior managers who had been meeting by video conference for several years are now getting flights approved for gatherings according to an executive at the company
the boards of large oil firms are facing more internal requests to invest in new projects and acquisitions and to beef up staff according to senior executives present at such discussions
there is lots of pressure from all the units to get more money said an executive at a large european oil company

shell and its partners this week gave the green light to lng canada one of the largest liquefied natural gas lng projects in recent years
shell s motivations for the project are clear without this project the company s upstream lng contract portfolio and lng production was set to go into decline early next decade wood mackenzie analyst dulles wang said
typically after a period of lower capital spending or capex and low prices comes an era of rapid investment as oil recovers and supplies tighten
during the lean years companies cut back sharply
now they generate as much cash as in and are vowing to remain thrifty to focus on higher dividends buying back shares and reducing debt
but in an industry where reserves and production decline naturally as oil is pumped from fields continued investment is considered critical
we are likely in need of more investments given the persistent and accelerating base declines observed in global conventional and offshore projects said a source at in investment firm with large stakes in big oil companies
although some companies such as bp were able to stem production declines thanks to technology and lower costs a drop in new production has taken a toll on the outlook for many companies
oilfield decline rates doubled from percent in to percent in
for the big oil firms rates went from percent to just over percent during the same period according to morgan stanley
i expect capex rises due to a significant drop in reservoir life
some capex will be used to reinvigorate existing wells said darren sissons partner at campbell lee ross investment management adding that increases would be cautious initially
for a graphic showing reserve life for major oil companies reserve life https spending by the world s top seven oil companies is expected to rise to a combined billion by from billion in according to analysts at morgan stanley and jefferies
starting from the middle of next year boards will change their tone to prepare shareholders for higher spending from morgan stanley analyst martijn rats said
new project awards will likely already accelerate in but for major developments capex in the first year tends to be limited
from onwards capex is likely to go boards are not blind to the pressure
many companies have defined a range for spending while committing to the lower end
shell for example has a soft floor and a hard ceiling for spending of billion to billion per year
for some companies such as italy s eni which is developing major gas projects in egypt and mozambique boosting costs may be unavoidable
oil companies proved themselves in a low oil price environment but at some point they do need to start respending on new projects to keep getting oil out of the ground said david smith fund manager of the henderson high income trust
patrick pouyanne chief executive of french oil company total conceded this week that while it aimed to stick to its spending range of billion to billion a year beyond capex could rise to billion
our view is that the majors capex is probably to percent or so too low if they are to maintain their current reserve lives said jonathan waghorn of guinness asset management s global energy fund
for a graphic showing upstream investment by oil and gas companies the pressure to increase spending also comes at a time oil services companies are slowly increasing rates saying their sacrifices to help big oil weather the slump should now be rewarded as crude prices rise
current investment levels particularly in the international market are clearly not sustainable to meet either demand or reserves replacement needs paal kibsgaard chief executive officer of schlumberger the world s largest oil services provider told a conference last month
he said the international production base needed growth in investment for the foreseeable future just to keep production at current levels
but investors and executives say reserve life which was at its lowest in at least two decades in is no longer the gold standard for measuring the health of oil companies
a spending splurge could also eat into profits and revive fears oil companies are returning to the wasteful practices of the first half of the decade when crude prices soared
historically excess free cash flow above dividend cost has seen capex rise in the industry but the sector is trying to shake off the capital indiscipline tag and i believe they will stick to that said rohan murphy analyst at allianz global investors
