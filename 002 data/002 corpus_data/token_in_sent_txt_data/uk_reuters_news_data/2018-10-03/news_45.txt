repeats with no changes

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london oct reuters opec and oil traders are now in fundamental disagreement about the market outlook and the standoff is fuelling a sharp rise in prices that could spell trouble for the global economy over the next months
the overall balance between supply and demand is healthy according to a statement from the joint ministerial monitoring committee of opec and producers last month
the committee expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook according to a press statement released afterwards jmmc meets in algiers to monitor developments in the oil market opec
but where the committee sees a balanced market and warned about downside risks to demand in traders see a market that is increasingly tight and are worried about the adequacy of future supply
brent crude futures have jumped by almost per barrel percent since the middle of august including an increase of nearly percent since the jmmc meeting to their highest in almost four years
brent s calendar spread which has been a good proxy for the global balance in the last years has risen by per barrel and swung from a small contango into a pronounced backwardation
the recent intense backwardation in brent futures close to delivery and the surge in oman crude prices to a rare premium over brent are all consistent with a market that fears physical shortages in the next few months
hedge funds and other money managers have boosted their bullish position in brent by million barrels since late august an increase of more than percent including million barrels in the aftermath of the jmmc
nearly all hedge fund managers expect oil prices to rise rather than fall in the short to medium term according to exchange data
fund managers hold bearish short positions in brent amounting to just million barrels the level in the last five years
across the entire petroleum complex including crude and refined fuels hedge fund short positions have fallen the lowest level since at least
where opec is worried about the potential for a slowdown in oil consumption growth as a result of rising prices and a possible downturn in the global economy traders are more worried about the impact of sanctions on iran
the standoff between the jmmc in reality saudi arabia its most powerful member and oil traders about the state of the oil market is reminiscent of earlier periods of rising prices
opec and traders fundamentally disagreed for almost the entire run up in oil prices in with opec insisting the market was while traders continued to bid up prices amid concerns about shortages
experience suggests prices will continue rising until a evidence of demand destruction becomes clear or b the increase in prices forces a reaction from opec and its allies
opec tends to react to price changes rather than lead them which is why its influence over the oil market is usually overstated by many commentators
in this instance prices will continue rising until there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth or an adjustment in production and sanctions policy from saudi arabia russia or the white house
traders are hunting for the price threshold that forces one of those developments
in the meantime the blame game is heating up with the white house and opec each trying to claim the rise in prices is not their fault
president donald trump has blamed opec for rising prices in a message on twitter on and in a speech to the united nations on
trump has also reportedly discussed oil supplies and prices in a phone call with the king of saudi arabia on trump calls saudi s king to discuss oil supplies reuters
despite close coordination between the united states and saudi arabia on the issue of iran sanctions neither wants to be blamed for the escalation in fuel costs
the recent rise in oil prices confirms closely to the traditional pattern
oil prices are not inherently and display strongly and cyclical behaviour
the oil market cycles between periods of and
the market is rarely balanced or in equilibrium except by accident and not usually for very long
experience strongly suggests oil prices will continue on a rising trajectory until softening consumption growth or an acceleration in production knocks them onto a new course
by hedge funds and other traders will accelerate and exaggerate the price movement in the short term but is not the underlying cause of volatility
if the past is any guide and it usually is opec and its allies will resist changing production citing concerns about consumption and the growth in alternative supplies until the political pressure on them becomes overwhelming
by that point prices will already be close to peaking extra opec and supplies will come too late with consumption already slowing and add to the subsequent slump
