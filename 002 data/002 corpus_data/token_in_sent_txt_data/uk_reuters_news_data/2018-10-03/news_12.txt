ethiopian pm pushes for unity after months of ethnic violence
hawassa ethiopia reuters ethiopia s prime minister abiy ahmed told members of his ruling coalition that an attack on one is an attack on all on wednesday as he pushed for unity after months of ethnic violence
abiy has presided over a series of jolting political and economic changes since coming to office in april making peace with eritrea freeing political prisoners pledging to open up the economy and promising to overhaul the security services
but the reforms have not stopped violence that has escalated since he was named premier including in his own native oromiya region where protesters first took to the streets in over perceived marginalisation by the state
if we are see a developed ethiopia we should not commit violence on the basis of ethnicity or religion he told about delegates at the congress of ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front eprdf in the southern city of hawassa
an attack on one is an attack on all
the displaced of one is the displacement of all
the death of one is the death of all he added
abiy has promised to push for reconciliation and allowed the leadership of the separatist oromo liberation front olf previously outlawed as a terrorist organisation as well as the opposition group patriotic ginbot to return from exile
but the fighting has continued
clashes about km miles from hawassa between two ethnic groups the oromos and gedeos have forced nearly a million people to flee their homes since abiy took power
last week more than people mostly ethnic oromos were targeted by members of other groups in the western state of regional officials said
abiy the first leader from the oromo ethnic group in ethiopia s modern history used his speech to praise past leaders as he sought to reassure the coalition after his changes
a country develops through transitions and a handover of leadership
the new generation should not blame the old generation but be grateful for their achievements and sacrifice he said
it is not about wiping out history a history that has brought us here abiy told the audience many of them wearing and hats emblazoned with the logos of the four ethnic groupings in the eprdf
there was scattered applause through his remarks in a large conference hall
the former army officer who speaks three ethiopian languages has delighted many in the country and among its western backers by ending the military standoff with eritrea
but there were signs the rapid changes had caused misgivings in some quarters
two people were killed and scores wounded in a grenade attack on a rally attended by abiy in june
the tigrayan people s liberation front an ethnic tigrayan movement that had dominated the eprdf until abiy s rise and led the fight against mengistu initially warned against making concessions to eritrea
abiy took over after street protests forced the resignation of the last prime minister hailemariam desalegn in february
wednesday s congress was the party s first since the unrest started to spread in
