china approves large new upstream dam project on the yangtze river
shanghai jan reuters china has approved construction of one of its tallest dams a hydroelectric structure on the upstream section of its longest river the yangtze the state planning agency said on tuesday
hydropower is a clean and renewable source of energy but construction in southwest china has sparked accusations of damage to fragile ecosystems and inadequate compensation to thousands who have lost their homes
as concern grows over the social and environmental costs of large hydroelectric dams china has become more cautious of approving new projects in recent years
great importance must be attached to environmental protection and migrant resettlement work during the construction the state planner the national development and reform commission said in a notice
the reservoir of the lawa hydroelectric project will submerge nearly sq miles sq km of forest and farmland on the jinsha branch of the yangtze on the border between sichuan and tibet
the project is envisaged to eventually consist of four turbines with a total capacity of megawatts gigawatts
that compares with china s total hydropower capacity of gigawatts by the end of last year with about gw contributed by projects an industry group said last week
state power giant huadian group will hold a stake of percent in the project with local firms holding the rest
planned total investment of billion yuan billion will include billion yuan to cover the costs of relocating and compensating people displaced by construction
industry advocates say big dams are the most efficient way of bringing electricity to remote and undeveloped regions and china has promised to improve the way it compensates displaced residents
in its notice the ndrc also said it would look at ways of using the new project to boost local income
it has also launched a campaign to clear up disordered hydropower on the yangtze with an audit last year putting the number of projects along the river and its tributaries at
many new facilities are located in remote regions of tibet and the southwestern sichuan and yunnan provinces where relocation and environmental costs can be minimised
