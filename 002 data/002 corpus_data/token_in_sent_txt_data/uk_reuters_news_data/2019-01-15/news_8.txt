global markets-stocks tripped by earnings angst, sterling huddled for brexit vote
graphic world fx rates in pound near high before brexit vote euro kicked lower by soft german economic data oil nudges higher on supply cut talk bond yields slip lower after weak data friendly fed jp morgan earnings miss scuffs wall street futures by marc jones london jan reuters spluttering noises from germany and an earnings miss from banking giant jp morgan dragged back stocks on tuesday while britain s pound hovered near a high ahead of a crucial parliamentary vote on brexit
most european markets started in good spirits after attempts by washington and beijing to play down the risks associated with their trade war and sterling s bizarrely positive twist on the looming brexit drama
but things began to wobble when german reported its weakest growth in five years and then wall street futures flinched as jp morgan blamed bond market volatility for fourth quarter profits
there were still remnants of positive sentiment
shanghai and hong kong stocks had gained almost percent overnight after president trump talked up the chances of a china trade deal and chinese officials then came out in force hinting at more stimulus for their slowing economy
tokyo had risen percent on return from holiday too and seoul ended up smartly as well
it seems like a coordinated effort between the and china said saxo bank s head of global equities strategy peter garnry highlighting how the federal reserve had also scaled back talk of multiple rate hikes
for now at least it seems to be working he added given that china s plans to cut some taxes showed its policymakers were starting to wake up to its problems
all other focus was largely on britain s brexit gyrations
the pound barely budged at and was up percent at pence per euro in london having strengthened steadily in recent weeks
but the surface calm was deceptive
worries of britain plunging out of the eu at the end of march without some kind of transition deal appear to have eased but with may potentially facing the biggest defeat for a uk government plan in years uncertainty still dominates
may s hopes of keeping her plan alive will hinge on the scale of her expected loss
avoiding a heavy defeat could give her the chance to ask brussels for more concessions before trying to get the plan through parliament in another vote
but a humiliating outcome could pressure her to delay britain s scheduled march eu departure date and potentially open up other options ranging from a second referendum the dangerous no deal path or even a general election
we are recommending our clients not to take strong positions on the pound or the equity markets garnry added
the vote was due around gmt

australian financial shares also hit their highest since early december while japanese electronics and shares rose to their best levels in six weeks
local currency emerging market government debt which was pounded last year when investors dumped riskier assets on the trade war worries rallied to a near high
it appears some contrarian investors are starting to buy cyclicals looking beyond the last economic slowdown said nobuhiko kuramochi chief strategist at mizuho securities
but i would suspect there will be heavy selling if we go up further to around in the s and in the nikkei kuramochi added
back in the currency markets the weaker euro meant the dollar was up for a third day in the last four against a basket of top world currencies
