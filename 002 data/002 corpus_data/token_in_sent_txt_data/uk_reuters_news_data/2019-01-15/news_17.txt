exclusive-brazil's odebrecht offers debt-for-equity swap for atvos unit -sources
sao paulo reuters odebrecht sa has proposed that creditors take over its sugar and ethanol unit atvos agroindustrial participacoes sa in exchange for reducing odebrecht s huge debt load according to two sources with knowledge of the matter
the move is the latest sign of the radical way in which brazilian conglomerate odebrecht best known for its engineering and construction operations is remaking itself to renegotiate billion reais billion in consolidated debt
accused of bribing politicians and executives to get contracts throughout latin america odebrecht made a deal two years ago with brazilian and swiss authorities paying a record billion billion in fines to settle charges
atvos has about billion reais in debt with various lenders including banco do brasil sa caixa economica federal and development bank bndes as well as private banco bradesco sa itau unibanco holding sa and banco santander brasil sa
another creditor is investment management firm lone star funds one of the sources added
a swap would give atvos more time to recover without selling plants a potential alternative to paying off debt
both sources who requested anonymity because the talks are private said this week that a sale of atvos assets would not be enough to pay off all outstanding debt
the sources added that a final decision has not yet been made regarding a swap and that an agreement to transfer atvos ownership may not be reached
atvos is brazil s second largest ethanol company after raizen a joint venture of royal dutch shell and energy firm cosan
atvos net debt is equivalent to about times its annual earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation
by comparison debt for the sector s companies is double ebitda or less
in preliminary discussions with creditors odebrecht said it wanted lenders to swap most of their debt in atvos for control of the company but company odebrecht wants to keep a minority stake
the sizes of the stakes have yet to be determined the sources added
the largest chunk of atvos debt is held by banks mainly banco do brasil and bndes one source said
banco do brasil caixa economica federal and banco do brasil declined to comment on the matter
odebrecht itau bndes and lone star funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment
the ethanol company has crushing capacity of million tonnes of sugar cane per year but has been operating at a much lower level due to financial problems
in the crop atvos processed million tonnes according its annual report
odebrecht hired consultancy canaplan to assess how much debt atvos cash flow could handle and the firm will present a report to lenders about a new business plan
in november the conglomerate hired advisers to restructure a portion of its bank and bond debt
