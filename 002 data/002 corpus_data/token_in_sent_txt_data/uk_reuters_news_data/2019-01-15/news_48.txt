corrected-norway supreme court to hear snow crab case with implication for oil
corrects details of the origin of the legal case in and paragraphs by gwladys fouche oslo jan reuters norway s supreme court will on tuesday hear arguments on whether eu ships can fish for snow crab off arctic islands north of norway without permission from oslo a case that could decide who has the right to explore for oil in the region
at stake is whether the snow crab whose meat is considered a delicacy by gourmets in japan and south korea is a sedentary species living on the seabed or a fish stock that moves around and who gets to decide about it
if it is seen as a sedentary species then it is a resource belonging to the continental shelf of norway
if the eu can stake a claim over the snow crab then it could be harder for oslo to secure its claim over potential oil and gas resources
the question of the snow crab is a proxy for oil
because what is valid for the snow crab is valid for the oil industry oeystein jensen a senior research fellow in law at the fridtjof nansen institute in oslo told reuters
the issue arises out of a conviction for illegal fishing of an eu fishing vessel the senator in the waters off the svalbard archipelago
norway argued successfully in a lower court that the european commission does not have the right to issue fishing licences off svalbard over which it has sovereignty via a treaty
the ship s owner latvian fisherman peteris pildegovics is appealing to the supreme court that ruling and seeks to assert a right to fish for snow crab off svalbard
there was no need for a norwegian licence pildegovics told reuters
we followed the procedure
norwegian authorities were kept fully pildegovics estimated the loss of income due to the ship s ongoing seizure at about million euros a year
but norway says only it has the right to issue fishing licences for snow crab
the united nations convention on the law of the sea the constitution of the seas is clear on this
it is only norway as a coastal state that can give permission to fish on the norwegian continental shelf foreign minister ine eriksen soereide said in an april column
in a sign of the importance the case has for norway a panel of supreme court judges a higher than usual number will listen to the arguments during the session starting on tuesday
jensen the academic said that according to international law it is only coastal states that can grant licences for the management of natural resources
so norway via svalbard is the coastal state in charge he said
now the svalbard treaty forces norway to treat all signatories fairly
the eu does not have the right to issue licences but the treaty perhaps grants the eu the right to be equally treated
the eu by issuing their own licences has ignored these steps and ignored international law he said
