mexico expects faster fuel transportation to drain inventories
mexico city reuters mexico s freight transport association expects a contingency plan aimed at speeding up gasoline distribution that began over the weekend to help ease bottlenecks at terminals where fuel inventories have been accumulating in recent weeks
president andres manuel lopez obrador s crackdown on rampant fuel theft has caused long lines of angry motorists waiting to fill up their tanks since a handful of mexico s most important fuel pipelines were closed to avoid further losses
the switch to more road distribution has slowed down deliveries to gas stations as crowded fuel terminals owned by pemex s create bottlenecks with tanker ships waiting to discharge imports at several ports
the national chamber of freight transport expects faster truck loading direct deliveries and better security can increase fuel distribution by road to percent of the million barrels per day bpd of gasoline diesel and jet fuel mexico consumes compared with a current average of about percent
this is a contingency plan for using existing assets to achieve a larger capacity of fuel distribution said chamber president enrique gonzalez
transporters have asked pemex to speed up loading at terminals to a maximum of four hours from hours currently
before lopez obrador s push each truck would spend up to hours at pemex s distribution centers gonzalez said
the chamber represents companies with a combined fleet of fuel trucks capable of loading up to liters each
the contingency plan also contemplates direct delivery from terminals to gas stations without passing through pemex distribution centers
large convoys of gasoline trucks are now a common sight along mexican highways
the vehicles are given a military escort since lopez obrador moved thousands of soldiers and police to supervise and protect refining and distribution
mexico s central region including the capital has been most affected by the shortages since a key pipeline from pemex s salamanca refinery was shut in late december
some bpd of gasoline are lost due to theft according to reuters calculations based on official data
the problem caused a billion loss for pemex last year
lopez obrador s offensive against gasoline robbers marks his first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on
as of the number of tankers waiting to discharge imported fuel at mexican ports grew to compared with at the end of last week according to refinitiv eikon data
that represents a of about million barrels
gasoline imports which represent of the country s consumption typically dip in january due to lower demand but shipments so far this year have declined even more than usual as drawing down inventory is running slower
total gasoline imports fell to bpd in the first nine days of january down by a quarter versus the same period last year according to clipperdata
traders say the fall in imports is due to less purchases by pemex which is struggling to transport gasoline from congested ports and terminals but also by less private imports since fuel taxes were increased at the beginning of the year
