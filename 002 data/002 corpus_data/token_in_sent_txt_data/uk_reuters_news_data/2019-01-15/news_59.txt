china starts new recycling drive as foreign trash ban widens
shanghai reuters china plans to launch new recycling bases by the end of next year part of a campaign to make better use of its resources after extending a ban on foreign trash imports
a long manufacturing boom has saddled china with millions of tonnes of waste much of which is buried in sprawling landfill sites or dismantled by hand in polluting backstreet workshops
it has vowed to tackle the problem by creating fully industrialized recycling bases and cutting off foreign supplies
large volumes of solid waste are already impacting and restricting the development of the industrial economy the ministry of industry and information technology said in a policy document issued late last week
it said new comprehensive utilization bases would deal with bulk solid waste and another with industrial waste from sectors such as metals production coal mining construction agriculture and forestry
the bases will tackle waste with the biggest public impact the ministry said citing shared bicycles packaging batteries and solar panels as examples
they will also promote advanced technologies products and recycling methods it added
projects or companies approved to set up shop in one of these new bases can apply for special government funding and china will also make use of new financing mechanisms including green bonds the document added
china s recyclers have profited from waste shipped in from europe and the united states which is better sorted and therefore cheaper to treat than domestic material
imports reached million tonnes a year at their peak but the government has been steadily blocking shipments since
the initial ban on types of imported waste including plastic and paper was extended at the end of to new products including scrap ships and automobile parts
it said in december that it would also ban imports of more varieties of scrap steel copper and aluminum from july and another products including scrap stainless steel and titanium will be blocked at the end of the year
total solid waste imports fell percent on the year in and china eventually aims to block all imports that have readily available domestic replacements
many domestic recyclers have tried to move their facilities to southeast asia despite tougher restrictions in malaysia and elsewhere and while some have started to switch to domestic feedstock china still needs to do more to standardize and scale up the treatment of local waste
some items just can t be imported anymore including plastics but domestic waste and imports are handled by different people and they are not part of the same system said wang wang secretary general of the china scrap plastic association
