column-china's trade data weak? not if you look at commodities: russell
launceston australia reuters anybody reading the commentary on china s december trade figures would be left with the impression of an economy increasingly losing momentum amid a dispute with the united states
it was reasonable for analysts to zero in on the percent drop in china s december exports from a year earlier a huge miss when a rise of percent had been forecast
imports also surprised on the downside dropping percent in december the biggest decline since july
the numbers do point to weakness in the world s economy and the trade dispute with the administration of president donald trump is getting much of the blame
the weakness in exports could be put down to the effect in prior months as both producers and buyers stocked up ahead of the imposition of tariffs on a range of chinese goods
the poor trade numbers also came despite efforts by beijing to stimulate the economy in a series of measures from looser credit to tax cuts to infrastructure spending
the trade data was grist to the mill for those taking the view that china s economy is struggling that the united states is winning the trade dispute and that beijing will be forced to compromise on trump s terms
this may well turn out to be the case but there are also trade numbers that paint an entirely different view of the chinese economy namely the volume of commodity imports
crude oil imports surged nearly percent in december from the same month in reaching million barrels per day bpd the monthly outcome on record
that hardly sounds like a weak outcome even if the likely explanation is that smaller independent refiners boosted purchases to use up import quotas before they expired
overall china s crude imports rose by percent to a record million bpd an increase of bpd over
boosting annual crude imports by the equivalent of the total consumption of a country such as netherlands can not be construed as weak either
a history lesson on crude imports though doesn t say much about what s likely to happen in but so far there is little reason to expect the imports to tail off
china is still building its strategic petroleum reserves and the sharp drop in crude prices in the previous months is likely to encourage more buying for storage
it s not just crude oil
imports of natural gas by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas lng hit a record high of million tonnes in december up percent from the same month of and eclipsing the previous record high from november
that means china has imported record amounts of natural gas for two consecutive months again hard numbers that don t quite tally with the view of an economy in distress
it could be the case that energy imports are staying strong while those of metals which are more exposed to weakness in manufacturing are feeling more pain
imports of unwrought copper dropped to tonnes in december down percent from the same month in and by the same margin from november
imports in november were also weaker than in the same month in indicating some softness toward the end of the year notwithstanding the strong percent gain in copper imports for as a whole
iron ore imports also look uninspiring with december s million tonnes up percent from the same month a year earlier but not enough to prevent a percent drop across as a whole the first annual decline since
however china s steel output is likely to hit a record high in with output for the first months rising percent to million tonnes from the same period in
what this shows is that china s switch to iron ore in order to maximise the output of blast furnaces meant steel mills were able to boost production without having to import more iron again this is hardly a weak outcome but likewise doesn t shed much light on the probable trends for
coal was one commodity that looked weak in december with imports plunging percent from the same month in to just million tonnes
but this was entirely policy driven with beijing putting pressure on traders to curb imports as they didn t want total inbound coal shipments in to exceed those for
despite the slump in december imports for the full year were up percent to million tonnes a high
coal imports may remain restrained in the early months of amid an official push to use more domestic coal to boost prices for local miners
overall if you were to assess the chinese economy on its commodity imports you d likely reach quite a different conclusion than if you focused only on the dollar value of total exports and imports
weaker commodity prices lowered the value of imports in the latter part of but if anything also served to boost volumes
china s economy does appear to be losing some growth momentum but it doesn t seem to make much sense to look only at imports and exports from a dollar perspective and not take volumes into account
