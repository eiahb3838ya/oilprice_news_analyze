pg&e plunges for second day after step toward bankruptcy
jan reuters shares in california power company pg e fell sharply for a second day on tuesday as investors took fright at the prospect of bankruptcy proceedings to protect from billion in potential liabilities related to wildfires in and
the state s biggest private utility s shares have lost percent of their stock value since the start of january when the company first began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for the fires
shares lost percent of their value on monday after the company said it was preparing to file for chapter protection and they were down another percent in morning trade in new york
california politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state s largest private utility to fail
governor gavin newsom a democrat told reporters late on monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping pg e stay solvent but no decisions had been made
pg e said on tuesday that rothschild inc banker roger kimmel had resigned from the company s board adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations
rothschild did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment while pg e declined to comment
pg e which provides electricity and natural gas to million customers in northern and central california faces widespread litigation government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed billion due to the fires
its chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane california legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires
the doctrine known as inverse condemnation exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence as long as their equipment is involved
that legal rule could keep pg e exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter
still analysts from brokerage morningstar said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value
the most likely scenario is a accounting charge that cuts pg e s book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure they said
our new fair value estimate for pg e is per share after considering possible bankruptcy it was trading at around half an hour after opening on wall street
