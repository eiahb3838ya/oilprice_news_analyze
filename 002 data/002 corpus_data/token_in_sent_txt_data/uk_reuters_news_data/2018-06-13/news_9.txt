update 5-trump, iran spar over oil prices ahead of opec meeting
reuters president donald trump and iran exchanged sharp words over oil prices on wednesday with trump blaming opec for high oil prices and tehran accusing him of stoking volatility after he withdrew last month from a global nuclear arms deal with iran
trump sparked the latest when he renewed his attack on opec in a tweet that said oil prices are too high and that the cartel was at it oil prices have risen around percent over the last year after the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and some producers including russia started reducing supplies in
the cartel meets june in vienna and producers are seen as likely to raise production perhaps before the limits are due to sunset at
iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili fired back at trump in a statement to reuters
you can not place sanctions on two opec founder members and still blame opec for oil price volatility he said referring to his country and venezuela
this is business president we thought you knew the oil supply deal is set to continue through the end of but plans for its continuation were unclear
the calculus changed after trump announced in may that washington was pulling out of the deal that restricted iran s nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions
the move has pressured european and asian clients to stop importing iranian oil or doing business with the country
saudi arabia iran s rival and opec s largest producer and russia the world s largest producer and a party to the deal have already increased supply
saudi arabia supported trump s decision to exit the iran nuclear agreement
i think the trump tweet makes the saudis job of getting compromise at the opec meeting tougher said joe mcmonigle senior energy policy analyst at hedgeye potomac research in washington
saudi production rose to million barrels per day bpd in may in line with deal quotas according to opec data
russia s production was million barrels a day in the beginning of june exceeding its quota according to sources familiar with the matter
the price of brent crude peaked in may at a barrel then pulled back trading on wednesday near at barrel partly in anticipation that the deal may end
crude traded wednesday near a barrel
oil prices are too high opec is at it again
not good trump wrote in his post on twitter after last raising the issue in april
the potential for opec to boost production has raised concerns about the cartel s limited spare capacity which could fall to as low as million bpd
this would make it harder to respond to a supply shock such as in venezuela where output has declined to a due to an economic crisis
opec has the lowest spare capacity ever right now said fund manager pierre andurand in a tweeted response to trump
there is going to be a real issue he wrote predicting prices above per barrel within two years
in the united states gasoline pump prices nationwide have risen to near a gallon during the peak summer travel season still less than the a gallon during the great recession
gasoline demand has remained strong rising to an estimated million bpd as of last week according to energy department data
trump sent his tweet hours after returning to washington from a summit with north korean leader kim jong un in singapore
separately a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the house of representatives was pushing legislation that would subject opec to antitrust law and fight what the group called artificial production controls
the measure would have to pass the full house and the senate before trump could sign it into law
past presidents have not supported similar bills when they have been proposed
