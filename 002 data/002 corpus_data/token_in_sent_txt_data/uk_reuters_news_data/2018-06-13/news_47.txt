global oil demand to grow steadily in 2019 but trade risks loom-iea
london june reuters oil demand will grow steadily in thanks to a solid global economy and stable prices although trade tensions remain the largest risk the international energy agency said on wednesday
the iea said it expects global oil demand to grow by million barrels per day next year to top million bpd by the second quarter of the year
the agency expects demand to grow at the same rate this year unchanged from its last report in may
a solid economic background and an assumption of more stable prices are key factors
risks include possibly higher prices and trade disruptions
some governments are considering measures to ease price pressures on consumers the agency said in its monthly report
there is the possibility of a downward revision to our economic assumptions in the next few months
the world economy is feeling some pain from higher oil the oil price has risen by a third to around a barrel close to its highest since late since opec and other producers including russia began cutting production in january by million bpd
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets later this month to discuss its supply policy particularly in light of protracted declines in venezuela and the prospect of new sanctions on iran later this year
the group together with its partners may consider raising output to compensate for any supply shortfalls
if the other opec members were to continue pumping at the same rate as may a potential supply gap could emerge and lead to a draw on stocks of more than million bpd in the fourth quarter of the report said
supply from outside opec is expected to grow by million bpd this year led predominantly by the united states before easing to around million bpd next year the iea said
