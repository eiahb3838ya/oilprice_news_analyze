austria's energy regulator says climate protection goals hard to reach
vienna reuters austria may find it tough to achieve its goal of producing as much energy from renewable resources as it consumes by due to public opposition to new dams and other projects that disturb nature the head of energy regulator said
the target is part of a climate and energy strategy which the coalition government s conservative and parties adopted last month
the goal is in line with the alpine country s commitment to the paris climate accords
austria already generates about percent of its annual energy consumption of terawatt hours twh from renewables thanks to its many rivers and lakes
the country covering square km has about large hydropower plants
but adding more dams would require inundating an even larger area with water which could spark protests
the real problem is the resistance andreas eigenbauer told reuters
by austria aims to generate the amount of energy it consumes each year from renewables although it still expects to need fossil fuels to meet peak demand but allowing it to export or storage excess levels
that is visionary eigenbauer said of the target
you need a drastic change in support in the population to reach that goal
if you do not get it then it gets really eigenbauer said austria would have to generate around twh from hydro solar and wind power by to reach the target around twh more than now
he said the plan was to increase output equally from each of the three resources
as well as the challenge of building new dams he said adding enough wind parks would be tough due to lack of space
the only available area big enough was in forests which cover nearly half of the country s land area
but in this area as well resistance is mounting he said even when wind turbine rotors rise above the tree level
eigenbauer said there was potential to develop solar power on residential buildings adding that more family homes had photovoltaic installations and major property developers were installing more solar equipment
the government s solar target was reachable he said
but for further expansion dedicated solar plants would be needed and these were also unpopular he added
