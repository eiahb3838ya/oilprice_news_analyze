refile-update 2-iraq's sadr and amiri set to lead talks on new government
fixes typo in paragraph powerful shi ite alliance sadr and iran cautious cleric with erratic past by ahmed aboulenein baghdad june reuters iraqi nationalist cleric moqtada and militia chief hadi were set on wednesday to lead talks to form a government in baghdad after announcing an alliance of their political blocs
sadr and amiri s groupings won first and second place respectively in may s election which has been beset by allegations of fraud and raised fears of bloodshed among shi ite paramilitary groups
they announced the alliance in the shi ite holy city of najaf an apparent attempt to project unity among leaders of the muslim sect that has dominated since the fall of saddam hussein
a week ago an explosion killed at least people and wounded more than in sadr s baghdad stronghold of sadr city district in what the interior ministry called a terrorist aggression on civilians
state television reported on wednesday that the supreme judicial council had issued arrest warrants for people in connection with the blast
the pact could ease fears of violence which some have said could even spiral into ite civil war
amiri widely described as tehran s man in iraq is one of the most powerful figures in the country
iraq a key ally of the united states and major oil producer has heavily armed mostly shi ite paramilitary fighters operating alongside state forces some of them more loyal to their commanders and iran than to the iraqi state
both sadr and iran seem to be taking a pragmatic approach as iran seeks to maintain its deep influence in its most important arab ally at a time when its wider middle east interests are under threat
not only has president donald trump pulled out of a global nuclear deal with tehran and then embraced north korea increasing iran s isolation tehran s allies in yemen are also facing a major offensive from a coalition that could mark a turning point in the war
sadr who led violent campaigns against the occupation that ended in has emerged as a nationalist opponent of powerful shi ite parties allied with neighbouring iran and as a champion of the poor
tehran has skilfully manipulated iraqi politics in the past and the cleric has to tread carefully
but sadr who derives much of his legitimacy from his revered father grand ayatollah muhammad sadiq sadr assassinated in by saddam s agents is a formidable and unpredictable operator
he also has street power with a track record of mobilising tens of thousands of supporters to protest against opponents and government policies
in the election vice president ayad allawi s group won the largest number of seats albeit with a narrow margin but he was prevented from becoming prime minister
he blamed tehran which manoeuvred nuri into power and sadr helped to form a national unity government
during the american occupation tehran was accused of arming sadr s mehdi army militia with sophisticated bombs used in attacks on coalition forces
tehran has accommodated him in the past he went into exile in iran in
