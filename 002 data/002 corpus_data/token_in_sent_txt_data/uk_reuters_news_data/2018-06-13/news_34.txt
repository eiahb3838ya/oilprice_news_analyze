update 2-finland cuts stake in biofuel firm neste with $1 bln deal
helsinki reuters finland s government sold a stake of percent in oil refiner and biofuel company neste on wednesday for million euros billion prompting criticism from the opposition that it gives up too much control of company
as a result of the sale the state s stake fell to percent
the government said it wanted to capitalize on the stock s recent strong performance while still holding a strong grip on the company
the state will continue to be a significant shareholder of the company which will among other things ensure the strategic interest relating to the ownership minister of economic affairs mika lintila said in a statement
the sale price was euros per share compared with tuesday s closing price of euros
the stock fell to euros on wednesday by gmt
it is still up about percent from a year earlier
neste has benefited from its profitable biofuel business which has plants in singapore and rotterdam and is looking to expand its capacity
it also has two conventional refineries in finland
the acting head of the state ownership department jarmo vaisanen told reuters that there were no plans at the moment to cut the stake further
last year the government pushed through a law that gives it a mandate to cut the state s previously controlling stake in neste to a minimum of percent prompting strike threats from the company s employees
is a sensitive subject in finland where many think the government should do more to protect finnish jobs
the logic of the sale is rather confusing
there is really no need to sell the shares and lose common ownership they could instead borrow cheap money said lawmaker sirpa paatero from the opposition social democrats told reuters
