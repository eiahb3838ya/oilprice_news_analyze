update 3-sadr-amiri alliance lowers iraq's political temperature
baghdad reuters cleric moqtada and militia chief hadi s decision to choose compromise over confrontation and strike an alliance aiming to form the next iraqi government has eased tensions after elections marred by fraud allegations
sadr s bloc scored a stunning victory in the may parliamentary election by tapping growing public discontent with neighbouring iran s sway in iraq and promising to deliver what past governments have not jobs better services and stability
but beneath the surface there were fears that regional power tehran which before the vote said it would never let sadr govern would sabotage the mercurial cleric and set the stage for a showdown that could turn bloody
in the end an alliance has emerged of strange sadr who portrays himself as a nationalist and amiri iran s most powerful ally in iraq whose grouping came second
their choice of pragmatism has lowered the risk of violence among iraq s shi ite majority after a costly conflict war with the sunni muslim militants of islamic state
sadr is treading cautiously aware that iran has manipulated iraqi politics in its favour in the past and of tehran s vast sway in its most important arab ally
in a election vice president ayad allawi s bloc won the most seats but he was prevented from becoming prime minister blaming iranian manoeuvring
if he sadr insisted on fighting everyone at the same time he would be outmanoeuvred and the pressure of a of the elections was too much said a western diplomat in baghdad
tehran which has thrived amid iraqi shi ite rivalries in the past by acting as a broker has its own motivations
sadr s alliance with amiri announced in the holy shi ite city of najaf to project a sense of unity gives tehran more leverage over the formation of iraq s next government
amiri who spent two decades fighting iraqi dictator saddam hussein from iran and speaks farsi fluently is one of the most powerful figures in iraq
his badr organisation controls the interior ministry and he played a decisive role in the battle against islamic state
amiri had the momentum behind him especially in this election this is an opportunity for him said hassan hassan senior fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy
he is fresh off the field very popular in some amiri is close to major general qassem soleimani commander of foreign operations for iran s revolutionary guards who has great influence in iraq
soleimani was in iraq this week a second western diplomat in baghdad said adding that it is likely that he advised amiri to ally with sadr who recently met iran s ambassador
the iranians have decided they must accept sadr the diplomat said and he will have in turn realised he must work with amiri to safeguard his victory
shunning amiri could make life difficult for sadr
his foe former prime minister nuri is still in the picture despite being forced out of office and widely blamed for islamic state s seizure of a third of iraq
in maliki ordered a crackdown on forces loyal to sadr in the shi ite heartland
according to the first diplomat who recently met sadr he felt pressured and feared his victory was going to vanish
acting on what prime minister haider said were widespread violations a parliament stacked with lawmakers who failed to retain their seats mandated a nationwide recount
some politicians said the election should be repeated
abadi seemed to lose the most out of the alliance diplomats and analysts said
even though he has balanced the interests of iran and the united states who compete for influence in iraq his bloc has yet to join any coalition
he may yet win a second term as a compromise candidate albeit as a much weaker premier beholden to sadr and amiri
iran does not seem worried about the uncertainty but is under growing pressure to preserve its interests in the middle east especially in iraq
president donald trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with tehran then engaged nuclear state north korea increasing tehran s isolation
in yemen houthi forces aligned with iran face the biggest offensive from a coalition in the conflict part of a regional proxy war between riyadh and tehran
there is a certain element of pragmatism in iran on foreign policy said renad mansour research fellow at chatham house in london
iran does not want iraq to collapse but it also does not want iraq to be too strong
they want a middle even if sadr s deal with amiri succeeds he may have to contend with grievances from members of his own bloc who insist tehran would not be allowed to interfere in iraqi affairs
