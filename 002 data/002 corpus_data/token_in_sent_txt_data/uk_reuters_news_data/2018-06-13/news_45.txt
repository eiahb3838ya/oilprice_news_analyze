stake sale would be for investment in petrochemical products maximum sale of pct shares foreigners allowed up to pct stake sale switched to public auction instead of strategic sale adds details ceo quotes by mai nguyen and khanh vu hanoi june reuters vietnam s binh son refining and petrochemical will offload a further percent stake and not limit the sale to only strategic investors as previously planned in order to attract more buyers its chief executive said
the sale is expected to take place via a public auction ahead of binh son s possible listing in april next year ceo tran ngoc nguyen told reuters adding proceeds will be used for investment in petrochemicals products
in an ipo earlier this year the vietnamese government raised million by selling a percent stake in binh son the operator of the dung quat oil refinery
at the time binh son had said it would sell a further percent stake to strategic investors including domestic and foreign investors
but the refinery operator has so far failed to find a strategic investor ceo nguyen said
the timing is too short for strategic investors to decide to invest in such a big stake he added
bsr also hopes to ease requirements such as time and minimum registered capital for the planned sale nguyen said adding he expected the government to approve the change in order to help speed up the process
vietnam has been privatising hundreds of enterprises in order to boost their performance relax a tight state budget and reform an economy that is highly reliant on foreign investments
binh son s foreign ownership is capped at percent
it is currently percent owned by foreigners indicating overseas buyers may take up to percent in the upcoming sale
shares of the company have been trading on the unlisted public company market or upcom since march and nguyen expects the shares to be listed on the ho chi minh stock exchange the country s main bourse by april next year
binh son expects to rake in a net profit of trillion dong million in the first half of this year or about percent of its target it said in a statement
the company will use retained profits as well as loans to fund a planned upgrade of its dung quat refinery
dung quat vietnam s first refinery that began operations in was initially designed to process light sweet crude oil mostly sourced from the bach ho field offshore vietnam
the upgrade will enable the plant to process sour crude oil as well nguyen said and will also allow it to produce more petrochemical products
binh son will select an engineering procurement and construction contractor for the upgrade next year
nguyen said seven companies had registered to bid for the contract but declined to name them
