italy top court rejects appeal to stymie shell, eni corruption trial
rome june reuters italy s supreme court threw out an appeal from shell and four former shell managers to stymie a trial on alleged corruption in nigeria which also sees eni s chief on the bench legal sources said on wednesday
the graft case revolves around the purchase by eni and shell of nigeria s offshore oilfield for about billion
the trial kicked off last month with the next hearing set for june
the appeal was aimed at reversing the trial to the preliminary hearing stage due to what it said were procedural errors but the court decided the appeal was inadmissible
nine current and former executives or contractors including eni chief executive claudio descalzi have been accused by italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the licence to explore
the field holds an estimated billion barrels of oil but has never entered production
all deny wrongdoing as do shell and eni
if found guilty those on trial could face jail
a shell spokeswoman said on wednesday based on our review of the prosecutor of milan s file and all of the information and facts available to us we do not believe that there is a basis to convict shell or any of its former as a rule the supreme court does not comment on its decisions
