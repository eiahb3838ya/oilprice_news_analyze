coal comeback spurs new carbon emissions growth, says bp
london reuters global greenhouse gas emissions began rising again last year as the first in coal burning since overshadowed a record expansion in renewable energy a bp report said
energy demand accelerated in by percent but a percent gain in clean power such as solar and wind did little to offset the dominance of fossil fuels in the rapidly expanding global economy
demand for hydrocarbons rose across the board led by a percent increase in natural gas consumption the fastest since followed by a percent rise in oil demand which far exceeded the average of the previous years data in bp s benchmark annual statistical review of world energy showed
graphic global gdp and energy growth graphic energy fuel mix the opening of new power plants in india and china drove coal consumption higher by percent highlighting the difficulties developing economies face in meeting demand for electricity while fighting pollution
bp and other oil companies such as royal dutch shell have led calls to reduce carbon emissions by converting coal power plants to cleaner natural gas
still the share of coal in power generation today remains around percent practically unchanged since while the share of fuels slightly dipped as nuclear power capacity shrunk bp chief economist spencer dale said
the power sector absorbs more than percent of primary energy and accounts for over a third of carbon emissions
this is really worrying dale told reporters in a briefing before the report was released
how much progress have we made in years
graphic fuel shares in power carbon emissions grew last year by percent compared with little to no growth in the previous three years but still lower than average growth of percent in the years to
a landmark climate agreement reached in paris in calls for halving carbon emissions by and reducing them to net zero by the end of the century to limit global warming
three years of flat growth was a step in the right direction but it wasn t a big enough step dale said
steady and robust growth in oil demand over the past five years the strongest since was driven by lower crude prices but could be undercut by the recent rally that took prices to their highest since dale said
there are some signs that the boost from low oil prices may be beginning to wane he added
graphic oil demand on the supply side the surge in production of shale oil also known has tight oil has redrawn the global market
the united states overtook saudi arabia in to become the world s second biggest producer behind russia
a agreement between opec russia and other major oil producers to reduce global output by million barrels per day bpd combined with a sharp fall in venezuela s output drove down global inventories to their average bp said
but a million bpd growth in oil and natural gas liquids since october offset a large part of the cuts
opec has always had the power to stabilise the market in response to fluctuations dale said
opec has never had the power to try to offset structural shocks to the market such as the emergence of new sources of supply and the growth of electric the rapid response of tight oil just reinforces that rising exports of crude and new refineries in asia and the middle east have also led to a surge in global oil trading which grew by more than percent last year compared to a average of percent dale said
