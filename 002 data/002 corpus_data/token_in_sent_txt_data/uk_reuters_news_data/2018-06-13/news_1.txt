update 3-french farmers wind down fuel blockades after government gesture
paris reuters french farmers began lifting a blockade of refineries and fuel depots on wednesday after unions made progress in talks with the government over competition from cheaper imports including palm oil
the protests which blocked sites in france and led to some petrol stations running dry were triggered by france s decision to allow oil and gas major total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant a cheaper alternative to biodiesel made from locally produced oilseed crops
that soured relations between the european union s biggest farm sector and the government of president emmanuel macron
negotiations between the fnsea union that called the protest and french agriculture minister stephane travert to resolve the dispute progressed on wednesday after he sent the union a draft letter in the morning responding to some of their demands
we have made breakthroughs and many meetings are lined up with the minister
we re going to ask our members to suspend with immediate effect their blockade of the different sites jeremy decerle leader of the fnsea s young farmers section told reporters
travert called on total to increase the share of locally grown rapeseed it would use as a feedstock at its la mede biofuel refinery on the south coast although he reiterated the government s refusal to go back on the palm oil authorisation
total has already committed to use less than tonnes of crude palm oil per year at its la mede biofuel refinery out of a total processing capacity of tonnes and to use tonnes of locally grown rapeseed
we would like total to go beyond these tonnes travert told reporters
what we are asking the total group to do is to work with the rapeseed sector to develop supply total chief executive patrick pouyanne is due to meet president macron later this week
junior ecology minister sebastien lecornu has also proposed france call for the eu to cap and progressively cut palm oil imports
however fnsea chief christiane lambert who had initially refused to end the blockades after talks on tuesday warned farmers wanted to see progress on a range of issues including red tape and taxes
we re calling a suspension because we re talking about issues that can t be resolved in the blink of an eye she told the news conference
if we don t have meetings in the coming weeks over the points that need resolving we will come total said it expected the blockade which had started on sunday to be over by thursday
the group s french refineries were not impacted by the protests but of its petrol stations across the country saw fuel outages a spokesman said
