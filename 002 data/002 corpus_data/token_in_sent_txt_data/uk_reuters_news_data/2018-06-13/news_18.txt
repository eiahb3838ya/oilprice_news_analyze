iran, other dissenters complicate opec oil output boost -sources
reuters at least three opec members disagree with saudi arabia and russia on the need to pump more oil opec sources said complicating any official decision to boost supply just as consuming nations are warning of a shortage
in attempt to bridge differences opec and its allies are looking at a number of options around pumping more oil including a token increase and delaying the start of any production boost opec delegates say
after almost months of an opec and deal to cut production saudi arabia and russia have said they are prepared to pump more to calm consumer worries about supply and prices which hit a barrel the highest since
but iran the of saudi arabia plus venezuela iraq and smaller producers in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries disagree
producers meet on june to set policy
the disagreement has revived memories of a meeting that former saudi oil minister ali called one of the group s worst ever talks collapsed when a majority of members refused to endorse a saudi push to pump more
saudi arabia in the end unilaterally raised output
those against an increase this time are concerned it would threaten the unity of the alliance involved in the deal and say forecasts from opec and others calling for higher demand in the second half of are too optimistic
changing the decision is very complicated an opec source said
iran iraq and venezuela and some more countries are going to push for keeping the ceiling for opec in place until the end of the source did not say which other countries oppose pumping more
another source thought a supply boost will be agreed eventually but a modest one
i believe there will be a marginal increase a second opec source said adding it would have to be gradual well calculated and for its impact on the market to be consumers say more oil is needed
president donald trump renewed his attack on opec on wednesday and the international energy agency said the world may face a supply gap by late if opec can not cover any shortfalls
russian president vladimir putin plans to meet saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman when he visits russia for the opening of the soccer world cup and the two would discuss the oil deal the kremlin said on wednesday
venezuela s output has collapsed due to economic crisis and could fall further due to sanctions while iran is facing a cut in exports after the quit a nuclear deal with tehran
those who oppose the increase are the ones who will not gain a second opec source said
they will lose when prices go down because they will not be able to increase production and will get less gulf producers saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the main opec members holding sufficient unused oil production capacity to boost output quickly to offset a shortage
sources close to the matter said a number of options are being looked at including an increase of around million barrels per day and should prices fall making no decision
arab oil ministers who met in kuwait earlier this month agreed that if there is a decline in prices toward the then opec would keep the deal in place until its next meeting in november two sources familiar with the matter said
another scenario being discussed is for producers to ease the level of cutbacks to percent of the agreed level from around percent now to fill any supply gap from venezuela and iran should oil get close to the sources said
in a further effort toward building consensus the amount of any increase would be distributed among all even though only three or four producers actually have the capacity to increase output one of the sources familiar with the matter said
and a fifth opec source said that if opec decided next week to raise output it would not be with immediate effect and would be gradual suggesting supply would not rise for three to four months after a june decision
