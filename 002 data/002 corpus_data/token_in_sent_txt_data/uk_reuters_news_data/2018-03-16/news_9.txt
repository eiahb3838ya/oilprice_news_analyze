venezuela begins power rationing as drought causes severe outages
san cristobal venezuela reuters venezuela imposed electricity rationing this week in six western states as the country s creaky power grid suffered from a drought that has reduced water levels in key reservoirs needed to run hydroelectric power generators
the formal outages began on thursday
but many residents scoffed at the announcement wryly noting that they have been suffering far more extended blackouts during the last week
we have spent hours without electricity today
and yesterday electricity came and went for six hours we had no power said ligthia marrero in the western state of san cristobal noting that her fridge had been damaged by the frequent interruptions
crumbling infrastructure and lack of investments have hit venezuela s power supply for years
now the situation has been exacerbated by dwindling rains
in the western cities business has all but ground to a halt at a time when the opec nation of million is already suffering hyperinflation and a profound recession
many venezuelans are unable to eat properly on salaries of just a couple of dollars per month at the black market rate sparking malnutrition emigration and frequent sights of venezuelans digging through trash or begging in front of supermarkets
maybelin mendoza a cashier at a bakery in tachira state said business has been further hit because points of sale stop working during blackouts just as venezuelans are chronically short of cash due to hyperinflation
in the most dramatic cases the opposition governor of tachira state said three people including a died this week because they failed to receive assistance during a power outage
because of electrical failures the machines weren t able to revive the people and they died said laidy gomez
reuters was unable to confirm the report
authorities have acknowledged that interruptions will continue for at least two weeks but they have not said whether they will spread to other states
of a possible megawatts we are only generating right now energy minister luis motta told reporters referring to the fabricio ojeda dam in the western andean state of merida
capital city caracas and other major cities have not been hit by rationing yet
two years ago rationing there lasted five months when a drought hit the guri dam the country s largest hydroelectric dam
but because of the economic crisis venezuela has reduced electricity consumption to about megawatts at peak hours according to engineer and former electricity executive miguel lara
two years ago corpoelec put the figure at megawatts
