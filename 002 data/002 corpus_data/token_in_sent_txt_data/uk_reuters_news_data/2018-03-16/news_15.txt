u.s. has "very good" talks with europeans on iran ultimatum
vienna march reuters the united states and three european allies have had very good talks on president donald trump s demand that their nuclear deal with iran be improved by a may deadline a envoy said on friday
trump has threatened to withdraw the united states from the accord between tehran and six world powers signed in before he took office unless france britain and germany help agree a pact by that date

what the president has asked us to do is to work with our european allies and see if we can come to an agreement before may and we don t have any instructions beyond may hook said at a news conference three days after trump fired secretary of state rex tillerson

what the president said on is that we much reach a supplemental agreement with the european allies in three specific areas he said
this is the third meeting that we have had with the we had very good discussions
there is a lot that we agree on and where we disagree we are working to bridge our differences hook said adding we are taking things one week at a asked if tillerson s sacking had affected the negotiations he told reporters it hasn t affected the talks at all
