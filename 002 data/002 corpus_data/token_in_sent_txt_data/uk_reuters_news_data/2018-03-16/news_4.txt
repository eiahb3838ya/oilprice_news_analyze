update 2-sunpower seeks tariff waiver, cites plan for u.s. expansion
reuters sunpower corp on friday asked the trump administration to exempt a segment of its solar panel imports from new tariffs saying the move would allow it to reverse proposed investment cuts and ease plans to expand panel manufacturing
the request by sunpower which is majority owned by france s total sa marks the first attempt by a major solar company to sidestep a controversial percent levy on imported panels announced by president donald trump in january
trump had said the tariff would boost manufacturing but many in the industry have warned of higher costs and thousands of layoffs in the installation end of the solar industry
we understand the administration s goals sunpower chief executive tom werner said in an interview
we think we can contribute positively to those the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment
it could not determined which other companies had filed such requests with the trade representative by the deadline on friday
sunpower s request covers only its imported premium panels and not the less efficient and cheaper panels which dominate the market werner said
san jose sunpower manufactures most of its panels in the philippines and mexico
werner said an exemption would allow sunpower to materially reverse a decision made immediately after the tariff announcement in january to cancel a million investment in its cell technology that would have created hundreds of jobs in california and texas
sunpower last month said the tariff would force it to cut to jobs
the cheaper panels could be made at a new facility that the company would build probably in the southwest werner said noting that sunpower was in the process of narrowing down its options to two locations
this is not hypothetical
we re ready to make this happen he said adding that an exemption for premium panel imports would facilitate this plan
a big investment in solar panel manufacturing as a result of the tariff would mark a win for the trump administration but so far the industry remains focused on the fate of the installation business which employs tens of thousands of people
only china s jinkosolar has said it plans to build a manufacturing facility and solarworld one of the panel producers behind the trade case that resulted in the tariffs has said it will hire employees this year
suniva the bankrupt company that first petitioned the administration in april to impose tariffs has not publicly outlined its plans
the exemption request will undergo a comment period before the trade representative makes a decision
