sugar glut pushes brazil mills into ethanol, white sugar, washouts
ribeirão preto brazil march reuters brazilian mills are doing everything they can to keep raw sugar off the global market as brazil s cane harvest kicks off to avoid worsening a glut that has driven prices to their lowest in two years
with the benchmark raw sugar contract trading below cents per pound in new york and production costs in brazil s varying from cents to cents directors of sugar companies are weighing bold moves to avoid negative profit margins
we have to cut the supply of sugar to help reduce the global surplus said hugo cagno a partner along with french sugar group tereos in the vertente mill in the town of guaraci deep in brazil s main cane belt in the state of sao paulo
this week datagro analysts said they expect brazilian producers to cut sugar volumes in the crop area to million tonnes from million tonnes a year ago
the obvious move for those who are able is turning as much cane as possible into ethanol since domestic prices and demand for the biofuel are strong paying the equivalent of a raw sugar price around cents per pound mill owners said
others with access to capital are looking to stock and carry the unsold sugar until prices rise possibly in the period at the start of next year
another strategy is to increase production of white sugar to sell domestically to food and drink companies such as pepsico inc nestle sa and ambev sa
in some cases producers have been so desperate to avoid sugar sales that they have negotiated washouts canceling export contracts for the sweetener
luiz gustavo junqueira figueiredo commercial director at the alta mogiana mill says washouts are not widespread but rather a last resort for mills that entered contracts without price protection
alta mogiana has not done any
stock and carry is a more interesting strategy if you have the capital to build or rent storage capacity he told reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference this week in ribeirão preto where millers discussed prospects for the new cane crop starting officially in april
bernardo biagi owner of two mills crushing around million tonnes of cane annually in the ribeirão preto area says he has started processing at one of his mills but only ethanol so far
we had cane left in the field from last year so we are processing that for now but only for fuel
we haven t started with sugar yet he said
he projects he will produce tonnes of sugar in the new crop compared with tonnes last season with ethanol production is likely rising to million liters from million liters a year earlier he said
