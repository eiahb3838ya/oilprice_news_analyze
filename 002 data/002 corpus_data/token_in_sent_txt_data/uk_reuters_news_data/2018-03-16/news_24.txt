sunpower likely to expand u.s. manufacturing as tariffs weigh
march reuters sunpower corp on friday said it was strongly considering expanding its solar panel manufacturing in the united states as it grapples with the trump administration s tariffs on solar imports
the news came as the company filed a request to exempt some of its panels from the new percent tariffs
in the filing sunpower argued that its highly efficient solar panels can not be compared with the more conventional models that dominate the market
in an interview chief executive tom werner said it was not seeking an exemption for its less efficient and expensive panels and would likely set up a new manufacturing plant for that product
an exclusion of its other products from the tariffs just makes it far easier to make that investment werner said
