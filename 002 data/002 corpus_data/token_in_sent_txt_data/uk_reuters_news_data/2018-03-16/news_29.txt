venezuela election candidate falcon is maduro's pawn - oas head
madrid reuters venezuelan president nicolas maduro is using his main election rival henri falcon as an instrument to divide the country s opposition ahead of a may vote the head of the organisation of american states oas said on friday
falcon an governor and former ally of maduro s predecessor hugo chavez defied an opposition boycott of the presidential election to run despite conditions critics say are rigged to ensure the ruling socialists retain control
we all knew that henri falcon would be an instrument of the venezuelan government to divide the opposition and his candidacy ends up proving it luis almagro the secretary general of the oas told an event in madrid

we asked the venezuelan opposition to sort the wheat from the chaff and henri falcon is the chaff that has separated alone he added in comments to reuters at the casa de america cultural centre
almagro reiterated his calls for harsher sanctions against venezuela s dictatorship
he said last month sanctions should be targeted against venezuela s oil sector to intensify financial pressure on maduro s government which has presided over five years of crippling recession
venezuela s main opposition coalition has rebuked falcon for legitimising an election they deem a farce as maduro s most popular rivals are barred from standing and the election board favours the government
maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the oas a pawn of policy
falcon broke with the socialists in and is now promising a national unity government
while most analysts give him little chance some recent polls actually put him ahead of maduro in voter preferences
falcon has said the opposition s boycott is ineffective and will only give maduro an uncontested win arguing that percent of venezuelans wanted change
