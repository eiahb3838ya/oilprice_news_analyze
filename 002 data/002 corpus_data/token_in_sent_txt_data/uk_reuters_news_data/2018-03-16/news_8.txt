u.s. nuclear power regulator urged to reject limits on cyber protections
washington reuters a science advocacy group urged the nuclear regulatory commission on friday to reject a longstanding industry request to limit cyber attack protections at nuclear plants a day after the trump administration publicly blamed moscow for hacking into nuclear power and other energy infrastructure
the nuclear energy institute industry group petitioned the nuclear regulatory commission in june to limit the scope of the agency s safeguards to only systems with a direct impact on safety
the institute said in the petition that such limits would be less burdensome for operators of nuclear power plants while being adequately protective of public health and safety
the petition is foolhardy at best and at worse downright dangerous said edwin lyman a senior scientist at the union of concerned scientists a nonprofit science advisory group
the department of homeland security and fbi on thursday said that the russian government hacking campaign on energy and other facilities stretched back at least two years
in light of the growing cyber threat to nuclear plants highlighted by yesterday s alert the agency should now simply reject it lyman said
nrc spokesman david mcintyre said the agency sent the institute a letter in september telling them it was deferring consideration of the petition until it completes a round of inspections related to cyber security
the inspections started late last year and will continue through
systems that control the most critical safety equipment at nuclear plants are largely immune to cyber attacks because they are and not connected to the internet
but many other systems with key safety and security functions are and could be compromised via their internet connections lyman said
hackers could disable or reprogram systems including electronic locks alarms television cameras and communications equipment the group said
some plants have equipment such as cranes that move highly radioactive spent fuel that use systems that could be manipulated to cause an accident it said
the united states is the world leader in nuclear power with operating reactors
but the industry has suffered numerous closures in recent years in the face of a glut of cheap natural gas a competing fuel for power plants and soaring safety protection costs as a result of measures put in place after the attacks on
nei spokesman john keeley said his group had no comment on the request by the union of concerned scientists
