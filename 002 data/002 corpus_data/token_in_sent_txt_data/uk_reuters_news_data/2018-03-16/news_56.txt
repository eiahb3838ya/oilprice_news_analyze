corrected-update 1-global oil demand picks up but still lags rising supply -iea
corrects supply to mln bpd from mln bpd in paragraph by amanda cooper london march reuters global oil demand is expected to pick up this year but supply is growing at a faster pace leading to a rise in inventories in the first quarter of the international energy agency iea said on thursday
the iea raised its forecast for oil demand this year to million barrels per day bpd from million bpd in
commercial oil inventories in industrialised oecd nations rose in january for the first time in seven months to billion barrels million barrels above their average the iea said
the january increase of million barrels over the december inventory level was roughly half the size of rises normally seen at this time of year according to the agency which advises western governments on energy policy
but it said venezuela where an economic crisis has cut oil production by percent in two years to lows not seen in more than a decade could still trigger a renewed drawdown in stocks
with supply from venezuela clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline without any compensatory change from other producers it is possible that the latin american country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit the iea said
in a bid to drain inventories the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and several other producers have been implementing a deal to cut output by about million bpd from january until the end of
assuming no change in opec output for the rest of the year the iea said it expected a small increase in oecd inventories in the first quarter of with declines after that
the agency said it expected supply from nations to grow by million bpd in to million bpd led by the united states where crude output was forecast to rise by million bpd during to more than million bpd by the end of the year
opec crude output fell in february to million bpd led by venezuela and the united arab emirates
the iea raised its estimate for demand for opec oil to million bpd for from last month s forecast of million bpd
the agency said the decision by president donald trump decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium which has prompted threats of retaliation from major trading partners posed a risk to global economic growth forecasts
a slowdown would have strong consequences particularly for fuel used in the maritime sector and in the trucking industry the iea said
it said growth in world trade had been strong accelerating from percent in to percent in citing this as the likely reason behind a sturdy percent rise in in global gasoil demand
