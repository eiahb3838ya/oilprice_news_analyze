luanda reuters angola s economic growth prospects are on the rise as higher oil prices and sounder policies under president joao lourenco bring greater stability to africa s second biggest crude exporter the international monetary fund said on friday
angola s economy is expected to expand by percent this year from percent in and growth should reach percent in the ricardo velloso imf division chief for africa told reporters in luanda
since coming to power in september lourenco has vowed to revive africa s third largest economy attract investment and combat the endemic corruption that plagued the year rule of his predecessor jose eduardo dos santos

the angolan economy is experiencing a mild recovery
the new administration is rightly focusing on restoring macroeconomic stability and improving governance velloso said
over the medium term the outlook is for continued gradual recovery in economic activity but there are risks including a decline in oil prices and slippages in implementation of the structural reforms to promote economic the imf does not think a bailout is necessary despite angola s heavy debt burden and high inflation saying lourenco s reform plans and a buoyant global debt market should help stabilizes public finances velloso said
the imf supports the angolan government s policy of extending maturities on debt rather than restructuring he said
