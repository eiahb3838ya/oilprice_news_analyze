london reuters global oil demand is expected to pick up more quickly this year but supply is still growing at a faster pace leading to a rise in inventories in the first quarter of the international energy agency iea said on thursday
the iea raised its forecast for oil demand this year to million barrels per day bpd from million bpd in
commercial oil inventories in industrialized oecd nations rose in january for the first time in seven months to billion barrels million barrels above their average the iea said
but it said venezuela where an economic crisis has cut oil production by percent in two years to lows not seen in more than a decade could still trigger a renewed drawdown in stocks
with supply from venezuela clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline without any compensatory change from other producers it is possible that the latin american country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit the iea said

assuming no change in opec output for the rest of the year the iea said it expected a small increase in oecd inventories in the first quarter of with declines after that
the agency said it expected supply from nations to grow by million bpd in to million bpd led by the united states where crude output was forecast to rise by million bpd in to more than million bpd by the end of the year
