update 3-angola's mpla to discuss in april date for replacing dos santos
adds final statement from mpla by stephen eisenhammer luanda march reuters angola s ruling mpla party said on friday it would discuss next month when to appoint a new leader potentially undermining party chief and former president jose eduardo dos santos who hours earlier said he might stay on until next year
dos santos handpicked angola s new president joão lourenço to succeed him when he stepped down last september after ruling for years but held onto his position as head of the party creating two centres of power in the nation
since then dos santos has been under increasing pressure to give up the presidency of the people s movement for the liberation of angola mpla that has governed angola continuously since independence from portugal in
state radio said many in the mpla leadership had taken issue with dos santos intervention at friday s meeting of the central committee when in a rare public statement he told the party it should wait until december or april to replace him
consensus is building within the inner circle of the mpla that a new party leader should be appointed as early as june the radio reported
in a statement published at the end of the meeting the mpla said the decision to discuss the issue in april had as its only goal the strengthening of the mpla and the reinforcement of its internal cohesion
lourenço has moved against some of dos santos old allies and has removed family members from key positions including his daughter isabel from the chair of state oil company sonangol and josé filomeno from the sovereign wealth fund
party stalwarts have also come out to say they intended to ensure dos santos sticks to previous assurances that he would leave active political life in
after a flurry of rumours on social media suggesting friday s central committee meeting could see a date for his removal forced upon him dos santos moved to set his own timeline
i recommend that it would be most prudent that the party s extraordinary congress which will resolve the question of the leadership of the mpla be in december or april he told the central committee at the opening of the meeting
as head of the party dos santos remains hugely powerful with influence over the way lawmakers vote in parliament and on party policy proposals but relations with lourenço have broken down
i understand that the relationship has deteriorated since late and that they are no longer in communication with each other said alex vines head of the africa programme at london s chatham house
a transition of power after almost years was never going to be simple or smooth and the over the mpla presidency is a reminder that this transition is still in its infancy vines said
