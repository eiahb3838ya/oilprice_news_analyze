investors give e.on edge after big german power deal
reuters german utility is emerging as an investor favourite following a major asset swap deal with rival rwe this week with its share of regulated profits outshining rwe s riskier bet on renewables
following the deal announced on sunday shares in both companies soared as did those in rwe s networks and renewables business innogy which will be broken up as part of the deal and whose assets will split among and rwe
investors have had almost a week to digest a barrage of additional details and presentations on the multifaceted transaction with some concluding that got the better end of the deal because most of its profits are now guaranteed
is the winner said thomas hechtfischer managing director of shareholder advisory group dsw which usually represents roughly percent of voting rights at the annual general meetings of and rwe
i don t see a real advantage for rwe in the new under the deal will swallow innogy s networks as well as its retail energy operations becoming the european leader in both areas and raising its share of regulated profits to percent comparable in size only to britain s national grid
for its part rwe will become europe s wind power player after denmark s orsted by taking on innogy s and s renewable businesses exposing it to a but highly competitive renewables market
if you want low risk with structural upside you re well advised to buy said andreas schneller head of eic funds at wealth manager pury pictet turrettini cie who oversees a million swiss francs million utility fund
we think rwe is massively undervalued and therefore very attractive
however it is the riskier bet he added
rwe s sceptical municipal shareholders have supported the deal
investment returns on gas and power grids are set by national regulators allowing a reliable forecast of which way future profits will go
on the downside growth can only be achieved through efficiency measures
thomas deser fund manager at union investment said s future customer solutions retail energy business europe s largest with about million clients also offered upside and was less optimistic about competition in the clean energy space
a shift towards auctions and away from unlimited subsidies has squeezed europe s renewables sector and forced players along the supply chain to cut costs and make offers to secure a piece of the dwindling state support schemes
following the changes in the market regimes current renewable projects have become less attractive in a lot of places also due to competition from big oil which means it is not a great growth option in terms of margins deser said
the lack of major synergies on the rwe side seen at just million euros so far has also raised questions in light of the million euros seen at according to martijn olthof senior portfolio manager at apg asset management one of innogy s minority shareholders
he also said that investors keen on renewable exposure which also include norway s trillion sovereign wealth fund could like him have a problem with adding rwe to their portfolio due to its fleet of power plants
