finland's hanhikivi 1 reactor on track, unaffected by sanctions - rosatom
oslo march reuters a planned nuclear reactor in western finland owned by a consortium will meet its commissioning target despite delays in licensing and will not be affected by sanctions on russia supplier rosatom said
the start date of the gigawatt gw hanhikivi reactor has been in question since september when owner fennovoima said the construction licence it needed from the authorities would take a year longer to get due to delays
the fennovoima consortium of which about a third is owned by a rosatom unit had also expressed concerns in its annual report that economic sanctions on russia could affect its banks ability to guarantee the project s funding
we strongly believe that hanhikivi can be commissioned in as planned
and we re ready to deal with unpredictable circumstances should they arise and will adapt as necessary a rosatom spokesman told reuters in an email
he said rosatom was working on providing the delayed documentation to finnish regulator stuk during in order to get the required construction permit to build the reactor
eu sanctions against russia won t affect the timeframe of the hanhikivi project
none of the people involved in the project are on the sanctions list the spokesman added
hanhikivi estimated to cost between billion and billion euros billion is set to start producing electricity commercially in five years after another finnish reactor olkiluoto comes online
the costs of olkiluoto a reactor that was initially planned to begin production in have spiralled from billion euros to billion euros owner tvo said last week and there was a risk of that rising even further
in contrast to supplied by areva and siemens fennovoima s reactor was unlikely to exceed the budget rosatom said
we have a vested interest as investor and supplier to make sure that the hanhikivi project is achieved within the set budget the spokesman said
fennovoima is percent owned by voimaosakeyhtio sf which includes more than finnish regional utilities and other companies
rosatom s raos voima oy unit holds the remaining percent
