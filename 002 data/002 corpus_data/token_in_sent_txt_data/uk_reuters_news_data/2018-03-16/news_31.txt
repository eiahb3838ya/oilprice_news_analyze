exclusive-trafigura set to boost its dominance in urals - sources
reuters oil trader trafigura will regain its position as the largest buyer of seaborne crude from russia s rosneft trading sources told reuters on friday expanding their partnership as rosneft reduces its dealings with vitol and glencore
three sources told reuters that trafigura would increase its dominance in rosneft s urals oil trading from april when rosneft s deal with vitol and glencore expires
trafigura will be the lucky one a trader in the russian crude oil market said
rosneft trafigura glencore and vitol all declined to comment
trafigura was the biggest lifter of rosneft crude for a couple of years from when the companies established a close partnership amid western sanctions on moscow
rosneft s boss igor sechin is a close ally of president vladimir putin and the west imposed sanctions on the kremlin to retaliate against russia s annexation of crimea
but trafigura lost a large portion of volumes at the start of this year when rosneft transferred volumes it was previously getting in the pacific to its new shareholder china s cefc
from april trafigura will be able to recoup the volumes lost in the pacific by getting more urals crude on the baltic
it will see volumes rising to cargoes in april from russian baltic ports from five in previous months according to traders
the development became possible because march was the last month of rosneft s supplies to vitol and glencore under a deal signed in shortly before western sanctions against moscow were imposed
from april onwards rosneft will have some tonnes or seven cargoes a month of urals volumes available for sale and most of it will go to trafigura the sources said
the development means vitol once the biggest buyer of rosneft s oil will disappear from the list of regular buyers of rosneft s crude as it doesn t have new deals
glencore will remain a large buyer as it secured a supply deal last year when it became a shareholder in rosneft
sharp increases in urals supplies from rosneft could make trafigura the biggest market player in the baltic urals market from next month reuters data showed
