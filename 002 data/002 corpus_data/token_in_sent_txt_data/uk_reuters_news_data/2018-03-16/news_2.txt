etp mariner east liquids pipe spills fluid in pennsylvania again
reuters pennsylvania environmental regulators on friday issued another notice of violation to energy transfer partners lp s sunoco mariner east natural gas liquids pipeline for releasing drilling fluids into a stream
the company told the pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep it released about gallons of fluid into the snitz creek on thursday while drilling under the steam in west cornwall township in lebanon county about miles east of the state capital harrisburg
it was etp s third inadvertent release into the snitz creek following spills in august and september
it was also the project s notice of violations and inadvertent release since may according data from the dep
drilling was immediately stopped the mud was contained and removed and the dep was notified etp spokesman jeff shields said in an email
the dep said it must give its approval before etp can resume drilling at the site
the latest spill comes about a week after pennsylvania utility regulators suspended operations of etp s sunoco mariner east liquids pipeline after sinkholes were discovered near the project
regarding mariner east we are focused on performing the required work and preparing to share our information with regulators so we can safely return the pipeline to service shields said
mariner east transports up to barrels per day bpd of propane and ethane from the marcellus and utica shale formations in western pennsylvania to customers in pennsylvania and elsewhere including etp s marcus hook industrial complex near philadelphia
the sinkholes were near the area where construction is under way for the billion mariner east
the order stopping flows on mariner east did not affect work on mariner east
construction of mariner east which started in early was originally expected to be completed in the third quarter of but has been delayed by a couple of work stoppages by pennsylvania regulators among other things
etp currently expects to complete mariner east by the end of the second quarter
once complete mariner east will expand the total capacity of the mariner east project to barrels per day
etp s other projects include the dakota access crude line from north dakota to illinois and the rover natural gas pipe from pennsylvania to michigan which have also come under intense regulatory scrutiny over the past year or so
