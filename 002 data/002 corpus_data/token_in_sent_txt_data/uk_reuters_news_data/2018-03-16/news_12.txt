rpt-update 1-angola drops trafigura as glencore and total win major fuel tender
reuters angolan state oil company sonangol awarded its rare refined products buy tender to glencore and total sonangol said on friday cutting out supplier trafigura
total will supply angola with gasoline while glencore will supply diesel and marine diesel
sonangol issued the tender in january
for years trafigura had an effective monopoly on lucrative fuel supply deals with opec member angola though vitol edged in two years ago by taking over the gasoline imports
links between trafigura and angola stretch beyond fuel imports with sonangol and angolan company cochan holdings having the significant stakes in trader s global midstream and downstream business puma energy
the choice to give the lion s share of imports to other trade houses is a significant change under the country s new president joao lourenco
shortly after taking office in september lourenco said he was committed to economic reforms and ordered a review of the country s oil industry
he has already shaken up the old order by pushing out prominent figures from key state roles including the former president s daughter isabel dos santos who was head of sonangol
in friday s statement sonangol said that it had received bids from companies and that the contract would last one year with an option for a extension
sonangol added that the new tender award would bring a significant reduction in fuel import costs
the tender closed on having sought million tonnes of gasoline million tonne of gasoil and tonnes of marine fuel
heavily reliant on oil sales for government income angola was hit hard by the oil price crash which pushed its economy into recession and created foreign currency shortages that crippled business
