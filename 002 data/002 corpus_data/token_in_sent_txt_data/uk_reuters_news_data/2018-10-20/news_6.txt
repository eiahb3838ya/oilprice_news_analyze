in paragraph removes incorrect description of dunleavy as retired air force lieutenant colonel clarifies he was a former teacher by yereth rosen anchorage alaska oct reuters alaska governor bill walker a political independent halted his campaign on friday and endorsed his democratic challenger ending a contest in which neither had appeared capable of defeating the republican
with just days left before the election walker said he concluded that he could not win a second term in a race against both former
senator mark begich a democrat and former state senator mike dunleavy a republican
walker said his decision to bow out was based entirely on what he felt was best for alaska and involved no deal with the democrat or any promise of a role in a begich administration should he win
walker s withdrawal came three days after his former running mate byron mallott a democrat and the first alaska native elected to statewide office abruptly resigned as lieutenant governor over admitted but unspecified inappropriate comments in a scandal that threw the governor s campaign into disarray
but public opinion surveys were already showing dunleavy running well ahead of the two other men and indicated begich had greater support than the incumbent governor
