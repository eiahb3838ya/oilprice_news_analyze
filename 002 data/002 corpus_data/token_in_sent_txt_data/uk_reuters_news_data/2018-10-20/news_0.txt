update 1-kdp comes first in iraqi kurdistan election
erbil iraq reuters the ruling kurdistan democratic party kdp came first in a parliamentary election in the kurdistan region of iraq winning seats the election commission said on sunday positioning it to lead the next regional government
a year after a failed bid for independence iraq s kurds voted last month in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region
announcement of the results was delayed for three weeks after the independent high elections and referendum commission said it received and was investigating complaints of electoral violations
the kdp s historic rival and junior coalition partner in government the patriotic union of kurdistan puk was in second place with seats the commission said in a news conference
with opposition parties weak the kdp and puk are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power but the results suggest that masoud barzani s kdp will take a dominant position in kurdish politics
on election day the puk said it might not recognise the results of the election due to what it described as electoral violations but then appeared to backtrack injecting uncertainty into the process
election observers also said there were irregularities
the two parties who fought a civil war in the but more recently have taken to sharing power have recently come out of a gruelling political battle in baghdad where they competed for the presidency of federal iraq
the puk came out on top with the election of barham salih
the largest kurdish opposition party gorran or movement for change was a distant third with seats
there are seats in the iraqi kurdistan parliament with reserved for minority groups
