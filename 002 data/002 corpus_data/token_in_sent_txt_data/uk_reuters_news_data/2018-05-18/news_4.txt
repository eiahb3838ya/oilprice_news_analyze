update 2-german cities free to ban older diesel cars immediately
berlin reuters german cities are entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels in line with european union rules germany s top administrative court confirmed on friday
a day after the european commission lodged a complaint with europe s top court against germany for its repeated failure to protect air quality in its cities the details of the german ruling will add to pressure on volkswagen and its german peers to provide hardware fixes for polluting diesel models
research firm evercore isi has said this could cost the industry billion euros billion
germany opened the door to diesel bans in february when it allowed environmental groups to sue cities which fail to enforce europe s clean air rules despite fierce lobbying to oppose bans from carmakers
dozens of german cities including hamburg munich and stuttgart exceed european union limits on nitrogen oxide nox known to cause respiratory disease
in a statement on the ruling which was published on friday germany s administrative court in leipzig said there should be no grace periods for driving bans
such restrictions in their intensity do not go beyond other passage and stopping bans as justified by road law requirements which motorists always have to reckon with and which they principally have to accept the court said
european carmakers have invested heavily in diesel engines which produce less of the carbon that causes global warming than gasoline but more of other pollutants blamed for causing disease
germany s move to allow cities to ban diesel engines from streets could have wide implications for the future of the industry
bans in the home of some of the world s biggest automakers are a further blow for the sector and an embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel s government which has faced criticism for its close ties to the industry
this ruling is a disaster for the government which stands in for the greed for profit by the carmakers while leaving million owners of manipulated diesel cars alone said juergen resch managing director of germany s duh environmental lobby
immediate driving bans on major roads or road sections would be legitimate and could affect all models excluding those meeting the latest emissions standards the ruling statement said
of the million diesel cars on germany s roads only million have technology which was phased in
for wider city areas encompassing a multitude of main roads and side streets the court recommended a phased implementation of bans starting with older cars that meet emissions standards
the standard was replaced by beginning in
germany s vda auto industry lobby urged cities to keep a sense of proportion when deciding their course of action noting that nox levels should fall significantly in coming months as more models are sold and the software of older models is updated
what s at stake are not blanket driving bans but an assessment as to whether local measures are even necessary to meet the legal air quality targets vda president bernhard mattes said
the leipzig court had said in february that vehicles should not be banned until
tradesmen and some residents too should be exempted it said at the time
the ruling is the latest regulatory action to come in the wake of volkswagen s diesel emissions scandal in and was prompted by legal action from germany s duh
the courts have been waiting for the ruling statement received today said remo klinger a lawyer representing duh which is pushing suits in german cities including munich and frankfurt
we believe that in many cases it will swiftly come to oral hearings and germany s second most populous city hamburg on wednesday said it had started putting up signs to enforce driving bans of older diesel cars with local authorities expecting restrictions to start taking effect at the end of this month
