update 2-pompeo to call for broad support to pressure iran
washington reuters secretary of state mike pompeo will outline a diplomatic road map and call for broad support from european and other allies to apply pressure on iran to force it back to the negotiating table a senior official said on friday as washington seeks to chart a course after it pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal
rebuffing appeals from france germany and britain president donald trump withdrew the united states days ago from the nuclear deal between iran and six major powers and ordered that sanctions be reimposed on tehran
in his first foreign policy speech on monday pompeo will call for broad support to address the totality of iran s threats said brian hook senior policy advisor
hook said officials hoped economic pressure from renewed sanctions would lead iran back to the table as it did a few years ago leading to the nuclear accord
but it was not immediately clear whether the europeans would support the plan as they try to salvage investment and trade ties with tehran that followed the accord
hook said washington was seeking a diplomatic outcome with iran and sanctions were part of that
the goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on iran to change its behaviour and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns hook told reporters
we very much want to be to have a kind of diplomacy one that s very focussed and very determined to achieve our national security objectives he said adding we need a new framework that s going to address the totality of iran a senior european official whose country is party to the deal said there were concerns that the trump administration was interested in pursuing the maximum pressure and brutal show of strength idea instead of negotiating
we say that there has to be a negotiating method but if they are purely in the maximum pressure and brutal show of strength idea and they believe it will work because they believe it worked with north korea then we will have a major problem the official said
the threat of sanctions has already forced some european companies to pull back from iran
german lender dz bank said it will suspend its financial transactions with iran in july while french gas and power group engie also said it would end its contracts in iran by november
this week the treasury imposed sanctions against iranian finance officials and financiers it said were linked to hezbollah
hook played down differences between the united states and europe over iran
we have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture a new framework he said adding i think people are overstating the disagreements between the and trump said the agreement did not adequately curb iran s nuclear ambitions or address iran s ballistic missile programme and what the trump administration views as its destabilising role in the region
under the agreement tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against it
iran has denied it sought in the past to develop an atomic weapon saying its nuclear programme has always been for purely peaceful purposes
hook said the iran nuclear accord had given countries a false sense of security and the united states wanted to ensure any new agreement covered not only iran s nuclear and missile capabilities but also curbed its regional activities
this involves a range of things around its nuclear programme missiles proliferating missiles and missile technology and support for terrorists and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in syria and yemen said hook
in recent days officials have highlighted protests in iran to illustrate economic discontent among iranians and a reason iran should return to talks
at least one person was killed and six others wounded in the southern city of kazeroon according to the fars news agency on thursday
iran s president hassan rouhani has assured iranians that their economy can withstand new sanctions
you have seen the protests in iran and people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime which have not helped the iranian people said hook
later as he met his dutch counterpart at the state department pompeo also tweeted about the protests
