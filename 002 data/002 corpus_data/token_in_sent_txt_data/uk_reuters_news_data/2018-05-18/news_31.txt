algeria's islamist opposition urges national consensus on economic reform
algiers reuters algeria must build a national consensus to undertake deep economic reforms and end its dependency on volatile gas and oil revenues the new leader of the main islamist opposition party said
abderazak makri elected last week as the new head of the islamist msp party also told reuters he will stand in the presidential election in april if the government does not bring the opposition into its plans for taking the country forward
president abdelaziz bouteflika the veteran leader in power since has not declared yet whether he will seek a fifth term though the ruling fln party and the biggest labour union have asked him to run again
should the who is following a stroke in run again this would provide stability in the opec oil producer giving the power brokers time to sort out a smooth transition
but makri said the oil producer had no time to lose to agree on economic reforms as algeria s model of a state dominated economic dependent on oil and gas revenues no longer worked
a government needs full support from political parties unions and organizations to implement difficult reforms
this is why we need a consensus makri said in an interview
if we do not reach a political consensus all options will be then open
we may participate
we may boycott he said
islamist parties now play no big role in algeria where the fln has dominated since independence from france
the msp won only percent in the election and it boycotted the presidential elections in
makri said rising domestic gas consumption eating into gas exports showed that the algeria need to diversify its economy even if oil prices were continuing to pick up
oil and gas revenues have halved since straining a welfare state used to discourage dissent
algeria has responded to the economic crisis by reducing imports a public service hire freeze and postponing some projects to cope with the crash of oil prices
but the government has maintained subsidies of key products such as milk and powerful elites have resisted opening up the country too much to foreigners
the government needs to show very clearly to political parties that it will accept political change makri said
many ordinary algerians prefer stability after the civil war in the when the elite overturned an election which islamists were poised to win triggering a conflict with them in which about people were killed
makri was undeterred by the apparent modest support for islamist parties pointing to tunisia where islamist and secular forces rule together
tunisia is a good sample
when elections are free and fair the winners are always islamists he said
in morocco the islamists have won in tunisia they have won and they would have won in algeria if there had been no editing by ulf laessing and richard balmforth
