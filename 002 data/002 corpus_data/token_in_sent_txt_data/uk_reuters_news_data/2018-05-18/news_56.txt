update 1-u.s. driven by self-interest in wanting to block russia pipeline -german minister
berlin reuters a close ally of german chancellor angela merkel issued a stark warning to the united states about the risks of placing america first accusing washington of seeking to block a planned gas pipeline to shore up its own exports
economy minister peter altmaier defended the nord stream pipeline which is strongly opposed by many east european countries as well as the who say that by circumventing ukraine the pipeline will increase russia s leverage over countries that rely on moscow s energy sales
ahead of a summit due later on friday between merkel and russian president vladimir putin altmaier said the european union should guarantee that ukraine will continue to receive gas transit fees even after the pipeline is built under the baltic
but he accused washington of wanting to block the pipeline built by russia s energy giant gazprom and a consortium of european energy companies in order to boost its own shale gas exports
they are looking for markets which we can understand and they can land it here easily he said
but it is much more expensive than pipeline gas so blocking nord stream on its own won t guarantee he added that europe would respond firmly to attempts to place its own economic interests before those of partners
the are our friends and partners and we want to defend our common values
but if it s america first and they put their economic interest before others then they have to expect europe to define their own interests and fight for reporting by thomas escritt editing by matthew mpoke bigg
