exclusive-bp chief sees shale, opec cooling oil markets
london reuters bp chief executive bob dudley expects a flood of shale and the reopening of opec taps to cool the oil market after crude rose above a barrel this week
president donald trump s decision to exit an international nuclear deal with iran and revive sanctions on the opec member country as well as venezuela s plummeting output has helped to lift oil prices to their highest since
but bp sees oil falling to between and a barrel due to surging shale output and opec s capacity to boost production dudley told reuters
clearly the withdrawal of the united states from the iran nuclear deal has brought a lot of uncertainty to the market he said in an interview
crude exports from iran the member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries could drop by to million barrels per day bpd as a result of sanctions the ceo said citing internal bp forecasts
dudley said he expected the figure to be at the lower end of the range
the percent recovery in crude prices since february has given strong tailwind to oil companies such as bp whose profits recovered last year after a slump in the market
the energy information administration this month boosted its forecast of growth in domestic crude production in to an high of million bpd as shale drillers accelerate activity
the surge in output has been offset by deep supply cuts for over a year by opec and other producers including russia
opec s de facto leader saudi arabia assured key consumers that the world would have adequate supplies even if iran s exports dropped sharply
markets have so far been able to absorb oil s rise without impacting demand growth but dudley said a sustained crude price of over would be unhealthy
two years ago when the price was it was great for global growth the engines of the consuming economies but it was terrible for producing countries and that led to producing countries not being able to purchase things as well
that was not a healthy i think when you get above it is not a healthy price although the international energy agency this week cut its outlook for oil demand growth in due to rising crude prices bp still expects consumption to expand by million bpd extending a period of strong growth
the world has experienced an unprecedented decade of economic growth that is likely to continue even with sanctions and trade tensions between the united states and china dudley said
we re about to begin to see political factors creating trade dislocations sanctions and things like that
they will have impacts here and there but the overall economic growth rates appear to be not overheated he said
