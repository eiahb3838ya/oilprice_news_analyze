armed with gas and cows, kazakhstan takes aim at land degradation
voronezh russia may thomson reuters foundation k azakhstan is using natural gas and cows made genetically efficient to slow the pace of land degradation caused by deforestation and overgrazing a top official from the central asian nation said on friday
damage to the region s unique cold winter deserts could have consequences that will leave residents with no way of making a living officials warned at a regional food conference in southwest russia
the extent of degradation is difficult to assess because countries in central asia do not release official figures but anecdotal evidence shows the situation is serious said christian welscher project coordinator for the central asian desert initiative cadi at university of greifswald germany
also studies show a potential loss of percent of saxaul trees a shrub found only in the region s deserts due to rampant deforestation and overgrazing by cattle said welscher
the cadi is working with kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan to combat land degradation and conserve biodiversity
the deforestation causes sandstorms that devastate rural communities welscher said
mars almabek deputy chairman of the state agriculture inspection said kazakhstan is buying and importing modified cattle from the united states canada australia germany france and czechoslovakia
we are bringing natural gas to rural areas so they won t cut down trees and we are suggesting maybe they have three cows instead of but produce the same volume of milk he told the thomson reuters foundation
in the past five years kazakhstan imported some cows to the former soviet republic of million people almabek said
plans also include increasing the number of nature reserves to protect biodiversity he said
cold winter or temperate deserts have unique ecological qualities experts say providing important feeding grounds for animals and migration areas for birds
they also are home to the critically endangered saiga antelope
almost all are in central asia with a vast majority in kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan according to the united nations food agriculture organization fao
the degradation must be addressed warned the fao
if we do not reverse it people will start leaving because there will be no livelihood in these areas said yuriko shoji deputy regional representative for europe central asia for the fao which organised the conference
the aral sea is an extreme example of what could happen if actions are not taken shoji said
once the world s fourth biggest lake it has shrunk by percent in recent decades in what environmentalists describe as one of the worst ecological disasters
