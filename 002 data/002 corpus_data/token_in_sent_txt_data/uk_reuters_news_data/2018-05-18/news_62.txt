puerto rico power grid braces for hurricane season
new york reuters the federal agency tasked with restoring electricity to puerto rico after hurricane maria hit the caribbean last year is leaving the island though thousands still have no power heading into the next hurricane season starting next month
only a request from the governor of the island bemoaning the fragile state of the power grid managed to keep most of the generators brought by the federal emergency management agency fema on puerto rican soil for another six months
the remaining generators might help keep the lights on for hospitals or police stations if the island gets hit again during the coming hurricane season which begins june
hurricane maria devastated puerto rico last september leaving million homes and businesses in the dark
both the island s power utility and the trump administration s federal emergency management agency were criticized for a slow response
most power has been restored by the army corps of engineers but the electricity grid remains unreliable and suffered an blackout last month
for a graphic on power restoration after hurricanes click the whole world is very nervous about hurricane time said rosalina abreu gonzalez who lives near mariana on the eastern side of the island where power has still not been restored
there is a real concern the government hasn t provided an energy system that is more the army corps a unit of the armed forces has said its task is largely complete now that most people have power
about customers are still without electricity most in remote areas according to the new head of the island s power utility the puerto rico electric power authority
our mission wasn t to build a modern resilient system charles alexander director of contingency operations and homeland security headquarters at the army corps said at a senate hearing last week
on april governor ricardo rossello asked officials to leave behind generators at critical facilities along with three larger generators used to keep the grid stable
fema agreed to leave the and generators for critical facilities
supply megawatts of power enough to power homes
new prepa chief executive walter higgins who has only been on the job for two months said he is focusing on emergency procedures in the event of another disaster in coming months
he said there is a plan for building a more resilient grid in the future
higgins took over from ricardo ramos who resigned as ceo in november after coming under fire for signing unvetted contractors to restore power rather than immediately ask for assistance from other utilities
unfortunately pain causes learning and what we ve learned is how to get mutual assistance called for and on the island immediately higgins told reuters
still prepa s grid lacks buried power lines or reinforced poles common in other hurricane prone areas
the power utility ran up an billion debt over many years largely due to poor bill collection causing the system to fall into disrepair
it is very hard to see these messages where the government is saying we re ready for next season
we re not said sheylda diaz a biology professor who lives near utuado in the island s center where some lines and poles have yet to be fixed
the army corps will not provide further line restoration after friday fema said
people here have no idea that they are leaving said abreu gonzalez who runs a center where people without power can go for meals
higgins said he sympathizes with those who want the corps to remain
i can understand why somebody would want them to stay longer as long as there s a single customer maria hit shortly after hurricanes harvey and irma slammed the mainland in but in both cases power was largely restored within a week
i can not imagine a scenario where texans or floridians were without power and fema would make that decision said martin heinrich a democrat from new mexico
