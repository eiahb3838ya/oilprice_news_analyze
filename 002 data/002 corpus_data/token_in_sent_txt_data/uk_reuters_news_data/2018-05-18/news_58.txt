feature-global plan powers up to supply clean energy for refugees
barcelona may thomson reuters foundation aid agencies and governments are transforming the way they provide energy to families forced to flee their homes around the world from setting up solar power plants at camps for syrians in jordan to funding a small solar panel for a malian refugee to run a fridge for her water shop in burkina faso
energy has always been needed in the camps and informal settlements home to tens of millions of people uprooted by conflicts or natural disasters
but it has largely been in the form of polluting diesel generators fossil fuels for trucks to move relief supplies or locally harvested firewood for cooking
that is changing with agencies aid groups major countries and businesses preparing in july to sign up to a global action plan to provide all displaced people with access to sustainable energy by in line with development goals
people are beginning to realise that this is an important issue and something that deserves priority resources and attention said owen grafham from the moving energy initiative mei a partnership managed by think tank chatham house which is working on the action plan
in camps about percent of people lack electricity while percent rely on firewood and other solid fuels to cook which are harmful to their health and local forests according to mei
electric power has not been regarded as a human right in emergency situations unlike shelter water food or healthcare said andrew harper of the refugee agency unhcr
energy is really not something that is fully taken into account he said
but it is the key to empowering refugees and displaced persons added the unhcr s director of programme support and former representative in jordan
in when jordan s za atari camp opened home at one point to as many as syrian refugees friday prayers would be followed by a riot with frustrated anxious residents destroying things and throwing stones harper said
but once unhcr began spending up to each month on electricity supplied to the camp via a grid connection refugees used it to set up some shops and businesses and the rampages stopped as their sense of dignity grew he said
they started feeling possessive protective engaged in the stability of the camp he added
since last year two of jordan s main refugee camps have used power produced by their own solar plants one in za atari funded by german development bank kfw and the other in azraq backed by the ikea foundation that can also feed back surplus electricity into the national grid
sarah head of humanitarian energy at charity practical action said jordan s government takes the wider view that getting camps connected will improve the country s infrastructure and support national development
they see it as an opportunity and as a way to change perceptions in host communities that this is good for both of us not just for refugees she told the thomson reuters foundation
practical action is embarking on a project in the north jordan city of irbid also funded by the ikea foundation that will assist landlords renting properties to vulnerable refugee families to install rooftop solar systems for heating water
the development charity will also work with unhcr and other partners in rwanda to set up solar and home systems to power schools clinics street lighting and home appliances in three camps hosting congolese refugees offering an alternative to candles and kerosene
it will also look at ways to provide more sustainable fuel and efficient stoves for cooking
government officials and others at a meeting on wednesday in kigali rwanda s capital about the renewable energy for refugees project emphasised the need to move away from the environmentally harmful use of firewood mei said
energy underpins many things displaced people need to do in their daily lives said from charging mobile phones used to contact relatives and transfer money to washing clothes lighting entertainment and moving around
but the answer is not to distribute energy for free she added
there is already a market there in camps with households spending a relatively high proportion of their disposable income on energy she noted
handouts risk destroying that market and making people worse off by giving them products they do not want she said
the challenge is to supply cleaner power and cooking methods for a lower price and other experts said
the forthcoming global action plan will include targets and concrete ways of reaching them those drafting it said
practical action s hopes that in five years aid workers will factor in the provision of clean energy from the outset of an emergency and include it in funding plans
doing so would also bring significant cost savings for agencies that spend millions of dollars each year on power from unreliable diesel generators that often break down cutting off the health clinics and other services they run she added
unhcr s harper said aid organisations needed to collaborate with business governments and development banks to overcome barriers to building and operating clean energy services for refugees and displaced people
problems include high upfront costs onerous bureaucracy and restrictive regulations
in za atari for example unhcr found refugees were willing to buy electricity but the agency had no mechanism to receive payment
a new partnership called the smart communities coalition by credit card giant mastercard and the government s power africa programme will attempt to resolve such issues by putting in place digital infrastructure in refugee camps and settlements starting later this year in kenya and uganda
the aim is for governments aid agencies and companies to develop a model to provide refugees with internet and mobile connectivity digital financial tools and access to clean energy
that will require fresh thinking on all sides said tara nathan who leads on partnerships for mastercard which will offer its expertise in digital payments
the money the capacities exist it about finding a way for everyone to act like and intervene together she said on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in lisbon this month
