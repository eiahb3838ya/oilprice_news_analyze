putin seeks common cause with merkel over trump
sochi may reuters russian president vladimir putin said at a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on friday that he would stand up to any attempts by president donald trump to block a gas pipeline project
berlin and moscow have been at loggerheads since russia s annexation of crimea four years ago but they share a common interest in the nordstream pipeline project which will allow russia to export more natural gas to northern europe
a government official this week said washington had concerns about the project and that companies involved in russian pipeline projects faced a higher risk of being hit with sanctions
donald is not just the president he s also a good tough entrepreneur putin said at a news conference alongside merkel after the two leaders had talks in the russian black sea resort of sochi
he s promoting the interests of his business to ensure the sales of liquefied natural gas on the european market putin said
i understand the president
he s defending the interests of his business he wants to push his product on the european market
but it depends on us how we build our relations with our partners it will depend on our partners in we believe it the pipeline is beneficial for us we will fight for merkel who earlier in the day received a bouquet of pink and white roses from putin as she arrived at his residence in sochi also hinted at tensions between berlin and the trump administration
as well as the differences over nordstream european capitals are at odds with washington over trump s decision to withdraw from the iranian nuclear deal
moscow shares europe s position on the deal
germany britain france and all our partners in the european union continue to support this deal and remain in this deal and we know that a very specific situation arose that we europeans need to discuss with iran merkel said at the news conference
i know that the deal is anything but perfect but it is better than no asked about differences with the united states merkel told reporters we have a strong transatlantic friendship which during its history has had to withstand many questions of different opinions and i think that might be the case now as but this does not challenge the intensity of the transatlantic relationship she said
some commentators have said that a shared opposition to trump s stances on iran and other issues could lead to a rapprochement between europe and russia repairing a relationship badly damaged by the ukraine conflict
putin s remarks about trump were unusually forthright
while the russian leader is frequently critical of policy putin has always been respectful in his comments on trump with whom kremlin officials say he has built up a personal rapport
