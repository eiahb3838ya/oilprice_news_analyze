lanka ioc prepared to set own fuel prices to minimise losses
colombo may reuters sri lankan fuel retailer lanka ioc will be forced to implement its own pricing mechanism to minimise losses if the government fails to implement its proposed fuel price formula the company said on friday
the move by lanka ioc a subsidiary of india s ioc comes after the government failed to increase fuel prices charged by ceylon petroleum corp cpc in line with rising global oil prices
on march lanka ioc raised its prices because of losses incurred after the government s failure to implement a pricing formula for cpc
finance minister mangala samaraweera last week said that the cabinet has approved a price formula with revisions every two months
the government raised fuel prices last week after lanka ioc raised its prices
cabinet approval is there but the pricing of petroleum is a very touchy issue across the globe and the same is the case in sri lanka lanka ioc s managing director shyam bohra told reuters
if the proper pricing mechanism is in place we will follow it
if it is not then we will have to sell our products at the cost plus what ever actuals are lanka ioc posted a loss of million rupees million in the year to march against a billion rupee profit in the previous year mainly because of high global oil prices in conjunction with low retail prices for fuel
most likely it will be that we will have to have our own prices we can t keep on losing money bohra added
president maitripala sirisena s coalition government which has pressed ahead with unpopular fiscal reforms since coming to power in has been hesitant to implement the fuel price formula before local elections
the coalition partners suffered a humiliating loss in local government polls in february
bohra said the government has yet to inform the company about the new pricing formula and said it should also be transparent for the public
the government had agreed in principle with an international monetary fund imf requirement to implement the pricing formula in return for a billion loan approved in
the imf on thursday said that if the pricing formula is implemented properly it would eliminate fuel subsidies that benefit the rich rather than the poor
we think that an automatic fuel pricing mechanism marks a major step toward completing the energy pricing reforms that are under way in sri lanka and minimises the fiscal risks said gerry rice of the imf s communications department
