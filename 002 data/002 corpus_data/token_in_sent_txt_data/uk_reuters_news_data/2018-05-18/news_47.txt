funds look past 3 pct u.s. yield to pump $11.9 bln into stocks-baml
london reuters investors pumped billion into global equities in the past week and also put money into bank loans likely viewing the rise in bond yields as reflecting a robustly growing economy bank of america merrill lynch said on friday
the bank s data which tracks fund flows from wednesday to wednesday also showed some relatively small million inflows into emerging stocks which have taken a hit from the treasury selloff and the dollar s rise but tend to benefit from an improving economy
the rise in yields from percent to percent over the past months is a good rise in yields but if more than percent is considered a bad rise this should be revealed in coming weeks by further outflows from financials emerging markets credit as well as rising private client cash levels baml told clients in a note
a good yield rise would indicate faith in economic growth while a bad rise on the other hand could reflect the view that inflation is gaining the upper hand
the bank said its private clients cash allocations currently stood at percent of assets under management a record low testifying to their appetite for risk
within equities funds took in billion and japanese stocks took in a modest million but europe posted its straight week of losses losing million

the data also showed million inflow into bank loans which baml attributed to the fact that markets are now pricing in a roughly percent probability of three more federal reserve rate rises this year instead of two
banks tend to benefit as interest rates rise
bond funds absorbed billion
however emerging debt recorded its fourth straight week of outflow shedding billion
bonds also considered vulnerable to higher borrowing costs also saw a second week of outflows
baml said however there were signs the treasury yield rise could be approaching its end noting million in redemptions from financials stocks bring losses to billion
this is important as the reversal in flows to financials funds preceded the peak in bond yields in both and the bank added
