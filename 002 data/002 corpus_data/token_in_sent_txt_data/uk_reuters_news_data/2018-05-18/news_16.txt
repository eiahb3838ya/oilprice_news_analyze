update 1-putin seeks common cause with merkel over trump
sochi russia reuters russian president vladimir putin said at a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on friday that he would stand up to any attempts by president donald trump to block a gas pipeline project
berlin and moscow have been at loggerheads since russia s annexation of crimea four years ago but they share a common interest in the nord stream pipeline project which will allow russia to export more natural gas to northern europe
a government official this week said washington had concerns about the project and that companies involved in russian pipeline projects faced a higher risk of being hit with sanctions
donald is not just the president he s also a good tough entrepreneur putin said at a news conference alongside merkel after the two leaders had talks in the russian black sea resort of sochi
he s promoting the interests of his business to ensure the sales of liquefied natural gas on the european market putin said departing from his usual approach of being scrupulously respectful when speaking about trump
but it depends on us how we build our relations with our partners it will depend on our partners in we believe it the pipeline is beneficial for us we will fight for as well as the differences over nord stream european capitals are at odds with washington over trump s decision to withdraw from the iranian nuclear deal
moscow shares europe s position on the deal
some commentators have said that a shared opposition to trump s stances on iran and other issues could lead to a rapprochement between europe and russia repairing a relationship badly damaged by the ukraine conflict
merkel who earlier in the day received a bouquet of pink and white roses from putin as she arrived at his residence in sochi also hinted at tensions between berlin and the trump administration
asked about differences with the united states over the iran deal and other issues merkel told reporters we have a strong transatlantic friendship which during its history has had to withstand many questions of different opinions and i think that might be the case now as while the russian leader is frequently critical of policy he has been meticulous about not attaching blame to trump personally
kremlin officials have said in the past the two men have a personal rapport that putin wishes to preserve
european states involved in nord stream say it is a purely commercial project but the trump administration say it is helping the kremlin pursue its political agenda
the pipeline may result in less russian gas being transported via ukraine depriving kiev s struggling government of transit fees that are a vital source of revenue
in a nod to the concerns merkel said russian gas should still be pumped through ukraine
we see nord stream as an economic project but it also has implications and that s why we are working on what guarantees ukraine could be given she said
putin said he was willing to negotiate with kiev about continued transit of russian gas
despite the common ground on nordstream and the iran deal tensions in the relationship surfaced at the news briefing
merkel said she was worried about a new property law implemented by the government of syria which is backed by moscow
rights activists say the law allows the syrian government to deprive people who have been displaced by the fighting of their homes
that is bad news for people who want one day to return to syria
we will discuss that intensively and ask russia to use their influence to persuade assad not to do that
we must prevent facts being created on the ground merkel said
putin a day earlier had received syrian leader bashar at his residence in sochi for talks
at the briefing with merkel the russian president chided european leaders over syria saying if they want syrian refugees living in their countries to return home europe had to commit to reconstruction in syria
diplomats say that is a bone of contention because european governments believe russia should pay the lion s share of the reconstruction cost since it is the main military force and powerbroker in syria
