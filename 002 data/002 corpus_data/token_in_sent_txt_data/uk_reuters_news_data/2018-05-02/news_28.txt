reuters worldwide investments in limiting climate change are far too low and as flimsy as using an umbrella in a hurricane the united nations climate chief patricia espinosa said on wednesday
espinosa a former mexican foreign minister also told delegates from almost nations meeting in germany that more storms droughts and floods linked to greenhouse gas emissions threatened global destabilisation
she urged far more investments to limit global warming by shifting from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy and to protect people from the worsening effects of extreme weather
trying to address climate change at current financing levels is like walking into a category hurricane protected by only an umbrella she said in a speech
right now we are talking in millions and billions of dollars when we should be speaking in trillions said espinosa who is head of the
climate change secretariat
the impacts of extreme weather are already creating nations at the april meeting in bonn are working on a detailed rule book for the paris agreement aiming to have it in place by the end of and are reviewing actions so far to limit global warming

developing nations say the accounts are exaggerated
there remains a vast gap between the support needed and support received gebru jember endalew who chairs the least developed nations group said in a statement
espinosa said average world surface temperatures were set to rise by degrees celsius fahrenheit above times based on current commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions
the paris agreement seeks to limit warming to well below a rise
president donald trump who doubts climate change is primarily plans to quit the paris pact and instead promote domestic fossil fuels
espinosa said a three degree rise will lead to nothing less than global destabilisation
it will cost lives
it will raise competition over resources it will increase instability and inia seruiratu fiji s agriculture minister who is tasked with driving more ambitious action to meet paris agreement targets said countries face limits on how much they can adapt to coming changes such as worsening cyclones
we live in constant fear that a direct hit from intensifying cyclones could wipe out our economy altogether and set back our development by decades he said in bonn
