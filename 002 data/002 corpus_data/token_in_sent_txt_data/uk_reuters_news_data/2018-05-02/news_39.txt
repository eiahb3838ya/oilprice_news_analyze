clean energy sector swings republican with u.s. campaign donations
reuters solar and wind energy companies have donated far more money to republicans than democrats in congressional races this election cycle according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance data an unprecedented tilt to the right for an industry long associated with the environmental left
while the money is modest compared with that donated by fossil fuel interests the support provides gop candidates with added credibility on clean energy an issue polling shows swing voters care about
renewable energy has typically depended on government subsidies and policies to help fuel its growth and the donations come at a time when republicans control both houses of congress as well as a majority of state houses across the country
republicans have so far left subsidies for the industry largely intact
we support those leaders who share our vision said arthur haubenstock vice president of policy and strategy at renewables llc a solar project developer and treasurer of a newly formed political action committee that shares the company s name
so far the pac has donated only to republicans
overall political action committees representing solar and wind companies have donated nearly to candidates and pacs in the election cycle including to republicans to democrats and to independents according to the reuters analysis
that marks a record
during the presidential elections the first cycle during which the clean energy industry gave more to the gop than to democrats republicans received just over half of the combined in political contributions from major wind and solar pacs
before that solar and wind companies mainly donated to democrats who were broadly seen as more supportive of policies that could help the nascent sector grow
in percent of the contributions from seven major wind and solar pacs went to democrats
the solar and wind industries have expanded greatly over the last decade and now employ some workers nationwide nearly six times more than coal mining
the hottest growth has been in states that voted heavily for president donald trump in
that has helped strengthen the industry s appeal to republican lawmakers allowing it to rebrand as a jobs engine for the heartland instead of as a tool for combating global warming an issue that played better with democrats
solar is creating economic activity in so many districts said abigail ross hopper head of the solar energy industries association seia whose donations have tilted heavily toward the gop
global warming is certainly not our lead talking point she said
seia has contributed more than twice as much to republicans as to democrats this cycle versus
prior to seia s contributions to democrats were reliably double what the group gave to republicans
the american wind energy association s pac too has shifted its giving
in it gave democrats twice as much money as republicans while in the current cycle it has given to republicans compared to for democrats
polls have found widespread support for renewable energy among voters including among republicans
most recently a gallup poll from early march found percent of adults favor an emphasis on alternatives like wind and solar over traditional fossil fuels
just over half of republicans percent favored alternatives compared with percent of democrats gallup said
among moderate republicans and voters who lean republican there is even wider support for renewable energy
a poll conducted by pew research center in early found that nearly of that group favored alternative energy sources over fossil fuels
the polls also found that attitudes toward clean energy are not necessarily linked to those about climate change
the gallup poll for instance found just percent of republicans think climate change is caused by human activities and percent think the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated
clean energy works every time and it doesn t alienate the base said jay faison chief executive of clearpath a group that aims to help elect republicans supporting clean power
voters view support for alternative energy as a signal that a candidate is not an errand boy for the party leadership he added
nevada incumbent senator dean heller is among the chief republican beneficiaries of support from the clean energy industry
his effort has drawn more than in backing from solar and wind this election cycle
nevada ranks fourth in the nation in solar installations and generates more than percent of its electricity from the sun
one in every people is employed by the solar industry in nevada putting it second only to california
heller told reuters he supports clean energy because of the jobs it has brought to his state
nevada has been able to attract employers like tesla he said in part because its abundant sunshine can produce renewable power for factories and other business operations
he added he doesn t see a conflict with supporting both solar energy and fossil fuel interests i m very pro all of the above and i think that s where the gop is he said
other republicans receiving solar and wind donations include kevin brady of texas carlos curbelo of florida george holding of north carolina and tom reed of new york all members of the house committee on ways and means which is responsible for writing tax policy
all four hail from states with sizeable solar markets and curbelo is also of the climate solutions caucus a bipartisan group of house lawmakers working on policies to address climate change
house majority leader kevin mccarthy has received about in contributions from the renewable energy pacs and seia held a fundraiser for him in his california district last year
mccarthy s congressional district which includes a swath of the mojave desert boasts more solar capacity than any other district in the nation most of it in projects for utilities
marks democratic and environmental groups downplay the clean energy industry s shifting financial support saying companies are simply trying to protect their interests by supporting the party in power
awea and seia are trade associations representing the financial business interests of their member companies said sara chieffo vice president of government affairs at the league of conservation voters which has found itself at odds with solar and wind pacs on many candidates including heller
the league gives heller marks for his environmental voting record and has endorsed his democratic opponent jacky rosen in the nevada senate race
most environmental groups still primarily back democrats
the league of conservation voters for example has contributed million to democratic congressional candidates this cycle but has not supported a single republican
billionaire tom steyer s nextgen climate action super pac has spent tens of millions of dollars in recent election cycles on campaigns against republicans and for democratic candidates
democratic national committee spokeswoman sabrina singh questions why solar and wind companies would support republicans over democrats
republicans she said consistently seek to defund efforts to promote clean energy while democrats at both the federal and state level have been fighting to promote renewable the republican national committee did not respond to a request for comment
renewable energy industry shifts to backing republicans additional reporting by grant smith in new york editing by richard valdmanis and sue horton
