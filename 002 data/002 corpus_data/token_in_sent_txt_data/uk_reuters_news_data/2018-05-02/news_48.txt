column-rising oil prices put demand destruction back on the agenda: kemp
london reuters rising oil prices over the last two years have put the issue of demand destruction back on the agenda as producers traders and analysts try to estimate how consumers will respond
demand destruction always becomes a topic of discussion during this stage of the price cycle and the current discussion resembles previous episodes of high and rising prices in and
brent prices have surged by per barrel percent from their low point in early and are now trading close to per barrel
over the same period gasoline pump prices have risen by almost per gallon percent and now stand just a few cents below per gallon
crude and gasoline prices are still well below the levels of per barrel and per gallon where they stood just before oil prices started slumping at the end of june
but crude and fuels are no longer particularly cheap and most traders and oil exporting nations expect prices to increase further over the next year
in real terms oil prices are close to the average level for the whole of the last cycle from late through early
as the matures and prices move towards their next peak the focus on consumer responses is set to intensify
in an early sign of political sensitivity in consuming countries president donald trump blamed opec for rising oil prices via a message on his twitter account on april
oil prices are artificially very high
no good and will not be accepted the president wrote with his customary directness
in contrast opec officials have indicated they see no adverse impact on oil consumption as a result of price increases so far
i have not seen any impact on demand with current prices
we have seen prices significantly higher in the past twice as much as where we are today saudi arabia s oil minister told reporters in jeddah
reduced energy intensity and higher productivity globally of energy input levels leads me to think that there is capacity to absorb higher prices the minister said on april
this part of the cycle is normally characterised by a game of guess the threshold at which rising prices start to destroy oil demand
in recent weeks some analysts have suggested demand destruction will begin if and when prices rise above per barrel while others put the threshold as high as
others express the same idea by suggesting per gallon or even is the psychologically important limit for motorists
but identifying a specific price threshold is probably the wrong way to think about the issue of prices and consumption
in reality there is a continuum of consumer responses to price ranging from demand stimulation to demand destruction
the lower prices fall and the longer they are expected to stay there the more consumption tends to be stimulated
the higher prices rise and the longer they are predicted to stay up the more consumption tends to be destroyed
the response of consumption to prices is continuous but highly
the response also takes time to materialise as consumers slowly adjust their behaviour and buy new equipment and it takes even longer to appear in the official consumption statistics due to reporting delays
adding to the complexity oil consumption is also responsive to other factors including economic growth and incomes car ownership and vehicle fleet growth average miles travelled and average miles per gallon
some of these factors are themselves more or less related to oil prices at different timescales which makes the analysis even more complicated
for example oil prices have an impact on choices about fuel economy when new vehicles are purchased
as a result it is notoriously difficult to estimate the of oil demand and economists have generated widely varying estimates
but the bottom line is that oil consumption does respond to price changes and the response is not geared to any particular threshold
the relationship between prices and oil consumption is evident in the global statistics at least for the countries in the oecd though it is not so clear for low and countries outside the oecd
oil consumption in countries has increased every year since with the single exception of
for a chartbook click here in these countries rising consumption has been driven by fast economic growth rising household incomes and increasing vehicle ownership which has dominated and masked any price effects
by contrast in the oecd growth in incomes and vehicle ownership has been more moderate and the impact of prices on consumption is readily apparent
oecd oil consumption fell in and all periods associated with high real oil prices
conversely oecd consumption rose very rapidly between and and again between and when real prices were relatively low
there are some nuances including the elimination of oil from heating and power generation during the and and the complicated interaction between the oil shocks and recessions
but the basic relationship between prices and consumption for the oecd is clear
oil prices have not usually risen high enough to reduce total global demand because consumption has continued growing
but high prices tend to temper demand growth through their impact on oecd consumption
the same basic relationship can be traced between gasoline prices traffic volumes and gasoline consumption punctuated by the occasional recession
the decline in gasoline prices contributed to a notable acceleration in gasoline consumption growth in compared with the preceding years
but gasoline consumption was flat in and is expected to grow by just barrels per day in according to the energy information administration energy outlook eia april
mirror the escalation of oil prices since the start of has probably started to restrain consumption growth compared with a baseline in which prices had remained at per barrel
so far the demand restraint from increasing prices has been offset by synchronised global growth especially in the countries that account for a rising share of oil use
if prices continue to increase however there will come a point at which consumption growth starts to slow in a much more pronounced fashion
unfortunately experience suggests the extent of the demand deceleration will only become apparent after it is already well underway
and the slowdown in consumption growth will continue even once prices stop rising given the long lags in the system
between and when oil prices averaged over per barrel declining consumption in the oecd and slowing consumption growth in the created the conditions for the last oil slump
if oil prices continue to increase as most hedge fund managers and nations expect the same scenario could play out again between and
