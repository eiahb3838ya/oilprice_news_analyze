column-shanghai crude oil futures look successful, but issues lurk: russell

the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia may reuters the new shanghai crude oil futures have been trading for just over a month and have so far managed to build up reasonably strong volumes but this success may only mask some wider concerns
the contracts were launched on march by the shanghai international energy exchange ine and are enjoying trading volumes averaging around a day with the open interest around
the ine contract offers seven grades of middle eastern and domestic crude for delivery to various locations in china the world s largest oil importer
while the contract is to match china s crude buying it is structured so that delivery is for several months ahead making it difficult to compare to other crude oil benchmarks such as brent west texas intermediate wti and the dubai mercantile exchange s oman
the shanghai contract includes a freight component and a currency factor making it challenging for traders to work out arbitrage opportunities against the other benchmarks
nonetheless the volumes and open interest compare very favourably to those of the dme contract which is perhaps the best comparison given that oman crude is similar in quality to the grades being offered by the ine
daily volumes for the dme contract are usually between and well below the levels that shanghai futures are achieving
however both are dwarfed by brent and wti both of which trade in the hundreds of thousands of contracts every day
it s also the nature of the volumes on the ine that may be cause for concern with trade dominated by chinese players including the major refiners smaller traders and retail investors
there is nothing wrong with this mix per se but the ine contract may end up like the iron ore futures on the dalian commodity exchange insofar as they attract huge volumes but mainly from domestic players who respond more to local news flows than market fundamentals
this raises the risk that the ine contract effectively becomes a chinese domestic vehicle for investors to play in the crude oil market
if this does happen it would undermine the aim of establishing shanghai as a major pricing hub for crude oil
so far it appears that participation by western oil companies traders and investors in the ine has been limited
that s not to say there isn t interest among western players in the shanghai market but it seems that they are being cautious as how best to benefit from participating
one of the logical ways to participate would be to hedge middle east crude against the delivered price in china and to pocket any arbitrage difference
this means the price of oman futures would have to be below those in shanghai and other costs such as currency transactions and freight would also have to be factored in
the oman contract which is for july delivery ended at a barrel on tuesday
this is the contract most suitable for comparison to the ine future which is for delivery in september
the shanghai future ended at yuan a barrel on april with there being no trade on monday and tuesday due to public holidays
this equates to about a barrel meaning there is only a tiny premium of cents a barrel currently between the ine and dme equivalent contracts
this isn t enough to cover the cost of freight and currency conversion meaning the arbitrage window between dubai and shanghai is currently closed
of course this won t always be the case but market participants outside china appear to be adopting a attitude when it comes to the ine contract
having a mirror contract for the ine futures perhaps based in the regional trading hub of singapore may boost interest in the shanghai futures
but for now the initial success of the shanghai contract is tempered by signs that it may not be working as intended and that it s still some way from achieving the goal of becoming the benchmark for crude trade in asia
