update 1-alberta to hold talks on crude transport with producers, railways -minister
adds alberta energy minister quotes by julie gordon calgary alberta may reuters alberta will hold talks with rail operators and oil producers aimed at smoothing the path to get more crude moving by rail amid a transportation bottleneck in the western canadian province alberta s energy minister said on wednesday
the first session on friday will include senior executives from canada s top oil producers and the two main railways canadian pacific railway and canadian national railway the minister margaret told reporters at a calgary conference
we re hearing there s constraints and there s gaps between the rail companies and producers so what are those gaps and how can we address them she said
railways who added crude by rail capacity earlier this decade only to have the market vanish as pipeline space opened up have been slow to move back in the oil transport business asking producers to sign deals
but oil producers want flexibility to switch to pipeline which is far cheaper if capacity becomes available
a pipeline isn t going to be built overnight
so we need to have strategies for all market access said
canada s energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity sending the differential between canadian oil prices and the crude benchmark to highs
adding to the crunch kinder morgan canada paused work last month on its trans mountain pipeline expansion citing opposition in british columbia and said it would decide by may on whether to go ahead with the build or not
both alberta and canada s federal government have pledged financial support to the project which would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from alberta to a
port
when asked about alberta s financial pledge said the government was open to all options though she declined to clarify if the province was considering an ownership stake in just the project or the entire pipeline or company
