feature-smoke to ink? indian inventors try a novel approach to tame air pollution
new delhi may thomson reuters foundation as the summer heat takes hold in new delhi two things are as inevitable as days power cuts and air pollution from the diesel generators that then kick in
but a team of indian engineers has figured out away to bring some good from choking generator exhaust they are capturing it and turning it into ink
the alarming thing about diesel generators is they are located in the heart of densely populated areas
it s spitting smoke right there said kushagra srivastava one of the three engineers who developed the technology now installed in gurgaon a satellite city of new delhi and in the southern city of chennai
the idea srivastava said came about when he and his stopped at a sugarcane juice stall on a hot day
they noticed a wall that had turned black behind the stand s diesel generator where exhaust emerged from a pipe
they wondered if diesel exhaust might be used to produce paint and set out to try
the device they came up with which attaches to generators captures percent of the soot particles from cooled diesel exhaust
the material can then be sold to ink manufacturers
their company chakr innovation has so far installed of the devices for government firms such as indian oil real estate developers and other state government offices earning more than million rupees in revenue in the first year srivastava said
the company has plans to install another devices over the coming year he said
it has so far sold kg of collected soot which has been used to create litres of ink he added
chakr innovations is not the first to see cash in diesel exhaust
a competitor called graviky labs based in bangalore is using similar technology to turn diesel exhaust from vehicles into ink
srivastava and his arpit dhupar and prateek sachan see themselves as part of a movement towards cleaner air and energy in a country where major cities struggle with choking air
about million people a year die from the impacts of air pollution in india according to a survey by the health effects institute
that is about a quarter of the total number of air pollution deaths worldwide it said
in new delhi levels of the most dangerous particles in the air are sometimes times higher than the safe limit the survey noted
srivastava and dhupar both grew up in new delhi which the world health organization in declared the most polluted city in the world
sachan comes from allahabad the third most polluted city in who s rankings
earlier i remember there were a lot less cars on the road there was a lot less congestion and a lot more greenery said dhupar chakr s chief technology officer
but as trees were felled and roads widened to accommodate more cars dhupar then in high school developed chronic respiratory problems
doctors put him on medication and warned him to stop playing sports
my problem is whenever i start to run out of air the anxiety levels shoot up he said
dhupar said many of his family and friends have also developed respiratory issues
diesel exhaust contributed to just percent of all air pollution deaths in india in according to the health effects institute
but in confined spaces in urban areas where many generators are used it represents a larger risk said pankaj sadavarte one of the report s researchers
india has in place policies to monitor and restrict air pollution but they can be difficult to enforce experts say
worries about air pollution are growing however
last november the capital launched its first air quality emergency action plan during a particularly hazardous week when pollution spiked
the government halted construction within the city raised parking fees to discourage driving and shut schools to keep children indoors
the national ministry of environment forest and climate change is drafting a national policy to clean india s air though its release has been delayed said sunil dahiya a senior campaigner with greenpeace india
the air pollution debate and health debate is picking up in india dahiya said in a telephone interview
that momentum is forcing the policymakers to make our cities more reporting by huizhong wu editing by laurie goering please credit the thomson reuters foundation the charitable arm of thomson reuters that covers humanitarian news climate change resilience women rights trafficking and property rights
