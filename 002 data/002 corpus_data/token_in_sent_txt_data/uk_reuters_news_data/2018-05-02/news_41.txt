reden looks to m&a to take advantage of france's solar push
paris reuters reden solar a niche solar energy player backed by private equity funds is looking to buy solar projects to take advantage of a government push to boost renewable energy in france
france has been a laggard in renewables as its relies on nuclear for about three quarters of its electricity needs
but this could change now president emmanuel macron has made solar energy the focus of french renewable energy policies
against this backdrop reden hopes to grow quickly rather than risk being swallowed by big companies like engie or total
with the financial clout of our shareholders we can grow
if a company comes on the market we could be interested reden ceo thierry carcel said
an ipo is a possibility though there are no plans currently
based in agen southern france reden split off from renewables group fonroche last year when infrastructure fund infravia bought a percent stake alongside listed investment company eurazeo which has percent
reden has a percent market share of france s solar market with megawatts of installed capacity
this puts it in the top ten in a country where market leader edf energies nouvelles megawatt accounts for only about percent of total capacity according to consultancy finergreen
france had just gigawatts gw of solar capacity installed at the end of compared to germany s gw
but utility edf plans to build gw by and the french government has doubled tender volume for solar projects sparking a race for size among the many medium size companies in the industry
there are four to six significant players left in france including reden
the small ones will be eaten maybe by total maybe by us said infravia ceo vincent levita
infravia which manages billion euros billion of assets in sold stakes in solar firms soparsol and soley after holding on to them for about five years
we are ready to follow reden if it makes acquisitions said renaud haberkorn head of eurazeo patrimoine one of the funds under eurazeo which has billion euros under management in total
finergreen ceo damien ricordeau sees rapid consolidation in the next year with the top solar firms capturing percent of installed capacity
things are moving fast we expect of the top players will disappear by ricordeau said
since france s energy giants have been slow to invest in solar about the only way to catch up is through m a
engie in bought solairedirect
total in september bought into renewables firm eren and last month bought power retailer direct energie which itself had just bought solar and wind firm quadran
funds and foreign groups are also on the acquisition trail
since october denmark s renewable energy investment firm obton bought coruscant ireland s power firm amarenco bought groupe carr√© and french solar firm tenergie linked up with credit agricole
reden which has equity of about million euros plans to double its installed capacity and has a pipeline of mw solar projects in france and overseas
its overseas projects mostly solar include mw in mexico mw in chile mw in puerto rico and last week it bought mw in portugal
in france it mainly puts panels on rooftops
