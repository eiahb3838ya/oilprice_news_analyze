turkmenistan seeks to tap into east-west cargo flows with new seaport
turkmenbashi turkmenistan reuters turkmenistan on wednesday opened a new billion cargo and passenger seaport on the caspian sea aiming to boost its export revenues by handling shipping traffic between asia and europe
the central asian country s main source of hard currency is its gas exports which took a hit when russia once its main customer stopped all purchases in after a pricing dispute
the port in the city of turkmenbashi will more than triple turkmenistan s cargo handling capacity to million tonnes a year the government has said
speaking before the official opening ceremony turkmen president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov said ashgabat was ready to discuss the use of the seaport with its landlocked neighbors a reference to uzbekistan and afghanistan
turkmenistan already has a railway link with china through neighboring kazakhstan and the new port could help ashgabat win a slice of cargo flows moving between china the middle east and europe
russia azerbaijan kazakhstan and iran also have caspian ports
the new port also has container handling facilities and a polypropylene terminal which will handle products from a nearby plant which is set to be launched later this year
