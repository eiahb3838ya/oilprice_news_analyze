update 2-eu launches battle for bigger post-brexit budget
brussels reuters the european commission proposed a bigger new budget on wednesday that will trigger battles among member states over how to fill the funding gap left by britain s exit next year
the dutch led the charge for rich northern states unwilling to step into the brexit breach a smaller eu should have a smaller budget prime minister mark rutte said
against that france s agriculture minister called it simply unthinkable to shave percent off brussels hefty spending on farm subsidies
poland which the commission has in its sights with a new mechanism to penalize authoritarian governments that impinge on independent judges warned of a long road ahead to reach the unanimous compromise required to put the budget into effect
germany the biggest paymaster was cautious repeating its readiness like france to spend more but only if it was fair
with today s proposal we have put forward a pragmatic plan for how to do more with less commission president juncker told the european parliament in launching the proposal to spend about percent more in as a share of output
among highlights are sharp increases in spending on border defenses against illegal immigration as well as on foreign aid plus more investment in common eu defense schemes research and technology and on helping euro zone governments in difficulty
his plan to spend about percent of the nations combined economic production compare to percent of the multiannual financial framework now in place
it is worth trillion euros trillion adjusting for future inflation or trillion euros at today s prices about billion euros a year compared to billion now
that the commission argues will be less than a daily cup of coffee for million europeans and is cheap at the price
national governments typically tax and spend times as much
the proposal asks member states to let brussels raise new money directly from new taxes on plastics designed also to help the environment and on big global tech firms
but it will also require governments in the wealthier west to chip in more as britain stops paying its annual billion euros or so
some will also see eu rebates phased out over five years
a budget for a europe that protects empowers and defends was the commission s chosen slogan for the day
that language reflects a campaign from brussels to persuade voters the bloc remains relevant after a decade of crisis that has seen ferocious austerity in countries hit by the euro zone debt crisis and uproar over the arrival of more than a million irregular migrants across the mediterranean in alone
a europe that protects has also become a familiar demand from french president emmanuel macron as he tries to work with german chancellor angela merkel to tighten integration after the british have left while easing fears among voters that the eu means open borders and jobs exported abroad
furious battles among member governments however may cast a shadow over the commission s efforts to patch over rifts as juncker tries to rally east and west north and south big and small states behind a relaunch next year
eu budget commissioner guenther oettinger who has called for states to show unprecedented speed and agree the budget within a year or so said it was inevitable that there will be disputes there will be cuts which many countries will complain about he told german television
and there will be new spending which the others will complain additional reporting by robin emmott foo yun chee bartunek gabriela baczynska peter maushagen and alissa de carbonnel editing by philip blenkinsop and richard balmforth
