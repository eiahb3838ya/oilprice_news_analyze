focus-two u.s. coal miners see growth amid sector's gloom
reuters electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their power generators in the coming years extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry
but not every coal company sees a bleak future
ramaco resources which produces coal for steel mills and consol energy which supplies coal to larger power plants have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks
president donald trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation
but the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy
their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline
ramaco for example expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth despite the slump in demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators
and consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of power into a strength it has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close
we can sell every ounce of coal we can produce said david khani consol s chief financial officer
this isn t true for consol which mines thermal coal for power plants in pennsylvania boosted capital spending last year by percent to million and it aims to bump that to million in according to its filings
ramaco meanwhile more than tripled capital expenditures in to million making it one of the few coal producers investing in new mines
the company went public in february at a tough time for the industry
those spending increases far outpace the broader sector
overall the coal industry increased capital spending in by about percent according to a reuters analysis of filings from miners a rebound from years of steep declines targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding
many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending
they re spending as much as they need to to maintain production said analyst john bridges of jp morgan
coal production is expected to dip percent in to million tons down from billion tons a decade ago according to the energy information administration
ramaco s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in west virginia virginia and pennsylvania said randall atkins ramaco s executive chairman
the company expects to produce more than million tons of coal in from less than in
the company said the downturn in the thermal coal industry has little to do with its business
it and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe
met coal is a proxy for steel which is in turn a proxy for a nation s gdp atkins said
the world finds itself economically in a good he said trump s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market but that foreign demand for exports also remains strong
ramaco s share price has been volatile since launching last year
it is trading at about up from about late last year after strong earnings estimates
but that s only about half of its share price last year in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed
most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered meanwhile by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls
consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn
it plans to serve very large retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired said cfo khani
those plants are currently running at only about percent capacity he said providing room for growth
the eia predicts that generators that remain open could operate above percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close
plants are using less than percent of their capacity now
consol whose shares are up to about a share from about late last year supplies east coast power generating companies including dominion southern duke and dte
both consol and ramaco applaud the trump administration s stance but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere
there has been no legislation that would allow for increasing domestic demand for coal said ramaco s atkins
