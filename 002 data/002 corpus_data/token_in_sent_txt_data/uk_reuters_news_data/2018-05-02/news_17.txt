midland texas reuters this may story has been refiled to correct name of professor to lutz kilian not kilian lutz in thirteenth paragraph
in west texas rising oil prices are fueling a sharp economic upswing lifting employment and pay to records driving up spending at hotels restaurants and car dealerships and raising the cost of housing and other essentials
this parched patch of land under which lies the largest rock formations in the united states is the epicenter of a growth binge that shows just how tight the link remains between low unemployment rising wages and upward pricing pressure
after a crash the price of crude began to recover in and pierced a barrel early this year
but oil is still far cheaper than at the peak of the previous boom that began in north dakota s bakken oil patch and supercharged the city of williston
in the permian basin which stretches across west texas and eastern new mexico the latest boom is being helped by advances in technology that allow drillers to extract much more from each acre
is like the new said dallas fed economist michael plante in a interview
breakeven costs are now as little as per barrel according to the dallas fed s most recent survey so energy companies here no longer need oil to make lots of money
and midland and its neighbor odessa the biggest towns for miles and the regional base for major oil producers in the permian basin including occidental petroleum corp chevron corp apache corp and pioneer natural resources co are feeling the surge
it is a boom says dale redman chief executive of propetro a midland texas firm that supplies horsepower to drill sites where energy companies coax crude from the ground with sand and water
he has tripled his workforce since early drawing workers from towns and cities hundreds of miles away
over half of his employees make more than
what it has done is raised wages for all these folks
but housing and the cost of living has gone up as to midland mayor jerry morales it s a good story right he says the city is trying to keep up with the drop in housing inventory and rise in rents by approving new apartment complexes and working with developers to put in water and sewer pipes
but as owner of two restaurants in town including gerardo s casita he sees the other side too
the biggest problem i face is low unemployment finding workers he said in a phone interview adding that he is increasing pay every six months to keep staff from leaving for other jobs and he is hiking his menu prices as well
investment by the energy sector for years a drag on growth has in recent quarters begun to add to it government figures show
but oil is only about percent of gdp says lutz kilian an economics professor at the university of michigan
that limits the effect of swings in the industry on the overall economy
and though exports of oil have increased helping to shrink the trade deficit in energy by half from fourth quarter to fourth quarter the improvement has had negligible impact on the much larger overall trade deficit which grew during that period
but as an object lesson in the connection between low unemployment and rising prices midland and odessa does have macroeconomic implications
on a national level wage growth and inflation have remained surprisingly subdued even after consecutive months of jobs gains and an unemployment rate of percent and expected to head still lower
if the rest of the country starts to look more like west texas then we will certainly see stronger wage gains nationally said david berson chief economist for nationwide mutual
berson predicts that when wage gains start to accelerate nationally probably by early next year they will boost inflation more than expected
oil companies are drilling wells faster and putting more wells on a single site using technology to find the best angles and depths to get the most out of each layer of shale
that has helped boost output by texas oil and gas companies to an estimated according to waco economist ray perryman
companies are making enough money to be able to afford to pay higher wages he said
unemployment was percent in odessa and percent in midland in february
average weekly earnings in march hit records in both towns which have a combined population of about
sales tax receipts have soared
you have people that move in you train them and then someone else offers them a job there is constant raiding going on says jeff sparks chief operating officer of discovery oil in midland who has only recently shifted to the more efficient and drilling techniques that have pushed extraction costs down so steeply
at the odessa car dealership the sewell family has run since colin sewell sold trucks in the first three months of this year up from last year
he is building a brand new service center on the outskirts of town
jason tarulli senior project manager at general contractor ueb is using an crew to build a downtown odessa construction project he is overseeing because local hiring would have been impossible
his costs are rising rent for a one bedroom in his building rose by more than in less than a year to
everyone who has lived here a while knows that the boom is not going to last including sondra eoff who is footing about half the million bill for the downtown project meant to help keep the town vibrant for the long run and not just during boomtimes
when there s an up there s a down she says
