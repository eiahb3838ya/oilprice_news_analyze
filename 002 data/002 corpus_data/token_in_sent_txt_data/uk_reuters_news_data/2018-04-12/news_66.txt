feature-chocolate forests: can cocoa help restore the amazon?
new brazil reuters for years valdomiro facchi has made a living ranching on land carved from the amazon rainforest
he s a small player in one of the world s biggest environmental disasters
but now that his cattle have trampled the pastures to dust and new laws prevent him from clearing fresh land he has to find new income
i want to diversify said the old rancher outlining plans to plant cocoa trees on his hectare plot in brazil s para state
i want to have the cocoa income when profit from cattle ranching facchi illustrates a trend that is turning damaged parts of the amazon basin green again and creating an usual alliance between the agriculture industry and conservationists
brazil s cattle ranchers are planting cocoa on their pasture with financial support from international environmental groups
that s a big change
for decades ranchers have been the engine of in the amazon rainforest that has rendered an area nearly the size of spain treeless
environmentalists have argued the practice destroys wildlife habitat and undermines the planet s ability to absorb carbon dioxide that causes global warming
besides being a means of avoiding deforestation cocoa plantations favor the local regional and national economy the international environmental group the nature conservancy said on its website
the young trees will also bring change to global cocoa markets
brazil s national association of the cocoa processing industry aipc expects the surge in planting to help double the country s output of the raw material in chocolate by to tonnes a year
that increase would raise global output by about percent
the renewed planting could make brazil one of the world s top three cocoa growers again after the sector was decimated in the by a crop fungus called witches broom

fifty percent of cocoa production growth will come from the amazon said eduardo bastos executive director of the aipc calling the cocoa farms there chocolate green groups like the nature conservancy and the amazon fund have helped finance new cocoa plantations
the amazon fund which was set up by brazil s government and takes international donations to combat deforestation has poured million reais million in grants into the crop
nearly square kilometers of degraded cattle pasture in brazil has been transformed into cocoa plantations already according to the aipc s bastos
cocoa planting is driven mainly by new limits on the cattle industry that have changed the financial incentives for ranchers
in the amazon pasture can become degraded in as little as three years if not managed properly making it hard to raise a thriving herd without new acreage
brazil in passed a law that allows landowners to clear only percent of their property in the amazon and requires some landowners to replant depleted areas
that law aims to curb deforestation which peaked in at a pace of square km per year
in brazilian amazon lost square km of rainforest
compared to ranching cocoa can provide income from a relatively small plot with no need for constant expansion
the profits can be up to five times better said eduardo trevisan gonçalves project manager at brazil s imaflora an environmental group that did a study comparing income from cattle and cocoa in the region
the benefits extend to the environment
cocoa plantations can imitate natural forests helping to restore native plant and wildlife species boosting water resources and absorbing carbon dioxide goncalves said
it is a perennial crop he said
it will stay there for funding from environmental groups comes with guidelines intended to boost the ecological benefits of the plantations according to josé garcia a farmer in the central pará state who is receiving a grant from the amazon fund
under the terms he said he will have to plant cocoa alongside other taller native species such as mahogany and ipê
it is recommended that cocoa be planted with other trees taller ones to benefit from the shade he said at his farm in medicilândia in para state
evidence of the shift is everywhere in the medicilândia region where barren pastures have given way to shady plantations of cocoa trees bearing yellow and ruby pods the fibrous protective coverings for the cocoa beans
in the city of medicilândia a town lined with dirt roads in para state farmers truck bags full of dried cocoa beans to warehouses bearing signs that read we buy shops nearby offer cocoa juice a thick sweet drink prepared with the fruit s pulp
brazil is an agricultural heavyweight among the world s top growers of soybeans corn sugar coffee and oranges
but it dropped from being no
in cocoa in the early after witches broom slashed its production
in para state however witches broom rarely survives long enough to damage trees
the fungus requires moist conditions and largely dies off during the annual dry season
as a result cocoa tree yields in para are nearly double the global average said bastos of the aipc
there is some evidence brazil could absorb some of this extra production euromonitor international pegs per capita chocolate consumption in brazil at just kilograms a year compared with kg in switzerland suggesting brazil s domestic chocolate market has room to grow
brazil s processing companies which transform cocoa beans into butter powder and chocolate welcome the prospect of increased domestic supply to feed their factories and lower their imports but inject a note of skepticism
olam international s cocoa vice president in brazil kidambi srinivasan for example called the tonne per year target an unlikely possibility without higher market prices and more assistance to planters in areas including financing training and supplies
benchmark cocoa prices in new york are currently running at about a tonne having bounced off a low of hit in on worries of global oversupply
other big processors in brazil include cargill which has an tonne plant in ilhéus and barry callebaut the world s biggest maker of industrial chocolate which opened its first south american chocolate facility in brazil in
for some of the the chance to undo some of the damage to the amazon caused by ranching is as important as the money they can earn from cocoa
there was a time when i thought we shouldn t have come here said elido trevisan who arrived in para to ranch in and cleared nearly percent of his land
but now he said we can do something to reais reporting by marcy nicholson in new york and marcelo teixeira in medicilandia brazil editing by simon webb richard valdmanis and brian thevenot
