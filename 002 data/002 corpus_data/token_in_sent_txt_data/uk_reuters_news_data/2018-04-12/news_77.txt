interview-edp bullish on u.s. renewable power despite trump's support for coal
washington reuters de portugal is optimistic about renewable power investments in the united states despite president donald trump s push to support coal and nuclear power plants and a tariff his administration slapped on imported solar panels its chief executive said in an interview

renewables represent the growth engine of our company ant√≥nio mexia who since has run the power utility edp one of portugal s biggest companies said in an interview on tuesday
wind and solar power projects represented percent of new investments last year at edp s renewables arm edpr and are expected to continue at that rate in and in mexia said
edpr operates renewable projects in other countries in europe and the americas
this month edpr and four other companies joined with a northern california power provider to develop an offshore wind farm with advanced floating turbines expected to have the capacity to generate between to megawatts mw
the group is talking with fishing industry and department of defense representatives about locations for the wind farm
mexia said floating technology needs to be proven commercially but tests for the last five years off the coast of portugal have shown the floating turbines which use technology similar to floating oil rigs have survived waves up to feet m high
traditional offshore wind power surprised everybody and i am sure floating offshore will do the same mexia said
the advantage of floating platforms to be placed about miles km offshore in deep water is their increased efficiency which he expects will reach between and percent of rated peak capacity
that s up from about percent efficiency which the energy information administration said was the wind power industry s average in
edpr also invests in solar power but its latest project is carefully planned to begin operations after the phase out of a tariff on imported solar panels that trump signed into law on
the percent tariff on the panels drops to percent a few years later before being phased out entirely
edpr has secured a mw power purchase agreement on the solar project with hoosier energy rural electric cooperative in indiana with the start of operations expected in
mexia who was in washington for a summit of leaders of the global electric power industry said he is confident wind power will thrive in the united states because there are nearly plants and companies that make parts or source parts for turbines ensuring the renewables sector has broad support nationwide
coal will have a role in the near future he said but eventually he expects it is an industry that will disappear despite efforts by the trump administration to slash regulations on coal and to use subsidies to support struggling power plants that burn the fossil fuel
coal was an important resource domestically for edp last year
edp posted a profit after its revenue fell percent as a severe drought in portugal and spain sapped its reservoirs for hydropower and forced it to resort to more expensive power generation including coal and combined cycle plants the company said in march
despite the trump administration s policies to support coal and nuclear plants mexia sees the united states a preferable place to invest in renewables than many countries in europe
and mexia is hopeful that trump s policies will not spark a trade war with china that could affect edp
the company s biggest shareholder is china three gorges a chinese power company which owns a nearly percent stake
it s a game where nobody wins mexia said of trade wars
