interview-energy access for all needed for "true democracy" in india
oxford england april thomson reuters foundation an indian street vendor taught harish hande his most important financial lesson and sent him on a mission to create affordable energy solutions that work for the poorest people in the world s largest democracy
too many innovations ask the poor for a relatively large sum upfront for example for solar panels that they can ill afford said harish hande of selco which has pioneered the delivery of decentralised solar energy to the poor in india
the street vendor told me i can t afford rupees a month but rupees a day i can manage hande told the thomson reuters foundation on thursday after receiving the skoll award for social entrepreneurship
by providing the street vendor with solar lighting that he could afford by paying a small amount every day selco helped sustain a he said
some million indians have no access to power and millions more in the country of billion live with spotty supplies of electricity from an unreliable power grid according to the international energy agency
the poorest spend a much higher proportion of their income on energy because they can t afford to buy machines and lighting so they keep using kerosene which is expensive dangerous and bad for the environment said hande
hande has been on a mission for more than years to change that by working directly with people in villages towns and cities to find out what technologies they need and how they can finance them
a approach won t work if you re a blacksmith your needs are different from a roti maker
but that is not well understood
so we ask people what exactly do you need in your home or to run your business he said
access to reliable energy is not just about providing electricity he said
it s a catalyst for true democracy in india for providing business opportunities
with reliable and affordable energy everyone has the chance to run a business he said
hande has turned the business into an umbrella of organisations each tasked with addressing gaps in energy access through marketing selling installing and servicing products in homes schools and health centres across india
hande estimates selco has reached million people in india and the model is being replicated in the philippines and tanzania
