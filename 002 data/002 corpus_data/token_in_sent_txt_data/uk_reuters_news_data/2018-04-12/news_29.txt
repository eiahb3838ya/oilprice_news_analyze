update 2-opec sees oil markets tighten further even as u.s. shale booms
delhi reuters the global oil stocks surplus is close to evaporating opec said on thursday citing healthy energy demand and its own supply cuts while revising up its forecast for production from rivals who have benefited from higher oil prices
shale oil output has been booming over the past year since opec reduced its own production in tandem with russia to prop up global oil prices
but as oil production collapsed in opec member venezuela and is still facing hiccups in countries such as libya and angola the oil exporters group is still producing below its targets meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand

the figure is below the million bpd that opec sees as demand for its crude for the whole of
opec russia and several other producers began to cut supply in january
the pact runs until the end of the year and opec meets in vienna in june to decide on its next course of action
opec s leader saudi arabia has said it would like the pact to be extended into
there is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond barkindo told reuters
russia will continue to play a leading on thursday opec also revised its forecast for supply growth from its rivals which is now forecast to grow by a further barrels per day this year to million bpd driven largely by growth in the first quarter in the united states and the former soviet union
at the same time it increased its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year by bpd to million bpd
this mainly reflects the positive momentum in the oecd in the on the back of data and supported by development in industrial activities weather and strong mining activities in the oecd americas and the oecd asia pacific it said in the monthly market report
