rpt-analysis-thai energy companies roll out expansions across southeast asia
repeats item with no changes to text policy support incentives propelled growth in thai energy firms energy company ipos raised over billion in companies invest abroad to secure growth as local demand slows by chayut setboonsarng and henning gloystein april reuters thai energy companies are on a roll
the national oil and gas champion a coal miner and power utility upstart solar and wind companies virtually all are expanding across southeast asia applying practices and technology developed at home
thailand is reaping the benefits of two decades of government energy policies that have supported the sector
companies are also profiting from oil and gas prices that are recovering from a slump increasing electricity demand due to economic growth and renewable technologies that have become competitive against fossil fuels
also while the military junta that has ruled thailand since has put no stamp of its own on the energy sector it has targeted infrastructure spending to boost the economy and prioritised investment in industries
reform policies have turned thailand s state energy company ptt into a successful international oil and gas producer encouraged the development of power producers such as electricity generating and fostered the emergence of renewable like energy absolute
the power businesses in thailand have developed expertise in this sector and are now well placed to support energy development across the region said robert grant asia pacific head at an engineering and construction firm focused on energy infrastructure and mining
the members of the association of southeast asian nations asean together have a population of more than million people with a collective gross domestic product gdp of nearly trillion according to research company statista
asean s energy use rose by percent in the last years according to the international energy agency iea which also says the region s demand could grow another by
companies aiming to take part in the growth in asean and beyond include power a thai power developer that already has assets in vietnam and laos and banpu power which is building a plant in china
you can already see increased activity by thai investors in the asean region grant said
the expansion has been reflected in the local stock exchange with shares of energy companies growing nearly percent since the start of against a broader market gain of less than half that
it s also sparked a rash of listings with thai power companies having raised more than billion from initial public offerings ipos in and
thailand s generator gulf energy in december held the biggest listing the country has seen in a decade at more than million
gulf has said it expects revenue to grow by percent this year fuelled in part by a major solar investment in vietnam
the ipo funds will be used to repay loans and finance new regional power plants it says
government policy created an ecosystem for growth for thai energy companies said maria lapiz head of institutional research at maybank kim eng securities with the first reforms coming in the
that s when the government began allowing small power generators megawatts to sell to the national grid
thailand was also an earlier adopter of natural gas which now generates about percent of its electricity
in thailand was one of asia s first countries to introduce tariffs to give solar developers additional payments on top of normal prices when selling electricity to utilities channelling investment into the sector
similar tariffs have been applied to other renewable power sources including wind hydro biomass and biogas
the privatisation of ptt was another big boost to the energy sector
the government now holds a percent stake in ptt which operates as a private company with less political interference than state rivals like malaysia s petronas and indonesia s pertamina both of which remain under full government control
ptt was privatised in which helped drive growth in the energy sector from e p to refiners and helped in the development of the thai capital market said lapiz
the growth trend is clearest in renewables where thailand is the first southeast asia nation to crack the top solar power generators according to the international renewable energy agency irena
thailand started development in renewable power much earlier than regional peers said thidasiri srisamith chief investment officer of kasikorn asset management
thanks to the early start and good relationships with neighbouring governments thailand is a leader in cambodia laos myanmar and vietnam and will continue to expand into these countries she said
thailand s largest solar company superblock plans to branch out with a billion investment into wind farms in vietnam
and thailand s biggest wind power generator wind energy holdings plans to invest in solar hydro and biomass to back up its capacity not just locally but also in vietnam cambodia laos myanmar bangladesh and australia
even in coal a sector recently shunned due to public pressure to invest in cleaner energy thai firms are growing
miner banpu in february reported a more than percent surge in annual profit partly because of new coal mine investments including in indonesia and power projects in china and japan
in oil and gas ptt long the global carrier of the thai exploration and production flag is developing new assets in the region for the first time in years with around billion in cash on hand to invest at home and overseas
not all indicators point to an ongoing boom
local consumption is stalling due to low population growth and improvements in energy efficiency while domestic capacity is sufficient to meet basic requirements
going forward thai power company growth will depend on the ability to secure capacity and have a steady stream of projects which are increasingly coming from overseas said kasikorn s thidasiri
