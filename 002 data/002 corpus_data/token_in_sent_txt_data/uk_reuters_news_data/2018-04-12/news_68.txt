australia's agl to host coal-to-liquid hydrogen export trial for japan's kawasaki heavy
trial set for australia s biggest power plant designed to create a new export industry for australia japan exploring clean energy alternatives to nuclear by byron kaye sydney april reuters japan s kawasaki heavy industries ltd will use a power station owned by top australian electricity producer agl energy ltd for a trial of hydrogen conversion the companies and the australian government said on thursday
if successful the companies said they would build a facility at agl s massive loy yang power station australia s biggest
success could also establish a new export industry for the country extracting hydrogen from coal then converting it to liquid for export to japan
the trial comes amid a clash between agl and the australian government over energy policy
agl wants to close power stations and become a percent renewable energy firm by while the conservative government wants to reinforce a secure baseload energy supply following a string of major blackouts in recent years
meanwhile japan is keen to develop new clean energy sources amid uncertainty about its future use of nuclear power in the wake of the march disaster at the fukushima daiichi plant
it is critically important that we invest in the energy sources of the future and we effect the transition from older forms of generation to new forms of generation and we do so seamlessly said australian prime minister malcolm turnbull speaking at the loy yang site in southeastern victoria
turnbull said his government was contributing a million million to the trial which would create local jobs
the companies involved in the project didn t disclose details of their own investment
engineering group kawasaki heavy has been keen to tap the hydrogen market and has been looking at using brown coal from victoria where supplies are plentiful
but it has hedged its bets with a project in norway to derive hydrogen using power from hydroelectric dams and eventually wind farms
using australian coal requires removing its carbon and burying it in old oil or gas wells there
for the trial kawasaki heavy has also teamed up with japan s marubeni corp systems corp and iwatani the global hydrogen market is booming said kawasaki heavy s eiichi harada deputy general manager of the firm corporate technology division in a joint statement released on behalf of the companies involved
the project has the potential to deliver a critical option for future global energy needs he said
if the pilot is successful the project would enter its commercial phase in the according to the statement
the project is a major turning point for ccs carbon capture storage in australia by securing jobs sustaining communities and paving the way for a global hydrogen economy that combats climate change the global ccs institute said
but green lobby group environment victoria rejected claims the project would promote clean energy
japan doesn t want dirty hydrogen
they want clean hydrogen but today s announcement simply creates a plant that will dirty hydrogen environment victoria campaigns manager nicholas aberle said in a statement
