update 1-iran tells france not to be influenced by saudi prince on nuclear deal
ankara reuters iran urged france on thursday not to be influenced by saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman over tehran s nuclear deal with world powers the tasnim news agency reported
the statement came after the prince who is also defence minister of iran s main regional rival appeared to chide french president emmanuel macron this week for supporting the deal to lift most economic sanctions on iran in exchange for curbs to tehran s nuclear programme
as one of the signatories of the deal france should avoid being influenced by the adventurous salman and avoid listening to riyadh s repetitive and false claims against the deal iran s foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi said
macron speaking at a joint press conference with the prince in paris on tuesday said he thought iran s regional influence needed to be checked but did not think the nuclear deal should be ripped up
the prince responded i hope the president isn t upset with me with what i am about to say but we do not want to repeat the deal made in which resulted in the start of world war in an apparent reference to the munich appeasement deal with hitler
