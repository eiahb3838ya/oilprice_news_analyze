shell sees no risk of "stranded assets" as reserves life shrinks
london reuters royal dutch shell said on thursday it saw little risk of having stranded assets in its portfolio as the world shifts to low carbon energy because the oil major will have of its current oil and gas reserves extracted before anyway
shell has one of the lowest reserves life ratio among its peers and last year it saw reserves plunging to new lows after divesting a large number of assets
the major now sits on billion barrels of oil equivalent down from billion at the end of and enough to sustain the current annual production of billion barrels for less than nine years
reserves life has long been one of the key metrics monitored by investors to assess oil firms future resilience
long reserve life was especially important during years when oil was seen as a finite asset and analysts predominantly believed in the theory of peak oil suggesting the world will soon run out of good oil reserves
but as the united states the world s largest oil consumer discovered at the start of this decade it had abundant reserves of shale oil and as demand patterns also began to shift toward greener energy the peak oil theory faded
instead it was replaced by a peak demand theory suggesting oil consumption will plateau and start declining soon due to electric vehicles while large quantities of oil will not be produced and remain stranded under the ground
in such circumstances having a short reserve life arguably makes more strategic sense as it allows companies to adjust faster to quickly changing consumption patterns
shell said its assessments indicated a low risk of stranded assets in the current portfolio
as of december shell estimates that around percent of its current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by and only percent after that time it said
it said it was confident it would thrive through potential changes in the energy system to while growing new businesses to reduce costs and improve emissions
the company is expanding in the power market
this includes investments in areas such as wind generation in the netherlands supplying power to retail customers in the uk and offering hydrogen refuelling and longer term there is great uncertainty in how the energy transition will unfold but shell believes its strategic flexibility will allow it to adapt in step with out of shell s total proved reserves of billion barrels oil constitutes billion synthetic canadian crude another billion barrels while the rest is natural gas
shell has previously announced ambition to reduce net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells by around half by
the plan is fairly unique for the industry as it covers not only emissions from the production of energy products but also those from the consumption of shell s products by its customers
