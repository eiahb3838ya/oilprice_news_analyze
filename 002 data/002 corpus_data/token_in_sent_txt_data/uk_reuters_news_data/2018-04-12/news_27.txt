column-opec switches operational target from inventories to investment: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own comments by opec ministers by john kemp london april reuters opec appears to be reformulating its target in terms of upstream investment rather than oil inventories according to an analysis of recent statements made by ministers from member countries
there is no such thing as a target price by saudi arabia the kingdom s energy minister khalid told reporters on wednesday saudi arabia happy with oil market won t let another glut form reuters april
we re seeing production in many regions declining
the only way to offset this is for the financial markets to start financing and funding upstream projects falih observed
i don t know what is the price that will provide that equilibrium
all we know is in we re still not seeing falih s comments suggest the kingdom is now targeting a sustainable level of exploration and production and prices will have to rise further to incentivise it
the new weight attached to sustainable investment echoes comments made by other ministers from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries in recent weeks
we will know we have a good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments
we need to have more investments coming the uae energy minister said on april uae says producers trying to define structure for alliance reuters april
there has been a clear recovery in oil prices
but it has not been met with an increase in investments investment has been very low qatar s energy minister said on april
investors are still cautious and
we need to restore investments he added qatar says too early to exit opec oil cuts as investment still low reuters april
the emphasis on investment stands in marked contrast to the previous focus on reducing oil inventories in the oecd industrialised countries to the average
almost the single metric that we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the oecd inventories falih said as recently as december
the recent shift from inventories to investment is consistent across multiple ministers which suggests it is the result of private discussions within opec
focusing on investment is not new for the organisation
the need for prices high enough to support sustainable investment in production has been acknowledged since opec was created
opec s founding statute approved in commits the organisation to stabilising prices securing a steady income for producing countries and ensuring a fair return on capital to investors in the petroleum industry
opec members have often stated the need for security of demand and for prices to be high enough to justify investment in new capacity
as a practical matter the overriding target for opec members has always been to maximise government revenues from the sale of petroleum
but the organisation has rarely stated its objective so bluntly and has normally preferred to declare a less controversial intermediate or operational target such as tax rates sustainable investment inventories or price stability
in the early years opec began by focusing on raising royalties and tax rates then increasing prices and obtaining equity ownership of oil production
by the early opec members had obtained complete ownership of production on their territories and the focus shifted more explicitly to revenue maximisation
since that time opec has alternated regularly between trying to raise prices and trying to protect its market share against rivals
in the most recent cycle opec focused on maintaining prices above per barrel between and the middle of
from to opec switched to defending market share against competition from shale and other producers and was prepared to allow prices to slump to protect its exports
since the end of opec s priority has reverted to raising prices and it has been willing to sacrifice some market share to attain that goal
average in the early stages of its current strategy opec formulated its goal in terms of the need to reduce excess inventories that had built up during the slump
higher prices were merely an incidental benefit of cutting stockpiles back towards the average at least in theory
in practice higher prices and revenues have been the main benefit of the strategy with benchmark brent prices increasing from to since opec announced it would cut production
inventories are now close to the average and have actually fallen below it in terms of forward cover but opec members still appear to want to continue curbing output and raising prices
so the inventory target has been swapped for an investment objective to justify continued production restraint
saudi officials remain coy about the kingdom s target for oil prices and the energy minister has flatly denied there is one
but the kingdom s comments and supply behaviour suggest it is reasonable to infer that it has an undeclared target of around per barrel saudi arabia signals ambition for oil price bloomberg april
prices around would balance the kingdom s budget help pay for the government s ambitious reform programme and make it easier to achieve a notional trillion valuation when shares in state oil producer saudi aramco are sold
opec s ambitions for prices have steadily increased from around to and now over the last months based on comments made by ministers and other senior officials
the escalation in the organisation s price target fits a familiar pattern in which the more prices rise the more opec hopes they will increase further
for opec members the sustainable equilibrium price is almost always at least higher than the current price
but by chasing higher prices the organisation risks increasing rival supplies from shale and other producers as well as slower growth in oil consumption
opec members have said they want to see more investment but that implies higher output from shale as well as other sources
before prices dropped in june the problem was too much investment which had caused excessive supply growth and created the conditions for the slump
by pushing for higher prices opec may be on the verge of making the same mistake again
