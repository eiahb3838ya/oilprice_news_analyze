australian pm says foreign interference bill has soured ties with china
sydney april reuters australian prime minister malcolm turnbull acknowledged on thursday that legislation aimed at preventing foreign interference in politics had soured ties with china after a report australian ministers were being denied chinese visas
relations between australia and its largest trading partner have been strained over the past year partly over australian concern about rising chinese influence which led to the introduction of legislation banning foreign political donations
the australian financial review citing unidentified sources said this week china had denied visas to australian government officials to attend a major annual trade show denting close economic ties between the two countries
there s clearly been some tension in the relationship following the introduction of our legislation about foreign interference but i m very confident that any misunderstandings will be resolved turnbull told radio in melbourne
he declined to comment when asked about the report that australian ministers were being denied visas
the foreign ministry did not respond to emailed requests for comment
late last year turnbull referred to disturbing reports about chinese influence and warned of foreign powers unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process
the australian legislation which is expected to be passed soon also requires the registration of lobbyists working for foreign countries
china bought a billion billion worth of australian goods and services last year but trade ties are only one side of a delicate balancing act for australia whose unshakeable security relationship with the united states has limited how close it gets with china
encouraged by the united states australia has sharpened its criticism of china s activities in the pacific and the south china sea
australia s international development minister concetta in january accused china of funding roads to nowhere and useless buildings in the pacific amid fears canberra s historical dominance in the region was eroding
