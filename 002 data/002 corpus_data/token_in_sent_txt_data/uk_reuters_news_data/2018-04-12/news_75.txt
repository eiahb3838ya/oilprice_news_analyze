trump administration weighs high-ethanol fuel waiver to placate farmers
new york april reuters the trump administration is considering allowing the sale of a higher ethanol fuel blend in the summer a source familiar with the issue said a move that would placate corn growers worried about the future of biofuels policy
president donald trump recently met with the heads of the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture to discuss ways to make the renewable fuel standard less expensive to the oil industry without undercutting demand for ethanol
the rfs requires refiners to add increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel supply each year which is a boon to farmers but a headache for refining companies that must either blend the fuels themselves or purchase credits from those who do
trump has tried in vain over the past several months to broker a deal between big oil and big corn over the issue and has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers in the midwest who are concerned that he will weaken domestic demand for ethanol at a time farmers are already facing a potential trade war with china that could hurt export demand for corn and soybeans
sources had told reuters this week that trump was temporarily suspending his consideration of a refining proposal to cap prices for blending credits an idea that the biofuels industry has opposed as damaging to farmers
but in the meantime the administration is considering moving forward with plans to allow for the ethanol industry s long sought waiver to sell gasoline containing percent ethanol in the summer instead of the usual percent blend the source familiar with the issue told reuters on wednesday
the higher ethanol blend called is currently banned by the environmental protection agency due to concerns it contributes to smog on hot days a worry that biofuels advocates say is baseless
if done soon the waiver could be in effect in time for the summer driving season
epa spokeswoman liz bowman did not immediately respond to a request for comment
white house spokeswoman kelly love did not comment on the waiver but said that during trump s meeting monday he instructed his cabinet to continue to explore options that protect american farmers and america s refinery biofuels proponents have heaped pressure on the white house after reports that the epa was granting dozens of small refineries exemptions from the rfs to help them avoid the costs of compliance something the ethanol industry says will weaken demand for their product
on monday trump acknowledged farmers may bear the brunt of the economic harm if china retaliates against washington s threat of tariffs noting that we ll make it up to them
many farmers are battling debt after years of excess global supplies and depressed prices
we need some good news out here said monte shaw the executive director of the iowa renewable fuels association
the best news trump could give us right now is sales of he said
