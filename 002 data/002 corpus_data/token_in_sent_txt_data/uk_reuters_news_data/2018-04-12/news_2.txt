update 4-in boost for farmers, trump says he may allow e15 gasoline sales all year
washington reuters president donald trump said on thursday his administration may allow the sale of gasoline containing percent ethanol which could help farmers by firing up corn demand but faces opposition from big oil
the proposal marks the latest move by the trump administration to navigate the rival oil and corn constituencies as they clash over the nation s biofuels policy
oil refiners say the renewable fuel standard requiring them to add biofuels into gasoline is costly and displaces petroleum while the farm sector says the law provides critical support to growers
the environmental protection agency currently bans the higher ethanol blend called during summer because of concerns it contributes to smog on hot days a worry biofuels advocates say is unfounded
gasoline typically contains just percent ethanol
we re going to be going probably probably to and we re going to be going to a period trump told reporters during a white house meeting
we re going to work out something during the transition period which is not easy very earlier on thursday epa spokeswoman liz bowman said the agency has been assessing the legal validity of granting an waiver since last summer and is awaiting an outcome from discussions with the white house the department of agriculture and congress before making any final decisions
monte shaw executive director of the iowa renewable fuels association said the proposed shift to sales would be very exciting it would be a great morale boost for rural america and more importantly a real demand boost if it can be moved forward quickly he said in an interview
under the rfs the epa sets the volume of ethanol and other biofuels that must be mixed into the nation s fuel supply on a yearly basis and a move to expand sales could encourage the epa to set those volumes higher in coming years
currently refiners are required to blend around billion gallons of ethanol into the nation s fuel annually
shares of major biofuels producers rose slightly after the announcement
archer daniels midland co shares gained percent to close at
it was unclear however whether the move would help the refining sector which has been lobbying hard instead for a cap on the price of blending credits that refiners must acquire to prove compliance with the rfs
greater blending of ethanol through sales would theoretically increase supplies of the tradable credits and thus reduce prices
but at the same time more ethanol translates to a smaller share of fuel in american gas tanks which would hurt refiner sales
the american petroleum institute which represents big oil companies issued a statement opposing trump s proposal to expand sales arguing that fuel can damage engines and is incompatible with certain boats motorcycles and lawn mowers
the industry plans to consider all options to prevent such a waiver
the rfs is broken and we continue to believe the best solution is comprehensive legislation api downstream group director frank macchiarola said in the statement
refiners shares were mixed after trump s comments with andeavor closing down percent at and valero energy corp up percent at
bids for benchmark blending credits slipped to cents on thursday afternoon after deals were struck at cents ahead of the announcement a trader said
