uk signals plan to leave eu emissions trading scheme after brexit
london reuters britain is likely to leave the european union s emissions trading system ets after brexit and set up its own equivalent system uk government documents published late wednesday show
that would mean britain sticking to its international obligations to cut carbon emissions and would avoid uk firms gaining a competitive advantage but could hit the price of eu carbon permits as britain is currently such a big buyer
london and brussels agreed on wednesday a draft deal over the terms of britain leaving the bloc on march
that included a transitional period until meaning britain would likely remain in the ets until then
the documents showed britain would after brexit continue to take the necessary measures to meet its commitments under the international paris climate agreement
these include implementing a system of carbon pricing at least as effective as that currently in place under eu law establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the community the documents said
britain is the emitter of greenhouse gases in europe and its utilities and industry are among the largest buyers of permits in the ets which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit
as britain is such a big buyer of ets permits analysts have said britain s exit from the scheme would likely hit the price of permits
on thursday the benchmark european carbon contract was down more than percent at
britain s carbon price is currently made up of two levies a domestic carbon tax set at pounds per tonne paid by electricity generators on top of obligations under the ets which forces companies to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of they emit
in a separate document on britain s future relationship with the eu london said it would consider cooperation on carbon pricing by linking a united kingdom national greenhouse gas emissions trading system with the union s emissions trading industry group the international emissions trading association ieta welcomed britain s intention to use a trading scheme for carbon pricing rather than a tax
a market would bring the benefits of being able to guarantee the delivery of internationally agreed climate targets at lowest cost said ieta eu policy director simon henry
prime minister theresa may faces a battle to get the draft brexit deal approved by british lawmakers and it could yet fail after two senior ministers quit over the deal s terms
without a brexit deal britain would automatically leave the ets and replace its costs with a carbon tax set at pounds a tonne
