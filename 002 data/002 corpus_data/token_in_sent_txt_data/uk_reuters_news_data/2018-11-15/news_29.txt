australian power grid prepared for hot summer, operator says
melbourne nov reuters australia has readied its stretched power grid to cope with a summer with extra electricity supply lined up for the system in case of disruptions the energy market operator said in a statement on friday
this is the second year the australian energy market operator aemo has taken extra steps to prepare for summer by beefing up power reserves to offset intermittent wind and solar generators and outages at ageing plants
blackouts hit the country s southeastern states in and the worst of which hit the entire state of south australia and shut top global miner bhp s olympic dam copper mine for two weeks costing it million
the bureau of meteorology is forecasting a hotter and drier summer which coupled with other risks we have identified suggests we have a challenging summer awaiting us aemo chief executive audrey zibelman said
australian power demand typically soars in the southern hemisphere summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning
at the same time generation transmission and distribution networks can be hit by bushfires and storms
australia s bureau of meteorology said in a seasonal forecast on thursday that the summer will be hotter than normal
days and nights are likely for almost all of australia for december to february it said
aemo said in august the states of victoria and south australia were most at risk for outages this summer with some threat in the most populous state of new south wales where drought has depleted hydropower dams
to help prevent blackouts the operator has secured megawatts mw of reserve power in part by making agreements with some energy users to curb use when supplies are tight
aemo is confident the plans we have made have appropriately equipped us to tackle any unforeseen events the upcoming summer might bring zibelman said in the statement
last summer lining up and activating reserve supplies cost the market operator a million million which it then passed on in fees to customers in south australia and victoria
costs for the reserves are expected to fall this year aemo said partly because it has not had to line up as much supply as last year as mw of new generation capacity has come onto the market over the past year
australia s drought is not expected to impact power generation this summer aemo said
