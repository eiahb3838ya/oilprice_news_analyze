update 3-uk must halt back-up power scheme after eu court ruling
london reuters britain must halt a power scheme aimed at avoiding electricity shortages pending a further investigation by european union regulators an eu court ruled on thursday which sent shares in uk energy companies tumbling
the judgement by the eu s general court annuls a decision by the european commission which had said britain s power capacity market was compatible with eu state aid rules
britain began power capacity auctions in offering to pay providers for making supplies available at short notice and so avoid shortages that might occur as coal plants close and low prices dissuade investors from building new power plants
however british energy company tempus energy launched an appeal against the capacity market saying it amounted to subsidies for fossil fuel generators and discriminated against technology designed to cut electricity demand during peak times
in thursday s judgement the general court said the european commission did not carry out enough checks and that payments under the british scheme should be halted until further due diligence could be carried out
the business energy and industrial strategy beis department said the ruling imposes a standstill period which prevents it from holding capacity auctions or making any capacity payments under existing agreements until the scheme can be approved again
shares in british power firms sse drax and centrica which won contracts under the scheme fell between and percent underperforming the wider ftse index which was little changed
greg clark secretary of state for beis said the judgement was a matter of procedure rather than one on the government s policy of capacity markets
the british government is working with its european counterparts to find a swift resolution he said at a government energy briefing in london
national grid said it has been asked to postpone indefinitely upcoming auctions for capacity to be delivered in the winter of and a one for
the government will seek separate approval from the commission to run a replacement auction while the postponed one for four winters ahead could be run in next year s auction round subject to commission approval for the main capacity scheme national grid added
tom glover chief commercial officer at rwe generation said the company was deeply disappointed by the court ruling
there is a material negative impact for rwe and we will be reviewing our obligations under the capacity market he told reporters at a government energy event
analysts at bernstein said the commission s formal investigation will take time and create uncertainty for the uk power market
given that a number of european countries have capacity market schemes that have no participation we fail to see how the uk capacity market can be singled out they said adding that the decision can be appealed by britain
