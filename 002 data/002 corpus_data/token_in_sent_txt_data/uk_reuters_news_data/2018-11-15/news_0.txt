rpt-petrochina's gas marketing consolidation worries independent sellers - sources
repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text by chen aizhu beijing nov reuters petrochina will merge its wholesale natural gas sales unit with retail provider kunlun energy to shore up profits though the move worries independent gas sellers that fear the combination will create a monopoly
petrochina announced the restructuring internally last week to merge petrochina natural gas sales company the country s largest natural gas wholesaler with kunlun energy co ltd said three sources with direct knowledge of the matter
the three sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media
a spokesman with china national petroleum corp parent of petrochina said he could not immediately confirm the restructuring
hong kunlun operates petrochina s liquefied natural gas lng receiving terminals and distributes gas to households and factories
petrochina natural gas sales company markets the company s domestic gas production imports of pipeline gas from turkmenistan and myanmar and lng shipped in from qatar and australia
but the firm which supplies percent of china s gas has suffered losses in its import business as the global prices it pays are often above state regulated domestic prices
in the first nine months of petrochina booked a net loss of nearly billion yuan billion on gas imports compared with net losses of billion yuan during the same period a year earlier
kunlun during the first six months of reported net profit of billion yuan up percent from the same period a year earlier according to its financial report
this shall boost petrochina s lagging gas retail business and cut heavy losses at the wholesale department said one of the three executives
on kunlun released a statement to the hong kong stock exchange discussing natural gas business development strategies that states petrochina s wholesale and retail sales businesses will be operated independently
the statement adds that as of the date of the announcement kunlun has no intention to transfer any petrochina assets in connection with the strategy
kunlun did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the restructuring sent after business hours
still the restructuring worries smaller independent firms such as china resources gas group china gas holdings and enn energy holdings that are fearful the move could squeeze supplies in a fast growing market and create a monopoly wholesaler
it will dramatically alter the market structure as petrochina will no doubt prioritize kunlun as its top customer at the expense of other buyers said another of the executives who is with an independent gas distributor
the move is petrochina s response to a government plan to create a national gas pipeline company by consolidating the country s trunk pipeline assets of which petrochina controls nearly percent
the integration means kunlun will receive support from the supply side and vice versa the sales group will have a deeper penetration into the retail including city gas distribution gas refilling stations said the third source
nearly provincial wholesale operations of the gas sales company will be merged with the similar number of provincial outlets under kunlun the sources said
