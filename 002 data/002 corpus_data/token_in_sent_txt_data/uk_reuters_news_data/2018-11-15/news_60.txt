russia wants to steer clear of any opec-led oil production cut – sources
russia pumped mln bpd in oct a high saudi arabia proposed oct level as reference for combined cut moscow wants to avoid any cuts as its output grows sources by vladimir soldatkin and olesya astakhova moscow nov reuters russia wants to stay out of any cuts being touted by some of its partners in an supply pact two russian sources told reuters
worried by a drop in oil prices due to slowing demand and record supply from saudi arabia russia and the united states the organization of the petroleum exporting countries is talking about a policy just months after increasing production
russian president vladimir putin on thursday avoided giving a direct answer on whether production should be limited but said he had discussed the situation in global oil markets with president donald trump
we need to be very accurate here each word matters putin told reporters in singapore
but the fact that the cooperation with opec is needed is obvious and we will this week trump said he hoped saudi arabia and the rest of opec would not cut production
putin said an oil price of around per barrel suited russia
a steep slide in prices has surprised many oil market participants
brent crude has fallen from a high of a barrel in early october to as of thursday
just weeks ago some trading firms were talking of oil
i think oil production should not be lowered
yes we have done this in the past but this was not the right systematic approach a senior russian government source said
oil production in russia has been on the rise in recent years by around barrels per day each year and it will continue to do so in earlier this week three sources familiar with the issue said opec and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut oil output by million barrels per day bpd although russia may not be on board for such a large reduction
another source familiar with russian thinking said moscow may support smaller cuts most likely by other producers
we think million bpd cuts is more realistic not million bpd
but who is going to do this is another question the source said
putin said last month that russia was able to add another bpd to its production
russia pumped million bpd in october a high
october s level was proposed by saudi energy minister khalid as the reference point for any cut
russia s october level was around bpd more than the million bpd it had initially been bound to produce under the supply pact agreed with opec and other allies
a small reduction from the october level would be a for moscow the second source said
alternatively russia may propose not to increase output further instead of a cut the source said
opec and a group of nations dominated by russia have been cooperating to limit oil supply since the start of
they partially unwound their reduction in june after pressure from trump who wanted lower oil prices
the producers known informally as will convene in the first week of december in vienna to decide further steps
another indication of the likelihood of any russian output cut can be gleaned from the head of energy giant rosneft putin ally igor sechin
he eschewed a direct response on wednesday on whether curbs were needed saying oil prices were adjusting after being hit by initial uncertainty about production in iran which later benefited from export waivers from sanctions
it the oil price is already growing he said as brent rebounded from a steep the previous day
i believe that this uncertainty which affected the oil price was largely due to iran
now everything is being rosneft which accounts for percent of russian oil production plans to raise its liquid hydrocarbon output further next year to million tonnes or million bpd from million bpd in the third quarter
another large russian oil producer gazprom neft is ready to lift output by a further bpd this year and by bpd next year
the head of lukoil vagit alekperov voiced opposition this week to any cut
surging production is a headache for
the country s crude output is expected to average million bpd in passing million bpd sooner than expected on surging shale supply the energy information administration said this month

oil production will soon plateau
it can t grow indefinitely the russian government source said
in the previous round of global production cuts russian oil companies first opposed the move but then relented under orders from putin
the russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a reuters request for a comment
