tankers storing lng in asian waters double as pre-winter demand disappoints
lng tankers floating in asian waters most float off singapore some malaysia s china sea last time tankers used for storage was in by jessica jaganathan singapore nov reuters tankers storing liquefied natural gas lng in asian waters have more than doubled in number since late october as traders have been caught off guard by temperatures that have capped demand and pulled down prices
spot market demand ahead of winter has been slowed by the forecasts for warmer temperatures this year in north asia with onshore storage tanks filling up
people were expecting china to buy as much as last year in the spot market but the weather so far has been quite mild and i don t think they were anticipating that a lng trader said
lng prices last year climbed steadily from to january as china s gasification push for winter heating sparked higher imports
but this year buyers from the world s top natural gas importer via pipeline and tanker have been spreading out their purchases more
now about to lng tankers holding at least million cubic metres of lng worth more than million at spot market prices are floating in asian waters industry sources said
that s up from a tankers being used for storage in asia three weeks ago

most of the traders storing cargoes in the tankers are seeking better winter pricing holding out against rising charter rates to achieve an acceptable profit on the molecules shipbroking firm braemar said in a weekly lng report last week
this is creating pain for those producers who are still forced to lift cargoes from terminals which are approaching tank refinitiv eikon data shows at least eight tankers storing lng in singapore waters while two were in malaysian waters
more than five vessels that had been storing lng are now on the move or have discharged the cargoes the data shows
storing lng on tankers out at sea unlike crude oil is generally seen as a risky bet given the high costs of storage and the fact that cargoes degrade over time by evaporating
as with other commodities the play is typically triggered by a market structure known as contango in which prices for immediate delivery are cheaper than later months
the contango which was at about per million british thermal units mmbtu last month has since narrowed to about cents or less traders said
the last time lng was put into floating storage on a large scale was in though the number of tankers was lower the singapore lng trader said
not all the cargoes are stranded without buyers
some of the companies likely secured the tankers during the summer when shipping rates were far lower and stored them in anticipation of a in prices traders said
