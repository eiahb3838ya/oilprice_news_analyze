german regional govt expects to appeal essen, gelsenkirchen driving bans
berlin nov reuters the environment minister of the german state of north nrw said she expected the regional government to appeal a court ruling that nrw must ban older diesel vehicles from parts of the nation s industrial heartland
the ban affects gelsenkirchen and essen including part of the motorway in the ruhr region one of germany s most densely populated areas
nrw environment minister ursula said the regional government would carefully examine the rulings and then decide whether to appeal them
where there is a threat of driving bans in certain zones especially if a city and a motorway in the middle of a conurbation like the ruhr area are affected it is already foreseeable that the regional government will file an appeal she added
