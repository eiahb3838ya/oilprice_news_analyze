update 2-china-designed uk nuclear reactor plan clears second assessment stage
partnership hopes to use the design for uk plant assessment process expected to take around four years adds comment from edf energy by susanna twidale london nov reuters the first atomic reactor for use in britain moved a step closer to fruition on thursday as the uk nuclear regulator said it had completed the second stage of its assessment of the technology
general nuclear services an industrial partnership between china general nuclear power corp cgn and french utility edf hopes to use the design at a nuclear plant planned to be built at bradwell in essex eastern england
cgn intends to make a number of investments in britain s nuclear power sector most notably the new hinkley point c project in southwest england
britain s office for nuclear regulation onr said the chinese reactor had completed stage two of its generic design assessment gda the formal process for approving a new reactor
the assessment process is expected to take around four years in total and was started around two years ago
the project will now move to stage three of the process
the regulators have not identified at this stage of the gda process any fundamental safety security or environmental issues that would prevent the issue of a design acceptance confirmation the onr said in a statement
edf energy said the approval is a key step for a new nuclear power station at bradwell which will use a british version of the reactor following full approval
however the project is still in an early stage which will involve years of investigative work and public consultations before detailed proposals are produced to allow a planning application to be made the company added
britain needs to fill an electricity supply gap in the next decade
many of its ageing nuclear plants are due to close by and the government plans to shut its coal plants by to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions
large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices
last week japan s toshiba corp said it would scrap a proposed nuclear plant project at moorside in northwest england after failing to find an investment partner
