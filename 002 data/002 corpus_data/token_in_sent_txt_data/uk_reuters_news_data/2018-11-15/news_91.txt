update 1-singapore airlines finds premium economy a tougher sell on new non-stop u.s. flights
singapore reuters singapore airlines ltd is facing no problem selling tickets on its flights to the united states but is having to price premium economy seats very attractively a senior executive said on wednesday
the carrier last month resumed after five years the world s longest commercial flight an almost journey from singapore to new york
the airline ordered seven new airbus se fitted with just business class and premium economy seats for those flights and for services to los angeles and san francisco
these flights have no economy class seats
it represents a major expansion in the market for singapore airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for services due to their popularity with business travelers
singapore airlines executive vice president commercial mak swee wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up
for premium economy however he said some markets were not entirely familiar with the product which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class
i think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product initially with very attractive pricing but eventually i think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight he said at an analyst and media briefing
his comments came after singapore airlines reported on tuesday an percent plunge in net profit hurt by higher fuel prices lower airfares and losses at its virgin australia holdings ltd
yields a proxy for ticket prices fell percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier failing to help offset the impact of a percent rise in fuel prices
singapore airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as s return from singapore to new york for weekday travel over part of the peak christmas travel period according to its website
that is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like hong kong s cathay pacific airways ltd and emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time according to a reuters search on expedia
when it previously flew to new york and los angeles on jets that used more fuel it had initially offered both executive economy and business class but later switched to all business class
those flights were abandoned in when high fuel prices made them uneconomic
a singapore airlines spokesman said on thursday that the airline constantly reviewed its cabin configurations
however at this point we are confident we have the right balance with business class and premium economy class seating on our and there are no plans to change it he said
