update 1-tesla slashes prices on home solar systems to spur sales
reuters tesla inc has cut prices on its residential solar systems by as much as percent in a bid to lift lagging sales after the company streamlined its sales and marketing organization a company official told reuters on thursday
effective on thursday price quotes for potential solar customers will be between and lower representing savings of about to percent according to sanjay shah the company s senior vice president of energy operations
tesla said the to in savings was an average and that the actual amount could be lower or higher depending on the size of the rooftop system and where a home is located
since tesla s acquisition two years ago of solarcity which at the time was the largest residential solar company the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth
last year tesla stopped selling solar and earlier this year it ended a deal to sell solar at home depot inc stores a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half of tesla s solar sales but added up to to the cost of a residential system
that has come alongside a big drop in installations
tesla deployed just megawatts of solar in the third quarter down from solarcity s more than mw a quarter in early
shah said that with lower prices customers will seek out tesla at its stores and online
every customer wants a greater value in terms of price he said
when you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the he said the price cuts should make tesla highly competitive and added that the company ultimately wants to be the solar provider in the united states
solar energy systems from large installers on average are about percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies according to a report by the national renewable energy laboratory a government research lab
shah said tesla s premium solar products are more efficient than most other panels and should not be compared with standard systems on price
the price cuts are made possible in part by the savings tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations
by selling directly through its website and roughly retail stores tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half shah said
shah joined the company six months ago from inc and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient reducing sales and marketing costs and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed he said
tesla shares closed percent higher at on the nasdaq on thursday
