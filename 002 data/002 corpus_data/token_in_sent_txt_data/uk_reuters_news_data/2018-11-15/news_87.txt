angola battles to revive oil exploration as output declines
oil production to fall to mln bpd by without new projects angola plans to tender oil blocks in total to drill first exploration well in four years by stephen eisenhammer luanda nov reuters on saturday nearly two decades after securing the initial rights total s ceo patrick pouyanné was in luanda to snip the ribbon on a billion oil project
it s not clear when he or his peers will be cracking open the bubbly in angola again
without another like total s kaombo on the horizon and fields getting old africa s crude producer is facing a steep decline unless it can revive exploration in what was once one of the world s most exciting offshore prospects
sonangol the state oil company is negotiating contracts for new blocks with oil majors and angola plans to hold an auction next year the first tender for exploration rights since
it s a race against time for a country where oil accounts for percent of exports and around percent of government revenues
luck will also play a part as it always does in exploration where finding oil can never be guaranteed
but without new projects output could fall to million barrels per day by according to the oil ministry
that is down from million today and nearly half of what angola was producing a decade ago
the country risks having its opec quota cut and is struggling to ensure the feed for its billion liquid natural gas plant
president joão lourenço won an august election promising an economic miracle in angola which despite its oil wealth struggles to provide basic services to a mostly impoverished population that is growing at percent a year
but falling oil production means a third consecutive contraction is expected in even while annual inflation runs at percent
to turn things around angola has asked international oil companies to the table offering better fiscal terms and more collaboration
with the time from exploration to first oil on new areas anything from five to years angola is also offering tax breaks to encourage companies to link existing marginal discoveries to operating production platforms
there are signs the measures are working though some oil experts wonder at what cost for the southwest african country
the level of exploration activity in angola is beginning to change sonangol s chairman carlos saturnino said at saturday s inauguration
he expects between five and new concessions to be signed next year
exxon he said has shown interest in some blocks in southern angola s unexplored namib basin while advanced discussions are being held with bp equinor and eni for the rights to the offshore blocks and
bp and eni declined to comment
equinor and exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment
total which operates percent of angola s production plans to drill its first exploration well in four years
beneath metres of water on block it will be one of the world s deepest
we hope it will be a for the in angola said andré goffart senior for development
we are seeing a new wave of exploration in these signs of fresh exploration come after a period of due to a lack of drilling success a slump in oil prices and a deteriorating relationship between sonangol and the oil majors
angola s offshore reserves are expensive to explore and develop making it a hard sell for shareholders when oil is at
the number of rigs operating off angola s shores dropped from in early to just two in according to oil services company baker hughes
the steep drop in prices from came just as companies were smarting from the failure to discover oil reservoirs beneath a layer of salt on the african side of the atlantic
the search for the angolan resulted in some of the most expensive dry wells ever drilled and sapped exploration appetite
critics say the situation was exacerbated by isabel dos santos the former president s daughter and previous chair of sonangol under whose leadership new projects ground to a halt
dos santos denies allegations of mismanagement saying she helped turn around an almost bankrupt company
there are few places in the world right now where the oil majors are in as good a negotiating position as here said one international oil executive in luanda on condition of anonymity
some local experts fear the deals angola is striking are too beneficial for the companies although details remain private
if angola gives away too much it could create problems further down the line said josé oliveira an oil specialist at the catholic university in luanda
but the country has little choice given its imminent production decline and a lack of money or expertise to lead the drilling campaigns itself
asked if he will be back in the next few years to launch another giant project like kaombo total s pouyanné shrugs
we ll see what we find he said
