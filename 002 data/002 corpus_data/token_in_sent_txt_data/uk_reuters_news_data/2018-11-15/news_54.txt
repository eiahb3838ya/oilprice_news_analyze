rpt-graphic-oversupply fears cloud outlook for u.s. crude in 2019
repeating without changes for wider distribution by devika krishna kumar and jessica new york nov reuters the oil market is scrambling to adjust to a deep selloff over the last several weeks with forward prices signaling a supply glut which could upend plans for producers and traders through
crude futures plunged percent on tuesday to settle at their lowest level this year down from a high only a month ago
tuesday marked a straight session of declines which is the longest losing streak on record shaking a market that was bracing for supply shortfalls just a month ago
we were definitely in the bullish narrative for the past three months and now we re seeing that narrative shift said michael cohen head of energy markets research at barclays
if the narrative gets unwound or undermined so too does the positioning by the in the biggest sign of the shift an increasing number of futures contracts are trading at a premium to current prices
that is a signal that the market expects supply to outpace demand next year and into
that trend could inhibit producers from drilling and deal a blow to shale companies which have raked in profits as production surged to a weekly record of million barrels per day bpd in early november
already the organization of the petroleum exporting countries is considering a production cut to boost prices
adding to concerns the international energy agency said on wednesday that supply will outpace demand in
i think there s a genuine shift one trader at a top commodities merchant said
everyone is talking about global oil builds in many traders saw oil on the horizon just a month ago but oil is now closer to a barrel
production is expected to surpass the million bpd milestone by according to energy information administration forecasts
as prices fall and market structure weakens shale producers may pare their drilling plans for said dukes research director for lower upstream at wood mackenzie
i think instead of a big into next year we get flatter activity than what we might have seen otherwise he said
still any changes would take time to alter the trajectory of production especially as the largest oil companies including exxon mobil corp and chevron corp are increasing activity in shale plays
the weakening in contracts pushes the market s structure or curve more firmly into contango where forward prices are higher than spot prices
contango is a symptom of an oversupplied oil market or rising levels of inventories
it makes it more profitable for crude traders to store large volumes of oil for later rather than sell for immediate use
the spread between crude futures expiring in december and december a popular trade in oil markets flipped from a premium to a discount of about cents on tuesday
it is the first time the spread traded in negative territory since october
crude for delivery in december plunged to trade as much as a barrel below futures for delivery in june last week the widest spread on record
the december contract dropped to trade as much as per barrel below the december contract last week the widest since early
a change in the market structure has ramifications for investors as well
when contracts trade below the spot price funds and other investors benefit from what is known as positive roll in that situation funds holding a contract shift into the next month s contract before it expires profiting from buying the cheaper futures
but with those contracts now more expensive rolling the long positions forward is less lucrative and is one reason why traders have pulled back on bullish bets
