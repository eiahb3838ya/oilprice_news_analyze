upset by trump's iran waivers, saudis push for deep oil output cut
abu dhabi reuters when president donald trump asked saudi arabia this summer to raise oil production to compensate for lower crude exports from iran riyadh swiftly told washington it would do so
but saudi arabia did not receive advance warning when trump made a by offering generous waivers that are keeping more iranian crude in the market instead of driving exports from riyadh s down to zero opec and industry sources by the move that has raised worries about over supply saudi arabia is now considering cutting output with opec and its allies by about million barrels per day bpd or percent of global supply sources told reuters this week
the saudis are very angry at trump
they don t trust him any more and feel very strongly about a cut
they had no about the waivers said one senior source briefed on saudi energy policies
washington has said the waivers are a temporary concession to allies that imported iranian crude and might have struggled to find other supplies quickly when sanctions were imposed on
secretary of state mike pompeo said on that cutting iranian exports to zero immediately would have shocked the market
i don t want to lift oil prices he said
a source with knowledge of the matter said the saudis were going to be angry either way with the waivers or even after the a state department official said we don t discuss diplomatic the shift toward offering waivers adds to tension between the united states and saudi arabia as washington pushes for riyadh to shed full light on the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in turkey
the saudis feel they were completely snookered by trump
they did everything to raise supplies assuming washington would push for very harsh iranian sanctions
and they didn t get any heads up from the that iran will get softer sanctions said a second source briefed on saudi oil thinking
saudi energy ministry did not respond to a reuters request for comment
since the summer riyadh has led the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and other producers to hike supplies by over million bpd to keep a lid on prices as sanctions were imposed
brent oil had surged above a barrel in october on tight supply worries but prices have since slid to on concerns about oversupply
trump had wanted lower oil prices before the midterm elections earlier this month
washington gave waivers in november to eight buyers to purchase iranian oil for days
this was more waivers than were initially expected
saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman a key trump administration ally wants prices at or more for his economic reforms sources familiar with saudi thinking say
the waivers were totally unexpected especially after calls to raise output
a few people are upset said a senior gulf oil source familiar with the discussions among opec and its allies on output policy
while the united states set a time limit for the waivers it did not tell the eight recipients how much oil they could buy and has not eased payment restrictions complicating purchases
iran s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about million bpd in november from a peak of million bpd earlier this year
although output is expected to recover from december thanks to waivers it is still not clear by how much
riyadh s concern is to avoid the kind of oversupply in the market that led to a price collapse in to below
but the lack of clarity about the level of iran s supplies makes it tough for saudi arabia to work out appropriate production levels especially after russia raised output steeply in recent months and has said it wanted to produce more in
saudi arabia would need to convince russia to join in any move for new supply cuts
first the saudis let oil prices rise to per barrel and then flooded the market
can they now cut back enough going into a seasonally weak time of the year
without russia it won t be credible said gary ross ceo of black gold investors
saudi arabia must also contend with rising production that has hit record levels above million bpd and is set to climb further next year
exports could surge from the second part of when new pipeline infrastructure opens
rapidan energy group said it saw a supply glut now lasting much more than just a few months in
now that the market has correctly priced iran sanctions and much bigger inventory builds next year we wish to emphasize that opec plus officials face more than a supply tsunami in rapidan said
