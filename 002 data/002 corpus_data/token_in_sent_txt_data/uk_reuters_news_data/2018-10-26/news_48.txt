french regulator expects retail electricity sector to consolidate
paris oct reuters the head of french energy market regulator cre said on friday there were too many players in the retail electricity sector and it was likely to consolidate as competition intensifies
there were around commercial retail electricity suppliers including former monopoly edf as of the end of june according to cre s quarterly report published in september
carenco said in an interview with le monde newspaper the number of suppliers was still increasing
this is one of my concerns he said
we must better control the arrival of new suppliers in the market
there are now too many actors and consolidation will necessarily take the french retail electricity market has seen the arrival of energy giant total which launched its own offering a year ago then acquired direct energie for billion in april
consumer goods retailers leclerc and casino have also launch offerings selling electricity to french households
other players include energy group engie italy s eni sweden s vattenfall and spain s iberdrola
edf still dominates the market with a share of around percent of the residential electricity market
however the utility is loosing around customers every month to other suppliers according to cre
carenco said new entrants could find it difficult to unseat edf given percent of final electricity bills are made up of fixed costs including transport and taxes
he said some suppliers offering a discount of up to percent to edf s fixed regulated tariff could be selling at a loss and it would be hard for them to be profitable
