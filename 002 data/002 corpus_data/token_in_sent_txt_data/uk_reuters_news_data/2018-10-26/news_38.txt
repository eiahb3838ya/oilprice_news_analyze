update 3-u.n. shipping agency pushes ahead with tougher marine fuel rules
london reuters the united nations shipping agency pushed back this week on any phased entry for tougher marine fuel rules and further tightened regulations that will come into force in
the international maritime organization will prohibit ships from using fuels with sulfur content above percent from compared with percent today unless they are equipped with scrubbers to clean up sulfur emissions
ships found in breach of the new rules will face fines or the risk of impoundment by imo member states
the shipping and industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were set in
oil companies expect a jump in demand for cleaner distillates mainly diesel at the expense of fuel oil that would become largely redundant
last week washington said it backed a of the rules to protect consumers from any price spikes in heating and trucking fuels although it did not seek a delay
some shipping associations together with the bahamas liberia panama and the marshall islands had proposed an phase which gained support from washington leading to widespread market speculation in recent days about a possible review of the regulatory time frame
a discussion of their proposal in london this week at the imo s marine environment protection committee mepc failed to advance after the chair of the session said it was too vague
the paper s backers were told they could submit more concrete proposals at the next mepc in may especially focused on data collection and fuel oil quality
that time frame would however leave little time realistically before the regulations kick in for any potential review
the imo has reiterated that there will be no delay in implementing the rules
a coast guard official said on thursday that washington sought a pragmatic approach and would seek to develop proposals with countries for the may meeting
some analysts including rapidan energy group have suggested that major stakeholders including flag carriers were working to push back the global sulfur ban
they also suggested that president donald trump s administration was likely to oppose the start date as it would cause a significant diesel distillate and heating oil price spike in the winter of a presidential election year
many saw mepc as the last chance to delay or soften implementation and the fact that both proposals were rejected strongly suggests that imo will enter the market as expected on consultancy jbc energy said in a note on friday
the imo on friday adopted a ban on ships carrying marine fuel unless they have special equipment on board further tightening regulations
this latest amendment which comes into force on march makes it illegal for ships to carry fuel for combustion purposes for propulsion or operation on board without scrubbers which was not codified in the main regulation
the amendment does not change in any way the entry into force date of the percent limit from
it is intended as an additional measure to support consistent implementation and compliance and provide a means for effective enforcement by states particularly port state control the imo said on friday
roger strevens chair of the trident alliance a coalition of shipping companies that has pushed for enforcement of the sulfur rules said friday s adoption was an unmistakable signal of the imo s commitment to full and effective implementation
the focus now shifts to preparation both on the part of the industry and of the enforcement authorities strevens said
