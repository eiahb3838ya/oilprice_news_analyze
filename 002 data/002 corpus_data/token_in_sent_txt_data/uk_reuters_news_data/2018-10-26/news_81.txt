rpt-column-maritime rule change stirs fears of diesel shortage: kemp
repeats with no changes

chartbook by john kemp london oct reuters the international maritime organization imo has so far resisted pressure to soften or postpone the implementation of new regulations requiring ships to use bunker fuels with a lower sulphur content from the start of
that has prompted warnings from some analysts that the regulations will squeeze the availability of diesel and jet kerosene required by trucks trains aircraft farmers and industry resulting in big price increases
the regulations and any associated rise in fuel prices will occur in the run up to the next presidential election so there is considerable political sensitivity around the timing and cost of the changes
but most imo members are confident there will be enough fuel available to meet the needs of both the shipping industry and other users of middle distillates without an unacceptable spike in prices
from ships will be required to use fuel oil containing no more than percent sulphur down from a maximum of percent at present and an actual average of around percent
ships operating in emission control areas in the baltic sea north sea most of the coast of canada and the united states and parts of the caribbean are already subject to a lower limit of percent which will not change
reduced sulphur limits for the rest of the world were originally approved by imo members in and the deadline was reconfirmed following a fuel availability assessment in
a detailed study of the fuel market commissioned by the imo before it confirmed the deadline examined multiple scenarios for marine fuel consumption and production at the end of the decade
the study concluded that in all scenarios the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels to meet demand for these products while also meeting demand for fuels
capacity increases in crude distillation as well as hydrocracking and hydroprocessing would be enough to meet increased demand for distillates and fuel oil assessment of fuel oil availability ce delft
others in the industry have been less sanguine about the availability of sufficient fuel for both marine and inland users and warned about price increases
earlier this year the international energy agency assessed the new regulations would divert around barrels per day of low sulphur distillate from other uses to the shipping industry
the agency warned diesel prices might have to rise by as much as percent to achieve the necessary consumption reduction in other sectors oil analysis and forecasts to iea march
this week the agency presented a less worrying scenario to the imo suggesting diesel availability may be less stretched owing to slower global growth and a shift away from diesel in key economies
diesel demand is slowing in europe and may be hitting a plateau in china while slower trade growth will also ease some pressure on diesel markets an analysis of the imo sulphur limit iea oct

and some major shipping flag states including the united states worried about the impact on fuel costs have been lobbying for an phase that would inform the implementation of the sulphur cap
seeks late change to rules financial times
the global shipping industry accounted for percent of heavy fuel oil and percent of gasoil used worldwide in
under imo rules ship owners have two routes to comply with the reduced sulphur caps switch consumption to fuels containing less sulphur or install exhaust gas cleaning systems commonly known as scrubbers
installing scrubbers involves a large upfront cost of several million dollars per ship but will allow them to continue burning cheaper fuel oil capital investment to lower operating costs
switching consumption to fuels avoids upfront costs but locks owners into buying more expensive fuels lowering capital investment but raising operating costs
the imo s consultants forecast that around ships would be fitted with scrubbers by the start of january
they predicted most ship owners would leave installations until to delay capital costs as late as possible and avoid incurring costs until they could take advantage of discounted fuel oil
these forecasts appear reasonably accurate
by around ships will be fitted with scrubbers on the most recent estimate by norwegian consulting firm dnv gl
a total of vessels have already been fitted with scrubbers according to a report issued by the firm on
some scrubbers were installed or confirmed this year nearly double the reported in it said
the number is forecast to soar to in and remain at similar rates into
vessels that do not install scrubbers will be required to buy fuel certified as containing less than percent sulphur from and will likely be banned from carrying any fuel over this limit after march
one option will be to buy heavy fuel oil with reduced sulphur content
another will be to switch to marine gasoil
a third will be to switch to a blended fuel designed to bring average sulphur levels under the cap
all these options are likely to add to the fuel bills for ship owners which they will seek to pass on to charterers and freight companies
but the main concern focuses on how many ship owners will switch to using marine gasoil which is essentially the same product as road diesel distillate fuel oil and jet fuel
switching will put ship owners in direct competition with motorists haulage firms railroads farmers airlines and the heating oil industry for the same molecules pushing up prices for all of them
because so much distillate is used in industry and freight transportation distillate consumption is heavily geared towards the economic cycle
distillate markets have been relatively tight in and were expected to tighten further in assuming the economic expansion continues
as the iea notes however there has recently been some shift away from diesel among european motorists following the emissions cheating scandal and consumption growth may also be moderating in china
more importantly the global economic and trade cycle shows increasing signs of maturity and may move into a more moderate phase over the next months
refiners have also undertaken extensive expansions and upgrades to reduce their production of residuals and increase output of fuel oil and gasoil
having made expensive investments many refiners and bunkering firms have urged the imo to press ahead with the introduction of the new sulphur cap
there are still concerns about the potential impact on gasoil availability and prices in
in gasoil prices moved briefly to a premium of almost per barrel over brent in part because of concerns about availability
so far gasoil cracks for fuel delivered in january the first month after the sulphur cap is introduced have risen from a recent low of per barrel to almost
the discount for fuel oil delivered in january has widened from in august to around
the big margin between gasoil and fuel prices is necessary to ensure at least some vessel owners switch to scrubbers
the risk of future price spikes can not be ruled out
but so far the price mechanism appears to be working as intended
