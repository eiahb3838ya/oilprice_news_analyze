climate inaction violates our rights, say activists in germany case
berlin reuters environmental activists greenpeace have teamed up with three families to sue the german government with the aim of forcing it to meet climate protection goals earlier than it had planned magazine der spiegel reported on friday
the case brought by greenpeace on behalf of the three german families alleges that chancellor angela merkel s government by failing to tackle climate change with sufficient urgency was infringing their right to life and health
the filing mirrors a recent case in the netherlands where an appeals court handed down a binding ruling ordering the hague to cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned
the dutch government said it would abide by the ruling
in berlin committed to cutting emissions of greenhouses gases by percent from their levels by the end of this decade but the latest government program says the goal will be met only to the extent possible with a percent cut thought an achievable goal
the government has simply abandoned their goal said roda verheyen the group s advocate
the three plaintiffs all families of organic farmers say their farms and livelihoods are endangered by climate change with pest attacks harvest failures and in their livestock costing them and their children money
according to their claim this further infringes their freedom to exercise a profession as well as their property rights
we can no longer accept the inaction of the government greenpeace s climate expert anike peters told the magazine
especially when it would be possible to achieve the climate protection reporting by thomas escritt editing by hugh lawson
