reuters energy firms added oil rigs for a third week in a row for the first time since june keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years as declining productivity in some shale fields force companies to drill more to keep output growing
drillers added two oil rigs in the week to bringing the total count to the highest level since march general electric co s baker hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on friday
for the month the rig count rose in october the biggest monthly increase since drillers added rigs in may
that was also the first time the count increased for four months in a row since july but the increases from july through to september where marginal as new drilling largely stalled due to pipeline constraints in the permian basin
more than half the total oil rigs are in the permian basin in west texas and eastern new mexico the country s biggest shale oil formation
active units there decreased by one this week to
last week the permian count rose to its highest since january
the rig count an early indicator of future output is higher than a year ago when rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in than

data from the government shows output from new wells in the permian has mostly declined over the past couple of years
new oil well production per rig in the permian reached a high of barrels per day bpd in august
since then that new well output was expected to decline to just bpd in november according to the energy information administration s eia productivity report last week
that means energy firms must drill more wells just to get the same amount of oil out of the ground
even though the number of wells drilled last month in the permian rose to its highest since december completions are not keeping up causing the number of wells drilled but uncompleted ducs in the basin to rise to a record high

analysts at simmons co energy specialists at investment bank piper jaffray this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from in to in in and in
since oil and gas rigs are already in service drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit simmons forecast for
the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the united states has averaged
