update 1-eu seeks to soothe u.s. by clearing soybeans for biofuel
york reuters the european commission said on tuesday it had concluded that soybeans can be used in biofuels in the european union part of the bloc s push to improve strained trade relations with the united states
however industry sources said it was unlikely to lead to a flood of additional soybean imports into europe
president donald trump agreed in july not to impose tariffs on eu car imports while the two sides explored ways to boost trade including a possible deal to remove tariffs on industrial goods and to boost eu imports of soybeans and liquefied natural gas
the commission said in a statement the recognition of soybeans for use in biofuels was valid until july but could extend beyond that date as long as they met sustainability criteria set in new eu rules in the period
today s decision is new proof that the european union is delivering on our commitments a commission spokesman said
currently the united states exports soybeans to the eu for animal feed but the soybean oil byproduct has to be shipped back because europe does not allow it to be used for fuel
the new rule would change that
so on its face it does nothing to increase soybean exports in the eu a lobbyist for the biodiesel industry said
it just helps european farmers capture the full value and saves farmers shipping one congressional staffer described the move as more the removal of a trade barrier
eu biofuel producers used an estimated tonnes of soybean oil for biofuel production in against some million tonnes of rapeseed oil the main feedstock according to claus keller of german commodity analysts fo licht
i think the eu move will be positive for soybean sales prospects to the eu but it will not open a floodgate he said adding that sales would be influenced by trade talks and on the future for argentine biodiesel which faces duties in the united states and could face measures in europe
the commission which negotiates trade deals for the eu has said the july agreement led to a percent rise in soybean imports in the second half of
the united states is europe s main supplier with a percent share of eu soybean imports
the increase has been driven by a slide in the soybean price which slid after china imposed higher tariffs on beans in its trade row with washington rather than because of any concerted action by the eu analysts said
the eu imports about million tonnes of soybeans per year as feed for animals
