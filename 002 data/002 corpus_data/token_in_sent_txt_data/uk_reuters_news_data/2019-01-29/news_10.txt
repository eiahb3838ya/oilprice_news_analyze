graphic-sanctions on venezuela's oil firm sends u.s. refiners scrambling
reuters venezuela s revenues from oil sales to the united states have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on venezuelan oil firm has sent buyers scrambling for replacements
the united states on monday imposed sanctions on petróleos de venezuela known as pdvsa to cripple the opec member s oil shipments which account for nearly all of venezuela s exports in response to the reelection of socialist president nicolas maduro a vote widely viewed as fraudulent
washington has recognised opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s head of state
refineries that depend on venezuela s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact sending prices to the strongest in about five years traders said
other potential alternatives from canada mexico or elsewhere in latin america are hard to secure amid slowing production limited spare capacity and transportation bottlenecks traders said
broader oil futures prices found some support on news of sanctions but the market reaction was largely muted as a lack of investment mismanagement and fleeing workers have already driven the s oil production to the lowest in almost seven decades
pdvsa is seeking to sidestep trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers including refiners to renegotiate contracts four sources involved in the talks said
the united states is venezuela s biggest oil customer importing on average about barrels per day bpd of crude in according to refinitiv eikon data
the region with the biggest shortfall of venezuelan crudes either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the said michael tran commodity strategist at rbc capital markets in a note

the trump administration sanctions allow companies to buy venezuelan oil but the proceeds of such sales will be put in a blocked because of this pdvsa is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the united states its top client
overnight maduro said cargoes loaded for the united states that had not already been paid for could not depart
there s going to be appetite around the world to take venezuelan oil zachary rogers an oil markets analyst at consultancy wood mackenzie said
venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to russia china and india to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market traders and analysts said
its output has been cut in half since to near lows to less than million bpd according to figures from opec secondary sources due to a major cash crunch
as a result the share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to russia and china made largely through repayment structures
venezuela can prioritise exports to asia but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet rbc capital s tran said adding that while they remain the second largest market for venezuelan crudes the chinese have also tapered its buying from caracas over the past two years

shipments to the united states account for about percent of the cash venezuela gets for crude shipments according to a barclays research note published earlier this month
citgo petroleum the refining arm of pdvsa and the biggest importer of venezuelan crude did not reply to a request for comment
the other primary importers valero energy corp and chevron corp said they will comply with laws
though the united states is the top oil producer with output of nearly million bpd complex gulf coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other products and can not simply substitute it with light crude
the easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades
prices of heavier grades like mars sour an offshore medium crude and west texas sour crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply
on tuesday mars crude traded at about a barrel premium to the crude futures benchmark up from a a barrel premium on monday and remained near a high traders said while west texas sour was near the strongest level in a year
it s nuts
everything with sulphur in it is getting bid said one crude trader said referring to crude s sulphur content that is known in the market as sour some traders said much of the impact had already been priced in
i actually think it may end up being bearish medium to longer term
if guaido takes power and foreign investment flows into venezuela then their production has a lot of room to go back up over time a trader at a merchant said
currently alternatives to venezuela s heavy sour crudes are becoming increasingly scarce in the americas due to challenges facing heavy crude producers canada and mexico
canada produces more than million bpd much of it heavy crude that could replace venezuelan grades but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports
until the ongoing canadian pipeline issues are addressed crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from mexico or iraq said tran
however mexico s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its fields have aged and new ones to replace them have not been developed
the trump administration is considering tapping the country s emergency reserve of crude as it imposed sanctions on pdvsa but no decision has been made a government source said
the reserve currently holds million barrels of crude about million of which is classified as sour oil
