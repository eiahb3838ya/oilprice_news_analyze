malaysia's mahathir seeks china's understanding on scrapped $20-bln rail deal
kuala lumpur reuters prime minister mahathir mohamad on tuesday asked for china s understanding over malaysia s plan to cancel a rail project that spearheads china s infrastructure push in the southeast asian nation saying kuala lumpur could not afford it
since winning power last may mahathir has repeatedly vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls unfair chinese projects authorised by predecessor najib razak whose long rule ended in electoral defeat amid a massive financial scandal
the cabinet has decided to cancel the contract with china communications construction co ltd cccc for the east coast rail link project economic affairs minister mohamed azmin ali said last week
we seek understanding from the parties concerned mahathir told reporters on tuesday adding that malaysia was burdened with heavy debt and could not afford the project one of the biggest signed in china s signature belt and road initiative
it is not because we want to frustrate or throw out the contract it is because we are really tight in terms of the contract may cost the country more than billion ringgit billion pounds in total mahathir said adding that malaysia would still have to pay a cancellation fee
the huge compensation is not as huge as the amount of debt we will carry for the next the government was still determining how much to pay cccc as cancellation fee azmin said last week
government officials have previously said the project cost had been inflated
in beijing this week chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said he was unaware of the project cancellation
on tuesday mahathir said an official statement is to be issued in the next few days with the finance ministry to provide a detailed explanation soon
in august mahathir had said the project would be cancelled for now but the government later said it was in talks with cccc on the future of the rail line
mahathir has blamed najib s administration for taking total government debt and liabilities to more than trillion ringgit including that of state fund which is being investigated for corruption in at least six countries
