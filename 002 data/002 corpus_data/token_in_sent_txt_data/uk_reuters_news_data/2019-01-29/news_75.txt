u.s. sanctions threaten venezuela's economy as maduro eyes next move
caracas jan reuters venezuelans braced for the deepening of a brutal economic crisis on tuesday after the united states imposed sanctions sharply curbing the country s vital oil exports while the socialist government responded by refusing to load crude cargoes without payment
the trump administration hopes the sanctions which bar oil company petroleos de venezuela from collecting proceeds from crude sales to refineries pressure president nicolas maduro to step down and allow opposition leader and president juan guaido to call elections
in a defiant national broadcast on monday night maduro said he would take legal action to challenge the sanctions and defend citgo petroleum corp pdvsa s refining subsidiary which he accused the united states of trying to steal
he also pledged to retaliate but did not announce any specific measures
we will provide the reciprocal and convincing response needed to defend venezuela s interests in due time maduro said
pdvsa responded to the sanctions by ordering customers with tankers waiting to load crude destined for the united states to prepay according to three sources with knowledge of the decision
such prepayment could be in violation of the sanctions setting the stage for a standoff at the ports
the loss of revenue from the united states the no
buyer of venezuelan crude was sure to further hamper the government s ability to import basic goods like food and medicine exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has prompted more than million people to flee the country in recent years
if you do not find a place for that crude quickly the room for maneuver will shrink and imports will be affected said asdrubal oliveros director of consultancy ecoanalitica
guaido who argues that maduro usurped the presidency on taking office for a second term on following a may election considered fraudulent by the opposition has said he is prepared to receive million in humanitarian aid pledged by the united states
he also moved to set up new boards of directors for citgo and pdvsa which could allow his parallel government to collect money held in escrow accounts in the united states
but to truly control state functions he would need the support of the military
it has so far stood by maduro who has kept officers support in part by granting them control of key state institutions like pdvsa although the company s output has collapsed in just over a year of military rule
the sanctions threatened to hasten pdvsa s unraveling
there is total shock
this company is already too a manager said on monday on condition of anonymity
