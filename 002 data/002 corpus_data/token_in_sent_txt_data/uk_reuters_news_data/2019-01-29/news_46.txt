update 2-welding problems may further delay edf's flamanville reactor - asn
paris reuters french utility edf s nuclear reactor under construction in flamanville northern france could suffer further delays if certain weldings need to be redone the country s nuclear regulator asn said on tuesday
at asn s annual nuclear safety review its chief regulator said there were questions about the quality of eight weldings on pipes between the flamanville reactor and the turbine building and that there was a problem with one of the weldings
if the asn were to rule that those weldings need to be redone it is possible that edf s calendar may not be respected bernard doroszczuk who took up his post two months ago told reporters
edf said last week it would make further tests next month on faulty weldings at flamanville but added it still targeted loading nuclear fuel at the plant in the fourth quarter of
edf first reported problems with flamanville weldings in february when it said that more than half of the weldings on the reactor s secondary circuit were not in line with standards aimed at making them
in april edf said additional controls on weldings had shown that some were not in line with asn requirements
at the end of july it said the welding problems had forced it to delay of the reactor to the second quarter of with first fuel loading set for the end of
it then said weldings would have to be redone while for another it was confident that it could convince the asn they were fit for service
doroszczuk a welding engineer by training a happy coincidence he said raised doubts about that on tuesday
the flaws in the weldings are a serious issue he said
he said there were questions about the quality of eight weldings which are in places hard to access
he added that edf s strategy was not to repair these eight weldings but to prove to the regulator with technical calculations that the weldings are safe
we are awaiting these calculations and will rule on the weldings early may
we may ask edf to redo them he said
doroszczuk said the overall safety of edf s reactors was satisfactory but urged the industry to maintain appropriate safety margins and not cut corners for financial reasons
he said the nuclear industry needed to improve its skills base to prevent technical problems
