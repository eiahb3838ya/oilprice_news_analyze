exclusive-venezuela proposes new oil contract terms to sidestep u.s. sanctions
adds context on pdvsa s deals by marianna parraga jan reuters venezuela s oil company pdvsa is seeking to sidestep trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers including refiners to renegotiate contracts four sources involved in the talks said
the government issued an executive order on monday freezing pdvsa assets and requiring firms to pay for pdvsa oil using accounts controlled by the country s congress head and president juan guaido
the sanctions were aimed at pressuring socialist president nicolas maduro into stepping down
pdvsa began calling customers ahead of the sanctions urging them to swap foreign fuel and other products for its venezuelan crude cargoes the sources said
it is also considering asking trading houses to act as intermediaries for a portion of its oil sales to indirectly supply customers in the united states and elsewhere
we are trying to redo the contracts
it is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called but we are studying alternatives said a pdvsa source familiar with the efforts
it was unclear on tuesday whether the approach of using intermediaries or swaps would avoid violating sanctions the sources said
oil accounts for more than percent of venezuela s export revenue
falling output corruption and mismanagement have battered the nation s economy leading to hyperinflation and malnutrition that have prompted some million people to leave the country
the south american country exports million barrels per day bpd of crude including bpd to the united states and imports over bpd of refined products according to refinitiv eikon data
washington said on monday proceeds from pdvsa s sales to companies in the united states will be frozen until a new government can take control of the accounts
the sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with pdvsa that began in recent years with customers including pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum india s reliance and russia s rosneft
oil firms that had sent tankers to venezuela to lift crude bound for the united states were ordered by pdvsa on monday to pay for cargoes before departure sources told reuters
but such prepayment could violate the sanctions setting the stage for a standoff at venezuelan ports
regular buyers of venezuelan crude especially in the united states have started hunting for alternative supplies of heavy oil a difficult task as other latin american exporters from mexico to colombia do not have surplus capacity
pdvsa did not immediately reply to a request for comment
several refiners including chevron corp phillips and valero energy said they were studying the sanctions and would comply with laws
valero the buyer of venezuelan crude after citgo said it will its crude supply
washington s fast action on venezuela and efforts by maduro s government to defend its grip on pdvsa have sent shockwaves around the world triggering higher global oil prices and angry responses from china and russia
swaps and trades have become routine due to pdvsa s pacts and sanctions first imposed in according to internal pdvsa documents and trading sources
the company s barrels typically go through several hands before reaching a refinery
its fuel imports mostly come from swaps according to pdvsa s internal documents and refinitiv eikon data
pdvsa approached an indian refiner seeking to modify terms of its contracts including adding partial payment in the form of refined products through swaps a source from the refining company said
with other customers payments in medicines or food for settling outstanding balances also are on the table one of the pdvsa sources said
india s reliance and nayara energy partially owned by rosneft did not respond to emails requesting comment
swaps are one response to sanctions but dealing with traders for triangulating venezuelan oil sales could be pdvsa s last resort as intermediaries make a profit from buying cheap barrels storing them and then offering them to refiners
traders buy our oil at obscene prices the pdvsa source said
