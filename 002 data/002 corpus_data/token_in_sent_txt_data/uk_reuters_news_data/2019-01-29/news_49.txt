french fuel price revolt boosted ethanol use - industry officials
paris jan reuters public anger in france over increasing fuel prices which gave rise to the yellow vest movement has further boosted demand for ethanol fuel from motorists seeking cheaper deals industry representatives said on tuesday
ethanol which is blended with gasoline as part of renewable energy policy targets had already benefited from a favourable environment in france in the past two years
a decline in diesel demand and the licensing of kits to allow cars to run on fuel have contributed to an increase in its use
ethanol in france is made using sugar beet or cereal
fuel containing up to percent ethanol known as reinforced its position last year as the gasoline type in france claiming an average percent market share compared with about percent in ethanol producer group snpaa said
the mix containing up to percent ethanol saw consumption jump by percent although it remained a small part of the gasoline market with a share of about percent
ethanol fuel has also benefited from french tax breaks that increase with higher blending levels making and cheaper than other blends even when factoring in ethanol s lower fuel efficiency compared with traditional petrol
selling at about half the price of the blend has attracted growing attention as rising fuel costs coincided with the spread of kits snpaa said
demand picked up from october when people heard about the authorisation for kits snpaa sylvain demoures told a news conference
with the increase in fuel prices last summer more people became interested and the trend was reinforced by the current yellow vest debate demoures added
higher fuel costs brought yellow vest protesters who wear the fluorescent jackets french motorists are required to carry in their cars onto the streets in november before their movement then developed into a broader revolt against president emmanuel macron
buying and installing a kit typically costs around euros with payback in two years for an average french driver or in a year or less for heavy road users kit suppliers said at the conference
sales at kit supplier biomotors climbed to more than units in january compared with about per month on average last year its managing director alexis landrieu said
several french regions have offered aid to motorists to acquire kits amid criticism that a government subsidy to trade in older cars for new models was inadequate for households
