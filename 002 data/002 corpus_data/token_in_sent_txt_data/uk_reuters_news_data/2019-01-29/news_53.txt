update 2-libya's el sharara oilfield won't reopen until occupiers leave - noc
london reuters libya s biggest oilfield el sharara will remain shut until an armed group occupying the site leaves the head of national oil corp noc said on tuesday more than a month after the field closed because of a protest
the armed group attempting to hold noc and libya s economic recovery to ransom must leave the field before noc will consider restarting production noc chairman mustafa sanalla told a chatham house conference in london
the field was producing as much as barrels per day bpd ahead of its closure but it has lost bpd of capacity since last month due to security breaches sanalla told reporters on the sidelines of the event
the oilfield has been under force majeure since december
before the nation plunged into conflict in the site had the capacity to produce bpd
opec member libya is now producing just below million bpd sanalla said below average production in of million bpd
noc operates sharara in partnership with repsol total omv and equinor
libya s oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began with rival power centres in the west and east
protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure
general khalifa haftar s libyan national army lna which is based in the east launched a campaign this month in southwest libya that it says aimed to combat militant groups and secure oil facilities in the area including el sharara
noc is based in the capital tripoli in the country s west home to the internationally recognised government
referring to the lna initiative sanalla said the effort to restart the field has been complicated further by the launch of an international mission which has expanded into an attempt to seize control of territory including potentially national oil infrastructure
it is my concern that a sequence of events has been set in motion with unknowable consequences for libya and noc he said
he said the preferred solution for securing the field involved deploying a petroleum facilities guards pfg force managed by noc adding that noc would adopt this option with some reluctance
different factions of the pfg have previously been responsible for shutdowns at oil facilities
he said noc had suggested that as an immediate measure a mixed force might provide a solution within a negotiated security framework led by the government of national accord in tripoli and with the support of the united nations
