update 1-u.s. weighs oil release as it tightens vice on venezuela -source
adds oil market comment from energy department washington jan reuters the trump administration is considering tapping the emergency reserve of crude as it imposes new sanctions on venezuela s oil business but no decision has been made a government source said on tuesday
the administration on monday imposed sweeping sanctions on venezuela s oil company pdvsa aimed at pressuring socialist president nicholas maduro to step down
the strategic petroleum reserve a series of underground caverns on the coasts of louisiana and texas currently holds million barrels of crude about million of which is classified as sour oil the rest being sweet
sour has more sulfur in it and requires more processing
a release is likely not imminent but the reserve s role is often a consideration when the administration looks at the global oil market balance as it holds more oil than required under international agreements said the government source who spoke on condition of anonymity
under law the department of energy can do a test sale of up to million barrels or larger releases to loan oil to refiners while the president can order drawdowns to counter severe supply interruptions
but the reserve mostly lacks the kind of heavy oil supplied by opec member venezuela and used by pdvsa s refining arm citgo valero energy corp and chevron
in coming months the energy department could announce a sale of oil from the reserve mandated by laws signed by former president barack obama to fund the federal government and a medical program
last year the department held two such sales releasing about million barrels
an energy analyst discounted the effectiveness of using the reserve as a way to protect against any price spikes
i m not sure a mandated sale or even a new auction really helps the refiners affected an auction would just price up the oil said joe mcmonigle senior energy policy analyst at hedgeye in washington
energy secretary rick perry said in late september ahead of congressional elections and the reimposition of sanctions on iran that the administration was not considering a release from the reserve and that a release would have a fairly minor and dan brouillette the energy department s deputy secretary said on twitter his agency was confident energy markets will remain supplied despite reduced imports of venezuelan oil
over the next few years global oil supply is expected to exceed demand production is forecasted to increase an high of barrels per day he said
analyst kevin book of clearview energy partners said if the sanctions forced refiners to look for other sources they could likely get some of the oil from canada
a spokesman for the national security council said the administration would not comment on deliberations about venezuela
the department of energy did not comment
