n.korea's push to use more coal clouds environmental future
seoul reuters north korean leader kim jong un sees coal as a key way to boost the economy but burning more coal may worsen pollution in a country already choking on some of the world s most toxic air
with the country staggering under the weight of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme and human rights violations defectors and analysts say pyongyang has increased the domestic use of coal which is blocked for export
seven coal power plants and one plant produce nearly percent of north korea s electricity with the rest coming from hydro power according to south korean government data
for households coal is also a key fuel source for cooking and heating
but an increased reliance which kim announced in his new year address may have deadly implications
per capita north korea s air pollution mortality rate was the world s highest at deaths per population as of a report from the world health organization who showed
that was times higher than the rate in south korea and higher than those of china and india where smog often envelops major cities
north korea has acknowledged the correlation between coal and polluted air but said it has had limited access to cleaner options
a combination of limited capital investment in infrastructure limited access to efficient and low emission technologies and reliance on energy produced from coal in low efficiency thermal power plants has impacted air quality in urban and industrial areas north korea s report on environment and climate change outlook submitted to united nations environment programme unep said
according to the report coal is the main fuel used by homes in north korean cities
in rural areas wood is the main source while coal comes in second
many rural north koreans say they re aware of the pollution but have more pressing problems
from the moment we woke up we had to think about how much rice was left in our jar and how much firewood we had said ji a north korean defector who lived in a coal mine town in north hamgyong province before fleeing to the south in
we don t die right away from eating dust but we do if we don t eat food said ji now an official at nauh a human rights activist group who regularly talks to sources inside the north
analysts say north korea has typically reserved its coal for export
using it domestically instead would have at least a small impact on minimising additional pollution experts say
using good quality of coal would reduce emissions said kim professor of chemical engineering material science at ewha womans university in seoul
but north korean facilities lack sufficient filtering so using more coal of any kind would likely lead to more carbon dioxide sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions he said
reuters journalists in pyongyang late last year observed thick smoke pouring from the stacks of several facilities often covering parts of the capital in smog
to raise public awareness about air pollution in north korea s state television aired a special warning about it and provided tips such as wearing masks
in north korea set goals to address air pollution and is working to upgrade older thermal power plants according to reports the country submitted to unep and the united nations framework convention on climate change
but limited technical and financial resources prevented detailed monitoring of air quality the report said and it is not clear whether the north korean government followed through on its recommendations
experts say a lack of reliable data make it difficult to gauge exactly how much damage kim jong un s coal plan might do to the environment and air quality
but they agree it will have an impact outside his country s borders especially in south korea kim said
air pollution harms and kills millions of people every year especially in asia according to the who
in south korea up to percent of air pollutants are estimated to originate in the north experts say
in a survey by the korea institute for health and social affairs south korean respondents said air pollution was their biggest concern eclipsing even north korea s nuclear threats
kim and south korean president moon promised last year to restore the north s damaged forests in an effort to fight air pollution
some air pollutants travel over to the south from the north
if forests are built well those could be reduced south korea s forest service minister kim who visited pyongyang last year to discuss the matter told reporters in january
kim a professor of environment and safety engineering at ajou university who has studied the impact of north korean pollutants said better data from the north is essential to devising air pollution policies in the south
north korea s air quality is our homework to do and we have to think about north korean people s health as well kim said
