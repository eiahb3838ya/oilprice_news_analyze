energy-short pakistan moves to power up solar manufacturing
islamabad jan thomson reuters foundation pakistan s government has proposed to eliminate taxes associated with manufacturing of solar and wind energy equipment in the country in an effort to boost the production and use of renewable power and overcome power shortages
a new government budget bill expected to be approved in parliament within a month would give renewable energy manufacturers and assemblers in the country a exemption from the taxes
pakistan is paying the heavy cost of an ongoing energy crisis prevailing for the last many years finance minister asad umar said last week in a budget speech
in this difficult time the promotion of renewable energy resources like wind and solar has become only about to percent of the power to pakistan s national electrical grid currently comes from renewable energy according to the country s alternate energy development board aedb
the proposed tax reduction should boost that by encouraging greater local manufacturing of equipment needed for renewable power expansion said asad mahmood a renewable energy expert with the national energy efficiency and conservation authority which sits within the ministry of energy
but manufacturers said the tax breaks likely would not be sufficient to spur expansion of local renewable energy industries
naeem siddiqui the chairman of ebox systems which assembles solar panels in islamabad said the new tax breaks were good news but pakistani manufacturers would still struggle compete with imports of solar panels and other renewable energy equipment
the government has already waived off taxes and duties on the import of renewable energy products and local manufacturers can not compete with the imported items he said
pakistan today imports more than percent of the solar panels and other renewable energy systems it uses largely from china said aamir hussain chief executive officer of tesla pv one of the largest manufacturers of solar energy products in pakistan
as long as the government will not impose duties on the import of finished products the local market can not grow he said
pakistani manufacturers also might need government help in pushing sales of new pakistani clean energy products abroad in order to build bigger markets and lower manufacturing costs siddiqui said
mahmood of the energy ministry said he believed the government would also move to cut existing duties on the import of components used in manufacturing finished renewable energy products in order to help pakistani manufacturers
taxes on those components have pushed up prices of renewable energy systems making them harder to sell and leading several companies to the brink of failure he said
local manufacturers should work with the government to determine which components should be manufactured locally and which imported to ensure costs of locally made wind and solar systems are competitive he said
muhammad abdur rahman managing director of innosol a company that imports and installs renewable energy systems said that cheap imports of renewable energy systems from china remain the main barrier to building more such systems in pakistan
the local industry is facing pricing issues because of solar energy appliances being imported in the country that are very cheap as compared to the local market he said
that might be resolved in part by the government starting a certification system for renewable energy products to grade them according to quality he said
amjad ali awan chief executive officer of the alternate energy development board said the aim of the new policies was for renewable energy to supply to percent of the country s national electrical grid by
