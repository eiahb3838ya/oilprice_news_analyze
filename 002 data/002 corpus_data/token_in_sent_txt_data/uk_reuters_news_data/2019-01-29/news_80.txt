exclusive-venezuela's pdvsa orders prepayment for u.s.-bound oil cargoes -sources
reuters venezuela s company oil company pdvsa hit by sanctions on monday ordered customers with tankers waiting to load venezuelan crude bound for the united states to pay for the cargoes before they depart three sources with knowledge of the decision told reuters
president donald trump s administration in a move aimed at limiting embattled president nicolas maduro s access to oil revenues stopped pdvsa from collecting the proceeds of oil exported to customers while freezing assets of pdvsa s units including refining arm citgo petroleum maduro whose authority is being challenged by the president and head of the congress juan guaido said earlier his government would start legal action to protect citgo
he did not mention if pdvsa planned changes to its exports
they are not allowing tankers bound for valero citgo and chevron to leave venezuelan ports if not prepaid a pdvsa source said referring to a decision by the company s trade and supply division
venezuela exports about barrels per day bpd of crude to the united states
citgo valero energy corp and chevron corp are the three largest buyers of venezuelan crude in the united states
valero said it planned to comply with the sanctions and diversify oil purchases to reduce the impact on its business
valero will continue to support the administration and will provide officials with relevant information that will help the refining system to function efficiently it said in a statement
refining firm phillips another buyer of venezuelan oil until last year said it expected to be able to obtain alternative crude grades and mitigate any disruption in crude supply for our traders and shippers with tankers anchored around venezuelan ports said they saw no clear way for customers to pay for venezuelan crude after sanctions even if payments are intended to be made before loading
according to the new sanctions any proceeds from venezuelan crude exported to companies will stay in special bank accounts in the united states
the trading sources said they feared the european union may follow with similar measures freezing pdvsa s accounts in europe
several years ago pdvsa moved its bank accounts that receive money from oil exports mainly to china
it also has accounts in europe
but firms willing to transfer money to those foreign accounts still need to find correspondent banks in the united states willing to authorize the transactions which is difficult because of sanctions
