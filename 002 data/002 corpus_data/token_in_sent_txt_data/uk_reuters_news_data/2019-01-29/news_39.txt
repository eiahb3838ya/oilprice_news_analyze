saudi arabia suspends 126 local government employees on corruption charges
riyadh reuters saudi arabia said on tuesday it had suspended local government employees at municipalities across the kingdom on corruption charges
they are charged with involvement in a number of cases including financial and managerial corruption abuse of power as well as other legal and criminal violations the ministry of municipal and rural affairs said on twitter
saudi authorities rounded up dozens of people in november on crown prince mohammed bin salman s orders amid a crackdown on corruption with many confined and interrogated at riyadh s opulent hotel
most of them including global investor prince alwaleed bin talal were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government
last year king salman ordered the establishment of specialised departments in the public prosecutor s office in order to accelerate the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases
the public prosecutor said then that the campaign would work its way through offences
