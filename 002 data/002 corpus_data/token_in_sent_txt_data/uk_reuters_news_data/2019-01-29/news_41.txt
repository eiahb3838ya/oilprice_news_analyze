graphic-sanctions on venezuela's oil sends u.s. refiners scrambling
jan reuters venezuela s revenues from oil sales to the united states have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on venezuelan oil firm has sent buyers scrambling for replacements
the united states on monday imposed sanctions on petr√≥leos de venezuela known as pdvsa to cripple the opec member s oil shipments which account for nearly all of venezuela s exports in response to the reelection of socialist president nicolas maduro a vote widely viewed as fraudulent
washington has recognized opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s head of state
refineries that depend on venezuela s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact sending prices to the strongest in about five years traders said
the united states is venezuela s biggest oil customer importing on average about barrels per day bpd of crude in according to refinitiv eikon data
the region with the biggest shortfall of venezuelan crudes either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the said michael tran commodity strategist at rbc capital markets in a note

the trump administration sanctions allow companies to buy venezuelan oil but the proceeds of such sales will be put in a blocked because of this pdvsa is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the united states its top client
overnight maduro said cargoes loaded for the united states that had not already been paid for could not depart
there s going to be appetite around the world to take venezuelan oil zachary rogers an oil markets analyst at consultancy wood mackenzie said
venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to russia china and india to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market traders and analysts said
venezuela s output has been cut in half since to near lows to less than million bpd according to figures from opec secondary sources due to major cash crunch that has stymied investments a brain drain that is depriving it of engineers and a new military management that has clashed with workers
as a result the share of its exports has declined in recent years with more shipments going to russia and china made largely through repayment structures
it can prioritize exports to asia but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet rbc capital s tran said adding that while they remain the second largest market for venezuelan crudes the chinese have also tapered its buying from caracas over the past two years

shipments to the united states account for about percent of the cash venezuela gets for crude shipments according to a barclays research note published earlier this month
citgo petroleum the refining arm of pdvsa and the biggest importer of venezuelan crude did not reply to a request for comment
the other primary importers valero energy corp and chevron corp said they will comply with laws
though the united states is the top oil producer with output of nearly million bpd complex gulf coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other products and can not simply substitute it with light crude
the easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades
prices of heavier grades like mars sour an offshore medium crude and west texas sour crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply
on tuesday mars crude traded at about a premium to the crude futures benchmark near a high traders said
it s nuts
everything with sulfur in it is getting bid said one crude trader said referring to crude s sulfur content that is known in the market as sour the alternatives to venezuela s heavy sour crudes have become increasingly scarce in the americas due to challenges facing heavy crude producers canada and mexico
canada produces more than million bpd much of it heavy crude that could replace venezuelan grades but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports
until the ongoing canadian pipeline issues are addressed crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from mexico or iraq said tran
however mexico s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its fields have aged and new ones to replace them have not been developed
traders said the united states may need to sell oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to cover supply shortfalls
the trump administration was considering a release from the spr s p global platts reported ahead of sanctions being imposed
the crude quality in the spr differs from venezuelan crude however
