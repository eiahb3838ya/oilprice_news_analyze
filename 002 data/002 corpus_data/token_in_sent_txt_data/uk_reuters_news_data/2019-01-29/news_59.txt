eu calms u.s. trade ties by accepting u.s. soybeans in biofuel
brussels jan reuters the european commission said on tuesday it had concluded that soybeans can be used in biofuels in the european union part of the bloc s push to improve strained trade relations with the united states
president donald trump agreed in july not to impose tariffs on eu car imports while the two sides explored ways to boost trade including a possible deal to remove tariffs on industrial goods and to boost eu imports of soybeans and liquefied natural gas
the commission said in a statement the recognition of soybeans for use in biofuels was valid until july but could extend beyond that date as long as they met sustainability criteria set in new eu rules in the period
today s decision is new proof that the european union is delivering on our commitments a commission spokesman said
the commission which negotiates trade deals for the eu has said the july agreement led to a percent rise in soybean imports in the second half of
the share of the eu market is now about percent
the increase has been driven by a slide in the soybean price which slid after china imposed higher tariffs on beans in its trade row with washington rather than because of any concerted action by the eu analysts said
the eu imports about million tonnes of soybeans per year as feed for animals
