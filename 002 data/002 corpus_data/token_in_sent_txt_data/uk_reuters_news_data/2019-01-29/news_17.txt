exclusive-venezuela proposes new oil contract terms to sidestep u.s. sanctions
adds details on pdvsa s actions context by marianna parraga jan reuters venezuela s oil company pdvsa is seeking to sidestep trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers including refiners to renegotiate contracts four sources involved in the talks said
the government on monday issued an executive order freezing pdvsa assets and requiring firms to pay for pdvsa oil using accounts controlled by the country s congress head and president juan guaido a move to pressure socialist nicolas maduro into stepping down
pdvsa began calling customers ahead of the sanctions urging them to swap foreign fuel and other products for its venezuelan crude cargoes the sources said
it is also considering asking trading houses to act as intermediaries for a portion of its crude sales to indirectly supply customers in the united states and elsewhere
we are trying to redo the contracts
it is not yet entirely clear how because customers are being individually called but we are studying alternatives said a pdvsa source familiar with the efforts
the proposals were still being offered but it was unclear on tuesday whether the approach of using intermediaries or swaps would avoid violating sanctions the sources said
oil accounts for more than percent of venezuela s export revenue
falling output corruption and mismanagement have battered the nation s economy leading to hyperinflation and malnutrition that have sparked an exodus of million people
the south american country exports million barrels per day bpd of crude including bpd to the united states and imports over bpd of refined products according to refinitiv eikon data
as recently as it exported million bpd of oil and fuel
washington on monday said proceeds from pdvsa s sales to companies in the united states will be frozen until a new government can take control of the accounts
the sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with pdvsa that began in recent years with customers including pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum india s reliance and russia s rosneft
oil firms that had sent tankers to venezuela to lift crude bound for the united states were ordered by pdvsa on monday to pay for cargoes before departure sources told reuters
such prepayment could be in violation of the sanctions setting the stage for a standoff at venezuelan ports
pdvsa did not immediately reply to a request for comment
several refiners including chevron corp phillips and valero energy said they were studying the sanctions and would comply with laws
valero the buyer of venezuelan crude after citgo said it will its crude supply to minimize any impacts
washington s fast action on venezuela and efforts by maduro s government to defend its grip on pdvsa have sent shockwaves around the world triggering higher global oil prices and angry responses from china and russia
