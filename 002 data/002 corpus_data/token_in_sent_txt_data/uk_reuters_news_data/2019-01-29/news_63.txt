update 1-myanmar official suggests downsizing or relocating dam that frayed china ties
naypyitaw reuters a top myanmar investment official on tuesday suggested alternatives such as downsizing or relocating a stalled dam project that has strained ties between the neighbours
myanmar angered china in when its former government suspended the billion billion pounds myitsone dam in the country s north amid environmental concerns
asked about the dam at an investment conference thaung tun chairman of myanmar s investment commission listed several problems from an earthquake fault line running under the project site to a large catchment area affecting residents
catchment area would be twice the size of singapore
this would mean that a lot of villages will have been displaced from their accessible land
that is the issue thaung tun told reporters at the conference in the capital naypyitaw
thaung tun listed several alternatives including scaling back the dam moving it to a different location or offering the operator an alternative project
he did not say if the government had a preferred option
myanmar had to consider its relations with china its largest trade partner and was working hard to find the solution he said
spearheading these efforts is a commission launched by aung san suu kyi s government which came to power in to review the dam
myanmar also began informal talks with beijing and dam operator yunnan international power investment a unit of state power investment china s foreign ministry said in a statement sent to reuters that the dam was a commercial cooperation project already agreed upon by both countries and had been through a complete approval process
relevant bodies and companies in china and myanmar are in communication about this project positively and appropriately handling problems that arise in the project s cooperation process it said
finding a solution is critical for suu kyi who has benefited from beijing s support at the united nations following a army crackdown that drove rohingya muslims out of the former burma
myanmar also needs beijing s help in peace talks with several ethnic armed groups operating along northern and eastern borders with china
thaung tun said original plans for the dam were not thought out and failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment
the dam in the northern state of kachin is very unpopular
suu kyi s ruling national league for democracy nld lost a seat in kachin last year and party officials have voiced concern about their popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the general election
china s yunnan province the planned destination for about percent of the dam s electricity now has a power surplus thaung tun said
there s no need for this dam now he said
on monday nobel laureate suu kyi opened the first investment conference by calling on global investors to put their money in myanmar seeking to offset the negative impact of the rohingya crisis and slow pace of economic reforms
