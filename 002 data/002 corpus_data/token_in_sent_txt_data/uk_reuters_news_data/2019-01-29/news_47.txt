chartbook by john kemp london jan reuters gasoline consumption was flat in the first months of as escalating motor fuel prices offset the impact of a strong economy and big employment gains
gasoline consumption combined with surging shale production and a slowing global economy to push the oil market towards surplus and explains the plunge in prices late last year
gasoline consumption averaged million barrels per day bpd between january and october which was slightly down from million bpd in the same period in
consumption is forecast to have declined by around bpd according to estimates from the energy information administration energy outlook eia december
consumption has shown little or no growth since after four years of variable but strong gains between and petroleum supply monthly energy information administration december
fuel use has flattened off even as the rate of economic growth has accelerated to an annual rate of more than percent and almost million jobs have been created since the end of
but stagnating gasoline consumption has been consistent with a sharp slowdown in the growth of traffic on the nation roads in the last two years
traffic volumes surged between and with travelled often rising at rates of percent or more but slowed sharply in and with gains slowing to percent or less
traffic volume in the three months from september to november was just percent higher than in the same period a year earlier traffic volume trends federal highway administration december
in the last quarter of a century traffic growth has been closely correlated with both the state of the economy and changes in the cost of fuel
while the economy has remained supportive higher oil prices have been strongly negative for gasoline consumption
falling prices between and provided a stimulus to consumption but subsequent rises have caused that effect to unwind
the deceleration in gasoline consumption is one reason climbing oil prices helped push the global oil market towards a surplus in and why prices needed to fall to rebalance production and consumption
the impact of rising prices on motorists also explains why they are so sensitive for politicians and why president donald trump aggressively pressed opec to bring prices down last year
finally stagnating gasoline consumption explains why the oil market has become reliant on emerging markets and freight transport to absorb output growth from shale and other sources
global oil consumption growth and prices have become increasingly sensitive to changes in economic growth outside the united states and the other advanced economies
as signs of a global slowdown in trade became evident in the second and third quarters of it became increasingly clear consumption growth would decelerate and prices would have to decline
once the united states decided to grant generous sanctions waivers to iran s most important customers allowing them to continue buying the country s crude the last remaining support was removed and prices fell
lower prices are a necessary part of the market s rebalancing process and over time should help restore some consumption growth in the united states and more importantly in emerging markets
but with so much consumption growth now geared towards china and other emerging markets the outlook for market balance and prices in will remain dominated by concerns about a possible global slowdown
until the threat of a global slowdown is lifted oil prices will struggle to recover despite the efforts of opec and its allies to reduce production
