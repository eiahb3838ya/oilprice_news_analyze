ifo says euphoria gone but german economy still humming
munich germany reuters german companies are less euphoric about the economy than in the last few months but it is too early to talk about a fundamental shift ifo economist klaus wohlrabe said after a fall in the institute s business confidence index
i would not yet speak of a change in the underlying trend the german economy is still doing very well but some of the steam has been let off he told reuters
he saw a clear decline in demand for industrial goods and said conservative chancellor angela merkel s coalition deal with the social democrats spd was no cause for jubilation as big tax reforms were not on the agenda
companies are barely mentioned in the deal
businesses are rather sober about it said wohlrabe
