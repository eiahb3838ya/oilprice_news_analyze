update 2-france's edf says some weldings at flamanville reactor substandard
edf says safety of reactor not affected weldings designed to be unbreakable are substandard regulator asn studying technical files about the flaws adds nuclear regulator s comments by geert de clercq paris feb reuters french power group edf said some weldings on its new flamanville nuclear reactor did not meet required specifications but this did not affect safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of
france relies on nuclear reactors run by edf for of its electricity
a source familiar with the matter told reuters that edf would discuss the situation with the residents of flamanville northern france on thursday
an edf spokeswoman said of weldings on the flamanville epr reactor s secondary cooling circuit were not in line with standards aimed at making them
but they did meet requirements from french nuclear regulator asn for nuclear equipment under pressure she said
asn chief chevet who has repeatedly said the schedule for the reactor was tight told a parliament committee hearing on nuclear safety and security on thursday that an inspection had revealed that the welding issue was more serious than initially thought
chevet said the issue was still very much open and the agency was far from drawing conclusions because it was still at the start of its analysis of the issue
that given i can not confirm edf s assertion that there would not be an impact on flamanville s schedule chevet said
the of flamanville is subject to my authorisation and the safety calendar will be paramount he added
the epr reactor the type of unit edf is also building at britain s hinkley point is years behind schedule and billions of euros over budget
the flamanville reactor is scheduled to be loaded with fuel by the end of december and will ramp up throughout with a target to be at full power by the fourth quarter of next year
edf said in a statement on the flamanville epr reactor s website that deviations had been detected in the quality of the weldings in pipes transferring steam from the steam generator to the power turbine
edf has started analysis aimed at proving that the mechanical characteristics of the circuit are in line with expectations within deadlines compatible with the project planning it said
the problem was first identified in the workshops of suppliers to framatome formerly called areva in and as well as in weldings on site
those steel pipes have been designed and manufactured to be percent guaranteed against any rupture or leaks under edf high quality standards that go beyond regulatory requirements
edf said those requirements had not been properly communicated to suppliers raising questions about their quality
edf informed asn about the problem in early and sent it technical dossiers to prove the equipment was fit for service and in line with regulations
asn ruled in june that flamanville was fit for service despite weak spots in its steel but ordered edf to replace the reactor cover by at the latest due to carbon concentrations in its cover which make the steel brittle
edf shares were down percent at close
