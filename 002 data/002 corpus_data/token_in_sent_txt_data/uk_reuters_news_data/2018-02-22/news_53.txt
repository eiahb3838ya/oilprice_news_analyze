global markets-fed points upwards for rates, world stocks lurch downward
investors price in more fed tightening after minutes treasury yields ease off highs but world stocks at low wall street set for weaker session updates throughout by sujata rao london feb reuters world stocks tumbled to lows on thursday after the federal reserve confirmed it was on track to raise interest rates several times this year sending bond yields to highs
wall street was set for its third straight session in the red equity futures indicated
while yields retreated from the percent big figure minutes of the fed s meeting at the end of january have at least temporarily taken the edge off investors appetite for equities and other assets perceived as risky such as emerging markets and
the minutes showed fed policymakers agreed at the meeting held after lawmakers had approved some trillion in tax cuts that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate
they also noted upward risks to economic growth and inflation
as a result the odds of faster interest rate hikes have narrowed with a host of fed fund futures hitting contract lows
while three rate rises are almost fully priced in for up from two in december some traders now reckon four moves might be possible this year
some of the impact of the minutes had started to fade however with the dollar now trading off highs against a basket of currencies and treasury yields edging off highs around percent
marie owens thomsen global head of economic research at indosuez wealth management in geneva said markets seemed to have finally accepted a faster rate rise trajectory for
but she saw no reason for an equity market collapse or sharp bond selloff
when i look at the fundamentals i see stable growth in all major economies good earnings from the majority of companies and in a historical context i see low interest rates and low inflation owens thomsen said
she was referring to percent of s p firms which have beaten analysts forecasts with their results while in europe the number stands at more than percent according to thomson reuters data
despite the solid earnings wall street closed sharply lower on wednesday and its losses drove falls of around percent in asia and europe
msci s equity index stayed under pressure losing percent for its third straight day of losses while emerging equities lost percent
new york was set for another weak session with s p futures down around percent
the impact of the fed s minutes was further tempered by the latest minutes from the european central bank which retained its dovish stance and said even changes in communication would be premature
the comments suggest that policymakers will move by increments keeping one eye on markets to avoid having to backtrack
german yields did not react to the ecb minutes though they were well off the percent hit after the fed minutes tempered by data showing german business confidence fell more than expected in february
while europe s biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth in the first quarter of the diverging monetary policy expectations with the united states sent the transatlantic spread between german and borrowing costs to bps the highest in more than a year
the next milestone for markets is new fed chairman jerome powell s first testimony to congress scheduled for wednesday
what he says could determine whether treasury yields can scale the percent psychological hurdle
analysts at mufg securities said if powell signalled the current tightening pace would remain that would support global equity markets
the major risk now lies in the dots increasing from three rate hikes to four they added referring to the projected path for interest rate moves
britain meanwhile confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy with data showing percent growth in the last quarter of
that pushed sterling percent lower against the dollar a low
