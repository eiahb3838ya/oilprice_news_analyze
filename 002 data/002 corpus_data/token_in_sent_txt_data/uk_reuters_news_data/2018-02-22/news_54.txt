seychelles preserves swathes of marine territory in debt-for-nature deal
victoria reuters the island nation of seychelles designated some of its fragile coastal areas for protection from commercial fishing oil exploration and development this week in return for a novel deal relieving it of part of its sovereign debt
the indian ocean island rich in underwater reefs and beaches defaulted on its debt in and clawed its way back to prosperity with assistance from the international monetary fund
since then government officials have been searching for ways to preserve their environment without endangering financial stability
so the finance ministry was intrigued when conservation group the nature conservancy approached it recently with a financial proposal the first in the world aimed at protecting a marine area
the conservation group offered to buy up nearly million of seychelles outstanding million sovereign debt in return for the country designating a third of its marine area as protected
the east african island nation of fewer than people mainly relies on tourism and fishing for revenue but in recent years oil and gas companies have been exploring its turquoise waters home to dugongs turtle and tuna
on wednesday seychelles gave details on the first square kilometre square miles area to be conserved limiting activities like fishing oil exploration and development in the most fragile habitats while allowing them under certain conditions in the rest of the area
the remaining square km area which will have different restrictions will be announced later
the seychelles deal builds on years worth of similar swaps that have preserved vast tracts of tropical forests in latin america and the caribbean
but it s the first time the financing technique has been used to secure a marine environment said rob weary the head of naturevest which funds the group s conservation deals
there s not been one example of a country defaulting on a swap he said
weary said the seychelles deal which will also help fund projects could pave the way for other larger deals where conservationists buy a country s sovereign debt in return for policy changes designed to help the environment
with an annual operating budget of million per year the nature conservancy s funds dwarf many other charities such as oxfam or the world wildlife foundation
never before has there been so much funds available to support economic activities the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity and adaptation to climate change said vice president vincent meriton when announcing the project
reaction to the announcement was generally positive
petroseychelles head patrick joseph told reuters that no explorers had shown an interest in the protected areas but that he was unsure such stringent protection was necessary
fisherman graham green said he hoped it would rejuvenate traditional fishing
long ago you would fish for just a few hours and not far out to sea and get a good catch of fish
but these days what you used to get in just one hour takes you a whole day he said
