update 2-boeing may bid to supply canadian fighter jets despite trade row
ottawa reuters boeing co may take part in a race to supply canada with new fighter jets and stands an equal chance with other bidders even though it is locked in a trade dispute with ottawa a senior canadian official said on thursday
procurement minister carla qualtrough made her comments shortly after the liberal government released a list of five companies that would be allowed to compete
boeing along with rival lockheed martin corp is on the list of approved suppliers
canada is due to release the exact specifications for the jets next year
officials say the deal is worth between c billion billion and c billion
although boeing angered canada last year by launching a trade challenge against planemaker bombardier inc qualtrough said the dispute would not necessarily harm boeing if it chose to enter its super hornet
all the five teams on the supplier list have an equal chance she said in a phone interview when asked about boeing s prospects given the bombardier row
none of the contenders are obliged to take part
boeing spokesman scott day said the aerospace giant would continue to evaluate its participation in the competition
a trade commission last month dismissed boeing s complaint that bombardier was dumping planes on the american market at absurdly low prices
canadian officials have privately made it clear that boeing needs to drop the matter to stand a better chance of winning the fighter jet contract say sources
ottawa has made clear that bids will be evaluated in part by whether firms have caused any past economic damage to canada a clear reference to boeing
but on thursday qualtrough said we haven t decided how far back into the past companies actions will be canada is remaining in the consortium that helped fund development of the which has prompted some defense analysts to suggest the jet has an advantage going into the competition
we re aware of that perception and we are working very hard to make sure that the process is fair and transparent said qualtrough
prime minister justin trudeau initially opposed the on the grounds that it was too costly but ottawa has since softened its line
the government said the other companies eligible to take part are airbus which makes the eurofighter saab ab which makes the gripen and dassault aviation which makes the rafale
