exclusive-india's essar seeks loans from traders as banks fear russian links
london reuters indian refiner essar oil is looking to raise over billion million pounds from trading houses after its new russian owners could not raise loans from major western banks due to sanctions on russia
essar wants to borrow the money for years and repay it with cargoes of refined products as it seeks to cut its reliance on lending from indian banks banking and trading sources familiar with the discussions said
it would be the first large deal by essar which has previously engaged only in deals
russian oil major rosneft fund ucp and swiss commodities trader trafigura bought essar oil s large refinery fuel stations and infrastructure for billion last year
rosneft has been under sanctions since russia s annexation of crimea in
the essar deal was funded mainly by russian state banks including vtb and the new owners attempts to partially borrow from large western banks have so far not progressed
banks are not technically forbidden from lending to essar in which rosneft owns percent
sanctions forbid lending to entities by rosneft but banking sources have said they would still exercise caution
essar and rosneft initially signalled interest in borrowing but have gone silent in the past six months after most banks signalled to them they would not be able to lend said a source with a major western bank which initially received an invitation to express interest
the new shareholders are keen to diversify their financing base away from relying only on indian banks as had been the case under the ruia family who were the former owners one of the banking sources said
a spokesman for essar oil declined to comment
previously essar oil india had credit lines with indian banks which complicated the closing of the deal
using a prepayment was viewed as a easier alternative to widen its cash base
however lending to essar is also complicated by the types of crude it is relying on for its operations with significant volumes coming from iran and venezuela
while the international oil embargo on iran was lifted in early restrictions on dollar use in connection to iran remain
president donald trump has also repeatedly criticised the nuclear pact with tehran and threatened to stop extending sanctions relief
as for venezuela secretary of state rex tillerson said the government has been weighing sanctions on the south american country s oil industry
essar is expected to issue a early in the second quarter of this year outlining the details of the loan a second banking source said
traders who loan funds would be repaid with gasoline and gasoil cargoes
rosneft said last in august last year that essar oil planned to double throughput at the refinery and build a petrochemical plant
