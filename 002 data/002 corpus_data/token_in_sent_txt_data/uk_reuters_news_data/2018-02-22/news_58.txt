graphic top lng exporters importers by clyde russell launceston australia feb reuters if you were looking for signs that the liquefied natural gas lng is starting to spin a little faster the announcement of a planned massive expansion in papua new guinea is ample evidence
global majors exxon mobil and total are considering plans to double lng exports from papua new guinea to about million tonnes per annum their partner oil search said on
if approved three new trains would be added to the existing png lng facility with natural gas from total s fields supplying two of the units and the third using existing fields and a new exxon development
while a final investment decision on the billion expansion is still more than a year away it s a clear sign that lng producers believe the market is headed for a deficit and that projects are once again viable
the lng industry s recent development has been characterised by periods of massive investment and capacity expansions followed by lulls amid fears of low prices caused by oversupply
the past decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of lng capacity with eight projects being built in australia and six in the united states as well as some others such as the yamal venture in russia
most of these developments have started or are due to start within a fairly narrow time frame between and a bunching together of new capacity that led to widespread market concern of oversupply and weak prices
while it s still likely that there may be some oversupply this year and perhaps until the early the market reality is that new lng buyers in asia and a surge in chinese demand has eaten away most of the expected surplus
china imported million tonnes of lng in up percent from the prior year according to customs data
a few years ago there were forecasts that china would import as much as million tonnes of lng a year by the middle of the next decade predictions that started to look wildly optimistic as lng imports struggled to gain traction in the period
however a concerted effort by the authorities in beijing to switch from coal to natural gas has seen a surge in lng imports one that is likely to continue as cleaning up air pollution remains a priority making million tonnes per annum a realistic target
the attractiveness of lng relative to coal has also been boosted by a declining spot price for lng in asia which at the current per million british thermal units mmbtu is less than half the peak of reached in february
it s not just china turning to lng with other asian countries including india pakistan vietnam the philippines sri lanka and others all planning to increase their capacity to the fuel
this new dynamic hasn t gone unnoticed by lng companies which are starting to ramp up talk and action about new projects after a quiet few years spent trying to complete existing developments while navigating lower prices and buyer demands for more flexible contracts
australia s woodside petroleum operator of the existing million tonne per annum northwest shelf project recently launched an almost billion capital raising in order to buy control of an offshore field from partner exxon and use the natural gas for an expansion of its pluto lng plant
mozambique s vast resources are also getting closer to coming to market with anadarko petroleum announcing a sales agreement on bringing it closer to a final investment decision
however all these potential projects are facing quite a different market to the last round of that are now coming on stream
buyers especially the majors in north asia such as japan south korea and china have made it clear they want flexible contracts
this means an end to destination clauses an end or at least substantial changes to the method of pricing lng against crude oil and considerably contracts or even more spot deliveries
this makes it hard to secure the agreements needed to secure funding for dollar projects meaning it s likely that those companies with strong balance sheets that they can leverage off will enjoy greater chances of success in developing a new lng plant
the lng market is also likely to become more volatile and the seasonal swings may become more pronounced especially if china remains the main driver of demand growth
china s lng demand is concentrated over the northern winter when the fuel is used for mainly heating replacing boilers in both industry and residential use
while power demand for does increase during summer china has comparatively little generation meaning demand for coal and other forms of electricity such as hydro and nuclear shoulder the burden
this dynamic is likely to lead to sharper price spikes during winter and declines in summer than has been the case in past years
overall the lng market is shifting from being staid and focused on the long term to one characterised by rising volatility deals and increasing innovation
