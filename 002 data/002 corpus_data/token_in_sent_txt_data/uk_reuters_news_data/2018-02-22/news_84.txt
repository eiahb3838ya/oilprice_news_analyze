refile-update 1-u.s. adds more duties on biodiesel from argentina, indonesia
inserts dropped letter in headline washington feb reuters the commerce department on wednesday piled on more import duties on biodiesel from argentina and indonesia adding duties of percent to percent to already steep duties on the fuels
the final determination is subject to a second ruling by the international trade commission on april on whether biodiesel producers were injured by dumped imports from the two countries
but the independent panel has already found in the subsidy cases that the imports caused such injuries
the latest duties make it virtually certain that biodiesel from argentina and indonesia will not be sold in the market with combined rates of up to percent on the argentine fuel and up to percent on indonesian variety
the commerce department set final dumping duties for argentine biodiesel at percent to percent and for indonesian biodiesel at percent to percent
today s decision allows producers of biodiesel to receive relief from the effects of foreign producers dumping into the domestic market commerce secretary wilbur ross said in a statement
while the united states values its relationship with argentina and indonesia even our closest friends must play by the the latest duties come just two weeks after a budget deal in the congress reinstated a per gallon biodiesel tax credit which is expected to improve profitability for domestic producers
the trade case was filed by the national biodiesel board and member companies that alleged a flood of subsidized imports sold below fair market value was preventing producers from earning an adequate return
today s decision provides room for the domestic biodiesel industry to flourish and produce more volumes of this fuel which provides so many economic and environmental benefits kurt kovarik the trade group s president said in a statement
