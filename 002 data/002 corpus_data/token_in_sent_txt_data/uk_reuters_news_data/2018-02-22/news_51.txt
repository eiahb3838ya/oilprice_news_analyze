ups-workhorse electric van deal shows progress on charging costs
detroit feb reuters a deal thursday between ups and electric van maker workhorse group inc shows how the delivery industry is making progress to resolve a major obstacle to deployment of commercial vehicles charging costs
ups like its rivals in the package delivery business faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to clean up its fleet of vehicles
ups is partnering with workhorse to build an electric delivery van
the first vehicles with a driving range of miles km will be delivered in
that range is enough to allow ups to replace around diesel or gasoline delivery trucks company officials said
until recently however ups would have faced substantial costs for the charging stations and related infrastructure to top up the batteries at the end of the day
with the deployments of vehicles if you can t put them somewhere to take advantage of them then it s irrelevant scott phillippi ups senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations told reuters
we have to have solutions in place to make that solutions for the charging problem are now in sight ups and other industry officials say
ups recently rolled out smart charging software at a central london facility that allowed the company to nearly triple its local electric fleet to delivery vans
the smart charging technology determines when and how fast to charge vehicles
if vehicles are not scheduled for a full route the next day the system can opt not to fully charge them and charge other vehicles more
without the software ups would have had to install enough infrastructure to charge all the vehicles at the same time the equivalent of powering an office building or hospital at a cost of millions of dollars for electric grid hardware
the project at ups s london facility was partly funded by innovate uk the british government innovation agency
if successful ups will use its london experience as a blueprint around the world as it expands its electric delivery vehicle fleet
ups approach could also serve as a model for smaller companies that can not afford major infrastructure investments
if this solution didn t exist it would cost too much money for small companies to upgrade their connection capacity said christos keramisanos a consultant at uk power networks services ukpns in charge of the ups project in london
charging costs are critical as delivery fleet operators calculate the costs of switching to electric vehicles
hermes a european delivery service plans to deploy electric mercedes vans and is working with daimler ag s commercial van unit to design recharging systems that do not require new transformers or large numbers of individual charging stations said benjamin kaehler head of mercedes electric van business
mercedes goal is to structure charging costs so an electric van has the same total cost of ownership as a van over three years kaehler told reuters
cheaper charging is key to that goal
that s the breakthrough he said
truck leasing and rental company ryder system inc which has bought electric vans from chanje a unit of china s fdg electric vehicles ltd is already training its technical and sales staff on smart charging technology
ryder is aware the world is going electric and we are preparing for that future said chris nordh ryder s director of advanced vehicle technology
smart charging is key to creating developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of trillion by manufacturers and governments trillion in battery plants manufacturing and chargers and trillion on distribution and generation capacity said balu balagopal a partner in kearney s energy practice
his estimate is based on an assumption that percent of the global vehicle fleet is electrified by
utility regulations are an obstacle
the united states lacks national standards for recovering the costs of charging infrastructure
for tesla s semi big rig far larger than a delivery van customers such as pepsico inc inbev and ups plan to build their own charging stations
california has moved to allow utilities to recoup investments and is reviewing proposals from utilities to spend more than billion over five years on electrification infrastructure for cars buses and trucks
other states do not allow utilities to spread electric vehicle infrastructure costs across their broad base of ratepayers
the right structures haven t been put in place to allow us to operate and participate in this market said lang reynolds electric transportation manager at duke energy corp of charlotte north carolina which serves several southeastern states
