adds quote details background by ahmed rasheed baghdad feb reuters iraq s crude oil exports from its southern ports on the gulf stand at million barrels per day so far in february two oil industry officials told reuters on thursday
despite repeated bad weather issues this month we expect the monthly average to stay at or slightly below million barrels per day one of the officials said
iraq s total exports should be higher as the northern iraqi kurdistan region also exports about bpd through a pipeline to the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan
iraq is the producer of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec after saudi arabia
the country is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly million bpd under an agreement between opec and other exporters including russia to curtail output in order to support oil prices
iraq plans to export oil to iran from the northern kirkuk oilfield using tanker trucks
iraq and iran agreed in december to swap up to bpd of crude produced from kirkuk for iranian oil to be delivered to southern iraq with the crude trucked to iran s kermanshah
the transportation was to start in late january and oil industry officials declined to give reasons for the delay other than it was technical in nature
later officials said it would start this month but so far it has not
iraqi forces launched a security operation along the planned oil transit route this month to clear the area from militants
kirkuk crude sales have been halted since iraqi forces took back control of the oilfields from the kurds in october
kurdish forces took control of kirkuk in when the iraqi army collapsed in the face of islamic state
the kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region s oilfields
iraq and iran are also planning to build a pipeline to carry oil from kirkuk
the planned pipeline could replace the existing export route from kirkuk via turkey and the mediterranean
