algerian consumers, firms feel pinch of import bans
algiers reuters mansour and nassima used to buy swiss chocolate for their daughter
but in the past few days it has disappeared from the shelves as algeria s government implements a ban on imports of hundreds of products in an effort to cut the trade deficit
the restrictions will encourage domestic production shielding it from foreign competition officials say
but local firms including drinks producers and potters say shortages of raw materials are putting their businesses at risk
algeria s sector remains undeveloped meaning most goods consumed by its people are shipped from abroad
oil and gas account for percent of the state budget
at the start of this year authorities banned the import of products including foodstuffs and some raw materials in a bid to address a gaping trade deficit that widened as energy earnings almosty halved since
several products have disappeared
we re talking about luxury products said mansour as he browsed the ardis mall in the capital algiers with his wife and daughter
most prices have gone up even those of national products due to the lack of competition he said
today i can t see some of the goods i used to buy on the shelves including good quality chocolate for my daughter said nassima
ardis which opened its doors in and is the largest mall in the country attracts flocks of consumers every day because of the wide range of local and imported consumer goods it stocks
that range has now been reduced though walid allouni the mall s store manager played down the change
the import suspension is a problem for us but this measure has affected only about percent of the products we sell here he said
some prices have risen because demand exceeds supply
i think this is a good opportunity to strengthen and encourage domestic in the past two years algeria imposed a licensing system to reduce its imports bill but that measure fell short of expectations
the value of purchases from abroad stood at billion in down just percent from the previous year
china which has boosted its economic presence across north africa is algeria s main supplier followed by france and italy
despite past promises to support economic diversification local firms have struggled hampered by bureaucracy and insufficient foreign investment that deprived them of technology
the restrictions may only add to pressure on some firms with managers voicing concern about a possible collapse of their business because of declining stocks of raw materials
on sunday the association of algerian ceramicists published an open letter to prime minister ahmed ouyahia urging him to ease limits on the import of the two main materials used in the industry
domestic ceramics production falls short of demand with products imported mainly from spain and china filling the gap
the situation it warned could cripple the shortages of raw materials risk spreading to other sectors unless the government finds alternatives to the import suspension businessmen say
some of our companies import percent of their input needs said ali hamani the head of algerian association for drinks producers which includes firms
there are firms that risk trade minister mohamed benmeradi said firms affected by the ban were totally protected state news agency aps said
he did not elaborate
