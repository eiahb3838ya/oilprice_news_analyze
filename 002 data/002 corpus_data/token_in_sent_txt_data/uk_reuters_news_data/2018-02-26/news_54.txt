update 2-new nafta talks aim to clear pathway to toughest issues
mexico city reuters mexico and canada aim to finish reworking less contentious chapters of the nafta trade deal with the united states in new talks that began on sunday hoping to clear the path for a breakthrough on the toughest issues before upcoming elections
in six months negotiators have made progress on the technical details of a revamped north american free trade agreement but made little advance on strong demands for change made by the administration of president donald trump
ranging from calls for major changes to automotive content rules and dispute resolution mechanisms to imposing a clause that could automatically kill nafta after five years the chief stumbling blocks laid by the white house look unlikely to be removed in the latest mexico city round officials said
trump frequently threatens to walk away from nafta unless big changes are made to a pact he blames for manufacturing job losses
i think there s going to be major progress on the technical issues and major obstacles on the critical issues bosco de la vega head of the mexico s national agricultural council farm lobby said of the talks running until march
once agreement is reached on technical chapters such as enterprises barriers to trade and about percent of the modernized accord would eventually be left over for political leaders to work out de la vega estimated
a schedule for the latest round showed that the discussions for the first three days would include rules of origin an issue at the heart of the trump administration s demand to raise the amount of auto content sourced from the nafta region
under nafta at least percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the region to avoid tariffs
trump wants the threshold raised to percent
you can t have a successful negotiation if there s no change to the rules of origin said a mexican official speaking on condition of anonymity adding it won t be percent
we re not sure what the number is going to mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo has said his negotiating team aims to present a proposal on rules of origin although he has not provided details
on sunday evening the mexican official told reuters we don t have a counterproposal any final agreement would need to be reached between trump and leaders in the united states who oversee the nafta region an industry source close to the process said
the north american auto industry has pushed back against trump s demands arguing they would damage competitiveness and regional supply chains
mexico aims to build on the previous round in montreal when canada floated proposals to address demands including one to include costs for engineering research and development and other items in the total value of an auto
the schedule showed that several chapters that negotiators have signaled are close to concluding including telecommunications and energy are up for discussion toward the end of the round
financial services will last for three days
the latest round comes amid between washington and ottawa and growing if cautious optimism in mexico that the trade agreement will remain
talks are running behind schedule and some officials believe the longer they last the less likely it is that trump will dump nafta
negotiators had wanted to wrap up talks by march to avoid them being politicized by mexico s july presidential election
congressional elections in november could also complicate the talks
but officials have raised the possibility that they will run past mexico s vote and some said they could continue at a technical level for several months if necessary
a official said there has never been a hard deadline and belief is growing among mexicans following the process that lobbying efforts by business leaders and politicians to preserve nafta have been gaining traction
the office of minnesota governor mark dayton on friday published a letter sent this month to trade representative robert lighthizer in which he urged him to preserve and expand market access under nafta and build on existing ties
while pledging to stay in the talks canada s chief negotiator steve verheul struck a downbeat tone last week telling a business audience there are large gaps between what we re trying to achieve and what the is trying to additional reporting by dave graham and adriana barrera in mexico city lesley wroughton in washington and david ljunggren in ottawa editing by susan thomas and peter cooney
