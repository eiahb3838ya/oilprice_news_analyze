australia's new century agrees deal to supply zinc concentrate to belgium's nyrstar
melbourne feb reuters australian miner new century resources has agreed to supply zinc concentrate from its project in the country s far north to belgium s nyrstar the two firms said on monday
as part of the deal nyrstar is set to suspend arbitration proceedings that it launched this month related to a historical supply agreement over concentrate from the site the companies said
that step is pending a formal offtake agreement
under the deal new century will supply tonnes of zinc concentrate to nyrstar over years for processing into refined metal the companies said in a joint statement
the firms said the terms of the deal were confidential but that new century remained on track for its first zinc concentrate production in the third quarter of this year
new century is pleased to establish this offtake with nyrstar which is the world s second largest direct end user of zinc concentrate with smelters located around the world new century executive chairman evan cranston said in the statement
the global market for mined zinc is facing a supply deficit due to years of underinvestment during the commodities downturn and after several giant mines dried up heating up demand for zinc mine supply
new century is set to produce zinc concentrate from the tailings of the giant century mine in australia s queensland state which was closed in by previous owners china s mmg
new century earlier awarded mercuria energy trading and transamine trading a tender for about tonnes of zinc concentrate which triggered nyrstar to file a request for arbitration based on its historical supply agreement
nyrstar has traditionally been a significant long term user of century zinc concentrate said nyrstar chief executive officer hilmar rode
we are very pleased to have secured a new supply agreement and are looking forward to continue our long standing successful relationship with the century zinc mine and its new owners new century for the first years the offtake includes a variable tonnage allocation to nyrstar of tonnes of zinc concentrate rising to tonnes for the final two years of the agreement which represents approximately percent and percent respectively of the scheduled production
