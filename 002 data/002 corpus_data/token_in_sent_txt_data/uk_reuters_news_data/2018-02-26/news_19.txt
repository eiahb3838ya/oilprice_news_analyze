energy transfer partners appeals revocation of louisiana pipeline permit
houston feb reuters an energy transfer partners subsidiary on monday appealed a ruling by a federal judge in louisiana that halted construction on a portion of its bayou bridge crude oil pipeline according to court documents
the motion came after district judge shelly dick on friday issued a preliminary injunction revoking a needed permit for the pipeline which is already under construction
environmental groups and local fisherman have opposed the line citing concerns about the environment and local economy
a portion of the pipeline would run through the atchafalaya basin a nearly million acre wetland in southern louisiana that is a critical component of the state s commercial fishing industry and flood protection system
representatives from energy transfer partners did not respond to a request for comment
the project is percent owned by etp with the remainder controlled by refiner phillips
the disputed pipeline is an extension to an existing line which transports crude from nederland texas to lake charles louisiana
the new segment would extend the system to james louisiana and have capacity to transport up to barrels per day of oil
energy transfer partners last year prevailed over a fierce push from environmental and native american groups to halt its controversial dakota access pipeline
although opponents of that line were able to temporarily stop construction it began service in
