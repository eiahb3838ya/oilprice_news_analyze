austria investigates former minister over eurofighter deal
vienna feb reuters vienna prosecutors are broadening their probe into a billion eurofighter jet purchase by austria and are investigating former defence minister norbert darabos for breach of trust a spokeswoman said on monday
the prosecutors launched investigations against airbus and the eurofighter consortium in february after the defence ministry said it believed they had misled austria about the price deliverability and equipment of the deal
their investigations involve individuals including airbus chief executive tom enders
the consortium and enders have denied the accusations
darabos who agreed a settlement with eurofighter in to reduce the order is the first known former cabinet member to formally be targeted by prosecutors
i can confirm that mr norbert darabos is under investigation for alleged breach of trust a spokeswoman for the vienna prosecutors said confirming earlier reports by austrian dailies kurier and kronen zeitung but not elaborating any further
darabos was not immediately available for comment
now member of the burgenland regional government he told austrian daily kurier that he had been questioned by prosecutors several months ago
austria s purchase of eurofighter jets approved by the right coalition government linked to bribery accusations from the outset
a parliamentary inquiry set up under a social government in explicitly sought reasons to cancel the contract
but in defence minister darabos also a social democrat agreed a settlement with the eurofighter consortium to reduce the order to jets from and the volume of side deals to billion euros from billion euros
those offset deals are common in large arms deals and meant to let local businesses benefit
a second parliamentary inquiry examined the settlement last year
while it found no indications of bribery or that airbus and its partners illegally influenced austrian politicians the committee s final report assessed that darabos did not liaise sufficiently with other ministries and agencies while negotiating the settlement and was not transparent enough to allow a court audit of the deal
