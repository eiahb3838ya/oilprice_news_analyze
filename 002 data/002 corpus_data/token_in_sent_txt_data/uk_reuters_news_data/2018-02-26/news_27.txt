toyota pursues petrol but sees electric potential in new technology
tokyo reuters toyota motor corp stuck to its commitment to improving petrol engines on monday with new powertrain units while flagging technologies which could find their way into electric vehicles evs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles fcvs
the japanese automaker plans to keep refining its petrol engines and the hybrid technology it pioneered two decades ago while also developing battery operated cars as tightening global emissions rules drive a race for affordable evs
as high battery prices and range limitations restrain ev hybrids and hybrids would be dominant in coming years mitsumasa yamagata chief engineer at toyota s power train product planning division said
cars using petrol engines in some form would still account for around percent of all vehicles by he added
developing the most powertrains using petrol engines and hybrid systems will be the best way to have an impact on reducing emissions and we remain committed to this he said at a briefing on toyota s new litre petrol engine and hybrid systems which can improve fuel economy by percent and percent respectively over its current systems
at the same time we will be able to use the technology developed for these powertrains in evs and already lagging nissan motor co general motors and bmw in bringing a ev to market toyota has ramped up its ev development in the last year or so pledging to add more than ev models to its product in the early after long touting a strategy focusing mainly on hybrids and fcvs
last week it announced it had developed magnets containing fewer rare earth metals which can be used in evs while it has also partnered up with panasonic corp to develop ev batteries
yamagata said that components for petrol vehicles could also be used in evs including a new launch gear used in toyota s continuously variable transmission unveiled on monday which works with a smaller belt drive to enable smoother more efficient initial acceleration and final deceleration
industry experts anticipate that of evs will pick up faster than toyota expects as decreasing battery costs result in a cost parity between evs and cars around but some say that it could leverage its lead in hybrid technology to help stay competitive during this transition
toyota has been developing its hybrid technology since the and has been improving it all along
this is complex technology which would take a lot of effort for others to develop originally clsa analyst chris richter said
