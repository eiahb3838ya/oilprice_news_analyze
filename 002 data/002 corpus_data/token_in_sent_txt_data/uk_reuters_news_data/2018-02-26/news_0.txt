column-commentary: can lab-grown meat feed - and save - the world?
paul shapiro is the author of clean meat how growing meat without animals will revolutionize dinner and the the opinions expressed here are his own
by paul shapiro feb reuters with six oscar nominations including best picture and actor darkest hour is fascinating audiences with its portrayal of winston churchill facing decisions at a turning point in world war two
in fact churchill had been thinking about the future of humanity in rather radical ways for years already
in churchill published an essay fifty years hence in which he made predictions about what the world might look like by the
among the more stunning that humans would figure out how to permanently divorce meat production from animal husbandry
we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing churchill prophesied by growing these parts separately under a suitable because doing so would free up land that had been used for growing crops to feed farm animals he concluded parks and gardens will cover our pastures and ploughed churchill was a few decades off but we now have the capacity to do exactly as he foresaw to grow real meat outside of animals bodies
in recent years clean meat a term first popularized by the nonprofit good food institute as a nod to both clean energy and to the meat s food safety benefits has moved out of the realm of science fiction and become scientific fact
the first clean burger debuted in thanks in part to research and development funding from google sergey brin
since i ve had the good fortune to eat clean beef duck fish chorizo liver and yogurt all of it grown without animals
perhaps unsurprisingly clean meat tastes like meat since well that s exactly what it is
and i m not the only one interested
these products are starting to get serious attention from traditional meat processors with agribusiness giants tyson and cargill investing in memphis meats a clean meat based in san leandro
it s not a threat to us it s an opportunity sonya mccullum roberts president of growth ventures at cargill recently told fortune magazine
to be clear the clean meat that churchill envisioned and that companies like memphis meats are beginning to produce isn t simply an alternative to meat
it s actual animal muscle tissue produced without the living conscious animal
rather than raising chickens or pigs to slaughter and sell as cuts of meat clean meat producers take microscopic animal cells put them in a cultivator so they behave as they do in the body and feed them so they that grow into muscle tissue just like the meat we eat today
why would we want to do as churchill suggested and start producing real meat without animals
well for starters because raising farm animals takes vast resources
to put the problem in perspective imagine walking through the poultry aisle of your local supermarket
for each whole chicken you see envision more than one thousand jugs of water sitting next to it
then imagine systematically one by one twisting the cap off each jug and pouring them all out
that s about how much water it takes to bring a single chicken from shell to shelf
in other words you can save more water by skipping one family chicken dinner than by skipping six months of showers
growing only the meat we want won t require all the resources needed to produce entire animals
a study by oxford university researcher hanna tuomisto estimated that clean beef production could require percent less land and percent less water while producing percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional beef production
such early studies are admittedly imprecise since the technologies that will make clean meat commercially viable are still under development
but most analysts believe that even production of meat is likely to be far more than traditional livestock production
churchill s vision of synthetic meat isn t yet a reality but it s likely a matter of years now not decades
meanwhile meats are already helping many of us to wean ourselves off the factory farming of animals
those who worry that churchill s vision of meat without animals is unnatural may find it helpful to recall just how unsustainable inhumane and unnatural contemporary meat production has become
clean meat probably won t be competing for market share against meat from animals
rather clean meat enthusiasts seek to displace the farm animals providing the vast majority of the meat we eat today animals that languish in their own feces never set foot outdoors and are forced to consume large quantities of antibiotics and other drugs
if we pause to contemplate this harsh reality the promise of clean meat seems obvious
churchill had a lot on his plate when he became prime minister
yet his predictions about the contents of our plates may have even greater relevance today as we search for ways to reduce the harm we re doing to the only planet we have
clean meat may soon prove to be part of the solution
