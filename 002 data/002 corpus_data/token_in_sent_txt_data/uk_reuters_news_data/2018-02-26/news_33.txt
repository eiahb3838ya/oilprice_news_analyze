eu threatens cambodia with sanctions over election purge
brussels reuters the european union threatened cambodia with economic sanctions on monday after the country s ruling party said it had won every seat in a senate election in which many opposition supporters were stripped of their right to vote
eu foreign ministers said in a statement they were considering specific targeted measures against cambodia which diplomats said was a warning to prime minister hun sen that senior government officials could face sanctions
the bloc said it was also reviewing the preferential trade treatment it gives cambodia because of what rights groups and opposition politicians say is a crackdown by the premier in power for years ahead of a national election in july
the council urges cambodia to restore democracy eu foreign ministers said referring to the name of their formal grouping in brussels
in view of recent developments the council may consider specific targeted measures if the situation does not improve the statement said
it said the eu would step up its monitoring of its everything but arms trade arrangement with cambodia that allows the southeast asian country to export goods including clothing and textiles free of tariffs into the bloc a market of some million people
cambodia s main opposition national rescue party was dissolved by a court last november at the government s request and the cnrp says authorities subsequently stripped of its commune councillors and lawmakers of their voting rights
the dissolution was followed by the arrest of cnrp leader kem sokha for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with help an accusation both the united states and kem sokha have rejected
preliminary results published by the ruling cambodian people s party cpp at the weekend showed it had won seats on the senate leaving the other three political parties with nothing
