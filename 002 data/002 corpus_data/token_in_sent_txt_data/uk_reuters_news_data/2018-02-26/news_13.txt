update 1-mexico's pemex posts nearly $18 bln 4th-qtr loss as output, refining dip
recasts headline lead adds quote and details on output and refining by david alire garcia mexico city feb reuters mexican oil company pemex reported a nearly billion loss on monday after both crude output and processing slid though the company said refining levels should rebound as major maintenance plans are completed
the company posted a billion bln peso loss for the last quarter of blaming a weaker peso exchange rate and higher financing costs for its performance according to a filing with the mexican stock exchange
the loss compares to a profit of some billion mexican pesos in the period
maintenance at pemex s ciudad madero and minatitlan refineries will be completed by the end of march senior executive josefa casas said on a call with analysts
boosting crude processing at both facilities should help reverse a prolonged decline in refining levels
investment resources continue in the maintenance of pemex s six refineries with the intention of not only stabilizing operations but also positively increasing crude processing margins in the production of refined products said casas
pemex lost billion pesos during the fourth quarter due to a weaker peso the company said which depreciated percent against the dollar
while most of pemex s costs are in pesos it sells crude oil and buys imported fuels like gasoline in dollars
financial costs were up percent during the quarter mainly because of larger indebtedness the company said
also weighing on the quarterly result pemex s tax bill more than doubled to reach billion pesos
crude oil production was down about percent during the quarter at million barrels per day bpd
total crude output averaged million bpd down nearly percent compared to production which the company said was due in large part to the natural decline of its fields
meanwhile crude processing at the company s six refineries dipped to just bpd during the quarter despite a processing capacity of about million bpd
pemex s annual crude processing in averaged bpd compared to bpd in
the lower level of refining activity was blamed on the impact of natural disasters including a major earthquake on pemex s salina cruz facility the company s biggest
casas added that pemex continues to look for partners at its salina cruz and salamanca refineries both of which need to be reconfigured to better process heavy crude
