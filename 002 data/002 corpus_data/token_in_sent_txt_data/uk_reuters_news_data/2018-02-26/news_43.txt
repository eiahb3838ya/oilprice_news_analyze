feature-despite state-level bans, plastic bags still suffocate india's cities
srinagar india feb thomson reuters foundation half of india s states and union territories have introduced a blanket ban on plastic bags and yet many shoppers remain wedded to the flimsy carrier bags while plastic waste still litters the streets of the south asian nation
in jammu and kashmir became the latest state to prohibit all polythene bags in accordance with a ruling by its high court
it joins other states and territories governed by new delhi that have imposed a complete ban on the sale and use of plastic bags including madhya pradesh and punjab
five other states goa gujarat kerala odisha and west bengal have partial bans on the use of plastic bags around sites of religious historical or natural importance or during the pilgrimage season according to data provided to the thomson reuters foundation by india s central pollution control board
despite this change is barely visible on the ground
in mountainous jammu and kashmir for example shopkeepers and vegetable sellers still pack goods in plastic carrier bags before handing them over to customers
we have been hearing this for a long time i don t think the ban is going to work said mohammad yasin who sells vegetables in srinagar city s zainakote area
the government of jammu and kashmir had already banned bags made of polythene a common form of plastic with a thickness of less than microns a year ago but to little effect
it is not only up to us the customers share major responsibility
they should carry their own reusable bags
if they do so the ban will work yasin said
more importantly the country needs to stop making polythene he added
several other shopkeepers the thomson reuters foundation spoke to agreed
if the government is serious about stopping the use of polythene it should ban its manufacturing
that will force people to carry their own bags said abdul rashid a shopkeeper in srinagar s commercial hub lal chowk red square
india s plastics industry employs about million people and has more than processing units according to the india brand equity foundation set up by the government to promote made in india products internationally
domestic consumption of plastic is expected to reach million metric tonnes per year by while exports of plastic products were worth billion in
srinagar deputy commissioner syed abid said the jammu and kashmir government was committed to stamping out plastic bags
we have constituted special squads for enforcing the ban and we are also seizing polythene wherever we find it in use he said in an interview
some environmental experts say carrying plastic bags should be punishable by law
as of now only the traders or shopkeepers are penalised which doesn t affect people who compel the shopkeepers to provide them with plastic bags said samiullah bhat assistant professor in the environmental science department at the university of kashmir
riyaz ahmad wani the commissioner of srinagar municipal corporation told the thomson reuters foundation the authority may consider imposing fines on those who carry polythene bags under a new policy for solid waste management now being drafted
in march the karnataka state government issued a circular stipulating that no one should use plastic products including bags banners bunting flags plates cups spoons cling film and table cloths
it also said those items should not be manufactured supplied stored transported sold or distributed
megha shenoy a fellow at the ashoka trust for research in ecology and the environment atree said the ban has had some impact there but enforcement is patchy
civil servants in several departments are tasked with putting it into practice but proof of their work needs to be collected and verified independently said shenoy
without such a system responsibility gets shunted between departments leading to dilution of enforcement she said
moreover several political parties including the ruling party often use banners bunting and other plastic products as bureaucrats struggle to implement the rules she added
as far back as two indian supreme court judges warned the next generation will be threatened with something more serious than the atom bomb in the absence of a total ban on plastic
but progress towards that aspiration is slow
a report by the central pollution control board said indian cities produced more than tonnes of plastic waste every day
of this tonnes were collected and processed while the rest littered the streets and drains or was dumped in landfill
about of the plastic waste was a mix of polythene bags and food packaging mainly from residential areas it said
in indian prime minister narendra modi noted that cows a sacred animal for many indians were dying after consuming plastic and urged those concerned about their welfare to stop it happening
according to a june study published in the journal nature communications rivers mostly in asia carry into the sea about of the plastic in the world s oceans with the river ganges crossing india and bangladesh responsible for the amount among them
swati singh sambyal programme manager for environmental governance at the new centre for science and environment said a ban on plastic bags would only work if their manufacture was stopped and cheaper alternatives made available
a jute bag or a cloth bag is way beyond the reach of a vendor only big malls or shops can use them she said
charging for polythene bags is another way to incentivise shoppers to bring reusable bags while shopkeepers who give out plastic bags should be fined she added
meanwhile she urged cities to start information campaigns
behaviour change through mass awareness is imperative she said adding few efforts of this kind have been made so far
atree s shenoy said citizens could help enforce the ban by using cameras on their smartphones and data collection apps while the authorities should report publicly on progress
the government could also support businesses that offer sustainable alternatives to plastics she added
some companies for example are making bags bin liners and packaging from natural starch vegetable oil derivatives and vegetable waste which they say are biodegradable and to flora and fauna although they are still more expensive than their plastic equivalents
