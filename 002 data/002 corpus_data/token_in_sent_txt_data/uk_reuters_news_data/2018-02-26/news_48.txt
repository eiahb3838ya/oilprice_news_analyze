update 2-japanese firms in consortium to bring lng to australia's east coast
aims to import up to mln tonnes lng a year to australia group may charter lng import vessel for mln a year targeting sales to major industrial gas users aims for investment decision this year in adds marubeni jera comment by sonali paul melbourne feb reuters a consortium including japan s jera and marubeni corp is aiming to ship liquefied natural gas lng to australia s east coast looking to supply industrial gas users and possibly a new power plant the group said on monday
this is the second proposed lng import terminal for australia the world s lng exporter as the country grapples with a supply gap at a time when its gas producers have locked in contracts to sell lng to japan china and south korea
a final investment decision is expected this year on the project to import up to around million tonnes a year of lng starting in james baulderstone who is leading the australian industrial energy group told reuters
this market is in quite desperate need for more gas to come in said baulderstone a former santos ltd executive pointing to soaring energy prices
the lng receiving terminal would be able to meet up to of the gas needs of australia s most populous state new south wales where manufacturers like bluescope steel and orica have major operations
baulderstone said the consortium would probably charter an existing lng import vessel at an estimated cost of around million to million a year rather than building a new floating storage and regasification unit fsru
that is a fraction of the billions of dollars that would be needed to develop a new gas field and pipelines to supply the equivalent volume of gas petajoules a year
the efficiency of capital is extraordinary because you don t have to spend that much capital to effectively charter a boat and connect it to the existing east coast grid he said
the proposed new lng import terminal would be located at either port botany port kembla and newcastle all of which are close to existing gas pipelines helping to keep down costs
australian industrial energy s investors as first reported by the australian financial review are mining billionaire andrew forrest s squadron energy marubeni and jera the world s biggest lng buyer which is a joint venture of tokyo electric power co and chubu electric power marubeni and jera believe that this project can be completed and commence the supply of lng to new south wales in a timely manner the japanese companies said in a statement
they said they would work with squadron on the feasibility study including marketing to potential customers and tapping jera s global network to line up lng supply
baulderstone and the companies declined to disclose their respective stakes in the consortium
general electric co is providing technical support and design services for development and construction of a power plant
australia s top power generator agl energy is also considering building an lng import terminal off neighbouring state of victoria to bring in up to million tonnes a year but that would mostly meet its own needs supplying its power stations and households
while lng is cheap at the moment prices are expected to rise in the early which could make it difficult to justify imports to australia said saul kavonic an analyst at consultants wood mackenzie
the economic case for australian lng imports remains marginal at best and is not guaranteed to happen he said
