rpt-exclusive-us investors seek to acquire russia's rosneft lien in citgo
repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text by alexandra ulmer washington feb reuters a group of investors is seeking washington s approval to acquire the nearly percent collateral in refiner citgo held by russia s largest energy firm rosneft one of the investors said
the move would prevent moscow from seizing a large part of the refiner in the event of a default by its current owner venezuelan state oil company pdvsa
citgo operates a barrel per day refining network in the united states
with venezuela s economy devastated by five years of recession president nicolas maduro s socialist government has increasingly turned to ally russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive offering prized oil assets in return
rosneft has snapped up some coveted oil fields in the opec nation giving it growing control over venezuelan crude exports and a stronger foothold in energy markets across the americas
venezuela handed rosneft the percent collateral in citgo in return for a billion loan two years ago
the remaining percent of shares in citgo is collateral to holders of pdvsa s bond
a steady decline in oil output venezuela s main source of hard currency has contributed to making the country chronically late on its bond payments in recent months
the russian state oil company has been under sanctions put in place in to punish moscow for aggression in ukraine
some senators have warned those sanctions could be violated should russia take a stake in citgo in the event of a pdvsa default
amid the outcry rosneft and pdvsa were negotiating swapping the collateral to avoid complications stemming from the sanctions but the talks do not appear to have prospered
some oil sources said pdvsa was unable to offer anything attractive enough to rosneft in return
in the meantime the group of investors has applied for a license from the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac to assume the lien according to the investor and documents seen by reuters
the investor asked to remain anonymous to avoid compromising a potential deal
the request to ofac submitted in early october has received basic technical approval but the group has yet to receive an answer from the trump administration
ofac did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the administration should recognize that if it doesn t do something here it will face limited options under almost any scenario whether it is an attempt to foreclose by the current lienholder further restrictions on venezuelan crude oil imports into the or even in the event there is a positive political change in caracas the investor said
under the plan no new debt would be issued
the investors would repay the outstanding loan balance and require that rosneft terminate its lien and assign the loan to the new investors
this is a private sector solution to a public policy problem the investor added
the investors see citgo as an attractive asset that could easily become highly profitable
trying to seize citgo is certainly not the plan the investor stressed
it is unclear whether rosneft whose powerful boss igor sechin is a close ally of russian president vladimir putin would be open to such an offer
the company declined to comment
pdvsa did not respond to a request for comment
the citgo deal has particularly worried washington with senators robert menendez and marco rubio writing treasury secretary steven mnuchin to express their concern in september
just as a matter of common sense it would be better if those assets were held by american investors than by rosneft said richard morningstar chairman of the global energy center at the atlantic council and a former energy official under barack obama
despite long delays in venezuela s debt payments the holders of the bonds some of the world s highest yielding debt have been reluctant to press their claims in court wary of a prolonged and messy litigation
that could yet change sparking a potential stampede to seize assets
foreign companies seeking compensation for nationalizations under venezuela s late leader hugo chavez have also objected to pdvsa using citgo as collateral alleging that venezuela was seeking to reduce its exposure to assets in the united states where they could potentially be seized
