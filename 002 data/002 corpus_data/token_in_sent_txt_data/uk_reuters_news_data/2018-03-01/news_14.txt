update 1-mexico to offer first-ever shale blocks in sept auction
fresh throughout adds details on auction previous tenders and background by adriana barrera mexico city march reuters mexico will auction development rights to shale blocks in september marking the first time the country has offered private oil companies the chance to develop the resource which has been booming in the united states for years
the national hydrocarbons commission cnh mexico s oil regulator on thursday launched a call for bids for its first shale tender including nine contractual areas that will be awarded on
the blocks are in mexico s burgos basin in the northwestern border state of tamaulipas where oil company pemex has drilled some exploratory wells in the past
cnh president juan carlos zepeda said companies that win development rights will be able to tap conventional oil and gas deposits as well as shale formations that may lie above or below
the auction s winners will have the right to explore and carry out activities at any depth throughout the column involving shale formations as well as conventional sand formations said zepeda
the nine blocks contain an estimated billion barrels of oil equivalent boe plus another million boe of conventional oil and gas resources according to energy ministry data
the blocks are believed to mostly contain natural gas
shale production will also carry a set of challenges
mexico is racked by gangland violence in states where the shale lies and it also lacks infrastructure from pipelines to roads sufficient to handle intensive shale projects
additionally the hydraulic fracturing used by the industry to break up shale deposits and get oil and gas to flow out also requires large amounts of water that arid northern mexico lacks
mexico s total prospective shale resources have been estimated at some billion barrels of oil equivalent
the shale potential is even larger than the country s deepwater resources in its territorial waters in the gulf where royal dutch shell is set to be the biggest producer in the years ahead after winning the most blocks at a january auction
the september auction will be the fourth for the final year of president enrique pena nieto s term
shallow water blocks will be on offer later this month and then conventional onshore areas in july
since a landmark energy reform was enacted in mexico has conducted eight oil and gas auctions awarding some contracts covering onshore and offshore acreage according the cnh which conducts the auctions and supervises the contracts
if successful the approximately contracts could be worth more than billion over their lifetime according to energy ministry estimates
the energy reform ended pemex s nearly years of monopoly control over the sector and paved the way for the auctions ending a constitutional prohibition on private companies operating fields on their own
despite a shale boom in the united states including lucrative plays near the border like the eagle ford formation similar geology that almost certainly extends into northern mexico has yet to take off
eagle ford has been heavily drilled and produces around million barrels per day bpd of a total of million bpd in output from the seven largest shale regions government data shows
interested companies might include mexico s newpek a unit of conglomerate alfa which has developed shale projects in texas and independent lewis energy which has operated on both sides of the border
alfa executives said on a february conference call that the company was in a good position to participate in mexican energy projects without specifying which ones
