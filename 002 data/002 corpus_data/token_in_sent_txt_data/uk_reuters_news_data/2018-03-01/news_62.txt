philippines' $2 bln lng project draws interest from tokyo gas, three others
manila march reuters there are at least four potential investors for the philippine government s planned liquefied natural gas lng import facility including tokyo gas co ltd a government energy official said on thursday
the southeast asian nation wants the terminal estimated to cost billion and located in batangas province south of the capital of manila built and operational ahead of the depletion by of its indigenous gas reserves at malampaya off palawan island
tokyo gas and the philippines first gen corp along with two other foreign companies are looking to invest in the project leonido pulido assistant secretary at the department of energy told reporters
tokyo gas made a presentation at the philippines energy department on a company spokesman said but did not give further details
first gen which runs most of the philippines natural power plants has expressed interest in joining the project a company spokeswoman said
pulido told the reporters he could not remember the names of the two other potential investors
if it s driven we believe construction will be a lot faster he said adding the project does not include the pipeline infrastructure that will also cost billions of pesos
in december energy secretary alfonso cusi said philippine national oil company pnoc may hold a minimum percent stake in the project
pnoc wants to spearhead the lng facility and has also been in talks with potential partners
construction which includes a million lng storage facility will take about months to complete said cusi who said then he wanted to issue the project permit within the year
a similar project by energy world corp built on pagbilao island in quezon province and capable of receiving million tonnes of lng a year is now almost complete
it expects to phase in a mw power plant near the lng terminal by the end of using imported lng
pulido believes both the batangas and pagbilao lng facilities can be viable
we feel the energy world hub will not adequately supply the industry that we re targeting he said adding the government is envisioning the use of lng for both power and industrial sectors
imported lng received via the batangas facility is expected to fuel five nearby power plants that can produced up to mw and currently run on malampaya gas
four of those plants are owned by first gen
