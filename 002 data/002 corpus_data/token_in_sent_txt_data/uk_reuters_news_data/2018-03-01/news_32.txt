vw tells court it did not break rules over dieselgate disclosure
hanover germany march reuters volkswagen s bosses missed warning signs ahead of its diesel emissions scandal but did not break market rules by delaying the disclosure of its problems the carmaker s lawyers said in a submission to a german court reviewed by reuters
investors from around the world are seeking billion euros billion in damages from volkswagen vw which they say didn t inform shareholders quickly enough over its use of illegal software to cheat tests on diesel engine emissions
about lawsuits nearly all from institutional investors have been lodged at a regional court in braunschweig near vw s wolfsburg headquarters seeking damages over the sharp fall in vw shares that followed its admission of wrongdoing
in a submission to the court on wednesday lawyers for europe s largest automaker said it had no duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations prior to when it issued an statement that the illegal software could be in around million cars worldwide although the company had admitted its cheating to authorities on it believed potential fines from regulators and vehicle refitting costs would not exceed million euros million and therefore would not lead to a significant drop in the stock price sources close to vw said
had the company believed the financial cost of its cheating could have reached billion euros or more it would have considered an earlier release the sources added
since the dieselgate scandal became public vw has set aside around billion to cover fines vehicle refits to remove the illegal defeat device software and other costs
in the past there have again and again been violations of the defeat device ban in environmental law but without the affected companies getting sanctioned in a draconian and hard way vw lawyers said in the submission
an escalation of the matter wasn t expected neither by the defendants nor by their advisers they added
the sources said former vw chief executive martin winterkorn who resigned within a week of the scandal breaking was informed in an internal memo in may that vw models had violated emissions rules and authorities would check whether the carmaker was using illegal software
however they said the implications of this were not grasped at the time
winterkorn said when he resigned that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part
public hearings of the case at the braunschweig court are due to start in early september
