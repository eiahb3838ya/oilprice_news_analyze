representatives for the department of state and treasury department did not have immediate comment
the joint ventures were reached when secretary of state rex tillerson was exxon s chief executive
tillerson has taken a hard line on russia as secretary of state in contrast to his position while at exxon
his tougher stance appears to be an effort to reassure allies and other friendly nations of washington s backing amidst concerns over president donald trump s relationship with russian president vladimir putin
tillerson has said sanctions imposed for russia s annexation of crimea would remain in place until crimea is returned to ukraine
he has accused moscow of imposing its will on other nations by force and employing disinformation and cyber attacks to subvert western democracies
the state department said on thursday tillerson had recused himself from issues involving exxon and did not discuss the withdrawal with exxon
a spokesperson would not comment on the company citing sanctions for the withdrawal
