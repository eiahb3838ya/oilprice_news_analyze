rpt-interview-venezuela presidential hopeful wants wall st. economist on team
repeats story first published on wednesday no change to text by andrew cawthorne and vivian sequera caracas feb reuters venezuelan presidential candidate henri falcon said on wednesday he would like a wall street economist who sees dollarization as the solution for in venezuela to play a big role on his team if he wins the upcoming election
falcon said francisco rodriguez a venezuelan who is chief economist at torino capital and advising him informally would be the ideal leader of his economic team should he defeat socialist president nicolas maduro
what is the cancer of venezuela apart from the government
the economy
so the economy is for specialists he told reuters during an interview at his new offices in caracas
francisco is a man with many qualifications but he is also a politician recognized internally and abroad we need to build a really good team led by a great economist that s francisco rodriguez one of the most influential analysts of venezuela s dysfunctional economy has recently been suggesting the bolivar currency should be scrapped for the dollar as an extreme measure to fix runaway inflation by stopping the government from printing excess money
rodriguez also believes venezuela in the fifth year of crippling recession that has left millions hungry and created widespread shortages would receive major help from international loan bodies like the world bank and international monetary fund under a new government
speaking to reuters earlier on wednesday on the sidelines of a caracas forum rodriguez confirmed he was giving informal advice to falcon
i m a friend i respect him he said
he told the forum falcon would make an excellent president
this country can not survive six more years of nicolas maduro this country doesn t deserve that he added
falcon a former state governor who has broken with an opposition boycott to run against maduro said he would prioritize repairing relations with washington should he win the vote slated for april
while most analysts give him little chance some recent polls actually put him ahead of maduro in voter preferences
the united states would have a potential ally in a new venezuelan government said falcon who defines himself as a in favor of both policies and strong welfare protection programs
falcon implied he disagreed with possible oil sanctions against opec member venezuela saying he opposed any measures that end up hurting the president donald trump s administration has already slapped some individual sanctions on officials it deems guilty of rights abuses or eroding democracy in venezuela and has also imposed measures to block new financing for the government
it is pondering measures against the oil sector if maduro does not improve conditions for the election which critics say has been rigged to legitimize falcon a former military man who supported the ruling socialists until a split has drawn the wrath of venezuela s opposition coalition by throwing his hat into the ring and undercutting their boycott policy
abstention is no use he said pointing to past boycotts that had given the socialists big uncontested wins and arguing that percent of venezuelans wanted change
in world history at least for the last two centuries no government has won an election at a time of he added citing the price of a box of eggs equivalent to nearly of the minimum monthly wage
prices in venezuela rose more than percent in the months to the end of january according to estimates by the country s national assembly broadly in line with independent economists figures
falcon is demanding improved election conditions including a later vote date observers an end to harassment of maduro opponents and the removal of government handout booths known as red spots to curry favor with voters often set up near polling centers
without guarantees he may withdraw his candidacy
falcon said he would like veteran venezuelan politician eduardo fernandez a former presidential candidate for opposition party copei to be his foreign minister
he would not be drawn on specific economic policy ideas beyond saying he wanted to prioritize tackling inflation and supported a unified currency exchange system instead of the current mix of government and black market rates
