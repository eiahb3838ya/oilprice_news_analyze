trump wades deeper into biofuel debate with second meeting
new york reuters president donald trump on thursday will gather rivals from the oil and corn industries for the second time this week as the administration seeks elusive common ground on reforms to the nation s controversial biofuels law
the meetings come amid rising concern in the white house over the current state of the renewable fuel standard rfs a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel which has increasingly divided two of trump s most important constituencies
a refining company philadelphia energy solutions pes in the key electoral state of pennsylvania last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy
a meeting earlier in the week ended with iowa republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst calling the white house efforts to help refiners cope with the regulation a threat to farmers and vowing to fight proposed changes
grassley and ernst along with republican senators ted cruz and pat toomey of refining states texas and pennsylvania will be in attendance again on thursday according to two sources familiar with the planning of the event
a number of companies will also be represented
executives from refiners valero energy corp delta air lines monroe energy and pbf energy inc will be there along with a union representative from the bankrupt pes the largest and oldest refiner on the east coast the sources said
the biofuel industry will be represented by officials from major producers poet and green plains inc along with others the two sources said
trump will be joined by environmental protection agency head scott pruitt and interior secretary ryan zinke who will be sitting in for agriculture secretary sonny perdue as he attends events in california they said
cruz s office and poet confirmed attendance to reuters
representatives for the other parties including the white house either did not respond or declined to comment
under the rfs refiners must cover the costs of blending increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation s gasoline and diesel each year
to prove compliance with the program they have to acquire credits called rins either by earning them through blending or by buying them
the price of rins has surged in recent years meaning refiners without blending facilities have faced higher costs
at tuesday s meeting grassley and ernst were asked to consider accepting a proposed ceiling on the price of rins in exchange for a concession to the ethanol that would allow broader sales of gasoline blends
senator ernst and i suggested specific policy changes that would be a for biofuels and oil
but we ve made it clear all along that a cap or waiver credit for rins would not be a grassley said following the meeting
perdue on wednesday tried to calm fears among farmers that trump is trying to reform the rfs in way that hurts the industry
i can tell you trump stands with corn farmers biofuel farmers and the rfs perdue told an audience at the commodity classic in anaheim california according to a recording heard by reuters
i stand with him and with reporting by jarrett renshaw editing by lisa shumaker
