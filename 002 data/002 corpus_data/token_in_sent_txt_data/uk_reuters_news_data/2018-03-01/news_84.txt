armenian parliament set to elect sarkissian as national president
yerevan march reuters armenia s parliament is set to elect armen sarkissian this week as national president to succeed serzh sarksyan who opposition leaders say could become prime minister and continue to wield power
sarkissian s election to a single term is unopposed because the ruling republican party supports him even though he is not a member of any party
one opposition party says it will back him while another has failed to gather sufficient votes to present its own candidate
armenia seceded from the soviet union in but remains dependent on russia for aid and investment
many armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning
the country is in line with some other former soviet republics and countries in eastern europe in moving away from direct democracy and towards strong central leadership according to analysts
sarksyan became president at an election in and nominated former prime minister sarkissian in january to succeed him as his term neared its end
sarkissian is a businessman and yerevan s ambassador to britain and the president said he had chosen him because of his experience as a diplomat and manager
the legislature can elect a president with a majority under the terms of a constitution approved in in a referendum that effectively abolishes direct presidential elections
this week s vote is likely to take place on thursday or friday
under that constitution however the presidency will become largely ceremonial and power will shift to the prime minister and parliament
everything has been done to create a super premier who will have the same rights as the current president and even more opposition mp edmond marukyan told reporters
sarksyan denies that the new constitution was engineered to allow him to continue to dominate armenia a country of around million people
but many members of the ruling party say sarksyan would be the best candidate for prime minister given his experience especially in negotiations over neighbouring azerbaijan s breakaway region
fighting between ethnic azeris and armenian separatists backed by armenia first erupted in and a ceasefire was agreed in
but azerbaijan and armenia accuse each other of violence around and along their common border
clashes over control of which lies inside azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic armenians have intensified in the past three years and turned into a violent of the conflict in april
the ruling party won parliamentary elections last april with percent of the vote while the opposition tsarukyan alliance took percent
