syria's ex-qaeda vies with rivals over control of northwest syria
amman reuters syrian jihadist rebels took back some ground on thursday from rival insurgent groups near syria s border with turkey after losing control of several towns to them in recent days rebels and residents said
the area in northwestern syria is their biggest remaining stronghold and since last year it has been in the grip of tahrir a jihadist alliance spearheaded by a former affiliate of al qaeda
last month two of its rivals joined forces in a new alliance of rebel groups affiliated with the free syrian army and in the past days they have pushed tahrir from several towns and villages
their attack on tahrir came against the backdrop of big street protests in some of the towns it controls in the area against the local civilian administration
however in fighting on wednesday and thursday it regained some territory and strengthened its position along the border with turkey an important strategic possession the rebels and residents said
syrian president bashar has gained momentum in the war since russia joined on his side in and has seized advantage of rebel at points in the conflict for military advantage
increased conflict in the northwest an area that includes idlib province and parts of aleppo province risks worsening the already dire situation of a million displaced people from other parts of syria who have fled there
turkey also closely watches developments in northwest syria where it has established several observation posts in recent months as part of an agreement with russia and iran to reduce warfare
the new alliance fighting against tahrir is called jabhat tahrir soria the liberation of syria front and was formed by two powerful groups called ahrar and nour
the clashes across several towns in both idlib and aleppo provinces in the last days have killed and wounded scores of people according to rebels from both sides
the fighting was close to camps where tens of thousands of civilians have taken shelter from recent heavy bombardment by the syrian government and russia s air force
more than two million people live in idlib province about half of them displaced people including rebel fighters and their families according to the united nations
in recent days tahrir pulled back many of its fighters to a string of positions along the turkish border witnesses said
they have moved to the area around the crossing where they are reinforcing their presence said bassam haji mustafa a senior official in the new alliance jabhat tahrir soria
they also launched to regain the village of kafr lusein near the border and to push back into other towns including maraat misreen
street protests against the civilian administrations linked to tahrir complained about financial levies imposed on local people which range from the licensing of pharmacies to issuing number plates for vehicles
let them first repel the regime and its militias from the doorsteps of idlib before trying to burden already suffering people said abdullah sheikh a trader in atma town
in two other towns khan sheikhoun and saraqeb local dignitaries have forced tahrir and other rebel groups to sign neutrality pacts to spare their towns from the
but the fear of an war among rebel factions long divided by both ideology and local power struggles has kept other insurgent groups on the sidelines containing the violence
