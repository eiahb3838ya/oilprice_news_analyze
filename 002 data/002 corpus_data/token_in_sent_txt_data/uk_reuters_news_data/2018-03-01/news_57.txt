cold snap drives polish power and gas demand to record highs
warsaw march reuters demand for power and gas in poland has set new records as freezing temperatures grip the country electricity grid operator pse and gas firm pgnig said on thursday
the cold snap has lasted a week and forecasters say it will continue until the weekend
the temperature in warsaw was minus celsius on thursday morning
day by day we beat historical records of daily gas sales pgnig deputy head maciej wozniak said in a statement
pgnig said it had sold more than million cubic metres of gas in the past hours which is around two thirds of a single shipment of liquefied natural gas lng that pgnig buys from qatar
imported lng via the terminal at the baltic sea is gradually reducing gas imports from russia s gazprom
last year around percent of all gas imported to poland came from russia compared with percent in
pgnig also said its gas stores were almost percent full more than at the same time last year
power grid operator pse said on thursday that electricity demand set a new record for a winter evening on wednesday at gigawatts gw up from gw on tuesday
poland which generates electricity mostly from ageing power stations faces the risk of power shortages when temperatures reach extreme levels as increased demand overloads the system
pse said there were no risks to power supplies at the moment
poland s biggest power distributors also said they had not recorded any major incidents related to the freezing temperatures
