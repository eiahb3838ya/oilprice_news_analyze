update 5-venezuela postpones presidential election to may 20
caracas reuters venezuela on thursday postponed its upcoming presidential vote to may in a move cementing an opposition split as socialist incumbent nicolas maduro seeks despite an economic crisis and global censure
the national election board said it had pushed the vote back from the original date of april following a pact between maduro s government and some opposition parties
the main opposition coalition is boycotting the poll saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a maduro s two strongest opposition rivals leopoldo lopez and henrique capriles are both barred from standing and most venezuelans view the election board as answerable to maduro
western nations and a dozen latin american neighbours have reprimanded maduro s government over unfair conditions for the vote and the united states is considering imposing sanctions on the opec member s crucial oil sector
breaking with the main opposition coalition however one prominent opposition leader henri falcon has launched his candidacy
the former state governor believes he can win even without the coalition s election machinery behind him by taking advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling socialists over a fifth year of gruelling recession
however opposition supporters in the camps of lopez and capriles have called falcon a sellout and are urging voters to stay away from the polls to isolate maduro and what they say will be a rigged win
sadly falcon succumbed to the temptation of participating and playing the dictatorship s game said juan pablo guanipa a leader in capriles justice first party
government stalwart jorge rodriguez said thursday s agreement with falcon s progressive advance party and some other movements was evidence of a reconciliatory spirit that undercut foreign criticism of autocratic rule in venezuela
venezuela is a model democracy for the whole world rodriguez who is communications minister told reporters at the election board headquarters
luis romero who leads falcon s party said the only way to bring about change was via the polls and not through protests similar to those that caused nearly deaths last year
venezuelans want to get rid of maduro but not by killing each other in the streets he said also speaking at the election board in downtown caracas
as well as a change in the date falcon is demanding reforms of the election board observers and the end of state handouts close to voting booths on election days
he told reuters he may pull out if guarantees are not given
a former military man who broke with the ruling socialists in falcon styles himself a favouring policies with strong social welfare programs

maduro also lifted venezuelans food ticket allowance percent to bolivars a month the equivalent of
bucking most analysts consensus several polls have shown falcon stands a chance of defeating maduro
a survey of people in early february by datanalisis said that in a race falcon would defeat maduro by percent to percent of likely voters
maduro says venezuela s election system is clean and accuses the united states of leading a international conspiracy to end socialism and take over his nation s oil
the election board said on thursday that local and state legislature votes will also take place on may
