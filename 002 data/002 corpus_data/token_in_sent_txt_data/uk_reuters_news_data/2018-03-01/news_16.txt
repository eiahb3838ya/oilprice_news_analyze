update 1-australian federal government buys hydropower assets from states for $4.8 bln
australia s govt takes control of hydro scheme from states clears way for planned expansion of generation states to spend bln sale proceeds on infrastructure adds ministerial quote and background sydney march reuters australia s federal government said on friday it had purchased hydroelectric assets from the states of victoria and new south wales for a billion billion clearing its path to proceed with a national scheme to expand hydro generation
under pressure to plug power supply gaps which have led to blackouts as well as cap soaring prices prime minister malcolm turnbull announced plans last year to expand hydro generation in australia s southeast by around percent
owning the assets itself makes it simpler for the national government to go ahead without the states controlling snowy hydro ltd the holding company that runs the giant scheme
it will enable snowy to go ahead minister for the environment and energy josh frydenberg told australian broadcasting radio referring to the government s expansion plan
will create new jobs more power for new homes as well as lowering people s power bill and helping to stabilise the energy under the deal victoria state will receive just under a billion and new south wales will receive a billion for their shares in snowy hydro ltd which operates a giant hydroelectric scheme in australia s snowy mountains
the states agreed to spend the proceeds on other infrastructure projects under the deal which must be approved by the federal and victorian parliament before it takes effect a statement from the federal government said
the national plan would add megawatts of capacity to what is already the country s biggest hydro scheme and cost as much as a billion
a feasibility study last year found the project was viable and technically feasible but it still requires a final investment decision in hinging partly on major upgrades of transmission lines
if approved the first power is expected in late at the earliest
the federal government said it would keep snowy hydro ltd in public ownership and make no changes to employment levels or water allocation
