rpt-exclusive-u.s. mulls sanctions on venezuela to put pressure on maduro -source
washington feb reuters the trump administration is considering sanctioning a venezuelan oil services company and restricting insurance coverage for venezuelan oil shipments to ratchet up pressure on socialist president nicolas maduro a official said on wednesday
with maduro running for another term in an april election that washington and its allies oppose as a sham the united states is weighing sanctions that would target venezuela s vital oil sector beyond what has been done before the official told reuters
some measures could come before the vote and others could be imposed afterwards
the official who is close to internal deliberations on venezuela policy and spoke on condition of anonymity would not rule out an eventual ban on venezuelan oil shipments to the united states among the toughest of sanctions
i think it would cause a fairly strong shock to the oil market in the short term the official said
the official stressed that no decisions have been made and that any action would take into consideration potential harm to ordinary venezuelans already suffering from food shortages and hyperinflation and the country s neighbors as well as the impact on the oil industry and american consumers
venezuela was the fourth largest supplier of crude oil and products to the united states in according to the energy information administration
its crude oil sales to the united states last year were the lowest since according to thomson reuters trade flows data
oil sanctions are not taken lightly the official said
this would be a fairly strong escalation for policy whether it s a complete oil sanction or salami slices of different graduated the administration of president donald trump is also weighing possible sanctions against additional senior military and political figures including socialist party no
diosdado cabello the official said
experts say individual sanctions have had little or no impact on the venezuelan government s policies
maduro himself sanctioned last year regularly laughs off washington s disapproval and blames the empire for venezuela s economic woes
venezuela s information ministry did not respond to a request for comment on potential further sanctions
washington s crafting of new sanctions comes as venezuela s opposition coalition is boycotting the april election citing fraudulent conditions including a ban on its top two candidates from running
even if venezuelan authorities delay the election by a month or two the official said that likely would not prompt the administration to hold back on sanctions
the best tool for making the venezuelan government feel economic pain government sources say is through sectoral sanctions such as financial measures announced in august that barred banks from any new debt deals with venezuelan authorities or oil giant pdvsa
venezuela s foreign minister jorge arreaza said in geneva on tuesday that sanctions are making foreign debt renegotiation more difficult and causing panic at global banks
new sanctions under consideration according to the administration official would be intended to to make the world a little smaller for these corrupt among the possible new targets is camimpeg venezuela s oil services firm the official said
with maduro s approval venezuela s powerful military in founded camimpeg which is geared to providing pdvsa with assistance in drilling logistics and security
little is known about camimpeg s activities
the opposition says the armed forces are a nest of corruption and the unpopular maduro has sought to buy the support of military chiefs by giving them increasing control of the opec nation s crude reserves the world s largest
another option would be sanctions aimed at putting restrictions on insurance coverage for oil tankers and oil cargos involving pdvsa the official said
oil exports are typically protected by insurance on tankers as well as on the actual cargo
without insurance a vessel can not navigate in international waters which means venezuela s oil exports would likely be curtailed
sanctions on cargo insurance would also hurt because pdvsa has a limited tanker fleet
in addition the trump administration is continuing to consider blocking the sale of lighter crude and refined products that venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports the official told reuters
there s a host of additional sanctions that could be imposed
the president has all those before him said
senator marco rubio who has played a key role in pushing for trump s more assertive approach to venezuela than his predecessor barack obama
the goal here is to continue to pressure an illegitimate regime so that they would leave power or be removed from power rubio told reuters in an interview on wednesday
