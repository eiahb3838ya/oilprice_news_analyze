ge to develop world's largest wind turbine in france
paris reuters general electric plans to invest more than million over the next three to five years to develop the world s biggest offshore wind turbine which will have a capacity of megawatts and stand meters feet tall
with blades longer than a soccer field the turbine will produce enough power for up to households ge said in a statement
we want to lead in the technologies that are driving the global energy transition ceo john flannery said
ge renewable energy will develop and manufacture the new turbine largely in france and aims to supply its first nacelle or power generating unit for demonstration in and ship the first turbines in
the firm will invest close to million in a new blade manufacturing plant in cherbourg western france which will open in
it will also invest close to million over the next five years to modernize its factory where the nacelles for the will be built
ge already a major global player in onshore wind entered the offshore wind turbine market through its takeover of france s alstom in
ge said the new turbine which will have a power generator rather than a gearbox will be percent bigger than its nearest competitors
in june mhi vestas a joint venture between vestas and mitsubishi heavy industries launched a mw offshore turbine currently the world s most powerful wind turbine
standing meters tall and with blades it is an upgrade of mhi vestas mw turbine which is already in operation at the burbo bank extension and blyth offshore wind farms in britain
mhi vestas has also been named preferred supplier for britain s triton knoll and moray east offshore wind farms for a total of of the mw turbines
an mhi vestas spokesman declined to comment on future turbine development
the size of offshore wind turbines which unlike onshore turbines is not limited by overland truck transport has grown rapidly in recent years as bigger turbines capture more wind and reduce maintenance costs and capital spending
onshore wind turbines in europe have average capacities of about megawatt less than half the mw average capacity of offshore turbines according to trade group wind europe
