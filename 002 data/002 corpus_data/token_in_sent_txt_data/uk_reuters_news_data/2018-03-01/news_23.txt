exclusive-u.s. considering broad oil sanctions on venezuela -source
washington reuters the trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on a venezuelan oil services company and restricting insurance coverage for venezuelan oil shipments to increase pressure on socialist president nicolas maduro a official said
with maduro running for another term in an election that washington and its allies regard as a sham the united states is weighing sanctions that would target venezuela s vital oil sector beyond what has been done before the official told reuters on wednesday
some measures could come before the vote and others could be imposed afterwards
the official who is close to internal deliberations on venezuela policy and who spoke on condition of anonymity would not rule out an eventual ban on venezuelan oil shipments to the united states among the toughest of sanctions
i think it would cause a fairly strong shock to the oil market in the short term the official said
the official stressed that no decisions have been made and that any action would take into consideration potential harm to ordinary venezuelans already suffering from food shortages and hyperinflation and the country s neighbours as well as the impact on the oil industry and consumers
venezuela s information ministry did not respond to a request for comment on potential further sanctions
maduro himself subject to sanctions last year regularly laughs off washington s disapproval and blames the empire for his country s economic woes saying it is trying to undermine venezuela s leftist government
venezuela was the fourth largest supplier of crude oil and products to the united states in according to the energy information administration
its crude oil sales to the united states last year were the lowest since according to thomson reuters trade flows data
oil sanctions are not taken lightly the official said
this would be a fairly strong escalation for policy whether it s a complete oil sanction or salami slices of different graduated president donald trump s administration is also considering possible sanctions against additional military and political figures including socialist party no
diosdado cabello the official said
experts say sanctions on individuals have had little or no impact on the venezuelan government s policies
washington s crafting of new sanctions comes as venezuela s main opposition coalition is boycotting the election citing fraudulent conditions
venezuela s election board postponed the presidential vote from april to the second half of may on thursday after an agreement between the government and some opposition parties
critics had accused venezuelan authorities of holding the vote early in the year to the opposition
the official had said before news of the date change that even if venezuelan authorities delayed the election by a month or two it was not likely to prompt washington to hold back on sanctions
the best tool for making the venezuelan government feel economic pain government sources say is through sectoral sanctions such as financial measures announced in august that barred banks from any new debt deals with venezuelan authorities or oil giant pdvsa
venezuela s foreign minister jorge arreaza said in geneva on tuesday that sanctions are making foreign debt renegotiation more difficult and causing panic at global banks
among the possible new targets is camimpeg venezuela s oil services firm the official said
camimpeg provides pdvsa with assistance in drilling logistics and security and was founded by the military in although little is known about its activities
the opposition says the armed forces are a nest of corruption and accuse maduro of trying to buy the support of military chiefs by giving them increasing control of the opec nation s crude reserves the world s largest
another option would be sanctions aimed at putting restrictions on insurance coverage for oil tankers and oil cargos involving pdvsa the official said
oil exports are typically protected by insurance on tankers as well as on the cargo
without insurance a vessel can not navigate in international waters which means venezuela s oil exports would likely be curtailed
sanctions on cargo insurance would also hurt because pdvsa has a limited tanker fleet
the trump administration is still considering blocking the sale of lighter crude and refined products that venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports the official told reuters
there s a host of additional sanctions that could be imposed
the president has all those before him
senator marco rubio said in an interview with reuters
rubio has pushed for trump to take a tougher line on venezuela than former president barack obama
in a commentary in the miami herald rubio called for a united front of disaffected government insiders and military personnel with popular support from the venezuelan people to remove the official interviewed by reuters reiterated the administration s stance that it is not seeking regime the venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment on rubio s remarks
maduro and other senior officials have frequently accused the united states of trying to provoke a coup
the trump administration has also pressed cuba venezuela s ally to stop propping up maduro the official said
cuba has long depended on caracas for oil supplies that have fallen off amid venezuela s crisis
cuba has provided venezuela with doctors and other services
authorities have said that includes a political and security advisory role
asked whether washington could impose sanctions on cuban officials the official said i m not prepared to comment on that but added that the administration was looking at all options necessary to pressure venezuela
the cuban government did not respond to a request for comment
