update 4-snow-hit ukraine faces gas squeeze as gazprom holds back supplies
reuters kiev and moscow plunged into a new gas dispute on thursday after russia s gazprom unexpectedly decided not to restart supplies forcing ukraine to cut usage despite freezing weather
ukraine s energy firm naftogaz said it would ask heating firms to use percent less gas for four days from saturday
it also said it would seek compensation from gazprom
the row threatens to open a new front in a legal battle between the companies a of broader political tension following russia s annexation of crimea in and support for separatists in eastern ukraine
it follows wednesday s international arbitration court order for gazprom to pay billion to naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and related to gas supplies and transit
on thursday gazprom said it had returned a prepayment to ukraine and would not restart gas supplies as an additional agreement to the existing arrangements had still not been reached
it did not give further details
clearly gas supplies to ukraine s naftogaz will not be carried out from march gazprom s deputy head alexander medvedev said in a statement
the decision is connected to the stockholm arbitration court dispute because in one of its rulings the court ordered naftogaz to buy billion cubic metres of gas from gazprom annually from
the march deliveries would have been the first time ukraine bought gas from russia since november when it started buying gas from europe via reverse flows to try to cut its energy dependency on moscow
reverse flows refer to buying russian gas that has first been exported to another country
naftogaz said it would seek damages from gazprom for its failure to restart daily deliveries of million cubic metres of gas which has forced it to take emergency measures to make up for the shortage at a time when a cold snap has blanketed most of ukraine with heavy snow
these include cutting consumption and buying extra supplies from europe naftogaz chief executive andriy kobolev said in televised comments
these steps should be sufficient in order not to create a gas deficit in the system he said
in later comments kobolev said gazprom s decision meant naftogaz was no longer bound by a clause in their agreement that requires buyers to pay for gas whether they take physical delivery or not
they can not demand take or pay from us in news agency interfax ukraine quoted him as saying
meanwhile gazprom said earlier on thursday it would contest the stockholm order for it to pay naftogaz billion
gazprom will defend its rights by all available means in accordance with the applicable law it said in a statement
disagreements between gazprom and naftogaz predate the collapse in relations between ukraine and russia in following the uprising in kiev that ousted a president
pricing disputes in the past led to russian gas supplies disruptions to europe via ukraine including in and
since then russia has been pushing for new pipeline projects via the baltic and black seas to bypass ukraine
