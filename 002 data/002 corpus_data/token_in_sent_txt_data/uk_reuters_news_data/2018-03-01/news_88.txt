tangshan located in china s northern hebei province had originally put the alert in place from due to heavy smog
an orange alert the severe in china s pollution warning system after red is issued when forecast readings of particulate matter with a width of microns known as are above microgams per cubic metres for three consecutive days including one day above micrograms
the alert last week ordered tangshan sintering plants to stop production for hours and then operate for a maximum of hours before stopping again
coke plants must extend their production time to over hours meaning less dust will be produced during the process
factories in heavily polluted tangshan have been forced to cut production by as much as percent during china s winter months as part of a targeted environmental protection campaign
the city which accounts for about percent of the country s steel output said last month it would extend restrictions on production after the end of the winter heating season on march
it plans to ask mills to cut utilisation rates by percent from march to to improve air quality
shanghai s most traded steel rebar contract was up percent at yuan pounds a tonne at gmt reaching its highest in nearly three months
