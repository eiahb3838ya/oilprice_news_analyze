at “america first energy conference”, solar power is dumb, climate change is fake
new orleans reuters pumping carbon dioxide into the air makes the planet greener the united nations puts out fake science about climate change to control the global energy market and wind and solar energy are simply dumb
these are among the messages that flowed from the america first energy conference in new orleans this week hosted by some of the country s most vocal climate change doubters and attended by a handful of trump administration officials
the second annual conference organized by the conservative thinktank the heartland institute pulled together speakers from junkscience the committee for a constructive tomorrow and the center for industrial progress along with officials from the department of interior and the white house for panels that included carbon taxes cap trade and other bad ideas fiduciary malpractice the sustainable investment movement and why emissions are not creating a climate the conference reflected the political rise of global warming skeptics in donald trump s america that is occurring despite mounting scientific evidence including from government agencies that burning oil coal and natural gas is heating the planet and leading to drought floods wildfires and more frequent powerful storms
a similar conference blasting the link between fossil fuels and climate change last year drew protection agency chief scott pruitt who was appointed by trump to reverse climate initiatives and roll back regulation hindering drillers and miners but who has since resigned in a flurry of ethical controversies
the officials who joined included white house special assistant brooke rollins interior department assistant secretary joe balash and jason funes an assistant in the office of external affairs at interior
they praised the administration s moves to clear the way for oil industry activity and steered clear of commenting on climate change
but their presence gave climate change doubters at the conference a boost it s a step in the right direction said climate change doubter roy spencer a principal research scientist at the university of alabama referring to the officials in attendance
in an email interior department spokeswoman heather swift said department officials speak at thousands of conferences every year and share ideas with a diverse group of a white house spokesperson did not immediately comment
tim huelskamp president and ceo of the heartland institute said the views presented at the conference once on the fringes of politics would be proven right
the leftist claims about sea level rise are overblown overstated or frankly just wrong he said in an interview
regarding the united nations findings on climate change he said it was fake science motivated by a desire for power and evidence of sea level rise however is strewn across the state that hosted the conference
new orleans has been ravaged repeatedly by hurricanes that scientists say will become stronger and more frequent due to climate change
and the rest of louisiana is losing coastline at one of the fastest rates on the planet due to sea level rise and encroaching industry according to the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration
it s a nice world they live in said steve cochran campaign director of restore the mississippi river delta an environmental consortium involved in coastal restoration programs referring to the attendees of the america first energy conference
it s not the world we live the governor s office of louisiana a state that has earmarked tens of billions of dollars to fend off coastal erosion and relocate a native american tribe from a sinking offshore island did not respond to requests for comment about the conference
in the conference exhibit hall the words coming soon in big orange letters framed a heartland institute advertisement for the fifth volume in its climate change reconsidered book series
attendees also passed around a book titled dumb energy a rant against wind and solar the more than speakers praised trump for withdrawing from the paris climate accords a global agreement to fight climate change mainly by cutting carbon emissions and for rolling back regulations to allow oil companies to lead the biggest energy surge in the nation s history
but they warned that proponents of the oil and gas boom are still locked in an epic struggle with climate activists in academia and within federal agencies
the deep state is real said congressman clay higgins a louisiana republican addressing the conference
they re certainly higgins joked about renewable energy sources like wind and solar saying there is probably a conference somewhere in the united states where people are talking about how the future of the world s engine will be provided by rainbow dust and unicorn david legates professor of climatology at the university of delaware argued that increased carbon dioxide emissions will not only leave the planet unharmed but benefit plant life by allowing them to consume water more efficiently
so you would expect therefore that this will be a greener planet legates said
funes of the interior department spoke on a panel called the future of coal oil and natural gas alongside joe leimkuhler vice president of drilling at llog exploration and fred palmer who joined heartland in after retiring from coal company peabody energy
oil production under president trump has increased million barrels per day since the beginning of his administration funes said
the is exporting four times as much oil as it exported a decade on the sidelines of the conference funes said he only attended the conference to speak about the nation s surging oil production and he refused to comment about the views of other speakers
efforts to reach balash and rollins were unsuccessful
but on the dinner keynote address balash embraced the most obvious mutual terrain between the conference organizers and the trump administration the deregulation push
last year this administration rolled back regulations for every one that it proposed balash said
unfortunately i think we need about a decade of that to get back to a reasonable editing by richard valdmanis and paul thomasch
