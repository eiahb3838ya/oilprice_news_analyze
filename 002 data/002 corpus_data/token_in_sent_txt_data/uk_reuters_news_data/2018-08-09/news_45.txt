south africa's eskom reaches "in principle" wage deal with unions
johannesburg aug reuters south african power utility eskom and trade unions reached an in principle wage deal the company said late on wednesday potentially ending weeks of tense negotiations that have lead to power outages in africa s most industrialised economy
last week eskom offered the three main unions a salary increase of percent this year and percent next year and in plus an increase in housing allowances and a cash payment of rand
the offer was accepted by the solidarity union last week while the two larger unions national union of mineworkers num and national union of metalworkers of south africa numsa said they would consider it
wage talks between eskom and trade unions primarily num and numsa ended without a signed agreement although the unions have in principle accepted eskom s offer said eskom spokesperson khulu phasiwe
in a statement released late on wednesday the power firm said the two unions wanted members who participated in an illegal strike to not face disciplinary action a condition eskom rejected
eskom did however agree to a request by the unions for a meeting with minister of state firms pravin gordhan and the firm s board
the power utility which generates more than percent of the country s power is desperate to end the work stoppages and push ahead with a turnaround plan that is centrepiece of president cyril ramaphosa s pledge to reform the economy
