palestinians turn to the sun to reduce their power shortfall
reuters from orderly rows of solar panels in a field in the west bank to the chaotic rooftops of gaza palestinians are hoping that harnessing the energy of the sun can reduce their dependence on israel for electricity
the west bank only gets around of the power its million people need imported mostly from israel and to a far lesser extent jordan
in the gaza strip power generation is so paltry that even with imports from israel and egypt it gets just of what it needs so the million gazans struggle on with an average of just four hours of electricity a day
individuals have taken it on themselves to install solar panels trailing cables down the side of buildings to keep fans whirring or to power televisions and other appliances
the number of panels in the enclave has increased in four years and they are now dotted on most rooftops and balcony on homes schools hospitals shops banks and mosques in a place where the sun shines days a year
in gaza s nusseirat refugee camp sabreen abu shawiesh said installing solar panels on the metal roof of her house had changed her family s life we almost had no electricity nowadays fans are working all the sun may be free but the technology is not and palestinians say their ability to import solar panels has been hampered by israeli border controls
in gaza which has endured years of israeli and egyptian sanctions aimed at isolating islamist hamas which rules the territory tensions raised by weekly border protest since march have increased the problem
israel has blocked all imports into the enclave except for humanitarian supplies
even before then entrepreneurs in gaza say they have sometimes been banned from importing various kinds of batteries including those used for solar power by israel on the grounds that they might be used for military purposes
a spokesman for israel s coordinator of government activities in the territories said israel had not imposed any import restrictions on solar panel technology and did not consider it to be dual purpose
in the west bank ruled by president mahmoud abbas s palestinian authority the public and private sectors have launched projects to diversify power sources to get cheaper electricity and more
the government is in dire need of individual initiatives and investments to provide power so that it can become independent of the occupation israel step by step shifa abu sa adi head of natural resources at the palestinian economy ministry told reuters
the authority s palestinian investment fund pif plans to build three solar farms and put solar energy into schools
the three new plants will generate megawatts per day
the west bank needs megawatts but currently only megawatts are available
larger solar projects would require more land but it is scarce because under the oslo peace accords of the israel retains control of much of the land of the west bank
we will be in a good position if we reach or per cent of the required electricity supply for palestine in general from solar energy said azem bishara chief executive officer of massader a subsidiary of the pif
bishara said massader intended to invest million in renewable energy over the next six years to generate an additional megawatts
the gaza strip only has one power plant which generated megawatts in when it was built but now only produces megawatts
the enclave imports megawatts from egypt and from israel
this is less than a third of the strip s daily needs estimated at up to megawatts a day
last week the european union completed gaza s biggest solar farm which will provide megawatts per day to fuel the southern gaza desalination plant also funded by the eu
deputy special coordinator for middle east peace process jamie mcgoldrick this week urged israel to allow emergency fuel needed for backup generators at vital health water and sanitation operations
the of million people half of whom are children is at stake
it is unacceptable that palestinians in gaza are repeatedly deprived of the most basic elements of a dignified life mcgoldrick said
israel s defence ministry had no immediate comment
