reuters iranian president hassan rouhani told north korea s foreign minister that the united states can not be trusted tehran s state media said as the united states seeks a deal to rein in the north s nuclear and missile programmes
north korea for its part denounced the united states for its outdated acting script in pressuring the north with continued sanctions but said it was still prepared to meet its obligations after a historic north summit in singapore in june
iran dismissed a offer from washington for talks this week saying it could not negotiate after the trump administration reneged on a deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on iran s own nuclear programme
north korea s top diplomat ri yong ho visited iran as the united states reintroduced sanctions against the islamic republic
the administration performance in these years has led the country to be considered untrustworthy and unreliable around the world which does not meet any of its obligations rouhani was quoted by the islamic republic news agency irna as telling ri on wednesday
in the current situation friendly countries should develop their relations and cooperation in the international community he said adding iran and north korea have always had close views on many issues
ri travelled to tehran after attending a security forum in singapore where he and secretary of state mike pompeo sparred over an agreement made at june s landmark summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un
the two sides vowed to work towards north korea s denuclearisation at the summit but have since struggled to reach a deal to meet that goal with the united states insisting sanctions pressure must be maintained
north korea s foreign ministry said on thursday it had stopped testing missiles and conducting nuclear tests followed by dismantling the nuclear test ground and yet the united states still had insisted on denuclearisation first
north korea nevertheless went ahead with the return of the remains of soldiers killed in the korean war it said
we hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust existing between the dprk north korea and the and to establishing mutual trust it said in a statement carried by the north s kcna news agency
however the responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure against the the united states was attempting to invent a pretext for increased sanctions against the dprk by mobilising all their servile mouthpieces and intelligence institutions to fabricate all kinds of falsehoods as long as the denies even the basic decorum for its dialogue partner and clings to the outdated acting script which the previous administrations have all tried and failed one can not expect any progress in the implementation of the joint statement including the denuclearisation we remain unchanged in our will to uphold the intentions of the top leaders of the dprk and the and to build trust and implement in good faith the joint statement step by step
the should even at this belated time respond to our sincere efforts in a corresponding ri told rouhani that washington s pullout from the pact and restoration of sanctions was an action against international rules and regulations irna said
north korea s strategic policy is to deepen relations with the islamic republic of iran and confront unilateralism he said
