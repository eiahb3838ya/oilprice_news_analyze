update 2-power price surge jolts australia's agl to record profit, but political heat grows
profit jumps pct to top a bln agl expects little to no profit growth this year weaker wholesale power prices retail war to bite agl shares down pct state ministers to debate key energy policy on friday recasts throughout adds agl ceo fund manager comments by sonali paul aug reuters agl energy australia s biggest power producer said annual profit jumped nearly a third to a record amid soaring prices that have brought growing political heat on the firm and its peers to slash household electricity bills
but agl shares slumped percent on thursday as it warned it expects almost no profit growth this year with wholesale prices dropping and a retail war persisting
the record result came a day ahead of a key meeting of state energy ministers to consider a policy designed to boost power supply and lower prices while cutting carbon emissions ending a decade of dispute between green energy proponents and those focused on costs and security of supply
policy certainty is key to encouraging further investment in generation supply which will place downward pressure on electricity prices and ultimately benefit customers agl chief executive andy vesey told analysts
agl backs the new policy dubbed the national energy guarantee
the company reported an underlying profit of a billion million for the year ended june above analysts forecasts
but its outlook for a profit between a million and a billion for fiscal was weaker than expected sending its shares lower in a broader market that was trading higher
it does show there are pressures in the business eating away at it that s why guidance was a bit tepid versus expectations
but it s still a good profit said jason teh chief investment officer at vertium asset management which does not own agl shares citing the challenges the company faces
agl said high wholesale power prices over the past year were largely due to the shutdown of two power stations over the previous two years but said prices had peaked
at the same time it warned that an ongoing war for household and business customers where its biggest rivals are origin energy and energy australia will eat into its profit margin
we believe the level of competitive intensity we see in the market now will continue vesey said
to offset the margin squeeze agl has set out to cut operating costs by percent over the next three years with a million in cuts targeted for this year
while facing heat to cut household power bills agl has also been pressed by the government to keep its ageing liddell power station open beyond or sell it to ensure there is for intermittent wind and solar power generation
agl has instead opted to replace liddell s capacity with a a billion combination of plants an upgrade of another plant renewable power and possibly some energy storage including pumped hydro
