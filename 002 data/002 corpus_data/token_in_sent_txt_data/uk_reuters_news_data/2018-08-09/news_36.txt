after soybeans, eu touts u.s. lng imports to woo trump on trade
brussels reuters the european union said it was delivering on a deal with president donald trump to buy more liquefied natural gas lng on thursday but called on washington to do more to make its prices competitive
in talks to urge trump to drop hefty new tariffs last month the eu s chief executive juncker agreed to work to increase imports of soybeans and lng to the bloc
the eu has long worked to diversify away from relying on russia for almost percent of its gas needs by developing lng infrastructure to access other suppliers like the united states
whether lng imports can win market share away from russia however will depend on market forces eu officials are quick to stress
the growing exports of liquefied natural gas if priced competitively could play an increasing and strategic role in eu gas supply juncker said in a statement
but the needs to play its role in doing away with red tape restrictions he said referring to rules that require regulatory approval for lng exports to europe
since the arrival of the first lng supplies in cumulative imports to the bloc have reached billion cubic metres the eu said on thursday
in europe accounted for more than percent of total lng exports up from percent in it said
spain france and italy are the largest of nine eu member states purchasing gas
the eu s decision to publish historic trade data is unusual part of the bloc s drive to sway trump by showing trade flows can benefit the united states
earlier this month the european commission published data showing a surge in soybean imports so far this year as buyers responded to plunging prices after china largely stopped buying soybeans in a trade row
both sides have much to gain by working together juncker added
trump said in a tweet last month that the eu would be buying vast amounts of lng while juncker said the eu would build more terminals to handle american lng
however of europe s existing import facilities lie empty while demand for lng on the continent remains limited
the most lucrative markets for lng are in south and central america india and the far east with europe near the bottom of the pile given its relatively low prices and ample supplies of gas via pipelines from russia and norway
