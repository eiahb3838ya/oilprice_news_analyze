the views expressed are his own table by john kemp london aug reuters the shift in oil market power away from opec towards a bilateral relationship between saudi arabia and russia is the culmination of structural changes in oil production over the last years
these shifts are deeply structural and have little to do with the personality or negotiating skills of individual oil ministers which arguably attract far too much attention from commentators and journalists
most of these changes can be traced back for years or more though some of them have recently accelerated such as the recent slump in output from venezuela and libya
to the extent that production is an important component of market power the very different fortunes of opec countries have significantly redistributed power within the organisation
the result is that the focus of has shifted from negotiations to negotiations with russia oil market enters era reuters
competition opec was founded in to reduce harmful competition over taxes royalties and oil ownership between its original members as they tried to attract investment from the international oil companies
the principal aim of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries shall be the coordination and unification of the petroleum policies of member countries according to opec s founding statute
the five founding members saudi arabia iran iraq kuwait and venezuela accounted for a significant share of the world s undeveloped oil reserves and were among the producers
opec s initial focus was on creating a united front in negotiations with the international oil companies to secure a greater share of revenues from the sale of oil
the addition of libya united arab emirates algeria and nigeria added other major reserve holders and rapidly growing producers to cement opec s negotiating power
opec s practical focus has shifted over time from taxes and royalty rates to equity ownership of reserves prices onwards and production allocations onwards
the organisation s market power arguably peaked in when members accounted for just over half of all oil production worldwide before sliding to around a quarter in and partially recovering in the years since then
in the early years opec was dominated by an internal balance of power between saudi arabia iran and venezuela with other countries playing a more peripheral though occasionally disruptive role
in these three countries were producing roughly the same amount about million barrels per day each statistical review of world energy bp
by saudi arabia had already pulled significantly ahead million bpd of both iran million bpd and venezuela million bpd a gap that has widened in the subsequent decades
opec members can be broadly divided into winners and losers since based on whether they increased output by
the biggest winners have been saudi arabia million bpd iraq million bpd united arab emirates million bpd angola million bpd and qatar million bpd
the biggest losers have been libya million bpd venezuela million bpd and iran million bpd with other members occupying an intermediate position
the winners have mostly benefited from stable government significant investment some of it foreign and technical expertise
the losers have been hit by conflict sanctions unrest corruption and mismanagement
some countries have bounced back from earlier setbacks notably iraq which experienced severe production losses during the and early as a result of war and sanctions
some have suffered more recent problems such as libya s descent into tribal conflict from which they may recover in time
others have experienced a patchy production history throughout the last few decades such as venezuela and nigeria which has recently taken a sharp turn for the worse in the case of venezuela
as a result saudi arabia and to some extent the united arab emirates have become much more powerful while iran and venezuela have been relegated to a more peripheral status
moreover saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the only members with significant production flexibility and contributed most of the voluntary output cuts under the december production agreement
other members of the organisation generally produce as much as they are technically able because their immediate revenue needs are enormous
to the extent countries such as nigeria libya and venezuela have cut production the loss of output has been forced upon them by unrest and mismanagement
negotiations between the and the most intense negotiations occurred within opec as members tried to reach a common position among themselves and only then negotiate with producers outside the organisation
but the shifting balance of production and power has made negotiations much less important and put much more emphasis on negotiations especially with a resurgent russia
sanctions and unrest have sidelined iran libya venezuela and to some extent nigeria largely relegating them to bystanders within opec negotiations
of the remaining opec members kuwait and the united arab emirates have coordinated their production policies closely with saudi arabia for the last two decades
the changing balance of power has left saudi arabia as the undisputed leader of opec and free to concentrate on negotiations with outside countries principally russia
instead of negotiating production allocations around a conference table at opec headquarters in vienna which was the focus for between the and the most important negotiations are now bilateral between saudi arabia and russia
the shift should not come as a surprise to observers of opec
the balance of power and the content of negotiations has changed repeatedly in the last six decades
it may not be the last shift
if iraq s production continues to climb it will become harder to ignore and the balance of power will shift again
output in iran venezuela and libya could eventually recover or nigeria could return to growth also challenging saudi arabia s control
for the time being however saudi arabia s leadership is undisputed and the negotiations that matter are with russia
