update 2-danish energy group orsted buys u.s onshore wind developer
copenhagen reuters danish energy group orsted has agreed to buy onshore wind farm developer lincoln clean energy lce in a million deal aiming to gain a foothold in what it sees as a key growth market

orsted which has so far mainly developed offshore wind farms in europe said the global market for onshore wind power is expected to grow significantly in coming years and that the united states is a key market
we see this as a very valuable addition to building a platform for growth in the market across technologies chief executive henrik poulsen told journalists
the company previously known as dong energy said in february it was looking at investments in energy storage solar projects and onshore wind
it was previously involved in onshore wind but sold the business in due to financial challenges
orsted shares which have risen percent since listing in copenhagen in june were trading percent higher at danish crowns by gmt
the company is courting investors interested in green assets which have received a boost from government policies

orsted has named the united states and taiwan as its two key growth markets outside its core northern european region
while it has won the right to develop two projects with a combined capacity of megawatt in taiwan it has so far been unsuccessful in winning tenders in the united states
we see lincoln adding further to our critical mass and our presence in the united states poulsen said
