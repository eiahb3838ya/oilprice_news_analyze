interview-omv plans exploration deal in asia by year-end
aims to agree an exploration deal in asia by tunisian asset up for sale polarled jv sold internal production cost target of less than planned gazprom asset swap solution seen by by kirsti knolle and alexandra vienna sept reuters austrian oil and gas group omv plans to expand its exploration business with an acquisition in southeast asia by the end of the year in line with its strategy to grow in markets outside europe its upstream chief told reuters
omv is betting on further growth in fossil fuels instead of flocking to renewables like many of its rivals forecasting a strong increase in demand for natural gas in particular because burning it emits less carbon dioxide than oil
the group whose presence in russia and countries such as libya and yemen makes it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions there expanded in new zealand and the united arab emirates earlier this year to try to balance risks
johann pleininger responsible for omv s exploration and production business has compiled a list of three to five companies and to assets that are attractive for us in australia indonesia thailand vietnam and malaysia he told reuters in an interview
i hope that we will be able to conclude a contract by the end of the year he said without elaborating on the size of the expected deal
of the billion euros billion set aside for acquisitions until omv has so far spent billion
pleininger declined to comment on a reuters report last month that omv was interested in the malaysian gas fields of peer hess corp
however he said any deal would have to be in cooperation with a strong regional player comparable to omv s partnership with gazprom in russia and with abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in the united arab emirates
such a partner was important to secure support in another country said the austrian who has been working for omv for more than years
hess is an equal partner with energy firm petronas in the malaysian fields
omv s focus on low costs introduced when rainer seele took the group s helm three years ago requires further asset sales pleininger said
the partly group recently agreed to sell its stakes in the norwegian polarled gas pipeline project and in the nyhamma gas processing plant to private capeomega he told reuters
the supervisory board and the norwegian government still had to approve the deal
a asset in tunisia where the austrian company has been operating since and an asset in madagascar were also on pleininger s list of assets to sell
thanks to seele s focus on countries such as russia omv s production costs have more than halved since
to produce one barrel of oil equivalent boe or the amount of energy equivalent to that found in a barrel of crude oil cost it in the first half of this year
there is not too much room for further improvements according to pleininger but the internal goal was less than which would put omv among the best in the industry
regarding a long planned asset swap with gazprom pleininger said he hoped for a solution by the end of the year
our priority is still the asset swap he said when asked about a reuters report that the group might prefer to simply buy some of its partner s siberian assets instead of swapping them after norway criticized the plan to give gazprom access to assets in norway
but he also said the deal s significance had been different when agreed in when omv was struggling with weakening reserves and no financial buffer
its cash position stood at billion euros at the end of june
for us it is important to have a solution pleininger said
