power returning to hokkaido, but quake exposes flaws of japan grid
tokyo reuters after an earthquake knocked out power to million people this week hokkaido electric expects to restore service to most of them by the end of friday but experts say the outage highlights fundamental flaws in japan s power grid
graphic earthquake in hokkaido the blackout that hit japan s northern island of hokkaido after early thursday s quake was the nation s worst in seven years but it would have been less extensive if the utility was not so reliant on one large power station had spread its plants more widely and could transfer power more easily from other areas specialists and energy executives said
in the aftermath of japan s march disaster when an earthquake and tsunami caused nuclear meltdowns and widespread power outages the government mandated a boost in renewable energy supplies opened up a roughly billion retail electricity market to competition and created a grid oversight company to address these issues
but hokkaido and other japanese utilities have been slow to beef up networks and make them more resilient in a country that regularly experiences natural disasters the specialists said
the crisis is primarily the result of on a large coal plant in a centralized generation paradigm said andrew dewit a professor of energy policy at rikkyo university in tokyo
that is odd and dangerous considering the multiplicity of hazards japan confronts and has experienced in recent while not as many people were affected by this week s outage as after the march quake and tsunami it was the first time a regional utility in japan lost its full network according to the country s federation of electric power companies
hokkaido electric power had restored power to a little more than half of the island s million households by friday afternoon after receiving supplies from nearby honshu and rebooting some of its generating units
the utility s coal station which normally supplies about half the island s electricity remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake
it may take a week to restore power fully to hokkaido
hokkaido electric aims to have power restored to about percent of the island s households by the end of friday according to japan industry minister hiroshige seko
the abrupt halt in supplies from which has three generators caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on hokkaido were tripped and shut down
adjusting supply and demand is very difficult
hokkaido s power grid is small and the share of is large so it must have been much a more difficult a situation than after the big earthquake that struck eastern japan said tsutomu oyama professor of electrical engineering at yokohama national university
with its only nuclear plant shut pending approval to restart under new safety guidelines imposed since the fukushima meltdowns of hokkaido electric has been investing in a new station and expanding the capacity of its connection to honshu
cost cuts have slowed the process
it plans to start operations of the unit next month and complete a percent expansion in capacity on the connection by march next year a hokkaido electric spokesman told reuters
those transmission lines currently can supply only about megawatts of power
asked if there were lessons from that could have been applied to help mitigate the current situation the spokesman said the utility had conducted drills for scenarios including the shutdown of all three units at but did not provide details
it is difficult to answer this question because the quake and yesterday s quake are different situations he said
