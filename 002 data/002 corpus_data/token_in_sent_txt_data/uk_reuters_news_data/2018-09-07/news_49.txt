update 2-german industry hit by trade tension, auto bottleneck
berlin reuters german exports and industrial output both fell unexpectedly in july hit by president donald trump s protectionist trade policies and bottlenecks in the auto sector caused by new environmental standards
the federal statistics office said on friday that seasonally adjusted exports fell by percent on the month while imports surged by percent the strongest rise in almost four years and a record volume of billion euros billion pounds
a reuters poll had pointed to a rise of percent in both
separate data from the economy ministry showed industrial output dropped by percent confounding the reuters forecast for a percent rise
the summer dip in our view seems to be driven by uncertainty stemming from global trade tensions and once again the summer vacation period said ing economist carsten brzeski
trump has triggered trade disputes with china europe and many others regions by imposing steep tariffs on a broad range of products in his pledge to protect american jobs against what he calls unfair trade practices
last month salzgitter germany s steelmaker warned of a rise in imports into the european union
it stuck by its financial guidance for the current year despite a strong first half citing uncertainty from trade policies and their possible impact
the economy ministry said german industrial output would likely regain momentum soon after a muted start to the third quarter which was depressed by temporary bottlenecks in passenger car registrations under the new driving cycle
those bottlenecks stem from a new pollution standard the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp for which some german car models have not yet gained regulatory clearance
as bad as the latest german data may be it is a special effect and not a fundamental issue unicredit economist andreas rees wrote in a research note
to be sure wltp creates uncertainties to our growth forecasts in the second half of
however it is not a persistent pattern and a rebound in auto production will follow sooner or later he added
brzeski agreed this week s disappointing industrial data are no need to on thursday industrial orders fell by percent in july after a revised plunge of percent in the previous month
the strongest assets of the german economy currently are the weak euro and strong domestic demand on the back of low interest rates record high employment and wage increases brzeski added
germany s domestic economy is in robust form
