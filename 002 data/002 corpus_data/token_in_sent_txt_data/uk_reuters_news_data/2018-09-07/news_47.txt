preview-vw faces 9.2 bln euros investor suit over dieselgate scandal
frankfurt reuters volkswagen faces a trial next week as investors seek billion euros billion in compensation arguing that the carmaker should have informed shareholders about a diesel pollution scandal before regulators did in september
the lawsuit bundles claims brought mainly by vw s institutional shareholders who have accused the carmaker of failing to inform investors about the scope of a scandal which has cost the company billion euros in penalties and fines
had vw warned investors about the size of the scandal before the environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation on then institutional investors may have avoided losses on their shareholdings plaintiffs said
vw shares lost up to percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from vw diesel cars
volkswagen has admitted systematic emissions cheating but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure
presiding judge christian jaede at the braunschweig higher regional court will make opening remarks at the trial on monday
vw insists that the epa s issuance of the notice of violation was not in keeping with how authorities had handled similar cases involving other carmakers
because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an epa notice of violation and because vw was in talks about reaching a settlement vw s board did not see the need to inform investors the carmaker said in a filing with the braunschweig court
vw had already made substantial provisions in late to cover other vehicle recalls and because previous fines by authorities for similar violations were below million there was no need to issue an disclosure notice under german law the carmaker said in the filing
volkswagen says board members at the time including volkswagen s current chief executive herbert diess and chairman hans dieter poetsch therefore did not violate disclosure rules according to the vw defense document filed with the court
neither the management board nor individual board members caused or were involved with the compliance violation in the united states vw s court filing said
however plaintiffs including lawyer andreas tilp from law firm tilp and fund management firm deka argue that managers below management board level including divisional heads knew about deliberate and systematic emissions cheating
the company as such was therefore aware of severe criminal activity and investors should therefore have been warned earlier the plaintiffs said
