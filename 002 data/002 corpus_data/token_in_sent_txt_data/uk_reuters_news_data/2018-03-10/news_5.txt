u.s. miners seek reversal of uranium mining ban near grand canyon
washington reuters the mining industry asked the supreme court on friday to overturn an rule that prohibits the mining of uranium on public lands adjacent to the grand canyon national park
the national mining association nma and the american exploration and mining association aema filed petitions asking the court to reverse the obama administration s ban on new uranium mining claims on more than million acres of public land adjacent to the canyon
in ken salazar then the secretary of the interior instituted the ban for years on the public lands that the havasupai tribe relies on for water
the ban was upheld by the circuit court of appeals in december
nma spokesman luke popovich said his organization was challenging salazar s constitutional authority to declare the large land withdrawal and he said uranium mining does not harm the land
there is scant evidence that uranium mining outside the park boundaries poses any threat to either the environment or visitor experience popovich said
he said salazar ignored a finding by the interior department s bureau of land management that showed mining would have little impact
conservation groups disagreed and said the ban should remain in place until scientists have time to study the contamination risks
is it worth gambling the future of the grand canyon to allow private companies to line their pockets when the risks to groundwater are unknown said roger clark a program director at the grand canyon trust
currently the global uranium market is so flooded that mining in the united states for the mineral used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons is not profitable
but that could change as the administration of president donald trump is considering protections on the mineral that could increase demand for domestically mined uranium
last month uranium miner energy fuels said it had won federal approvals to expand operations at two mines in southeastern utah after years of challenges from conservation groups worried about emissions of radon gas
other companies have urged interior secretary ryan zinke to reverse the ban
last may vane minerals llc a company in arizona told zinke in a letter the company would appreciate it if he could begin the process to terminate the ban
a copy of the letter was seen by reuters
vane did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter
the interior department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter or the petitions
