update 2-mexican leftist seeks to court bankers, to mixed reviews
acapulco reuters mexico s presidential frontrunner on friday tried to assuage the fears of a sceptical audience of bankers that he would run a radical economic agenda vowing not to nationalize expropriate or drive the country deeper into debt
speaking at a major banking conference in the pacific resort of acapulco andres manuel lopez obrador received mixed reviews for a speech packed with promises not to disrupt economic stability but short on new policy proposals
we will support banks and we won t confiscate assets he said
there won t be expropriations or he said he would not raise taxes or debt and vowed to respect central bank autonomy
lopez obrador s commitments to respecting the financial system and seeking ways to expand access to banking were welcome said rodrigo zorrilla the president of citibanamex
but some bankers said the presidential candidate known locally as amlo did not give enough concrete policy proposals to set their hearts racing
amlo lost the opportunity during this convention to present to the banking sector how he plans to accelerate the economy in mexico in the short medium and long term said diego folino the deputy chief executive at the bank of china mexico
there was an absence of strategic lopez obrador has sought the presidency twice before
this time with a lead over his nearest rival in most opinion polls he has sought to soften his image moderating his previous opposition to the government s attempts to open up mexico s energy sector to foreign investment and surrounding himself with former rivals
lopez obrador s governance would ultimately be dictated by his margin of victory noted zorrilla
if he wins by a small margin his policies are likely to be more moderate he said
former mexico city mayor lopez obrador reminded the audience that he worked closely with the private sector when he ran the capital from while making clear where his priorities lie
we are going to listen to everyone respect everyone for the benefit of everyone first of all the poor he said
his focus would be on governance rather than legislative changes and those there were would not be until the middle of his term he added
he received polite applause for a speech that prioritised increasing welfare spending reviving the rural economy and building new oil refineries
but the crowd responded more enthusiastically to his political rivals including ricardo anaya candidate for a alliance who talked of bringing a century knowledge economy to mexico fuelled by clean energy
ruling party candidate former finance minister jose antonio meade received rowdy applause for a speech that focused on improving the rule of law and economic stability
meade is in third place in most polls after a damaging fight with anaya who has also lost support in recent polls
