hardcore hedge fund bulls say iran sanctions may see oil at $150
london reuters clouds are gathering over the outlook for the oil market as trade tensions and rising crude supply threaten to swamp demand growth but some of the world s most prominent energy investors are convinced the price will return to record highs
the escalating trade war between the united states and china threatens global growth
the physical markets are already showing signs of strain as unwanted crude builds on ships and crushes prices for cargoes of oil
aside from that interest rates around the world are rising and the dollar is strengthening which means emerging market oil buyers are seeing their import bill growing almost daily
both opec and the international energy agency have warned about the risk of trade disputes to global demand growth in their most recent monthly market outlooks
funds have cut their bullish bets on brent and crude futures and options to their lowest in almost a year
despite all this prominent hedge funds such as andurand capital and westbeck capital are betting oil could skyrocket to a barrel from around now
the main driver is expected to be upcoming sanctions on iran s energy sector which kick in november
our view is that by november we will have lost between and million barrels of output a day
it is a very big number
that s based on the view that the will allow a few temporary exception waivers
ultimately we could see losses from iran exceed million barrels a day le mee chief executive officer of westbeck said
graphic major forecasters estimates of oil demand growth in president donald trump in may walked away from a nuclear deal between world powers and tehran that he said was in iran s favour
trump has also blamed opec for the rise in oil prices over the last months and in june exchanged sharp words with iran on the subject
pierre andurand who runs the andurand commodities fund and predicted the rise and subsequent crash in the oil price in responded on twitter by pointing out opec s spare capacity was at its lowest ever
there is going to be a real issue he wrote predicting prices above per barrel within two years
we don t sense a great deal of engagement yet from generalist investors
a few of them are starting to look at it now will smith westbeck chief investment officer said
this is going to catch everybody by surprise
some of the specialists are bullish including pierre andurand ourselves and energy aspects he said
aside from the risk to iranian supply venezuela s crude production which has already collapsed as a result of economic crisis could fall below million barrels per day bpd by the end of the year compared with million bpd in smith said
andurand capital declined to comment
taking a contrarian view can be costly
even andurand took a hit in when he expected the oil price to rally sharply and instead it wallowed around the mark
and he wasn t alone
a number of oil investors such as commodity fund manager andy hall were reportedly so badly burned they shut up shop and bowed out
westbeck s energy opportunity fund is up percent in the year to july showed an investor presentation shared with reuters
andurand s commodities fund is up percent in the first six months of according to data compiled by hsbc
the oil options market shows that for contracts from october to december traders and investors are holding more contracts to buy crude futures or calls at a barrel than any other
however in line with westbeck s view that oil is not one that is widely shared in the investment community that position has barely changed in the last month having dropped by a mere lots to just over lots equivalent to million barrels of oil
graphic brent crude oil investors bulk up on bearish sell options by contrast in the last month the largest change in holdings or open interest has materialised in contracts to sell oil or puts at to a barrel between october and december
this position has grown by nearly lots to lots or million barrels of oil
a month ago the amount of open interest in calls maturing in this time period outnumbered that of puts by nearly three to one
this ratio is now down to two to one
if we are right about oil going from to over the next to months oil options further down the curve look very exciting
the pay back there is just fantastic if we are right westbeck s smith said
