update 2-california water raises offer to buy sjw group
reuters california water service group said on monday it raised an offer to buy sjw group by nearly percent the latest attempt to woo its fellow california utility out of a proposed with connecticut water service inc
the trio form part of a merger battle begun in march when sjw announced a planned combination with connecticut water a move that drew local suitors for both businesses who argued regional consolidation was better than a deal
calwater s new offer for sjw of per share detailed in a market filing represents a premium of percent to the stock s monday close and values the company at about billion
that is above the bid calwater made in april which was rejected by sjw citing regulatory and financing concerns
the new proposal also sweetens terms for sjw by offering it up to two board seats and opening the possibility that sjw management would gain a role in the combined company
calwater also offered to consider alternative transaction structures details of which were not disclosed in the statement as well as an additional per share for every quarter the deal was delayed by regulatory approval beyond a set timetable
sjw shares were up percent at in trading while california water was up percent at
responding to calwater s offer in a separate filing sjw said it would carefully review and consider all aspects of calwater s revised calwater s offer comes a week after sjw said it had agreed to a revised deal with connecticut water in which it would buy the new england utility for billion in cash
connecticut water has separately attracted interest from eversource energy which on monday said in a statement it remained committed to its per share offer made in july and rejected by connecticut water
water utilities particularly in california which has experienced severe drought conditions in recent years often see mergers and acquisitions as a way to increase scale and efficiency
