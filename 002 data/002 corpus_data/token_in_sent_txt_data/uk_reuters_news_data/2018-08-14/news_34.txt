update 2-japan utilities, glencore set annual coal contract at $110/t - sources
contract price up nearly pct from deal a year earlier chugoku shikoku others settle glencore deals tohoku glencore in preliminary talks on deal adds preliminary talks between tohoku and glencore in paragraph by yuka obayashi tokyo aug reuters japanese utilities and global mining giant glencore have settled an australian thermal coal import contract for april at a tonne according to several people with knowledge of the matter
the deals were struck between glencore and japanese utilities such as shikoku electric chugoku electric and kansai electric after bilateral talks a source at a japanese coal buyer said requesting anonymity as he was not allowed to speak in public about commercial deals
glencore did not respond to a request for comment
a chugoku electric spokesman confirmed the utility struck some annual contracts at a tonne with glencore but said other deals were agreed at different levels or prices
shikoku electric said it settled the contract with glencore last month but declined to disclose the price
kansai electric declined to comment
we ve agreed with glencore at per tonne for the contract late last month said another source at a utility directly involved in the talks also declining to be named
a trader with a major commodity merchant also confirmed the deals
the deal marks a breakthrough after japan s tohoku electric and glencore the world s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal failed earlier this year to agree an annual supply deal that has in the past been used as an industry benchmark
the contractual price came in nearly percent higher than an annual supply price a year earlier and percent above a deal for october reflecting a tighter global market for the world s dominant power generation fuel
australian spot thermal coal cargo prices have hit several highs in recent months and at per tonne remain a third above this year s lows in april pushed up by a summer heatwave across the northern hemisphere as well as output cuts in china the world s biggest consumer of coal
the deals between japanese utilities and glencore give coal markets welcome clarity after tohoku and glencore abandoned their talks on an annual contract that traditionally set prices for the region
with annual imports of around million tonnes japan is one of the world s biggest importers of thermal coal
its utilities buy around percent of all australian thermal coal exports
but volumes under the contract have been declining as utilities try to diversify supply sources and trade more in the spot market as part of japan s energy market liberalisation
still miners say term contracts will remain important
end users like to have a mix of spot exposure and they like to have some certainty in their portfolios as i have to say producers also benefit from paul flynn chief executive at whitehaven coal said in an earnings conference call on tuesday
japan is whitehaven s biggest customer
despite the gyrations that you ve seen over the last months and two years in particular with the setting of those prices i think both sides of that equation continue to have a commitment to maintain both pricing in a sign the practice of buyers and miners bilaterally working out a fixed price will continue tohoku and glencore have already begun preliminary talks on an october annual contract multiple sources said
