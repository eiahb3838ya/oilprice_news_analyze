billions hinge on malaysia mahathir's bid to woo project concessions from china
kuala reuters malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad arrives in china on friday seeking to renegotiate and perhaps cancel billions of dollars worth of projects entangled in domestic graft probes
ties have been strained since a stunning election victory returned mahathir to power in may and he suspended unpopular chinese projects authorised by former premier najib razak
during his rule najib courted chinese investment and was a cheerleader for president xi jinping s signature belt and road initiative bri in southeast asia
but mahathir has vowed to discuss the unfair deals on his visit
where we can drop the project we will the told reporters this week
but we may have to postpone some because we have made agreements and to breach the agreements will cost us a the centrepiece of china s infrastructure push in malaysia is the ambitious east coast rail link ecrl project work on which has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations
hit by ballooning costs lack of transparency and the risk it could saddle malaysia with uncomfortably large debt the project has come to symbolise najib s administration
najib charged with money laundering and corruption over state fund development berhad has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to all charges
during his election campaign mahathir was critical of the benefits of the chinese projects which helped him win
his government also halted work on two projects worth more than billion awarded to the china petroleum pipeline bureau that have been linked to graft at
china has been very spooked by mahathir s election said a malaysian official familiar with talks before the visit speaking on condition of anonymity
china is nervous that malaysia wants to cancel the projects but we just want to reassess them the official added
mahathir s trip is set to run until tuesday but he will first visit the eastern city of hangzhou to meet giant alibaba s chief jack ma before flying to beijing the source said
china s eagerness to save the bri from another embarrassing setback leads some analysts to believe it might be open to striking a pragmatic compromise with malaysia
they don t want a failure to taint their name said one malaysian source involved in the contract reviews
they don t want to be involved in a project that is other major projects that have hit hurdles include a rail link from indonesia s capital of jakarta to southeastern bandung and the ports of hambantota in sri lanka and gwadar in pakistan
the chinese are open to ideas and negotiation in many bri countries where projects run into problems said abdul majid ahmad khan president of kuala lumpur s friendship association
but malaysia has to be clear on what it mahathir has courted japan in recent weeks announcing plans for a big loan when he visited tokyo
his shift away from china is also seen as an opportunity for the united states worried at beijing s growing regional clout and building of islands in the south china sea
but for malaysia to distance itself from biggest trading partner china would further hurt its economy sluggish under massive debt
the domestic politics and change in government delivered a shock to the bilateral relationship at the very least it has increased uncertainty and risk said pang zhongying an international relations expert at the ocean university of china adding that the changes had inspired caution
residents of malaysia s placid coastal town of kuantan hoped the ecrl launched a year ago would boost economic activity through the link to the malacca strait a key shipping lane
the east coast people want the ecrl said andy chiew a official of the chamber of commerce
but for now the project has hit the buffers
