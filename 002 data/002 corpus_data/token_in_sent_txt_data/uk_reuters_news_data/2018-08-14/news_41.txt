"hazmat" suit statue near site of japanese nuclear disaster sparks uproar
fukushima japan reuters a statue of a child wearing what appears to be a hazardous material suit unveiled near the site of a japanese nuclear disaster has drawn a barrage of criticism from residents and forced the sculptor to apologise
the high statue sun child was put up in the city of fukushima north of tokyo this month and shows a child in what appears to be a bright yellow hazmat suit holding a helmet in one arm
on the child s chest is a radiation counter reading zero
a major earthquake and tsunami on march led to meltdowns at the fukushima nuclear power plant the world s worst nuclear disaster since the chernobyl accident in
many thousands of people were displaced by leaking radiation and many have still been unable to return home
residents said the statue would only prolong the painful memories of an accident that seemed destined to forever link the name fukushima with nuclear disaster
i don t think fukushima will be able to escape from its tainted reputation so i understand what the sculptor wanted to say said ikue tsunoda
however residents don t wear hazmat suits so i think that was provocative she said
sculptor kenji yanobe said he had worked on the theme of radioactivity since as a way of showing how difficult it was for humans to deal with nuclear power
he said he wanted to show the air was now safe the child in is shown with the helmet off and the counter on its chest points to zero though he said he was sorry the work had disturbed people
i sincerely apologise to those who were upset by my artwork yanobe said in a statement on his website
city officials sought to smooth over the controversy
the statue represents the future free from nuclear disaster said mariko furukawa manager of the city s board of education
some people were killed by the earthquake most of them by the tsunami waves that swept ashore
