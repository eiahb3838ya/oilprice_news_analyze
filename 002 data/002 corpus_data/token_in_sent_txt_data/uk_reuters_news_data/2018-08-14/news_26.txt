economic growth remains strong in the united states but in much of the rest of the world clear signs of slackening momentum have emerged since the start of the year
chartbook strong and synchronised global growth in has given way to a weaker and more varied picture in and which is likely to be less supportive for oil consumption and prices these indicators are all correlated closely with one another and with the rate of expansion in the world economy and they all tell a consistent story of slowing momentum outside the united states
the softening outlook for world trade has filtered through to the oil market with brent calendar spreads and spot prices peaking in april and may respectively
refined fuels including road diesel marine gasoil and jet kerosene are the most heavily geared to the growth of freight given their dominance in the road rail shipping and air cargo sectors
if global trade growth slows consumption of will also decelerate though the outlook for these fuels is complicated by the introduction of new marine fuel regulations at the start of

however the number of risk factors in the global economy is multiplying and includes cocktails of some or all of these risk factors have preceded most recent international economic crises in the last four decades including the latin american debt default mexico s debt default and the tequila crisis thailand s devaluation and the southeast asian financial crisis and russia s financial crisis
compounding the uncertainty the outlook for fiscal monetary and trade policies has become confused with the world s largest economies all trying to pursue inconsistent policies on tariffs and currency valuations
the united states is pursuing an expansionary fiscal policy combined with a restrictive monetary policy causing the real exchange rate to appreciate while simultaneously trying to reduce the external trade deficit with tariffs
fiscal policy has turned strongly even though the expansion is over nine years old unemployment is at lows and inflation has accelerated to the fastest rate for more than six years
china has eased monetary policy and allowed its currency to depreciate since the start of the year to offset the impact of higher tariffs and counter a slowdown in its domestic economy
the currencies of the euro zone and the united kingdom have also weakened supporting flagging domestic growth but now creating problems with rising imported inflation
there is a significant possibility that global growth will experience either a mild or a deeper slowdown over the next months
it is of course possible the current loss of momentum will turn out to be no more than a temporary soft patch with growth accelerating again
on balance however the main leading indicators suggest the pace of economic expansion and the outlook for growth in oil consumption will continue slowing for at least the next six months
