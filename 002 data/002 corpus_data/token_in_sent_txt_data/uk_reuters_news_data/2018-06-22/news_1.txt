adds details about national security adviser john bolton s plan to visit moscow next week by timothy gardner washington june reuters energy secretary rick perry will meet russia s energy minister next week in washington a person familiar with the situation said on friday as the two countries compete to supply global markets with natural gas and crude
perry will meet russia s energy minister alexander novak on tuesday in the context of the world gas conference that is being held in washington the source said
meetings between top energy officials from russia and the united states two of the world s largest oil and gas producers have been rare in recent years
relations between moscow and washington have cooled over russia s annexation of crimea in and as the trump administration blames the russian government for cyber attacks that targeted the power grid over the last two years
the two countries are competing to sell natural gas to europe
russia s gazprom the european union s biggest gas supplier and several western energy companies hope to open nord stream a pipeline to bring russian gas under the baltic sea to germany
the united states meanwhile has begun some sales of liquefied natural gas or lng to poland and lithuania though lng shipments can be more expensive than gas sent via pipeline
the united states says the advantage of its lng is dependability and stable pricing
the administration of president donald trump opposes the nord stream pipeline as did the administration of former president barack obama
washington believes that the pipeline would give russia which has at times frozen deliveries to parts of europe over pricing disputes more power over the region
the meeting comes as national security adviser john bolton plans to visit moscow next week to prepare for a possible meeting between trump and russian president vladimir putin
perry and novak will also likely talk about oil markets
on friday the organization of the petroleum exporting countries agreed in vienna to raise oil output by a modest amount after consumers had called for producers to curb rising fuel prices
russia which is not an opec member began cooperating last year with the group for the first time holding back production to support global oil prices
before the vienna opec meeting novak said moscow would propose a gradual increase in output from countries starting in july
