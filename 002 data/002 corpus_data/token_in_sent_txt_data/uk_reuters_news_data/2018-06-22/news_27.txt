vienna reuters opec agreed on friday to raise oil production by around million barrels per day from july for the group and its allies an opec source said
the output gain is nominal
the real increase will be smaller because several countries that recently underproduced oil will struggle to return to full quotas while other producers will not be allowed to fill the gap opec sources have said
