rpt-analysis-stepping on the gas: china's home-built fracking boom
repeats item issued earlier by chen aizhu chongqing china june reuters on a flattened mountaintop a drive south of chongqing in southwest china a fleet of towering red fracking trucks pumps chemicals and sand into a horizontal well deep under the ground
the equipment was designed and built by china s energy major sinopec the result of a government drive to develop domestic technology to tap the country s vast shale gas resources buried in the region s mountainous terrain
it is the latest key technology that china has learned to master
except for a handful of tools sinopec and a crop of independent companies make everything from trucks and pumps to drilling fluid and proppants treated sand or ceramics used to prop open a fracture to allow gas to escape
we re doing percent or more of the service jobs ourselves
the amount of work handled by foreign firms is minimal said shi yuanhui a senior sinopec service engineer
the push motivated in part by cost cutting amid the oil price slump of has seen international firms like oil services group schlumberger halliburton or baker hughes scale back operations in china
meanwhile chinese firms are starting to export equipment including pressure pumps even to the home of the shale boom in the united states
over the past years the cost of building a well has nearly halved to an average of under million yuan per well million and drilling speed has improved by to days according to interviews with state oil officials equipment makers and service providers
china has over the years developed its unique practice that employs compact drilling equipment to suit the terrains and improved greatly on drilling efficiency said lynn lin of energy consultancy wood mackenzie
schlumberger and baker hughes declined to comment on their china shale business
halliburton did not respond to a request for comment
state energy giants sinopec and petrochina pumped billion cubic metres bcm of shale gas in up from scratch a decade ago and equivalent to about percent of the country s total natural gas production
still the hilltop scene illustrates some of the problems facing the world s biggest energy consumer in exploiting its unconventional gas
unlike the flatter regions containing shale chinese firms operate in tricky environments including mountainous arid remote and also highly populated regions leading to higher costs
china s shale is also buried deeper and is more fractured making it difficult and expensive to extract
china is expected to nearly double output to bcm by according to wood mackenzie
while below beijing s target of bcm set out four years ago and just a fraction of bcm produced in the united states last year domestic gas is a major focus as the country looks to ease its reliance on dirtier coal
china s leading manufacturer of fracking equipment is jianghan machinery plant which accounts for more than half of the country s production of fracking trucks and pumps
the firm under the supervision of what was then the ministry of petroleum bought several dozen fracking trucks in on condition the manufacturer allowed access to its technology said a jianghan marketing executive who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media
the was initially applied to conventional wells before jianghan now part of sinopec china s top shale gas firm built the country s first shale fracker in
baoji machinery a unit of cnpc and independent equipment builders honghua group and jereh group have also expanded into shale and are competing in new more efficient frackers
jereh and honghua are also leading an export push said company officials competing with the likes of halliburton
jereh exports trucks pressure pumps and pipes with total overseas sales making up half of its billion yuan million in revenue in a company spokeswoman said declining to give a breakdown by country
lucrative export contracts will be needed as china s shale industry still struggles to make cash at home
sinopec has acknowledged it would be difficult to break even without government subsidies currently at roughly percent of prices
helping increase efficiency chinese firms can now drill multiple wells at a single pad known as well factory drilling
they can also carry out extended horizontal fracturing up to metres sinopec engineers said
the expertise will be needed if china is to make the most of its shale gas estimated by the energy information administration as the world s largest
western majors like exxon mobil royal dutch shell total conocophillips and chevron largely abandoned china s shale scene after disappointing initial results
geologists at sinopec said they have struggled to replicate a find like fuling the largest commercial field a gas field similar but smaller to the hugely successful marcellus formation
there are also complaints that sinopec s and petrochina s domination is a barrier to future development as these state behemoths hinder competition
only in late as shale drilling quickened on the back of rising oil prices did the two majors start awarding service contracts to independent firms like spt energy anton oilfield and honghua group
