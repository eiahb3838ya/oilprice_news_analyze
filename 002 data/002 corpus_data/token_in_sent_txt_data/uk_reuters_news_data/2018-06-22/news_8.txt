update 7-opec agrees modest hike in oil supply after saudi and iran compromise
vienna reuters opec agreed on friday on a modest increase in oil production from next month after its leader saudi arabia persuaded iran to cooperate following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs
but the agreement failed to announce a clear target for the output increase leaving traders guessing how much more opec will actually pump
oil prices rose by to a barrel
president donald trump was among those wondering how much more oil opec will deliver
hope opec will increase output substantially
need to keep prices down trump wrote on twitter after opec announced its decision
the united states china and india had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in a statement that it would raise supply by returning to percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts but gave no concrete figures
saudi arabia said the move would translate into a nominal output rise of around million barrels per day bpd or percent of global supply
iraq said the real increase would be around bpd because several countries that had suffered production declines would struggle to reach full quotas
by avoiding setting individual country targets the deal appears to give saudi arabia the leeway to produce more than its official opec target and fill the gap left by those like venezuela who can not pump enough to meet their official allocation
iran opec s producer had demanded opec reject calls from trump for an increase in oil supply arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on iran and fellow member venezuela
trump slapped fresh sanctions on tehran in may and market watchers expect iran s output to drop by a third by the end of
that means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise opec output unlike top oil exporter saudi arabia
however saudi energy minister khalid convinced his iranian peer bijan zanganeh to support the increase just hours before friday s opec meeting
opec and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by million bpd
the measure had helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel from as low as in
but unexpected outages in venezuela libya and angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around million bpd in recent months
the output boost agreed on friday had been largely priced into the market and was seen as modest
it will be enough for now but not enough for the fourth quarter to address a decline in iranian and venezuelan exports said gary ross head of global oil analytics at s p global
there isn t a lot of spare capacity in the world
if we lose a million bpd of output from venezuela and iran in the fourth quarter where will all these barrels come from
we are in for higher prices for longer he said
falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to million bpd in the second half of and that opec s responsibility was to address consumers worries
we want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in falih said referring to a time when oil rallied close to per barrel
opec s deal to release more supply centres on returning to percent compliance with existing agreed cuts
current compliance is around percent above target because of production outages in venezuela libya and angola
as a group we can meet the percent compliance
as individual countries it is challenging said united arab emirates energy minister suhail bin mohammed
zanganeh has said that if opec returned to regular compliance the group would raise output by around bpd
iran has objected to having members with additional capacity such as saudi arabia fill venezuelan output gaps
both saudi and iran can show that they won an opec delegate said
zanganeh can go back to his country and say i won because we are keeping the original agreement unchanged
falih can go back and say we will be able to raise production to meet market needs opec and producers will meet on saturday to iron out details of the pact and then again in september to review the deal
the next formal opec meeting was set for
