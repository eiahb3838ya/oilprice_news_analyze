brexit poses risk to international power cables - norway's grid
oslo reuters britain s exit from the european union could leave companies planning to build more power interconnections at the mercy of possible new trading arrangements and potential tariffs norway s grid operator statnett said
statnett and britain s national grid agreed before the brexit vote to construct the first interconnector between the two countries by
a separate consortium of norwegian energy companies and sweden s vattenfall is seeking to build a second cable by for about billion euros billion pounds
brexit could mean that new trading arrangements may be required to sell power via the interconnectors as britain might not be allowed to participate in the european spot and power trading market according to the norwegian grid
in that case the uk will be treated in the same way as switzerland statnett told norway s nve power regulator in a letter reviewed by reuters
brexit could also mean that britain will no longer be bound by eu competition rules which currently allow interconnectors to seek british subsidy payments for providing supply capacity
there is therefore a risk that british authorities exclude international connections from participation in the capacity market or significantly reduce the value of participation statnett said
we would also like to point out that there is a risk that british authorities may introduce a border tariff it added
northconnect has been at the centre of a political row in norway with opposition parties and some trade unions opposing the second cable over fears of rising power prices
statnett also said that plans to build northconnect by were unrealistic given the time needed to manufacture and install the cable
odd oeygarden chairman of the northconnect owners group said brexit made the situation unclear to some extent but pointed out that statnett was already building a cable and that there are more links from the european mainland in place
i think in the long run the uk and the eu will find the solutions that would allow the interconnectors to operate he said
