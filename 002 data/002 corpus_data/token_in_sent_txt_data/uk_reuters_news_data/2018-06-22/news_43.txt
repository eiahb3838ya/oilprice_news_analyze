opec struggles for deal to ease supply cuts as iran resists
iran says doesn t think agreement can be reached saudi energy minister market needs mln bpd extra oil opec has history of agreeing deals without iran trump called on opec to help lower oil prices by rania el gamal alex lawler and shadia nasralla vienna june reuters opec will seek agreement on friday to raise oil production despite opposition from iran which has threatened to block the move as it faces sanctions
opec s de facto leader saudi arabia and russia have said a production increase of about million barrels per day bpd or around percent of global supply had become a proposal for the group and its allies
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will be gathering in vienna amid calls from top consumers the united states china and india to cool down the price of crude and prevent an oil shortage that would hurt the global economy
it will be a hard meeting today
i wouldn t say all will accept the million bpd proposed an opec delegate said adding the group could agree on a lower figure
iran opec s producer has so far been the main barrier to a deal as it called on opec to reject pressure from president donald trump to pump more oil
trump imposed fresh sanctions on tehran in may and market watchers expect iran s output to drop by a third by the end of
that means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise opec output unlike saudi arabia
i don t think we can reach agreement iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said on thursday
saudi energy minister khalid said the overwhelming majority of producers had recommended raising output by million bpd gradually and on a basis
opec and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by million bpd
the measure has helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel from as low as in
but unexpected outages in venezuela libya and angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around million bpd in recent months
brent oil prices were up percent on friday
falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to million bpd in the second half of and that opec s responsibility was to address consumers worries
we want to prevent the shortage and the squeeze that we saw in falih said referring to a time when oil rallied close to per barrel
earlier this week zanganeh left the door open for a deal saying opec members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas
that would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as saudi arabia that have voluntarily cut more deeply than planned
zanganeh has said that if opec returned to regular compliance the group would raise output by around bpd
falih also said the real increase would be smaller than the nominal gain of million bpd meaning a compromise with iran remained possible
opec sources also said iran had demanded that sanctions be mentioned in the group s communique as tehran has blamed measures for the recent rise in oil prices
the united states which rivals russia and saudi arabia for the position of world oil producer is not participating in the current supply pact
