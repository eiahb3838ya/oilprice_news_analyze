renewable energy seeks demand, investment to survive trump squeeze
new york reuters the wind and solar industries hope demand for power from cities states and corporations can offset headwinds from president donald trump s tax policy and tariffs developers said this week
the trump tax overhaul trimmed production and investment tax credits and the administration also slapped a percent tariff on imported solar panels
the moves aimed at boosting manufacturing and economic growth also dimmed prospects for renewables
but trump s withdrawal of federal support for climate goals indirectly helped the industry by inspiring a backlash among cities states and corporations which have grown more ambitious about installing cleaner forms of energy
also investors with years of deals under their belts are less wary about financing solar and wind than they were years ago and socially responsible funds are actively seeking projects to invest in according to executives and investors at the renewable energy finance street in new york
gregory wetstone president and chief executive officer of the american council on renewable energy noted that two big solar projects worth about billion total have been canceled or stalled since the tariffs were announced in january
the solar energy industries association has said the tariffs would result in the loss of jobs
but some manufacturers and developers have announced new projects in the face of the tariffs
wetstone noted that solar led all generation sources with gigawatts of new capacity in the first quarter of
there is a sea change in demand for renewable energy susan nickey managing director at hannon armstrong sustainable infrastructure capital inc which invests about billion a year in the sector said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference on tuesday
more and more corporations and consumers are saying we want percent renewable energy she said adding city and state governments are adopting policies to reflect that growing demand
she cited a survey of financial institutions that showed of respondents planned to boost renewable investments this year
some percent said they would sharply increase planned investments from now to unless government policies slow demand for renewable energy
craig cornelius president of nrg energy inc s nrg renewables told a panel at the conference that while trump s tax bill was initially worrying it has been ultimately easier to work through the repercussions than we as the bill moved through congress republican lawmakers from states with renewable projects joined democrats to make changes
the final version kept percent of the investment tax credit and production tax credit values and dropped a proposed corporate alternative minimum tax that would have made the tax credits less valuable
members on both sides of the aisle stepped out to support us laura beane president and chief executive officer of avangrid renewables said on wednesday
avangrid is developing the vineyard wind project off the coast of massachusetts
quick action helped many developers dodge harm from tariffs on solar cells noted stacey kusters president of berkshire hathaway energy co s bhe solar
a lot of the projects that were planned went in and bought two years worth of panels before the tariffs she said
meanwhile the industry is bracing for the scheduled reduction and ultimate expiry of lucrative subsidies on solar and wind power over the coming years including a percent tax credit on solar installations
this will make it trickier to finance some renewable projects said robert sternthal managing director at rubicon capital advisors who is putting together a team of bankers to advise on renewable deals in north america
without the incentives pricing may have to go up on the electricity side for some projects he said on tuesday
yet he also expects growing demand from tech corporations that have pledged to be and will not rely on wind or solar energy for profits
google facebook and apple don t have to make to percent returns on these assets he said
improvements in technology could help make wind and solar more competitive in terms of cost and sustainability after tax credits expire said rafael gonzalez president and chief executive officer of enel green power north america whose projects include wind solar geothermal and hydropower
beane said avangrid renewables is betting on prospects for a lot of demand for offshore wind power in the the company starts construction on the vineyard wind project next year and it is slated to come online in
by then she said the project may be competitive on its own thanks to improved technology and expertise you ll be very surprised at the reporting by dave gregorio in new york editing by richard valdmanis and matthew lewis
