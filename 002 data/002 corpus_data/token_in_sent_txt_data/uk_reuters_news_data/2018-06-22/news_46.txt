mongolia launches construction of first oil refinery with indian aid
ulaanbaatar june reuters mongolia launched construction of its first oil refinery on friday a project that is funded by india and designed to end the country s dependence on russian fuel
friday s ceremony was attended by mongolian prime minister khurelsukh ukhnaa and indian minister of home affairs rajnath singh
the refinery in southern dornogovi province will be capable of processing million tonnes of crude oil per year said mongol refinery the company building the project in a press release
that is about barrels per day bpd
the refinery will be small by international standards with most chinese facilities each processing hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude per day and india s reliance industries running one refinery at a record million bpd
still mongolia s new refinery planned for completion in late will meet all of the nation s demand for gasoline diesel aviation fuel and liquefied petroleum gas lpg
by establishing this strategically important oil refinery the national economy will become independent from energy imports and fuel and commodity prices will be stabilised said mongol refinery in its statement
the project is expected to boost mongolia s gross domestic product by percent it said
mongolia imported almost million tonnes of oil products last year virtually all from russia
they amounted to percent of all mongolia s imports according to official data
mongolia a large landlocked country wedged between giants china and russia has a population of just million
almost half its people live as nomadic stock herders and the country s oil demand is growing only very slowly
from a national security perspective we do need to diversify our sources of oil products from the current single source russia said munkhdul badral bontoi chief executive of market intelligence group cover mongolia
the cost of the refinery is estimated at billion and it will include a pipeline and its own power plant
the refinery will process mongolia s own crude oil which is now sold to china
mongolia produced million barrels of oil last year about bpd amounting to percent of its total export earnings
the country s petroleum industry regulator is expecting its crude oil output to rise over the years prior to the refinery s
mongolia s big southern neighbour china produces around million bpd of crude and imports more than million bpd according to official government data
a mongolian oil refinery has been discussed since but while several projects were approved none have been completed
the refinery s financing is part of a billion credit line agreement between mongolia and the bank of india made during a visit by indian prime minister narendra modi
the indian guarantee is what put the odds in favour of the oil refinery being finally built but the biggest worry here is whether the oil refinery can pay for itself said munkhdul
economically i m sceptical of the viability of a domestic oil refinery as fuel prices are heavily regulated he said
