update 1-australia no longer expects gas shortfall before 2030
gap closed by weaker demand forecast stronger supply outlook wind solar growth shrinks need for power but lng importers undeterred adds comment from prospective lng importers by sonali paul melbourne june reuters australia no longer faces a looming gas shortage thanks to government pressure on exporters to divert the commodity into local markets and a reduced demand forecast for power according to estimates from the nation s energy market operator
no supply gaps are forecast before under expected market conditions the australian energy market operator aemo said on friday in its annual outlook for gas
that is starkly different from a year ago when dire warnings from the body about potential shortfalls in eastern australia from onward prompted the government to threaten to curb liquefied natural gas lng exports
the nation s three east coast lng plants operated by royal dutch shell conocophillips and santos averted those curbs by promising to plug the expected deficit
their moves combined with greater availability of lng on the global market the of a new pipeline from the northern territory to queensland and growth in wind and solar power diminishing the need for power have eliminated the feared shortage aemo said
alongside international market changes newly committed electricity generation resources have resulted in a favourable increase of gas availability for the east coast market aemo executive general manager david swift said in a statement
more than megawatts of wind and solar power are due to start up in the next two years which should ease demand for power except when renewable generation is low he said
aemo cut its gas consumption forecast for by petajoules from its last estimate made in september while increasing its gas production outlook from fields in the southern states by pj
in september it had predicted a supply gap of between pj and pj for or up to percent of market demand
an extra pj of gas has also been freed up for the local market as a global lng glut has given overseas buyers more supply choice aemo said
while producers told the market operator output would increase from southern gas fields aemo s forecasts still show that further exploration and development will be needed to meet demand from as early as swift said
production forecasts from gas producers show an increase in output of pj between and aemo said while flagging those new supplies will be more costly to produce than existing production
the sharply changed view has not deterred groups considering importing lng to southeastern australia within the next two years as they see the assumptions on future gas production as bullish and view lng import terminals as much cheaper to install than developing new gas fields
for the sake of a new entrant and a compelling certain product i just think imports win hands down said james baulderstone chief executive of australian industrial energy one of at least three groups considering importing lng
