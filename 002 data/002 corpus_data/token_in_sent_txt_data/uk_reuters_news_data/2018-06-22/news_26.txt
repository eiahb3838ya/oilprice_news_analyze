update 2-kenya airways to hedge aviation fuel to counter volatility
adds details by duncan miriri nairobi june reuters kenya airways will resume aviation fuel hedging in the second half of this year after price volatility drove up its costs the airline s ceo said on friday
the carrier which is percent owned by air france klm suspended fuel hedging in after contract losses sent it deeper into the red following a prolonged business slump and a jump in finance costs
chief executive officer sebastian mikosz said the recent increase in the price of brent crude had driven up fuel costs a quarter of its total costs forcing a rethink on hedging
the volatility of the fuel price has been really tremendous
addressing this is our utmost concern he told a news conference after the company s annual meeting
kenya airways suspended hedging at a time when it was struggling to cope with a sharp drop in air travel to kenya due to militant attacks and concerns about an ebola outbreak in west africa
the airline has since restructured billion of debt and mikosz said now was the time for a very lean mean conservative policy of buying insurance against fuel price volatility
i m absolutely confident that in the third or fourth quarter of this year kenya airways will start opening hedge policies again
you can expect some hedging disclosures next year he said
kenya airways has also opened talks with the kenya airports authority kaa the state organisation that runs all kenyan airports on a partnership that would allow it to run nairobi s main airport
such a deal which could come into effect before the end of this year would provide the airline with fresh revenue streams such as landing fees from other carriers said chairman michael joseph citing the example of rivals
for us to compete with them gulf carriers and to offer the same benefits that they offer we need to almost copy them he told the news conference
the proposal would enable kenya airways to increase its fleet from to and start flying to new international destinations by an official government document seen by reuters showed
