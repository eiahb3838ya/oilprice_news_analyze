rpt-china to reduce u.s. oil imports post-sept amid trade spat -sources
repeats with no changes to text to maintain oil imports until september exec spat heightens risk of oil imports demand for crude loading from august to fall by florence tan and chen aizhu june reuters chinese oil buyers will keep taking crude from the united states through september but plan to reduce future purchases to avoid a likely import tariff amid a trade spat between the world s two largest economies multiple industry sources said
beijing has put energy products including crude oil and refined products on lists of goods that it will hit with import taxes in retaliation for similar moves by washington
beijing did not specify when it will impose a percent tax on oil and that gives buyers time to adjust purchases while waiting for the outcome of trade talks the sources said
unipec trading arm of sinopec asia s largest refiner and biggest buyer of oil has been offering crude such as west texas intermediate wti midland to other asian buyers for july said three sources with knowledge of the offers
they unipec only offer crude for september arrival that means cargoes one of the sources said although adding that the offer was quite expensive
unipec officials said this was normal trading activity as the trading unit often excess crude from its refining system depending on economics and the state of its supplies
a top trading executive with sinopec told reuters the state refiner will maintain its usual import volumes for but can t commit to bookings further out
future purchases from onwards will depend on developments said the executive who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject
a sinopec spokesman declined to comment
unipec said early this year that the company expects to trade up to barrels per day bpd of crude oil by the end of the year about triple the trading volume last year
that will be worth roughly billion over the whole year based on per barrel of oil
if the tariff is a problem the is going to struggle to find a market as big as china joe willis senior research analyst at wood mackenzie said at a thomson reuters industry seminar on thursday
i don t see a major impact on our purchasing programme
cargoes for july loadings are unlikely be affected said a planning executive with a sinopec plant that buys million to million barrels of oil every month
his plant this week nominated internally with unipec for an august loading plan that is expected to be finalised a month later said the planning executive
china shipped in million tonnes or about bpd of crude in the first quarter of this year nearly eight times the amount a year earlier and percent of china s top crude oil imports according to chinese customs
the grades include wti mars and southern green canyon
nevertheless uncertainty over the timing of the tariff and the outcome of trade talks has kept some buyers from booking further ahead
chinese refineries typically order oil three months in advance due to shipping distances
we don t even know whether it will eventually be carried out
what if the and china compromise and things change overnight said a third source who deals oil with an independent refiner adding that his company will stop booking crude for september deliveries into china
sinopec refinery sources said finding alternative supplies won t be an issue as oil is relatively new to the chinese market and can be replaced by north sea grades like forties middle eastern supplies or russia s urals crude
