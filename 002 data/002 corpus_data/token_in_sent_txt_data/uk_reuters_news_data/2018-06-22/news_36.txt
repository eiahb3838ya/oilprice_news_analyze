eu leaders set to prolong russia sanctions again
brussels reuters european union leaders will next week extend until the end of january economic sanctions against russia over its intervention in ukraine diplomats and officials said
the curbs on russia s energy defence and financial sectors have been prolonged every six months since first being slapped after moscow annexed the peninsula of crimea from kiev and backed rebels fighting government troops in east ukraine
eu leaders meeting in brussels on june will agree another extension of the curbs on doing business with russia currently in place until the end of july
moscow vows to never return crimea and the east ukraine conflict has killed more than people and turned into a frozen confrontation with sporadic fighting still taking place regularly
the decision follows talks between the world s seven most industrialised countries who met in canada earlier in june
the format used to be held as but russia was kicked out in over crimea
since then the leaders of the world s leading powers have used their annual meetings to coordinate their stance
this year they called on moscow to stop undermining democracies and said in their statement we recall that the continuation of sanctions is clearly linked to russia s failure to demonstrate complete implementation of its commitments in the peace minsk agreements and respect for ukraine s italian prime minister giuseppe conte has said he wanted to russia but also signed up for another sanctions extension at the meeting in canada the first major international gathering for the head of the new populist government
italy thinks it is important to have a dialogue with russia but this does not mean that the system of sanctions can be overcome overnight conte has said
the eu is also at loggerheads with russia over its role in the war in syria and elsewhere in the middle east as well as the kremlin s track record on human rights
it also blames moscow for a march attack in the british town of salisbury on a former russian spy using a military grade nerve agent
moscow denies guilt
