column-resurgent coal exporters should be wary of blinkered optimism: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell brisbane june reuters coal miners supplying asia s rapidly growing economies have plenty to be optimistic about as prices and demand appear robust but they should be wary of getting caught up in the positive feedback loop that nearly destroyed them before
this week s inaugural energy mines and money conference in brisbane the heartland of the industry in top coal exporter australia was a sea of optimism about the outlook for the industry
prices have been on an upward trend since bottoming in after five years of losses and miners are once again making good profits amid strong demand from top importers china and india new consumers such as pakistan and the reliable veteran buyers like japan and south korea
but at the back of the minds of many australian miners is the fear that they have seen this movie before and they don t want the same ending
in the industry was over forecasts that pointed to massive import demand growth in asia led by china and india
mining and coal conferences at the time were well attended and featured masses of presentations from both junior and established companies all with the common theme of how much they were going to invest in new mines and how much new production was coming to meet the massive asian demand
problem was it was pretty much all wrong
a industry consultant and forecaster boldly claimed in early that china would be importing billion tonnes of coal by and india would be up to million tonnes
while this was probably the most bullish forecast it wasn t terribly out of line with several other predictions
but these forecasts now look hopelessly optimistic given china s coal imports were million tonnes in
while imports have risen for two years they are still well below the record million tonnes from
while china s coal imports may rise slightly this year it s unlikely they will reach million tonnes and that billion tonne forecast looks well out of reach
however there is still no shortage of optimism among australia s coal miners with industry group the minerals council of australia releasing a report this week that harks back to the wildly bullish forecasts of the previous boom period
asian seaborne coal imports will rise by million tonnes from current levels by a more than increase from s million tonnes according to the report which was compiled by consultants commodity insights
the methodology of the report assumes that all planned and proposed plants across asia will be built and then also relies on forecasts
however the trend is clear planned and proposed generation keeps getting cut back as the developed world largely turns away from the fuel and as top importer china increasingly tightens environmental controls
in the two years to january there was a drop in announced and permitted generation according to a report compiled by environmental groups coalswarm the sierra club and greenpeace
while the report also shows operating generation increased by percent over the period it does seem clear that the pipeline of projects is slipping and may in time not be enough to replace the closure of older power plants
the optimistic forecasts also fail to account for political pressure to move away from coal not only in china but increasingly in india
it s likely that those countries planning on building coal plants powered by imports will also come under mounting pressure from environmental activists who have become increasingly sophisticated in targeting how coal plants are financed and insured
in fact if there was another common theme to this week s conference in brisbane it s that the coal sector still doesn t fully grasp that array of forces now being deployed against it
the mantra of coal as cheap and reliable and the only way to electrify the masses of people still without power was still repeated and clearly believed
but scratch a little further and miners will tell you of the incredible difficulties in developing projects with increased government scrutiny and regulation the rising threat of public opposition and the dearth of financing notwithstanding a seemingly large pool of investment funds
the inability of india s adani to actually start building its carmichael mine in queensland the world s largest planned mine aimed at supplying the seaborne market plays on the industry s mind as does the virulent public opposition to the mine s development
the exit of major companies such as rio tinto from coal has also made developing new mines difficult as those firms could fund a project off their own balance sheets and didn t have to seek investors partners or project financing
the lack of new supply also makes optimistic demand forecasts tricky
if asia genuinely was to demand million more tonnes of coal by it would take an unrealistically massive effort to develop mines to produce this
it simply can t be done meaning that prices would have to surge to either incentivise new production or cut back on demand as power generators switch to other fuels such as natural gas or increase the use of renewables
the australian government s commodity forecasts are for modest growth in the region of percent for coal output and exports while indonesia the world s largest exporter of thermal coal has a policy of lowering exports over time in order to keep the resources for domestic consumption
with the world s two biggest coal exporters not likely to boost their supplies to the seaborne market the question is who can
and the answer is nobody really
south africa also has domestic needs and export infrastructure constraints russia has plenty of coal but infrastructure issues and the united states and canada could probably add several million more tonnes a year but this would be nowhere near enough
overall coal miners find themselves in the odd position of enjoying strong profits and growth in demand for their products but equally largely unable to meet that demand because developing new mines is becoming too hard
