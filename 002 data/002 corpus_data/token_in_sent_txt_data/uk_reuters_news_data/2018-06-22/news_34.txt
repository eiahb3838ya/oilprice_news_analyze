update 2-venezuela says "a challenge" to recover lost crude output by end 2018
vienna reuters venezuela has the ability to boost crude output by million barrels per day bpd by end of the year in its bid to recover lost production but the oil minister also said on friday this goal would be a challenge for state oil firm pdvsa
president nicolas maduro said last month pdvsa would aim to boost oil production by million bpd this year and would seek help from russia china and opec if needed
output has plummeted under sanctions and due to an economic crisis
we hope that by we will have recovered the lost production we have the capacity to do so we ve said so oil minister manuel quevedo told reporters at a meeting of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries in vienna
this is a goal for that is very challenging for pdvsa but it s the goal we ve set ourselves quevedo said
the minister who is also head of pdvsa earlier said venezuela was pumping about million bpd of oil
the country had been producing about million bpd as recently as thomson reuters data shows
pdvsa s oil exports fell percent in the first half of june compared with may according to internal trade reports from the company as deepening output declines and seizures of some caribbean assets disrupted crude and fuel shipments
oil firm conocophilips won court orders in may allowing it to seize pdvsa assets as part of a billion arbitration award in its favor
it seized a several crude cargoes and fuel terminals further disrupting venezuelan exports
the discussions we have with conoco we want to further those in the coming weeks quevedo said
we aren t commenting on any dialogue with pdvsa conocophillips spokesman daren beaudo
to meet its commitments to consumers pdvsa has drawn up a plan to process up to bpd of foreign crude in june to fulfil export contracts and reduce purchases of fuels for domestic use
we have a recovery plan with the refineries to use the capacity that we have we have a lot of spare capacity that we will use as crude output increases quevedo said
