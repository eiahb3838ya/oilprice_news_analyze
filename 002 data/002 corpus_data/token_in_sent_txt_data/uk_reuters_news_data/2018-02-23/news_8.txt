corrected-rpt-focus-how general electric gambled on fossil fuel power, and lost
corrects paragraph to read advance class instead of by alwyn scott new york feb reuters last march executives at general electric co s business gave wall street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year
despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants they said ge power s revenue and profit would rise
showing data from financial firm lazard and other sources their presentation said natural gas coal and even some nuclear power plants were the producers of electricity on the planet cheaper than wind or solar
gas is the most economical energy source today one slide read
in the days following the conference ge s shares rose percent
but ge s forecast turned out to be a mirage
rather than rising ge power s profit fell percent last year forcing ge to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the great depression
its shares have plunged more than percent since the march forecast
former ceo jeff immelt was replaced in august
john flannery ge s new chief executive blamed the forecast along with poor management and other factors for the power business meltdown
in january he warned the pain would continue this year and potentially be worse than what ge has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less than gas and other conventional energy sources and have for years according to a widely respected energy cost report lazard has published since
for graphic showing energy costs and other details click ge said lazard was one data source for its march forecast which also weighed the high efficiency of ge s latest gas power plants and other factors
ge said cost is not the only predictor of the power source utilities will choose
they may also value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar
we have a rigorous financial planning process ge said in response to questions from reuters
but according to more than a dozen former executives rivals and energy experts interviewed by reuters ge s reading of the market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand for conventional power plants as sales of wind and solar surged
there are just fewer gas turbines being bought one former ge executive said
the market is not flat it s power is not ge s only problem
its financing arm ge capital took a massive unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly billion loss in the fourth quarter and prompted regulators to broaden an ongoing probe of its accounting practices
profit also fell sharply at ge s separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year and flannery has suggested he may break up the company
but power is one of ge s oldest and largest businesses and supplied percent of the conglomerate s profit as recently as
now ge is cutting jobs percent of the unit s workforce after announcing job cuts in early
on wednesday ge chief financial officer jamie miller warned of a little bit more noise at ge power calling a reset and stabilization year for the division
she declined to predict when ge power would regain profit margins it had in and said turning it around will take a good to ge doubled down on fossil fuel in with the billion purchase of french group alstom s power business
the deal expanded ge s exposure to gas coal and nuclear power just as solar costs fell below those of plants according to lazard
the alstom deal added employees to ge s payroll and dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time when ge was trying to cut costs
orders for ge s newest large turbines have fallen percent in the two years since the deal closed and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is unlikely to hit levels again for at least a decade
the cost gap between renewable and conventional power is still widening and some utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants using them only to supplement wind and solar
other companies also were hit by the decline in sales
but competitors siemens ag and mitsubishi hitachi power systems were cautious
paul browning chief executive of mhps north america said his company watched wind and solar power costs fall percent a year for more than a decade
we did see a lot of this coming and didn t make acquisitions or build up a lot of facilities people or inventory browning said in an interview
while alstom gave ge more than billion more in annual revenue alstom s profit margins were less than of ge s
immelt saw that as an opportunity
if we thought this was a percent margin business that we couldn t dramatically improve we are not going to do it immelt said of the alstom purchase in may
we are basically in similar businesses in the same market and we run our business at a percent but regulators required ge to sell the service arm of alstom a company called power systems manufacturing that had long been a competitor to ge mitsubishi and siemens
ge which had counted on that business serving a large base of plants around the world to make alstom more profitable bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to competitors according to three people familiar with the bidding
that has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into service contracts that will not be profitable
rather than improving alstom s margins ge power s margin plunged to percent last year from percent before the acquisition
in response to questions from reuters ge said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell by half last year a major hit to profits
but it defended the alstom purchase which instantly gave it percent more plants to service something that would take half a century to build up from scratch
since it is a business ge said and we have opportunity to improve the performance in the ge s power plants generate of the world s electricity giving it a large installed base for services revenue
but industry experts point out that ge s gas power plants are mainly older units rather than the new larger turbines
older plants often can not compete with wind and solar especially when governments provide subsidies said stuart slade director of consulting at market research firm forecast international
there are a lot of gas plants being mothballed slade said
alstom inflicted other blows new alstom orders fell off in the months before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases
that gave competitors scope to gain market share according to people familiar with the sales competitions
ge has sold the largest number power plants
but it is in third place behind mitsubishi and siemens in competition for the newest largest and most advance class turbines according to mccoy power reports an industry research company
orders for all of ge power s plants and services have fallen percent since a decline that accelerated at the end of last year
ge also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of an million charge it took in the fourth quarter
ge did not rule out further write offs in response to questions from reuters
miller and ge power chief executive russell stokes have said the problems are fixable and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that wind and solar are a part of the world s energy supply
still ge downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product line
despite rapid growth of wind and solar it says of power generation will come from gas coal and nuclear plants over the next decade
the transformation will not happen overnight ge said in the strategy paper
