analysis-u.s. shale investors still waiting on payoff from oil boom
houston reuters oil production has topped million barrels per day approaching a record set in but many investors in the companies driving the shale oil revolution are still waiting for their payday
shale producers have raised and spent billions of dollars to produce more oil and gas ending decades of declining output and redrawing the global energy trade map
but most shale producers have failed for years to turn a profit with the increased output frustrating their financial backers
wall street s patience ran out late last year as investors called for producers to shift more cash to dividends and share buybacks
give me some cash that s what investors have said said anoop poddar a partner at private equity firm energy ventures
and yet such calls for payouts remain a debate in the industry as oil prices have recently creeped up to highs
investors demanding immediate returns could risk forcing firms to curb expansion that could have a higher payoff if oil prices continue to rise

a reuters analysis of corporate dividend disclosures shows a split in how shale firms are reacting to increased pressure from investors and the impact on their market value
this year five of the largest independent shale firms have started paying or raised quarterly dividends the documents show
but six of the firms have never offered a dividend or have not restored cuts implemented since the oil price collapse
anadarko petroleum corp earlier this month added million to an existing buyback program and raised its dividend by percent sending its shares up percent the next trading day
buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding boosting the value of stock that remains
shares in pioneer natural resources co also rose percent immediately after raising its dividend and posting fourth quarter results earlier this month

some companies have maintained conservative assumptions for the average oil price for budgeting for prices between and a barrel
a higher price will mean they can cover new drilling investments and still pay dividends
investors are searching for firms that can find the optimal balance between the conflicting goals of controlling costs paying dividends and increasing production
we re looking to invest in those companies who have been able to improve their production and win the battle as far as cost of extraction said derek rollingson portfolio manager of the icon energy fund which holds shares of more than a dozen shale producers
a further rise in oil prices however could lead investors to take on more risk and penalize more conservative companies said mike breard an energy analyst at hodges capital management in dallas
