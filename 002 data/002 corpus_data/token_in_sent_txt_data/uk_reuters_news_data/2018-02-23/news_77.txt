crude oil stockpiles fell by million barrels in the week to to million barrels the energy information administration eia said on thursday
part of that inventory fall is the shape of the oil curve which makes it uneconomic to store product said greg mckenna chief market strategist at futures brokerage axitrader

the fall in inventories initially sparked price rises in late thursday trading but momentum faded in asia on friday as the focus turned on high exports
crude exports jumped to just above million barrels per day bpd last week the eia data showed close to a record high of million hit in october
that helped pull down net imports to the lowest level on record of below million bpd
