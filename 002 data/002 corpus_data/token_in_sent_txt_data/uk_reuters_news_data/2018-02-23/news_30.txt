cold snap sees european gas prices soar as supply options dwindle
london reuters prices in europe s biggest gas markets surged percent this week ahead of a cold snap that will test the region s reduced supply options and make price spikes more likely as stocks run low
a late winter blast of cold in europe has left traders scrambling for gas in british dutch belgian and french markets after several setbacks to quick sources of supply in the region
these include new limits on output at europe s biggest gas field in groningen the netherlands and utility centrica s decision to close britain s biggest gas storage site
gas stockpiles held in underground sites in britain belgium and france are at their lowest since at least and liquefied natural gas lng shipments are scant following increased demand from asia
in britain gas prices rose near percent this week as plummeting temperatures boosted demand for gas which is used to heat up to percent of the country s homes
traders said demand next week could reach the highest since when britain saw near record demand as temperatures in some parts of the country fell below minus degrees celsius
france belgium and the netherlands face similar challenges
a cold easterly flow will bring increasingly colder air from europe meteorologist georg muller said
britain s gas market in particular is bracing
the uk is much more at risk to spiking prices given the limited levels of seasonal storage that has been caused by the closure of rough said energy aspects analyst trevor sikorski
centrica decided last year to close the more than year old rough site which at its operational peak could hold around percent of the country s gas demand
with storage quite low and domestic supplies including the lack of rough lower dutch gas output from groningen and low liquefied natural gas imports there is a lack of flexibility across the whole of western europe a gas trader said
british gas imports from the netherlands have plummeted as production at the groningen field has been cut to try to reduce earthquakes in the region
dutch imports fell more than percent last year data from britain s department for business energy and industrial strategy published this week showed
only a sharp increase in lng imports could provide some bearish pressure on prices as groningen production is likely to be further reduced in coming months a second gas trader said
