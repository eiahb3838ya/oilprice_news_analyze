row over kenyan oil revenues threatens to delay production
lokichar kenya reuters in the decades before oil was discovered in the northern kenyan region of turkana south poor villagers living in arid scrubland relied on a lone health centre in lokichar town for medical help
since tullow oil found crude there six years ago the company has funded a referral hospital school classrooms and dormitories provided village water points graded roads and paid for scholarships to generate goodwill
seeing the potential benefits of oil residents of the poorest of kenya s counties now want the central government to make up for decades of neglect by ploughing nearly a third of expected oil revenues back into turkana
the central government has other ideas
parliament passed a draft bill in allocating percent of any state oil revenue to local government and percent to communities living where the crude was discovered leaving percent for the central government in nairobi
but president uhuru kenyatta never signed the bill
a revised version due to be debated in parliament this month cuts the regional government share to percent with only percent for local communities
the legislation must be passed before oil production can begin
kenyatta s jubilee party which controls of parliament s seats is likely to back the revised law but some of its lawmakers may break ranks and side with the opposition pushing for more money for local communities
now that they have suffered for so long the revenue from oil must actually feed them treat them and take their children to school said jubilee party member james lomenen member of parliament for turkana south
lomenen plans to table an amendment to the petroleum exploration development and production bill to restore the percent share to local communities
residents see the new terms as another slap in the face for turkana a vast scrubland the size of sri lanka where most residents live in villages without power or running water
joseph nachar a village elder in loktorio which is close to one of tullow s wells said locals will oppose oil companies if they don t get their percent
he vowed to vote against any representative who doesn t fight for their cut
in demonstrators backed by local politicians marched on drilling sites demanding jobs and other benefits forcing tullow to halt work for two weeks
we are the owners of the land where they are getting oil said nachar
local leaders say the money will help make up for years of neglect in areas such as health and education
turkana s literacy rate is just percent while the national average is more than percent
the maternal mortality rate in kenya was for every live births in but in turkana it was above the children s fund unicef said
we are starting from scratch said jane ajele turkana county s executive committee member for health
nairobi officials argue that turkana s economy which largely depends on livestock can not absorb a wave of cash
we want them to prosper but if we see a pitfall somewhere we have to advise people said andrew kamau principal secretary in the ministry of energy and petroleum
most of kenya s oil blocks have not been explored
those owned by tullow and its partners africa oil corp and total sa hold an estimated million barrels
while that s less than african frontier oil countries such as uganda and ghana exports scheduled to start in would earn the government billion a year at peak production at current prices government officials say
that s about percent of annual revenue comparable to the country s biggest export tea
the petroleum bill would also create a sovereign wealth fund financed with oil revenues which the government says it would manage to guard against currency fluctuations and theft
but turkana residents have little faith the government tainted by a series of corruption scandals will manage their money well
kenya loses a third of its state budget the equivalent of about billion to corruption every year former chief philip kinisu told reuters in
the government denied the figure and kinisu was fired five months after giving the interview
his successor did not respond to requests for comment
auditor general edward ouko has also accused the national government of corruption and mismanagement in a series of scathing reports
he has been equally critical of county authorities set up in to help counter complaints about central government theft
about percent of turkana s billion shilling million budget in was unaccounted for ouko s office said
with the corruption that we have in kenya you can only trust what goes to the community directly said mp lomenen
tullow has already spent billion shillings million on community projects
but the row over revenue sharing has eaten into the oil companies tight timelines
the clock is ticking said tullow oil kenya country manager martin mbogo
technical studies of wells in the lokichar basin were due to start last year but have been delayed
so has early oil production due to start last june
about barrels of crude were to be trucked out daily until an km mile pipeline is built to indian ocean ports
petroleum ministry official kamau said delegations including community representatives would visit established producers such as nigeria canada and oman to seek advice on revenue sharing
in nigeria percent of oil revenue goes to local communities though that has not stopped attacks on oil installations by those wanting more
the rest is shared out among the three tiers of the nigerian government the federal branch gets percent
expectations among the turkana people are similarly high
they should think about us because we are not getting any help at all said joshua losepito standing with his wife and daughter outside their hut made of sticks and branches near lokichar town
