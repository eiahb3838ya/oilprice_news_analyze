radical change urged over 20 years to attain climate goals -institute
oslo reuters the world will need sweeping changes over the next years ranging from energy use to food production to achieve climate goals set by almost nations the new heads of a top environmental said on friday
both said revolutions were needed to tackle climate change such as capturing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels or by reforming agriculture where meat production and fertilisers are big sources of greenhouse gases
developed nations should set an example such as germany where chancellor angela merkel is under pressure to end the use of coal in power generation
when germany is not in a position to phase out coal can we expect that poland or indonesia or vietnam or turkey can phase out coal ottmar edenhofer new of the potsdam institute for climate impact research told reuters
edenhofer formerly the institute s chief economist and new johan rockstrom a swedish scientist said governments were far from achieving the core goal in the paris agreement of limiting a rise in global average temperatures to well below two degrees celsius fahrenheit above times
we have just literally years to either succeed or fail in the goals of getting the planet on a more sustainable path rockstrom said in a joint telephone interview
the university of pennsylvania rated the potsdam institute as the world s top environment policy this month
the institute plans to exploit more data to try to grasp harm from natural disasters linked to climate change such as floods droughts or storms
poor families in developing nations often focus for instance on rebuilding their homes after a natural disaster but sometimes stopped sending their children to school even after reconstruction edenhofer said
the institute could use more satellite data for instance the amount of light emitted at night by villages in developing nations as a gauge of local poverty and vulnerability he said
the poorest have the least access to electricity
rockstrom and edenhofer were named by the institute on friday to succeed hans joachim schellnhuber in october
