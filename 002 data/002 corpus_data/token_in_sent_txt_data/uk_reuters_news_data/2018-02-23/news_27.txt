interview-dirty industry undermines push to curb global warming - ex-un climate chief
tepic mexico feb thomson reuters foundation i ndustry s dependence on polluting fossil fuels is at odds with a revolution in transport and renewable energy and could stop the world doing a crucial on rising emissions of gases by a former climate chief warned
christiana figueres who oversaw work on the paris agreement to tackle global warming now leads mission an international initiative that seeks to put greenhouse gas emissions on a downward path by
we re definitely not on track with everything to do with heavy industry that continues to depend on intense electricity and we re not on track with land use said figueres former executive secretary of the
framework convention on climate change
so what happens if we don t get there is we increase our risk and increase the exposure to extreme weather events she told the thomson reuters foundation in an interview
the transport and energy sectors are expected to meet the deadline as a result of more efficient cleaner transportation and a plunge in the cost of generating renewable power figueres said
putting a price on carbon and working out ways to pay for environmental services could also yield benefits alongside incentives to improve land use by restoring degraded soils or boosting reforestation she said
the paris agreement set a goal of keeping the rise in average global temperatures to well below degrees celsius above times and ideally to degrees
science has warned us that if we do not get to that point and begin to bend the emissions curve we will have accelerated negative impacts of climate change figueres said
despite the challenges to the mission goal figueres cautioned against relying on controversial geoengineering techniques to try to cool the planet s temperature
negative emissions technologies to suck carbon back out of the atmosphere could involve capturing gases and storing them underground or fertilising oceans to make them absorb more carbon dioxide
other techniques being discussed include mimicking the activity of volcanoes by spraying chemicals into the earth s upper atmosphere
many scientists fear those methods could be risky have limited success and distract from urgent efforts to cut emissions
our biosphere our forests our whole plant kingdom is the best carbon absorption mechanism we have on this planet it s the safest it doesn t have any negative impacts and we just have not yet extracted all the benefits said figueres
before we go to industrial or chemical engineering the side effects of which we have no idea the cost of which we have no idea i would prefer to first exhaust the possibility of all the technologies we do figueres from costa rica will join female mayors in mexico city on monday for the second conference organised by the urban climate change alliance
the meeting will bring together mayors and business leaders to discuss the role women can play in curbing climate change and making communities more resilient to its impacts
a push by cities in the united states to join states and corporations in moving forward with action to tackle climate change is a counterbalance to president donald trump s decision to pull his country out of the paris deal said figueres
the united states is in a whopping collection of one country the only country in the world that has said it would like to leave the paris agreement she said
it has had a minimal impact internationally as no other country has decided to follow suit she added
at the individual level more people could be spurred to take climate action by highlighting the benefits clean technology can bring which are poised to be even more significant than with the communications boom she said
people tend to think it complex it unfixable somebody else should do it said figueres
but this is the most exciting thing that has happened to us in a long time
