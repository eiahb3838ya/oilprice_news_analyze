norway's wealth fund eyes low-carbon society in energy investments
oslo reuters norway s trillion sovereign wealth fund the world s largest will generally shun investments in energy sources such as coal that are unlikely to be needed in a future society it said on friday
in the norwegian parliament mandated the fund which invests norway s revenues from oil and gas production in stocks bonds and real estate abroad to sell out of firms that derive more than percent of their activities or revenues from coal
this divestment from coal means that the fund does not generally invest in an energy source that will probably not survive the transition to a society the fund said in a letter to the norwegian ministry of finance dated
the letter signed by fund ceo yngve slyngstad and chief corporate governance officer carine smith ihenacho was published on the fund s website on friday
the fund s exposure to climate risk therefore differs from that of a general portfolio it added
the fund proposed in november that it should remove oil and gas stocks from its equity benchmark index which would mean cutting investments in those companies over time
at the time the news sent the value of oil and gas firm worldwide lower
the proposal is under review at the finance ministry and will be voted on by the norwegian parliament at a later stage
