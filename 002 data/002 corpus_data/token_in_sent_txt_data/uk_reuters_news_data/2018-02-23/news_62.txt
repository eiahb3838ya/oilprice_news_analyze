update 2-leaders launch start of afghan section of tapi gas pipeline
turkmenistan will use pipeline to supply pakistan india pipeline work delayed due to problem crossing afghanistan turkmenistan holds world s largest gas reserves adds quotes background detail by marat gurt serhetabat turkmenistan feb reuters regional leaders launched construction work on the afghan section of an billion natural gas pipeline that will link the central asian nation of turkmenistan through afghanistan to pakistan and india
turkmenistan holds the world s natural gas reserves but has been heavily dependent on gas exports to china after russia cut back gas imports in the past few years
the project is expected to transport billion cubic metres bcm of natural gas a year along an kilometre miles route from galkynysh the world s gas field to fazilka near the border with pakistan in northern india
south asia is being connected with central asia through afghanistan after more than a century of division afghan president ashraf ghani said
he was speaking at a ceremony attended by turkmen president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov pakistani prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi and india s minister of state for external affairs akbar
while the pipeline will allow turkmenistan to find new consumers in asia and cut its dependence on beijing which buys about billion cubic metres of gas annually
it is also being seen as a central plank in ambitious regional development goals
tapi will lead from a gas pipeline into an energy and communication corridor abbasi said adding that as well as providing energy the pipeline would underpin development of road rail and communications networks
the tapi project supported by the united states and the asian development bank has been touted by turkmenistan since the
but the start of work was delayed because of the problem of crossing afghanistan
the pipeline will run for hundreds of kilometres miles through areas of southern afghanistan largely controlled by taliban insurgents fighting the government in kabul but the movement has signalled that it will not hinder the project
the taliban issued a statement on friday pledging its cooperation with tapi which it said would be an important element in building up afghanistan s economic infrastructure
there will be no delay in this important national project it said in a statement which blamed the government in kabul for delays in starting construction
ghani striving to build up afghanistan s economy has pushed the development of regional transport and energy networks to underpin development and turn afghanistan into a regional hub instead of a source of instability
afghanistan which suffers from chronic energy shortages is expected to take billion cubic metres of gas itself with the rest divided equally between pakistan and india
in addition kabul will earn hundreds of millions of dollars in transit fees
