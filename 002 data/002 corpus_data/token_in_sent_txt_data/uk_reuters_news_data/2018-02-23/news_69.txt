cambodia's ruling party set to sweep senate election
phnom penh reuters the ruling cambodian people s party cpp of hun sen is poised to sweep a senate election at the weekend helping to consolidate the prime minister s rule of more than years amid a crackdown on the opposition
sunday s election for members of the senate will see members of parliament and commune councillors vote at polling stations across cambodia
two senate members each are appointed by the king and the national assembly
but rights groups and opposition politicians say the senate vote is a farce that shows hun sen who faces a national election in july is not committed to democracy
almost half of the commune councillors have been stripped of their right to vote in sunday s election after their opposition cambodia national rescue party cnrp was dissolved by a court last november at the request of hun sen s government
it s the first time the senate election will be held without the main opposition without competition said koul panha of the committee for free and fair elections in cambodia an election watchdog
about cnrp commune councillors or percent of the eligible to vote had been stripped of their voting rights he added
it s neither democratic nor free and only three small political parties are contesting the vote apart from the cpp
i expect that we will win by a lot said sok eysan a cpp spokesman in the running for sunday s election
it is percent sure that i will be the ruling cpp was the only party to hold rallies during the campaign period leading up to sunday s vote the national election committee said
the senate whose members have terms is seen as a rubber stamp institution but the president has constitutional power as the head of state to sign bills into law when the king is abroad
dissolution of the cnrp was followed by the arrest of its leader kem sokha last year for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government with help an accusation both the united states and kem sokha have rejected
the cnrp ban effectively removes any major obstacles to hun sen s in july
mu sochua the deputy president of the cnrp called sunday s vote a sham saying it would further widen cambodia s political divide
it is a sham election for the sole interest of the cpp to maintain and control absolute power mu sochua who lives abroad in exile told reuters
