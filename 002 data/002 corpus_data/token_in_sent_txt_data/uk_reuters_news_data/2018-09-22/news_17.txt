libya's agoco resumes 3,000 bpd production at abandoned well in messla
tripoli sept reuters libya s national oil corporation noc said on saturday its subsidiary the arabian gulf oil company agoco had restored production at barrels of oil per day bpd at an abandoned well in the eastern messla field
after years of inactivity production resumed at the well using the latest drilling techniques developed by oilfield services company schlumberger the noc said in a statement
the north african country was producing more than million bpd before a uprising that toppled muammar gaddafi and led to political fragmentation and armed conflict
messla s output was around bpd
since libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country causing political deadlock and an economic crisis
however the noc has continued to function relatively normally across libya which relies on oil exports for most of its income
output has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day
earlier this month the noc suffered a shooting attack on its tripoli headquarters claimed by islamic state militants that killed two people and wounded
but it continued to manage its operations as normal it said
along with the central bank the noc is one of the only state enterprises still functioning well despite the conflict
