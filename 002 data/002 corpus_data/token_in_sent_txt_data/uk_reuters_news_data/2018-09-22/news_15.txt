update 3-opec and allies struggle to pump more oil as iran supply falls
algiers reuters opec and its allies reduced oil output in august as a drop in iranian supply due to sanctions derailed their attempts to raise production to agreed levels delegates said on saturday as the energy producers prepared to hold talks in algiers
the development further raises pressure on the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to boost supply amid calls from president donald trump to lower oil prices
on friday a source familiar with the discussions told reuters opec and its allies led by russia were considering the possibility of raising crude supplies by a further barrels per day bpd as sanctions on opec s producer iran bite into tehran s exports
if an increase in production is proposed there will be plenty of market that it reduces even further the available spare capacity olivier jakob from consultancy petromatrix said
saudi arabia has made the mistake of trying to compensate for the loss of iranian supplies with replacement but the oil market is looking for greater supply security than that
as a result the strength of oil prices is now putting oil demand growth at risk he added
an opec and monitoring committee gathering in the algerian capital this weekend found that oil producers compliance with a agreement reached percent in august two committee delegates said
this compares with a compliance level of percent for july indicating that the group went beyond its agreed cut
oman s oil minister mohammed bin hamad told reporters on saturday that opec and producers overachieved on pledged output cuts by bpd in august putting the reduction at around million bpd
seeking to reverse a downturn in oil prices that began in opec russia and other allies decided in late to reduce supply by some million bpd
in june this year however after months of cutting by more than their pact had called for amid involuntary reductions from venezuela and other producers they agreed to boost output by returning to percent compliance
that equates to an increase of about million bpd but the latest figures show they are some way from achieving that target
oil reached a barrel this month prompting trump to demand again that opec bring down prices
we protect the countries of the middle east they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices
we will remember
the opec monopoly must get prices down now he wrote on twitter
higher gasoline prices for consumers could create a political headache for trump before november congressional elections
opec sources said any official action to raise output would require opec to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting a proposal that is not on the table yet
but the joint opec and ministerial committee known as the jmmc which meets on sunday can still recommend a further increase in output if needed the sources said
