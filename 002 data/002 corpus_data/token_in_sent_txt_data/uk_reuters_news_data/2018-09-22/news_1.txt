german agency doubts benefits of incentives to trade in old diesels-report
berlin sept reuters the german environment agency uba is doubtful about the environmental benefits of introducing incentives for drivers of older diesel vehicles to trade them in for newer models a german newspaper reported on saturday
chancellor angela merkel is due to hold a meeting on sunday to discuss whether to require the car industry to carry out costly hardware upgrades for older diesel vehicles to reduce pollution government sources said on friday
transport minister andreas scheuer a member of merkel s bavarian csu allies favours incentives to exchange older vehicles for newer ones to reduce overall pollution caused by the fleet of cars on the road and to avoid driving bans
but frankfurter allgemeine newspaper cited an internal paper from uba as saying this would not help much in the best case scenario an exchange premium would only reduce nitric oxide pollution by micrograms per cubic that would be a very small amount compared with the overall pollution which is at between and micrograms in cities like stuttgart or munich the newspaper cited uba as saying
uba which is germany s main environmental protection agency was not immediately available for comment
older diesel vehicles such as those of the standard sometimes have lower emissions than the more modern standard diesel vehicles
scheuer has not ruled out the possibility of a retrofit with catalysts which is favoured by the environment ministry run by the social democrats but he considers that solution to be more complicated technically and more expensive
merkel has tasked scheuer with finding a solution to make older diesel cars cleaner and to avoid bans on diesel cars
the car industry has lobbied against equipping old diesel models with extra emissions control technology because that could cost billions of euros
