china drafts new nuclear energy law, focus on international market
shanghai reuters china will provide more support for its nuclear firms to go overseas and strengthen their position on the international market according to new draft legislation submitted to the industry for consultation on friday
the state will encourage and support the positive and orderly participation of its enterprises in the international market and promote the export of nuclear equipment fuel and services the draft atomic energy law says
china aims to bring its total installed nuclear capacity to gigawatts gw by the end of up from gw at the end of june this year but it also has ambitions to dominate the global market and has created a unified reactor brand known as the hualong one to sell overseas
china has already signed a series of preliminary agreements with countries like brazil argentina uganda and cambodia and it is also undergoing a technical approval process for the hualong one in britain
the government also published new guidelines last month aimed at promoting its own technical standards in foreign markets and play a leading role in the global nuclear technology standardization process
however its only overseas nuclear project so far is the chashma nuclear complex in pakistan
china s new draft atomic energy law sets out the government s responsibilities when it comes to disclosing information about the safety and environmental impact of nuclear power
it also includes clauses calling for the convergence of military and civilian research into nuclear energy
it calls for the establishment of a uranium reserve and a system for storing transporting and treating spent fuel
members of the public are invited to submit their opinions about the legislation to the ministry of justice before
china was once regarded as one of the bright spots for the global nuclear sector but its ambitious domestic reactor building program has slowed considerably with no new projects approved since
in a bid to guarantee safety in the wake of japan s fukushima disaster in china promised to deploy only new and safer reactor technology including westinghouse s and the epr designed by france s areva
but the untested models have been repeatedly delayed amid design flaws and huge cost overruns and beijing is now expected to struggle to meet its gw target
