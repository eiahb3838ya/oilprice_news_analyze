u.s. says won't hesitate to impose sanctions over fuel to n. korea
washington reuters the state department said on saturday that washington would not wait to impose sanctions on any shippers helping to get fuel to north korea in an apparent warning to russia days after the ambassador to the united nations accused moscow of cheating on the measures
north korea continues to employ tactics to evade sanctions heather nauert the state department spokeswoman said in a statement adding that member states are required to prohibit transfers of petroleum fuel to the hermit country
the united states will not hesitate to impose sanctions on any individual entity or vessel supporting north korea s illicit activities regardless of nationality nauert said
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since in a bid to choke funding for pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile programs
but the united states and russia have recently shown cracks in the unity of the council over the sanctions
washington has evidence of consistent and russian violations of the sanctions the ambassador to the nikki haley said on monday
russia was helping north korea illegally obtain fuel through transfers at sea had refused to expel a north korean whom the security council blacklisted last year and had pushed for changes to an independent report on sanctions violations to cover up breaches by russians she said
russia said after haley s comments that moscow had not pressured the authors of the report and blamed haley for heightening tensions
with the warning on fuel shipments the trump administration signalled it was keeping pressure on pyongyang even after saying there has been progress
president donald trump this week hailed a summit between north korean leader kim jong un and south korean president moon and said there had been tremendous progress with north korea on several fronts including pyongyang s denuclearisation
washington has tracked some cases this year of tankers delivering fuel to north korea in breach of a cap of barrels a year
haley has not said how many of those transfers may have involved russia
both russia and china have suggested the security council discuss easing sanctions after trump and kim met in june and kim pledged to work toward denuclearisation
secretary of state mike pompeo said on friday the united states is working to set up another summit between trump and kim after their unprecedented meeting in singapore but there is still work to do
