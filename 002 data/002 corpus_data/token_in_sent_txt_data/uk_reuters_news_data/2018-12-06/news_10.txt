u.s. coast guard chief optimistic about icebreaker ship funding
washington dec reuters the united states may soon get funding for a new heavy icebreaker ship the head of the coast guard said on thursday as global warming spurs the race to stake out the arctic which is rich in oil gas and minerals
the united states has two operational icebreakers a heavy one the polar star which is more than years old and has outlived its life expectancy by a dozen years and a medium one the healy cutter
by comparison russia has about to icebreakers vessels that can rescue other ships supply bases and reach oil spills in harsh polar conditions
i m guardedly optimistic funding for that first polar security cutter is going to be there commandant karl schultz said at a national press club event
icebreakers support scientific missions and operate in the arctic and antarctic which hold vast natural gas oil mineral fish and fresh water resources schultz said
while washington participates in several forums on arctic security and cooperation such as the arctic council it also needs to ensure it has the necessary equipment he said
china early this year declared itself a near arctic state outlined how it believed the region should be developed and is expanding its icebreaker fleet
diplomacy and cooperation are really hollow or shallow without presence schultz said adding that the country needs a minimum of six icebreakers which can cost about billion each and take up to years to build
if we re not present if we don t own the environment today guess who owns it tomorrow our while president donald trump s administration has budgeted million for an icebreaker it is not certain whether the funding will survive in congress which is also looking for ways to fund the border wall with mexico among other items
the coast guard is part of homeland security one of several departments that have not been funded for the budget
congress is expected to consider a billion bill before stopgap funding expires on to fund the agencies through the fiscal year that ends next
