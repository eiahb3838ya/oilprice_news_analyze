analysis-oil's sharp price drop fuels questions for stock market
new york dec reuters stock investors are wary that a percent slump in oil prices will pressure corporate profits while also presenting a sign of weakness in global growth at a time they are already weighing when the long economic expansion will end
crude prices rebounded off of lows to start the week with investors focused on thursday s meeting in vienna of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and allied producing countries including russia
a monitoring committee of opec and its allies agreed on the need to cut oil output in two sources familiar with the discussions said
oil s drop holds economic benefits including lower costs for some companies and cheaper fuel prices for consumers
but investors were already bracing for a significant drop in profit growth next year and the oil price slump is poised to bite into profits for energy producers and related companies that are part of wall street s benchmark s p stock index
opec and allied producers used output cuts to curb an oil glut that sent prices from late into a prolonged slump bringing prices to below a barrel at the start of
but supplies are growing again and the trade war and other factors have investors worried that slowing economic growth could erase demand and send prices still lower
what started the on oil was a supply issue said alicia levine chief market strategist at bny mellon investment management
in the last couple of weeks what we are getting is fears of slowing demand
and fears of slowing demand are directly related to fears of global growth crude oil prices have fallen percent or more times since according to ed clissold chief strategist at ned davis research
of the prior occurrences the oil drop overlapped eight times with what ned davis research defines as a cyclical bear market a percent drop in the dow jones industrial average after calendar days or a percent decline after calendar days
however finds clissold in only three of those cases did the oil decline overlap with a economic recession
futures contracts for crude known as west texas intermediate wti topped a barrel in early october
the commodity slid to as low as last week but has clawed back since and is now trading around
brent the global crude benchmark has notched a similar percentage drop
somewhere in the level it s probably a good level for the market because producers are making enough money and it s also helping the consumer said keith lerner chief market strategist at suntrust advisory services in atlanta
but if you see an abrupt move down the bigger concern is what is that signaling about the global oil s decline has coincided with increased turbulence in the stock market
the benchmark s p late last month confirmed a correction a decline of more than percent from its high
still investor optimism about a less aggressive path of hikes prompted a modest market rebound
both oil and equities markets have been focused on international trade china s economic health and the global economy said david katz chief investment officer at matrix asset advisors in new york
for the near term the two are very closely correlated katz said
since oil s october peak the s p energy sector has dropped percent about twice the drop for the overall s p
analysts have been lowering earnings estimates for the sector with s p energy companies now expected to increase earnings by percent in down from an expectation of percent on oct according to ibes data from refinitiv
many investor see positives in the oil drop including a potential stimulus for consumer spending through lower gasoline prices
lower fuel prices could help check inflation allowing the federal reserve to slow its program of interest rate hikes
but david bianco americas chief investment officer for dws estimates that every per barrel decline in oil prices shaves to per share from s p earnings
the s p is expected to earn per share this year according to ibes data from refinitiv
that earnings impact includes not just energy companies but also industrial manufacturers that service the energy sector
it also accounts for any earnings boost for companies like airlines and consumer companies that benefit from lower fuel prices
the s p is much more of a commodity producer than a commodity user bianco said
higher commodity prices bring higher profits and lower commodity prices bring lower profits this is one of the most reliable relationships when it comes to corporate profitability of them reporting by lewis krauskopf editing by david gregorio
