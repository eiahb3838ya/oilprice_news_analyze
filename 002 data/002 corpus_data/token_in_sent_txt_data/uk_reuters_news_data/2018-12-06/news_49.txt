u.s. epa to roll back carbon rule on new coal plants
washington dec reuters the trump administration is expected on thursday to roll back an rule that requires new coal plants to capture their carbon emissions a move that could crack open the door in coming years for new plants fired by the fossil fuel
the environmental protection agency epa will make an energy policy announcement at est gmt on thursday
andrew wheeler epa s acting administrator will speak alongside harry alford president of the national black chamber of commerce a opponent of former president barack obama s limits on carbon emissions
the epa is expected to propose allowing new coal plants to emit up to pounds kg of carbon dioxide per of electricity according to a new york times report citing unnamed sources
the trump proposal which is sure to be challenged by lawsuits from environmental groups would replace an standard allowing only pounds of carbon per
that obama rule would have forced new plants to install carbon capture equipment that is not yet commercially available
no company has plans to build a new coal plant due to competition from plentiful and natural gas
that could change as president donald trump rolls back rules meant to curb emissions linked to global warming
i m not giving up on building a new generation of power plants in this country said myron ebell who led trump s epa transition team last year
ebell said trump s policies could allow new coal plants to be build in the next five or years
the administration says coal plants can be made to burn coal far more efficiently
but high costs have made them uneconomic
the regulatory roll back comes ahead of the annual climate talks in poland next week where white house officials plan a panel on coal technology
it was unclear whether the proposal can withstand lawsuits
jay duffy a legal associate at clean air task force said the weaker carbon emissions level would not satisfy federal clean air law requirements for the best available emissions technology
while the carbon capture equipment the obama rule would have required is technologically feasible it is expensive
but duffy said obama s rule would drive down costs
if trump is really interested in supporting coal miners what he should be looking at is supporting and advancing carbon capture said duffy
that s the only way coal survives in a future where rules on carbon constraints are likely he said
