japan eases conditions for solar power subsidy curbs
tokyo reuters the japanese government has decided to relax the conditions for cutting solar power subsidies for projects that have not started operations following opposition from power producers and other firms
the ministry of economy trade and industry meti in october had proposed that companies granted permits for solar projects between the fiscal years of and under the fit system that guarantees minimum power prices submit applications by march to connect to the grid
but the proposals had angered power producers and investors who say the cuts will undermine their profitability and violate earlier agreements
following the opposition meti late on wednesday said it would delay the deadline for submission of applications for at least megawatt projects to the end of september
the deadline for start of operations was also delayed by six months to the end of september
companies that miss the deadline will see their price guarantees under the tariffs of to yen to per kilowatt hour kwh cut to yen per kwh
meti estimates show the subsidy cut could affect gigawatts of solar capacity or nearly percent of the amount the government approved in the period after the fit scheme was created in
meti has said the cuts are necessary to reduce the public burden of fit subsidies which are added to consumers bills
at the same time meti is likely unhappy with the amount of unfilled permits
data from the ministry shows percent of the total capacity approved in the fiscal year is not operating with percent approved in and percent approved in also not operating
japan introduced the fit scheme to spur solar developments to fill the power gap after the country closed its nuclear power plants following the fukushima disaster
