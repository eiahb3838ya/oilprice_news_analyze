developing nations say swifter climate action depends on cash to pay for it
katowice poland dec thomson reuters foundation d eveloping countries with fewer resources to cut carbon emissions and adapt to climate change can not step up their efforts to combat global warming unless they get more support in the form of funding and technology they said on thursday
india will deliver on what it has promised to do under the paris agreement by boosting renewable energy production expanding forests and generating fewer emissions in relation to its gross domestic product its chief negotiator ak mehta said
we are very certain that we will not renege on our commitment we will do what is required he told journalists on the sidelines of climate talks in poland
the institute for energy economics and financial analysis said this month that india is on track to achieve two of its three targets well ahead of a deadline
but it faces challenges in doing so mehta emphasised
if the south asian nation wanted to step up its efforts on solar power in a big way for example it would need assistance with energy storage technology he noted
india met a goal of installing gigawatts of solar power four years early and is now aiming for gigawatts by making it one of the world s most ambitious adopters
but as nations around the world try to move toward a common goal of reducing emissions everybody is not similarly placed in their ability to make those cuts mehta said
more than countries are meeting in the town of katowice through to hammer out rules that will enable the paris accord to be put into practice from and spur countries to strengthen their current climate action plans
current pledges to cut emissions would lead to global warming of about degrees celsius this century scientists say
under the paris deal governments have pledged to hold temperature rise to well below degrees c above times and ideally to degrees the world has already warmed about degree c scientists say
on wednesday a scientific report said global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise nearly percent this year due to continued fossil fuel use dashing hopes an increase in was temporary after two years of slowdown
that and other recent reports have underlined the urgency of ramping up efforts to reduce emissions and under the paris agreement countries are expected to increase the ambition of their plans by
at stake in katowice is how they do that
the guidelines decided at the talks will be crucial to sharing the burden of the work with poorer countries saying they need more financial help to do their part
for the least developed nations funding is a key piece in the puzzle that will enable them to deliver on their pledges said gebru jember endalew who chairs the group of states
increasing your ambition on your climate action plan alone will not be the right answer
there needs to be ambition in terms of increasing financial support the ethiopian said
the climate talks have long tangled over how rich countries will meet a promise to raise billion a year from to help developing countries go green and cope with wild weather
the latest figures show climate finance is rising but there is no agreement on what should be counted towards that goal
a report issued by un environment on thursday said there is a considerable gap between countries current preparedness for climate change and the actual measures needed to get communities ready for a future of increasing climate risks
while and countries have shown steady progress catching up with wealthier nations in their ability to adapt will take many decades unless help increases it said
funding flows for adaptation are significantly lower than the needs outlined in national action plans it noted
in katowice some rich countries are resisting pressure to project how much they will contribute in the future saying they can not forecast that far ahead due to short budget cycles
but endalew said projected amounts would only be indicative and should not cause political problems back in capitals
manuel wwf s global climate lead said meeting the billion annual goal from was an important political signal
but genuinely reworking energy systems and making the world safer would take much more money he suggested
after we should be finding ways to shift the trillions of dollars that are the only way to really address climate change he told the thomson reuters foundation
who as a former peruvian environment minister presided over the lima talks in said the only way to ensure national climate action plans are boosted enough to meet the paris goals was to agree a strong rulebook in katowice
if we fail on that we can t keep the promise and we are going to postpone solutions he warned
both mehta and endalew said they were optimistic the talks could achieve a satisfactory rulebook even if some finer details remained to be settled later
mehta said india s existing climate plan was already very ambitious and it was too early to say whether it could be improved on by
but we will be willing to engage if the rules of the game are clear and if it is an inclusive process he said
achim steiner head of the united nations development programme said india and china should do more because renewables and energy efficiency offer significant economic opportunities
but there was little point in governments lecturing one another on levels of ambition he noted
let invest in strengthening the public policy that allows a country to begin to accelerate efforts he said in a phone interview from new york
