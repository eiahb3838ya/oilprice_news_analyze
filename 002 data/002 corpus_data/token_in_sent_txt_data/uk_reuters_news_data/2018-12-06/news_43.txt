column-coal's lingering role complicates climate change efforts: kemp
london reuters global coal consumption is set to remain steady in absolute terms through the middle of the century even as its relative share of total energy consumption declines in favour of oil gas and renewables
the persistence of coal consumption is consistent with the experience of earlier energy transitions and is one of the central challenges for policymakers concerned about climate change
continued coal combustion is one reason why policymakers are not on track to achieve their target of limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below degrees above levels
coal is projected to be the slowest growing primary energy source over the next three decades with its share of total primary energy consumption expected to decline to just percent by from percent in
but in absolute terms global coal consumption is still projected to be around quadrillion british thermal units btus in up from quadrillion btus in according to the energy information administration
rising consumption in india and other developing economies is expected to offset reduced combustion in the united states and china international energy outlook energy information administration
projections have proved notoriously inaccurate in the past because they are sensitive to small changes in the assumptions underlying the model so any effort at should be treated with caution
but the projections show how the impact of rising populations and prosperity in developing economies is likely to drive an enormous increase in total energy demand which will continue to support absolute coal consumption
coal consumption is almost certain to remain a major part of the energy mix especially in poorer countries even as oil gas nuclear and renewables become relatively more important
the persistence of of coal consumption for many decades is consistent with earlier energy transitions in which incumbent and emerging energy sources and technologies for long periods
energy historians have identified a grand energy transition in which human and animal muscle power has been successively replaced by wind and water mills wood burning coal and more recently oil and gas
at each stage the dominant source of energy was replaced by a new one that was more convenient more flexible and offered greater power or more and better energy services for the same cost
chartbook the same transition can be identified at for services such as lighting where tallow candles were gradually replaced by stearin candles kerosene lamps gas lighting incandescent electric bulbs and now diodes
by making energy services such as heating lighting transportation and power dramatically cheaper energy transitions have encouraged an enormous increase in total energy consumption heat power and light revolutions in energy services fouquet
in almost every case the rise in total consumption has resulted in increased use of both the new emerging energy source or technology and the old incumbent one
in the united states for example wood burning continued growing for several decades even as coal emerged as the fastest growing and eventually dominant energy source in the second half of the nineteenth century
use of fuel wood continued to grow in absolute terms until even as it declined per capita and as a percentage of total energy consumption continuously from the fuel wood used in the united states department of agriculture
despite its increasing importance coal consumption did not finally overtake wood as the dominant source of energy until energy in the american economy resources for the future
coal itself was not replaced by oil as the dominant source of energy in the united states until almost a century after the petroleum revolution began with the first modern wells drilled in pennsylvania
in britain the railways which relied on steam stimulated rather than replaced vehicles for decades because passengers and freight relied on carriages and carts to get to and from the rail stations
the use of horses primarily for short journeys continued to increase into the long after the railways had come to dominate travel in the the transport revolution from bagwell
in both britain and the united states surging demand for lighting provided a growing market for gas and kerosene lamps long after the introduction of the incandescent lightbulb burning to serve goodall
the lesson from history is that energy transitions take a long time usually many decades and in the early and the new energy tends to add to rather than displace the older one
even once an energy source or technology goes into absolute as well as relative decline consumption can remain substantial for decades
the united states was still using more fuel wood in the than it had in the even though wood had been clearly overtaken by coal and to a lesser extent petroleum as an energy source
in specific sectors and applications one energy source or technology can supplant another over a relatively short period of perhaps years
but at a major transitions take much longer with legacy energy sources and technologies lingering for perhaps years
the expected persistence of substantial global coal consumption through and beyond is consistent with the pattern from earlier transitions and poses a major challenge for climate policy
