by clyde russell launceston australia dec reuters it s not shaping up as a merry christmas for coal exporters to asia as the region s top buyers china and india pull back from the recent trend of strong imports
the chinese authorities appear to be making good on a commitment to try and limit the country s imports of the polluting fuel to levels the same as
the restrictions have led to a sharp drop in the daily import of coal so far in december according to and port data compiled by refinitiv
seaborne imports in the first five days of the month stood at million tonnes or a daily rate of just tonnes
this compares to total seaborne imports of million tonnes in the first months of a daily rate of about tonnes
the authorities in beijing have told coal traders and utilities they want imports for the whole year to be similar to the million tonnes in
this is likely going to be a challenge since customs data showed imports for the first months of the year were million tonnes up percent from the same period in
with data pointing to november seaborne imports of about million tonnes this would in theory leave only about million tonnes available for december
at the rate of imports for the first five days of december this may just be possible as it suggests about million tonnes for the month as a whole
however the data doesn t cover overland imports mainly from neighbouring mongolia meaning it s likely that imports will probably exceed those of
but the sharp reduction in imports so far in december shows beijing s message to the industry is being heeded
india the coal importer behind china also appears to be cutting back in december with a mere tonnes discharged in the first five days a paltry daily rate of tonnes
the daily rate of imports for the first months of the year was tonnes according to the refinitiv data
the lower imports so far in december are at odds with recent developments in india as utilities and steel makers have resorted to buying more from overseas to overcome domestic transport bottlenecks
it s possible that india s december imports will be boosted by arrivals from indonesia given that it takes about two weeks to sail from the region of kalimantan to india s west coast
indeed the data shows million tonnes of coal is likely to be imported by india in december a figure certain to increase as more cargoes from indonesia are fixed
however even if the number does rise in coming days it s likely december will be below the million tonnes imported in november and the million in october
the weaker imports by both china and india are being reflected in coal prices in australia and indonesia the world s two largest exporters
benchmark thermal coal at australia s newcastle port as assessed by argus media rose slightly in the week to to a tonne
this was up from the low of a tonne in the week to but also percent below the year high of reached in late july
indonesian thermal coal with an energy rating of kilocalories per kilogram has fared even worse than its australian counterpart dropping to a tonne on the week to
this is down percent from its high and is the lowest price since july according to pricing agency argus media
if there is a positive for coal exporters it s that the lower prices should act as a boost for india s imports from indonesia and china s restrictions may lead to demand in the early months of
