update 3-trump's epa proposes looser carbon limits on new coal plants
washington reuters the trump administration on thursday proposed rolling back an rule requiring new coal plants to slash carbon emissions a move that could crack open the door in coming years for new plants fired by the fossil fuel
the environmental protection agency s acting administrator andrew wheeler a former coal lobbyist announced the proposal
it would allow new coal plants to emit up to pounds kg of carbon dioxide per of electricity up from pounds now
the move to revive the ailing coal industry whose share in the energy mix has been in decline caused an uproar among environmental groups who said it ignored dire warnings from the world s scientists about climate change
we are rescinding unfair burdens on american energy providers and leveling the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of america s future wheeler said at a press conference
he spoke alongside harry alford president of the national black chamber of commerce a opponent of former president barack obama s limits on carbon emissions
the epa hopes to finalize the rule after a public comment period
this proposal is another illegal attempt by the trump administration to prop up an industry already buckling under the powerful force of the free market said
senator sheldon whitehouse a democrat on the senate environment committee
under the existing rule new coal plants would have to burn some natural gas which emits less carbon or install carbon capture equipment or highly efficient technology that is not yet commercially available
wheeler argued the proposal would not boost greenhouse emissions but would actually help drive them down by encouraging investment in new energy technologies which could then be exported
i d love to see coal plants being built in china and india meet our standards he said
the announcement came ahead of annual climate talks in poland next week where white house officials plan a panel on coal technology
a government report last month found climate change will cost the national economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century
that bleak picture clashes with the trump administration s agenda
we are not ignoring the government report wheeler said
but he added a lot of the media s focused on is the the energy information administration has projected that coal demand will fall this year to the lowest in years as the power industry moves further toward natural gas and renewables like solar and wind
the government lists plans for two new major coal fired power plants over the next five years which could benefit from the epa s rollback
still it also lists plans for retirements
asked if the epa had an estimate on whether the new proposal would result in many new coal plants being built wheeler said that was not up to the agency
we are not picking winners and losers here he said
jay duffy a legal associate at clean air task force said lifting the carbon emissions limit failed to satisfy clean air law requirements for the best available emissions technology
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a republican applauded the epa s proposal saying it would help families working in the coal industry in his state of kentucky
coal deserves a level playing field and that s what this white house is trying to accomplish mcconnell said
