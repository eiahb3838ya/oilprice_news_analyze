column-commentary: can macron survive france's 'yellow vest' revolution?
david andelman a former foreign correspondent for the new york times and cbs news is author of a shattered peace versailles and the price we pay the opinions expressed here are his own
by david andelman dec reuters nicole barthelemy the quiet gracious owner of one of paris s premier cheese shops on the rue de grenelle told me this week with real panic in her eyes i have never in years been so afraid as i am and with good reason
only a few blocks away on the rue de solferino around the corner from the musée d orsay in the building where i ve lived off and on since two barricades were built on this quiet residential street
one was set ablaze last saturday and burned for hours
but while madame barthelemy and i may need to dodge scattered clouds of tear gas launched by france s redoubtable gendarmerie president emmanuel macron is fighting for his political life
at least for the moment his vision for his country and for europe seems increasingly disconnected from the people who elected him
tens of thousands have taken the streets to demonstrate their displeasure
and that s what is stoking fear among barthelemy and millions more
it s not hard to find reasons for this sudden unraveling of the grand ambitions of the youngest french leader since napoleon
macron s visions for this future appear increasingly disconnected from anything france even europe has known or at least for the moment even wants
we must do away with this little political world which functions only for itself laurent tinois told the french daily le monde
a public works department laborer in northern france he is a local leader of the movement known as the for their yellow vests which all french motorists must keep in their cars for emergencies
the and the hooligans or casseurs breakers who have ridden along like pilot fish have been at the center of weeks of unrest
tinois s views echo those of hundreds of thousands who have demonstrated and rioted across the nation
the revolution of the yellow vests has become more of a political movement for utter social change than an economic issue of taxation which was the spark that set off this firestorm of protest
so on tuesday when prime minister édouard philippe went on national television to announce a suspension of a gas tax increase the outrage over the sop of halfway measures was palpable
tinois voted in the last election for macron s opponent mélenchon
other protesters admitted to voting for a range of macron opponents from mélenchon on the left to leader marine le pen
all have taken advantage of this movement to press their disparate desires new parliamentary elections even macron s resignation
much of this political action seems designed to last year s vote that swept macron and his new political party into office with a landslide and what appeared to be an unchallengeable mandate
though as is now becoming apparent this was hardly so
thousands stayed away from the polls because they saw little they really liked and now they seem to be venting their anger in the streets
as someone who has observed how french presidents back to charles de gaulle dealt with the protests that erupted from even the narrowest change in direction i feel macron had little real understanding of the nation he was seeking to transform
france is effectively a giant ocean liner lumbering straight ahead
but macron arrived in the pilot house and immediately tried to make a sudden turn in direction
the move to the barricades to protest taxes and inequalities should have been entirely predictable to anyone familiar with the nation s history
while barricades date to the century in france the french revolution in was the first time such a show of resistance led to the beheading of a french king louis xvi and his wife marie antoinette
the barricades went up again in times of turmoil like the revolution and in they began in the latin quarter with a student rebellion that spread quickly to workers and farmers alike before de gaulle restored order by threatening to resign
back then not an insignificant threat
this time the revolution threatens to spread again
in the wake of vast rioting and pillaging along the thousands of students have gone out on strike across the country at times battling police as they protest the curriculum changes that are part of macron s education reforms
in front of the national assembly in paris just minutes from my apartment scores of ambulances have blocked traffic for hours sirens blaring hundreds of drivers protesting rules that discriminate against small individual ambulance companies in favor of a few behemoths
faced with an inchoate and leaderless though powerful movement and having moved too quickly with his reforms macron s easy fix of suspending the gas tax increase first for six months then for all of may be insufficient
he s also dug in his heels on upholding his repeal of the surtax on the wealthy that socialist president francois mitterrand initiated three decades ago
we will never unravel anything we ve done over the past months macron declared to a session of his cabinet wednesday evening
macron s reversal of this tax led many to brand him president of the of course macron has had reasons intellectually quite brilliant for each of his fiscal moves
the gas tax was designed to pay for a france
ending the wealth tax was designed to lure british bankers driven from london by brexit
but none of this is immediately apparent to french provincial workers many of whom squeak by on the minimum wage of around euro a month to feed their families and buy gas to get to work in a countryside with little public transport
there really are two frances rich and poor but especially urban and rural
now both seem to be united in their revolt and fear for their future
with no one organized to negotiate on the other side the government has found no solution beyond putting more military force on the streets for what promises to be another saturday of chaos and violence
but france s president faces a crisis different from any other western leader
macron s is a vast peasant uprising that requires a whole new set of nuanced political tools if he is to neutralize this unrest before it lurches utterly out of control
