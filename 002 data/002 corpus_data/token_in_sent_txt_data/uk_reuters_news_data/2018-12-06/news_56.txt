update 3-china hails trump-xi summit, says 'very confident' in trade deal
beijing reuters china on thursday expressed confidence in striking a trade deal with the united states within their ceasefire period praising the recent meeting between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping as highly successful
in argentina last weekend trump and xi agreed to a truce that delayed the planned hike of tariffs to percent from percent on billion billion pounds of chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal
we are very confident in reaching an agreement with the united states within the next days china s commerce ministry spokesman gao feng said in a weekly briefing adding both sides have been communicating and cooperating smoothly since the leaders met in argentina
china s ultimate goal during the trade talks is to remove all tariffs imposed on chinese goods gao said
his comments come as the arrest of a top executive of chinese tech giant huawei by canadian authorities on washington s request threatens to spark a in tensions between the world s two economic powerhouses once again
the two countries have hit each other with on goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars in sectors from automobiles to agriculture and energy stymying trade and redrawing global supply chains
gao confirmed for the first time since the meeting that china had agreed to implement consensus reached by both sides on agriculture energy and cars although he did not give details on any specific measures
we will start with agricultural products energy automobiles to immediately implement the issues that the two sides have reached consensus gao said when asked about what is on the negotiation agenda
then in the next days we will follow a clear timetable and roadmap to negotiate on issues such as intellectual property right protection tech cooperation market access and trade balance he said stressing the consultations should be based on meeting the interests of both parties
the white house has said china had committed to start buying more american products and lifting tariff and barriers immediately while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection
the united states has levied additional duties of between percent and percent on billion of chinese goods this year as punishment for what it calls china s unfair trade practices
china has responded with its own tariffs
china and united states have reached very important consensus as both sides interests overlap gao said
his comments echoed earlier remarks made by senior chinese diplomat wang yi who said the meeting was friendly and candid and would help to avoid further trade tensions
all of these help to safeguard china s legitimate interests and are also in the interests of the united states and even more are in line with the expectations of the international community he added in a statement carried on the foreign ministry s website
but global markets have been nervous about the prospects of a trade dispute spilling over to growing rivalry between both sides in areas such as technology and many economists have remained cautious about being too optimistic on a temporary truce
the daughter of huawei s founder is facing extradition to the united states dealing a blow to hopes of an easing of trade tensions and rocking global stock markets
trump also warned this week of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences
hannah anderson global market strategist at jpmorgan asset management said there was a lot of uncertainty over the relationship now as both view each other more as a competitor than a strategic partner in trade and economics
when it comes to the trade policies that have been proposed so far specifically i think we can all expect that there will be further tariff increases on imports of chinese goods whether that s within the window that we are now operating under a pause or outside that window anderson told a small group of reporters in beijing on thursday
