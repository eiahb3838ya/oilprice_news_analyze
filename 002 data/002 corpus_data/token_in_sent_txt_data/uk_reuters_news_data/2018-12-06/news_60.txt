france considers lower electricity tax to stabilise household power prices - sources
paris dec reuters the french government is considering lowering taxes on electricity in order to stabilise household power bills two sources familiar with the situation told reuters on thursday
the government had said this week that it would prevent utility edf s regulated power prices from rising this winter but the firm s competitors immediately said they would challenge that decision in court
earlier government attempts at freezing prices have been overruled
household power prices are set by independent energy regulator cre in a complex formula that includes the price of power generation transport and distribution
a third part of the retail price is made up of taxes
what is being discussed is that the share of taxes in the power price could be reduced in order to compensate for an increase in the generation cost which on balance would keep prices stable said one of the two sources
