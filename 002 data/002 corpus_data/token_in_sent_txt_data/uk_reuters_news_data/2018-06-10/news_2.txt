update 1-merkel: eu will act against u.s. tariffs on steel, aluminium
berlin reuters europe will implement against tariffs on steel and aluminium just like canada german chancellor angela merkel said on sunday voicing regret about president donald trump s abrupt decision to withdraw support for a communique
trump s announcement on twitter after leaving the group of seven summit in canada early that he was backing out of the joint communique torpedoed what appeared to be a fragile consensus on a trade dispute between washington and its top allies
the withdrawal so to speak via tweet is of course sobering and a bit depressing merkel said in an ard television interview following the summit
the summit did not mark the end of the transatlantic partnership between europe and the merkel said
but she repeated that europe could no longer rely on its ally and should take its fate into its own hands
like canada the european union is preparing against tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in line with world trade organisation rules merkel said
so we won t let ourselves be ripped off again and again
instead we act then too merkel said in an unusually combative tone
asked if she was concerned that trump could retaliate against eu by imposing tariffs on cars merkel said first of all we ll try and see if we can prevent this and then hope that the eu will respond again in the same merkel said the leaders had agreed to review their trade ties and assess the scope of existing tariffs in order to avoid further trade barriers
the leader said a area among allies would be an ideal outcome but she made clear that any talks about such a trade bloc would have to include barriers to trade as well as free access to public tenders
turning to russia merkel said she could imagine moscow the format at some point but there first had to be progress in the implementation of the peace plan for ukraine
russia was pushed out of what was then the after it annexed crimea from ukraine in
merkel said she expected italy s new coalition government to vote for the extension of european sanctions against russia
touching the thorny issue of germany s relatively low defence spending merkel acknowledged that trump s criticism was partly correct and that berlin had to do more to reach nato s goal of spending to percent of economic output on defence
trump is in a way right
and that s why we need to increase our defence spending merkel said
