update 1-planned rwe/e.on asset swap lacks clarity - innogy boss
essen germany reuters innogy said on tuesday a proposed deal by parent rwe and rival to break up the german energy group lacked clarity adding it would comment on the transaction once the offer period had officially started
last month rwe and announced the landmark deal to split up innogy s assets between them and turn rwe into a renewables champion while will become europe s largest operator of power and gas grids
as part of the deal will launch a or billion euro billion pounds bid for innogy s minority shareholders with the offer period expected to start at the end of april
that bid does not apply to innogy parent rwe which holds percent of the group following an equity
most of the details however remain open innogy chief executive uwe tigges told shareholders at the group s annual general meeting adding the group s board would issue a reasoned opinion no later than two weeks after the offer period starts
open questions in the transaction include uncertainty over where the brunt of the up to jobs cuts that plans as part of the deal will occur with innogy demanding no forced layoffs at its operations
sees synergies of million euros through the asset swap that will see its renewable operations go to rwe which will get a percent stake in to become its largest shareholder
under the deal innogy would effectively cease to exist once the deal has closed in the second half of only three years after it was split off from rwe and listed separately on the stock exchange
the fact is that as it stands today innogy is an economically independent and strong energy company tigges said
and that is how it will remain until such time as the transaction has been tigges was officially appointed as innogy ceo on tuesday having filled in on an interim basis following the sudden departure of peter terium in december just a week after a profit warning send the group s shares tumbling
