kremlin: we don't regard tumult in armenia as ukraine-style revolution
moscow reuters the kremlin said on tuesday it did not regard political tumult in armenia a close russian ally as a revolution and was pleased that the situation there appeared stable for now
the kremlin was speaking a day after armenian prime minister serzh sarksyan resigned after almost two weeks of mass street protests that plunged the republic into political crisis
for now we see that the situation is not unfolding in a destabilising way which is a cause for satisfaction kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on a conference call
we hope that order and stability will be maintained in the country and that the outlines of a consensus political configuration will appear in the near when asked if the kremlin regarded the events as a revolution peskov said he would not draw parallels with what happened in ukraine in when big protests brought about a change in power that shifted the country away from russia s orbit towards the west
