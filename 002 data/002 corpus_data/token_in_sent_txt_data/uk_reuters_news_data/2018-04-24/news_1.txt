update 2-u.s. environment agency proposes limits to science used in rulemaking
washington reuters the environmental protection agency proposed a rule on tuesday that would limit the kinds of scientific research it can use in crafting regulations an apparent concession to big business that has long requested such restrictions
under the new proposals the epa will no longer be able to rely on scientific research that is underpinned by confidential medical and industry data
the measure was billed by epa administrator scott pruitt as a way to boost transparency for the benefit of the industries his agency regulates
but scientists and former epa officials worry it will hamstring the agency s ability to protect public health by putting key data off limits
the science that we use is going to be transparent it s going to be reproducible pruitt told a gathering at the epa
it s going to be able to be analyzed by those in the marketplace and those that watch what we do can make informed decisions about whether we ve drawn the proper conclusions or not said pruitt who has been pursuing president donald trump s mission to ease the regulatory burden on business
the epa has for decades relied on scientific research that is rooted in confidential medical and industry data as a basis for its air water and chemicals rules
while it publishes enormous amounts of research and data to the public the confidential material is held back
business interests have argued the practice is tantamount to writing laws behind closed doors and unfairly prevents them from vetting the research underpinning the epa s often costly regulatory requirements
they argue that if the data can not be published the rules should not be adopted
but officials say the practice is vital
other government agencies also use studies like these to develop policy and regulations and to buttress and defend rules against legal challenges
they are in fact essential to making sound public policy former epa administrator gina mccarthy and former assistant administrator for air and water janet mccabe wrote in an in the new york times last month
the new policy would be based on proposed legislation spearheaded by the chairman of the house of representatives science committee lamar smith a republican who rejects mainstream climate change science
emails obtained through a public records request last week showed that smith and his staff met with pruitt s staff in recent months to craft the policy
those emails also showed that pruitt s staff grappled with the possibility the policy would complicate the chemicals industry which submits reams of confidential data to epa regulatory programs
pruitt s proposal ensures that data will be secret no more smith said in remarks introducing pruitt at the epa gathering
for too long the epa has issued rules and regulations based on data that has been withheld from the american but a letter signed by scientists on monday said the proposal would greatly weaken the agency s ability to consider all the scientific information needed to form rules and implored pruitt not to go through with the restrictions
the proposal will be open for a comment period and would have to be finalized before entering into force
