armenian politician who forced pm's resignation leads thousands in  march
yerevan april reuters a politician who forced armenia s prime minister to resign led thousands of people on a march on tuesday to mark the anniversary of ottoman turk massacres of armenians in cementing his growing political stature
prime minister serzh sarksyan resigned on monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power
lawmaker nikol pashinyan played an instrumental role in ousting sarksyan organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released
he is set to start talks with the ruling party on wednesday
on tuesday pashinyan led thousands of people through the capital yerevan to a hilltop memorial dedicated to the victims of the massacres
some chanted his name and waved the national flag
armenia say the killings during world war one constituted genocide
turkey accepts that many christian armenians were killed in fighting during the war but denies the killings amounted to genocide
given the anniversary s solemn nature politicians decided to largely refrain from making political statements about the country s future on tuesday
but acting prime minister karen karapetyan an ally of the ousted sarksyan said it was important to stay united amid the political tumult
we are going through a very difficult stage in our new history demonstrating to the entire world that despite difficulties and unresolved problems we are united karapetyan said in a statement after laying flowers at the memorial to the victims of the massacres
we reaffirm our determination to build strong statehood and a free and civilised sarksyan s allies like karapetyan remain in important positions in government and it remains unclear whether his resignation will herald any real change
armenia s political parties in parliament must now put forward the name of a new prime minister within seven days
pashinyan appears keen to play a major role in the political reconfiguration
he has a history of political activism and was among opposition activists who demonstrated against sarksyan s presidential election victory
ten people were killed in clashes that followed that win
after a period of hiding pashinyan surrendered to the police in and was sentenced to four years in prison for organising civil disturbances
he was released two years later under an amnesty
nikol is a really popular leader whom we trust karen mkhitaryan a student said of pashinyan
politicians and experts said on tuesday that sarksyan who was president for a decade before trying to extend his time in power decided to step down due to what they described as unbearable pressure coming from the mass protests
thousands of people were in the streets for days demanding his resignation and the moment came when he had no resources to suppress this movement ararat mirzoyan an opposition leader told reuters
some said sarksyan s move was a rare example of political wisdom from a leader under pressure
serzh sarksyan has confirmed once again that he is a real statesman eduard sharmazanov a vice speaker of parliament told reuters
others praised him for not resorting to a bloody crackdown to stay in power something he had hinted at on sunday
sarksyan was a close ally of russian president vladimir putin and moscow is closely watching events in armenia where it has two military basesy
the kremlin said on tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now
many experts say it is too early to predict what lies ahead however
what is needed is a sober reconfiguration said richard giragosian a director of the regional studies centre
yet such consensus and compromise seems very far away and with mounting expectations and anger dangerously high the real challenge of governance is only just writing by margarita osborn editing by angus macswan
