belarus leader says may loosen grip on power - but not yet
minsk reuters belarussian president alexander lukashenko on tuesday said the constitution could be improved to share some of his powers but not in the near future
lukashenko has run belarus in authoritarian style since during which time he changed the constitution to expand his control and push opposition forces out of parliament
in an annual address to lawmakers that referenced the overthrow of armenia s prime minister lukashenko said he was considering decentralising some of his authority
the constitution will be improved
life changes and we change he said
yes i can easily hand over some powers to other branches of he was speaking a day after armenian prime minister serzh sarksyan resigned after almost two weeks of street protests
lukashenko said he had asked the constitutional court to prepare recommendations on changes to the constitution but cautioned that the plans were theoretical for now
personally i have not even thought about a referendum yet he said referring to the public vote needed to bring any changes into force
seeking to improve ties with the european union and lessen belarus s dependence on russia lukashenko has in recent years heeded calls from the west to show more leniency towards political opposition
he has pardoned several political prisoners while the opposition is represented in parliament for the first time in years following a election that western observers said was not fully democratic but an improvement on previous votes
the opposition in belarus is made up of about a dozen parties and groups that have struggled to popularize their cause in the face of government repression
nevertheless in the biggest public protests in years prompted the authorities to suspend a new tax on those not in employment a rare for lukashenko
citing ukraine s maidan uprising and the political upheaval in armenia lukashenko said any constitutional changes would be carried out in accordance with the law to prevent public outcry and instability
if someone thinks that we will take the constitution and create conditions for our own maidans that won t happen he said
i promised and will never break my vow otherwise it will be like in writing by alessandra prentice editing by matthias williams
