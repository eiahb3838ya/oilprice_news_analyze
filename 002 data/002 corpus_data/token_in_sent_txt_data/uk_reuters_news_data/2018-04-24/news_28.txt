graphic china gasoline exports vs singapore gasoline profit margin by clyde russell launceston australia april reuters china s surging imports of crude oil this year are the major driver of higher prices on the demand side but the flip side to this is soaring chinese fuel exports that are hurting profit margins at regional refiners
the world s largest crude importer took in million barrels per day bpd in the first quarter up percent from the same period in according to customs data
exports of refined products however have jumped by even larger margins with shipments of gasoline and diesel reaching record highs in march according to the data released on monday
gasoline exports were million tonnes in march or about double what they were in the same month last year
in the first quarter china shipped million tonnes of gasoline or about bpd and some percent above the bpd exported in the same period of
diesel exports were million tonnes in march equivalent to about bpd with shipments around bpd in the first quarter a gain of some percent on the period
taking all oil products together shows that china s exports in the first quarter were million bpd up almost percent on million bpd shipped in the same period last year
looking at crude import numbers along with the product exports shows that of the additional bpd of crude oil imported in the first quarter about bpd was exported as additional refined fuels
it appears that this rising supply of oil products from china has weighed somewhat on regional prices especially in gasoline which has witnessed the biggest increase in exports from china
the profit margin or crack on producing a barrel of gasoline from brent crude in singapore the regional benchmark slumped to the lowest in months on april hitting a barrel
it has since recovered somewhat to a barrel as of monday but it s still almost percent below the recent peak of reached in august last year
diesel has fared better with the profit margin in singapore for a barrel of gasoil the term for diesel before retail additives are added ending at on monday
this is slightly higher than the a barrel at the end of last year and also up from the low so far this year of reached in early march
the difference between the gasoline and diesel markets this year is that the region has had to absorb a sharp increase in chinese gasoline exports but not so much of diesel
and now product prices are still high enough to prompt chinese refiners to export refined fuels
the ability of china s refiners to export fuels has been aided by the higher crude import quotas granted this year to smaller independent refiners by the authorities in beijing
there may be some temporary relief for the region s other exporters of refined fuels such as singapore south korea japan and india as some chinese plants enter scheduled maintenance
this should lower the processing rate at chinese refineries which hit a record million bpd in march above the previous high of million bpd in november
what is becoming increasingly clear though is that china is emerging as a major player in the markets for refined fuels in asia especially since the authorities seem ready to allow refiners to import more crude and export surplus products
