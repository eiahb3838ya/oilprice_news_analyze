column-mission accomplished for opec as oil moves from slump to boom: kemp
london reuters the slump that characterised the oil market between the middle of and the middle of has been replaced by what looks like the beginning of a boom
benchmark brent prices have already risen by more than per barrel or percent from their cyclical trough in early
futures prices at almost per barrel are now trading close to the average for the last price cycle which started in and finished in
so far this year futures prices have averaged nearly per barrel which is well above the real average price of
futures prices have shifted from a big contango during the slump into an increasingly wide backwardation since the middle of which is consistent with a shift from to
for a chartbook click here global oil consumption is predicted to increase by more than million barrels per day bpd in the fourth consecutive year of very strong growth
oil production is forecast to increase by million bpd or more this year mostly as a result of a large increase in shale plus other output increases from canada brazil and norway
but with steep declines in output from opec member venezuela as a result of unrest and mismanagement and continued curbs on production by other opec and members global production is failing to keep pace with consumption
oecd inventories have dropped sharply and are now in line with the average eliminating the surplus of over million barrels inherited from the slump
if inventories are adjusted for the rise in consumption which gives a more accurate picture of the market balance stocks are now well below the average and continue to tighten
so on every indicator from spot prices and spreads to consumption production and inventories the oil market is now well into the boom phase of the cycle
but booms are always followed by slumps
if opec allows the oil market to tighten too much in it will create the conditions for the next downturn a few years later
senior opec officials insist the organisation s work on rebalancing the market has not yet been completed and they resist the characterisation of mission accomplished
in particular they point to the relatively low level of investment in exploration and production to justify the need for continued production curbs and even higher prices
but investment is a lagging indicator
investment was slow to pick up during the early stages of the last boom then proved stubbornly resilient in the first stages of the slump
lagging upstream investment is one of the principal causes of cyclical instability in the oil market and has been since the beginning of the modern petroleum industry
if opec members wait for an acceleration of upstream investment before relaxing their production curbs as ministers have indicated they will almost certainly the market in the meantime
the oil market is already tight and the increasingly wide backwardation indicates traders expect it to become even tighter during the second half of the year when oil consumption moves seasonally higher
if opec maintains its current output curbs through december the market is set to become exceptionally tight which will push prices and spreads towards unstable levels
the resulting increase in prices and spreads will accelerate production growth even further and start to restrain consumption growth
opec ministers profess to be unconcerned about the impact on either supply or demand but they have often misjudged market responses in the past
the number of rigs drilling for oil in the united states has already resumed its upward trend over the last three weeks in response to higher prices which will increase shale output even further by the end of
consumption changes are harder to measure in and tend to lag behind changes in oil prices but the rise in prices will restrain demand too as it has always done during every previous period of rising prices
opec members deny that they are principally responsible for the increase in oil prices over the last year or that they should adjust their production policy in response
they can point to unplanned outages in venezuela and other producing nations as well as unexpectedly strong demand from consumers for drawing down inventories faster than they predicted at the end of last year
they can also point to growing concern among traders about the imposition of sanctions on venezuela and of sanctions on iran for accelerating price increases
all these arguments are true
and all these factors are outside opec s control
but production policy is something opec controls directly and for which it is responsible
opec s current production levels were set back in november when the market was heavily oversupplied inventories were rising and prices had only risen modestly from cyclical lows
what was appropriate then is arguably no longer appropriate now
if opec members decide to extend current levels through to the they will probably be held responsible for the price increase likely to follow
president donald trump has already indicated he holds opec responsible for rising oil prices via a message on his twitter account
if oil and fuel prices continue rising the political pushback from consumer countries against opec will only intensify
but what should concern the organisation more is the very real risk that further price increases will prove
by the market in opec will be creating conditions for the next cyclical downturn in
