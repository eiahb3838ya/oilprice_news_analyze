interview-papua new guinea pm says country to launch first eurobond
london april reuters new guinea to sell mln eurobond in will announce lead managers in next weeks papua new guinea lng production to recover to levels by end of month papua new guinea will launch its first eurobond this year as higher energy prices and a recovery in liquefied natural gas production to levels ease strains on its public finances prime minister peter o neill said on tuesday
o neill told reuters on the sidelines of an investment conference in london that lng production would be fully restored by may
we loaded one shipment and production will be in full swing before the end of the month he said
a magnitude quake rocked the country s remote mountainous highlands on killing at least people destroying roads and disrupting lng production papua new guinea s main source of foreign revenue
fiscal pressures were already high as a result of the collapse in oil prices to a barrel in early
gas prices are closely linked to oil
crude markets have since recovered breaking above a barrel for the first time in nearly years on tuesday
that will help make up the revenue shortfall sustained because of the devastating quake o neill said
it certainly will affect the last couple of months we received no revenue because of the earthquake he added
o neill who stayed in london to rustle up investment following last week s meeting of commonwealth leaders also said the country was preparing to launch its debut eurobond
in the next few weeks we will be announcing the lead managers he said adding a shortlist had been drawn up for the planned million bond to be sold before
papua new guinea s total debt stood at percent of gdp of which almost are domestic debt the premier said
in terms of our debt management we are comfortable said o neill adding his country had no plans to talk to the international monetary fund about assistance
but recent pressures have cast a shadow over the economic and fiscal outlook
earlier this year ratings agency s p global lowered the pacific island nation s credit rating to b from while moody s downgraded its outlook to negative from stable
both cited a deteriorating debt profile lower economic growth and rising liquidity risk
once production is fully restored at exxonmobil corp s papua new guinea lng project o neill said there were plans to add three lng trains to the existing two and details would be announced before november s economic cooperation meeting
apart from natural gas the country can also earn foreign export revenue from mining although its panguna mine on the island of bougainville once one of the world s biggest copper mines has been shut since a civil war in
bougainville copper has been working to restart the mine and has contested a decision by the bougainville government to impose an indefinite moratorium
the constitution and the overall legislation from the federal national government is the one that underpins all the other legislation
it s subject to the main laws the prime minister said when asked about the moratorium
he declined to predict the outcome of court deliberations
papua new guinea also hit the headlines over environmental protests because of plans by nautilus minerals to mine the ocean floor
we are reviewing some of the environmental issues
we will continue to engage with nautilus to see how we can mitigate that o neill said
