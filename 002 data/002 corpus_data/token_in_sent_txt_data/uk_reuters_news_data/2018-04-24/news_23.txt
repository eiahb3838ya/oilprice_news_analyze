ebrd says would back poland's electric cars, anti-smog plan
warsaw reuters poland s plan to improve air quality and switch to electric vehicles could be financed with help from the european bank for reconstruction and development a top ebrd official said
poland aims to have million electric cars on its roads by as it seeks to cut emissions in its most polluted towns
it has offered tax and other incentives to make electric cars more accessible and is working on a polish electric car prototype
air quality activist group polski alarm smogowy says cities such as warsaw katowice and krakow are among the dirtiest in europe
we will be delighted to support projects going towards electromobility both in terms of public transport and other projects that could lead to the development of this sector grzegorz zielinski ebrd s poland chief told reuters
he said the ebrd could for example help finance the use of electric buses rather than diesel ones in some polish towns
poland which is highly dependent on coal has not yet requested the money nor specified how much it is budgeting for spending on the project
helping poland become cleaner is one of the key elements of ebrd s new country strategy approved earlier this month
zielinski also said ebrd was ready to provide financing for poland s first offshore wind farms
the two most advanced projects are developed by utility pge and polenergia controlled by the kulczyk family one of the richest in poland
ebrd has helped financed many onshore wind farms in poland in the past but has criticised government policies which have made them unprofitable
in the government unexpectedly banned building wind farms too close to dwellings and imposed a higher property tax on wind farm owners
in its most recent proposal it has withdrawn from the tax though
zielinski said that these regulatory changes for renewables were one of the reasons why many foreign investors have put on hold their investment decisions in poland
the ruling law and justice party pis used to say that coal would remain poland s dominant source of energy for many years and saw renewable energy as unstable
but more recently it has suggested poland needs cleaner sources of energy including nuclear power and offshore wind farms to reduce emissions and meet eu targets
ebrd sees its annual investment in poland in the coming years similar to previous years
it spent million euros in and million euros in
