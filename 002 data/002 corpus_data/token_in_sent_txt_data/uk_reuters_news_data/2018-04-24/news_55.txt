feature-thirsty to thriving? parched pakistani port aims to become a new dubai
gwadar pakistan april thomson reuters foundation for over a decade pakistani officials have dreamed of transforming the small but strategically located fishing port of gwadar into a port and free economic zone pakistan s answer to dubai
the aim is for gwadar located on the arabian sea near iran and the mouth of the persian gulf to become a regional commercial industrial and shipping hub as part of the ambitious china pakistan economic corridor cpec project
the corridor is designed to give china a shorter more secure trading route via pakistan to the middle east and beyond while also boosting pakistan s economy
right now however the dusty next dubai on pakistan s coast resembles the original mainly in one respect it doesn t have much water
it hasn t rained here for the last three years explains a local journalist sajid baloch
abdul rahim who works for the gwadar development authority under the provincial government of balochistan said climate change is playing a role in gwadar s thirst
i would say because of climate change the rains have stopped it used to rain much more often and in every season
now gwadar is facing severe water issues
there is no fresh water here rahim said
nearby akra kaur reservoir dried up two years ago and water must now be brought from a more distant source he said
some of the water coming in is contaminated leading to an increase in waterborne illnesses such as hepatitis he added
tapping groundwater isn t a solution
there is no point in digging wells as the underground water is all brackish rahim said
right now the gwadar peninsula a projection of land into the arabian sea is home to about people following completion of the first phase of the port development
but as development continues the area s population is expected to grow to by according to the port authority s website
on one side of the peninsula is the port built by the chinese china overseas holding company
on the other side lies the local harbour
fishing was gwadar s main economic activity before the port started operations and some local people say they so far see little benefit in the government s grand plans
we are dying from thirst there are no doctors in our hospitals the electricity comes and goes and there is garbage everywhere as no one collects it complained rasool bux a fisherman who lives near the harbour
first fix all these problems
then develop this dream of dubai he urged
bux said most in the town get their water from tankers that make the drive from mirani dam
but the tankers only come once or twice a month to his area bux said and shortages are common
muhammad ali kakar the province s planning and development secretary told a government committee in december that the total demand for water in gwadar city was million gallons a day but tankers supplied only million gallons
to help solve the water shortages two desalination plants have been built in the port with chinese expertise
the smaller can provide gallons of potable water per day to the port while the larger one recently completed in the adjacent zone can supply double that amount
both plants rely on power from generators as there is not enough grid power in gwadar to run them said sajjd baloch the director general of gwadar development authority
some fishermen say they now buy clean drinking water from the port paying up to pakistani rupees around for a can
gul mohammed the operations director for the port authority said his agency was willing to supply clean water outside the port and zone but would need to be paid to produce it
we are willing to provide water from the larger plant to the city of gwadar at the rate of rupees per gallon but the government of balochistan has to sign an agreement with us he said
the provincial government is reluctant to accept the offer hoping for rains this year to fill the akra kaur dam rahim said
the pakistani army tasked with protecting the cpec project meanwhile also has laid the foundation for a large desalination plant to be built with help from the united arab emirates and switzerland
the plant to be completed by july will provide million gallons of water a day free of cost to the inhabitants of gwadar city according to an army press release
providing better services including clean drinking water is seen as a way of helping win local support for the development push and to help quell an ongoing insurgency by baloch separatists in the province
as part of the effort the army also has brought in specialist doctors to supplement those already working at the local hospital
a new road will soon connect the port to the makran coastal highway which links gwadar to karachi
gwadar s new airport will be pakistan s largest when it is complete
the china power company also plans to open a megawatt power plant around miles from the port to provide electricity to gwadar
meanwhile tourism has started too and the port is increasingly bustling with visitors
certainly the security in gwadar has improved considerably in the last two years
i would say that given all the recent development the dream of dubai will be realised in a decade or so said munir ahmed a port security officer
