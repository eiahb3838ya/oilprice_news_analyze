shell, inpex near finish line in race to export north australian lng
singapore reuters shell and inpex are on the final stretch of a race to export gas from offshore northern australia where both have spent billions of dollars building the world s biggest maritime vessels to grab a slice of asia s booming lng market
energy major royal dutch shell and inpex japan s biggest oil and gas producer are vying for first gas from two overlapping fields after delays and cost overruns that have plagued both projects
the pair have spent billions on offshore facilities including shell s metre ft long prelude floating liquefied natural gas unit and inpex s ichthys explorer platform both the world s largest of their class
inpex also has the ichthys explorer a floating lng production and storage unit built in south korea in parallel with shell s prelude
prelude and ichthys are both record breaking that have been competing throughout their development said saul kavonic or energy consultancy wood mackenzie
both arrived on site last year and are about to receive what s known as a cooling cargo of liquefied natural gas lng which indicates a plant is getting closer to starting output
the delivery is used to chill the facilities ahead of regular production of lng which is shipped at a temperature of minus degrees celsius
the race means more than just pride as the prelude and ichthys fields straddle the same gas in the browse basin according to woodmac
their reservoirs are connected meaning whichever project starts producing first will draw some gas away from the other project kavonic said
ship tracking data in thomson reuters eikon shows the gallina lng tanker arrived at prelude in in order to deliver a cooling cargo while the pacific breeze is due to arrive at the ichthys field from malaysia this week
both projects are still preparing for export but shell is grappling with the challenges of commissioning a brand new technology
we currently assume first cargo from ichthys in and from prelude in with risk of further delays said kavonic
a shell spokeswoman reiterated that the oil major expects to get cash flow from prelude in
inpex has said it expects a at ichthys initially due in in april or may
there is no change to the schedule that we announced in march inpex spokesman carlo niederberger told reuters
although both projects feed from the browse basin inpex said it was not yet certain whether there would be direct competition for gas between the two fields
map ichthys and prelude gas fields off northwest australia prelude which will produce process and export lng came at a cost of more than billion several years late and billions of dollars over initial estimates
prelude is expected to have an annual lng production capacity of million tonnes making it the smallest but most challenging australian lng project in recent years
ichthys will send gas onshore to darwin through an mile pipeline where it will be processed into lng for export
once completed the billion project will have an annual lng capacity estimated at nearly million tonnes
both prelude and ichthys will also produce condensate an form of crude oil as well as liquefied petroleum gas lpg
exports from new lng projects including ichthys and prelude are expected to help australia overtake qatar to become the world s largest lng exporter by the end of the decade
