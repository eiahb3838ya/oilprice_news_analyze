update 1-opec likely to reject iran request for discussion of u.s. sanctions
dubai reuters opec is likely to reject a request by iran to discuss sanctions against tehran at this month s meeting of the oil producer group a source familiar with the matter told reuters
iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili asked the chairman of the opec board to include a sanctions debate in the agenda for the june talks according to a copy of kazempour s letter dated june and seen by reuters
last month iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh asked opec to support it against new sanctions and signalled tehran disagreed with saudi arabia s views on the possible need to increase global oil supplies
i would like to seek opec s support in accordance with article of the opec statute which emphasises safeguarding the interests of member countries individually and collectively zanganeh wrote last month in a letter to his united arab emirates counterpart who holds the opec presidency in
president donald trump last month pulled out of an international nuclear deal with iran announcing the highest level of sanctions against the opec member
iran is the oil producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries after saudi arabia and iraq
oil ministers from opec will be meeting at the group s vienna headquarters to discuss output policy
kazempour citing zanganeh s letter asked the board to include in the june talks an agenda item titled opec ministerial conference support to the member countries that are under illegal unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions
the source said that after receiving kazempour s request the uae s opec governor ahmed sought the advice of legal counsel
the counsel responded negatively to iran s plea the source said on the grounds that the ministerial agenda could not be amended because it had been finalised
earlier on friday kazempour said a request for saudi arabia to pump more oil so that it could cover a drop in iranian exports and ease a rise oil prices was crazy and astonishing and said opec would not heed the appeal
consumers are now acting to use oil as a political weapon and yet blaming us of fixing oil prices
such an upside down world kazempour told reuters
