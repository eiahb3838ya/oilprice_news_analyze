exclusive-iran slams u.s. for seeking saudi oil output hike, says opec won’t comply
london reuters iran said on friday a request for saudi arabia to pump more oil so that it could cover a drop in iranian exports was crazy and astonishing and said opec would not heed the appeal setting the stage for a tough opec meeting this month
iran saudi arabia s has a history of raising challenges in opec meetings
in tehran refused to sign up to opec policies saying it needed to hike output due to the easing of sanctions after a nuclear accord with world powers
president donald trump pulled out of that nuclear deal last month and announced the highest level of sanctions against iran the biggest producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries after saudi arabia and iraq
it s crazy and astonishing to see instruction coming from washington to saudi to act and replace a shortfall of iran s export due to their illegal sanction on iran and venezuela iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters
president donald trump said in april oil prices were artificially high because of opec
the government had also unofficially asked saudi arabia and some other opec producers to raise output a day before washington slapped new sanctions on tehran
in the previous round of sanctions against tehran in which the european union had taken part iranian oil exports plummeted by more than half to below million barrels per day
the eu is not planning to join sanctions this time and has called on the united states to give its companies waivers so they can continue doing business with tehran
but many european companies are already severing ties with tehran for fear of facing secondary sanctions from the united states which could mean losing access to the dollar clearing system
the sanctions on iran s petroleum industry will take effect after a period ending on but many european refiners are already winding down iranian oil purchases
iran has called on opec to discuss what it called illegal sanctions at the next meeting on june which is due to debate production policies
opec and its allies led by russia have cut a combined million barrels per day of output since january and the cuts are due to expire at the end of
however saudi arabia and russia have said cuts could be eased after receiving calls from consumers including the united states china and india to support global demand
iran s kazempour predicted opec would not heed the request and said oil prices would jump in response to washington s sanctions on iran and venezuela as they did during a previous round of sanctions against iran
no one in opec will act against two of its founder members he said
the tried it last time against iran but oil prices got to a opec founded in has a history of collaboration over oil policy despite differences of opinion and even wars between some members over the said the group would unite in opposition to the request
opec will not accept such a humiliation
how arrogant and ignorant one could be to underestimate the history of years cooperation among competitors he we have to live together we can not change geography but we must build better history he said
