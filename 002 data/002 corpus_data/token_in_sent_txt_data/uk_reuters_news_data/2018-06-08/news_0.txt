main customer of arizona coal plant goes green, ignoring interior dept
washington reuters the main buyer of electricity from an arizona coal plant on the verge of closure said on friday it will instead source its electricity largely from a solar power project ignoring an appeal by the
interior department to buy more power from the plant to keep it open
the trump administration has been waging a broad effort to keep aging coal and nuclear plants from retirement arguing that their closure would constitute a threat to national energy security
on friday the board of the central arizona project cap a major electricity consumer that supplies water to a large swath of arizona voted to sign a agreement to buy power from a solar project and also agreed to a power deal with utility salt river project for electricity from a variety of sources
the vote came despite a plea from the head of interior s bureau of reclamation who last friday wrote to board members to say that a law gives interior secretary ryan zinke power to require the cap to buy energy from the navajo generating station or ngs a power plant that is scheduled to close in
with the act in mind the department expects to consider several options going forward including the feasibility of continued use of power the letter from assistant secretary for water and science timothy petty said
such a move would have delayed the plant s closure
but cap officials disputed the assertion that they were required to buy power from the navajo coal plant which is closing due to competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy
cap is not required by law to buy ngs power
cap seeks a reliable and diverse power portfolio for the benefit of its water users lisa atkins president of the central arizona water conservation district was quoted as saying in the arizona republic newspaper
a representative of the water organization was not immediately available for comment
despite the water project board s decision the interior department said it will continue to find ways to keep the navajo generation station open
the department of the interior is committed to seek a economically viable operation plan for ngs said spokesman dan dubray
interior s activities with myriad ngs stakeholders including our discussions with the navajo nation the hopi tribe and the multiple tribes which rely on cap water are ongoing and productive he said
