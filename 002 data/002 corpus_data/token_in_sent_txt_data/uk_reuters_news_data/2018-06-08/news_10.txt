berlin reuters volkswagen said production of up to cars from its group brands in the second half will be delayed because of effects from new mandatory lab tests for emissions and fuel economy
implementation of the worldwide harmonized light duty vehicles test procedure wltp on for new cars will temporarily restrict the availability of some models and could affect working capital by driving up inventories volkswagen vw said on friday without being more specific
carmakers are facing bottlenecks as they rush to get models through the more complex wltp tests on a limited number of exhaust emissions test benches as they won t be able to sell new vehicles after without the new carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption readings
because of the introduction of the new wltp testing procedure we expect in the second half of an effect at the vw group of around to vehicles that we will build later than originally planned vw said
although effects on sales can not be ruled out from the launch of wltp which replaces the outdated new european driving cycle nedc and aims to better reflect data vw on friday reaffirmed its goal for group deliveries to moderately exceed last year s record million units
we are working at high pressure on further measures to keep the effects on our production as low as possible vw said
porsche the contributor to vw group profit said last week it would temporarily limit the number of models it sells in europe because of the implications of wltp
vw had no comment on potential costs from the disruptions
citing unnamed sources at vw german magazine der spiegel on friday reported that the risk for vw could run into billions as the bottlenecks mean a number of cars could hit dealerships late or not at all
