chinese nuclear plant developer will not seek uk state investment
london reuters a planned nuclear plant to the east of london will not require state investment the chinese company building it said after the british government was criticized for helping another project
it is not our plan to seek direct investment from the uk government for bradwell b robert davies chief operating officer of cgn uk a uk subsidiary of china s general nuclear power corporation cgn told reuters
after saying it did not want to directly invest in new nuclear plants britain s government made a this week saying it could take a stake in hitachi s near billion wlyfa project in wales cgn s davies said it was too early to discuss funding in detail but but the fact that the firm said it will not need such direct investment shows it is confident of funding the project itself or being able to raise the cash
the british government also faced protests over its decision to offer a guaranteed power price to the hinkley point project being built by france s edf britain s first new nuclear plant in more than twenty years
britain says it needs a new fleet of nuclear plants to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors set to close in the as well as to cut the country s carbon emissions
but large new nuclear power plants costing several billion pounds have struggled to secure financing with the cost of lending higher than traditional infrastructure projects due to concerns over future potential liabilities
this raised the possibility that it would also need to provide similar assistance for other new plants to be built
hinkley got the final from edf s board in after several years of delay and only after securing backing from the french government
when announcing the possible hitachi deal britain s business minister greg clark said it hoped future nuclear projects should be financed by the private hinkley was also awarded a subsidy minimum price guarantee from the british government of almost double current electricity prices which the national audit office said could cost consumers billion pounds billion
davies said cgn s bradwell project would expect a much lower minimum guarantee price
we know we have to get within a realistic range of the cost of offshore wind he said
some offshore wind projects were awarded a minimum price as low as per megawatt hour mwh in the latest round of subsidies compared with the pounds per mwh guaranteed for hinkley
cgn owns a third of edf s hinkley project and will also help it develop another new plant in suffolk sizewell the chinese company will also lead construction of the plant in bradwell essex using a nuclear reactor which needs to gain approval from britain s nuclear regulator
we expect to complete the second phase of the gda generic design approval by the end of the year and final approval by the end of
the target is for the final investment decision to be made shortly after that davies said
the hpr nuclear reactor cgn plans to use at bradwell is capable of generating megawatts mw but no decision has been made yet about how many reactors would be deployed
