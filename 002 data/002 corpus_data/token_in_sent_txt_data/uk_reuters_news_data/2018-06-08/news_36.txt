update 5-venezuela's pdvsa transfers oil at sea despite customer qualms
fijo venezuela reuters venezuela has begun testing seaborne oil transfers to ease a severe backlog of crude deliveries from its main terminals according to sources and data as chronic delays and production declines could temporarily halt pdvsa s supply contracts if they are not cleared soon
the company has told some customers it may declare force majeure allowing it to temporarily suspend export contracts if they do not accept new delivery terms including seaborne transfers
the delivery method entails specialized equipment and training and higher costs for ship owners and customers
but pdvsa is pushing ahead over customer doubts given the congestion at its ports and need to complete sales that are the lifeblood of the opec member
tankers waiting to load more than million barrels of crude almost as much as pdvsa shipped in april are sitting off jose the country s main oil port according to the data
pdvsa did not reply to requests for comment
the delays helped push up brent crude oil prices on thursday
brent rose percent to settle at per barrel
the tanker sonangol kalandula bound for a thailand company s refinery in kemaman malaysia was loaded this week with venezuelan heavy crude using a sts transfer the first test of how pdvsa expects to ease congestion at its ports
the vessel which has not yet set sail had been waiting since february to load according to thomson reuters vessel tracking data
the cargo s owner tipco asphalt did not reply to a request for comment
as of thursday more than tankers were waiting in venezuelan waters half of them to load crude and refined products for exports according to the data
graphic on pdvsa oil export delays the delays have mounted since may when asset seizures forced pdvsa to stop using caribbean facilities for storing and loading export cargoes
but pdvsa s noncompliance with oil supply contracts started months ago as production declines accelerated according to internal company documents
in april pdvsa shipped million barrels per day bpd of crude and fuels to its customers bpd below the million contracted according to the documents
customers waiting for cargoes with tankers already at sea include chevron corp and valero energy corp india s nayara energy and china s cnpc and its trading unit petrochina co ltd
pdvsa customers including chevron declined to comment on the new terms
nayara energy valero energy and units of cnpc which each had vessels awaiting loadings on thursday did not reply to a request for comment
a senior chinese official with direct knowledge of the issue said the venezuela side has requested for sts operations and also agreed to bear the additional but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he had doubts over whether pdvsa could deliver on time and who would be given priority
another buyer of venezuelan oil said chances were slim that any customer would contest force majeure choosing instead to negotiate differences in pricing because of the transfer costs involved
venezuela s crude exports fell percent in may to million bpd following conocophillips legal actions to seize pdvsa s assets in four caribbean islands according to reuters data
venezuela s crude exports in the first five months of were percent lower than in the same period of
the lack of export and storage terminals especially those with docks to load large vessels bound for asia has forced pdvsa to divert tankers to venezuela in recent weeks
the measure also has been taken to avoid further cargo seizures after conoco won temporary court orders retaining two vessels near aruba last month
the company s proposed sts transfer solution to be performed in waters miles km from venezuela s cardon refinery faces a reluctant reception among oil buyers according to shippers and traders
a sts operation adds at least per barrel to the purchase cost
the question is who will take responsibility for that said robert campbell head of oil products markets at consultancy energy aspects
the price of venezuela s merey crude the main grade exported from jose port rose to per barrel in april
insurance coverage for tankers and cargoes would also have to be changed to include the sts operation if customers accept the option campbell said
