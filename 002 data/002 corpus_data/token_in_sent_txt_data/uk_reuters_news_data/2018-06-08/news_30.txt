update 2-rivers of lava destroy 600 homes on hawaii's big island - mayor
pahoa hawaii reuters approximately homes have been swallowed by lava flows from kilauea volcano on hawaii s big island since early last month marking its most destructive eruption in modern times hawaii county mayor harry kim said on thursday
the latest estimate of property losses from kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes far surpasses the structures consumed by lava during an earlier eruption cycle that began in and continued nearly nonstop over three decades
kim said kilauea one of five volcanoes on the big island formally known as the island of hawaii has never destroyed so many homes before in such a short period of time
the latest volcanic eruption which entered its day on thursday stands as the most destructive in the united states since at least the cataclysmic eruption of mount helens in washington state that reduced hundreds of square miles to wasteland according to geologist scott rowland a volcano specialist from the university of hawaii at manoa
a similar extremely violent eruption from fuego volcano in guatemala this week killed more than people as it ejected deadly pyroclastic flows of lava and ash through nearby towns
the latest damage appraisal from kilauea came moments after governor david ige on a visit to hawaii county civil defense headquarters in hilo the island s biggest city signed a memorandum of understanding furnishing million in immediate state disaster relief to the island
ige and kim also announced formation of a task force of federal state and local officials to devise a recovery plan for communities devastated by the eruption with an eye toward preventing such major property losses in the future
our responsibility is to try to work with the community to rebuild out of harm s way kim said
county civil defence officials had a day earlier put the confirmed number of homes destroyed during the past month at all of them in and around the leilani estates community where fissures opened up on the volcano s eastern flank on may
more recently a huge river of lava that has crept several miles across the landscape to the eastern tip of the island engulfed two entire seaside housing subdivisions kapoho beach lots and vacationland
over the course of about three days a rolling wall of molten rock measuring across and to tall buried hundreds of homes while vaporizing a small freshwater lake and filling in an inlet called kapoho bay extending about a mile out from what had been the shoreline
kim said vacationland a private development believed to comprise roughly homes was completely erased and that at least houses were devoured by lava at kapoho beach lots
the rest were the rest of the losses have occurred in the leilani estates area where the toll of destruction has been steadily rising by the day
so if you combine the three of them kapoho vacationland and leilani we re talking about homes he told reporters
i m talking about families
don t forget the farmers don t forget the ranchers don t forget all the employees for an estimated people have been displaced by evacuations across the island since the eruption began five weeks ago spouting fountains of lava and high concentrations of toxic sulphur dioxide gas through about two dozen volcanic fissures at the foot of the volcano
plumes of volcanic ash belched into the air by periodic daily explosions from the crater at kilauea s summit have posed an additional nuisance and health hazard to nearby communities
so too have airborne volcanic glass fibres called peel s hair wispy strands carried aloft by the wind from lava fountains and named for the volcanic goddess of hawaiian myth
seaside residents and boaters also have been warned to avoid noxious clouds of laze a term derived from the words lava and haze formed when lava reacts with seawater to form a mix of acid fumes steam and particles when it flows into the ocean
frequent earthquakes mostly of relatively small magnitude but numbering in the thousands have persisted throughout the eruption adding to the jitters of residents living closest to the volcano
in addition to destroying homes and other structures lava flows have knocked out telephone and power lines causing widespread communication outages and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant that normally provides about a quarter of the island s electricity
