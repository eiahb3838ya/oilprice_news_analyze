rising u.s. shale exports turn wti into 24-hour benchmark -cme
geneva oct reuters rising crude oil exports to europe and asia have had a effect in the futures market turning the west texas intermediate contract into a hour benchmark exchange operator cme group said
owain johnson managing director for energy research and development at cme said the shift has also led cme to introduce the first change to the quality of wti crude since coming into force from january next year
ten to percent of our daily volumes are trading in european and asian hours names that we never came across are now regulars
south korea and china are the trading community on wti johnson said at the argus global crude conference in geneva switzerland
you re getting a benchmark
the more liquidity on futures the more liquidity on the options
options are really starting to trade in depth and in euro and asian the cme shuts down for one hour every day for maintenance
johnson said he sees a trend in which the biggest benchmarks are going global while smaller ones are withering away
shale and heavy canadian crudes have had a major impact on the quality of crude for export
after refiners complained about blended grades dubbed the cme announced last year that five new tests would be conducted to ensure quality consistency
the tests are being introduced gradually and the industry must comply with them fully by january next year
we wanted to ensure that the barrel at cushing is a clean barrel that does not have too much blended canadian material in it he said referring to the traditional hub for wti in cushing oklahoma
the changes have already largely been adopted and priced in ahead of the official shift in january he said
the cme has been launching new oil contracts for new crude grades as spreads to wti that have been picked up quickly by the market johnson said
they are some of the launches
new derivatives are very liquid for new grades
it s trading very aggressively mainly through brokers and they re popular with asian and european importers he said
furthermore as the significance of landlocked cushing wanes as a hub the global exchanges are racing to introduce new contracts out of houston
on the cme will launch a deliverable contract called wti houston based off three terminals on the gulf coast
rival intercontinental exchange announced a similar delivered contract in july
