management and advisers are examining how power grids could be separated from the rest of abb s business which runs from industrial robots to power transmission equipment before the swiss company s board makes a decision
the price will be decisive
if a sale creates no value for abb there will be no deal the source added
spiesshofer in october rejected calls from cevian capital abb s shareholder to separate power grids which sells equipment like substations and transformers to utilities
cevian had argued that the unit lacked synergies with the rest of abb s business and that the company s conglomerate structure made it too complex to run efficiently
since then power grids has only slightly improved its performance
its relatively low profitability compared to other divisions has weighed on abb s share price which recently fell to its lowest level since december
the company s share price remains far short of the swiss francs which spiesshofer said could be possible if the company retained power grids and the level which cevian said could be achieved by abb and a separate listing of power grids together
it s been almost two years since the unfavourable decision to keep power grids and the share price has developed miserably christer gardell managing director of cevian told swedish daily dagens industri in august
abb must stop with explanations and whitewashes now they simply have to deliver shareholder spiesshofer who has led abb since september hinted this year at a possible separation when he said abb s current organisation was not cast in stone
power grids employs people and had sales of billion last year
it had an operating profit margin of percent during the second quarter a decline of basis points from a year earlier and outside its target range of to percent
if a deal is approved abb could concentrate on more profitable areas like electrification and automation

infrastructure funds which normally invest in public assets like toll roads and airports are interested in acquiring a stake in power grids while industrial companies including possible bidders from asia could also enter the bidding a second source said
abb had been in discussions with china s state grid on the unit in the past but no deal ever materialised another source said
