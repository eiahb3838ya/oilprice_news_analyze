refiners in turkey india and possibly china are reportedly negotiating with officials over waivers to enable them to continue purchasing at least some iranian oil after
at the same time saudi arabia and other gulf producers have boosted their exports in response to the earlier rise in prices and pressure from the united states to cool the market
traders meanwhile have become more cautious about the consumption outlook for the rest of with most indicators pointing to a loss of economic momentum outside the united states
graphic as a result most major forecasters are now predicting a significant acceleration in oil supplies in as well as slower growth in consumption shifting the outlook from one of continuing deficits back towards a surplus
in part the improved supply picture has come about because the surge in oil prices during august and september forced both the white house and saudi arabia to adapt their positions
