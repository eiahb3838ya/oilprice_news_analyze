petroleum minister ghulam sarwar khan said the government of ousted premier nawaz sharif agreed to pay too much to pakistan s engro corp ltd for at least one of the terminals
the decision is that this will be renegotiated with the parties khan told reporters on thursday
engro did not address the prospect of renegotiation in a statement late on thursday
it responded to the minister s suggestion of impropriety by saying the bidding for the contract was done in an auditable and transparent manner adding that lng imports helped ease pakistan s crippling electricity shortages

engro pakistan s largest listed conglomerate built the country s first lng terminal in and has said it will begin building another one starting in early

we will renegotiate with them will sit with them will talk with them and if it doesn t work then there are other remedies which will be considered he said
