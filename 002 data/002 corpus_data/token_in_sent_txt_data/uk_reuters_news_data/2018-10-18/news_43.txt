focus-exxon mobil bets big on china lng, sidesteps trade war
oct reuters in the middle of a trade war the world s largest publicly traded oil and gas company is turning toward beijing for business at a time when most of corporate america is looking elsewhere to avoid the threat of tariffs
exxon mobil corp is placing big bets on china s soaring liquefied natural gas lng demand coupling dollar production projects around the world with its first mainland storage and distribution outlet
its gas strategy is moving on two tracks expanding output of the gas in places such as papua new guinea and mozambique and creating demand for those supplies in china by opening exxon s first import and storage hub according to an exxon manager and people briefed on the company s plans
that combination will guarantee us a steady outlet for lots of our lng for decades said the exxon manager who was not authorized to discuss the project and spoke on condition of anonymity
one of the company s top policy goals this year the manager said is building its chinese client roster
china s natural gas demand is rising really fast with imports soaring well over percent annually at the moment because of the government gasification program and due to fast rising industrial demand including in petrochemicals the exxon manager said
for a graphic click an exxon spokesperson declined to provide an executive to discuss the company s lng investments in china
years in the making the strategy delivers an added benefit helping exxon sidestep a global trade war
exxon s massive lng projects in papua new guinea and mozambique will not incur the percent tariff china put on gas as part of the trade war between the trump administration and beijing
jason feer head of business intelligence at lng tanker brokers poten partners which tracks lng sales said the deal provides a sign that china is willing to let foreign interests invest in things that in the past were seen as exxon is among the top ranked companies that are pushing ahead in china despite the trade dispute but it is not alone
and european car makers are opening or expanding china plants to avoid hefty tariffs and transport costs
tesla inc this month acquired a shanghai site for a car and complex
exxon s asian and african lng will offer a cost advantage over rivals exports that face tariffs and greater transport while china s support for the project offers a rebuttal to trump administration complaints about the country s closed markets
the decision to expand its lng production and open an import terminal in the world s fastest growing lng market is a step by exxon chief executive darren woods to pull the company out of an earnings rut that has left its shares flat over the past seven years
woods appeared holding discussions with chinese premier li keqiang on media last month days after disclosing local approvals for the lng terminal and a massive chemical project in guangdong province
since becoming ceo last year woods has pushed exxon to take greater risks including in energy trading operations
his timing with lng is key
next year china will become the world s largest importer of natural gas and its lng imports are forecast to rise percent by from million tonnes last year estimates beijing consultancy sia energy
exxon has not publicly named its partner in the import terminal
power company guangdong yuedian group said on its website it will join the project
bp plc is the only other foreign oil major with a stake in a chinese lng terminal
yuedian did not respond to a request for comment
the dollar bets still faces risks from the trade dispute
china has vowed to respond to any new tariffs by the trump administration which recently accused china of meddling in november elections and trying to recruit americans to spy for it
but it remains unclear what that response will be and if it puts agreements like exxon s in china in jeopardy
in addition to the lng terminal exxon received approval for its first chemical plant in china becoming one of two foreign firms including germany s basf to gain approval to operate such plants without a local sponsor
the terminal and chemicals plants combined will cost about billion to build consultancy ihs markit estimates
for a graphic click china in embarked on a huge program to shift millions of households and factories from coal to natural gas for power and heating a move to clear the smoggy skies over its cities
that surge has injected new life into an lng industry that suffered from plunging prices between and which forced energy companies to put off liquefaction projects
but with prices for lng rising this year major producers have boosted investment
in addition to exxon royal dutch shell plc this month gave the to a billion lng canada project that will export fuel primarily to china
major independent oil companies such as exxon aim for tier one positions and in the lng game that is qatar east africa and possibly some north american and papua new guinea projects said saul kavonic oil and gas researcher for credit suisse in sydney australia
exxon and other lng producers also are adapting to changing buyer behavior
in the past lng was dominated by supply contracts especially with japanese and south korean buyers that could span several decades and in which buyer and seller agree to a fixed monthly volume at a set price formula usually priced off crude oil
that is changing in part because china s importers either demand more contract flexibility or simply buy lng at in the spot market whenever they need it
the shift away from such rigid deals is forcing producers to trade new lng supplies and give import terminals a larger role in encouraging spot purchases
lng players are increasingly adopting an lng portfolio model whereby supply projects are not directly linked to end customers with over percent of contracts now coming from portfolio suppliers rather than specific projects said credit suisse s kavonic
