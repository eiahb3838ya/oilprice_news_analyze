column-u.s. energy exports to china plummet as trump trade war bites: russell
launceston australia reuters it s probably not the kind of success president donald trump had in mind but his trade dispute with china has effectively killed off the burgeoning energy trade between the world s two biggest economies
china s imports of crude oil liquefied natural gas lng and coal have slowed to a trickle amid the escalating tariff war
perhaps the irony of the collapse in china s energy imports from the united states was that this was the area most likely to deliver trump s lowering of the trade deficit between the pair
if china had continued to buy increasing volumes of crude lng and coal this would have been far more effective at lowering the trade deficit than trump s chosen path of imposing tariffs on billion of imports from china
crude oil imports from the united states are expected to have dropped to zero in october according to and port data compiled by refinitiv
this is despite crude oil not being on the list of billion of imports from the united states that china has now subjected to tariffs
a single cargo of million barrels of crude is headed to china from the gulf coast and is scheduled to arrive in november according to the data
china s imports of crude peaked in june this year when almost million barrels or about barrels per day bpd arrived
in the first nine months of this year china imported about bpd from the united states representing about percent of its total crude imports
similar to crude no cargoes of lng are scheduled to arrive in china in october although one vessel from the sabine pass lng facility in louisiana is slated to arrive in november
in the first nine months of the year ships delivered a total of million tonnes of lng from the united states to china representing about percent of total imports according to the data
graphic exports to china were about percent of total shipments of lng in the first nine months of the year
as the trade dispute with china escalated lng exports appear to have slipped with the million tonnes shipped in september and the million tonnes in august being the two weakest months this year behind april s million tonnes
turning to coal it s largely the same story as for crude and lng with exports to china plummeting after growing strongly over the past two years
no coal is scheduled to arrive in china this month although three ships are due in november with one of the cargoes being petcoke according to the data
coal exports to china have mainly been coking coal used in although a number of ships carrying thermal coal used in power stations have been tracked this year
china imported million tonnes of coal in the first nine months of the year representing just percent of the country s total imports but a somewhat larger percent share of exports
in all three energy products china is a bigger share of exports than the united states is of chinese imports
this suggests that china may well find it easier to source alternative supplies than producers will find other buyers
the speed at which energy exports to china have gone from hero to zero may also be surprising especially since the tariffs on coal and lng were only recently imposed and crude is still
this may make it tempting to think that china will be able to rapidly ramp up imports of energy should the trade dispute be resolved
but the risk for energy exporters is that markets once lost are difficult to recover especially if your customer has readily available alternative sources of supply
