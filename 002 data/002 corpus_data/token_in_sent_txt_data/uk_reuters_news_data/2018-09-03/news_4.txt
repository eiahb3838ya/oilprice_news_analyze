austria plans to appeal eu ruling on uk's hinkley point nuclear plant
vienna sept reuters austria plans to appeal against a ruling by europe s court which rejected its objections to britain s plans for a nuclear power plant at hinkley point the country s sustainability minister said on monday
our lawyers have examined this in detail in the past weeks
we believe the chances of an appeal remain intact sustainability minister elisabeth koestinger said in an interview with newspaper kronen zeitung
the ministry said it expects austria s cabinet to formally give the for an appeal when it meets on wednesday
french utility edf and china general nuclear power corp aim to have the hinkley point c nuclear power station on line in with costs for the project seen at billion pounds billion
the european commission cleared the project in saying it did not see any competition issues
but austria took its objections to the general court in luxembourg which dismissed them in july
one aspect vienna objects to is a guaranteed price for electricity from the plant which is higher than market rates
it also opposes state credit guarantees of up to billion pounds being provided for the project
austria can appeal to the european court of justice but only on matters of law
opposition to nuclear power is widespread in austria which built a nuclear reactor but never brought it on line
voters rejected plans to bring it into operation in a referendum in and the reactor at zwentendorf on the danube northwest of vienna now serves as a training centre
