rpt-japan's nuclear reboot gathers pace, set to curtail lng demand
repeats story from for wider readership with no change to text
by osamu tsukimori and aaron sheldrick tokyo aug reuters japan s consumption of liquefied natural gas lng is set to fall as the country s nuclear reactors restart with output from atomic power set for its highest since the aftermath of the fukushima disaster
kansai electric power will restart the mw no
reactor at its takahama station later on friday a spokesman told reuters
the kansai restart followed kyushu electric power bringing back the no
reactor at its sendai plant on wednesday
kyushu now has four reactors running
each returning reactor will cut demand for lng by as much as million tonnes a year said kosho tamura a gas analyst at japan oil gas and metals national corp
the return of japan s nuclear capacity should lead to lower imports of fossil fuels especially lng
while that is a positive for japan s utilities especially as lng prices are near highs in asia the loss of japanese demand could undermine the demand outlook for the global market
japan is the world s biggest buyer of lng
it s a good thing that the power utilities in western japan have restarted nuclear plants which is leading to the cuts in fossil fuel costs primarily lng through the continued operations of nuclear plants said tomoko murakami manager of the nuclear energy group at the institute of energy economics japan ieej
kansai is japan s utility by sales and was the most reliant on nuclear power before the march fukushima disaster when a nuclear power plant owned by tokyo electric power suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami
before the disaster japan had the world s reactor fleet which provided about of its electricity
but the plants were shut down for relicensing after fukushima highlighted regulatory failings
kansai will have three units operating and expects to have another reactor at takahama restarted in november after shutting it down earlier this month for maintenance and refuelling its spokesman said
those three units will save about billion in fuel costs each year they are running the kansai spokesman said declining to comment on what fuels it would substitute
operating kyushu s nuclear units will save the company about billion in annual costs based on current lng prices its spokeswoman said
with two more reactors likely to restart by the end of the year when japan enters its peak demand period as much as million tonnes of lng demand could be replaced by nuclear operations
the country s use of lng in power generation has been declining this year as more reactors return
in june lng imports fell to the lowest monthly amount since may and for the year through to july are down percent
the fukushima disaster sparked the country s worst energy crisis in the period forcing it to import record amounts of lng and driving prices to record highs
utilities also turned to cheaper coal imports
