syria's aleppo expects iran power boost soon
aleppo syria reuters the power supply in syria s aleppo will be boosted this year thanks to new capacity installed by its ally iran a step towards reviving the industrial hub whose electricity grid has been destroyed in seven years of war a syrian official said
the five power generation plants are part of a deal penned last year by which iran a vital supporter of president bashar will help repair the syrian power grid and reflects tehran s deepening role in the country
syrian government forces with critical help from militias and the russian air force recovered full control of aleppo some months ago driving out rebels who had held the city s eastern districts
mohammed the director general of the aleppo power company said all of the city s power generation capacity amounting to megawatts had been destroyed in the conflict that erupted in
he said the new capacity being installed by iran at a cost of million euros would produce megawatts once it comes on line at some point between april and june
other sources will enter service to feed aleppo city and so the hours of provision will certainly increase after april said saleh speaking to reuters as he inspected work to restore the power supply to one part of the city
industrialists have cited power supply as one of the big impediments to reviving their businesses in aleppo a city which enjoyed electricity before the war
power provision today ranges between and hours a day in parts of the city where there is electricity said saleh
but some parts of the city specifically areas that were under rebel control have yet to be reconnected to the power grid he said
the government aimed to restore electricity to those areas this year
there is cooperation from our iranian and russian friends in the power sector he said when asked how the government plans to restore power to those areas
western states some of which have backed the opposition have said they will not help rebuild syria until a political transition is in place
the syrian government hopes china will help it rebuild in addition to iran and russia
while assad continues to recover territory from rebels the main highway linking aleppo to other cities such as hama homs latakia and damascus still runs through territory held by insurgents rendering it insecure
that forced the government last year to extend new power lines out into the desert along a circuitous but secure road to aleppo
more than towers were put up along the road saleh said
he also said that state engineers were fixing the power grid in kurdish districts of aleppo city that were recently restored to state control after kurdish militias withdrew
