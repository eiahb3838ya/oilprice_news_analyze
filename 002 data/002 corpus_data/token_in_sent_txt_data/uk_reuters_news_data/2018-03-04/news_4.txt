global markets-dollar slips on trade war fears, euro bounces after italian exit polls

also helping the euro was the revival of germany s grand coalition over the weekend meaning chancellor angela merkel s conservatives will form a new government more than five months since the country s inconclusive election
the euro also got a bit of a lift from flows as risk sentiment soured after president donald trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium rattling financial markets last week
the dollar fell for a fourth straight session to go as deep as yen but was slightly above friday s low of a level not seen since november
still wall street rebounded late on friday as investors who were initially spooked by the prospect of a global trade war clung to hopes that trump was just rattling sabres as a negotiating tactic
news over the weekend suggested however that trump was going ahead with his plan while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs
canada and mexico have threatened retaliation and the european union said it would apply percent tariffs on about billion of imports from the united states if trump carried out his threat
trump says the tariffs are needed to protect domestic industries against unfair competition from china and elsewhere
