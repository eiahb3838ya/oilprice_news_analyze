vietnam seeks to pacify china as landmark u.s. carrier visit signals warming ties
hong reuters the visit of a aircraft carrier to vietnam for the first time since the end of the vietnam war is a powerful symbol of the growing strategic ties between the former foes
but the arrival on monday of the uss carl vinson also illustrates hanoi s complex and evolving relationship with beijing over the disputed south china sea
for months now vietnamese envoys have been working to ease the concerns of their giant chinese neighbour over the visit and the prospect of broader security between hanoi and washington according to diplomats and others familiar with discussions
vietnamese diplomats and military officers have repeatedly stressed the country s independent foreign policy and its desire for broad foreign relations hoping to maintain stable ties with china while standing up to it over the south china sea the sources said
the vinson will mark the biggest military presence in the country since when it berths in danang for a stay
the port city on vietnam s central coast is close to its blue whale gas field now being developed by oil major exxon mobil as well as the increasingly fortified paracel islands which china occupies and vietnam also claims
china s rapid construction and of the seven features it holds in the disputed spratly group further south has alarmed vietnam and other regional governments
as it seeks to enforce its claims to much of the south china sea china s navy and coastguard now routinely patrol vast swathes of the area through which some trillion in trade passes annually
while some chinese commentators have used the vinson s presence to demand an even greater chinese military in the waterway official reaction from beijing has been relatively muted since the stop was confirmed in january
carriers frequently ply the south china sea as part of a rising pattern of naval deployments and are now routinely shadowed by chinese naval vessels regional naval officers say
even as it moves forward with the vietnam has been engaging china over south china sea tensions said le hong hiep a vietnam expert at singapore s iseas yusof ishak institute
they might be irritated but gradualism is the key word here vietnam will only embrace the at a pace that doesn t cause an from zhang baohui a mainland security expert at hong kong lingnan university said he believed beijing would not be panicked by the carrier visit in part due to quiet but successful vietnamese diplomacy
beijing has a much better understanding of vietnam s balancing formula now he said
the vinson arrives amid repeated signals from the administration of president donald trump that it is keen to further develop security ties with vietnam as part of a range of political and military relationships to check the rise of china
given historic vietnamese suspicions of beijing hanoi s communist party leadership has forged a range of security relationships to balance its own ties with china
moscow its major patron through the cold war remains the key supplier to the modernising vietnamese military and india and israel are increasingly important suppliers
trump himself touted possible missile and other advanced weapons sales during his november visit to vietnam but not major arms deal has yet been completed
his administration s national security strategy published in december listed vietnam as a maritime partner
derek grossman a senior defence analyst at the rand said it was uncertain just how fast and how far vietnam was prepared to go even as it sought to deter china in the south china sea
it seems the side is still not sure quite what vietnam wants but the focus will likely be on ways to enhance vietnam s maritime domain awareness and maritime security capabilities he said
a recent study of vietnam s military modernisation by grossman published by the national bureau of asian research found that hanoi would struggle to sustain a conflict if its deterrence strategy failed
despite the acquisition of its first submarines new russian jet fighters and missiles vietnam faced extensive deployment and integration hurdles
