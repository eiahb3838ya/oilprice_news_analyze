britain urged to ensure promises to 'windrush generation' are made law
london april reuters britain s prime minister theresa may is under pressure to introduce legislation guaranteeing promises made to residents from the caribbean who have being incorrectly labelled illegal immigrants
for almost two weeks british ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the windrush generation invited to britain to plug labour shortfalls between and are being denied basic rights because of trouble documenting their status
the windrush scandal overshadowed the commonwealth summit in london earlier this month and has raised questions about may s stint as interior minister before she became prime minister in the wake of the brexit referendum
the government has apologised for the fiasco promised citizenship and compensation to those affected including to people who have lost their jobs been threatened with deportation and denied benefits because of the errors
but more than mainly opposition members of parliament have written to the prime minister calling for the pledges to be written into law without delay
the letter accuses the interior minister amber rudd who has faced calls to resign over her handling of the scandal of making up policy on the hoof to defuse the situation
rudd is due to address parliament on monday after giving contradictory statements about whether the government has immigration removal targets
in a separate letter the shadow interior minister diane abbott has called for a full inquiry into whether the interior minister misled parliament and breached the ministerial code
abbott said rudd s explanations as to why she had told members of parliament there were no such targets when in fact there were stretch credulity to the limit
but may s office said there is no need for an investigation because ministerial code only requires a resignation if a minister knowingly misleads parliament a charge the interior minister denies
