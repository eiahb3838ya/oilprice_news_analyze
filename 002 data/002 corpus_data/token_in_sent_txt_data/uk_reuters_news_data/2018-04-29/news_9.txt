reuters an audit of saudi aramco s oil reserves an essential part of the preparatory work for its planned initial public offering has found the state oil giant to have higher reserves than it previously reported sources familiar with the matter told reuters
saudi arabia s reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world s largest
two sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the independent external audit has found the proven oil reserves to be at least billion barrels which is slightly higher than the billion barrels the company reported in its annual review
having an internationally recognised reserves audit has become a key task for aramco as it seeks to become the world s most valuable company when it lists a percent stake in an ipo later this year or early
aramco s official reserves figures were more than confirmed said one source
this is good for the company s valuation another source said
aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment
for nearly years despite rising production large swings in oil prices and improved technology riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves at around billion barrels according to bp s statistical review
a reserves total significantly above or below the billion figure would likely affect aramco s potential market value in the listing and is being closely watched by investors
