india says electrified all villages ahead of prime minister's deadline
mumbai reuters india has electrified all its villages days ahead of a deadline set by prime minister narendra modi the government said on sunday which could give the ruling party a boost ahead of a general election in
asia s economy has been held back for years by a power shortage with industries having to cope with blackouts and hospitals forced to rely on generators for backup
but modi said on sunday that april on the evening of which a remote village in the northeast became the last to be connected to the grid would be remembered as a historic day in the development journey of india
yesterday we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several indians will be transformed forever modi wrote on twitter as various ministers in his government took to social media to congratulate him
government data showed that all of india s census villages have now been electrified
when modi took office in there were some villages without electricity
but just because all villages are connected to the grid does not mean all indians have access to power
the government considers a village electrified if it has basic electrical infrastructure and percent of its households and public places including schools local administrative offices and health centres have power
some people however said on twitter their villages had yet to be electrified despite the government s claim
no
not every village yet said twitter user dilip gupta identifying his village in a district of uttar pradesh in the north
over the course of years my native place has been expecting electricity every year but it hasn t arrived the world bank said in a report last year that globally billion people had no electricity with india and nigeria topping the list of most countries
