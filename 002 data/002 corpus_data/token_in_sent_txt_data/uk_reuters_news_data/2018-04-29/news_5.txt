armenia's ruling party says will not stop "people's candidate" becoming pm
yerevan april reuters armenia s ruling party said on sunday it would not stop protest leader nikol pashinyan becoming interim prime minister if all opposition factions in parliament support his candidacy
more than two weeks of protests forced the resignation of republican party veteran serzh sarksyan as prime minister and the party has said it will not put forward one of its own members to replace him in a bid to calm tensions
pashinyan a former journalist turned lawmaker has said parliament must elect him prime minister on may
he is so far the only person to put himself forward and as of sunday had received the support of all opposition parties in parliament that hold seats of the legislature where the republicans have a majority
after talks with pashinyan on sunday the parliamentary leader of the republican party vahram baghdasaryan said the party would not impede the election of the people s candidate if all three opposition factions in parliament supported him
the announcement coincided with the resumption of protests in the capital yerevan after a moratorium during which demonstrations against the republican party and official corruption were held in smaller cities
