pakistan's imran khan woos poor, vows radical change in election pitch
lahore pakistan reuters pakistani opposition figure imran khan on sunday vowed to sweep to power in upcoming elections promising radical change for the poor at a campaign rally in the city of lahore that has long been the power base of ousted premier nawaz sharif
with the minarets of lahore s badshahi mosque in sight khan outlined a populist plan to usher in a new era of prosperity that he envisages for pakistan after the general election at which he hopes to become prime minister
today we are at crossroads said khan a former cricketing hero and founder of the pakistan pti party
it is time to change our destiny and think khan told a boisterous crowd of about people that pakistan was heading towards destruction but his plan would help forge a fairer society and steer pakistan towards a path first envisaged by the nation s father muhammad ali jinnah
khan said that if elected he would build schools and world class hospitals across the country while farmers would get cheap loans
he also pledged to build million homes for the poor which would create jobs and stimulate the economy
after spending much of his political career on the fringes khan has in recent years emerged as a key challenger to sharif a prime minister who was ousted by the supreme court last year but whose party retains power
sharif s legal woes which the veteran leader says are politically motivated could further boost khan in the run up to the elections as an court is due to soon deliver a verdict on another sharif trial
khan has predicted sharif will be jailed before the polls likely in july
khan who has sought to shed his playboy image of the past is betting that his message coupled with rhetoric and a projecting image of pious devotion will propel him into power in the deeply conservative muslim nation of million people
in lahore khan s message resonated with many of the young men waving pti s green and flags
imran khan has given us the slogan of new pakistan and that s what we want said shahzad khan in reference to the naya pakistan slogan used by pti
sharif has accused khan of being a puppet of the powerful military establishment that has a history of meddling in pakistani politics
khan denies colluding with the army and the military denies interfering in politics
to dislodge sharif s pakistan muslim party khan s pti will have to make inroads into pakistan s biggest province which is home to million people and a electoral machine built over several decades
sharif was the chief minister of punjab in the and his younger brother shahbaz has ruled the province since entrenching s support across the wealthiest of pakistan s four provinces
we feel they are weakening with every day khan told foreign journalist ahead of the rally
he added that unlike in when swept to power this time around many of the electables politicians who carry large rural vote banks due to their status as tribal elders feudal lords and heads of various clans will switch allegiances away from to pti
the electables weigh things up they want to be on the winning side khan told foreign media
but at the lahore rally khan shunned talk of electables and focused on promising a new dawn for pakistan s poor
this system can not run unless we stand up with the downtrodden he said
