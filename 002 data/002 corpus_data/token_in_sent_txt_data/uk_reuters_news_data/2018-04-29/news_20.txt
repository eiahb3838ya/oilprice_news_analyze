australia announces $379 million funding for great barrier reef
sydney reuters australia s great barrier reef will receive a million million in new funding to restore water quality and protect the coral from starfish attacks government ministers announced on sunday
energy minister josh frydenberg said in a televised interview that some of the money would go directly to farmers to modify their practices to ensure that the reef doesn t get the large amounts of sediment nitrogen and pesticide which is so damaging to coral and which helps breed this the great barrier reef which can be seen from space covers square kilometers and was listed in as the most spectacular coral reef on the planet according to the website of the united nations cultural body unesco
unesco considered putting it on the in danger list last year due to recent widespread destruction but voted against it allowing australia s conservative government to dodge political embarrassment and potential damage to the country s tourism industry
a major outbreak of starfish has been destroying areas of the world reef prompting a major cull in january
the predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue
agricultural from sugar cane farms and cattle stations has also harmed the section of reef that is closest to shore according to bradley opdike a marine scientist at the australian national university
what happens with the sediment is it just smothers it while higher nutrients cause algae to the corals he told reuters by telephone on sunday
while the funding announcement was welcomed by scientists some were skeptical on whether it would actually help
jon brodie a professor at james cook university s coral reef studies centre of excellence said the funding was an extension of existing failed programs
it s not working it s not achieving major water quality improvements he told reuters by telephone on sunday
however foreign minister julie bishop said that australia was a world leader in managing and protecting its reef as the government s reef plan had been approved by the unesco world heritage committee as being the standard for the rest of the world to follow
they look to australia to provide the technical expertise the scientific research and to give the best practice management of coral reefs and that s what we demonstrate she told reporters on sunday from cairns on australia s east coast
