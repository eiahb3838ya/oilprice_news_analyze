adds details on commissioning of flamanville epr reactor paris oct reuters french ecology minister francois de rugy said on thursday the closure of the country s oldest nuclear plant at fessenheim was not conditional on the of a new reactor that utility edf is building and that it would be decommissioned by
the french government had previously tied the shutdown of fessenheim s two mw reactors to the commissioning of the new generation epr flamanville reactor that edf is building in normandy
the fessenheim plant will close during this presidential mandate which runs until de rugy told francinfo radio

edf is not able to give us a date for flamanville neither is the nuclear safety authority de rugy said
