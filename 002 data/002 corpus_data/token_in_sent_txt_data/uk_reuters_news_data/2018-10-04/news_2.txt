update 5-u.s. indicts russians in hacking of nuclear company westinghouse
washington reuters the united states on thursday charged seven russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack computers and steal data from the nuclear energy company westinghouse electric co as well as watchdogs sporting federations and an international agency probing the use of chemical weapons
the charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and to commit wire fraud and money laundering came hours after dutch authorities said they had disrupted an attempt by russian intelligence agents to hack into the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons in april
that organisation is tasked with probing the use of chemical weapons in syria and the march poisoning of a former russian military intelligence officer in the united kingdom
the justice department said one of the russian officers researched westinghouse and its employees online and stole credentials of westinghouse workers for servers in the united states including staff that work at its advanced nuclear reactor development and new reactor technology units
westinghouse which is located outside pittsburgh provides fuel services and nuclear power plant design to customers including ukraine
we have found no evidence that the phishing campaigns against employees to breach westinghouse s systems were successful the company said in a statement
it added that it is cooperating with the justice department but could not go into specifics because the investigation is ongoing
three of the seven russian military officers indicted on thursday were charged in a separate case brought by special counsel robert mueller s office for their role in hacking activities designed to influence the presidential election
john demers the head of the justice department s national security division said while the defendants overlap the case brought on thursday did not involve mueller s office
in the indictment prosecutors alleged that one of the russian officers ivan sergeyevich yermakov who was also charged by mueller in the hacking performed technical reconnaissance on westinghouse to gain access to ip addresses domains and network ports starting in november
in december the hackers registered a fake domain and website designed to mimic the company s website and sent phishing emails to at least five employees
once people clicked on the spoofed domain and provided their they were rerouted to the original network
on other occasions according to the indictment the conspirators also sent emails to the personal emails of employees at westinghouse
two account users clicked on the malicious links
the indictment alleges that the seven defendants all of whom are members of russia s military intelligence agency sought to sow disinformation and create an influence campaign as retaliation for the exposure of a russian athlete doping programme
the agency and the world agency were among their hacking targets as well sporting organizations including the federation internationle de football association fifa and athletes whose medical records were stolen and later publicized
russia has denied meddling in the presidential election contradicting a unanimous conclusion by intelligence agencies
all seven of the defendants are presumed to be in russia which does not have an extradition treaty with the united states
the indictment could make it hard for them to travel to other countries
the hackers travelled to other countries to carry out hacking activities sometimes with the use of diplomatic passports prosecutors allege
such efforts known as or close access hacking operations were carried out in cases where remote hacking from russia did not provide sufficient access to networks
one such trip for instance was rio de janeiro before and during the summer olympic games
some of the stolen data was later published under the false auspices of a hacktivist group known as fancy bears hack close access operations like the ones exposed today are reminders of the considerable resources available to nation states said john hultquist director of intelligence analysis at the cyber firm fireeye
while the motive behind the hacks involving groups and organizations probing russian poisonings were more the decision to target westinghouse was less apparent
justice department officials declined to provide additional details on thursday about the attacks on the company
efforts to penetrate its networks started in late some nine months after ukraine s president viktor yanukovych was removed from power during the ukrainian revolution
this is not the first time westinghouse has been a victim of a hack
in may the justice department indicted five chinese military hackers who targeted nuclear power metals and solar sectors
according to that indictment westinghouse had entered into a deal with a chinese nuclear company to construct and run four nuclear power plants in china
but during the talks prosecutors say one of the defendants stole proprietary and confidential technical designs and other data from westinghouse
