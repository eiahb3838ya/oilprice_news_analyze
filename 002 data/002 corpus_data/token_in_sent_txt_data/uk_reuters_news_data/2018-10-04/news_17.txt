update 1-deepening farm crisis in india could hurt modi's re-election bid
delhi reuters the financial squeeze on india s farmers is set to worsen because of record high fuel prices and surging costs of fertilisers posing a challenge to indian prime minister narendra modi in an election that must be held by may
the rise in input prices could not have come at worse time for farmers already grappling with falling domestic product prices due to rising yields and abundant harvests
yet the government has few easy options to respond
rival global producers have complained about indian state support and falling global farm product prices undermine export prospects
indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for modi in
but a fall in rural incomes risks damaging that support next year
thousands of farmers marched on new delhi on tuesday to demand better prices for their produce
police responded with teargas and water cannon
farmers suspended their protests after talks with officials that ran into early wednesday morning
but their demands and those of other agriculture workers who together make up about half india s billion people have not gone away
although we have decided to end our protest we still believe that the government is not serious about addressing the concerns of the farmers anil talan national secretary of farmers body bhartiya kisan union said after the march
diesel prices have surged percent this year making tilling fields harvesting and transporting crops expensive for india s million farmers who mostly use diesel tractors
alongside rising diesel costs prices of key fertilisers such as potash and phosphate have jumped nearly and percent respectively in a year as companies pass on the rise in global prices and the impact of the weak rupee to farmers
india the world s producer of staples such as rice and wheat imports all its potash needs and relies on foreign supplies for nearly percent of the phosphate it uses
it s a double whammy for farmers who have to bear the brunt of lower crop prices and higher input costs said devinder sharma an independent food and trade policy analyst saying this explained why farmers anger has come to the diesel demand is rising as farmers have started harvesting summer crops
after tilling they will plant wheat and rapeseed the main winter crops
union official talan said the government needed to prop up commodity prices and keep a lid on farmers costs to support the agricultural industry which accounts for about percent of india s trillion trillion economy

nilesh sable a cane farmer from sangli in the western state of maharashtra said fertiliser prices were rising each month
fertiliser firms say they have little choice but to pass on at least some extra costs due to a sharp fall in the rupee and a percent rise in international potash and phosphate prices
still we are not passing the entire burden to farmers said an official with a fertiliser company asking not to be named in line with government policy
greater farm efficiency is partly to blame
mechanised farming seed varieties and increased use of pesticides have pushed up harvests
output of most crops has soared to record levels each year
india s production of pulses such as lentils and beans surged to million tonnes in the year to june up from million tonnes in the previous months
imports of pulses such as lentils from canada australia and russia fell to million tonnes in the financial year to march the lowest since and well below the million tonnes imported in after failures in the monsoon
plentiful supplies extend to other crops
india is set to surpass brazil as the world s top sugar producer in the season but rising output has driven down local sugar prices by percent and left mills nursing losses
in bid to help the sector the government unveiled measures last week such as transport subsidies and incentives to export at least million tonnes of sugar
brazil thailand australia and other rival producers were quick to complain
vegetable prices especially onions cabbage and tomatoes have also fallen percent from last year largely because of overproduction
without enough refrigerated trucks excess production can not be stored
domestic milk prices dived more than percent in the past year but a global glut has made indian exports uncompetitive
harish galipelli head of commodities and currencies at inditrade derivatives commodities in mumbai said india needed to find markets abroad to reduce its inventories
