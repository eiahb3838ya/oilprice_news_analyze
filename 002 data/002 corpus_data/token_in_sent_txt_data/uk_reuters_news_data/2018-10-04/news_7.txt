update 1-clogged pipelines cut canada's oil price, small producers shift strategy
updates to specify that gear may set spending lower than planned final paragraph by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba oct reuters small canadian oil producers are striking complex deals with refineries diversifying production and seeking marketing help as they try to soften the blow from record price discounts on heavy crude generated by pipeline congestion
unlike integrated companies suncor energy and imperial oil that have refineries to process their own oil reserved pipeline space storage and marketing departments small producers scrape by with less
that reality is spurring companies such as pengrowth energy corp athabasca oil corp and gear energy ltd to find new strategies
canadian heavy crude sells for less than half the price of the benchmark west texas intermediate wti light oil with the differential reaching the widest level ever on friday according to shorcan energy brokers
the price for light oil is also under pressure
being small especially hurts when barrels are rejected by pipeline companies that do not have capacity to move all the crude produced called apportionment
small producers are then forced into finding new buyers shaving a further to per barrel off already deeply discounted prices said rob morgan chief executive of private heavy oil producer cona resources
the small to companies are going to have to step up their game said jihad traya manager of strategic energy advisory services at hsb solomon associates
what it comes down to now is how clever can you be fourteen percent of western canadian crude in was produced by companies with output of boepd or less not including private companies according to a canadian energy research institute calculation using canoils data
a vibrant junior sector is critical for the role it plays exploring boundaries of hydrocarbon pools said mark oberstoetter director of upstream research at consultancy wood mackenzie
while the differentials hurt they are based off rising wti prices which has allowed some small producers to stay profitable he said
more small canadian oil producers are making sales to refineries that lock in a fixed price for the differential allowing them to limit risk traya said
refiners who benefit from the big discount get to lock in supplies
pengrowth agreed to sell most of its crude production barrels per day and percent of next year s output bpd to two refineries at a fixed differential
pengrowth also gains access to the refineries pipeline space
the company is now trying to lock in more of its and production on that basis said pengrowth ceo pete sametz
it s apportionment athabasca is also mitigating the impact of apportionment through contracts with refineries that involve pipeline space ceo rob broen said in a presentation
for some small producers outside marketing expertise is more important than ever
phoenix energy marketing has doubled the volume of crude it markets in the past three years to barrels per day said president dave maffitt
you know you re going to take a haircut on price
it s just minimizing the haircut and being knowledgeable enough about what the alternatives might be maffitt said
but not all strategies are successful and many refiners are hesitant to lock in differentials when the widening trend boosts their margins said a canadian industry source
the best barrel to buy is the distressed barrel he said
one deal collapsed between a east coast refiner and canadian producer due to restrictions on older widely used rail cars a source at the refiner said showing that there is no easy way around transport bottlenecks
to diversify from selling heavy crude gear energy announced in july it would buy light oil assets in saskatchewan
it may also set capital spending lower than it originally planned ceo ingram gillmore said
