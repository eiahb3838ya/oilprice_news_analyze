black sea oil & gas gets romania gas project permit, but frets over new taxes
bucharest feb reuters black sea oil gas received a construction permit from the country s energy ministry on friday for an offshore gas project but it said new taxes could make it hard to go ahead with the development
the company controlled by private equity firm carlyle group lp discovered two wells holding an estimated billion cubic metres of gas in some kilometres offshore in the black sea
it hoped to start production by pending a final investment decision becoming the first in a line of companies to tap the european union state s vast offshore resources
but romania s social democrat government approved a slew of taxes via emergency decree in december without an impact assessment or public debate including a tax on turnover for energy firms and a cap on gas prices
that came on top of other new laws for offshore drilling stipulating that romanian companies would need to sell at least half their yearly gas output in the country
the impact of these legislative changes on our investment plans are highly negative the firm s chief executive mark beacom told reuters
our ability to obtain a final investment decision is adversely unlike other countries in the region romania is largely independent in terms of its energy needs
it imports less than percent of its gas needs from russia with the rest produced locally mainly by state producer romgaz and omv petrom controlled by austria s omv
the price cap removes investor confidence that being a romanian producer will not result in being economically disadvantaged versus investing in other countries beacom added
the sales restrictions also made it difficult for the company to finance the offshore project he said
the new taxes and price caps have received widespread criticism from businesses but the government has said it has no plans to withdraw or amend the emergency decree
in october after the offshore law was approved petrom postponed an investment decision on its black sea neptun block a joint venture with major exxonmobil
last year the national agency for mineral resources anrm said the country could almost double its natural gas production to about billion cubic metres a year by helped by new black sea offshore discoveries
