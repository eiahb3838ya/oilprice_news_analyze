top german conservative hints at slower coal phase-out in nod to party right
berlin reuters germany s phasing out of power stations could be delayed beyond if the deadline creates problems for the security of electricity supply a senior legislator in chancellor angela merkel s party said
the proposed last saturday by a commission tasked with mapping out germany s transition to a more environmentally friendly economy drew criticism from some in industry who fear the impact of higher energy prices
but in remarks that appeared aimed at the right of a party not always comfortable with merkel s centrist approach ralph brinkhaus chair of the conservative benches in parliament said it was crucial not to be dogmatic in pursuing a goal that was widely accepted
energy supply security must be guaranteed he told welt am sonntag newspaper
if it is endangered we should be free to do another round and address that without abandoning the path we ve chosen
there s no reason to be dogmatic about brinkhaus from the christian democrats cdu most wing last year toppled a merkel ally in the race for the influential parliamentary leader post precipitating the sequence of events that led to merkel resigning as party leader and announcing that this would be her last term as chancellor
that sparked a fight for the soul of the party whose members have chafed at the centrist course that merkel plotted over the years of her chancellorship during which time she has often seemed closer to leftists and greens than some in her own party
while her ally annegret s narrow victory in the race to succeed her as party leader was seen as a win for her centrist vision brinkhaus s remarks are a reminder that the party s right has not gone away as the cdu gears up for a series of tough european and regional elections
the coal commission unveiled its compromise after marathon talks early last saturday proposing to shut gw of coal capacity by and promised billion euros to help regions affected by the end of coal mining
brinkhaus also called in the interview for a rethink on government spending
do we have too many regulations or even a nanny state he asked
an insa poll for bild newspaper on saturday showed that the cdu is still by far the most popular party on percent
but a disappointing election year could yet the internal party war
