mexico fuel theft curtailed, secret 'hose' found in refinery -obrador
mexico city jan reuters mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador said on tuesday a crackdown had dramatically reduced fuel theft and uncovered a secret pipe that was used to siphon gasoline out of one of the country s refineries
such fuel theft has dropped from truck loads per day to since thousands of soldiers were sent to company pemex s installations last month lopez obrador said at a daily news conference
the crackdown on years of mounting fuel theft is the leftist government s first major move against corruption and violence after taking office on but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy
by closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states including guanajuato a major hub in central mexico
criminal groups and others who have tapped pipelines have long been blamed for billions of dollars of losses to public coffers over the past few years but lopez obrador said last month that far more fuel was being stolen directly from pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials
lopez obrador said the military had discovered a mile hose that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at the salamanca refinery in the central state of guanajuato into a secret storage area
he admitted there were complaints about the shortages but said they were not widespread and urged an end to panic buying and said shortages were an issue of distribution not supply
this is not in vain lopez obrador said
we are going to end local media showed images of tanker trucks escorted by federal police heading from costal states to the country s interior
it was not immediately clear what impact the crackdown will have on imports of fuel
mexico is the top export destination for energy products importing about million barrels every day or nearly a quarter of all overseas sales
