feature-u.s. climate hawk-in-chief? washington governor eyes presidential run
seattle jan thomson reuters foundation on a recent winter beach walk washington state governor jay inslee s grandson beamed with delight as he spotted a crab
protecting such moments of connection with nature are one of the motivations driving inslee to consider running for the presidency with action on climate change as his major campaign platform
that type of experience in nature is what is so threatened and i want my grandkids to continue to have those experiences inslee told the thomson reuters foundation in a telephone interview
the washington democrat from one of the country s states would likely face a tough uphill climb to the presidency and plenty of analysts are skeptical of his chances to win the democratic nomination much less the oval office
but inslee believes fighting climate change should be the top priority for the white house a dramatic shift from the views of the current occupant who has called global warming a hoax and plans to withdraw the from the paris agreement on climate change
it requires a concerted national will and the political capital of the president of the united states to put their shoulder to this wheel he said
we have to do climate a host of democratic challengers to republican president donald trump are expected to join the political fray this year from elizabeth warren of massachusetts to former vice president joe biden
how much any of them would make action on climate change a priority in a new democratic administration remains unclear
but inslee believes there is an economic as well as environmental case for embarking on a green new deal that would transition the economy off fossil fuels and toward cleaner renewable power
he likens such a change to other major historical shifts from the united states build up of world war two industrial might to the research and development program behind the apollo space program that landed americans on the moon
we have to change our economy so it does not run on oil and diesel and instead runs on clean energy inslee said
that is the largest economic transition perhaps in human history since we went from pulling a travois to having a if done well the governor said decarbonizing the economy could spark plenty of new jobs in emerging clean energy industries a view he outlined in his book apollo s fire
the number one job growth rate in america today is for solar installer and number two is for wind maintenance engineer he said
these jobs are growing twice as fast as the rest of the inslee sees his state which he has governed since as a model of combined legislation and strong economic growth
in recent years washington has reviewed its energy portfolio to boost renewables and encouraged cities and towns to buy electric buses
the state has also installed a network of electric vehicle charging stations and seeded a clean energy research and development fund
home to major companies such as microsoft and starbucks washington state had the strongest economy in the united states last year according to an analysis of indicators by personal finance website wallethub
in the current state legislative session inslee is pushing for percent clean electricity statewide by and a clean fuel standard in line with other west coast states
but efforts to put in place carbon pricing in the state have failed three times under his watch
inslee has not yet officially announced his candidacy for president
but in october he started a political action committee and has raised through november for a potential run according to federal election filings
last year he also made multiple visits to early primary voting states as chairperson of the democratic governors association
he believes support for clean energy was a successful campaign issue in the seven governerships that democrats won from republicans in the midterm elections
inslee also points to a september poll of likely iowa democratic caucus voters who said restoring leadership on climate change is one of their top three issues
but a yale university poll from last march suggested global warming still ranks out of issues of importance for voters nationally
political scientists say that is likely to hinder inslee s prospects for taking his green campaign national
the brutal reality is that the electorate does not care about environmental issues said aseem prakash director of the university of washington center for environmental politics
prakash gives inslee little to no chance of winning the presidency but believes a bid would boost his national visibility and make him a viable candidate for a post such as head of the environmental protection agency
in such a role prakash said he would be able to translate a lot of policies he has been talking about into concrete an inslee candidacy on a climate change platform also could encourage other democratic candidates to talk about the issue
the former congressman remains undeterred about his likely slim chances of winning the top job
pollsters be damned he said
you ve got to go with your he believes combatting climate change could help unify a fractured country and that he could be the one to push ahead the action needed now to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change and take advantages of new clean energy opportunities
unfortunately we re at the eleventh hour in terms of addressing climate change inslee said
but it can be our hour
it can be our shining hour where my state and eventually america leads the world in a clean energy reporting by gregory scruggs editing by laurie goering please credit the thomson reuters foundation the charitable arm of thomson reuters that covers humanitarian news climate change resilience women rights trafficking and property rights
