commerce secretary wilbur ross said late on monday that beijing and washington could reach a trade deal that we can live with as dozens of officials from the world s two largest economies held talks in a bid to end their trade dispute that has roiled global markets since last year
despite optimism around the talks in beijing some analysts warned that the relationship between washington and beijing remained on shaky grounds and that tensions could flare up again soon
we remain concerned about the world s most important bilateral relationship political risk consultancy eurasia group said in its outlook
the political establishment believes engagement with beijing is no longer working and it s embracing an openly confrontational approach and rising nationalist sentiment makes it unlikely that beijing will ignore provocations eurasia group said
beyond politics oil markets are being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the middle organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec as well as member russia
crude oil prices have benefited from opec production cuts and steadying equities markets said mithun fernando investment analyst at australia s rivkin securities
looming over the cuts however is a surge in oil supply driven by a steep rise in onshore shale oil drilling and production
as a result crude oil production rose by a whopping million barrels per day bpd last year to a world record million bpd
with drilling activity still high most analysts expect oil production to rise further this year
