u.s. lng producers face risk unless trade war resolved -energy group
washington jan reuters the nascent liquefied natural gas export industry has been particularly vulnerable to the trade war the head of the american petroleum institute industry group said on tuesday adding that he hopes negotiators will soon resolve the dispute
mike sommers the president and ceo of the american petroleum institute told reporters an escalating trade dispute could harm lng producers as other countries move in to fill any gap
this is a leadership vacuum that will be filled by many of the united states opponents sommers told reporters in a teleconference about lng from other countries filling china s needs if the fuel does not come from the united states
the united states is the world s exporter of lng
china the importer bought about percent of lng exports in worth about million
through much of china was on track to buy just percent of the exports
president donald trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese imports last year and threatened to pressure beijing more to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property and hacking
china has retaliated with its own tariffs
the trade dispute has also roiled crude oil markets since last year on worries it could harm consumer demand
oil prices rose on tuesday on hopes for successful negotiations
sommers said countries that elbow their way in to supply lng to china may not produce the fuel as environmentally responsibly as companies and in some cases they may be countries that are not favorable to washington s foreign policy
he did not mention any other countries but the united states has competed with russia for lng markets
a lot of times energy is used as a club by rogue nations and i think the united states has proven itself to be a reliable supplier he said
sommers said the api was encouraged that the united states and china the world s two largest economies were having trade talks in beijing that will continue for an unscheduled third day as they look to resolve the dispute
last month trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed to a freeze on new tariffs to advance trade talks declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions
companies proposing new lng export terminals including liquefied natural gas ltd have been hoping the agreement could help advance their projects
