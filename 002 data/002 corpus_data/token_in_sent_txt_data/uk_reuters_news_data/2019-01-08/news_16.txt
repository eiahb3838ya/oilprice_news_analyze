u.s. carbon emissions spike in 2018 on industry, fuel demand
washington jan reuters emissions of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide spiked last year after falling for the previous three as cold weather spurred heating natural gas demand and as the economy pushed planes and trucks to guzzle fuel an estimate released on tuesday said
the rhodium group an independent research group said the emissions rose percent in the highest jump since when the economy bounced back from the great recession
the spike occurred even though saw a record amount of shutdowns of power plants fired by coal the fuel richest in carbon output when burned

the environmental protection agency did not respond to questions about the report saying it would only answer queries related to the partial federal government shutdown or about environmental emergencies
trump administration officials have said that emissions can waiver from year to year depending on the economy but that the country can both cut emissions and enjoy a strong economy at the same time
