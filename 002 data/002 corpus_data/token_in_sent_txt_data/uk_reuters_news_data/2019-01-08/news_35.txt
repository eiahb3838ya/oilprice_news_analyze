putin hails energy security boost from russia's first lng floating storage
moscow reuters president vladimir putin opened russia s first liquefied natural gas lng floating storage and regasification unit fsru on tuesday saying it bolsters the country s energy security
the marshal vasilevskiy fsru has been set up in kaliningrad wedged between european union members poland and lithuania by russian energy giant gazprom to bypass pipeline gas deliveries via lithuania in case transit is disrupted
moscow s decision to set up the fsru was in part to reduce gas transit risks to kaliningrad home to a baltic fleet base as the eu steps up efforts to reduce its dependency on russia a transcript of putin s speech said
in recent years we have paid much attention to energy supplies to the energy of the region as a whole including in connection with eu plans to remove the baltic states from russia s energy ring putin said
this is their eu countries business
additional tax payers money will be invested into gazprom ceo alexei miller told the interfax news agency that supplies to kaliningrad from lithuania had been completely halted on tuesday and replaced with natural gas from the fsru
the fsru the first of its kind in russia which arrived from singapore last month with a cargo on board to commission the lng import facility can provide kaliningrad with billion cubic meters bcm of gas a year gazprom has said
lng is delivered by tankers meaning it can be supplied to many markets
