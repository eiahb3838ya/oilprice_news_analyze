update 2-edf's flamanville reactor start again delayed to 2020
paris reuters problems with weldings have forced french utility edf to delay the date for its troubled flamanville nuclear reactor to the second quarter of and pushed its cost estimate up to three times the original budget
when construction started in the target launch date was but the project has suffered a string of serious technical problems including the discovery of weak spots in its reactor vessel cover and has been delayed several times
the cost estimate is now up by another million euros to billion euros billion edf said in a statement
it said that loading of the nuclear fuel last set for the fourth quarter of was now scheduled for the fourth quarter of
on a call with reporters flamanville project director laurent thieffry said that repairs to the weldings would start at the end of this month and continue till summer
he added that the reactor would be connected to the grid in the first quarter of and its commercial start at full power was now scheduled for the second quarter of
the new planning for the epr reactor in flamanville is totally realistic edf head of new nuclear projects xavier ursat said
but he added that the startup schedule would depend on the of nuclear regulator asn
edf said the million euro extra cost consisted of to million euros in cost directly related to the welding repairs with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project
edf shares were down percent in early trading on a virtually flat french bourse
the utility said a total of weldings on the reactor s secondary circuit would have to be redone while for another it is confident that it can convince regulator asn that they are fit for service
another weldings were in line with specifications and needed no repairs it said
the secondary circuit consists of meters of cm diameter piping that conducts steam from the reactor s four steam generators to the plant s turbine and pumps condensed water back to the steam generators
four to five centimeters thick the pipes require welding that needs to go around each pipe times and takes eight weeks per welding
edf said the million euro extra cost consisted of to million euros directly related to the welding repairs with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project
edf said it would closely supervise and control the welding work on the reactor itself
a parliament report about nuclear security released this month said that excessive reliance on outsourcing was causing safety issues in edf s reactors
france relies on nuclear energy for percent of its electricity
the epr reactor is the first new reactor to be built on its soil in decades
the french government wants to reduce the country s reliance on nuclear to percent and will decide later this year by when this target should be reached
