update 2-clariant's update on sabic tie-up faces delay, ceo says
zurich reuters clariant s update on its ties with saudi basic industries sabic is likely to be delayed as antitrust approvals for the saudi company s percent stake in the swiss speciality chemical maker take longer than expected
sabic s move to become clariant s largest shareholder has prompted speculation that the saudi company could increase its holding but clariant ceo hariolf kottmann said sabic had no current plans to make a full bid
if they change their position they will let us know kottmann said adding any talk of such a deal was premature especially before the two have had detailed talks
kottmann told reuters on wednesday after clariant published results that the timing of the strategy update with investors planned for early september was now uncertain
the saudi chemicals company bought a quarter of clariant in january helping to resolve the swiss company s fight with activist investors who had blocked its planned merger with rival huntsman
but the swiss company can not start talks with sabic over their future kottmann said until regulators in countries including brazil and mexico give their blessing to sabic s purchase of the stake
if we receive the antitrust clearance at the beginning of september we need at least four five six weeks to continue the discussions we ve had currently to bring a bit more meat to the bone kottmann said
he said lawyers from both sides have said there was no reason not to get the clearance but the formal process is taking more time
clariant shares were down percent at gmt
sabic s purchase has triggered speculation about a full takeover of clariant
clariant remains the top takeover candidate in the sector baader helvea analyst markus mayer said
but kottmann said that sabic had not changed its tone since january when it said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover
from today s point of view it a takeover makes no sense because i think now we are in a much earlier stage and phase of discussions where we have the obligation to find potentials for our shareholders kottmann said
clariant s net income rose to million swiss francs million up from million francs a year ago
sales rose percent to billion francs from billion francs in the same period in and ahead of analyst forecasts in a reuters poll
zuercher kantonalbank analysts said a drop in profitability at clariant s natural resources business that supplies the oil and mining industries showed it was taking longer to recover than expected
the ebitda margin at this business fell to percent in the first half down from percent clariant chief financial officer patrick jany said natural resources was one of the areas where the company s business is slated to improve in the second half
