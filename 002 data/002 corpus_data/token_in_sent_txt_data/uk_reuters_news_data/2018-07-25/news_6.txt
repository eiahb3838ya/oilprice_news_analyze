control station at libya's el sharara oilfield back on, output unclear
benghazi libya july reuters a control station at libya s giant sharara oilfield has resumed operation but foreign engineers who help operate the field have not returned yet due to security reasons a field engineer said on wednesday
station was shut down after two oilfield staff were abducted in an attack by an unknown group more than a week ago forcing libya s national oil corporation noc to cut output
there was no current production figure available but the engineer said with the station coming back output would rise again
noc had previously said it expected output to drop by barrels per day bpd although one engineer had said then output at the field which had been producing bpd recently had already dropped to below bpd
the attack happened at the control station on the outskirts of sharara about kilometres miles away from the main part of the field
noc operates sharara in partnership with repsol total omv and equinor formerly known as statoil
the field in libya s remote southwest has suffered security problems in the past including raids in which vehicles and mobile phones were stolen
in addition to being one of libya s main export grades sharara feeds the bpd zawiya oil refinery on the country s northwest coast
