smart move: english islands fight fuel poverty with clean energy
london july thomson reuters foundation solar panels and smart batteries could help cut electricity bills by almost half for people on the isles of scilly a british energy storage provider said as it launched a renewable energy programme on the group of cornish islands
the smart energy islands project aims to slash emissions improve the power supply and lower costs for residents of five inhabited islands km miles off england s southwest coast energy firm moixa said
the isles of scilly aim to generate percent of their energy from renewable sources and make percent of vehicles driven there electric or by
a undersea cable is now the only connection between the isles of scilly and the uk s national grid
last year islanders had to rely on diesel generators for almost two weeks after the cable was damaged by a fishing boat
the isles dependence on imported fuel has left many families with unreliable heating systems and expensive bills
electricity costs per household are about percent higher than in cornwall according to moixa
of the islands residents about percent can not afford to heat their homes compared to roughly percent across england a government report said this year
the project costing million pounds million and partly financed by the european regional development fund will install solar panels on more than council houses as well as smart water heaters and smart batteries in homes and businesses
the islands will cut carbon emissions by nearly tonnes per year once the solar panels are operating according to moixa
the combined technologies due to be installed by this autumn will provide islanders with a reliable electricity supply and could reduce their bills by as much as percent said chris wright moixa s chief technology officer
the smart batteries put in by the company will store surplus power and release it when demand peaks he told the thomson reuters foundation
the system delivers flexibility and manages the load on the grid he said
the project led by hitachi europe ltd offers a blueprint for other small islands and cities across europe wright noted
the isles of scilly are a small community but can be seen as a prototype city he said
the project is a precursor for what energy systems might look like in a few years time he added
