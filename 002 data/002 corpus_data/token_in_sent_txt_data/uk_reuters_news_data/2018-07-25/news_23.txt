valeo cuts 2018 profit outlook, blaming new emissions tests
paris reuters french auto parts maker valeo cut its profitability goal on wednesday citing the introduction of new emissions test standards that are expected to disrupt production by some of its carmaker clients
valeo the maker of automotive lighting sensors and electrified transmission parts said its operating profit might be slightly below the percent of sales recorded last year having previously pledged to match it
the company which also reported a percent decline in net income to million euros million blamed the target cut on disruptions to the production of certain vehicles in europe resulting from the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test wltp that becomes mandatory in september
earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization rose percent to billion euros or percent of sales from percent a year earlier valeo said
revenue advanced percent to billion euros short of the billion expected by analysts based on the median estimate in an inquiry financial poll for reuters
order intake came to billion euros for the first half down percent
new orders at valeo s parts venture with siemens however jumped percent to billion euros
valeo did not identify the carmakers or vehicles affected by the hiccups
however volkswagen has acknowledged renting parking spaces to accommodate many of the vehicles that may be caught up in testing delays
mercedes maker daimler also cited the new tests among factors that led to a june profit warning
peugeot maker psa group by contrast insisted it was largely unaffected by the testing change as chief executive carlos tavares unveiled record earnings on tuesday
the new global test regime designed to correspond more closely to actual driving habits was already under discussion before the dieselgate scandal that led to closer scrutiny of widespread emissions by carmakers
but european union authorities say there are signs that some carmakers are already manipulating the new tests
