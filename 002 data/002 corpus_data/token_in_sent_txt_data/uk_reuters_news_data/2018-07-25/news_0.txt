feature-power to the pupils: solar panels keep kenya's kids in school
kilifi kenya july thomson reuters foundation from a mile away the roof of mihingoni primary school glitters in kenya s midday sun
the effect though comes not from the roof but from what is on it a sparkling array of solar panels
mihingoni is one of eight mostly primary schools in the southeastern coastal county of kilifi that have been fitted with a solar array
the key task of the panels is to power tablet computers that pupils use under the government s strategy to integrate into primary education
last year more than million of the devices were distributed to primary school students across the country among them mihingoni s pupils
but tablets require electricity which many rural schools lack
mihingoni primary is connected to the national grid but power is expensive and only its computer room has electricity limiting charging of the devices
but since the solar panels were fitted in january pupils can have access to their tablets any time and the cost of power has considerably gone down said kuchanja karisa headmaster of the school about kilometres miles north of the coastal city of mombasa
in his impoverished area he said access to electricity boosts access to education not least because the cost of power is factored into school fees
poverty levels in this area are high and any slight increase or decrease in school fees affects school attendance he said
the panels are part of a project run by two organisations to provide solar power to primary schools and clinics in remote communities
the ovo foundation the charitable arm of a energy firm provides funding while energy impact a charity that works on accelerating access to energy does the installation
the need is great thousands of kenyan schools lack access to the national power grid
figures from the education ministry show the country had primary schools as of of which nearly were state schools
as of last december about primary schools were connected to the grid according to simon gicharu who chairs the government s rural electrification program
a lack of power at unconnected schools however makes it difficult for students to take full advantage of tablets provided under the programme karisa said
at mihingoni for example pupils unable to access the computer lab to charge their tablets which have an battery life ended up using them less the headmaster said
at the school students previously paid kenyan shillings a year for electricity
but today with the solar panels there is a much lower fee shillings which goes to pay for more grid power in the rainy season when the solar panels work less effectively
cutting costs has seen a sharp increase in the number of students who have since joined the school karisa said
in the school had about pupils in each class he said
now it has with the lower cost encouraging more parents to send their children to school
annual fees at the school are about shillings per primary school student apart from the energy supplement
every coin counts for area locals karisa said
fifty kilometres north is migodomani primary school which also had solar panels installed in january
headmaster ngala kahindi luwali told the thomson reuters foundation that until the panels were available his pupils had been unable to use tablets at all
with the solar panels we have been able to catch up with other schools in urban areas that have already incorporated he said
pupils are enthusiastic with since it s a new method of the panels power not only the tablets but projectors and a television none of which the school previously had been able to use
the array also provides lighting to the school s boarding facilities where students once relied on costly and polluting paraffin lanterns
gaby sethi who heads the ovo foundation said she believes providing access to clean electricity in parts of the world without power can help people get ahead
we think we can have a significant impact on people and children s lives if we re electrifying schools and health clinics she said
under the project the panels and installation are free with the schools paying for ongoing maintenance costs karisa said
gabriel katana the county s head of education and information and communications technology said the local government wants to see solar panels installed to power hospitals and other social amenities too
in the future we will purchase solar pumps to use in irrigating food to be grown in the schools to feed the pupils he said
the ambition is to use solar power for all of the county s primary school needs not just powering information technology he said
relying on solar panels has some drawbacks however including that they can be less effective in rainy and cold seasons said mihingoni primary school s karisa
at those times the school has to revert back to using kerosene for lighting and grid power for electricity he said
daniel kuria who manages energy impact s solar programme in kenya agreed there is a need for a solar array that generates sufficient power in the rainy season
mihingoni primary will get an improved battery system to store solar power and help bridge the gap he said
for now the solar panels and lower school fees as a result are helping keep students in school karisa said
parents can use the flimsiest of excuses to keep their children home so it important to have cheap reliable energy like solar that will not expense the parents he said
