exclusive-opec, russia discuss raising oil output by about 1 mln bpd - sources
move would reduce with agreed production cuts oil price up almost percent since end of last year talks among saudi arabia russia uae in petersburg adds graphics by rania el gamal olesya astakhova and alex lawler may reuters saudi arabia and russia are discussing raising opec and oil output by around million barrels per day bpd easing months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far sources familiar with the matter said
such an increase would bring compliance with agreed supply curbs down to percent from april s level of around percent the sources said
the initial talks are being led by the energy ministers of opec kingpin saudi arabia and russia at petersburg this week along with their counterpart from the united arab emirates which holds the opec presidency this year the sources said
opec and ministers meet next in vienna on june and the final decision will be taken there
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and producers led by russia have agreed to curb output by about million bpd until the end of to reduce global stocks but the inventory overhang is now near opec s target
the current discussions are aimed at relaxing compliance with the production cuts the sources said in an effort to cool the market after oil hit a barrel on concerns over a supply shortage
while russia and opec benefit from higher oil prices up almost percent since the end of last year their voluntary output cuts have opened the door to other producers such as the shale sector to ramp up production and gain market share
the final production number is not set yet as dividing up the extra barrels among deal participants could be tricky the sources said
the talks now are to bring compliance down to the percent level more for opec rather than for one source said
opec may decide to raise oil output as soon as june due to worries over iranian and venezuelan supply and after washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far opec and oil industry sources told reuters on tuesday
however it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than gulf oil producers led by saudi arabia and russia the sources said
only a few members have the capability to increase production so implementation will be complicated one opec source said
opec s compliance with the output deal reached unprecedented levels in recent months meaning it had cut well above target
falling venezuelan output due to an economic crisis has helped opec deliver a bigger cut than intended
so far opec had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand
the rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with iran as well as venezuela s collapsing output were behind the change in opec s thinking
concerns raised by the united states that oil prices were too high also made the exporting group start internal discussions opec sources familiar with the matter have said
president donald trump whose country is a major oil producer but is not part of the pact last month said opec had artificially boosted oil prices
