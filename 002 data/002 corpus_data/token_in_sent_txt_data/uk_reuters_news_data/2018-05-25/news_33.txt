swimming-swimmer bids to become first to cross pacific, raising awareness of plastic pollution
yokohama japan reuters when ben lecomte stepped onto land for the first time after swimming across the atlantic ocean in he told himself never again
yet years on lecomte is attempting an even more daunting challenge as he looks to become the first person to swim across the pacific ocean covering kilometres
on tuesday lecomte and his support team will set out from tokyo on an epic expedition expected to last more than six months and see the frenchman arrive in san francisco
i knew it was something that was part of me and my identity lecomte told reuters as his team undertook the final preparations to the support yacht in yokohama s bayside marina on friday
the way i look at it is as a way to express myself
it didn t happen very soon after the atlantic swim because i got married i had children so i put that aside
but i knew i was going to come back to that project the s plan is to swim for eight hours a day as well as consume over calories as he undertakes an extraordinary journey that is and experiment
much of lecomte backing comes from scientific publisher who will be providing daily updates on his progress as well as promoting research on the data collected by the support team
more than different scientific organizations some medical and some oceanographic will be benefiting from the data gathered during the expedition
much of the research will focus on plastic pollution in the pacific ocean specifically the of plastic smog containing billions of pieces of microplastic
there is increasing concern among scientists about the effect of pervasive plastic pollution on marine ecosystems
in particular they are worried about microplastic particles bits measuring no more than of an inch mm which come from large plastic trash that has fragmented into smaller pieces or microbeads in products like facial soap body wash and toothpaste
for lecomte raising awareness of these issues is more important than setting any record
i remember my father and he was the one who taught me how to swim in the atlantic
i remember times when we would go on the beach and walk and never see any plastic
now everywhere i go on the beach i see plastic everywhere said lecomte
if we are all aware of it then after it is much easier to take action and to change our behaviour because the solution is in our hands
we know what we have to the frenchman whose atlantic crossing was never ratified by guinness world records because it can not be fully verified that he resumed his swims in the exact point he stopped them the day before believes the mental battle will be tougher than the physical endurance
it is mind over matter said lecomte who is also an architectural consultant based in austin texas when not in the water
to do the physical aspect of it sure it is difficult and all that but what is much more difficult is to be in that very hostile environment to do that days in and days out to push you and to push your limits then the mind has to be super to overcome this lecomte will make a strict plan for what he will think about for eight hours in the water each day
the worst thing that can happen is not knowing what you are going to do with your mind and going to the wrong place he said
as well as mental challenges lecomte will have to endure turbulent and unpredictable weather potentially freezing cold water as well as sharks and jellyfish
however right now lecomte just wants to get started
