wrapup 2-opec, russia prepared to raise oil output under u.s. pressure
move would reduce with agreed production cuts oil price up almost percent since end of last year talks among saudi arabia russia uae in petersburg adds novak quote details on supply curbs by katya golubkova dmitry zhdannikov and rania el gamal st may reuters saudi arabia and russia are discussing raising opec and oil production by some million barrels a day sources said while opec s chief said a complaint from president donald trump over high prices had triggered the idea of upping output
riyadh and moscow are prepared to ease output cuts to calm consumer worries about supply adequacy their energy ministers said on friday with saudi arabia s khalid adding that any such move would be gradual so as not to shock the market
raising production would ease months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far with oil having hit its highest since late at a barrel this month
opec began a discussion about easing production cuts following a critical tweet from trump opec s mohammad barkindo said
trump tweeted last month that opec had artificially boosted oil prices
we pride ourselves as friends of the united states barkindo told a panel with the saudi and russian energy ministers in petersburg at russia s main economic forum
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies led by russia have agreed to curb output by about million barrels per day bpd through to reduce global stocks but the inventory overhang is now near opec s target
in april pact participants cut production by percent more than required with falling output from venezuela helping opec deliver a bigger reduction than intended
sources familiar with the matter said an increase of about million bpd would lower compliance to percent of the agreed level
barkindo also said it was not unusual for the united states to put pressure on opec as some energy secretaries had asked the producer group to help lower prices in the past
oil prices fell more than percent towards a barrel on friday as saudi arabia and russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs
russian energy minister alexander novak said current cuts were in reality million bpd due to a drop in venezuelan production somewhere around million bpd higher than the initially agreed reductions
novak declined to say however whether opec and russia would decide to boost output by million bpd at their next meeting in june
the moment is coming when we should consider assessing ways to exit the deal very seriously and gradually ease quotas on output cuts novak said in televised comments
initial talks are being led by the energy ministers of opec kingpin saudi arabia and russia at petersburg this week along with their counterpart from the united arab emirates which holds the opec presidency this year the sources said
opec and ministers meet in vienna on june and the final decision will be taken there
current discussions are aimed at relaxing compliance with the production cuts the sources said in an effort to cool the market after oil hit a barrel on concerns over a supply shortage
china has also raised concerns about whether enough oil is being pumped according to a saudi statement issued after energy minister falih called china s energy chief on friday to discuss cooperation between their countries and to review the oil market
nur bekri administrator of china s national energy administration told falih he hopes saudi arabia can take further substantial actions to guarantee adequate supply in the crude oil market the saudi energy ministry statement said
while russia and opec benefit from higher oil prices up almost percent since the end of last year their voluntary output cuts have opened the door to other producers such as the shale sector to ramp up production and gain market share
the final production number is not set yet as dividing up the extra barrels among deal participants could be tricky the sources said
the talks now are to bring compliance down to the percent level more for opec rather than for one source said
opec may decide to raise oil output as soon as june due to worries over iranian and venezuelan supply and after washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far opec and oil industry sources told reuters on tuesday
however it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than gulf oil producers led by saudi arabia and russia the sources said
only a few members have the capability to increase production so implementation will be complicated one opec source said
so far opec had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand
the rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with iran as well as venezuela s collapsing output were behind the change in opec s thinking
