chinese, others clamor for crude exports, but u.s. straining capacity
new york may reuters the oil export infrastructure is straining to keep up as the country s crude oil exports hit new highs and china snaps up more of it than ever before
crude production has surged to a record million barrels a day driven largely by growth from the permian shale patch in west texas which pumps more than million bpd
however the infrastructure to move it abroad is lagging even as prices are well below the brent benchmark a discount that sits just off highs at per barrel
crude exports peaked at million bpd two weeks ago but are expected to keep rising
no definitive data are available on how much crude the united states can export though analysts estimate a nationwide capacity of million to million bpd
most terminal operators and companies do not disclose capacity and the energy department does not track it
so far export capacity is keeping pace but we are walking a tightrope said bernadette johnson vice president at drillinginfo
that capacity may begin to be tested next month as sinopec asia s largest refiner bought a record million barrels or about bpd of crude to load in june two sources with knowledge of the matter said on wednesday
for the last six months of available data ending in february the united states only exported about bpd to china
analysts are concerned about how quickly the crude terminals at gulf coast ports many initially designed for imports can shift to handling exports
only the louisiana offshore oil port can handle supertanker exports but it only started testing in february
the supertankers known as vlccs or very large crude carriers can handle some million barrels of oil the amount preferred by asian buyers with bigger ports
there s only one dock on the gulf coast that can handle a vlcc deepwater and that s loop
and the loop has only started to export said sandy fielden director of research in commodities and energy at morningstar
port of corpus christi in texas is developing its harbor island port which will accommodate vlccs per year said jarl pedersen chief commercial officer at the port with a targeted completion of late
kpler a cargo tracking service on thursday estimated that up to million bpd can be moved from the top ports of corpus christi houston port arthur and new orleans
their estimate in october was million bpd
pira energy group put the overall crude export capacity at million bpd while morningstar s estimate is million bpd at most
in addition to port constraints inadequate pipeline space has created a glut of supply in west texas pushing the principle cash grade there to a discount to benchmark crude futures this month the biggest in years
the constraint is really the pipeline coming down from the permian to corpus christi said pedersen
however the ship channel still needs to be deepened a million project in development with the army corps of engineers
