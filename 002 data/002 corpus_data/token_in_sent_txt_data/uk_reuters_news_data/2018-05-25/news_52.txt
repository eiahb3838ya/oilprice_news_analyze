update 3-brazil truckers suspend strike, govt to subsidize diesel prices
brasilia reuters brazil s government struck a deal with truck drivers on thursday to suspend a protest that crippled swathes of the latin america s largest economy promising changes to diesel pricing that could leave it footing a billion reais billion bill this year
truckers agreed to immediately suspend the strike for days government ministers told reporters appearing alongside representatives of truckers groups
we need all of you truckers to get back to work
brazil needs you said eliseu padilha president michel temer s chief of staff while announcing the deal at the presidential palace in brasilia
urgency to broker a solution mounted as lack of deliveries led to perishable items disappearing from store shelves fuel shortages threatening airports and public transport and the country s automakers association anfavea announcing that all vehicle production had been halted for friday
the accord could leave the government with a bill of up to billion reais a year to compensate oil company petroleo brasileiro sa for any losses under a scheme to stabilize prices according to government ministers
under the deal a price cut for diesel announced by petrobras on wednesday will be extended to days with the government compensating the company for costs beyond the originally announced period
the price will then be every days replacing the policy of daily price changes finance minister eduardo guardia said at the news conference
petrobras will be compensated by brazil s treasury when the set price for diesel falls below the refinery price he said estimating a cost of million reais a month until the end of the year
petrobras shares plunged percent earlier in the day after the firm initially slashed diesel prices raising investor concerns of a return to government interference in the company that saw it run up huge losses and debts under dilma rousseff
petrobras said in a statement that the accord was highly positive and an unquestionable gain for the the company said the reimbursement provided by the government would fully preserve the company s pricing policy
as the strike lifts the country will not return to normal immediately
truckers group abcam said prior to the accord that it would take up to days to normalize cargo deliveries in brazil once demonstrations end
abcam a major force behind the strike did not sign onto the government accord differing from many other truckers groups
changes proposed in the accord which also includes tax cuts on diesel will still require congressional approval
lawmakers are expected to take up the measures next week
participation in the demonstrations had swollen to around a million truck drivers as trucking companies joined the movement kicked off by independent truck owners according to abcam
the group said there were about blockades in of brazilian states
the toll also mounted in industries from automaking and meat processing to aviation and agribusiness as the protests froze deliveries of fuel feed and other essential inputs threatening economic activity and exports of soft commodities
poultry and pork processors association abpa said plants had halted production for lack of feed and storage space up from previously
at paranaguá port brazil s grain export hub the protests impeded trucks from delivering goods over two days brazil s largest cooperative coamo agroindustrial said on thursday
brazil s top coffee exporter cooxupé on thursday warned foreign clients about possible shipping delays due to the truckers protests
brazil s weak recovery from the deepest recession in decades could have been damaged if protests had lasted weeks according to a senior member of the government s economic team on condition of anonymity
prior to the accord automakers association anfavea announced plans for all car production to halt starting friday with the sector accounting for roughly percent of brazil s industrial output alone potentially dealing a major blow to the economy
