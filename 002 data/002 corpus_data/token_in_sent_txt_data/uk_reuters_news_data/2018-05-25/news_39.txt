india's ongc to quadruple output from bay of bengal gas field that cost $1 bln
ongc expects to quadruple deendayal output by january gas output from field could grow to mln cubic metres a day increase to give ongc straight year of gas output gain by promit mukherjee mumbai may reuters india s exploration company oil and natural gas corp will by early quadruple the output from an offshore gas block in the bay of bengal that it spent a billion dollars on last year according to a senior ongc official
output from the deendayal natural gas block off india s east coast will reach as high as a million standard cubic metres per day by january according to rajesh kakkar head of ongc s offshore division
ongc bought the deendayal field in from company gujarat state petroleum corp gspc while it was still undergoing test runs for commercial gas production
the increase in production is marginal against india s total consumption although kakkar said the field has a potential to go up to million cubic metres a day which would make up about percent of ongc s total output
the project will also help us in developing the adjoining gas fields in the kg basin at lesser capex capital expenditure and time said kakkar
ongc and reliance industries ltd along with partner bp plc are developing several natural gas discoveries in the kg basin
these discoveries could contribute up to million cubic metres of daily output or about a third of india s current demand
ongc which meets up to percent of india s total natural gas demand had been saddled with ageing fields and dropping production for almost a decade
but the company registered a marginal jump in production in fiscal and then production increased by another percent last year in the year through march
analysts said the increase in output from the deendayal field will help ongc in clocking an increased overall output in the current fiscal year as well
the deendayal gas field was discovered in
the project was a flagship gas initiative of indian prime minister narendra modi who at the time was chief minister of gujarat state on india s west coast
modi said then that the field held up to trillion cubic feet billion cubic meters of natural gas although delays and cost overruns in developing the field had some analysts questioning the quality of the investment for ongc
ongc however will be able to monetise the gas at a higher price and with more marketing freedom under new rules meant to encourage the development of frontier offshore reserves
prime minister modi has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in india s energy mix to percent by from percent now
modi also wants to cut down on energy imports especially crude oil
india consumed around million cubic metres of natural gas a day nearly percent of it imported in
the government has projected india s potential demand at nearly million cubic metres of gas a day
