dotted along one of the most important trade routes for oil tankers heading from the middle east to europe the ports also vital entry points for yemen s food imports and aid are too strategic to lose
gulf government officials familiar with uae and saudi thinking said capturing the coast would block the houthi supply lines and push them towards the negotiating table
maintaining that military presence would be a key condition for any political resolution of the conflict they said
saudi arabia and uae are very worried about iran s influence so they are seeking to keep some military presence on the yemeni coasts even if the civil war ends said a yemeni official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation

they now want to take control of hodeidah which handles the bulk of yemen s imports including fuel medicine and aid saying the houthis are using the port to smuggle weapons from the sunni coalition s shi ite iran
the houthis a predominantly shi ite community from the mountainous north deny they are being helped by iran
