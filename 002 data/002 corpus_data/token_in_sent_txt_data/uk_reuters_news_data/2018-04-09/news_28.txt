adds details background brussels april reuters ukraine s energy firm naftogaz will go to court to try to seize gazprom s assets in europe after the russian energy firm failed to make a payment ordered by an international tribunal naftogaz s deputy chief said on monday
gazprom is refusing to pay naftogaz more than billion under a stockholm arbitration ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside ukraine s broader political with russia
for us it s clear that they won t do that pay so we will start arresting their gas and other assets of gazprom in europe not in ukraine
we will go to courts in europe natogaz s chief commercial officer yuri vitrenko told reuters in brussels
however naftogaz will not seek to seize russian gas transiting through ukraine to european clients he added saying we don t want to create any kind of political ambiguity here in the eu that ukraine is not a reliable transit gazprom is appealing against the stockholm ruling and is seeking to cancel a gas transit contract with ukraine escalating a dispute which the european union says could threaten gas flows
naftogaz said it expected talks with gazprom later this week to be the last before it files fresh complaints with the stockholm arbitration tribunal
among other issues it wants compensation for gazprom s refusal to supply gas this winter
the eu and western clients had hoped the stockholm arbitration would resolve one of the many thorny disputes between kiev and moscow
instead the two sides are raising the stakes amid tricky discussions over future gas transits through ukraine when the current contract expires at the end of
vitrenko said it was likely gazprom would entirely halt gas flows through ukraine them through two major new pipelines to the north and south
it is absolutely likely that in there will be no transits through ukraine and gazprom will be okay in terms of meeting their minimal contractual obligations he said
we know that mr putin wants to punish ukraine and that s why he will do reporting by alissa de carbonnel adecar editing by bartunek and mark potter
