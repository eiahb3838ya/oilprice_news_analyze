update 3-kinder morgan halts most work on disputed canada pipeline expansion
ottawa reuters kinder morgan canada on sunday suspended most work on a c billion billion oil pipeline expansion that has become the focus of protests a move underscoring uncertainty over major energy projects in canada
company chairman steve kean said he would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of the trans mountain pipeline which takes crude from alberta s oil sands to a facility in the pacific province of british columbia unless the various legal challenges could be resolved by may
the announcement was a blow to the liberal government of prime minister justin trudeau which approved the project and says it is in the national interest
the project considered crucial for an oil industry hit by transportation bottlenecks is fiercely opposed by british columbia s new democratic government many municipalities some aboriginal groups and environmental activists concerned about possible oil spills
we will be judicious in our use of shareholder funds
in keeping with that commitment we have determined that in the current environment we will not put kml shareholders at risk on the remaining project spend kean said in a statement
the firm is currently carrying out preliminary work and has not started construction
many in the energy industry are concerned about whether any new pipelines can be built in canada which sits on the world s third largest proven reserves of crude and is the single largest exporter of energy to the united states
although the federal government has the power to approve major pipelines the provinces enjoy broad responsibility for resource development
that can result in deadlock when a province opposes a decision made by ottawa
this is not good
i think the key point is it shows a lack of confidence in our political and regulatory system said tim pickering president of auspice capital in calgary alberta
last october transcanada corp abandoned its c billion energy east pipeline from alberta to the atlantic coast amid mounting regulatory hurdles
the inability to get oil to ports for export means canadian crude has been trading at a discount of up to a barrel this year costing alberta s heavy oil producers c million to c million in revenue per day
federal natural resources minister jim carr said in a statement that with all our partners we continue to consider all available alberta premier rachel notley said she was very optimistic the project would go ahead and repeated calls on trudeau s government to do more to ensure it would be built
alberta is prepared to be an investor in the pipeline
if we take that step we will be a significantly more determined investor this pipeline will be built she told reporters
trudeau visited the oil sands on friday and reiterated the government s determination that the expansion go ahead
british columbia s government proposed environmental rules this year that were seen as a direct attack on the project
it later edged back from a pledge to block increased shipments of crude oil through the province which had sparked a trade war with alberta
british columbians expect their government to stand up for their interests and our coast and to do everything we can to protect our land and waters our coastal communities and our local economies premier john horgan said in a statement
mike hudema climate campaigner with greenpeace canada said the writing is on the wall and even kinder morgan can read it
investors should note that the opposition to this project is strong deep and gets bigger by the additional reporting by julie gordon in vancouver and bhanu pratap in bengaluru editing by david gregorio and peter cooney
