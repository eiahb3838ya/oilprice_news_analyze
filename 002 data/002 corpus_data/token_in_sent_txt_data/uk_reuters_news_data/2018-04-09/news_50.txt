rpt-analysis-offshore oil industry suppliers fight to be fit for frugal future
repeats story published on friday oil firms see big profits offshore suppliers struggle turn to offshore wind modification of platforms will continue to keep costs under control services index vs crude by nerijus adomaitis stord norway april reuters rising more than metres above the sea statoil s aasta hansteen platform towers over the stord shipyard in western norway representing the height of engineering in the offshore oil sector
it will probably be the last platform of its kind to leave here
nearby is what the future is more likely to hold for yard owner kvaerner the rusty njord a platform which it built two decades ago is back for a refit so it can continue production in the north sea for another years
oil companies posted bumper profits in the fourth quarter benefiting from rising crude prices and cost cuts made during the slump years between and but they have made it clear in recent months that they will not let costs rise again
for statoil this has meant calling time on giant oil platforms and instead looking to build more modest installations and where possible revamp existing infrastructure
for hundreds of suppliers from oil services firms to rig owners or engineering companies this means coming to terms with the fact that industry spending may not rebound as it has after previous downturns
as well as cutting their own costs further they must adapt by finding alternative sources of revenue in the norwegian sector one of the world biggest offshore markets and viewed as a global bellwether
for kvaerner which like many peers relies on statoil for much of its revenue the focus is to expand business areas that are currently small but which it expects to offer the best paths to growth in the new industry reality
these activities include decommissioning and recycling platforms refitting existing ones and building smaller unmanned platforms the company said in its report last month
in the traditional oil platform market we expect that it will level out in the short term but decline over the longer term kvaerner cfo idar eikrem told reuters
at the stord yard set in a fjord surrounded by mountains kvaerner cut its cost base by percent during the oil market slump but that might not be enough
we still need to chase cost cuts even now
we are competitive now but we will not be tomorrow if we keep on charging as we used to say steinar roegenes the yard s managing director told reuters
the writing is on the wall globally
last year out of offshore projects sanctioned by oil companies worldwide were expansions of brownfield sites that have already been developed rather than new projects according to a report published on thursday by energy consultancy woodmackenzie
the consultancy did not provide comparative figure for previous years but said it was seeing significantly smaller projects alongside a greater appetite for brownfield and expansion projects
not only are these projects less risky than greenfield developments they also tend to be less and are quicker to bring onstream offering a quicker payback and better returns on development dollars the consultancy said
we should continue to see operators favouring a leaner and meaner path in like kvaerner other offshore suppliers are also diversifying in norway
oil services firm aker solutions bought a percent stake in principle power which builds foundations for floating offshore windmills for an undisclosed sum in february with a view to increase it to percent at the end of the year
we see a major opportunity in offshore floating wind where demand is growing in the transition to a future aker solutions ceo luis araujo said
subsea which specialises in building and laying oil and gas installations on the seabed is expanding into renewables by installing offshore wind farms
it is bidding for tenders installing offshore wind mills in britain germany france among others following its work installing the turbines of the beatrice wind farm scotland s largest offshore wind park
in the medium to long term the renewable business is without any doubt a growing business subsea ceo jean cahuzac said on a call with analysts on march
any shifts by statoil have huge repercussions in norway where it dominates an offshore oil sector which accounts for more than jobs and has an annual turnover in the region of billion
kvaerner for example relied on the oil major for about percent of its billion norwegian crowns million revenue last year
aker solutions which drew more than half of its billion crowns revenue from norway said statoil was one of its top clients
statoil said in february said new types of offshore installations could reduce capital spending by percent and operating costs by percent compared to conventional oil platforms meaning less money for suppliers
that spells an end to behemoths like aasta hansteen which is the world s largest platform and has a cylindrical hull most of which is submerged
the aasta hansteen platform was decided in margareth oevrum statoil s head of technology projects and drilling told reuters during a visit to the platform
had we decided it today we would have built it norwegian crowns additional reporting by liz hampton in houston editing by gwladys fouche and pravin char
