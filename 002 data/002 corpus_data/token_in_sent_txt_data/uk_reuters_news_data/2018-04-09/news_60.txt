australian pm loses 30th straight poll, faces leadership pressure
sydney reuters australian prime minister malcolm turnbull s coalition government on monday lost a straight major opinion poll a symbolic defeat that intensifies pressure on him after he used the same milestone to oust his predecessor
the latest widely watched newspoll published in the australian newspaper showed the coalition trailing the opposition labor party on a preferred basis a margin that would deliver turnbull an election defeat
although australia is a year away from a general election the newspoll leaves turnbull facing questions about his future
three australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since dumped by colleagues after their popularity began to wane
once widely popular turnbull has fallen out of favour after a wave of scandals including the resignation of his former deputy after revelations he was expecting a child with his former press secretary and an eligibility crisis that saw the government temporarily lose its parliamentary majority
a surge by minor parties and factions of his own party has forced turnbull to embrace conservative policies damaging his reputation as a liberal
there was some good news for the embattled leader with a poll published by the australian financial review over the weekend showing that many australians have grown weary of a leadership
some percent of those surveyed said they wanted turnbull to remain prime minister
senior government lawmakers have also backed turnbull
malcolm turnbull retains the confidence of the vast majority of our party room foreign minister julie bishop deputy leader of the liberal party told sky news
even former prime minister and party leader tony abbott ousted by turnbull in september and who has led much of the criticism of him set a conciliatory tone
the point i d make is that we shouldn t obsess over polls
i never did
i don t think that others should abbott told reporters in victoria state
however abbott took the opportunity to sharpen his criticism of the government s refusal to build a power station
australia s electricity supply business has becomes a hot political issue following a string of blackouts and price spikes
we should be the party of low power prices and that means more power generation abbott said
