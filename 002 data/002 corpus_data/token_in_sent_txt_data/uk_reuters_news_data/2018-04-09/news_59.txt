analysis-obesity among asia-pacific children is a growing health crisis - researchers
kuala lumpur april thomson reuters foundation obesity rates among children in are rising at a rapid rate and more action is needed to encourage healthier lifestyles and ease pressure on fledgling healthcare systems researchers said
the number of overweight children under five rose percent between and in the region and the problem is growing said sridhar dharmapuri a food safety and nutrition officer at the s food and agriculture organization fao in bangkok
the rate of growth in obesity in is higher than in many other countries dharmapuri told the thomson reuters foundation
while the united states leads the way on obesity rates the number of overweight children in is rising rapidly and many countries in this region are now among the most in the adult obesity rates are highest in the united states mexico new zealand and hungary and lowest in japan and south korea according to a report on member states by the organization for economic and development
but the rapid rise in obesity among young people in is worrying because overweight children are at higher risk of becoming obese as adults and then developing serious health problems like type diabetes high blood pressure and liver disease
malaysia indonesia singapore and thailand are among the most overweight countries in southeast asia while samoa tonga and nauru are the most overweight in the pacific
australia also has high rates of obesity
many of these nations are also struggling to tackle malnutrition among their citizens
the cost to the region of citizens being overweight or obese is billion a year a recent report by the asian development bank institute adbi said
rising wealth levels over the last years have played a major role in the rise in obesity levels researchers say
the region has undergone economic growth so food has become available at a relatively cheaper price said matthias helble an economist at the adbi in tokyo
for the last years the economic growth has been almost uninterrupted said helble who has researched obesity levels in the region for three years
the obesity time bomb will be discussed by the member governments attending the fao conference for asia and the pacific which starts in fiji from monday
in addition to consuming more as economies have grown people in have moved away from farming into manufacturing and then to service sector jobs which are more sedentary researchers said
cities in have also seen unprecedented growth over the last two decades this year more than half the region s population will for the first time be urban the united nations has estimated
in can spend hours commuting due to poor transport systems and infrastructure and when they finally reach home they have little time to cook
many opt to eat out
this new lifestyle has caused a rise in the consumption of convenience and processed foods which often contain excess fats and more salt and sugar researchers said
people in the region also struggle to maintain a balanced diet said dharmapuri with meals often lacking vegetables
the diet is largely he said
on anybody s plate rice takes up between percent of the when people are overweight they often suffer from other health problems economists said and this is likely to put pressure on public healthcare systems that are only just being established in many nations
absenteeism from work is also higher among obese people said helble adding that overweight people often die earlier than those who lead healthy lives so have a shorter productive life
the term obesogenic environment has been used to describe an environment that promotes obesity among individuals and populations elizabeth ingram of the australian institute of health and welfare a government statistics agency said by email
it includes physical economic political and sociocultural fixing the problem will likely take years and researchers said a joint effort by business and governments was needed
better labeling on foods to promote healthier options education about healthier diets and lifestyles and even healthier school meals would improve the situation analysts said
being obese can also be seen as a sign of prosperity because you have enough food to show your wealth through the fact that you have a lot to eat said helble
sugar taxes which have been introduced or are being discussed in the philippines singapore and indonesia are also one way to change people s mindset he added
building more sports facilities at schools and ensuring urban planners include recreational areas for cities and make them more walkable and less polluted is also crucial
governments must work with retailers like in singapore to create a coordinated approach on packaging and promote a balanced diet researchers said
working with retailers to ban unhealthy and sweet foods from checkout areas and pushing street vendors to switch from fried foods to healthier more traditional options are also key
and countries should adopt a farm to fork approach which encourages farmers to diversify what they grow and be less reliant on growing just rice said dharmapuri
in some pacific island countries it actually easier to buy soft drinks and processed foods than buy fruits and vegetables said dharmapuri
it almost a delicacy to have a vegetable in a restaurant
