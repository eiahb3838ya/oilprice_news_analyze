top iraq court set to rule on kurdistan region's oil exports
baghdad april reuters iraq s top court will begin hearings in may on the legality of oil exports from kurdistan which are at the centre of a row between the region and baghdad
the oil dispute is the main hurdle to normalising relations between the central government and the kurdistan regional government krg of northern iraq which conducted an october referendum on independence despite baghdad s opposition
the supreme federal court said in a statement on monday it has asked to hear the opinions of officials including the central government s prime minister oil minister and finance minister in addition to the krg s prime minister on may
iraqi oil minister jabar had asked the court to issue a ruling that bans independent oil exports from the krg which started in through a pipeline across turkey
the krg says the iraqi constitution recognises the legality of its existence and contains no article specifically forbidding it from developing oil resources on its territory
international energy firms including exxon mobil dno dana gas rosneft and genel are among companies with agreements with the krg to operate in the kurdistan region
