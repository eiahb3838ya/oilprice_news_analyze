analysis-high u.s. natgas storage draws raise alarm for coming seasons
reuters natural gas prices could rise in after utilities pulled the second biggest amount of gas from storage on record over the winter even though the season was slightly warmer than normal
that left total stockpiles about percent below usual at the end of the heating season on march and will require companies to add percent more gas than usual into storage this summer just to get inventories back to normal levels before next winter
some analysts think the market is putting too much weight on rising production to refill inventories this year and is not worried enough about a projected increase in domestic demand and exports
we feel the current market has become far too complacent and that prices are simply too low to account for demand growth and the amount of gas needed in storage for the next winter heating season martin king director institutional research at gmp firstenergy in calgary said in a recent report
prices for gas at the henry hub benchmark in louisiana have averaged less than per million british thermal units mmbtu since versus more than over the prior years and are expected to remain below through at least based on current futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange
if prices were to stay at their current level over the course of the summer that would boost coal to gas switching
we see prices having to move closer to this summer in order to lower these power burn levels and allow adequate storage refills ahead of winter analysts at barclays a bank said in a recent note
electric companies can switch between burning more gas or coal in power plants depending on which fuel is cheaper
utilities likely pulled billion cubic feet bcf of gas from inventories during the heating season according to a poll of analysts by reuters the most since the polar vortex winter of and the second highest on record
one billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about million homes for a day
analysts forecast total inventories by the end of october the start of the next heating season will rise to bcf compared with bcf last year a level that should be of increasing concern to the market king at gmp firstenergy said
if the amount of gas in storage on is below normal a cold winter could cut inventories to below bcf by the end of march
that would be the smallest amount of gas in storage since the end of march despite expected record production
dry gas production is projected to rise to an high of billion cubic feet per day bcfd in but consumption is also expected to hit an high of bcfd in
with exports rising to record highs as well it does not leave a lot of extra gas to go into storage
