update 4-nigerian president buhari to seek re-election in 2019
abuja reuters nigeria s president muhammadu buhari confirmed on monday he will seek another term in elections next year ending months of speculation about his future after bouts of ill health
the said he would seek his party s presidential ticket to contest elections in february during a closed door meeting of the national executive committee of his all progressives congress apc party
he flew to britain for talks with prime minister theresa may a few hours later
the announcement by buhari a northern muslim who became the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent at the ballot box was widely expected although stocks on the nigerian market fell percent on monday to a low
it takes away the concern of an open race which would have fuelled uncertainty said a equity sales analyst
the bond market shrugged off the announcement with the benchmark debt unchanged at percent from its previous session after one trade on wednesday traders said
buhari took office in may after vowing to improve security and crackdown on endemic corruption but africa s top oil producer fell into its first recession in years in largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks in the niger delta and its recovery remains fragile
after spending five months in britain last year being treated for an undisclosed ailment opposition groups in africa s most populous nation and other critics said he was unfit for office and his administration was beset by inertia
if buhari is selected to contest the presidential election it is not clear whom he would face
the people s democratic party pdp which prior to the former general s victory had held power since nigeria adopted civilian rule in has yet to select a candidate
the president said he was responding to the clamour by nigerians to recontest in adding that he wanted to give nec the honour of notifying them first buhari s spokesman garba shehu said in an emailed statement
antony goldman of pm consulting said although buhari s party a broad coalition of groups which largely united to oust the pdp was riven by divisions it was nevertheless likely that he would become the apc candidate
with the pdp weak and still discredited incumbency is still a powerful factor said goldman
it would be a huge surprise if he was not the apc s candidate and the candidate to beat in goldman added
atiku abubakar a former vice president and erstwhile buhari ally quit the apc in november and rejoined the pdp
he is the most high profile figure to say he is prepared to run in
the pdp in a statement described the president s announcement as an internal affair within the ruling party
until he becomes the candidate of the apc we will not spend precious time on his mere show of interest said spokesman kola ologbondiyan
nigeria s political parties must select their presidential election candidates by
buhari led a military regime that was overthrown in a coup in
his election victory three years ago was in large part due to his military credentials and his vow to end the islamist militant boko haram insurgency
the insurgents have lost most of the territory the size of belgium that they held in northeast nigeria in late but continue suicide bomb attacks and kidnappings in the northeast
other security challenges militant attacks in the niger delta oil production heartland as well as communal violence between nomadic herdsmen and settled farmers plus a resurgence of separatist sentiments have flared up during his tenure
