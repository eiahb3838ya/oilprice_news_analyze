update 1-judge denies trump's ex-campaign manager manafort's bid to loosen bail terms
washington reuters a federal judge on monday denied president donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort s latest request to loosen the terms of his bail conditions saying some of the assets he offered to post as collateral are too tied up and can not be used to meet a million bond obligation
the denial by amy berman jackson a district court judge for the district of columbia means that manafort will for now continue to remain on house arrest and be required to wear an electronic monitoring device
manafort is facing two indictments in different federal courts brought by special counsel robert mueller as part of mueller s probe into russian interference in the election
manafort is accused of a wide range of offences from conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent in connection with his lobbying for the ukrainian government to bank fraud and filing false tax returns
he has pleaded not guilty to all charges
but since manafort s arrest last october he has struggled to come up with million in assets he can post as a bond in exchange for lifting his house arrest conditions
that is because some of the homes he offered to pledge are already posted as collateral for other mortgage loans such as his condo in alexandria virginia
the judge on monday said he is no longer able to post one of his new york properties because it is now tied to pending bank fraud charges against him in the other case in the eastern district of virginia
those bank fraud charges are not under the jurisdiction of this court and could give rise to remedies outside of this court s control she wrote
she also said he was not allowed to post funds from a bank account owned by his daughter and andrea and christopher shand
she noted that the account has already been seized and that a of it is neither the defendant nor a blood relative of the jackson said that manafort can try once again to resubmit a new package that is valued at million and contains unencumbered assets
russia has denied meddling in the election although american intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded that was the case
president donald trump has repeatedly denied there was any collusion between his election campaign and russia
