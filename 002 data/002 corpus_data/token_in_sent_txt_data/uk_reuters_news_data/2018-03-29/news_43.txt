column-china's crude oil futures contract should confound the sceptics: kemp

the views expressed are his own by john kemp london march reuters china s new crude oil futures contract which began trading this week has a good chance of confounding the doubters and becoming a regional benchmark where other contracts have failed
the history of futures and options trading is littered with new contracts launched amid great fanfare but which subsequently failed to develop sufficient liquidity and have been discontinued or faded into irrelevance
but the new crude futures contract launched on the shanghai international energy exchange comes after years of meticulous preparation and has many of the ingredients needed to be successful
three elements determine the success or failure of a new futures contract according to an extensive literature review prepared for the shanghai futures exchange three years ago
the contract must fulfil a commercial need for hedging
it must succeed in attracting a pool of speculators
and public policy must not be too adverse why some futures contracts succeed and others fail till
china s new oil futures contract clearly meets the first two criteria and has a fair chance of succeeding on the third as well
china has already overtaken the united states to become the world s largest crude importer so there is a clear need to hedge the resulting price risks
the need for a new contract and its basic features were showcased two years ago in a presentation by china s leading crude importer review of current and potential asian oil benchmarks unipec
china s refiners import mostly medium and heavy sour crudes which trade at a substantial discount to lighter and sweeter oils
the two main existing benchmarks brent and light sweet crude also known as wti are based on light crude oils
in contrast the new shanghai futures contract is based on a basket of medium and heavy crudes from the middle east and china itself with a significantly higher sulphur content
the new futures contract approximates the sort of crudes that china is importing much more closely than brent or wti
foreign crudes deliverable against the contract include oils from the united arab emirates oman and iraq which all trade freely
but they also closely resemble other grades china imports in significant volumes including crude from saudi arabia iran and russia
the new contract is denominated in yuan rather than dollars allowing refiners to manage their price risks more effectively
the contract should have no difficulty in attracting a pool of speculators to provide liquidity since china has a large number of domestic traders and brokers familiar with commodity markets
china has already launched several highly successful contracts including steel iron ore and copper all of which have become liquid benchmarks
there is a large community of domestic speculators and a network of brokerages which should help the new contract succeed
china has many of the network characteristics that have made chicago new york london and singapore successful futures trading hubs
the biggest source of uncertainty surrounds the attitude of the government towards price volatility and its willingness to allow fairly unrestricted futures trading
china s government has not always been comfortable with extreme price swings and high levels of speculative activity and has periodically intervened in the markets
but the same impulses have been seen in other futures trading centres at least historically and china s regulatory interventions have not prevented the successful development of contracts for other commodities
given china s increasing dependence on crude imports and ambition to be a global financial centre the government has a strong strategic interest in ensuring the new contract becomes a successful benchmark
the new crude contract has some distinctive characteristics and restrictions that have drawn adverse comment china aims to challenge brent wti oil with crude futures launch reuters march
there are strict limits on the number of cancelled orders to curb spoofing but which may deter traders
trading is restricted to three distinct periods each day rather than being nearly continuous and there will be lengthy periods during national holidays
but most of these restrictions have a sound rationale including concentrating liquidity and they are likely to be relaxed as the contract becomes more established
none of them appears likely to deter liquidity
china s new crude futures are unlikely to displace the brent and wti light sweet benchmarks in the united states and europe
but they have a fair chance of successfully becoming a regional benchmark for the medium and heavy sour crudes favoured by refiners in asia shanghai crude futures complete globalisation of oil markets reuters march
