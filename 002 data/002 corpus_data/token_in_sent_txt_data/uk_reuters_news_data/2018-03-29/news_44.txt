insight-u.s.-trained engineer takes on algeria's energy monolith
oran algeria reuters when the ceo of algeria s state energy company sonatrach ended a speech to staff by seeking questions an executive sitting next to him quickly picked up the microphone
there are no questions he said and some employees filed straight out
the scene revealed the scale of the challenge facing abdelmoumen ould kadour who took over sonatrach a year ago with a mission to improve communication and transparency in a company that is central to stability in algeria and beyond
sonatrach funds percent of the state budget and falling oil prices have created pressure for change while algeria s role as a major gas supplier to europe means new tension between the continent and gas giant russia could play into his hands
he will soon unveil a plan to lift stagnant output and has revived ties with european oil majors
but project delays fraud scandals secrecy and red tape abound in a country where adults remember civil war and change is often resisted
it s hopeless he confided to colleagues accompanying him to the company office in the northwestern city of oran one of dozens of such visits by the alumnus of mit and harvard to sonatrach outposts witnessed by reuters
on his first day he said on another occasion he was given so much paperwork to sign he feared he would do little else
there was no medium and long term strategy there was no communication no coordination between sonatrach s executives every single piece of information was no stranger to setbacks he spent two years in an algerian jail for collaborating with foreigners after a decade in charge of a joint engineering company by oil services firm halliburton
he has brought in his own team to lead the revamp at sonatrach declining requests for an interview but sharing his views during his tour of the company
a company source said his turnaround plan would be unveiled within weeks if not days
designed partly to attract foreign investment it is likely to come during or before a conference he hosts on april which the ceos of france s total italy s eni and norway s are expected to attend
his broad goal is to turn sonatrach into an integrated energy company by from its current sprawling state which includes an aircraft maker and extensive social programmes and excludes renewables which come under the environment ministry
while western ceos will expect concrete steps after years of bold announcements the plan has spread unease among executives several of whom told reuters they feared sweeping management changes in ould kadour s declared battle with red tape
in oran he told staff that statoil set to resume work at the hassi mouina gas field had previously left because of bureaucracy
better communication a better environment is key to convince foreign partners to work in algeria he said
a sonatrach source said statoil is expected to invest mln in gas a figure described by a statoil source as speculation
last month statoil and britain s bp agreed to strengthen cooperation in upstream oil exploration and explore solar energy to allow algeria to export more of its gas
in december ould kadour revived ties in december with total eni and saipem but his ability to nurture those relationships and reverse years of stalling production will depend on how his company s employees respond to his message of change
he is an unlikely manager in a country known for secrecy and a suspicion of westerners dating from ties to the soviet union and the trauma of the independence war with france
but energy revenues have halved since and president abdelaziz bouteflika the old leader who might run for a fifth term next year is struggling to maintain a welfare state necessary for social stability
the government has launched austerity measures banning the import of goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects
doctors and teachers have been on strike in several cities for three months demanding better pay and conditions and the state has been unable to end dissent by paying out as it did when a barrel of crude cost instead of as now
this has turned improving the efficiency of the state oil company into a political imperative
ould kaddour has no choice but to succeed as sonatrach s ceo a former energy minister told reuters
critics of the ceo say he has only been appointed because of bouteflika and will last no longer than his many predecessors
if bouteflika quits ould kaddour would be sacked in the next five minutes a former sonatrach executive said
with the presidential election looming ould kadour has sought to cut algeria s import bill by recruiting oil trader vitoil to swap crude for the petrol in growing need at home
the strategy was to show that algeria which is a big oil producer is not spending gigantic sums on imports of products an oil insider said
one delayed gas field was brought online last year with three more slated to start producing this year lifting annual gas output of billion cubic metres by billion cubic metres
sonatrach has signed a billion deal with turkey to build a petrochemical facility discovered crude in niger and explored cooperation with iraq
it is also considering shale but protests in from algerians fearing environmental damage have made that politically unpalatable for now
in further signs of a balancing act company sources say sonatrach will offer more flexible gas contracts on terms of years or less instead of and invest million in the tinhert gas field project using algerian firms
ould kadour s sentencing by a military court in on charges working for a foreign country was part of an internal regime conflict typical for algeria observers say
an elite made up of the ruling fln party army and security has controlled algeria since independence with officials or executives of state firms sometimes losing jobs when a new faction takes over in power plays behind closed doors
after serving his jail term he worked in qatar france senegal and the united arab emirates before bouteflika made him sonatrach ceo in march
anis rahmani owner of private ennahar tv station said the ceo had told him he was devastated by being branded a traitor
but the man has vision a plan to transform the company into a modern and performing one which is not the case now he said
he is more powerful than the energy minister one insider said but must also win backing from politicians resistant to opening up the country too much
a key energy law has been stalled for years but a draft is now due in july
it is likely to retain sonatrach s majority stake in all energy projects but offer tax incentives for investors a sonatrach executive said
the law needs to be attractive he said
