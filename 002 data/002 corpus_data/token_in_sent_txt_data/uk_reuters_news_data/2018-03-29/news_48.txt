frustrated with trump, green group goes local with clean energy campaign
reuters environmental group the league of conservation voters on thursday launched a million campaign to press this year s candidates for state and local office to embrace clean energy citing a lack of leadership on the issue in washington
the effort seeks to tap into increasing leadership on climate change since president donald trump took office on a vow to roll back environmental regulation and promote fossil fuels production
change is happening at the state level bill holland state policy director for the league of conservation voters lcv said in an interview
what we want to do is get elected officials and local officials committed to big clean energy holland said the clean energy for all campaign will seek to secure commitments from local candidates for office to move their states to percent clean energy and support ballot initiatives to expand their renewable energy portfolios
many mayors and governors are already implementing policies to counterbalance the trump administration s rejection of initiatives to curb carbon emissions which trump has said would cost trillions of dollars with little tangible benefit
lcv said its strategy appeared to work last year when it pushed new jersey candidates for governor to make clean energy commitments
democrat phil murphy who ultimately won committed during the campaign to move the garden state toward percent clean energy
holland said the clean energy effort is also aided by the fact that the cost of wind and solar energy has fallen in recent years making those technologies competitive with electricity fueled by coal or natural gas
we are in this whole new world where clean energy makes sense regardless of your politics and regardless of the discussion around climate holland said
the clean energy push comes in addition to lcv s previously announced decision to spend some million on races this election cycle to push its broader environmental agenda a figure that is nearly double its previous record for investment in local elections
the group said it will leave it up to individual state organizations to define what precisely falls under the umbrella of clean energy though fossil fuels including natural gas will be excluded
