poll-oil to rise in 2018 as opec wages tug-of-war with u.s. shale
reuters oil prices are likely to rise this year thanks to supply disruptions and an deal to limit production but doubts over the future of compliance with the multilateral agreement and rising production could stem the upward momentum a reuters poll showed on thursday
a survey of economists and analysts polled by reuters showed brent crude would average nearly a barrel in versus forecast in the february survey but below the average for the benchmark so far in
brent prices have risen percent this year supported by a deal between the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and producers led by russia to curb output by about million barrels per day bpd through
the price briefly rose above a barrel this week supported by tension in the middle east and declining output in venezuela one of the group s largest producers where economic crisis has cut production to its lowest in nearly years
a sustained drawdown in inventories also helped push the price up towards a peak last seen in december
we view it rather unlikely that opec will exit already by
however talking about a possible extension of the deal beyond we are rather sceptical hannes loacker of raiffeisen capital management said
we see a big challenge in bringing in russia once more
without russian participation the will of some other opec members may also be abating saudi arabia and russia are working on a pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years
even if opec compliance with pledged supply remains elevated through the balance of the explosive growth in shale oil supply accompanied by growth in crude oil export capacity will likely tip the balance towards lower oil prices in the second half bnp paribas analyst harry tchilinguirian said
analysts expect production to grow by at least million bpd this year
output now stands at nearly million bpd taking it past top exporter saudi arabia and within reach of biggest producer russia
the balance between strong production growth in the on the one hand and continued restraint by opec and russia on the other remains the key factor on the supply side said cailin birch an analyst at the economist intelligence unit
on the demand side emerging asia will remain the key region for new demand the international energy agency said this month that global oil demand would increase by million bpd by to million bpd boosted by economic growth in asia and a resurgent petrochemicals industry
analysts said oil prices could also be pushed up by fears of renewed sanctions on iranian oil exports after the united states threatened to withdraw from a nuclear deal
light crude will average a barrel in the poll found up from forecast in february
elsewhere the recent launch of china s oil futures which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside brent and wti made a roaring start as western players and chinese majors eagerly traded the world s newest financial oil instrument
