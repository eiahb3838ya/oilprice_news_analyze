german finance minister aims to avoid bans on diesel cars
berlin reuters germany must do all it can to avert driving bans for diesel cars the country s new finance minister said in an interview published on thursday urging cities and local communities to boost investments in charging stations for electric cars
in an interview with the funke mediengruppe newspaper chain olaf scholz expressed scepticism that changes in taxation for instance scrapping tax breaks for diesel as a fuel would speed moves by the car industry to introduce cleaner cars
he also rejected calls for the government to offer financial incentives to get more diesel cars on the road and bring down emissions in heavily polluted cities
it is the task of industry to develop vehicles that meet existing and future rules for clean air scholz told the newspaper group adding we must talk seriously about how we can get more electric cars or expand public scholz who owns a diesel car himself said he shared other drivers concerns about limited access to certain areas in the future if driving bans were imposed
we must do all we can to prevent driving bans for diesel vehicles he said
instead he said cities and local communities seeking to reduce overall emissions should build more charging stations to promote use of electric cars and buses and the car industry should accelerate its work on clean car technologies
industry must deliver now
it would be good if such a technological advance came from scholz a social democrat joined conservative transportation minister andreas scheuer and chancellor angela merkel in speaking out against comprehensive diesel driving bans
merkel last week told lawmakers she favoured tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities
