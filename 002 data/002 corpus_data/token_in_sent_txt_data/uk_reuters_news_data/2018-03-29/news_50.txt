exclusive-china taking first steps to pay for oil in yuan this year -sources
annual trade in oil worth an estimated trillion pilot could be launched as early as the second half of beijing could start with crude purchases from russia angola plan coincides with launch of chinese crude oil futures by sumeet chatterjee and meng meng hong march reuters china is taking its first steps towards paying for imported crude oil in yuan instead of the dollar three people with knowledge of the matter told reuters a key development in beijing s efforts to establish its currency internationally
shifting just part of global oil trade into the yuan is potentially huge
oil is the world s most traded commodity with an annual trade value of around trillion roughly equivalent to china s gross domestic product last year
a pilot programme for yuan payment could be launched as early as the second half of this year two of the people said
regulators have informally asked a handful of financial institutions to prepare for pricing china s crude imports in the yuan said the three sources at some of the financial firms
being the biggest buyer of oil it s only natural for china to push for the usage of yuan for payment settlement
this will also improve the yuan liquidity in the global market said one of the people briefed on the matter by chinese authorities
china is the world s oil consumer and in overtook the united states as the biggest importer of crude oil
its demand is a key determinant of global oil prices
under the plan being discussed beijing could start with purchases from russia and angola one of the people said
both like china are keen to break the dollar s global dominance
russia and angola are two of the top suppliers of crude oil to china along with saudi arabia
the move would mark a major step in reviving usage of the currency of the world s economy for offshore payments after several years of measures
if successful it could also trigger shifting other product payments to the yuan including metals and mining raw materials
all three sources who spoke to reuters on the condition that they not be named said the plans were at early stages
officials at some of china s state oil companies said they had not heard of such plans
the plans coincide with this week s launch of the first chinese crude oil futures in shanghai which many expect to become a third global price benchmark alongside brent and west texas intermediate crude
shanghai s new crude contract is traded in yuan
besides the potential of giving china more power over global oil prices this will help the chinese government in its efforts to internationalise renminbi yuan said sushant gupta research director at energy consultancy wood mackenzie
unipec trading arm of asia s largest refiner sinopec has already inked a first deal to import middle east crude priced against the shanghai crude futures contract
bank goldman sachs said in a note to clients this week that the success of shanghai s crude futures was indirectly promoting the use of the chinese people s bank of china pboc the country s central bank did not respond to a reuters request for comment on the plan
the ministry of commerce mofcom also declined to comment
china s plan to use yuan to pay for oil comes amid a more than gradual strengthening of the currency which looks set to post a fifth straight quarterly gain its longest winning streak since
the yuan retained its ranking as a domestic and global payment currency in january this year unmoved from a year ago but its share among other currencies fell to percent from percent according to industry tracker swift
a slew of measures put in place in the last years to rein in capital flowing out of the country amid a slide in yuan value has taken off some its shine as a global payment currency
but the yuan has now appreciated percent against the dollar so far this year with solid gains in recent sessions
for pboc and other regulators internationalization of the yuan is clearly one of the priorities now and if this plan goes off smoothly then they can start thinking about replicating this model for other commodities purchases said the person briefed on the matter
it would not be easy however for china to shift the bulk of its commodity purchases to the yuan because of the currency s illiquidity in forex markets
nearly percent of all transactions in the currency markets involve the dollar on one side of a trade while only percent use the yuan as per a triennial forex survey by the bank for international settlements
