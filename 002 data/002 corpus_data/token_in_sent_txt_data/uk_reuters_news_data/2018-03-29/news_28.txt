poland's president signs bill on global climate deal amendment
warsaw reuters poland became on thursday the final eu country to enact a bill ratifying the global agreement intended to provide a legal framework for reducing carbon emissions which paves the way for the entire european union to accept the accord as a bloc
polish president andrzej duda s signature on a bill ratifying the doha amendment to the kyoto protocol was the last step needed for all eu members to have separately enacted it
the eu can not enact it as a whole until all members have done so
the amendment is intended to form a legal framework for reduction efforts until when the paris climate agreement that more than nations signed in late kicks in
the doha amendment does not come into effect unless countries ratify it which states had done as of march according to the united nations
the president s office also said in a statement that poland plans to submit an extra declaration in which it will secure the right to decide on the energy sources on which it wants to rely
poland will host this year s round of climate talks in december
