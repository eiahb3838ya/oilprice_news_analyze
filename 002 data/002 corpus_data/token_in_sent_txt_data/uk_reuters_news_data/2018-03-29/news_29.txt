soup, beer and soap from food waste? dutch shoppers say yes
rome march thomson reuters foundation first it was a supermarket aisle free of plastics now the netherlands has notched up another novel solution in its fight against waste and pollution products made with food that otherwise would be chucked in the bin
soups and chutneys made from wonky vegetables beer from stale bread cider from blemished apples and soaps from discarded orange peels are selling fast in the wageningen branch of jumbo one of the biggest dutch supermarket chains
sales have surpassed expectations said george verberne an entrepreneur who runs the branch about km miles north of the capital amsterdam
we sold about items in one week
it s double what we sell for organic products he told the thomson reuters foundation in a phone interview
i m proud and very happy we re the first to do verberne and dutch companies launched the verspilling is verrukkelijk or waste is delicious initiative last week supported by a local university as part of a new national programme united against food waste
the government is aiming to halve the amount of food thrown away by its million people to become the first country in europe to meet this global development goal by
globally one third of all food produced worth nearly trillion is thrown away every year according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao
critics say this is not only unethical in a world where hunger levels are rising but also environmentally destructive
the dutch organic chain ekoplaza set up in february what it said was the world s first supermarket aisle which has led to calls for others to follow suit
the idea of selling food whose appearance does not meet supermarket standards was born when verberne saw a presentation on food waste by toine timmermans of wageningen university research and offered to help
timmermans who has worked on sustainable food issues for years asked for shelf space to showcase products made from waste and see how consumers responded
at least entrepreneurs across europe offer products using surplus food but they tend to be small and have limited impact he said in a phone interview
if you want to solve food waste and achieve sustainable food systems you need to work with people who have access to the market like retail stores he said
researchers from the university will monitor sales over the next six months to learn how best to expand the products
chantal engelen of kromkommer one of companies participating in waste is delicious said about percent of carrots get rejected because they have two legs are too big or too crooked
we buy them straight from the grower for a fair price and turn them into healthy food she said adding that their ultimate aim is to change consumer behaviour so that the reject carrots are sold in shops and kromkommer s work become obsolete
the netherlands is a small nation but it is one of the world s largest agricultural exporters
waste is delicious said it plans to expand to three more supermarkets in the next few months
timmermans is glad to see that higher pricing than established brands has not deterred customers
we can not sell for less because for the social innovators this is their source of income he said
so working together and the message by buying this you re contributing to a better world is a very important verberne believes wonky vegetables have a bright future
a lot of colleagues called me and sent me emails asking how does it work
can i also do something like this he said
i think we have to do this
