update 2-volkswagen offers to buy back new diesels if bans introduced
frankfurt reuters volkswagen will buy back new diesel cars if german cities ban them it said on thursday seeking to reassure potential buyers and stem a plunge in sales of diesel vehicles
europe s biggest automaker also said it would extend incentives for buyers of new diesel cars
the moves come after a german court ruled last month that cities in the country could ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from their streets
many german cities exceed european union limits on atmospheric nitrogen oxide known to cause respiratory diseases
fears of bans have led to a plunge in demand for diesel vehicles which are also key to carmakers attempts to meet new eu rules on carbon dioxide emissions
while diesel cars are heavily criticized for emitting nitrogen oxide they spew out less than gasoline equivalents
diesel car sales plunged percent in germany last month
at its core vw brand volkswagen said its buyback offer applied to new diesels bought between april and the end of and would kick in if the city in which the buyer lived or worked banned diesels within three years of the purchase
it said its dealerships would buy back diesel vehicles affected by bans at their current value if their owners at the same time bought a new vehicle that was not affected by cities driving restrictions
at czech brand skoda the guarantee applies to cars bought between april and the end of june but will cover bans introduced within four years of the purchase date
at premium brand audi the offer only covers leased vehicles
volkswagen also said it was extending to the end of june incentives for customers trading in older diesels for new ones
fellow german carmaker bmw said earlier this month it would offer to take back leased vehicles if diesels were banned within kilometers miles of the operator s home or place of work
there has been a global backlash against cars since volkswagen admitted in to cheating exhaust tests
but germany s government is seeking to avoid widespread bans on heavily polluting diesel vehicles which companies say could cut the resale value of up to million vehicles in europe s biggest car market
in germany where motorists expect to drive powerful cars on motorways with no speed limits any restrictions will be unpopular
yet air quality is also a big concern with green and consumer groups pushing for action
