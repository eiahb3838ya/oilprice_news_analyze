update 1-netherlands to halt gas production at groningen by 2030
the hague reuters the dutch government said on thursday it will phase out gas production at the groningen field once europe s largest by as part of efforts to reduce the danger caused by small but damaging earthquakes
production is set for billion cubic metres bcm this year already down from a peak of bcm in following a series of cuts as decades of extraction have led to dozens of earthquakes each year damaging thousands of homes and buildings
our intention is to cut production to get towards bcm in the coming four or five years and to zero at the end of the coming decade prime minister mark rutte told a press conference
a chart produced by the dutch economy ministry showed production falling to below bcm for the production year beginning october and to below bcm for the year assuming average temperatures
economy minister eric wiebes confirmed there will be reductions in both years but will not make his official decision on production until he has received advice on safety considerations this summer
wiebes said the cuts will be achieved in part by forcing large industrial users to seek other sources of energy by
in addition the netherlands is building a conversion plant to make foreign gas suitable for use in dutch systems
foreign users of dutch gas in germany and belgium will be encouraged to seek other sources and their contracts not renewed while dutch households will be incentivized to reduce gas use and switch to heating systems
dutch wholesale prices at the ttf hub were little changed after the statement both the summer and winter contracts were up less than one euro cent trading at euros per mwh and respectively
this is in the neutral to slightly bullish range said oliver sanderson a thomson reuters gas analyst of the government s base case scenario
our view for this gas year oct is around bcm
however the groningen quota should continue to be seen as low and a general cause of price spikes in cold weather he said noting that storages have been depleted after a cold winter
the government said last month that it intended to cut production at the field from current levels of bcm per year to bcm as quickly as possible after the country s northern region was hit by the strongest earthquake in years in january
