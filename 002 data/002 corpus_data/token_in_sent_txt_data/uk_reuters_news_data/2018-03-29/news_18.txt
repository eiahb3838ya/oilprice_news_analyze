exclusive-trump advisers urge him to leave biofuel reforms to congress -sources
recasts adds quote from source related content by jarrett renshaw new york march reuters president donald trump s advisers have urged him to leave biofuels policy reform efforts to congress after months of work to broker a deal between rival corn and oil industries got bogged down in dispute
the recommendation to back away underscores the difficulty of getting two key political constituencies to agree on the future of the renewable fuel standard a law that requires refiners to cover the cost of blending biofuels like ethanol into the fuel supply
the law has created a big new market for farmers but also a headache for refiners who say costs have soared in the last few years
trump s white house has hosted a series of meetings in recent months between representatives of the two sides
the meetings are aimed at finding or changes to lower the cost of the program to refiners including capping the price of blending credits refiners need to prove compliance
they follow failed efforts last year by independent refiners and billionaire investor carl icahn who owns refining company cvr energy to convince the administration to overhaul the rule unilaterally
icahn came under fire early last year during a brief period when he was advising trump as he attempted to broker a deal with the biofuels industry to change the rule
he later ended his advisory role amid charges and as those efforts produced forceful reactions from iowa lawmakers the nation s largest state
the white house efforts have further exposed gaping divisions between the corn and oil lobbies and disagreement over the solutions between integrated refiners like bp and exxonmobil and merchant refiners like pbf energy
that means any action by the white house will upset at least one faction of trump s base according to the sources who asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter
two of the sources said trump had agreed to heed his advisers recommendation to leave the issue to congress while also leaving open the option to act if congress balks
this seems like the logical place to land given all the unrest said one of the sources
the third source said it was not clear what trump would do
white house spokeswoman kelly love did not respond to a request for comment
officials at the environmental protection agency which administers the rfs and the department of agriculture also did not respond to requests for comment
epa head scott pruitt and agricultural secretary sonny perdue have been compiling a list of executive and options for trump to consider to tweak the rfs the sources said
shifting the issue to lawmakers however would put the spotlight on texas republican senator john cornyn who has been leading legislative efforts to reform the rfs
cornyn s office says it has been trying to win support from the corn and oil industries for a comprehensive reform bill that is still being drafted
underscoring the stakes merchant refiner philadelphia energy solutions filed bankruptcy in january blaming the cost of compliance for its financial woes
reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy including the withdrawal of more than million in payments from the company by its investor owners
