u.s. epa poised to announce rejection of obama vehicle fuel efficiency rules
new york reuters the environmental protection agency is expected to use a virginia car dealership on tuesday as the setting to tout its rejection of the obama administration s landmark vehicle fuel efficiency rules a move that could put automakers in the middle of a battle between the trump administration and california
epa administrator scott pruitt plans to sign a declaration by sunday that the obama administration s vehicle efficiency rules for through are not appropriate and must be revised reuters reported last week
pruitt is expected to speak at an event at a chevrolet dealership in suburban washington and will joined by groups representing dealers and automakers according to people familiar with the plans
the state of california which has the power to effectively create its own fuel economy standards several allied states and environmental groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight over the rules aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks
california air resources board chair mary nichols said in january the board does not believe the standards should be lowered
pruitt was in california earlier this week but did not meet with nichols
two administration officials and several automakers told reuters the timing of proposing specific revisions to existing fuel economy standards and emissions limits remains in flux
epa officials suggested a detailed proposal could come in late may or june while the transportation department is pushing for a speedier proposal automakers and officials said
the epa declined thursday to comment on pruitt s plans
an epa spokeswoman said last week a final determination will be signed by april automakers want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in consumer preferences to larger less vehicles
auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the obama administration in
but they have urged pruitt and president donald trump to revise the obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet complex targets which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks
overall the obama rules called for roughly doubling by to about miles km per gallon the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the united states
but the obama rules included a review by april as to whether the final years were feasible or not
by declaring the obama rules not appropriate the trump administration can reopen the process of setting vehicle targets agreed to by automakers in
pruitt is expected to declare that the existing model year rules on fuel economy must be revised but he is not expected to immediately propose new requirements people familiar with the plans said
they asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the news media
the corporate average fuel economy rules sought to double the average fuel efficiency of automakers fleets or complete lineup of cars and light trucks to about miles km per gallon by
while automakers want relief from the obama rules they are pressing the administration to avoid a battle with california and maintain a single nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements
in new york toyota north america chief executive jim lentz said at an reuters event on thursday that automakers would face higher costs if they had to manage fuel economy by each individual state
lentz said individual state emissions requirements could result in toyota getting towards the end of the year and i no longer can sell suvs depending on the state s fuel economy numbers
it would be an absolute nightmare for us to figure when fuel rules were written in amid high gas prices fuel efficiency was the second highest attribute considered by toyota buyers lentz said
today it is
