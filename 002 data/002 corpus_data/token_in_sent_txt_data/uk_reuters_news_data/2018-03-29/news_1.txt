corrects to show that icao has member states not in fifth paragraph
by allison lampert montreal march reuters the united nations aviation agency is trying to facilitate talks between qatar and its neighbors to defuse recent tensions over alleged airspace violations but won t intervene politically in the dispute two sources familiar with the matter said this week
the international civil aviation organization icao is working to organize a regional meeting for gulf civil aviation and air traffic authorities in the next few weeks as part of broader efforts to improve communication one of the sources said
earlier this week the united arab emirates accused qatari fighter jets of flying dangerously close to two of its civilian aircraft in bahraini airspace in the latest of several incidents raising tension in the region
sometimes if you re having a feud with your neighbor you need someone to facilitate the conversation the source said
i would hope that qatar will express its needs in a way that s icao can not impose binding rules on governments but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its member states
icao spokesman anthony philbin said by email that the agency is presently monitoring these incidents and working with all of the countries concerned to help keep the skies in this part of the world open safe and secure for international the council however is not planning to intervene in these latest disputes over airspace infringement said the second source
improving communication is key because qatar has limited airspace and is part of bahrain s flight information region the first source said
both aviation industry sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential
bahraini qatari and uae officials could not be reached for comment
since january the gulf states have traded accusations over infringements of their respective airspace
in june the uae bahrain saudi arabia and egypt launched a blockade against qatar accusing it of supporting islamist extremists
qatar has denied the accusations
icao last year helped qatar airways access contingency routes over international waters after the country s neighbors refused to allow the carrier to use their airspace
in june icao s governing council is expected to hear arguments by the gulf states over the blockade which qatar is challenging said the second source
