update 1-abb on the hunt for acquisitions in artificial intelligence
zurich reuters swiss engineering company abb is considering acquisitions to increase its capabilities in artificial intelligence chief executive ulrich spiesshofer said on thursday
we will continually further expand the portfolio of abb he said speaking on the sidelines of the company s annual general meeting in zurich
this would include investment in organic growth in artificial intelligence ai and partnerships with other companies to accelerate areas such as linking ai to industrial robots
abb whose products also include charging stations for electric cars and massive converters for transmission systems would also invest selectively in companies spiesshofer said
he was speaking after abb gave a slightly more upbeat assessment about the development of its markets for saying conditions had brightened
the company has navigated a tough couple of years with plummeting demand from its oil gas and mining customers and has rejected calls from an activist investor to spin off its power grids business
during this time abb has simplified its structure into four divisions sold off fringe businesses and exited operations in the low margin and risky engineering and construction area
if you take our end markets in the last couple of years there has been a massive contraction in the process industries and uncertainty in some other markets spiesshofer told reporters after the agm
is really the first year where we see none of our market segments contracting they are either stable or growing
that means the world is starting into with a positive late cycle businesses such as machinery for the oil and gas industry were also stabilizing he added with the company seeing early activities on operating expenditure and service orders from oil gas and mining companies
we see increasing discussion for future projects
so altogether the late cycle will stop getting worse in and towards the end of the year we expect the market to get a little better spiesshofer said although current global trade tensions could have a dampening effect on overall investment sentiment
president donald trump earlier this month pushed ahead with the imposition of metal tariffs though he later announced exemptions for some countries sparking concerns of trade war
trump last week signed a presidential memorandum targeting up to billion in chinese goods with tariffs
after abb s overhaul chairman peter voser said now was the time for the company to deliver
we have outlined the strategy we have worked on the portfolio both in and out so the scene is set he told reporters
we have finished from an operational point of view the restructuring programs
it is now about execution of the strategy it is delivery reporting by john revill editing by john miller and adrian croft
