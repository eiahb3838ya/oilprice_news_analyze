column-commentary: how beijing is winning in the south china sea

by peter apps march reuters earlier this month the uss carl vinson became the first american aircraft carrier to visit vietnam since the vietnam war ended in
coming alongside the news that a record nations from southeast asia and beyond would be joining biennial naval exercises in the eastern indian ocean it was a potent reminder of just how eager the nations surrounding the south china sea are to embrace powerful allies to fend off a rising china
but as beijing s regional clout continues to grow it can be hard for weaker nations to resist it even with these allies support
barely three weeks after the vinson s visit the vietnamese government bowed to chinese pressure and canceled a major oil drilling project in disputed south china waters
it was yet another sign of the region s rapidly shifting dynamics
for the last decade the united states and its asian allies have been significantly bolstering their military activities in the region with the explicit aim of pushing back against china
but beijing s strength and dominance along with its diplomatic economic and military reach continues to grow dramatically
over the last week beijing has conducted major military drills including reportedly sending its aircraft carrier through the taiwan strait and flying jets between japan s southernmost islands the latter of which was explicitly described by the chinese military as a preparation for future wars
these drills are both a response to recent military actions and a bold statement of china s intent to keep up the pressure
western military strategists worry that china will in time be able to block any activity in the region by the united states and its allies
already satellite photos show china installing sophisticated weapons on a range of islands where international law says they simply should not be present
in any war these and other new weapons that china is acquiring could make it all but impossible for the navy and other potential enemies of china to operate in the area at all
a simple issue lies at the heart of the problem beijing s claim to sovereignty over almost the entire south china sea basin
that assertion first made by the exiled republic of china government in taiwan in and then repeated by its mainland communist counterpart since was flatly rejected by a united nations tribunal in
but that hasn t stopped beijing from doing more and more to secure its position in the area
china s increasing confidence in asserting control over the south china sea has clearly alarmed its neighbors particularly the philippines vietnam malaysia indonesia and brunei all of whom have competing territorial claims over waters that china claims for itself
but it also represents a major and quite deliberate challenge to the united states which as an ally to all these nations has essentially staked its own credibility on the issue
over the last several years it has become common practice for warships to sail through nearby waters pointedly refusing to acknowledge chinese demands that they register with its air and maritime identification zones which the united states and its allies do not recognize
the last such voyage dubbed a freedom of navigation operation or in naval parlance a fonop took place on friday when the destroyer mustin reportedly passed within nautical miles of mischief reef in the spratly islands which is claimed by both china and the philippines
the mischief reef fonop fits a much wider pattern of increasingly assertive naval activities by washington and its allies in the region
earlier this month the united states announced the first deployment of its vertical takeoff joint strike fighter by far the most sophisticated aircraft of its type to an amphibious assault ship in the region
this kind of military tit for tat appears to be escalating china now says it plans monthly military exercises in the south china sea a substantial increase
that will likely be met by intensified american and allied activity a british warship is shortly scheduled to conduct its own fonop and the united states has pushed australia to join the program although whether it will do so remains a topic of considerable debate within the country
none of this however addresses the seismic regional change produced by china s strategy
over the last five years china has built ever more sophisticated military and industrial outposts on disputed atolls and reefs in some cases transforming scrubby patches of rock that barely broke the surface into large concrete installations
once a tiny fishing station on stilts mischief reef is now a chinese military base
and china s efforts continue aided by a giant new dredging vessel that its chinese designers have touted as a magical filipino officials say they believe it is only a matter of time before beijing makes similar moves at scarborough shoal within striking distance of major filipino population centers and military facilities
if and when that happens the philippines along with the united states will face a difficult decision about how best to respond
at stake here are more than energy resources although the estimated billion barrels of oil and nearly trillion cubic feet of natural gas that the south china sea is believed to contain are clearly a factor in the conflict
but more broadly china sees this confrontation as a test case for its ability to impose its will on the wider region and so far it is winning
at the very least foreign energy firms are now unlikely to bid to drill in disputed waters spanish oil firm repsol is said to have lost up to million after chinese pressure prompted vietnam to cancel its planned exploration
the united states remains the world s preeminent military superpower and there is little doubt it could win a fight with china almost anywhere else in the world
in its own backyard however beijing is making it increasingly clear that it calls the shots
and for now there is little sign anyone in washington or anywhere else has the appetite to seriously challenge that assumption
