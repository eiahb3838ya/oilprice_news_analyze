indonesia revises palm crop fund rules to back biodiesel drive
jakarta aug reuters indonesia made public on tuesday a revised regulation that gives the country s palm crop fund more leeway to support the expanded use of biodiesel in southeast asia s largest economy
indonesia announced plans this month to require all diesel fuel used in the country to contain a percent from september
the move aims to reduce diesel fuel imports boost palm oil consumption and support the rupiah currency
the revised regulation for the estate crop fund signed by president joko widodo on and made public on tuesday widens the fund s ability to subsidise the price gap between biodiesel and diesel fuel
the current retail price of diesel is rupiah per litre compared to rupiah for unblended biodiesel
previously the fund was limited to providing subsidies to public service obligation pso sectors such as certain types of transport and power stations
a government official said this month biodiesel producers would receive incentives to ensure uniform pricing for pso and sectors
dono boestami head of the estate crop fund told reporters on monday the agency is prepared to provide incentives to support the biodiesel plan
the estate crop fund collects levies from palm oil exporters and the proceeds are used to finance government palm oil programmes such as biodiesel and crop replanting
boestami said the agency collected trillion rupiah million in levies last year and provided subsidies on million kilolitres of biodiesel
in the first quarter of the fund collected trillion rupiah in fees and subsidised million kilolitres of biodiesel
indonesia currently imports around barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products which makes the economy vulnerable to the increases in global crude prices that have occurred since last year
with the country s current account deficit estimated to grow by billion in the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers including power plants and railways use biodiesel that contains percent typically palm oil
officials estimate biodiesel consumption will rise to between million to million kilolitres in from million kilolitres this year and save indonesia around billion per year
palm oil oversupply will be absorbed through biodiesel programme because at the moment biodiesel production utilization is only percent of annual installed capacity boestami said
separately indonesia s energy ministry planned to issue its regulation and guidance regarding the blending and biodiesel supply quota allocations later this week rida mulyana a senior ministry official told reuters on tuesday
