update 4-trump's epa unveils weaker alternative to obama power plant rule
reuters the trump administration on tuesday proposed replacing a signature policy to combat climate change with a weaker plan that would let states write their own rules on power plants prompting critics to warn of dire environmental and health consequences
the environmental protection agency epa proposal would require states to submit plans for improving efficiency of power plants
the federal government will set carbon emission guidelines but states will have the leeway to set standards taking into account a facility s age and the cost of upgrades
the rule also could allow power plant owners to sidestep costly permits for those improvements
the era of top down federal mandates is over epa acting administrator andrew wheeler said on a conference call
the attorneys general of virginia and new york quickly criticized the epa announcement and said they would sue to block the rule if it becomes law
epa projected the new plan would result in million a year in economic benefits and reduce retail power prices by up to percent by
yet documents released on tuesday showed the epa estimated carbon dioxide emissions would be higher than under the obama policy while premature deaths hospital admissions asthma cases and school absence days could be higher by
the agency s assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation bill wehrum said that under the new rule power sector emissions would be similar to the goals set under the obama administration s clean power plan cpp because of how much the industry has already shifted toward cleaner fuels
things have changed a lot since the cpp was put in place wehrum said to reporters on the epa conference call
the industry continues to transform before our very the administration s affordable clean energy rule is limited in its scope to plants
the plan which has been put on hold by the supreme court set overall goals for each state using a series of different measures
epa forecast that under the new rule coal production would rise by up to percent by
california attorney general xavier becerra asked in an interview whether his state would sue to block the plan said we re moving in that direction but would see the administrative process through
we think that there is a strong case to be made that they are violating the very laws they are supposed to enforce becerra said
epa s proposal is open for a public comment period with a final rule expected later this year
the effort to the plan is the latest move by trump administration to roll back environmental rules put in place by obama
trump who has scheduled a rally on tuesday in state west virginia has vowed to end what he termed the war on coal and boost domestic fossil fuels production
environmental groups warned the focus on improving efficiency of generators could raise overall carbon emissions
a coal plant that operates more efficiently may be called upon to run more hours increasing the total amount of emitted overall lissa lynch an attorney for the natural resources defense council said in a statement
the cpp which obama s epa finalized in sought to reduce emissions from power plants to percent below levels by
the supreme court put the brakes on it in after states sued the epa saying it had exceeded its legal reach
in many states the cpp s limits on emissions have already been met because the cost of generating power from natural gas and renewable energy like wind and solar is cheaper than coal
an epa study forecast that compliance costs relative to the cpp would be slightly lower or higher depending on the assumed cost of making efficiency improvements to the plants
that is because the electricity sector has already become far less carbon intensive in recent years
