update 1-germany urges eu payment system without u.s. to save iran deal
berlin reuters europe needs to set up payment systems independent of the united states if it wants to save the nuclear deal between iran and major powers that was abandoned by president donald trump german foreign minister heiko maas said
that s why it is indispensable that we strengthen european autonomy by creating payment channels that are independent of the united states a european monetary fund and an independent swift system maas wrote in the handelsblatt business daily
every day the deal is alive is better than the highly explosive crisis that would otherwise threaten the middle east he added in the article to be published on wednesday
the swift global payment network that facilitates the bulk of the world s transactions shut out iran in after the united states and eu agreed to impose sanctions on the islamic republic over its nuclear activities
the agreement between iran and world powers lifted international sanctions
in return iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so
it has long denied having any such intent
trump withdrew the united states from the deal signed before he took office in may calling the agreement deeply flawed and imposing new sanctions earlier this month
european powers have been scrambling to ensure iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal
this has proven difficult with many european firms wary of financial penalties
iran urged europe this week to speed up efforts to salvage the nuclear accord after french oil group total formally pulled out of a major gas project
trump s decision on iran and his imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the european union have strained relations between the and its european allies
given the circumstances it is of strategic importance that we tell washington clearly we want to work together maas wrote
but we will not allow you to hurt our interests without consulting the eu has vowed to counter trump s renewed sanctions on iran including by means of a new law to shield european companies from punitive measures
