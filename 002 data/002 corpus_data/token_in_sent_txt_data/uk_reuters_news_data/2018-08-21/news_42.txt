update 2-oil search profit slumps post-quake, focus on png lng expansion talks
underlying profit down pct but beats forecasts community recovery to take years ceo png aims to agree lng expansion fiscal terms by nov recasts adds managing director comments by sonali paul melbourne aug reuters australia s oil search ltd reported a near percent fall in profit on tuesday but the drop was not as bad as feared after an earthquake in papua new guinea forced it to shut oil and gas production
oil search s operations supply gas to the png lng liquefied natural gas project run by exxonmobil corp which was shut for six weeks after a magnitude earthquake hit the country s rugged highlands in february triggering widespread damage
more than people died
it has been a very very challenging time oil search managing director peter botten told reporters
we anticipate it will actually be a number of years before our key communities in the highlands area get back to some form of normality as roads and schools start to open and they get their gardens back on their feet he said
oil search s oil facilities are all back on line but will take around six months to return to normal operating rates botten said
but he said png lng had recovered well achieving record rates above million tonnes a year or percent above its design capacity since restarting production in
as a result oil search raised its production guidance for to between million and million barrels of oil equivalent boe from million to million boe flagged in july
net profit fell to million for the six months to june from million in the same half last year but beat an average of five broker forecasts of million
production costs for the half year rose to per boe from a year earlier due to the drop in output
for the full year it sees production costs at between and per boe
oil search s shares fell percent on tuesday underperforming a percent fall in the asx energy index
the focus for oil search in the second half will be on talks with its partners in png lng and papua lng led by france s total sa and the papua new guinean government about a billion expansion of the png lng plant
they plan to add million tonnes a year of capacity with two new production units or trains to be underpinned by papua lng s elk and antelope fields and one train to be underpinned by png lng s p nyang field
png prime minister peter o neill has said he wants to finalise an agreement on the lng expansion before the asia pacific economic apec summit in png in november botten said
there still is a lot to do but real progress is being made botten said
the earthquake aftermath made negotiations tougher with a backlash against the project from locals who considered the quake a natural reaction to gas drilling
the government is pressing oil search exxon and total for better fiscal terms for the expansion than the original png lng project after its revenue from the country s biggest natural resource venture was less than expected
the plant started exports in just before oil prices collapsed
we all understand there has to be a balance of rewards for all parties to make this work botten said
