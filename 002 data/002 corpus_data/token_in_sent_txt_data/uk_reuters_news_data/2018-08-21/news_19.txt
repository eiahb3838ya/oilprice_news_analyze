imf to begin talks with angola on financial support
johannesburg reuters the international monetary fund imf said on tuesday it would begin talks with angola over providing financial support after the oil producing country s economic growth was weaker than expected this year
africa s oil producer has been hit by lower oil prices which have caused a dollar liquidity squeeze that has made it difficult for foreign companies to repatriate profits and discouraged many from investing
angola s finance ministry said on monday it had sought financial support from the imf but did not provide further detail on how much money was involved
we expect to initiate programme discussions with the angolan authorities as soon as feasible deputy managing director of the imf tao zhang said in a statement which confirmed the fund had received a letter from the angolan authorities to start talks
the request came after the imf was invited to luanda in october to negotiate the programme which would last for two years and then be extendable for one more
the imf stands ready to help the authorities address angola s economic challenges by supporting their economic policies and reforms based on the government s macroeconomic stabilisation programme and in the national development plan for zhang said
angola s economy has struggled due to lower oil prices a situation made worse by declining production
output is expected to fall to million barrels per day in down from million last year and million a decade ago
the imf expects the country s economy to grow percent this year well below an original government forecast of percent
president joão lourenço who took over last september after years of rule by josé eduardo dos santos has said he wants to bring about an economic miracle in angola by opening up to foreign investment and diversifying away from oil
