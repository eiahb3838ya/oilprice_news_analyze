could developing-world cities make or break the 1.5c warming goal?
barcelona oct thomson reuters foundation the future that cities in south asia and africa choose cleaner and safer or dirtier and more dangerous will be pivotal to efforts to limit global warming to degrees celsius scientists said in a key report this week
iconic metropolises such as new york and london often grab headlines with their plans to cut air pollution adopt electric transport design green buildings or protect residents from floods
but greater efforts are needed to make similar changes in cities particularly as many smaller ones lack the knowledge and financial resources to do it experts said
we know that much of urban growth is going to be in these and cities in the global south said william solecki an author of the climate science report and professor at hunter university of new york
however these are cities that historically have had limited capacity in governance and finance he said
around the world cities consume more than of the world s energy and account for about of carbon dioxide emissions according to the united nations
whether they can cut those emissions swiftly and protect inhabitants against worsening climate impacts from flooding to heatwaves will play a huge role in determining whether the goals of the paris agreement on climate change are met
but many cities in poorer nations face significant challenges including large and growing slum populations that lack basic services and are increasingly at risk from climate disasters experts said
the report highlights that climate change will impact the most vulnerable that the capacity to respond will be most limited in those locations and among those peoples solecki said
the report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change outlined ways to hold warming to degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit above times and sounded the alarm about the consequences if action to achieve that goal is not stepped up
the world s slum population for instance is expected to triple to billion by placing a significant proportion of people beyond the direct reach of formal policies to cut emissions and adapt to wild weather and rising seas it noted
how to tackle the conditions that lead to informal urban settlements and fuel the risks to their inhabitants is a central question the report said
among the problems that need to be addressed it said are poverty weak governance and low levels of investment by local authorities
on the brighter side the lack of government services in poorer parts of cities also can spur green informal economies based around things like recycling
such economies are often and use resources efficiently the report noted
bringing transitions to slums will require governments teaming up with communities it said
but there is no guarantee that these partnerships will evolve or cohere into the type of service delivery and climate governance system that could steer the change on a scale required to limit to warming to the report warned
still it acknowledged work by some organisations such as dwellers international sdi to try to make that happen
that network is collaborating among other initiatives on a project in the south african city of durban to build evidence in part by having slum communities collect data on the best ways to upgrade more than informal settlements
mark watts executive director of cities which promotes climate action in metropolises said his group was funding advisors for member african cities to help them put together plans in line with the warming goal
while those cities may lack expertise they do not have big negative bureaucracies to push against which may make winning the case for development easier he said
they also can leapfrog the mistakes made by the west he added
an african city that lacks a waste management system for instance can build modern treatment plants that run on clean energy rather than trying to fix or improve older facilities
watts urged cities to stop investing in infrastructure including roads that is likely to hike carbon emissions in future
instead they should put scarce resources into clean transport buildings and training people to deliver green infrastructure he said
seven cities that are members of new york barcelona copenhagen london oslo paris and stockholm have already published climate change strategies designed to deliver on the goal and a further have committed to do so
but most cities are still developing in an unsustainable way that is adding to carbon emissions watts said
the report made clear what cities must do to become green and resilient and the urgency of following that path he noted
the cities that do change wo be viable in a few decades time he warned
