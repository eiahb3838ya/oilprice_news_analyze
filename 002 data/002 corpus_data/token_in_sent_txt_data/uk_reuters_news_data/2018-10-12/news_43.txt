uniper defends datteln 4 plant in german coal debate
frankfurt oct reuters german utility uniper has hit back at suggestions that germany should sacrifice the company s planned datteln coal power plant to help to meet the country s climate goals
the rheinische post daily reported on friday that economy minister peter altmaier proposed that germany considers shutting close to gigawatts gw of german power capacity and that datteln should not be connected to the power grid
the plant is already under contruction and slated to begin operating in
it would be a foolish act to symbolically sacrifice datteln within a possible scenario uniper board member eckhardt ruemmler said in a written statement
instead of making the energy transition a model of success with the help of one of the most modern power stations in europe we would instead continue to operate old and more highly plants should datteln not go live a spokeswoman for the berlin ministry said altmaier had not made numerical suggestions regarding coal capacity to be shut
she referred to a commission that is due to meet on friday ahead of a deadline to come up with a schedule for limiting and phasing out power generation
altmaier is not part of the commission
datteln a megawatt mw plant should have started in but proved a major headache for uniper attracting protests by environmentalists and swallowing billion euros billion in investment so far
it has also been held up by damages to its boiler during component tests
ruemmler emphasised that uniper was ready to work with the government on making power production less and eventually get out of coal altogether
germany still derives percent of its power from coal and employs tens of thousands in the industry
the coal commission will help to allocate federal funds amounting to billion euros in the current government s term for bringing new industries into coal regions according to a draft proposal seen by reuters
it is also expected to discuss additional funding needs and infrastructure for the future of the regions working closely with the european union
