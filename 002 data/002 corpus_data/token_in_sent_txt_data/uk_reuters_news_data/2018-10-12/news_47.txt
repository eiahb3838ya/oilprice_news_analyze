iea sees world oil market "adequately supplied"
oil demand estimates cut for and by mln bpd iea world oil supply has increased by mln bpd since may iea extra supply suggests market adequately supplied for now estimate of call on opec crude in cut by mln bpd oil supply growth raised sharply for and by christopher johnson london oct reuters oil markets look adequately supplied for now after a big increase in production over the last six months but the oil industry is coming under strain as it copes with increasing global demand the west s energy watchdog said on friday
the international energy agency said in its monthly report that the world s spare oil production capacity was already down to only percent of global demand with further reductions likely to come
this strain could be with us for some time and it will likely be accompanied by higher prices however much we regret them and their potential negative impact on the global economy the iea said
members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other exporters such as russia and shale producers had increased oil production sharply since may the iea said raising output by million barrels per day bpd
overall opec had boosted production by bpd since may as middle east gulf producers such as saudi arabia and the uae more than compensated for declining output in venezuela and iran which is facing sanctions from next month
and the outlook for world oil consumption was faltering
the iea cut its forecast of global oil demand growth by million bpd for both this year and next to million bpd and million bpd respectively
this is due to a weaker economic outlook trade concerns higher oil prices and a revision to chinese data said the iea which advises major oil consumers on energy policy
oecd commercial stocks rose by million barrels in august to billion barrels their highest level since february on strong refinery output and liquefied petroleum gas restocking the iea said
it added that oecd inventories were likely to have risen by million barrels in the third quarter the largest quarterly increase in stocks since the first quarter of
the increase in net production from key suppliers since may of approximately million bpd led by saudi arabia and the fact that oil stocks built by million bpd in and look likely to have done the same in lends weight to the argument that the oil market is adequately supplied for now the iea said
