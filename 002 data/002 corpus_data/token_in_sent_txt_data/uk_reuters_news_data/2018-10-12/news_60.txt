interview-ecuador, peru in talks to explore oil and gas blocks - energy minister
adds quote context on auctions opec comments by alexandra valencia quito oct reuters ecuador has begun talks with neighboring peru to jointly explore two oilfields at the border and allow petroamazonas to operate natural gas areas in peru ecuadorian energy minister carlos perez said on thursday
ecuador which earlier this year awarded foreign and domestic energy firms exploration and production rights for four oil blocks in the andean country plans to continue offering areas through an onshore auction later this year and another in for natural gas blocks off its pacific shore
we could form a joint venture between oil firms petroamazonas and petroperu plus a private company to bring in capital perez told reuters in an interview
the crude to be jointly produced along the border would feed peru s talara refinery through an existing pipeline while natural gas to be produced in peruvian territory would be exported to ecuador to ease a shortage there
ecuador president lenin moreno s government is moving fast to attract foreign investment in the country s energy industry to reverse a slow decline in crude output
other countries in the region including brazil mexico colombia and argentina also are competing for oil capital
oil contracts in ecuador have been changed to allow operators to export independently and over a dozen crude and gas blocks are planned to be offered to foreign companies through production agreements and service contracts
after completing the intracampos onshore oil tender in the last quarter of ecuador will next year auction exploration and production rights for gas blocks off the esmeraldas manabi and guayas shores which have been studied but reserves have not been confirmed
the country s largest gas field amistad is also being offered for private investment
we want to bring large companies to the gas auction because bigger investment is required there perez said
ecuador which plans to boost oil output to barrels per day bpd in from bpd this year supports a crude production increase at the december opec meeting he said
due to national interest ecuador wants to have the option of being able to increase production
that will be our point of view in the upcoming opec meeting perez said
the current crude price of between and per barrel is reasonable perez said adding that we must find a balance in the market
