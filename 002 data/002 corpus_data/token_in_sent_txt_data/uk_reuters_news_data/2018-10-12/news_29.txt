exxaro which already supplies eskom s matimba matla and medupi power stations aims to enter into contracts with eskom said mgojo
we don t want to get involved in type arrangements said mgojo
we want to create the flexibility whereby when the opportunity makes sense for us to play into the eskom market we have that flexibility to do eskom s spokesman khulu phasiwe said the power utility was very close to signing new deals

hopefully before the end of this month we should be seeing the first trucks coming through to the stations that are affected said phasiwe

we are not in a position to mention them but some of them include the main players in the market phasiwe said
eskom needs million tonnes of coal to close its deficit but was also looking to stockpile a further million tonnes phasiwe said
eskom which has a total national output of mw implemented power cutting measures known locally as load shedding in denting economic output
