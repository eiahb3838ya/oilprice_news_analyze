graphic-take five: uk may-day and us curveballs: world markets themes for the week ahead
reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them
with major parts of the economy visibly slowing the treasury market has reacted in a striking manner the yield is close to falling below the yield which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last years
signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year
but wait
inflation is running at a high annual wage growth a year high and unemployment at a year low
so november inflation due on will play into how fed chair jerome powell frames the path of future tightening
so it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here
there are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert
depending on how the incoming data looks stagflation anyone
the fed s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear

yield curve click buckle up for another wild week of brexit on sterling and other markets
britain s parliament is at the time of writing at least set to vote on prime minister theresa may s brexit transition deal on tuesday but the chances of it being approved don t look good
what happens then is well that s the thing there are multiple possibilities all with very different implications
a really heavy defeat would make it difficult for may to carry on
she has staggered through the last couple of years taking direct hits from all angles but this could finally bring her down
could that then lead to a hard brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal
perhaps and sterling won t like that one bit
but it s equally possible that whoever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the article notice
that could even raise the chances of a second public brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring

for markets that s a done deal
what matters now is what the ecb does in the face of a weakening economy global trade tensions brexit and italy
policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when qe ends
one suggestion is for loans to banks
what investors appear more certain about is that the ecb will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent especially if a slowdown encourages the fed to pause its cycle
money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a pct chance of a ecb rate hike in
but that s down from percent just a few weeks ago

if financial markets are any guide the detente between washington and beijing struck over a steak dinner at the in buenos aires barely lasted hours
fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment
on oil markets that signals that a percent price slump since october has little hope of reversing
oil has also had to contend with opec whose initial failure to agree an output cut accelerated the price slump
agreement over a million cuts together with some producers has provided a bit of respite but brent still remains just over
commodities overall are in some trouble
copper is near lows having lost around percent so far in while most base metals are down a similar amount
and the australian dollar a good proxy for commodities chinese demand and world trade was the major currency in the world all week
without good news on the trade front respite is unlikely
the trade deficit hit a high in october and its politically sensitive deficit with china surged to a record billion
so lets see how china hawks in the trump administration react to data showing beijing s imports from the united states shrank percent from a year earlier following a percent annual decline in october
it appears so far that china may not be carrying out promises to import more from america and that could provide more grist for the mill for officials pushing for more reasons to punish china and for investors skeptical of the trade ceasefire
the prospect of a chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy
so while trade contributes far less to the country s gdp than it used to there are other data points coming up too credit growth and retail sales among others which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war
