poll-india inflation likely eased in nov to 16-mth low
reuters retail inflation poll data reuters wholesale inflation poll data reuters industrial output poll data october industrial output data due at gmt on wed dec november cpi data due at gmt on wed dec by anisha sheth bengaluru dec reuters indian inflation is likely to have cooled to a low in november according to a reuters poll as food and fuel prices fell supporting the reserve bank of india s decision to keep interest rates on hold at a policy meeting last week
the poll of economists predicted retail inflation sank in november to percent from october s percent
forecasts in the poll taken between ranged between percent and percent
if the consensus is realised the november data will not only mark inflation below the rbi s target of percent for a fourth straight month but also be the first time since july it was below percent
we expect headline cpi inflation to have slowed during november in a manner
food prices are likely to have continued to remain benign
transportation costs are also estimated to have softened due to a fall in global crude oil prices said shashank mendiratta india economist at anz
core inflation should have moderated alongside reflecting easing pressures in the economy
the softer headline cpi print should provide comfort to the central asia s economy is slowing dragged down by lower consumer spending and farm growth and that should also remove any pressure for an increase in interest rates
with energy and food prices which account for a major chunk of india s consumer price index basket falling sharply the trend of relatively stable inflation over the past two years is expected to continue
while falling food costs is good news for consumers plunging prices of some vegetables in a country with a chronic supply problem that is often exacerbated by unpredictable monsoons is adding to the woes of farmers
the crash in farm prices led to tens of thousands of farmers protesting in the national capital last month likely worrying for a government going to the polls in six months
farm prices could rise if the government steps in to buy crops at higher prices known as minimum support price msp something economists had said could be inflationary
the upside risk related to msp has not materialized as anticipated said tushar arora economist at hdfc bank
food inflation has eased recently helped by bountiful crop supplies and sales of subsidised foodgrain to nearly of india s billion population
it is food prices that moves the needle on inflation said arjun nagarajan economist at sbicap securities
what we don t know is whether the demand slack is the dominant variable that is bringing food inflation down or whether the supply glut is the dominant variable that is bringing it down
for now it seems that the supply glut is the more dominant variable that is bringing the prices separately the poll showed industrial output rose at an annual percent pace in october up from september s percent
it was boosted by infrastructure production the output at eight core industries which rose percent from a year ago
