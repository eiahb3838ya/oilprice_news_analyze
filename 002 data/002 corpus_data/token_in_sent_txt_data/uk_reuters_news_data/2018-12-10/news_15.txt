column-oil traders focus on deteriorating economic outlook rather than opec: kemp
london reuters the weakening outlook for oil consumption coupled with rising output from shale and softer than expected sanctions on iran have convinced most traders the market is moving into a period of oversupply
in the run up to last week s opec meeting in vienna hedge fund managers had little confidence in the organisation s ability to cut production by enough to avoid an oversupplied market next year
fund managers sold another million barrels of brent futures and options in the week to bringing total sales over the last weeks to a record million barrels
funds now hold just over two long positions for every short one down from a ratio of more than at the end of september and the position for months
bearish short positions have risen to million barrels up from just million at the end of september and the largest number since june
pessimism about the outlook for crude prices was reflected by a similar collapse in sentiment towards middle distillates such as gasoil
chartbook fund managers sold another million barrels of european gasoil bringing total sales in the last eight weeks to million barrels
funds are the towards middle distillates since july according to an analysis of position data from ice futures europe
middle distillates are heavily geared towards the economic cycle because most distillate fuel oil is used in freight transportation shipping railroads aviation trucks manufacturing mining and farming
so the collapse in sentiment towards distillates is consistent with growing concerns about the outlook for the global economy in
investors fears about the impact of trade tensions and heightened uncertainty on business investment and growth next year is darkening the outlook for distillates just as it is hitting equity markets
expected oversupply of crude has been reflected in the sharp fall in brent spot prices since the start of october and the futures curve swinging from backwardation into contango
opec and selected countries agreed last week to cut their output by million barrels per day during the first six months of from the level in october
most of the cuts will come from saudi arabia with smaller contributions likely to come from russia the united arab emirates kuwait and oman
other opec and countries are unlikely to reduce their output voluntarily by any significant amount so their participation in the agreement is mostly symbolic
the planned production cuts reverse the group s earlier ramp up in output and should offset the softer enforcement of sanctions on iran
by cutting output promptly and aggressively may be able to avert a large build up in excess oil inventories next year and a collapse in prices similar to
in contrast to opec has opted to sacrifice market share in an effort to defend prices at a higher level despite the rapid growth of shale
but there is little the group can do about the deteriorating economic outlook which implies the need for a period of lower oil prices to restrain production and stimulate consumption to keep the market balanced
and as the global economy reels from the tariff war between the united states and china rising interest rates tightening credit conditions and a broader economic slowdown lower oil prices are a necessary part of the economic adjustment process
