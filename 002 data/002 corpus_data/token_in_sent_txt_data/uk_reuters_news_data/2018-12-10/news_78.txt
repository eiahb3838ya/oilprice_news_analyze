feature-lawyers on wheels: 'solidarity bus' represents kyrgyzstan's landless women
kyrgyzstan dec thomson reuters foundation in a cold sparsely lit room sitting close to the heater ainura ibraimjanova taps at her computer
in this rural district in southern kyrgyzstan she is the only lawyer providing free legal aid
just back from court in the alai district ibraimjanova is attending to a stream of clients in thick coats and clutching documents
they are in need of help with alimony divorce or family land disputes
the laws have changed considerably since kyrgyzstan gained its independence because there was a real gap in legal frameworks and customs with many people breaching laws in favour of customs she told the thomson reuters foundation
land a scarce and resource in this former communist country is of huge social value she said with disputes over it particularly affecting women
having or not having a piece of land decides who you are it s a very important matter especially in a rural area said ibraimjanova
at independence in when state property was privatised every citizen was given an equal plot of land but it was often registered under the name of the male household head
that meant women often missed out on claiming land rights especially if they got married or divorced ibraimjanova said
according to kyrgyz tradition people treat men and women in different ways
if a girl grows up and chooses to take her share of land with her and separate from her big family this really looks strange in accordance with local tradition and the family is usually opposed to it she said
although courts often rule in favour of women and in accordance with the law executing such judgments can be arduous and take years ibraimjanova said
there are still many women who need to be supported and whose rights needs to be better yet change is coming even to remote regions like alai in part thanks to the bus of solidarity
the small van bounds along rural roads to bring lawyers notaries and social workers to remote parts of the country to resolve villagers legal quandaries for free
it is supported by the justice ministry and the development programme undp
on this day it is headed for the craggy village of in southern kyrgyzstan
among those waiting in the rain for the bus to arrive was zoora jumabaeva
i learned by chance that the bus was coming today jumabaeva a user told the thomson reuters foundation
she hoped the lawyers could resolve her complaint with the local bazaar after the new owner raised rents and forcibly removed her stall which sells medicine for livestock to a location outside the market
had the bus not come jumabaeva would have had to make an arduous journey on poor roads to the nearest town osh to seek legal services
in previous years she would use informal mechanisms such as a council of elders to solve her disputes
but she said the fact that their decisions were not legally binding was frustrating
and so bearing the rain and cold jumabaeva huddled at a small desk inside a billowing blue tent to explain her dilemma
i m losing my regular income and my family is suffering
i came here today to get some more legal advice on protecting my interests she told a lawyer
there are many other women and young families at the market who suffer more than me from being evicted as this was their only income source so i m trying to act on their behalf to solve a common the lawyer jazgul kolmatova who practises in osh is no stranger to the bus of solidarity having made several journeys
jumabaeva s paperwork she said was scant
she came to us with quite a difficult and complex problem but her case is a fairly common one kolmatova told the thomson reuters foundation as she took down notes
boarding the bus provides a chance to resolve knotty legal issues that have often been building for years she said
i joined the bus of solidarity because i know that the rural population and especially women are very poorly educated in legal issues and i want to make my contribution to changing this situation she said
since the bus began running in it has visited about villages and carried out more than consultations according to undp
but meetings are often brief and complex cases require
with a luminous orange hijab wrapped around her hair and fighting back tears gulzina ashimzhanova said she met ibraimjanova when the bus of solidarity came to her village earlier this year
ashimzhanova and her five children were made homeless when she left her alcoholic husband who she said was violent
ashimzhanova wanted to divorce him and secure her share of the property
when we went to the village we saw the bus and met ainura ibraimjanova
she told us about this free legal assistance she explained everything she said
we were consulted from there then she said to bring the documents and she could help me
she said we could divide the house and get alimony via the ashimzhanova who has been clinically depressed tried to get her share of a house square metres of land and an apple orchard all registered in her husband s name
i need to get a house for my children ashimzhanova said
i don t want my rights to be for ibraimjanova the case though legally carries a heavy social stigma because ashimzhanova left her husband and wants an equal share of their common property
gulzina ashimzhanova from my point of view is very brave to act like this and i m sure her example can inspire many others ibraimjanova said
i told her if she does fight for her rights that could set a good example for other women in kyrgyzstan too there could be many others who are also shy and this step of hers could give them a push
