india's petronet looking for long-term deal to buy u.s. lng
new delhi dec reuters top indian gas importer petronet lng is looking to sign a deal in a year s time to buy at least million tonnes of natural gas annually for a period of up to years as it pushes to diversify its supply sources beyond the middle east
as part of any deal the firm could potentially take a stake in a liquefied natural gas lng project said petronet s managing director prabhat singh
the market is open compared to other markets where the state is often the controller of minerals singh told reuters late last week
the offers lots of opportunities and we would like to explore that properly and make a venture there he said
petronet currently runs a million tonnes per annum mtpa liquefied natural gas lng regasification site at dahej in the western state of gujarat and a mtpa plant at kochi in southern india
it has deals to buy mtpa of lng with mtpa of that coming from qatar s rasgas
singh said petronet was in talks with various companies including tellurian inc about a potential deal
singh had said in november that petronet and ongc videsh were jointly in talks to buy a stake in tellurian s proposed driftwood project in louisiana
if the pricing is right then india has appetite for huge volumes he said last week
natural gas accounts for about percent of india s overall energy needs far lower than the global average
the government wants to lift that to percent in the next few years
the market is so developed that niche service providers are available on a shoestring budget which means less overheads singh said
a glut of natural gas in the united states in the wake of the rapid development of shale fields there has kept benchmark prices for lng at almost half asian levels
meanwhile singh said petronet was also in talks to invest in exploration and lng projects in qatar as well as continuing to scout for opportunities in bangladesh and sri lanka
australia overtook qatar as the world s largest exporter of lng for the first time in november data from refinitiv eikon showed on monday
