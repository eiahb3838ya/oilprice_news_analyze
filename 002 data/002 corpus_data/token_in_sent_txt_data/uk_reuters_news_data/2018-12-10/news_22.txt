south africa needs to bail out eskom, says former eskom adviser rothschild
johannesburg reuters the south african government needs to bite the bullet and bail out struggling power firm eskom which has asked for billion rand billion pounds in government support the chief executive of rothschild co in south africa told reuters
rothschild advised eskom in when it last received a major cash injection from government
at the time eskom sought billion rand but was granted a billion rand loan which was later converted into equity
eskom has implemented controlled power cuts for much of the past week which could erode support for the ruling african national congress at next year s national election
opinion is divided on whether eskom which provides more than percent of south africa s power but was embroiled in corruption scandals under its previous management should be bailed out again
rothschild s martin kingston said in an interview that recapitalising eskom could cost the country its last investment grade credit rating but that there was no other obvious solution if eskom was to survive
the government knows that putting money into eskom is going to exacerbate a downgrade scenario
but i think it is going to have to bite that bullet kingston said
the level of debt on eskom s balance sheet is completely eskom s debt has ballooned from around billion rand to more than billion rand over the past decade while electricity sales have fallen
eskom executives told investors on a roadshow last week they wanted the state to take on billion rand of the company s debt
but finance minister tito mboweni is yet to approve the proposal and has said the state can not afford to continue pouring money into state firms
president cyril ramaphosa has made reforming eskom a priority since taking office in february but the scale of its financial difficulties has made progress slow
kingston said the government had kicked the can down the road by not providing eskom with more funds in and that restructuring the utility could take three to five years
