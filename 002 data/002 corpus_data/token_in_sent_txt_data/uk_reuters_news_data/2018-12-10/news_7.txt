by clyde russell launceston australia dec reuters the key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by opec and its allies is balance
it s something everybody in the market says they want but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there
boiled down to the basics both the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and the other producers most notably russia are trying to do with the move to cut output by million barrels per day bpd is achieve their vision of a balanced market
while what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms it s assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be fair and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output
what this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain although it s likely that opec and its allies will take the view that the a barrel that brent crude closed at the day before the output deal was reached is too low
but it s also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the opec orbit
brent reached a high of a barrel on but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost percent of its value hitting a trough of on the lowest level in a year
it s that rapid plunge that led opec and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired but elusive state
the market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether opec has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise but not so high that demand is threatened
the initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for opec with brent jumping as much as to a barrel during trade on but eventually it closed at up percent from the previous day
the nirvana of balance also means that opec and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader saudi arabia have to walk a series of political tightropes
the obvious one is also the most public president donald trump who is often criticised for changing his mind on issues but has been remarkably consistent on one front namely his desire for lower oil prices
it s perhaps no surprise that saudi energy minister khalid singled out energy companies as winners from the opec and allies deal telling reporters at the meeting in vienna on that they were breathing a sigh of relief
this was perhaps a attempt to stave off a blast from trump on his favoured social media platform twitter by reminding him that the powerful energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices
the saudis also have to manage their relationship with the united states carefully in the wake of the murder of saudi dissident journalist jamal khashoggi at the kingdom s consulate in october
trump has said he is not convinced the saudi crown prince ordered the murder even as leaders of his own republican party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on saudi arabia for the killing
a further complicating factor is iran which is exempt from the new deal and in theory living on borrowed time given the waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on april
given the plethora of competing factors and influences it would seem balance will be a difficult if not impossible task in the crude oil market
but how will the success of this latest production cut be measured
if crude remains in a range between and a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the iran export waivers then it might be fair to argue that opec and its allies will have achieved what they wanted a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with
