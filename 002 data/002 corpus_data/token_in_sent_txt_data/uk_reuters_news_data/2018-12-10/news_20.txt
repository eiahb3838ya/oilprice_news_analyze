uk energy supplier one select ceases to trade - regulator
london dec reuters a small british energy supplier one select has ceased to trade regulator ofgem said on monday promising to find a new supplier soon for its customers
this is the third small energy supplier to have ceased trading in as many weeks and ofgem said last month it would introduce financial and customer service tests for new entrants to beef up their robustness
we have seen a number of supplier failures this year and our safety net procedures are working as they should to protect customers ofgem said in a statement
a push to increase competitiveness in britain s energy market has reduced the market share of the six largest companies to percent from over percent in recent years with smaller independent companies in operation
however their rapid rise has led to questions over their viability as with less capital available to make hedges some may have been vulnerable to soaring wholesale commodity price rises and renewable subsidy charges
