switch to clean energy and save $500 mln, aid agencies told
london dec thomson reuters foundation aid agencies could save more than million by choosing clean energy over fossil fuels in war zones and disaster areas global chatham house said in a report on monday
humanitarian agencies spent about five percent of their funds or an estimated billion on diesel last year and could save million each year by using cleaner energy sources such as solar power it said
humanitarians are operating in tough environments where saving lives come first said owen grafham from the moving energy initiative mei a partnership managed by chatham house
energy is not given much thought diesel is the fuel because it s what agencies are used to and it s he said in a statement
fossil fuels can be used as a weapon hijacked by militants or sold on the black market and sometimes have to be flown vast distances to reach relief camps
that creates costs that humanitarian groups can ill afford with wars persecution and other violence having uprooted a record million people last year according to the refugee agency
aid agencies said curbing emissions was key to preventing related disasters
renewable energy is key to reducing emissions under a global climate deal after governments in pledged to hold temperature rise to well below degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit above times and ideally to degrees the burning of dirty fuels increasingly impacts poor people particularly women and girls who are in the midst of humanitarian crises sven harmeling head of care international s climate advocacy arm said in email
while the technology has not advanced far enough to make a full swap viable some solar projects are already under way in the field and aid workers expect many more to follow
engineer eriksson from the doctors without borders msf sweden innovation unit said the group was making substantial effort to use renewable energy
however it is not certain that such a transformation will save us money given the current initial costs for renewable energy infrastructure
our operations are and therefore implicitly short term he said
the investment for renewable energy solutions is always higher than for diesel generator solutions and so the savings only come over a number of years eriksson said from haiti where he is testing
aid groups say operations also relied on diesel generators since many local workers or volunteers already knew how to use them whereas solar energy would be costly and require specialised knowledge
an october report by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change said renewable energy would need to supply percent of electricity by to stay within a limit compared with about percent now
more than countries are meeting in poland through to hammer out rules that will enable the paris accord to be put into practice from and spur countries to strengthen their current climate action plans
