interview-imf endorses japan's preference of tpp over two-way trade deal
washington reuters a multilateral framework like the partnership pact works better in fixing trade imbalances than a bilateral deal imf deputy managing director mitsuhiro furusawa said in an endorsement of japan s calls for washington to rejoin tpp
japan and the united states are at loggerheads on how to frame trade talks with president donald trump rebuffing tokyo s calls to rejoin the pact instead preferring a trade deal
furusawa said multilateral frameworks like tpp were more effective in solving disagreements over trade and fixing imbalances in a globalized world with intertwined supply chains
bilateral talks alone can t solve imbalances
it s therefore more efficient to solve them with a bigger framework furusawa told reuters on saturday on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings
in general a multilateral framework is more efficient for the global economy said furusawa a former top japanese currency diplomat
japan wants trump to reconsider his decision to pull the united states out of tpp and is reluctant to meet washington s calls to open talks for a trade deal for fear of coming under pressure to open up markets like agriculture
the two countries agreed at a summit earlier this week to create a new framework focussing on trade talks to iron out differences though japanese officials say it will take time to reach a solution agreeable for both
the united states has also engaged in a trade spat with china stoking protectionism worries among imf and group of finance leaders
furusawa said such concerns could hurt asian economies through various channels
trade negotiations take time and during that process the uncertainty continues
that would affect not just goods trade but investment consumption and sentiment he said
while responding to trump s tariff threats with retaliation china recently announced market liberalisation plans such as scrapping a limit on foreign ownership of automotive ventures
china has been pushing through market reforms for quite some time so i don t think it s just in response to pressure furusawa said
it s a move in the right direction
pushing forward with reforms is good not just for the chinese economy but for the global referring to japan s fiscal policy furusawa said it was obvious the country must proceed with a scheduled sales tax increase next year to rein in its huge public debt
the government should also take steps to ease the pain from the tax hike on the economy including through a temporary increase in fiscal spending he said
as the economy continues to strengthen japan must push through reforms to boost its potential growth he said
we ve seen some progress such as in areas like corporate governance and trade furusawa said
the biggest challenge is labour market reform so we re hoping there will be progress on that reporting by leika kihara editing by andrea ricci and paul simao
