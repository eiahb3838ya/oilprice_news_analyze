feature-louisiana 'islanders' find a new home beyond the water
isle de jean charles louisiana april thomson reuters foundation standing in the long grass on the land where he was born with the sea now lapping just meters away chief albert naquin remembers isle de jean charles as a wonderful place to grow up
it s like night and day we were totally here
now you have to go off the island to survive he said of his community in southeast louisiana one that is being dispersed by the encroaching waves of the gulf of mexico
since the the small strip of land once miles km by miles km has lost percent of its mass according to the land remote sensing program
it is linked to the mainland by a road flanked by water on either side
the fear is that the island as it is known could wash away in the next big storm
many of the or so extended families that once lived on isle de jean charles have drifted away over the last years and now as utility companies refuse to service it only around homes remain
to me it s like watching a family member with cancer it s being eaten away little bit by little bit
but this piece of land is lasting longer than a human body can naquin told the thomson reuters foundation
the sliver of land has been home for generations to the indians a tribe that found refuge here in the early century
this is where we were chased by the white man and came to settle and now mother nature is chasing us away naquin said
but the community after a long search to redefine its future is now hoping it may finally have found a new home
in the first federal competition to fund innovative resilience projects in the face of worsening storms and extreme weather the state of louisiana was awarded million in by the department of housing and urban development hud
of that million was earmarked to resettle the community of isle de jean charles after chantel comardelle the tribe s executive secretary and colleagues worked with state officials and other groups to submit plans
winning the grant pushed the small community into the international media spotlight
after two years of search and negotiation acres hectares has been purchased near schriever in south louisiana at a cost of close to million with development to start in
the land is between feet and feet m above sea level higher than projections for coastal flooding released by the coastal protection and restoration authority
comardelle who left the island for the city of houma in southeast louisiana splits her life between raising her family and the fight for her people s future and has spent so much time in the office that her three children keep toys there
the migration plan got funding she believes because it blazes a trail for other groups who face the prospect of losing their land both in the united states and other countries
right now there s very little positive in the form of relocation or resettlement of people she said
we presented a different model of doing it a in the late century construction began on a vast series of levees earth embankments built to contain and prevent flooding across the mississippi river
the levees altered the natural flow of river sediment and louisiana s southeastern wetlands gradually began to sink
then in the early century the oil and gas industry discovered huge wealth along the coast and over decades drilled more than wells and put in miles of canals and pipelines
the canals provided an easy route for salt water into the area s marshes breaking up wetlands
yet even while it altered the landscape the fossil fuel industry brought jobs and infrastructure
they re the one that s putting food on the table and paying the rent and mortgages so as much as you hate them you have to like them said chief naquin
today climate change effects in the form of sea level rise and powerful storms are compounding louisiana s problems
we re both subsiding and suffering global sea level rise at the same time former senator reggie dupre executive director of the terrebonne levee and conservation district told the thomson reuters foundation in his office in houma
we are sinking by mm inches a year
that doesn t sound like much but after years you start to notice differences when you are already only slightly above the water like isle de jean a geological survey study says southeast louisiana is losing wetlands at the rate of a football field an hour
mat sanders resilience policy and programme administrator for louisiana s office of community development said others can be expected to experience similar conditions
louisiana as one of the first is presenting itself as a laboratory he added
on the porch in the still warm air beneath his home built on stilts chris brunet who has lived in isle de jean charles all his life said the place had become a skeleton of its former self
when i was a child it was very easy to wake up in the morning and see armadillo in the yard or a possum or a raccoon said brunet who lives with his teenage son
ironically it was building a new levee system in that pushed the tribe to seek a new home
isle de jean charles was left out of a hurricane protection zone stretching from morganza to the gulf even though it was included in initial studies
dupre said it became clear that the million cost of extending the levee system to the island would be too high
that s always been a personal dilemma of mine said dupre who went to school with many of the tribal inhabitants
here i am the chief executive officer of the agency building the hurricane protection system that excludes the one thing that is not factored into the analysis is what s the cost of losing a culture for the indians the goal now is to bring their community back together
but sanders said the reality was more complex as some residents identify with another tribe the houma nation while others have no tribal affiliation
the funds will be spent on helping all those living on isle de jean charles to move
the priority is to move folks out of harm s way
it s not a tribal project it s a community project he said
one major question remains unanswered who will own the land on which the community plans to resettle
initially it will be held by the state through the louisiana land trust while different models are discussed including shared community ownership
standing on the newly acquired land a sugarcane farm with a large wetland and a stretch of bayou swamp comardelle said the lack of clarity was kinda scary for those mulling relocation
but people are tired of replacing cars and furniture after every hurricane season of never having the chance to save or give their kids a leg up in life she explained
this is our rebirth where we can start our to get off that endangered species list and begin again she said smiling as her children ran races in the golden afternoon light
