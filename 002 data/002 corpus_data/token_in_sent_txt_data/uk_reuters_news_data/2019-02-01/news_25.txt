four die in first clash of libyan force's southward push
benghazi libya feb reuters at least four libyan soldiers were killed on friday when forces loyal to khalifa haftar fought for hours with a local armed group as they sought to expand south military officials said
libya has been in turmoil since the toppling of muammar gaddafi in with parallel administrations and armed groups carving the nation into swathes of control
friday s clashes were the first real resistance the libyan national army lna faction faced since arriving in the south two weeks ago from its main eastern stronghold of benghazi
lna officials said clashes began when soldiers left the main southern city of sabha and arrived in the nearby town of ghudduwah
it backed troops with air strikes on the terrorists and chadian mercenaries the officials said using a pejorative for chadian opposition groups active in south libya
as well as the four lna fatalities several of its soldiers were wounded the officials said
there was no immediate confirmation of the lna s version and it was unclear if there were also casualties on the other side
the lna spent the last two weeks securing sabha which had been nominally under the control of the government in tripoli but was in practice run by local groups including tribes
the lna says its campaign is intended to combat islamic militants and secure oil facilities in the south which include el sharara oilfield libya s biggest
it has been closed since december when tribesmen and state guards seized it
the lna whose commander haftar dominates eastern libya is allied to a parallel government in benghazi that opposes the tripoli administration
