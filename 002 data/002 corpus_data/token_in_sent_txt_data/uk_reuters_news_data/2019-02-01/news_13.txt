update 1-french court rejects activists bid to suspend total's guyana drilling
paris reuters a french court has rejected an urgent request by environmental groups including greenpeace and friends of the earth to deny oil and gas major total permission to proceed with plans to drill off the coast of french guyana
the environmental groups asked the court in december to suspend total s permit to drill five wells in the block over environmental concerns
the court said there was no need for an urgent ruling which would have come in time to halt the drilling operations
greenpeace said that although the ruling on the urgent request was disappointing the group was hopeful that it could still stop the drilling operation by another means
greenpeace and friends of the earth have filed a separate court application to annul total s exploration permit in offshore french guyana it said adding that the groups will keep up pressure on the company s projects in the region
total welcomed the court s decision and said the drilling operation was ongoing
the campaign launched in will therefore continue with the objective of drilling the exploration wells total said
drilling offshore guyana is part of drilling projects total aims to carry out in in its biggest oil exploration drive in recent years
total said in december that a drilling vessel was on the site to start drilling and it invited activists to visit the site saying it was taking measures to protect the environment and would not endanger coral reefs in the region
