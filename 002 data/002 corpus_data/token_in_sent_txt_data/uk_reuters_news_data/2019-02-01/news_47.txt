update 1-fortum has raised its uniper stake to 49.99 percent
helsinki reuters finland s biggest utility fortum on friday said it had raised its stake in german energy company uniper to percent while also reporting a rise in comparable operating profit in the fourth quarter citing higher electricity prices
fortum in june closed a billion euro billion deal to buy around percent of uniper
uniper has opposed the transaction saying the combination makes little sense given the energy group s heavy exposure to gas and power plants while fortum s focus is on clean technologies
since the closing of the offer we have increased our shareholding in uniper in order to further secure fortum s voting position in any future uniper general meeting fortum s chief executive pekka lundmark said in a statement
at the end of fortum held percent of uniper shares and voting fortum s comparable operating profit rose percent from a year ago to million euros million roughly in line with analysts average expectation of million in a reuters poll
fortum s results improved mainly as a result of higher power prices and increased nuclear production due to improved availability lundmark said
fortum s board of directors proposed an unchanged dividend of eur per share for the calendar year
