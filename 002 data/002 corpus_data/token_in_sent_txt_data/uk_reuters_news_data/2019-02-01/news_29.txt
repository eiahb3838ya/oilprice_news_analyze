gas production hit a record trillion cubic feet in october and another trillion cubic feet in november according to the energy information administration
gas production has been growing at rates of around percent per year the fastest rate for at least two decades
production is growing so fast that even with some of the coldest weather in decades supplies have remained adequate with no spike in prices and no forced curtailments by generators or significant loss of load
