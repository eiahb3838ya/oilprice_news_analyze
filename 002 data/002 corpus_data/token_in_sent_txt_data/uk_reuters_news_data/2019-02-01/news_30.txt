focus-boeing goes bionic to roll out more dreamliners
north charleston reuters boeing co is counting on a new kind of worker to help it reach a target of rolling out dreamliners from its factories each month half human half robot
the world s largest planemaker is equipping mechanics with exoskeletons similar to ones that allow cameramen to quickly navigate the sidelines of nfl football games to increase their strength and speed
the suits also help reduce fatigue on repetitive tasks such as overhead drilling
you have the capability of a robot and the capability of a human being melded together christopher reid a boeing associate technical fellow who previously designed nasa spacesuits told reuters during a factory tour
the new technology is an example a broader shift in the industry s focus towards production as planemakers face the task of making good on a record order boom
after a decade in which boeing and airbus generated massive orders fuelled by the rise of china and emerging markets the main battleground is shifting towards production strategy rather than market share
at twin dreamliner factories in south carolina and washington state boeing also plans to soon deploy smart wrenches that signal if machinists apply the correct torque to a nut and has introduced new work platforms to shave time off aircraft assembly according to people familiar with the technologies
such technology investments will help the manufacturer accelerate dreamliner production to a month from
chief executive officer dennis muilenburg announced the preliminary rate change on wednesday and said he expects to complete the production increase in the second quarter
building the carbon composite dreamliner at the new rate first reported by reuters is central to boeing s efforts to raise profit margins and claw back deferred production costs as it competes with airbus se in a crowded but lucrative widebody market
boeing rolls out a new with a minimum list price of million every days
at rate that new pace drops to days to make a new dreamliner
at today s rate boeing is reducing the billion billion pounds in deferred production costs by million per aircraft canaccord genuity analyst ken herbert said
that number will clearly improve at the new boeing estimates the exoskeletons which cost about apiece have sped up work tasks in test groups of mechanics in south carolina though boeing declined to share data
if trials continue to show improved safety and productivity boeing says it wants to deploy them to thousands of workers across the company over the next two years
in recent weeks boeing has also introduced work platforms similar to scaffolds that hug an airframe so mechanics can work as a jetliner pulses along the assembly line
before work stations had to be moved with fork lifts
boeing s mostly competes against the of which airbus builds a month
these widebody planes represent hundreds of billions of dollars in sales over years
both are modernizing their factories
but on widebody jets boeing s higher production rate gives it the advantage to drive down costs across its supply chain and sell more of its pricier dreamliner variants like the newest
in the fourth quarter boeing said its operating margin on commercial aircraft increased to percent from percent from a year ago partially driven by higher margins on the dreamliner widebody
in south carolina engineers in a tiny workstation known as an innovation cell huddle around computers printers and a virtual reality system to help mechanics test out new tools without snarling the factory flow
before the cells boeing said workers had no formal place to test out new ideas or complain about niggling problems leaving them to fester for years in some cases
boeing said three innovation cells in south carolina have saved millions of dollars in costs since with a raft of tools such as a curved ruler
the ruler alone cut six hours off the time it took a mechanic to all the placards mounted above the seats inside on section of a
in washington state it has opened innovation cells at its widebody plant in everett and its plant in renton also set for rate increase
the new technology is aimed to help cut back on the cost of inspections that boeing says have been made obsolete due to the new digital technology
don t inspect things twice mark stockton engineering director for boeing south carolina told reuters during the factory tour
inspect things once and validate things boeing said it did not expect that these changes in inspections will result in the loss of jobs
but a union official asked about the strategy warned it carries risks such as higher injury rates or potentially delayed aircraft deliveries if problems are discovered
removing thousands of inspections per airplane will negatively impact the manufacturing process and push defects down line iam spokeswoman connie kelliher said by email
