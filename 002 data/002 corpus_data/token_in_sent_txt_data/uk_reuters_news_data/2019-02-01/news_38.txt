insight-a climate problem even california can't fix: tailpipe pollution
los angeles feb reuters for three decades california has led the fight to control tailpipe pollution with countless policies promoting cleaner gasoline carpooling public transportation and its signature strategy the electric vehicle
californians now buy more than half of all evs sold in the united states and the state s policies have provided a model being adopted around the world
but they re not working at home by the state s own measure
tailpipe pollution here is going up not down despite billions of dollars spent by one of the most environmentally progressive governments on earth
the strategies that we ve used up until now just haven t been effective mary nichols the head of the california air resources board told reuters
that failure has less to do with energy or environmental policies and more with urban planning decisions that made california and especially los angeles a haven for sprawling development of homes and long commutes according to state officials
california s struggle bodes poorly for other major cities with similar sprawl and expensive urban housing such as houston atlanta and others that planned their cities around cars and casts doubt on whether the united states can meet its pledged carbon cuts under an international agreement to fight climate change
the state s troubles also hold lessons for massive economies including china and india major carbon emitters that hope to control pollution from vehicles as they rapidly urbanize
transportation is tied with power generation as america s leading source of carbon dioxide emissions at percent according to the environmental protection agency and it takes top billing in california at about percent
it makes up a smaller share in the rest of the world where car ownership is lower but likely to grow
california s carbon emissions amounted to million metric tons in the last year for which data is available
that s the lowest level since thanks to a shift away from electricity toward natural gas solar and wind
but its next target calling for a further percent cut by will be out of reach without transformative changes in state residents driving habits carb said in a report published late last year
as the state struggles to cut its own vehicle pollution california officials are also fighting an effort by the administration of president donald trump to weaken national standards for automobile emissions
a spokesman for governor gavin newsom who ran on a promise to continue california s legacy of climate action did not return requests for comment
california s tailpipe emissions have risen percent since according to carb data as population growth urban sprawl and a devotion to one s own car produced longer commutes and choking traffic
the increase came even as the state has finally caught traction in promoting electric and hybrid vehicles some million of which have been sold in the state since according to the alliance of automobile manufacturers
the government last year set a target of million electric vehicles by
but even hitting that goal by no means assured won t be near enough to allow the state to meet its goal for carbon reduction which would require california drivers to reduce per capita miles traveled by percent carb said in its report
the state has also boosted spending on public transport by about percent over the past decade according to carb
but transit options are poorly suited for california s vast expanses of neighborhoods
if we keep thinking we are going to overcome a system overnight that s wrong said hasan ikhrata executive director of the san diego association of governments the city s main public planning body
the united states has pledged to cut carbon emissions by between to percent from levels by under the paris agreement an international pact to fight climate change reached by nearly countries in
while president donald trump has signaled his intention to pull the united states out of the accord a group of states led by california wants to ensure the meets its commitments which scientists call critical to avoiding the most devastating effects of climate change
but california s problems and those of other sprawling cities suggest that meeting that goal will be difficult
in houston for example tailpipe emissions have soared percent posing a major challenge for the city s goal of becoming carbon neutral by
unlike california texas has no statewide reduction goals and the state s love affair with trucks is only deepening
more than two thirds of new vehicles registered in the houston area last year were pickup trucks or suvs compared to less than half in los angeles according to ihs markit a global financial information provider
electric cars by comparison represent just percent of new vehicle sales in texas according to the state s department of motor vehicles
in california it was around percent in the first eight months of last year according to data compiled by the alliance of automobile manufacturers
transportation emissions have also been rising in other major cities such as atlanta philadelphia and san antonio according to city climate emissions reports from recent years and have climbed about percent nationwide since according to the epa
other parts of the world could have an easier time
in europe residents of densely populated cities face high fuel taxes encouraging reduced car travel
many european cities have seen relatively high levels of electric car adoption
and in china and india which also have lofty electric vehicle targets major cities are still being built with pollution control in mind
they are much better able to bake in this kind of planning into their urban designs said john german a senior fellow with the international council on clean transportation
one example is china s new zone of xiongan a district to ease overcrowding in beijing which is being designed from scratch
in a document published in january the chinese government promised to incorporate development ideas such as commuter rail and efficient land use into its planning for xiongan to create a convenient safe green and intelligent transportation system
china is also seeking to improve fuel standards ban old cars and stop diesel trucks from entering certain areas as car ownership surges by about million vehicles per year
california officials eager to maintain the state s leadership role on climate action hope to pave the way for a fix to entrenched urban sprawl
los angeles is mulling a proposal to charge drivers during rush hour and use that money to make public transit free by according to metro chief executive phillip washington
other options include waiving fees for pooled rides to and from airports and adding safety lanes for scooters and bikes said dan sperling director of the institute of transportation studies at the university of california davis
carb deputy executive officer kurt karperos said the state is planning talks with municipal governments to discuss controlling emissions through city planning
such efforts could include housing in urban centers to bring people closer to work and the elimination of building codes requiring parking spots to encourage more carpooling according to experts
it is a tough problem karperos said
