super bowl organizers, partners expand bid to run clean energy show
new york feb thomson reuters foundation sunday s super bowl will score on the clean energy front with an environmental group and a beer maker for the first time offering to offset greenhouse gas emissions linked to fans travel and the host city of atlanta organizers said
more than a million people were expected to visit the southern city and surrounding area for championship game pitting the los angeles rams against the new england patriots
the environmental rocky mountain institute rmi and giant beer maker budweiser said they would purchase clean energy certificates to fuel the party
clean energy certificates are a way for one company to offset the amount of carbon dioxide it is producing by paying another company to produce less
rmi said it struck a deal with atlanta s airport to offset metric tons of carbon emissions pegged to fans air travel to the game generating equivalent greenhouse gases of cars driven for a year
the clean energy will come from capturing gas produced at two landfills rmi said
the deal also involved offset energy provider the good traveler
meanwhile the brewer of budweiser said it will donate clean electricity certificates to atlanta the amount of which will be calculated following the game
the contributions mark an expansion of an effort already more than a decade old to offset electricity associated with the annual game said jack groh director of the national football league s environmental program
the league previously purchased renewable energy certificates to cover the energy footprint associated with the host stadium convention center teams hotels and other items he said
typically energy use tied to the super bowl averages megawatts of energy per hour said groh generating greenhouse gasses equivalent to cars driven for a year
offset certificates have recently cost between and per he said
at pennsylvania state university judd michael a professor specializing in sports sustainability said that given the challenges of developing clean energy infrastructure for the sports event offsets may be the best option there if we can use the super bowl to encourage green energy such as solar wind and help to pay for the solar or wind power either way that s a positive for the development of those markets he added
natural gas accounts for just over percent of georgia s net electricity generation according to the state s government followed by nuclear energy and coal
cleaner sources such as hydroelectricity contributed just percent
burning fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal for energy emits greenhouse gases which cause global warming
the united states the world second largest emitter of greenhouse gases saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise by percent last year according to a preliminary estimate by the rhodium group an independent research organization
