update 1-australia had hottest month on record in january, heatwave to continue -weather bureau
melbourne reuters australia endured its hottest month on record in january with sweltering conditions expected to persist through april the country s weather bureau said on friday
the heatwave which saw temperatures above celsius fahrenheit for several days straight in some areas was mainly due to a high pressure system off the southeast coast that blocked cooler air from coming in the bureau of meteorology said
a delayed monsoon also kept cooler moist air coming in from the north and a warming trend that has pushed australian temperatures up by more than in the last years also contributed to the heat said andrew watkins a senior climatologist at the bureau
scorching weather last month triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring while bushfires have destroyed homes in the southern island state of tasmania
for maximum temperatures for minimum temperatures and for mean temperatures it s not only been our hottest january on record it s actually been our hottest month on record and those records go back to watkins said in a video on the bureau s website
odds are favoring that heat continuing at least through february into march and april he said
the mean temperature for january across the country exceeded the bureau said
the two most populous states new south wales and victoria recorded their warmest average low and high temperatures for january
at the same time new south wales suffered one of the driest januarys on record while victoria had less than percent of its average january rainfall
tasmania which depends on hydropower experienced its driest january on record
western australia had its driest january since
the weather bureau said on thursday that the west coast faces hot dry weather over the next three months which will dent the outlook for wheat production in the world s exporter
