like predecessor, trump's new epa pick packs schedule with industry meetings
feb reuters acting environmental protection agency chief andrew wheeler president donald trump s pick to run the agency permanently held nearly times more meetings with industry representatives than with conservationists during his first two months on the job according to a copy of his schedule
the industry focus fits neatly with the administration s efforts to reduce environmental red tape for companies but could add fuel to criticism from democrats that wheeler who is due to be confirmed by the senate in the coming days is too cozy with the industries he oversees
wheeler a longtime washington insider took the reins at epa in july after his predecessor scott pruitt resigned in a storm of controversy over his high spending on travel security and office equipment
during his first several weeks on the job wheeler met times with industry representatives including executives from bp valero fedex monsanto a unit of bayer and the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers association according to the newly released record of his schedule
he met just once with a conservation group the western pennsylvania conservancy according to the schedule which covers july and august and was obtained through a freedom of information act request by the sierra club
an epa official did not immediately provide a comment
pruitt had also held the vast majority of his meetings with industry representatives according to his public schedule
but in wheeler trump has seen another strong supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry without the constant criticism over alleged ethical violations that plagued pruitt
wheeler had worked at the epa in the and later in the senate under republican senator jim inhofe a skeptic of mainstream climate science before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant
he has said that he is not at all ashamed of his lobbying for the coal company murray energy corp which he has said focused on securing the pensions of miners
wheeler also lobbied for utility xcel energy inc and consulted for biofuels industry group growth energy agricultural merchant and biofuels producer archer daniels midland co and international paper co according to his public disclosures
during a senate hearing on his nomination last month wheeler said he did not believe climate change was the greatest crisis and defended the agency s moves under trump to roll back measures to fight global warming
