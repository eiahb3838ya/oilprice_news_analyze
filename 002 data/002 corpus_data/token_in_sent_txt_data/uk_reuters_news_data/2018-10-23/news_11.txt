iowa lawmaker urges epa to speed up rule expanding ethanol sales
washington reuters republican senator chuck grassley said on tuesday that the environmental protection agency must act quickly to allow sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends if president donald trump aims to keep a campaign promise to corn farmers
trump announced during a trip to iowa this month his intention to lift the summertime ban on sales of gasoline to help corn growers stung by slumping prices
the epa has since said it will finish deliberations on a proposal to lift the ban by may a timeline the administration hopes will put the rule in place before summer
but grassley said that was too slow
epa ought to speed it up
otherwise it is going to look like the president wasn t serious in his announcement he told a weekly conference call
we don t need a lot of bureaucratic red tape with something that has been discussed in washington for four to five years and discussed specifically with epa and with the president for about a year he said
trump s announcement encouraged farmers eager to expand the market for ethanol and was seen as a political victory for trump ahead of congressional elections in november
the epa s ban on summer sales was initially intended to reduce smog but academic studies have concluded that the ban is ineffective at improving air quality
trump s move however is likely to face pushback from the oil industry which has long opposed the rule change since it would cut into its share of the petroleum market
the industry has threatened to sue over the issue
some industry experts say the administration will ultimately need an act of the congress to change the rule
epa acting chief andrew wheeler however rejected that idea earlier this month saying the agency has the authority to move ahead alone
