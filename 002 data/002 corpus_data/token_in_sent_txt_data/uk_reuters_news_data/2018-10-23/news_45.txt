feature-zero carbon at sea? rotterdam port eyes a greener future
rotterdam oct thomson reuters foundation in rotterdam ships from around the world cruise in and out of europe s busiest port a bustling industrial hub that employs almost people and produces percent of the netherlands gases
as rotterdam tries to cut its emissions in line with global goals to curb global warming shipping emissions are a particular challenge not least because many fall outside the targets set by the paris agreement to curb climate change
but the city s bustling port is starting to take them on
it has introduced financial incentives for ships and other port facilities to invest in renewable power with the aim of slashing the port s carbon dioxide emissions from shipping and industry by percent by
by emissions would fall percent in line with national targets according to the plan
the goals fit alongside new efforts by the international maritime organization imo the united nations body that regulates shipping to cut shipping emissions which were not part of the paris agreement
the imo in april under pressure from island states for the first time set a target of slashing emissions by at least percent by compared to
such efforts will have implications beyond rotterdam with percent of global goods transported by ship and international shipping responsible for percent of greenhouse gas emissions the same total as germany according to the imo
every sector needs to do its bit to contribute to the fight against climate change natasha brown a spokeswoman for the imo told the thomson reuters foundation
rotterdam is one of more than cities from seoul to medellin that have pledged to buy only buses by and take other steps to make major areas of their city zero emission zones by
each is going about achieving the goal in its own way
but because cities account for about of carbon dioxide emissions according to the and consume more than of the world s energy whether they succeed or fail will have a huge impact on whether the world s climate goals are met
in rotterdam greening port facilities that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels and home to five large oil refineries is a first big task
doing nothing is not an option said caroline kroes programme lead of the energy transition strategy at the port
but making port facilities greener must be combined with efforts to cut global shipping emissions she said
the paris agreement is not possible if anyone stays behind
everyone will have to move and change kroes told the thomson reuters foundation at her office in rotterdam
in a bid to encourage cleaner shipping the port has introduced financial incentives for or vessels including an environmental ship index which began measuring the emissions of individual ships last year
since july all ships that dock at rotterdam port have received a score out of based on how much nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide they emit and carbon dioxide was added to the mix this year
using the index the port offers discounts on port costs to the cleanest ships
making ships and port processes more efficient also is key to slashing emissions kroes said
improving efficiency means you need less fuel so you save costs and reduce emissions at the same time she said
one way that is happening is by better coordinating ship arrivals and departures to cut waiting time
this year the port launched pronto a digital platform where shipping companies and service providers can exchange information about their port visits
that information exchange alone is expected to reduce waiting times for ships and cut emissions by up to percent according to leon willems a port spokesman
if ships on average spent hours less in harbour emissions from their visits would fall by percent according to a study released this month by the port of rotterdam authority
fully electric sea ships are not yet on the horizon in the netherlands as they are still costly to make and infrastructure to service them on shore is not yet in place kroes said
but vessels that operate on rivers and other inland water bodies in the netherlands are moving in that direction
this year the port of rotterdam formed a partnership with skoon energy a dutch startup that helps existing ships switch from fossil fuel engines to electric propulsion
the startup builds rechargeable battery packs known as skoonboxes that can be fitted on combined vessels
the port is helping the company establish a network of charging hubs for the swappable batteries
more and more companies are investing in ships with both electric engines and diesel generators in order to cut their costs and their emissions skoon energy founder peter paul van voorst told the thomson reuters foundation
we see people switching to hybrid vessels for various reasons efficiency reliable quality of the fuel and sustainability
it is a to have a clean ship
it s a better business case van voorst said in a telephone interview
among those making the switch is dutch company damen shipyards group which is trying out the skoonboxes over the next few months aboard the
borelli a vessel that transports containers between the ports of rotterdam and hengelo a city in the eastern netherlands
the skoonbox accompanied with a network of charging hubs will allow for full electric sailing
it is one of many ways to shift the shipping industry towards clean solutions said solco reijnders programme manager for innovation at damen shipyards
he said he would not be surprised that in years much of the shipping industry has shifted to completely operations
reaching the international maritime organization s targets to cut shipping emissions will be costly and take investment from both governments and private experts said
building onshore infrastructure is definitely the government s responsibility
ports are not going to build this as it is incredibly expensive said johan de jong international relations manager at the maritime research institute netherlands
a bit of help may be on the way
in the dutch government allocated million euros million for innovative shipping projects and in it is expected to unveil a new green deal to promote sustainable shipping
but more economically viable solutions are needed to encourage ship owners and operators to adopt or practices van voorst said
it is up to the renewable energy side to become a cheaper alternative he said
that is what it eventually comes down to is it cheaper to go clean or go dirty reporting by isabelle gerretsen editing by laurie goering
