update 3-dyson chooses singapore over britain to build electric car
london reuters james dyson the billionaire british inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner has chosen to build his electric car in singapore to be close to asian customers supply chains and a highly skilled workforce
the entrepreneur who backed brexit in the referendum already manufactures products such as hair dryers air purification systems and bladeless fans in asia while the company s research and development remains in britain
dyson said last year that a engineering team had been secretly working for more than two years on a billion project to build an electric car
the company one of britain s biggest manufacturing success stories has not shown any designs for its electric vehicle although james dyson has said it will not be like anything else on the market and will not be a very cheap
dyson who is not working with established car companies on the project had said the vehicle would be made close to suppliers and its potential biggest markets namely in asia
the decision of where to make our car is complex based on supply chains access to markets and the availability of the expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions dyson chief executive jim rowan said after singapore was chosen on tuesday
dyson already employs people making million digital electric motors every year in singapore
it said it would build a new manufacturing facility in the city state scheduled for completion in with the first cars rolling off production lines a year later
singapore s prime minister lee hsien loong said singapore used to assemble cars until the
now we will manufacture cars again except this time greener better and more high tech carmakers are stepping up investment in electric vehicles in response to emissions restrictions and penalties on the use of internal combustion engines with some countries already promising outright bans
dyson is looking to exploit its ability in battery technology and electric motors that are found in its innovative vacuum cleaners and other products
james dyson told reporters last year that his ambition to take on the car makers was triggered when the industry dismissed his idea to use the cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to clean diesel exhaust emissions in the
the inventor was a prominent backer of britain s vote to leave the european union and has argued that britain s future lies in building close ties with markets in asia and not europe
singapore is a densely populated and one of the world s most expensive places to own a car
it controls vehicle population through a system of bidding for the right to own and use a vehicle for a limited number of years
elon musk chief executive of tesla criticised singapore for not being supportive of electric vehicles earlier this year
but the city state has trade agreements with china and japan and dyson ceo rowan said the comparatively high cost base would be offset by its technology expertise and focus
it is therefore the right place to make technology loaded machines and the right place to make our electric vehicle he said
dyson started its work on the electric car in wiltshire western england where it is investing million pounds million in new buildings and a testing track at its campus
the company reported a percent rise in turnover to billion pounds last year and a percent rise in earnings to million pounds with percent of the growth coming from asia
