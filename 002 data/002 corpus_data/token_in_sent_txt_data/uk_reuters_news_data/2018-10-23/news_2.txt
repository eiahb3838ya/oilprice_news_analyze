trump says epa acting chief 'doing well,' may become permanent
washington reuters president donald trump said on tuesday that environmental protection agency acting administrator andrew wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist was doing a good job and could be nominated to permanently take on the role
he s acting but he s doing well so maybe he won t be so acting so long trump said at an event alongside wheeler
wheeler took the reins at epa after the agency s former head scott pruitt resigned in july following a slew of ethical controversies that included his travel security detail and expensive office equipment
pruitt had aggressively moved to roll back climate regulations and other environmental protections to unfetter the oil and coal mining industries
in wheeler trump has seen another strong supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that plagued pruitt
wheeler had worked at the epa in the and later in the senate under republican senator jim inhofe a skeptic of mainstream climate science before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant
he has said that he is not at all ashamed of his lobbying for the coal company murray energy corp the focus of criticism by environmentalists
wheeler also lobbied for utility xcel energy inc and consulted for biofuels industry group growth energy agricultural merchant and biofuels producer archer daniels midland co and international paper co according to his public disclosures
he has been in the job in an acting capacity for more than days one of the longest tenures for an acting chief at the agency in decades
the next permanent epa administrator must be nominated by trump and confirmed by the senate
wheeler has said that epa under his leadership would take the same course as under pruitt prioritize cleaning up industrial superfund sites areas contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the epa as a candidate for cleanup due to a risk to health the environment and financing investments in water infrastructure
