exclusive-exxon, rosneft to build lng plant with japanese, indian partners - sources
moscow reuters russia s rosneft and exxonmobil plan to build a liquefied natural gas lng plant in a consortium with indian and japanese partners spreading the estimated billion cost two sources familiar with the talks said
the four companies rosneft exxon japan s sodeco and india s ongc videsh are partners in the group of fields that will supply the gas but exxon and rosneft had initially planned to build the lng plant without the other consortium members
as well as spreading the costs among more stakeholders the broader involvement of the participants may mitigate sanctions risk
initially rosneft and exxon unveiled their joint plans to build an lng production site in russia s far east to president vladimir putin in
but production of the seaborne gas has so far failed to materialize for many reasons including international sanctions against moscow for its role in the ukraine conflict
lng production itself is not subject to sanctions but russian companies have limited access to financial markets due to the restrictions
exxon had to leave most of its other new joint projects with rosneft due to the west s punitive measures against moscow
two sources one person close to exxon and a rosneft executive not authorized to speak publicly said both firms are committed to carrying out the lng plant project within the framework of the agreement
a hydrocarbon project is led by exxon with a percent stake
twenty percent belongs to rosneft with the rest split between sodeco percent and ongc videsh percent
no one is interested in financing such a project alone the source close to exxon said
asked how the lng plant deal would be structured the senior rosneft executive said it will be the sources did not say how the financing of the lng plant would be shared between the participants
the source close to exxon said a decision whether to go ahead with the lng project was expected in otherwise the project risked losing its market amid growing competition
currently two lng plants novatek s yamal lng and gazprom s are producing the frozen gas in russia which has set an ambitious target of more than doubling its global lng market share to percent in the next decade
is pumping close to barrels of crude oil per day a record high as well as natural gas that it has been unable to sell abroad
gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from russia
has to pump most of the gas back into the ground while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region
talks with gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results
rosneft ongc and sodeco declined to comment
the russian energy ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment
the consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize gas resources an exxonmobil spokeswoman in moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to reuters questions
igor sechin rosneft chief executive said in june that the lng plant would be built just across the tatarsky strait in the port of de kastri in russia s khabarovsk region where rosneft already has an export terminal for oil
sechin said then that the plant s annual capacity was seen at million tonnes of lng with supplies aimed at starting in
gazprom s has an annual capacity of million tonnes
the source close to exxon confirmed the technical plans for the plant and said the project partners are considering the option of laying a gas pipe along the existing oil pipeline from to the lng plant in de kastri
