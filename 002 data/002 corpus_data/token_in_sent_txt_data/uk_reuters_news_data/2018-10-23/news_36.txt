corrected-column-oil market can see past khashoggi killing, but not iran: russell
launceston australia reuters saudi arabia s killing of a journalist and the ramping up of sanctions against iran have added a layer of uncertainty to crude oil markets creating a dilemma as to whether these events are real price drivers or just temporary noise
the death of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi at the kingdom s consulate in istanbul has generated a constant stream of headlines often with contradictory messages for the outlook for oil supply and prices
examples included a veiled saudi threat to restrict its oil production in response to any sanctions over the killing and a suggestion that president donald trump is khashoggi s death to support his saudi allies and increase his leverage over them to boost the kingdom s crude output
while it is the job of the media to pursue the story and all related angles the twists and turns of the tale ultimately do little to illuminate the likely path of the crude oil market
oil analysts are often reluctant to partake in political discussions preferring the relative safety of supply and demand fundamentals trusting that these will eventually overcome what they hope are temporary influences
but perhaps the better approach would be to stand back and try to dispassionately look at the likely reasonable outcomes of the killing of khashoggi
the death according to the available details seems either premeditated murder or the result of incompetence that resulted in khashoggi being killed
either way the likely result is condemnation and action by western countries and a trial of sorts of the perpetrators all against the backdrop of trying to avoid placing blame on saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman
what does this mean for the oil market
most likely very little beyond what is already happening
the saudis will continue to try and increase production and meet the demand needs of consuming countries that are being forced to cut back their purchases of iranian crude
and while the khashoggi killing may generate anger at the brazen saudi attempt and raise concerns about the consequences of trump s continual characterisation of the media as the enemy of the people it s likely that for oil the outcome will be business as usual
the likelihood that saudi arabia will try to increase its oil output however doesn t answer the question of whether this will be enough to offset the loss of iranian barrels
sanctions against iran ratchet up early next month and the trump administration s stated goal is to reduce the islamic republic s exports to zero
nobody believes this is likely
the issue though is how much less oil iran will supply to the world market and can this be made up elsewhere
tracking iran s exports has become more challenging in recent weeks as the country s oil tankers have taken to switching off their tracking monitors
it does seem likely that iran s exports are around million barrels per day bpd which is about to bpd below potential
it also seems clear that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec of which saudi arabia is the largest producer has so far been unable to make up for the reduction in iranian supplies
saudi energy minister khalid said opec and its allies including russia would pump roughly an extra million bpd following an agreement in june to raise supplies to offset any losses caused by sanctions on iran
an internal document prepared by opec s vienna headquarters for a technical panel meeting on friday showed however that opec members excluding nigeria libya and congo pumped only an extra bpd in september compared to may
this suggests the market may well be short of oil if sanctions force more buyers to avoid iranian crude
once again politics is playing a part in this process with treasury secretary steven mnuchin giving seemingly contradictory statements in an interview with reuters in jerusalem on
mnuchin said it would be harder for buyers to obtain waivers to continue buying iranian crude than it was under sanctions put in place during the administration of president barrack obama
but he also said the loss of iranian cargoes was already priced into the market and he didn t expect oil costs to rise in the wake of next month s sanctions
if though iranian crude supplies are severely curtailed it s likely mnuchin will discover that the market is currently only priced for the current reduction in tehran s oil shipments
relying on a boost in oil output from other places such as shales ignores differences in crude qualities and won t necessarily help ease the loss of iranian medium to heavy sour grades
overall as disturbing as the killing of khashoggi is the impact on the oil market will likely be muted as it isn t in the interest of anyone to provoke a disruption
meanwhile the impact of renewed sanctions on tehran has yet to be quantified and may come down to a who blinks first scenario as successfully restrictions on the trade of iranian barrels would likely increase prices and cause pain to the united states and its allies
