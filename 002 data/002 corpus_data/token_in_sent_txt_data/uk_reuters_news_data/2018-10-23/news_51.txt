reduce and reuse raw materials to slash waste and emissions, un and think-tanks urge
london oct thomson reuters foundation the rapid consumption of raw materials must be curbed to cut waste and carbon emissions the united nations and global have urged with resource consumption set to almost double by especially in developing economies
in the century the world mined times more construction materials than ever before the international resource panel irp and the
environment programme unep said in a report on tuesday
we are using the planet s resources at a faster rate than they can be replenished while polluting our seas air and countryside with the waste from our consumption habits head of

it would also boost green jobs and technology and reduce the need to extract raw materials the report added
currently accounts for about per cent of production across the and europe the report said
the traditional manufacturing model where we make use and then dispose of a product is both wasteful and polluting environment s solheim said in the report released at the world circular economy forum in japan
