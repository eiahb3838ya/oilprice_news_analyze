update 3-greece, turkey snipe over maritime borders
reuters turkey warned greece on tuesday it would not tolerate a shift in greece s maritime border drawing a sharp rebuke from athens that it would decide when and how it exercises its sovereign rights
the statements from both sides came a few days after greece s former foreign minister said greece planned to extend its territorial waters to miles to the west of the country
territorial waters are a sensitive issue between the two neighbours and nato allies who are separated by the aegean sea and have been at odds over airspace ethnically split cyprus and offshore mineral rights for decades
turkey has previously warned it could not preclude military action to defend its interests
former greek foreign minister nikos kotzias who resigned last week said on saturday that athens planned to extend its territorial waters in the ionian sea which flanks the west coast of the country
the planned measure would not affect the aegean region off greece s eastern and southern coasts
turkey s foreign ministry however said that it had noted previous statements from athens of plans for the gradual expansion of greek territorial waters
it is not possible to tolerate steps where there is no bilateral agreement on the aegean where the two countries have mutual shores foreign ministry spokesman hami aksoy said in a statement
in athens a foreign ministry spokesman said greece s rights would not be dictated by third parties
the extension of the coastal zone is a legal and inalienable sovereign right of greece in accordance with international law he said
the relevant decision for an extension is exclusively up to greece which has the right to extend its territorial waters whenever and as it sees turkey s statement recalled a declaration of the turkeish parliament which had authorised action not excluding military action to safeguard turkish interests
parliament s declaration dated june has the necessary political warning in this context and it still maintains its validity today the turkish statement added
that view had been conveyed to greece s ambassador in turkey it said
