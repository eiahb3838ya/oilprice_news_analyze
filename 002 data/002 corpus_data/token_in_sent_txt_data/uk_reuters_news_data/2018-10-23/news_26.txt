plastic to ride: indonesians swap bottles for bus tickets
surabaya reuters indonesia s city has come up with a novel way to encourage its residents to recycle waste giving free bus rides in exchange for used plastic bottles
under the scheme launched by surabaya in april commuters can ride red city buses by dropping off plastic bottles at terminals or directly paying a fare with bottles
a bus ticket costs plastic cups or up to five plastic bottles depending on their size which the city hopes will help it meet an ambitious target of becoming free of plastic waste by
surabaya is the first city in indonesia to implement this scheme
garbage like plastic bottles piles up in my neighborhood so i brought it here so the environment is not only cleaner but also to help ease the workload of garbage collectors said surabaya resident linda rahmawati
city data shows that percent or nearly tonnes of surabaya s daily waste is plastic
a bus can collect up to kg lb of plastic bottles a day or roughly tonnes in a month the data shows
after collection labels and bottle caps are removed from the waste and it is auctioned off to recycling companies
money earned from the auction goes toward running the bus operations and to fund green spaces in the city located on the eastern tip of java indonesia s main island
the world s populous country is home to the largest expanse of tropical rainforest in asia but also struggles with traffic in its congested cities
indonesia is one of the biggest contributors in the world for plastic waste and through this initiative we hope to raise public awareness on the environment especially issues that relate to plastic trash said irvan wahyu drajad the head of surabaya s transportation department
indonesia an archipelago of thousands of islands is estimated to be the world s contributor of plastic pollutant in the oceans after china according to a study published in science journal
another surabaya resident also welcomed the scheme
we can reduce trash so it doesn t pile up at home because we can just bring them in and make good use of it
it is a situation said sulastri who like many indonesians uses one name
