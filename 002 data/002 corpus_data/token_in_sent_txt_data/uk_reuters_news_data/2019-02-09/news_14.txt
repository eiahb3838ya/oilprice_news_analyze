exclusive-venezuela moves to replace u.s. executives on citgo board -sources
reuters venezuelan oil company pdvsa is taking steps to remove at least two american executives from the board of directors of its refining subsidiary citgo petroleum corp according to people close to the matter
citgo is facing unprecedented challenges to its finances and management after the government last week imposed tough sanctions on petroleos de venezuela designed to prevent oil revenue from going to leftist president nicolas maduro
the united states and dozens of other nations have refused to recognize maduro viewing his reelection last year to another term as fraudulent
venezuela s president juan guaido is setting up bank accounts with help that would take income accrued by citgo venezuela s top foreign asset to finance an interim government
maduro has denounced guaido as a puppet who is seeking to foment a coup
the board of citgo includes at least two citizens art klein and rick esser as well as venezuelans asdrubal chavez frank gygax nepmar escalona simon suarez and alejandro escarra according to one of the people familiar with the matter
pdvsa and citgo did not respond to requests for comment
esser and klein did not immediately reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment on their status
it was unclear if pdvsa s board has already approved the changes at citgo s board and who would replace the american executives
citgo also has an executive board that includes the refiner s general managers its corporate treasurer and the controller and other vice presidents
esser was among a team of citgo executives who met with officials last month in washington amid efforts by guaido and the government to appoint a new citgo board of directors
citgo operates three refineries that supply about percent of total fuel production and is pdvsa s largest customer for its oil exports
sanctions have forced citgo and other refiners to seek crude oil supplies from other nations
citgo operates plants in texas louisiana and illinois that are capable of processing a combined barrels per day of oil
it distributes fuel through about independent retail stations in states
citgo which has been owned by pdvsa for three decades has not publicly detailed the composition of its current board since late when asdrubal chavez a cousin of the late venezuelan leader hugo chavez was nominated by maduro to run the business unit
asdrubal chavez escalona and escarra have been working from an office in the bahamas since the sanctions were issued according to the sources
on friday venezuelan oil minister and pdvsa president manuel quevedo held a meeting with his deputy ministers and directors one of the people said
the agenda was not revealed
