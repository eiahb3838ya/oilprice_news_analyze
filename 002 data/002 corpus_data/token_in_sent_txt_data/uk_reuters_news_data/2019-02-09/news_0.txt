exclusive-venezuela shifts oil ventures' accounts to russian bank -document, sources
adds details from pdvsa document context bylines by corina pons and marianna parraga caracas feb reuters venezuela s oil company pdvsa is telling customers of its oil joint ventures to deposit sales proceeds at an account it recently opened at russia s gazprombank ao according to sources and an internal document seen by reuters on saturday
pdvsa s move follows tough new financial sanctions imposed on and aimed at blocking leftist president nicolas maduro s access to the country s oil revenue
the united states and dozens of other nations have refused to recognize maduro characterizing his election last year to another term as fraudulent
since then pdvsa has been pressing its foreign partners at joint ventures in its orinoco belt producing area to formally decide whether they will continue in the projects according to two sources with knowledge of the talks
the joint ventures partners include norway s equinor asa chevron corp and france s total sa
pdvsa also ordered its petrocedeno joint venture with equinor and total to halt oil output and upgrading due to a lack of naphtha needed to dilute production as sanctions prohibited suppliers of the fuel from exporting it to venezuela
we would like to make formal your knowledge of new banking instructions to make payments in dollars or euros said pdvsa s finance vice president fernando de quintal in a letter dated to the pdvsa unit that supervises its joint ventures
even after a first round of financial sanctions in pdvsa s joint ventures managed to keep bank accounts in the united states and europe to receive proceeds
they also used correspondent banks in the united states and some european nations to move money to pdvsa s own collecting accounts in china
pdvsa several weeks ago informed customers of the new bank directions and has begun moving the accounts of its joint ventures which can export crude separately
the decision was made amid tension with some of its partners which have withdrawn staff from caracas since sanctions were imposed
