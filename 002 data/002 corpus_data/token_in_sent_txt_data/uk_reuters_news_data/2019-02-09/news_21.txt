update 1-chinese businessman denies reported justification for australian visa cancellation
sydney reuters a prominent chinese businessman and political donor linked in the past to a row about the promotion of chinese interests said on friday australia s decision to rescind his visa was based on nothing more than speculation
huang xiangmo is unable to return to australia after the government rejected his application for citizenship and revoked his visa while he was overseas newspaper reports said this week
australian media citing unidentified sources said huang was denied residency after intelligence agencies concluded he could undertake acts of foreign interference and that he was unfit for residency
huang rejected that assessment and criticised australia in his first public comments since the visa cancellation was revealed
it is profoundly disappointing to be treated in such a grotesquely unfair manner
the decision to cancel my visa was based on unfounded speculations that are prejudiced and groundless huang told the australian financial review
there are many australian companies in china aren t they more likely to be susceptible to potential manipulation by the chinese government he said
representatives for australia s department of home affairs and a spokeswoman for minister for immigration david coleman did not respond immediately to requests for comment
china s foreign ministry in a short statement read over the telephone to reuters said it did not know anything about the issue but that china never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries
huang s expulsion comes as australia and china seek to repair ties that have been strained since when canberra accused beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs
china denies the accusation
huang emerged as one of australia s biggest political donors soon after he began living in australia
he rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was forced to resign in when allegations emerged that he was linked to interests
the lawmaker sam dastyari sought to encourage a senior politician not to meet a chinese activist opposed to beijing s rule in hong kong in
dastyari was also recorded warning huang that his phone may be tapped
huang stopped political donations after that incident but later expanded his business interests in australia
he paid nearly a billion million in for two australian projects owned by chinese conglomerate dalian wanda group
