update 13-oil mixed as saudi output rises, equities rebound
new york reuters oil was mixed on friday as a canadian supply outage supported crude prices while an increase in production from opec s biggest exporter saudi arabia pushed brent lower
crude futures gained cents or percent to settle at a barrel
global benchmark brent slipped cents to settle at a barrel
for the week wti futures lost about percent after hitting a high on tuesday while brent lost about percent
crude was bullish after official data on thursday showed inventories at cushing the delivery point for crude futures fell to their lowest in years
that came after an outage at a major canadian oil sands facility cut regional supply
the outage at the barrels per day bpd syncrude facility in canada has contributed to a sharp reduction in the discount for crude versus brent crude over the past month
the discount has halved to a barrel on friday from in early june
we re continuing to see and i expect the trend will continue lower inventories in cushing in july resulting in a very tight light sweet crude market said andrew lipow president of lipow associates
that has been exacerbated by the canadian syncrude outage which has resulted in a scramble for supplies in the midwest

saudi arabia told the organization of the petroleum exporting countries that it increased production by almost barrels per day last month
opec and its allies agreed earlier this month to a modest increase in output to dampen the oil price rally which hit a year high
the supply increase reversed some of the cuts that opec and other major producers put in place in early to end several years of supply glut
saudi arabia also said it would reduce the official selling price of its august barrels
markets also garnered support from a government employment report showing growth in jobs
that blunted the impact of an escalating trade war
we re seeing a bounce to the upside thanks to spillover from a really good jobs number and strength in equity markets as well as a draw in cushing stocks said jim ritterbusch president of ritterbusch and associates
the trade war has yet to have a direct impact on oil markets but china has indicated it could place tariffs on crude imports
if that happens chinese demand would then shift to other suppliers
because the oil market is already in tight supply due to the numerous outages this would drive international prices brent further up commerzbank said in a note
producers continued to bring more rigs into oilfields already producing at record levels
the rig count an early indicator of future output was up by five in the week to july according to general electric co s baker hughes energy services firm
that brings the total count to up from last year
