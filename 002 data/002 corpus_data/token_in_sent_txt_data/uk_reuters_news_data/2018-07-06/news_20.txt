climate change boosts wine production in beer-loving belgium
brussels reuters etienne rigo stands in his vineyard in the centre of belgium enjoying the fruits of climate change
rising temperatures are boosting the wine trade in europe northern climbs production has quadrupled in belgium since according to government figures
the amount of land given over to grapes there has risen even faster
for more information see but as well as the volume there s the taste
twenty years ago we had wines that had tastes of citrus lemon and a bit grapefruit
today we have wines that are closer to exotic products lychee pineapple
this is a notable evolution rigo of the domaine de mellemont winery tells reuters
we had much lighter wines years ago
today we have wines that are fatter with a longer finish and a much longer twelve years ago vines covered just hectares square miles of belgium a country better known for its beers data from belgium s economy ministry show
last year that area had expanded almost to cover hectares still miniscule compared to neighbouring france but a start
it is part of a clear pattern according to wim thiery a climate scientist at vub university in brussels
we do clearly see a shift where regions in the mediterranean which are currently suitable for viticulture will no longer be suitable in the future or less and less suitable he said
instead regions in northern europe such as belgium will become suitable in the future for vineyards and for wine there are downsides
climate change has generally made weather more erratic which can hurt vineyards says thiery
but most of the changes have been more gradual
production has climbed tastes have evolved and the harvests have edged earlier at domaine de mellemont km miles southwest of brussels
workers there used to call one of their picking seasons the all saints harvest because of its closeness to the festival at the end of october
this year we re planning on harvesting our grapes around late september or early october says rigo
when it comes to the changes he has seen in the last few years he is happy to focus on the positive
belgian wine is very young
it is still in its adolescence when it comes to grape variety terroir
in the coming years i think we will discover some really fantastic reporting by julia echikson editing by bartunek and andrew heavens
