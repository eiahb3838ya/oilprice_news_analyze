update 2-conoco to depose citgo in hunt for pdvsa's caribbean assets
houston reuters conocophillips moved to bring venezuelan pdvsa s refining unit citgo petroleum into its legal battles to enforce a billion arbitration award against the south american country s nationalization of its venezuelan assets
a district court judge in houston on thursday ruled conoco can depose citgo as preparation for a court case against pdvsa and others over alleged asset transfers in the caribbean that conoco claims were designed to frustrate its efforts to obtain payment under an international chamber of commerce icc award
citgo declined to comment citing a policy regarding ongoing litigation
conoco is pleased with the court s decision spokesman daren beaudo said in a statement
the company has not received any payment from pdvsa for the award and will continue to pursue the matter he added
the decision is another blow to the venezuelan oil company which has struggled to pay creditors as its oil production has fallen to the lowest level in more than three decades
conoco alleges pdvsa transferred crude and fuels stored at the isla refinery and bullenbay terminal in curacao to citgo to prevent it from seizing the oil to enforce the icc award according to its filing with a district in houston
the court filing portrays active and often successful efforts by pdvsa and its subsidiary to defeat conoco s bids to seize oil cargoes and other assets
in one case it claims pdvsa caused citgo petroleum to claim ownership of cargoes off aruba as a way to lift the company s liens conoco said in its june filing
pdvsa also denied court officers access to some ships docked near curacao and at least one vessel temporarily disabled its gps transponder to make a getaway avoiding seizure the filing said
conoco s assets in venezuela were expropriated in after the late president hugo chavez nationalized several oil projects by forcing their conversion into joint ventures controlled by pdvsa
conoco and exxon mobil corp left venezuela after they were unable to reach agreements with pdvsa
as part of the arbitration award conoco was able to place liens on assets owned or rented in curacao aruba bonaire and eustatius including inventories held at refineries and terminals and cargoes aboard vessels
but those efforts have been hindered by local groups and courts
a curacao court provisionally lifted conoco s claims on the isla refinery in may after public utilities and the island s government petitioned the court citing their need for the fuels
