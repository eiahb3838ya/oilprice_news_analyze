macron gathers world's top sovereign funds to send climate signal
paris reuters sovereign wealth funds managing more than trillion trillion pounds are to lay out a strategy on friday in paris to pressure companies to be more french officials said
president emmanuel macron who has cast himself as the guardian of the paris agreement on climate change since washington announced it would pull out is championing the initiative which will bring together the heads of six sovereign funds to thrash out a investment framework
the guidelines which funds will ask the companies they invest in to meet are expected to influence other big asset managers french presidential advisers said
beyond the colossal amounts these funds manage it s the snowball effect we re betting on one adviser at macron s office said
by getting them to make this joint pledge there will be a ricochet effect spreading across global with five of the funds coming from nations abu dhabi kuwait saudi arabia qatar and norway and the sixth from new zealand the elysee dismissed suggestions the funds could just be opportunistically jumping on the climate bandwagon
they could have told us that s none of your business the adviser said
so a big part of our work has been to create trust and show there is political leadership to get them moving showcase them
it s not lawrence yanovitch an american national who is coordinating the initiative said the funds understood it was in their financial interest to take account of the risks of climate change in their investments and that most of their countries were already seeking to transition towards economies
they also see a business opportunity the former bill and melinda gates foundation investment manager said
financial markets are risky because they don t take these climate risks into the guidelines will include obligations for companies to calculate their carbon footprints he said
the initiative comes a year after president donald trump said the united states the world s second biggest greenhouse gas emitter after china would pull out of the deal brokered in paris in to limit global warming to well below degrees above times
macron took a dig at trump at the time saying he would not give up the fight and will make our planet great that and macron s background as a former investment banker encouraged the sovereign funds to work with france on the framework yanovitch said
they see him as a committed leader on climate he said
he s got this background he s a banker
he understood that the funds were the strategic entry point
if you motivate them it will cascade editing by leigh thomas and mark potter
