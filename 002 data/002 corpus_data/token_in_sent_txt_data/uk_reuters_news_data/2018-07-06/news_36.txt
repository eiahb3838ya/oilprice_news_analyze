german court: investigators may use files seized from vw law firm
karlsruhe germany july reuters a german federal court on friday ruled that munich prosecutors may use files seized last year during a raid on jones day the law firm that volkswagen had hired to investigate its emissions scandal
shortly after the dieselgate scandal broke in september vw hired jones day and advisory firm deloitte to investigate the circumstances of its wrongdoing and who was responsible
prosecutors in march searched the offices of jones day and the headquarters of vw s audi brand
vw fought the use of any files taken in the raid and the constitutional court in july issued a temporary order blocking munich prosecutors from assessing the material
the court on friday dismissed vw s legal challenge and said that the seizure of the jones day documents did not infringe on vw s right to a fair legal process
