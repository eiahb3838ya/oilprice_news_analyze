update 1-trafigura promotes luckock, gillon to co-heads of oil
london reuters trading house trafigura has promoted its two of risk ben luckock and robert gillon to become of oil trading sources said in a gradual transition of power from veteran oil chief jose larocca
trafigura has been reshuffling its management in recent months bolstering the position of chief executive jeremy weir while also giving more responsibility to the next generation of potential leaders
larocca a trafigura veteran and among the closest allies of the late founder claude dauphin had previously been the only head of the oil division
larocca will remain an executive director at trafigura and will oversee the oil division while helping luckock and gillon assume their leadership responsibilities the sources told reuters
luckock and gillon will manage daily activities including all speculative trading the sources said
luckock has expressed bullish views on oil prices over the past year
he was among the first traders to predict a spike in prices last year saying that the market would see a supply crunch amid soaring global demand and output disruptions around the world
in march luckock said that even though shale output was set to expand at a fast pace growth was slowing down and was not enough to cover unexpectedly strong global oil consumption
