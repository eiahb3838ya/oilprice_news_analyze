global lng-new spot supply, tender cancellation saps spot price
london july reuters asian spot liquefied natural gas lng prices declined for a third week on producers from australia to nigeria boosting spot supply strong european lng inventories and pakistan s cancellation of a tender
spot prices for august delivery in asia fell to per million british thermal units btu down cents from the previous week trade sources said
prices continued reversing from a rally last month driven by large concurrent global production outages and tenders seeking more than cargoes for
the market was not fully out of the woods as malaysia s giant bintulu complex may have shut in some production for planned maintenance traders said
the facility spent last month troubleshooting unexpected electrical faults that impeded output
angola lng planned to shut this month ahead of an early august restart
australia s ichthys project meanwhile fell further behind schedule delaying first lng as developer inpex patched what it called minor issues
on a more positive note cheniere energy s corpus christi project in texas got the green light this week to introduce gas into the facility raising the prospect of test lng exports later this year
the second train from yamal lng in russia s arctic should start pumping in september
the fifth train from cheniere s sabine pass plant in louisiana starts the following month
a spell of hot weather in japan led kansai electric to buy this week but demand for august and september was still limited there though chinese consumption was brisk in part driven by new government policy mandating that domestic importers boost storage capacity
new rules ask gas suppliers to hold at least percent of imports in storage by a policy that may be hastening buying demand at chinese terminals a trader said
still burgeoning supply proved decisive
nigeria lng offered three july cargoes as its fifth production unit resumes this month ap lng in australia abu dhabi and angola had spare july shipments plus pakistan s decision to scrap its tender was also expected to release egyptian supply into spot markets
in its tender pakistan lng received offers from vitol and gunvor in the percent of brent range but a sharp downturn in prices subsequently means spot prices are now closer to percent in brent terms
the prospect of paying such steep premiums as monsoon rains lowered cooling demand led pakistan to cancel its tender
a promising outlet for pakistan s cancelled cargoes could be india where india oil corp and bharat petroleum have shown demand
in europe lng terminal inventories saw a minor decline in aggregate but remained robust and in certain markets such as britain the netherlands and parts of france stocks had risen
it suggests further supply availability for potential reloads a further bearish factor
