foreign ministers meet for first time since exit iranians want guarantees on oil export revenue europeans proposing package of economic measures by john irish and francois murphy vienna july reuters iran wants world powers to present measures guaranteeing oil revenue and investment into the country despite sanctions when ministers meet on friday to save the nuclear deal but european states will fall short of its demands diplomats said
president donald trump pulled the united states out of the multinational deal in may under which sanctions on iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme verified by the international atomic energy agency iaea
washington has since told countries they must stop buying the opec producer s oil from or face financial consequences
foreign ministers from britain china france germany and russia meet with their iranian counterpart in vienna for the first time since trump left the pact but diplomats see limited scope for salvaging it
the objective is to save the deal
we ve made some progress including on safeguarding some crude sales but it s unlikely to meet iranian expectations
it s also not just about what the europeans can do but also how the chinese russians indians others can contribute said a senior european diplomat
the pillars of the european union s strategy are european investment bank lending a special measure to shield eu companies from secondary sanctions and a commission proposal that eu governments make direct money transfers to iran s central bank to avoid penalties
the iranians expect the others to say what we are going to do to keep the deal alive
we will have to see if it is going to be good enough for them an eu source added
describing the friday meeting as important iranian officials have said that key for them is to ensure measures that guarantee oil exports do not halt and that tehran still has access to the swift international bank payments messaging system
during a visit to europe this week president hassan rouhani warned that iran could reduce its with the nuclear watchdog having already threatened trump of the consequences of fresh sanctions against iranian oil sales
rouhani was quoted by state media and on his website after calls with french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel as having told them he was disappointed with their package which did not go far enough
swift is the key but iran has to stay in at least until the end of the year to maintain divisions between the eu and keep some credibility and try and survive amidst forthcoming sanctions said sanam vakil associate fellow at chatham house a international think tank
while talks are expected to focus purely on the nuclear deal they come amid increasing rhetoric from the trump administration which argues that iran poses a serious security threat
an iranian diplomat was among four people arrested on suspicion of plotting an attack on an iranian opposition group in france last week
the issue could be a distraction in the vienna talks
iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot and has demanded the official be released without delay
any confirmation that iranian authorities were behind the plot could make it politically difficult for european leaders to continue to back the nuclear deal
