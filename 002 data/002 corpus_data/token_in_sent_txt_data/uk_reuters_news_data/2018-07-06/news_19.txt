update 3-vw loses bid to block investigators examining legal files
karlsruhe germany reuters volkswagen has lost a legal challenge to prevent prosecutors from examining unpublished documents about its emission scandal with germany s top court ruling on friday that files seized from a law firm may be reviewed
it means the information from the files may be made public as part of any criminal proceedings thus providing more ammunition for shareholders and car owners seeking damages
shortly after the dieselgate scandal broke in september vw hired law firm jones day and advisory firm deloitte to investigate the issue and look at who was responsible
vw never published the findings of the jones day investigation although a summary was compiled in the form of a statement of facts for the department of justice
prosecutors searched the munich offices of jones day in march in connection with a fraud probe related to litre diesel engines made by vw s premium unit audi
vw fought the use of any files taken in the raid and the constitutional court last july issued a temporary order blocking munich prosecutors from assessing the material
the dismissal of vw s legal challenge by the federal constitutional court on friday is a further blow to vw which is still grappling with the implications of the dieselgate scandal almost three years after it came to light
munich state prosecutors said it was not yet clear when they would start to examine the seized folders and computer data but that they hoped they would make their investigations easier
volkswagen shares were down percent at gmt slightly underperforming the dax index of leading german shares
the ruling comes just weeks after vw was fined billion euros billion over emissions cheating one of the highest fines ever imposed on a company by german authorities
munich prosecutors have also widened a probe into vw s luxury brand audi to include now suspended chief executive rupert stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising
lawyers enjoy some protection from raids in germany but the court on friday said that the seizure of the jones day documents did not infringe on vw s right to a fair legal process
it said that as a firm jones day could not ask for protection of the german constitution and that the lawyers themselves who had complained were not personally affected
the court also said that there was a risk of abuse should lawyers be protected from raids in anything other than special circumstances because evidence could be purposefully stored with lawyers or only selectively published
vw said it welcomed the fact that the court s decision brought some clarity on the issue even if the court disagreed with the carmaker
the statement of facts published as part of a billion settlement with authorities detailed a concerted effort by certain vw employees to destroy documents in anticipation of an order to preserve them
the investigations singled out six senior managers below board level an attorney and other vw employees
vw has argued that the development of illegal software also known as defeat devices was the work of employees and that no management board members were involved
prosecutors have challenged this by indicting vw s former ceo martin winterkorn
last month munich prosecutors arrested audi ceo stadler though he has not been charged with any crime
