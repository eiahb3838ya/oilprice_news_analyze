corrected-nigeria's dangote expects new oil refinery to account for half of group assets
corrects capacity of refinery to barrels per day from tonnes in paragraph by chijioke ohuocha and didi akinyelure lagos july reuters an oil refinery being built by aliko dangote will account for half of his conglomerate s assets when it is finished next year a senior executive told reuters underscoring the scale of the bet being made by africa s richest man on nigerian oil and gas
dangote has built his fortune on cement although his sprawling business empire also spans flour milling agriculture and real estate
now he is building the world s largest single oil refinery and also expanding into fertiliser aiming to address problems in nigeria s energy markets
though africa s biggest crude oil producer nigeria imports almost all of its gasoline due to poor maintenance of its four refineries
dangote hopes to meet the fuel needs of africa s most populous nation where poor power supply forces families and businesses to rely on generators
dangote group executive director devakumar edwin said the billion refinery should be completed by december
as of today cement is the biggest part of the group
by the refinery will be the biggest by assets he told reuters in an interview at the site in the lekki district of southwestern lagos state
dangote cement nigeria s biggest listed company has attracted investment from dubai and south african sovereign funds
it posted a profit of billion naira million up percent on and is valued at billion
edwin said the oil refinery with a capacity of barrels per day would also target export markets
our primary focus is nigeria to meet the entire local demand but we have the capacity to export more than percent of what we produce so the secondary focus will be on western africa and central africa he said
edwin said the company had held talks with firms including vitol and shell over the supply of crude and lifting of petroleum products for sale abroad
the dangote refinery will be able to process different grades of crude including shale oil
the company is borrowing billion for the project arranged by standard chartered bank
the remainder will be funded by equity and through export agencies edwin said
dangote has also acquired two oil fields in nigeria from shell to help supply the refinery
edwin said the first phase of the million tonne capacity fertiliser plant on the same lagos state site would be completed in september and start operating in december
the second line also million tonnes will start four months later he added
the refinery and petrochemical complex located on hectares of swampy land includes a jetty to ferry products by sea within nigeria and abroad and an undersea pipeline to transport gas
dangote will consider listing the oil refinery once it comes onstream edwin added
he said that would follow a planned listing of the cement company in london next year after elections in nigeria
that listing has been mooted for a number of years
plans have been delayed to enable the company to meet requirements for the listing which edwin said had been completed
he said the listing could help it fund acquisitions overseas
