update 1-nigerian court clears senate president of asset-declaration charges
adds senate president comment context abuja july reuters nigeria s supreme court on friday dismissed all outstanding charges against senate president bukola saraki related to alleged false declarations of assets
saraki one of the country s most powerful politicians has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since he became president of the upper house of parliament in though none has led to convictions
the original charges related to allegations that saraki had falsely declared his assets when he was a state governor from to to which he had pleaded not guilty
a code of conduct tribunal cleared him of the charges in june saying the case lacked substance
the supreme court upheld his appeal on friday against a decision in december last year that he should still face three charges
i am happy that i have been vindicated
the supreme court has affirmed that there is no evidence of false declaration of assets saraki said in a statement
saraki ran unopposed for the post of senate president mainly with the support of the opposition even though he is a member of the ruling all progressives congress
he was not the apc s preferred candidate which led to strains in his relationship with president muhammadu buhari
this is a politically motivated case saraki said in his statement which did not name buhari
the case was trumped up in the first instance because of my emergence as the president of the senate against the wishes of certain a presidency spokesman declined to comment
saraki s battles with the presidency are not the only fractures to have emerged in the apc before elections early next year
on thursday a faction of the apc split declaring that it no longer supported the buhari s government and threatening his hopes of securing a second term
