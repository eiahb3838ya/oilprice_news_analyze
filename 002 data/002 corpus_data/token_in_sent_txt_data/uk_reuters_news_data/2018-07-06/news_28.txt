go ship, go! china roots for last u.s. soybean cargo to land before tariffs kick in
beijing reuters it is not often that the niche world of commodities trading enters the public conversation but on friday china s social media was rooting for a ship carrying soybeans from the united states to beat the deadline before chinese tariffs kicked in
tracking the journey of the vessel peak pegasus as it motored toward the northern chinese port of dalian was the trending topic on the country s weibo on friday beating out the world cup showbiz gossip and beijing s escalating trade war with washington
reuters was the first to report on the final stages of the vessel s voyage to china as the countdown began for the united states and china to impose their duties on billion worth of each other s goods
weibo users offered encouragement and support to the cargo which left seattle on june as it became uncertain whether the ship would dock and unload its cargo before noon on friday when the new tariffs took effect
good luck bro said one weibo user
you are no ordinary soybean said another
soybeans are the top agricultural export to china with the trade worth billion in
last week the peak pegasus had been scheduled to land with just hours to spare according to thomson reuters eikon shipping data
its arrival was pushed back in recent days to gmt on friday
alas the peak pegasus fell short
at it was at anchor near dalian missing the noon deadline
the comments showed how aspects of beijing s rift with washington have seeped into the public consciousness
they also offered a rare moment of humor in an increasingly acrimonious row between the world s top two economies
chinese state media have slammed the protectionist policies of president donald trump and on friday likened his administration to a gang of hoodlums but the trade conflict has gained little traction on china s tightly controlled social media
still one weibo user with tongue firmly in cheek worried that the soybeans might get seasick while another offered the beans some wry advice on how to avoid getting snarled up in the deepening row
poor little soybeans
try to become a bean sprout maybe it s not on the tariff list the user said
one post offered to take the beans on a romantic break to turkey
it is not the first time the peak pegasus has had a starring role in beijing s trade showdown with washington
in april the ship detoured to south korea from southern china after the country imposed hefty margin deposits on imports of sorghum a grain used to make liquor and animal feed
