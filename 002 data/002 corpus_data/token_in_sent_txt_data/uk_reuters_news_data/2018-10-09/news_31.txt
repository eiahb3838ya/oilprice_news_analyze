qatari-bought fuel enters gaza amid fears of flare-up with israel
power plant delivery bypasses palestinian leader abbas qatar says wants to prevent escalation of violence by saleh salem gaza oct reuters a truck brought fuel across israel s border into the gaza strip on tuesday in what sources said was a and drive to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in violence
the shipment was a potential slap to the administration of palestinian president mahmoud abbas which opposed the foreign relief plan
gaza is controlled by abbas s rival the islamist hamas group and the palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control
under a blockade by israel and egypt designed to isolate hamas gaza has plunged into poverty
over the last half year it has seen weekly often violent palestinian border protests and lethal by the israeli military
the truck that entered gaza brought the first delivery out of a million fuel donation by qatar meant to provide the power plant with enough fuel to operate for six months local sources said
the plant has been providing gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily
a spokesman for the palestinian prime minister rami hamdallah who is based in the west bank voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery
any international financial aid to the gaza strip should be through or with the coordination of the palestinian government he said in order to preserve palestinian unity and to stop any plans to separate gaza from the west bank
a qatari official speaking to reuters on sunday said doha planned to help with gaza s power crisis at the request of donor states in the united nations to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster
officials could not immediately be reached for comment
israel s energy minister yuval steinitz told reuters on monday that qatar was trying to help prevent a gaza
steinitz accused abbas who has restricted pa funding for gaza of seeking to make gains on two counts by encouraging a conflict in which israel will clobber hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber israel on the world stage
israel and hamas have fought three wars since
months of reconciliation talks between hamas and abbas have been held up by disputes
abbas believes that if he keeps the gaza closure tight it will make hamas accept his reconciliation plan which would give the abbas government full control or the people in gaza will launch a revolution against hamas said palestinian political analyst hani
this is making it easy for others to bypass the palestinian authority
they are trying to give them gazans a sedative sometimes through egypt and this time through palestinians launched the border protests on march to demand an easing of the gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that palestinian families fled or were driven from on israel s founding in
israeli forces have killed at least palestinians since
israel has lost a soldier to a gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in incendiary attacks
