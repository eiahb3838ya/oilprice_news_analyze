update 1-rwe may cut hambach lignite output after court delays logging
duesseldorf germany reuters german utility rwe expects to reduce lignite output at its hambach site in germany a spokeswoman for rwe said following a court ruling that will delay plans to expand the mine by clearing an ancient forest
she was confirming a report by german magazine der spiegel that said output would decline by to million tonnes a year from its current level of million tonnes
a court in the german city of muenster said on friday that rwe could not start logging in the hambach forest until a separate court had reviewed environmental claims which rwe said would push back mining until after and hit its earnings
the spokeswoman for rwe said on tuesday that the forecast for a hit of more than million euros on the operating profit of its lignite nuclear division already took the expected output reduction into account
she added that no mining jobs should be affected in the short term and that rwe was sticking with its guidance for this year
