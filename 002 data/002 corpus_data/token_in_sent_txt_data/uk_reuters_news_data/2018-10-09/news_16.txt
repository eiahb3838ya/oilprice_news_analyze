trump to lift summer ban on higher-ethanol gasoline ahead of elections
washington oct reuters president donald trump on tuesday plans to lift a ban on summer sales of blend of gasoline known as delivering a win to the farm belt ahead of november s midterm elections and angering the refining industry
the move will be coupled with restrictions a senior administration official said on monday on the biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like valero energy corp and pbf energy those rules will seek stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws
the announcement will cap a effort by the white house to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners
in the end trump is moving ahead without the support of the refining industry who wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer ban
the environmental protection agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with percent ethanol or due to smog concerns
the epa must now draft a rule ahead and potentially fend off lawsuits from the refining industry who argue the agency lacks the power
biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will lead to replacing the grade that contains percent of ethanol as the gasoline of choice for consumers a move that could boost corn demand by some billion bushels
and as ethanol is cheaper than gasoline the administration hopes to lower pump prices which currently average a gallon more than cents higher than this time a year ago according to the american automobile association

with all the trade wars tariffs and low crop prices it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the burden
so it s some good farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the united states and china trump has promised the trade war with china will eventually boost the economy
trump will celebrate the move at a rally in council bluffs iowa later on tuesday
council bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent republican dave young who is locked in a tight race in the congressional elections on
the american petroleum institute the largest oil trade association opposes lifting the ban which would hurt their market share
they say gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties and have threatened to sue arguing the epa lacks the legal authority to strike the ban
the refining industry came out against the proposal arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban
the president has promised to broker a deal to reform the rfs renewable fuel standard that works for all stakeholders
this isn t it chet thompson chief executive of the american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers said in an statement
the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices
the epa will consider forcing blenders retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly the white house official said
the agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits and may require greater public disclosure as well
biofuel credit prices were near highs last year hitting nearly each drawing the trump administration into the debate as merchant refiners said plants may be forced to close without presidential action
credit prices dropped sharply in the past year hitting a low due to epa s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations
the credits were trading at roughly cents each on tuesday morning traders said
