update 1-trump to lift ban on higher-ethanol gasoline ahead of nov. elections
new york reuters president donald trump will seek to lift a federal ban on summer sales of blends of gasoline on tuesday a senior white house official said delivering on a move long sought by anxious midwestern farmers ahead of the elections
the move will be coupled with restrictions on the biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like valero energy corp and pbf energy those rules would be aimed at retailers and oil majors accused by merchant refiners of hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws
the environmental protection agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with percent ethanol or due to smog concerns
because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline the administration hopes it will bring down retail prices which currently average a gallon more than cents higher than this time a year ago according to the american automobile association
the announcement will mark the end of a effort by the white house to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners
the rival camps cut across trump s strong base of rural voters and workers the refining industry came out against the proposal arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban
the president has promised to broker a deal to reform the rfs that works for all stakeholders
this isn t it chet thompson chief executive of the american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers said in an statement
trump plans to hold a event with ethanol producers in washington before a rally in council bluffs iowa on tuesday to highlight the change
council bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent republican dave young who is locked in a tight race
rural america needs a shot in the arm and this is it said emily skor chief executive officer of growth energy a biofuel trade association
farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the united states and china trump has promised the trade war with china will eventually boost the economy
the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices
the epa will consider forcing blenders retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly the official said
the agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits and may require greater public disclosure as well
biofuel credit prices were near highs last year hitting nearly each but have dropped sharply to their lowest since due mainly to the epa s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations
the credits were trading at roughly cents each on tuesday morning traders said
about million gallons of are sold in the annually a fraction of the roughly billion gallons in gasoline sales last year
the american petroleum institute the largest oil trade association opposes lifting the ban which would hurt their market share
they say gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties and have threatened to sue arguing the epa lacks the legal authority to strike the ban
the national association of truck stop owners or natso came out against the trade restrictions arguing they are solutions in search of a problem
the retailers can benefit from trading credits and the restriction could hurt profits
the rin market as it exists today is structurally sound it provides the necessary price discovery and risk management vehicles for parties in the production distribution and blending of renewable fuels said david fialkov head of the association
