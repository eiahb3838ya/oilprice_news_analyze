update 1-chevron eyes houston ship channel for 2nd u.s. gulf refinery
adds details from interview by ron bousso and ernest scheyder oct reuters chevron corp wants to build or buy a refinery along the gulf coast to process crude oil from its rapidly growing permian basin operations a senior executive said on tuesday
the company would like to have refining operations on the houston ship channel in the western part of the gulf to complement an existing eastern gulf refinery in mississippi that makes lubricants and other materials pierre breber chevron s head of downstream and chemicals said
something on the ship channel side could make a lot of sense for our company breber said in an interview on the sidelines of the oil money conference in london
chevron is a major oil producer in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico the largest oilfield
the company s permian production jumped percent sequentially in the second quarter to barrels of oil equivalent per day
by expanding its refining capacity to houston chevron would be able to process its permian crude closer to where it is produced
most of chevron s refineries are in california and use a heavier type of crude than the light sweet kind pumped from permian shale wells
the ingredients to invest in the gulf are very sound said breber who assumed his current role in and previously oversaw chevron s pipeline operations
rival exxon mobil corp said last year it would invest billion on gulf refining projects
the houston ship channel links the busiest petrochemical port to the gulf of mexico and is home to dozens of refineries and chemical facilities
mike wirth who became chevron s chief executive earlier this year formerly ran the company s refining arm and is widely seen by wall street as an advocate for expanding refining operations
separately berber said chevron s existing mississippi refinery has seen shipments from venezuela drop percent to barrels per day over the last two years
chevron is the only remaining major oil producer in the country
