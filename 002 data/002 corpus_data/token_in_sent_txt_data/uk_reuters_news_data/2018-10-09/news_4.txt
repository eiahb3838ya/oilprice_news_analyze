update 3-pemex finds oil in gulf of mexico to boost lagging output
recasts first sentence with potential impact on mexican oil production adds comments by energy minister pemex ceo other details by ana isabel martinez and marianna parraga mexico city oct reuters mexico s pemex said on tuesday it has discovered up to million barrels of crude oil in the gulf of mexico s shallow waters a find that is expected to help boost the country s dwindling oil production
pemex whose oil and gas output has been declining since said light and heavy crudes were found in seven reservoirs along the mulach and manik fields in the southern gulf of mexico close to existing infrastructure for production and transportation
these are the reservoirs that will feed the country s reserves said mexican energy minister pedro joaquin coldwell at a news conference with pemex executives
the discovery of proven possible and probable reserves in mulach and manik follows discoveries announced by pemex in recent years in four nearby fields
together they will require billion to billion in investment including drilling rigs pipelines and at least one production platform
even amid budgetary constraints pemex in recent years has increased exploration efforts with a percent success rate in confirming reserves below rates registered in previous decades according to the firm s exploration chief jose antonio escalera
rising crude prices and an expanding budget now allow the company to do more to reverse the country s falling proven reserves which last year declined percent to billion barrels of oil equivalent
pemex expects new production from the xikin esah kinbe koban mulach and manik offshore fields to add up to barrels per day bpd of crude and million cubic feet per day mmcfd of natural gas by the second half of
the first field to add barrels would be xikin discovered three years ago where early production is expected in
the esah field would follow in the first quarter of
mexico expects the downward trend in its oil reserves to turn positive in two years following a constitutional energy overhaul enacted in said joaquin coldwell
the new fields will also contribute relatively quickly to pemex output in shallow waters where the vast majority of its production originates
pemex has recently been facing production problems at one of its main areas the xanab light crude field
we still don t have a specific production goal for this year
there s an emergency plan to ease xanab s output declination pemex s ceo carlos trevino medina said at the news conference
