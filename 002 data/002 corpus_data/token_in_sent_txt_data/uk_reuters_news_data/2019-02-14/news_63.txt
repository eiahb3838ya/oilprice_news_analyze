column-china's coal imports surge, but prices tell a better story: russell
launceston australia reuters china s coal imports soared in january more than tripling from the prior month to million tonnes but there are compelling reasons to treat this outcome with caution including weakness in benchmark australian coal prices
january s coal imports were the highest in five years rising percent from the weak million tonnes reported for december
it s a characteristic of commodity markets that there isn t always a straight line between supply and demand and prices and the resurgent buying by the world s top importer of the polluting fuel is a case in point
it s always worth being cautious about commodity imports around the lunar new year festival as the holiday in china tends to distort the data in the first two months of the year
this year the new year fell in early february meaning there was likely some pulling forward of coal import demand as traders brought in cargoes ahead of the holidays
analysis is further complicated by signals from the authorities in beijing toward the end of last year when they made it clear they wanted to keep coal imports to the same level in as they were in
while this didn t quite work it did cause a dramatic fall in imports in december which also may have resulted in some cargoes being delayed until january
given there are solid reasons to be somewhat sceptical that january s import strength represents a new uptrend for china s coal imports it s hardly surprising that thermal coal prices have been slipping in australia
the price of coal at newcastle port as assessed by argus media fell to a tonne in the week ended the lowest since may last year
the price is also down almost percent from the high of a tonne hit in july last year
but while prices for australian thermal coal have struggled in recent months the opposite is true for indonesian coal with the southeast asian nation s cargoes enjoying strong demand
indonesian coal with an energy value of kilocalories per kg as assessed by argus media rose to a tonne in the week ended
the price has climbed percent since hitting a low of a tonne in late november
this indicates a likely shift in buyer preferences from australian coal to indonesian supplies
in china indonesian coal is often used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies as the low sulphur content offsets the lower energy value
the popularity of indonesian coal in china can be seen in the and port data compiled by refinitiv
in january china imported million tonnes of indonesian coal the highest monthly total since refinitiv started monitoring in january
this was almost double the million tonnes recorded in december and also well above million tonnes in november the shipping data showed
australia also boosted its shipments to china in january with imports rising to million tonnes from december s million
however the january total was more or less in line with november s million tonnes and only slightly above the average of million per month
what the shipping data shows is perhaps an emerging trend for the world s two biggest exporters of coal with indonesia seemingly gaining the upper hand over australia at least as far as china is concerned
