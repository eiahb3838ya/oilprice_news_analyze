rpt-explainer-how can south africa's state power firm turn the lights back on?
repeats story no change to text by alexander winning johannesburg feb reuters struggling power firm eskom subjected south africa to the worst power cuts in several years this week after a decade of missteps when electricity sales stagnated and costs soared
the outages expose the risks to africa s most industrialised economy from eskom s virtual monopoly and the failure of successive governments to take on labour unions and leftists in the ruling african national congress anc who oppose change
president cyril ramaphosa appointed a new board at eskom in and plans to split the utility which expects to lose about billion rand billion this year and next
it doesn t even earn enough to service its mountain of debt
analysts say bolder steps not just a break up are needed to rescue a firm that supplies percent of the nation s power
but south african officials have ruled out selling eskom and more borrowing will only bury the company deeper in debt which leaves it up to the government to step in with a bailout
below are the challenges eskom faces and possible solutions
eskom s power station performance has deteriorated steeply in part because of delays to critical maintenance work
this week around a third of eskom s megawatt mw installed capacity was out of service because of problems diesel shortages and planned maintenance
eskom has a plan to improve performance such as overhauling units that have been shut down for long periods and fixing design flaws at two major power projects medupi and kusile
the aim is to lift the energy availability factor or the level at which capacity can be used to percent by late from below percent now
but neglect means there are no quick fixes
it will take years to sort out the problems that have built up said chris yelland a energy analyst
more than percent of eskom s power is produced from coal dug from south african mines
but spending on primary energy mostly coal has more than quadrupled in the past decade reaching billion rand in the year to march
it has also faced supply shortages
eskom s coal procurement needs to be sorted out with people brought in who understand mines and the quality of coal
is still a big problem said xavier prevost a senior analyst at xmp consulting
eskom s new management acknowledges its finances have been hurt by fraud and corruption and says it has investigated hundreds of instances of alleged wrongdoing
eskom s supply problems were compounded by its decision to reduce investment in mines where it contributes to costs and receives a guaranteed volume and quality of coal
eskom s new management has reversed that policy pledging to invest up to billion rand in mines in the next five years
it has also signed more than coal supply contracts
eskom employs people after hiring about additional employees in the past decade
a world bank research report published in said of employees weren t needed
cutting jobs will be politically difficult for ramaphosa before this year s election when he will have to rely on unions allied to the anc if he wants to a decisive mandate
but analysts say it is a case of when not if jobs will go
eskom has trimmed its executive management from people to nine by combining roles
eskom executives have also told investors they hope to gradually reduce staff numbers by a third one investor has told reuters
eskom s debt pile which stood at billion rand at the end of september is perhaps its greatest challenge
eskom has been assigned a credit rating from s p global of deep into junk territory
the debt was largely racked up to build medupi and kusile two of the largest power stations in the world which have suffered massive cost overruns
analysts say eskom needs a bailout a tough call for the government when its sovereign credit ratings are under pressure
last year eskom chairman jabu mabuza urged the government to take on billion rand of the utility s debt
ramaphosa was initially cool on the idea but has since said the government would unveil measures to support eskom s balance sheet in a budget speech on
nedbank cib analysts estimate a bailout of billion rand would be required to cover eskom s liquidity shortfall while billion rand would put it on a more sustainable path
eskom has eroded its capital base by selling power for many years below production costs
that remains the case even though average power prices have risen about fourfold since
the world bank s report found south africa had some of the lowest electricity tariffs on the continent
eskom has applied to energy regulator nersa for tariff increases of percent in percent in and percent in
but nersa tends to grant much smaller increases than eskom demands
nersa will respond to the latest requests by
ramaphosa wants to split eskom into entities responsible for generation transmission and distribution although they would still operate under the same eskom holding company
analysts say that doesn t go far enough
separating within eskom means the incentive issues and monopoly mindset will remain and any upside from internal capital allocation being more transparent within entities may be limited said peter attard montalto head of capital markets research at intellidex
one option would be to remove the holding structure and make the public enterprises ministry the shareholder of all three making each unit function more independently
another would be to break up the generation business into several smaller companies owning a mix of old and new power stations which would compete with independent power producers to supply the cheapest electricity to the grid
eskom is responsible for distribution in some areas of south africa while municipal distributors are responsible in others
and all of them face problems collecting payments
eskom is owed more than billion rand by municipalities and customers in the sprawling soweto township on the outskirts of johannesburg a debt which continues to grow
municipalities are dragging eskom down analyst yelland said
the distribution sector needs to be rationalised into a much smaller set of efficient viable rand additional reporting by sisipho skweyiya in johannesburg geert de clercq in paris and karin strohecker in london editing by edmund blair
