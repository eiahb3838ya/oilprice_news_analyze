wrapup 3-venezuela opposition takes steps to seize oil revenue as maduro issues threat
caracas reuters venezuela s congress named new temporary boards of directors to firm pdvsa on wednesday in an effort to wrest the opec nation s oil revenue from increasingly isolated socialist president nicolas maduro
maduro lashed out at the congress leader juan guaido saying in an interview that he would face the courts sooner or later for violating the constitution after guaido invoked constitutional provisions last month to assume an interim presidency
although many western countries have recognized guaido as legitimate head of state maduro retains control of state institutions and guaido needs funds if he is to assemble an interim government
controlling pdvsa s refiner citgo petroleum venezuela s most valuable foreign asset would go some way to helping in that though seizing the reins of pdvsa itself seems improbable while maduro remains in power
we have taken a step forward with the reconstruction of pdvsa guaido said on twitter just after congress named the directors
with this decision we are not only protecting our assets we also avoid continued pdvsa s crude output has slumped to lows due to crushing debts widespread corruption and little maintenance of its infrastructure
the administration of president donald trump which backs guaido imposed sanctions on venezuela s oil sector on aimed at curbing exports to the united states and upping the pressure on maduro
trump will give a speech on venezuela at florida international university in miami on monday voicing support for guaido and also making remarks about the dangers of socialism a white house official said on wednesday
the proposed citgo board would be composed of venezuelans luisa palacios angel olmeta luis urdaneta and edgar rincon all of whom are currently living in the united states plus one american director
the nominations fuel a growing duel for control between guaido and maduro who has promised he will not allow citgo to be the mechanics of how the new board would take over are unclear and there are likely to be court challenges to the board s authority people familiar with the deliberations say
citgo and pdvsa did not immediately reply to requests to comment
bulgarian security officials said on wednesday that the country had blocked transfers out of several bank accounts which have received millions of euros from pdvsa
a member of guaido s diplomatic team told reuters that they now had the capacity to use bank accounts belonging to venezuela s washington embassy though they did not plan to do so for now
guaido declared himself president three weeks ago arguing that maduro s last year was a sham
in an interview released on wednesday by lebanese television channel tv maduro said guaido was seeking to divide the country and persuade the trump administration to launch a foreign intervention
this person who believes that politics is a game and he can violate the constitution and the law sooner or later will have to answer before the courts maduro said adding he was absolutely sure of this
if the american empire dares to touch even one palm leaf in our territory this will turn into a new vietnam he said
democratic lawmakers on wednesday said congress would oppose military intervention in venezuela and challenged the credibility of trump s special envoy to deal with the crisis elliott abrams over his past embrace of american covert action in latin america
the trump administration has said it wants a peaceful resolution to the crisis but trump has repeatedly refused to rule out military action
i think there are a number of solutions a number of different options and we look at all options trump said when asked about the issue on wednesday in an appearance at the white house with colombian president ivan duque
in the meantime the united states has said it will try to channel aid to venezuela via neighboring colombia and possibly brazil
duque said maduro s refusal to let in aid amounted to a crime against humanity and called on other countries to recognize it as such
guaido told a huge rally of supporters on tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on setting the stage for a showdown with maduro
maduro has called the aid a show and denies there is an economic crisis despite a widespread lack of food and medicine and hyperinflation
