update 1-frontera energy rethinking peru due to pipeline problems
adds government response additional comments from chief executive lima feb reuters canadian oil junior frontera energy corp is reconsidering pursuing new investments in peru due to government delays in fixing a key pipeline the company s chief executive said on thursday
richard herbert added that frontera might withdraw from its main oilfield in the country if the pipeline run by petroperu remains inoperative for several more months
the old pipeline is needed to transport crude from oilfields in the peruvian amazon including frontera s block to the pacific coast
but it has been offline since late november when petroperu said it was severed by members of an indigenous community in a dispute related to local elections
frontera has lost million because of the problem and is now producing almost nothing from block herbert said
petroperu declined to comment
it has previously said that the native community of mayuriaga has blocked its workers from fixing the pipeline
community representatives could not immediately be reached
if we have to wait months and months we might reach the point where we can t tolerate more losses herbert told a news conference in lima
it s getting harder and harder for me to persuade frontera s board of directors to consider future investments in the country when we have so many problems and other countries are becoming more attractive herbert said
herbert said frontera plans to submit a bid on an oil block in ecuador next month and is looking at potential new investments in colombia
peru s deputy minister of territorial governance raul molina who has led the government s efforts to end the conflict said his team is close to a deal with local leaders to open passage for petroperu to repair the pipeline
we are absolutely committed to finding a solution molina said by phone
he added that talks have taken so long because the community has a long list of demands to discuss and the government does not want to unleash a violent conflict by breaking the blockade by force
peru is a relatively small oil player in latin america
frontera started operating peru s largest oil block in the amazonian region of loreto under a service contract in
the contract has been repeatedly extended to compensate for periods in which frontera was unable to operate due to problems with the pipeline and is now set to expire in september
frontera which also operates a small offshore oil block in peru previously said it was interested in a contract for block
