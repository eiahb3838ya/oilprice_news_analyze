update 5-eu adds saudi arabia to dirty-money blacklist, upsets uk, u.s.
strasbourg reuters the european commission added saudi arabia panama and four territories to a blacklist of nations it considers a threat because of lax controls on terrorism financing and money laundering the eu executive said on wednesday
the move is part of a crackdown on money laundering after several scandals at eu banks but it has been criticised by several eu countries including britain that are worried about their economic relations with the listed states notably saudi arabia
the united states has also disapproved
the saudi government said it regretted the decision in a statement published by the saudi press agency adding saudi arabia s commitment to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism is a strategic priority
panama said it should be removed from the list because it recently adopted stronger rules against money laundering
despite pressure to exclude riyadh from the list the commission decided to list the kingdom confirming a reuters report in january
apart from reputational damage inclusion on the list complicates financial relations with the eu
the bloc s banks will have to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from listed jurisdictions
the list now includes jurisdictions up from
the commission said it added jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their laundering and countering terrorist financing regimes
other newcomers to the list are libya botswana ghana samoa the bahamas and the four united states territories of american samoa virgin islands puerto rico and guam
the treasury said the listing process was flawed and rejected the inclusion of the four territories on the list
the other listed states are afghanistan north korea ethiopia iran iraq pakistan sri lanka syria trinidad and tobago tunisia and yemen
bosnia guyana laos uganda and vanuatu were removed
the eu member states now have one month which can be extended to two to endorse the list
they could reject it by qualified majority
eu justice commissioner vera jourova who proposed the list told a news conference that she was confident states would not block it
she said it was urgent to act because risks spread like wildfire in the banking sector
but concerns remain
britain which plans to leave the eu on march said on wednesday the list could confuse businesses because it diverges from a smaller listing compiled by its financial action task force fatf which is the global for laundering
the fatf list includes jurisdictions all on the eu blacklist but excludes saudi arabia panama and territories
the fatf will update its list next week
london has led a pushback against the eu list in past days and at meetings urged the exclusion of saudi arabia eu sources told reuters
the kingdom is a major importer of goods and weapons from the eu and several top british banks have operations in the country
royal bank of scotland is the european bank with the largest turnover in saudi arabia with around million euros million in according to public data
hsbc is europe s most successful bank in riyadh
it booked profits of million euros in in the kingdom but disclosed no turnover and has no employees there according to public data released under eu rules
the uk will continue to work with the commission to ensure that the list that comes into force provides certainty to businesses and is as effective as possible at tackling illicit finance a british treasury spokesman said
criteria used to blacklist countries include weak sanctions against money laundering and terrorism financing insufficient cooperation with the eu on the matter and lack of transparency about the beneficial owners of companies and trusts
five of the listed countries are already included on a separate eu blacklist of tax havens
they are samoa trinidad and tobago and the three territories of american samoa guam and virgin islands
critics said the list fell short of including several countries involved in scandals in europe
some of the biggest washing machines are still missing
these include russia the city of london and its offshore territories as well as azerbaijan said greens lawmaker sven giegold who sits in the european parliament special committee on financial crimes
jourova said the commission will continue monitoring other jurisdictions not yet listed
among the states that will be closely monitored are the united states and russia
