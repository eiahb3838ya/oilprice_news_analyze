wrapup 2-venezuela's maduro ramps up legal fight against guaido's challenge
reuters venezuelan president nicolas maduro s government stepped up a legal battle against efforts to oust him on thursday while the opposition said the international community had pledged more than million in humanitarian aid for the country
venezuela s opposition which argues maduro s presidency is illegitimate because he won in a sham vote is trying to wrest control of the opec nation s oil sector from him and deliver aid to a population suffering food and medicine shortages

maduro retains the backing of key allies russia and china as well as control of venezuelan state institutions including the military
venezuela s chief state prosecutor tarek saab said on thursday his office had opened an investigation into new directors at oil firm pdvsa and its refiner citgo venezuela s most valuable foreign asset
the supreme court then ruled that the proposed board members were prohibited from leaving the country
at least some of the people are believed to already be outside venezuela
saab said guaido had grotesquely made appointments in order to please foreign interests and destabilise the country
the only directors legitimately appointed to the boards of pdvsa and its subsidiaries are those who have been appointed by the executive saab said according to his office s twitter account
as head of the national assembly guaido invoked constitutional provisions last month to assume the interim presidency
the transitional government should include members of the ruling chavismo movement and military leadership in an effort to guarantee stability for new elections a top opposition lawmaker said
that interim government would have months to hold fresh presidential elections from the date maduro officially steps down as president stalin gonzalez the second vice president of the congress told reuters
we need to give space to sectors of chavismo that are not maduro because we need political stability gonzalez said in an interview
the opposition made up of a coalition of parties plans to hold primaries in order to put forward a sole candidate for the presidential elections he added
chavismo is the movement founded by former president hugo chavez who maduro succeeded following chavez death in from cancer
guaido s representative carlos vecchio spoke to an aid conference on thursday hosted at the organization of american states oas headquarters in washington to urge the international community to help get assistance into venezuela
vecchio and his aides estimated they had received pledges of more than million in humanitarian assistance from the united states and others including previous commitments as well as new ones made at the conference
we must open thousands of windows to bring humanitarian aid to venezuela vecchio told the conference which was attended by diplomats and representatives from dozens of countries
elliott abrams washington s special representative on venezuela said the united states was looking for ways to send in aid as he reiterated support for guaido
i can assure you that there will be more assistance coming in the future abrams said without giving specifics
guaido has said humanitarian aid will enter the country on setting the stage for a showdown with maduro who has said it is not needed and should not be let in
guaido s declaration was absolutely absurd as he had control of nothing venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza said on thursday
in venezuela there s only one government the government of president maduro so no one can give deadlines especially this man arreaza told reporters at the united nations
the administration of president donald trump has said it wants a peaceful resolution to the crisis but has refused to rule out military intervention
cuba accused the united states on thursday of moving special forces closer to venezuela as part of a covert plan to intervene
