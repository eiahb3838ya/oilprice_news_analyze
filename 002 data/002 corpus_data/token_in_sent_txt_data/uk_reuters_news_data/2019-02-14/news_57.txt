update 2-aramco picks banks for debut international bond - sources
dubai reuters saudi aramco has selected banks to arrange its first international debt sale which will help it finance the acquisition of a stake in saudi arabian basic industries corp sabic two sources familiar with the matter said on thursday
the state oil giant has picked a group of banks including jpmorgan morgan stanley citi hsbc and saudi arabia s national commercial bank the sources said
jpmorgan and morgan stanley have been appointed joint global coordinators and together with the other banks joint bookrunners said one of the sources
jpmorgan morgan stanley and hsbc declined to comment
aramco and the other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment
aramco the world s top oil producer plans to issue its first international bonds in the second quarter of likely worth about billion saudi energy minister khalid said last month
sources previously told reuters the oil giant could borrow as much as billion from international investors to fund the purchase of all or nearly all of the percent stake in sabic held by the public investment fund the kingdom s top sovereign wealth fund
based on the type of fees banks gained on previous bond deals issued in the gulf fees could go up to roughly million for each bookrunner should the aramco bond be in the vicinity of billion
but banks have pitched hard over the past few months for this bond mandate not so much for the fees but in the hope of being rewarded by aramco with future mandates for capital markets transactions and other banking business such as foreign exchange and investment services
jpmorgan and morgan stanley along with other banks were working on the planned stock market listing of aramco before the move was put on hold
the new planned listing date is saudi officials have said
an international bond sale by aramco will almost certainly require the company to obtain a credit rating and disclose financial information in a prospectus
aramco has so far been reluctant to disclose many details of its finances
concern about disclosure requirements was one reason that aramco shelved the plan for a public offer of its shares last year
chief executive amin nasser said last month that aramco was talking to credit rating agencies ahead of its debut on the international capital markets
aramco expects to match the ratings of exxon and shell a source familiar with the matter said but bond market investors expect aramco to have a similar if not lower rating than saudi arabia
