update 2-abide by the claw: norway's arctic snow crab ruling boosts claim to oil
oslo reuters a court delivered a painful nip to european union fishermen on thursday by tightening norway s grip on snow crab catches in the arctic a ruling that may also let oslo claw more control of oil and gas from other nations
fishermen from the european union must ask permission from oslo to catch snow crab whose meat is a delicacy for gourmets from canada to japan in arctic waters north of norway the norwegian supreme court said in a unanimous ruling
the court dismissed an appeal by a latvian fishing firm and its russian captain against fines imposed by a lower court for catching snow crab around the remote svalbard islands in with only an eu licence
latvia s foreign ministry said it would review the decision at a government meeting
norway is tightening its grip in the arctic said oeystein jensen a researcher in international law at the independent fridtjof nansen institute in oslo
the court clarifies that if you are going to fish or search for oil and gas you need permission from the norwegian authorities he told reuters
at issue was whether the snow crab was a sedentary species living on the seabed or moves around like fish and who gets to control the stocks
the court agreed with member norway that snow crabs are sedentary like corals or oysters and that as such under the law of the sea they are a resource belonging to the continental shelf of norway extending hundreds of miles kms offshore
had norway lost the case the eu could have staked a claim over the snow crab and it could have been harder for oslo to regulate access to potential oil and gas resources beneath the arctic seabed
for the norwegian coastguard this is a big relief they can arrest any ships fishing illegally in the svalbard area chief public prosecutor lars fause told reuters
the latvian firm sia north star argued that the crabs are not sedentary because they scurry around and so should be regulated under regional fisheries accords signed by parties including the european union norway and russia
it argued that it had a valid eu permit
we re very disappointed defence lawyer hallvard oestgaard told reuters
he said that his client would consider whether to try to appeal to international tribunals
and sia north star argued that norway is obliged under an international treaty to allow other nations access to the waters around svalbard
that treaty grants sovereignty to norway but gives other signatories rights to engage in commercial activities on and around svalbard
russia for instance runs a coal mine on svalbard
but oslo says rights to exploit resources around svalbard extend only to a narrow band of just nautical miles offshore
the court ruled that the latvian catches were illegal under norwegian law irrespective of the svalbard treaty
