update 4-u.s.-owned utility to close two coal plants, in blow to trump
washington reuters the tennessee valley authority voted on thursday to close two aging power plants including one supplied by a company led by a major supporter of president donald trump who had urged the utility to keep it open
it is not about coal
this decision is about economics said president and chief executive bill johnson who is retiring from the tva
it s about keeping rates as low as ahead of the vote johnson had said the plants which operated only sporadically in recent years had become too expensive to operate and that closing them would save customers million
the board voted to approve the closures
the members who voted to keep them open were both appointed by trump
the bull run coal plant in tennessee will close by december and the paradise plant in kentucky will be shut by december
both are about years old
johnson told reuters in december that tva will keep cutting carbon emissions in future years after replacing much of its fleet with plants run on natural gas nuclear and renewables
paradise which entered service in was mostly supplied with coal last year by murray energy chaired by robert murray a donor to trump s presidential campaign in and a frequent attendee at events held by the administration
early in the trump presidency murray had presented the administration with a wish list of environmental regulations he wanted slashed
trump whose base is partly made up of voters in coal country has prioritized rolling back environmental regulations and opening up lands to mining and drilling
the president had urged the tva in a message on twitter on monday to consider the role of coal in the electric grid before voting
his administration s efforts to save coal plants with proposals to subsidize them have not been successful
more coal plants were shut in trump s first two years than were retired in the entire first term of former president barack obama
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment
in total more than mw of generation were shut in versus mw in according to data from reuters and the energy information administration eia
on tuesday the eia said it expected coal s contribution to the power mix to keep falling in coming years
this year it should average percent of generation down from percent in and is set to fall to percent by
by contrast natural power plants will account for percent and percent of that generation respectively in and up from percent last year
agencies moody s investors service and s p global both said the closure of the kentucky plant was a modest credit risk for murray energy at most
you can surmise that the coal produced for paradise is not a huge amount of their production said benjamin nelson senior credit officer at moody s
nevertheless the decline of the coal industry has led both agencies to incorporate the closure of plants into their credit ratings for murray energy which currently stand at by moody s and by s p
a distressed debt exchange worth billion between the company and its bondholders in june was labeled by moody s as a limited default and called tantamount to default by s p
a deal later in the summer to refinance some of the company s debt which now stands at million of bonds outstanding has helped improve the company s outlook
murray said he was extremely disappointed in the tva decision as his company has employees near the plant who face an uncertain future
