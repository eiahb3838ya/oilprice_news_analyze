pence calls on eu to withdraw from iran nuclear deal
warsaw reuters vice president mike pence accused washington s european allies on thursday of trying to break sanctions against tehran and called on them to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal
sadly some of our leading european partners have not been nearly as cooperative
in fact they have led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions pence said during a conference on the middle east organised by the united states in warsaw
pence said a scheme set up by the eu to facilitate trade with iran was an effort to break american sanctions against iran s murderous revolutionary regime
it is an step that will only strengthen iran weaken the eu and create still more distance between europe and the united states he said
the warsaw meeting was attended by more than nations but major european powers such as germany and france part to the nuclear accord refused to send their top diplomats
