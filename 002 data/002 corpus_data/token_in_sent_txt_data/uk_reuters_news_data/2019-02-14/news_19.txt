brazil mills likely to delay cane harvest due to weather, ethanol stocks
sao paulo reuters mills in brazil s are likely to start harvesting the new sugar cane crop later than usual to allow cane fields to take advantage of late rains while holding excess ethanol stocks after last year analysts and millers said
brazil s cane crop in the main region officially starts in april but mills normally enter fields in march particularly to profit from better ethanol prices at the end of the period
ethanol stocks in the region are still at a high however because of the mills strategy last year to favor the biofuel over sugar
ethanol prices did not rise in the period as they historically do further reducing the incentive for early harvesting
brazil s sao martinho one of the largest companies in the sector said around percent of its annual ethanol output remains to be sold in the last quarter of the crop year which runs from january to march
our expectation was for higher ethanol prices in december january and february which didn t happen said felipe vicchiato the company s chief financial officer
brazil is the world s largest producer and exporter of sugar and the largest producer of ethanol though it is second overall after the united states which makes its ethanol from corn
matheus costa sugar ethanol analyst at broker and consultancy intl fcstone also said brazil s ethanol stocks remain high
if mills face difficulties to reduce those stocks they could opt to produce more sugar than ethanol in the beginning of the new crop or they could choose to delay the start of harvesting he said
some companies such as louis biosev want to give cane fields time to benefit from recent rains especially since precipitation was below average in december and january
we are having good rains now and there is more expected for the rest of the month
our plan is to not start crushing in march only in april biosev s chief executive juan jos√© blanchard told reuters
if rains continue into march overall volumes for the new cane crop could improve even if mills delay processing
some analysts think the sugar market is already reacting to a possible delay in the new crop
the spread in new york appreciated almost in the last two weeks
what causes such a movement is the perception of a delay in the availability of sugar in the beginning of the crop said arnaldo correa a sugar and ethanol expert at archer consulting
