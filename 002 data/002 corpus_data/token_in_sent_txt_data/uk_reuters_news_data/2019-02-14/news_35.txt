as renewables soar, bp sees china hitting brakes on energy growth
london reuters global demand for renewable power will soar at an unprecedented pace over the coming decades bp said in a benchmark report on thursday while china s energy growth is seen sharply decelerating as its economic expansion slows
still china is set to remain the largest energy consumer by a long stretch into although india should overtake it in terms of demand growth beginning in the next decade the british oil and gas giant said in its energy outlook
china s energy demand rose by percent over the past years but is set to grow by only percent by as its economy shifts from industries to services and as beijing introduces stricter rules on air pollution
bp revised down its forecast of china s energy demand by percent from last year s report reflecting the pace at which china is adjusting to a more sustainable pattern of economic growth
under bp s evolving transition scenario global energy demand will increase by around one third by driven by rapidly expanding middle classes in asia
bp energy outlook energy demand bp energy outlook industries renewables are expected to be the energy source with an annual gain of percent accounting for half the growth in global energy
their share in primary energy is seen rising from percent today to around percent by
compared with the level in last year s report bp raised by percent its forecast of demand for renewable power such as solar and wind
renewables and natural gas the fossil fuel will account for percent of the growth in energy demand
renewables will penetrate the energy system quicker than any other fuel ever bp chief economist spencer dale told reporters before the release of the report
solar power will increase by a factor of by and wind by a factor of five under bp s basic scenario
while the share of oil in world energy demand rose from percent to over years in the early century renewables are set to reach the same share over years dale said
bp energy outlook renewables in a world struggling to tackle climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to bring billions of people out of poverty demand for electricity is set to account for around three quarters of the growth in energy
global carbon emissions hit a historic high of gigatons in after being flat for three years due to increased energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements the international energy agency said last year
the unprecedented growth in renewables is however not sufficient to meet targets set under the paris climate agreement to curb carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to below degrees celsius by the end of the century he added
under the evolving transition scenario carbon emissions will grow by percent by much faster than in the past
bp expects oil demand to plateau at around million barrels per day bpd by the amid growth in electric vehicles and higher engine efficiency
transportation continues to be the main driver of growth in oil consumption with its share remaining stable at around percent by
demand for transport services will almost double by but gains of nearly percent in engine efficiency for cars and trucks mean energy consumed by the sector should grow by only percent
oil used to produce plastics is the largest source of demand growth over the period increasing by million bpd to million bpd
the growth in oil supply will initially come from rapidly expanding shale production which bp expects will grow by million bpd over the next years peaking at million bpd in the late
as shale output declines production from members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec will take the lead
bp energy outlook oil consumption bp energy outlook electric vehicles bp warned that an escalation in trade disputes could significantly reduce energy demand due to slowing economic growth
a percent reduction in global gross domestic product in the period to versus bp s scenario would lead to a percent decline in energy demand it said
lower demand and slowing energy trade flows would have the biggest impact on oil and gas exporting countries such as russia and the united states bp said
