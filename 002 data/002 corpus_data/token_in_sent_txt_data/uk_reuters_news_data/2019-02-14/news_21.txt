climate crisis could speed demise of norwegian oil -central bank chief
oslo reuters global efforts to fight a crisis of climate change could spell a faster than expected end to norway s oil and gas industry the nation s central bank governor said on thursday
norges bank governor oeystein olsen also said that western europe s largest oil and gas producer will still derive significant income from hydrocarbons in coming years but declined to predict a timeline for any future decline
a shift in consumption patterns and production methods towards lower emissions will reduce demand for fossil fuels
this can influence oil and gas activities in norway he said in a speech to government and business leaders
we have always known that oil and gas activities will be phased out sooner or later
oil and gas are resources
a stricter global climate policy may mean that this will occur sooner than foreseen almost nations set a goal under the paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of this century to limit a rise in temperatures blamed for stoking more heatwaves downpours and rising sea levels
the united nations says that existing government policies are inadequate to achieve the paris goals and need to be tightened
norway s prime minister erna solberg has said norway can keep pumping for decades and still comply with the paris agreement
we are facing a climate crisis that can only be addressed by engaging in a common global effort olsen said on thursday
investors including norway s trillion sovereign fund should manage climate risk along with other factors affecting their portfolios he said
but he also emphasized that solutions to fight global warming must come from governments promoting change
in an interview at his office in central oslo olsen said the oil industry could remain important to the norwegian economy for a significant time to come
but we should also be more aware not least in light of climate change that we need to develop other legs to stand on as well he added
the oil and gas industry has been a key economic engine for norway over the past years directly or indirectly employing percent of all workers and providing half its export revenue
equinor is norway s largest oil company while smaller players such as aker bp and lundin petroleum have achieved rapid growth in recent years
if global measures are introduced to limit warming by putting a price tag on emissions and developing technology it would curb fossil fuel prices olsen said
i m careful to emphasize that the oil industry should develop based on considerations of what s profitable
i m warning against actively forcing a downsizing beyond that he added
