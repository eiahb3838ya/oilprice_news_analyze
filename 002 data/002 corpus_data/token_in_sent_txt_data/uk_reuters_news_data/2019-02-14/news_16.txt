update 3-nigeria 'delta avengers' militants vow to cripple economy if buhari re-elected
abuja reuters a militant group in nigeria s southern niger delta threatened on thursday to cripple the economy if president muhammadu buhari is on saturday
the niger delta avengers who want their area to get a greater share of the oil revenue it produces said they backed opposition candidate atiku abubakar and his promises to devolve more power to the regions
the niger delta avengers were behind a wave of violence including attacks on pipelines and other facilities that helped push nigeria into recession
the group in a statement posted on its website warned that if buhari is there would be a perpetual recession for nigeria
buhari later made a televised address promising that the government would ensuring a free fair and peaceful vote without making any reference to the avengers statement
his spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment
attacks in the niger delta in cut nigeria s crude output from a peak of million barrels per day mbpd to near mbpd the lowest level seen in africa s biggest economy in at least years
that combined with low oil prices pushed the opec member state into its first recession in a quarter of a century crude sales make up of government revenue and percent of its foreign exchange
atiku a businessman and president representing the main opposition people s democratic party has proposed to devolve more power to regions in a policy dubbed restructuring
it would enable states in the south to retain a greater share of the revenues generated from crude production
we are adopting alhaji atiku abubakar as the sole candidate to be voted for by all the people of the niger delta as a result of his political ideology which is in tandem with our agitation for equitable and fair principles of federalism the group said
the avengers said that if elected atiku should start a restructuring of nigeria within six months to forestall further attacks in the niger delta
atiku has said that restructuring will begin on the day he takes office so he will keep his word paul ibe a spokesman for the main opposition candidate said in a telephone interview
buhari s government held talks with the militants in and about their grievances over poverty and oil pollution in the delta
no substantial attacks have been carried out by any groups in the delta region since january
the country is also facing separatist movements in the southeast and islamist militants in the northeast
