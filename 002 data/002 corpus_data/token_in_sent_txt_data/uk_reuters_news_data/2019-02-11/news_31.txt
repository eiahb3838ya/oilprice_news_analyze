only a few years ago before the and shale revolution overturned the economics of oil production the united states was the world s largest oil importer by far and prohibited exports of oil by law
now shipments of crude into europe have just hit a new record
january imports were barrels per day still behind russia and iraq but above other opec producers including nigeria and libya
higher crude exports have been helped by lower supplies of iranian and venezuelan crude which washington has put under sanctions scaring buyers across the world
in the whole of supplies to europe doubled to bpd according to refinitiv eikon flows data
that represented percent of overall imports or equal to the levels of iranian oil imports to europe before the united states imposed fresh sanctions on tehran
