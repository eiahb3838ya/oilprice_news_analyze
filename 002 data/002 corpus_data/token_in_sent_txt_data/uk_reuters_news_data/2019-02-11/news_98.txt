opec, russia draft cooperation charter offers no formal body -document
reuters scared by looming legislation for the oil industry the organization for the petroleum exporting countries and its allies such as russia have decided against creating a formal body at least on paper
a draft of a document setting up a new alliance and dated january and seen by reuters carefully avoids any mention of sensitive issues such as oil prices market share and production cuts
opec and russia have been cutting production together to support prices since after clinching a deal in december in moves that have provoked criticism from president donald trump
a committee of the congress passed legislation known as the no oil producing and exporting cartels act or nopec last week
the draft says opec and russia will discuss creating a mechanism rather than an organization when they meet in april in vienna calling for the creation of an alliance of oil producing countries
it looks genuine
it s also been updated since an opec source said without giving any further details
russia s energy ministry declined to comment
the objectives of the alliance are listed as setting up an intergovernmental platform to facilitate dialogue and further strengthen the collaboration in the formulation of policies aimed at promoting oil market stability
the objectives are due to be achieved by promoting a better understanding among its members of energy market fundamentals as well as permanent dialogue among oil producing countries according to the document
russia is not an opec member and has said it does intend to join the organization on a permanent basis
opec and russia jointly produce more than percent of the world s oil
the idea of an organization of opec and countries has been mooted since joint efforts to stabilize oil prices have come to fruition
russian energy minister alexander novak said in december a joint opec and structure seemed unlikely due the additional red tape it would create as well as the risk of sanctions
the draft document also foresees ministerial meetings twice a year and regular encounters of technical experts
