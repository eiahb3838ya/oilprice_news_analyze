adds background on other projects houston feb reuters sentinel midstream on monday became the latest contender in the race to build a crude export terminal off the gulf coast announcing plans to develop a facility off freeport texas that could fully load a supertanker in one day
the company s announcement follows seven other proposed crude export terminals vying to build a facility capable of loading a very large crude carrier vlcc without relying on smaller vessels to transfer crude cargoes a process called reverse lightering that adds several days to loading times
some executives traders and analysts said they believe not every proposed terminal project will get built
sentinel s project would include an onshore terminal with million barrels of storage an offshore pipeline platform and mooring buoys that will load vlccs which carry million barrels at a rate of barrels per hour
the company said it has financial backing from dallas private equity firm cresta fund management
magellan midstream partners lp late last month said it is also considering freeport as a spot to build an offshore crude export terminal after it began talks with companies developing crude transportation assets there
magellan is also considering a site near corpus christi texas
the current slate of eight projects would have a combined export capacity of million barrels per day more than is currently produced in the united states
right now there may only be enough demand for one project in corpus and one in the houston area said perry schuldhaus vice president of business development at enbridge inc in an interview on monday
it comes down to customer enbridge on submitted permit applications with the maritime administration to build an offshore export terminal near freeport that could be in service by early with storage capacity of million barrels and export capacity of million barrels per day
