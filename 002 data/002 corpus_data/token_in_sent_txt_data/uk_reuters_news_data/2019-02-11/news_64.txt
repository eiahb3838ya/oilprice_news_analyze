update 3-mexican president calls for steps to keep power prices low
mexico city reuters mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador said on monday contracts private companies have with power utility cfe should be revised to keep electricity prices low sending shares in one firm tumbling
we are urging companies that have agreements with the federal electricity commission cfe to come together to review contracts and above all to reach an agreement that electricity prices will not increase lopez obrador said during his morning press conference
the president a leftist who took office in december pledged during the campaign to strengthen the cfe and avoid energy price hikes during his term
lopez obrador noted that the utility is already contractually obliged to pay billions of dollars to the private companies that developed seven natural gas pipelines to supply power plants even though the projects are incomplete and unable to deliver gas
those companies are mexican energy infrastructure firm ienova a unit of sempra energy transcanada corp and mexican tycoon carlos slim s carso said cfe chief manuel bartlett
over the past couple decades mexico has transitioned to natural gas to generate most of its power relying increasingly on imports via pipeline from the united states
at lopez obrador s behest bartlett cited by name several former public servants who are now energy company executives accusing them of taking part in a scheme to destroy the cfe
if the pipelines can t be built as is happening in seven large gas pipelines the companies still have to be paid even if there s no gas said lopez obrador
ienova s shares dropped as much as percent transcanada s percent and carso s percent after the comments
in a statement to the mexican stock exchange ienova said it has one pipeline that began operations in but that sabotage interrupted supplies to cfe
some companies have been unable to complete construction of pipelines because of opposition from local communities
in other cases the companies can not deliver the gas even though the pipelines have been completed because of delays in building and converting power plants
lopez obrador has been a staunch critic of energy reforms that ended the wholesale electricity monopoly held by cfe
we are looking to achieve a voluntary restructuring of agreements and commitments within the framework of the law the government is committed to not increasing electricity prices for consumers but we want private companies to help he said
