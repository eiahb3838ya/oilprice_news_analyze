pompeo trip marks u.s. re-engagement with long-overlooked central europe
us concerned over russia china engagement in europe pompeo visits hungary slovakia and poland will attend middle east conference in warsaw by lesley wroughton and gergely szakacs budapest feb reuters when secretary of state mike pompeo visits hungary slovakia and poland this week he wants to make up for a lack of engagement that opened the door to more chinese and russian influence in central europe administration officials say
on a tour that includes a conference on the middle east where washington hopes to build a coalition against iran pompeo begins on monday in budapest the hungarian capital that last saw a secretary of state in when hillary clinton visited
on tuesday he will be in bratislava slovakia for the first such visit in years
this is overdue and needed a senior administration official said speaking on condition of anonymity
our message is we have to show up or expect to lose
our efforts at diplomatic engagement are aimed at competing for positive influence and giving allies in the region an indication of support and interest in order to have alternatives to china and washington is concerned about china s growing presence in particular the expansion of huawei technologies the world s biggest telecom gear maker in hungary and poland
the united states and its western allies believe huawei s equipment could be used for espionage and see its expansion into central europe as a way to gain a foothold in the eu market
huawei denies engaging in intelligence work for any government
pompeo will also voice concerns about energy ties with moscow and urge hungary to not support the turkstream pipeline part of the kremlin s plans to bypass ukraine the main transit route for russian gas to europe
hungary gets most of its gas from russia and its main domestic source of electricity is the paks nuclear power plant where russia s rosatom is involved in a billion expansion
it is also one of the eu states that benefit most from chinese investment
foreign minister peter szijjarto said this month the united states could help hungary diversify away from russian energy by encouraging exxonmobil to proceed with plans to develop a gas field in the black sea
the administration official said there had been progress toward sealing bilateral defence accords with hungary and slovakia which is looking to buy fighter jets
daniel fried a former ambassador to poland said engagement with the region fell after eu and nato enlargement to central europe and as washington s attention moved to asia and conflict in the middle east
a lot of americans thought our work in the region was done and yet it was not so said fried now at the atlantic council in washington
there was a sense in the last administration that eastern and central europe was a finished the bulk of pompeo s poland visit will focus on a conference on the future of peace and security in the middle east
vice president mike pence will also attend the event that starts on
washington hopes to win support to increase pressure on iran to end what the it says is its malign behaviour in the middle east and to end its nuclear and missile programmes
president donald trump withdrew from a deal on limiting iran s nuclear work last year but the european union is determined to stick with it
it is unclear what delegations european capitals will send to what iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif has called a desperate circus
we think anybody who doesn t participate is going to be missing out a second administration official said
white house adviser jared kushner trump s son in law will discuss a plan for peace between the israelis and palestinians although he is not likely to give details
