update 9-militant iran taunts u.s. on revolution's 40th birthday
dubai reuters hundreds of thousands of iranians marched and some burned flags to mark the revolution s anniversary on monday as tehran showed off ballistic missiles in defiance of efforts to curb its military power
soldiers students clerics and women holding small children thronged streets across iran many with portraits of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the shi ite cleric who toppled the shah in an islamic uprising that still haunts the west
on iran s army declared its neutrality paving the way for the fall of shah mohammad reza pahlavi
state television showed crowds carrying iranian flags in cold rainy weather shouting death to israel death to america trademark chants of the revolution
the islamic republic has vowed to increase its military strength despite mounting pressure from western countries to curtail its ballistic missile programme
those capabilities were on display during the march including the qadr f a missile with a range tasnim news agency said
we have not asked and will not ask for permission to develop different types of missiles and will continue our path and our military power president hassan rouhani said in a speech at tehran s azadi freedom square
president donald trump tweeted on monday that the iranian government had let down its people
years of corruption
years of repression
years of terror
the regime in iran has produced only
the iranian people deserve a much brighter future he posted in both english and farsi
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif also responded on twitter
to accept that iranians will never return to submission
to adjust us policy to reality
to destabilise iran through blood treasure
after yrs of wrong choices time for realdonaldtrump to rethink failed us policy he wrote
iranians face mounting economic hardships many blame on the country s clerical leaders and pictures on social media showed some people also demonstrating against corruption unemployment and high prices
our presence in the anniversary of the revolution is to show our support for the islamic republic said one sign held by a protester
but it does not mean we support corruption of some officials and their betrayal of the oppressed reuters could not independently verify the pictures
last year iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical elite since a uprising over disputed elections
prices of basic foodstuffs have soared since trump withdrew washington from world powers nuclear deal with iran last year and reimposed sanctions on tehran
in january rouhani said iran was dealing with its worst economic crisis since the shah was toppled
but he remained defiant on monday as iranians recalled the end of a monarch who catered to the rich
the iranian people have and will have some economic difficulties but we will overcome the problems by helping each other he said
yadollah javani the iranian revolutionary guards deputy head for political affairs said iran would demolish cities in israel if the united states attacked
the united states does not have the courage to fire a single bullet at us despite all its defensive and military assets
but if they attack us we will raze tel aviv and haifa to the ground javani told the state news agency irna
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dismissed the threat
i am not ignoring the threats of the iranian regime but nor i am impressed by them he said
were this regime to make the terrible mistake of trying to destroy tel aviv and haifa it would not succeed but it would mean that they had celebrated their last revolution day
they would do well to take that into washington and the arab world have viewed iran with great suspicion since the islamic revolution fearing khomeini s radical ideology would inspire militants across the middle east
today the united states its arab allies and israel are trying to counter tehran s growing influence in the middle east where it has proxies in syria lebanon and yemen
iran also has vast clout in iraq where qassem soleimani head of the overseas arm of the revolutionary guards was frequently photographed guiding shi ite militias in the war against sunni islamic state militants
