the views expressed are his own by john kemp london feb reuters once upon a time storytelling is one of the most fundamental human impulses
humans have been telling stories for thousands of years as a means of entertainment but more importantly to help them make sense of the world around them and to transmit that understanding to others
narratives are a way of organising a series of actions or events to understand the process of cause and effect helping make sense of the past and anticipate the future
anthropologists who conduct research on the behaviour of diverse tribes around the world have observed a universal that people use narrative to explain how things came to be and to tell stories
visitors to any human society will observe people facing each other sitting around the television or the campfire together and vocalising and more recently tweeting stories according to economist robert shiller
it seems the human mind strives to reach enduring understanding of events by forming them into a narrative that is imbedded in social interactions narrative economics shiller
or according to the pixar rules of storytelling compiled by emma coates the ideal narrative runs once upon a time there was every day
one day because of that because of that until finally pixar tips washington post june
the narrative impulse is into our brains and is present in every creation myth history book academic research paper newspaper political rally and corporate earnings call
satisfying stories obey a few simple rules good stories start at the beginning once upon a time and move linearly through a sequence of events to a conclusion the end
cause and effect are closely and intuitively linked and should be roughly proportionate to one another big consequences should stem from big causes
each effect should have a single cause or at most a small and easily comprehended number rather than result from the complex and incomprehensible interaction among many causes
heroes and villains should be clearly identified and eventually be rewarded or punished by the chain of events according to some definition of morality
luck chance and randomness can play a part but hard work intelligence worthiness and free will are more important in determining outcomes
the problem with the campfire model linear proportionate moral and determinant is that it fails to explain many important processes which are exponential amoral and random
financial market movements business cycles oil cycles and even the rise and fall of companies corporate leaders and politicians none of them can be properly explained and predicted by the traditional narrative model
in these real examples processes are complex do not always produce virtuous winners and often do not lead to clear outcomes and predictions
descriptions of processes often fail as satisfying stories while emotionally pleasing stories often fail to explain and predict the real world properly
politicians business leaders campaigners and opinion formers often prefer simpler narratives that provide a more satisfying explanation stir an emotional response and serve as a call to action
the narratives used to frame and explain an issue can have a powerful impact on how businesses employees customers and voters respond and the choices they make sometimes unconsciously
storytelling can influence the real world as much as the other way around so narratives can be instruments of power whether they are right or wrong
but forecasters and analysts should prefer accurate descriptions of real processes for all their limits of complexity and indeterminacy
the limits of predicting outcomes from circular and complex processes with a significant random element mean forecasts should normally be expressed as scenarios with an associated probability distribution
even then many forecasts are to small changes in the starting point or assumptions about the causation process so the probability distribution itself is often highly unstable or uncertain
forecasters should always be humble about their ability to make accurate predictions especially far into the future or when many variables are changing simultaneously
often the most useful part of forecasting is the discipline of having to think in a rigorous way identifying and analysing all the potential variables in play getting a better sense of the range of uncertainty
once the key variables have been identified some risks can be eliminated transformed insured or managed while others simply have to be borne
campfire storytellers are judged by the emotional satisfaction their narratives provide forecasters and analysts should expect to be judged by a different standard
acknowledging and embracing uncertainty is not a sign of failure or lack of courage but an honest admission of the limits of forecasting and of the complex way in which processes evolve
