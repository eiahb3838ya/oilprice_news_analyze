venezuela pressures foreign partners on oil venture commitments -sources
feb reuters foreign partners of venezuela s pdvsa are facing pressure from the oil firm to publicly declare whether they will continue as minority stakeholders in orinoco belt projects following sanctions three people familiar with the matter said
the sanctions on petroleos de venezuela pdvsa imposed last month in an attempt to dislodge venezuelan president nicolas maduro barred access to financial networks and oil supplies for the pdvsa joint ventures pressuring the nation s already falling crude output and exports
pdvsa s orinoco belt joint venture partners mostly or european companies are facing difficulties getting out of the country as a result of the sanctions straining their ability to continue output and exports
pdvsa has been in talks with the companies to persuade them to commit publicly to the joint ventures the sources said in recent days
pdvsa did not reply to a request for comment
on monday venezuelan oil minister and pdvsa head manuel quevedo said on a visit to india that relations with international oil companies including chevron were continuing
france s total sa norway s equinor asa russia s rosneft and chevron hold minority stakes in joint ventures with pdvsa that produce crude and operate oil upgraders capable of converting the country s oil into exportable grades
the four crude upgraders are capable of converting up to barrels per day
the oil is exported by the joint ventures and each partner receive its share of the exports
total believes it can stay in venezuela its chief executive patrick pouyanne said on monday although the firm last week said its bank accounts were blocked and it had evacuated its foreign employees
rosneft has continued working normally at its petromonagas joint venture with pdvsa according to the sources
equinor declined to comment on operational issues referring questions to petrocedeno its joint venture with pdvsa
chevron did not immediately reply to a request for comment
pdvsa last week ordered petrocedeno to halt oil production and upgrading due to a lack of naphtha to dilute the crude according to sources from the project
the venture s upgrader was already out of service when the decision was made one of the people said
it is unclear when oil output will be halted
pdvsa is studying if the other joint ventures in the orinoco will have to halt operations with diluent supplies dwindling the people said
india s reliance and pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum are the main suppliers of naphtha to venezuela according to internal pdvsa data
those flows have declined since sanctions took effect on according to refinitiv eikon data
