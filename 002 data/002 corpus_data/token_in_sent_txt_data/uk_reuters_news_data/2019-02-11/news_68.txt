update 3-south africa's eskom carries out biggest power cuts in years
eskom cuts mw from national grid test for ramaphosa months before election rand currency eskom dollar bonds slump eskom board says to audit power system updates after eskom board statement by alexander winning johannesburg feb reuters south africa s eskom implemented the most severe power cuts in years on monday after seven generating units unexpectedly went offline underscoring the challenge president cyril ramaphosa faces to fix the struggling utility
ramaphosa is trying to reform eskom which supplies more than percent of the power in africa s most industrialised economy but is drowning in billion rand billion of debt to lift the economy before an election in may
but he has been hampered by fiscal constraints as well as a sharp deterioration in eskom s power plant performance after years of mismanagement during which critical maintenance work was delayed
the rand fell to its weakest in almost three weeks and eskom s bond suffered its steepest daily fall in more than two months as investors fretted about the economic impact of the power cuts
eskom spokesman khulu phasiwe said the company would cut megawatts from the national grid from gmt on monday likely until gmt and that the last time eskom had slashed so much power was in the financial year
public enterprises minister pravin gordhan met eskom executives and the firm s board of directors to discuss a way out of the crisis
they decided to conduct a full audit of the country s power system to identify weak points and avoid further crises the board said in a statement
four of the seven units that unexpectedly went offline were back in service by monday evening while the remaining three would be back by tuesday morning the statement added
ramaphosa who announced a plan last week to split eskom into three separate entities in an effort to make it more efficient said on twitter the power cuts had come as a shock and were most worrying
ramaphosa s plan to split eskom faces opposition from powerful labour unions and within his ruling african national congress party while some analysts have said a bolder approach was needed
ratings agency moody s said on monday an unbundling of eskom into different units for generation transmission and distribution would pave the way for greater transparency but do little to solve the firm s financial difficulties
while this is a bold step it probably won t be enough
splitting it in three doesn t fix the issue that eskom is in a very dire financial situation said trieu pham an emerging market debt strategist at dutch bank ing
eskom was also forced to cut power for a sustained period in late november and early december also due to a shortage of generating capacity because of unplanned outages
