there was no immediate confirmation or comment from state oil firm noc which operates with foreign partners the bpd field deep in libya s southern desert
lna the libyan national army based in eastern libya began an offensive in the south last month to fight militants and secure oilfields

reuters was unable to reach workers at the field for further information
hours earlier the lna s chief of staff nathouri told reuters the soldiers were negotiating access to the field
the internationally recognised government in tripoli had tried sending its own commander ali kennah to secure the field
el sharara had formally belonged to the tripoli administration which in reality had been unable to exercise control
kennah had flown on the weekend to the nearby el feel oilfield and later made it to el sharara but failed to take control of it oil workers have said
oil production in libya a member of the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries has been disrupted since conflict broke out in with protesters and armed groups often targeting oilfields and energy infrastructure
