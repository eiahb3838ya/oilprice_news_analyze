explainer-princess for pm: why populists' royal election bid shook thailand
bangkok reuters the political career of thailand s princess ubolratana rajakanya sirivadhana barnavadi lasted only three days but in that time her declaration that she would be a candidate for prime minister in a march election shook up the kingdom
for the sister of king maha vajiralongkorn to enter politics was shocking enough but what threatened to upend thailand s political dynamic was the fact that she declared her candidacy for a populist party linked to an exiled former prime minister
by monday the country s election commission had disqualified the princess from taking part in the election echoing the words of the king himself who said on friday her candidacy was inappropriate
still even though the princess won t be a candidate in the march vote her political ambitions and the populists audacious gambit in nominating her could linger in voters minds
the election is the first since a military coup and will pit allies of ousted minister thaksin shinawatra against urban and middle class opponents espousing extreme devotion to the thai monarchy
thaksin or his proxies have won every election in thailand since
with its nomination of the king s sister for prime minister the thai raksa chart party sought to flip the longstanding charge by opponents that thaksin and his allies were insufficiently loyal to the monarchy
the royal family is revered in thailand as
insulting the monarchy is against the law punished by up to years in prison
by longstanding tradition the royal family have kept themselves above politics as a symbol of thai culture
since when protesters drawn mostly from the and urban establishment began demonstrating against thaksin s rule the rallying call of forces has been to protect the monarchy
the early protesters wore yellow a colour associated with the late king bhumibol adulyadej to show their reverence for the monarchy and thai culture that they said thaksin threatened through corruption and consolidating his own personal power
the military deposed thaksin in and since then thai politics have been locked in a cycle of his allies winning elections and later being ousted from power by court rulings or coups most recently in when the army overthrew the remnants of a government that had been led by thaksin s sister yingluck
nominating princess udolratana was thai raksa chart s attempt to turn the table and invoke the appeal of the royal family as a populist princess
but the gambit was quickly shut down by her brother who ascended to the throne in after the death of their father and will be officially crowned in may
still the brief entry of royalty into politics may only deepen thailand s political divisions said anusorn unno dean of the faculty of sociology and anthropology at thammasat university
for thai raksa chart supporters this has created more sympathy to the party
these would see the party as a victim in this situation he said
as for thaksin s opponents they are likely to be galvanised by what they will see as an attempt to manipulate the monarchy said anusorn
