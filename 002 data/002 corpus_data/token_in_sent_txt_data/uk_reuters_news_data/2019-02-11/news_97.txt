the men who would lead nigeria: the presidency, power and petroleum
reuters nigeria had more than candidates for president when campaigning began for saturday s elections
but only those from the two main parties president muhammadu buhari and former vice president atiku abubakar have a real shot at leading africa s most populous nation
while a handful of the other candidates are touted as civil society alternatives their chances of winning are slim without the big parties wealth and patronage
muhammadu buhari made history in as the first person to democratically oust an incumbent president in nigeria
now as candidate for the all progressives congress apc he is seeking a second term
it is his fifth run at the presidency
a reputation as a staunch opponent of corruption was key to buhari s victory at the last election
a muslim born on in the northwestern town of daura in katsina state buhari spent his career in the army
installed as military dictator after a coup in december his approach was typified by policies that included having people whipped if they refused to queue at bus stops
he was overthrown less than two years later in another coup after the military figures who installed him became displeased with his methods
but buhari s cachet has remained strong among his supporters and helped him run successfully in against goodluck jonathan of the people s democratic party pdp
the party had been in power since nigeria returned to democracy in
buhari rode a wave of sentiment coupled with promises to revive the stuttering economy and defeat the boko haram islamist insurgency
despite a lack of corruption convictions nigeria s first recession in years and a resurgence of islamist attacks those policies are little changed for the race
he earned the nickname baba go slow during his first term when critics said he governed at a glacial pace particularly when low oil prices caused a currency crisis
the moniker first entered popular usage to describe buhari when he took six months to appoint a cabinet
some including his wife have said access to buhari is tightly controlled by close advisers known in nigeria as the cabal and that they are really directing policy
buhari was absent for five months in being treated in britain for an unspecified ailment
despite that illness he announced in early that he would seek raising concerns about whether he could serve another four years
buhari has said he has the energy to do so
to his admirers buhari is frugal moral and prizes loyalty above other qualities in his allies a foil to the alleged excesses of the pdp
to his critics he is an ailing relic with little head for policy and no concern for the rule of law
atiku abubakar is the candidate for the pdp the party that inherited power from the military in and governed for the next years
for the first eight of those years atiku was vice president to nigeria s new democratic leader and former military head of state olusegun obasanjo
atiku like buhari is also a northern muslim born in adamawa state
during the later years of military rule he became a senior customs official and later a businessman with ventures in port oil and gas logistics as well as a private university
he sought the apc presidential ticket for the elections but lost to buhari and threw his support behind him funding his campaign and even lending him a private jet
atiku switched sides again in and last year emerged as the pdp s candidate
he has promised to make nigeria work again lifting it out of the economic doldrums with policies that he says will create jobs
he has for years been dogged by corruption accusations which he denies
critics say atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most nigerians
his supporters hoped to have put an end to some of those allegations when atiku travelled to the united states last month after years of rumours that he could not because of investigations revealing his ties to corruption there
but atiku had been barred from entering the united states and washington only granted him a temporary reprieve from the ban reuters reported last week
to his supporters atiku is an accomplished businessman with the economic credentials needed to boost growth create jobs and attract foreign investors back to nigeria as it struggles to recover from the first recession in a generation
his opponents say he is a kleptocrat who lacks a moral compass and consistent ideology
