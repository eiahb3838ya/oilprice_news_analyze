exclusive-e. libyan force wants to take el sharara oilfield by talks
marj libya reuters east libyan military forces are in talks with protesting state guards to take over the nation s largest oilfield el sharara peacefully and pass it to the state oil firm a commander said on monday
the comments by nathouri chief of staff of the libyan national army lna commanded by khalifa haftar may soothe fears of a battle for the field
libya has been in turmoil since the toppling of muammar gaddafi in with rival administrations and armed groups controlling different territories
the lna began an offensive in the south last month to fight islamist militants chadian opposition forces and smugglers as well as to secure oil installations
it reached a remote pumping station but has not moved on the main el sharara field which a rival force of state guards seized in december demanding money
production stopped then
we are now in talks with the guards
in the end libyans mustn t fight each other nathouri who is haftar s no
told reuters at his office in the city of marj in the green mountains a drive from main eastern city of benghazi
he did not give details of financial negotiations with the state guards holding el sharara though he said their demands on salary payments and uniforms were rightful and would be met
reuters was unable to immediately confirm the negotiations with the group at el sharara
tensions there and at the nearby bpd el feel field have risen in past days after the lna banned flights without its permission
nathouri said his forces would hand el sharara over to the national oil company noc once it had control as it did with oil ports in the centre of libya last year after expelling an armed group holding them
players in east libya have tried to bypass tripoli where an government sits and export oil direct but the united nations has prohibited that deterring potential buyers
to keep oil flowing libya s only source of income apart from gas exports the east has accepted to route oil exports through established channels via noc tripoli
on saturday the lna carried out four air strikes near the el feel oilfield run by noc after a plane landed there a field engineer said
it intercepted the plane after takeoff the next day to search it
the tripoli government which opposes a rival benghazi administration backing the lna said the planes were evacuating wounded from a previous battle as well as oil workers
but nathouri said in reality the plane had transported a commander from the capital ali kennah to lead forces in the south
kennah however was no threat as he had been unable to muster a force he said
the lna had no intentions to move on el feel as the field was operating without security issues nathouri said
we don t move on oilfields which are working normally and are under control by noc
we only move on sites under threat of external forces he said
libya used to pump up to million bpd under gaddafi s rule but that plunged to as low as in due to strife and blockades at fields
now with el sharara paralysed noc produces around million bpd industry sources say
