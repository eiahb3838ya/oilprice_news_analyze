eu targets palm oil for road fuel phase-out, but with exemptions
brussels reuters the european commission has concluded that palm oil cultivation results in deforestation and its use in transport fuel should be phased out but environmentalists criticized it on monday for allowing a number of exceptions
the commission published its proposed criteria for determining what crops caused harm at the weekend following a law passed by the european union last year to end the use of feedstocks in biofuels that damage the environment
under the new eu law the use of more harmful biofuels will be capped at levels until and reduced to zero by
the law has caused an uproar in palm oil producing countries
indonesia has threatened to challenge it at the world trade organization while malaysia is looking into restricting imports of french products over french plans to remove palm oil from biofuel in
the commission proposal designed to become law after four weeks of feedback said percent of the extra land used for palm oil production since had previously been forested compared with percent for rival oil crop soybeans and percent for sunflowers and rapeseed
however it also said producers who could show they had intensified yields may be exempt
it could then be argued that their crops cover demand for biofuel and for food and feeds without needing expansion onto land such as forests
such crops would be considered as less harmful if they for example are small holdings or entail cultivation of food or feed on unused land
bas eickhout a greens eu lawmaker who has been active on the file said the exemptions were excessive and would allow large producers to wreak destruction
the battle is not over we still have time to close these loopholes and clamp down on destructive palm oil entering the eu he said
campaign group transport environment said loopholes meant that europe could keep using the same amount of palm oil in diesel that it does today
an exemption for made no sense it said as there was no link between size of plantation and deforestation risk and because farmers of small lots typically sold to mills controlled by large corporations
it also said it deplored the commissions exemption for soy
