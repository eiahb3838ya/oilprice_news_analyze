saudi arabia aims to keep crude in $70 to $80 band - sources
reuters saudi arabia wants oil to stay between and a barrel for now as the world s biggest crude exporter strikes a balance between maximising revenue and keeping a lid on prices until congressional elections opec and industry sources said
after announcing the flotation of saudi aramco in the kingdom began pushing for higher crude prices partly to help maximise the valuation of the state oil company ahead of an initial public offering ipo originally scheduled for
that changed in april when president donald trump put public pressure on riyadh to keep crude prices in check wanting to stop fuel costs rising ahead of the midterm elections in november
now even though the ipo has been shelved saudi arabia still wants to keep oil prices as high as possible without offending washington the sources said
saudi needs cash to finance a series of economic development projects
opec and saudi arabia do not have an official price target and are unlikely to adopt one formally
the saudis need oil at about and they don t want prices to go below
they want to manage the market like this one of the sources told reuters
they need cash
they have plans and reforms and now the ipo is delayed
but they don t want anyone else talking about oil prices now
it s all because of trump the source said
an informal target of to raises the prospect of saudi arabia making regular tweaks to its output to influence the cost of crude as the market responds to other factors affecting global supply and demand
one industry source said it may have done precisely that last week
with brent heading towards a barrel saudi arabia told the market about an increase in its production last month sooner than it would have usually released such information the source who follows saudi output policy said
the saudis will probably put a few more dampening signals out given where prices have gone the industry source said
opec the aspiration for to is similar to that of other producers within the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
algeria for example says it sees as fair
everybody has been talking about these kinds of numbers said an opec delegate from outside the gulf
brent crude has fluctuated between and since april
after hitting on the oil price has climbed steadily to touch on tuesday
earlier this year riyadh hoped to see oil prices above and was ready to continue with a supply cut pact until the end of only to make a after trump called on opec in april to boost supplies
riyadh has long been a close washington ally
but ever since trump became president in saudi arabia has become even more sensitive to requests and both countries have coordinated policy more closely than under trump s predecessor
in june for example opec agreed with russia and other allies last month to raise output from july with saudi arabia pledging a measurable supply boost
saudi industry sources briefed the market about record oil production in which aramco was planning to pump million barrels per day bpd in june and as much as million bpd in july the highest in its history
in the end saudi arabia s production in june was million bpd and in july it fell to million
the plan to boost output to record highs had been driven mainly by worries of a sudden supply shock after officials said washington aimed to reduce iran s oil revenue to zero the sources said
but since then washington has said it would consider waivers on iranian sanctions and worries about a trade war between washington and beijing have threatened to hit future demand for oil the sources said
one industry source said the kingdom s crude production plans were made according to its customers needs and that oil demand has not materialised as forecast
we can raise production as high as mln bpd or even but then where will it go
we can t push oil to the market that industry source said
in an august report the oxford institute for energy studies said saudi arabia was trying to manage the brent price within a very narrow range of to and it was not an easy task
it said the strategy was mainly to put a ceiling on crude amid concerns about the impact of high prices on demand as the trade war between washington and beijing escalates and to keep a floor under prices to maintain revenues and market stability
this echoes saudi price aspirations from a decade ago when the kingdom identified as a fair price
this held for a few years only to be dropped as prices moved much higher
striking a balance between the various objectives and doing it within a narrow price range is an extremely difficult task given the wide uncertainties and the different shocks hitting the oil market the oxford institute s note said
