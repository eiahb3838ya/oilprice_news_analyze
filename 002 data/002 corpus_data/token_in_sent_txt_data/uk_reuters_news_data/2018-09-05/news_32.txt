reuters the planned merger of poland s two largest refiners pkn orlen and grupa lotos could restrict competition in the east european country bp said in a statement on wednesday

oil and gas group bp has not filed any official complaint with polish or european union authorities but will consider its options in the future a company spokeswoman said
if this merger were to go ahead percent of the country s supply and infrastructure market would be controlled by two companies the bp statement said
we believe that a competitive market is in the best interest of polish consumers and that this merger could restrict that competition unless there is a guaranteed competitive cost of supply and infrastructure in the first half of pkn orlen owned petrol stations in poland bp had stations and lotos according to data from popihn a polish organisation that provides research into local fuel market
we are in a dialogue with the european commission
