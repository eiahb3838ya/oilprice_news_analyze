france's nuclear power goals will be known by end of october - minister
paris reuters france the world s most country will announce target dates for adjustments to the national energy mix in late october the newly appointed environment minister said on wednesday
francois de rugy assumed the ministerial role on tuesday after the departure of nicolas hulot who quit in part over what he saw as the government s slow progress in moving away from its dependence on nuclear power
de rugy gave no signal of what changes to the mix he would want to see saying only that the end of next month was the deadline for unveiling a energy production programme
a first draft of that programme was originally expected during the summer with a fuller version to be completed by
there ll be a programme for energy and we will be in a position to present that at the end of october he told france inter radio
the issue is obviously not a simple president emmanuel macron campaigned on a promise to respect an energy law introduced by the previous socialist government
that law calls on france to cut its reliance on nuclear energy to percent by from percent now the highest level in the world
macron has already pushed back the target date to something to which hulot had reluctantly agreed
de rugy who did not specify whether the plan would be a first draft or definitive would not be drawn on how targets may change further but said the government aimed to rebalance the production mix in line with the legislative commitment made in
that s to say how the law that we adopted will be applied something that was not done before now in terms of each type of energy and the transformation we want with development of renewable energy sources he said
some commentators believe de rugy will be more pliable than hulot who said france s environmental commitments including those under the global pact on climate change adopted under france s chairmanship of the negotiations were not given necessary priority under macron
de rugy sidestepped questions about the influence that power giant edf has over policy given its huge presence in nuclear energy
it has plants in france and plans to build more
edf is a big company which knows how to make itself heard he said
