update 1-conoco waiting for venezuela to pay $2 billion settlement -ceo
houston reuters oil producer conocophillips is still awaiting payment from venezuela on a billion arbitration settlement reached last month with the country s pdvsa chief executive ryan lance said on wednesday
conoco last month suspended legal attachments efforts that had cut venezuela s oil exports from several caribbean facilities following a deal that allowed the country days to make an initial million payment
i ll count the money when it shows up in the bank lance said on wednesday at a barclays energy conference in new york in response to a question on how the company plans to use the settlement
lance said he expects venezuela will honor the agreement noting the company still has another two arbitration decisions involving venezuela ahead of it
but conoco would resume its legal efforts if the payments were not forthcoming he said
the deal stems from the nationalization of conoco assets dating back over a decade in venezuela
an international court in april ruled in favor of conoco and ordered pdvsa to pay the billion
conoco began seizing pdvsa s caribbean assets earlier this year to enforce its claim
conoco s seizures in aruba bonaire curacao and eustatius had prevented pdvsa from using several terminals and export operations
under terms of the agreement venezuela must pay million by late november and the remaining billion over the next years
