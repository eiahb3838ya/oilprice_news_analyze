mexico's president-elect sets out plan for new $8 bln oil refinery
mexico city sept reuters mexico s next government plans to build what could be the country s largest oil refinery with construction set to begin as soon as next year andres manuel lopez obrador said on tuesday
the winner of july s presidential election is seeking to end mexico s massive fuel imports nearly all of which come from the united states while boosting domestic refining during the first half of his term
while his aides have provided some details on the plans lopez obrador himself has mostly spoken in general terms and had not previously provided numbers
it will be a refinery that will produce barrels per day of gasoline with an approximate cost of billion that we want to build in three years lopez obrador told a group of business leaders in the northern city of monterrey in broadcast comments
mexico s largest refinery at present is the salina cruz owned and operated by oil company pemex in the southern state of oaxaca
it was not clear if lopez obrador was referring to the planned refinery s crude processing capacity or its gasoline production
two aides did not respond to requests for comment
salina cruz like pemex s other five refineries has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems as well as pemex s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically
mexico s refining network can process up to million bpd of crude
it has been working this year at around percent
rocio nahle lopez obrador s pick to be the next energy minister told reuters in february that the next government wanted to add crude processing capacity of between and bpd
lopez obrador has previously said the new refinery will be built in dos bocas tabasco along mexico s southern gulf coast
the commitment is to produce gasoline in mexico lopez obrador said on tuesday
we want to produce gasoline because we have the raw material we have crude he added the project launch will happen in the first days of his government
he takes office in december
mexico produces about million bpd of crude more than percent of which is exported while it imports over million bpd of refined products including gasoline and diesel according to and mexican government data
in july pemex s six domestic refineries produced about bpd of gasoline
