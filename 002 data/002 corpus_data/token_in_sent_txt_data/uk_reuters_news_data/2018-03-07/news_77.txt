continental bets on 'mild hybrid' batteries in jv with china's citc
frankfurt reuters germany s continental ag has agreed to form a joint venture with china s citc ltd to produce mild hybrid batteries that add some electric power to existing petrol models without a costly redesign
the new venture in which continental holds percent with the rest owned by sichuan chengfei integration technology citc will initially produce battery systems at its headquarters in changzhou near shanghai with a view to opening a second production line in europe at a later stage
entering the battery systems business will further strengthen our position as a system provider on the mild hybrid market continental chief executive elmar degenhart said in a statement on wednesday
carmakers squeezed between carbon emissions restrictions and falling sales of diesels are looking at affordable hybrids as a quick fix
parts suppliers including valeo and delphi and carmakers such as psa group and daimler have embraced the trend
continental said it was still considering making systems based on battery cells but would for now hold out for more advances to be made in the field a spokesman said
domestic rival robert bosch the world s biggest automotive supplier last month decided against producing its own battery cells saying investments were too risky
citc through its subsidiary calb china aviation lithium battery will contribute its in producing cells and enable better access to the chinese market according to continental s statement
continental said its system offered functions previously reserved for more expensive systems such as coasting fast engine start and recuperation of braking energy
