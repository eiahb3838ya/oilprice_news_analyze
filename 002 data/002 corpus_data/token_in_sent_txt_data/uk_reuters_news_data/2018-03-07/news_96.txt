look at consumption when assigning blame for global warming, study says
edmonton canada march thomson reuters foundation w ealthy cities are responsible for a huge share of emissions when calculations include goods they consume from developing countries researchers said on tuesday challenging traditional estimates that put blame on manufacturing nations
looking at emissions based on consumption affluent cities mostly in north america and europe emit percent more greenhouse gases than they do using traditional calculations researchers said at a united climate summit
calculating emissions of greenhouse gases which are blamed for global warming traditionally looks at where goods such as cellular phones or plastic cups are produced they said
but emissions presents a fuller picture by attributing emissions to the consumers rather than the manufacturers said mark watts head of an alliance of more than global cities
the newer method of calculation puts the responsibility on richer consumers and increases the scope of things that policy makers in cities can address to reduce emissions watts said
cities account for an estimated percent of carbon emissions according to figures used at the summit
the estimate by comes amid concern that national governments are not on track to meet the pledges they made in in paris to reduce greenhouse gases and curb climate change
traditional calculations put manufacturing countries such as china and india amid the lead emitters of greenhouse gases
using calculations emissions in affluent cities were three times more than they were with traditional figuring the researchers said
using emissions is revolutionary although still on the periphery said debra roberts a on the s intergovernmental panel on climate change
but these are ideas whose time is probably almost imminent she told the thomson reuters foundation on the sidelines of the edmonton summit
the researchers used trade and household data from cities that are members of
some climate scientists and city planners from countries are gathered in the western canadian city to help chart a global roadmap for cities to battle climate change
