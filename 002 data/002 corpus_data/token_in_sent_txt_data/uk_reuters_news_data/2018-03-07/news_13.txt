cohn s resignation became public on tuesday but he and trump had been discussing his possible departure for weeks a white house official said
in the eyes of the market cohn was viewed as the adult in the room on many items said gene tannuzzo senior portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle investments in minneapolis
this should create a greater risk premium in the currency markets for countries that depend heavily on the for trade he said noting the morning declines in the mexican and canadian currencies
those two recovered early losses with the mexican peso turning higher against the dollar after the white house said the steel and aluminum tariffs could exclude both neighbors
