international nuclear fusion project seeks reversal of trump budget cuts
washington reuters an international project to build a nuclear fusion reactor in france that would start generating electricity in years will face delays if trump administration cuts are not reversed in a few months the head of the venture said on tuesday
bernard bigot of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor project or iter said the administration s budget cuts would reduce the contribution to the project and lead to construction delays
it s not a question of capability it s a question of political will bigot said in a telephone interview while he was in washington to meet with officials
the energy department did not immediately respond to a request for comment
iter launched years ago by seven partners the european union the united states china india japan russia and south korea would generate electricity from a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun
conventional reactors split atoms to generate power and create poisonous nuclear waste for which there is no permanent disposal site in the united states
the cost of the experimental project which its partners hope will reach its first fusion by is billion to billion
the united states has given about billion to iter so far and had been planning to contribute an additional million through
but with president donald trump s proposed budget cuts washington s contribution for would drop to million from million
last year the administration cut the contribution to million from a planned million
bigot said he told officials from the energy department the white house s office of science and technology policy and the state department that the project will face delays unless washington promises by june to fund the original amounts
if the united states which provides percent of iter s funding does not contribute the planned tens of millions of dollars on time contracts for assembling large parts of the project will be delayed he said
in december shaylyn hynes an energy department spokeswoman said that the administration is reviewing civilian nuclear policy including research and development which will influence its policy toward iter going forward
