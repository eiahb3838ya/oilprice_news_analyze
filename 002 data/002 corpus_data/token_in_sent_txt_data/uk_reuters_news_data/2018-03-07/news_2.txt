refile-ceraweek-at energy summit, climate pits u.s. against europe
corrects inactive stock symbol for statoil in paragraph by ron bousso march reuters the energy secretary blasted renewable fuels champions on wednesday while the head of royal dutch shell urged the energy sector to focus on world efforts to cut carbon emissions revealing a yawning gap on climate issues
speaking at the ceraweek conference by ihs markit in houston shell ceo ben van beurden outlined an ambitious plan to reduce the company s carbon footprint and expand in renewables and called on others to follow
the energy landscape is changing fast
so we must change where change is what the world needs van beurden said
he spoke after energy secretary rick perry struck a starkly different tone blasting the paris climate agreement to limit global warming
perry said it was immoral to say people should live without fossil fuels
we are passionate about renewable energy
but the world especially developing economies will continue to need fossil fuels as over a billion people on the planet live without access to electricity perry said
the united states which under former president barack obama helped negotiate the paris agreement is now the only country that has backed out of the pact which calls for a gradual shift to renewable energy by the end of the century
president donald trump decided to withdraw last year
van beurden in an unusually speech said climate was the biggest challenge facing the energy sector
there may not be total unity behind the paris agreement any longer but there is no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental perry extolled growing energy independence as a boom in onshore shale drilling led to a rapid growth in oil as well as natural gas the least polluting fossil fuel
the rise of gas at the expense of dirtier coal helped the world s biggest economy sharply reduce its carbon emissions over the last decade as gas displaced much domestic coal demand
the lesson is clear that we don t have to choose between growing our economy and caring for our environment by embracing innovation over regulation we can benefit from both perry said
shell and other european peers including bp france s total and norway s statoil are becoming increasingly active in the energy sector and are vocal supporters of the paris agreement
until recently climate has been less prominent in strategy presentations from rivals exxon mobil and chevron
executives at the houston conference repeatedly noted the ongoing increase in demand for fossil fuels and downplayed the overall viability of renewable energy
other executives spoke of moving to carbon capture technologies and carbon taxes
robert dudley president of bp said tuesday that at some point in the future a price on carbon has to be part of this the projected growth of oil demand is definitely not in line with the paris climate goals said international energy agency executive director fatih birol saying the industry must start using carbon capture technologies
few were as emphatic as van beurden who outlined how shell is moving to meet its targets to halve carbon emissions by
steps include limiting emissions from operations and boosting natural gas production to reach percent of company oil and gas output
over time this net carbon footprint ambition will transform our company s product mix van beurden said
shell the world s top trader of liquefied natural gas currently produces around million barrels of oil equivalent per day of which roughly half is natural gas
in new york on wednesday exxon mobil chief executive officer darren woods echoed perry s words at the company s investor day noting developing nations need solultions to generate more electricity as their standard of living increases along with the need for carbon reduction
