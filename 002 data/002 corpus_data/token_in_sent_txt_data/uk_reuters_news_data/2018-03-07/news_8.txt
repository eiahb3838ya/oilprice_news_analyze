interview-small islands look to cities for climate change ideas
edmonton canada march thomson reuters foundation s mall island nations are looking to cities for ideas to fight climate change as they are dealing with problems on a similar scale said a top minister for the caribbean nation of lucia on wednesday
islands in the caribbean sea with populations comparable to cities are increasingly seeking guidance from urban leaders rather than those at global gatherings of nations said gale rigobert lucia s minister of sustainable development in an interview
small islands especially those of coral are on the frontlines of rising sea levels that cause stronger and more frequent more storm surges wash damaging salt deposits onto cropland and are submerging some land altogether
as small island states it is easy for us to be lost in the wider discourse rigobert told the thomson reuters foundation on the sidelines of a united climate summit
some scientists and city planners from countries are gathered in the western canadian city of edmonton to help chart a global roadmap for cities to battle climate change
small island nations such as antigua barbados dominica and lucia are tending to send delegations to such climate meetings for cities finding them more useful for concrete ideas than meetings rigobert said
as momentum grows behind initiatives by cities battling climate change separately from national governments rigobert said lucia is finding solutions tailored to its size
the beauty of having a city or regional approach is that in terms of scale it allows us for a more immediate comparison she said
last year agriculture in lucia a volcanic island in the eastern caribbean was badly hit by hurricane matthew
hurricane tomas in also caused serious damage
lucia s population of people compares to that of fort lauderdale in the state of florida a city hard hit by hurricane irma last year
the resemblance gives small islands access to new strategies by cities rigobert said such as permeable pavements flood prevention measures and shifts away from fossil fuels
in terms of practical pragmatic solutions we re finding that a engagement is proving to be very tangible with more immediate results she said
if you in a country or space maybe your voice might be lost
but if you look at a local comparison or city comparisons then it allows for a great exchange of opportunities and ideas
