rpt-ceraweek-u.s. shale and opec share steak in uneasy truce at houston dinner
repeats story first published tuesday with no changes by ernest scheyder and ron bousso houston march reuters around the room at houston s the grove restaurant on monday at several tables sat a group of shale executives interspersed with energy ministers and officials representing opec members where they dined on fish and steak
they should have had a lot to discuss amid the fervor of ceraweek the most notable energy event of the year
but what could have been two of the biggest topics of conversation oil prices and opec output levels were not in the cards as such a broad conversation would run afoul of antitrust rules against
it was quite a congenial group of people
we had a really wonderful conversation said tim dove ceo of pioneer natural resources co
he noted that mohammed barkindo opec secretary general gave a speech and his main message was that they believe very strongly that demand is going to be significant moving forward in terms of just a ago such a gathering would have been difficult
the two sides were involved in a price war that left many shale firms bankrupt
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries pumped from pushing down the oil price in a campaign for market share aimed at pushing the shale industry out of business
the price war sparked an industry recession and oil prices plunged to a low of a barrel
but shale cut costs and survived and eventually the low price was too much for opec members to bear
opec cut output in effectively making way for shale
since then there has been an uneasy truce between opec and the shale industry
even as opec ministers sit down with shale executives it still grates for them that they have had to cut production and cede market share to oil firms that pump as much as they can
firms can not engage in agreements to control supply or push up prices due to laws in the united states
but shale firms are enjoying the benefits of opec members doing what they can not driving production to a record in late at more than million barrels a day
occasionally opec ministers show signs of their frustration
nigerian oil minister emmanuel ibe kachikwu told reuters on monday that some of the same companies that are working in shale are the same companies working in opec and that they should take some responsibilities in terms of stability of oil at the same industry gathering a year ago saudi arabia s oil minister said his country should not have to underwrite the investments of others
but both opec ministers and shale executives know that there is nothing really that shale firms can do
several executives in houston this week including at least one who attended monday s dinner declined to discuss the
the dinner was just generalizations and platitudes said mark papa ceo of centennial resources development inc who also attended
it s just a statement that everyone will work together to make sure the oil market is and everyone is happy to be working together he said
along with barkindo ministers from qatar united arab emirates and equatorial guinea were in attendance
the key thing is that information is shared about our projections it really helps everybody gabriel mbaga obiang lima equatorial guinea s petroleum minister told reuters of the discussion at the dinner which he attended
the important thing is to know how much they shale are investing and their projections because usually they have good statistics he said
what we are doing is avoiding but conocophillips ceo ryan lance speaking tuesday at the conference said we ve just decided to embrace volatility
the growth in the is coming
it ll probably consume most of the incremental demand
so opec is needed to show restraint in order to continue to balance that lance was one of at least five executives from oil companies who declined invitations to attend according to sources familiar at those companies who did not want to be named
but dove said barkindo s speech at the dinner suggests an understanding of the shared challenge in meeting global demand
it s the shale producers it s the opec producers it s the producers that are going to be needed to make sure we fill that demand as we go through the next many years dove said
from that standpoint i think shale has an important role to play and i think that was acknowledged last reporting by ernest schedyer and ron bousso writing by david gaffen editing by lisa shumaker
