update 1-hungary pm announces pre-election handouts to pensioners, families
budapest reuters hungarian prime minister viktor orban announced handouts to millions of families and pensioners on wednesday after his fidesz party suffered a surprise defeat ahead of an april national poll
fidesz is well ahead of rivals in opinion polls for the national election but was caught off guard by the victory of an independent over its candidate in a on
seeking a third consecutive term fidesz is campaigning with a fiercely message and promises of more state spending including on wages and pensions
in a video clip posted on his facebook page orban said the country s around million pensioners would receive a voucher for food purchases and that every hungarian family would get a refund of forints on its heating bill
in the past weeks we have suffered from extreme cold weather in hungary the gas consumption of families has increased and so did the gas bill
therefore we decided on a winter reduction of gas bills orban said
it was not immediately clear whether the refund would be financed from the state budget or by gas firms
most gas distribution companies are owned by the state after orban s government took over much of the energy sector from foreign firms over the past eight years
hungary s national weather institute has said this winter has been milder than usual and that january was the sixth warmest since
the economy ministry was not immediately available to comment on the cost of the new measures
reuters calculations showed the two measures could cost a total of over billion forints million pounds but peter virovacz an analyst at ing bank said this posed no risk to the budget deficit target
this can be covered from the reserves he said
we can regard this as a gesture ahead of hungarian governments of various hues have often offered generous welfare handouts to voters ahead of elections since the fall of communism in
orban said last week that opposition parties would unite to try to oust his party in the national election and would turn hungary into a haven for immigrants
