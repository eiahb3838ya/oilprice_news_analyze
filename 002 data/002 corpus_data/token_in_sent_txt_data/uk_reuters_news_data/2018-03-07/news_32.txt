global markets-stocks slip on trade war talk, but off lows; oil falls
updates prices changes comments dateline from previous london data drags crude prices lower stocks off their lows europe edges up steel stocks rally on wall street by rodrigo campos new york march reuters a key gauge of world stock markets slipped on wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the white house fanning fears that president donald trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a global trade war
but the dollar recovered most of its overnight losses as some investors wagered that even with the departure of trump s chief economic adviser gary cohn the president s hard talk could still be a tactic amid ongoing trade negotiations with canada and mexico
msci s gauge of stocks across the globe shed percent while the ftseurofirst index rose percent
cohn had resigned on tuesday but he and the president had been discussing his possible departure for weeks a white house official said
in the eyes of the market cohn was viewed as the adult in the room on many items said gene tannuzzo senior portfolio manager at columbia threadneedle investments in minneapolis
this should create a greater risk premium in the currency markets for countries that depend heavily on the for trade
not surprisingly the canadian dollar and mexican peso are much weaker this against the greenback the mexican peso lost percent to and the canadian dollar fell percent to per dollar
however the overall outlook for the currency is not upbeat
goldman sachs analysts said in a wednesday note that tariffs similar to those proposed by trump have usually been associated with subsequent currency weakness
we therefore see the latest news as an additional reason to remain cautious on the outlook for the broad dollar according to goldman s note
the dollar index tracking it against a basket of major currencies rose percent with the euro down percent to
the japanese yen strengthened percent versus the greenback at per dollar while sterling was last trading at up percent on the day
steel sector stocks rose sharply on wall street but not enough to keep the major indexes afloat on lingering concern that a protracted trade war would weaken the and global economies
the losses however were smaller than what futures had indicated overnight in an initial reaction to cohn s exit
i suspect that it s still a fluid situation said jason ware chief investment officer at albion financial in utah
he said with trump keeping a close eye on stock indexes the selling that is preceded by tariff and trade war talks could change the president s mind
indeed here is a president who judges his success by using the stock market as an important barometer for that
so if the market votes an overwhelming vote of no confidence on these tariffs is there a chance that things change next week
could the dow jones industrial average fell points or percent to the s p lost points or percent to and the nasdaq composite dropped points or percent to
equities got a bid after white house trade adviser peter navarro who favors strong tariffs said in a bloomberg interview he was not a candidate to replace cohn
the market s gone up on that said joe saluzzi of trading at themis trading in chatham new jersey
the market sees him navarro as a very protectionist type
if he s not in the running the market seems to like european car makers were up percent after earlier dropping more than percent on the risk of a hike in import tariffs to the united states
