explainer-how australia-east timor treaty unlocks $65 bln gas fields
reuters east timor and australia this week signed a treaty at the united nations setting their maritime boundary for the first time and striking a deal on sharing an estimated billion billion pounds in potential revenues from the greater sunrise gas fields in the timor sea
for impoverished east timor with a population of just million development of the fields is crucial its main source of revenue since the bayu undan gas field is set to run out of gas by
the treaty signing in new york on tuesday marked the first conciliation under the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos a process un ant√≥nio guterres said could offer other countries a path towards resolving contentious maritime boundary disputes
at current market prices the greater sunrise reserves would be worth more than times east timor s annual gross domestic product gdp of billion
development of the reserves has been held back by the maritime border dispute between australia and east timor a former portuguese colony that gained independence from indonesia in
the treaty is an important step that opens the way for developing a rich shared resource the greater sunrise gas fields
we know this resource is crucial to timor leste s development said australian foreign minister julie bishop who signed the treaty in new york on tuesday with east timor s deputy minister of the prime minister for the delimitation of borders hermenegildo augusto cabral pereira
however the greater sunrise joint venture led by australia s woodside petroleum which has been a key party in the negotiation said it was disappointed that the treaty did not contain a full development plan for the gas reserves
it is disappointing that this process has not resulted in an alignment on a development concept the sunrise joint venture said in a statement on wednesday
the sunrise partners did not specify what they felt was missing in the agreement but it is likely that dili insisted on the gas being processed in east timor for overseas sale while the joint venture would prefer to pipe the gas to australia
under the terms of the deal east timor will get percent of revenues if processing takes place in east timor and percent should the gas be piped to australia
that compares with an equal share under a agreement between dili and canberra
the sunrise and troubadour gas fields collectively known as greater sunrise lie beneath waters to metres deep making them shallow to developments
the fields were discovered in and according to woodside hold around trillion cubic feet of gas the equivalent of more than a third of current annual global lng consumption
at current market prices the lng would be worth almost billion
like most gas fields in the wider region including papua new guinea s and australia s huge liquefied natural gas lng exports facilities greater sunrise also contains significant amounts of condensate an form of crude oil
its million barrels of condensate reserves at current market prices would be worth over billion
woodside and its partners have long said they would prefer to develop the fields using a floating liquefied natural gas flng platform considered the most option as the fields are away from east timor and away from darwin in australia
however the agreement signed on tuesday lays out just two options piping the gas either to east timor or australia
dili has long pressed for the gas to be processed in east timor looking to generate thousands of jobs in construction and once developed in the lucrative oil and gas processing storage transport and petrochemical industries
australia however has existing gas infrastructure and an experienced workforce making it the industry s preferred location
the partners in greater sunrise are australia s woodside firm conocophillips royal dutch shell and japan s osaka gas
even with the new agreement development could be years away
woodside said last may it may only develop greater sunrise after
energy markets are just recovering from years of oversupply that depressed oil and gas prices and deterred development of new gas projects
asia s lng markets which greater sunrise would serve are expected to remain oversupplied into the early as production rises in australia north america papua new guinea and also qatar
it s likely the sunrise partners will bide their time before committing billions of dollars to develop such a large project
