focus-exxon ceo struggles to reverse tillerson's legacy of failed bets
houston reuters exxon mobil corp s million last month on abandoned ventures in russia once its next big frontier points to challenges facing chief executive darren woods in his second year leading the world s largest publicly traded oil producer
some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor rex tillerson now the secretary of state have resulted in billions of dollars in amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers
that leaves woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years
in the company plans capital spending of about billion up about a quarter since suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under woods

exxon shares are down percent since woods took over in january
shell is up percent and chevron is down about percent during the same period
woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in exxon s rivals as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously
analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations and some have called for woods to sell assets
graphic on exxon cash stumble exxon declined to comment
a state department spokesperson said tillerson would have no comment on exxon matters and referred questions to the company
exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in new york on wednesday
the firm took the million charge to walk away from its russia kara and black sea ventures with rosneft
five years ago exxon touted plans to spend more than billion in russia but the firm halted operations in late when the sanctioned the country over its military operations in ukraine
graphic on commodity performance in exxon also took billion in charges against tillerson s bets on natural gas in mexico and canada this year
last year it took a billion a year earlier mostly on rocky mountain properties tied to tillerson s purchase of natural gas producer xto energy and disclosed it had reduced estimates of canadian oil reserves by billion barrels
there s no question that over the past handful of years exxon has been a relative underperformer said hank smith investment officer of the haverford trust which has held exxon s shares for two decades and recently added royal dutch shell to its portfolio
it s been weak results from production have this year cost exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash a distinction that now goes to shell
now exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce
in guyana where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least billion barrels of oil exxon and partners have said they must spend more than billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late
more spending awaits exxon in qatar mozambique and papua new guinea for liquefied natural gas projects and for oil developments in brazil ghana and mauritania the company has said
exxon paid more than billion last year to double its acreage in the permian basin of texas and new mexico the largest oilfield
exxon s production there so far is relatively low compared to peers about barrels of oil equivalent per day
exxon says it plans to triple output there through
with all woods development plans it seems unlikely exxon s capital spending will decline after this year said simmons co analyst guy baber
the company did reverse some of the it took on reserves as oil prices rose
but the company s inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of was an epic fail said raymond james oil analyst pavel molchanov
some investors say it s too soon to evaluate woods tenure despite exxon s lagging returns
there are few decisions that any one person let alone woods could make in the first to months that would be able to really affect the company said mark stoeckle portfolio manager of adams natural resources fund inc which holds exxon s shares
exxon retains supporters on wall street
its shares are recommended for purchase by percent of the analysts that cover the company according to thomson reuters data
half rate the shares as a hold and five advise analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of exxon s assets
others however want more information on exxon s operations
of the world s five largest publicly traded oil producers exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors while bp plc is the best according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher redburn bp and shell for example offer more than twice as much data as exxon on each segment of operations redburn found
exxon mobil s greatest challenge for might not its valuation assets or growth but opening up to investors said redburn oil and gas analyst rob west
