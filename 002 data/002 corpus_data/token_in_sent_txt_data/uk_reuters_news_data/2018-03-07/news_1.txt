wrapup 3-ceraweek-at energy summit, climate pits u.s. against europe
houston reuters the energy secretary blasted renewable fuels champions on wednesday while the head of royal dutch shell plc urged the energy sector to focus on global efforts to cut carbon emissions reflecting a yawning gap on climate issues
speaking at the ceraweek conference in houston shell ceo ben van beurden outlined an ambitious plan to reduce the company s carbon footprint and expand in renewables and called on others to follow
the energy landscape is changing fast
so we must change where change is what the world needs van beurden said
shell and european peers including bp plc france s total sa and norway s statoil are becoming increasingly active in energy and are vocal supporters of the paris climate agreement
until recently climate has been less prominent in strategy presentations from rivals exxon mobil corp and chevron corp
the united states under former president barack obama helped negotiate the paris agreement which calls for a gradual shift to renewable energy by the end of the century
president donald trump decided to withdraw last year
van beurden gave an unusually speech calling climate the biggest challenge facing the energy sector
there may not be total unity behind the paris agreement any longer but there is no other issue with the potential to disrupt our industry on such a deep and fundamental energy secretary rick perry struck a starkly different tone blasting the agreement to limit global warming
perry said it was immoral to say people should live without fossil fuels
we are passionate about renewable energy
but the world especially developing economies will continue to need fossil fuels as over a billion people on the planet live without access to electricity perry said
perry extolled growing energy independence as a boom in onshore shale drilling led to a rapid growth in oil as well as natural gas the least polluting fossil fuel
the rise of gas at the expense of dirtier coal helped the world s biggest economy sharply reduce its carbon emissions over the last decade as gas displaced much domestic coal demand
the lesson is clear that we don t have to choose between growing our economy and caring for our environment by embracing innovation over regulation we can benefit from both perry said
perry said at a later panel that trump thought that the costs were not worth staying in the paris agreement
executives at the houston conference repeatedly noted growing demand for fossil fuels and downplayed the overall viability of renewable energy or electric vehicles noting emissions would continue to rise even if there was percent adoption of electric vehicles
on wednesday mary barra chief executive officer of general motors co said the company s commitment to an future is unwavering regardless of any modifications to future fuel economy she said congress should expand tax credits for electric vehicles
other executives spoke of moving to carbon capture technologies and carbon taxes
robert dudley president of bp said tuesday that at some point in the future a price on carbon has to be part of this the projected growth of oil demand is definitely not in line with the paris climate goals said international energy agency executive director fatih birol saying the industry must start using carbon capture sequestration ccs technologies
in new york on wednesday exxon mobil chief executive officer darren woods echoed perry s words at the company s investor day noting developing nations need solutions to generate more electricity
like others woods said exxon advocates a carbon tax to limit emissions
by and large we don t see enough incentives to grow ccs in the marketplace peter trelenberg exxon s manager of environmental policy and planning said
few in houston were as emphatic as van beurden who outlined how shell is moving to meet its targets to halve carbon emissions by
steps include limiting emissions from operations and boosting natural gas production to reach percent of company oil and gas output
over time this net carbon footprint ambition will transform our company s product mix van beurden said
