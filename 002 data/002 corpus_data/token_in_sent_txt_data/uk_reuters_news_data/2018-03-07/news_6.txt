update 4-exxon tries to sell wall street on growth plan, but shares drop
new york reuters exxon mobil corp on wednesday laid out a goal to double annual earnings by through heavier investments in a bid to allay investor fears that the world s largest publicly traded oil producer has seen its best days
but shares still fell to their lowest level in more than two years after the company said the spending would not boost production and investors who had expected large share buybacks were disappointed that executives did not announce any
exxon was once the industry s profit and leader but sagging output and a sliding share price have pushed total return or share appreciation plus dividends into negative territory over the last five years according to thomson reuters data
by comparison total returns are up percent for chevron corp and percent for royal dutch shell plc
exxon s growth plan will require billions of dollars in spending spread across shale fields along with refinery expansions and deepwater megaprojects
the company said investments should drive profit to billion in with crude prices at or above current levels
it was the first time irving exxon has given an earnings forecast so far in advance
shares closed down percent at the lowest close since january
darren woods who became chief executive in january after predecessor rex tillerson retired and became the secretary of state also said he was committed to being more transparent with investors
there s a lot different today not just style woods said at the company s annual analyst day in new york
my objective is to get this organisation focussed on driving value and turning that value into results that you all will exxon said projects in guyana and the permian basin region of texas and new mexico as well as refining and chemical plant expansions should drive earnings gains
exxon reported an adjusted profit of billion in
to achieve its goals exxon said it will boost spending on capital projects to billion this year billion next year and an average of billion from to
meanwhile peers including chevron are cutting spending or promising to hold budgets flat
capex is the price you pay for cash flow said woods who added that every dollar in capital spending by exxon in the past decade has generated in operating cash flow
woods said he expected production to grow about million barrels of oil equivalent per day to about million in as projects come online
when an analyst asked if he would resign if the targets were not met woods did not directly answer but said he intended to meet the goals
tom ellacott senior vice president at consultancy wood mackenzie noted that in the near term exxon s production will be flat and growth in the next decade will require hitting goals at five key development regions
in the permian basin the largest oilfield exxon plans to triple production by at recently purchased acreage
the expansion highlights the increasing importance of shale alongside the company s global megaprojects
several analysts viewed the higher spending as problematic even as they welcomed the pledge of greater transparency by a company that has been criticized for giving few operations details in recent years
to us this highlights that there are no easy fixes to rejuvenate exxon s portfolio and it is likely to take time for this investment to flow through into higher earnings cash flow and returns said rbc capital markets analyst biraj borkhataria
exxon s operating margin which measures profit after expenses dipped to percent last year far below the industry median of percent according to thomson reuters data
several analysts pushed woods for still more transparency asking him directly to participate in quarterly earnings conference calls
unlike ceos of most public companies including oil majors exxon ceos historically have not joined the calls where analysts can ask for operations details and outlooks
please disclose more and meet us more
we would be greatly appreciative wolfe research analyst paul sankey said to woods at the meeting
woods did not commit to being on the calls but said he has been meeting more with investors in the past year
chevron on tuesday said it should be able to raise production percent to percent this year and buy back shares for the first time in at least three years even without a substantial rise in oil prices
