analysis -europe struggles to stem biodiesel import flood
paris reuters rising biodiesel imports from argentina and an expected surge in shipments from indonesia threaten to cripple output in the european union the world s top producer of the renewable fuel
the european union slashed import duties on argentine biodiesel last september after buenos aires mounted a successful challenge at the world trade organisation weeks after the united states imposed steep duties on the fuel
the bloc is now considering whether to cut duties on indonesian biodiesel
argentine fuel is now entering the eu at much lower prices than rapeseed oil the main material used by european producers who say they can not compete and in some cases are being pushed to the verge of bankruptcy
between august last year and january tonnes of biodiesel around four times the capacity of a large eu plant worth million were exported from argentina to the bloc customs data showed
earlier in nearly all exports were heading to the united states
raffaello garofalo head of the european biodiesel board ebb said the impact of argentine imports was already worse than expected
there is huge economic damage and we risk seeing many european renewable fuel producers close down in the face of these unfair import floods he said
the eu is the world s largest producer and consumer of biodiesel a fuel made mostly from vegetable oils which is renewable and aimed at reducing carbon emissions
eu production of biodiesel was million tonnes in up from million a year earlier
but consultancy strategie grains which initially said output would be stable this year has cut its estimate to million tonnes because of the argentine imports
imports of argentine biodiesel into the eu could hit million tonnes in with a similar volume from indonesia if the eu cuts its duties strategie grains said
the rise in imports comes as several producers in the european union are being pressed hard by internal competition and low margins
the eu s top producer saipol part of oilseed group avril said it would cut production by nearly half this year with around out of staff working reduced hours mainly because of imports of argentine biodiesel
there is a double impact on our sales but also on the biodiesel market where prices are weighed down by the arrival of cheap products kristell guizouarn head of france s biodiesel industry group esterifrance said
both argentina and indonesia impose a higher export duty on the raw material soybeans and palm oil respectively than on biodiesel
this allows biodiesel producers in the two countries to dump products abroad at unfairly low prices eu producers say
since september european rapeseed biodiesel prices have fallen percent but are still about percent higher than argentine soybean biodiesel delivered to the bloc
the eu was argentina s largest biodiesel market until the tariffs were implemented in
the spanish biodiesel industry could be hard hit
there would be no need to produce the fuel in spain if cheap biodiesel is available from argentina said christophe cogny analyst at strategie grains adding that spanish companies were already facing severe overcapacity
germany the eu s largest producing country warned of a massive fall in output this year due to what it called unfairly subsidized imports
immediate measures should be taken by the eu to restrain the imports in order to prevent this threat to the very existence of the german biodiesel industry elmar baumann head of the german biofuels industry association vdb said
the eu opened an investigation into argentine biodiesel at the end of january after a complaint by the ebb potentially offering a way to impose duties on imported biodiesel
argentine producers accused the eu of protectionism
we are confident that we have a very clear and strong case to defend ourselves said luis zubizarreta president of carbio argentina s biofuels industry chamber
if the investigation finds that argentina benefited from unfair subsidies provisional duties could be imposed late this year
the scope of such duties is unknown
in the meantime pressured by the industry france adopted stricter environmental rules for imported biofuels a measure intended to restrict inflows from argentina
but since most shipments enter the eu via the netherlands or spain and are then distributed internally it will be hard to track the impact of the french action
the united states imposed steep duties on argentine and indonesian biodiesel last august saying the fuel was unfairly subsidized
argentine producers said the move meant an immediate halt in exports on the markets
and last month the commerce department imposed more import duties on biodiesel from both countries making it virtually certain that biodiesel from argentina and indonesia will not be sold in the market
