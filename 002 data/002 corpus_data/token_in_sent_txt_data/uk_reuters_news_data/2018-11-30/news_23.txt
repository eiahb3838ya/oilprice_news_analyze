lopez obrador who takes office on saturday told the daily la jornada that the landmark energy overhaul passed by outgoing president enrique pena nieto had been a big scam and that he would focus on boosting state investment
they stopped investing assuming that foreign investment was going to arrive and that public investment was not going to be required
foreign investment did not come that was a big scam lopez obrador said
the energy plan designed in the neoliberal period is not going to be carried out he said and added there will be no more rounds suggesting his administration would end the process of auctioning oil fields to private companies
however he did not give details
in the past he has said that private auctions were suspended until more than oil contracts issued by the outgoing government had been reviewed for signs of corruption
lopez obrador has pledged to boost investment in oil company pemex and plans to start building a new oil refinery next year in his home state of tabasco
mexican financial markets have been rattled since lopez obrador said he would scrap a partly built new mexico city airport and members of his party proposed unexpected bills to cut bank fees and limit mining rights
earlier this month ratings agency fitch revised its outlook on mexico s debt to negative citing the uncertainty caused by the airport cancellation as well the risks from rising debt at pemex
lopez obrador told la jornada that he aimed to boost crude production to million barrels per day bpd by the end of his term in
previously he had targeted million bpd
he said he expects mexico s decline in oil output to hit bottom next year at around million bpd
