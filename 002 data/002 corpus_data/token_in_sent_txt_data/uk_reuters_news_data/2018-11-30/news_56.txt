the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london nov reuters saudi arabia s energy minister khalid must play a bad hand of cards as well as he can at next week s meeting of opec and oil producers in vienna
falih s challenge is to get other countries on board with output cuts to avert another crash in oil prices next year while disguising the kingdom s diminishing leverage in the oil market
brent futures have fallen by a third since the start of october while the calendar spread is in contango indicating most traders expect the market to be oversupplied in
the market outlook is strikingly similar to with production from shale surging while consumption growth slows as the global economy falters
but in one respect the situation is even more uncomfortable because saudi arabia s official foreign reserves are down to just over billion from almost billion in june
the kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed peg to the dollar and prevent a run on the currency
the kingdom can another slump in oil revenues so soon after the last one which suggests it will have to cut production while trying to cajole other opec and countries to share the burden
at the same time any cuts must avoid provoking a political reaction from the united states where the president has continued to press for even lower oil prices
saudi arabia faces a familiar but uncomfortable choice cut production to defend prices or allow prices to fall to protect market share
in november saudi arabia chose to maintain production and allow prices to fall which temporarily halted the shale boom but wrecked the kingdom s finances and pushed its economy into recession
in december saudi arabia opted to cut production which boosted prices and stabilised the kingdom s finances and economy but also revived the shale boom and cost it share
the strategy associated with falih s predecessor as oil minister ali is often characterised as a failure though it did manage to restrain shale production for a time
by contrast the strategy of involving coordinated output cuts with other opec and countries has been hailed as a triumph even though it reinvigorated the shale boom
but naimi warned repeatedly that the burden of opec and production cuts would fall most heavily on saudi arabia and the main beneficiaries would be shale producers and time has proved him correct
saudi arabia shouldered a disproportionate share of the cuts in just as it had done during earlier cuts in and
russia s production was broadly unchanged or increased during all three episodes
by august saudi arabia s production was up by barrels per day compared with june and russia s output had climbed by bpd
output was up by more than million bpd
in the current environment the kingdom must do everything possible to prevent another price crash which means it has little option but to cut its own production significantly
saudi arabia can not afford another slump in oil prices
it needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation programmes
now the kingdom is trying to assemble some diplomatic cover for cutbacks it will almost certainly have to make anyway
in the to next week s meetings in vienna falih has indicated saudi arabia is ready to cut output again but only in conjunction with other producers saudi arabia wants united front on oil output reuters
we are going to do whatever is necessary but only if we act together as a group of falih told reporters referring to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies
as saudi arabia we can not do it alone we will not do it alone
everybody is longing to reach a decision that brings stability back to the market
i think people know that leaving the market to its own devices with no clarity and no collective decision to balance the market is not if the past is any guide however saudi arabia will do most of the cutting russia s output will end up little changed and the main beneficiaries will be shale firms
saudi arabia s fundamental problem is structural rather than diplomatic every time the kingdom tries to raise prices by restricting its output it only encourages more increases in shale production
