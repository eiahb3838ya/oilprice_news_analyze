australian kids walk out of school to protest climate inaction
sydney reuters thousands of children walked out of school across australia on friday in protest against government inaction on climate change prompting a rebuke from a minister who said they were setting themselves up for failure
children parents and teachers gathered in sydney s central business district in the lunch hour chanting scomo s got to go referring to prime minister scott morrison
there were similar protests in melbourne brisbane perth and elsewhere after students in the national capital of canberra held a protest earlier in the week
this is just the beginning
this is our first strike our first movement altogether we will keep leading more campaigns until something is done one of the protest leaders told the screaming crowd
australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita in part because of its reliance on power plants
earlier this year the conservative government also weakened its commitment to the paris climate accord
energy policy has created deep fissures in the conservative coalition and climate change skeptics were a key force in deposing malcolm turnbull as prime minister in august
morrison has criticized the protests saying he wanted more learning and less activism in schools and resources minister matt canavan said the action was setting the children up for failure
walking off school and protesting you don t learn anything from that canavan said in a radio interview
the best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue because that s what your future life will look but teachers and parents at the protest said they believed the protests was significant for children s learning
this is as good an education as being in a classroom
i think this is a good way for kids to learn to be involved to be active and to take some action for something that affects them directly said maria a sydney mother who accompanied her nine son to the protest
