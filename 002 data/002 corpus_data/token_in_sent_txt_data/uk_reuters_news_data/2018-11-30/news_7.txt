trump allows oil surveys that conservationists say harm whales, dolphins
washington reuters the trump administration on friday gave five companies initial permission to conduct surveys of oil and gas deposits beneath a vast region off the east coast using blasts that conservationists say put whales and dolphins at risk
the fisheries office of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration issued permits to westerngeco llc a subsidiary of schlumberger ltd and cgg to harass but not kill marine mammals with air gun blasts in a region of the atlantic from delaware to cape canaveral florida
the permits that also went to ion geoventures spectrum geo inc and geophysical company are likely to increase tensions between the administration which wants to open up offshore drilling with governors from the east coast who oppose it
president donald trump has espoused an energy dominance agenda to boost oil output for consumption and for exports
conservationists worry that marine mammals including the endangered north atlantic right whale could be harmed and that the practice could lead to beachings of the species
trump is essentially giving these companies permission to harass harm and possibly even kill marine life all in the pursuit of dirty and dangerous offshore oil said diane hoskins a campaign director at the oceana environmental group
this is the first step toward offshore drilling in the noaa said impacts on marine mammal populations would be limited
we ve been assured that the effects of the authorizations do not result in jeopardy to endangered or threatened species donna wieting director of the noaa fisheries office of protected resources told reporters in a teleconference
benjamin laws a noaa fisheries biologist said the permits require protections for right whales in places they are expected to be present
the companies can not conduct surveys within about miles km from shore between and april in such areas laws said
if any right whales are spotted within just under a mile of a survey ship the tests must be shut down he added
the administration of former president barack obama denied six permits two weeks before trump became president saying that the value of information from the air gun surveys would not outweigh potential risks to marine life
if as expected the bureau of ocean energy management issues the companies further permitting they will be able to conduct air gun surveys in the atlantic for the first time since the
