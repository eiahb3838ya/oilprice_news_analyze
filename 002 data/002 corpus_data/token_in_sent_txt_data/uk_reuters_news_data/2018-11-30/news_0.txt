u.s. to conduct additional keystone xl pipeline review
reuters the state department will conduct another environmental review of transcanada corp s keystone xl oil pipeline a official said on friday a move that could lead to additional delays of the project
the supplemental environmental impact statement was ordered by judge brian morris of the district court in montana in his ruling on that blocked construction of the pipeline planned to bring heavy crude from canada s oil sands to the united states
morris said in his ruling that previous environmental analysis of keystone xl fell short of a hard look at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on native american land resources
the billion pipeline which is supported by canadian oil interests and refiners but opposed by landowners and environmentalists has been pending for a decade
president donald trump announced a permit for the project soon after he took office
former president barack obama nixed the pipeline saying it would do little to help consumers and would add greenhouse gases
transcanada spokesman terry cunha said that the state department s announcement of an additional review was expected after the judge s ruling
earlier this week transcanada asked morris the district court judge to allow it to resume some activities blocked by the initial ruling
morris decision on thursday gave the calgary company permission to resume some activity on the pipeline project including project development work and stakeholder meetings
it is not allowed to resume physical field work like moving pipe and equipment preparing work camp sites or undertaking road upgrades at this time cunha said
morris is set to rule on that work after
it is too soon to say what the injunction will mean to the timeline of the keystone xl pipeline but we remain confident the project will be built cunha said
