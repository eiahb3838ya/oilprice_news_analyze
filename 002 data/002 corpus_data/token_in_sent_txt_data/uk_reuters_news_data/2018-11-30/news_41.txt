update 2-singapore to ban 'wash water' discharge at top ship refuelling port from 2020
singapore reuters singapore s maritime port authority mpa will ban the discharge of wash water used in ships to scrub engine exhaust from the mpa said on friday
the ban of scrubbers is part of an effort to prepare one of the world s busiest ports for international maritime organization imo rules that come into force in and oblige ships to use cleaner fuels
to protect the marine environment and ensure that the port waters are clean the discharge of wash water from exhaust gas scrubbers in singapore port waters will be prohibited said andrew tan chief executive officer of the mpa during an event in singapore
ships fitted with hybrid scrubbers will be required to switch to the mode of operation tan said
singapore is the world s biggest hub for ship refueling also known as bunkering
tan said singapore would provide facilities for the collection of residue generated from the operation of scrubbers
the mpa said the ban would be enforced from
under future imo rules ships will have to reduce the sulfur content in their fuel to below percent from compared with percent now
to do so shippers can switch to burning cleaner oil shift to alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas lng or invest in exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers
the mpa s move could be a setback for shippers bunkering in singapore that have invested in scrubbers
scrubbers use seawater to capture sulfur from engine exhausts before discharging this wash water back into the ocean after treatment
in systems scrubbing is performed using water treated with additives recycling the liquid internally
hybrid scrubbers are a combination of both
the cheapest of the scrubbing options systems have been the most popular with shippers shipping sources say
some anticipate singapore s move could cost the business in the bunkering industry
singapore s bunker market could lose out to competitive bunkering locations emerging in surrounding locations provided they allow scrubbers to operate said ashok sharma managing director of shipbroker brs baxi in singapore
others are less concerned since most shippers are opting for low sulfur fuels as a means for compliance and the benefits of scrubbers are largely realized in open water and not within port limits
prudent tanker owners will have likely factored in the possibility of limits on the use of scrubbers said tim wilkins manager for intertanko an association of independent tanker owners and operators
while recent interest in scrubbers has increased the cost of installing them and uncertainty around emissions regulations has meant that a switch to fuels remains the most practical form of compliance with imo rules according to industry participants
