oil workers' discontent threatens libyan output surge
libyan oil output at highest level for five years risks loom as oil workers complain about high inflation militias and protesters have blocked ports and fields production remains below levels by ayman ulf laessing and ahmad ghaddar nov reuters libya s oil output is at a high and rare exploration deals with foreign majors are being won but worker dissent and armed groups risk a repeat of disruptions that have choked off other production surges since the civil war
staff at state oil firm noc told reuters that small protests had erupted at nine oil and gas fields and some ports in recent months mainly among workers left waiting for promised pay rises as inflation and a weak currency erode living standards
we are the anonymous soldiers whose rights have been stolen said a worker at the oil field asking not to be named as noc has banned workers from talking to the media
we should be the best paid workers in libya but we suffer from poor accommodation and medical treatment in the fields and delays in salary other staff made similar comments
the most stable period of production in the north african country since has pushed output as high as million barrels per day
state oil firm noc has restarted wells shut for years as security has improved in some areas while oil majors like bp have said they will revive exploration plans
but approaching or exceeding output of million bpd has tended to be a psychological trigger for demands from workers and militia groups that also want a share of oil earnings
in autumn blockades of oilfields and ports rapidly cut production after it had climbed to more than bpd
in may disruptions slashed output to around bpd its lowest since the war
before libya was producing around million bpd
seven years after muammar gaddafi was toppled the opec member also remains mired in conflict between rival governments and armed groups
noc said in a statement it was always looking to improve conditions for its workforce and called on the government to approve a pay rise
but years of underfunding and destruction by militias had forced it to focus on damaged infrastructure
noc is constantly having to redeploy budget to restore critical infrastructure funds that could otherwise be spent on facilities and improving working conditions noc said
libya was once one of africa s richest countries but living standards for ordinary citizens have declined as the local currency has lost value
the dinar has fallen on the parallel market by as much as percent against the dollar since
since even basic foodstuffs like milk have to be imported inflation has soared hurting oil workers whose salaries have not risen since
authorities then agreed a percent pay hike but volatile oil revenues meant it was never implemented
priced for its proximity to key european markets and crude quality libyan oil has recently been in demand as a substitute for iranian crude hit by sanctions
part of the technical work needed to keep oil and gas fields going is done by noc s foreign partners and specialist services firms an oil executive said
but noc staff need to be kept happy as they make up the bulk of the industry s workforce operate oil export ports and are often alone at remote fields where poor security makes oil majors wary of sending their own staff
oil workers protests have been small and shortlived
but in libya with its dysfunctional state pipelines have sometimes been blocked by workers or fewer industry sources said
many libyans see noc which generates billions of dollars annually as a cash cow that is potentially more responsive to their grievances than the largely absent state
armed groups have also enjoyed an oil bonanza
by forcing the weak state to hire their men they gain access to cheap central bank dollars to sell on the black market at a premium
one such group the petroleum facilities guards pfg is in charge of securing facilities
in september some pfg members halted air transport to the wafa oil field in what noc said was an attempt to extract a corrupt contract
noc workers make between dinars and dinars a month more than the average public servant
but frustration has been building up over a lack of investment in living quarters or medical units
in september oil workers at noc s eastern zueitina port demanded health insurance in a letter to management
noc said it had approved medical coverage for all staff last year and instructed subsidiaries to proceed with the policy after the audit bureau suspended health insurance in
other staff are tired of having to work in dangerous places such as the el sharara oilfield deep in the south where gunmen have kidnapped or robbed workers
the security situation on the el sharara field is very dangerous said one frightened engineer
tribesmen have threatened to close the field unless they get a share of oil revenues a recurring theme while libya is divided between rival governments relying on armed groups and tribes
libya needs a comprehensive political settlement before situations like the one we have at sharara can be resolved a libyan oil source said
noc hopes to increase production further if security improves but analysts remain sceptical
with production at a high the production risks are more on the downside considering the ongoing political instability in the country and the challenging security situation said giovanni staunovo analyst at ubs in zurich
