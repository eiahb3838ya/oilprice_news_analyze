update 4-french farmers block refineries, fuel depots over palm oil imports
paris reuters french farmers have blocked access to oil depots and refineries with tonnes of onions wood and rubble as part of a protest over plans to allow total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant

the mostly symbolic blockade at la mede was lifted around midday with farmers returning to work according to a reuters photographer on site
organisers say the farmers blockades are aimed at pressuring the government into curbing palm oil use at la mede and to address other grievances such as imports of south american meat
our target is the state fnsea s lambert said adding total s decision on palm oil was the last straw
widespread fuel shortages were not expected however given france s network of seven refineries fuel depots emergency fuel reserves and the absence of sympathy action by fuel sector workers
palm oil is cheaper than rapeseed oil as a feedstock for biodiesel
french farmers say its growing use has added to their competitive disadvantage because of high taxes and strict environmental regulations in france
total argues its plans call for using less palm oil than allowed by the authorities offer an outlet for local rapeseed and will develop recycling of used oil and fat
palm oil has been criticised in europe for environmental destruction and some lawmakers are pushing for a ban on its use in biofuel as part of new european union energy targets
