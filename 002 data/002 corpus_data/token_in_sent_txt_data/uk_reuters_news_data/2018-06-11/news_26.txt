update 2-audi ceo named as suspect in german emissions probe
frankfurt reuters german prosecutors on monday widened an emissions cheating probe into volkswagen s luxury carmaker audi to include the brand s chief executive rupert stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising
almost three years after volkswagen admitted to falsifying diesel emissions tests the munich public prosecutor s office said it was now probing suspects and had on monday searched the apartment of stadler and one other board member
the news came after germany s bild am sonntag reported up to a million daimler cars had been found to contain illegal emissions devices showing how the fallout from volkswagen s scandal continues to dog the industry
since may the chairman of the board of audi ag rupert stadler as well as a further member of the management board are now named suspects the munich prosecutor s office said
the probe could trigger a leadership crisis at audi and its parent volkswagen where stadler was in april elevated to the post of head of group sales
volkswagen declined to comment
audi said it was fully cooperating with prosecutors
stadler was in a board meeting and unavailable for comment
munich prosecutors said the two suspects were being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and for their alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the european market
stadler has been under fire ever since audi admitted to using cheating software in november two months after volkswagen but has enjoyed backing from members of the porsche and piech families who control volkswagen and audi
before becoming audi ceo in stadler was a confidant of and former assistant to chairman ferdinand piech the scion of the group s controlling piech clan
audi the biggest contributor to volkswagen s profit admitted in november its liter diesel engines were fitted with a device deemed illegal in the united states that allowed cars to evade emissions limits
in march audi s supervisory board recommended that shareholders endorse stadler as chief executive even as prosecutors raided audi to investigate who was involved in the use of any illicit software deployed in vw audi and porsche cars in the united states
audi said last month it had discovered problems with a further cars
