update 2-citgo seeks crude as supplies from venezuela dry up -trade, data
houston reuters the unit of venezuela s oil producer pdvsa is increasing purchases of crude on the open market because it can not get sufficient deliveries from its struggling parent company traders said on monday
citgo petroleum has been buying crude from multiple countries worldwide as pdvsa has been unable to comply with the contractual volume of heavy crude due to falling output and port congestion slowing deliveries according to the traders
declining oil production lawsuits by creditors shortages of spare parts for terminals and executive braindrain have all reduced pdvsa s ability to export oil
most recently conocophillips actions to seize pdvsa assets to cash in on a billion billion arbitration award have added to the firm s export issues
crude exports are venezuela s main source of revenue but the opec member has seen deliveries fall sharply in the last few months dropping to million barrels per day bpd in may from million bpd in april according to thomson reuters trade flows data
citgo in recent weeks has been buying colombian and ecuadorean heavy crude on the spot market as well as azeri light from the black sea region and arab heavy and medium crudes according to the reuters data and traders
from january through april citgo was the customer most affected by pdvsa s inability to fulfil its contracts according to the venezuelan company s internal data
pdvsa s oil output this year has fallen to million bpd a low
citgo has a contract to import venezuelan merey crude from pdvsa but pdvsa has not sent a single cargo of that grade in over a month forcing citgo to buy spot cargoes of diluted crude oil dco from joint ventures according to the traders and reuters data
pdvsa has sent other grades including corocoro and pedernales but only in small volumes
they are mainly looking for latin american heavy grades said a trader who sold two spot crude cargoes to citgo for june delivery
citgo can process up to bpd of crude in three refineries
in the past pdvsa supplied as much as percent of citgo s crude requirements but volumes have been slowly declining for years
the subsidiary has a contingency plan for diversifying imports if venezuelan supply declines further according to a citgo employee who declined to be identified as the information was private
the plan has not yet been activated the person added
as of june pdvsa had million barrels worth of crude to be shipped from the port of jose and through new sts transfers off its paraguana refining center crp according to reuters vessel tracking and trade flows data
since early june pdvsa has been notifying customers about its need to employ sts operations
the backlog has decreased to vessels this week from over tankers last week according to reuters data as pdvsa has focused on loading the largest vessels first and rejected nominations for receiving new tankers in june until it finishes loading those already in line
each sts operation is taking almost a week said a shipping source
costs are higher special vessels are needed and pdvsa operators have to be moved from other ports
it s a lot of large tankers chartered by valero energy vitol nayara energy and reliance energy of india and china national petroleum corp cnpc were waiting on monday near jose port for crude
conocophillips bid to claim billion from arbitration led to a tanker backlog representing nearly a month s worth of shipments at its main terminal
graphic pdvsa noncompliance with oil supply contracts citgo was expecting to receive about million barrels of venezuelan merey crude in june one of the traders said
instead it imported a cargo of dco that discharged last week and several other cargoes of the same grade have set sail to its refineries according to the reuters data
the pressure for venezuelan oil eased up slightly in early june as citgo s corpus christi refinery halted its fluid catalytic cracker fcc due to a fire
but declining production of upgraded crude at pdvsa s joint ventures in the orinoco belt the country s largest producing region has limited the barrels citgo normally could access in place of merey
of four crude ventures that process up to bpd of oil for exports two are undergoing maintenance and a third is expected to start major maintenance later this month according to two sources close to the projects
