previously named essar oil nayara was bought by russian state rosneft and partners in a billion billion pounds deal last year
it typically buys around million barrels a month from iran according to data made available to reuters from industry and shipping sources
the cuts by nayara provide the latest indication that asian buyers will cut orders from iran after president donald trump last month pulled out from the accord between iran and world powers that lifted sanctions on tehran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme

mayara s chief executive anand said last week the refiner did not expect problems in finding alternative supplies in should it reduce iranian orders
anand said nayara would leverage the supply and trading network of its major stakeholders rosneft and swiss commodity trader trafigura to replace iranian oil
