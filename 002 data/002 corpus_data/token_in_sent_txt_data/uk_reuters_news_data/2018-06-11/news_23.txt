israel's delek drilling seeks shareholder approval for egypt pipeline investment
jerusalem june reuters shareholders in israel s delek drilling will vote next month on whether to approve a million investment that will allow the company to export gas to egypt via a subsea pipeline
delek announced on monday that it would hold a special shareholders meeting on july to decide whether to go ahead with the investment in east mediterranean gas emg which operates a pipeline to carry gas between israel and egypt s sinai peninsula
delek and noble energy are partners in the large tamar and leviathan natural gas fields off israel s coast and signed deals in february with egyptian firm dolphinus holdings to sell billion of gas
delek and noble have been negotiating to buy the rights to use emg s pipeline which was built years ago as part of a natural gas deal but has been out of use
egypt used to sell gas to israel under a agreement which collapsed in after months of attacks on the pipeline by militants in egypt s remote sinai peninsula
it has since been out of commission and emg is suing the egyptian government for damages
noble and delek now want to send gas in the other direction
delek said in a statement to the tel aviv stock exchange that its shareholders would meet on july to vote on whether the company could hold off on distributing profits in order to invest in emg
it estimated its investment would be about million but did not provide other financial details
it said percent of shareholders would need to support the deal for it to move forward
