oil had some support thanks to gains in the equities market analysts said
all three major stock indexes were trading in positive territory on monday just hours ahead of the meeting in singapore between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un
prices were also weighing uncertainty on opec supply hikes
for months opec and its allies have curbed production in the hopes of stabilizing markets and supporting prices
the group is set to meet june in vienna and decide how to move forward with its supply curb policy against the backdrop of tumbling venezuelan output and looming sanctions against iran the opec producer
last week we saw some news stories indicating that the trump administration had asked opec to increase oil production
but the week went out and we saw those stories walk back
and now we re seeing a number of opec producers who are in favour of the status quo said andrew lipow president of lipow and associates in houston
iraq s oil minister jabar said that prices still require support and stability and producers should not the oil market s need for more supplies
according to a statement the minister also rejects unilateral decisions by some oil producers without consulting the rest of the members of the agreement
top exporter saudi arabia told opec that it raised oil output to slightly more than million barrels per day bpd in may a source familiar with the matter said but still within its agreed target
even as opec trims output production from members including the united states and russia is rising
russian news agency interfax said on saturday that the country s production had surpassed its target hitting million bpd in early june
in the united states the number of new rigs drilling for oil rose by one last week to its highest since march data from energy services company baker hughes showed
that suggests output already at a record million bpd will climb further
