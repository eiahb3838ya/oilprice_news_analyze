small farmers in malaysia the world s second largest palm oil producer after indonesia said a move to cap palm oil exports at an eu level would be discriminatory and a betrayal
this proposal is a betrayal of promises made by the french government and others in europe to the people of malaysia they said in a statement sent by faces of palm oil lobby group
those promises must be honoured
