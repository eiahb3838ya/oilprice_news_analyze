update 3-glencore snaps up rio tinto's hail creek coal mine, project for $1.7 bln
sydney reuters glencore is buying rio tinto s hail creek coal mine and the valeria coal project in australia for billion tightening the swiss trading and mining giant s grip on coal as its rivals exit the industry
the acquisition announced by both companies on tuesday follows glencore s purchase of half of rio tinto s hunter valley coal operations also in australia for billion last year in a deal with china s yancoal australia glencore is already the world s biggest exporter of thermal coal used for power stations and hail creek will give it a bigger stake in metallurgical coal used for steelmaking
you ve got one of the few big companies in glencore that is both willing and able and clearly likes coal strategically and has been acquiring these assets said paul gait an analyst at bernstein in london
the sale consists of rio s percent interest in the hail creek operating mine and its percent interest in the valeria project the company said in a statement
rio tinto made a strategic decision in to exit coal and focus on growth in iron ore copper and its aluminum division
on tuesday it said it was still looking to sell its remaining australian coal assets the kestrel coking coal mine and the winchester south development project
investors had expected the two mines and projects to be sold as a package
the best option to extract value for our shareholders is to go in a piecemeal approach rio chief executive jacques told reporters after a business event in melbourne
analysts said the price for hail creek and valeria looked good for rio tinto while not too expensive for glencore
given we all expected a billion to billion number for hail creek plus kestrel and the other stuff it s a pretty big number said shaw and partners analyst peter o connor in sydney
rio s shares rose percent while glencore s were flat
gait said that he was bullish on metallurgical coal prices now above a ton which would help justify the price glencore agreed to pay
glencore clearly have synergies in terms of both the operating and physically the marketing of these assets and when i look at the price that they ve acquired these things for it doesn t seem to me to be exorbitant he said
rio tinto said it planned to use the sale proceeds for general corporate purposes however jacques did not rule out returning the cash to shareholders in future
you shouldn t draw any conclusions
the next time we review it will be in august he told reporters referring to the company s next moves on capital management
ubs has forecast that the sale of hail creek and kestrel could help rio hand back more than billion to shareholders over the next months
the hail creek deal is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of rio said
the remaining percent of hail creek is owned by units of nippon steel and sumitomo metal corp marubeni corp and sumitomo corp which all have rights to sell their stakes to glencore which it said in a statement would cost up to million
