rpt-column-funds trim bullish oil positions, but no rush for exit: kemp
repeats with no changes

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london march reuters hedge funds continue to turn more cautious on the outlook for oil prices but the liquidation of former bullish positions is very gradual suggesting most see price risks close to balance
hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by million barrels in the week to march
funds have trimmed their net long position in six of the last seven weeks by a total of million barrels according to position records published by regulators and exchanges
but managers still hold a net long position across the petroleum complex that is million barrels higher than at the end of june
the entire adjustment has come from the bullish side of the market with long positions cut by million barrels since
bearish short positions have actually declined by million barrels in the same period
long positions in brent nymex and ice wti gasoline heating oil and european gasoil total million barrels compared with just million barrels of short positions
as a result long positions outnumber short ones by a ratio of more than not far below the record ratio of set almost two months ago
the liquidation of bullish positions shows no sign of accelerating
there are no signs of significant fresh short selling
and the hedge fund positioning remains exceptionally lopsided
fund managers have become slightly more cautious about the prospect of a further increase in oil prices following the strong rally between june and january but few are willing to bet prices will drop back much
the fund community still expects oil prices to rise further but it has inevitably and logically become slightly less bullish given prices have risen by more than almost percent already
fund positioning in the oil market continues to look stretched and remains a source of considerable downside price risk if and when portfolio managers try to realise more of their profits
but the fact liquidation has so far been gradual there has been no rush for the exit and prices have remained steady have given bullish managers more resilience and confidence
prices appear capped on the upside by the threat of increasing output from shale producers but supported from below by strong consumption growth and opec s determination to continue cutting inventories
for now traders seem comfortable with prices moving in a relatively narrow range around per barrel for brent which is contributing to the fall in volatility to its lowest level since
