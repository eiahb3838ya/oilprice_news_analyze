trafigura moves hedging out of europe, leads u.s. oil exports race
lausanne switzerland reuters trading giant trafigura has moved its commodities hedging operations to the united states and asia and away from europe to avoid being subject to new tighter mifid ii market regulations
we moved our hedging business away from europe into the and singapore and other locations chief financial officer christophe salmon told reporters
trafigura was one of the main critics of europe s mifid ii regulations saying it would drive business away from the continent as it was introducing unnecessary complications to operations
mifid ii introduced position limits on contracts such as brent oil or refined products but many traders have long argued that they hold large positions in paper markets to hedge risks in the physical market rather than for purely speculative purposes
trafigura trades around million barrels per day bpd of oil and refined products roughly on par with rival glencore but behind the world s largest oil trading house vitol
you don t want to diversify for the sake of it
you have to be in the top in any commodity you trade
it is extremely important to maintain scale chief executive jeremy weir told the same briefing
weir said trafigura has been actively aggregating volumes from independent producers for exports to capitalise on its infrastructure amid a boom in shale oil
he said trafigura has been the largest crude and condensate exporter over the past year
weir and trafigura s of market risk ben luckock both said the company was bullish on oil in the due to a shortage of new projects
peak demand is a long long way away in the future
shale oil is not a panacea for global oil production weir said
luckock said oil basin of permian can not be the only solution to world oil supply while demand is growing by million bpd
in the oil industry it should be a marathon but people are running it at a sprint pace
they are doing an amazing job but growth is tiring in the reporting by dmitry zhdannikov editing by jason neely
