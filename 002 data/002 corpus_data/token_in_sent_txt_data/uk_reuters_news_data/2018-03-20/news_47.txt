exclusive-india's essar oil picks trafigura, bp for $1 bln oil-backed loan
london reuters essar oil has picked trafigura and bp to lend it billion million to be repaid with cargoes of refined products as the indian refiner s new owners seek to diversify the firm s financing base sources with direct knowledge of the matter said
russian oil major rosneft fund ucp and swiss commodities trader trafigura bought essar oil s large refinery fuel stations and infrastructure for billion last year
essar oil has long relied entirely on funding from indian banks while the new shareholders want to reduce exchange costs by adding alternative financing sources and directly use dollars to buy its oil instead
late last year the refiner began talks with traders to raise cash in exchange for refined products such as gasoline and gasoil delivered over three to four years
it would be the refiner s first major prepayment
the sources said that trafigura and bp were jointly working to structure and then syndicate the loan with banks in the next few weeks
bp and trafigura declined to comment while essar was not immediately available
existing and possible new sanctions will complicate discussions banking sources said
rosneft has been under sanctions since russia s annexation of crimea in and the refiner also runs significant oil volumes coming from iran and venezuela
while the international oil embargo on iran was lifted in early restrictions on dollar use in connection to iran remain
president donald trump has also repeatedly criticised the nuclear pact with tehran and threatened to stop extending sanctions relief
trump s nomination of iran hawk mike pompeo as the new secretary of state has fuelled fears of an end to sanctions relief
the united states has also considered oil sanctions on venezuela
