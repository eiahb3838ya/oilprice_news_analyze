update 2-prosecutors search vw headquarters in new emissions investigation
berlin reuters german prosecutors said on tuesday they had searched volkswagen s headquarters as part of a new investigation into whether the carmaker had overstated the fuel efficiency of more vehicles than previously disclosed
the news is the latest setback in the german company s efforts to move on from a scandal in which it admitted to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines
prosecutors from the city of braunschweig searched offices at volkswagen s vw headquarters in nearby wolfsburg at the start of march seizing documents and computer files that will now be reviewed a spokesman for the prosecutor s office said confirming a report by german magazine wirtschaftswoche
they were checking a statement issued by vw on about three months after its dieselgate scandal broke in the united states over suspicions its contents were incorrect in that statement vw said its own investigations found it had understated fuel consumption and hence carbon dioxide emissions on no more than vehicles
that was much lower than its preliminary estimate of around diesel and gasoline vehicles produced five weeks earlier which caused vw to warn it could face a billion euro billion hit to profits from the disclosure
vw also said in its december statement that it had found no evidence of unlawful alterations to emissions data
prosecutors said on tuesday they were investigating unknown individuals over suspicions of market manipulation
vw europe s biggest carmaker confirmed the searches but declined further comment
at gmt its shares were little changed at euros
separately braunschweig prosecutors are investigating vw s former ceo martin winterkorn former finance chief and current chairman hans dieter poetsch and current vw brand ceo herbert diess over possible market manipulations related to the dieselgate scandal
vw has denied any market manipulations
manfred doess head of legal affairs at vw s majority stakeholder porsche se said on tuesday he did not expect the latest inquiry to lead authorities to press charges against vw
in my judgement nothing will come out of this doess said at the holding firm s earnings press conference
since its dieselgate scandal vw has launched a investment in electric vehicles and mobility services as part of an attempt to rebuild its image
