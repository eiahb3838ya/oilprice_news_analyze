water-smart agriculture could cut migration risk - fao
london march thomson reuters foundation water stress is increasingly driving migration around the world but efforts to adapt to worsening shortages could help a new study suggests
water stress not just shortages but issues is expected to drive more people from their communities permanently and cause rapid growth of cities according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao
of the world s people suffer some water scarcity for part of each year with communities dependent on agriculture worst affected said fao jose graziano da silva in a video message for the world water forum in brazil
finding ways to adapt to that reality rather than simply responding to disasters caused by water shortages is the most effective way to deal with the problem the fao said
water use has increased worldwide over the past century said the study which drew on a survey of more than research papers on water scarcity and migration issues
as climate change brings increasingly irregular rainfall worsening droughts and higher temperatures water scarcity will likely increase particularly as demand for agricultural water remains high the study said
investment in preparing for water crises such as adopting more agricultural practices could cut the need for people to migrate the study said although drawing a clear link between water scarcity and migration remains complicated
experts believe drought played a role in the early stages of the syrian conflict when million farmers headed to cities as the country suffered its worst drought on record said charles iceland of the world resources institute a research body
drought was clearly not the major factor he said but instead exerted an additional pressure alongside political and social issues
he said much of the world would face water scarcity by as populations and temperatures rise
combating that would require changes including in agriculture such as adopting drip irrigation he said
about percent of freshwater used each year goes to agriculture experts have estimated
