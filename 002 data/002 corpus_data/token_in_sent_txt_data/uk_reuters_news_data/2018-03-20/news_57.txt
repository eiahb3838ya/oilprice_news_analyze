defendants violated multiple provisions of the federal securities laws by engaging in a prolonged fraudulent course of conduct the securities and exchange commission said in a filing with the district court in manhattan

the defendants are rio tinto former chief executive officer tom albanese and former chief financial officer guy elliott
in an emailed comment a rio tinto spokesman said rio tinto believes that the sec case is unwarranted and that when all the facts are considered by the court or if necessary by a jury the sec s claims will be rio tinto had acquired the coal assets in a takeover of riversdale mining and later renamed rio tinto coal mozambique for about billion
it wrote off most of the assets in january and sold them in late for just million
on march the defendants said the sec was plainly wrong to say they should have taken a big writedown no later than months after the purchase
they said rising prices for scarce coking coal offset lower barging and rail capacity and might have even boosted the assets value at that time
the sec said that the defendants were wrong to argue that it was too soon to book an impairment on rio tinto coal mozambique rtcm
rio tinto was required to assess impairment at every reporting period it said
the defendants have until march to respond court records show
the case is being overseen by district judge analisa torres in manhattan
on march the australian securities and investments commission brought its own civil court action against rio tinto albanese and elliott over the coal assets
