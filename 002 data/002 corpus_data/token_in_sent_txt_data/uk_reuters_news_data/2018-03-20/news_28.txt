update 1-us rejects eu alternatives to solar safeguard tariffs - wto filing
geneva reuters washington has rejected european union proposals for an alternative to safeguard tariffs imposed on solar power goods the two trading powers said in a joint world trade organization filing on tuesday
the percent tariff on solar panels was among the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the trump administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda aimed at helping manufacturers
safeguard tariffs are a form of emergency trade protection permitted under wto rules if a country is facing a sudden damaging surge in imports of a particular product
but they come with strings attached the united states is supposed to compensate major solar countries by offering them improved trade in other areas or accept them putting up barriers to exports to balance things out
the eu china taiwan south korea and malaysia all demanded compensation after president donald trump signed the tariffs into law in january
at an meeting on the eu said its exports were not causing serious damage to competitors due to the volume of trade and higher prices the wto filing said
thus it suggested a form of measure that would be less penalizing for european union imports such as a quota allocated by country or a minimum import price
the united states did not agree with this the wto filing said
in addition there was no agreement on the form of compensation though both sides agreed to monitor developments and continue discussions
in a separate document the united states and taiwan said that if there was no agreement between them taiwan could introduce compensatory measures in february
