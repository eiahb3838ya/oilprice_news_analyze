vw looking at ways to boost skoda output, including new plant - sources
berlin reuters volkswagen is looking at ways to boost production at skoda including building a new factory outside the brand s czech home to help it keep up with booming demand company sources said
best known for its cars skoda moved last year into the market for vehicles suvs with the new kodiaq and karoq models and plans to launch another models by
but attempts to increase capacity at its main czech plant in mlada boleslav where it builds more than half a million cars a year are in limbo because the kovo union opposes extending the to saturday two volkswagen vw group sources said
skoda has offered to create jobs in the czech republic if labor leaders agree to additional shifts at the two automaking plants a move management says could boost output at mlada boleslav alone by cars a year
additional capacity is absolutely essential to be able to meet continually growing demand skoda said in an emailed statement
the company has been producing at full capacity for some once the butt of jokes in the west skoda has blossomed under nearly years of vw ownership to become one of its profit drivers even beating luxury brand audi s and bmw s operating margins last year thanks to its cheap labor and to vw s modular production platforms
growing demand in europe and china has helped skoda s sales to jump nearly a third over the past five years to a record million cars in
sources said skoda could miss out on about car sales by if capacity is left unchanged
production of skoda models has been expanded in recent years in markets including china india and russia
vw and skoda are aiming to find solutions by the summer the sources said to help the brand with its goal to expand foreign sales to countries from about by
deliberations include searching for capacity within the vw group as well as investing in a new facility outside the czech republic where production could be shared with other vw brands the sources said
of course we are always pleased if brands like skoda develop very positively
but that also affects other brands where we have bottlenecks vw group chief executive matthias mueller told reuters tv last week when asked how he wanted to solve capacity constraints at skoda
our platform strategy thankfully gives us a chance to also react at short notice meaning within a few weeks or months he said referring to the group s strategy of maximizing the number of parts used in common across brand and model lines
last year labor leaders at the group s vw brand pushed for some skoda production to be shifted from the czech republic to help offset declining output at german sites fuelling concerns among some czech workers and politicians
it remains unclear where skoda models could be built
the vw brand s main wolfsburg plant in germany is grappling with falling demand for its golf hatchback but utilization has improved at a fellow german plant in emden which has been awarded production of another model and so sees no room to build skodas before a vw source said
audi says capacity is tight at its main ingolstadt plant in germany where some models are based on the mqb platform shared by skoda
vw s spanish brand seat is also operating near full capacity at martorell after the new arona suv was added to assembly lines and the brand has swapped production of the audi for the audi to ease workload at the factory
but in the wake of the group s costly diesel emissions scandal it is likely to want to tap any capacity across the business ahead of building a new factory
vw finance chief frank witter last week reaffirmed the group s goal to cut both capital spending and r d costs to percent of sales by from percent and percent respectively
i have said all along that and will be a dog fight and i haven t changed my view witter also skoda s chairman said on an earnings call
at skoda management are determined not to lose momentum
we are intensively pushing forward skoda ceo bernhard maier said at the geneva auto show this month
we are motivated from head to toe to continue along this reporting by andreas cremer and reuters tv editing by mark potter
