update 5-trump praises u.s. military sales to saudi as he welcomes crown prince
washington reuters president donald trump gave a warm welcome to saudi arabia s powerful crown prince mohammed bin salman on tuesday and credited defence sales to the saudis with boosting american jobs even as riyadh s involvement in yemen s civil war faced criticism
in the oval office trump and the crown prince praised the strength of ties which had grown strained under the obama administration in part over differing views towards riyadh s regional rival iran
not so with trump who has taken a hardline view against iran similar to that of the saudi crown prince who has compared iran s supreme leader to adolf hitler
the talks were part of the first visit by the prince to the united states since he became the heir apparent last year to king salman
trump s treatment highlighted his administration s strong backing of the crown prince who carried out an purge that consolidated his power and whose aggressive foreign policy has caused unease among some western allies
at the same time the kingdom has seen a cautious new climate of social freedoms with the rise of the crown prince after decades of elderly rulers
trump and prince mohammed discussed an agreement last year for billion worth of saudi investments with the united states including large purchases of military equipment
trump said the military sales contributed to the creation of american jobs
trump held up charts to show the depth of saudi purchases of military hardware ranging from ships to missile defence to planes and fighting vehicles
saudi arabia is a very wealthy nation and they re going to give the united states some of that wealth hopefully in the form of jobs in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world he told reporters
the crown prince who is also the defence minister is on a public relations blitz while travelling in the united states with stops in new york boston seattle los angeles san francisco and houston to cultivate investments
as they talked senators debated a resolution seeking an end to support for saudi arabia s campaign in yemen s civil war in which about people have been killed
some members of congress have been critical of the saudi involvement particularly over the humanitarian situation and civilian casualties
the senate rejected the resolution
a coalition with logistical and intelligence support from washington is fighting to counter the influence of iran an ally of the houthi militia which denies any help from tehran and says it is fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and gulf powers in thrall to the west
a senior trump administration official said the two leaders talked about the humanitarian situation in yemen and that civilian casualties did not come up in a major way given that washington had been working with the saudis to minimize them
they also discussed nuclear cooperation
riyadh has been stepping up plans to develop a civilian nuclear energy capability as part of a plan to reduce its dependence on oil
republican senator bob corker chairman of the chamber s foreign relations committee said senators questioned the crown prince closely about yemen during a meeting with him on tuesday
the saudi embassy said the prince discussed with members countering the threat posed by iran and the houthi militias as well as saudi efforts to address and alleviate the humanitarian situation in prince mohammed capped his rapid rise to power last june by replacing his elder cousin prince mohammed bin nayef who had close relationships with intelligence and defence circles as crown prince
he is likely to rule for many decades if he succeeds his father
trump praised the king s move to elevate mohammed and called ties strong as ever
i thought your father made a very wise decision
and i miss your father a special man he said
king salman is to visit the united states later this year
although the prince has won western plaudits for seeking to ease saudi arabia s reliance on oil tackle chronic corruption and reform the conservative sunni muslim kingdom the severity and secrecy of his crackdown last november unnerved some in the west
the crown prince in a rare foray into speaking english said on tuesday the saudi pledge for billion in investments would end up at billion when fully implemented
he said a window for implementing the deal was under way
a key focus of his visit will be any information on a potentially lucrative listing of up to percent of saudi oil firm aramco
the new york stock exchange is among the possible venues for the listing
also high on the agenda in the white house talks was confronting iran a country trump has repeatedly criticized for its expansionist policies in the middle east
saudi arabia on monday called the iran nuclear deal a flawed agreement and trump has made clear he plans to exit the agreement unless changes are made to it
but iran has not been treating that part of the world or the world itself appropriately he said
the deal is coming up in one month and we ll see what the prince was also due to have dinner with jared kushner trump s senior adviser and along with jason greenblatt the two point men in the trump administration overseeing middle east peace efforts
crown prince mohammed and kushner have forged a close relationship which has at times come under criticism in washington for circumventing normal diplomatic channels
