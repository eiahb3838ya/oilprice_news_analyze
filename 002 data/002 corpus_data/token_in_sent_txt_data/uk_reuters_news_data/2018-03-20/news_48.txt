carbon prices too low to protect se asian forests from rubber expansion - report
kuala lumpur march thomson reuters foundation the price of carbon credits must rise drastically if they are to help protect southeast asia s tropical forests against rubber plantation expansion according to researchers
individuals companies and countries purchase carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions
putting a cost on carbon emissions provides an incentive to do business more sustainably and a disincentive to engage in environmentally damaging activities like clearing forests
but researchers found that credits bought and sold on international markets would need to rise from per tonne of carbon dioxide to per tonne if they are to safeguard southeast asian forests from rubber
at current prices carbon credits can not compete with the profits to be made from felling forests and developing rubber plantations according to the report published this month in the journal nature communications
we looked at rubber as an economic driver of deforestation said eleanor the lead researcher who was at britain s university of east anglia when she worked on the study
what kind of profits can you make from rubber plantations and what kind incentive to preserve forests do you need to provide through carbon finance such a large study has not been done before she told the thomson reuters foundation
most forest conservation efforts in the region tend to focus on palm oil expansion and the growth of rubber plantations has received little attention said
rubber demand rose over the last years as emerging markets like china and india became wealthier and more people were able to buy cars and motorcycles
rubber plantations cover about million hectares around the world of which are in southeast asia while annual expansion rates roughly doubled between said
converting forests to rubber plantations results in net carbon emissions as the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere but that is not widely recognised in the industry the researchers said
rubber is from trees and so it looks like you ve replaced one kind of forest with another said tom evans an conservation director at the wildlife conservation society which was involved in the report
but really you ve replaced a high carbon system that provides a lot of other ecosystems services with a much lower carbon pledges made by governments and large tyre companies as well as the enforcement of forest protection laws are crucial to curb rubber expansion the report said
besides higher carbon credit prices it also recommended further development of synthetic alternatives to natural rubber and improvements in recycling of natural rubber
the researchers focused on forests in cambodia but those in china laos myanmar and vietnam are also under threat from rubber said
