other bidders included ayers energy llc wasatch energy llc and kirkwood oil and gas inc according to the data
the auction comes as the administration of president donald trump seeks to boost domestic energy production by expanding federal leasing and rolling back land protections
local officials have been eager to open up the areas administered by the blm saying resource extraction is one of few economic opportunities for rural san juan county one of utah s poorest areas
oil and gas operations are an important contributor to a diversified county economy and the county supports leasing as a necessary step toward realizing economic benefits county planner nick sanberg said in comments to the blm
but conservation groups fumed threatening lawsuits
we won t sit idly by while president trump and interior secretary ryan zinke auction off america s cultural and public lands heritage to the oil and gas industry said stephen bloch legal director with the southern utah wilderness alliance
the alliance argued that the blm did not adequately study potential impacts on wilderness and cultural sites

a bid of per acre won a parcel next to canyons of the ancients national monument
the results were more competitive than those of a lease sale last week in which a parcel near the upper missouri river breaks national monument sold for the minimum per acre
zinke this month deferred or scaled back two other lease sales near archaeological and tourist sites in new mexico and his home state of montana amid local outcry and opposition from state lawmakers
the blm was not immediately available for comment but said it would post results of the sale including names of winning bidders by wednesday morning
other recent lease sales have yielded relatively low bids a reflection of soft demand for federal property as the oil and gas industry taps vast reserves on private lands
