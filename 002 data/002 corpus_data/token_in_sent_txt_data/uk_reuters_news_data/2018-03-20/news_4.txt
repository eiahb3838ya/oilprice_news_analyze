update 1-u.s. senate rejects bid to end u.s. support for saudi campaign in yemen
washington reuters the senate on tuesday killed a resolution seeking an end to support for saudi arabia s campaign in yemen s civil war the same day president donald trump was due to meet with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman at the white house
the senate voted to dismiss the resolution which sought for the first time to take advantage of a provision in the war powers act that allows any senator to introduce a resolution on whether to withdraw armed forces from a conflict not authorized by congress
during senate debate before the vote some backers called the conflict in yemen a humanitarian catastrophe which they blamed on the saudis
independent senator bernie sanders noted the deaths of thousands of civilians displacement of millions famine and potentially the largest cholera outbreak in history because of the conflict
that is what is going on in yemen today as a result of the war there sanders said
senator mike lee a republican backer of the resolution stressed that it had been in the works for some time and was not timed in any way shape or form to coincide with the saudi crown prince s visit
saudi arabia is an indispensable partner in the region without which the united states would be less successful lee said
the vote was largely along party lines although a handful of democrats voted with the majority republicans to kill the measure and a handful of republicans supported the failed effort to let it move ahead
