dubai reuters iran s elite revolutionary guards vowed on sunday to exact deadly and unforgettable vengeance for an attack on a military parade that killed people including of their comrades and tehran accused gulf arab states of backing the gunmen
saturday s assault one of the worst ever against the most powerful force of the islamic republic struck a blow at its security establishment at a time when the united states and its gulf allies are working to isolate tehran
considering the guards full knowledge about the centres of deployment of the criminal terrorists leaders they will face a deadly and unforgettable vengeance in the near future the guards said in a statement carried by state media
four assailants fired on a viewing stand in the southwestern city of ahvaz where iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the islamic republic s war with iraq
soldiers crawled about as gunfire crackled
women and children fled for their lives
islamic state s amaq agency posted a video of three men in a vehicle who it said were on their way to carry out the attack
a man wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with what appears to be a revolutionary guard logo discussed the impending attack in farsi in the video
we are muslims they are kafirs the man says
he adds we will destroy them with a strong and attack inshallah god willing ahvaz national resistance an iranian ethnic arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in khuzestan province also claimed responsibility for the attack
neither of them provided evidence
there has been a blizzard of furious statements from top iranian officials including president hassan rouhani accusing iran s adversaries the united states and gulf states of provoking the bloodshed and threatening a tough response
nikki haley ambassador to the united nations rejected rouhani s accusations
he s got the iranian people protesting every ounce of money that goes into iran goes into his military he has oppressed his people for a long time and he needs to look at his own base to figure out where that s coming from she told cnn
senior commanders of the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc have said the ahvaz attack was carried out by militants trained by gulf states and israel and backed by america
but it is unlikely the irgc will strike any of these foes directly
the guards could put on a show of strength by firing missiles at opposition groups operating in iraq or syria that may be linked to the militants who staged the attack
they are also likely to enforce a tight security policy in khuzestan province arresting any perceived domestic opponents including civil rights activists
three arab activists told reuters that security forces especially the intelligence branch of the revolutionary guards had detained more activists in ahvaz
rouhani engineered iran s nuclear deal with world powers that ushered in a cautious detente with washington before tensions flared anew with president donald trump s decision in may to pull out of the accord and reimpose sanctions on tehran
the attack on the military parade is likely to give security hardliners like the guards more political ammunition because they did not endorse the pragmatist rouhani s pursuit of the nuclear deal with the west analysts say
in new york trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani said on saturday that sanctions were inflicting economic pain on iran that could lead to a successful revolution
the trump administration has said that changing iran s system of government is not policy
secretary of state mike pompeo told fox news on sunday that trump was willing to meet top iranian officials for talks
asked if trump would like to meet with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the highest authority in iran pompeo replied the president has said he ll talk with anyone if we can have a constructive mostly shi ite muslim iran is at odds with sunni muslim saudi arabia for predominance in the middle east
the regional superpowers support opposing sides in the civil wars in yemen and syria as well as rival political groups in iraq and lebanon
a senior united arab emirates official denied iranian allegations alluding to the involvement of the uae in training gunmen that claimed the attack
the formal incitement against the uae from within iran is unfortunate and has escalated after the ahvaz attack minister of state for foreign affairs for the united arab emirates anwar gargash said in a tweet
