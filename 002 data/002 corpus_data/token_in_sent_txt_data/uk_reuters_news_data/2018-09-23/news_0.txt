california urges trump administration to abandon fuel rule plan
washington reuters california s top air regulator urged the trump administration on sunday to abandon a plan to freeze fuel efficiency standards through as automakers urged state and federal regulators to reach agreement to extend nationwide rules
mary nichols who chairs the state s air resources board asked the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and environmental protection agency to reverse course saying the plan to freeze requirements at levels turns its back on decades of progress in cleaning up cars and the trump administration also wants to revoke california s authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles
california is moving ahead with setting its own rules and states said in august they would challenge the rollback in court
california will take the necessary actions to protect our people and follow the law
it is not too late to choose a better way nichols said in testimony made public on sunday that she will deliver on monday in fresno california

the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing general motors co volkswagen ag toyota motor corp ford motor co and others again urged california and the trump administration to reach agreement to retain nationwide emissions rules and avoid a prolonged legal battle
the group avoided comments on most specifics in the trump proposal but backed unspecified fuel efficiency increases and incentives for electric vehicles
the automotive group will say in testimony released on sunday for delivery in fresno that automakers support continued improvements in fuel economy while balancing priorities like affordability safety jobs and the the trump plan would hike oil consumption by about barrels per day by the but reduce automakers regulatory costs by more than billion
nichols testimony dismissed central trump administration arguments that the rules will save up to motorists lives over the coming decades because they lower the price of new vehicles prod people into buying safer newer vehicles faster and result in motorists driving less because vehicles will cost more to operate
these claims are not only absurd on their face they are not supportable by fact nichols wrote
