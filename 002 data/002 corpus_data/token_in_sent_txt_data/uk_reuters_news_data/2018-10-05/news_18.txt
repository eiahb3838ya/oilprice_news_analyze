update 1-rising use of plastics to drive oil demand to 2050 - iea
london reuters plastics and other petrochemical products will drive global oil demand to offsetting slower consumption of motor fuel the international energy agency iea said on friday
despite government efforts to cut pollution and carbon emissions from oil and gas the agency said it expected the rapid growth of emerging economies such as india and china to propel demand for petrochemical products
petrochemicals that are derived from oil and gas feedstocks form the building blocks for products that range from plastic bottles and beauty products to fertilisers and explosives
oil demand for transport is expected to slow by due to the rise of electric vehicles and combustion engines but that would be offset by rising demand for petrochemicals the iea said in a report
the petrochemical sector is one of the blind spots of the global energy debate and there is no question that it will be the key driver of oil demand growth for many years to come iea executive director fatih birol told reuters
petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of global oil demand growth by and nearly half of demand growth by according to the world s energy watchdog
global demand for petrochemical feedstock accounted for million barrels per day bpd or roughly percent of total demand for oil in
the figure is forecast to grow to almost million bpd in
most demand growth will take place in the middle east and china where big petrochemical plants are being built
oil companies such as exxon mobil and royal dutch shell plan to invest in new petrochemical plants in the coming decades betting on the rising demand for plastics in emerging economies
in the middle east major producers such as saudi arabia and kuwait are also investing in large petrochemical plants because in some cases they can make more money by converting crude oil directly into plastics rather than oil products such as gasoline and diesel birol said
plastics use has come under increased scrutiny as waste makes its way into the oceans where it harms marine life prompting several countries to ban partly ban or tax plastic bags
but the iea report said government efforts to encourage recycling in order to curb carbon emissions would have only a minor impact on petrochemical growth
although substantial increases in recycling and efforts to curb plastics take place especially led by europe japan and korea these efforts will be far outweighed by the sharp increase in developing economies of plastic consumption it said
under the iea s most aggressive scenario recycling could hit around percent of chemical demand
petrochemical plants mainly run on light oil products such as naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas lpg
but natural gas is becoming an increasingly favored feedstock particularly in the united states where shale gas production has risen
the report said petrochemical projects would account for percent of the roughly billion cubic meters in gas demand increase between and and percent of the increase projected for
