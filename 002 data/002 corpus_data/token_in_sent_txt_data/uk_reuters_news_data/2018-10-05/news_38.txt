the views expressed are his own by john kemp london oct reuters crude oil prices continue to climb despite attempts by oil producers to reassure the market about availability and the existence of enough spare capacity to offset oil lost as a result of sanctions on iran
recent price moves bear a strong resemblance to previous price spikes in and especially if prices are expressed in euros or yen to eliminate the impact of a stronger dollar this time around
brent crude has risen to almost euros per barrel the same level it reached in may on its way to a peak of euros in july
futures have also hit yen per barrel the same as in october on their way to a peak of yen in july
prices in indian rupees are already at the same level that they peaked in and on the way to the record set in
only the strength of the dollar against other currencies is masking how high prices have become in countries outside the united states and
prices have already risen to a level that has contributed to a slowdown in economic growth and oil consumption in the past
expensive energy is back at a bad time for the global economy the chief executive of the international energy agency has warned iea boss urges oil producers to ease supply concerns reuters
it is now high time for all the players especially those key producers and oil exporters to consider the situation and take the right steps to comfort the market he added
the game is well underway with the united states blaming opec russia faulting sanctions and saudi arabia blaming speculators for escalating prices
in reality sanctions output restrictions by opec and its allies strong consumption growth and position building among the hedge funds have all contributed to the price surge
aggressive implementation of sanctions on iran has left refiners and traders concerned about the future availability of crude and questioning whether opec will still have enough spare capacity to offset any other losses
opec and its allies became fixated on cutting oil inventories down to the average and waited far too long to start exiting from production curbs causing the market to overtighten
and oil consumption has grown much faster than most analysts forecast at the start of the year while many sources of supply have risen more slowly than expected
despite communications between policymakers in the united states saudi arabia and russia to synchronise output increases with the of sanctions there seem to have been a series of misunderstandings
policymakers appear to have misjudged how quickly the united states would try to cut iran s exports and how rapidly other opec and producers could fill the gap
sensing the market is moving into a cyclical period of and low spare capacity hedge funds and other money managers have built bullish long positions accelerating and exaggerating the price adjustment
the oil market has become locked in an upward price trend as hedge funds and market makers all try to maintain neutral or long positions and few speculative players are willing to take the short side of the market
hedge funds and other money managers have accumulated bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices amounting to almost billion barrels of oil
at the same time the number of short positions in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts has fallen to its lowest level since before
the imbalance between bullish and bearish positions is close to a record an analysis of regulatory and exchange data showed
lopsided positioning has often been the precursor to a sharp reversal in the price trend when fund managers attempt to realise profits by closing some positions
the impact of lopsided positioning on the evolution of prices has been explored by researchers including the physicist didier sornette why stock markets crash critical events in complex financial systems
but while lopsided positioning is a key signal for a future price reversal it does not indicate how quickly that reversal will take place and at what price level it will occur
in oil prices continued trending higher for some months even as analysts warned they had become unsustainable
oil prices tend to overshoot on the upside and just as they have done on the downside and before correcting
typically prices peak only once there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth opec producers come under intense political pressure to increase production
in the meantime oil prices have risen to a level that is sending a strong signal to consumers about the need to increase efficiency reduce use and switch to alternative fuels
