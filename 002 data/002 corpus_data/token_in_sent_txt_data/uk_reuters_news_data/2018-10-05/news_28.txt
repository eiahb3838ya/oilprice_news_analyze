global markets-the pre-payrolls calm after another mini-storm
worlds stocks sag after heavy on thursday investors await jobs data for sept due later on friday treasury yields rise to highs yield curve steepen junk bond spread over treasuries narrowest since oil prices hover at high graphic world fx rates in by marc jones london oct reuters world markets steadied ahead of jobs numbers on friday as a high in oil prices and the biggest weekly jump in treasury yields since february left investors wondering where to go next
the usual drop in activity ahead of the monthly payrolls couldn t prevent europe s main bourses following asia into the red but it wasn t the deep shade of crimson of the previous day
lingering worries about italy s finances pushed milan down percent while london s ftse frankfurt s dax and the cac in paris were off percent and wall street futures were modestly weaker
it was the bond and currency markets though where the attention was really trained
the dollar barely budged against its main sparring partners the euro and the japanese yen after testing a high but rising bond yields which drive the global cost of borrowing were causing a headache again
benchmark treasury yields were at a top and on their way to their biggest weekly yield rise since february while european yields were adding to their biggest rise in months as well
and with talk of plenty more interest rate hikes growing louder it put all the more focus on the jobs data later
eaton vance portfolio manager justin bourgette said though there was too much hype around the payrolls figures whichever way you approach it the labour market is currently super strong
the latest reuters poll sees new jobs and average hourly earnings increasing percent in september after leaping percent in august
whatever the fed s concept of the neutral interest rate is it must be rising bourgette said
and it is going to be trial and error to some degree on how high rates go because you just don t know where the choking point tied in with the rise in borrowing costs has been the latest spike in oil prices as energy costs tend to have an outsized impact on inflation which is what most major central banks focus on when setting interest rates
brent crude futures gained percent to barrel and crude rose percent to barrel
that kept both just under highs
they have also risen an staggering percent since
iranian exports could fall below million barrels per day in november bank jefferies said referring to looming sanctions on tehran
the investment bank said there was enough oil to meet demand but global spare capacity is dwindling to the lowest level that we can document meaning any further supply disruptions would be difficult for the market to manage and could lead to spiking crude oil prices
the painful combination of rising oil prices borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets which tend to be vulnerable to all three
msci s emerging market equity index was down percent and headed for its worst week since february and plenty of currencies were carrying heavy losses too
the indian rupee fell to new record low after the central bank kept its interest rates on hold
the rupee has been hammered by higher oil prices and is the worst performer in asia this year
indian stocks also fell for a third straight session dragged down by energy firms a day after the government announced a cut in fuel prices
that cut sparked fears of the country going back towards the regulated regime where the prices of diesel and petrol were controlled by the government
petrol prices were regulated until while diesel prices remained so until
in general what s driving emerging market weakness is a stronger economy there is a lack of clarity on the effectiveness of rate hikes as a currency defence said sunil sharma chief investment officer with sanctum wealth management
