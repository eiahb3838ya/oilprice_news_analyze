saudi crown prince says 'we did our job' on replacing iranian oil - bloomberg
dubai reuters saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman said the kingdom has met its promise to washington to make up for iranian crude oil supplies lost through sanctions
the request that america made to saudi arabia and other opec countries is to be sure that if there is any loss of supply from iran that we will supply that
and that happened prince mohammed told bloomberg on friday
iran reduced their exports by barrels a day if i m not mistaken
and saudi arabia and opec and countries they ve produced million barrels a day
so we export as much as barrels for any barrel that disappeared from iran recently
so we did our job and russia and saudi arabia struck a private deal in september to raise oil output to cool rising prices and informed the united states before a meeting in algiers with other producers reuters reported this week
president donald trump has blamed the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec for high crude prices and called on it to boost output to bring down fuel costs before the congressional elections on
benchmark brent oil rallied above this week mainly stemming from a decline in oil exports from opec member iran due to fresh sanctions
it settled at a barrel on friday
iran opec s producer has accused trump of orchestrating the oil price rally by imposing sanctions on tehran and accused its regional saudi arabia of bowing to pressure
saudi arabia is the world s top oil exporter and opec s leader
the saudi crown prince said the recent rise in oil prices was not due to iran
we believe the higher price that we have in the last month it s not because of iran
it s mostly because of things happening in canada and mexico libya venezuela and other countries that moved the price a little bit higher he told bloomberg
but iran definitely no
because they reduced barrels and we ve exported more than million barrels a saudi arabic is now pumping about million barrels per day and can add a further million bpd of production if the market needed that prince mohammed said
we have spare capacity of million without any investment and with other opec countries and countries we believe we have more than that a little bit more than that he said
of course there is opportunity for investment in the next three to five saudi arabia is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity on hand to supply the market if needed
the kingdom has a maximum sustainable capacity of million bpd
prince mohammed also said he hoped to resume oil production from the neutral zone which saudi arabia shares with kuwait after resolving pending issues between the two gulf opec allies
we believe that we are almost close to having something with kuwait
there are only small issues that have been stuck there for the last years
the kuwaiti side they want to fix it today before we continue to produce in that area he said
we re trying to have an agreement with the kuwaitis to continue to produce for the next five to years and at the same time we work on the sovereignty the crown prince flew to kuwait on sunday to discuss the resumption of oil output from the neutral zone a source familiar with the matter had told reuters
the resumption of the neutral zone s oilfields could add up to bpd of oil output capacity to saudi arabia and kuwait
