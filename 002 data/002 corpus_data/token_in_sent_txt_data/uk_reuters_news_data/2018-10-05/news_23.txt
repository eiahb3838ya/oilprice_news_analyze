german environment ministry won't accept carmakers rejection of diesel plan
berlin reuters germany s environment ministry will try to overcome resistance from carmakers to fitting older diesel cars with expensive new exhaust filtering systems as politicians and carmakers scramble to avoid outright bans on vehicles
german carmakers and politicians were forced to hash out a compromise deal to cut pollution this week after environmental groups won a key victory in february which allowed cities to ban older diesel cars
carmakers are now scrambling to avert bans while seeking to avoid costly of old cars as a way to cut nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate pollution levels in cities
volkswagen on friday reiterated it would back retrofits as the hardware fixes are known and offer to shoulder percent of the costs but only on the condition that other carmakers would do the same
bmw and peugeot have said they don t see them as a viable solution
that statement refers to the early reactions of bmw or the vda automotive industry association
that can not be the end of it the environment ministry spokesman said in a regular government news conference
the issue is an urgent one
authorities in berlin are looking at imposing bans on older diesel cars on streets including major routes in the german capital local broadcaster rbb said on friday
a ban is due to take effect in frankfurt germany s financial capital from february
the city of hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the emissions standard from selected trunk roads
bmw said on tuesday it did not see hardware retrofits for diesel vehicles as a sensible way for cities to quickly meet european union clean air rules
the time it takes to get new exhaust filters certified for roadworthiness means retrofits take longer to implement than immediate incentives which allow clients to buy lower polluting cars bmw said
carlos tavares the chief executive of france s psa group said the retrofit approach doesn t work because carmakers would balk at having to make a financial contribution toward rebuilding older cars
who s going to pay is not clear
we believe it s not the carmakers responsibility because at the time when those cars were sold they met all legal requirements carlos tavares told reuters at the paris motor show
bmw said it would offer a incentive of euros in the most polluted parts of the country
