pertamina discontinues lng terminal project, seen as unfeasible
jakarta july reuters indonesia s state owned energy holding company pertamina has decided not to go ahead with what would have been the country s second receiving terminal for liquefied natural gas lng its chief executive said on monday
indonesia has forecast sharp increases in gas demand after but increases in domestic consumption of the fuel have been hampered by an abundance of cheap coal and sluggish development of gas infrastructure
today we are not going ahead because it is not yet feasible to continue pertamina acting ceo nicke widyawati told reporters referring to the project that would have been built in bojonegara not far from jakarta
the terminal valued at up to million was to be developed in a joint venture between kalla group unit bumi sarana migas and pertamina with financing from the japan bank for international cooperation jbic
the terminal was to be designed by the engineering unit of tokyo gas co ltd and was expected to come onstream in
gas demand has declined so it s not feasible from a business standpoint widyawati added noting that if gas demand for power generation increased the decision to halt the project may be reviewed
