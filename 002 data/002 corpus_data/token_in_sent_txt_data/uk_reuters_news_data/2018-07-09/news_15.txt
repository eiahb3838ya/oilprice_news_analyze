update 1-suncor's syncrude to resume some output in july, full ops in sept
adds price stock impact by john benny july reuters suncor energy inc said on monday its syncrude oil sands project in western canada will resume some production in july sooner than expected and hit full capacity in september following an outage last month that disrupted total output
the disruption at syncrude representing percent of canadian oil production has tightened canadian supplies and reduced the crude flow to cushing oklahoma the delivery point of the crude futures contract
suncor the biggest stakeholder in the northern alberta project said an early investigation showed the cause of disruption was a transformer trip
syncrude can produce up to barrels per day of crude oil and had been expected to remain down through july
but suncor said one of its coker drums which produces about bpd would return to service during the second half of july
a second one which has an output of about bpd is expected to return to service in the first half of august
coker units convert mined bitumen from the oil sands into synthetic crude oil
suncor expects pipeline shipments from its syncrude oil sands project to be about percent to percent of total capacity in august
western canada select wcs heavy crude trades at a discount to west texas intermediate light oil wti the north american benchmark in part because of difficulties transporting crude through clogged pipelines from alberta to refineries
traders reduced that discount for three consecutive days last week as haywood securities research predicted a longer schedule that would ease pipeline congestion
the discount was little changed in early trading on monday according to shorcan energy brokers
wti crude futures eased percent to per barrel
the outage will cost syncrude about bpd in lost production in the third quarter which translates to about percent utilization altacorp analysts wrote in a note
we view the update as slightly negative as the project is expected to return to normal operations after the acceleration of planned maintenance resulting in a longer outage than originally anticipated they added
suncor is expected to report the ongoing quarter s results on july
the company s toronto shares dipped percent at c in morning trade on monday
imperial oil ltd which is majority owned by exxon mobil corp and china s sinopec have also invested in the project
