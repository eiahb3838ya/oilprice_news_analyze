the sale is part of a broad change of guard in the aging north sea where veteran players are seeking to dispose of older fields with declining production while new nimbler companies believe they can squeeze out more value

royal dutch shell and bp have also sold a large number of fields in recent years
the laggan tormore gas field in which total now has percent started production in february and can produce up to barrels of oil equivalent per day
any deal for the bruce and keith fields is likely to be complicated however

without a waiver the field will have to shut down leaving bruce and keith holding little value the sources said
