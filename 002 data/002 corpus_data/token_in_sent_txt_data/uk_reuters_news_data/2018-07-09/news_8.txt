mexico city reuters mexico s leftist andres manuel lopez obrador said on monday that fuel prices would begin to come down in three years once domestic fuel output starts to rise thanks to refinery improvements and a planned new refinery
lopez obrador who won by a landslide in the july election and takes office on said in a press conference after meeting with industry leaders that there would be no sharp rises in fuel prices during the first half of his term and that they would rise only in line with inflation
after three years by which time we will have fuel production in mexico because we re going to rehabilitate the six refineries and build one so we can stop buying fuel abroad we will have lowered prices he said
