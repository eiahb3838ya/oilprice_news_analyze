california regulator sees 'window' for deal on fuel economy rules
new york reuters california is ready to work with major automakers on revisions to greenhouse gas emission vehicle rules through and sees a window for a deal in the coming months the state s top clean air regulator told reuters on monday
air resources board chair mary nichols said in an interview on monday that agreements with the federal government or automakers could be struck in the coming months as the state pursues its own changes to fuel economy standards through
if the car companies want to come and talk to us they will nichols said
california s effort could potentially putting pressure on the trump administration to back a compromise instead of its own plans to rollback federal vehicle emissions rules
i feel like there is enough at stake here for the auto industry that we may be able to get the federal government to back off on the extreme proposals that they have made nichols said
the transportation department in may submitted a proposal to the white house recommending freezing fuel economy standards at levels through and would bar california from setting stricter standards than the federal government
that proposal developed in tandem with the environmental protection agency is expected to be made public as early as next week
california has vowed to fight a federal freeze in court which could leave automakers in regulatory limbo for years as litigation grinds through the courts
there is also the possibility of this all getting settled amicably and there is really a window of time to do that nichols said
she suggested the time frame between august when the state proposes changes to its rules and sometime in september when the federal government closes a public comment period on its proposal
the current federal rules negotiated with automakers by former president barack obama s administration in aimed to double average fuel efficiency to about miles per gallon by and they included significant annual increases in automaker requirements
automakers now want changes citing lower gasoline prices and a shift in consumer preferences to larger vehicles
california agreed to adopt the obama administration s fuel rules in but can insist automakers follow tougher rules if the trump administration weakens requirements nichols said
nichols said california plans to propose changes to its rules through in and the state may propose ways to make it easier for automakers to comply
nichols said the state has been at a bit of an impasse with the trump administration which has not held substantive talks with california she said
california and other states in may filed suit to challenge the administration s decision to reconsider the vehicle efficiency rules
gloria bergquist a spokesman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers a group representing general motors co volkswagen ag toyota motor corp and others said monday automakers believe one national program is better for our customers who don t want to face higher vehicle prices from redundant duplicative government regulations so we urge the federal government and california to come to an nichols said automakers should get involved if they want to strike a deal to avoid years of litigation
the based companies are mostly hiding under their desks at the moment waiting for something to happen nichols said
federal regulators have declined to comment on their proposal until it is made public
the transportation department and environmental protection agency did not immediately comment
