column-could saudi arabia replace all the barrels lost from iran sanctions? kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london july reuters the united states wants to eliminate all iran s crude oil exports from november and is relying on saudi arabia and other opec and members to fill the gap in supplies
our goal is to increase pressure on the iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue from crude oil sales a senior state department official told a news briefing this month
we are working to minimise disruptions to the global market but we are confident that there is sufficient global spare oil production capacity brian hook the director of policy planning said on july
we are not looking to grant licences or waivers broadly on the of sanctions because we believe pressure is critical to achieve our national security but if the united states succeeds in reducing iran s crude exports close to zero from november in line with its stated policy saudi arabia would have to raise its production to unprecedented levels to cover the loss
and it would leave the global market tighter than at any time since the oil shocks of and with resulting upward pressure on prices
the administration has not been clear about whether sanctions will apply just to crude or will include condensates briefing with an iran diplomacy update state department july
but assuming sanctions apply only to crude the global market would still need to replace more than million barrels per day bpd of iranian exports from the start of november
according to the latest information from the joint organisations data initiative jodi iran exported between million and million bpd of crude between january and april
the question is where will the replacement barrels come from
the international energy agency estimates opec members held million bpd of spare capacity at the end of may while their allies had no more than bpd oil market report iea june
saudi arabia accounted for almost of the reported opec spare capacity million bpd with smaller volumes held by iraq bpd united arab emirates bpd and kuwait bpd
russia accounted for most of the spare capacity roughly bpd with little or no available spare capacity in the other allies
other agencies and market analysts put the spare capacity figures for opec and members significantly lower than the iea which implies the market is even tighter
but using the iea s figures it is clear saudi arabia would have to replace most of the iranian barrels lost as a result of sanctions
the kingdom would need to increase production and exports by at least million bpd to cover the total loss of iranian barrels
the required increase would be even higher if other opec and countries struggle to raise their output or more production is lost as a result of problems in venezuela and libya
in theory there is sufficient spare capacity in saudi arabia and other countries but it would leave the global market with less than million bpd of capacity left to meet all other contingencies
in practice some analysts think the market could be much tighter with sanctions essentially using up all the spare capacity worldwide
the iea estimates saudi arabia could raise production to just over million bpd and sustain it at that level for an extended period
saudi arabia has already used some of its spare capacity to increase production by bpd from million bpd in may to million bpd in june
the figures were contained in a communication from the kingdom to the organization of the petroleum exporting countries saudi arabia raised oil output by around bpd in june reuters july
but according to the energy information administration the kingdom has not produced more than million bpd on an annual basis or million bpd in a single month july in the last years
saudi arabia has reported roughly similar production numbers to jodi with output peaking at million bpd in november
it is possible the kingdom could lift production by another million bpd beyond anything it has ever produced before but at the moment there is no way of knowing for certain
some observers question whether such high rates of production could be implemented quickly and sustained for any length of time
maximum production would require opening the chokes on existing wells and bringing previously wells back into service
boosting production this way might risk a decline in oilfield pressure that could result in damage to the reservoirs
some spare capacity might require drilling new wells within existing fields in which case it is not strictly speaking spare capacity at all
and it is not clear whether the pipelines processing plants and export terminals have enough capacity to handle million bpd because such high flow rates have never been tested
saudi arabia could boost volumes supplied to the market by releasing some of its domestic crude stocks as well as raising field production but stock releases would only ever be a measure
domestic crude stocks have already fallen by million barrels since their peak in october according to government data submitted to the jodi
domestic stocks had been drawn down to million barrels at the end of april the lowest level since november
most of the remaining inventories are required for operational reasons including as feedstock for the country s growing refinery capacity as well as ensuring smooth flow of oil from the fields onto tankers
if saudi arabia needs to replace iranian barrels most of the increase will have to come from more pumping rather than stock releases and it would require producing more oil than saudi arabia has ever pumped before
stringent sanctions on iran will take both saudi arabia and the oil market into the unknown
