aeroflot in talks to expand a350 jet order - sources
july reuters russia s aeroflot is in negotiations to conclude an expanded order for up to airbus passenger jets worth billion at list prices two industry sources said
the deal would double an order for aircraft that has been on airbus s books for almost a decade without being fulfilled as the airline went through economic upheavals
aeroflot and airbus declined to comment
in russia s biggest airline ordered including of the baseline version and eight of the smaller which airbus later withdrew due to weak demand
also that year aeroflot signed a contract for boeing dreamliners but later said it had cancelled the order
the deal however remains on boeing s catalogue of unfilled orders indicating the contract has not been formally severed
russian aviation market conditions were particularly challenging in and after sanctions by the united states and europe along with weak oil prices hit the russian economy and the rouble hammering consumer demand
demand started to recover along with the economy and aeroflot has benefited from its scale and the bankruptcies of russian carriers transaero in and vim airlines this year
one of the sources said aeroflot was now discussing doubling the unfulfilled order to aircraft
another predicted a total order for airplanes
aeroflot recently reported a net loss of billion roubles million as fuel and staff costs outweighed revenue growth
the carrier however said it would set more ambitious strategic goals having achieved its ambitions to become a airline globally and european airline ahead of schedule
aeroflot sees transit passengers between europe and asia as well as its subsidiary pobeda as key growth drivers
