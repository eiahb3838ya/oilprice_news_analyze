libya's oil output more than halved since february -noc
tunis july reuters libya s national oil production fell to barrels per day bpd from a high of million bpd in february following recent oil port closures the head of the national oil corporation noc said in a statement on monday
the noc had not previously stated how high the country s production had climbed after partially recovering to more than million bpd a year ago
in the video statement dated july the chairman of noc mustafa sanalla said the closure of the el feel oilfield due to protests led to the loss of bpd but output had subsequently remained around million bpd
last month it dropped sharply when an armed attack against forces loyal to commander khalifa haftar at the oil export ports of ras lanuf and es sider shut both terminals down
after haftar s libyan national army lna repelled the attack a week later it announced it would hand the ports and fields in the east to a parallel noc
ras lanuf and es sider have remained shut and tankers booked by the noc in tripoli which is recognised internationally as the sole producer and seller of libyan oil have been unable to load
our production today is bpd
tomorrow it will be less and the day after tomorrow less again
and we are going lower sanalla said
the noc had previously estimated the production loss from the stoppage at bpd or million in daily revenue
opec member libya was pumping million bpd or more before conflict blockades and political splits slashed output from
