update 2-europe grid operators act to fix lag, urge solution
sarajevo reuters europe s power grid operators group said on monday it had started a compensation scheme to limit a frequency deviation originating from a power grid row between serbia and its former province kosovo which has again slowed some of europe s clocks
the european network of transmission system operators for electricity grouping grid operators from countries said digital clocks across europe that use mains frequency to keep time such as those on microwaves and clock radios have fallen behind by one minute due to a drop in frequency on continental europe s transmission network
the body urged serbia and kosovo to quickly resolve the problem which earlier this year slowed those clocks by as much as six minutes
with the warmer weather in europe power demand across the continent could rise and the frequency deviation may widen
drops of frequency happen and solidarity mechanisms exist but the issue is new spokeswoman claire camus said in an emailed response to questions from reuters calling it a political issue that demanded a political solution
camus said the compensation scheme launched by continental european transmission system operators would limit the delay to below seconds
if it is proven that there is deliberate unwillingness from both parties to solve the situation sanctions can be looked at but so far there is no such proof she added
to lessen the impact on consumers european grid operators agreed in march to inject missing electricity into the joint network and to restore the frequency
but the operators agreed they would not tolerate a grid time deviation of more than seconds
ems blamed kosovo for withdrawing in an unauthorised manner uncontracted electricity from the synchronised european grid
ems will remain in contact with seeking a solution to the problem ems said adding that prior to any decision about possible sanctions all the facts and responsibility had to established
kosovan grid operator kostt was not available to comment
it aims to become an member but serbia has been obstructing these efforts
the dispute over regulatory issues and grid operation is further complicated by belgrade s refusal to recognise kosovo which seceded from serbia in
some serbs in the north of kosovo do not pay their electricity bills to the kosovo authorities
their bills used to be paid by the rest of kosovo s population until the country s energy regulator ended that practice leaving its grid operator kostt without the financial means to buy the energy needed to cover usage in the north
because this energy is not injected in the interconnected continental european system frequency drops slightly creating a grid time deviation
the european union is mediating in the dispute which includes the implementation of the connection agreement between kostt and continental europe camus said
but the serbian authorities set as a the creation of an association of serb municipalities in kosovo and this is not acceptable to the kosovo authorities she added
