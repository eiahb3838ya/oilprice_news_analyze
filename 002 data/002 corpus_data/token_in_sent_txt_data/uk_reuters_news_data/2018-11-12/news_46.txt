update 2-saudi's falih says analysis shows need for 1 mln bpd cut in oil output
falih we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market oil prices set for largest increase in a month falih sanctions removed less iranian oil than expected adds quotes oil price by maha el dahan and tuqa khalid abu dhabi nov reuters saudi energy minister khalid said on monday opec and its allies agree that technical analysis shows a need to cut oil supply next year by around million barrels per day bpd from october levels to balance the market
speaking at an industry event in abu dhabi he said demand from saudi arabia s customers in december would fall by more than half a million bpd compared with november and there was a consensus not to allow oil inventory to build up
oil prices rose more than percent on monday set for their largest increase in a month after the saudi comments
if all things remain equal and they almost certainly will not as things will change it is a dynamic market then the technical analysis we saw yesterday tells us that there will need to be a reduction of supply from october levels approaching a million barrels falih said
the consensus is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market
if that means trimming supplies by a million bpd we sanctions against iran had removed less oil than expected from the market falih said
washington has granted exemptions to iran s biggest buyers
sanctions didn t cut so much out of the market as anticipated falih said
opec and its allies including russia decided in june to relax output curbs in place since after pressure from president donald trump to reduce oil prices and make up for supply losses from iran
oil prices have since come under downward pressure from rising supplies despite the new sanctions on iran
forecasts of a supply surplus and slowing demand have also dented the market
falih said saudi arabia was not preparing for a breakup of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and believed the group would long remain the global central bank for oil
saudi arabia s top has been studying the possible effects on oil markets of a breakup of opec the wall street journal reported on thursday citing people familiar with the matter
falih said the was just trying to think outside the box and analyse all scenarios
opec is essential for the stability of oil markets he said
on sunday falih had announced plans by saudi arabia to reduce oil supply to world markets by bpd in december as the country faces uncertain prospects in getting other producers to agree to a coordinated output cut
falih told reporters that state oil company saudi aramco s customer nominations would fall by bpd in december versus november due to seasonal lower demand
the cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about percent
