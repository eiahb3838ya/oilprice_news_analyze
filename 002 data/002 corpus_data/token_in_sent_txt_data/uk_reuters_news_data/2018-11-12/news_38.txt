update 2-iranian military is ready to protect oil tankers against threats-deputy commander
dubai reuters iran s armed forces will protect iranian oil tankers against any threats an iranian military official said on monday after the united states called the ships a floating liability and warned ports operators not to allow them to dock
the united states resumed sanctions on iran s oil shipping and banking industries last monday after president donald trump pulled out of a international agreement curbing iran s nuclear programme in may
iran s armed forces are prepared today as in the past to protect our fleet of oil tankers against any threats so that it can continue to use marine waterways said mahmoud mousavi a deputy commander of the regular armed forces according to the news agency isna
his comments appeared to be a response to special representative for iran brian hook who said last week that iranian vessels would lose access to international insurance markets under the sanctions and so would be a risk to ports and canals which allowed them access
from the suez canal to the strait of malacca and all in between iranian tankers are a floating liability hook had said
iranian media reported his remarks as a threat against iranian tankers that carry iran s crude and oil products
mousavi said that creating hindrances to transportation through international waterways would be unacceptable
iran s armed forces have the preparedness to protect our commercial fleet as they have in the past years he said
hook also raised the possibility that countries and port operators could face penalties for facilitating what he called iran s illicit activities if they allowed iranian ships access to international waterways and port facilities
mohammad rastad head of iran s ports and maritime organization said tehran would file a complaint next week to the international maritime organization over cruel sanctions and restrictions on maritime transport according to the state news agency irna
hook had also said the sanctions had already cost iran billions of dollars in oil revenue since may but iranian eshaq jahangiri said iran had sold as much oil as it needed to
iran has one of the world s biggest tanker fleets but many of the ships are ageing and require valid insurance testing inspection and certification known as ship classification to be able to ply international waters again
iranian officials have threatened to block the strait of hormuz a major oil shipping route if the united states attempts to stop the islamic republic s oil exports
