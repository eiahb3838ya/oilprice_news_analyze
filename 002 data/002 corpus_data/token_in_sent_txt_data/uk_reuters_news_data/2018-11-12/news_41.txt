rpt-oil pucks and pellets; canada eyes new ways to move stranded crude
repeats to additional subscribers by rod nickel calgary alberta nov reuters canada s biggest railroad says it is attracting interest from oil producers in its effort to move crude in solid form as clogged pipelines divert more oil to riskier rail transport
congested pipelines have stranded much of canada s crude in alberta driving discounts to levels
canadian heavy crude traded on friday for less than of the benchmark light oil price
the latest blow to the sector landed on thursday when a court ruled construction must stop on transcanada corp s keystone xl pipeline
pipeline pressure has pushed more crude onto trains owned by canadian national railway co and smaller rival canadian pacific railway limited
but crude movement by rail is costly and prone to spills and sometimes disastrous accidents such as the derailment at lac megantic quebec that killed dozens of people
enter cn s patented canapux product which is solidified crude encased in plastic named to evoke the country s most popular sport hockey
the railroad argues that solid crude never before commercially shipped in the world can be transported more cheaply efficiently and with less environmental risk than liquid crude in tank cars
since it floats canapux is easier to recover from a spill into a water body
interest from crude producers buyers and transport companies picked up after a canadian court in august overturned ottawa s approval for the trans mountain oil pipeline expansion said james cairns cn s of petroleum and chemicals
there have been a lot more discussions about how do we get this done cairns said
conversations are much more advanced than they cn is seeking commercial partners to build a pilot plant that will process barrels per day of undiluted heavy crude into canapux
the plant to be built either at the alberta crude storage hub around edmonton or on an oil producer s site is estimated to cost less than c million million
it could be running as soon as cairns said
cn s oil pucks would move in gondola cars which weigh less than tank cars allowing the railroad to load them with more crude
they also do not require diluent an oil that is mixed with crude when it is shipped in liquid form by rail or pipeline
as a result canapux shipping costs would knock off nearly half the expense of rail transportation in liquid form according to cn
other entrepreneurs have pursued similar ideas for several years from blobs to pellets
alberta inventor cal broder said two refineries in china are interested in his bitcrude product which he intends to produce from bitumen
he plans a test shipment of several containers of his crude to asia before
both bitcrude and canapux still require government regulatory approvals
success of either product also hinges on convincing oil refineries to make changes needed to convert solid crude back to liquid for processing
but the idea of shipping crude in solid form is compelling said alex pourbaix chief executive of cenovus energy a major canadian shipper of crude by rail
i am quite intrigued by those technologies he said in an interview
we re going to make sure we take a hard look at them canadian dollars reporting by rod nickel in calgary alberta editing by dan grebler
