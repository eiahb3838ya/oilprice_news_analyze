india to lease out half of padur strategic oil storage to adnoc - sources
new nov reuters india plans to lease out half of its padur strategic oil reserve site in southern india to abu dhabi national oil adnoc for storing crude sources said
indian strategic petroleum reserves ltd isprl will sign an initial agreement with adnoc on monday in the presence of oil minister dharmendra pradhan three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said
the agreement will allow adnoc to sell oil to local refiners but give the government of india the first right to the oil in the case of an emergency
it will be the second such deal with adnoc which is already storing oil at the mangalore strategic storage in southern karnataka state
we will sign a memorandum of understanding with adnoc to fill two compartments in padur along the same lines as the mangalore cavern said one source with direct knowledge of the matter declining to be named ahead of an official statement
in return for allowing adnoc to store its crude at a strategic reserve site india does not have to pay for the imports only accessing the oil in emergencies
india s oil ministry and isprl a government entity that builds the caverns did not respond to reuters request for comments
an adnoc spokesman said we are already working with india s isprl in mangalore and we hope to build on this positive working relationship in the india s cabinet last week approved a plan allowing foreign oil companies to store oil in padur s strategic storage
participation by foreign oil companies will significantly reduce budgetary support of government of india by more than billion rupees billion based on current prices law minister prasad told a news conference last week
the padur site is located about km miles from the southwest coast and km from mangalore refinery and petrochemicals ltd s refinery
india relies heavily on oil imports which account for about percent of its total demand
to protect itself from potential supply disruptions it has built emergency storage in underground caverns at three locations with a capacity to hold million barrels of crude or about days of its average daily demand
