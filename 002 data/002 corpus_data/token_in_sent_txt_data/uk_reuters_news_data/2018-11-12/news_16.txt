update 2-u.s. plans new limits on heavy-duty truck emissions
washington reuters the environmental protection agency will announce plans to propose new rules to significantly decrease emissions of nitrogen oxide from trucks an agency official said
industry groups and state environmental officials have urged the epa to set new nationwide rules as the state of california has been moving forward with plans to set new state emissions limits
california also wants nationwide rules in part because more than half of all trucks delivering goods in the state are registered in other states
the epa said in a statement it had scheduled a formal announcement on tuesday with industry executives and state environmental officials regarding its cleaner trucks initiative but did not immediately disclose details
the effort to impose a new regulatory limit by the epa comes as the trump administration has generally touted its efforts to eliminate regulations
but the effort on nitrogen oxide nox is backed by industry which wants to avoid a patchwork of federal and state standards the official said
the official asked not to be identified because the announcement was still pending
in december the epa said in response to petitions to impose new standards that it acknowledged a need for additional nox reductions from engines particularly in areas of the country with elevated levels of air pollution and said it planned to propose new rules that could begin in the model year
local and state air quality and other agencies including new york city new hampshire rhode island los angeles washington state had petitioned for the rules
another administration official said monday the new proposed emissions rules may not be written and announced until
nitrogen oxide emissions are linked to significant health impacts and can exacerbate asthma attacks the epa has said
the current truck rules for nox were adopted in and took effect over the following decade
in the aftermath of volkswagen ag s diesel emissions scandal in which the german automaker admitted to secretly using software to evade emissions rules the epa has taken steps to insure that diesel cars and suvs are meeting emissions requirements in use
the new nox truck rules may also include new tests or other regulatory steps to ensure that vehicles and their engines are complying during driving the official said
