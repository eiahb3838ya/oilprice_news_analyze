finance for electricity access too little, too dirty - energy body
barcelona nov thomson reuters foundation finance to provide electric power to nearly billion people who live without it is rising but too slowly to meet a global goal to reach everyone by an international body said on monday
meanwhile funding to expand cleaner more cooking has declined sustainable energy for all seforall said in a report that compared financing levels in and with the preceding period
in countries that are home to of those who lack access to power electrification finance rose by percent to an average of about billion per year in
but that is still far below the billion needed each year the report said
and more than a quarter of the annual investment in and or billion per year was for fossil fuel plants double spending on them in something the global community may be concerned to note it added
china provided a fifth of that expansion money
seforall ceo rachel kyte who is also special representative of the for energy access said the funding uptick for electric power was nowhere near sufficient for us to reach the goal or to meet the needs or to make these communities resilient in the face of climate change impacts
in seven developing countries including nigeria malawi sudan and afghanistan investment in electrification dropped by percent or more in and compared to with africa as a whole receiving less money
india the philippines bangladesh and kenya garnered percent of investment in for expansion of electricity access among the countries studied
within that the same four received the most money for new power plants which often do not help the poorest where they are not connected to the power grid the report said
the benefits fossil fuel plants may bring in terms of energy access are countered by the negative impacts on human health and their contributions to global climate change it said
the study looked at both international and domestic sources of funding averaged over two years
the research highlighted the tiny fraction of funding going into renewable electricity including solar
a growing number of policy makers and experts view such systems as the fastest and most way to boost electricity access it said
annual investment in electricity rose to an average of million in both and from million per year in and but that investment accounted for just percent of the total finance tracked the report said
kyte told the thomson reuters foundation the figures pointed to an of how important is going to be for these countries
she urged development banks to focus more on decentralised clean energy when helping countries expand power supplies
last week close to environment and groups based in africa and beyond sent an open letter to the african development bank afdb urging it to step up financial support for clean energy access on the continent
after launching a new deal on energy for africa in the bank s financing for and power rose to percent of its energy project approvals for from less than percent in the two years before the letter noted
under the new deal a partnership that aims to achieve universal access to electricity in africa by the afdb has committed to invest about billion between and while leveraging up to billion in
but the civil society letter cited new data from the international energy agency estimating that as africa s population grows million of its people will still lack access to electricity in mainly in rural areas unless there are major changes to the status quo
seforall s kyte said development banks were also failing to get to grips with the massive need for cleaner cooking despite some states such as rwanda and indonesia ramping up efforts to wean people off polluting fuels like kerosene and charcoal
nearly billion people around the world still cook with dirty fuels that cause indoor air pollution responsible for over million deaths a year especially among women and children
yet funding to catalyse a switch to cleaner cooking methods and heat sources remains abysmally low dropping percent to million per year in the seforall report said
there is something profoundly off in the way we are approaching this kyte said
the best way to boost clean energy access overall is for governments to put in place supportive policies and to develop their capital markets to entice investment but many still require international assistance to make that happen she noted
