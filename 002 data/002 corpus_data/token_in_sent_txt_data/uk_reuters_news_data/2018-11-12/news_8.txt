russian bank offers 1 bln rouble ($15 mln) bet to back denial of rosneft financing deal
moscow reuters russian state bank vtb on monday challenged media to a bet of billion roubles million pounds over what it said were incorrect reports it provided a loan to finance the sale of a stake in rosneft to qatar s sovereign wealth fund
citing nine sources reuters on friday exclusively reported that vtb had provided around billion to the qatari fund qia for the billion euro deal in in which a percent stake in rosneft was sold to qia and commodity trader glencore
vtb said it did not issue a loan to the qia
a reuters spokesman said we stand by our vtb said in a statement on monday it had repeatedly said that it had not granted a loan to qia to buy rosneft shares
to resolve this dispute we suggest that media outlets disseminating this information enter into legally binding agreements with vtb if their claims are incorrect each of them will pay rub to vtb bank through a transfer to our account the bank said in its statement
vtb group would like to once again state and emphasize that since it has not granted any loans to the qia did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the nine sources who told reuters about the vtb loan to qatar included a source close to vtb management a russian central bank official and a russian government source familiar with foreign investments in russia
at least four of the sources were directly involved in preparations for the loan
all the sources requested anonymity because they are not authorised to discuss the deal
