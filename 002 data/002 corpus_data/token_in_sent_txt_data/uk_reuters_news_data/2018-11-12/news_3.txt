lebanon approves extra-budgetary fuel spending to avert blackouts
beirut reuters lebanon s parliament on monday approved over million million in spending on power station fuel avoiding a new electricity supply crisis but adding to a gaping budget deficit
with no sign of a final deal to form a national unity government led by prime saad six months after elections parliament began a legislative session on monday to process urgent laws
last week algerian oil company sonatrach agreed to unload fuel needed to avoid more power cuts on the promise that parliament would meet this week and authorise payment from the finance ministry
finance minister hassan ali khalil had said he was unwilling to implement spending without parliamentary approval
lebanon has the world s third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy and stagnant growth
it is in dire need of a government able to make economic reforms including to the power sector that are seen as more pressing than ever
khalil said subsidised state power provider electricite du liban edl needed an extra billion lebanese pounds million above the billion allocated in the budget to cover fuel needs for the rest of the year
lebanon has suffered chronic daily power shortages of between three and hours since the end of the civil war in
those that can afford to pay for costly and polluting private sector generators to fill the supply gaps
an edl source on monday said the fuel had been unloaded
before the deal with sonatach was reached edl had begun reducing power production and had said it would have to gradually shut down power plants if a payment solution was not found
the number one task facing a new lebanese government is to reduce the twin budget and current account deficits and tackle the country s rising debt which the world bank estimates will be around percent of gdp by
the first step on this path should be reforming the electricity sector the world bank says describing edl subsidies as a staggering burden on national finances
last year the government spent billion on edl percent of primary expenditure
at a meeting of international donors in april in paris where more than billion of investment was pledged in return for reforms hariri promised to reduce the budget deficit as a percentage of gdp by five percent over five years
