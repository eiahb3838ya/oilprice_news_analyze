analysis-in race to fill lng supply gap, project goalposts have changed
london reuters the race is on for liquefied natural gas lng producers to build export terminals as demand soars but the criteria for financing such have shifted as traditional relationships with lng consumers have begun to disintegrate
royal dutch shell s final investment decision fid taken last month for a billion lng canada project was a shot in the arm for the lng industry which is emerging from almost three years of low prices and investment
as a vote of confidence in the lng market shell s decision is expected to get the ball rolling on a wave of approvals for dozens of similar projects around the world that have been planned for years but not yet finalized
but the fid represented a different financing structure unreliant on commitments from large buyers as previous had been such as the recently commissioned ichthys facility in australia or the sabine pass plant
instead shell will absorb the cost into its budget and will effectively worry about the ultimate buyers later as one of the largest corporate purchasers of lng in the world it can absorb the new volumes into its global portfolio
demand for lng is there it is expected almost to double to million tonnes a year mtpa by leaving room for plenty more export terminals despite an influx of fresh supply from new mostly terminals
but projects have struggled to find offtakers as the world s biggest buyers in japan and south korea seek nimbler terms while others such as india and pakistan are less creditworthy
projects that require buying commitments are really struggling to find buyers to sign up
i don t see a lot that is happening said vivek chandra chief executive of texas lng which plans a project of the same name
i don t know what the buyers are waiting for because the golden opportunity to sign up for deals was yesterday he told a conference this month referring to historically low lng prices in recent years before they began rising last winter
aside from mtpa of supply due from projects under construction new terminals like texas lng need fids
other plans dot the world from qatar s expansion to plants in russia and mozambique as well as southeast asia
of all these projects only a handful in the united states will ultimately be built and for others the ability for the operator to absorb lng into its portfolio will be key
the projects that we might see now are the ones that don t rely on offtake agreements said frank konertz lng analyst at s p global
irrespective of price offtake commitments are risky today because the global lng market is undergoing fundamental changes as it grows and increases liquidity
it needs to solve quandaries such as the pricing mechanism for lng traditionally linked to oil and absorb new technology that shifts the commercial calculations of trading the gas
the whole market is in an phase lng analyst emma richards at fitch solutions said
lng is becoming more akin to oil with greater spot and liquidity trading referencing benchmarks but it s a long process and it s creating partly as a result of these uncertainties and because the market is gaining liquidity the average duration of offtake deals has halved to less than eight years from almost years in with volumes per contract falling to mtpa from mtpa according to data from shell s lng outlook
crucially about percent of such contracts have no credit rating at all compared to percent in being or shell s outlook showed
shorter smaller less creditworthy contracts make financing projects simply more difficult
this makes projects by large portfolio players such as shell total and exxon which has promised fids in mozambique and texas next year easier to finalize
for projects the field is getting tighter qatar petroleum the world s largest exporter of lng said an fid for the golden pass project with exxon was due in the next few months
qatar s own huge expansion expected to get fid next year would increase capacity to mtpa from current production rates of mtpa
and some projects have become attractive in light of china s tariffs on lng imposed in the midst of a trade war
canadian projects in particular there are five planned will come at a cost to the gulf coast plans
for a lot of projects looking to sanction now it s a race against time konertz said
