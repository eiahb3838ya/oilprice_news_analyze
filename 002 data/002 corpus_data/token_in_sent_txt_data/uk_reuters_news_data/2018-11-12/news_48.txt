column-crude oil market completes u-turn as saudis signal price discontent: russell
launceston australia reuters what a difference a month can make
the crude oil market has gone from worrying about not having enough supply to fretting that prices are being overwhelmed by a glut
the main news from sunday s meeting of producers in abu dhabi is that saudi arabia is planning to cut the amount it supplies in december by barrels per day bpd from november levels
while saudi energy minister khalid said the reduction was because of a seasonal drop in demand it s not hard to read between the lines that the world s largest crude exporter is growing increasingly concerned about the decline in prices
having reached a high in early october brent crude has slid by about percent to close at a barrel on
it s no secret that the saudis and other producers in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and its allies would prefer crude prices to remain north of a barrel a level that they believe is sustainable
the elephant in the room for opec and its allies which include russia is president donald trump
part of the reason oil prices have retreated is producers responded to trump s pressure for more supply in order to compensate for the expected loss of iranian barrels with the of sanctions against tehran on
however the trump administration decided at the last minute to grant waivers to eight users of iranian crude including top buyers china and india
the waivers effectively kicked the can on iranian sanctions down the road
while the problem of how effective the sanctions will eventually be is still there it s not an issue for the short term
what is also uncertain is exactly how saudi arabia russia and other producers feel about the actions of the trump administration
the saudis agreed in the middle of the year to supply more crude to the market largely in response to twitter pressure from trump
they may now feel they ve been played by the president
trump may have succeeded in getting oil prices to decline with the iran waivers seemingly being the last straw for any bulls left in the market
but now the saudis have stepped in to try and prevent prices from falling further with brent gaining as much as percent in early asian trade on monday
that gain may not seem too impressive but it does mean that brent has avoided for now falling into the traditional definition of a bear market
it briefly touched the threshold of a percent decline during trade on but avoided closing in bear territory
if the saudis and other producers do take steps to limit supply in order to support prices this will almost certainly spark the ire of the mercurial president
the united states still has considerable leverage in the middle east and trump may be prepared to use this in order to keep oil prices low
the killing of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul last month remains a wild card
the exact role of the saudi government and the crown prince mohammed bin salman is still to be clarified even though riyadh has acknowledged that its agents carried out a premeditated killing
while there are still uncertainties surrounding the outlook for crude oil it seems the market is choosing to focus on the narrative of increasing supply
the market structure has shifted from backwardation where prices for months are lower than those for prompt delivery to contango where prompt prices are lower than those for later delivery
this is usually a sign that the market is facing
while the contango is still modest the risk is that it steepens if investors continue to take the view that there is no shortage of crude
certainly the rise to a high in the drilling rig count in the united states last week suggests that more supply is coming on stream
what the market will now have to assess is how successful the saudis will be in restraining their own output and that of their allies
having completed a in the past few weeks the market may well have to swing its views again in the coming weeks
