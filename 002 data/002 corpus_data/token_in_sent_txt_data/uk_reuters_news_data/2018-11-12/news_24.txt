australian state looks to beef up grid for solar, wind power
melbourne nov reuters australia s most populous state of new south wales outlined plans on monday to speed development of a billion billion worth of transmission capacity to hook up more wind and solar power
the move comes as renewable energy developers have run into problems lining up agreements to hook up new solar and wind farms due to congestion on transmission networks making it hard to secure customers and slowing financing for new projects
new south wales alone has a billion worth of solar and wind projects with gigawatts of capacity on the drawing board
for every projects looking to connect only one can
so we re going to change that new south wales energy minister don harwin said
the state is working with transmission operator transgrid to speed up planning and feasibility work on four projects needed between and to boost connections between new south wales and its neighbouring states queensland victoria and south australia
renewable energy makes up about percent of power generation in australia which still relies mainly on coal but this is forecast to jump to percent by
the existing grid is much more geared to transmitting power from power plants while new solar and wind farms are generally being built in outlying areas with limited transmission capacity
federal and state governments facing elections over the next six months are also desperate to drive down politically sensitive power prices and avert blackouts with the increased adoption of wind and solar power
improved grid connections giving power retailers better access to regions where there is surplus power from wind and solar could lead to a billion of savings on energy bills out to new south wales estimated
australia needs this investment to reflect our changing electricity market harwin told reuters in an interview
he said the state was creating the climate in which industry will invest but declined to give financial details
transgrid owned by a consortium led by spark infrastructure group was not immediately available to comment
