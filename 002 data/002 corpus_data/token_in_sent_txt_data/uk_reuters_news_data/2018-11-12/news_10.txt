u.s. plans to set new limits on heavy-duty truck smog emissions
nov reuters the environmental protection agency on monday will announce it plans to propose new rules to significantly decrease nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel highway trucks and engines an agency official said
industry groups and state environmental officials have urged the epa to set new nationwide rules as the state of california has been moving forward with plans to set new state emissions limits
california also wants nationwide rules in part because more than half of all trucks delivering goods in the state are registered in other states
