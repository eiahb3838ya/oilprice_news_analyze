hundreds line up for gushing west texas oil jobs
odessa texas reuters job fairs are stocked with people hungry for better opportunities but inside the mcm grande hotel in odessa texas oil services giant halliburton is the one doing the wooing
we need to hire you is our message said chris redman a field services manager with summit esp which halliburton acquired last year
more than men and women flocked to the hotel in odessa texas on a thursday last month to be courted by halliburton which needs people to handle everything from oilfield technicians to truck drivers as oil production booms and qualified workers become more scarce
the unemployment rate is percent just off an low but job growth has slowed more recently notably because companies are having trouble finding people
that is particularly true in the oilfields of west texas where workers from local towns like midland and odessa have flocked to the oil industry for higher pay
according to a june dallas federal reserve bank survey of oil executives operating in west texas more than half cited difficulty finding workers as a potential drag on growth
halliburton the second largest provider of oilfield services after schlumberger is adding more than jobs a month hiring executives say
redman said people with commercial drivers licenses are in particular demand but numerous attendees at the jobs fair do not have that license
janice venables drove out to west texas from mississippi a month ago after being laid off from mississippi power last year
she is applying for two jobs with halliburton but says she has applied for as many as other oilfield jobs
i don t care where i go
i just need a job and i ve heard the wages are good said venables
she lives in a recreational vehicle with her dog and cat does not have a commercial driver s license but has started the process to enroll in a commercial driving class this fall
kenneth mcgowan drove hours from mississippi with five friends some just above the legal age to work for halliburton to apply for oilfield jobs
like many in attendance they heard about the fair through a facebook advertisement
mcgowan who works as a stocker at a walmart hopes to find a job providing cementing services for wells
i m not worried about the long hours said mcgowan who is supporting a daughter
he does not have a commercial driver s license but said he is prepared to get one if needed
mcgowan and his friends are not the only job hopefuls to make the trek from mississippi where employment in june was percent one of the highest levels in the united states according to the bureau of labor statistics
the rush to apply for commercial drivers licenses comes as demand for truck drivers in the oil industry and elsewhere has driven up wages for anyone with the license
frank hardin of tennessee who previously drove trucks delivering sand with amerifield inc said he recently landed a job as a driver cig logistics
instead of getting paid per load delivered he now has a salaried position with cig which starts workers at as much as with full benefits
hardin welcomes the change
that s what everyone wants
it s a cakewalk for guys who ve been on the road for years he said
