update 1-saudi arabia pumped less crude oil in july - opec sources
dubai reuters top oil exporter saudi arabia pumped around million barrels per day of crude in july two opec sources said on friday down about bpd from a month earlier
the amount of oil supplied to the market in july was slightly higher at million bpd the sources said
supply to the market domestically and for export may differ from production depending on the movement of barrels in and out of storage
saudi arabia told the organization of the petroleum exporting countries that the kingdom pumped million bpd of crude oil in june an increase of bpd from the production figure it submitted for may
however crude supply to the market in june was higher than wellhead production at million bpd a figure that includes domestic consumption and all exports including from storage tanks
opec agreed with russia and other allies in june to raise output from july with saudi arabia pledging a measurable supply boost
opec and the producers said they would raise supply by returning to percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts after months of underproduction
that would mean a roughly million bpd increase in output
brent oil futures steadied on friday as the market focused on bearish factors after gains in the previous session which were driven by crude inventories at a major hub falling to their lowest in nearly four years
