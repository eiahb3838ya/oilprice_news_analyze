bulgaria expands pipeline to turkey in bid for russian gas
lozenetz bulgaria aug reuters bulgaria opened a new looping section of its transit gas pipeline to turkey on friday expanding its capacity and adding the possibility of flows as the balkan country bids to transport russian gas from the turkstream pipeline to europe
the new looping link in southeastern bulgaria will boost the transbalkan pipeline s capacity to billion cubic meters bcm of gas per year from its current bcm and will help increase security of gas supplies officials said
now we have constructed a pipeline that will allow for reversible flows so we can get gas from turkey from azerbaijan and russia prime minister boyko borissov said at the official ceremony which was also attended by turkish energy minister fatih donmez
sofia has also launched a tender for an km pipeline to provide a higher capacity link between the new looping section and the turkish border
the process has been put on hold however as one bulgarian company is appealing the tender conditions
at present russia s gazprom ships about bcm of gas through ukraine and bulgaria to turkey
the shipments however may cease next year when moscow expects the first line of turkstream to become operational
turkstream is part of the kremlin s plans to bypass ukraine currently the main transit route for russian gas to europe and strengthen its position in the european gas market
it consists of two lines with an annual capacity of bcm each that will run under the black sea to turkey
the first line already completed will be used for local consumption
the second line is planned to run through turkey to southeastern and central europe
bulgaria has said it wants to serve as an entry point to europe but russia is yet to decide whether that pipeline will ship gas via bulgaria or greece
sofia hopes to reach an agreement with moscow ankara and brussels that some of the russian gas from turkstream can be transported through bulgaria to serbia hungary and austria while part of it can be traded at its planned gas hub
