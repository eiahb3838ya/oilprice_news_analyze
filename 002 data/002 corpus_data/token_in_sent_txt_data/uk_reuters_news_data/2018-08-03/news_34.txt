south africa's num to seek members approval on latest wage offer by eskom
johannesburg aug reuters south africa s national union of mineworkers num will seek a mandate from its members to seal a wage agreement with struggling power firm eskom a union source said on friday
although eskom is on a drive as it tries to emerge from a financial crisis it caved in to union demands for higher pay after protesting workers forced some of its generating units to be switched off leading to power outages in africa s most industrialised economy
the solidarity trade union said on thursday it had accepted a wage offer from eskom but the other two bigger unions including num were yet to respond
