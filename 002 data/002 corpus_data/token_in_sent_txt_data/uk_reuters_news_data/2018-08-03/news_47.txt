china's beijing gas charts new direction under helm of madame li
beijing reuters beijing gas group s chairwoman li yalan is guiding the chinese capital s natural gas distributor into the highly competitive world of natural gas trading while still providing fuel to a city that consumes as much gas in a year as belgium
li became one of the few women to head a major energy company after taking the helm in
she currently leads a company that distributes billion cubic metres of gas a year more than the amount of gas that global trader vitol moved in
under li s tutelage the firm part of beijing enterprise holdings plans to move beyond gas distribution into natural gas trading by procuring supplies it can sell to chinese
the company last year completed a billion million pounds purchase of a percent stake in an east siberian gas field owned by russia s rosneft
beijing gas consumption if we remain only as a city gas distributor we ll have limits in securing supplies li told reuters in an interview
having control over resources will empower as part of its foray into natural gas trading beijing gas is planning to construct a liquefied natural gas receiving terminal that can regasify billion cubic metres a year of gas along with a storage farm that can hold million cubic metres near the city of tianjin an official from the tianjin government confirmed
the project would also include a pipeline connecting the terminal to beijing the official said
the first phase of the terminal is slated to start in pending regulatory approval and the final cost is expected to be over billion yuan the official said
the terminal will give beijing gas extra supply to trade as it plans to start a trading desk once the project is operational said li
the investments in the rosneft field and shale gas assets in southwestern china along with the lng receiving terminal help beijing gas stand out from other municipalities that have focussed on pipelines and their local markets
beijing gas could comfortably live on its city gas business but under the leadership of madame li the firm has developed a global vision that is rare among its peers said li yao founder of consultancy sia energy
the growth that li is seeking for beijing gas directly stems from the chinese government s mandated switch to natural gas from coal for residential heating and industrial fuel as part of its fight against air pollution
that policy caused china s lng imports to surge as the country last year overtook south korea as the world s importer
however piped natural gas will still fulfil crucial parts of china s needs
beijing gas s stake in rosneft s verkhnechonsk oil and gas field gives them access to billion cubic metres of gas per year through imports on russia s power of siberia pipeline starting in december
rosneft didn t know us well at the start but eventually the deal factored in beijing gas value that few competitors could match direct access to a vast market said li
li s career has been intricately tied to securing natural gas for beijing ever since she chose the energy industry nearly four decades ago by picking city gas as her university major since her parents had hoped it would result in a job in a city rather than the countryside
from there li gained exposure to the french gas network during a training stint with gaz de france in the late
there she learned the practices of procurement pricing and infrastructure necessary for a distribution business and a model for beijing gas to later emulate
that was a huge said li
china then had very rudimentary infrastructure while france was already highly li parlayed that experience to become in a leader for planning china s first major gas pipeline carrying supplies from the ordos basin in northern china to beijing
she was meticulous in her details mapping out how many small restaurants and businesses in the capital needed to shift to gas from coal for their cooking and heating needs
she also lobbied the government to remove a ban on gas as a boiler fuel
beijing gas is now the link between and energy producers such as petrochina ltd and has invested billions of dollars over the years in domestic gas infrastructure controlled by the company
the early cooperation and trust built with petrochina china s largest gas producer and pipeline operator gave beijing gas a as a strategic partner in nearly all of petrochina s major trunk pipelines a key source of cash flow for the distributor
li s decades of work and her commitment to the natural gas industry were recognised with her election to president of the international gas union for a term starting in during which china will host the world gas conference
she is the first woman and the first chinese person to hold the position
