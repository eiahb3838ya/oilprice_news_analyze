update 2-china's unipec suspends u.s. oil imports as trade spat intensifies
reuters china s unipec the trading arm of state oil major sinopec has suspended crude oil imports from the united states due to a growing trade spat between washington and beijing three sources familiar with the situation said on friday
the sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media
it is not clear how long the temporary halt will last but one of the sources said unipec has no new bookings of crude until at least october
unipec and sinopec asia s largest refiner and biggest buyer of oil did not respond to requests for comment
chinese buyers had already slowed their purchases of oil to avoid a likely import tariff threatened by beijing amid the escalating trade dispute between the world s two largest economies
beijing has put energy products including crude oil and refined products on a list of goods it will hit with a percent import tax in retaliation for similar moves by washington
it has not said when it will impose the tariffs
unipec said earlier this year it expects to trade up to barrels per day bpd of crude oil by the end of the year about triple its trading volume of oil last year
china s crude oil imports from the united states reached an average of bpd in the first eight months of this year according to trade flows data on thomson reuters eikon
the amount of crude arriving in september is expect to fall to bpd as only three supertankers are to china the data showed
the absence of china the largest buyer of crude after canada has partly weighed on spot crude prices making them more affordable for other buyers in asia
unipec will continue trading crude selling the oil to europe one of the sources said
still it is unlikely to ship any of the oil to the east as it no longer has a backstop for the oil if it can not find a buyer at the right price during the voyage said three traders that participate in the market
china s prohibitive import tariff which amounts to close to a barrel when crude is at has also deterred other chinese buyers such as companies petrochina as well as zhenhua oil and independent refiners from importing crude they said
meanwhile a narrower price spread between the brent and dubai crude benchmarks has made oil from europe and africa that is similar in quality to the crude more affordable for china
china s oil imports from west africa are set to rebound in august to million bpd the highest since may according to data on eikon
unipec has also bought north sea forties and russian urals last month for september delivery when the arbitrage opened trade sources said
