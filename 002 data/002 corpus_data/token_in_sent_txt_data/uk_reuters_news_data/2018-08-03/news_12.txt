chinese tariffs on lng, oil may hit u.s. bid for energy dominance
new aug reuters china s targeting of liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports opens a new front in the trade war between the two countries at a time when the white house is trumpeting growing energy export prowess

it makes it very difficult said michael cohen head of energy markets research at barclays

china is the world s biggest crude oil importer
china had curtailed its imports of lng over the last two months even before its formal inclusion in the list of potential tariffs

lng producers will try to move to other locations said dominick chirichella director of risk management trading and advisory services at emi dtn in new york noting there will likely be a big push to places like europe and japan
