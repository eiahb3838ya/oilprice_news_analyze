struggling noble group faces crucial vote for $3.5 bln restructure
singapore reuters noble group ltd faces a key shareholder meeting on monday as the shrivelled commodity trader races to clinch a billion debt restructuring deal to stay afloat and put a crisis behind it
shareholders are being asked to support a swap that will leave them with just percent of the business
multiple sources familiar with the matter say the proposal is expected to succeed
the meeting is due to start at local time gmt
noble founded in by richard elman who took advantage of a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world s biggest traders has seen its market value all but wiped out from billion in feb
the crisis started in february after arnaud vagner a former employee published reports anonymously under the name of iceberg research and accused noble of inflating its assets
the upheaval triggered a share price collapse credit downgrades writedowns and asset sales
noble has always stood by its accounts
under a swap agreed with a group of mostly creditors the company s debt will be halved and it will get access to trade finance and hedging facilities vital in a sector where profit margins are in the low single digits
in return noble will hand over percent of its restructured business to creditors while existing shareholders equity will be whittled down to percent and its management will get percent
noble has won the backing of percent of its shareholders including elman its former chairman
the company needs a simple majority of voters in attendance at monday s meeting for the debt restructuring to go ahead
trading in noble s shares was halted on monday pending an announcement by the company
analysts say the company faces an uphill battle with its loss widening to million in from million a quarter ago
there s no evidence so far that the business is turning around said neel gopalakrishnan credit strategist at dbs group
funding is the most important driver for this business and if a turnaround doesn t come the company may find it difficult to retain funding lines he said
if the vote doesn t go its way noble will seek to implement a similar restructuring to keep it as a going concern but that plan does not provide for shareholders to receive any equity
