update 1-total rules out investing in u.s. shale oil after bp-bhp deal
stavanger norway reuters french energy group total is not looking at investing in the shale oil industry the company s chief executive said on monday
patrick pouyanne made the comment when asked whether peer bp s billion acquisition of shale assets from bhp billiton had made the sector more attractive
it s first quite expensive second we don t have the human resources
bp had the human resources bp had already a position so i can understand their move but it s not my case pouyanne said on the sidelines of an oil conference
bp s acquisition of about producing acres marked a turning point for the group since the deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico in for which the company is still paying off more than billion in penalties and costs
shell and norway s equinor have also invested in shale but eni and total have been cautious
shale veteran and pioneer natural resources chairman scott sheffield rang an optimistic note when asked at the conference about european oil and gas companies investing in shale
eventually i think more and more majors will get there because it s the region for the next years in the world
and so if you re not in the permian then you d better find growth somewhere else sheffield said
he was referring to the permian basin which stretches across western texas and eastern new mexico
