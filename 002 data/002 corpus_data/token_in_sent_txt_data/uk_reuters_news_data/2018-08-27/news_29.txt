interview-climate fund snags threaten opportunity to fight warming - ban ki-moon
barcelona aug thomson reuters foundation i nsufficient cash is hampering a flagship international fund to help poor nations combat climate change which is not working as fast and efficiently as the urgency of global warming requires said former ban
the green climate fund gcf was established at climate talks in to channel a substantial portion of the billion per year wealthy nations had pledged to mobilise by for efforts to curb carbon emissions and weather the impacts of climate change
ban told the thomson reuters foundation that decisions by president donald trump to withdraw his country from the paris agreement on global warming and to walk away from promises on climate finance jeopardised global commitments
i am deeply concerned that the gcf while it has been really trying to work has not been fully funded ban said in an interview from south korea where the fund is also based
with the pullout of this paris climate agreement we are not sure whether billion by will be met he added
trump s predecessor barack obama pledged billion to the gcf but only billion of that funding has been delivered
of a total of more than billion committed to the fund since it has allocated about billion for projects in countries to curb emissions and adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas
but the last meeting of its board in july was blocked by disputes over policies and governance meaning no new projects were approved
ban who is president of the global green growth institute a gcf partner described that result as quite unfortunate
pressure is growing including from the climate change chief for the gcf to get back to business before major climate talks in poland in december to smooth negotiations on a rule book to implement the paris agreement
ban said the fund should focus on getting things done
it should be more effective it should be more agile he said
otherwise if you have to wait many months or years to get the funding by that time we will miss the opportunity to mitigate and adapt to climate change according to the gcf projects backed by about billion of its funding are now being rolled out from climate information services to reduce disasters in the pacific island state of vanuatu to producing sustainable argan oil in morocco
javier manzanares deputy executive director of the fund whose chief howard bamsey resigned abruptly at july s meeting described the implementation figures as stellar
he conceded the summer meeting was a setback but said he was confident that the board will find a way to solve these challenging discussions
at its next meeting in october manzanares is hoping projects worth up to billion will be approved and about new agencies accredited to lead work in the field
a process to replenish the fund s coffers should also be triggered he said
i believe there is a very strong commitment to making things happen he told the thomson reuters foundation
manzanares underscored the urgency of topping up the fund s finances given its pipeline of projects compared with available money
we are now dealing with a situation of demand that clearly outstrips supply he said
the difference is so huge that there is a true need to start if all goes well a pledging meeting for donors could be held late next year he noted although it remains unclear whether a target amount will be set
ban pointed to a climate summit to be hosted by chief antonio guterres in september as a key moment for governments to outline clearly how they will reach their wider annual goal of billion
otherwise it will be a huge embarrassment for the developed countries not to be able to have a formula and a strong commitment on this ban said
i am sure that they will work on this matter
i am urging them
