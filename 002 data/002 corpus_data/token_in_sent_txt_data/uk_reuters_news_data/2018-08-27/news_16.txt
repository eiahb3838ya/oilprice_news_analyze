update 1-hellenic petroleum workers battling selloff block suitors from refineries
adds no comment from glencore athens aug reuters workers at hellenic petroleum on monday physically prevented suitors eyeing a majority stake in greece s biggest oil refiner from entering two of its sites in protest at plans to privatise the utility a union spokesman said
while privatisations have been a key part of successive bailout agreements greece has struck since they have been met with strong political resistance
greece still has a series of deals to complete under the terms of its latest bailout which ended last week including the sale of a percent stake in hellenic jointly held by the state and paneuropean oil and industrial holdings
the country s privatisation agency has shortlisted glencore energy and switzerland s vitol holding for the stake in hellenic
glencore was scheduled to visit hellenic s refineries in aspropyrgos and elefsina about miles kms outside athens on monday
however representatives arriving at the sites failed to gain entry after workers walked off the job for four hours to picket the entrance to the facilities the union and another source close to the privatisation process said
the union said they planned more work stoppages for tuesday and next week to protest against the sale
workers didn t let them in because they want to cancel hellenic petroleum s panagiotis ofthalmides the head of their labour union representing about workers told reuters
hellenic is strategically important for the country s national interests and should remain under state control ofthalmides said
hellenic petroleum and greece s privatisation agency declined to comment on the action
glencore also declined to comment
glencore was due to visit hellenic s third refinery in thessaloniki on tuesday while its competitor vitol is expected in athens next week
ofthalmides said workers will not allow them to enter those sites either
greece aims to conclude hellenic s sale by the middle of next year
a government source said the government has been in talks with the union and that the privatisation will be completed within the agreed timetable
greece has raised about billion euros billion from state assets since versus an original target of billion euros due to red tape backtracking and opposition by unions
it has made significant progress in recent months and is aiming for sales worth a further billion euros by next year
