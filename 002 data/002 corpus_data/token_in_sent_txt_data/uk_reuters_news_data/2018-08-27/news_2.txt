graphic china imports of crude vs bonny light wti houston by clyde russell launceston australia aug reuters one of the side effects of president donald trump s escalating trade dispute with china is that exports of crude oil to the world s biggest importer are now viewed through the prism of politics
however this ignores that buyers and sellers of crude are generally more motivated by profit margins and getting the right grades of oil to maximise the productivity of their plants
while it s true they can t disregard politics and this is especially the case for the chinese majors it s worth looking at the economics of the crude trade as well
crude exports to china appear set to slow dramatically in september with data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts showing about million barrels or about barrels per day bpd scheduled for arrival
this would be down from around bpd in august and would also be the weakest month since march this year
the slowdown in china s imports of crude has coincided with the imposition of trade tariffs and speculation that beijing would add crude to its list of products to be hit with import taxes
that hasn t happened yet although it would have been understandable for chinese refiners to be wary of buying from the united states in recent weeks
however the pricing of the various grades of crude oil also offers an explanation as to why china stocked up on crude in august and appears to have shied away in september and probably october as well
chinese traders would have been keen to buy west texas intermediate wti types of crude for august delivery given these cargoes would have been arranged in late may and early june
the discount of wti crude oil futures to brent futures widened to a barrel on june and traded close to level for around a period from late may to
this means that chinese refiners could buy wti at a substantial discount to brent in the paper market which would encourage them to take physical cargoes from the gulf
in the physical market the difference between oil linked to wti and oil linked to brent wasn t quite as stark but was nonetheless in favour of the grades
nigerian bonny light a crude oil similar to and priced against brent was trading at a barrel on may
at the same time wti delivered at the magellan east houston terminal as assessed by argus media was at a discount of a barrel
this level of discount is enough to offset the slightly higher freight cost of shipping to china from the gulf as opposed to the west coast of africa
however by the time september cargoes for china would have been arranged the numbers had moved in the other direction with bonny light trading at a barrel on june putting it at a discount of to wti houston
this would have made buying west african light crudes more attractive than cargoes from the united states
while the chinese refiners may have been under some political pressure to cut back on buying crude it was probably something they didn t feel the need to push back on given the profits weren t working anyway
the current pricing isn t particularly supportive of chinese buying of cargoes with bonny light at a slight a barrel premium over wti houston
for refiners prepared to offset physical trades in the paper market the discount of wti futures to brent contracts was at a barrel on widening from at the end of july
however putting the paper and physical pricing together suggests that crude is currently not a compelling purchase for chinese refiners compared to similar grades from other producers such as those in west africa
while the trade spat between washington and beijing could worsen to the point where crude exports to china are rendered completely uncompetitive in the meantime it probably pays to looks at the underlying pricing to help judge the likelihood of whether exports will rise or fall
