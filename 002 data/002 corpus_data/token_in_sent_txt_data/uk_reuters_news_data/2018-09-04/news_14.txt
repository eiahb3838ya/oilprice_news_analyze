rupiah continues to slide hits technical problem with trading on friday has been resolved govt will act firmly against speculators finance minister infrastructure projects delayed to reduce dollar needs adds detail on plans to reduce imports by maikel jefriando and tabita diela jakarta sept reuters indonesia s government said on tuesday that authorities will take firm action against currency speculators and announced plans to delay energy projects as the rupiah hit its weakest levels since the asian financial crisis in
finance minister sri mulyani indrawati didn t say what sanctions speculators could face but warned that large currency transactions would be checked by bank indonesia bi and the financial services authority fsa to ensure they were based on trade or commerce and not just playing the market
if there are parties who are making profits based on other people s sacrifices then the ojk fsa and bi would monitor in detail and take firm action against these players who are profit taking she said
fear of contagion from the economic woes in argentina and turkey have driven investors away from emerging markets and the rupiah has become the second worst performing emerging asian currency after the indian rupee having lost nearly percent of its value this year
on tuesday the rupiah touched to the dollar its weakest in years
addressing a parliamentary hearing on the government s budget proposals bank indonesia governor perry warjiyo said the rupiah should come under less pressure next year as the federal reserve is expected to increase interest rates just three times next year compared with four time this year
earlier on tuesday darmin nasution coordinating minister for economic affairs said authorities were examining the reasons behind the rupiah s drop saying there had been speculative trading and a technical problem with quotations
there were things that pushed the depreciation further that we think makes it illogical
we re looking to find out why beside argentina s problem nasution said after a meeting with president joko widodo attended by other ministers and the central bank governor
bank indonesia and the fsa had received complaints from fund managers that some commercial banks were not quoting rates on friday leaving them unable to trade nasution said
i don t know what happened but immediately it was resolved he said
my point is there are technical problems that should not have occurred but they since bi has raised interest rates by basis points and spent billions of dollars in intervention defending the rupiah
in an attempt to anticipate future dollar requirements widodo asked ministers to assess how much foreign currency would be needed to pay for imports related to large infrastructure projects underway nasution said

on wednesday the government will announce import tariffs on hundreds of consumer goods indrawati said
energy and mineral resources minister ignasius jonan said later that the government would postpone or restructure several strategic power and oil and gas projects amid efforts to reduce imports and support the rupiah
jonan said megawatts of power projects worth an estimated billion roughly half of president widodo s flagship gigawatt powerstation development programme would need to be rescheduled to reduce the burden of imports deemed unnecessary
power projects generally contain to percent imported components and for refineries the figure is percent jonan said adding that the government plans to block imports of any items that can be sourced locally
the minister declined to comment on which oil and gas projects would be delayed or restructured but noted that refinery projects should continue as planned
the government would also push resource companies to use letters of credit and keep proceeds from exports in local banks he said
if that money is kept overseas or outside state banks jonan warned companies could be hit with sanctions that reduce their export capacity or production
