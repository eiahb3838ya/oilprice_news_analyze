graphic china lng imports spot price by clyde russell launceston australia sept reuters china appears set to once again boost its purchases of liquefied natural gas lng for the northern winter but unlike last year s rush this time the process is likely to be more organised and stable
in recent weeks there have been several indicators that china is planning on increasing the use of natural gas in winter heating replacing boilers that use more polluting coal
curbing winter air pollution has been a major aim of the authorities in beijing but they were stung by criticism last year that the switch to natural gas was made too quickly and the resulting shortages left some people without adequate heating
a sign that beijing is putting more effort into ensuring sufficient natural gas supplies came last week when of finance liu wei was quoted by the communist party newspaper as saying that gas supply agreements must be in place when converting boilers to the cleaner fuel
these comments were followed by an announcement by oil and gas major sinopec that it is putting in place a range of measures to boost winter natural gas supplies including increasing purchases of spot lng cargoes and boosting distribution
it s often a challenge with china to work out exactly how official pronouncements will translate into real world action but in all likelihood china is going to increase lng imports in coming months
this will come on top of an already strong year so far with both official customs data and data compiled by thomson reuters showing impressive gains
china imported about million tonnes of lng in august the highest since january according to the shipping data
imports for the first eight months totalled million tonnes up percent from the same period last year
customs data for the january to july period shows imports of about million tonnes up percent from the same period in
in addition to the surge in import volumes the data show that china s lng purchases haven t shown as much of the seasonal swings of past years with a strong winter peak followed by lulls in spring and summer before picking up in autumn
in the winter imports in december and january were some percent higher than those in july
however imports in july this year were only percent below the previous winter peak months of december and january indicating that lng demand has remained robust throughout the year so far
there was a summer in china which boosted electricity demand for but this had more of an impact on coal demand given limited power generation from natural gas
it seems that china has not only been increasing its consumption of natural gas but has also been building up storage capacity in order to increase availability during the winter peak
what appears to be happening is that china s lng demand is becoming more which should mitigate swings in spot pricing in asia
indeed this has already occurred to some extent with spot prices showing a milder decline to the low point from the prior winter s peak than in previous years
the drop from the winter peak in january to the low in march was percent compared to percent last year and percent the year before
it s also worth noting that spot lng enjoyed a surprise summer peak but this is more likely related to the unusually hot northern summer
prices have been rising since late july and last week reached per million british thermal units mmbtu
this is coincidentally the peak price from the previous winter which was reached in
this is a sign that spot lng prices are likely to rise further in coming weeks but may peak earlier than usual assuming winter temperatures fall within the normal ranges
