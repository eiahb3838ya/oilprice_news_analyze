focus-back from the brink: how noble group was saved from an iceberg collision
singapore reuters in may paul brough had just assumed the chairmanship of noble group and immediately faced a room full of angry bankers demanding their money back from the struggling commodity trader
mustering all his years of experience as a restructuring specialist brough needed their support to keep the credit lines open that underpinned the operations of what had once been asia s biggest commodity trading house
at the meeting in amsterdam in late may banks were shocked by a recently reported quarterly loss and were in no mood to keep supporting the company
the atmosphere in the room was highly charged brough told reuters in an interview last week
a number of them were already taking the decision that they wanted to exit the relationship said brough a former senior regional partner at kpmg in hong kong who helped wind up the asian business of lehman brothers
the following week s meeting with banks did not go much better with brough saying the banks made it very clear that they wanted their secure debt repaid very very however brough who managed china s after its billion collapse in convinced the banks to give noble a debt reprieve to sell its assets in the united states
from there brough who took over from company founder richard elman brought noble back from among the biggest corporate experiences in asia
the company last week secured shareholder support for a billion debt restructuring
in the months between brough s appointment and last week s deal noble dramatically downsized and reported a billion loss for including a billion valuation adjustment of its controversial derivatives contracts
by the time brough became chairman noble had fended off two years of accusations by iceberg research that it had inflated its assets
noble which has stood by its accounts later revealed iceberg to be led by credit analyst arnaud vagner
when brough took charge noble had lost percent or nearly billion in market value since iceberg issued its first report in february
brough reckons he travelled miles negotiating with hundreds of creditors and shareholders from hong kong and singapore to new york london and then hired investment bank moelis company and lawyers kirkland ellis specialists in debt restructurings the first sign of a possible wholesale restructure
pjt partners and comprador ltd joined as financial advisors as brough unveiled a strategic review of noble
he brought together seven of its core trade finance banks at the amsterdam meeting
those banks included mufg bank ing bank and rabobank
mufg and ing declined to comment while rabobank did not respond to a reuters query
it was really one of those meetings that served as a meeting where everybody was put on alert said a person who participated in the talks
for a related graphic click noble s rescue is viewed as one of the most complex debt restructurings due to its global trading business and the mix of creditors from banks to different strata of bondholders and shareholders
the dual needs of keeping noble adequately capitalised with trade finance at a time when bankers were very nervous about relationships and when customers are also very nervous meant that it was very very challenging said neil mcdonald a partner at kirkland ellis
when noble won an extension for its credit facilities in june its shares surged percent but bond prices slid after it skipped an interest payment
we had to call banks morning noon and night to make sure they were comfortable with the restructuring said one advisor
for brough those summer months were the lowest point in the salvage operation with banks making aggressive requests and there were times noble could have run out of cash
we found ourselves having to increase the margin that we were giving banks for our trade finance facilities and for our brokerage facilities he said
noble agreed to sell its gas and power business to mercuria for million last july a deal that also increased its trade finance access
then in october it announced the sale of its most business oil trading to vitol for billion
the first glimmer of hope was when we announced the sale of the oil business said brough who will step down after the restructured company focusing on coal and freight trading in asia kicks off later this year
in november noble formally announced the debt restructure and then agreed to a deal to give creditors percent of the new company equity
resistance from big shareholders such as elman and goldilocks investment co an abu fund put it at risk
but in march noble s creditors agreed to give existing shareholders a percent equity share up from a previous percent with an ultimatum back the proposal or face insolvency
however iceberg s vagner says the new noble will still be
most importantly interest skyrockets
so it will incur almost the same interest costs he told reuters by email
noble will also gain million in trade financing and hedging facilities from ing and deutsche bank the last two banks supporting the company down from banks five years ago
