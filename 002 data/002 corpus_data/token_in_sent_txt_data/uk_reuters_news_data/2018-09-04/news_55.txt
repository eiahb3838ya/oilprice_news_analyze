update 1-venezuela to hike fuel prices by october, maduro says
caracas reuters venezuela will hike the price of its heavily subsidized gasoline by october president nicolas maduro said on monday as the government seeks to shore up its coffers amid hyperinflation that is accelerating a broad economic collapse
despite the crisis fuel prices are set so low that the equivalent of buys nearly gallons of fuel
that cripples the state s hard currency earnings and drives a lucrative smuggling trade
the government on tuesday will launch a new payment system using a identification card in border states to limit smuggling maduro said and will increase prices to international levels once that system is in place
during the course of september october once that system is working we will establish the subsidy systems and the price of gasoline will be set at the international price he said during a televised broadcast
maduro did not offer additional details
any increase would mark the first time in years that venezuela has significantly raised fuel prices which have been a sensitive issue ever since riots broke out in in response to austerity measures that included higher gasoline prices
government regulations have kept prices steady at the pump despite inflation that is expected to hit percent this year according to the international monetary fund
drivers have for years paid for fuel in loose change often tipping service station workers more than they pay to fill their tanks
experts estimate venezuela where shortages of food and medicine have fueled hunger disease and a mass exodus of citizens loses at least billion a year as a result of not selling gasoline at international prices
critics have questioned how venezuelans whose salaries have been destroyed by unchecked inflation could afford to pay the same fuel prices as those facing drivers in the united states
the new system revolves around a id known as the fatherland card which maduro says is meant to provide better services to citizens through data collection
opposition critics say the identification cards are meant to channel subsidies and scarce food and medical services to government supporters while withholding them from maduro s adversaries
