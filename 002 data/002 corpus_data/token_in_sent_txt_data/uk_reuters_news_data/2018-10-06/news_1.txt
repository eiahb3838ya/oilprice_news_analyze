refile-hydro gets key tech permit for brazil plant, plans to restart operations
oslo reuters norsk hydro has been granted a permit in brazil to use new technology to extend the life of a disposal area for its troubled alunorte alumina refinery the world s largest which should lead to the restart of operations at percent the firm said on saturday
the decision came on friday two days after hydro said it would halt production and layoff people at brazil s alunorte which has been operating at half capacity since march due to an environmental dispute
hydro s alumina refinery alunorte was granted an exceptional authorization which will extend the life of its bauxite residue disposal area and allow alunorte to continue operations on safe conditions it said in a statement
the authorisation was granted by brazil s federal environmental agency ibama and it allows the utilisation of a press filter technology that provides stackable residues with considerably less water content than the drum filter
hydro will now work with brazil s secretary of state for environment and sustainability semas to get a second authorisation that will permit the use of the technology in alunorte s bauxite residue disposal area
after receiving this second authorization alunorte will be able to the operation at percent of capacity said the firm
resuming percent production at alunorte would also allow hydro s bauxite mine paragominas and its primary aluminium smelter albras to continue operating at half capacity rather than being shut down its bauxite and alumina head john thuestad said
three days ago when hydro said it would halt production at alunorte shares fell percent to a low making it the worst performer in the european stoxx index
the price of aluminium the product made from alumina climbed percent to its highest since june
closures of alunorte paragominas and albras would have significant operational and financial consequences hydro said at the time
the decision to halt all production had been taken as the refinery s waste deposit area is close to full capacity due to an embargo on the new press filter and as an ongoing dispute with brazil s authorities had been preventing hydro from using a newly created residue facility the firm said on wednesday
on thursday a day after hydro s decision to halt operations at alunorte the brazilian state of para said it was surprised with the move and asked for a report explaining the decision
alunorte made million tonnes of alumina in about percent of global production outside china and enough to make some million tonnes of aluminium
its partial shutdown earlier this year drove up market prices for alumina and aluminium
