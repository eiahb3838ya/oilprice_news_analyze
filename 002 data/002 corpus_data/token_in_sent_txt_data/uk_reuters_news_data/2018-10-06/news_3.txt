worried zimbabweans fill up cars and stockpile goods, bank sees improvement soon
harare reuters zimbabwe s central bank governor sought to reassure the public on saturday as people again formed long queues to fill up their cars in the capital with others basic goods like cooking oil and sugar
the panic has been caused by recent changes introduced by the government and a worsening dollar crunch but the governor john mangudya told reuters that people should not be worried and that he expected an improvement in the next hours the problem is that we did not explain things
this economy is a sentiment driven economy so we need to communicate more with the society he said
the southern african nation dumped its currency in favor of the dollar in but a shortage of cash dollars has worsened following a disputed election won by president emmerson mnangagwa in july
fuel queues started building up this week and on saturday outlets in harare had either run out or had long queues as drivers patiently waited for their turn to fill up their tanks
i have been here for an hour because the queue is moving slowly
i have no choice because i need the petrol said one motorist who identified himself as pascal at a service station in the avondale suburb in harare
at some outlets owned by total attendants only served motorists with cards
other outlets refused mobile payments preferring bank cards and cash
zimbabwe spends million on fuel imports every month
mangudya told reuters the fuel shortages had been caused by an introduction of a percent tax on electronic payments last monday which meant oil firms would incur weekly bank charges of for fuel imports but were not allowed to pass the cost to consumers
the companies had stopped supplying fuel as a result mangudya said but he added the situation would improve in the next hours because the government on friday night scrapped the tax on foreign payments
zimbabweans were also stocking up on basic goods like rice cooking oil sugar and juice
at some branches owned by zimbabwe s biggest grocery chain ok zimbabwe management limited sales of sugar cooking oil and a popular local juice
management reserves the right to limit quantities read a notice to customers
a shortage of dollars in banks has forced importers to purchase them on the black market which has pushed up premiums and the price of imports
on the black market the premium for the dollar spiked to a new record on saturday reaching percent from percent on monday traders said
that means buying in cash via a bank transfer cost up from earlier this week
the situation has not been helped by mangudya s decision early this week to order banks to open accounts for clients who earn foreign currency and separate their money from dollars in the local banking system known as zollars
analysts said the move effectively makes the dollar surrogates zimbabwe s local currency
there are billion of zollars in banks compared to million in reserves official data showed a mismatch that creates a premium for the dollar and fans the black market
