mozambique launches initiative to disarm, reintegrate opposition fighters
maputo oct reuters mozambique president filipe nyusi on saturday launched an initiative to disarm and reintegrate the military wing of the country s main opposition party renamo as part of efforts to bolster peace and security
renamo and nyusi s ruling frelimo party fought on opposing sides of a civil war that killed an estimated million people before a peace accord ended the fighting in
violence has flared up sporadically since including after renamo challenged the results of the natural southern african country s elections
the end goal of this process is to rid the country of unconstitutional armed forces in the quest for an effective sustainable and transparent peace nyusi said at the launch of the demobilisation and reintegration initiative in maputo mozambique s capital
nyusi said international experts from countries such as the united states india and germany would oversee the initiative which will see some renamo fighters getting jobs in the army and police
renamo leader afonso dhlakama died earlier this year
he had been due to run for the presidency in next year s elections
