corrected-nigerian opposition to pick presidential candidate as northwest takes centre stage
abuja reuters nigeria s main opposition party which this weekend selects its candidate to challenge president muhammadu buhari in an election in february is aiming to make his northwestern power base a main battleground in the contest
to do so however it needs to secure the backing of powerful figures in the northwest and to ensure the party does not fracture over its choice of candidate analysts said
many of the candidates for the people s democratic party pdp nomination defected from buhari s ruling all progressives congress apc in recent months
seven have ties with states in the northwest mostly as current or past governors bolstering the party in a traditional buhari stronghold
at stake in the primary election is the chance to face him in a presidential contest which will determine who controls a country that is africa s top oil producer has one of the continent s biggest economies and plays a key role in regional wars against islamist insurgents
the northwest the most densely populated region in the country of million people is shaping up to take centre stage in the race
in past elections buhari got almost half of his vote from the northwest and the region will be even more important this time said malte liewerscheidt west africa analyst at teneo intelligence
a lot of people from other regions who voted for buhari in are likely to turn their back on the region is traditionally the centre of the muslim voter base as nigeria s three most senior islamic leaders the sultan of sokoto the emir of kano and the emir of gwando are based there
buhari a northern muslim who won the election at the fourth attempt took million votes in kano state compared to secured by goodluck jonathan a christian southerner
an unofficial agreement aimed at rotating power between the mainly muslim north and mostly christian south means a northern candidate is likely to be selected by the opposition
the northerners in the primary contest include the governor of northwestern sokoto state aminu tambuwal former kano governor ibrahim shekarau governor ahmed makarfi and former sokoto governor attahiru bafarawa
assuming that the pdp remains united this could put them back on the map in the northwest a region where the party scored on average merely percent in teneo s liewerscheidt said
pdp national publicity secretary kola ologbondiyan dismissed the suggestion that supporters of unsuccessful candidates may not back the person selected
we are all going to work together to ensure the victory of our candidate he said
the dent in buhari s popularity can largely be attributed to the economy
nigeria entered its first recession in years in mainly caused by lower oil prices and attacks in the niger delta crude production region
it emerged from recession early last year but growth remains sluggish and inflation has remained high above the central bank s single digit target range
the impact of the economic downturn of recent years is for some on the streets of the north s commercial hub kano a reason to reject buhari
everything went back under buhari there s no progress or development said yusuf yakubu who left buhari s party in june and joined the pdp
if you go to the market the traders will tell you the economy has collapsed under this administration
there is really nothing kano can hold up and say this is how we ve benefited under buhari he said
but many others on the streets of the city felt that the president who is from the neighbouring state of katsina should be given a second term
perhaps we all would not be in kano state by now if not for his administration
maybe we would have all been chased out of this state by boko haram said abdullmuminu gezewa praising the government s security record
