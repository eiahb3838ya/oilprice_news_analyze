australian court bars new coal mine development, cites environmental impact
melbourne feb reuters developers have lost a court appeal to build a coal mine in australia s hunter valley over its potentially dire environmental impact after the country s first legal review of a coal mine project to hear evidence from a climate scientist
in the landmark ruling justice brian preston denied the appeal on the rocky hill project in new south wales state citing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertain economic benefits and adverse social and visual impacts
australia is the world s biggest coal exporter and the fuel is its largest resources earner
canberra last year scrapped plans for a national energy policy that aimed to cut carbon emissions as well as power prices in part due to opposition from coal supporters within its ranks
in his ruling the judge found that mine and associated greenhouse gas ghg emissions would add to the global total at a time when what is now urgently needed in order to meet generally agreed climate targets is a rapid and deep decrease in ghg in short an open cut coal mine in this part of the gloucester valley would be in the wrong place at the wrong time preston found
these dire consequences should be at the end of january the organisation of economic cooperation and development made waves in australia when it said the country needed to cut emissions more sharply to meet its paris climate accord target as the country remained heavily dependent on power
but on thursday a study published earlier on friday by australian national university anu researchers found the country is adopting renewable energy faster per capita than the rest of the world
rapid recent growth in wind and solar power has left it on track to meet paris carbon emissions reductions targets well before it found
the rocky hill project is being developed by privately held gloucester resources a unit of grl holdings pty ltd
representatives of gloucester resources did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment
mining services firm ldo group listed as a stakeholder in the project said that the company had no comment to make
grl has the right to appeal to the new south wales surpreme court
environmental campaigners welcomed the court ruling
the chief executive of australia s climate council amanda mckenzie said australia must continue to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy with storage
the science says so and now the law does too she said in a statement
