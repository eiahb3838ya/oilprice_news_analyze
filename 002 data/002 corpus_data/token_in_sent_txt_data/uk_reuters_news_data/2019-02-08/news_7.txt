corrected-update 1-world's largest wealth fund to press firms for climate data at agms
this article has been corrected to show in fourth paragraph that a temperature rise of is equivalent to not by gwladys fouche oslo reuters norway s trillion wealth fund will push the firms it invests in to disclose more data on greenhouse gases they emit and how they adapt to climate change during the coming annual general meeting season a top fund official said
the world s largest sovereign wealth fund invests the revenues of norway s oil and gas production and has stakes in some companies across countries
it was an early mover among international investors in trying to assess climate change risk wanting to avoid investments in one sector negatively impacting another externalities and hurting its overall portfolio
this year it will make a fresh push on firms to explain how their business will be affected and how they are adapting to a world where temperatures may rise by degrees celsius
what we would like to see more of is scenarios including a scenario and we want better disclosure of the assumptions for these scenarios carine smith ihenacho the fund s chief corporate governance officer told reuters
we want clear targets for emissions and other greenhouse gases including methane
and we want to see reporting of progress against the targets she added
we would like to see it more disaggregated meaning not for the whole company but more broken down for instance regional or even on an asset as part of its green push the fund has been developing an software called angle that can take data such as emissions combine it with trading data and earnings data and see how it will affect a company years ahead
that tool has informed divestments in some companies in fund ceo yngve slyngstad told reuters helping show that these companies did not have a sustainable business model over the
he did not name them
presentation material showed two of the divested companies were involved in palm oil one in rubber ten in power and one in intensity
the next step in the software s development first disclosed by reuters in october is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves
it is still in the works slyngstad said
smith ihenacho said companies were generally better at reporting data citing for instance banks and oil and gas companies as quite good examples
but others like power producers were lagging
there is still far to go for many companies to report at the level we would like to see she said
the fund itself emitted million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in via its ownership stakes roughly twice the amount emitted by norway in according to its annual responsible investment report released on thursday
in the fund voted against one or more resolutions put forward at percent of agms it attended last year roughly the same level as in
the fund said it voted against the ceo also holding the position of board chairman at amazon johnson johnson total procter gamble and pfizer among others
it also voted against executive pay proposals at jp morgan chase verizon astrazeneca and glaxosmithkline among others
