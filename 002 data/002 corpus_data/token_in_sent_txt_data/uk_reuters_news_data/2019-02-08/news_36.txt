analysis-roadblocks circle ramaphosa's plan to fix south africa's eskom
ramaphosa pledges to split hapless state utility lack of detail raises market concerns powerful unions parts of anc oppose reforms investors ratings agencies want concrete change parliamentary election to be held on may by alexander winning and joe brock johannesburg feb reuters south african president cyril ramaphosa s plan to split struggling state power utility eskom is a positive show of intent to investors but a lack of detail has raised market concerns that concrete change will take years to deliver
eskom which produces over percent of south africa s electricity and employs people is a lynchpin of africa s most developed economy but is drowning in billion of debt
facing a parliamentary election on may ramaphosa said on thursday that to avert an economic crisis eskom s generation transmission and distribution businesses would become separate entities
crucially ramaphosa added that the newly created units would remain under an eskom holding company meaning its inefficient and unwieldy monopoly would remain
he also said another eskom bailout would be laid out in the budget later this month
what markets were hoping for was the creation of three independent companies that could more easily cut costs raise finance and be partially privatised in the future
most eskom bonds eased very slightly on friday with the bond softening cent to trade at cents in the dollar
however eskom s bonds had chalked up stellar gains in previous weeks with many issues seeing their best monthly gains on record
the risk is very little will change in this structure said peter attard montalto head of capital markets research at intellidex
the intention may well be to have this as a first step and then separate out after that from the umbrella
however we think the market underestimates how complex this separation process will be he added forecasting it could take two years
even if ramaphosa intends eventually to create independent units that could be partly sold off he will face fierce resistance from elements of the ruling african national congress anc and powerful trade unions
the anc is expected to win may s election but ramaphosa will need the support of a united ruling party and union allies if he is to deliver the decisive victory that would give him a mandate to push through unpopular but reforms
the two largest unions at eskom who say they account for half of the utility s workforce said on friday they would fight ramaphosa s plan with one calling it a war
in the short term ramaphosa will need to raise eskom s revenues and cut its debt if he is to delay inevitable job cuts until after the election
that means tariff increases and bailouts that are toxic with voters
i agree with president that we need drastic action but we can t be paying for them screwing up all the time said thokozane a taxi driver in johannesburg
if they have to cut jobs it is sad but we can t go on year after year with these bailouts and ramaphosa is also trying to hold together the anc to avoid the fate of his predecessor jacob zuma whom he ousted a year ago in a bitter internal battle
the liberation movement remains deeply divided between socialist and reformist elements and ramaphosa faces resistance from a powerful faction
a task team formed by ramaphosa to create a reform programme for eskom recommended more policies than were announced however a backlash from members of his cabinet saw the plans diluted an anc source said
ramaphosa s opponents will be obstructing him every step of the way with his plan for eskom said darias jonker director for africa at eurasia group a political risk consultancy
this is yet another proxy war involving entrenched interests linked to the zuma faction in the it is likely ramaphosa will avoid major job cuts at eskom until after the election while the details of restructuring could be delayed so as not to rile allies analysts say
but with eskom expected to lose more than billion a year this year and next there is only so long ramaphosa can delay reforms without risking economic malaise investor departure and credit rating downgrades
the eskom issue needs a clear resolution and we did not get that yesterday said jonas david strategist at swiss bank ubs
