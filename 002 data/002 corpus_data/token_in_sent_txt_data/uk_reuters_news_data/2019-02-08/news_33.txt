the views expressed are his own cyclical indicators by john kemp london feb reuters policymakers and analysts who claim the outlook is unusually uncertain are normally overstating their own forecasting problem and understating the difficulties faced by their predecessors
the outlook always looks more certain in retrospect when the outcome is known and a causal chain can be constructed that makes it appear nearly inevitable than it does in prospect when multiple pathways look possible
unusually uncertain is often a fancy way of saying i don t know and concealing the limits of forecasting which is often much less reliable than policymakers and analysts would like their audience to believe
but there are times when it is genuinely more difficult to predict what will happen in future especially when systems approach turning points or inflection points
i am normally sceptical when policymakers and analysts say the outlook is unusually uncertain but at the moment they may actually be justified in making that claim with the economy delicately poised between moderation and recession and to even small shocks that could nudge it towards either eventuality
in both the economy and the oil market forecast accuracy deteriorates around cyclical turning points which is why almost all forecasters missed the onset of the last recession in or the collapse in oil prices in
for the same reason most forecasters missed the slump in oil prices in the middle of the recovery in oil prices from early or the renewed fall in prices during late
the largest errors in forecasts of real and nominal gdp growth inflation and the unemployment rate are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points particularly peaks wrote business cycle expert victor zarnowitz
many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense that they miss the turns and underestimate recessions and leading indicators rarely miss major turns in economic activity but they now and then err in giving false signals of recession or less often recovery business cycles theory history indicators and forecasting zarnowitz
however even leading indicators may struggle to discriminate between a true turning point where the cycle changes direction and an inflection point where the cycle continues in same direction but with a change of rate
in the vicinity of a turning point or an inflection the economy and the oil market can become very sensitive to even small changes in conditions and sentiment which contributes to the increased forecasting difficulty
the global economy and the oil market both now show clear signs of a slowdown
every leading indicator tells the same story of a sharp loss of momentum in the second half of after strong growth in
but all those indicators for the economy and the oil market are in a range that could be consistent with either an imminent recession or a renewed acceleration after a period of sluggish growth
with every indicator poised between a true turning point in the cycle or simply an inflection in the growth rate there is no way to discriminate in advance
the shape of the treasury yield curve is one commonly employed leading indicator for predicting recessions in the united states
based on the current shape of the yield curve the federal reserve bank of new york estimates there is a percent probability the economy will be in recession in january
the forecast probability of recession has more than doubled over the last year and risen six times over the last two years and is now unusually elevated
but the forecast probability is still well below the percent hit in the run up to the recessions of or
the probability looks more like the elevated risk in which turned into a recession or and which did not
based on the yield curve it is impossible to say whether the economy is heading for an turning point or a temporary slowdown
the equity market is similarly hovering uncertainly between an slowdown and an turning point
the s p equity index is now down slightly over the last months after strong gains during and most of
the flattening of equity prices is certainly consistent with a slowdown in the economic and corporate earnings outlook but is not yet at levels that preceded the recessions of or
manufacturing surveys show a loss of momentum at the end of and the start of a warning sign but the composite activity indicators are still well below the levels that preceded the last three recessions
even the job market indicators are ambiguous
employment is rising at around percent per year faster than the percent reported months earlier but fairly slow compared with earlier expansions
if the economy is performing relatively well most of the rest of the global economy is performing relatively poorly but not so badly that we can confidently predicted a recession rather than a slowdown
china s official purchasing managers index shows manufacturing activity has been losing momentum for the last year and actually contracted in december and january but only slightly
globally purchasing managers indicators show new export orders have been losing momentum since the start of and have now fallen for five months in a row
but the declines in orders have been relatively small so far and could be consistent with an slowdown such as or rather than a full recession like or
air freight indicators also point to or falling volumes in after strong growth in and but do not yet show the large falls associated with the last two recessions
like the rest of the economy the oil market appears to be poised uncertainly between the probability of a supply surplus or a deficit
opec s aggressive output cuts coupled with sanctions on iran and venezuela have offset the feared slowdown in oil consumption growth and eliminated much of the incipient surplus in
brent s calendar spread has returned close to flat after collapsing from backwardation into contango during the fourth quarter suggesting traders currently see the oil market close to balance this year
brent spreads cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between periods of and they do not usually stay close to flat for very long
but the outlook is poised between fears about a slowdown in consumption and concerns about supply losses from iran and venezuela as well as opec cuts and a possible slowdown in shale growth
the global economic outlook is the single biggest source of uncertainty for the oil market and until that source of uncertainty is resolved or at least reduced the oil outlook remains equally unclear
