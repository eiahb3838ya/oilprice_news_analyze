exclusive-u.s. in direct contact with venezuelan military, urging  defections -source
washington feb reuters the united states is holding direct communications with members of venezuela s military urging them to abandon leader nicolas maduro and is also preparing new sanctions aimed at increasing pressure on him a senior white house official said
the trump administration expects further military defections from maduro s side the official told reuters in an interview despite only a few senior officers having done so since opposition leader juan guaido proclaimed himself interim president last month earning the recognition of the united states and dozens of other countries
we believe these to be those first couple pebbles before we start really seeing bigger rocks rolling down the hill the official said this week speaking on condition of anonymity
we re still having conversations with members of the former maduro regime with military members although those conversations are very very the official declined to provide details on the discussions or the level at which they are being held and it was unclear whether such contacts could create cracks in the venezuelan socialist leader s support from the military which is pivotal to his grip on power
with the venezuelan military still apparently loyal to maduro a source in washington close to the opposition expressed doubts whether the trump administration has laid enough groundwork to spur a wider mutiny in the ranks where many officers are suspected of benefiting from corruption and drug trafficking
guaido says the may vote in which maduro won a second term as president was a sham and on invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president promising free and fair elections
the government also sees european allies as likely to do more to prevent maduro from transferring or hiding venezuela government assets held outside the country the official said
major european countries have joined the united states in backing guaido but they have stopped short of the sweeping oil sanctions and financial measures that washington has imposed
at the same time the trump administration is readying further possible sanctions on venezuela the official said
previous rounds have targeted dozens of venezuelan military and government officials including maduro himself and last month finally hit the opec member s vital oil sector
but the administration has stopped short of imposing secondary sanctions which would punish companies for doing business with the venezuela government or the state oil monopoly pdvsa
the official said that washington had every tool available to apply pressure on maduro and his associates to accept a legitimate democratic the government is also weighing possible sanctions on cuban military and intelligence officials whom it says are helping maduro remain in power a second official and person familiar with the deliberations have told reuters
maduro s government has accused guaido who has galvanized venezuela s opposition of attempting to stage a coup
general francisco yanez of the air force s high command became the first active venezuelan general to recognize guaido but he is one of about generals
venezuela s chief military attache to the united states also said he was defecting late last month
guaido has actively courted members of the military with promises of amnesty and preferential legal treatment if they disavow maduro and disobey his orders and washington this week raised the prospect of dropping sanctions on senior venezuelan officers if they recognize guaido
maduro still has the support of the military high command and now routinely appears in events at military bases where officers stand behind him and chant triumphal slogans such as loyal always traitors reporting by matt spetalnick luc cohen and roberta rampton additional reporting by brian ellsworth in caracas editing by mary milliken and grant mccool
