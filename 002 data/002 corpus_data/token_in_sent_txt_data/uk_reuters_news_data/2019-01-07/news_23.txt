update 1-egypt foreign reserves drop for first time post-devaluation
adds analysts background by lena masri cairo jan reuters egypt s foreign currency reserves fell to billion in december from billion in november the central bank said on monday the first drop since a currency devaluation
the last time egypt s foreign currency reserves fell was in october the month before it signed a billion deal with the international monetary fund that included a currency float
that deal was part of an effort to attract foreign investors who fled during egypt s uprising
the central bank did not give reasons for the drop
it was a surprise naeem brokerage head of research allen sandeep said of the development adding he was unsure of the reasons
egypt expects to receive the fifth instalment of its imf loan worth billion in january
that tranche will offset december s drop sandeep forecast
in january i would think it would go back to the billion mark he said
the fifth tranche had been expected in december and the delay has likely contributed to the drop in reserves said alia mamdouh director of macro and strategy at beltone financial
i don t think it s alarming because we are expecting the tranche to be disbursed in january and billion euro bonds are expected to be issued in the first half of this year she said
the central bank also had outstanding liabilities of billion in december that would have contributed to the decrease in foreign reserves said mamdouh
egypt has been pursuing tough economic reforms as part of the imf programme
in addition to the currency devaluation reforms have included new taxes and deep cuts to energy subsidies straining the budget of tens of millions of egyptians
