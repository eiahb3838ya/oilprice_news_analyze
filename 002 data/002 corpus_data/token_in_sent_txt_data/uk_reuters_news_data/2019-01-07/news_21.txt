update 4-elliott bids $2.07 bln for permian basin producer qep resources
houston reuters hedge fund elliott management corp on monday offered to buy qep resources inc which has a big presence in the permian basin near major energy producers for billion or per share percent above the stock s closing price on friday
qep resources shares surged after the offer was made in a letter to the company s board
the proposal could force the company to put itself up for sale according to a person close to the elliott camp
the letter said qep remained undervalued despite its efforts to focus on the permian basin the largest oil field where its operations are more lucrative than in other regions where it is selling properties
after the offer from billionaire activist investor paul singer s elliott shares of the qep jumped percent to on monday afternoon
the new hedge fund has a percent stake in qep according to refinitiv data
qep in a statement acknowledged receiving the proposal and said it would carefully consider it in light of shareholder interests and the current market
qep s shares traded above as recently as july when benchmark crude oil traded above
since then crude has since fallen more than percent and last traded below
elliott would run qep as an independent private company if the deal goes through according to the source close to the hedge fund
elliott believes the company s permian acreage could attract competing bids according to the person
qep s acres in the permian are contiguous making it easier to drill horizontal wells that extend up to two miles
neighboring operators include exxon mobil corp encana corp and diamondback energy inc
all three companies could make a case that the qep assets would fold in to their permian operations said jeoffrey lambujon a equity researcher at tudor pickering holt and oil has plunged since october as investors worried about oversupply and fears of an economic slowdown
if crude prices remain weak it would be harder for qep to get a competing bid said williams capital group analyst gabriele sorbara
prices rebounded percent on monday on opec production cuts and steadying equities markets
while its bid offers a healthy exit opportunity for current investors elliott s letter to the board is clearly a preliminary step in the negotiation process raymond james said in a research note
elliott specializes in buying undervalued assets
in december elliott and siris capital bid to take travelport worldwide private in an deal valuing the travel technology company at billion
qep as a investment has not worked and its stock continues to trade well below its intrinsic value elliott wrote in a letter addressed to the board
last year qep decided to sell its williston oil asset in north dakota montana and the canadian province of saskatchewan as well as the haynesville gas asset in texas and louisiana
it wanted to focus solely on the permian basin the oilfield that has been at the heart of the shale boom
the elliott offer is conditional on closing the haynesville asset sale but not on the closure of the williston asset sale the hedge fund said in its letter
