pakistan says uae's financial assistance to shore up economy
islamabad jan reuters a loan facility from the united arab emirates uae will help pakistan bridge a yawning current account deficit and shore up foreign reserves pakistan s chief government spokesman said on monday
the uae s crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan visited islamabad on sunday and confirmed a billion loan package first announced last month
the billion package which has already been announced was formalised the government s top spokesman information minister fawad chaudhry told a news conference
chaudhry did not give any details about any further assistance through deferred oil payments which he said late last year the uae would be extending to pakistan on top of the loan
nor did he give details of the interest rate on the billion loan
however pakistan s daily dawn quoted chaudhry as saying the loan had been given on an interest rate of percent and that the uae would be giving another billion for the supply of oil on deferred payment
pakistan has been facing an economic crisis due to depleting foreign reserves and a widening current account deficit since the government of prime minister imran khan took office in august
khan who has been critical of foreign loans throughout his political career had no option but to seek financial support from friendly countries besides approaching the international monetary fund imf for a bailout
pakistan secured a billion loan from saudi arabia and a similar amount every year in oil supply on deferred payment for three years
pakistan has also been trying to get loans from neighbouring china which has pledged nearly billion for energy and road and rail infrastructure projects as part of the belt and road initiative bri known as china pakistan economic corridor cpec
last week in response to a financial times report that china had agreed to lend pakistan billion to bolster foreign exchange reserves foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said china would continue to provide support to pakistan in the form of aid trade investment and in other ways
after several rounds of talks late last year discussions with the imf broke for unexplained reasons although pakistan said it was already taking most of the steps the imf required including steps to bridge the budget deficit more revenue collection and devaluation of the rupee
pakistan expects the talks to resume this month
