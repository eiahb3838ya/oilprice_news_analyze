update 1-venezuela's pdvsa in oil deal with firm part-owned by florida republican
caracas reuters venezuelan state oil firm pdvsa has signed a deal with energy firm erepla partly owned by a prominent florida republican to help increase the country s plummeting crude oil output the company said
erepla services llc with an undisclosed stake held by republican harry sargeant iii and which delaware state records show was only registered in november said it plans to invest up to million to increase production at three venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced
sargeant and petr√≥leos de venezuela known as pdvsa have clashed in the past
between and pdvsa was awarded million after a company partly owned by sargeant was accused of not paying for several crude shipments in and court records show
the new arrangement faces significant hurdles including obtaining an exemption from trump administration sanctions that block companies from providing financing to the government of president nicolas maduro or venezuelan state firms
it is a further sign that venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about sanctions and overall dysfunction
erepla said the agreement will revitalize oil production at the tia juana lago and rosa mediano fields in the western lake maracaibo region and in the ayacucho bloc in the eastern orinoco belt
the company added that the deal gives it enhanced managerial participation in the projects and will be responsible for procurement a key difference from joint ventures between pdvsa and oil majors like chevron corp where pdvsa has full operational control
erepla said it would be responsible for the entirety of the a spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds
neither pdvsa nor the oil ministry responded to requests for comment
the erepla spokesman said sargeant who has served as finance chairman of the florida republican party and runs asphalt trading and shipping firm global oil management group owns a stake in erepla but declined to reveal the percentage
the deal is the first new partnership between pdvsa and a private company since oil minister manuel quevedo in august announced a set of joint service agreements with companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and pdvsa
those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader hugo chavez who expanded the state s role in the opec country s energy industry
output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed dropping to million barrels per day in november from more than million at the end of last year according to opec figures in a sign of the company s struggles under military rule
washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on venezuela that block citizens from providing financing to maduro s government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment
but because pdvsa is perennially agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of upfront funding that could run afoul of sanctions
erepla said it had applied to the treasury department s office of foreign assets control which implements sanctions for a specific license affirming the the treasury department generally does not comment on individual license applications or the timeline for reviewing them a treasury spokesperson said
the erepla spokesman said the firm s ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining erepla said its minority owner is an international oil company that produces over barrels per day in a terrain similar to the venezuelan fields but the spokesman declined to name the owner
sargeant maintained business ties to pdvsa in the early through a company that he partly owned called trigeant whose corpus christi refinery processed venezuelan crude into asphalt according to court records
pdvsa won arbitration claims against trigeant in and totaling million for unpaid crude cargoes and received a million payment according to court records
before having paid the full amount trigeant sold the refinery to a third party
pdvsa won a court order blocking the sale arguing that it was a fraudulent transfer meant to prevent it from collecting on the arbitration judgment because sargeant had a controlling stake in the buyer
trigeant later declared bankruptcy and an attorney for sargeant said he ultimately made pdvsa ultimately harry iii resolved pdvsa s claims to their satisfaction chris kise a partner at foley lardner said by phone
maduro who has deepened venezuela s relationships with adversaries like russia and china often accuses the united states of plotting to overthrow him and steal the opec nation s oil wealth
the deal has been criticized by hardline chavez supporters who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company
this is the worst giveaway in the history of our country s oil industry former oil minister rafael ramirez wrote in a blog post on sunday
maduro and quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our additional reporting by mayela armas and corina pons in caracas editing by susan thomas and richard chang
