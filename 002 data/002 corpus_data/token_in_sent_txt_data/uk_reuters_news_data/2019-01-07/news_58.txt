update 1-air quality worsens in china's henan province, improves elsewhere
shanghai reuters air pollution in china s province of henan worsened in december even as other regions improved official data showed with its cities hit by unfavorable weather and a struggle to find cleaner sources of economic growth
china is restricting industrial output traffic and coal consumption in the north for a second year in a bid to cut pollution during the winter heating period when thousands of mainly boilers are switched on
but nine cities in henan home to around million people still recorded a rise in small emissions known as to an average of micrograms per cubic meter in the last month of up percent from a year earlier
emissions in the cities which include several big steel aluminum and coal producing districts had already soared by percent from a year earlier in november according to a reuters analysis of official data
as many as cities throughout the north and east have drawn up plans to control smog this winter with many committed to cutting emissions by percent from last year
for these cities average levels fell percent in december from a year earlier to micrograms per cubic meter according to reuters calculations although still nearly double china s national standard of micrograms
but the local increases in henan and elsewhere show how much cities are at the mercy of the weather with conditions such as high humidity and low wind exacerbating smog
my analysis indicates that the rises in henan are accounted for by the weather said lauri myllyvirta energy analyst with greenpeace
henan s smog concentrations have worsened since the end of last year with the local government saying on saturday that provincial cities have issued red alerts for the coming week
some cities in the major pollution control zone around china s capital beijing are also struggling to meet winter air quality targets with average in the last two months of up percent compared with a year earlier
the zone includes the country s top steel producing province of hebei where average emissions rose percent in the last two months of
hebei has promised to cut by percent this year compared to the official hebei daily reported on monday citing the local environmental bureau
it vowed to cut another million tonnes of steel smelting capacity and million tonnes of coal production after shutting million tonnes and million tonnes respectively in
the province said last week it had cut by percent to an average of micrograms over the whole of beating its target
