update 6-u.s., china can reach trade deal 'we can live with' -u.s. commerce secretary
reuters commerce secretary wilbur ross predicted on monday that beijing and washington could reach a trade deal that we can live with as dozens of officials from the world s two largest economies resumed talks in a bid to end their trade dispute
ross told cnbc the immediate trade issues would be easiest to tackle while enforcement issues and structural reforms such as intellectual property rights and market access would be more challenging to resolve
i think there s a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement that china can live with that we can live with and that addresses all of the key issues ross said in an interview with cnbc
china s foreign ministry said beijing had the good faith to work with the united states to resolve trade frictions as chinese officials met their counterparts in beijing for the first talks since president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed in december to a truce in a trade war that has roiled global markets
after the first day of talks wrapped up chinese importers made their third large purchase of soybeans in the past month traders said
but china has bought only around million tonnes since purchases resumed in december less than percent of the beans it bought a year earlier
trump said on sunday that trade talks with china were going very well and that weakness in the chinese economy gave beijing a reason to work towards a deal
ross told cnbc the talks were being held with staff and would help determine how the administration moves forward
the two sides agreed to hold positive and constructive dialogue to resolve economic and trade disputes in accordance with the consensus reached by their respective leaders foreign ministry spokesman lu kang told a regular news briefing
from the beginning we have believed that trade friction is not a positive situation for either country or the world economy
china has the good faith on the basis of mutual respect and equality to resolve the bilateral trade trump imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese goods last year and has threatened more to pressure beijing to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property to hacking
china has retaliated with tariffs of its own
as for whether the chinese economy is good or not i have already explained this
china s development has ample tenacity and huge potential lu said
we have firm confidence in the strong fundamentals of the chinese lu also said vice president wang qishan would attend the annual world economic forum in davos switzerland in late january but added that he had not yet heard of any arrangements for a meeting with trump there
few details emerged of the trade talks which were scheduled to run through tuesday
although the talks were held at a vice ministerial level chinese vice premier liu he who has led trade negotiations with the united states and is a top economic adviser to xi made an unexpected appearance at the meetings on monday according to a person familiar with the discussions
leaked photographs posted on the south china morning post s website showed officials applauding liu s appearance including the delegation leader deputy trade representative jeffrey gerrish
another photo shows a wider view of dozens of officials from each country seated at three long tables facing each other and around the room s borders significantly more people than those attending previous rounds of trade talks
a source familiar with the talks said this could indicate that more detailed discussions were likely taking place
the delegation includes under secretaries from the departments of agriculture commerce energy and treasury as well as senior officials from the white house
secretary of state mike pompeo told cnbc that the united states and china are making progress on trade
i hope too that we ll make progress on all of the other places whether china s not behaving in the way that we wish it would whether that s their cyber activity that has had a real impact whether that s the theft of intellectual property which has hurt american businesses
tu xinquan a chinese trade expert at beijing s university of international business and economics told reuters before talks began that the meetings would likely focus on technical issues and leave major disagreements to more senior officials
data last week showed manufacturing has slowed in both china and the united states though the labour department on friday reported a surge in new jobs in december along with higher wages
officials have given scant details on concessions that china might be willing to make to meet demands some of which would require structural reforms unpalatable for chinese leaders
even if a trade agreement is reached soon analysts say it would be no panacea for china s economy which is expected to continue decelerating in coming months
