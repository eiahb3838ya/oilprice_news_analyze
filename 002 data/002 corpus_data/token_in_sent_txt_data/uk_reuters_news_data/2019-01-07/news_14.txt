update 3-u.s. top court rejects exxon in climate change document dispute
reuters the supreme court on monday cleared the way for the attorney general of massachusetts to obtain records from exxon mobil corp to probe whether the oil company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change
the justices declined to hear exxon s appeal of a ruling by the top court in massachusetts holding that state attorney general maura healey a democrat had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the company misled consumers and investors
the high court s action marked the latest setback for exxon in its efforts to halt the massachusetts investigation and a similar one by new york s attorney general who in october filed a lawsuit against the company
the law is clear
the attorney general s office has the authority to investigate exxon s conduct toward consumers and investors and we are proceeding
the public deserves answers from this company about what it knew about the impacts of burning fossil fuels and when said chloe gotsis a spokeswoman for healey

those news reports by insideclimate news and the los angeles times were based on documents from the and
exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions
healey in issued a civil investigative demand to exxon seeking documents to investigate whether it had violated the state s law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products
exxon said that because it is incorporated in texas and new jersey healey had no basis to seek documents to conduct a investigation
