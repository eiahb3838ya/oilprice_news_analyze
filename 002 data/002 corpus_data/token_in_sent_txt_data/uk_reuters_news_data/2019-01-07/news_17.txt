update 3-brazilian government denies to pay $14 billion to petrobras
sao paulo reuters brazil s economy ministry denied that the government would pay billion to oil company petroleo brasileiro sa to settle a dispute over an zone off the brazilian coast known as the area
the ministry told reuters in a statement the figure reported on monday by the valor economico newspaper was only one of several proposals passed to the transition team of president jair bolsonaro by his predecessor michel temer
the final amount has not yet been decided the ministry said
the report that billion had been agreed to settle the dispute helped boost the common shares of petrobras as the company is known as much as percent
common shares closed monday percent up and preferred rose percent against a percent decline in the benchmark bovespa index
settling on a figure would be a major step forward in the dispute and help petrobras cut its sizeable net debt which stood at billion as of the third quarter
at times during negotiations petrobras has claimed that it is owed as much as billion while parts of the government has said petrobras owed money to the state
on wednesday mines and energy minister bento albuquerque said he expected the dispute to be resolved within days and that petrobras was the creditor in the dispute
the amount petrobras was owed and the form of payment was still under discussion he added
a dispute over the area in question dates back to when the brazilian government granted petrobras the right to extract billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore santos basin
the government received additional shares in petrobras in return based on oil prices at the time
the volume of oil in the area is now estimated to be much larger however and the government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil
the choice reserves can not be auctioned until the government and petrobras resolve a dispute over the transaction
among other things the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated
