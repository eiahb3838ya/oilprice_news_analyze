update 1-iraq sends money to pay kurdish salaries for first time since 2014
adds quotes background by raya jalabi and ahmed rasheed baghdad march reuters iraq sent money to pay salaries of state employees in the kurdish region on monday for the first time since the baghdad government said although a dispute over how much it will send the kurds in future remains unresolved
monday s agreement represents a step towards normalising relations between the central government and the autonomous kurdish region which held a vote for independence last year that the central government swiftly crushed
under the constitution the kurdish region is entitled to a share of the national budget
but that arrangement collapsed in when iraq s army fled the north in the face of an advance by islamic state militants
the kurds seized control of iraq s main northern oil fields at kirkuk from islamic state and began selling kirkuk s oil independently baghdad stopped sending money to the kurds
last year after islamic state was driven out of the north the kurds held an independence referendum voting overwhelmingly to secede
but the central government responded by swiftly launching a military offensive and recapturing control of kirkuk which quashed the kurdish independence bid
the central government and the kurds have yet to agree on a full plan to resume payments from baghdad to the kurdish region
the budget passed in parliament earlier this month despite a boycott by kurdish lawmakers calls for the percent of total revenue allocated to the kurds to be cut in line with the region s share of iraq s population which is disputed
the kurdish region still conducts independent oil sales although it has far less oil to sell now that it no longer controls kirkuk
the federal finance ministry transferred a cash sum of billion iraqi dinars million to the region s finance ministry baghdad government spokesman saad said
hadithi said the transfer would cover the kurdistan regional government s krg salaries for a month for employees of all ministries and for the peshmerga kurdish security forces
in a statement the krg said its finance ministry had received the transfer and would distribute it
asked about future payments to the krg to cover salaries hadithi said the federal government would agree to pay a portion while the rest should be covered by the krg from its oil sales
other measures imposed by baghdad to curtail the kurdish region s autonomy in the wake of last year s referendum are gradually being eased including a ban on direct international flights which was lifted last week
the first international flight landed at erbil airport on monday morning
however the issues of the krg s independent oil sales and share of the budget remain unresolved
baghdad has sent teams of auditors to kurdistan in recent months to assess the number of employees on the region s payroll
a statement from the prime minister s office announcing the agreement on monday specified that the audit was ongoing
