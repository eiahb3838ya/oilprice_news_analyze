interview-varo bets on european refining despite peak oil demand fears
london reuters electric vehicles and stricter marine fuel regulations are generally not perceived as good news for the oil refining industry
but the head of european downstream firm varo energy roger brown says he believes the complete opposite
at least for the
varo which has refineries and storage assets in western europe announced on monday that it would list in amsterdam this year
its shareholders which include private equity firm carlyle and oil trading merchant vitol plan to sell a combined percent of stock on euronext
the company could be valued at billion euros billion according to banking sources
brown a veteran bp trader who was hired as varo chief executive in believes some refiners could benefit from forecasts of a peak in oil demand within a generation
i don t think many people will build new refineries amid all the talk about peak oil demand
so hence current refiners will have to run at full capacity said brown
many commodity traders oil companies and analysts expect oil consumption to slow in years to come as sales of electric vehicles accelerate and wind and solar power provide more of the world s electricity
some predict oil demand will peak some time after
another challenge for the refining industry is upcoming stricter regulations for marine fuel which will drastically reduce the use of fuel oil for shipping but increase the use of diesel
brown says that too would present an opportunity for the refining industry in europe as existing refineries would need to fill the additional demand for diesel in the shipping sector
varo which saw underlying earnings rise to million last year from million in owns two refineries in switzerland and germany and storage blending and distribution assets in those two countries as well as the benelux nations and france
varo has made nine acquisitions since being set up in and brown says more are coming
on monday varo said it intended to pay out a dividend of percent of its profit after tax and achieve over the medium term high growth in underlying earnings
the company wants to invest percent of its free cashflow in organic and inorganic growth
the company had revenues of billion in up from billion in
varo run as a standalone business from vitol has the trader as its sole crude supplier
brown says the deal with vitol was extended until and the trader is obliged to supply varo at the lowest available price in the market while varo will also fully hedge oil price refining margins and foreign exchange risks
brown says he sees a lot of scope for growth as several storage businesses in europe are considering selling out due to a lack of succession planning and the high costs of keeping assets in compliance with stringent regulations in europe
varo has focused on upgrading refineries developing biofuel terminals and optimising value chains
a lot of us at varo remember bp s integration days under former ceo john browne
we worked on integrating castrol mobil europe and veba oil
what we learnt is that you can not build bridges
you need full integration said brown
margins tend to move up and down from refiner to terminal
so having an integrated business model helps taking a lot of market volatility out of your results he added
