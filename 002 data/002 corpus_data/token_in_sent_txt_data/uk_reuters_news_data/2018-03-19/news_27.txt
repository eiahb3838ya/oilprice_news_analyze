update 1-german grid operator tennet's cross-border capacity under eu microscope
reuters eu antitrust authorities are investigating whether limits placed by german grid operator tennet on electricity capacity with denmark breaches eu antitrust rules
the european commission said it has constructive dialogue with german transmission system company tennet a subsidiary of tennet holding the dutch operator of electrical grids in the netherlands and germany
we ve had several complaints from danish producers who say they want to supply power to our neighbours but can not get access europe s antitrust commissioner margrethe vestager said at a press briefing in copenhagen on monday
we suspect that access is deliberately decreased when too much power is tennet controls percent of the network capacity of mw
vestager added
tennet responded with a statement saying that the border suffered from transmission bottlenecks adding that transmission capacities were stretched to the limit because of market liberalisation and the transition to renewable energy
the company said the eu investigation will include calculations on whether capacities approved under european law put foreign providers at an unfair disadvantage
the examination can therefore set a precedent for all border connections in europe it added
power producers in denmark sweden and norway have long complained of limited access to the power link between western denmark and northern germany according to lobby group danish energy
germany has for years prevented danish swedish and norwegian producers in supplying green energy to the rest of europe said anders stouge deputy director of danish energy
in when access was limited to mw lost revenue for nordic power producers amounted to about million danish crowns million stouge said
a temporary solution was found last year gradually raising access to percent of capacity until
we are pleased that the commission is looking into this but hope that this won t be used as a chance to quit the temporary solution agreed last year he said
tennet said it will submit concrete solutions on monday including an extension of the temporary solution agreed last year
danish power transmission company was not immediately available for comment
