brussels march reuters german grid company tennet is working with the european commission to find solutions to grid issues for which it is under antitrust investigation by brussels it said on monday
eu antitrust authorities on monday launched an investigation into whether limits placed by tennet a subsidiary of tennet holding the dutch operator of electrical grids in the netherlands and germany on electricity capacity with denmark breaches eu antitrust rules
tennet said the border suffered from transmission bottlenecks adding that transmission capacities were stretched to the limit because of market liberalisation and the transition to renewable energy
a statement from tennet said the eu investigation will include calculations on whether capacities approved under european law put foreign providers at an unfair disadvantage
the examination can therefore set a precedent for all border connections in europe it added
