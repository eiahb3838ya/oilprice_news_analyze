exclusive-rough justice? uk snubs call for gas storage capacity review
london reuters britain has rebuffed calls from the gas industry for an urgent review of the country s gas storage capacity after a cold snap this month triggered warnings of supply shortages and gas prices spiked to their highest in at least a decade
operators of gas storage sites industries reliant on gas and developers of new storage projects have been asking for an inquiry since november following the closure of the rough site that provided percent of britain s gas storage capacity
they met officials from the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis on friday but the government declined to open an inquiry saying market forces would ensure there was enough gas according to two people who attended the meeting and a third who was briefed on the outcome
the government says it is up to the market to determine whether it makes sense to invest in new gas storage and if there are any supply shortages prices will rise sufficiently to attract more gas from elsewhere
there is still a level of complacency in the government that despite recent events the best course of action is to just accept these price shocks said clive moffatt of consultancy moffatt associates who attended the meeting and represents several storage developers and industry associations
a spokeswoman for beis said the march meeting was not in response to any recent events and no inquiry into gas price and supply security was planned
we take gas security of supply seriously which is why we regularly and comprehensively test our assumptions and the latest evidence she said
the surge in gas prices on march came days after the government which is under pressure to lower heating bills introduced a law in parliament that would cap energy costs for million households for up to five years
the price spikes also come at a time of increased focus on the security of imports following tension with one of europe s main gas suppliers russia as well as fears britain s departure from the european union could hit gas imports at crunch times
home power bills have doubled in britain over the past decade to an average of about pounds a year
wholesale energy prices make up about percent of domestic bills meaning price rises are likely to affect some consumers
utility company centrica closed rough in june saying it had become too costly to maintain the offshore site leaving britain with storage capacity equivalent to four to five days of winter demand down from days previously
natural gas is used to heat about percent of britain s homes fuels as much as half of the country s electricity generation at times and is vital for several industries such as ceramics and chemicals
britain s storage levels however are well below most european countries
germany has the largest capacity with some billion cubic meters times that of britain while other european countries such as italy keep strategic gas reserves
for the size of our gas market we have pitifully low storage levels said trevor sikorski analyst at consultancy energy aspects
a decade ago domestic north sea production provided almost of britain s gas meaning storage was less of an issue
but dwindling reserves mean britain provided less than half of the gas it used in and that could drop to under percent by according to national grid
the rough closure means when gas demand peaks or supplies falter there is no large buffer to ensure all immediate needs can be met leading to huge spikes in wholesale prices
when national grid issued a deficit warning on march the wholesale price for gas for immediate delivery trgbnbpwkd hit pence per therm up from pence the previous week
data compiled by reuters shows the closing price for the contract has averaged pence per therm over the current winter season the first since rough closed more than percent higher than the average price for the winter season
britain s national grid the company that owns the transmission network for electricity and gas and balances supply and demand argues that storage is no panacea
you can only withdraw a certain amount of storage in one day so the day s demand would never be met by storage alone a spokeswoman for national grid said
she said on any given day britain could get gas from its north sea reserves from norway via pipelines linked to continental europe from shipments of liquefied natural gas lng or from storage
it is this mix that enables security of supply she said
operators of existing sites have warned that britain s storage capacity could get even tighter in the coming years without government intervention either to help keep sites operating or to subsidise the construction of new ones
the difference between gas prices in summer and winter has narrowed over the last few years in britain making it less profitable to buy gas in the warmer months store it and sell when temperatures fall and prices rise operators said
the economics of the uk s gas storage sites are challenging putting a question mark over the remaining sites said a spokesman for utility sse whose aldbrough and hornsea sites provide about percent the remaining capacity
companies planning new storage sites want the government to determine how much capacity britain needs to ensure supply and prevent price spikes and then find ways to maintain it
if the need for a certain level of storage is identified then the government could create something similar to its power capacity auction which pays electricity generators a subsidy to ensure they have availability when needed stag energy founder and managing director george grant said
stag energy a power generation and infrastructure company is planning to build an million pound underground gas storage site in the irish sea connected to britain s gas market
we are seeking a comprehensive study into gas price security and what the appropriate level of storage for the uk should be grant said
proponents of greater gas storage have also raised concerns about britain s reliance on imports in the light of increased political tensions with russia following a nerve toxin attack on a former russian double agent on british soil
prime minister theresa may said last week britain was looking to countries other than russia for gas as part of steps being taken by london following the attack
the energy department says britain typically receives less than percent of its gas from russia which comes via pipelines from europe
but this year supplies of lng which are seen as one of the major sources of supply flexibility in the future are increasingly coming from russia
so far this year two russian lng cargoes have unloaded at british terminals for domestic consumption accounting for about a third of britain s lng imports in
other gas imports making up about half of total supply come via interconnectors with norway and continental europe but the latter could be affected by britain s departure from the european union in march
if there remains frictionless trade with the eu via the interconnectors following brexit then it diminishes the case for domestic storage but this isn t certain thierry bros senior research fellow at the oxford institute for energy studies said
the eu operates a solidarity principle regarding gas which means in the event of a serious crisis member states are expected to help each other maintain supplies
if there is a crisis member states could hold on to gas stocks for their own supplies and there would be no obligation to ship to britain even if prices are higher he said
