feature-when the maasai met the maori: kenya seeks to end geothermal land conflicts
olkaria kenya march thomson reuters foundation as the maasai of kenya s great rift valley prepare to lose more land to a geothermal plant they hope to win a better deal this time after meeting the maori in new zealand
protests by the maasai known for dressing in red blankets and colourful beads halted construction in of kenya s olkaria v plant about km miles northwest of the capital nairobi on ancestral land sacred to community rituals
although building resumed after negotiations both sides are keen to improve relations so that the hot water under the soil can help to lift the maasai community who farm and herd cattle on the land above it out of poverty
the maori have conflicts but they ve found better ways to solve them said mwangi sururu who travelled to down south in november to see how the indigenous new zealanders kept their culture intact by partnering with energy firms
they were given a share in the power plants and the areas that were already being used for power production were leased directly from them said the maasai elder who was one of more than people evicted from their rift valley land in
kenya is africa s biggest geothermal producer
it aims by to triple its output of clean electricity made from generating stations that harness natural underground heat
this will require more geothermal plants
but further encroachment on land claimed by the maasai could cause conflicts if the process is not managed carefully said john maina of the renewable energy department at kenya s energy ministry
problems arise when the investor doesn t do thorough community engagement and participation maina told a public forum hosted by the university of nairobi
geothermal projects are very sensitive and people have to be moved because of the nature of the steam but this sometimes causes friction with the the exchange was arranged by power africa former president barack obama s signature africa energy initiative which aims to boost access to electricity in a continent where two in three people live without it
the maasai and the maori consider geothermal springs as critical to their way of life offering heat for cooking a place to treat ailments and a venue for traditional rituals
the maori said they faced similar threats to their lands but found ways to work with the plant operators
we are an indigenous community over here and we ve had some projects just like the maasai said desterney mana newton chairman of new zealand s ngati tahu tribal lands trust which administers blocks of maori land used for geothermal projects
we feel we can learn from each other he said by phone
benefits included taking up shares in companies investing in geothermal plants and monitoring their activities so that the maori way of life was not affected said newton who was part of the exchange programme
the maori also received dividends and revenue from annual rates paid for leases on their land he added
the maori have one key advantage over the maasai
under new zealand law they own the resources mined in their land sururu said while the maasai do not have the right to any underground resources all of which belong to the state
when the olkaria iv plant was being built kenya electricity generating company kengen relocated more than families including sururu s to a plot on kedong ranch about km away
the exercise was marred with controversy
an investigation by the world bank one of several international lenders found that evicted families were adversely affected
people were resettled to land which was less suitable for them than their older habitats its report said
kengen the country s biggest electricity generator said it has been holding meetings with maasai leaders every two months since to address community concerns
we are trying to find common meeting points said moses wekesa kengen s business development director adding that kengen can not ignore community concerns because it plans to build at least three more geothermal plants in olkaria
the east african nation is ramping up electricity production to keep up with growing demand for power and to reduce frequent blackouts
given the challenges in compensating the maasai with alternative plots of land kengen is vesting its hopes in other approaches including a bill tabled in parliament last month
it lays out a regime under which geothermal companies pay up to percent of revenue from a site into a fund for a decade with higher royalties in later years
the national government would take at least percent with percent for local governments and percent for the local community the energy bill says
the bill will help sururu said
kengen is already negotiating resettlement with people living on the proposed olkaria vi site said cyrus karingithi a resource development manager for the company
eventually they will have to move because the plant is something that benefits more than just a few people he said pointing at a plain beyond the olkaria iv plant
but negotiations have not been completed added maasai elder maenga kisotu
the maori have shown us how they live with the energy companies
