rpt-column-india shows crude battle is much more than opec vs u.s. shale: russell
repeats with no changes to text by clyde russell launceston australia march reuters the market narrative consuming crude oil markets currently is the interplay between supply cuts by opec and its allies and rising shale output with a side helping of chinese imports driving demand
while there are solid reasons for industry participants to focus on these dynamics there is also the risk of missing out on other factors that help shape the market
such a factor is india which has long flown below the radar of the crude oil market despite becoming the importer in the asian market behind china and the in the world after the united states
india is also a market where there is virtually no direct influence being exerted by shale oil as the south asian nation hardly imports any crude from the united states
it also imports a relatively small amount from russia the main ally in the agreement between the organization of the petroleum countries and other producers to limit output in order to drain excess global inventories thereby boosting crude prices
but what makes india important is that it s a major importer of middle eastern crudes and one of the demand centres in the world
and there are currently some worrying trends for middle eastern exporters to india especially for the region s top shipper saudi arabia
the international energy agency iea put india s crude oil demand at million barrels per day bpd in in its report released last month and estimated that this year will see demand rise to million bpd an increase of percent
the iea expects total world oil demand to increase by million bpd which makes india s expected growth of some bpd the most significant source of growth for crude producers outside of china s expected lift in demand of about bpd
india has traditionally bought the bulk of its crude oil from the middle east which makes sense give the geographic proximity and the decision of india s refiners to focus on processing heavier grades through complex plants in order to maximise the value of fuels produced
however despite the overall growth in india s crude demand in the volume of imports from the middle east dropped by percent to around million bpd according to data obtained from sources and compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
saudi arabia lost its status as india s biggest oil supplier with imports from the kingdom dropping percent to around bpd the data showed
other losers from the middle east included iran with a percent drop to bpd and the united arab emirates with a percent slump to bpd
the region s winner in exporting to india was iraq which increased percent to bpd most likely as a result of baghdad s willingness to offer deeper discounts on its heavier grades of crude compared to similar grades from other exporters
if the middle east overall was surrendering market share in india the main gainers were two latin american exporters with brazil s shipments jumping percent to bpd and those from mexico by percent to bpd
among smaller suppliers to india there were some impressive gains from countries such as egypt which was up percent to bpd sudan with a gain of percent to bpd and algeria which rose percent to bpd
while many of these increases were off very small volumes they have the potential to become more important in coming years
if brazil and mexico can compete in india despite a sea voyage of at least four times the distance when compared to cargoes from the persian gulf that should be a worry for middle east producers
india s refineries have shown they can be quite flexible in the crude slates they process and it appears that the output cuts instituted by opec and its allies is encouraging more diverse sources of supply
the risk for opec and its allies is that this sort of market share is hard to recover once the production cuts are lifted
and as india shows the battle is far more than just a simple opec and allies versus shale producers
