interview-development bank ebrd upbeat on lebanon, seeks continued reform
beirut reuters the european bank for reconstruction and development sees enormous prospects in lebanon but potential investors need to see progress on reform and over the border a process towards a settlement of syria s war the bank s president said
on his first visit since the ebrd began operating in lebanon in september ebrd president suma chakrabarti said he saw a role for the bank in financing small and enterprises and renewable energy energy efficiency and infrastructure projects
on thursday lebanon agreed its first two ebrd deals a percent equity investment in lebanon s largest lender bank audi and a million trade finance line with fransabank the
i think the prospects for the ebrd in lebanon are enormous he told reuters and added that the bank has not set an upper limit on investment in lebanon
it depends on the demand we get from private sector while the war in syria continues lebanon s biggest challenge will remain regional risk
providing lebanon continues with that economic reform process provided there is a process towards a settlement in syria i think the prospects are really good chakrabarti said
set up by governments in to invest in the economies of eastern europe and owned mainly by developed countries the ebrd has expanded its mandate in the last decade to operate in almost countries
lebanon joins egypt jordan morocco and tunisia in the ebrd s southern and eastern mediterranean semed region where it has invested more than billion euros billion in projects since
lebanon has one of the highest ratios in the world at about percent
growth and state revenues have been low for years undermined by war in neighbor syria and domestic political inertia
to help stimulate the economy lebanon is seeking up to billion for infrastructure this year from investors and donors
fundraising will begin with an april conference in paris
chakrabarti said the ebrd will voice support for lebanon in paris and is keen to invest further especially in public private partnership ppp projects
the billion can not be financed unless there are more ppps he said
chakrabarti said the ebrd and other lenders will be very much focussed on how lebanon implements promised reforms and projects
should believe that just having a conference in paris is a success in after agreeing a president and prime minister in late after years of political paralysis lebanon has passed its first budget since signed it first offshore oil and gas deals and signed a ppp law
chakrabarti said these developments have made him more confident than i would have been a couple of years ago
conversations we ve had suggest there actually is a consensus building that more reform is going to be lebanon is due to hold its first parliamentary elections since in early may
they will be held under a new electoral law making it harder to predict the outcome
people are talking very openly that they don t think the parliamentary elections will derail this process
even after the election we can expect a continued push in the right through equity in its investment in bank audi chakrabarti said the ebrd hopes to establish itself in lebanon s banking sector where it wants to help banks reach new customers
if lebanon is to achieve the rates of growth economic growth that it can do lending has to increase in the medium term without a doubt he said
a group of customers chakrabarti is passionate about reaching is women entrepreneurs
we have our women in business programs in countries
we have learned how to do this really well he said
chakrabarti said the ebrd can work well with lebanon s entrepreneurial spirit and its move towards a private development model
lebanon s capital investment plan also focuses on ebrd strengths energy infrastructure and smes
lebanon has hosted over a million refugees fleeing syria s conflict straining public services around the country
chakrabarti said the bank has been talking to the lebanese government about projects to help host communities and refugees
but this will require donors to contribute funds alongside the ebrd s loans
