enlist nature's help to quench world's growing thirst - u.n.
barcelona march thomson reuters foundation the world should look to nature for better ways to maintain supplies of water keep it clean and protect people from droughts and floods the united nations said on monday
as the global population expands and the planet warms demand for water is rising while the quality and reliability of our water supply is declining the edition of the world water development report has warned
one response is to invest more in protecting ecosystems that recycle water such as wetlands and vegetation and spend less on concrete flood barriers or wastewater treatment plants
audrey azoulay of the educational scientific and cultural organization unesco which coordinates the report called for new solutions to tackle emerging challenges to water security caused by population growth and climate change
if we do nothing some five billion people will be living in areas with poor access to water by she said in a statement
demand for water is expected to increase by nearly by said gilbert houngbo chair of in the report s foreword
to help manage competing demands for freshwater whether to quench human thirst water crops or produce electricity the report recommended working with nature rather than against it in a bid to make water use more efficient and healthier for people and the environment
for too long the world has turned first to or grey infrastructure to improve water management wrote houngbo
in so doing it has often brushed aside traditional and indigenous knowledge that embraces greener the report outlined the benefits of solutions which use or mimic natural processes to increase water availability improve its quality and reduce risks linked to disasters and climate change
those solutions include changing farming practices so the soil retains more moisture and nutrients harvesting rainwater aquifers conserving wetlands that capture runoff and decontaminate water restoring floodplains and turning rooftops into gardens
the report cited estimates that agricultural production could be increased by nearly percent worldwide if greener water management practices were used
richard connor of the report said switching to a conservation agriculture model could bring high and rapid returns but achieving it on a large scale would require political will at the national level
agriculture internationally remains dominated by industrial farming and it can be a little more difficult to influence the interests that are involved he told the thomson reuters foundation
but some companies were adopting more sustainable practices while consumers mainly in europe and north america increasingly prefer organic locally grown food he added
inside cities the challenge is to capture and filter more water using green infrastructure from water retention ponds to wild spaces that double up for leisure activities
and out of town in the basins on which cities rely water users like farmers need to cooperate with municipal authorities to ensure enough clean water for all
new york for example has protected its three biggest watersheds since the late resulting in an unfiltered water supply that brings savings of more than million per year on water treatment and maintenance costs the report said
grey infrastructure such as piped water to slums dams to control water flow on rivers or concrete walls to keep out big storm surges and floods would still be needed connor said
yet while growing amounts are spent on green infrastructure and other solutions evidence suggests they account for less than percent of total investment in infrastructure to manage water resources the report said
connor pointed to the extra advantages of using natural ways to manage water including the potential to boost biodiversity jobs health and carbon storage
if you start to look at these that often do not exist with grey infrastructure it should tip the investment decisions towards more solutions he said
