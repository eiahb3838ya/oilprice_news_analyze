update 3-iran's rouhani warns trump about 'mother of all wars'
dubai reuters iranian president hassan rouhani on sunday cautioned president donald trump about pursuing hostile policies against tehran saying war with iran is the mother of all wars but did not rule out peace between the two countries
iran faces increased pressure and looming sanctions after trump s decision to withdraw the united states from a international deal over iran s nuclear programme
addressing a gathering of iranian diplomats rouhani said mr trump don t play with the lion s tail this would only lead to regret the state new agency irna reported
america should know that peace with iran is the mother of all peace and war with iran is the mother of all wars rouhani said leaving open the possibility of peace between the two countries at odds since the islamic revolution
you are not in a position to incite the iranian nation against iran s security and interests rouhani said in an apparent reference to reported efforts by washington to destabilise iran s islamic government
in washington officials familiar with the matter told reuters that the trump administration had launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure iran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups
current and former officials said the campaign painted iranian leaders in a harsh light at times using information that is exaggerated or contradicts other official pronouncements including comments by previous administrations
rouhani scoffed at trump s threat to halt iranian oil exports and said iran has a dominant position in the gulf and the strait of hormuz a major oil shipping waterway
anyone who understands the rudiments of politics doesn t say we will stop iran s oil exports we have been the guarantor of the regional waterway s security throughout history rouhani said cited by the isna news agency
iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on saturday backed rouhani s suggestion that iran may block gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted
rouhani s apparent threat earlier this month to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries came in reaction to efforts by washington to force all countries to stop buying iranian oil
iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the strait of hormuz in retaliation for any hostile action
on sunday iran s ground forces commander became the latest military figure to back rouhani s apparent threat the news agency tasnim reported
the strait of hormuz region must either be safe for all or be insecure for everyone said general kioumars heydari quoted by tasnim
separately a top iranian military commander warned that the trump government might be preparing to invade iran
the enemy s behaviour is unpredictable tasnim quoted military chief of staff general mohammad baqeri as saying
although the current american government does not seem to speak of a military threat according to precise information it has been trying to persuade the military to launch a military invasion of iran baqeri said
iran s oil exports could fall by as much as by the end of the year because of new sanctions putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere
washington initially planned to shut iran out of global oil markets completely after trump abandoned the deal that limited iran s nuclear ambitions demanding all other countries stop buying iranian crude by november
but the united states has somewhat eased its stance saying it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on iranian supplies
