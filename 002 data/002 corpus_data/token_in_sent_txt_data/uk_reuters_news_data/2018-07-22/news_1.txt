update 1-us doubts ability of south sudan's president and rebel leader to bring peace
nairobi reuters the united states doubts whether south sudan s president salva kiir and rebel leader riek machar have the leadership qualities needed to deliver peace to the country at war since the white house said on sunday
peace talks last week in the south sudanese capital juba need to be more inclusive to succeed the white house said adding that it will impose fresh sanctions on anyone who threatens the country s stability
the statement constitutes tough language about south sudan a country whose independence in washington backed after a war with sudan that lasted decades
since then tens of thousands have been killed in a civil war
we are deeply concerned about the direction of the current peace process a narrow agreement between elites will not solve the problems plaguing south sudan said the statement
it implored the warring parties to implement a ceasefire as a first step and condemned a move by the country s parliament to extend the government s term in office
south sudan s political leaders have not demonstrated the leadership required to bring genuine peace we remain sceptical that they can oversee a peaceful and timely transition to democracy and good governance it said
on june a resolution at the united nations security council imposed an arms embargo

south sudan s parliament voted this month to extend kiir s mandate until a move likely to undermine the peace talks as opposition groups say the change is illegal
last week kiir said he is ready to accept a peace deal to end the war and set up an inclusive new government
the proposed deal would give the country five vice presidents and also covers security and power sharing arrangements
