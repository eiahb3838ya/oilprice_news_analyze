french orano opens uranium conversion plant despite glut
tricastin france reuters french nuclear group orano on monday inaugurated a billion euro billion pounds uranium conversion plant despite huge global overcapacity for nuclear reactor fuel
orano s new plant in tricastin southern france will account for a quarter of the world s annual uranium hexafluoride production capacity when it fully ramps up in and is set to have the industry s lowest costs the company said
produced by combining yellowcake uranium ore concentrate with fluorine is a precursor of enriched uranium which fuels the world s nuclear plants
following the fukushima disaster in japan uranium prices are near decade lows as several countries reduced their reliance on nuclear energy
in november honeywell international inc suspended production at its capacity metropolis illinois plant the only such conversion plant in the united states
orano formerly called areva in december also halted production at its aging capacity comurhex conversion plant in tricastin and will serve utilities from its stockpiles until the new plant comes online and global overcapacity subsides
from orano s new conversion facility to be called the philippe coste plant will have capacity of tonnes and output of about tonnes
when construction is completed early it will reach full capacity of tonnes
orano chief executive philippe knoche told reporters that the new plant s order book was full for the next years but added that profitability would remain challenging at current conversion rates
following the plant closures those rates have doubled to about per kilogram over the past year but are still too low for the industry s profitability
knoche said french utility edf had committed to buy about one third of the new plant s output while the rest would be sold mainly under contracts to about utilities in the united states china japan south korea and several european countries
ten to percent of the plant s output will be sold under contracts of less than three years
the uranium will come from areva and other companies mines in niger kazakhstan canada south africa and namibia
orano board chairman philippe varin said the firm s new conversion plant had been under development for years and that orano upgraded it as part of the modernization of its fuel facilities
this new facility is a commitment he said
orano and canada s cameco corp each have about a quarter of global uranium conversion capacity with russia s rosatom a bit more and china s cnnc a bit less than a quarter each according to industry expert estimates
