russia's rushydro says sanctions cloud prospects for joining rusal's smelter
vladivostok russia sept reuters plans by russia s power company rushydro to join a new aluminium smelter project that rusal wants to build in siberia have been complicated by international sanctions rushydro s head nikolai shulginov said on monday
rusal ranked the world s aluminium producer after china s hongqiao started work on the taishet project in
the project was mothballed in due to weak aluminium prices but dusted off last year last year as prices recovered
in april rushydro s board approved the move to join the project with total investments seen at around billion
the united states imposed sanctions on seven russian oligarchs including rusal s former president oleg deripaska and the companies they own or control in april in response to what it termed malign activities by russia
the thing is that the situation has been changed shulginov told reporters at a newly launched power station
several months ago before the sanctions had been toughened we were at the stage of taking the decision on joining the project under certain the sanctions caused havoc in the global aluminium market prompting several countries and companies to successfully lobby treasury for a softening of the terms on rusal which last year accounted for more than percent of global aluminium supplies estimated at around million tonnes
now taking the sanctions into account everything has changed
we have to get back maybe to recalculate our model what will happen to the aluminium prices to the electricity prices
there are lots of buts shulginov said
russia s state development bank veb has put financing for the construction of taishet aluminium smelter on but has not suspended the deal
taishet was expected to raise a total of billion in financing percent of which would be granted by veb the organiser of a syndicate of lenders
it is designed to produce tonnes of aluminium per year
