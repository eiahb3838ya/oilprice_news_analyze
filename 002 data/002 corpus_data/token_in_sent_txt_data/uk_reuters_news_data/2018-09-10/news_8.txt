chilean environmental regulator expands probe of gas poisoning
santiago reuters chile s environmental regulator expanded its investigation into a gas poisoning incident in coastal town quintero bringing charges of with environmental agreements on monday against a gas plant
the environmental inspectorate sma said gasmar a company that imports and sells liquefied petroleum gas and is by chilean industrial conglomerate copec has days to present a compliance plan or appeal the accusation that it failed to adhere to agreed levels of residual gas flaring from its chimneys
the charge against gasmar comes on the heels of stricter monitoring by sma following a gas poisoning incident in august in which hundreds of people showed symptoms of gas inhalation poisoning prompting ongoing protests over the government s handling of the issue
within days the sma ordered the suspension of some operations by the energy company enap also in the quintero industrial zone about miles northeast of santiago
the company has denied responsibility for the incident
the sma said in a statement on monday that its audit of gasmar s operations had not yet detected any pollution or harm caused to people living nearby
however it called the charge against gasmar serious and said it was brought because the company failed to mitigate its potentially adverse environmental impact
quintero has had several pollution incidents in the past including gas and oil leaks leading to investigations and fines against companies for with environmental obligations
the sma has admitted it struggles to supervise the operations of the industrial plants based in the area
environment minister carolina schmidt told local television station canal over the weekend that enap was not the only company responsible for polluting the area
she said the government had asked state miner codelco and aes gener an electricity generation firm to provide information about their emissions on when another environmental incident left people ill
