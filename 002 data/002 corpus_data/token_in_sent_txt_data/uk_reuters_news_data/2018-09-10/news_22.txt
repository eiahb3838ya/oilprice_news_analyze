update 2-saudi sovereign fund picks goldman, baml, klein for sabic sale -sources
dubai reuters saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund has chosen goldman sachs bank of america merrill lynch and michael klein as advisers on its planned sale of a stake in petrochemicals firm sabic to saudi aramco sources familiar with the process said
citigroup inc has won the mandate to advise saudi basic industries corp sabic two of the sources said on monday while reuters previously reported that jpmorgan and morgan stanley are advising aramco
goldman citigroup and baml declined to comment
michael klein whose firm is also known as klein company did not immediately respond to a request for comment
oil company aramco plans to buy a controlling stake in sabic possibly taking the sovereign public investment fund s pif entire percent holding
the deal mandate is a major win for goldman sachs which like other western investment banks has built up its saudi business to capitalize on the government s plans to privatize assets and diversify the economy
klein was previously picked to advise saudi arabia on its planned flotation of saudi aramco and has experience working on big chemicals deals including acting for dow chemical on its billion merger with dupont in
investment banking fees in saudi arabia are modest compared to elsewhere while risks are high making the sabic deal an especially coveted prize
riyadh recently shelved plans to float aramco and has postponed an airport privatization on which goldman was advising
goldman began operating in riyadh in and obtained new licenses in and that have allowed it to expand
it bought a portion of aramco s billion credit facility last year in an attempt to secure a role in the ipo
citigroup has also sought to rebuild its presence in saudi arabia after an absence of almost years
in january it won approval to begin investment banking operations there
if aramco acquires the full sabic stake valued at around billion it will be the kingdom s biggest m a deal and provide a boost to the oil major s downstream business
sabic has recently boosted its own holdings buying a percent stake in swiss specialty chemical maker clariant in january
that deal initially faced regulatory delays but has now been cleared to proceed
the deal will also provide an alternative source of cash to the pif after an initial public offering of aramco that was supposed to raise billion was shelved
analysts estimate the pif has around billion worth of assets under management
it said last year that it aims to increase its financial clout to around billion
it already owns stakes in many companies across the kingdom and plans to beef up its overseas expansion including pledges of billion to a fund with private equity firm blackstone and billion to softbank s vision fund
proceeds from the sale of sabic the world s fourth largest petrochemicals company are likely to help fund planned investments at home and abroad
the pif and sabic were not available for immediate comment
