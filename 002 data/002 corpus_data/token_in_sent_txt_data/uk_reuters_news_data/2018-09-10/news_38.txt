risk management firm dnv gl sees oil demand peaking in 2023
oslo sept reuters global oil demand will peak in as electric vehicles evs become competitive with cars fuelled by petrol and diesel and after no new oil developments will likely be needed quality assurance and risk management firm dnv gl said on monday
the forecast from the firm which offers certification and consultancy services to around customers globally adds to investors worries about some oil assets becoming stranded if demand enters into permanent decline
amid declining consumption in the future we see little scope for adding capacity in areas such as in the arctic dnv gl said in its forecast highlighting such a risk
by around evs will account for half of all new vehicles sold in the world and years later half of all road transport light and heavy will be electric it added
the transport sector is the main user of oil
after we will likely enter a period where new oil fields are not required to replace depleted fields dnv gl said adding that by oil demand is expected to be about a half of its peak
demand for natural gas is expected to grow until the when capital spending on energy will overtake spending on fossil energy dnv gl said in its report
the attention of boardrooms and cabinets should be fixed on the dramatic energy transition that is unfolding said remi eriksen the group s president and chief executive
investors are increasingly worried that some oil and gas assets could be left in the ground as a result of stricter regulations to curb carbon emissions and the fall in costs of renewable energy and car batteries
oil majors have different views on possible oil demand peak but all say that even if demand peaks trillions of dollars of investments in oil and gas will still be needed to develop new barrels due to the natural decline of existing fields

the company however did not disclose how efforts to limit carbon emissions would impact its business
in a separate report it said that excluding those climate measures oil demand is expected to grow by percent by driven by commercial transport and the chemical industry
