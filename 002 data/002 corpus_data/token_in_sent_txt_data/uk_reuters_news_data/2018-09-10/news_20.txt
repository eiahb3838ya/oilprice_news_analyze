the attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in tripoli the latest eruption of violence in libya which has been in turmoil since a uprising toppled muammar gaddafi

oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day
islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in libya s southern desert according to libyan and western officials
in may islamic state claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in tripoli
