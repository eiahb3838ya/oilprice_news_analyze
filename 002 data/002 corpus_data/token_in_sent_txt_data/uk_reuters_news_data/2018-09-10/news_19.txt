once darling of foreign investors, turkey's power market struggles
istanbul reuters when austrian energy company omv started operating its power plant in turkey in the country s electricity sector was the darling of foreign investors lured by promises of market liberalization and the highest growth forecasts outside china
five years later omv has sold off its turkish plant for barely half of the million euros it initially invested and turkey s power companies are in debt restructuring talks with banks amid a tumbling lira and rising energy costs
with the promised liberalization only partly delivered and plants at times undercutting market prices private sector firms found their margins squeezed even before the lira crisis drove up repayment costs on foreign currency loans
turkey no longer fits our product portfolio said an omv spokesperson in vienna
omv also sold off its wholly owned fuel retailer petrol ofisi in two years after its former ceo described the turkey investments as a disappointment
with their margins squeezed many power companies are fighting to keep cash flows stable and struggling to find buyers as the outlook darkens for the turkish economy and for a still heavily electricity market
we will be seeing cash tightness more frequently
i don t want to think of a scenario where the private sector or the state is not able to deliver on its pledges said an industry source who works in a power generation company
according to a report by boston consulting group and turkish business group tusiad a total of billion of investments have been poured into the turkish electricity market over the past years largely funded by cheap credit
of this around billion is yet to be repaid
several turkish companies including power firms are seeking to restructure their debt after the lira lost percent this year due to concerns over president tayyip erdogan s opposition to higher interest rates and a bitter diplomatic dispute with the united states
conglomerate gama holding is among the latest in talks to sell some of its assets including a stake in its gama energy which produces electricity from hydro wind and natural gas with around mw installed power across turkey
such financing issues risk clouding the outlook even for the renewables sector a relative bright spot in turkey s power market
fitch ratings last month downgraded its forecasts for turkish solar and wind capacity as it expected fewer projects to gain financing in the short run
it should not be a surprise for power companies to file for bankruptcy one after the other said a senior manager at a turkish energy firm
many companies are really in a dire situation and they are in a panic to restructure he said
turkish energy officials declined to comment for this story
turkey has reduced the state s role in power production through privatizations and also brought power trading onto an exchange to boost transparency
but the government still holds percent of total installed power supply and often offers prices below market levels effectively setting a ceiling that can defy market fundamentals
the natural gas market has remained largely under state control hampering further development of the power market
more than percent of the mw electricity generation uses natural gas
as a result power plants fed by natural gas which have more flexible production levels than renewables and plants are the hardest hit
turkey s state pipeline operator botas has more than doubled prices for gas supplied to power plants to lira per kilowatt hour kwh this month from lira last year
but electricity sale prices for those power plants have risen much less
the market clearing price at turkey s energy bourse epias rose percent over the same period while household power prices only rose percent
our margins have evaporated
there is no predictability or visibility in the market which makes it even more difficult for restructuring
and that jeopardizes the financial stability of these companies said selim guven commercial director of acwa power in turkey
when you are indirectly subsidizing the manufacturing sector and consumers with cheap electricity you are damaging the financial sustainability predictability and the foreign investor appetite in the power when omv and other foreign investors flocked to turkey its power market looked to be the only one in europe promising returns with energy demand forecasts second only to china
turkey s overall energy demand still grew at percent a year in the decade to more than twice the global average bp s statistical review of world energy said
but turkey s recent economic woes have prompted economists to downgrade growth forecasts and some now see prolonged economic contraction into
some government measures including incentives for power plants to use domestic coal to help reduce a billion energy import bill have damaged price predictability
you need predictability consistent state policies financial stability and access to longer term funding guven said
