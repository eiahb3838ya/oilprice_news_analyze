oil prices climb as u.s. energy firms cut rigs, iran sanctions loom
us rig count has stagnated since may us sanctions against iran s oil sector tighten market by henning gloystein singapore sept reuters oil prices rose on monday as the number of rigs drilling for new production was cut last week and as the market is expected to tighten once sanctions against iran s crude exports kick in from november
west texas intermediate wti crude futures were at per barrel at gmt up cents or percent from their last settlement
brent crude futures climbed cents or percent to a barrel
energy companies cut two oil rigs last week bringing the total count to energy services firm baker hughes said on friday
the rig count has stagnated since may after staging a recovery since which followed a steep slump the previous year amid plummeting crude prices
outside the united states new sanctions against iran s crude exports from november were helping push up prices
energy consultancy fge said several major iran customers like india japan and south korea were already cutting back on iran crude
governments can talk tough
they can say they are going to stand up to trump push for waivers
but generally the companies we speak to say they won t risk it fge said

financial penalties and the loss of shipping insurance scares everyone it said in a note to clients
with rig activity stalling and iran sanctions looming the oil market outlook is tightening
investors have largely turned positive again likely welcoming the return of backwardation said edward bell commodity analyst at emirates nbd bank
backwardation describes a market in which prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for later dispatch
it is considered a sign of tight conditions giving traders an incentive to sell oil immediately instead of storing it
the brent backwardation between october this year and is currently around per barrel
one key question going forward is how demand develops amid the trade disputes between the united states and china as well as general emerging market weakness
nbd s bell said we don t expect that currency weakness in several emerging markets will pose a risk to oil market fundamentals as the weakness in both india and china the two markets most vital from an oil market perspective has been relatively consultancy fge however warned that trade wars and especially rising interest rates can spell trouble for the emerging markets that drive oil demand growth
despite this fge said the likelihood of significantly weaker oil prices was relatively low as the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec would withhold output to prevent prices from plunging
we feel confident opec can and will deal with slowing demand
we see per barrel as a trigger for cuts fge said
