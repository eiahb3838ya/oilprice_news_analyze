update 4-vw investors sue for billions of dollars over diesel scandal
braunschweig germany reuters investors took volkswagen to court on monday to seek compensation for the hit to the carmaker s share price from its diesel emissions scandal with plaintiffs holding out hopes for billions of dollars in damages
shareholders representing claims are seeking billion euros billion pounds in damages over the scandal which broke in september and has cost volkswagen vw billion euros in penalties and fines so far
it is likely however that only some of the claims will be taken into account because of the statute of limitations presiding judge christian jaede told the braunschweig higher regional court as proceedings began without giving a figure
andreas tilp a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs said he believes that claims worth billion euros of the roughly billion euros he represents have a chance
we are very confident that there will be money at the end of the day he said
judge jaede said the case was highly complicated with many legal questions to be clarified
the court has not yet set a detailed timetable for proceedings in a case that could well end up in a higher court
the plaintiffs say vw failed in its duty to inform investors about the financial impact of the scandal which became public only after the environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation on
had investors known about vw s criminal activities in rigging emissions tests they may have sold shares earlier or not made purchases thereby avoiding losses on their holdings the plaintiffs argue
vw shares lost up to percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from vw diesel cars
vw should have told the market that they cheated and generated risk worth billions said tilp
vw should have told the market no later than june that they could not make the technology that they needed in the united the carmaker s decision between and to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal but it is not clear that it was taken to keep investors in the dark judge jaede said
vw has admitted systematic emissions cheating but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure
this case is mainly about whether volkswagen complied with its disclosure obligations to shareholders and the capital markets vw lawyer markus pfueller told the court
we are convinced that this is the a challenge of the case according to jaede is that it covers many incidents stretching back to with claims before july potentially invalidated by the statute of limitations the court said in a summary of proceedings
however the results of a study into vw diesel engines commissioned by the international council on clean transportation icct and investigations by regulators from may could constitute insider information the court said
critical to the case jaede said was the period from early when he said vw employees had learned that tests showed its diesel cars emitted far more toxic nitrogen oxide on the road than under laboratory conditions
there is also the question of who within vw knew what and when whether the information would actually have had an impact on the share price had it been made public and if so how damages should be calculated the court added
vw s board did not see the need to brief investors before september because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an epa notice of violation and because vw was in talks about reaching a settlement the carmaker said in a court filing
it added that board members at the time including current ceo herbert diess and chairman hans dieter poetsch did not violate disclosure rules
plaintiffs including fund management firm deka allege that managers below management board level including divisional heads knew early on about deliberate and systematic cheating
the company was therefore aware of criminal activity and so investors should have been warned earlier the plaintiffs say
