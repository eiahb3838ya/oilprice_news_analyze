exclusive-venezuela signs oil deals similar to ones rolled back under chavez -document
caracas reuters venezuela has agreed to hand over at least seven oil fields to companies that will be paid to boost output through contracts similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader hugo chavez according to two sources and an internal document
the effort signals that president nicolas maduro who is struggling under a economic meltdown and oil output is willing to reverse the aggressive efforts of his predecessor who died in to expand the state s role in the energy industry of the opec nation
but the plan faces significant hurdles because most companies involved have no known experience operating oilfields and sanctions would likely inhibit more experienced firms from getting involved with venezuela s pdvsa
the government had already announced a vague plan to boost oil output with the help of seven companies
the plan was described during a televised event on in which representatives of those companies during a ceremony including maduro signed joint service agreements with pdvsa
details of the deals were not disclosed
but in a draft contract seen by reuters pdvsa offers to put companies in charge of the fields for six years on the condition that they boost production finance the required investment and procure the necessary equipment
the draft was the basis for the contracts announced by maduro said two sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they are not allowed to speak publicly about the issue
reuters was not able to obtain finalized contracts
the companies involved have not yet announced final agreements with venezuela
neither pdvsa nor the companies involved responded to a request for comment
the president of pdvsa manuel quevedo said during the event that the overall plan would involve million in investment and a production increase of barrels per day bpd
the terms of the deals were not disclosed
quevedo said the plan included companies but that only seven were present that night without mentioning the names of the other companies
the deals involve fields including two that were operated by italy s eni and france s total
the companies that signed agreements include five venezuelan firms petrokariña enfriadores de venezuela consorcio rinoca centauro kariña well services cavallino and consorcio petrolero tomoporo
most of them appear to be involved in oil services but have no evident experience operating fields which tends to require significantly more capital human resources and certifications
the companies either did not respond to requests for comment or do not have sufficient publicly available contact information to make such a request
the other two are helios petroleum services a panamanian company that describes itself as petroleum marketer and shandong kerui holding group a chinese oilfield equipment manufacturer
neither responded to requests for comment
the draft says companies would receive a fee in compensation for the value of additional barrels they produce and be reimbursed for the investments they make
pdvsa would have a grace period starting at the time the contractor increases output to begin making payments
payments would be made to the account of a trust created by the contractor the draft says helping ensure the contractor actually receives payment from pdvsa which is billions of dollars behind in paying partners and providers
the draft contract is similar to a group of contracts known as operating agreements under which pdvsa contracted out oil production to companies that were paid a fee for the crude they produced
chavez elected in for years lambasted this arrangement as a bad deal for venezuela on the grounds that it was a disguised privatization of the oil industry that did not leave enough revenue in the hands of the state
former oil czar rafael ramirez who oversaw chavez s push to boost the state s role in the oil industry in a speech to congress said the arrangements were illegal because they handed over oilfields to private companies in violation of the oil industry nationalization
the legal status of the contracts signed in august was not immediately evident
venezuela in ordered that operating agreements be converted to joint ventures in which pdvsa held a majority
despite a oil boom that left pdvsa flush with cash output at those fields steadily declined as the company diverted necessary investments into social programs that kept chavez popular
the collapse of oil prices ushered in an economic crisis that left millions unable to eat leaving oil engineers and oilfield workers alike rushing to leave the country
maduro says the country is victim of an economic war led by opposition politicians with the support of washington which has slapped several rounds of sanctions on his government
