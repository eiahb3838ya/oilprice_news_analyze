wrapup 5-u.s. calls on world to 'pick a side' on venezuela; europeans set to recognize guaido
united reuters the united states on saturday called on the world to pick a side on venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from nicolas maduro s government while european powers signalled they were set to follow washington in recognising venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido as the country s rightful leader
in heated exchanges at a united nations security council meeting the opposing camp led by venezuela and russia which has invested heavily in venezuela s oil industry accused washington of attempting a coup and lambasted europeans demand that elections be called within eight days
guaido who took the helm of the national assembly on proclaimed himself interim president on wednesday
the united states canada and a string of latin american countries recognised the young leader in quick succession
maduro who has led the nation since and has the support of the armed forces has refused to stand down
but on saturday guaido gained support from a key military official
venezuela s defence attache to washington colonel jose luis silva told reuters that he has broken with the maduro government and recognised guaido as interim president
speaking at the meeting called by the united states secretary of state mike pompeo said maduro s socialist experiment had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food
now it is time for every other nation to pick a side

either you stand with the forces of freedom or you re in league with maduro and his mayhem pompeo told the council
we call on all members of the security council to support venezuela s democratic transition and interim president guaido s pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from maduro s government
washington has signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive maduro from power but on saturday pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans
by overcoming opposition to holding the meeting on saturday washington successfully put the global spotlight on venezuela as a security council problem
however any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by russia and china diplomats said
britain germany france and spain all said on saturday they would recognise guaido if maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days an ultimatum russia said was absurd and the venezuelan foreign minister called europe is giving us eight days
where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza told the security council
russia also said military intervention in venezuela should be avoided at any cost while caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with president donald trump s government was still on the table despite his administration s campaign against maduro
if president trump like other presidents of the united states is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy he won t get that war in venezuela arreaza told reporters later
venezuela has sunk into turmoil under maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to million percent this year
maduro cruised to last may
the opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part
critics accused the government of vote buying
the domestic opposition the united states and latin american governments declined to recognise the result of the ballot
venezuelan opposition sympathizers had been urging guaido to assume the presidency since maduro was inaugurated for a second term on
hundreds of thousands took to the streets in caracas earlier this week calling on maduro to step down
guaido s declaration of himself as the interim president takes venezuela into uncharted territory with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions
after the security council debate guaido sent a letter to secretary general antonio guterres asking the united nations for help addressing hunger violence and the lack of medicines in his country
the united nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter
guaido celebrated the support of european countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis
we woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the european community guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital caracas
several european countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid
we continue adding countries to this great effort he said
the maduro government has previously rejected such aid denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions
after washington s declaration of support for guaido maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the united states on wednesday and gave diplomats hours to leave the country
some embassy staff left caracas on friday and venezuela was withdrawing staff from washington on saturday venezuela s foreign ministry said in a statement however maduro softened his demand that all embassy staff withdraw by saturday
instead the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with interest offices in their respective capitals within days the statement said
if that fails the missions would close
