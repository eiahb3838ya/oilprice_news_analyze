depending on what happens on venezuela s borders over the weekend the leaders could dramatically boost aid pledges to the country or take new steps to crack down the official told reporters
if there is any type of violence or if there is any type of negative reaction from the hierarchy of the venezuela armed forces there may also be measures that are announced by the vice president and other countries in regards to closing even further the international financial circle the official said speaking on condition of anonymity

despite shortages of food and medicine maduro has denied there is a crisis in the country and says the aid is aimed at undermining his government
he has ordered some of the country s borders closed to keep the aid from entering

the administration official declined to comment on future sanctions but said the united states and other allies are looking at ways to expel family members of venezuelan military officials who are living outside the country including some in south florida
they re going to face a situation where they and their families are going to have to go back to venezuela he said
the official described the aid convoys as a key test for the venezuelan military as its leaders weigh whether to obey maduro or guaido who has asked the military to let it pass
it s really the first order he gives to them as their commander in chief the official added
