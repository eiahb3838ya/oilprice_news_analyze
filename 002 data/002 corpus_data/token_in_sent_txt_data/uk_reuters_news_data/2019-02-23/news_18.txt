after false start, nigerians focus on economy in tight presidential vote
president buhari opposition s atiku leading contenders nigeria is africa s biggest economy top oil producer presidential election by james macharia abuja feb reuters nigerian president muhammadu buhari s hold on power faces a strong challenge on saturday in a delayed election that hinges on the fate of the economy africa s biggest
the presidential vote in the continent s top oil producer and most populous nation is too close to call between buhari and the main opposition candidate atiku abubakar a businessman and former vice president who leads a field of more than challengers
the election due to be held a week ago was postponed around five hours before polling stations were set to open and there are concerns that the delay may hurt turnout
the electoral commission blamed logistical factors for the delay and denied political pressure was behind the decision
presidential elections in and were also delayed over logistics and security concerns but buhari on friday urged nigerians to go out and vote promising that there would be adequate security for the ballot
the boko haram militant group and its offshoot islamic state in west africa province have carried out deadly sporadic raids in the northeastern borno state
boko haram has warned people not to vote
but the showdown between buhari and atiku hinges on revamping an economy struggling to recover from its first recession in years which it slipped into in as crude prices crashed and militants attacked energy facilities in the niger delta
crude sales make up percent of foreign exchange earnings
instability is a rising concern but a weak economy is being felt in all sectors and so we believe it will be the preeminent voter concern said benedict craven analyst at the economist intelligence unit
buhari s critics say his focus on rooting out corruption may be offset by his handling of the economy
despite the president s campaign against graft there have not been any significant convictions in his first term
nearly a quarter of the workforce is unemployed much higher than when buhari a former military ruler who was later elected president took over in
the cost of living has also risen rapidly with inflation of percent in january just short of a high reached the previous month
buhari has said the economy has put the recession behind it and is back on a path of steady growth
to his supporters atiku is an accomplished businessman with the credentials needed to boost growth create jobs and attract foreign investors back to nigeria
atiku has promised to expand the role of the private sector in a nation of nearly million people saying that if elected he would aim to double the size of the economy to billion by
he has for years been dogged by corruption accusations which he denies
critics say atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most nigerians
buhari is the flagbearer of the ruling all progressives congress apc while atiku spearheads the main opposition people democratic party pdp
the pair are both muslims from the north of the country
the south has favoured the pdp in the past while the north is buhari s stronghold
the number of eligible voters stands at million people
to be declared winner the candidate with the most votes must have at least one quarter of the vote in two thirds of nigeria s states and the capital
otherwise there is a runoff
