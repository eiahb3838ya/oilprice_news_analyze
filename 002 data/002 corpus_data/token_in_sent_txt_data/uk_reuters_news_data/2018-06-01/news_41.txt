nordlink cable to germany may initially lower norway power prices - statnett
nordlink cable to transport power to and from germany cable is one of three linking norway to rest of europe by lefteris karagiannopoulos vollesfjord norway june reuters a power cable being laid between germany and norway may lower norwegian energy prices in its first years as wind power in northern germany at times can not be exported further south due to grid bottlenecks norway s statnett said
nordlink a interconnector that will begin operations in will export power produced by dams from norway to germany
it could also import power
the project and other planned cables have been under fire in norway over concerns the nordic country would lose its cheap power supply by exporting electricity to germany
cheap power has been a draw for industries in norway
statnett spokesman christer gilje said the new cable could initially lower prices for norwegian customers until germany s grid is upgraded to distribute the extra supplies from nordlink although he said prices would rise after
power prices in norway may sometimes be lower in the beginning he said on a visit to the site where a bright yellow subsea cable was being connected to norway s grid on land
he said this was because germany now sometimes had surplus power from wind generation in the north pushing down prices as the german grid could not yet transmit the extra power south
when you have a big surplus that drives prices down to zero and sometimes actually below zero in germany it will affect norwegian prices he said without saying by how much
after the billion euro billion cable would increase norwegian power prices by an estimated one euro per megawatt hour he said
this week statnett began laying the second of two gigawatt subsea wires that together make up the interconnector in a fjord in the southwest of the country
the norwegian subsea part will be completed this year project director stein haavard auno told reuters
nordlink is being developed by statnett grid firm tennet and germany s kfw investment bank
french cable maker nexans is installing the cable in norway
nordlink is due to start commercial trials by the end of with upgrades on the norwegian grid completed by statnett said
