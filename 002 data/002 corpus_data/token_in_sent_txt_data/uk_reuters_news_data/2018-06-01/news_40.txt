australia's agl expects to make decision on lng import terminal in fy2019
agl in discussion with lng suppliers lng imports could start by by jessica jaganathan singapore june reuters agl energy ltd australia s biggest power producer expects to make a final investment decision on the country s first liquefied natural gas lng import terminal in the financial year of a company official said on friday
the a million million project will consist of a leased floating storage and regasification unit fsru and jetty at crib point in the southeastern state of victoria
the terminal will handle up to to petajoules a year or million tonnes of lng by or
we are working to progress the project to a final investment decision in the financial year and are on track to do that said phaedra deckart general manager of agl s energy supply and origination team
we are in discussion with lng suppliers and fsru providers on the other components to the agl s financial year runs from july to june
australia is set to become the world s top exporter of lng but that is paradoxically creating a shortage at home as gas is pulled away from local markets in the southeast
agl is looking to fill a looming gas supply shortfall in southeast australia and break the grip of the market s major gas suppliers led by exxonmobil corp and bhp billiton
the company needs gas for its retail customers as well as its own power plants
it depends heavily on supply from the gippsland basin joint venture owned by exxon and bhp and from royal dutch shell which has been selling gas from queensland
lng imports into australia could provide competition to the gas market in southern australia and in turn cap prices deckart said
australian consumers are paying at times more and higher prices than the lng netback prices so we see the lng imports effectively putting a cap she said at a conference organised by s p global platts in singapore
it doesn t mean other australian supply won t be coming to the market in australia but it will mean it can t come to the market at a price higher than lng import the company could also import additional cargoes if there are any unplanned outages capacity constraint or if there is a security of supply issue she added
