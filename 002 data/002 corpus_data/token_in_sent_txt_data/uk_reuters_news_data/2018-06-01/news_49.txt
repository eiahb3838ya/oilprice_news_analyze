feature-as cameroon prepares for the african cup of nations, trees fall
yaounde june thomson reuters foundation cameroon has cut thousands of hectares of forest to build stadiums hotels roads and housing to host the africa cup of nations a move that could lead to worsening urban flooding and droughts the country s environmental groups warn
cameroon s ability to host the africa football cup of nations depends on the availability of adapted modern infrastructure said oumarou tado secretary general of cameroon s ministry of sports and physical education
it is regrettable that many of these new projects have led to vast deforestation but we had to meet the strict guidelines of the african football confederation he told the thomson reuters foundation
in yaounde the capital about hectares of trees were cut to build the new olembe stadium about km from the centre of the city
in limbe hectares of forests were removed to create space for a stadium and a sport training facility
much more land has been cleared to build other facilities related to the competition including roads hotels and large new tracts of housing environmentalists say
part of what has driven tree cutting tado said is that specifications for cup of nations infrastructure improvements require the new facilities to be built in areas that are easily accessible but without traffic problems
these specifications were found in forested areas on the outskirts of major cities he said
cameroon s legendary world cup soccer player roger milla a sports ambassador for the country said forested areas had to give way to improve the country s sporting facilities noting that to make omelets one has to break eggs
cameroon is a lead football nation in africa but paradoxically without modern sports infrastructure
we have been waiting for this for a long time said milla whose foundation coeur d afrique has taken part in tree planting efforts in yaounde since
environment experts however have criticised the decision to build on forested areas saying urban trees must be protected if the country is to avoid worsening impacts of climate change including flooding and droughts
forests are very important in regulating city climate thus their loss or degradation is a major source of emissions of carbon dioxide which contributes to climate change and is a big threat to the livelihood of the population said samuel nguifo executive director of the centre for environment and development a yaounde environmental
he said forests act as air conditioners for cities cooling residents suffering increasingly hot weather
cameroon has in recent years seen large areas of forest cut for mining projects new ports hydroelectric dams and other projects under the country s vision project
that economic development plan aims to slash widespread unemployment and cut cameroon s poverty rate from percent in to less than percent by
between and cameroon lost nearly hectares of trees a percent reduction in the country s forests according to data from global forest watch a forest monitoring initiative
more than half of all the tree losses were in the centre south east and littoral regions where most new investment projects are concentrated the data showed
adding football infrastructure has now made the pressure on cameroon s existing deforestation hotspots worse forest experts said
these new sports infrastructure projects will only increase the susceptibility of these cities to the effects of climate change said julius chuezi tieguhong a forest researcher with the african forest forum
the cities of douala yaounde and limbe have in recent years faced worsening water shortages floods and rising temperatures all problems likely to become worse as forest is cut tieguhong said
in some roads and buildings in cameroon s economic hub douala were submerged following days of heavy rains while in yaounde the sight of women and children trekking across the city to fetch scarce drinking water has become increasingly common
cameroon s government however is hopeful that teaming up with city authorities to plant more urban trees can offset some of the damage
jules doret ndongo the country s ministry of forestry and wildlife this month signed a deal with city councils in regions of the country to plant more city trees and create new parks
the effort is a combined forest floods drought and water shortage protection effort he said
the government says city councils will receive over million fcfa million annually to help curb deforestation
according to bruno mfou ou mfou ou director of forestry in the ministry of forestry and wildlife tree planting efforts will target areas particularly suffering flooding or drought
targeting vulnerable areas is critical in the fight against climate disasters he said
the city tree project comes on top of a government project that aims to restore million hectares of deforested land in the country mfou ou mfou ou noted
