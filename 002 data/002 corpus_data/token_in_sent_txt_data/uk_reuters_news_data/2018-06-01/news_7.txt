refile-analysis-brazil strike boosts far right candidate's shot at presidency
brasilia reuters presidential candidate jair bolsonaro went out on a limb to support a truckers strike that paralysed brazil and forced the government to reinstate costly fuel subsidies and the strategy may have helped his chances of beating one of several reform candidates in october s election
the scale of the truckers stoppage overwhelmed president michel temer s unpopular government which was pressured into granting truckers demands as airports ran out of fuel grocery shelves emptied and drivers waited hours to fill their tanks
despite these disruptions truckers won support from many brazilians angry at a surge in diesel prices since state oil company petrobras scrapped subsidies under temer
an opinion poll on wednesday found that percent of brazilians supported the strike
centrist candidates such as former sao paulo governor geraldo alckmin and ruling party candidate henrique meirelles did not come out in support of the truckers when they blocked brazil s main highways
there has been no poll on voter intentions yet to show whether lack of support for the strike hurt these politicians who back further fiscal that many voters oppose but investors would like to see
bolsonaro a former army captain turned congressman running on an platform praised the truckers in social media messages for fighting extortionist taxes levied by temer s corrupt government
ahead of the election bolsonaro had just under percent support giving him the lead in polls that exclude jailed leftist luis inacio lula da silva who received percent support in one poll even though he can not run due to a graft conviction
bolsonaro s strong support in a crowded field has alarmed moderate politicians and unnerved some investors
but with brazil slow to recover from its most painful recession in decades many voters believe temer s government has ignored the hardships of ordinary people
this has led analysts and politicians to say this year s election may come down to a choice between the far left and the far right
during the strike many truckers displayed placards expressing support for bolsonaro
the government handled this strike so badly said lorivan carvalho a federal employee who spent two hours waiting in a line of cars at a gas station in brasilia
bolsonaro gained points by backing the the protest which wound down this week after temer reintroduced subsidies demonstrated the unpopularity of temer s efforts to liberalize latin america s largest economy
many brazilians tired of violent crime and corruption among mainstream parties have been drawn to bolsonaro s hardline pledges
for instance the candidate said he would appoint five generals to his cabinet and would give police carte blanche to kill delinquents who shoot at them
brazil has some deaths a year
congressman major olimpio one of bolsonaro s campaign managers told reuters the strike was a vote winner for his candidate who had emerged as the only credible politician whereas temer s policies were blamed for the crisis
if no candidate wins a majority in the first round a runoff between the two leaders will be held on
even political rivals conceded that bolsonaro s odds are improving
if he continues with this level of support and the centre remains divided bolsonaro could reach the runoff said congressman fabio sousa of the centrist brazilian social democracy party psdb
bolsonaro holds nationalist views of economic development of the kind implemented by brazil s military dictatorship and has opposed the privatisation of state companies
he also has been indicted by federal prosecutors on hate speech charges
yet in an overture to the business community he picked investment banker paulo guedes as his economic advisor a who would sell off everything from petrobras to state banks and the post office
some business leaders in the world s eighth largest economy may view him as the lesser evil if he is in a runoff with the leading leftist candidate fiery former state governor ciro gomes
the market likes guedes but doubts he can apply his ideas in a bolsonaro government said the manager of a brazilian investment fund speaking on the condition he was not identified
the market does not prefer bolsonaro but might have to accept frustration with how the temer government handled the strike added to popular anger at a political establishment discredited by graft investigations
more than powerful politicians and businessmen are now behind bars
the truckers protest weakened temer more than anything else since he took power more than two years ago following the impeachment of leftist dilma rousseff
temer is the first sitting brazilian president to be charged with corruption
his approval ratings have sunk to around percent even lower than that of president nicolas maduro of neighbouring venezuela hit by hyperinflation and food shortages
this has dashed hopes that temer s lame duck government can push through congress business friendly measures such as the privatisation of brazil s largest utility centrais eletricas brasileiras sa known as eletrobras
that was a already a tough sell
now it becomes almost impossible said lucas de aragão partner at the political consultancy arko advice
former ceará state governor ciro gomes has emerged as the most likely standard bearer for brazil s left with just under percent
aragão believes many voters view gomes as part of the establishment while bolsonaro will gain ground from the truck crisis because he is perceived as an outsider
the truckers strike knocked down the last pillar of hope temer s government had of electing a successor that will continue its policies said rafael cortez chief analyst at tendencias consultancy who sees little chance of a moderate like meirelles winning
this climate of radicalisation benefits the extremes cortez said
