corrected-insight-us coal lobby fights black-lung tax as disease rates surge
corrects title of peabody official in paragraph by valerie volcovici princeton west virginia june reuters as a young man barry shrewsbury dug coal in the west virginia mines and spent his time off hunting and fishing in the rolling hills
now at he struggles to breathe and accomplish basic tasks such as shopping and showering and relies on a federal fund for with black lung disease to pay for an oxygen tank and doctor visits
the benefits are a lifeline shrewsbury said between labored breaths after a treatment at the bluestone health center an building set against a leafy landscape in princeton west virginia
that lifeline is threatened
the black lung disability trust fund is at risk of insolvency due to soaring debt and a slashing of contributions through a tax cut scheduled for the end of the year according to a report the government accountability office plans to publish soon two sources briefed on the study told reuters
that shortfall which comes as black lung rates hit highs not seen in decades could force the fund to restrict benefits or shift some of the financial burden to taxpayers the sources said on condition of anonymity
the fund currently provides medical coverage and monthly payments for living expenses to more than people according to a congressional report published this year

the coal industry meanwhile is lobbying congress to ensure the scheduled tax reduction goes forward arguing the payments have already been too high at a difficult time for mining companies and that the fund has been abused by undeserving applicants
more often than not we are being called upon to provide compensation for previous or current smokers said bruce watzman head of regulatory affairs for the national mining association
he said that view was based on discussions with those administering this program for companies but conceded he had no research on benefits paying for diseases
medical experts dispute that argument saying the disease an incurable illness caused by inhaling coal dust is easy to distinguish with
it is not caused by smoking said david blackley head of respiratory disease studies at the national institute for occupational safety and health
the labor department which manages the fund considers all potential causes of an applicant s lung problems before awarding benefits said amy louviere a spokeswoman for the department s mine safety and health administration
the approval rate for applications was about percent last year according to department data
coal companies are currently required to pay a per ton excise tax on underground coal production to finance the fund
that amount will revert to the level of cents at the end of the year if congress does not extend the current rate
the fund has already been forced to borrow more than billion from the treasury to finance benefits during the life of the program according to the treasury department
about half of the fund s revenue now goes to servicing that debt
a bipartisan effort by lawmakers to extend the current coal tax failed this year after the mining association lobbied republican house leadership not to take it up
watzman said he was not at liberty to identify members of congress who oppose extending the tax
matt sparks a spokesman for house majority leader kevin mccarthy s office did not respond to requests for comment
lawmakers expect discussion of the tax to resume after the gao report is released
we need to take care of the miners said virginia republican congressman morgan griffith who represents a district that has seen one of the biggest surges in the disease
we first need to have all facts on the the mining association and large miners such as peabody energy arch coal and consol energy are already pressing their case according to congressional lobbying records that show the black lung fund among the subjects discussed in their recent meetings with lawmakers
peabody spokeswoman michelle constantine declined to comment
arch spokesman logan bonacorsi and consol spokesman zachary smith did not respond to requests for comment
the upcoming gao report was requested in by democratic congressmen bobby scott of virginia and sander levin of michigan and has undergone review by the administration of president donald trump who has focused on slashing regulation to help the coal industry
white house spokeswoman kelly love did not respond to a request for comment on the administration s position on the excise tax
the fund pays benefits to miners severely disabled by black lung in cases where no coal company can be found to directly provide support
that typically occurs when a company has gone an increasingly common scenario as the nation s utilities shift to cheaper natural gas and cleaner solar and wind power
some medical claims were transferred from companies to the fund in due to bankruptcies according to a congressional report this year
government research shows the incidence of black lung rebounding despite improved safety measures adopted decades ago such as dust screens and ventilation that had nearly eradicated the disease in the
in february the national institute for occupational safety and health confirmed cases of advanced black lung disease in three medical clinics in rural virginia from to the highest concentration of cases ever seen
it also confirmed a investigation by national public radio that found many hundreds more cases in southwestern virginia southern west virginia and eastern kentucky
this is history moving in the wrong direction said kirsten almberg an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the university of illinois at chicago
almberg authored an analysis of labor department data showing that nearly half the benefits claims from miners with the worst form of black lung disease were made since
and regional health experts blame the resurgence on longer hours spent in deeper parts of old mines along with lax safety measures and the use of heavy machines to blast through layers of rock
we didn t use curtains
we rarely used ventilators
we thought we were invincible said greg jones who left mining in march and now coordinates benefits applications at the tug river black lung clinic in gary west virginia
brandon crum a radiologist at the united medical group in pikeville kentucky said he has personally diagnosed more than cases of advanced black lung disease since many in younger miners
crum whose own family worked the mines for a century said many of these people face a lifetime unable to work inundated with medical bills
any kind of asset or financial stability you would take away from these miners and their families would be devastating he said
to qualify for benefits a miner must apply to the department of labor which screens the applications based on medical and employment documentation and then tries to find a responsible coal company to pay the costs
jim werth the black lung clinic director at stone mountain health services in charles virginia said his clinic has three people on staff helping patients file for benefits
he rejected the idea that the fund was covering undeserving applicants saying the process already makes it hard to qualify with coal companies often hiring doctors to dispute medical test results
william mccool said it took him years to win benefits
i worked years in the mines and the benefits don t come automatic said mccool who wore a gray baseball cap emblazoned with a crossing and shovel during an interview at the mountain health center in whitesburg kentucky where he receives oxygen and physical therapy
kennith adams a former miner who survived colon cancer and is now suffering advanced black lung had his first application rejected two years ago he said
consol argued he did not work for the firm when he became adams had worked at the bishop coal company which later got taken over by consol
consol did not respond to a request for comment
adams and his wife tammie are now hoping his latest application sent last month will be approved to help them pay medical bills of more than a month
if he doesn t get his medicine his wife said he doesn t stand a reporting by valerie volcovici editing by richard valdmanis and brian thevenot
