refile-ebrd publishes guidance for firms disclosing climate impacts
this version of the may story refiles with full task force name
by nina chestney london reuters the european bank for reconstruction and development has published guidance for companies reporting on the physical impact of climate change in their financial results
concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because climate risk is not being factored into financial reporting has prompted demand for more meaningful and transparent financial information
a global task force set up by the the task force on financial disclosure tcfd has developed a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of risks and opportunities
around two thirds of member states have engaged with the framework since its launch last year a study by the cambridge institute for sustainability leadership shows
however the tcfd framework does not provide much concrete detail on the metrics for reporting climate risks and opportunities in financial disclosures
the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and the global centre for excellence on climate adaptation gceca therefore conducted an analysis with working groups in the financial and corporate sectors to identify a standard set of metrics
the working groups included representatives from organisations and firms such as the organisation for economic and development allianz the bank of england barclays maersk lloyds shell blackrock and zurich asset management
they came up with recommendations for firms when disclosing climate impacts which include projecting physical climate effects such as droughts heat stress and extreme rainfall on their assets or financial instruments lifetime over a five to time frame
risks beyond years should also be assessed using scenarios to account for uncertainty in climate policy and impacts of climate change the guidance said
another recommendation is for firms to assess the potential changes in their value chains as a result of physical climate impacts and potential market shifts as customer needs change
companies should also describe their processes for identifying assessing and managing climate risks such as risk management processes insurance coverage planned facility moves or retrofits and corporate climate resilience strategy
last week a survey by a uk committee of lawmakers showed that seven out of britain s largest pension funds have committed to report on climate risks in line with the tcfd framework
eight are considering to do so while have no plans to do so
