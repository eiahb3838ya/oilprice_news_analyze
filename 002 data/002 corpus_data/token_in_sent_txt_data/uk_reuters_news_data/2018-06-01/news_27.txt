the latest census put them at individuals in virunga and in uganda s nearby bwindi impenetrable national park joel wenga malembe spokesman for the congolese institute for the conservation of nature told reuters
the last survey in found just of this critically endangered eastern gorilla of which were in virunga
these numbers are truly remarkable far exceeding our expectations and are the result of a collaborative effort with governments and partners all playing an important role mike cranfield of charity gorilla doctors said in a statement
partly because they are so rare the mountain gorillas are a major source of tourist revenue for the three nations and their habitat supports other rare species found nowhere else such as golden monkeys
but they are under constant threat of encroachment by farmers in one of africa s most densely populated rural regions and hunting for bush meat or bizarre trophies sold abroad
congo has also invited oil companies to start drilling in virunga africa s largest tropical rainforest reserve which conservationists worry will put the environment in greater danger
