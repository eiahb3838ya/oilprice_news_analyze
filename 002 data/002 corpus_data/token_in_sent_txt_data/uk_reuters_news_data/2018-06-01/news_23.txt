strict warming curb key to survival of world's most vulnerable - ex-u.n. climate chief
london june thomson reuters foundation the world must limit global warming to degrees to give vulnerable populations even a percent chance of surviving the impact of climate change the former united nations climate chief said on friday
the paris agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to well below degrees celsius fahrenheit above times while pursuing efforts for
but a key architect of that agreement christiana figueres told a london conference a failure to cap warming at would be disastrous
the reason why degrees as a maximum temperature rise is absolutely crucial is because it is the only temperature that gives a percent chance for the most vulnerable populations to survive the effects of climate change she said
from where we stand today i hear everyone think that s impossible
well you know what
we re just going to have to make it figueres said a rise would leave most of the pacific islands parts of bangladesh and all of new york city under water
a change would give vulnerable populations a chance of surviving climate shocks like flooding cyclones droughts and rising sea levels she said
what do we do about percent of the pacific islands going under water
that means those people have no home talk about forced migration she said at the conference on women and climate change hosted by invisible dust an arts and science organisation
worldwide seas have risen cm inches since the late century driven by melting ice and the expansion of water warmed by climate change data shows and scientists predict a rise of another metre or more by
a temperature hike would lead to more frequent disasters and displace large numbers of people according to the climate vulnerable forum a coalition of the countries most affected by climate change
pacific island nations are most at risk from rising sea levels with islands facing an existential threat as most or all of their land could disappear
last year million people around the world were forced from their homes by storms floods wildfires or other natural disasters according to the internal displacement monitoring centre
given the devastating effects of climate change figueres said she was disappointed when president donald trump vowed to pull the united states out of the paris deal a year ago
trump s announcement that he was ditching the deal agreed upon by nearly countries came over opposition by businesses
to derive a conclusion that is completely contradictory to the path of history and to the interest of the us economy is actually quite sad figueres said
the withdrawal would leave the at a competitive disadvantage as global competitors shifted away from polluting fossil fuels she added
in december countries will meet in poland to set rules for the paris accord implementation including how to monitor emissions
