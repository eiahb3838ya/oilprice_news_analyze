explainer-anglophone cameroon's separatist conflict gets bloodier
dakar reuters clashes between insurgents fighting for a breakaway republic in cameroon s region and security forces have killed scores of people and displaced tens of thousands more since the conflict intensified late last year
in the bloodiest incident to date cameroonian forces surrounded and killed more than two dozen suspected separatists in the town of menka in cameroon s northwest region last weekend
insurgents have abducted and killed soldiers and policemen in guerrilla raids
graphic cameroon separatist region cameroonian forces have responded with scorched earth tactics such as burning down villages then opening fire on fleeing residents witnesses told reuters in february
the army denies such accusations
the unrest threatens the stability of one of africa s larger economies ahead of october elections widely expected to extend president paul biya s three and a half decades in power
it has hurt cocoa output and risks spilling into nigeria
at the end of world war one the league of nations carved up germany s imperial possessions in africa between allied victors mostly britain and france
most of the german colony of kamerun a swathe of central africa housing peoples speaking languages went to france
a small part went to britain
at independence in english speakers were given the choice of remaining part of cameroon or joining bigger neighbour nigeria a former british territory
they voted to stay with cameroon but have since felt increasingly marginalized by the government in yaounde hundreds of miles away
they say the best government jobs go to french speakers and that education roads and health in their western region are neglected despite cameroon having produced tens of thousands of barrels of oil a day since the mostly in the an region
initially most anglophones in cameroon wanted their grievances addressed
a minority wanted an independent state which they call ambazonia
however since late a response to protests including the jailing of some activists and sympathisers has convinced many that only severance from cameroon will satisfy their yearning for a better life
the ambazonians have printed passports designed a currency and a flag composed a national anthem and set up a satellite tv station
many of their most influential figures are in exile in europe and the united states however
they also have a vocal presence on social media reflecting the anglophone region s reputation as an unlikely but successful tech hub dubbed silicon mountain
in october lawyers and teachers in cities went on strike in protest at having to use french in schools and courtrooms
in the ensuing clashes six protesters were killed and hundreds arrested some of whom were put on trial for charges carrying long sentences or the death penalty
authorities cut internet access for three months
support for secession grew and on the anniversary of the region s independence from britain thousands took to the streets to demand a breakaway state
the military stepped in
witnesses said troops opened fire from attack helicopters the military denied this
thousands of anglophones fled the ensuing crackdown which cameroon authorities said was necessary to restore peace and curb banditry
they described it as an operation
a month later separatists launched the first guerrilla attacks on security forces killing four over a few days
cameroon s barrels per day of oil output is mostly offshore and its main economic hubs the port of douala and the capital yaounde have been unaffected
but cocoa fields in the world s fourth biggest producer have been left fallow and cameroon s nascent tech sector has withered
most of the displaced are in cameroon but more than refugees have fled to nigeria which cameroonian authorities have long feared could become a rear base for a guerrilla campaign
in theory a destabilised west cameroon might suit nigeria
abuja accepted a international court of justice ruling that the disputed and bakassi peninsula part of the anglophone belonged to cameroon despite having come close to war over it several times
but nigeria periodically grumbles about it
so far nigeria has cooperated deporting separatists including julius ayuk tabe a key leader
diplomats say it needs cameroon s help in fighting islamist militant group boko haram which plagues the neighbours common border up north
britain and france have kept their distance conscious of rivalry pitting them against each other in african civil conflicts as in rwanda in the early when tutsi rebels battled francophone hutus
france has condemned separatist violence and urged dialogue
britain has encouraged the parties to reject biya who has ruled virtually by decree since replacing a retired predecessor in is almost certain to win an october election
in he won by percent
his leadership style coupled with long absences overseas usually to switzerland with his wife makes a goodwill gesture to smooth things over unlikely
the poll will be difficult to organise in the hostile anglophone region
anywhere where voting fails to happen could ignite in fresh bouts of unrest
there is also an outside chance that the insurgency could escalate into a broader civil conflict if enough people join the rebellion and if they get enough arms
nigeria s next door delta region is awash with cheap weapons and criminal gangs who would be willing to sell although cooperation by its authorities has denied the rebels a convenient base
