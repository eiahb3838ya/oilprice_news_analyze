plan to transfer scattered gas storage assets to e p unit suppliers urged to own storage able to cover pct of sales consolidation does not cover lng storage facilities by chen aizhu beijing june reuters china s cnpc plans to consolidate underground gas storage assets into one business to expedite an infrastructure upgrade it needs to avert a supply crunch during peak winter heating season company officials told reuters
underground facilities scattered across different businesses like natural gas marketing and pipeline units are expected to be transferred to cnpc s exploration and production e p department senior company officials briefed on the plan said
cnpc is the parent of top asian oil and gas producer petrochina
china the world s gas consumer is facing a shortage of underground storage amid beijing s drive to boost use of natural gas in order to cut pollution from coal
currently its underground storages can only meet percent of total gas used versus percent in the united states leaving china vulnerable to the kind of supply crunch it suffered early this year
freezing weather and a sweeping government campaign to switch millions of homes and businesses from coal to gas led to supply cuts at some industrial users as authorities prioritised households
cnpc produces some percent of china s domestic gas and owns and operates most of the country s underground gas storage units ugs
a cnpc spokesman did not respond to request for comment
the purpose of letting e p take care of ugs business is to speed up building the storage as the upstream division has the technical and also operates the gas fields that are main sites to build the storage units said one company official
a second official said the plan could be announced as soon as in the coming weeks
the officials declined to be identified because the plan was not yet public
china now operates facilities with total designed working capacity of billion cubic metres bcm and working volume of bcm
petrochina built of them with the remaining two build by sinopec
led by cnpc china has embarked on a building boom of ugs over the next years spending more than billion to nearly double gas storages
most will be built from tapped or producing wells
some storage facilities such as in the southwest sichuan basin are already run by the e p division said a third cnpc official based in chongqing china s shale gas hub
beijing has urged china s gas suppliers mainly cnpc sinopec and cnooc to have storage facilities able to meet at least percent of their contracted sales by
the government is also expected to roll out pricing to stimulate investment
the officials briefed on the plan said the assets to be transferred will not include storages at cnpc s receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas
these will continue to be operated by a separate unit petrochina kunlun energy
