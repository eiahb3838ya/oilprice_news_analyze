interview-russia to boost presence on global lng market, helped by lower costs
russia plans to produce up to mln t lng per year by to compete with australia on global lng market by oksana kobzeva and olesya astakhova st petersburg june reuters russia plans to raise its annual production of seaborne liquefied natural gas lng to as much as million tonnes by and take market share from australia and the united states by capitalising on low costs a deputy energy minister said
in december russia s gas producer novatek and its partners including france s total launched the yamal lng plant in the arctic with capacity of million tonnes per year seen reachable by the end of
the project highlights russia s ability to produce lng in harsh climates and further strengthens its foothold in the global energy market
russia may set a goal of producing million tonnes of lng per year by deputy energy minister pavel sorokin said in an interview
we understand this from our discussions with the companies about their potential which they can add to their previously announced yamal lng aims to help russia double the country s share of the global lng market by from about percent now
qatar aided by production costs that are among the world s lowest is the biggest lng exporter with a percent market share
novatek also plans to launch lng production at the neighbouring gydan peninsula
russia s gazprom jointly with partners including shell launched the country s first lng plant in on the pacific island of sakhalin with a capacity of more than million tonnes per year
yamal lng has produced around million tonnes since its launch in december
so far russia has been the dominant player in pipeline gas supplies to europe with gazprom supplying around a third of the continent s needs
demand for seaborne lng has taken off in recent years as it is cleaner than oil or coal and can reach markets worldwide because it does not depend on pipeline networks
lng is typically more expensive than pipeline gas however
sorokin said he expects global lng demand almost to double in the next years to exceed million tonnes per year
export capacity has shot up from less than million tonnes per year in to million tonnes in and is projected to top million by
that would see the united states leapfrog australia to become the world s no
exporter
what will trigger the rivalry are the additional volumes that the or australia could supply sorokin said adding that russian companies are highly competitive due to their low costs for production and transportation
according to the skolkovo think tank average production and transportation costs at yamal lng for exports to shanghai are seen at just above per million british thermal units mbtu by
that is roughly the same as the cost for lng projects in western australia and less than the approximately for lng exports from the southeastern united states
the same figure for stands at below the lowest among current global projects
