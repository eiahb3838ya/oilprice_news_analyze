total keeps biorefinery launch on track despite farmer blockade threat
paris reuters french oil major total is continuing talks with farmers opposed to its planned la mede biodiesel refinery and plans to use tonnes of french rapeseed to supply the facility chief executive patrick pouyanne said on friday
pouyanne said the launch of the plant expected in early september was on schedule despite a call by a farm union to block oil refineries in france over a decision to allow total to use imported palm oil as a feedstock at la mede
fnsea france s largest farmers union on thursday called for the nationwide blockade from june
total has said feedstock for the tonnes per year refinery will be made up of around to percent vegetable oil and around to percent from animal fat used cooking oil and residue from used palm oil
the to percent of vegetable oil will include palm oil rapeseed oil sunflower oil and soy oil
pouyanne told journalists on the sidelines of a total shareholder meeting in paris that the company had identified around tonnes of animal fat to be used in place of palm oil cutting palm oil usage to below tonnes
i think we have a solid business case for the biorefinery pouyanne said adding total would continue talks with farmers and had decided to buy tonnes of french rapeseed per year for the plant
sincerely the tonnes is not most profitable in the feedstock that will go into the refinery he said
france consumes around million tonnes of biodiesel per year and produces about percent of that in france importing the rest including tonnes from southeast asia and argentina
our project represents around tonnes the la mede refinery project will make france a lot more independent pouyanne said
