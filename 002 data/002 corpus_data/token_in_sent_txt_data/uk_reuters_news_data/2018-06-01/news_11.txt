the oil and gas industry has come under increasing pressure from investors and activists to play a bigger role in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases in order to meet goals set out in a climate agreement signed in paris
companies are betting on increased demand for gas the least polluting fossil fuel and to a lesser extent on renewable power such as wind and solar to meet global targets of net zero emissions by the end of the century
we re hopeful that this kind of dialogue can help develop solutions to the dual challenge of managing the risks of climate change while meeting growing demand for energy which is critical to alleviating poverty and raising living standards in the developing world exxon spokesman scott silvestri said
the conference titled energy transition and care for our common home will be held in the pontifical academy of sciences a century villa in the vatican gardens known as the casina pio iv
in the encyclical called laudato si praise be on the care of our common home francis the first pope from a developing nation advocated a change of lifestyle in rich countries steeped in a throwaway consumer culture and an end to an obstructionist attitudes that sometimes put profit before the common good
in several passages in the encyclical francis confronted both climate change doubters and those who say it is not
he said there was a very solid scientific consensus that the planet was warming and that people had to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it because greenhouse gases were released mainly as a result of human francis called for policies to drastically reduce polluting gases saying technology based on fossil fuels needs to be progressively replaced without delay and sources of renewable energy developed
one of the key architects of the pope s encyclical cardinal peter turkson head of the vatican s department on promoting human development and a firm backer of the need to stem global warming will address the group the source said
last year francis who strongly supported the paris agreement on climate change implicitly criticised the united states for pulling out of the accord
