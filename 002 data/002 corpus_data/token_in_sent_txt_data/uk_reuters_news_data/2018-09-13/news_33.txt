update 2-in war on smog, china considers how to take polluting diesel trucks off the road
beijing reuters china is drawing up a plan to replace a million heavy duty diesel trucks almost percent of the national fleet with ones that burn cleaner fuel as beijing ramps up its war on pollution potentially dealing a heavy blow to oil refiners
the transport and environment ministries are considering proposals that include replacing vehicles with more modern trucks using a higher grade of diesel called national five and using electric trucks or ones that run on liquefied natural gas lng an industry source who is involved in the discussions said
he declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media
the policy would come into effect in and would be implemented in the smoggiest northern regions of the country
it was not clear when the two ministries would make their final decision
the ministry of transport mot said in july it wanted to remove a million polluting trucks in northern china as part of a plan but no details of the proposal have been reported
there are an estimated million heavy duty trucks on china s roads currently
the mot confirmed the two ministries are drafting a plan but declined to reveal more details
the ministry of environment and ecology was not immediately available for comment
the push is the latest by the government to improve air quality curb exhaust emissions from road vehicles and boost railroad use
the vast majority of the billion tonnes of freight transported across china last year was by highway
the two ministries have held several meetings with industrial experts in recent months to iron out details of the proposal the source said
he said the government is also considering subsidies for electric and gas vehicles because they are more expensive than diesel trucks
the government may also set stricter emissions targets for heavy duty trucks and increase emissions checks on vehicles the source said
the national five standard allows a maximum sulphur content of parts per millions ppm
the final policy may end up including a combination of several or all three of the proposals
but if it pulled so many diesel trucks off the road en masse it would remove as much as million tonnes of annual demand according to reuters calculations based on trucks that use litres of diesel per miles
that s percent of china s annual diesel output
if adopted it could slow china s outright crude oil demand growth which has been a key global price driver and revenue safeguard for the petroleum industry
it would also have a major impact on oil refiners across asia including china s majors sinopec and cnpc
refiners geared towards lower diesel grades will out as the world s biggest diesel consumer moves towards cleaner fuel
the industry produced about million tonnes of diesel last year with retail prices recently surging after independent refiners ran low on stocks during the summer maintenance period
the measures might further dampen diesel demand from truck drivers who have been struggling with high prices han cong fuel analyst with consultancy jlc said
