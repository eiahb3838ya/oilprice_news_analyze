power plant delays fuel tensions over rio's giant mongolia copper mine
mining giant looks to build power plant for oyu tolgoi domestic electricity has to be secured by political instability a key issue former govt official by barbara lewis and munkhchimeg davaasharav sept reuters nearly years on from the launch of a giant copper and gold project in mongolia rio tinto is still looking to secure a domestic power source it needs for the mine under an agreement with the government
oyu tolgoi located in the south gobi region near landlocked mongolia s southern border with china is scheduled to complete a billion underground expansion for first production by creating one of the world s biggest copper suppliers
the project launched in and by mongolia is set to transform the country s tiny economy and is also key for rio as the biggest potential growth area for its copper business
but it has been beset by squabbles over cost overruns and claims of unpaid taxes
under an agreement with the government by a domestic power source must be found for the project currently running on power imported from china
but while rio has invited three chinese firms to submit bids to build a power station at a cost of up to billion it has yet to make a final decision on a
rio also has yet to have its permits for the plant renewed by the mongolian government according to a government source
the main challenge remains the same political instability and unpredictability said otgochuluu chuluuntseren a former government official who also served as an oyu tolgoi board member
oyu tolgoi has suffered repeated delays amid government wrangling the reshuffling of officials disputes over mongolia s share of the returns and opposition to foreign participation among nationalist politicians
complicating the power project has been the mongolian government s desire to kickstart the nearby tavan tolgoi coal project one of the world s biggest deposits with an estimated reserve of more than billion tonnes which lies just km miles from oyu tolgoi
rio had originally planned to build its own power plant but it suspended construction plans in after it was encouraged by the government to switch to a proposed plant at tavan tolgoi where it would be an rather than investor
however in february this year the government cancelled a agreement setting up a framework for on a shared power plant with rio saying the project still lacked a credible lead investor and could not be completed on time
oyu tolgoi currently pays about million a year to buy electricity from china according to an industry source with knowledge of the matter
the project is now looking at options for a domestic power source said luke colton chief financial officer at turquoise hill resources the unit that owns percent of the project
an oyu plant is currently the most feasible option that could deliver a domestic power source within the shortest timeframe colton said in a call on second quarter earnings at the end of july
rio tinto said it was working with the government and other stakeholders to progress the building of a new power station
rio tinto and its partners are committed to securing a domestic power supply within the agreed timeframe a spokesman said
some government officials have expressed impatience about the power plant delays underscoring the political challenges facing the project
oyu tolgoi should stop playing with the mongolian state mongolia s energy minister davaasuren tserenpil said on the ministry s official twitter account last month in extracts from an interview to local media
oyu tolgoi got permission from the ministry in to build the power plant on its site but it has done otgochuluu said transporting power from a tavan tolgoi plant to oyu tolgoi would be more efficient than transporting coal to a likely plant at the oyu tolgoi mine
of the three contractors invited by rio to tender for the project power construction corp of china spokesman sun jianli told reuters the bid was preliminary and the project was still very far away
the others china machinery engineering corp and harbin electric international declined to comment
if the plant is not built on time rio and the government would need to negotiate on alternative supply arrangements potentially a sensitive task as discord continues to rumble around the project
it is a huge and prized project
rio tinto and the mongolian government would do everything to avoid any major disruption to supply said shairaz ahmed manager of statistical analysis international copper study group reporting by barbara lewis and munkhchimeg davaasharav additional reporting by david stanway in shanghai melanie burton in melbourne and tom daly in beijing editing by richard pullin
