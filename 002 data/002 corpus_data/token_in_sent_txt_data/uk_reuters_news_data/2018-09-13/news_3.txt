dryness cuts crop for world's largest sugarcane plant in brazil
pradópolis brazil reuters the world s largest sugarcane processing plant a brazilian mill able to process million tonnes per year has recorded a drop in cane crushing for the second consecutive season because of excessive dryness in sao paulo state an executive said on thursday
brazil s the world s largest cane growing region will likely have a smaller crop this year for the fourth consecutive year
besides the weather analysts blame factors including companies reducing investment
but the owner of the mill sao sao martinho sa is one of the few companies in the brazilian sugar industry that has stayed in the black having reported profits for almost every quarter in the last four years while maintaining normal levels of cane field renovation and crop care
the mill s cane crushing capacity will fall primarily because of drier soil caused by less rain and contributing to a smaller crop the executive said
it has been like that for the last four years or so drier said mário ortiz gandini the head of agriculture and technology at sao martinho sa which owns the mill in the municipality of pradópolis ribeirão preto region
gandini hopes the dryness is not a permanent trend he told reuters on the sidelines of an event organized by machine maker case ih to present a new cane harvester
i prefer to believe that this is temporary
i don t think it is a new pattern gandini said
the sao martinho executive said that temperature fluctuations in the pacific ocean which drive the climate phenomenon known as el niño and la niña are impacting rain levels and are likely to blame for the dryness
the company uses data measuring pacific ocean temperatures to plan forward operations he said
the average cane production in the hectares around the usina sao martinho in pradópolis is likely to reach tonnes per hectare in the current season gandini said down from tonnes per hectare in the previous crop and a historic average of tonnes per hectare
gandini said the region s fields were experiencing rains and next year s production will depend on rains from october to february
