update 1-global oil demand to top 100 mln bpd but outlook may cloud
london reuters world oil consumption will top million barrels per day bpd in the next three months putting upward pressure on prices although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this demand the international energy agency said on thursday
the iea maintained its forecast of strong growth in global oil demand this year of million bpd and another million bpd in unchanged from its previous projection
things are tightening up the agency that advises western governments on energy policy said in its monthly report
the price range for brent of per barrel in place since april could be sanctions on iran s energy industry which come into force in november have already cut supply back to lows while falling venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere will also keep the balance between supply and demand tight the iea said
but it said rising demand could also be checked
as we move into a possible risk to our forecast lies in some key emerging economies partly due to currency depreciations versus the dollar raising the cost of imported energy
in addition there is a risk to growth from an escalation of trade disputes the agency said
the united states and china have imposed a series of tariffs on each other s goods since may that have unnerved equity markets while a rising dollar has put emerging market currencies under pressure raising the energy bill for some of the world s largest oil importers
demand from nations not in the oecd group of industrialised countries led by china and india is expected to rise by million bpd to million bpd this year and by million bpd to million bpd next year the iea said
global demand will hit a high of million bpd in the final quarter of this year before moderating to mln bpd in the first quarter of next year the agency said
we are entering a very crucial period for the oil market
the situation in venezuela could deteriorate even faster strife could return to libya and the days to will reveal more decisions taken by countries and companies with respect to iranian oil purchases the iea said referring to the day sanctions on iran take effect
it remains to be seen if other producers decide to increase their production it said demand for crude from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will moderate in to million bpd from an estimated million bpd this year the iea said
iran opec s member is feeling the effect of the sanctions
the iea said crude output fell in august by bpd from july to a low of million bpd while exports fell by bpd to million bpd from a peak of around million bpd in may
