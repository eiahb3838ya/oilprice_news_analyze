rpt-column-u.s. oil boom starts to cool, tightening global market: kemp
repeats sept story with no change to text

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london sept reuters oil production is running into capacity constraints which are starting to have a material impact on the global availability of crude causing the market to tighten and putting upward pressure on prices
the biggest problem is the lack of sufficient pipeline capacity to move oil from shale wells in western texas and eastern new mexico to refineries in the midwest and export terminals on the gulf coast
but production in the permian basin has also been constrained by shortages of labour equipment and materials which have pushed drilling pressure pumping and completion costs sharply higher
the most obvious impact has been a sharp drop in the price that permian producers receive for their oil compared with other benchmarks especially brent
west texas producers are currently receiving just per barrel for oil delivered to midland in the heart of the permian compared with for north sea brent
the massive discount reflects the twin difficulties of moving the crude out of the permian to the main inland trading hub at cushing in oklahoma or down to the refineries and export terminals on the coast
midland crude is currently trading at discount of per barrel compared with cushing while cushing is itself priced at a further discount of to brent
midland has traded at an average discount to brent of more than per barrel this year up from in and less than in and the price differential is steadily worsening
midland prices have mostly been falling this year while brent has climbed leaving midland up by just per barrel percent since the end of june while brent has risen by percent
softening midland prices have already eased the region s drilling frenzy with the number of rigs drilling in the permian flat over the last three months after rising by more than in the previous year
well completions which are more relevant for production also show signs of stabilising in recent months after increasing fairly consistently over the two previous years drilling productivity report eia august
since the permian basin has been the biggest contributor to oil output growth in the last two years the slowdown is starting to temper expectations for further increases in the rest of and through
the energy information administration now expects crude production in to average million barrels per day bpd down from million bpd at the time of its july forecast
the agency has cut its prediction for even more sharply to million bpd down from million bpd at the time of its may forecast energy outlook eia september
slower growth in production when combined with strong demand production problems in venezuela and other countries and the of sanctions on iran is enough to tighten the global market in late
