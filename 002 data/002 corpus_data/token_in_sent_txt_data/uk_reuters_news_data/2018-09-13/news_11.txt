u.s. oil producers lock-in 2019, 2020 revenue as prices rally
new york reuters shale producers are locking in prices for their production as much as three years into the future in a sign that strong domestic crude pricing is nearing a peak according to market sources familiar with money flows
crude prices for and based on an average of each year s monthly contracts have climbed this week above and a barrel respectively the highest levels in over three years
the rally comes even as prices have dropped from the highs touched during the summer
hedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year said michael tran commodity strategist at rbc capital markets noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets
hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans
such bets signal producers will continue to expand output keeping a lid on prices according to crude traders and brokers
the nation s output this year has climbed above million barrels per day bpd close to top producers russia and saudi arabia
that output is forecast to grow next year by bpd to average million bpd
there was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week with just shy of million barrels changing hands in a day an energy derivatives broker said signalling strong hedging interest
swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production
almost percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars and and the remaining percent for this year the broker said adding that there was a small amount of calendar activity during the week

the move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries
many shale producers hedged production at about a barrel which backfired as crude climbed to more than a barrel last quarter the highest level since
as a result producers are using more collars a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally
we ve been building a lot of collar structures christian kendall chief executive of denbury resources inc said last week noting that the instruments will protect its production at about a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high per barrel
denbury is nearly percent hedged for and will add hedges to get to percent to percent of production kendall said
meanwhile oil companies that drill in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico where local prices are below futures because of full pipelines are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses
we have done an extensive amount of basis hedging said javan ottoson chief executive of sm energy co which reported million barrels of permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with million barrels of production similarly covered at this time last year
permian producers increased their hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with concho resources inc and energen corp leading the surge said consultancy wood mackenzie
for basis hedging rose by percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in
open interest in crude futures for delivery in months to months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in cme group inc said
oil producers are saying we re comfortable with our hedging in the front we have appropriate hedges in place but what s going to happen next said owain johnson managing director of energy research and product development at cme group
