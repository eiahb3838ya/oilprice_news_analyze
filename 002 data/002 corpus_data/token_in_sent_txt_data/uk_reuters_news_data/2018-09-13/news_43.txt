u.s. utility solar contracts 'exploded' in 2018 despite tariffs -report
reuters procurement of solar energy by utilities exploded in the first half of prompting a prominent research group to boost its installation forecast on thursday despite the trump administration s steep tariffs on imported panels
a record gigawatts gw of utility solar projects were procured in the first six months of this year after president donald trump in january announced a percent tariff on panels produced overseas according to the report by wood mackenzie power renewables and industry trade group the solar energy industries association
as a result the research firm raised its solar forecast for through by gw
the forecast is still percent lower than before the tariffs were announced
a gigawatt of solar energy can power about homes
procurement soared in part because the percent tariff was lower than many in the industry had feared the report said
seia strongly lobbied against a tariff saying it would drive up the cost of solar and hurt the industry s robust job growth
in addition panel prices have fallen faster than expected because china pulled back its subsidies for the renewable power source in june creating an oversupply of modules in the global market that has eroded the impact of the tariff
module prices averaged cents a watt in the second quarter the report said cents higher than the same period in but far below the cents a watt they hit late last year as the industry fretted about a looming duty on imports
in every segment of the market except residential system pricing is at its lowest level ever the report said
utility projects make up more than half the solar market
utilities are eager to get projects going because of a federal solar tax credit that will begin phasing out in
next year will be the most impacted by the tariffs wood mackenzie said
developers will begin projects next year to claim the highest level of tax credit but delay buying modules until because the tariff drops by percent each year
in the first half of the year the installed gw of solar accounting for nearly a third of new electricity generating capacity additions
in the second quarter residential installations were roughly flat with last year at mw while commercial and industrial installations slid percent to mw
