column-oil prices are re-entering the tweet zone: kemp
london reuters oil prices have risen back to levels that earlier this year prompted president donald trump to take to twitter and demand opec do more to bring them down
brent futures settled well above per barrel on wednesday the highest for over three months and above levels that have spurred the president to complain in the past
chartbook the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up and they are doing little to help
if anything they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members the president wrote in july
reduce pricing now the president demanded in his trademark style when brent was trading at only per barrel on july
the president had already grumbled on june when brent was over writing oil prices are too high opec is at it again
not good
and his first intervention came on april when brent was just tweeting oil prices are artificially very high
no good and will not be accepted the president has repeatedly blamed opec for not pumping enough even as his administration has worked closely with saudi arabia to cut off oil exports from iran
the renewed rise in prices must therefore be increasing the risk the president will complain again and press opec in effect saudi arabia which holds almost all spare capacity to increase production further
there is some evidence that presidential tweets as well as private conversations with saudi policymakers have influenced the kingdom s production policy
the president s tweets between late april and early july coincided with a sharp change in saudi rhetoric about the state of the oil market and need for more supplies followed quickly by a ramp up in the kingdom s production
while some commentators have dismissed the tweets as empty political theatre they have probably had a real impact on supplies
the president s interventions on twitter and are therefore significant for prices at least in the short and medium term
oil prices are always politically sensitive in the united states but especially now with sanctions on iran due to be on and congressional elections on
neither the white house nor saudi arabia wants to be blamed for pursuing policies that push up costs for american motorists
the cost of living has already emerged as a minor electoral issue with an argument about whether faster wage gains are being wiped out by inflation
presidential tweets are therefore an attempt to shift blame as well as push allies to increase output faster and further than they might otherwise
so the renewed rise in benchmark oil prices is unlikely to be welcomed by the white house but prices might have headroom to rise by another few dollars before drawing another intervention
as earlier tweets have made clear the president worries about gasoline prices paid by motorists rather than the price of crude
wholesale gasoline prices are still below levels that prompted tweets earlier this year at around per barrel compared with to between late april and early july
the switch from summer grade gasoline which is more expensive for refiners to produce to winter grade has helped cut gasoline prices faced by motorists
gasoline prices have also softened as refiners have processed record volumes of crude during the summer months and gasoline stocks have risen to a record for the time of year
gasoline futures are currently trading just per barrel above brent compared with at the time of the president s tweets
while crude prices have already returned to the tweet zone fuel prices are still a few dollars per barrel below which may reduce sensitivity for the time being
the united states and saudi arabia are fully aligned on the issue of iran sanctions and senior policymakers from both countries appear to be coordinating closely
saudi arabia s oil minister has been on a visit to the united states this week including discussions with the energy secretary
both countries have a strong interest in the successful introduction of sanctions without causing a politically damaging spike in oil prices
but gasoline prices are already fairly high and most hedge fund managers are now betting they will rise even further in the future
the policy pathway for reducing iran s oil exports without creating a spike in fuel prices is narrow and may be difficult to execute in practice
if crude and gasoline prices do continue to rise the white house may be tempted to release more crude from the strategic petroleum reserve or renew its pressure on saudi arabia to increase output even faster either via public tweet or private conversations
