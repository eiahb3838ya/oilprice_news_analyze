dryness after summer heatwave seen cutting eu rapeseed sowings
european heatwave hinders rapeseed sowing ground too dry for sowings france germany uk poland all hit hamburg sept reuters dry soil after european summer heatwaves means farmers have been unable to plant all the rapeseed they wished experts said on thursday
the ground may have been too dry for sowings in parts of the top four producers germany france britain and poland
high grain prices after the poor european union crop this summer also made some farmers turn to cereals from rapeseed europe s main oilseed for edible oil and biodiesel production
we anticipate a fall in the rapeseed area firstly because margins are less attractive than last year given the rise in prices of winter cereals and also because weather conditions are dry all over the eu from the south to the north said hemeline macret of french analysts strategie grains
drought caused serious difficulties for rapeseed sowing in germany and analysts estimate about million hectares were sown down by about hectares on this summer s crop
the dryness created major problems for german sowings and i think a considerable number of farmers gave up and have decided to plant other grains one analyst said
seeds in a lot of areas especially north germany also lack enough moisture to parched land hampered rapeseed sowing in france raising the risk that farmers will abandon some drillings
france has experienced its summer on record this year
a warm dry end to summer increased the strain on cropland during rapeseed sowing
we re seeing an accumulation of problems said fabien lagarde of oilseed institute terres inovia
soil preparation was mostly done in dry conditions not all intended sowings were able to be carried out notably in the north and now the lack of rain is hindering the emergence of rapeseed crops in britain are off to a poor start due to drought and the spread of cabbage stem flea beetles
because of the drought and the flea beetle issues we could see a reduced production of oilseed rape said benjamin bodart director at crm agricommodities
bodart said rapeseed planting had just finished and the area was expected to be down on last season
flea beetles have posed a significant threat to british rapeseed after the eu restricted use of insecticides known as neonicotinoids to protect bees
poland also suffered dryness during the rapeseed planting window said wojtek sabaranski of analysts sparks polska
sabaranski estimates poland s winter rapeseed sowings for the harvest is not larger than the hectares harvested in
there are now concerns over uneven sprouting due to insufficient moisture especially in the western part of the country sabaranski said
