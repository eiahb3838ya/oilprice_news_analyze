global oil demand to top 100 mln bpd, but outlook clouds -iea
london sept reuters world oil consumption will top million barrels per day in the next three months tightening the market and putting pressure on prices but emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent demand the international energy agency said on thursday
the iea maintained its forecast of strong growth in global oil demand this year of million barrels per day bpd and another million bpd in unchanged from its previous projection
things are tightening up the agency said in its monthly report
the price range for brent of per barrel in place since april could be the imposition of sanctions on iran s energy sector have already cut supply to lows while the decline in venezuelan output from spiralling economic crisis as well as unplanned outages elsewhere will keep the balance between supply and demand tight the iea said
global demand will hit a high of million bpd in the final quarter of this year before moderating to million bpd in the first quarter of next year the agency said
as we move into a possible risk to our forecast lies in some key emerging economies partly due to currency depreciations versus the dollar raising the cost of imported energy
in addition there is a risk to growth from an escalation of trade disputes the agency said
