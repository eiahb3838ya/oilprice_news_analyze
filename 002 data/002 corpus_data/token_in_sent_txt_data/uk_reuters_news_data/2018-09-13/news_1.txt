san francisco sept thomson reuters foundation more than two dozen of the world s largest cities are no longer increasing their greenhouse gas emissions they announced at a global climate summit in san francisco

so far cities that have peaked their emissions are in industrialized nations in north america europe and australia research by found
those cities are home to million people the group said
the absence of developing world cities from the list suggests they may need more funding to make needed changes hidalgo told the thomson reuters foundation
we must strive toward funds going toward the ecological and energy transition where it is most urgent including in developing cities she said
