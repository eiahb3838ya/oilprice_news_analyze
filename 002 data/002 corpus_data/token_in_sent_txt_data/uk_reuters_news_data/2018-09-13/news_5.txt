oil firm partially returns area won in mexico energy reform auction
mexico city sept reuters consorcio petrolero del golfo a small energy firm operating in mexico has returned of an onshore area won in a auction the country s oil regulator said on thursday citing studies showing limited potential for production
companies operating in mexico have so far returned all or part of three oil and gas areas mostly awarded during early auctions of the country s flagship energy reform because of similar reasons as well as high taxes and development program demands
this has cast doubt on the sustainability of some projects in the reform intended to open the industry to foreign investors
the partial return of the area which includes the benavides and primavera fields in the burgos basin in northern mexico was approved this week by the national hydrocarbon commision cnh the regulator said in a statement
the consortium based in the state of tamaulipas notified regulators of its decision earlier this year
technical studies showed no potential to produce hydrocarbons the regulator cited the consortium as saying
the firm still has to complete the minimum development plan and other commitments approved by the commission
canamex energy holdings a consortium of dutch and mexican firms received government approval to terminate a license to produce crude and gas at the moloacan field due to difficulties in paying taxes and other fees
canamex had offered a percent royalty the highest in that bidding round
in august a consortium led by capricorn energy and mexico s citla energy requested to return a portion of a area won earlier this year
it told the regulator its block was near an environmentally protected zone
very high royalties jeopardize the projects economic viability
many relatively new operators did this said pablo medina research vice president of consultancy welligence in houston
it would make sense offering these areas again
questions are under which terms and who would be interested as the country s political context has changed he added
andres manuel lopez obrador who will take office in december said in august that auctions for oil and gas areas are suspended until existing contracts are reviewed by his government
it is still unclear if february tenders and a pemex s search for a partner will be halted
