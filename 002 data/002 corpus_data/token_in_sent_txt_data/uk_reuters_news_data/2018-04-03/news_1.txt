group pursuing floating wind farm off california coast
april reuters edp renewables and four other companies have joined with a northern california power provider to develop the first offshore wind farm to boast advanced floating turbines the group said in a statement on tuesday
the redwood coast energy authority rcea a local government authority that provides electricity to most of california s humboldt county solicited bids for an offshore wind project earlier this year because it is seeking to generate more of its power needs locally
the group plans to submit an unsolicited lease application to the federal bureau of ocean energy management in may or june of this year said lori biondini director of business development for rcea
in the meantime it is speaking to fishing industry and department of defense representatives about suitable locations for the wind farm
the wind power will help balance out the large amounts of solar energy consumed in rcea s territory biondini said
currently rcea sources solar from southern california and wind energy from oregon and washington
humboldt county has the best wind resources off the coast of california the group said in a statement but the deep water along its coast has prevented development of standard fixed offshore wind turbines
floating wind turbines are costly and have not been deployed widely
a small megawatt floating wind farm began operating off the coast of scotland last year
the humboldt county project is expected to be between and mw the group said
participants in the project include floating wind turbine maker principle power inc aker solutions ecological consultants
