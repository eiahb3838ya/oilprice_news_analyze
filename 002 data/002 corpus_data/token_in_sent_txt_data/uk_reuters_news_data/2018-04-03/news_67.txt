sydney reuters australian gas producer santos ltd said on tuesday it would engage with harbour energy after receiving a billion takeover offer from the company its fourth unsolicited bid since august
the bid valuing santos at a percent premium to its last close would give harbour access to a recently revived company with a low cost of oil production and stakes in liquefied natural gas lng in the where demand is soaring

but even if accepted by santos this time round a deal may be fraught with political and regulatory risk australia s lingering energy supply crisis has stoked fears that companies that come under foreign ownership may ignore domestic needs
the price is definitely in the ball park of something that we will seriously consider said andy forster senior investment officer at argo investments santo s shareholder

harbour s chief executive linda cook said the plan for santos was one of growth in australia papua new guinea and beyond
we are prepared to move expeditiously through the due diligence phase to immediately begin the government review and approval process cook said in a phone interview
but given the highly politicized nature of the australian domestic gas landscape and santos key role there analysts and investors see government approval as a key risk to any deal
a takeover would be subject to government approvals and will be scrutinized by australia s foreign investment review board firb which provides recommendations to the government
cook said harbour was preparing its firb application
santos more sensitive assets include its interest in the gladstone lng project in the australian state of queensland and the strategically important cooper basin in the country s east where significant onshore oil and gas deposits are located

santos was in considerable trouble just a few years ago struggling with high debt and low oil and gas prices
but asset sales debt reduction and have led it back to health
as a result santos is seen to be able to produce profitably at average oil costs of just over per barrel versus actual costs of around a barrel
the company s focus on lng which is seen to be a bigger growth markets in coming years than oil is also seen as attractive for investors
harbour plans to fund the takeover through a combination of debt and equity with morgan and morgan stanley underwriting billion of debt

it is expected to resume operations in april
