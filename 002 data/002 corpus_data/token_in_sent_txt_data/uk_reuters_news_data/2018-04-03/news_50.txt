prairie mining starts legal action against poland's environment ministry
warsaw april reuters australia s prairie mining said it filed a lawsuit in a warsaw civil court on friday against the polish environment ministry seeking an extension to the company s exclusive rights to a mining project in the country
the news sent the miner s shares plunging percent in london and percent in warsaw
prairie mining secured in the exclusive right to apply for a mining concession for the jan karski mine in southeast poland and had until april to file its application
the company said in a statement on tuesday that it had not been able to apply for the concession because it first needs to obtain an environmental permit from local authorities which it said has been delayed
as a result it said it asked the ministry in december to sign a mining usufruct agreement on the project which precludes any other parties being granted any licence over all or part of the jan karski concessions
the ministry was required by law to have responded to the request within three months but had failed to do so prairie said in a statement
accordingly the company has now commenced legal proceedings against the ministry of environment through the polish courts in order to protect the company s security of tenure over the jan karski concessions the company said
prairie s share price had previously been buoyed by plans for the development
the company said in october that upfront capital costs for development of the mine totalled million and that it was in advanced talks with chinese lenders who could finance percent of it
since winning the general election in the conservative law and justice party pis has introduced many regulatory changes prompting some investors to take legal action against the government
prairie in its lawsuit demanded that the mining usufruct agreement be signed so that it can still have the exclusive right to apply for the mining concession
it said a polish civil court could enforce the agreement in place of the ministry
a spokesman for the environment ministry was not immediately available to comment
jan karski situated in an area neighbouring the bogdanka coal mine would produce coking coal
poland generates most of its electricity from coal produced mostly by mining companies which survived a slump in coal prices thanks to state aid in
in october company invenergy llc which says it has spent more than million building windfarms in poland said it was formally in dispute with the polish government over state companies failing to honour contracts
