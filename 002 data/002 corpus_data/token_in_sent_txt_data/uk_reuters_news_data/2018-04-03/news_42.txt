philippine leader ready to renew peace talks with maoist rebels
manila april reuters philippine president rodrigo duterte on tuesday expressed willingness to reopen peace talks with rebels more than four months after breaking off intermittent negotiations and seeking a terrorist tag for the communists
the justice ministry asked a local court in february to declare the communist party of the philippines cpp and its armed wing the new people s army npa terrorist bodies that duterte had sought to destroy
when he came to office in july he freed some maoist leaders and appointed leftists to the cabinet to draw them into peace talks
however the peace process was abandoned in november with duterte furious after what he called repeated attacks by the guerrillas during the talks
we are not enemies duterte said on tuesday addressing npa fighters in a speech in central oriental mindoro province a rebel stronghold where he attended the inauguration of a bridge project
if we can have a middle ground i am not really closing everything he said likening the disagreement between his government and the rebels to a lover s quarrel that eventually he thought will end
ending the nearly long conflict with the communists in which more than people have been killed was among duterte s priorities when he took office
negotiations to end the revolt have been on and off since being brokered by norway in
let us agree on some fundamentals duterte said adding that he was ready to spend money to subsidise the rebels
before resuming talks however he said the rebels must agree to a ceasefire stop extortion activities and abandon their proposal for the creation of a coalition government
