portugal looks to renewables as march output tops mainland power demand
lisbon april reuters for the first time in at least four decades portugal s monthly renewable energy production in march exceeded power demand on the mainland an industry report said on tuesday adding that it expected this to become a trend
renewable energy accounted for percent of mainland electricity consumption last month the report by the portuguese renewable energy association and the sustainable earth system association said citing data from power grid operator ren
while fossil fuel plants still worked for short periods to complement the electricity supply those were fully compensated by other periods of greater renewable production
last month s achievement is an example of what will happen more frequently in the near future
it is expected that by the production of renewable electricity will be able to guarantee in a way the total annual electricity consumption of mainland portugal the report said
these data besides indicating a historical milestone in the portuguese electricity sector demonstrate that renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country s electricity separately on tuesday the government suspended subsidies for guaranteed power supplies paid to producers worth about million euros a year most of which goes to fossil fuel plants left in mode
hydroelectric dams in march accounted for percent of monthly consumption followed by wind power at percent
portugal with its long atlantic coast line was one of the early pioneers in the mass use of wind power
march saw four times the monthly average rainfall ending a long period of severe drought in the country according to the portuguese sea and atmosphere institute
the downpour refilled most of the dammed reservoirs to levels of over percent
the renewable generation reduced portugal s carbon dioxide emissions by million tons and helped the country s export balance
the average daily wholesale market price fell to euros per mwh from euros a year earlier when renewables were able to meet only percent of the electricity demand amid the drought
portugal s electricity prices are among the highest in the european union
