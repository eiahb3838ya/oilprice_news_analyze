exclusive-eu antitrust regulators set to accept gazprom concessions -sources
gazprom concessions include linking gas prices to hub prices gazprom offers to scrap territorial curbs against gas settlement of eu case would stave off possible hefty fine adds european commission gazprom decline comment by foo yun chee and alissa de carbonnel brussels april reuters the european union and gazprom are poised to settle a antitrust case after the russian gas company agreed to price reforms and to allow rivals to gain a foothold in eastern europe people familiar with the matter said
a decision by the european commission could come as early as this month although the timing could still slip the people said
a settlement would allow gazprom to avoid a possible fine of as much as percent of its global turnover
the case underlines the rocky relationship between europe and russia which have clashed over ukraine syria and most recently a nerve attack against a former russian spy living in england that resulted in expulsions of diplomats on both sides
last year gazprom which supplies a third of the eu s gas offered to link prices to benchmarks such as western european gas market hubs and border prices in france germany and italy and allow price reviews every two years
the company also pledged to scrap all contractual restrictions which bar clients from reselling its gas and let the bulgarian transmission network operator take charge of the balkan country s gas flows to greece
gazprom has tweaked its original proposal after negative feedback from eu countries and customers but the main elements remain unchanged according to a recent draft seen by reuters
revisions have been mainly technical such as lower service fees charged by gazprom which could result in its clients saving millions of euros
both the commission and gazprom declined to comment
gazprom found itself in the eu antitrust crosshairs in after regulators raided about offices of its customers in eastern and central europe seizing more than documents
at issue was whether gazprom had imposed unfair prices by linking gas price to oil prices divided up gas markets by hindering the free flow of gas across eu countries and prevented the diversification of the supply of gas
