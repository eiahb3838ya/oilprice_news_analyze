update 1-u.s. locks in anti-dumping duties on biodiesel from argentina, indonesia
washington reuters the international trade commission said on tuesday that the dumping of biodiesel imports from argentina and indonesia harms american producers a move that locks in place duties on the imports
the commission s final phase determination followed a commerce department move in february to add duties of percent to percent to already steep duties on imported biodiesel from argentina and indonesia
the independent panel had already found in the subsidy cases that the imports caused such injuries

the vote marked the last procedural hurdle before final antidumping orders can be issued this month the board said in a statement
this vote today finalizes the case to address the harm that unfair trade practices have had on the biodiesel industry said donnell rehagen the board s chief executive officer
