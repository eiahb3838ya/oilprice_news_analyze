saudi anti-corruption sweep will reach low-level cases -official
riyadh reuters saudi arabia s public prosecutor said on tuesday that the government campaign against corruption which targeted the business and political elite last year would work its way through offences
the campaign is ongoing as long as there is even a simple case of corruption and it will not end until all corruption cases are finished prosecutor sheikh saud told state television in a clip posted online without providing details
authorities rounded up dozens of princes top officials and businessmen in november on crown prince mohammed bin salman s orders with many confined and interrogated at riyadh s opulent hotel
most detainees including global investor prince alwaleed bin talal were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government which says it arranged to seize more than billion through such deals
the ritz was cleared out and reopened to the public in february though people who had not reached settlements by then remained in custody and could face trial
prince mohammed is currently touring the united states to promote investment in the kingdom touting the corruption sweep as critical to transforming an economy long plagued by graft but now contending with lower global crude prices
yet the campaign remains shrouded in secrecy with few specific allegations or details of financial settlements revealed
