europe's digital clocks back to speed after grid operators fix lag
sarajevo reuters tardy europeans have one less excuse for being late after europe s power network operators fixed a lag of nearly six minutes in digital clocks that was caused by a power grid dispute between kosovo and serbia
digital clocks that use the mains frequency in an electric power grid to keep time like those on microwaves and clock radios began falling behind earlier this year when the frequency in europe s transmission network dropped
this was caused by a power shortage lasting from to march after kosovo began to use more power than it produced and serbia which is in charge of balancing kosovo s grid failed to fill the gap
the european network of transmission system operators for electricity said on tuesday that of its members had carried out a compensation scheme to return the mains frequency across europe to its standard of hertz hz from hz
said that to do so the grid operators had put more energy into the system maintaining an average electric frequency at hz during march
one of the effects is notably that the digital clocks geared by electric frequency are now back on time it said in a statement
serbia and kosovo maintain conflicting claims of ownership of kosovo s power grid
both power grids are synchronised with others in europe
said it would continue to support all parties in finding a long lasting solution to energy dispute between serbia and kosovo
kosovo seceded from serbia in
belgrade which still refuses to recognise kosovo committed to normalise ties with pristina key to its progress towards european union membership
but little progress has been made
as part of the deal both countries in signed an agreement on operating their grids but it has never been enacted as they maintain conflicting claims about ownership of the power grid in kosovo
serbs in the north of kosovo who do not recognise its institutions refuse to pay their electricity bills and kosovo s grid operator kostt says that the serbian counterpart ems obstructs kostt s efforts to become a member
