update 2-u.s. strikes cripple syria's chemical weapons ability -pentagon
new throughout adds details on targets of strikes by phil stewart and idrees ali washington april reuters the united states said on saturday it overwhelmed and evaded syrian air defenses overnight to strike every target at the heart of syria s chemical weapons program in a attack from the air and sea alongside british and french allies
although the operation was secretly unfolding for hours before the first impact it only took minutes from the first to the last detonation from missile strikes on three syrian chemical weapons targets officials said
marine lieutenant general kenneth mckenzie director of the joint staff rejected assertions from russia and syria that scores of the western missiles were shot down
he said russian air defenses did not fire while syrian air defenses were completely ineffective against an attack from multiple directions involving not just british and french aircraft but also naval destroyers a cruiser and french frigate and even a submarine
the syrian air defenses not only missed the incoming missiles but they kept firing even after the last british and french strikes were complete
some of those more than syrian missile interceptors he suggested might have hit civilian targets
when you shoot iron into the sky without guidance it will inevitably fall to earth mckenzie told reporters
pentagon spokeswoman dana white warned that russia was actively attempting to sow confusion about the attack
the russian disinformation campaign has already begun
there has been a percent increase in russian trolls in the last hours white said
the prime target of the operation was the barza research and development center in the greater damascus area which mckenzie noted was one of the most heavily defended aerospace areas in the barza took the brunt of the fire with tomahawk cruise missiles and joint air to surface missiles
though some of syria s chemical weapons infrastructure was still left i think we ve dealt them a severe blow mckenzie said adding it would set the program back for years
despite severely damaging the infrastructure with the strikes mckenzie said the pentagon would not rule out that the assad government still had capability to use such weapons again
there s still a residual element of the syrian program that s out there he said
i m not going to say that they re going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future
i suspect however they ll think long and hard about reporting by phil stewart idrees ali and doina chiacu writing by jeff mason editing by david gregorio
