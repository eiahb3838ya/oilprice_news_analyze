rpt-sour brew: new tax rules take steam out of china's teapot refiners
repeats item with no changes to text teapot refiners swing into losses on stricter tax collection some teapots shut for maintenance amid high crude prices independents losing market share to rivals processing losses for teapots at yuan a tonne analyst by meng meng and chen aizhu beijing june reuters china s independent oil refiners are suffering a drastic change of fortune as new tax rules shrinking diesel demand and higher crude prices threaten their nearly profit bonanza
industry executives and analysts said nearly private refiners often called teapots which account for a fifth of china s almost million barrels per day bpd in crude oil imports are losing money and market share
several have shut for maintenance to cut exposure to the market and some teapots may have to shut for good if the conditions continue
the gains in retail prices at pumps in recent weeks have been completely wiped out by higher costs of crude and a hefty consumption tax said gao jian crude oil analyst with china sublime information group
we expect much weaker margins in june and july as more orders booked at peak crude prices arrive gao said
asian refining margins have thinned as crude prices surged amid output cuts led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec venezuela supply disruptions and looming sanctions against major exporter iran
but china s independents have also been hit hard by new tax rules that cut even further into their profit
last month teapots lost yuan per tonne of crude oil processed data provided by zibo longzong information group showed
that is a stunning reversal from a profit of yuan a tonne in early
beijing enacted new rules in march to enforce collection of a per barrel gasoline consumption tax and a per barrel tax on diesel a response to the alleged use of illicit fuel invoices by many of the teapots to evade the taxes
the teapots plight throws into sharp relief the performances of their state rivals including top refiners petrochina and sinopec where profits so far are running at their best in two or more years
state refiners have to pay the consumption tax as well but their massive local marketing networks and control of china s fuel exports help to offset the domestic market pressures
the teapots influence and size has grown significantly since they began winning crude import licences in
last year was a blockbuster as they churned out record earnings expanded into petrochemicals and beefed up trading teams
this year in contrast has been one of deepening trouble with several teapots shutting for maintenance to avoid losses
jincheng petrochemical co launched a month of maintenance in may at its bpd refinery after losing money on rising crude prices since late march said a marketing manager with the refinery declining to be named due to company policy
at an oil trade show late last month in dongying in shandong province home to many teapots sales managers from more than independents were jostling about trying to sell fuel to major trading firms state refiners and other teapots
several including wudi xinyue fuel and chemicals co and fuhai group plan to keep product inventories low fearing that domestic oversupply could further dampen fuel prices according to interviews with sales managers at the trade show
we barely keep any inventory for diesel and gasoline
there are more uncertainties in the market with more refineries coming online this year said an executive with a teapot in dongying
others like the haike group were retreating from the northeastern provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning where last year s strong sales were not repeating
haike is instead focusing on areas around shandong in the east an executive with the group said
state refiners have access to a surging export market and dominate china s retail fuel market making it easier for them to pass higher crude costs and tax burdens on to consumers
teapots however have to offer more competitive prices and their margins are much thinner
several independent refiners including shandong zhonghai fine chemical group guangrao kelida petrochemicals technology and chemchina s huaxing petrochemical said petrochina and sinopec were paying for products only at steep discounts to market values and were also reducing purchases
a manager at kelida a major supplier of asphalt to petrochina said his firm was now struggling to break even compared with a yuan a tonne profit last year
wholesale prices offered by petrochina are so cheap that we will be running at a loss the manager said declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media
zhonghai fine chemical with million tonnes a year in crude processing capacity said sinopec was ordering far less fuel than last year
sinopec has halted buying diesel from us this year
last year the volume was at least tonnes each month a manager said also declining to be named
teapot managers said they are urging the government to give them leeway in paying the consumption taxes
we urged the government to reconsider the tax policies
otherwise some of us are going to fail said a manager with chemchina huaxing refinery
sinopec declined to comment on its purchase plans and petrochina did not respond to inquiries
