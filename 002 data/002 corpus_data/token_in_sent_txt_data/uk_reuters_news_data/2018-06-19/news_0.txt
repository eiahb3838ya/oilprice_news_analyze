update 4-iran says no plans to increase missile range, rejects talks with trump
london reuters iran has no plans to extend the range of its missiles since their reach is enough to protect the country the revolutionary guards commander said on tuesday amid mounting pressure over tehran s missile programme
iran s government again ruled out negotiations with president donald trump over tehran s military capabilities and regional influence saying such talks would be against the values of the islamic republic
trump withdrew the united states last month from the accord between iran and world powers that curbed tehran s nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief
he said the deal was deeply flawed as it had not curbed iran s ballistic missile programme or reined in its support for proxies in conflicts in syria iraq and yemen and said washington would reimpose tough sanctions on tehran
we have the scientific ability to increase our missile range but it is not our current policy since most of the enemies strategic targets are already within this range
this range is enough to protect the islamic republic major general mohammad ali jafari was quoted as saying by tasnim news agency
jafari said on tuesday that previous negotiations with the united states about iran s nuclear programme were an exception and called iranian politicians and activists who have favoured fresh talks with trump traitors and
on saturday over activists associated with the moderate and reformist camps in iranian politics welcomed trump s deal with north korean leader kim jong un envisaging a complete denuclearisation of the korean peninsula
in a statement published by iranian media the activists urged tehran to start direct negotiations with washington with no preconditions to resolve decades of enmity between the two countries dating to iran s islamic revolution
jafari rejected their call
the north korean leader was a revolutionary but a communist not an islamic one
that is why he surrendered but we will not do the same he was quoted by the fars news agency as saying
iranian government spokesman mohammad bagher nobakht echoed jafari s remarks
there are no grounds or logic to talk to such a person trump
public opinion would not welcome that either nobakht was quoted as saying by isna news agency
since withdrawal from the deal european signatories france britain and germany have been scrambling to ensure iran retains enough economic benefits to persuade it not to pull out
iran s nuclear chief said on tuesday that europe s proposals to salvage the deal were not satisfying for tehran
irna reported that the head of iran s atomic energy organisation ali akbar salehi had met with united nations antonio guterres and made clear iran s dissatisfaction with european proposals to save the nuclear deal
referring to iran s regional role salehi was quoted as saying if it continues like this all sides will reporting by bozorgmehr sharafedin editing by mark heinrich toni reinhold
