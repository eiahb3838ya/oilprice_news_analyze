update 4-vw names interim audi boss, seeking to steady brand after ceo arrest
munich reuters volkswagen suspended audi boss rupert stadler and announced an interim replacement on tuesday seeking to steady its most profitable business after german authorities arrested stadler as part of an emissions probe
audi said stadler had requested to temporarily step down from his position and named sales executive abraham schot as an interim replacement with immediate effect confirming an earlier reuters story
stadler s arrest has thrown volkswagen vw back into turmoil almost three years after it admitted to using illegal software to cheat emissions tests on diesel engines
analysts said the arrest raised questions about whether europe s biggest carmaker had done enough to reform in the wake of the crisis and that it threatened a delicate truce among the group s powerful stakeholders who had previously clashed about whether stadler should remain in power
schot joined the vw group in after having worked as president and ceo of italia
he has been audi board member for sales and marketing since last september
munich prosecutors arrested stadler at his home in ingolstadt in the early hours of monday saying they saw a risk he could try to suppress evidence
prosecutors tapped his phone a person familiar with the investigation told reuters
he remains remanded in custody in augsburg but has not been charged with a crime
vw and audi said on monday that stadler was presumed innocent unless proven otherwise
last week munich prosecutors said they were investigating stadler for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the european market
vw has set aside around billion billion to cover the cost of fines vehicle refits and lawsuits arising from its dieselgate scandal and is spending billions more on electric vehicles to try to rebuild its reputation
vw has for years said only managers knew of the emissions cheating
however authorities filed criminal charges against former vw boss martin winterkorn earlier this year and german prosecutors continue to investigate
the technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests was first developed at audi
in designing the defeat device vw engineers borrowed the original concept of the emissions software from audi vw said in its plea agreement with authorities in january in which the company agreed to pay a billion fine to reach a settlement with regulators
stadler has been under fire from the media politicians and vw s powerful trade unions for his handling of the scandal but he survived a management reshuffle announced in august thanks to backing from the piech and porsche families that control vw
peter mosch deputy chairman on audi s supervisory board and head of its works council said labour representatives had backed a move to appoint schot as interim ceo to ensure that audi s business did not suffer from the leadership crisis
for the employees it is now important that the interim ceo returns the company to calmer waters drives the diesel investigation and brings it to a conclusion but mostly keeps the business in view he said in a statement
at gmt vw shares were down percent at euros extending monday s decline
