cities face dramatic rise in heat, flood risks by 2050, researchers say
cape town june thomson reuters foundation in just years cities around the world will face dramatically higher risks from extreme heat coastal flooding power blackouts and food and water shortages unless emissions are curbed urban researchers warned tuesday
today for instance over million people in cities face stifling heat where average daily peak temperatures hit degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit for three months of the year according to a study released by cities a network of major world cities pushing climate action
but by more than billion people in cities will face those conditions researchers predicted
the number of people who are both in poverty and battling brutal heat usually without air conditioning will rise tenfold they said
this is a call said kevin austin deputy executive director of cities at an international meeting in the south african city of cape town on adapting to climate change
the magnitude of people affected by heat will be much greater than today if we continue to increase greenhouse gases at this but cities can take action to directly curb the risks besides working to cut emissions he said
in seoul for example a major elevated thoroughfare through the center of the city has been removed opening up access to the river and lowering urban heat in the area by at least half a degree celsius he said
south korea s capital also has planted more than million trees and created shaded cooling centres for those without air conditioning
we want to encourage cities to adopt more of these solutions and implement them as quickly as possible
in the worst case scenario they will need to do them quickly austin said
the research carried out by the new urban climate change research network looked at data from more than cities and predicted likely conditions if emissions continue to rise at their current rate
it found that cape town s ongoing battle with water shortages could become far more common with over million people in cities among them sao paulo and tehran likely to see their access to water reduced by
many thirsty cities are already aiming to set caps on water use per person with los angeles pushing for litres a day melbourne for litres and cape town a dramatically reduced austin said
the geological survey estimates that an average american today uses at least litres of water per day
sharing advice on how to make cuts happen including insights gained in cape town which has slashed its water use by half in the face of extreme drought can save cities time and help them make changes faster austin said
but more cities need to transition in a planned way not in response to disaster he added
cape town mayor patricia de lille said dealing with a crisis when it arrives leaves little room to manoeuvre
in a crisis like this there is no time to go by trial and error
you unfortunately have to get it right the first time she said at the adaptation futures conference in cape town
the cities study also found that by over million people will live in coastal cities at risk of flooding from weather extremes and sea level rise
flooding presents a particular risk to urban power supplies with many power stations located in areas and everything from transportation to heating and hospitals at risk if power plants flood in cities from london to rio de janeiro the study noted
decentralising power systems including by getting clean energy from a larger number of smaller power plants could help cut the risks researchers said
but flooding risks may be coming faster than expected
patrick child the european commission s deputy for research and innovation said a predicted one metre rise in global sea level once anticipated by is now expected by
last year already saw the documented economic losses from severe weather and climate change globally he said
experts at the adaptation meeting also predicted that extreme weather could bring cascading problems for cities with flooding for instance triggering everything from disease outbreaks to road failures food shortages and closed schools
looking at just one type of problem such as a health threats from extreme heat or sea level rise isn t enough to capture the risks said cynthia rosenzweig a climatologist at the nasa goddard institute for space studies and one of the authors of the report
in cities all of these impacts interact with each other and are all happening at the same time she said
solutions also need combined approaches with engineering efforts to cut flooding for instance working hand in hand with things like better protection of wetlands rosenzweig said
she said she hoped the research would help city officials prioritise what changes need to happen first to better protect their citizens from climate threats
in cities it s often overwhelming with so many things to do she said
