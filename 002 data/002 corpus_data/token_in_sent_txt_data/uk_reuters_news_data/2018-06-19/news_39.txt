eu looks into extending import controls on chinese solar panels
brussels reuters the european commission is examining whether to extend measures to control imports of solar panels from china a move that could fuel tensions with beijing which had welcomed plans to phase them out in september
the commission is studying a request from at least one eu solar panel producer to open an expiry review according to eu sources familiar with the procedure
controls would remain in place for the duration of a review about a year and for longer if the commission found reason to prolong them
the commission should decide whether to conduct a review in august
the european union extended and measures for chinese solar panels wafers and cells by months in march signaling that they should then end
chinese solar panel makers are allowed to sell their products in europe free of duties if they do so at a minimum price that has progressively declined
if sold for less they are subject to a duty of up to percent
the european union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of eu manufacturers and those pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation
it has also been concerned about the response from beijing given the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in
eu prosun the grouping of eu producers that launched the initial complaint in said there were good reasons for measures to be prolonged
the minimum price was approaching the international market price as designed but the latter was a reflection of chinese overcapacity rather than the cost of production it said
beijing s own decision to limit installations meant chinese producers had some gigawatts of excess capacity to shift with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the united states and considered by india the second and third largest markets behind china
the total eu market is some gigawatts
solarpower europe which represents those in the solar industry opposed to duties said it did not see how a would really harm eu producers given the two largest were either closed or in liquidation despite the measures
the two sides dispute whether lower costs will spur installations
solarpower europe referred to commission and ey studies indicating demand could increase by up to percent creating about jobs if the measures were removed
eu prosun says lower prices over the last five years have not boosted demand which it says is determined by installation caps and rules set by individual countries
