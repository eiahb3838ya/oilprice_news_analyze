explainer-audi ceo crisis threatens fragile truce among vw stakeholders
frankfurt june reuters the arrest and detention of audi s chief executive forces volkswagen group s competing stakeholders to renegotiate the delicate balance of power that has helped keep rupert stadler in office
volkswagen s vw directors are discussing how to run audi its most profitable division following the arrest of the brand s boss on monday as part of germany s investigations into the carmaker s emissions cheating scandal
the discussions risk reigniting tensions among vw s controlling piech and porsche families its powerful labour representatives and its home region of lower saxony
vw has insisted the development of illegal software also known as defeat devices was the work of low level employees and that no management board members were involved
prosecutors have challenged this by indicting vw s former chief executive martin winterkorn
stadler s arrest raises further questions
audi and vw said on monday that stadler was presumed innocent unless proved otherwise
munich prosecutors detained stadler to prevent him from obstructing a probe into audi s emissions cheating they said on monday
stadler is being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising
here are the main players deciding the fate of audi
audi s role in dieselgate volkswagen group was plunged into crisis in after regulators found europe s biggest carmaker had equipped cars with software to cheat emissions tests on diesel engines
the technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests was first developed at audi
in designing the defeat device vw engineers borrowed the original concept of the emissions software from audi vw said in its plea agreement with authorities in january in which the company agreed to pay a billion fine to reach a settlement with regulators
audi engineers developed a liter diesel engine which was later also used in vw and porsche models sold in the united states between and
stadler has denied any involvement in cheating and audi even denied the existence of illegal engine management software after the environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation against audi on
audi eventually admitted to violations on according to vw s plea agreement with the department of justice from january
the deal revealed that audi employees were also involved in a cover up once regulators began asking questions
within vw ag and audi ag thousands of documents were deleted by approximately vw and audi ag employees vw s plea agreement revealed
in may stadler was awarded a contract extension until the end of but only because of a pact among supervisory board members that he would not serve out his full term two sources close to the company s supervisory board told reuters at the time
stadler has enjoyed backing from the porsche and piech families who control porsche se the family s holding company which has a percent stake in vw
stadler is close to the families because of his prior role at vw where he was chief of staff to ferdinand piech the former chairman and chief executive of vw
piech and his cousin wolfgang porsche who currently heads the family clan that controls vw are grandchildren of ferdinand porsche who developed the iconic vw beetle
stadler s continued presence at the helm of audi has been criticised by vw s labour representatives who have half the seats on the carmaker s supervisory board
under pressure to cut costs within the vw empire in the wake of more than billion in fines and penalties for emissions cheating labour leaders have called on stadler to cut costs at audi and take responsibility for his division s failings
audi is the most profitable division within the vw group which also owns the skoda bentley bugatti and porsche brands
the vw supervisory board or board of directors grants equal representation to workforce and shareholder representatives
but vw differs from other german companies in one respect lower saxony where vw is headquartered gets two of the shareholder seats tipping the balance of power
analysts say the representatives from lower saxony and the workforce share the common goal of protecting jobs at the region s biggest company which employs over people in the northwestern german state
clan the porsche and piech families controlling percent of the votes in vw through porsche se have the power to force change at vw but have largely kept silent over dieselgate
the ruling clan encompasses about people with diverse interests and careers ranging from design to real estate with patriarchs ferdinand piech and wolfgang porsche being slow to hand the wheel over to their children
the clan lost its dominant figure at vw in april when ferdinand piech who spearheaded its global expansion quit as chairman after more than two decades at vw s helm following a power struggle with then ceo martin winterkorn
with piech gone his cousin wolfgang porsche leads the family which now occupies four seats on the supervisory board
in qatar emerged as a vw stakeholder after it helped stabilise porsche automobil holding se s rocky finances in the wake of the company s failed takeover attempt of vw
a portfolio of derivatives on vw shares that porsche had accumulated was hastily sold to qatar which now owns a percent vw stake
frustrated with the pace of reform at vw qatar had asked the carmaker for a seat on the company s executive committee in a request that failed amid substantial opposition
qatar has two seats on the supervisory board of vw
