vattenfall, tennet eye dutch-british power link after 2023
london reuters a power cable connecting wind farms in the north sea to britain and the netherlands could be in place after if the plan secures approval a partner in the project said
swedish utility vattenfall and grid operator tennet agreed last week to conduct a feasibility study on the link called windconnector which vattenfall says could lower the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the shore
gunnar groebler vattenfall s senior vice president for wind business told reuters the study would be completed by the end of or early and the link could be in place after
he said the cable would help reduce the costs of wind power which now has to compete with smaller subsidies
he said the project makes the whole business case much more the new link could offer britain an additional source of renewable energy as it works to phase out coal power by
tennet and vattenfall will need to address regulatory issues such as how wind farms linked to the cable will be treated under subsidy schemes in their respective countries
obviously we have a tonne of regulatory questions on that
when a wind farm feeds to one country and another country how is that treated from support scheme perspective renewable balance said groebler
vattenfall has estimated that the cable would likely have to megawatts mw capacity but the partners have yet to confirm the final cable capacity and which wind farms it would link to
the cost also has to be determined groebler said
vattenfall wants to be involved in new wind farm projects in britain and the netherlands as well as germany denmark france and the nordic nations chief executive magnus hall told reuters on the sidelines of the firm s capital markets day
vattenfall already runs wind farms with total generation capacity of gigawatt gw in britain the netherlands denmark sweden and germany with a further gw under construction
