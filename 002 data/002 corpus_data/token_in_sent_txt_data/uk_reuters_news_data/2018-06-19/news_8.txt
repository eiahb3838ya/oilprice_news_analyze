update 3-iran rules out opec deal as russia, saudi push for oil output hike
reuters iran said on tuesday opec was unlikely to reach a deal on oil output this week setting the stage for a clash with saudi arabia and russia which are pushing to raise production steeply from july to meet growing global demand
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets on friday to set output policy amid calls from president donald trump and china to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude
opec s de facto leader saudi arabia and russia have proposed gradually relaxing production cuts in place since the start of while opec members iran iraq venezuela and algeria have opposed such a move
i don t believe at this meeting we can reach agreement
opec is not the organization to receive instruction from president trump opec is not part of the department of energy of the united states iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh told reporters after arriving in vienna where opec is headquartered
zanganeh said he would leave vienna on friday before opec holds talks with producers the next day and added a recent rise in oil prices was mainly the fault of washington which imposed new sanctions on opec members iran and venezuela
trump has called on opec to raise output and saudi arabia and russia said in recent weeks the world needed more oil
oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter we could face a deficit if we don t take measures russian energy minister alexander novak said on tuesday
in our view this could lead to market novak said russia wanted opec and to raise output by million barrels per day bpd effectively wiping out existing production cuts of million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil prices to per barrel from as low as in
in addition to iran opec members iraq venezuela and algeria said they opposed a production increase despite supply outages in countries such as libya and venezuela
demand growth has surprised market watchers on the upside in the past two years with annual increases exceeding percent
global oil consumption is expected to hit million bpd next year
novak said that if a decision were taken this week to raise output opec and its allies could meet again in september to review the impact and production policy
iraq and iran have said they would oppose output increases on the grounds that such moves would breach previous agreements to maintain cuts until the
both countries would struggle to increase output
iran faces renewed sanctions that will impact its oil industry and iraq has production constraints
two opec sources told reuters that even saudi arabia s gulf allies kuwait and oman were against big immediate increases in output
one opec source said the proposal of a increase was just a tactic aimed at persuading fellow members to compromise on a smaller rise of around million bpd
saudi arabia and its gulf allies have the capacity to raise output
russia has also said that limiting supply for too long could encourage unacceptably high output growth from the united states which is not part of the production agreement
on tuesday the head of russia s oil firm lukoil vagit alekperov said global production cuts should be halved and that lukoil could restore its oil output levels within two to three months
commerzbank commodities analyst carsten fritsch said that given big differences in the positions of opec members the friday meeting was likely to be tough
unanimity is needed for any opec decision
this recalls the june meeting when opec was unable to agree on an increase in production to compensate for the outages in libya fritsch said
that meeting ended without any joint declaration
the then saudi oil minister ali described it as the worst opec meeting of all adding to the tensions iran and venezuela continued to insist that opec on friday debate sanctions against the two countries but the organization s secretariat has rejected their requests according to letters seen by reuters
