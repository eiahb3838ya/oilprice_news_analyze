update 1-e.on to raise british dual fuel energy prices by 4.8 pct
london reuters will raise prices for british customers taking both gas and electricity by percent from the german utility said on tuesday the last of the big six energy suppliers to increase its tariffs
the move follows similar increases announced this year by the other five big suppliers in the country and comes as regulator ofgem is working to set a cap on standard prices by the end of the year
the british government has asked ofgem to put the price cap on to combat what it has called rip off energy prices
utilities have denied overcharging but the competition and markets authority found they had overcharged some british households a total of billion pounds a year on average from to prompting the government to act
said the increase was needed due to the significant rise in the cost of wholesale energy and in common with similar pressures faced by a number of other suppliers of all sizes across the industry over recent it said wholesale energy costs have increased more than percent since march largely due to the impact of extremely cold temperatures earlier this year depleting european gas storage
said the latest rise equated to an average extra cost of pounds per year per customer and it had not increased its standard gas and electricity unit prices since april
however earlier this year it changed the way it structured bills including scrapping discounts for people who take both gas and electricity from the company and for those who opt for paperless billing which added around pounds per year to average bills
