refile-update 6-head of vw's audi arrested in germany over diesel scandal
this june story has been refiled to add dropped word boards in paragraph one
by edward taylor and jan schwartz frankfurt reuters volkswagen s supervisory boards suspended crisis talks to find a boss for its audi brand which were convened after german authorities arrested current audi chief executive rupert stadler as part of a probe into emissions test cheating
stadler s arrest on monday threw volkswagen vw into turmoil as it struggles to recover from cheating revelations which emerged after regulators blew the whistle in september on the carmaker s use of illegal software
the directors of audi and volkswagen discussed how to run its more profitable division without stadler but failed to come to a conclusion the carmaker said late on monday
the supervisory boards of vw and audi have not yet reached a decision and continue to assess the situation a spokesman for vw said
the arrest has kicked off a new debate over vw s governance which could raise tensions on its supervisory board putting at risk a fragile truce between management vw s controlling piech and porsche families as well as representatives from labour and the region of lower saxony
vw has for years said only managers knew of the emissions cheating but authorities filed criminal charges against former vw boss martin winterkorn earlier this year and munich prosecutors widened their probe into audi this month
munich prosecutors said stadler was being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and for his alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the european market
following his arrest munich prosecutors said stadler the most senior active vw official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation
we need to find a solution for audi s leadership for the time when he is not here the source familiar with the talks said about stadler s position
we will comment on this stadler was given additional responsibilities for group sales in a revamp announced by vw s new chief executive herbert diess in april
on monday vw and audi directors were discussing the leadership crisis in separate meetings with one source saying dutchman bram schot was the front runner to become interim audi chief
germany s sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper said vw s supervisory board had already picked schot for the job and only needed the formal approval of audi s directors
vw denied any such appointment had been made
vw has set aside around billion to cover fines vehicle refits and lawsuits since its dieselgate scandal broke and has announced plans to spend billions more on a shift to electric vehicles as it seeks to rebuild its reputation
whereas group ceo martin winterkorn resigned in the days after the cheating was disclosed stadler resisted requests to fall on his sword and instead received backing from the porsche and piech families to remain in his post
his arrest is another low point in vw s diesel saga said evercore isi analysts who have criticised the group for a slow pace of reform
almost three years after the diesel scandal broke it takes police to take action against the audi the united states filed criminal charges against winterkorn in may but he is unlikely to face authorities because germany does not extradite its nationals to countries outside the european union
the munich prosecutors said the move against stadler was not made at the behest of authorities
the was arrested at his home in ingolstadt in the early hours on monday they said
the arrest warrant was made because of a risk that evidence might be suppressed stephan necknig a spokesman for the munich prosecutor s office told reuters television
during a search last week there were signs that the accused may tamper with evidence
to influence other suspects or witnesses or people who could provide information to the investigating authorities he added
sueddeutsche zeitung citing sources close to the investigation said prosecutors had tapped stadler s phone just before searching his premises last week
audi and vw said stadler was presumed innocent unless proved otherwise
stadler himself was not immediately available for comment
vw shares closed down percent at euros one of the biggest falls by a european stock
asked whether authorities were also seeking to arrest stadler a spokesman for the department of justice said as a general matter the department will neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing stadler has been under fire since audi admitted in november two months after parent vw that it also installed illegal defeat device software to cheat emissions tests
munich prosecutors are investigating whether stadler acted swiftly enough to stop deliveries of manipulated audi models in europe once emissions problems had emerged a person familiar with the matter has told reuters
stadler has held onto his post mainly thanks to the backing of members of vw s controlling families
before becoming audi ceo in stadler worked as chief of staff to vw s former chairman and industry scion ferdinand piech
earlier this month munich prosecutors widened their probe at audi to include stadler and another member of audi s top management investigating them for suspected fraud and false advertising
most of vw s emissions problems have been in the united states where a total of nine people have been charged and two former vw executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms
but investigations are continuing elsewhere
last week german prosecutors fined vw billion euros million pounds over the scandal
