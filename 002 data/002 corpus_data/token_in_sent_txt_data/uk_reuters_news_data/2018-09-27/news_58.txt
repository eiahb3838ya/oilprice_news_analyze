u.s. stresses safety in talks on nuclear power with saudi arabia -perry
washington reuters the united states is close to working with saudi arabia on building nuclear power reactors but talks on tough standards with the kingdom remain a challenge energy secretary rick perry said on wednesday
perry has held talks with several saudi leaders this year including king salman and crown prince mohammed bin salman on the kingdom s ambition of initially building two nuclear power stations
saudi arabia wants to ultimately construct reactors in coming decades at a cost of about billion billion pounds
discussions had been held up on saudi arabia s desire to relax nonproliferation standards and potentially allow the country to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium technologies that advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons
perry said progress on standards had been made but that talks were not going as quickly as either side would have hoped
perry has shared with saudi leaders that being perceived as very very strong on was a most important message globally he told reporters at the energy department headquarters
perry said part of the talks centre on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive for sensitive areas in the kingdom
in july south korea said its utility kepco along with the united states france china and russia had been shortlisted to bid for a nuclear power project in saudi arabia and that the winner would likely be selected in
washington hopes saudi arabia will buy nuclear power technology from companies including westinghouse which recently emerged from chapter bankruptcy and abandoned plans to build two advanced reactors in the united states
if saudi arabia signs a deal that relaxes the safeguards the united arab emirates could be free to break a deal it signed with washington years ago and enrich uranium
the uae deal contained the gold standard in such nuclear agreements because it contained safeguards against enriching and preprocessing
westinghouse said it would defer to the customer saudi arabia for comment
the saudi embassy in washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment
