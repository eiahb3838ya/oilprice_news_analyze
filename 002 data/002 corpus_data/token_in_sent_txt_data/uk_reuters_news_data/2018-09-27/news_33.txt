eu energy watchdog urges bosnian lawmakers not to back chinese energy loan
sarajevo sept reuters the eu energy watchdog urged a bosnian regional parliament on thursday not to approve a government guarantee for a china exim bank loan that is designed to help power utility epbih add a new unit at its tuzla power plant
the guarantee covers percent of the total value of the contract signed last november for the largest investment in bosnia s postwar energy infrastructure
epbih s shareholders gave it the this month but it must still be approved by the parliament of the autonomous federation
the energy community an international body established by the eu and eight aspiring member states to extend the bloc s energy policy to members said the guarantee may constitute illegal state aid and that the vote should be put on hold until the case has been properly investigated
such approval could lead to lengthy and costly recovery procedures
besides the energy community secretariat may have to open infringement procedures against bosnia and herzegovina its head janez kopac said in a letter to lawmakers made available to reuters
the move follows a complaint from environmentalist groups opposed to the project
they accused the government of the federation of trying to rush the deal through the parliament before national and regional elections in bosnia on
they argued that under the energy community treaty bosnia must follow eu rules on subsidies in the energy sector
among other things in most cases state guarantees may only cover a maximum percent of the total loan amount they said in the complaint
the balkans are increasingly turning to china for funding as the european union the world bank and other institutions cut back on financing projects
china gezhouba group and guandong electric power were picked to build the megawatt mw unit in the city of tuzla at a cost of billion bosnian marka billion to replace three outdated units at the mw plant
chinese firms are implementing a series of projects in the balkans mainly in the energy sector and worth around billion euros in bosnia alone
environmentalists object to the coal projects planned with china saying they do not meet eu rules and could add to already high levels of air pollution while also exposing bosnia to costly plant upgrades once it joins the eu
