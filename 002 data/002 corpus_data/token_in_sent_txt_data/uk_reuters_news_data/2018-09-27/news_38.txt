croatia extends bidding deadline again for adriatic lng terminal
zagreb sept reuters croatia has again extended a deadline for submitting binding bids for the use of a planned floating liquefied natural gas lng terminal in the northern adriatic
the deadline has been moved from to this year lng croatia said in a statement on its website on thursday
the decision was taken after a request from potential bidders it added
the first time the deadline was extended in early august was for the same reason
the terminal on the northern adriatic island of krk is planned as part of the european union s efforts to diversify from russian energy imports
the targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern europe
the value of the terminal is seen at million euros million with the european union financing just over million euros
the capacity of the terminal which has a tentative date for operation from early will eventually depend on demand
local media reported earlier this year that initial demand for the terminal had been rather low causing a delay in the final investment decision originally planned for last june
lng croatia refused to comment on the bidding procedure
