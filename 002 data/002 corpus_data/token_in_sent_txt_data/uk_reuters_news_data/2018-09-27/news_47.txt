british car output falls 13 percent in august
london reuters british car production fell by an annual percent in august the third consecutive drop in a row due to model changeovers and preparations for new tougher emissions rules a car industry body said on thursday
output stood at units last month driven down by a nearly percent drop in production for domestic buyers compared with a percent fall in exports according to the society of motor manufacturers and traders
the quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and shutdowns said chief executive mike hawes
this instability was exacerbated in august with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on september the tougher new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp became mandatory from the start of september forcing certain carmakers to halt deliveries and change plans regarding some models that had yet to have for emissions
the car industry is also concerned that any loss of free and unfettered trade after britain s exit from the european union next year could hit sales and output especially if politicians fail to strike an agreement
with exports the majority to the eu continuing to drive demand it underscores the importance of a brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector no deal is not an option said hawes
