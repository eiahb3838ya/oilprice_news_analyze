update 2-pemex plans up to 100,000 bpd light crude imports, says ceo
adds pemex ceo comments background tweaks headline by david alire garcia and marianna parraga acapulco sept reuters mexican oil company pemex expects to begin importing up to barrels per day of light crude oil likely from the united states from late october and at least until the end of november its chief executive said on wednesday
a hundred thousand barrels per day more or less is what we re going to import to process and incorporate into our refineries mostly at salina cruz pemex ceo carlos trevino said in an interview with reuters on the sidelines of the mexican petroleum congress in acapulco
the imports planned to run through at least the end of president enrique pena nieto s tenure in office on mark a stark shift for historically major crude exporter mexico where decades of oil are a badge of pride
years of under investment and declining crude output have severely hampered mexico s refineries and helped necessitate the move
salina cruz like pemex s other five refineries has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems as well as pemex s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically
we re going to mix it with mexican crude with some of our mix to be able to process at the levels we want to get back to in refining
we should be around barrels per day of refining in the country s entire system by the end of the year he added
mexico s refining network can process up to million bpd of crude
it has been working this year at around percent
trevino said he expects auctions of oil exploration and production blocks scheduled for february which include the selection of key partners for pemex will take place as planned
i think there is total certainty that mexico s oil regulator the national hydrocarbons commission cnh will carry out the auctions
mexican andres manuel lopez obrador has said that oil auctions are suspended until contracts already awarded over the past few years have been reviewed but he has not specifically weighed in on the february tenders
pemex whose oil production and refining volumes have continued declining this year amid the depletion of some of its main oilfields will not meet its crude output target of million barrels per day in
we re going to be considerably below that trevino told reporters at the conference later in the evening declining to provide a specific volume
he expects another year of production decline in even though pemex had originally planned to stabilize output by then
lopez obrador who takes office on handily won mexico s presidential election in part by promising sweeping changes to mexico s energy industry
his energy team has signaled they want pemex to select its own partners instead of having them chosen in auctions run by the cnh
trevino said the new process would be easier underscoring that the current selection process costs us writing by anthony esposito editing by jonathan oatis and richard pullin
