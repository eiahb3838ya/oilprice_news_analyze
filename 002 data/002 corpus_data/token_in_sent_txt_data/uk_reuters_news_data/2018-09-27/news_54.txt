china scraps blanket winter output cuts for heavy industry
beijing sept reuters china has ditched blanket production cuts on heavy industry in its finalised winter plan allowing local authorities to adopt measures based on regional emission levels
the plan issued by the ministry of environment and ecology mee on thursday is the latest sign of beijing its policy in a fight against smog
earlier this month reuters reported that china was considering such a move for its northern provinces
before the revision in an earlier draft of its winter campaign the mee had still been planning blanket production cuts of percent on heavy industry in northern cities
local authorities should carry out production cuts based on their individual situation and refrain from adopting blanket cuts the mee said however in the finalised plan
local governments can also shorten or extend the timeframe of production restrictions based on their monthly air quality the ministry said
production cuts for last winter started from and lasted until of this year
heavy industry including steelmaking cement factories coke plants metal casting and chemical production will be the main targets of any restrictions but output cuts for individual companies will be based on their emissions record
steel mills with blast furnaces coke plants and primary aluminium and alumina producers able to meet emission standards will be exempt from winter output cuts
steelmakers that use furnaces and that only use scrap steel as raw material will also be pardoned from output limits
provincial authorities will be given until to submit their own production cutting plans to the central government
no changes will be allowed afterwards the mee said
the ministry also said it will continue its project by replacing systems with gas or electrical systems in an additional million households in northern chinese cities
last year china converted the heating systems in million households in the same cities
the mee aims over the coming winter to reduce average concentration by around percent from levels recorded in the same period last year
the reduction target has been revised lowered from percent in the earlier draft
