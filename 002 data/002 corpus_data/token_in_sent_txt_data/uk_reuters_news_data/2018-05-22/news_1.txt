update 2-brazil truckers pledge more fuel protests despite tax proposal
truckers not convinced by proposed cide tax cut protests affect ports threaten soy meat deliveries petrobras cuts diesel prices shares fall finance minister petrobras ceo deny interference recasts with proposal to cut fuel tax truckers reaction by ana mano and alberto alerigi sao paulo may reuters brazilian truck drivers on tuesday vowed to extend their protest against high fuel prices into a third day despite a government compromise to cut a fuel tax threatening to slow economic activity and interrupt exports of grains and other goods
thousands of trucks were parked to obstruct major roads as the protests interrupted traffic along a major soy shipping route in the grains state of mato grosso and impeded access to the country s two main export ports santos and paranaguá
brazil is a key global supplier of grains meat coffee and sugar most of which reach ports by road
soy futures rose in chicago on tuesday for a second straight day as the protests threatened to halt shipments of brazil s record soybean harvest
in an effort to address truckers demands congressional leaders floated a plan on tuesday afternoon to eliminate the cide fuel tax and put additional revenue from payroll taxes toward reducing fuel prices which have surged nearly percent in less than a year
diesel prices ended last week at reais per liter according to regulator anp
however the trucking group organizing the protests abcam said demonstrations would continue on wednesday complaining that the cide accounted for only a fraction of the taxes on diesel fuel
according to petrobras state and federal taxes make up percent of the final price paid by the consumer
that doesn t solve the problem
we want to be heard
we want diesel taxes to be eliminated abcam president josé da fonseca lopes told reuters
his comments added to pressure on the government to provide relief from fuel costs giving it the choice of backsliding on efforts to close brazil s fiscal deficit or interfering in the oil company s pricing policy
a small diesel price cut announced on tuesday by petroleo brasileiro sa or petrobras did nothing to reduce protests
but it did raise concerns about interference in a program of adjustments to track global markets since last july
that new pricing policy which has allowed the company to sell fuel at a profit after absorbing losses for years has been key to the operational turnaround at petrobras lifting its share price to an high this month
petrobras chief executive pedro parente and finance minister eduardo guardia both denied that the government had asked the company to change its pricing policy on tuesday
petrobras shares fell as much as percent on concerns of political interference but pared losses to percent on news of the proposal to lower pump prices through tax policy

pork and poultry processor group abpa said the protests are affecting transportation of feed and animals adding that blockades had stopped work at eight plants on tuesday and more would stop on wednesday
aurora brazil s chicken and pork producer said it would halt work at fifteen plants in four states on thursday and friday due to the lack of storage space or transportation options
