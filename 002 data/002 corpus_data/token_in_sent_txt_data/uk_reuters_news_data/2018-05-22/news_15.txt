indian oil to turn to traditional suppliers to meet iran oil shortfall
mumbai may reuters indian oil corp ioc the country s top refiner will turn to its traditional oil suppliers mostly in the middle east if sanctions against iran result in supply disruptions its head of finance said
president donald trump earlier this month pulled out of a international nuclear pact with iran and said he would impose sanctions on tehran and companies that continue to work with it unless it curbed its influence in the middle east
other signatories of the pact france germany britain russia and china said they would try to salvage the deal and keep iran s oil trade and investment flowing
so far we haven t cut any volumes from iran
we have to see how strongly the takes up sanctions
from our side we would like to continue
otherwise we will look to our traditional suppliers
sharma said
ioc which controls million barrels per day bpd of refining capacity or about a third of the country s overall capacity plans to buy bpd of iranian oil in and has an option to buy an additional bpd
state refiners such as ioc have raised imports after iran agreed to steep shipping discounts
iran s high sulphur oil can be replaced with other crudes
it is just a case of economics
replacing will mean slightly cost disadvantage sharma added
ioc chairman sanjiv singh said the government had so far not directed refiners to cut imports from iran
we have to see how situation unfolds in future he said
previously india obtained a waiver from western sanctions as the country had cut imports from the islamic republic
we are working on a strategy
we are working on alternate plans if those volumes go down then how do we manage the situation singh said
ioc is iran s biggest indian oil client
the company meets about percent of its oil needs through annual contracts deals mainly with middle eastern producers
it makes sense for ioc to look for alternatives to iranian oil from other parts of the middle east due to geographical proximity and similarities in the oil produced
however an ioc official said separately the company could also tap the spot market to buy oil
there is an option to buy oil like mars but we will do that if arbitrage is favorable the official said
ioc recently bought million barrels of oil via a tender
