shell's oil spill dispute with nigeria's bodo villagers back in uk court
london reuters lawyers for the bodo community in nigeria s niger delta which was devastated by two major oil spills a decade ago went to court in london on tuesday to fend off what they said was an attempt by shell to kill off their litigation
the bodo oil spills have been the subject of years of legal wrangling
in shell accepted liability for the spills agreeing to pay million pounds million at the time to bodo villagers and to clean up their lands and waterways
oil spills sometimes due to vandalism sometimes to corrosion are common in the niger delta a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps by pipelines and blighted by poverty pollution corruption and violence
the spills have had a catastrophic impact on many communities where people have no other water supply than the creeks and rely on farming and fishing for survival
at the same time oil companies have run into problems trying to clean up spills sometimes because of obstruction and even violence by local gangs trying to extract bigger payouts or to obtain contracts
after years of delays the in bodo is currently underway and litigation in the london high court is stayed or on hold
lawyers for spdc the nigerian arm of shell argued on tuesday that the litigation should be struck off in october or at the latest a year later and that it should only be if spdc failed to comply with its obligation to pay for the
lawyers for the bodo community said that was unacceptable because the could go wrong for any number of reasons and that under shell s proposal the villagers would be left without the recourse of going back to court
the effect of what shell is trying to do is to kill off the case said dan leader the bodo community s lead lawyer on the sidelines of the hearing
it s only because of the pressure of litigation that the is getting back on but shell s lawyers citing an earlier judgment compared the stayed litigation to a gun in the cupboard that the bodo community s lawyers wanted to be able to hold to shell s head at their convenience for years on end
they said the litigation was a hindrance to the because it gave some local community members the impression that there was still the possibility of a bigger payout incentivising them to block the rather than cooperate
the previous persistent delays to the process clearly demonstrate that litigating nigerian oil spill cases in the english courts does little to resolve the complex underlying security and community issues which can frustrate attempts to clean up areas impacted by oil pollution an spdc spokeswoman said
we hope that the community will continue to grant the access needed for to progress as a judgment on the litigation issues is expected on friday
