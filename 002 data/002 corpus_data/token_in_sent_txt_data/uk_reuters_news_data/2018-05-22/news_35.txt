indian fishermen hail u.s. supreme court decision to hear world bank suit
bangkok may thomson reuters foundation farmers and fishermen in western india have welcomed a supreme court decision to hear their lawsuit against a world bank agency which financed a power plant they blame for damaging the environment and their livelihoods
the supreme court on monday agreed to hear an appeal by the villagers of a lower court ruling that the international finance corp ifc was immune from such lawsuits under federal law
the court must now consider for the first time whether international organisations are immune from such suits under federal law according to the advocacy group earthrights international eri which is representing the plaintiffs
this is a big victory for us said bharat patel a plaintiff and general secretary of the fishermen s group machimar adhikar sangharsh sangatha
we fought for so many years to be heard
this decision gives us hope he told the thomson reuters foundation
the case revolves around the ifc s decision in to provide million in loans for a plant operated by a tata power unit near mundra in gujarat state
loans from the ifc include provisions requiring that certain environmental standards will be met
but the megawatt plant billed as key to providing cheap energy and creating jobs has had a devastating and irreversible impact on the coastal ecosystem according to the submission by villagers who live near the plant
coal ash damages crops water for drinking and irrigation have been contaminated while discharges from the plant s cooling system have reduced fish stocks they said
lead plaintiff budha ismail jam and others sued in federal court in washington in saying the ifc had failed to meet its obligations
representatives for tata power and the world bank in india did not respond to seeking comment
a district court in and the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the ifc is immune from such litigation under a law
the question before the supreme court now is whether there are limits to immunity for entities like the ifc under the international organizations immunity act
that law gives international organisations the same immunity from suit as is enjoyed by foreign governments
however governments are not entitled to immunity from suits arising out of their commercial activities under the foreign sovereign immunities act according to eri
since a foreign government would not be immune from this suit the ifc which is made up of foreign states should not be immune either it said
the court will hear arguments and decide the case in its next term which begins in october
