feature-costa rica coffee farmers brew up a carbon neutral future
santa maria de dota costa rica may thomson reuters foundation c limbing the steep slope by his house fernando solis arguedas examined a leaf on one of his trees that produces arabica beans for the world s first officially certified carbon neutral coffee
blaming an increasingly unpredictable climate for the first spots of roya fungus he explained how sustainable techniques such as reducing chemical sprays and planting more shade trees meant higher prices for his coffee cooperative coopedota
but forget organic
carbon neutral produce has become the buzz term in the central american nation of million people as countries look to slash greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while feeding growing populations
it s the trend but it means we can put our coffee in the international market and if the market is at we might get or said solis the third generation of his family to farm coffee
although in reality a lot goes in costs we think we come out better he said watching the hawks drifting on currents of warm air over the town of santa maria de dota some km miles south of the capital san jose
costa rica is now home to three zero emission coffee companies plus some carbon neutral banana pineapple and cattle producers putting the nation at the forefront of a movement that is slowly growing
coffee is not the only drink going carbon neutral
companies in sri lanka india and china are producing zero emission tea
coffee production has played a major role in costa rica s history and it is famed for its arabica varieties
it is the world s largest coffee producer although it only accounts for about one percent of the world s coffee
but with a reputation for being environmentally friendly costa rica set itself an ambitious and increasingly improbable target in to become carbon neutral by which means tackling the percent of its emissions coming from farming
coffee makes up nearly percent of its total emissions
globally agriculture forestry and other land use accounts for about percent of greenhouse gas emissions according to the environmental protection agency
persuading costa rica s coffee farmers to switch fertilisers or mills to cut energy and water consumption or turn pulp into biogas is helping lower costs alongside their environmental footprint said people in the coffee industry
many are keen to adapt as the changing climate clouds the future for producers prompting the government recently to lift a ban on planting robusta trees that are more heat and disease resistant than arabica
but getting consumers on board remains a major challenge as producing zero emission coffee comes with costs
inside the vast coopedota facility in santa maria de dota where most livelihoods are tied to coffee millions of beans are sorted into sacks as the smell of roasting coffee pervades
in the quality control room a pair of tasters tested dozens of cups of coffee comparing the fragrance and notes from the brews before spitting the remainder into steel beakers
although it is now ranked as the world s first carbon neutral coffee company the cooperative originally set out to cut costs and increase efficiency but along the way realised the environmental benefits of the new processes
now with water consumption down percent and energy use percent lower it uses coffee husks instead of firewood to dry beans in cylinders said environmental manager adrian cordero
coopedota tracks the emissions produced at each stage from planting and fertilising the seeds taking the coffee cherries from the farm to be depulped the beans dried and in some cases roasted buying carbon credits to offset part of its impact
cordero said the cooperative exports about half its coffee to the united states and the rest to newer markets in asia where people are willing to pay the higher price
the social angle the environmental angle ensures our prices don t go down he told the thomson reuters foundation
cordero acknowledged that becoming carbon neutral was a slow process and required hefty initial investments for coopedota
the cooperative secures contracts several years in advance which is security for farmers change the way or crops they farm
however facing stiff competition from bigger coffee producers such as brazil low or zero emission coffee gives costa rica an edge said carlos fonseca castro technical manager at the country s icafe coffee institute
costa rica was the first to adopt a nationally appropriated mitigation action nama plan to help coffee producers cut emissions
it now has a plan in place for cattle
while only three coffee companies are certified carbon neutral more are working to slash emissions seeing cost benefits said fonseca at icafe on san jose s outskirts
it s not necessarily expensive but it s a change of mentality around coffee production and processing he said
however he said difficulties in accurately measuring how carbon is stored and the need to buy credits was a disincentive
roberto azofeifa head of the ministry of agriculture s production programme said training and loans were helping farmers speed up to reduce environmental impact
but raising consumer awareness and finding niche markets for carbon neutral products remained a hurdle
the carbon neutral target is inspiring people to do interesting things and even if they don t have certification they re doing important work such as reducing emissions through waste reuse said azofeifa in his san jose office
how to convince the consumer to be part of this trend is an enormous sri lanka s bogawantalawa tea estates which became carbon neutral this year is confident buyers will catch on to carbon neutral as they did with organic products
when we mention it s carbon neutral they are very much interested because they also are able to mention this on their packs said shivashankary rajarammohan head of corporate social responsibility
eventually companies may have to show their carbon footprint as they do with nutritional values said peter laderach climate specialist at the international center for tropical agriculture
it the same as food safety and traceability
consumers get more informed and they just want to know they buying the right thing he said
