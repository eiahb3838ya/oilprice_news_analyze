u.s. sanctions will push gazprom ceo into shadows - analysts
moscow april reuters alexei miller head of russian gas giant gazprom will have to lower his public profile and delegate to someone else his powers to clinch deals and raise financing now that he has been added to a sanctions blacklist analysts said
washington last week imposed sanctions against several russian businessmen companies and government officials striking at associates of president vladimir putin to punish moscow for a range of activities including alleged meddling in the election
while gazprom was not affected miller himself was added to the nationals list which bars individuals and entities from having any dealings with him
firms outside jurisdiction can be punished if washington deems they are helping a sanctioned entity
it is possible that to soothe the worries of the european partners miller will have to delegate his powers to an attorney fitch ratings analyst dmitry marinchenko said
gazprom did not respond to a request for comment
miller said last week he was proud to be included on the sanctions list
gazprom has no direct with firms but it has a web of commercial relationships in europe where it supplies around a third of the bloc s natural gas needs
uniper shell engie omv and wintershall are among gazprom s key european partners
technically speaking unlike for persons foreign persons from the eu can meet and negotiate with mr miller short of signing anything material for their companies and gazprom george voloshin from aperio intelligence consultancy in paris said
but since we are walking a very fine line here in terms of jurisprudence they will most likely prefer the safest option excluding mr miller from all dealings he said
miller worked with president putin in the st petersburg city administration in the early when putin was an advisor to the mayor
miller has been at the helm of gazprom since
gazprom s annual investments are almost trillion roubles billion while its international borrowings total around trillion roubles the largest among all russian companies
according to fitch in gazprom will have to redeem billion of debt
