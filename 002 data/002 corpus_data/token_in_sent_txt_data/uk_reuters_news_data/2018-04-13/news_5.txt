brazil vessel lineup for sugar 60 pct below same period last year
sao paulo april reuters the lineup of vessels to load sugar in brazil currently is around percent smaller than seen in the same period a year earlier because of lower output and tepid foreign demand midway through the first month of the country s new cane crop
ten vessels were at brazilian ports in the first week of april to load tonnes of sugar according to data from shipping agency williams
at this time last year ships were at port to take on tonnes
the main reason for that is the smaller production in brazil said julio maria borges a sugar analyst at consultancy job economia e planejamento
we are going to see lineups smaller than last year during the brazilian mills have been producing much more ethanol as this year s cane crop begins than seen last year as the fuel is currently more profitable than sugar and demand for ethanol in brazil is strong
at the same time borges says mills are avoiding closing large export deals as international sugar prices remain low
brazil the world s largest producer and exporter of sugar is finding increasing competition abroad as europe thailand and india boost output
michael mcdougall vice president at ed f man capital markets in new york says china s tariff increase on sugar instituted last year is also hurting brazil volumes
brazil s cane industry group unica said exports to china which in the past would amount to around million tonnes per year reached only tonnes last season because of the restriction
china in may last year started to charge a percent duty on top of percent tariff it already had in place for sugar imports beyond a quota of million tonnes that applies to many countries including brazil
an increase in white sugar production in europe also weighed on premiums for that category compared with raw sugar leading to lower demand from refiners for raw product the experts said
