iea says "mission accomplished" for opec as oil stocks shrink
iea says stocks could reach average by may opec still planning to extend supply cuts into iea says stocks could fall sharply if cuts maintained by dmitry zhdannikov london april reuters opec and its allies appear to have accomplished their mission of bringing global oil stocks to desired levels the international energy agency said on friday signalling that the markets could become too tight if supply remains restrained
the iea which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised nations said global stocks in developed countries could fall to their average a metric used by opec to measure the success of output cuts as early as may
it is not for us to declare on behalf of the vienna agreement countries that it is mission accomplished but if our outlook is accurate it certainly looks very much like it the iea said in its monthly report
opec has reduced production in tandem with russia and other allies since january to prop up global oil prices which soared above per barrel this month giving a new boost to booming shale oil output
but as oil production collapsed in opec member venezuela and still faces hiccups in countries such as libya and angola the oil exporter group is producing below its targets meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand
on thursday the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in its monthly report that oil stocks in the developed world were only million barrels above the latest average
the iea put the figure at just million barrels as of the end of february
the iea said that even though output was set to soar by million barrels per day this year on higher production it was not enough to meet global demand expected to rise by million bpd or around percent
with production declines in venezuela and africa opec was producing million bpd in march below the call on its crude for the rest of the year at million bpd
our balances show that if opec production were constant this year and if our outlooks for production and oil demand remain unchanged in global stocks could draw by about million bpd the iea said
the figure would represent percent of global supply or around half of opec s current production cuts of nearly million bpd
the pact runs until the end of the year and opec meets in june to decide its next course of action
opec s de facto leader saudi arabia has said it would like the pact to be extended into
opec mohammad barkindo told reuters on thursday opec and its allies were poised to extend the pact into even as a global glut of crude was set to evaporate by september
