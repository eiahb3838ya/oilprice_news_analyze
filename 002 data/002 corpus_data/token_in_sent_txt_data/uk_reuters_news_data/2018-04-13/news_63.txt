don't rule out diesel car refits, german environment minister warns
berlin reuters the german government should not rule out requiring retrofits of diesel cars environment minister svenja schulze said underscoring differences among the parties in chancellor angela merkel s governing coalition
schulze a social democrat spd said transport minister andreas scheuer a member of the csu bavarian conservatives was too optimistic when he said germany could meet emissions targets without imposing driving bans and requiring carmakers to modify the exhaust systems of existing diesel cars
disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide nox emissions known to cause respiratory disease threaten to further strain already difficult relations between merkel s conservatives and the spd
merkel on wednesday had played down the possibility of forcing carmakers to make expensive modifications to diesel car exhaust systems as her new government tries to avoid driving bans in cities with air quality problems
the german car industry which accounts for some jobs in europe s biggest economy is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after volkswagen admitted in that it had cheated exhaust tests
schulze told the passauer neue presse newspaper it would would be nice if german cities could meet nox targets without retrofits
but i don t share this optimism when it comes to big cites like munich stuttgart and several others schulze said in an interview published on friday
she said an expert commission set up by the transport ministry to examine the feasibility of retrofits should complete its work quickly and then implement what is technically possible and economically schulze joined scheuer in rejecting government funding for possible retrofits adding it can not be that taxpayers should have to pay for what the automakers screwed merkel told reporters on wednesday she would do everything possible to avoid driving bans saying that in years only about cities would have excess levels of nox compared with about cities originally
the issue came to a head in february when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles
experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to million diesel vehicles in europe s biggest car market
merkel s government has been criticized for having too cozy ties with the auto industry due to its importance for jobs and exports
france and britain have said they will ban new petrol and diesel cars by
