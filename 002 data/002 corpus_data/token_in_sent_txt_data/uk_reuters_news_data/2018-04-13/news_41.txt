update 1-iran oil arrives in gdansk as poland diversifies supplies
adds details warsaw april reuters poland s biggest oil refiner pkn orlen said on friday that a shipment of tonnes of iranian crude oil has arrived at the baltic seaport of gdansk
most of the oil refined in polish refineries comes via pipelines from russia but pkn orlen and lotos are increasingly buying from other sources including iran and the united states
delivery from iran has become a fact
oil from the middle east gives us many opportunities
first of all it enables diversification of delivery directions and increases the energy security of the state pkn said in a statement
the iranian oil which is lighter than the russian crude and contains less sulphur will be refined at pkn s plant at plock northwest of warsaw
pkn said that earlier tests of the iranian oil confirmed its significant potential
it took a month for the delta kanaris tanker to transport the iranian cargo from the kharg island to gdansk
