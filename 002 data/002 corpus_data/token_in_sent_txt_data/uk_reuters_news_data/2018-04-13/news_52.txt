smog in key north china region rises 27 pct in march - ministry
shanghai reuters a major smog indicator in china s heavy industrial region rose by more than a quarter in march the ministry of ecology and environment said on friday raising concerns that pollution is increasing with the end of winter output restrictions
concentrations of particulate matter of less than microns known as climbed to micrograms per cubic metre in the region last month an increase of percent from a year ago the ministry said
the region includes china s capital and tangshan the world s largest steel producing city
a campaign that ended on march required chinese cities to reduce levels by as much as percent by slashing industrial output restricting traffic and cutting coal use
during the first quarter the levels of in the region which has been under heavy political pressure to tackle pollution dropped percent to micrograms per cubic metre down from near record highs in the same period of last year
that indicates the output cuts were working as intended but their expiration has increased concerns that pollution levels are rebounding as factories freed from restrictions ramp up output
nationwide during the first quarter concentrations fell percent from a year ago to micrograms per cubic metre in the cities monitored by the ministry
however in march average concentrations climbed percent from the year before to micrograms per cubic metre
seven of china s most polluted cities in march were in hebei province china s biggest steel producing region
tangshan and the city of handan have already decided to extend the winter curbs until november
however xuzhou an industrial city in eastern china s jiangsu province was also on the list of the smoggiest cities in march and during the first quarter a sign that china s smog is shifting from its northern heartlands as a result of the crackdown
the yangtze river delta region which comprises jiangsu zhejiang and anhui provinces and the city of shanghai saw levels fall percent in march but average levels rose percent in the first quarter as a whole
china is currently working on a new action plan to tackle pollution and experts have urged the government to introduce more targeted measures to tackle rising ozone which has become a growing urban health threat
chinese authorities are working to reduce concentrations because the small size of the particles allows them to be inhaled deep into the lungs and their accumulation eventually can cause lung and heart disorders
