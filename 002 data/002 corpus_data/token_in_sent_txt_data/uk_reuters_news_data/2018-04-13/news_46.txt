global stock markets have had a whipsaw week largely fuelled by president donald trump s tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues
the msci world index which tracks shares in countries was up nearly percent on the day
it has gained nearly percent this week its best weekly showing since march

the beginnings of european companies results were largely positive though misses were badly punished

overall friday s performance in stocks seemed to suggest investors were relieved at apparent suggestions from trump that a military strike on syria may not be imminent
however the threat of a strike remained after washington s earlier warnings against the syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians
it would be naïve in the extreme to suggest that the events of the last hours means that the threat of an escalation of geopolitical factors has passed said michael hewson chief markets analyst at cmc markets in london

while the figures pointed to robust demand from the world s top consumer of crude copper and iron ore they left the country with a rare trade deficit of billion for the month the first since last february
trade tensions also were not far from the surface with analysts at citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open asian economies such as taiwan singapore and south korea
in the most recent change of tack trump thursday asked his advisers to look at the trans pacific partnership a multinational trade pact he withdrew the united states from early last year
but he later tweeted that the united states would only join the tpp if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former president barack obama
