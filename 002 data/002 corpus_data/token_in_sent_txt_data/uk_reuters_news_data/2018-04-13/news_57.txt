update 2-exxonmobil resumes quake-hit png lng production ahead of schedule
resumption of output exports comes weeks ahead of expectations announcement expected to drag on spot asia lng prices near term adds comment detail prices melbourne april reuters exxonmobil corp has resumed production at the papua new guinea liquefied natural gas lng project a fortnight ahead of schedule after it was shut down in the wake of a deadly earthquake in february its australian partners said on friday
production at the png lng project was halted after a magnitude earthquake hit papua new guinea s interior on causing landslides damaging buildings and killing people
australia s oil search ltd and santos ltd said they had been advised that one train at the lng plant near port moresby has operations and the second train is expected to resume as gas production ramps up
lng exports which were expected to resume shortly will come weeks ahead of schedule and may put pressure on spot lng prices traders said
exxon mobil corp had earlier advised that production would restart in may
the recommencement of operations at the png lng project ahead of exxonmobil s previously guided eight week timeframe is a major achievement by the operator said oil search managing director peter botten
exxon mobil was able to restart production earlier than expected because damage to hundreds of kilometres of pipelines that run through the mountains between gas output facilities and the lng terminal was much less than initially feared a source involved with the project told reuters
santos is a foundation partner and holds a percent interest in png lng
oil search has a percent stake
exxon mobil declared force majeure on exports from png in march and the resulting uncertainty over supply drained liquidity from asia s spot lng markets traders said
at the time the project was halted in late february it was a time in the year when lng prices were to gradually fall down as demand eases said one industry source in tokyo
the halt did have some impact in that it took longer for asian benchmark prices to fall but the impact was rather limited because demand was weak at the time he said
asian spot lng prices have lost almost percent from their peak to around per million british thermal units mmbtu driven lower by a global supply overhang that developed as new production came online especially in australia and the united states
worry about the surplus has been tempered somewhat by unexpectedly strong demand out of china india and southeast asia especially over this past winter
before the quake the png lng project had been producing at around percent above its rated capacity of million tonnes a year
another trader said that although the announcement would likely weigh on prices any fall will be limited by summer demand expected soon from reporting by sumeet gaikwad in bengaluru melanie burton in melbourne jessica jaganathan henning gloystein and roslan khasawneh in singapore osamu tsukimori in tokyo editing by richard pullin and tom hogue
