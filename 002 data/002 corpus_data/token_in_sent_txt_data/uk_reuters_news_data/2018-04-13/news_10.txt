update 4-u.n. shipping agency reaches deal to cut co2 emissions
london reuters the united nations shipping agency reached an agreement on friday to cut carbon emissions following years of slow progress
the compromise plan which will cut emissions by at least percent by compared with levels fell short of more ambitious targets
kitack lim of the international maritime organization imo said the adoption of the strategy would allow future imo work on climate change to be rooted in a solid basis
the imo said it would also be pursuing efforts toward phasing out emissions entirely
delegates said opposition from some countries including the united states saudi arabia and panama had limited what could be achieved at the imo session this week in london
the imo should and could have gone a lot further said bill hemmings shipping director with green campaigners transport environment
this decision puts shipping on a promising greenpeace international political adviser veronica frank said the plan was far from perfect but the direction is now clear a of carbon emissions
this decarbonisation must start now and targets improved along the way because without concrete urgent measures to cut emissions from shipping now the paris ambition to limit warming to degrees will become swiftly out of reach frank said
shipping association bimco in contrast described it as a landmark achievement
kathi stanzel managing director of tanker association intertanko added it is the culmination of international efforts to develop both ambitious and concrete plans to respond to the challenge of our the shipping sector along with aviation avoided specific targets in a global climate pact agreed in paris at the end of which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature to well below degrees celsius from
european union countries along with the marshall islands the world s ship registry had supported a goal of cutting emissions by to percent by compared with levels
europe s transport commissioner violeta bulc and climate commissioner miguel arias canete said in a joint statement while the eu had sought a higher level of ambition this is a good starting point that will allow for further review and improvements over time
research group influencemap said an emissions cut of percent would have been much closer to what is needed if shipping is to be in line with the goals of the paris agreement
shipping accounts for percent of world emissions according to the imo the agency responsible for regulating pollution from ships
this is around the amount emitted by germany according to the latest eu data available and is predicted to grow significantly if left unchecked
the imo has adopted mandatory rules for new vessels to boost fuel efficiency as a means of cutting from ship engines
a final imo plan is not expected until
according to the text produced by the imo working group submitted to member states the initial strategy would not be legally binding for member states
the text separately pointed to possible measures to address emissions that could include and fuels improved energy efficiency for new and existing ships and possible mechanisms to encourage the shift to fuels
it also said its final strategy should be subject to a review in
marshall islands president hilda heine said the country s delegation had fought hard for the outcome
while it may not be enough to give my country the certainty it wanted it makes it clear that international shipping will now urgently reduce emissions and play its part in giving my country a pathway to survival heine said
