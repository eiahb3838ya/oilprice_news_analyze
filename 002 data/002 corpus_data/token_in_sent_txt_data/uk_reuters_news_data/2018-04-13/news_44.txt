global stock markets have had a whipsaw week largely fuelled by president donald trump s tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues

overall friday s performance in stocks seemed to suggest investors were relieved at apparent suggestions from trump that a military strike on syria may not be imminent
however the threat of a strike remained after washington s earlier warnings against the syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians

trade tensions also were not far from the surface with analysts at citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open asian economies such as taiwan singapore and south korea
in the most recent change of tack trump thursday asked his advisers to look at the trans pacific partnership a multinational trade pact he withdrew the united states from early last year
but he later tweeted that the united states would only join the tpp if the deal were substantially better than the one offered to former president barack obama
