aramco is world's most profitable oil company -bloomberg
london reuters saudi aramco is the world s most profitable oil company bloomberg reported on friday but its huge earnings and cash flows may still fail to justify its desired trillion valuation
financial performance at aramco has long been one of the best kept secrets in the oil industry but as the company prepares for a initial public offering ipo this year or next it needs to tell investors what it earns and how it operates
bloomberg news agency cited company accounts as saying aramco had net income of billion in the first six months of and cash flows of billion
aramco said this is inaccurate saudi aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal the accounts prepared to the ifrs standard showed the firm made billion in net income in the first of half of when crude averaged a barrel bloomberg said
saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman who has made the aramco ipo a cornerstone of saudi economic reform to wants to raise a record billion by selling a percent stake in aramco on local and foreign exchanges
that would give aramco a market capitalization of trillion the biggest achieved by any company and dwarfing peers such as exxon mobil and royal dutch shell
by comparison shell s current cost of supplies earnings excluding the closest equivalent to net income stood at billion in the first half of the same as exxon s
exxon had cash flow from operations and asset sales at billion in the first half of compared with shell cash flows of billion
exxon s current market capitalization stands at billion and shell is worth billion
even though aramco s cash flows are two to three times bigger its desire for a market value six to seven times higher than those of exxon or shell might look too ambitious to many investors and analysts who have said the company could be worth more than trillion
