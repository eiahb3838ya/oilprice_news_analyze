update 1-iea says "mission accomplished" for opec as oil stocks shrink
london reuters opec and its allies appear to have accomplished their mission of reducing global oil stocks to desired levels the international energy agency said on friday signalling that the market could become too tight if supply remains restrained
the iea which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised nations said stocks in developed countries could fall to their average a metric used by opec to measure the success of output cuts as early as may
it is not for us to declare on behalf of the vienna agreement countries that it is mission accomplished but if our outlook is accurate it certainly looks very much like it the iea said in its monthly report
opec has reduced production in tandem with russia and other allies since january to prop up oil prices which soared above per barrel this month giving a new boost to booming output of shale oil
graphic oecd stocks average graphic stocks as days of forward demand average but as oil production has collapsed in opec member venezuela and still faces hiccups in peers such as libya and angola the oil exporter group is producing below its targets meaning the world needs to use stocks to meet rising demand
on thursday the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in a monthly report that oil stocks in the developed world were only million barrels above the latest average
the iea put the figure at just million barrels as of the end of february
the iea said that even though output was set to soar by million barrels per day this year on higher production it was not enough to meet global demand expected to rise by million bpd or around percent
opec was producing million bpd in march below the call on its crude for the rest of the year at million bpd
our balances show that if opec production were constant this year and if our outlooks for production and oil demand remain unchanged in global stocks could draw by about million bpd the iea said
the figure would represent percent of global supply or around half of opec s current production cuts of nearly million bpd
the pact runs until the
opec meets in june to decide its next steps
the organisation s de facto leader saudi arabia has said it would like the agreement to extend into
opec mohammad barkindo told reuters on thursday opec and its allies were poised to extend the pact into next year even as a glut of crude should evaporate by september
opec is within rapid reach of its first announced goals and will have to come up with a new metric for the june meeting if it wants the agreement to last into the second half of the year said olivier jakob from petromatrix consultancy
qatar s energy minister told reuters last week that even though stocks around the world were falling an investment drought continued to afflict the oil industry and hence the price of crude could spike in the long run
reuters market analyst john kemp argues that recent statements from opec members indicate the organisation appears to be reformulating its target in terms of upstream investment rather than inventories
