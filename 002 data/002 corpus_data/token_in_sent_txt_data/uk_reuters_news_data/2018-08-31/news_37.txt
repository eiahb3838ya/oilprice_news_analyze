analysis-shanghai crude futures eat into western benchmarks as china pushes yuan
singapore reuters the launch of china s first crude futures contract in shanghai has added a asian benchmark to the global oil sector challenging the dominance of western and threatening ramifications far beyond the energy industry
since their launch in march shanghai crude futures have stolen market share from the incumbent benchmarks europe s brent and west texas intermediate wti which trade oil derivatives worth trillions of dollars every year
volumes have also far bypassed other crude futures such as those that the dubai mercantile exchange dme launched in with the goal of creating a middle price benchmark
this shift in oil markets could have implications including in foreign exchange markets
it s significant
given the prominence of china in oil markets we could see more use of the shanghai contract said stephen innes head of trading at futures brokerage oanda in singapore
he said foreign exchange markets were also taking notice of any since launching in late march volumes in shanghai crude futures have risen to trade almost million lots of barrels in july
this gave the contract a market share for july of percent compared with percent for brent and percent for wti crude futures
shanghai crude has good liquidity due to its high volatility and its correlation with international oil futures
it has become a good investment for speculators said zhang huiyao deputy general manager for crude oil trading at huatai futures in guangzhou
despite this early success operator shanghai international energy exchange is playing it cool
china s crude oil futures remain behind the mature contracts in europe and the president jiang yan told chinese media this month
for the contract to have greater impact it requires greater participation by foreign companies he said
zhang huiyao of huatai futures said more industrial players and pure trading companies would also help
we are hoping the exchange will create more derivatives contracts linked to the current crude oil futures to engage more diverse investors she said
commodity exchanges often build futures volumes by introducing related contracts which could include options forward contract time spreads or in the case of a crude contract derivatives for refined fuel products
graphic shanghai vs wti brent crude futures given china s status as the world s biggest oil importer some analysts say the rise of shanghai crude futures as a benchmark was inevitable
yet there has been a more immediate reason for its fast rise sanctions against iran
washington sanctions on tehran in may including its financial sector and transactions in the dollar
from november the sanctions will also target iranian oil exports and washington has put pressure on companies and governments around the globe to fall in line
as iran s biggest customer and amid its trade dispute with washington beijing is expected to ignore demands
china is already shifting some of its crude futures trading activity away from the dollar and into its own yuan
i m convinced china s strategy on the trade war is it will continue to purchase crude from iran in yuan hedging in shanghai innes said eliminating the currency risk of buying oil in the dollar
given russia s own disputes with washington innes said it could also be interested in selling oil to china in the yuan
shanghai crude futures could eventually remake global oil markets
beyond an active from domestic retail traders china s large oil firms have moved some futures positions out of brent and into shanghai crude said barry white senior vice president for derivatives sales at financial services firm intl fcstone
chinese oil refiners find the medium to sour middle east crude underlying shanghai futures more in line with their imports and usage than brent which is priced off north sea crude grades that tend to be lighter in quality white said
the first contract since the shanghai oil futures were launched is due for delivery in september with chinese majors like unipec china national petroleum corp cnpc and zhenhua oil accounting for most of the volume
cnpc declined to comment while unipec and zhenhua oil did not immediately respond to queries
western commodity merchants and banks have also been doing test trades in shanghai crude futures brokers and company sources said and are planning to start playing a bigger role
while other futures like dme s oman crude have had some success as a benchmark for physical oil prices their by the financial industry has been limited
china s new benchmark could change this potentially breaking the financial duopoly that has dominated oil trading for decades requiring international traders to get used to dealing some crude futures in yuan
the internationalisation of the yuan will continue to pick up the pace as mainland markets become more accessible and transparent and the shanghai oil contract is an excellent start to that process said oanda s innes
