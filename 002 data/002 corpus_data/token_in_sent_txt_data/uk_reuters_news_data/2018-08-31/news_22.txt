dam nation: big state projects spared in china's hydro crackdown
leshan china reuters in a mountain village in southwest china s sichuan province authorities have demolished seven small dam projects this year along a river to clear illegal developments in a new nature reserve
the demolition is part of a nationwide program to close hundreds of tiny and often ramshackle dams and turbines and bring order to china s massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction
the dams sat on an unnamed tributary of the fierce and dadu river which feeds into the yangtze asia s largest and longest river where the government says the irregular development of thousands of small hydropower projects has wrecked the ecology
for a series of pictures please click here but green groups say the campaign will not necessarily save the environment because it will not affect big state hydropower stations which they say have caused the most damage
on the zhougong river another tributary farmer zhang who declined to give his full name reckons big dams have devastated the ecology
zhang described himself as a hydropower migrant after his land was inundated by state dam builders years ago
he said changes in the zhougong s flow and temperature had devastated the local fish population with one species favored by the former leader deng xiaoping now wiped out
the fish here now taste terrible and are fit only for dogs he said pointing to three silver carp he had caught after they were swept down river by flood waters from an upstream reservoir
china triggered an aggressive damming program years ago as it looked for ways to develop industry and bring electricity to poor rural regions not connected to the power grid
investors rushed in and environmentalists likened the frenzy to the construction of backyard steel smelters during the great leap forward a program that aimed to industrialize china s agrarian society but caused widespread famine as farmers made metal instead of food
now the government wants to reverse course and the environmentally conscious leadership must decide how much of china s gigawatts of capacity needs to close while at the same time protecting expensive state investments
hydropower was a good thing at the time but as is often the case in china it turns into a swarm and we basically lose control said chen guojie a hydropower expert with the china academy of sciences in chengdu central china
sichuan underlines the case
total hydropower reached more than gw in greater than the total in most asian countries
it was also more than double the capacity of the province s power grid meaning lots of wasted power
china s official hydropower capacity was about gw at the end of june and around a third of that is considered small hydropower projects of less than mw
china s overall power capacity including coal and nuclear plants is gw
in june state auditors identified small hydropower projects in the regions along the yangtze and said the environmental costs of some plants were too high even though they had made historical contributions to development
a month later beijing ordered the regions to ban new construction and rectify illegal projects although it remains uncertain how many will be decommissioned
there is no unified standard and we still aren t clear which plants should be demolished and which ones retained said yang yong chairman of the hengduan mountain research society a environmental group
the government says small dams have disrupted the habitats and breeding patterns of many rare species of fish although green groups argue the damage wrought by bigger dams is more severe with entire towns and ecosystems submerged in water which they say increases the risk of earthquakes landslides and even climate change
on the km zhougong authorities have already demolished small projects built in nature reserves or encroaching upon new ecological red lines drawn up to shield a quarter of china s territory from development
but the river houses larger stations run by some of the country s biggest firms including guodian huadian and the state grid corp and the overdevelopment of the river was criticized by the environment ministry earlier this year
none of the firms or their local subsidiaries responded to requests for comment
central utilities have long urged regulators to crack down on small poorly planned dams which they say have eroded their own profits
hengduan s yang suspects small plants are being shut down to free up grid access for bigger dams
these small hydropower plants originally had grid agreements and if they were legal they could connect he said
if they can t access the grid because there are many big plants that isn t as far as zhang the farmer is concerned big hydro has already squeezed the life from the zhougong on which people have depended for decades
tens of thousands of people have made their living here but soon it won t be possible he said
