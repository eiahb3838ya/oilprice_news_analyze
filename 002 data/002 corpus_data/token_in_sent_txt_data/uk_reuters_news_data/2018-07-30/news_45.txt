the comments came after sabic reported an percent leap in net profit citing higher selling prices and a jump in sales volumes
the first half of was very positive and sabic expects the second half of the year to be equally positive ceo yousef told a news conference
sabic has been a focus of investor attention after reuters reported earlier this month that saudi national oil giant aramco aimed to buy a stake in sabic possibly taking the entire percent holding owned by saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund public investment fund pif
aramco subsequently confirmed the report
benyan said on sunday that talks on the potential acquisition of a stake in his company are taking place solely between aramco and pif
hard to expect anything in this regard talks are between an owner and a future investor yousef told a news conference
i can assure you we have trust in our sabic posted a net profit of billion riyals billion in the three months to june up from billion riyals in the period beating average analyst forecasts of a billion riyals net profit
benyan said the company s production rose by about million tonnes in the first half of the year and is expected to rise by three million tonnes by
quarterly sales climbed percent from a year earlier to billion riyals and were up three percent from the previous quarter
sabic shares edged down percent by gmt dragging the saudi index percent down but the stock is richly valued at over times trailing earnings
sabic s results are closely tied to oil prices and global economic growth because its products plastics fertilisers and metals are used extensively in construction agriculture industry and the manufacturing of consumer goods
the petrochemical giant has plans to expand its presence in global markets specifically in north america china and north africa benyan said adding that the company is looking at various options without giving further details
in europe the company is still committed to its investment in clariant and is awaiting antitrust approvals for acquiring a percent stake in the swiss speciality chemical maker which was announced in january benyan said
earlier this month clariant ceo said his company s update on its ties with sabic is likely to be delayed as antitrust approvals take longer than expected
