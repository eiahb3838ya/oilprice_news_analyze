feature-from robots to girl power, getting cameroon's women into work
yaounde july thomson reuters foundation with a flash of green light a robot sputters and whizzes across the room obeying the remote control commands xaviera nguefo and her team send its way
it is a scene that would not look out of place in a futuristic fantasy but is instead playing out in yaounde the dusty capital of cameroon with its potholed streets and frequent power outages
in a country where one in four girls do not even learn to read xaviera one of about young cameroonians studying at the nextgen centre in yaounde is picking up the basics of artificial intelligence
i love doing that because the physics that they teach us at school is all applied here she told the thomson reuters foundation
and it makes me a little bit smarter the centre is the brainchild of janet fofang a pioneering scientist and teacher who aims to train the future tech innovators of her country with a particular focus on its girls
it enables young cameroonians to learn to write code make robots and acquire advanced computer skills and is one of a range of initiatives fofang has set up including a technological school for pupils
we ve seen technology prove to every one of us that it s a good method to move away from poverty
and we all know that in these parts women always remain at the poverty line she said
nearly one in three girls in cameroon are married by according to a study by united nations children s agency unicef and this often means they drop out of education early
in percent of all children out of school were girls and data for the most up to date available showed women and girls made up percent of cameroon s illiterate population
studies suggest educating girls has a broader societal benefit that goes well beyond the individual child
if all girls had a secondary education child deaths would be cut in half saving almost million lives across the globe according to research by the cultural agency unesco
fofang says teaching girls about technology can help break the cycle of poverty from generation to generation but says social attitudes as well as a lack of opportunities are still holding them back
an overly ambitious girl in cameroon is not a good one if you re too ambitious society judges you she said
one woman who has not allowed society to hold her back is chemical engineer persis mbangsi one of a tiny minority of cameroonian women who have broken through the glass ceiling
she is the only woman among male engineers at the aluminium plant in cameroon where she works
together with other female engineers mbangsi established a social media initiative entitled hidden no more cameroon to showcase the achievements of women in technology
it was inspired by the hollywood film hidden figures which tells the story of three female mathematicians in the who defy the odds by going to work for nasa
we have a cultural background that says that a woman sits in the kitchen said mbangsi
but imagine in a community one person saying oh i ve seen her she s a petroleum engineer cameroon a income country wedged between central and west africa has natural resources including oil and gas timber and minerals yet percent of its million people live below the poverty line
the country needs to increase productivity and unleash the potential of its private sector the world bank said in april
after she qualified as an electrical engineer fofang worked in one of yaounde s poorest schools where most teachers lacked even basic computer skills
in she established her own school the tassah academy financing it herself with the help of her mother and sister
the school specialises in technology and percent of its students are girls
five years later seeking to take technology to schoolgirls around the country she launched a scheme to encourage other schools to set up clubs to get girls interested in science technology engineering and mathematics stem
in august xaviera and her team will travel to mexico to take part in an international competition to devise robots that provide reliable energy power systems a topic close to their hearts given the frequent power outages in cameroon
it s really frustrating sometimes
just as we re talking there can be a blackout said xaviera who wants to keep working on the issue
in the meantime robotics is helping her assert herself against the boys in the team and at school who she says often think they know best
xaviera recalled a recent case where she came up with the solution to a problem forcing them to concede she was right
and i was so happy she laughed
my solution it worked reporting by inna lazareva editing by claire cozens
