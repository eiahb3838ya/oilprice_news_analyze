petrobras expects to start pumping oil from new platforms in the fourth quarter that would add to output from latin america s biggest producer and lift its exports
the new supply could enlarge brazil s market share in china as buyers there cut oil imports from the united states following beijing s announcement it would impose tariffs on crude in retaliation against similar moves by washington
petrobras oil export curve is increasing and china is currently the company s main market a petrobras spokesman said in an
with chinese refineries growing interest in buying oil directly from producers petrobras will grow its presence with these petrobras started production in april at its buzios field in the santos basin from platform located about km off the rio de janeiro coast in water depths of metres according to the company s website

buzios crude has api gravity of degrees and contains about percent sulphur similar in quality to brazil s lula crude one of the most popular oils in china the company said
the new supply could help lift petrobras crude oil exports which dropped percent in june from a year ago to barrels per day million tonnes as the company hiked its refinery output
petrobras overall production in june stood at million bpd down percent from may
brazil s oil liquids output including biofuels is expected to rise by bpd to million bpd in after holding steady in according to consultancy energy aspects
china s demand for crude such as oil from angola and brazil jumped over the past two years after its independent refiners also known as teapots were allowed to import crude
that has moved brazil up two notches since to fifth on china s supplier list with bpd in the first quarter this year according to data from china customs
the teapots oil imports from brazil more than doubled in the first half of to bpd compared with the same period a year ago according to beijing consultancy sia energy
more than half of brazil s shipments to china went through ports in shandong province home to most of china s independent refiners according to thomson reuters eikon data

asia s largest refiner sinopec bought a third of china s brazilian oil imports in the first half of up percent from a year ago sia energy analyst seng yick tee said
sinopec and independents have the appetite for additional crude imports from brazil and the potential tariffs on crude is one of the reasons tee said
trade flow data on eikon however shows brazilian exports to shandong look set to drop in the third quarter before the additional buzios platforms start up as poor margins and tighter credit have forced teapots to cut runs
the tough environment is expected to push independents to seek more competitive oil supplies tee said
other sellers of brazilian crude include royal dutch shell and equinor
china national petroleum corp cnpc and cnooc ltd also have equity stakes in brazilian oilfields
