opec july oil output hits 2018 peak, but outages weigh -reuters survey
london reuters opec oil output has risen this month to a high as gulf members pumped more after a deal to ease supply curbs and congo republic joined the group a reuters survey found although losses from iran and libya limited the increase
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has pumped million barrels per day in july the survey on monday found up bpd from june s revised level and the highest this year with congo added
opec and allies agreed last month to boost supply as president donald trump urged producers to offset losses caused by new sanctions on iran and to dampen prices which this year hit a barrel for the first time since
on june opec russia and other agreed to return to percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in january after months of underproduction in venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above percent
saudi arabia said the decision would translate into an output rise of about million bpd
opec s collective adherence with supply targets has slipped to percent in july from a revised percent in june the survey found meaning it is still cutting more than agreed
following the opec decision kuwait and the united arab emirates raised output by bpd and bpd respectively in july the survey found
the bulk of the saudi supply boost appears to have been delivered in june as riyadh tapped storage tanks to push supply to million bpd near a record high
the increase infuriated iran and surprised other opec members with its scale
riyadh has boosted supply in july by a further bpd from june s revised level the survey found because domestic crude use in refineries and power plants has risen while exports have held close to june s rate
supply in nigeria often curbed by unplanned outages rose by bpd
royal dutch shell s nigerian venture lifted force majeure on bonny light crude exports
nigeria and libya were exempt from the original deal
iraq also increased supply as exports rose from the country s southern terminals
among countries with lower output the biggest drop of bpd was in iran
exports fell as returning sanctions discouraged companies from buying the country s oil
output in libya which remains volatile due to unrest edged down
fields in eastern libya resumed production after a standoff at export terminals ended but output was cut at the largest oilfield sharara
production also slipped in venezuela where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis and in angola due to lower exports in july against a backdrop of natural decline at oilfields
the addition of congo republic to opec in june has added about bpd to production and coupled with the increases by existing members has lifted opec output in july to the highest since october according to reuters surveys
before congo joined opec had an implied production target for of million bpd based on cutbacks detailed in late and nigeria and libya s expectations of output
according to the survey opec excluding congo pumped about bpd below this implied target in july
the survey aims to track supply to market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources thomson reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies opec and consulting firms
