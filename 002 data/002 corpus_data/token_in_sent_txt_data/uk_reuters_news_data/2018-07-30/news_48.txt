rpt-focus-how bp found shale profits with 'crystal ball' oilfield technology
repeats for additional clients with no changes in text companies harness big data to boost shale profits bp s bln bhp shale buyout reflects confidence in sector by ernest scheyder and ron bousso lufkin july reuters in the pine forests of eastern texas oilfield workers equipped with goggles are helping bp s shale business turn a profit for the first time
thousands of automated wells feed data on their performance into the firm s supercomputers each evening
if they show a need for maintenance an system summons a subcontracted repair firm to keep the shale wells flowing at optimal output and minimal cost
such technology has helped slash bp s shale oil and natural gas production costs by percent over five years
the shale business turned a profit for the first time in bp said although the company declined to disclose the figure
bp s progress in shale underpinned its billion acquisition last week of bhp billiton s shale operations
the deal highlighted bp s newfound confidence in a sector that has challenged oil majors which initially struggled to adjust to the quick pace and methods used to tap shale with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing
bp and other majors that had traditionally focused on large conventional drilling projects such as royal dutch shell and chevron were left behind when the shale boom took off a decade ago
the british energy giant is now catching up with smaller rivals using technology and its institutional knowledge from global operations to push shale into a second phase that it hopes will reward its massive scale over the agility of smaller competitors
we spent the last four years retooling our business and getting ready for this opportunity david lawler who heads bp s shale business said in a call with analysts after the bhp deal announcement
we re at the lowest production costs we ve seen in many years
we ll take that model put that to work on these bhp assets and dramatically improve production and bp faces other large rivals in the race to grow shale production and profits including exxon mobil corp chevron shell and norway s equinor
all are expanding drilling and acquisitions particularly in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico the largest oil field and the center of the shale revolution
they aim to capitalize on the vast resources unearthed by new drilling technologies which also allow companies to start and stop production quickly in response to market shifts
that s a key advantage over the commitments of billions of dollars required by offshore oil or liquefied natural gas lng projects
the bhp deal will transform bp into one of the world s biggest shale oil and gas producers
bp s total shale output will increase from barrels of oil equivalent per day boed to more than boed
its reserves will jump percent to billion barrels of oil equivalent
bp s output of shale oil which is worth more than natural gas is poised to rise from about barrels of oil per day bpd to about bpd by the middle of the next decade
the deal bp s first major acquisition in years also marked a watershed moment for the company in the united states as it looks to leave behind the billion fallout from the deadly explosion of its deepwater horizon rig in the gulf of mexico
the bhp deal will also bp as a major player in the permian basin
bp had sold all of its assets there to apache corp in august right after the gulf disaster
today bp operates more than shale wells that produce mostly natural gas in the haynesville basin which straddles eastern texas arkansas and louisiana
it has used the data from its automated wells to create a streamlined system that farms out maintenance to a fleet of contractors
the firm now orders up repairs much in the same way a homeowner uses a mobile app to hire a maintenance person or a passenger summons an uber for a ride
bp puts repair work out for bid to contractors who then compete for jobs
each contractor is rated after completing the work and those with high rankings have a better chance of getting hired again
this means we re not hiring and firing staff all the time depending on market conditions said brian pugh chief operating office of bp s shale division which the company created as a unit in
bp equips field staff and contractors with augmented reality goggles to make repairs more efficient modeling its methods in part on pokemon go a popular video game where virtual images appear to be in surroundings on the player s screen
the field workers are connected through their headsets to bp s houston offices where experts can see and show staff how to perform repairs while they work
bp has started to collect many of these fixes in a video library so staff can call up videos much like youtube to fix problems themselves without expert consultation
the company s algorithms crunch data compiled from its wells each evening
operators wake up each morning to a report telling them which wells may need repair a task that once took hours each day as workers drove from well to well in search of problems
the systems bp said cut downtime for wells needing repairs by percent boosting production last year by million cubic feet of natural gas across its shale portfolio
the technology provides a panoramic view into the ongoing needs of the oilfield said kimberly krieger who overseas bp s shale operations in eastern texas
it s like looking into a crystal ball krieger said
the firm s success in reducing costs reflects its ability to spend money automating its oil fields and overhaul work processes to drive down service and equipment costs
bp also separated its shale business from the main company to allow the business now headquartered in denver to form its own culture
we re able to leverage the best parts of our global business to boost our shale operations pugh said
our smaller shale rivals in the don t necessarily have other majors are shooting for the same results
exxon expects its shale operations to produce billion in profit by compared to a billion loss in
chevron expects percent of its profit to come from the permian by after it lost money there during the oil downturn of to
shell forecasts that shale operations will make money for the first time next year and cash flow will hit billion by
we use our global size to our advantage when we negotiate with greg guidry who recently retired as shell s shale boss told reuters in march
costs keep coming reporting by ernest scheyder and ron bousso editing by brian thevenot
