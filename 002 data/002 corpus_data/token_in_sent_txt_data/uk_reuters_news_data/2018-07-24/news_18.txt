preview-spotlight falls on cenovus debt reduction, rail contract talks
july reuters canadian oil sands company cenovus energy investors will scrutinize quarterly earnings this week for details on chief executive alex pourbaix s efforts and contract negotiations to help resolve pipeline jams
after last year unpopular acquisitihere of conocophillips assets pourbaix who inherited a company last october with c billion in debt is giving himself until to turn cenovus around and bring that figure down
he also took charge of a company with low staff morale and rising investor angst
he told reuters in may his target is to reduce cenovus balance sheet to times ebitda
cenovus leverage was times as of according to its latest filing here once the deleveraging is complete we will consider balancing returning cash to shareholders with investing in growth projects he said in the interview with reuters
douglas kee chief investment officer at leon frazer associates said cenovus is not expected to increase dividends until later in
he sees a rise of to percent at best
in the first quarter cenovus declared a dividend of cents per share representing an annualized yield of about percent
investors wiped out about a fifth of the company market value here when it bought conocophillips oil sands assets for c billion last year
shares are now up about percent after plunging to a record low in february
analysts on average expect cenovus to report a profit of canadian cents on revenue of c billion on thursday according to thomson reuters
it reported revenue of c billion and earnings of c cents per share in the period
but its turnaround plans have been complicated by pipeline bottlenecks that are choking oil flow from canada
a supply crunch of heavy oil from venezuela has increased demand for canadian oil sands but pourbaix told reuters that opportunity has been challenged by the pipeline crunch
transport bottlenecks the result of pipelines running at full capacity have deepened the discount for canadian oil over light crude and cenovus differentials per barrel jumped percent in the first quarter from a year earlier
pourbaix who has been negotiating with rail companies about increasing locomotive hauling capacity for oil said for rail to be competitive costs have to be closer to or a barrel than around currently to get to the gulfcoast
he said in may that he expects significant volumes of oil to move via rail out of alberta over the third and fourth quarters and into the new year but he declined to give a number
pourbaix has also trimmed the company s middle and upper management and initiated changes to improve employee morale including coffee chats with employees
the changes seem to have softened investors and two headhunters in canada said there are fewer cenovus employees looking for job changes
his message that capital allocation is more important and he is cutting costs cutting jobs willing to sell more assets i think that has certainly helped laura lau portfolio manager at brompton group said
