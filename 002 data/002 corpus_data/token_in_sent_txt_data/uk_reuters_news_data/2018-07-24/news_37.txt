the rand firmed more than one percent after ramaphosa announced china investment pledge which takes the amount overseas economies have committed to invest in south africa to billion since the start of the month
those commitments will help ease worries about the health of the south african economy which has performed poorly despite investor optimism when ramaphosa replaced jacob zuma in february
we have agreed that we must work as partners to improve the lives of our peoples by elevating our business commercial and trade ties ramaphosa told a joint news conference with xi
xi said china would take active measures to expand imports from africa s most industrialized economy
ramaphosa will host xi and the leaders of brazil russia and india at a summit of the brics group of emerging economies in johannesburg later this week where he will be looking to secure further investment pledges

ramaphosa has focused on revitalizing eskom which received an injection of billion from china development bank and reported a million loss on monday
transnet one of a handful of state firms accused of irregularities in the awarding of state contracts under former president jacob zuma received million from industrial and commercial bank of china
zuma denies wrongdoing
south africa s trade and industry minister rob davies said other investments planned by china included an expansion of electronics firm hisense s local operations and a metallurgical complex in limpopo province
