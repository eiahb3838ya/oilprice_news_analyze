column-oil market hits a cyclical pause: kemp
london reuters brent crude futures prices are trading in contango for the first time in months as traders anticipate an increase in crude availability during the remainder of
the brent calendar spread for the first six months slumped into a contango of cents per barrel on monday from a backwardation of as recently as april
brent futures are trading in contango for the four contracts closest to delivery from september through january
chartbook hedge funds and other money managers have sold a large number of long positions in recent weeks depressing the of the curve
portfolio managers tend to hold a majority of their positions in contracts close to expiry because that s where the liquidity is normally greatest
just as by the hedge funds spurred the rise in spot prices and calendar spreads in the second half of and first quarter of liquidation is now accelerating the correction
more fundamentally traders have reacted to pledges of increased output and exports from saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates and russia
saudi arabia and its opec and allies have responded to pressure from the united states to counter rising prices by increasing their production
extra barrels have been loaded in june and july with more promised in august ensuring increased availability in the second half of the year
fears about slower consumption growth as a result of a strengthening dollar and the intensifying trade conflict between the united states and china are also weighing on oil prices
because the oil market is concerns about the strength of consumption growth later in and are being discounted back to lower oil prices in the
spot prices and calendar spreads both exhibit cyclical behaviour at all scales from very seconds minutes and days to longer time horizons months quarters and years
in addition to the principal cycle in the oil industry the time series shows smaller epicycles operating at every scale
the recent softening of both spot prices and calendar spreads marks the turning of an epicycle underway since
the brent calendar spread surged from contango on june to backwardation on april before easing down to cents contango on july
over the same period hedge fund net long positions in brent soared from million barrels at the end of june to peak at million barrels in april and have now been reduced to million
the recent softening in spot prices and spreads arguably marks the ending of another epicycle that dates even further back to the start of the cyclical upswing in
during the recoveries after the last two oil market slumps dating from and spot prices rose for and months respectively before reaching their first major peak and spreads rose for and months
in the current expansion spot prices have risen for around months reaching their first major peak in may while spreads have widened for around months peaking in april
the current expansion is already relatively mature by most measures and has reabsorbed most if not all the slack inherited from the slump
rising prices have started to force a series of adjustments including a rapid increase in output from shale firms and opec
the higher prices will likely cause a slowdown in consumption growth though this may not be evident for some months given the longer delays in the collection and publication of data
fuel prices in many emerging markets are hitting record levels passing previous peaks in and as a result of a stronger dollar and the reduction of subsidies
experience suggests the ending of an epicycle need not mark the overall peak of the oil market cycle
but whether the current softening in spot prices and spreads turns out to be a temporary pause before the market starts tightening again or a cyclical peak depends critically on what happens with the global economy
there is now almost no cyclical slack in the oil market with stocks and spare capacity low
if consumption growth remains brisk it will eventually drive spot prices and spreads higher again to enforce rebalancing
but macroeconomic distortions and imbalances are starting to accumulate around the world in a reprise of the end of previous cycles
business cycle expansions in the united states and around the rest of the world are relatively mature
economies are running out of cyclical slack and inflationary pressures are rising
interest rates are rising and the dollar is appreciating against almost all other major currencies
the united states is still experiencing a strong cyclical expansion but the combination of tax cuts and rising interest rates is causing significant currency appreciation threatening to worsen the trade deficit
most other advanced economies have shown signs of slowing growth during the first half of and international trade volumes have started to grow more slowly
emerging markets are threatened once again by a combination of rising interest rates a strengthening dollar and escalating oil prices a cocktail that has proved dangerous in the past
none of these distortions is easy to resolve in the past they have often preceded a macroeconomic slowdown with a resulting slowdown in oil consumption growth
if the united states tries to deal with its growing trade deficit by successfully pushing to weaken the dollar it is likely to send nominal oil prices surging and reawaken concerns about inflation
if on the other hand the dollar appreciates further the resulting increase in local fuel costs will hit consumers in the other advanced economies and emerging markets hard putting downward pressure on crude prices
