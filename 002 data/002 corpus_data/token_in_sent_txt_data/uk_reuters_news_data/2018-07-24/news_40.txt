update 1-turkey told u.s. it opposes sanctions on iran -foreign minister
adds details background istanbul july reuters turkey has told american officials it opposes sanctions on iran and is not obliged to implement them foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said on tuesday
president donald trump has pulled the united states out of a nuclear pact with iran and ordered sanctions on tehran while a senior state department official said washington has told allies to cut imports of iranian oil by november turkey has criticised trump s move to withdraw from the nuclear pact and has publicly resisted the call to cut oil imports from iran
we do not have to adhere to the sanctions imposed on a country by another country
we don t find the sanctions right either cavusoglu told a news conference in azerbaijan
we held meetings with the united states in ankara and told them openly turkey gets oil and gas from azerbaijan iran russia and iraq
if i don t buy from iran now where am i supposed to meet that need from cavusoglu said
last week treasury and state department officials met turkish counterparts in ankara to discuss sanctions on iran
ankara said authorities were working to prevent turkey being hurt by the measures
turkey depends on imports for almost all of its energy needs
in the first four months of this year turkey bought more than million tonnes of crude oil from iran almost percent of its total crude supplies according to data from the turkish energy watchdog epdk
ties between ankara and washington nato allies have been strained over a host of issues including several legal cases
a turkish court last week ruled to keep american pastor andrew brunson in jail in a case that has deepened existing rifts and jeopardised the procurement of lockheed martin jets by turkey
the senate passed a bill last month including a measure that prohibits turkey from buying the jets because of brunson s imprisonment and turkey s purchase of russia s air defence system which are incompatible with nato systems
cavusoglu however said there were no issues with the procurement of the jets and the united states could not exclude turkey from the project
the united states needs to understand that it is not possible to get a result from turkey through sanctions
they will see results if they approach turkey with dialogue and respect he said
we will not bow down to such pressures sanctions or threats
