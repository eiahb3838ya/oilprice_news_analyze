exclusive-north korean fuel prices drop, suggesting un sanctions being undermined
seoul reuters gasoline prices in north korea have nearly halved since late march market data analyzed by reuters shows adding weight to suspicions that fuel is finding its way into the isolated economy from china and elsewhere despite sanctions
the united nations security council passed a resolution in december to ban nearly percent of refined petroleum exports to north korea over its nuclear and missile programs
but as north korean leader kim jong un has moved to improve relations with the united states china and south korea concerns have grown that the policy of maximum pressure through sanctions and isolation is losing steam
kim and president donald trump agreed to work toward denuclearization at their summit in singapore on june
experts say any fuel aid in breach of sanctions could erode the diplomatic progress
china said on tuesday it strictly abided by sanctions but indicated it may have resumed some fuel shipments to north korea in the second quarter of this year
gasoline was sold by private dealers in the north korean capital pyongyang at about per kg as of tuesday down percent from per kg on june and percent from this year s peak of per kg on march according to reuters analysis of data compiled by the daily nk website
diesel prices are at per kg down about percent from march
the website is run by north korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with multiple traders in the north after to corroborate their information offering a rare glimpse into the livelihoods of ordinary north koreans
in north korea gas is sold via informal channels such as street stalls and informal markets and by weight rather than by volume as it is in south korea the united states and elsewhere so north koreans prefer to quote per kg rates said kang who works at daily nk
a liter barrel of petrol holds around kg
prices stand at around cents per liter or per gallon
my assessment is that there was a greater inflow of fuel supplies from abroad especially china since kim s trips there said kang who speaks regularly to sources inside north korea
kim first visited china to meet president xi jinping in march and they held two more summits in may and june
the latest fuel data comes amid mounting suspicion in washington that north korea may be using the recent diplomatic thaw to get a lifeline from china
north korea gets most of its fuel from china its biggest trading partner and some from russia
washington and seoul officials have said the north imports some million barrels of refined petroleum products and million barrels of crude oil each year
last year s resolution capped refined imports at barrels a year
chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told reporters on tuesday that china has consistently and strictly abided by security council resolutions on north korea
china had exported tonnes of refined oil products to north korea in the first six months of this year out of a total of tonnes a year stipulated by the sanctions
china had reported its exports to the security council s sanctions committee in a timely manner geng added
the relevant situation is totally open and transparent he said without elaborating
since official chinese customs data showed no gasoline and diesel exports to north korea from january to march geng s comments suggested china resumed some shipments some time after kim and xi s first meeting
overall china s trade with north korea in the first half of this year tumbled percent on the back of the tightening sanctions customs data showed on monday
last week secretary of state mike pompeo accused north korea of illegally smuggling petroleum products into the country at a level that far exceeds quotas established by the un
illegal transfers are the most prominent means by which this is happening
every un member state must step up enforcement he wrote on twitter without naming any country
china and russia delayed a push last week for a un security council panel to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to north korea asking for more detail on a accusation that pyongyang breached sanctions diplomats said
the united states provided a list to the committee earlier this month of illicit north korean transactions and a few select photos seen by reuters
seoul s foreign ministry said last week that the authorities were investigating two ships with panama and sierra leone flags suspected to have illegally transferred north korean coal into south korea via russia
north korean rice prices have also been stable since a spike last september when the un security council imposed new sanctions
rice has hovered around per kg throughout this year
stable fuel and rice prices suggest no immediate signs of major suffering in north korea despite south korea s recent estimates the impoverished state s economy contracted at its sharpest rate in two decades last year
south korea s central bank said north korea s gross domestic product shrank percent last year marking the biggest decline since citing international sanctions and drought
while other defectors reported some suffering in remote rural regions daily nk s kang said fuel demand has been steady in north korea and overall living conditions have improved in line with a booming unofficial market economy
the unofficial markets known as jangmadang have grown to account for about percent of the economy according to the institute for korean integration of society
i ve seen signs the economy was slowly improving over the past five years and in last year things are still developing but perhaps not as fast as before a western consultant who makes regular trips to north korea told reuters
kim who vowed not to let the people tighten their belt again in his public speech in announced in april a shift in focus from nuclear programs to the economy
analysts say that will be difficult while sanctions remain in place
i don t think there is an outcry in the markets now but there could be one toward the end of this year said kim a north korea economy specialist at the seoul national university
