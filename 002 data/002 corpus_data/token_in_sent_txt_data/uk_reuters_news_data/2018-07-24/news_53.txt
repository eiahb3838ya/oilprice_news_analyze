china's stricter rules on shipping emissions a boon for imo 2020 compliance -woodmac
singapore reuters tighter rules on shipping emissions around china s coastlines from the start of next year is a clear sign the world s no
economy will strive for percent compliance when the global sulfur emissions cap starts in consultants wood mackenzie said on tuesday
on july china s ministry of transport announced it would extend its emission control areas ecas to include the country s entire coastline from
china s ecas limit the sulfur content of fuel ships can burn while operating in the ecas to percent
china s stricter policies for marine fuel specifications will undoubtedly play an important part in meeting the international maritime organization imo global sulfur cap said wood mackenzie consultant yujiao lei
in a global effort to combat air pollution from the shipping industry the imo ruled it will cut the sulfur content of the fuel that ships can burn to percent by january from percent currently
but questions around how the imo will implement the rules and ensure compliance have given rise to uncertainty since they were announced in
yet china s role in the world s shipping market for commodities and containers as well as the large number of international and domestic vessels calling at its ports the new regulations could be significant said wood mackenzie consultant yujiao lei
for shippers however the impact of the new ecas is expected to be limited over the near term
china s eca extension in will have minimal impact for sea zones since a majority of marine traffic is currently concentrated in the existing ecas said lei
also china s ecas only reach nautical miles out to sea and ships generally tend to slow down as they near the coast so fuel consumption in these areas is minimal said lei
there will be more upside for diesel demand from china s coastal areas later in when the imo global sulfur cap takes effect said lei
china s eca extensions come amid government efforts to turn some of its major ports in to marine refueling or bunkering hubs by setting up zones in zhoushan and hainan
by generating this demand the chinese government is not only creating a bunkering industry but also providing a solution for its refining industry s diesel surplus said lei
these ambitions could come at the expense of singapore the world s largest marine refueling hub
additional marine fuel demand in china to meet imo regulations will also put the country very close to singapore in terms of total marine fuel demand said lei
we expect barrels per day around million tonnes of bunker demand to shift from singapore to china in for international shipping said lei
