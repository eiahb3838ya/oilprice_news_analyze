colombia could create new system for oil round bidding amid delays
bogota july reuters colombia is preparing changes to its bidding process for oil areas in an effort to increase investment and find new reserves the head of the oil regulator said after repeated cancellations of its latest oil round
the changes including contracts adjusted to international crude price fluctuations and the chance for companies to propose exploration on land not yet on offer will help attract spending and nearly double reserves to at least years of consumption orlando velandia of the national hydrocarbons agency anh said
we re looking to improve conditions for the country to achieve competitiveness and motivate companies to make proposals about areas velandia said in an interview on monday
the anh in april postponed the deadline to receive offers for onshore areas at its jacinto auction until the second half of the year
it was the sixth time the round was delayed
colombia is the third latin american country hosting oil auctions this year after mexico and brazil
its bidding round comes after a pause when low oil prices stopped many latin american countries from offering acreage
colombia has been awarding blocks to the highest bidder every two to three years but bidding in the new system will privilege the first company that requests access to additional areas velandia said likely improving the offers of other bidders
once we evaluate the areas and they re added to the map companies can make offers in a continual competitive process velandia said
companies would no longer be required to outline planned investments or compensate the government if spending falls short he added
colombia could offer at least onshore and offshore caribbean blocks with the changes velandia said
companies having problems with social protests or delays in environmental licensing could be offered alternative areas he said
protests along with pipeline bombings are a major headache
ecopetrol lost some million earlier this year because of blockades
the country has billion barrels of reserves equivalent to about years of consumption
colombia produces about barrels per day bpd of crude half for export
the proposed changes must be approved by the anh s directive counsel which includes the ministers of energy and finance
changes not approved before will go to the government of ivan duque who has promised tax cuts investment in ecopetrol s refineries and a crackdown on attacks by rebel groups
