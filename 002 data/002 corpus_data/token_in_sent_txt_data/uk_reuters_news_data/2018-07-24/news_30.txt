update 4-defections hit nigeria ruling party in blow to buhari ahead of election
abuja reuters sixteen senators quit nigerian president muhammadu buhari s ruling party on tuesday and the country s third most senior politician said he might follow suit in a blow to the leader who seeks next year
fourteen of the lawmakers left the all progressives congress apc to join the opposition people s democratic party pdp a letter read on the senate floor stated
another two senators later left the ruling party while parliament was in session
senate president bukola saraki the number three political leader in africa s biggest economy told reuters in an interview a few hours later that the chances of him also leaving the apc were very very high
in a statement a buhari spokesman said no harm would be done to the party by the departures and the apc had done its utmost to stop the defections without providing details
buhari expressed total willingness to work with all members of the national assembly irrespective of their political party for the benefit of the nation the statement said
the fissures threaten to split support for buhari within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of the presidential poll scheduled for february that will decide who runs africa s top oil producer
the defections and the suggestion that there may be more to come have taken place just weeks after a faction within the party said it no longer backed buhari
fighting within the apc coalition which united to unseat buhari s predecessor rather than because of ideological unity has mounted for years in a struggle for power and influence between those loyal to the head of state and others who say they have been targeted in a by the presidency
divisions emerged publicly in the weeks following the apc s conference in june where new party leaders were elected
others saw their hopes of greater powers within the party dashed just months before the presidential and legislative elections
the pdp which was in power from the start of civilian rule in until buhari took office in said in a tweet that lawmakers in the lower house of representatives had also joined from the apc
the defections may also make it harder for buhari to enact his legislative agenda for the remainder of his first term
saraki speaking to reuters said he was considering his next move
i will spend the next few days consulting with my colleagues who have defected and also my other colleagues from my state and make my announcement very soon he said
he ran unopposed for the post of senate president mainly with the support of the opposition even though he is an apc member
he was not his party s preferred candidate and the manner of his elevation to the office in led to strains in his relationship with buhari
since then he has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since becoming senate president though none has led to convictions
asked about the raft of defections saraki said i must commend them for their courage because it took a lot for them to be able to do that in the face of this level of intimidation and the senate president and his supporters say he has been targeted by political opponents most recently on tuesday morning when he said his movements and those of his deputy were halted by police
images of the alleged incident were circulated on social media
police denied taking that action
the force wishes to categorically state that there was no authorised deployment of police personnel to besiege the residence of the senate president or his deputy as reported in the media a police spokesman said
he said the allegations would be investigated
amid an increasingly febrile political backdrop lawmakers in june issued a series of demands to buhari including a call for an end to the systematic harassment and humiliation by the executive of perceived political opponents
the president s supporters have previously rejected the accusations levelled against the former military ruler
i am committed to listening to very legitimate grievances and engaging all those who are aggrieved that we can see through their grievances adams oshiomhole the apc s national chairman told reporters in abuja after tuesday s defections
however he said it was best for those motivated solely by personal interest to return to where they belong
buhari said in april that he would seek another term
his candidacy depends on party approval though that is usually considered to be a formality for the incumbent
nigeria s main opposition parties earlier this month agreed to form an alliance to field a joint candidate to contest the election
