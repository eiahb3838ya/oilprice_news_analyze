france's avril raises biodiesel output on higher oil prices, demand
paris july reuters strong oil prices and a spike in demand has allowed avril s biodiesel plants to run at full capacity since june but argentine imports could force the european union s largest biodiesel maker to return to work its ceo said on tuesday
europe s biodiesel industry has been struggling since the eu reduced duties on imports from argentina last year after buenos aires mounted a successful challenge at the world trade organisation
avril implemented a plan to reduce production at its oilseed processing unit saipol in march blaming huge argentine biodiesel imports for exacerbating poor market conditions
we will renew the work for another six months because even though there is some progress argentine biodiesel is still coming massively into europe every month avril chief executive puig told reuters
european producers are hoping that the european commission will implement new taxes on biodiesel imports in september following renewed allegations that argentina unfairly subsidised its biofuel sector
for the moment we are running at full capacity but how long this will last i have no idea puig said
saipol found sufficient demand to run at full capacity for another two months he said
oil prices have surged in recent months mainly supported by sanctions on iran increasing fears of tight supplies
higher oil prices improve margins for biofuel makers
prices have also been supported by buyers starting to cover their biodiesel needs for next year in anticipation of higher prices following a new eu tax
industry sources said earlier this month that the threat of tariffs already halted argentine biofuel sales to the eu adding that imposing a tax would leave percent of the country s biofuel exports without a viable market
avril produced of million tonnes of biodiesel in from a capacity of million
production was expected to fall this year due to the reduced output implemented in march but the recent should allow it to make up for most of the shortfall puig said
the increase in biodiesel demand was also linked to growing diesel consumption and rising blending mandates in some eu countries puig also said
