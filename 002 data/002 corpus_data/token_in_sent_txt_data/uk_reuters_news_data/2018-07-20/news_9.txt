baltimore lawsuit blames oil and gas companies for climate change
washington july reuters baltimore filed a lawsuit on friday against oil and gas companies and entities including bp plc chevron corp and exxon mobil corp for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change
it was the latest in a string of cases attempting to hold oil and gas companies responsible for climate change caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels and came a day after a judge dismissed a similar suit by new york city
baltimore is vulnerable to any rise in sea level because it has miles km of coastline and one of the country s largest ports according to the complaint which points to research linking oil and gas production with rising sea levels
the city s suit filed in the baltimore circuit court says baltimore has been impacted by sea level rise and climate change leading to property damage economic injuries and impacts to public it says the baltimore area has suffered two storms within three years
baltimore s lawsuit accuses oil and gas companies of knowing about a link between climate change and fossil fuel production for nearly years yet working to hide the dangers and protect their assets rather than minimize the damage
the complaint seeks unspecified damages penalties and relief
these oil and gas companies could have warned us
they could have taken steps to minimize or avoid the damage
in fact they had a responsibility to do both but they didn t and that s why we are taking them to court said andre davis the city solicitor in a statement
also among those named as defendants are conocophillips royal dutch shell plc phillips marathon oil corp cnx resources corp hess corp and consol energy a chevron spokesman said the company supports meaningful efforts to address climate change but that lawsuits are counterproductive to real these lawsuits seek to penalize the production of reliable affordable energy which has been lawful and encouraged for decades by government officials chevron spokesman sean comey said in an email
a cnx resources spokesman said the company had not yet been served so was unable to comment
spokespeople for the other oil companies were not immediately available to comment
the oil companies had moved to dismiss new york city s lawsuit on numerous grounds including that the federal clean air act authorizes only the environmental protection agency to bring lawsuits over pollution
