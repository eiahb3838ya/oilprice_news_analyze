update 2-baltimore lawsuit blames oil and gas companies for climate change
reuters the city of baltimore filed a lawsuit on friday against oil and gas companies and entities including bp plc chevron corp and exxon mobil corp for knowingly contributing to what the city called the catastrophic consequences of climate change
it was the latest in a string of cases attempting to hold oil and gas companies responsible for climate change caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels
it came a day after a district court judge dismissed a similar suit by new york city saying in his ruling that climate change must be addressed through federal regulation and foreign policy because climate change is a global problem
baltimore is vulnerable to any rise in sea level because it has miles km of coastline and one of the country s largest ports according to the complaint which points to research linking oil and gas production with rising sea levels
the lawsuit filed in baltimore circuit court says baltimore has been impacted by sea level rise and climate change leading to property damage economic injuries and impacts to public it says the baltimore area has suffered two storms within three years
the lawsuit accuses oil and gas companies of knowing about a link between climate change and fossil fuel production for nearly years yet working to hide the dangers and protect their assets rather than minimize the damage
the complaint seeks unspecified damages penalties and relief
these oil and gas companies could have warned us
they could have taken steps to minimize or avoid the damage
in fact they had a responsibility to do both but they didn t and that s why we are taking them to court city solicitor andre davis said in a statement
also among those named as defendants are conocophillips royal dutch shell plc phillips marathon oil corp cnx resources corp hess corp and consol energy spokespeople for shell and chevron said the companies support efforts to address climate change or limit global warning but those initiatives should be addressed outside of lawsuits
we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change not by the courts shell spokesman curtis smith said in an email
a phillips spokesman declined to comment and a cnx resources spokesman said the company had not yet been served so was unable to comment
spokespeople for the other oil companies were not immediately available to comment
