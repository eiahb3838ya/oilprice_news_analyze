japan's kansai region a major battleground for gas and electric utilities
osaka japan reuters retail power and gas heavyweights kansai electric power and osaka gas are locked in a struggle for dominance in the kansai region whose economy is nearly the size of south korea s and includes osaka the city in japan
after the fukushima nuclear disaster the country s power monopoly system in place for nearly years was partially dismantled in followed by the liberalisation of the retail gas market a year later
hundreds of new power sellers soon arrived on the scene some with just a few dozen accounts
since then the kansai region has seen the most gas customers and the number of power customers switch providers
nowhere is that churn more evident than with kansai electric and osaka gas
kansai electric pulled about retail gas customers from osaka gas but lost about power customers to it
overall kansai electric lost nearly million power users
but its shares have risen percent since the beginning of compared with about percent decline for osaka gas
it s like the elephants battling horses
when power and gas firms battle it out against tokyo electric tepco or kansai electric for an extended period gas firms could lose said reiji ogino senior analyst at mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities
he said kansai electric is predicted to shed to percent of its customers in coming years
osaka gas however is expected to see its customer base shrink by to percent he added
that is because power companies which tend to be larger and more diverse can better weather deregulation ogino said
kansai electric for instance now sells gas to retail customers
and the company already the power supplier in japan has an additional advantage in the past months it has resumed operations at four reactors idled after the fukushima disaster
that has allowed it to cut its electricity prices by percent in july making them the among the former power monopolies
a price war is especially beneficial for large users such as japan which has switched its thousands of convenience stores to kansai electric
the savings could amount to tens of millions of dollars per year according to local media reports
osaka gas which has gigawatts of domestic power plant capacity mostly fired by gas reacted by undercutting kansai electric s prices
but kansai electric still offers cheaper combined power and gas service than osaka gas
this year it also began offering additional discounts such as waiving basic monthly fees for gas which have accelerated the pace of customer acquisitions from its chief rival
for graphic on kansai electric quickens pace of gas customer acquisitions click ogino said that the power and gas industries in japan are likely to enter a period of alliances of former power and gas monopolies in different regions by
the years after that might see mergers and acquisitions he added
but he said a merger of the two rivals would be unlikely
i don t think the trade ministry would allow the creation of one giant power and gas company in the kansai region because the competition principle does not work ogino said
shinichi yamazaki senior sector analyst at okasan securities agreed
chances for acquisitions or mergers in kansai region may be slim because the companies are large in size but there may be such cases in remote areas yamazaki said
kansai electric has tried to strengthen its position further by buying stakes in lng projects outside japan getting into retail gas sales and even delving into real estate
the history of their battle goes back two or three decades but given osaka gas thinks it s no match for kansai electric it has been diversifying its businesses from way back he said
history repeats itself and the battle will reporting by osamu tsukimori editing by gerry doyle
