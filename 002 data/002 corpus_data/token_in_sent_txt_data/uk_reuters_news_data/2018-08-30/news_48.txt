denmark swings to net oil importer after north sea production decline
copenhagen reuters a period for denmark as a net oil exporter is set to end this year following output declines in the north sea the country s energy agency said on thursday after slashing its oil production forecast
the danish energy agency expects this year s oil production to reach barrels per day bpd down from bpd last year and percent lower than an estimate given a year ago
the lower production forecast was due to downward adjustments of north sea resources as well as delays and greater uncertainty regarding the development of several fields and discoveries
denmark has been a net oil exporter since when technological developments such as horizontal drilling made it possible to extract difficult reserves in the north sea
production peaked in at bpd
the flip to net importer comes as a surprise as denmark was expected to remain a net exporter of oil for a number of years
but going forward with the exception of the nordic country s oil consumption is seen exceeding production
the energy agency cut its production forecast by percent and the forecast by percent compared to previous projections given in
last year maersk oil which maersk sold to total last summer in a billion billion pounds deal and its partners decided to invest billion danish crowns billion pounds in redeveloping the tyra field the largest investment ever in the danish part of the north sea
the reconstruction of facilities at tyra will hit oil production in and the danish energy agency said
total s partners in the field are shell chevron and denmark s nordsofonden through the danish underground consortium
the forecast for gas production was reduced by percent but denmark is still expected largely to remain a net exporter until after
