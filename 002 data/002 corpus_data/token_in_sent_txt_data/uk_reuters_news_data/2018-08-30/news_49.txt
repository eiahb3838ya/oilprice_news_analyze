polish gas company pgnig could increase network investment
warsaw reuters polish gas company pgnig expects to spend more than billion zlotys billion pounds on its distribution network by its chief executive said after shareholders recently voted in favour of investment over dividends
that level of spending would be up from around billion zlotys over the past four years
in a vote on july shareholders of the company poland s dominant gas provider voted to allocate net profit to reserve funds freeing it up to be used for investment
as long as our owners will not require dividends we will certainly invest in distribution even over the figure of billion over the period by chief executive piotr wozniak told a conference call with analysts
pgnig had planned to spend half of profit on dividends before holding the vote on the issue
when asked about dividend payouts next year from profit wozniak said it was too early to comment
he was speaking after pgnig reported a rise in second quarter net profit from a year earlier to million zlotys on higher oil and gas prices and increased sales
pgnig imports most of the gas it sells from russia s gazprom but has taken steps to reduce that reliance by buying more liquefied natural gas lng from qatar the united states and norway
russian prices in this region are still at a very high level maciej wozniak pgnig deputy head said on the call
in june a swedish arbitration court said in an interim ruling that pgnig could demand a lower price for gas it buys from gazprom
piotr wozniak said on thursday that he hoped there would be a final ruling by the end of this year
gazprom prices are and will be the highest unless the contact with gazprom changes wozniak told analysts
