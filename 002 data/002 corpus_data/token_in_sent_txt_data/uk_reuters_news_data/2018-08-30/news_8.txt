campaigners launch uk boat made of recycled plastic waste
london reuters environmental campaigners launched a boat on the river thames on thursday made almost entirely of recycled plastic waste in an effort to raise awareness of growing levels of rubbish in britain s waterways
the punt was built by mark edwards who also made the gloriana barge for queen elizabeth s diamond jubilee
named the pet project the boat will run regular trips along the river to fish out plastic rubbish which in turn will be used to build more such vessels
edwards used traditional techniques to make the boat
we went back to the technology inherited from the vikings he told reporters at the launch in richmond southwest london
it took us two men about six weeks flat out so it s quite a lot of work but for a craft that s going to last years it s each year tonnes of rubbish is cleared from the thames and a large proportion of it is food and drink packaging that comes from dry land says the environmental charity hubbub which is behind the project
it adds on its website much of the litter is being eaten by birds fish and other species which is leading to percent of thames fish found to have plastic in their pet project is hubbub s second boat made of recycled plastic waste
i think this shows that plastic is not just an issue that s in far away oceans it s present here in london and actually there s lots we can all do about it said its director gavin ellis
it s about making sure you don t put litter in an overflowing bin where it can blow out into the river and it s obviously about not dropping litter directly into the reporting by saeed haque editing by stephen addison
