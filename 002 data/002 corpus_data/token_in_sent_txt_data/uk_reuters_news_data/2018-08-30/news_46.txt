mexican wave: harnessing the pacificâ€™s blue rollers for green energy
tepic mexico aug thomson reuters foundation energy from the ocean breakers that pound mexico s pacific coast could soon be turned into electricity as an israeli joint venture finalises permits and financing for the country s first wave energy plant
wave power development has long lagged renewable rivals such as solar but eco wave power says it could prove an effective way to deliver power to coastal communities in countries such as ghana or kenya that have little access to electricity
the ocean is the biggest renewable resource that we have and it s completely untapped and it has to change said inna braverman of tel eco wave power
at the moment we re a comparable price to solar but the advantage on top of solar is the availability of the resource
it keeps working she told the thomson reuters foundation
after scanning the coast for optimal wave conditions the company decided to set up its first mexican plant near manzanillo the country s busiest cargo port some kilometres miles west of mexico city
situated close to the shore hundreds of floating buoys connected by arms to a jetty would move with the waves to generate clean electricity at the plant
the power then would be fed into a controlled by the electricity company said ernesto delarue rodriguez chief executive of joint venture partner eco wave power mexico
the plant would be able to power about homes he said
in the event of storms eco wave power s system could lift its buoys or submerge them until high waves pass the company said on its website
aside from wave energy companies around the world are looking to tap the vast potential of the oceans by creating energy from tides currents and temperature differences but commercial breakthroughs have so far been limited experts say
ocean energy has not yet reached the commodity phase of development
if you want solar go buy some solar panels
if you want wind energy go buy a wind turbine said mark horenstein professor of electrical engineering at boston university in the case of ocean energy no one company or entity has come up with the killer application that s going to be the definitive method for ocean any ocean technology also has to be able to survive a storm the worst storm expected over a century and such events could become increasingly more likely with a changing climate he said
the patchy history of wave energy projects has made some investors cautious about sinking their money into ocean projects said braverman whose company is considering a stock market listing to help raise capital
the manzanillo project which expects to receive final permits in the coming weeks will cost around million
a chunk of the financing will come from the israeli company but much of it will be raised by the mexican venture partner
delarue who is also working on a wave energy project in the bahamas said construction should start this year once financing and permits fall into place though admitted that in some cases mexican investors are not used to investing in aside from mexico braverman said her company was waiting to start work on a wave power plant in gibraltar that could provide percent of the enclave s electricity and has orders in countries including china and britain
born miles from chernobyl just two weeks before the nuclear power plant disaster braverman said her experience of the devastating impact of contamination helped spur her interested in clean power
there s many people saying yes we need to fight pollution in the future yes we need to recycle we need to invest more in renewable energy but they don t actually understand the meaning behind it she said
i experienced first hand the negative impact of pollution and i got a second chance in life she said
