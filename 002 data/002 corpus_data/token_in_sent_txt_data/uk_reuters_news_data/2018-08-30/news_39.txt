half of vw models in germany not compliant with new pollution standard
frankfurt reuters german carmaker volkswagen said only half of its vw branded passenger car models in germany are compliant with a new pollution standard thanks to a much tougher emissions testing regime
cars in the european union must comply with the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure wltp from september but volkswagen has only gained regulatory clearance for seven of its main model lines
the new tests are more cumbersome and take two to three times longer than in the past even limited edition models need to be tested separately volkswagen s thomas zahn said in a call with journalists on thursday
the coming months will be challenging for us said zahn head of sales and marketing for volkswagen passenger cars
volkswagen s golf model is among the vehicles still waiting to be cleared by authorities zahn said
he said he expected the golf to pass the wltp standards by the end of september
shipments of cars are expected to slow down in september and october but pick up again in the final two months of the year
we expect very strong deliveries in december zahn said
carmakers including daimler volkswagen and supplier valeo have cut profit expectations blaming a slowdown in global sales triggered in part by delays getting vehicles certified to the new standard
analysts at evercore isi said the wltp delays at the vw brand appear to be under control since the carmaker has not resorted to heavy discounting to keep sales flowing
nonetheless delays will cause profitability of the brand to drop to around percent in the third quarter from percent in the second quarter evercore said in a note on thursday
