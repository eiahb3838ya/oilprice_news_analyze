analysis-now you see it, now you don't: oil surplus vanishes ahead of iran deadline
london reuters an overhang of homeless crude in the atlantic basin has halved in recent weeks suggesting oil traders are bracing for a further supply loss from iran due to sanctions and a new rally in prices
iran s oil exports are already dropping fast as refiners scurry to find alternatives ahead of a reimposition of sanctions in early november which in turn has helped drain a glut of unsold oil
the millions of unsold barrels of crude that had pooled around northwest europe the mediterranean and west africa over july and august are rapidly draining
a surplus in the west african market that depressed prices to their lowest in months has almost vanished
traders had said just one week ago that leftover crude from the august and september loading schedules amounted to some cargoes equivalent to an average barrels per day bpd
now that overhang has dwindled to a handful of unsold cargoes while demand for angolan oil the favored west african grades for chinese refiners has been even more robust than that for september
the overall situation is that sanctions toward iran are now increasingly kicking in which will help to dry up the physical crude oil market and place it back into solid backwardation seb head of commodities bjarne schieldrop said in a note this week
this will shift the front end brent crude oil price into the higher range with a touch of graphic surplus of unsold waf crude cargoes dwindles the belief that supply will fall short of demand is reflected in the futures market when the price of a contract rises above that of a one a situation known as backwardation
with a little over nine weeks until possibly more than million bpd of iranian supply is off the market brent futures are now at their closest to backwardation in almost a month leaving the october contract just cents below november nearly half what it was in late july
concern over oil demand particularly in china has been put to rest for now at least
consumption by china s independent refiners or teapots has picked up sharply in august to around million bpd up percent from lows in july as plants return from prolonged summer maintenance
shipments of west african crude to asia generally have hit record highs of million bpd in august thanks in large part to indian demand while european refineries appetite for crudes similar to iran s has pushed the price of russian urals to its highest in nine months
looking at the spreads it s starting to appear as if the market is somewhat tightening
the west african overhang has disappeared so it looks as though that in opec output in june and july is starting to be eaten into ing commodities strategist warren patterson said
a number of major producers including saudi arabia and russia are boosting output after having agreed to cut by up to million bpd since january to fill any gaps in supply left by the sanctions and prevent price spikes
in europe the north sea market is still suffering from a surplus of crude that grew so large earlier in august that traders resorted to keeping it on tankers arguably the most expensive storage option
graphic crude oil in floating storage around the atlantic basin this pool is finally shrinking
according to reuters data some million barrels of oil are still in floating storage around northwest europe and the mediterranean including north sea crudes such as forties and ekofisk saudi arab light algerian saharan russian urals shale and west african grades such as nigerian bonny light and ghanaian jubilee
but this is down from nearly million a few days ago
even though oil supply from outside the organization of the petroleum exporting countries may grow next year output from venezuela mexico and angola continues to decline and other big exporters like libya and nigeria are prone to disruption
add to that years of underinvestment as a result of an oil price that struggled below a barrel and some big investors believe the market is ripe for a rally
