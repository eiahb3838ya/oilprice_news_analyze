refile-analysis-savvy european utilities shield themselves from higher carbon costs
reuters the surging costs of carbon permits have caused some of europe s biggest utilities to lock in purchases in advance while nuclear and hydro firms are benefiting from the effect on power prices
carbon permits traded under the eu s emissions trading system ets have become the best performing commodity this year almost trebling in price to over euros pounds a tonne since january on the back of stronger energy prices and measures to reduce supply
the ets which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis which dragged prices down to lows of euros a tonne
now at highs stronger carbon prices make it more expensive for european utilities to burn fossil fuels encouraging a shift to cleaner energy sources
prices are expected to keep rising according to a reuters survey of analysts last month
market participants can hedge their exposure to rising prices by buying enough carbon permits when the price is low to cover their future emissions output
if they have a surplus they can sell them back to the market and make a profit when the price rises
if they don t have enough they would have to buy more at a higher price
higher carbon prices mean higher costs for all european utilities unless of course they hedged or stockpiled allowances said french energy consultant hibault laconde
one such company is german generator rwe which said it had protected itself against power price volatility by selling fuels as opposed to selling power production and simultaneously buying enough emissions permits
our position is already financially hedged until the end of and we have also taken steps beyond chief financial officer markus krebber said during recent earnings calls with analysts
coal plants have benefited for years from low carbon prices which kept operational costs down
many old german coal plants could be operated at low overheads and they were the price setters in the wholesale market for thermal generation
rwe s hedging strategy involves nuclear and brown power being sold usually up to three years in advance and hard coal and ones closer to production
rival uniper said it sold the bulk of its hydroelectric output next year
the rise in carbon prices will force inefficient coal plants out of the market chief financial officer christopher delbrueck said this week
aurora energy research said german producers of coal from lignite a heavily polluting brown coal such as leag eph and rwe had reason to worry
the carbon price rise to euros from euros a year ago could have produced additional costs of billion euros according to aurora analyst hanns koenig
in poland the country s four major state producers are historically heavily exposed to coal generation
tauron s chief executive has called the eu carbon price a tax
this is not a comfortable situation for us
because of the policy energy could become a luxury good he was quoted as saying by state news agency pap at the weekend
for companies producing electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric plants higher carbon prices are welcomed
the wholesale price of power reflects the cost of buying carbon permits and fuels
coal and gas prices have risen this year due to chinese demand a cold winter and a heatwave across europe
the benchmark german power price is at a year high
france s edf which has a generation fleet made up of percent nuclear and percent renewables should produce more competitive electricity in interconnected european markets
the higher prices are a huge jackpot for edf as they drive up wholesale power market prices
this is the case for all nuclear and hydro power producers said nicolas goldberg energy specialist at colombus consulting
a spokesman for swedish utility vattenfall said price rises supported its strategy of becoming less reliant on fossil fuels
if current price developments continue we expect a gradual decrease in profitability of assets
however our diversified portfolio with a significant combined heat and power share is rather robust to such developments he added
germany s uniper which has inherited the thermal and hydro plants of former parent said it had factored in significant price increases for carbon coal and power in the coming years
that will give our earnings a boost from cfo delbrueck said
germany s is focussing on power grids and retail activities and is left with nuclear power production only in germany and sweden where it also operates hydropower
czech nuclear coal and renewable generator cez has sold over percent of its expected output benefiting from a higher share of nuclear than pure coal generators
some analysts say a carbon price around euros could encourage more utilities to switch to lower carbon fuels
power generation becomes more competitive at a carbon price of round euros a tonne
however margins for plants are still mostly negative despite a cleaner carbon record as high oil and gas prices mean high purchasing costs for generators coal
uniper s delbrueck said it should be closer to euros to get a stronger fuel switch
