update 3-iran is complying with nuclear deal restrictions -iaea report
vienna reuters iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers a confidential report by the atomic watchdog indicated on thursday
in its second quarterly report since president donald trump announced in may that the united states would quit the accord and reimpose sanctions the international atomic energy agency said iran had stayed within the caps on uranium enrichment levels enriched uranium stocks and other items
in its last report in may the iaea had said iran could do more to cooperate with inspectors and thereby enhance confidence but stopped short of saying the islamic republic had given it cause for concern
thursday s report to member states seen by reuters contained similar language
it said the nuclear watchdog was able to carry out all complementary access inspections needed to verify iran s compliance with the deal
timely and proactive cooperation by iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the additional protocol and enhances confidence said the report which was distributed to iaea member states
the production rate of enriched uranium is constant
there is no change whatsoever a senior diplomat added
with the united states reimposing its sanctions on iran that were lifted under the nuclear deal many diplomats and analysts now doubt that the accord will survive despite european union efforts to counter some of the effects of trump s move
sticking to the nuclear accord is not the only way forward for iran foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said on thursday
being the party to still honour the deal in deeds not just words is not iran s only option he said on twitter
speaking after the iaea report was sent to the agency s member states french foreign minister le drian said the deal was still holding despite the withdrawal
he urged his fellow ministers who met in vienna on thursday to discuss eu policy on iran to do more to protect tehran from sanctions calling for permanent financial mechanisms that allow iran to continue to trade
the eu implemented a law this month to shield european companies from the impact of sanctions on tehran and has approved aid for the iranian private sector although large european companies are pulling out of iran
adhering to the deal should bring iran economic benefits zarif said
if preserving the jcpoa the deal is the goal then there is no escape from mustering the courage to comply with commitment to normalize iran s economic relations instead of making extraneous demands zarif wrote on twitter
on wednesday iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei cast doubt on the ability of eu countries to save the agreement and said tehran might abandon it
khamenei told president hassan rouhani not to rely too much on european support as he came under increased pressure at home over his handling of the economy in the face of sanctions with key ministers under attack by parliament
le drian whose country signed the iran deal along with britain germany china russia and the united states under barack obama said tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in syria and yemen
those issues were not covered by the deal and trump has cited this as a major reason for pulling washington out of it
le drian said iran which says its missiles are only for defence was arming regional allies with rockets and allowing ballistic proliferation adding iran needs to avoid the temptation to be the regional iran has ruled out negotiations on its ballistic missiles and broader middle eastern role
