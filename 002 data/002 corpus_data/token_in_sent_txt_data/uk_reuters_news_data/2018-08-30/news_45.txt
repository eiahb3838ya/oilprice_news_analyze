china's solar subsidy cuts erode the impact of trump tariffs
los angeles reuters a move by china to slash subsidies for domestic solar installations has unleashed a flood of panels onto the global market pushing down prices and eroding the impact of president donald trump s tariff on solar equipment imports according to industry officials
that s good news for companies that purchase and install imported solar panels including inovateus solar and pine gate renewables which had expected that the protectionist policy would raise their costs and slow their business
the falling prices however will hurt panel manufacturers including china s jinko solar and korea s hanwha q cells which had announced hundreds of millions of dollars in solar manufacturing investments in the expectation that tariffs would boost their profits
trump announced a levy on all imported solar panels in january his opening salvo in an escalating global trade war that he says is aimed at helping manufacturers and other businesses rebound from years of decline
critics say the tariffs could backfire by hurting other domestic industries that depend on imports
the prospect of solar tariffs initially sent panel prices soaring making domestic manufacturing more profitable and drawing a handful of new investments
but the tax on imports cooled the pace of solar installations by raising panel costs
the solar industry employs more than people with about percent of those people in installation and percent in manufacturing according to the energy information administration
the solar panel market shifted in june after china the world s top solar installer and a major critic of the trump tariff announced a plan to cut the amount of installed solar capacity this year nearly in half by cutting subsidies for such projects
while the move could undermine the effectiveness of trump s tariffs on panels china s national development and reform commission has said the subsidy cuts were motivated mainly by domestic concerns about the industry s rapid growth
surging solar capacity has left china struggling to build sufficient transmission infrastructure to link projects to the electrical grid and the finance ministry has scrambled to find billions of yuan in subsidies owed to new projects
the subsidy reductions forced chinese panel makers to find new buyers on the export market
the increased global supply has driven down the cost of buying a panel in the united states to about cents a watt from cents shortly after the tariff according to pricing data from wood mackenzie power renewables
the research firm said prices could fall to about cents by the end of less than they were before the administration began considering a tariff in
it s becoming a buyer s market again said sheldon kimber chief executive of developer intersect power a solar project developer founded in that has plans to purchase large volumes of panels starting in
the unexpected price declines are eroding the effectiveness of the tariff in boosting manufacturing profits and could completely offset its initial market impact by november said paul strigler a vice president with esplanade capital a investment firm that has a fund dedicated to solar energy investments
white house spokeswoman lindsay walters did not respond to a request for comment
the tariff on solar modules steps down by percentage points a year before expiring in
the solar energy industries association seia a trade group representing both solar developers and panel manufacturers opposed the tariffs as a net loss of industry jobs and revenue
the falling prices mitigate some of the pain but still amount to a drag on growth said seia spokesman dan whitten
it may be less bad than it could have been but it s still not nearly as good as it should be he said
solar developers including cyprus creek renewables and southern current told reuters earlier this year that the higher panel prices caused by the tariff had forced them to cancel or freeze plans for more than billion in projects a figure that topped new investments announced by manufacturing firms that benefitted from the tariffs
many installers are now feeling more optimistic
south bend inovateus solar for example said lower panel prices had helped it close a deal in june to develop a megawatt system for the city of pratt kansas and to revive hiring plans
the drop in panel prices has really helped stimulate more activity inovateus tj kanczuzewski said in an interview
the lower prices have also helped the economics of projects already in the pipeline especially those with marginal prospects for a payoff said ben catt chief development officer of charlotte north pine gate renewables
cypress creek said the decline has yet to resuscitate its shelved projects for but the company said it expects panel prices to keep falling potentially helping projects next year
ramping construction up and down is not something that happens overnight said cypress creek s director of government affairs hewitt strange
southern current did not respond to requests for comment
colin smith an analyst for wood mackenzie power renewables said he expects the solar market to expand between and because of the falling price of panels instead of remaining flat as the firm had forecast earlier this year
the market has become comfortable again smith said
panel manufacturers that announced expansions in response to the tariffs including china s jinko solar sunpower corp and canada s heliene said they still planned to move forward with planned investments
but the falling prices are forcing them to operate at a lower margin they said to compete against foreign rivals who benefit from lower labor and material costs
it makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging sunpower chief executive tom werner said in an interview
sunpower earlier this year agreed to take over the oregon factory of troubled solarworld americas one of the companies that sought the tariffs
the deal is expected to close before the end of the third quarter sunpower said
the facility is capable of producing nearly a gigawatt of solar cells and modules a year or enough energy to power about homes
jinko s investor relations director sebastian liu called the price collapse a normal fluctuation and said the firm was making reasonable margins thanks to a focus on higher efficiency products and lower costs for polysilicon solar s key raw material
he said jinko will begin producing panels at a facility in florida in the fourth quarter of this year
heliene president martin pochtaruk said his company had weathered such price drops before and would do so again as it works toward opening its minnesota factory next month
heliene took over the facility in may of and has invested million to get it up and running
the company expects to produce mw of panels there a year
heliene said it would focus on cost cuts to compensate for falling prices
it is of course stressing pochtaruk said of the sudden market shift but also business as usual in a volatile sector
