rpt-focus-inside albemarle's quest to reinvent the lithium market
repeats to widen distribution by ernest scheyder aug reuters as global demand for lithium hits overdrive albemarle corp is investing millions of dollars to engineer specialized types of the light metal for electric car batteries part of a strategy to remain the niche market s top producer
the pivot comes as battery makers such as panasonic corp the sole battery supplier to tesla inc increasingly demand more purified versions of lithium that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery s charge shaping albemarle s strategy according to sources and documents reviewed by reuters and confirmed by the company
once used primarily as a pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder lithium has become one of the world s most commodities thanks to the rising popularity of electric vehicles powered by batteries
roughly electric vehicles were sold globally in a figure that is expected to jump sevenfold by according to estimates from the energy information administration
albemarle s strategy which includes developing a battery research center near its north carolina headquarters is aimed at setting it apart from its major competitors including chile s sqm and china s tianqi lithium corp
albemarle has historically sold basic types of lithium under contracts much like rivals
now the company is diverging from rivals and developing dozens of lithium products that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery s charge
what we are doing is not a moonshot but rather just good engineering albemarle s lithium unit head eric norris said at a private dinner earlier this summer attended by state street global advisors goldman sachs group inc and other top shareholders according to two sources
as more lithium production comes online in the americas and asia concerns about oversupply are high making a push into specialized lithium a crucial step for albemarle
lithium is much more a specialty chemical than a mined product said joe lowry an independent lithium industry consultant
it s definitely not a commodity because it s not a fungible albemarle is now trying to use its technical and clout to forge customer partnerships that it hopes guarantee profit for decades
if every new lithium project that s been announced does come online that could cause market oversupply said deutsche bank mining analyst chris terry
there s a lot of bearishness in the market and differentiation is the key to by treating the metal with various chemicals and other processing steps lithium s chemical structure can be rearranged to boost electricity storage and increase charge which albemarle hopes will make it even more indispensable to battery makers and the electric car industry norris told the investor dinner
battery requirements are becoming more stringent and there is a definitive move towards higher energy density batteries albemarle spokeswoman hailey cobb said
longer term albemarle is studying solid state batteries which contains no liquid and theoretically can store more electricity than the lithium ion battery norris told investors
while batteries are not expected to replace lithium ion batteries as the industry standard they are seen as a promising technological evolution
and importantly for albemarle they will consume even more lithium
so far wall street is rooting for albemarle s success
seventeen of the analysts that cover the stock recommend buying it
as an average that same group thinks the stock should be trading percent above current levels according to thomson reuters data
albemarle agrees and earlier this month said it would double its stock buyback for the year to million
the global lithium business is dominated by albemarle sqm tianqi and fmc corp which is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a publicly traded company
sqm has stated publicly a goal of supplanting albemarle as the world s biggest lithium producer by the next decade which albemarle says is not a concern
we are not interested in being the largest we are concerned about meeting the needs of our customers and being the most profitable lithium company in the world said hobb
but some on wall street are spooked with shares of albemarle down percent this year
lithium has become the centerpiece for the future of the company said chip skinner a portfolio manager with the royce funds which holds albemarle shares
but supply and demand still to help retain its crown the company is moving customers toward contracts of a decade or more far longer than the to contracts it currently signs
the contracts have an option to reset pricing every year in contrast to sqm which favors shorter contracts and typically charges spot market prices
albemarle also poached former general electric co battery scientist glen merfeld this spring and is hiring deputies for merfeld to help oversee the new battery center
norris told large investors that the shift to contracts which would have a base price guaranteed could be as long as a decade or more in some cases and secure albemarle s percent profit margins regardless of market forces
lithium is a business and albemarle is betting that brings it success in the said chris berry an independent energy metals analyst based in new york
