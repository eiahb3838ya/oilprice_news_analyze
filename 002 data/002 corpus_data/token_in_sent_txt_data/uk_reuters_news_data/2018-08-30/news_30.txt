update 3-kenya's parliament approves retaining interest rate cap, against imf wishes
nairobi reuters the kenyan parliament voted on thursday to retain the cap on commercial interest rates which the international monetary fund has insisted must be scrapped or modified in return for a new standby arrangement
in a response to emailed questions jan mikkelsen the imf s resident representative for kenya said they were aware of the passing of the finance bill and were currently assessing the implications for the program
kenyan lawmakers also voted to delay a proposed percent tax on petroleum products for two more years citing the high cost of living a move that will be a blow to government efforts to raise revenues through higher taxes
the rate cap introduced in september was aimed at helping small traders access capital at affordable rates but has had the opposite effect with banks saying they can not price risk to small and medium enterprises smes properly while the cap is in place
as a result lending to the private sector fell from percent in to percent last year
many thousands of kenyans have been unable to access bank lending and have turned to more expensive borrowing said aly khan satchu a independent trader and analyst
president uhuru kenyatta said in april that he recognised the limitation of the law and hoped that the finance bill would remove the cap that he said had ended up hurting the financial sector
the legislation still needs to secure presidential assent and it was not clear what line kenyatta would now take
the president will have to crack the whip and hard because notwithstanding some bravado chatter it would not make sense to lose the support of the imf at a time when the markets are so skittish and our ratio is nudging percent satchu said
some bank stocks at the nairobi securities exchange edged lower on thursday after the bill was passed
it was not widely expected people were banking on repeal of the interest cap said sheema shah equities dealer at apex africa
it s still a buy the current is temporary mostly it s the foreign investors who are heavy on that particular stock who are selling in june finance minister henry rotich proposed repealing the interest rate cap a move cheered by bankers
but lawmakers have continued to insist they are not ready to remove the upper limit of commercial lending rates at percentage points above the central bank rate
lawmakers did however remove the minimum deposit rate of percent of the central bank rate
the imf has demanded the cap be repealed as a condition for kenya to access its balance of payments support
kenya secured a extension for its credit arrangement of million from the fund in march and is seeking another extension when it expires in
jibran qureishi an economist for east africa at stanbic bank said the decision threw open the question of how discussions with the imf would now proceed
on the imf with the vat on fuel being postponed with most of the tax measures not approved this means the fiscal deficit is likely to remain higher than projected qureishi said
the odds of the imf facility being retained are quite slim but we have to see what will kenya s legislature also rejected a robin hood tax of percent on bank transfers of over shillings during thursday s session and an employee contribution scheme towards the national housing development fund
the rejected tax hikes were designed to fund a range of government development goals including universal healthcare and affordable housing
