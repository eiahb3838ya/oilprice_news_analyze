graphic china steel futures vs iron ore futures by clyde russell launceston australia aug reuters it s been a long time coming but chinese steel prices are finally showing signs of running out of steam with futures having dropped for six straight sessions
the shanghai futures exchange benchmark rebar contract closed at yuan a tonne on wednesday having retreated from the high of yuan a tonne reached on
the recent declines point to an increasing between still robust margins for steel makers and the likelihood of slowing demand growth in china which produces about half of the world s steel
steel futures gained about percent from the end of last year to their recent peak as chinese mills enjoyed some of the strongest profits in years
output curbs related to efforts to control pollution and the cutting of older less efficient capacity has boosted the industry s fortunes
improving profits have allowed steel mills to boost production by employing higher grade iron ore as a feedstock which has the added benefit of requiring less coking coal per unit of steel produced
the result has been record output with china producing a fourth straight monthly high in july of million tonnes according to official statistics
output to grew percent compared with the previous year to million tonnes as profit margins reached around yuan a tonne according to analysts from huatai futures
while it s logical to expect steel mills to maximise production when profit margins are elevated there is some concern as to where all the steel is going
the key construction sectors appear to still be enjoying strong activity but perhaps not enough to justify a percent increase in output
other sectors such as appliance and goods manufacturing and car making are in a similar position
exports of steel products have been trending lower this year with shipments of products in the first seven months of the year slipping percent to million tonnes
the escalating trade dispute with the united states and imposition of duties by other countries on chinese steel means exports are unlikely to return to growth any time soon
visible inventories have been largely steady in recent weeks but are still well down on levels earlier in the year with data from consultancy steelhome showing rebar stocks at million tonnes in the week to less than half the peak in early march
with mounting concern about a cooling in the chinese economy in the second half of the year the risk is rising that steel s stellar run must be coming to an end
this should also have a desultory effect on iron ore as well which has spent the past five months trading in a fairly narrow range
ore with a percent iron content the main benchmark ended at a tonne on wednesday according to prices assessed by argus media
this means the ingredient has lost about percent so far this year although it should be noted that higher grade ore has performed better
argus assessed percent iron ore at a tonne on wednesday which is up percent so far this year
iron ore has also declined more than the benchmark with consultancy custeel citing percent ore from india at a price of yuan a tonne on wednesday down percent from the end of last year
the outperformance of higher grade iron ore does confirm that china s steel mills have been using better quality ore to maximise output and lower emissions
but it is also the case that they have still been importing significant volumes of lower grade data compiled by thomson reuters shows that australia which supplies mainly percent and percent iron ore has managed to boost its share of china s imports to percent for the first eight months of the year compared with percent for the same period in
in contrast suppliers brazil and south africa both lost market share with the south american country dropping to percent from percent and south africa slipping to percent from percent
