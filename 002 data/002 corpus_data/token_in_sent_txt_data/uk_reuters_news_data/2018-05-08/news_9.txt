mnuchin speaking to reporters at a news briefing declined to identify countries which may add output saying there had been conversations with different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset this
so my expectation is not that oil prices will go higher to a certain extent some of this was already in the market on oil mnuchin said that licenses for boeing co and airbus to sell aircraft and components to iran will be revoked as a result of the reimposed sanctions on tehran
