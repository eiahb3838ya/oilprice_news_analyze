corrected-instant view 6-u.s. withdraws from iran deal
corrects title of brian larose s firm to may reuters the united states will withdraw from the iran nuclear pact negotiated in and sanctions it had previously withdrawn president donald trump said calling the deal defective at its core
stories oil oil prices initially slumped on conflicting headlines about president trump s intentions rebounded after trump s announcement at the end of the trading session and then sold off again to settle lower
stocks equities were volatile but remained modestly lower on the news held back by declines currencies the dollar pulled back against other major currencies on the news
comments matthew bolton pace university political science professor the decision to withdraw from the iran deal is truly irresponsible putting political posturing above human security
the iran nuclear deal made the world safer and less at risk of nuclear proliferation
the agreement cut off all the pathways to an iranian bomb
this plays into the hands of hardliners in iran who also want to scuttle the deal
it is a blow to america s credibility undercutting its capacity to persuade others that the us keeps its promises
the rest of the signatories of the iran deal iran china france germany russia the united kingdom and the eu should forge ahead with upholding the joe mcmonigle senior energy policy analyst hedgeeye potomac research washington it was very much as advertised
a lot of people were this and it became clear today that is not the case
he s very focused on the oil revenue to the regime
there are other sanctions that will go into effect as well and i think he spelled that out in his remarks as well
he indicated in the speech that countries that do business with iran will also be subject to sanctions
china dealing with a different currency could potentially escape some sanctions
but any country that wants to be doing business with the needs to think about sanctions
it s going to have a potential chilling effect in companies doing business with brian daingerfield macro strategist at natwest markets in stamford connecticut the market has been preparing in a sense for this announcement
the combination of the changeover in the president s team from secretary of state rex tillerson to mike pompeo and the appointment of john bolton was a signal to the market of the direction that the administration was going
you have seem some modest flight to quality though it hasn t been major
i think right now there s still quite a bit of uncertainty about the future of the deal even now that the has made its intentions clear
we do know that the european union has said they will continue to uphold the accord regardless of the decision
we need to know how iran will respond to this
there s still plenty up in the air
you could argue that president trump being open to negotiation of a better deal while also hanging the risk of sanctions over iran that if an agreement could still be reached a risky scenario could be eric nuttall partner and senior portfolio manager at ninepoint partners in toronto as an energy investor trump announced everything that one could possibly have wanted him to say
the term that he used was the highest level of sanctions we re obviously looking for the detail to this
but it gives one confidence that there could be a reduction in the physical movement of barrels and this also puts at stake the and growth ambitions of iran to grow their production and capacity
today s announcement gives energy bulls that much more confidence that the bull market for oil has even greater longevity for it
i think we re going to next year for wti
we see the inventories reaching a low by the end of this brian battle director of trading at performance trust capital partners in chicago this is a really telegraphed policy position so i don t think the market is surprised
the economic effects will be minimal
really this is a political story it s not a markets or an economic investors are also reacting to trump s tone he s not closed the door and shunned them
he wants a new deal
the door is open to try again which is probably less harsh than what he could have michael o rourke chief market strategist at jonestrading in greenwich connecticut there was so much of this leaked out there in the media
it doesn t seem to be much of a surprise to the market
the initial reaction was that defense names popped and rallied oil had rallied but they re giving back now as well
overall we haven t moved beyond the range we were trading jacques rousseau managing director of clearview energy in washington i think people are sorting through what could actually happen
is there actually any oil that s going to leave the market
it doesn t appear so in the
if you take a look at what s going on now iran ships about million barrels per day to asia
and that oil is unlikely to get changed at all
those buyers which are mainly china india and korea are unlikely to adjust their plans
the piece that could come into play is what goes to europe
about barrels a day goes to europe and so it depends on the level that europe is cooperating with trump
one important thing in all of this the oil in iran is very different to the oil in venezuela
one of the issues venezuela has is that their oil is very heavy and sour and so not many refiners in the world can actually process it
if for example the stops importing the oil from venezuela it s a little more difficult to find a home for it
whereas the oil from iran is medium quality so there s a lot more places it could if you look back on the last time sanctions came into effect the asian buyers did not cut back on their purchases
so now that s something that is unlikely to occur
there s definitely a lot of little ins and outs that could try and steer things in that direction in terms of whether cargoes would be insured there s a lot of pieces to the puzzle and i m not sure when exactly all of that is going to be put out
but it doesn t seem like there s going to be volumes affected in the near stephen massocca senior vice president wedbush securities san francisco it s difficult to see how going back to the old iranian sanctions without cooperation from major european countries will be effective
it might have an impact on oil pricing more than anything else but to the stock market i don t see a big move one way or the other
at the end of the day it s not that leo mariani energy specialist natalliance securities austin texas i do think that there is a good chance that iranian production will start to decline by and iran could lose roughly bopd over the next months
this should oil prices to continue to act well into and our oil price forecast is wti and michael purves chief global strategist head of equity derivatives strategy weeden co the big risk is a crude spike which trump doesn t want ahead of the midterms
does trump really want that from a political strategy point of view
so does he bark at then walk it back if oil prices go too high
but the secondary impact is that it drives up inflation which could lift bond yields blu putnam chief economist cme group chicago a pullout from the iran deal could lead china to buy more iranian oil over the long term in place of the excess shale oil it imports from the a pullout from the nuclear deal could raise gas prices at the pump with the possibility of forecasts for a gallon during the summer driving season stoking inflation
shale producers will decide on whether to increase production and hedge it based on futures prices six to months out which are now significantly lower than spot prices
energy etfs are influenced by this backwardation price daniel flynn energy analyst trader price futures group chicago everybody knows we re going to pull out of the nuclear deal
investors are going to be looking to see if our european allies are on board with us
i see us going higher
definitely going higher
unless we have a black swan event is not out of the chad morganlander portfolio manager washington crossing advisors florham park new jersey we ve already seen a within oil prices that has been quite violent so this on oil prices is basically buy the rumor sell on the news overall
that intraday move to positive territory in stocks investors should not take any special note of that
i really think the current administration rehearsed its signals in an effective manner the decision to pull out of the iran deal
so any type of intraday shift within the market is playing off of oil prices continuing to hit lower lows
it applies additional pressure to the overall sentiment of the market as the dollar continues to grind higher and treasury yields continue to move higher as well
that s the overall real driver of the market
the news out of iran hasn t surprised the system at michael antonelli managing director institutional sales trading robert baird milwaukee we re getting conflicting reports about the iran deal
cnn reported that trump would not withdraw but the new york times is reporting that he will withdraw
the market will struggle until we get clarity on this
the original report was that he would stay in the agreement and the market liked that because its less global tensions
then the ny times said he will withdraw so that brings back to the table the thought of global tensions with iran
we re just looking at iran today nothing else
we re all over the place
nobody knows what the right answer is right brian larose technical analyst new york i ve certainly seen reports early this morning suggesting that trump was going to walk away from the iran deal which pushed prices higher
then there was an article on cnn where they the thought then about an hour ago was that we were going to remain in the iran deal and there was the possibility of new sanctions
and all that information has kind of been jarring the market
but the reality is at this point we have not broken any key support levels in crude oil
so there s still an opportunity here that we could visit fresh highs on the day or on the week if something changes by o clock where the market interprets trump s decision as bullish
but if the dollar continues to rally from here regardless of what trump does with this iran deal any gains are going to be as the greatest risk here is the risk of the stan shipley strategist evercore isi new york trump is going to leave the deal but this is pretty well anticipated here
the market has priced this in pretty well here
there are still deals between iran with the europeans russia and china
does it cause iran more problem to move money around the world
yes
it is deal for the
it raises the risk that iran might forgo negotiations and go ahead with its nuclear reporting by stephanie kelly april joyner ayenat mersie megan davies sinead carew richard leong rodrigo campos
