exclusive-qatar petroleum ceo says pushing ahead with expansion despite gulf embargo
doha reuters state energy giant qatar petroleum will push ahead with its production expansion and foreign asset acquisition strategy to be on par with oil majors despite a regional political and economic embargo on doha its chief executive said
qp which produces million barrels of oil equivalent per day boed aims to boost its output to million boed in the next years and is expanding its upstream business abroad particularly in the united states ceo saad told reuters
qatar is one of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries smallest producers but is also one of the most influential players in the global liquefied natural gas lng market due to its annual production of million tonnes
we are in mexico we are in brazil we are contemplating investing in the in many areas in shale gas in conventional oil
we are looking at many things said in an interview at qp s headquarters in doha
we are looking very critically at the united states because we have a position there
we have the golden pass that we are investing in he said
qatar petroleum is the majority owner of the golden pass lng terminal in texas with exxon mobil corp and conocophillips holding smaller stakes
said depending on the project s cost and feasibility he expects to take a final investment decision on expanding the golden pass lng by the end of the year
i m not in the business of infrastructure
i m not going to have a liquefaction plant only
it has to be something that will be linked with an upstream business that we would buy in the so we need to be naturally hedged he added
to maintain its dominance in the united states and australia qp is cutting costs at home and seeking to expand overseas through joint ventures with international companies
we will always go with one of our international partners that we have business with here in qatar said
some of our partners want to divest some of our partners want to acquire something qp is focusing on other opportunities in mexico latin america africa and in the mediterranean he said
qp is also looking to enter mozambique where exxon and eni operate he added
said the share of overseas upstream production will be a good portion in the but it won t compare to its share at home
our strategy says we are going to expand in upstream business with a little bit of downstream that will be connected to some other businesses that we are doing and a few deals in petrochemicals he said
for qatar which is locked in a dispute with four arab states broadening its investments outside the middle east would cement its position as the world s largest lng supplier and help it to weather the boycott with its neighbours
in june last year saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain and egypt cut diplomatic economic and transport ties with qatar accusing it of backing terrorism a charge which doha denies
in an apparent show of strength a month later qp announced plans to raise lng production capacity by percent to million tonnes per year
qatar has lifted a ban on the development of the north field the world s biggest natural gas field which it shares with iran in april last year and announced a new project to develop its southern section increasing output in five to seven years
the announcement came at a time of an oversupply in the lng market but said such a glut would disappear in driven by the rising demand for gas amid the global move towards cleaner fuels and climate change concerns
qp has selected japan s chiyoda corp for the engineering and design feed of the onshore facilities of the north field expansion project and awarded mcdermott a contract for the offshore engineering work said
qp has abandoned plans to debottleneck its existing liquefaction trains because it involved shutdowns and prompted safety concerns and opted to build three new lng trains he said
stay tuned said when asked if qp s announcement that the award to chiyoda included a for a fourth train as had been announced
if qp decided to build a fourth train that could mean possibly expanding gas production beyond million tonnes per year
said qp will award the engineering procurement and construction epc contract for the first lng train by the end of next year with its set for the end of
qp is in talks with international oil companies for the new expansion project
oil companies operating in qatar now include exxon total and royal dutch shell
qp will make a decision on the foreign partners by the end of said
there are some new companies that have come and put forward some proposals but i don t see the face of what we are doing and the companies that we have changing reporting by rania el gamal and dmitry zhdannikov editing by louise heavens
