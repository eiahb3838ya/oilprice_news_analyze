update 2-southern california natgas supply could fall short, utility warns
adds more comment from company paragraph by scott disavino may reuters southern california gas socalgas cautioned on tuesday that pipeline outages and restrictions on the aliso canyon gas storage facility could reduce its ability to deliver natural gas this year to a level even lower than california state regulators and others have predicted
on monday regulators power companies and grid operators issued a technical report warning of a moderate threat to gas and electric reliability this summer and a more serious threat next winter
we remain concerned that some of the assumptions made in the technical assessment are overly optimistic socalgas spokesman chris gilbride said in an email
socalgas is a unit of california energy company sempra energy
the socalgas system has been operating at less than full capacity because of the pipeline outages and restrictions on the use of aliso canyon the utility s biggest storage field which suffered a devastating leak between october and february
the potential for additional pipeline outages means that the situation may be getting worse not better the aliso canyon technical assessment group said in a report released monday noting socalgas avoided serious problems last winter due to unusually warm weather
with so many pipeline outages it will be difficult for socalgas to fill storage to a level sufficient to ensure energy reliability throughout the coming winter the group said
socalgas gilbride said that service reductions or interruptions to electric generators may be necessary this summer and withdrawals from aliso canyon may be required to prevent more extensive customer socalgas wants the state to lift some of the restrictions that were imposed on aliso canyon after the leak which forced the evacuation of residents form a nearby los angeles neighborhood
the state has limited the amount of gas socalgas can inject into the cubic feet aliso canyon to just bcf and only allows the utility to pull fuel from the field when other options are not available
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about five million homes for a day
to avoid power and gas interruptions this summer and next winter the technical group recommended socalgas import liquefied natural gas from costa azul in mexico and that state regulators allow the utility to boost the capacity and use of aliso canyon
the report said this summer s challenges stem primarily from continuing outages and reductions on key pipelines including lines and and
the group projected capacity on socalgas system would total billion cubic feet per day bcfd this summer which includes bcfd from pipelines and bcfd from storage
that is lower than the bcfd available without aliso canyon last summer and well below the bcfd maximum the system could send out without aliso canyon if all pipelines were available the group has previously forecast
this summer s projected system capacity is just enough to cover forecast peak demand of bcfd the report said warning higher gas usage or loss of additional pipelines could result in curtailments of the fuel to electric generators
