brent futures nevertheless eased one percent after hitting new highs above a barrel and msci s world equity index hovered around flat after two days of gains having touched highs in the previous session
trump s decision has been so well covered it s probably all in the price by now
and most recent commentary seems to be that after all the bluster he may only partially withdraw from the deal said frances hudson global thematic strategist at aberdeen standard investments
