newsmaker-saad al-kaabi: keeping qatar's gas flowing under gulf boycott
engineer rose through ranks to top job ceo brushes off boycott as business stress test aims to keep qatar s no
lng exporter ranking by rania el gamal and dmitry zhdannikov doha may reuters when qatar s gulf neighbours and egypt sought to isolate doha with a boycott imposed last year the nation s top energy official kept a cool head and ensured oil and gas exports barely felt a hiccup
saad a engineer who rose the ranks to become chief executive of qatar petroleum qp in had a contingency plan to hand to maintain energy flows that account for percent of the arab nation s state revenues
it was the best stress test we can have for our system to show whether we are really up for a challenge said in a reuters interview in doha brushing of the boycott s impact
when the blockade happened we had a business continuity plan in every company he said in his simply furnished first floor office in the capital of a nation that has become the world s wealthiest per capita because of its huge gas reserves
his understated office layout gives little indication that is one of qatar s most powerful figures a man who is not a member of the ruling family but who has nonetheless climbed to one of the country s top jobs
he has gained a reputation among executives of the world s energy majors such as exxon shell and total as a reliable counterpart for energy projects that have made the tiny nation of million people the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas lng on the planet
qp has been a top partner for many years and saad made it even more solid said an executive at one of the three majors
his steady hand proved critical when neighbours saudi arabia the united arab emirates and bahrain alongside egypt severed diplomatic economic and transport ties in june accusing doha of supporting terrorism charges qatar denies
the boycott came as a particular surprise given had been in talks months earlier to supply gas to saudi arabia and increase supplies to uae
qatar has continued pumping gas to uae under existing deals despite the boycott
undeterred by sanctions announced a plan on july to produce million tonnes of lng a year equivalent to a third of current global supplies in the next five to seven years
who said his business strategy was driven by commercial factors not politics said the boycott meant qatar would no longer consider pipelines for gas exports
basically the decision was if this is what they are doing to us i am just going to go full lng and never think of pipeline supplies in the future said he added that if things go back to normal in the future qatar s neighbours could buy lng rather than piped gas
s restructuring of qp one of the world s biggest energy firms with a daily output of million barrels of oil equivalent had also put the company on a better footing to manage the challenge of the boycott although the initial catalyst for corporate changes was the low price of oil
crude plunged from above a barrel in to below in prompting and other industry executives to focus on cutting costs and tightening up a corporate structures that had expanded in the oil boom years
my vision is to focus on our core business and get out of anything that is not core business he said
a lot of people talked about downsizing i was trying to rightsize qp integrated qatar petroleum international which had been formed in as a wholly owned foreign investment arm and tasweeq its marketing arm
he also merged two lng producers qatargas and rasgas
said qp s operating costs would be billion qatar riyals billion a year lower due to the restructuring which included cutting as many as jobs to create a more streamlined operation
responding to the boycott qp also said it would set up a fuel oil bunkering business in qatar after ships heading to qatar were banned from using the uae s fujairah bunkering hub
who joined qp in after graduating from pennsylvania state university is also chairman of qatar s petrochemicals metals and fertiliser industries and he sits on the board of qatar investment authority the world s ninth largest sovereign wealth fund with about billion in assets
before becoming qp s ceo he had worked in the reservoir and field development department and then becoming manager of gas development for the north field the huge gas reservoir that qatar shares with iran on the other side of the gulf
s vision to develop lng production beyond qatar s borders remains undimmed
we are not just going to be in qatar he said
we are always going to strive to be the number one lng producer in the world for a very long qatar riyals editing by edmund blair
