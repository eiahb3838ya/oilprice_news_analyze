update 3-uk regulator probes sse, npower merger due to price concerns
london reuters british regulators have launched an investigation into the between the retail power unit of sse plc and npower owned by germany s innogy saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households
the merger would create britain s retail power provider and reduce the big six dominating the market to five companies when they are already facing political scrutiny for their tariffs and pressure from smaller rivals
it also comes as german energy giants rwe and plan to carve up innogy
the deal would make another of the big six the parent company of npower
analysts say this may complicate the merger
the competition and markets authority cma warned at the end of april it would launch a deeper probe which typically lasts weeks and can be extended unless the two companies propose solutions that would lift its concerns
sse and npower did not offer measures to address the cma s concerns and so it has referred the merger for a more phase investigation the regulator said in a statement
the deadline for the final report is combined sse and npower would have million customers making the new company second only to centrica s british gas which has more than million customer accounts
chief financial officer marc spieker said he expected the deal to go ahead but should it be blocked s own plans for a larger asset swap with innogy s parent company rwe would not be affected
even before the announcement of the merger last november the industry had faced criticism as household bills doubled over the past decade despite years of market liberalization that was meant to make energy more affordable
last month the influential business energy and industrial strategy committee of lawmakers said the deal could damage competition and would reduce consumer choices
they had already called the energy market broken
on tuesday however the two parent companies disagreed
we did not put forward measures to address the cma s concerns because we firmly believe this merger will be good for competition as it stands innogy said in an emailed statement
it will create an independent company offering customers a more efficient improved service and bring benefits to the wider market as sse said it was on track to complete the formation and listing of the new company in the last quarter of or first quarter of despite the investigation
a phase referral is a process for transactions of this nature and we remain confident that the proposed merger will deliver benefits for customers and the energy market as a whole sse chief executive alistair said in a statement
the british market is dominated by british gas sse iberdrola s scottish power npower and edf energy which account for about percent of the retail electricity market
but those six companies held percent of the market share just three years ago and have shed customers to much smaller rivals increasing pressure on their revenues
additionally the government plans to impose price caps on the most common tariff from these companies the standard variable tariff by the winter of this year to tackle what prime minister theresa may called prices
