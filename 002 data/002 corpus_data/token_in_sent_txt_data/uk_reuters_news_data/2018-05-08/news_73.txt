update 1-uniper denies trying to undermine fortum stake purchase
reuters germany s uniper denied on tuesday trying to undermine a deal that will make finnish utility fortum its top investor and said it had been open and transparent during the process
fortum last year agreed to buy a percent stake in energy group uniper from for billion euros billion despite opposition from uniper s management which has argued the two companies are not a good fit
last month fortum won approval from a government commission in russia to buy up to percent in uniper marking a key step in getting the deal done but fortum also said uniper s management had actively worked against the deal there
we ve done nothing wrong uniper ceo klaus schaefer told analysts during a call to discuss results adding the company s behavior had been open and transparent with regard to both fortum and russian officials
in view of the situation after the decision in russia which is tolerable for both sides i m not quite seeing why fortum appears to be somewhat annoyed schaefer added
a fortum spokeswoman said the company stood by its previous accusations but declined to comment further
it expects to get final regulatory clearances for the acquisition by the middle of the year
uniper shareholder cornwall luxembourg which schaefer says is backed by activist investor elliott management will propose appointing a special auditor at uniper s annual general meeting on june to identify possible breaches of duty and violations of the law by members of the management board
fortum said it had nothing to do with that motion
uniper has advertised in finnish newspapers arguing against the transaction
it is being advised by morgan stanley and rothschild on the deal sources have told reuters
