imf warns of rising african debt despite faster economic growth
pace of growth though faster in is expected to plateau growing number of countries in debt distress or at risk of it african governments increasingly tapping global debt markets by kwasi kpodo accra may reuters african nations are at growing risk of debt distress because of heavy borrowing and gaping deficits despite an overall uptick in economic growth the international monetary fund warned on tuesday
the sober assessment comes as african countries continue to tap international debt markets and issue record levels of debt in foreign currencies spurred on by insatiable investor demand for yields
in its economic outlook for the region released in accra ghana the fund projected the rate of economic expansion would rise to percent this year up from percent in boosted by global growth and higher commodity prices
slower growth in south africa and nigeria the continent s two largest economies weighed on the average but the imf expects growth to pick up in around of african nations
however under current policies that rate is expected to plateau below percent over the medium term
meanwhile around percent of countries in the region are now in debt distress or at high risk of it the imf said
and refinancing that debt could soon become more costly
the current growth spurt in advanced economies is expected to taper off and the borrowing terms for the region s frontier markets will likely become less favourable which could coincide with higher refinancing needs for many countries across the region it said
african governments issued a record billion in sovereign bonds last year times more than in
and they have issued or plan to issue over billion in additional debt in the first half of alone the report said
foreign currency debt increased by percent from to and now accounts for about percent of the region s total public debt on average imf data showed
average interest payments meanwhile increased from percent of expenditures in to percent in
six countries chad eritrea mozambique congo republic south sudan and zimbabwe were judged to be in debt distress at the end of last year
and the imf s ratings for zambia and ethiopia were changed from moderate to high risk of debt the imf conceded that africa s enormous needs will continue to demand heavy investments to build infrastructure and social development
but to do so while avoiding the risk of a debt trap the continent which currently has the lowest ratio in the world will need to become more
with debt vulnerabilities rising in the region african countries will need to further rely on sustainable sources of financing making domestic revenue mobilisation one of the most urgent policy challenges for the region it said
