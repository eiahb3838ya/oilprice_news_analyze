factbox-a year from the bomb: iran deal's nuclear restrictions
vienna may reuters the fate of the landmark nuclear deal signed by iran and six major powers in july hangs in the balance ahead of an announcement by president donald trump due on tuesday at gmt
european officials said trump is expected to announce that he is pulling out of the agreement
below are some key restrictions that the deal officially called the joint comprehensive plan of action imposes on iran s nuclear activities
those restrictions are policed by the nuclear watchdog the international atomic energy agency
the biggest obstacle to building a nuclear weapon is obtaining enough fissile material highly enriched uranium or plutonium for the core of the bomb
a central aim of the deal was to extend the time iran would need to do that if it chose to to a year from about months
the jcpoa which took effect in january cuts off the plutonium track while severely restricting uranium enrichment
iran was building a reactor at arak that could eventually have produced spent fuel from which plutonium could be separated
under the jcpoa the core of that reactor has been removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable the reactor is being redesigned so as to minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce plutonium in normal operation
all spent fuel from arak will be shipped out of iran
for the reactor s lifetime iran commits not to engage in reprocessing or reprocessing research activities
for years iran has two vast enrichment sites at natanz and fordow
much of natanz is deep underground and fordow is buried inside a mountain which is widely believed to protect them from aerial bombardment
the deal allows iran to continue enrichment at natanz but with a series of constraints
it turns fordow into a nuclear physics and technology centre where centrifuges are used for purposes other than enrichment like producing stable isotopes here the jcpoa slashes the number of centrifuges installed in iran to roughly from around before the deal here
for years though a centrifuge cap at fordow remains in place for years caps at percent the purity to which iran can enrich uranium far below the roughly percent threshold of
before the deal it enriched uranium to up to percent purity
for years restricts iran s stock of uranium to kg or technically kg of uranium hexafluoride the gas that is fed into centrifuges
iran produced more than tonnes of enriched before the deal
for years bans enrichment and nuclear material from fordow
for years only allows iran to enrich uranium with its centrifuges
for years lets iran carry out research with small numbers of more advanced centrifuges but without accumulating enriched uranium
the text of the deal also requires iran to provisionally apply the iaea additional protocol which grants the agency inspection powers and subsequently seek ratification and entry into force
for more on inspections click on grants nuclear inspectors daily access to natanz and fordow for years says the deal s signatories must vet iran s purchases of nuclear or equipment bans iran from carrying out a range of activities that could contribute to making a nuclear bomb such as computer simulations of a nuclear explosion or designing certain detonation systems
in some cases those activities can be carried out with the other signatories approval
