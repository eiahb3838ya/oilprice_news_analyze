germany's merkel sees chance for electric car battery production in europe
berlin reuters german chancellor angela merkel signalled on tuesday that she thought the chances were increasing of german carmakers building up battery production for electric cars in europe
europe has no significant production of the constituent cells of battery packs a market currently dominated by a handful of firms including china s catl and korean rivals lg chem and samsung
i m detecting a certain rethink among carmakers merkel said at an event in berlin hosted by the national academy of science and engineering known as acatech
she said she backed a call from henning kagermann the academy s outgoing president who said europe needed such battery production
merkel argued that battery production would form a significant part of the chain for electric cars so if europe lacked a battery industry it would have a smaller share in the chain of the car industry in future
she said it might still be possible to achieve something in europe in this field but added that businesses would need to be willing
merkel said she was in favour of doing more for germany as a research location and boosting innovation there
she pointed to the government s intention to raise the proportion of research and development spending in germany to percent of economic output by adding that the automobile industry played an important role in that
last month economy minister peter altmaier said the german government was ready to offer support to the makers of batteries for electric vehicles adding that one possibility might be to exempt them from some energy levies
truckmaker scania said in january it would invest million euros in a billion euro billion pounds project to build europe s biggest battery cell plant in northern sweden
