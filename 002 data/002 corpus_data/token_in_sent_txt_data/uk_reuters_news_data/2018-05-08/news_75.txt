president donald trump will announce at gmt whether washington will withdraw from a deal that eased economic sanctions on iran in exchange for tehran limiting its nuclear programme
a decision to leave the accord could give another boost to this year s percent oil rally by constraining iranian crude exports
brent futures nevertheless eased percent after hitting new highs above a barrel and msci s world equity index inched a touch higher after two days of gains and having touched highs in the previous session
