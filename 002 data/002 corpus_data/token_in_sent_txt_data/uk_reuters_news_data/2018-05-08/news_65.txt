german energy regulator says new renewable targets create grid challenges
bonn germany reuters germany must build new power transmission lines if it wants to nearly double its renewable energy share by a challenge given that grid expansion is already behind target the head of the federal network regulator said on tuesday
there is a simple correlation the more volatile renewables there are the more the grids will have to be expanded said jochen homann president of the bundesnetzagentur responsible for keeping the lights on in europe s biggest economy
germany aims to raise wind and solar power s energy share from a third now to percent by to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments in line with the wishes of the new coalition government
before these goals were set the bundesnetzagentur or federal network agency had made plans based on a renewable share of percent by homann told a news conference
now we re dealing with significantly more he said
germany is set to quit nuclear power by losing megawatts mw of reliable capacity between and then
while germany s renewable power capacity of around mw can theoretically meet percent of demand under favourable weather conditions the problem is that if the weather turns there can be next to no green power
bundesnetzagentur data show that of some kms miles of additional grids and power line improvements planned to accommodate the rise of renewable installations in the next decade only km have been approved and km have been implemented
the picture for plans up to is a bit more favourable
power network operators overseen by the authority expect that around percent of the km of new lines due to be completed by that date can be achieved
even if digitalisation meant that existing networks could be better tapped as unused resources could be better allocated this must not come at the expense of security homann said
transmission grid firms dependent on weather patterns reduce or add power capacity to grids to keep supply stable
costs for such measures have been exploding due to the volatile nature of renewables posing a burden for consumers who share these as part of their final bills
last year should have seen another rise to above billion euros million pounds in these costs after was below and those in above that figure homann said
to ensure grid stability next winter the authority said last week it foresees network reserve needs of mw well down from mw in the winter just past
this is because germany s and austria s power market zones will be split from october allowing for lower costs and fewer technical risks in power flows
