update 1-u.s. refiners reap big rewards from epa biofuel waivers
new york reuters the environmental protection agency s expanded use of waivers to free small refineries from the nation s biofuels law has saved the industry as a whole hundreds of millions of dollars according to a reuters review of public filings
dozens of refineries have received the financial hardship waivers from epa in recent months meaning they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits known as rins
they can also sell any rins they have on hand into the market which helps other refiners by cutting market prices
savings for the refining industry represent a win for president donald trump whose administration has been under pressure from valero energy corp pbf energy and others to overhaul the renewable fuel standard rfs to cut compliance costs
but the increase in waivers has incensed the corn lobby which claims trump s epa is undermining demand for biofuels such as ethanol
the rfs was intended to help farmers by requiring refiners to add more biofuels into gasoline and diesel supplies
the epa has said it has handed out more than two dozen waivers in recent months to refineries that have demonstrated complying with the rfs would cause them disproportionate economic that is a big increase according to former officials who said the epa has tended to grant fewer than discretionary waivers a year since the program began in
expansion of the waiver program is due in part to a federal court decision last year that said the epa had been too stingy with exemptions
but ethanol groups and their legislative backers have complained epa has gone too far expanding a program that was never meant to benefit oil companies
one group recently asked a federal judge to determine whether the program expansion was legal
andeavor which sources told reuters has secured waivers for some of its refineries said on monday it saved million in biofuels compliance costs for and
a company spokesman declined to comment when asked if the savings were related to waivers
cvr refining controlled by billionaire trump ally carl icahn reported a rare million profit in the biofuels credit market in the first quarter
sources told reuters its oklahoma facility was recently granted an exemption
the company also said in a recent earnings call that it expects its cost of complying with rfs requirements in to fall to million from a previous estimate of million and from roughly million in
delek holdings reported compliance savings of million while hollyfrontier said it saved million
those companies confirmed they received waivers from epa
epa does not disclose the recipients of waivers saying the information is business sensitive
refiners that did not get waivers are also posting savings as rin prices have dropped more than percent since late last year to lows around cents apiece according to traders
pbf energy and valero do not have refineries small enough to qualify for waivers but they still are forecasting huge savings in compliance costs
valero the largest refiner said it now expects million on compliance credits this year
that is down sharply from its april forecast of up to million and far lower than the million spent on compliance credits last year according to filings
pbf energy expects to spend million this year half of what it spent in ceo tom nimbley told investors last week
small refinery waivers granted by the epa have had the effect of lowering rins prices and thereby reducing a significant headwind for our business nimbley said
