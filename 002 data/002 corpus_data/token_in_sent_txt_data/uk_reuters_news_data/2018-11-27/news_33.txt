finance for climate action rising, but still 'far to go' - analysts
barcelona nov thomson reuters foundation investment to tackle climate change is increasing around the world but remains far too low to limit global warming and avoid its most harmful consequences as governments have committed to do analysts said on tuesday
a report from the climate policy initiative cpi an international think tank said initial estimates for global flows of climate finance in ranged from about billion to billion a to percent increase from
updated figures for and based on new data becoming available showed an annual average flow of billion which was percent higher than in
cpi said the early figures for reflected rising investment in electric vehicles and funding from development banks
renewable energy investment held steady after dropping percent in on falling costs and fewer projects
but climate finance is still only a small share of what will be needed to decarbonise economies in the coming decades as governments vowed to do in the paris agreement it noted
governments will meet in poland to work out rules for putting that accord into practice
unfortunately we still have far to go said barbara buchner cpi s executive director for climate finance
leaders need to urgently continue and ramp up the progress toward the transition needed to address climate change she added in a statement
the cpi report noted the particularly sparse resources allocated for adapting to wilder weather and rising seas as the planet heats up
total adaptation finance all from government sources was only billion per year in it said
with the world already struggling with more destructive wildfires storms droughts and floods that spending is extremely low compared to the need which un environment has estimated at billion per year
investment in adaptation is hard to track but if included the overall amount for adaptation could be much higher the cpi report noted
lead author padraig oliver said corporations and investors were under growing pressure to manage climate change risks
the impacts are happening now and it is an issue that is far more front and centre for businesses and their bottom line than three to four years ago he told the thomson reuters foundation
ahead of the annual climate conference figures published last friday showed rich countries were on track to meet a goal of raising billion a year by to help poor nations go green and cope with climate shifts analysts said
that report said total climate finance increased percent between and reaching billion in
the cpi figures feed into the assessment but do not include international energy agency estimates of investment in energy efficiency which is why they are lower oliver said
the cpi report highlighted a jump in investment in electric vehicles around the world
between and that rose percent each year on average to reach billion in
policies to promote sustainable transport are propelling investment and it will likely continue rising oliver said
