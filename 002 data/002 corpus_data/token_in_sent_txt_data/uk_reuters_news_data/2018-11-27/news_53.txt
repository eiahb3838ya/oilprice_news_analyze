wave of refinery shutdowns may push india into importing fuel next year
new nov reuters a wave of shutdowns will hit indian refineries next year as the country prepares for cleaner fuels from april company officials said in moves that could temporarily dent oil demand and push up imports of refined fuels
india the world s oil importer and consumer has surplus refining capacity and rarely imports gasoil and gasoline
it also means that demand for fuel produced by india s privately owned refiners will likely climb during the period as state refiners seek to fill the gap
state refiners indian oil corp bharat petroleum hindustan petroleum and mangalore refinery and petrochemicals account for about percent of the country s nearly million barrels per day bpd capacity
the refiners will have to shut and units at their plants for to days to churn out euro fuels from january to be able to sell them from april of that year
next year will be challenging for us as i have to protect my crude throughput and finish the job at the refineries and get ready for euro vi by april said rama gopal head of refineries at ioc the country s top refiner
ioc plans a roughly shutdown of and units at all of its refineries he told reuters
key parts of the refineries requiring a revamp include naphtha hydrotreaters catalytic reforming units isomerisation units diesel sulphurisers and diesel hydrotreaters
in addition some refiners have to revamp or set up new gasoline treaters hydrogen production and sulphur recovery units
india has been gradually reducing sulphur emissions from vehicles since when fuel sold in the country had parts per million ppm
motorists in delhi which faces major air pollution moved in april this year to standards which allow up to ppm sulphur and are known locally as bharat
hpcl will shut its diesel and gasoline units while upgrading the crude units at its vizag and mumbai refineries for to days its chairman surana said
he forecast a slight reduction in the company s crude intake
we will take the shutdown in one shot so we don t have multiple disruptions surana said
surana and mrpl managing director venkatesh who intends to shut some refinery units for up to a month said they see no need to import fuel in given that state fuel retailers can access robust production at local private refiners
their view is challenged by analysts who estimate weaker gasoil and gasoline prices would prompt state refiners to import auto fuel instead of going to private peers who levy coastal freight charges on top of normal prices
a similar phenomenon was witnessed when india migrated to euro iv fuel in phases to april said sri paravaikkarasu head of east of suez oil for consultants fge in singapore
there is a high possibility that the lengthy shutdown period could result in a shortage of current euro iv products in the domestic market
in such an event indian nocs national oil companies should turn to the international market for product purchases she said
fge expects india could import bpd of gasoline and bpd of gasoil for about one quarter in because of the shutdowns
bpcl india s state refiner has upgraded two of its refineries to fuels and is revamping the hydrocracker at its mumbai refinery so it can produce cleaner diesel its head of refineries ramachandran said
bpcl plans to shut a crude unit and some other secondary units at the mumbai refinery for maintenance and upgrades next year for days to produce cleaner fuels
ramachandran said there could be a need to import some additional cargoes but it will not be a major hiccup
the shutdowns will be spaced out in a manner to ensure there is enough product in the market
it will be a exercise he said
