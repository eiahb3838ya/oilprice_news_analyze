update 3-edf restructuring expected as france reduces reliance on nuclear
paris reuters france is considering restructuring utility edf and plans a steady reduction to the country s reliance on nuclear power the government said on tuesday
in a speech on energy strategy president emmanuel macron said france would reduce the share of nuclear in the power mix to percent by down from percent today rather than the total phasing out planned by neighbour germany
the fate of edf long a symbol of french industrial might and a world leader in nuclear technology is a politically sensitive issue in france
it has already led to the resignation of macron s former ecology minister nicolas hulot who accused the president of dragging his feet on nuclear power
i was not elected on a promise to exit nuclear power but to reduce the share of nuclear in our energy mix to percent macron said in an address adding that of edf s nuclear reactors would be closed by
edf shares fell up to percent on news of the plans which a source close to the president s office said could involve the state increasing its stake in the company
by gmt the shares were down percent
macron s action plan is broadly in line with edf s desire not to close any reactors before besides the previously scheduled closure of fessenheim s two reactors near the german border
no further closures are planned before the end of macron s term in another two will be shut down over and a further two could face closure as early as if there is no risk of jeopardising france s power supply
in his election campaign macron promised to stick to the former socialist government s target of reducing the share of nuclear to percent by
but he rowed back on the pledge a few months after taking office angering environmentalists
as france reduces its dependence on nuclear energy edf is wooing overseas markets with the epr model of reactor it is building at hinkley point britain s first new plant in decades
macron said the schedule for shutting down reactors would depend on the evolution of france s energy mix including the planned increase of renewable energy and the expansion of interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries
it is a pragmatic approach which takes into account security of supply he said
an elysee note on the strategy said the closures would focus on the oldest reactors including at the tricastin bugey gravelines and chinon plants
it also said that to limit job losses no sites would be closed completely
macron did not mention a possible edf restructuring but the elysee note said the state could raise its percent stake
the state will consider boosting its stake in the capital of the company in line with the challenges and risks linked to the nuclear activity the note said
ecology minister francois de rugy told a news conference that edf s structure was not necessarily the most efficient in the long run
we want edf to remain an integrated group
there could be a parent company and subsidiaries he said
financial markets have long speculated that edf s nuclear activities could be put into a separate legal structure and renationalised which would allow the state to subsidise the business and make nuclear energy available to edf as well as its competitors
several of edf s major business activities are already operating as separate legal units such as power grid operators rte and enedis as well as its renewable energy division
greenpeace said that macron had fallen prey to corporate interests
for the umpteenth time the government has caved in to the nuclear industry lobby said alix mazounie head of greenpeace france s nuclear campaign
