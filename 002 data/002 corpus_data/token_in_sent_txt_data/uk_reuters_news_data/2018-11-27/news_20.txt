update 2-russia's yamal set to send 160 tankers of lng via norway - port
adds quote from local mayor number of vessels production implications novatek trading strategy by lefteris karagiannopoulos oslo nov reuters yamal one of the world s largest liquefied natural gas lng terminals in arctic russia is expected to export as much as million tonnes of lng in the next seven months through norway according to the port hosting its operations and reuters calculations
the in output puts the novatek terminal in operation for less than a year in excess of its nameplate capacity with the norwegian transfers the only way it can deliver the additional lng to the market
yamal uses lng tankers to carry the gas through the barents sea these vessels then transfer the cargo to more conventional tankers in europe enabling them to return sooner to the facility and pick up more supplies
these transfers began in honningsvag norway last week cutting the journey time to the previous transfer points in france belgium and the netherlands by at least kilometres and freeing up the arctic tankers sooner
now the local mayor of the tiny port on the tip of norway says up to transfers are expected until the end of june
between and transfers will take place in the port s fjord from november to june local mayor kristina sigursdottir hansen told reuters
ships will be coming with gas from russia from yamal more than ships actually will be involved the yamal tankers in operation carry about cubic metres or tonnes of lng per load according to refinitiv eikon shipping data making the volume expected to be involved in the transfers at million tonnes until june
that puts yamal s output in the first six months of at million tonnes on track to exceed the facilities nameplate capacity of million tonnes a year
novatek said last week its third train or plant has begun operations
it did not respond to a request for comment on tuesday
the transfer operations in norway come just as lower asian lng prices together with high shipping costs have closed an arbitrage with asia and increased deliveries into europe
a novatek company source said earlier this month it expected these dynamics to continue until
it has been in the market this month arranging cargo swaps between the pacific and atlantic basins to reduce its shipping costs to asia buying at least one cargo in the pacific for december delivery
it was looking to arrange around three swap deals for this winter according to the source
norway s tschudi shipping facilitates the transfers its chief executive jon edvard sundnes said confirming that there was a contract until june
he would not comment on the number of transfers
jan morten hansen regional director for the norwegian coastal administration said that is what tschudi told us when asked whether up to transfers would take place
four locations around honningsvag can host the transfers and three operations are allowed to run simultaneously he said
