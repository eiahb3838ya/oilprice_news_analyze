update 1-epa will not reallocate waived biofuel volumes to 2019 mandate -official
washington reuters the environmental protection agency epa has rejected requests from the corn lobby to reallocate biofuel volumes waived under its small refinery exemption programme into its mandate an agency official told reuters on tuesday
the official also said the biofuel mandate figures due to be released this week would be largely in line with the agency s june proposal of billion gallons which includes billion gallons of convention biofuels like ethanol
the powerful corn lobby and top officials in the department of agriculture have complained for months that the trump administration s expansion of the epa refinery waiver programme threatens demand for crucial farm products like ethanol
under the renewable fuel standard oil refiners must blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do
small refineries can be exempted from the rfs if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain
it is an issue of timing said the epa official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue
the primary reason why we re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of sres small refinery exemptions will be for calendar and we won t know that late early
all we could do is guess and we don t do regulations by guessing the refinery waiver programme is among the most controversial issues dividing the corn lobby and the oil industry
since president donald trump s election the epa has vastly expanded the number of waivers it has handed out to small refineries in a bid to reduce the refining industry s regulatory compliance costs
the move has infuriated another key trump constituency the farmbelt which argues the programme erodes demand for biofuels
under pressure the epa earlier this year began studying a potential overhaul in which biofuels blending obligations eliminated under the waiver programme would be reallocated possibly in the following year to other facilities to ensure there was no net loss in overall blending volumes
we would like to make everybody happy
it is not often the case we can the epa official said
the epa is set to formally announce its biofuels mandate volumes by
