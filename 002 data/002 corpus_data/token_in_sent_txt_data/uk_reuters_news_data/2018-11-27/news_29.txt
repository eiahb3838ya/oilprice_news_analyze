greenhouse gas emissions gap wider than ever -u.n. report
paris reuters global greenhouse gas emissions in could be between billion and billion tonnes more than the level needed to keep global warming within degrees celsius this century a united nations report estimated on tuesday
the ninth annual
environment programme unep report analyzed the impact of countries emissions cut targets and policies and whether they are enough to limit global average temperature rise to a safer threshold below
the assessment comes a few days before a climate conference starts in poland from
the talks will produce a rule book on how to implement the paris agreement which aims limit the rise in global temperatures to between and degrees celsius
unep said annual greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of billion tonnes in after three years of decreases
they are not seen peaking by let alone by
however emissions in will need to be around percent and percent lower than last year to put the world on track to limit global warming to degrees and degrees celsius respectively the report said
increased emissions and lagging action means the gap figure for this year s report is larger than ever the report said
current climate policies are seen lowering emissions by up to billion tonnes by implying global warming of around by with warming continuing afterwards
if the emissions gap is not closed by it is very plausible that the goal of a well below temperature rise increase is also out of reach the report said
to keep warming below countries must triple their current efforts
for the more ambitious target of countries must raise ambitions by five times
currently the world s biggest economies the are collectively not on track to meet their pledges unep said
analysis and review of progress against pledges from countries to reduce their emissions under the paris agreement nationally determined contributions ndcs showed they were insufficient
added impetus came last month in a report by the s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which said that keeping the earth s temperature rise to degrees celsius would require rapid and unprecedented changes
if the ipcc report represented a global fire alarm this report is the arson investigation unep deputy executive director joyce msuya said in a statement
the science is clear for all the ambitious climate action we have seen governments need to move faster and with greater urgency
we are feeding this fire while the means to extinguish it are within reach he added
institutions such as city state and regional governments companies investors higher education and civil society organizations are increasingly committing to climate action and are an important element in achieving global emissions goals
although estimates on the emissions reduction potential vary some billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent could be reduced by their actions by
this would be enough to close the gap the report said
