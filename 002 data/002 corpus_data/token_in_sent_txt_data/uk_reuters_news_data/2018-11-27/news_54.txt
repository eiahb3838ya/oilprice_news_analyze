international markets are taking note with prices for australian thermal coal cargoes for prompt loading from its newcastle terminal falling this week below per tonne for the first time since may
china has in the past imposed coal import restrictions which has had the effect of increasing local prices by lowering competition
earlier this year it banned smaller ports from receiving coal and it has also carried out strict inspections on coal
customs also said that cargoes arriving in november will not be able to clear customs until late december or early january next year the cnbm executive said
huaneng currently has some cargoes on the water near ports unable to dock because of the delayed import clearance the manager said
two coal traders based in eastern zhejiang province said november arrivals in line with the trend so far this year would likely trigger a ban on imports
both declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter
domestic thermal coal futures prices have fallen more than percent so far in november compared with an percent gain in november last year while domestic output has risen percent in the first months of the year to billion tonnes
coal inventory at the six largest coastal power plants a benchmark for stocks rose to million tonnes on equivalent to days of consumption up from only days a year ago data from qinhuangdao port showed
a renewed ban on imports would still not be enough to revive the market as appetite from power plants remains weak the huaneng manager said
the utility s bookings in november had dropped sharply from previous months he added
it s another bad year for utilities he said pointing to beijing s shift to support clean energy including gas for residential heating and industrial boilers and the impact of slower economic growth
