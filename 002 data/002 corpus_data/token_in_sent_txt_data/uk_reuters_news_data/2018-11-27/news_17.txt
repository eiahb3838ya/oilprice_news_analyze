g20 makes slow progress on communique amid 'difficult' talks
aires reuters officials from the group of leading industrialized nations gathered in argentina are making slow progress in drafting a final communique for this weekend s leaders summit amid disagreements over language on trade and climate change delegates said
representatives from the countries known as sherpas began meeting in buenos aires on monday to start intensive discussions around the communique a agreement on policy issues that is due to be unveiled at the conclusion of the summit which begins on friday
leaders have met each year since the global economic crisis to try to reach broad agreement on important issues such as trade
but increasingly they have been bedeviled by disunity and a failure to agree on a communique this year would underscore growing divisions at a time of heightened international trade disputes
the talks are difficult but that is not a surprise a european source told reuters on tuesday
concerning the progress on the statement the talks are still ongoing so it is difficult to predict the a french finance ministry source added it s true the situation is quite frankly rather tense
the outcome in the coming days is quite a second source at the finance ministry said officials were pushing back on any mention of the paris climate agreement
after signalling its intention to withdraw from the accord last year the united states broke with other member countries that have pledged to end coal usage and take steps to reach goals outlined in the accord
the french are also pushing for the communique to reject protectionism and commit to reforming the world trade organization and the rules of global commerce the second french source said
an asian delegate told reuters there was no progress made on monday after a session
a delegate from latin america who also requested anonymity said a definitive draft was not expected until thursday
we are in full negotiation with the other delegations
the text will be known once the leaders approve it argentina s pedro villagra delgado the lead organizer or sherpa of the told reuters on tuesday
villagra delgado had said on that climate change steel and migration had emerged as the most complicated areas of discussion delaying final approval on the communique
recent history suggests the sherpas will struggle to agree to reach consensus
officials from countries attending a major summit earlier this month failed to approve a joint communique for the first time as the united states clashed with china over trade and security
in may president donald trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony again over tariffs and trade
some sherpas have said this year s communique will likely be watered down to try to ensure approval from trump an avowed sceptic of climate change who has adopted protectionist trade policies and a more isolationist foreign policy
trump s top economic adviser larry kudlow said on tuesday it was unclear whether there would be a final communique
if we didn t get one there d be no tears shed he said
