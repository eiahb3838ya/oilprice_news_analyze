preview-political divisions cloud poland climate talks
london reuters divisions within europe and tension between the united states and china pose major challenges to the next round of united nations talks on climate change
the most important climate conference since the paris agreement of opens on sunday in katowice poland in one of the most polluted regions in europe
success according to the conference s polish host will need a miracle
delegates from about nations are on a deadline to produce a rule book to flesh out details of the pact which the united states at the behest of president donald trump has announced it will quit
the deal aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to between and degrees celsius to avert more extreme weather rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species
the pact was years in the making and commits almost every country to fight global warming
but rules are needed to bring about real cuts in emissions and ensure they are closely monitored
scientists in october added to pressure for a strong outcome from the talks saying the world will hit the threshold around and unprecedented changes are needed in the way people use energy
despite this call for unified action there are divisions within the european union and trade tensions between the united states and china all of which have implications for climate policy
the president of the talks poland s former deputy energy minister michał kurtyka has expressed hopes of a compromise while at same time acknowledging the scope of the task ahead
only by a miracle can we realise success he said last month although miracles were a polish speciality
then earlier this month he added undoubtedly the geopolitical situation in was much easier for discussing global agreements than the one we have in
however my talks with representatives from the whole world show that there is a willingness to reach a compromise in political economic rifts developing nations and those vulnerable to climate change such as islands and states are looking to big industrialised countries to deepen cuts in emissions
senior chinese climate change official li gao told reporters last month that some industrialised countries more responsible for climate change were backsliding on the polluter pays principle which will make it hard to reach a consensus
in the european union european commission climate chief miguel arias canete s call for more ambitious goals was rebuffed by chancellor angela merkel who said it would be because some european countries including germany were struggling to meet their targets
the united states has a seat at the negotiating table until it can formally quit in november at the earliest
it may use its remaining time to try to develop ammunition for its trade dispute with china
former climate and energy adviser to president trump george david banks told reuters the administration wants to make sure it corrects as many of the flaws of the agreement that it can
the united states has always been interested in getting a robust framework for reporting and measuring emissions cuts particularly for developing countries such as china
it helps inform your trade policymaking and negotiations the chinese and others banks said
the united states also plans to promote fossil and nuclear fuels at the talks repeating a strategy that infuriated activists last year
