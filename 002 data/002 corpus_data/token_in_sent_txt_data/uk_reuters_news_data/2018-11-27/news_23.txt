update 1-iran's nuclear chief warns eu patience is running thin
brussels reuters iran s nuclear chief said on tuesday he was warning the european union s top diplomat that iranian patience was running out on the bloc s pledges to keep up oil trade despite sanctions
ali akbar salehi head of the atomic energy organisation of iran said the islamic republic could resume enriching uranium to percent purity seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants if it fails to see the economic benefit of the deal that curbed its nuclear programme
if we can not sell our oil and we don t enjoy financial transactions then i don t think keeping the deal will benefit us anymore salehi told reuters ahead of a meeting with eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini in brussels
i will pass certainly a word of caution to her mogherini i think the period of patience for our people is getting more limited and limited
we are running out of the assumed timeline which was in terms of following the meeting mogherini said she and salehi remained committed to safeguarding the nuclear accord
they equally expressed their determination to preserve the nuclear agreement as a matter of respecting international agreements and a key pillar for european and regional security mogherini s office said in a statement
it said mogherini also repeated the eu stance on issues of concern such as iran s role in the region alluding to iranian involvement in middle east conflicts from yemen to syria
under the deal with world powers iran restricted its enrichment programme widely seen in the west as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs in exchange for an end to international sanctions
president donald trump pulled out of the accord in may arguing it was weak because it did not halt iran s development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad and reimposed sanctions on iran s vital oil export sector earlier this month
but europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security
the eu and other remaining parties china and russia have struggled to preserve trade incentives for iran to respect the deal s nuclear limits under pressure
in brussels for talks on civilian nuclear cooperation that eu officials intended as a signal support for the accord salehi said the bloc s efforts were encouraging but added we have not yet seen any tangible he welcomed an eu plan to establish a special financial vehicle for trade with iran but only if it could preserve iranian oil exports tehran s economic lifeline
it the spv could be helpful in keeping the deal alive he said
if there is nothing to reap then what is the purpose of us staying in because voices in iran are day by day becoming more against the iran s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about million bpd in november from a peak of million bpd earlier this year
however output is expected to recover somewhat from december thanks to waivers including for two eu nations greece and italy
under the deal iran stopped producing percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile
salehi reiterated warnings that iran has the technical capacity to ramp up enrichment if the deal unravels
it is very easy for us to go back to what we were before even to a better position
we can start the percent enrichment activity
we can increase the amount of enriched uranium refined to percent fissile purity is well beyond the percent normally required to run civilian nuclear power stations though still well short of highly enriched or to percent purity needed for a nuclear bomb
