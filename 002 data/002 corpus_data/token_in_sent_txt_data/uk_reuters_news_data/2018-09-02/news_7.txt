update 2-germany dismisses bild report on vw petrol cars, no indication of fraud so far
frankfurt reuters germany s transport ministry said on sunday there was no fresh news in a bild am sonntag report that volkswagen engineers told investigators certain petrol engines in vw audi and porsche vehicles can be used to manipulate emissions tests
the ministry said in a statement to reuters that the newspaper report pertained to allegations that the federal motor transport authority kba had already examined
there had been no indication so far of any fraud concerning vw cars the statement said
earlier a spokesman for volkswagen the parent company of audi and porsche said vw would not comment on an ongoing investigation adding that the company in recent months had held intensive talks with the kba
there are no new circumstances here he said
the munich and braunschweig prosecutors offices that are involved in probes into vw group brands could not be reached for comment
bild said gearboxes and software could be manipulated so that vehicles show lower levels of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption citing internal documents and witness statements
vw s emissions scandal has cost the carmaker billion euros billion in penalties and fines for systematic manipulation of cars to mask excessive pollution levels
in europe vehicles are taxed according to their levels of polluting emissions
vw in admitted that around cars were also being tested for excessive emissions
vw had the cars checked by a neutral body under supervision by the regulator and found minimal deviation from requirements
the automaker was not required to make any technical changes to those vehicles
regulators in the united states blew the whistle on deliberate emissions cheating on after it emerged that the carmaker had developed an engine that failed to conform to pollution standards
vw used software to detect when a car was being subjected to a regulatory emissions measurement test and throttled back the engines during the test cycle masking excessive pollution
when a car engine was being accelerated and gears changed vw s onboard software would check whether the steering wheel was also being used
if the steering wheel angle was not being altered vw knew a vehicle was strapped to a dynamometer test bench activating exhaust emission filters
