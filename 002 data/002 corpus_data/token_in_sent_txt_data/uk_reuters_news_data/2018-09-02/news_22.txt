rpt-bruised bankers seek consolation prizes after shelved aramco ipo
repeats with no changes bankers disappointed after months preparing aramco ipo deal some bankers moved to other projects in saudi arabia privatisation programme still expected to raise up to bln by saeed azhar hadeel al sayegh and clara denina aug reuters investment banks which lost out on big payouts for the work on the shelved listing of oil giant aramco are lining up for a raft of other projects as saudi arabia pursues reforms
banks including jpmorgan and morgan stanley worked for months to prepare what would have been the biggest ever stock market debut
but the plan to sell percent of the company for a targeted billion was pulled
the bankers were paid retainer fees but were expecting around million would be shared among all the banks involved when the deal was done
now they are pinning their hopes on other projects from a privatisation programme that is part of riyadh s economic reform plan to loosen its reliance on oil
without the funds from the aramco sale the government is looking to raise money in other ways creating new opportunities for the banks bankers say
teams from jp morgan and morgan stanley that worked on the ipo have been shifted to advise on aramco planned acquisition of up to billion in petrochemicals firm saudi basic industries sabic three people familiar with the details of the transaction told reuters
hsbc which was also an adviser on the aramco ipo is expected to play a role in putting together the debt to fund that purchase they said
one of the sources said the issue could exceed the sovereign bond issue of billion which was a record for the kingdom
aramco said earlier this month it was in very discussions with the kingdom s public investment fund pif to acquire the stake in sabic but has not said how it will finance the deal
spokespeople for jp morgan morgan stanley and hsbc declined to comment on their role in the sabic deal
none of those banks have confirmed they were involved in the aramco ipo
other deals are expected to be forthcoming
the pif sovereign wealth fund has had to reconsider its budget in the last three months after finding out that they wouldn t be getting billion from the aramco ipo right away said a banker in saudi arabia
so there s been a flurry of activity as they look to raise cash in other ways
a lot of these are smaller deals billion here and there but all geared toward financing their commitments for big infrastructure projects without slowing down their the banker did not give details of the other deals
pif officials did not respond to a reuters request for comment
after reuters reported last week that the aramco deal had been shelved energy minister khalid said the government was committed to conducting the ipo at an unspecified date in the future
the bankers are nevertheless wary after the aramco experience
it highlighted the hurdles of doing business in a country governed by an absolute monarchy where public protest and political parties are banned
it also added to uncertainty after scores of top royals ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an campaign last november
the preparation for the listing was launched by crown prince mohammed bin salman two years ago and some bankers had flown to the kingdom hundreds of times to work in the dhahran camp a gated compound for the oil group s residents
a different source said aramco had demanded it deal only with the very top bankers
another person familiar with the aramco deal said he had made more than trips to dhahran over months but with little to show for it
he said his team would give the same presentation each time without getting much bankers also say the fees are modest in comparison to those paid by other countries
the deal flow is huge but there s a worry that the fees coming from these projects are low said a banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity
saudi arabia is lower than hong kong and dubai when it comes to fees he said
it s all typical fees for banks doing ipos in more developed markets are around percent of the overall deal while estimates from bankers and analysts for an aramco ipo was percent
the banks who worked on chinese internet giant alibaba s billion float led by six main underwriters pocketed an estimated million among them according to thomson reuters data
still the rewards from a privatisation that analysts expect to generate billion to billion by are too big for bankers to ignore
hsbc is already advising saudi international petrochemical company on a potential merger with sahara petrochemical which is being advised by morgan stanley according to disclosures from march
bank citigroup obtained a license to conduct capital markets business in saudi arabia last year after an absence of almost years
moelis is preparing to apply for an advisory license in saudi arabia and boutique investment bank evercore opened an office in dubai in
the government is also trying to make it easier to do deals changing the law to allow alternatives to traditional debt finance
there are plenty of deals to be made from bigger players looking to consolidate their market position and buy out competitors said mohammed fahmi the of efg hermes investment banking
