update 3-desperate to move crude, alberta may buy trains alone if canada balks
adds comments by federal prime minister justin trudeau by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba nov reuters alberta is willing to buy trains itself to help clear a backlog of crude oil if ottawa decides not to back the canadian province s proposal to split the costs of new rail cars premier rachel notley said on thursday
notley said alberta had asked prime minister justin trudeau s government to help pay for additional rail capacity to move an additional to barrels per day
notley said alberta had not received an answer from ottawa
full pipelines have stranded much of western canada s expanding crude output driving down the price refineries are willing to pay
ottawa needs to join alberta to help ease the economic pain notley told oil well drillers in calgary
if ottawa won t come to the table then we ll get it done ourselves
if it takes buying trains to move more oil to market then that s what we re going to reuters reported exclusively late on wednesday that alberta has asked ottawa to share the c million million capital cost and c billion in operating costs over three years of buying rail capacity to move more crude starting in july
sources briefed on the matter say federal officials are cool to the idea suggesting that by the time any new cars came on line the worst of the glut should be over
trudeau speaking later in calgary did not respond directly when asked about alberta s proposal
he said oil executives were focused on tax breaks and adding pipeline capacity
there are many things that are beyond our control here he told reporters citing refinery shutdowns and the fact canada exports almost all its oil to the united states
this is very much a crisis he added
trudeau s liberals could lose alberta seats in a federal election set for october if voters decide he did not do enough to help
finance minister bill morneau also showed little evident enthusiasm when asked by reporters about notley s request saying that s a discussion that might go forward in low prices are costing the canadian economy c million a day according to alberta
companies that service oil producers are on life support said mark scholz president of the canadian association of oilwell drilling contractors which hosted notley s speech
several canadian crude producers including cenovus energy have curtailed production and asked alberta to mandate cuts for other producers
notley said the province is considering several options to improve prices
mandated production is opposed by producers who own refineries to process the cheap oil such as suncor energy and imperial oil
the premier said alberta would have liked greater recognition of the industry s struggles in the federal government s fiscal update which morneau delivered on wednesday without including specific new measures to help the sector
a spokesperson for canadian national railway co could not be immediately reached
canadian pacific railway declined to comment
notley said alberta has six projects to partially upgrade oil worth a combined c billion if all proceed
upgrading reduces the thickness of bitumen so it does not require blending with lighter oil to move in pipelines freeing up space
