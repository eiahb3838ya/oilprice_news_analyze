russia hopes for ipo renaissance after worst year in a decade
reuters russian companies remain committed to planned stock market listings in sources and bankers say despite the country s worst year for equity sales in a decade
at least russian companies ranging from petrochemicals giants to real estate and health businesses had been lining up at least billion worth of initial public offerings ipos this year in moscow and in some cases london
but none have come to pass and will be the first year in a decade without a single russian ipo
this year was marked by an increase in interest rates
it triggered big outflows from emerging markets starting from may said dmitry brodsky head of equity capital markets for russia and cis at investment bank renaissance capital
quite a lot of companies continue to study the market or prepare to tap it
if the markets reverse they could be ready in four to eight but for all the plans and hopes the outlook remains clouded as sanctions against russia and wider economic concerns that have hammered emerging markets continue to weigh heavily on corporate russia
among those that had been considering an ipo this year were sibur one of the world s largest petrochemicals companies as well as insurer reso and private healthcare provider european medical center
there will be no ipos for the rest of the year the window is shut said alina sychova head of capital markets origination at sova capital
i know there are a few names looking at the they are going to be monitoring the situation in terms of sanctions brexit and overall market last year russian companies raised about billion from public equity sales about billion of which was from ipos including oleg deripaska s listing in london and moscow according to reuters data
manages deripaska s energy and aluminum assets
in april however deripaska and his business were among those placed under sanctions in response to moscow s alleged meddling in the election
moscow has denied any wrongdoing
the united states has also promised a fresh sanctions package known as the bill from hell designed to punish moscow for what washington described as malign activity and other international actions that russia has denied
the russian stock market was hit hard by the april sanctions
haulage company globaltruck which raised billion roubles million via its moscow ipo last november was trading at roubles per share on thursday down percent from the rouble offer price
sanctions emerging markets turmoil and rising treasury yields topped off by the continuing trade war have all hit the russian ipo plans bankers say
some companies that had been private business success stories such as food retailer magnit became by state bank vtb
others including mobile phone operator megafon decided to delist their shares while only a handful of businesses held secondary share offerings
i don t think market conditions are favorable said an executive at a company that had considered listing some of its operations
there s concern about the political situation consumer confidence budget oil prices
it s just volatile and that s worrying for everybody he told reuters
another to fall by the wayside was it services company ibs which postponed a million moscow ipo immediately after the sanctions announcement in april citing volatility in financial markets
the market both investors and companies needs a certain time to adjust and find a balance said boris kvasov an executive director for equity capital markets at vtb capital russia s leading investment bank
a lot of ipo transactions are in the stage of preparation and can materialize next year any positive trend in resolving this geopolitical issues could trigger an increase in market activity thanks also to unfulfilled reporting by olga popova and katya golubkova in moscow and dasha afanasieva and karin strohecker in london editing by david goodman
