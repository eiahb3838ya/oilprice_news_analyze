update 2-yamal lng starts norway ship transfers as production ramps up
adds yamal on train production analyst graphic by sabina zawadzki london nov reuters a liquefied natural gas lng tanker is transferring a cargo of russia s yamal lng to another vessel off the tip of northern norway on thursday the first such operation that will help the facility raise production
the vladimir rusanov an lng tanker and the lower pskov lng tanker are both anchored off honningsvag norway according to refinitiv eikon data
i can confirm there is an ongoing sts operation in the sea area of sarnesfjord of the city of honningsvag jan morten hansen regional director at the norwegian coastal administration said
novatek which operates the yamal facility has been ramping up production after loading its first cargo last december
but traders have said output was constrained by the availability of vessels able to operate in the waters there
now it looks likely that such transfers will become a regular occurrence
the transfers to other lng carriers free up the lng vessels to return sooner to yamal to pick up more cargoes
but this will increase demand for conventional lng ships to pick up the cargoes from norway
hansen said a norwegian shipping logistics company tschudi arctic transit as tat had permits to conduct such operations
tat will conduct regular in four positions on sarnesfjord and kafjord in north cape municipality
the permit allows three simultaneous operations in those positions hansen told reuters in emailed comments
novatek said on thursday its third train or facility at yamal had begun operations
the capacity of the three trains is million tonnes a year making it one of the largest single lng export plants in the world
lng traders and ship brokers have said yamal s output has been constrained by the number of lng tankers some of which are still being built
the seven tankers in operation have thus far been carrying lng cargoes to britain france and the netherlands and have either unloaded there or transferred the lng to conventional carriers for onward journeys sometimes to asia
another eight are at either under construction or slated to start operations soon
the transfer in norway shortens the tankers journeys by about two thousand kilometres freeing them up to return to yamal sooner enabling the facility to raise production
but the transfers will also squeeze the global lng tanker market jefferies shipping analyst randy giveans said
this will certainly tighten the lng tanker market as more conventional lng carriers are needed to finish the routes he said
and although the transportation time is only days from norway to europe the time under employment will be much greater due to the extended loading time he said adding that some cargoes will go even further to asia and latin america
lng shipping rates have already soared to record highs due to the increase in lng production from yamal and facilities as well as the longer distances travelled
