citgo petroleum slows aruba refinery revamp due to u.s. sanctions
feb reuters citgo petroleum has slowed work on an overhaul of its aruba refinery due to a lack of financing stemming from sanctions on venezuela s pdvsa the refining firm said
sanctions imposed last year by the united states on venezuela have limited access to credit for pdvsa and its subsidiaries affecting many oil projects in the south american country and caribbean islands where they operate
citgo aruba needs to slow down the refinery revamp project due to sanctions by the government on pdvsa which are not allowing us to get additional financing for the project the unit said in a press release late on tuesday
the caribbean refinery has been leased since by citgo the refining subsidiary of pdvsa under a agreement with the aruba government that also includes an extensive million overhaul aimed at restarting operations at the inactive refinery and converting the facility to a crude upgrader
we are working hard to find a solution and hope to fully resume the project in the near future said james cristman citgo s refining vice president in the release adding that workers had been hired for the project
citgo aruba did not say how long work would be delayed at the refinery which has remained idle since
the aruba government declined to comment
at the end of two consortia including japanese engineering firm jgc corp and french oil services company technip were shortlisted to handle the refurbishment
months later citgo asked its parent company pdvsa to provide initial funding of million according to an internal document seen by reuters but the credit was not granted and there has been little progress since then due to the lack of financing
