rpt-how to buy bunge? bond investors say adm would likely issue equity
repeats to additional subscribers by tom polansek and karl plume chicago feb reuters grain merchant archer daniels midland co would need to issue equity to help finance a proposed takeover of rival bunge ltd according to investors and bond analysts as a slump in agricultural commodity prices makes a deal too risky
issuing equity would dilute the ownership of existing adm shareholders in what would be the biggest grains industry deal on record
but it would put the company on a stronger financial footing helping it preserve cheap access to credit to fund its regular operations of buying processing and selling corn soybeans and wheat
given the importance for capital market access there would have to be some sort of equity component in this transaction said bill densmore senior director of corporate ratings at fitch ratings
adm s proposed acquisition of bunge came to light last month although neither side has confirmed that they are in talks
the deal has an estimated price tag above billion and comes as years of bumper harvests keep crop prices low and make it difficult for grains merchants to turn a profit
that downturn means creditors may keep adm on a short leash if it did the deal
for example fitch would potentially give adm a shorter window than its usual to months to reduce the ratio of its or leverage after a deal something critical to maintaining its a credit rating densmore said we would have less confidence in those earnings going forward densmore said
companies can be downgraded if leverage exceeds a certain ratio range for too long
like fitch s p global ratings has assigned adm an a rating indicating a corporate bond that is an attractive investment with a relatively low risk of default
adm has a comparable rating from moody s investors service which uses slightly different labels in its scale
adm relies on the good ratings for easy and cheap access to credit to buy crops from farmers make improvements to processing plants and build new grain facilities
merchants typically pay off borrowings after processing the crops and selling them to users like livestock producers
volumes are huge but margins are typically thin which makes access to cheap capital essential
last year adm processed more than million metric tons of corn and oilseeds and exported millions of tons more
adm did not respond to a request for comment
but chief financial officer ray young said on a conference call that maintaining strong ratings is paramount to adm
he suggested there were other ways of funding a deal than debt
we ve got so many avenues in order to help raise capital he said
they have to do an equity deal said sam halpert a senior analyst for vaneck s natural resources equity strategy which owns bunge shares and previously owned stock in to be sure concerns about how adm would finance a deal for bunge could dissipate if grain supplies tighten and earnings improve
adm which has a market capitalization of about billion would also likely need to sell some of bunge s assets to win approval from regulators due to an overlap of their businesses particularly in the united states
cash from those sales would help pay down some of the debt said john rogers senior vice president at moody s
those sales would be material he added but could come at a time when they may not fetch the highest prices
rogers said the estimated price for bunge may be too high for it just seems to be an awfully large price to pay given what you might get for some of these assets rogers said
but never say never in this bunge is rated bbb by fitch and s p and by moody s three notches below adm s ratings
last year fitch and moody s cut their outlooks for bunge due to weak earnings and after the company issued billion of debt to buy a controlling stake in a malaysian palm oil company
bunge has declined to comment on adm s approach which followed a wave of among top seed and crop chemical companies including dow chemical and dupont
bunge has a market cap of about billion
