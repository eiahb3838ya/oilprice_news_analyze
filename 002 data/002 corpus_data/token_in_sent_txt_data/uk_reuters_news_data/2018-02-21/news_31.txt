french opposition leader wauquiez under fire over taped comments
paris feb reuters french opposition leader laurent wauquiez came under fire on wednesday for taped comments in which he sniped at politicians in his own camp and government often using rough language prompting a senior party member to quit
the wauquiez president of the conservative les republicains also mocked german chancellor angela merkel saying she had no charisma while canadian prime minister justin trudeau he said was too politically correct
wauquiez whose party is the biggest opposition group in parliament said in december when he was elected that he intended to make life difficult for centrist president emmanuel macron in parliament
but his hardline views on immigration and europe have already prompted several senior moderate party officials including former prime minister alain juppe to take their distance from party policy since his election
the new controversy now grabbing headlines across france involves recordings broadcast by french tv tmc in which wauquiez apparently seeks to impress business school students with cool language
he names a senior politician in his party as always saying stupid things adding that he himself often speaks bullshit in interviews
he resorted to sometimes crude terms in criticising macron s lawmakers the powerful employers groups and other veterans in his party
when i heard wauquiez s comments i first thought he had tried to act as the trash and cash cool big brother in front of the students and would later say he regretted his comments dominique bussereau a former transport minister told reuters on wednesday
after wauquiez told an evening tv show on tuesday that he was standing by his comments in the name of free speech bussereau decided to quit les republicains
he wauquiez has given a very rightwing style to the party flattering the grassroots
but if the party wants to win elections again one day it needs to be able to attract a wide range of people and not focus on such a narrow line bussereau said
an eu lawmaker and a mayor in eastern france have also said they are quitting the party in protest at wauquiez s comments
wauquiez could be heard in one of the recordings telling the lyon business school students that they would get in trouble if one of them leaked his comments
