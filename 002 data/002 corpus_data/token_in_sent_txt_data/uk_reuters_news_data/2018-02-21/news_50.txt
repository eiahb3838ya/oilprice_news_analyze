wider image-drought-hit cape town dreads "day zero" when taps will run dry
cape town reuters a tough regime and the generosity of farmers have given south africa s main tourist hub welcome respite from a severe drought and helped push back a dreaded day zero when cape town s taps are expected to run dry
on tuesday the city of four million moved its estimate for day zero to july from june due to a decline in water usage and after the groenland farmers association also released billion liters of water from their private reservoirs into the steenbras storage dam
south africa has declared a national disaster over the drought afflicted southern and western regions including cape town which means the government could spend more money and resources to deal with the crisis
cape town which attracts about two million visitors each year wants to become more resilient as the effects of climate change are felt similar to other dry cities including melbourne and california
we know that while we are going through a challenging time we are building a green economy that will be a beacon of hope for many places around said tim harris chief executive for wesgro a regional trade and tourism agency
the chronic drought is hurting visitor numbers and knocking a rare economic bright spot officials said previously
according to the south african weather service two of the driest seasons ever recorded for the city since observations started in happened in the last three years in when mm inches fell and last year the driest year on record when annual rainfall totalled mm
but faced with severe water restrictions and punitive levies residents of cape town have cut collective consumption by more than half in the last three years as the city targets a daily consumption rate of no more than million liters
at the moment restrictions make it compulsory for residents to use no more than liters per person per day as city officials look to see out the hot summer months into winter when cape town usually gets rain
we must all keep doing absolutely everything in our power to reach the target set by the national department to reduce our urban usage by percent said ian neilson the deputy mayor
already hundreds of cape town residents are being forced to line up overnight to stock up on water in south africa s second largest economic hub and tourism attraction
however several desalination plants are planned and together with underground water reserves are expected to help augment water sources well into the future
