india's ongc short-lists three oil service majors to lift output from two fields
mumbai feb reuters india s oil and natural gas corp is set to hire international oil service giants for the first time to boost output from domestic oil fields in response to a government push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports
ongc india s biggest explorer has oil service companies halliburton schlumberger and ge subsidiary baker hughes to submit proposals on boosting production from two onshore fields according to a document seen by reuters
the three companies have until may to submit their proposals for what ongc is calling a production enhancement contract for an oilfield in assam state and another in gujarat
the shortlist is ready
we will now share our data on the two fields with these companies an ongc executive said
the executive who did not wish to be named as ongc has yet to make an official announcement said the final contract is likely to be awarded by may
emails to halliburton schlumberger and baker hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of business hours
the government last september proposed selling a percent stake in ongc s producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet prime minister narendra modi s target of cutting oil imports percent by
india s oil production has stalled below million barrels per day bpd in recent years even as oil demand has surged
that has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring making it the world s importer behind china and the united states
in january india s imports hit a record of almost million bpd
ongc which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like exxon mobil or a oil major like petrochina has often been criticized by analysts and new delhi for failing to increase its production
ongc s output most of it from fields that have been operating for more than years is declining at the rate of to percent a year
a major part of the company s capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline
for the fiscal year ended march ongc s standalone crude oil production stood at million metric tonnes bpd a one percent fall from the previous year
once the final contractor is chosen in may the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields the ongc executive said
we will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce the executive said
halliburton schlumberger and baker hughes will get access to ongc s data rooms pertaining to its kalol field in gujarat and the geleki field in assam before submitting a final bid according to the bidding document
ongc might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success the executive said
ongc explored a similar move in and had signed agreements with halliburton and schlumberger aimed at enhancing production but the agreements were later cancelled according to reports in local media
