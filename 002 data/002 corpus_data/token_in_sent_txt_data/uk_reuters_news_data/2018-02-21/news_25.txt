dutch agency to allow pdvsa to operate in bonaire after maintenance dispute
feb reuters a regulatory agency has decided not to impose restrictions on venezuelan oil company pdvsa s operations at its terminal on the dutch caribbean island of bonaire after receiving new repair assurances the dutch human environment and transport inspectorate ilt said on wednesday
the caribbean island in december said pdvsa could lose its license to operate the oil storage facility which is essential to venezuelan fuel oil exports if it could not fulfill regulators maintenance demands
the authorities had asked pdvsa to commit to a remediation project that involved firm financial commitments
in the meantime several oil tanks were shut because they were not in compliance with regulations according to a company source
the agency said on wednesday that pdvsa has demonstrated it has the financial resources to urgently address the key overdue maintenance
the first payment was made several weeks ago according to the source
the ilt will not impose administrative coercion to the bonaire petroleum corporation nv bopec for the time being
it will not shut down the use of the piers at the company the agency said in a statement
but sharpened supervision will follow to ensure the maintenance work is accomplished in a proper and safe way the agency added
a series of inspections are planned this year to verify bopec is taking steps to comply with the regulations
penalties and new restrictions could be imposed if the operator does not comply the ilt said
bopec fully owned by pdvsa has held an environmental permit since but suffered serious delays in the maintenance of storage tanks pipes piers and electrical installations according to the ilt
the oil terminal is critical to pdvsa s logistics in the caribbean and its closure could hurt fuel shipments to customers in asia at a time when the country is desperate for export revenue
