us, canadian provinces launch first cap-and-trade auction to battle climate change
new york feb thomson reuters foundation the state of california and two canadian provinces kicked off a auction of greenhouse gas emission credits on wednesday their first joint effort to buy and sell in the cap and trade market to fight global warming experts said
the auction comes less than two months after the local and canadian regional governments merged their trading markets for cap and trade a system designed to limit carbon emissions by putting a price tag on pollutants produced
in a cap and trade market those who produce low levels of greenhouse gases earn credits which they can sell to those who produce high emissions and exceed limits
carbon dioxide emissions are one of the major drivers of climate change
the auction by california quebec and ontario represented a big test for the new market said erick lachapelle associate professor of political science at the university of montreal and a specialist in energy and environmental politics
it shows that this is workable
we can expand
we can link carbon markets across borders lachapelle told the thomson reuters foundation by phone
the merging of ontario s cap and trade program with the previously linked california and quebec markets created the world s second largest carbon emissions market officials have said
more than million emission permits were being sold at the joint auction authorities in quebec said
north america s joint systems set up over the last six years have face some questions over how much carbon emissions they actually hold back lachapelle said
for now the european union is considered the world largest carbon emission market but china market is rapidly growing experts say
