explainer-why syria's messy war keeps escalating
beirut reuters despite the collapse of islamic state last year and a widespread international perception that syria s president bashar is winning the war there have been major new escalations around the country
seven years in syria s conflict has killed hundreds of thousands driven millions from their homes disturbed the regional balance of power and dragged in foreign nations whose rivalry has upset existing alliances
it is that international element that has helped transform the war from a straight fight between assad and rebel forces trying to overthrow the president into a mess of overlapping conflicts
in the process syria has become a battleground for geopolitical rivalries pitching the united states against russia and iran against israel while inflaming the rift between sunni and shi ite muslims in the middle east
graphic syria areas of control http assad s goal is clear the complete recapture of all parts of syria and the restoration of his government s rule
his strongest ally russia turned the war in his favour by sending its air force to help him in
but it may be readier than assad to agree concessions with his adversaries
it has brought iran and turkey into talks to stabilise the crisis by agreeing zones meant to stop the fighting
assad s other main backer is iran along with allied militias such as hezbollah from lebanon
tehran says it is fighting ite sunni militancy
but iran s critics say it wants to cement regional power with a land bridge extending from iran through iraq and syria to lebanon
the most fearsome sunni militant group is islamic state
its caliphate is now in tatters
but it still holds pockets of desert and will take advantage of any new conflict to undermine stability and retake ground
syria s rebel groups all want to oust assad but they are divided internally over whether they want a state based on islam or syrian nationalism and sometimes fight each other
they want to keep the uprising alive maintain foreign support and defend their remaining territory
turkey was one of the biggest rebel supporters
its main focus now however is driving the kurdish ypg away from its border as it sees the militia as an extension of the pkk a group that has waged a insurgency against ankara
kurdish forces sandwiched between turkey and syria s army want to cement their autonomy in the north where they have set up ruling councils and held elections
they want to stop turkey or assad attacking their territory
the united states helped rebels earlier in the war but became more focused on fighting islamic state
it backs the sdf syrian democratic forces alliance whose strongest element is the kurdish ypg
however washington wants to smooth the outrage this has caused its nato ally turkey
washington also wants to contain iran as it sees the country s growing influence across the region as threat to its closest middle east allies israel and saudi arabia
israel wants to stop any expansion of power for its mortal foes iran and hezbollah and keep them far from its borders
graphic afrin areas of control http assad and his allies want to hasten the end of the rebels by pushing them from eastern ghouta and are using the siege and bombardment tactics that helped them crush opposition in aleppo homs and other former insurgent strongholds
many rebels have been pushed into northwestern idlib province and neighbouring areas their biggest remaining stronghold
turkey has sent some troops to idlib to monitor a zone there after talks with russia and iran
but a recent advance by assad and his allies took ground in idlib
turkey and allied rebels launched an assault last month against the kurdish ypg in afrin a region that is separated from a much bigger area controlled by the kurds further east
while the united states backed the ypg in its fight against islamic state it has not supported it against turkey in afrin calling only for turkish restraint
russia had stationed troops in afrin to help stop any turkish assault but it also wants ankara s cooperation in its wider peacemaking efforts in syria and pulled them out
the kurds then turned to assad for help despite their rivalry
assad has not sent his army there but did dispatch allied militias linked to iran to help the kurds against turkey
turkey may turn next to attack the ypg near manbij km miles to the east of afrin
it is the only area west of the euphrates other than afrin
but unlike afrin there are forces in manbij who have fired on rebels and say they will defend themselves and their sdf allies
the united states is also present in eastern syria where the sdf and a rival campaign by assad and his allies have each taken swathes of ground from islamic state
despite the ypg s request for assad s help in afrin there is no sign of agreement between them in the east where jets backing forces have struck assad s allies
potentially the most explosive area of conflict in syria is the southwest where rebels still hold a swathe of territory near the golan heights
the united states russia and jordan whose border is nearby agreed a zone there last year
but assad and allied militia with ties to iran and hezbollah waged a ground campaign there last year and remain stationed in the area
this is anathema to israel which sees the militias as iranian pawns
israel shot down an iranian drone this month and responded with air raids in which one of its jets was downed
it showed the risk of fighting in syria leading to a wider confrontation between israel and iran that could also expand to hezbollah in lebanon
any war between israel and iran and its allies would also risk dragging in the united states
