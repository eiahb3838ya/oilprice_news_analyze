chief financial officer richard voliva said gasoline margins fell out in the latter part of the quarter and that the company had not captured the improvement in crude prices in the fourth quarter
we had a couple of conversion rate and unit issues during the quarter which probably hit production and really sales of kind of the higher value of finished products that are the margin he said
hollyfrontier which mostly processes sweet crude oil said refining margins rose percent to per barrel in the quarter
that was lower however than the per barrel predicted by jefferies analyst corey goldman and estimated by barclays
some analysts pointed to technical problems at plants as one reason for the shortfall
net profit rose to million or per share in the quarter ended from million or cents per share a year earlier hollyfrontier said in a release
excluding items however the company reported earnings of cents per share compared to average expectations of cents according to analysts polled by thomson reuters
the figures followed results by larger rivals valero energy corp and marathon petroleum corp which both beat expectations earlier this month in a booming oil sector
