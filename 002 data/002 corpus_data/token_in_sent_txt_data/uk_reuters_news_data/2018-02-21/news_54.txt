feature-solar water pumps up incomes for nepal's quake-hit farmers
shikharpur nepal feb thomson reuters foundation in the village of shikharpur in nepal s remote himalayan foothills the faint sound of water can be heard trickling through a large metal pump
standing in golden mustard fields a huge solar panel powers the pump that provides some litres of water daily to families still recovering from nepal s devastating earthquake
before the pump we used to walk two or three hours a day to collect water said daley sarki a vegetable farmer whose mud home still bears the cracked scars of the disaster
a massive earthquake struck impoverished nepal home to famed mount everest in april killing nearly people and disrupting the lives of more than million
helping families recover has proved harder than expected for reasons ranging from aid funding delays to a fuel blockade
in shikharpur located about km miles from the capital the earthquake left most households without access to drinking water said ram prasad bolakhe a community leader
there were many problems he said listing destroyed homes contaminated water and frequent power outages
to improve access to clean water a project led by british charity renewable world set up a pump that collects underground water and transfers it up metres ft to the himalayan village where it is stored in tanks
the system serves about households and a school said bolakhe with each family paying for their own use based on water meter readings
the technology has significantly improved people s health bolakhe told the thomson reuters foundation adding that better sanitation and access to drinking water have limited the spread of diseases
residents say it has boosted incomes too
sarki a widow said the time she has saved by no longer having to walk far to fetch water has allowed her and other women farmers to take up second jobs in her case as a labourer on a dairy farm
the additional water also means she can grow more produce not just to feed herself but to sell at the market
my income has doubled she said noting proudly that she can now grow crops including tomatoes and cauliflowers for two seasons a year
the project also trains farmers to use water more efficiently grow vegetables such as sweet peppers under plastic sheets that serve as makeshift greenhouses and promote their produce to local markets and traders
one unintended consequence said bolakhe has been bringing the community closer together as neighbours have to interact to manage the water system
it allows for equal distribution of water among all castes including dalits like sarki and encourages villagers to meet and collaborate he said
rabindra karki from international development enterprises ide nepal a partner of the project that helps poor farmers said the initiative had united villagers over a shared resource
they re aware of the system as theirs they perceive that it s for them to fulfil their needs he said
karki whose organisation has set up other water systems in nepal as part of the building resilience and adaptation to climate extremes and disasters braced programme funded by the british government said access to water is crucial for villagers to get back on their feet after the quake
solar irrigation is more reliable and efficient than traditional water systems as it is less vulnerable to erratic rainfall and high altitudes he said
the technology should be rolled out to more remote parts of the country to help disadvantaged communities he added
