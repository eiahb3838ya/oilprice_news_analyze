update 1-trump signals he's open to mileage tax with praise of oregon program
washington reuters the white house on wednesday praised an experimental program in oregon that charges a mileage tax to volunteer drivers adding to signals that president donald trump is open to finding new revenue sources to pay for his proposed infrastructure program
many of trump s fellow republicans however dislike the idea of a transportation tax as it would go against the grain of the party s push to lower taxes and could hit rural areas harder than cities
in the annual economic report of the president the white house described oregon a state where environmental issues are a priority for many voters as a pioneer in transportation funding and highlighted its funding initiative which began in
volunteers are charged a fee of cents for each mile driven on state roads
in return drivers get rebates for state fuel taxes
as of the end of only about people were participating in the program which is intended to gather data and generate consumer feedback
the program offers tangible evidence that a tax on vehicle miles traveled is a promising alternative to relying on fuel taxes the report said
kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers described oregon s mileage tax as innovative in a conference call with reporters and made clear the trump administration was open to looking at ways to raise revenue for infrastructure projects
trump last week called for using billion in new federal spending over years in an effort to stimulate trillion in infrastructure spending
it would largely see states shoulder most costs and rely on unspecified spending cuts to pay for repairs
the federal tax of cents per gallon of gasoline has not been hiked since
the federal tax on diesel fuel is cents a gallon
the money raised from those taxes is used to pay for infrastructure repairs but has failed to keep up with costs as cars became more
hassett said the administration was still looking at the pluses and minuses of different ways to pay for infrastructure
there s a lot of discussion that will continue to evolve i m sure as the infrastructure legislation moves forward about how should we pay for this stuff hassett said
in a private meeting with lawmakers last week to discuss infrastructure trump expressed support for hiking the federal gasoline tax by cents a gallon according to democratic senator tom carper who attended the meeting
the report also boosted the idea of driverless cars estimating autonomous cars could add more than billion to gdp million jobs and billion in wages to the labor force once they account for half of vehicles
