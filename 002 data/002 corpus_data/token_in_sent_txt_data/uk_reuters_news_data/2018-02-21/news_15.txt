update 2-cruz urges biofuels policy revamp at rally for bankrupt u.s. refiner
philadelphia reuters republican senator ted cruz of texas on wednesday urged president donald trump s administration to push for an overhaul of the nation s biofuels policy during a rally at a pennsylvania oil refinery that blames its bankruptcy on the controversial regulation
we need a federal government that stands up for workers not against them cruz whose state is home to numerous oil refining companies told a cheering crowd of people gathered in a tent on the grounds of the philadelphia energy solutions plant
the oil industry and the corn lobby have been at odds over the causes of the refiner s insolvency which has become a touchstone in the debate over whether the renewable fuel standard rfs needs to be rewritten
the regulation requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits from those who do
while it has created a lucrative market for corn states like iowa and nebraska refiners like philadelphia energy solutions pes that have no blending facilities say it is unfair and costly
pes which employs more than a thousand people declared bankruptcy in january and placed the blame squarely at the feet of the rfs
the corn industry has pushed back pointing out that other refining companies like top refiner valero energy corp are raking in their biggest profits in years and suggesting pes problems may have had more to do with regional refining economics and management choices
reuters reported this week that pes investor backers led by the carlyle group withdrew at least million in a series of distributions from pes since most of them backed by loans the company ultimately could not repay
the distributions combined with a shift in energy economics made complying with the rfs a challenge
workers at pes deserve real answers for the financial troubles facing the refinery and that starts with investors who drained the company while other refiners flourished under the rfs said emily skor chief executive of biofuels producer growth energy
cruz has been leading an effort to reform the rfs putting holds on presidential nominations favored by lawmakers and organizing meetings with administration officials
the oil and gas industry is among cruz s top financial backers according to the center for responsive politics
cruz has suggested putting a cap of cents on credit prices a fraction of their current value a move that would save refiners millions of dollars but which was roundly rejected as unworkable by the biofuels industry
cruz said on wednesday that despite his free market principles he supports capping prices of the credits called rins a rin is not a commodity it s a made up government license he said
the former presidential hopeful said that his proposal would help refiners without hurting corn growers
he added that if he had won the race for the white house he would have done more than suggest tweaks to the program
if i would ve won i would ve ended the rfs cruz said to a round of applause
pes is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly million of its current rfs compliance costs as part of its restructuring package
complying with the rfs was more expensive than the company s payroll and ranked only behind purchasing crude oil as its biggest cost according to pes
