the worse of the violence they said occurred in the town of lucapa located some km south of the border with drc in the heart of the lunda norte province
angolan security forces stormed the town according to witnesses killing dozens of people burning down homes looting property and forcing people to leave

there was a lot of violence in lucapa
the military was shooting at us while tshowke were killing people with machetes
they jointly killed more than a dozen people said victor tshambapoko who worked as a diamond digger in the region
reuters could not independently verify the accusations
angolan police commissioner antonio bernardo spokesman for the operation denied there had been rights abuses by security forces and said the only fatality he knew of was in a traffic accident
we have no record of any burning of homes much less reprisals and or assaults on anyone he told reuters
angola and its government appeals to the common sense of the international community to realize that there is no underlying xenophobia but only the legitimate normalizing of the life of the country and national amadhou kabaseke taty kasai s provincial director of the congolese border agency dgm told reuters that he believed there had been serious violations of human rights during the angolan operation

congolese people have been expelled in degrading conditions
they have been molested beaten and killed especially in lucapa by the angolan military angolan president joao lourenco is trying to boost investments in his country and wean it off a heavy reliance on oil exports
reforming the diamond industry is part of that drive and operation transparency in lunda norte aims to reduce diamond smuggling and raise more revenues for state coffers from the lucrative sector

security sources in drc and angola have already said they are concerned about heightened tensions in the area in the to congolese elections in december
a reuters reporter in the congolese border town of kamako saw thousands of people making their way on foot and in trucks along the red dirt road to tshikapa the provincial capital of kasai located some km to the north
