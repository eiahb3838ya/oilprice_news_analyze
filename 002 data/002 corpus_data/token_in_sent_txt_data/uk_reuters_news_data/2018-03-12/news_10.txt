update 2-colombia peso rallies after duque's strong results in presidential primary
bogota reuters a significant lead in votes for colombian candidate ivan duque over leftist gustavo petro in presidential primaries pushed the peso up against the dollar on monday as investors bet duque would be more business friendly that the former guerrilla candidate
petro s promise of a social economy that would raise taxes and shift away from oil colombia s top export towards agriculture has worried investors in the andean nation as opinion polls showed the former member of the disbanded guerrilla group and of bogota running ahead of duque
parties will likely now look to form alliances before the may election to replace president juan manuel santos
if no candidate gets more than percent of the vote a second round will be held in june
sunday s primaries in which duque won almost percent more votes than petro did were considered a better test of voter support than often inaccurate opinion polls although some voters will have participated strategically and may not back either winner in the presidential vote
more than million votes were cast in the primary and million in the contest
while all candidates advocate clamping down on corruption and investment in education and health the two top pollers differ in their views on a peace deal with marxist farc rebels
duque supported by former president alvaro uribe and his democratic center party backs foreign investment and an aggressive security strategy meant to combat colombia s remaining rebel group which regularly kidnaps and bombs oil pipelines
he has been vocal in his opposition to the farc accord which could stymie implementation if he wins
petro and his colombia humana party pledges to improve conditions for the poor ban open pit mining and use clean energy
voters also elected a new congress
while no party came close to winning control of either legislature the democratic center party came out on top in the senate with seats and second in the lower house with seats
petro s decencia coalition won just four senate seats and only two seats in the lower house
there s now sure to be at the presidential level a shake out of candidates over the coming weeks as we approach the first round petro can t yet be completely discounted but he looks further from his goal today compared with friday said rupert stebbings managing director of equities at grupo bancolombia
the peso cop stfx strengthened percent against the dollar to and local treasury bonds rose to yield percent from friday s close of percent
the peso and bonds markets are much more liquid than the stock market which is heavily dependent on oil prices and shares of oil company ecopetrol
the fact that the centre right has won that doesn t represent a political change for the markets said juan david ballen head of economic studies at casa de bolsa brokerage
the farc now the revolutionary alternative common force party were guaranteed five seats in both houses as part of the peace deal and failed to win any others
also running for president are sergio fajardo a former mayor of medellin and president german vargas lleras
they both favour improvements to infrastructure and tax cuts for businesses though fajardo is considered
duque and vargas lleras from the radical change party have strong party machines behind them and can count on backing in congress if they win
other candidates include liberal party elder statesman humberto de la calle who lead government negotiators at farc talks and former defence minister and ambassador juan carlos pinzon
