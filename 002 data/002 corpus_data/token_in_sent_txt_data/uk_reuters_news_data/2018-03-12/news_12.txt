update 1-colombia's santos says will restart talks with eln rebels
bogota reuters colombia and the marxist eln guerrilla group will restart peace talks in ecuador president juan manuel santos said on monday after a pause marked by deaths on both sides
santos suspended talks in late january after the national liberation army eln launched a series of bomb attacks that killed eight police officers and injured dozens immediately following the end of the two sides ceasefire
since the bilateral ceasefire ended there have been too many deaths on both sides too many wounded too many victims this is what we must stop santos said in a televised address
and that can only be achieved by talking he said adding he hoped the two sides could agree to another ceasefire
santos has said the halt to talks was a dilemma and hinted he could scrap them entirely though he applauded the unilateral ceasefire held by the rebels during legislative elections
he acknowledges talks are unpopular and has slammed the group for its attacks on the armed forces
santos did not specify a start date for the renewed talks but said the government negotiators will travel back to quito
colombian forces have killed rebels in fighting since the ceasefire ended on while rebels have launched repeated attacks killed members of the armed forces and halted pumping of crude oil with bomb attacks
the eln said in a statement it would answer santos call to return to negotiations and reiterated the desire for another bilateral ceasefire
we join president santos call to restart talks with the conviction that it is better to have dialogue in the midst of a bilateral talks with the former farc rebel group which signed a peace deal were also fraught at times
santos suspended talks when that group now a political party kidnapped a general
the peace deal failed in a referendum but eventually passed through congress
the eln founded by roman catholic priests in is considered more radical than the farc and is less centralized
the group has sought peace with the government before but made little progress
presidential elections in may could determine the fate of the talks
candidates including the liberals humberto de la calle who was the government s head negotiator at the farc talks say negotiations are positive but not a panacea
candidates accuse santos of failing to make a fair deal with the farc including by allowing to avoid jail sentences
