update 1-german innogy carve-up could complicate sse's npower merger
london reuters rwe and s surprise carve up of germany s innogy could complicate a merger of sse and npower to create britain s second largest energy supplier although both firms said it remained on track
under sunday s proposed of innogy its assets will be divided between parent rwe and which would take over npower potentially raising regulatory concerns some analysts said on monday
sse and npower said last year they would merge their retail gas and power operations combining some million customers to better challenge british gas
uncertainty over the merger plan hit sse shares on monday
they were down percent to pence per share at gmt underperforming the wider ftse index
sse and npower said in separate statements that their proposed deal was on track despite the development in germany without giving further britain s competition and markets authority cma which is expected to make an initial decision by april on the planned merger said on monday it will be engaging with both sse and innogy to consider the implications of the new german deal
the deal the cma has been looking at is between innogy s npower and sse but now if npower is owned by that s three of the big six energy suppliers involved jefferies analyst ahmed farman told reuters
britain s big six energy suppliers control around percent of the retail energy market
the other three suppliers are centrica s british gas edf energy and iberdrola s scottish power
it could potentially complicate things from a regulatory point of view farman added
innogy rwe and sse have not commented on how the transaction could impact the british merger which would create a new retail company with sse shareholders holding percent and innogy percent
but innogy said on monday the joint venture with sse has great strategic importance for the group adding the deal had been filed with british antitrust bodies and was expected to close late this year or early in
one solution to potential regulatory hurdles could be for to sell down its innogy share in the new company said peter atherton an associate at consultancy cornwall insight
we haven t seen any indication wants to do that but if it the merger is a stumbling block for the wider deal then that is a logical solution he said
has not given any further details on its plans for npower but said it intends to take on innogy s retail business
innogy managers speaking at the group s annual news conference said the uk market environment remained difficult despite innogy having cut prices and invested efforts in stemming customer losses
