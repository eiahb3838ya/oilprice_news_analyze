"no deal" brexit could cost uk, eu companies 58 bln pounds -report
london reuters companies in britain and the european union face an extra billion pounds billion in annual costs if there is a brexit with britain s vast financial sector set to be the industry according to a report on monday
firms across the eu s countries other than britain will have to pay billion pounds a year in tariff and barriers if britain leaves the bloc without a deal the report by oliver wyman management consultants and law firm clifford chance said
in return british exporters to the eu will have to pay billion pounds a year
these increased costs and uncertainty threaten to reduce profitability and pose existential threats to some businesses the report said
britain is due to leave the eu next year after voting in favor of ending more than four decades of political economic and legal ties with the world s largest trading bloc
in the absence of an agreement trade between britain and the other eu members would default to world trade organization rules and tariffs a sharp contrast to the access the uk has enjoyed as a member of the eu s single market
although britain wants a deal the government says it is preparing for any outcome including the chance that britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal
it has set aside billion pounds to prepare for all eventualities
if britain stays in a form of a customs union it would reduce the costs for both sides by about half the report said
however prime minister theresa may has ruled out keeping britain in an eu customs union because it would prevent the country from striking its own trade deals with economies such as china and india
monday s report showed percent of the extra costs in britain from a brexit would be shared by five industries financial services cars agriculture and food and drink consumer goods and chemicals and plastics
financial services firms in britain would suffer the biggest hit because unlike some automotive and aerospace firms that can switch to domestic suppliers of components they will have to set up new operations in the eu to continue serving clients
goldman sachs and ubs said last week they were starting to transfer some bankers to frankfurt in preparation for britain s exit from the eu
the bank of england has warned that about finance jobs may leave britain by the end of next year because of brexit
however top investment banks are currently planning to hire far more people in london than anywhere else in europe
in the eu the hardest hit sector would be the automotive sector agriculture and food and drinks chemicals and plastics consumer goods and industrials the report said
