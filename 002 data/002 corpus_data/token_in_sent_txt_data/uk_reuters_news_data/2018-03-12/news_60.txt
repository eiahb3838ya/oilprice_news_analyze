feature-with bottle walls and a recycled ship, kenyaâ€™s coast takes on plastic waste
watamu kenya march thomson reuters foundation like many places in the world kenya s coast faces challenges with waste plastic from used shopping bags that block drains to water bottles that litter streets and wash into the sea
but this indian ocean resort village best known for its tropical beaches and swahili history is taking on plastic waste turning it into homes furniture and maybe even a ship capable of sailing all the way to south africa to raise awareness about plastic pollution
sammy baya for instance one resident of the coastal community now owns a house with walls made of stacked glass and plastic bottles
it just like living in any other house but this one unlike other ordinary houses allows more light to enter the house and therefore i don t use my solar panels for lighting when there is a full moon baya told the thomson reuters foundation
you should see the inside of this house at night when there is a full moon
it s mesmerising he said
he said building his house last year in part with waste plastic and glass cut the costs by about percent
justin kitsao chairman of the watamu marine association an environmental group said constructing houses using plastic and glass bottles reduces the need for other building materials particularly sand and concrete blocks
plastic bans watamu s not the only part of kenya taking action on plastic waste
the country has banned the sale and use of disposable plastic carry bags and last month charles sunkuli kenya s environmental principal secretary said his ministry will launch a plastic bottle scheme in april
the move is a step back from an earlier proposed total ban on plastic bottles but it has won the support of the key kenyan association of manufacturers
waste disposal planning needs to be coupled with the instruments and infrastructure to help recycle and reuse waste material the association noted in a statement
because plastic creates environmental pollution and takes fossil fuels to produce cutting back on its use is important to curb climate change and improve the environment kenyan environmentalists say
in watamu eco world a organisation has hired local people to collect plastic along the indian ocean beach each week
the group then separates the plastics according to weight before grinding some of them into tiny pieces that are sold to artisans who use them to make chairs poles and tables
intact plastic and glass bottles also are washed and bound together with sand and cement to create walls that can replace brick and block walls in homes and other structures
bottles of different sizes and colours can be used to create different effects
any plastic waste eco world can not sell is donated to an unusual effort to raise awareness about the problem a plastic ship being built in lamu county that is set to sail to south africa to raise awareness on the importance of recycling plastic to protect the sea
ali skanda who hopes to captain the voyage in june said cutting the amount of plastic waste reaching the ocean is becoming increasingly urgent
if we continue to litter our water bodies the marine life might disappear one day he predicted in a telephone interview with the thomson reuters foundation
melinda ress meanwhile the operations manager at hemingways a watamu resort said her facility has begun to replace palm leaf roofs on some structures with recycled plastic roofing
for now the material is imported from malaysia but the resort hopes to begin using locally recycled plastic soon she said
i fully support the ban on plastic bags and i wish they could extend it to the plastic straws
plastic has been a menace to the marine ecosystem she said
