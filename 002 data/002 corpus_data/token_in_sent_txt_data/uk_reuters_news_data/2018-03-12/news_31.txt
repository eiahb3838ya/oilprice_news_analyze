we ve understood that there is no real will among employers to compromise from the outset labour union negotiator asle reime who will represent oil workers told reuters ahead of the talks
pension rights are important to all workers regardless of which industry they are in that s why i think there is more weight behind the demands this year and also more willingness to strike he added
