ceraweek-u.s. states slow trump offshore oil drilling expansion plan
houston reuters the trump administration s plan to broadly expand drilling in offshore waters is moving slowly due to opposition from coastal states and indifference from oil companies that have turned their focus to other opportunities
the administration hopes encouraging energy development outside of shale oilfields will further its goal of energy but existing obama administration lease rules remain in place through unless the new rules gain approval
the department of the interior this year proposed opening vast new acreage in the outer continental shelf to drilling
the comment period wrapped up march
still secretary ryan zinke said last week he remained deep in discussions with state governors some of whom have thrown up roadblocks that would impede or bar drilling off their coasts
a new outer continental shelf lease program proposes lease sales including areas that had not been offered since
at least states have sought exemptions and zinke has agreed to exclude areas off florida
on the plan we made everything available to look at zinke told reuters at the ceraweek energy conference in houston
governors from across the west coast and much of the east coast are meeting with the interior and objecting to areas off their states for drilling
state discussions could last through year end
so far officials in alaska maine georgia and gulf coast states other than florida have said they were open to expanding drilling
california and other states have said they would deny needed permits for onshore services or transport
you can t bring energy ashore unless you have access to state waters zinke said
while oil companies say they have met with interior officials on gulf of mexico access to new regions zinke said they must go through the official comment process
they know my position we put everything on and will go line by line he said
while washington continues to discuss the opening with states oil companies are turning to basins in the deepwater gulf of mexico and other nations were deepwater drilling or auctions are ongoing like brazil mexico and guyana
we are constantly scouring the planet to really understand resource potential said steve pastor bhp billiton s president of petroleum operations
the gulf of mexico has some of the best discovered potential he said
bhp has previously explored acreage in the eastern gulf of mexico at its sake project in a formation off the coast of alabama
proposed new lease areas along the atlantic coast would require seismic mapping and development of infrastructure that would take time
i can t put a fine point on whether we would pursue it pastor said
chevron corp which disclosed a large gulf of mexico oil discovery in existing lease areas earlier this year said new areas will have to stack up against existing projects
they will have to compete with the other drilling we have in the world said robert ryan chevron s vice president of global exploration
we just don t know most of those areas haven t been evaluated royal dutch shell which is active in federal waters in the gulf of mexico said it was encouraged by the additional gulf acreage that is opening under existing lease sales
costs including a recent percent tariff on imported steel would be an issue
we know what we like here said wael sawan shell s executive vice president of deepwater
we re encouraged by some of the elements but then some things like steel tariffs raise a question mark he said
