german power deal sets template for eu utilities m&a
utilities increasingly focus on one business spot markets reduce value of vertical integration physics and politics limit potential of m a focus on technology acquisition developing countries by geert de clercq paris march reuters an deal to split innogy between rwe and looks set to create a template for european utilities m a that includes the demise of the integrated model no more big deals and a quest for emerging market growth
under the deal announced on sunday german utility rwe will combine the renewables businesses of rival with innogy s while will acquire innogy s regulated energy networks and customer operations
the deal continues the of and rwe which were two vertically integrated utilities before they split their renewables and grids from their thermal generation assets
with set to sell its stake in thermal generation unit uniper to finland s fortum this year and rwe will be left with the only assets that still make money in europe s power industry subsidised renewables and regulated networks
germany s switch from nuclear to renewables after the fukushima disaster in and european union support for renewable energy created huge overcapacity that is pricing thermal and generation out of the market
in response rwe s and s first two years ago were about getting out of traditional generation
now even highly integrated utilities like france s edf and czech republic s cez have been presented with scenarios
european utilities are increasingly specialising in one part of the value chain said colette lewiner energy adviser to the chairman of capgemini a consultancy
she said this might be partly because spot markets set the power price and thus integrate the value chain from power generation to electricity retailing
the innogy deal is also notable for its lack of foreign utilities involvement
before the financial crisis european utilities were in a dealmaking frenzy all seeking to buy footholds in other european countries
but most of those deals fell through or turned sour and now only a few eu utilities have a significant presence in other eu countries
investment bankers had floated enel iberdrola or engie as potential buyers of innogy
but none of them materialised as bidders
electricity unlike oil and gas is difficult to transport which is why utilities never went global
and besides the physics politics too has played a part in crimping deals
a decade ago the eu tried to drive politics out of utilities with a push for privatisation and the unbundling of grids
but politics has returned via the back door
germany s nuclear exit spain s unwinding of renewables subsidies and britain s threat of price caps all show the extent to which utilities dance to governments regulatory tunes
roland vetter chief investment officer at praxis partners said that besides valuation and the lack of synergies politics was a major reason for foreign utilities not buying innogy
the moment you own these businesses you are involved in german politics
already is for them it is not an issue he said
german companies have some impact on politicians but not foreigners he said
if say iberdrola buys a german company there is no protection only vetter expects no further major m a deals neither or on a regional scale
that is not to say there will be no smaller deals
in a bid to innovate utilities are buying dozens of small to companies in new business areas such as electric vehicle charging insulation smart meters and energy services
utilities will also continue investing in emerging markets which have huge power needs and more liberal regulation
as new market entrants steal their customers at home european utilities have no choice but to go seek growth where they can find it said montpellier university s jacques percebois
