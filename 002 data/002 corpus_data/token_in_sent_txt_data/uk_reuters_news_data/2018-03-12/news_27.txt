corrected-feature-as india offers up cash and advice, sunny nations form a solar alliance
corrects name spelling in paragraph by huizhong wu new delhi march thomson reuters foundation under prime minister narendra modi india has moved to quickly scale up its use of renewable power
in the year modi took office india had gigawatts of solar power
by the end of it had nearly times that or gw according to industry tracker bridge to india a renewable energy consultancy
now india wants to quintuple that total by a goal once seen as hugely ambitious but now considered within reach by energy experts
progress is clearly happening quickly during alone india doubled its installed solar capacity from gw to gw
india is going to maintain and accelerate the momentum
it will move to be the number two player in the next year or two said tim buckley director of energy finance studies at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa a think tank
in india added the third largest amount of national solar capacity just behind the and china and was overtaking japan according to ieefa research
now in partnership with france india wants to take its growing resources and knowledge on solar power and use it to help other sunny countries jumpstart their solar ambitions as well
on sunday in new delhi modi and the french president emmanuel macron hosted the launch of a solar energy partnership that aims to build a network to help tropical countries around the world boost their use of solar power
in the vedas ancient hindu texts the sun was thought to be the world s soul
in india the sun was thought of as the nurturer of all life modi said at the launch of the international solar alliance isa
these days when we are looking for a way to combat climate change we must look to this ancient perspective he said
as part of the alliance india will offer up to billion in assistance to help with solar projects in other countries the prime minister said
upendra tripathy the director general of the new alliance said it aims solar power in many more countries
everyone has access to the sun but in terms of ability to exploit solar energy that is not equal he said in a telephone interview with the thomson reuters foundation
credit is a challenge
skillset is a challenge
the fundamental issue is do all member countries have equal ability to exploit solar energy isa plans to address that issue in part by creating a larger global market for solar technology that would benefit smaller countries by aggregating the risk and the demand tripathy said
the alliance an effort to advance the paris climate agreement aims to become a network of countries he said
currently countries are full members and another are on their way to full membership
many are developing nations
india s solar push is in part boosted by steadily dropping costs of providing solar energy
to produce a unit of solar power now costs rupees a cost similar to that of more traditional energy sources said kanika chawla the senior programme lead at the council on energy environment and water a partner organisation of the isa
india s transition to renewable energy without shutting down its power plants represents a new model for developing countries going forward chawla said in a telephone interview
but india still gets about of its power from coal although that is expected to fall to below percent by according to the international energy agency
india s power providers largely public companies are heavily in debt and as a result many companies generating solar power are not being paid on time chawla said
india s government also is considering a percent tariff on solar imports to protect india s solar manufacturers something that is causing a lot of uncertainty as investors try to bring new solar projects into the country buckley said
other issues for the nation s solar include the tricky business of figuring out how to integrate renewables into the existing electricity grid and the lack of a business model for such utilities a problem other countries using solar energy also face chawla said
all of these issues have contributed to a slowdown in the pace at which solar projects are being commissioned in india she said
but what the renewable energy future holds for the south asian giant will be critical for the world climate change experts say
as china s economic growth slows india s is heating up along with its energy demand
india is today the top contributor to growth in energy demand according to the international energy agency
it s worth acknowledging the indian market and economy is still significantly smaller than china and it will be for some time to come buckley said
however india is very much wedded to the energy transformation
it s coming straight from the prime minister and the energy minister and the coal minister are very much onboard he said
and especially with the leaving the paris agreement there s a perceived void that some country needs to fill and the international solar alliance is a clever way of signaling climate leadership chawla said
