on july volkswagen hired a law firm to help the company understand its regulatory troubles and lawyers were unsure whether the software would be deemed an illegal defeat device in the united states vw said in the court filing
the court filing further said that hans dieter poetsch volkswagen s finance chief at the time on believed the potential financial risk from regulatory penalties tied to emissions would be around million euros million

volkswagen on saturday reiterated that it had not violated disclosure rules and had informed investors in a timely manner about the financial scope of the scandal when it published an ad hoc disclosure notice on
volkswagen said that although it had admitted to using defeat devices to regulators on it had assumed that penalties would not exceed million euros based on the size of fines imposed against rival carmakers who had committed similar regulatory breaches
because the company had already accrued sufficient provisions for vehicle recalls to cover this amount there was no need to inform investors that profits could take a further hit before september volkswagen s court filing said
