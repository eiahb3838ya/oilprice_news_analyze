australian lng could fuel japan's hydrogen push -woodside ceo
natural has huge potential japan pushing to switch towards a hydrogen economy could use solar to help power conversion adelaide may reuters australian gas could find a big new outlet in its traditional top export market japan as the country pushes to switch to clean hydrogen fuel the chief executive of woodside petroleum said on tuesday
woodside ceo peter coleman said the opportunity was huge beyond by when he expected hydrogen fuel to be in production in large volumes worldwide for fuel cells that could power cars and factories
japan is pushing to power the tokyo olympics in with hydrogen as part of a long term drive towards a hydrogen economy
japanese firms are working on pilot projects in norway and australia to produce hydrogen fuel using wind power and coal
it s a game changer hydrogen coleman told reporters
woodside has discussed the prospects of shipping hydrogen with japan s chiyoda corp coleman said
for woodside the opportunity would be to use gas it produces off western australia to convert to ammonia and then liquid hydrogen to export to japan
it makes more sense to produce hydrogen in australia and then ship it rather than sending liquefied natural gas lng to japan to make hydrogen as the production process requires a lot of energy which japan is short on coleman said
woodside is looking to tap the abundant sunshine in western australia s pilbara region for the energy needed to release hydrogen from methane
as a first step the company is considering switching its north west shelf lng plant to be powered by solar energy and batteries instead of gas which coleman estimated would cost hundreds of millions of dollars
that would be justifiable once australia s oldest and largest lng plant secures gas supply to keep operating beyond
it makes economic sense to do it coleman told reporters
the switch would free up more gas for sale and would also have environmental benefits as percent of the plant s carbon emissions currently come from burning gas for power and running compressors
about percent of gas produced for the north west shelf plant is used to generate power and run compressors at the plant
the main byproduct from producing hydrogen from gas would be carbon which woodside could decide to bury or use for other purposes such as carbon fibre coleman said
