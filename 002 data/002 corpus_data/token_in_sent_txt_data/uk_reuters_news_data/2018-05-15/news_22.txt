norway postpones decision on carbon capture plant, drops yara
oslo reuters norway postponed a final decision on whether to go ahead with a project to develop europe s first industrial carbon capture and offshore storage ccs project after dropping one of its participants yara international
the government said on tuesday that fertilizer maker yara s site one of three industrial facilities identified for the project was not suitable and the project as a whole needed to be more cost effective
governments and businesses seeking to cut carbon emissions have long cherished the idea of storing in the ground rather than emitting it
the norwegian government which has estimated its project will cost up to billion norwegian crowns billion had planned to decide in on whether to invest some of the money for the project but on tuesday put that decision off until some time during or
the other two industrial sites identified for the project are oslo s klemetsrud plant owned by finland s fortum and a site owned by norcem a subsidiary of heidelbergcement
the government also said on tuesday that it needed more time to decide whether to grant support to fortum s project
however it gave norcem s site the green light saying it would grant million crowns million for norcem s project to capture about tonnes of emissions per year
the government said yara s facility was unsuitable due to uncertainty about the plant s future emissions as it planned to replace liquefied petroleum gas lpg with liquefied natural gas lng as its raw material
we agree with the government s conclusion and will discontinue the project a spokeswoman for yara said
the international energy agency iea considers ccs technology to be essential to limit emissions as part of an international agreement to curb global warming reached in paris in
investments in the project at norcem s cement plant were estimated at billion crowns and at fortum s plant at billion crowns the government said in its revised fiscal budget plan on tuesday
it said that while estimates by external consultants atkins and oslo economics showed the overall project costs to be too high to make it profitable for society the government would continue looking for a solution
after the concept studies the timeline for the project suggests that a potential investment decision may be taken in the government said
norway s oil and gas industry lobby welcomed the decision to grant support to norcem but said more capture sites were needed to make the project viable
both the lobby group and a top trade union said they were concerned by the delay in the government s decision
norway aims to take a lead in developing ccs technology
as well as the project oil and gas firms statoil total and shell are separately studying the possibility of storing captured under the seabed on the norwegian continental shelf
