russia's rosneft looks to vietnam experience to help global expansion
vung tau vietnam reuters with sanctions barring russia s largest oil producer from offshore extraction with western companies rosneft is looking to its operations in vietnam for the experience needed to expand its global reach
the southeast asian country is a traditional ally of russia and rosneft is part of a consortium with petrovietnam and india s ongc which last year produced almost billion cubic meters bcm of gas
the consortium provides almost a tenth of vietnam s electricity needs and last year also produced tonnes of gas condensate mainly for the domestic market but some of which was exported to singapore
the project in vietnam allows us to develop operator skills working on the shelf and is also a platform for the possible growth of business in other countries of southeast asia said christopher einchcomb director of rosneft s upstream foreign projects support department
i am sure that the experience gained in vietnam will be used not only for the company s work offshore vietnam but acquired competencies will be applied in the planning and implementation of exploration and production projects in other remote regions of the world he said
sanctions imposed on moscow after its annexation of crimea in have prohibited western companies from working in russian arctic oilfields producing tight oil or deepwater exploration in the country
major exxonmobil decided to withdraw from joint projects with rosneft this year
mervyn goddings head of rosneft subsidiary said the sanctions have forced the company to become more cautious and more proficient
there is mild inconvenience
it means that we have to be a little more astute in how we operate where we buy from
there is plenty of opportunities plenty of diversity
it just means that we have to become more efficient more effective and a better operator he said
no experience is ever wasted
so the lessons that we learn here are carried over we are already a part of the greater rosneft family
we have interchanging personnel
we have russian staff come and work here he said
rosneft said that production offshore vietnam is very profitable
operational costs to produce gas stand at per barrel of oil equivalent half of what it usually costs the company
its vietnamese operations are a legacy of firm which it bought in for billion
rosneft controls percent at block with initial reserves of bcm of gas and owns a stake of around percent in a pipeline that carries gas and condensate from blocks in the nam con son basin to an onshore power generation facility
it also operates block with initial resources of bcm of gas and million tonnes of gas condensate
currently rosneft performs exploration work there
