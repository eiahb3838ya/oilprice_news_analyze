statoil to become equinor, dropping "oil" to attract young talent
oslo reuters shareholders in norway s largest company statoil will approve on tuesday the board s proposal to drop oil from its name as its seeks to diversify its business and attract young talent concerned about fossil fuels impact on climate change
from wednesday the majority company will change its name to equinor and trade on the oslo exchange under the new ticker eqnr
the norwegian government which has a percent stake in the firm has said it will back the move
the oil and gas company said the name change was a natural step after it decided last year to become a broad energy firm investing up to percent of annual capital expenditure in new energy solutions by mostly in offshore wind
the key reason for a company to change its name is when it wants to widen the scope of its activity or direction
another reason would be because it is in trouble and it has a reputational problem allyson a international branding expert and the ceo of international marketing partners told reuters
i don t believe that s the case with while the company s profits are growing again its hydrocarbon business has come under increased scrutiny after the paris climate deal in
a name with oil as a component would increasingly be a disadvantage
none of our competitors has that
it served us really well for years i don t think it will be the best name for the next years eldar saetre statoil s chief executive told reuters
the new name was meant to arouse curiosity among young people so they see the other aspects of statoil including renewable energy he added
technology students became less interested in working for oil firms after oil prices crashed in and renewable energy gained in prominence
statoil ranked in an annual survey of the nordic country s most attractive employers conducted by a norwegian careers website and norwegian firm evidente published on may
in it ranked first
there are signs however that the name change could help it climb the ranks
students who answered the survey after news of the name change found statoil to be between percent and percent more attractive as an employer arne kvalsvik at evidente said
it s likely that statoil s name change will have a positive impact on its reputation going statoil said it remained the first choice among technology students citing another survey by swedish firm universum
truls gulowsen head of greenpeace norway said the name change would not be sufficient to improve statoil s image as long as the firm was exploring in vulnerable areas such as the arctic or the great australian bight
