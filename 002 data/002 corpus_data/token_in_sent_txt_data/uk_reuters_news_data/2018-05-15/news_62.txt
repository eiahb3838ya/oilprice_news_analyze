solar power could save water in thirsty middle east, north africa, analysis says
new york may thomson reuters foundation thirsty middle eastern and north african countries could tap into their potential to cope with fresh water scarcity according to resource experts
water could be saved by switching to renewable solar energy from fossil fuel electricity generation that uses up water said the world resources institute wri
the findings show moving to clean energy has benefits aside from cutting greenhouse gas emissions said tianyi luo a senior wri manager
a lot of times the water savings that kind of benefits from renewable projects are overlooked luo told the thomson reuters foundation
yemen saudi arabia oman libya algeria morocco the united arab emirates and jordan ranked among the top countries measured by lack of freshwater and solar energy potential that could benefit from such a switch the wri said
these countries have resources for both solar and wind that could be put to very productive uses and it could potentially assist them in their challenges said jordan macknick energy and water analyst at the national renewable energy laboratory
fresh and sea water is often used in the process of cooling power plants ubiquitous in the middle east and north africa according to the world bank
put another way powering one incandescent light bulb for hours over one a year can consume to gallons of water according to the virginia water resources research center
solar panels meanwhile require little or no water to install and maintain
yemen an impoverished nation in the grip of civil war topped the wri ranking in terms of water scarcity and how much potential electricity solar farms could produce
saudi arabia the world s top oil exporter ranked third
despite its wealth of oil the kingdom recently stepped up its involvement in expanding solar energy with an announcement in march of investments to create the world s biggest solar power project
the project is expected to have the capacity to produce up to gigawatts by
