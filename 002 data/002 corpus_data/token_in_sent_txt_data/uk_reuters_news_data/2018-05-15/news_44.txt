update 1-german court backs jail term for deutsche banker's role in carbon tax fraud
karlsruhe germany reuters germany s federal supreme court on tuesday sentenced a former deutsche bank employee to three years in prison for his role in a carbon emission permit trading scheme designed to curb global warming but used to fraudulently collect tens of millions of euros of sales tax
the ruling by the federal court of justice affirmed the conviction of helmut hohnholz formerly a regional sales manager with deutsche s global markets division
the court also backed the judgements against three other former deutsche bankers who two years ago received suspended jail sentences
the case of one former employee of deutsche s tax accounting division was referred back to lower court as his active role in the crime could not be fully proven
the case stems from an investigation into carousel trades in the european union s carbon market in and in which some buyers imported emissions permits into one eu country without paying tax vat
the buyers sold the permits designed to put a price on pollution to each other adding vat to the price and generating tax refunds when no tax had been paid
european police agency europol has estimated the cost to taxpayers at more than billion euros billion pounds since
hohnholz had been accused of ignoring all question marks over the scheme
according to the judge presiding the trial he had coordinated the trading of carbon emissions in germany for deutsche and was the culprit not the helper in collecting million euros of taxes
the scheme had been run purely to trick tax authorities out of a total of million euros and had revealed a failure of all security mechanisms at deutsche bank the judge had said at the time
the trial followed a probe that involved trawling millions of emails and thousands of recorded telephone conversations
of the seven former deutsche bank employees originally on trial in frankfurt two had accepted the court ruling while five had appealed it
the prosecutors had also appealed the ruling criticising that four of the defendants had not been sentenced as culprits but only as accessories to the tax fraud
deutsche bank had repaid the tax changed its internal processes and parted with the staff involved
it declined to comment on tuesday
germany s flagship lender is in the throes of a major restructuring hamstrung by having to pay out billions of euros of fines to end a slew of legal rows
