update 4-lava threatens hawaii exit routes, could spur more evacuations
pahoa hawaii reuters lava flowing from giant rips in the earth on the flank of hawaii s erupting kilauea volcano threatened highways on monday raising the possibility officials may order thousands more people to evacuate before escape routes are cut off
lava from a huge new fissure tore through farmland towards a coastal dirt road that is one of the last exit routes for some residents in the southeast area of hawaii s big island
more cracks are expected to open among homes and countryside some miles km east of kilauea s smoking summit possibly blocking one of the last exit routes highway
fountains of magma spouted lava bombs more than feet meters into the air as the molten rock traveled towards the coastal road highway the hawaiian volcano observatory said
mass evacuations would be triggered if either highway is hit by lava said hawaii national guard spokesman jeff hickman
there s a lot of scenarios and roads getting blocked is one of them said hickman standing on highway in the potential path of the lava flow some two miles km away
dozens of homes have been destroyed since eruptions began days ago and officials have ordered the evacuations of nearly residents in the lower puna district of the big island home to around people
the american red cross said people sought refuge in its shelters on sunday night because of worsening volcanic activity
two more fissures opened in the past hours bringing the total to
it s optimistic to think that this is the last fissure we re going to see said hawaiian volcano observatory deputy steve brantley
a similar seismic event in lasted days he said
unnerved by small earthquakes and emissions of toxic sulfur dioxide gas rob guzman and his husband bob kirk left their home in kalapana seaview estates while they still could
we just need the local government to calm down the panic that some of these people are feeling that today we re going to be trapped with no way out said guzman who left behind a banana farm and rental properties to go stay with friends
the hawaii fire department issued a condition red alert on monday because fissures in the southeast area of the lanipuna gardens area were issuing high levels of sulfur dioxide
condition red means immediate danger to health so take action to limit further exposure
severe conditions may exist such as choking and inability to breathe the department said in the alert
while residents deal with noxious gas and lava on the ground the geological survey is concerned that steam could cause a violent explosive eruption at the volcano crater launching a plume that could spread debris over miles km
scientists had expected such explosions by the middle of this month as kilauea s lava lake fell below the water table
the possibility exists however that water may not be entering the crater as feared and gas and steam may be safely venting scientists said
so far those explosions have not occurred and i think the key here is that the vent system is an open one therefore pressure is not being built or developed down at the top of the lava column brantley told a conference call
