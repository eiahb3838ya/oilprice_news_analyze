explainer-from $11 bln trading titan to penny stock: noble group faces crunch as creditors, investors circle
singapore reuters just seven years ago noble group was an asian commodity powerhouse trading everything from soybeans to oil
now it s worth barely million rooted among singapore s penny stocks
noble has posted huge losses provoked by a lack of trade financing and market calls that went sour while also whittling down a mountain of debt
on tuesday it reported a narrower loss than a year ago although saying its performance was still beset by constraints on liquidity and trade finance
shareholder meetings and legal rulings over the next few weeks will decide whether it survives
amid accusations of false accounting levelled in by iceberg research and a legal spat this year a long slide in investor confidence has seen most of noble s market value wiped out
noble has defended its accounting and is now trying to clinch a deal with creditors and shareholders from which if it succeeds it will emerge a transformed company
noble is seeking approval to halve its billion debt in return for handing over percent of equity to senior creditors mostly a group of hedge funds which calls itself the ad hoc group
under that plan its headquarters will be in london not asia no longer controlled by founder richard elman
the deal would leave existing shareholders with just percent equity in a company that has seen its share price fall from a peak of s singapore dollar in to below s
despite its woes noble has so far defied talk of its demise
but to keep going noble needs a majority of its shareholders to approve the restructuring a vote on the proposal is expected in june
graphic the rise fall of noble group scared by the prospect of total loss and lack of any alternate plan the proposal could get enough support company sources say
founder elman still noble s biggest shareholder with a stake of nearly percent would be given a board seat in the new firm
noble chairman paul brough a restructuring and liquidation expert has urged shareholders to support the deal threatening a failure would result in insolvency and bankruptcy
but leading the resistance is abu goldilocks investment ltd which holds percent in noble
goldilocks has filed complaints and lawsuits against the restructuring plans arguing they protect creditors at the expense of shareholders
goldilocks is noble s shareholder after elman and china investment corp which has a percent stake
it s not just shareholders who are unhappy though
one of noble s business partners indonesian coal miner pt atlas resources has also filed lawsuit against noble and its chief executive william james randall alleging it was given false information related to asset sales
shipping indonesian coal to buyers in asia is the biggest remaining business at noble which has said it plans to resist any and all allegations or claims made against it
in its glory days noble employed hundreds of traders with ambitions to rival global rivals like glencore
but with its market value a shadow of what it once was and billions in debt noble has struggled to remain active
instead of trading itself out of trouble it was forced to sell off its core businesses including oil and gas to competitors vitol and mercuria
this as well as some bad trading calls meant noble booked a whopping billion loss in despite a broad commodity market recovery
as a result noble was unable to join a rally enjoyed by rival miners and traders like glencore or whitehaven coal
for now noble fights on seeking to make the best of its new look
earlier in may its gave a market presentation at a major coal trading event in bali at which it described itself as small but nimble and motivated
