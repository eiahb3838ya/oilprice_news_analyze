rpt-column-hedge funds take profits after oil rally: kemp
repeats without change

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london may reuters hedge funds have continued to pare their bullish positions in petroleum despite the continued rise in prices and the prospect of renewed sanctions reducing exports from iran
the net long position of hedge funds and other money managers in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts was cut by a further million barrels in the week to may
the combined net long has now been reduced by a total of million barrels in the three most recent weeks according to position reports published by regulators and exchanges
as in previous weeks the liquidation last week was concentrated in crude while funds exposure to refined products was increased slightly
portfolio managers cut their net long position in nymex and ice wti million barrels and brent million barrels for a third and fourth week respectively
by contrast net long positions were increased slightly in gasoline million barrels heating oil million barrels and european gasoil million barrels
for all the bullish commentary around the outlook for oil prices fund managers appear to be taking profits after a strong rally in crude oil rather than adding new positions
even the threat of tough sanctions on iran s crude exports does not seem to have encouraged funds to increase their exposure to oil
the exception is middle distillates such as diesel and heating oil where global consumption is growing fast inventories are declining and the market is looking increasingly tight
fund positioning remains stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by across the whole petroleum complex and by as much as in the case of brent
while fundamentals still appear supportive higher oil prices are likely to restrain consumption growth and stimulate more supply in the second half of and into
against this backdrop the extremely lopsided positioning could become a significant source of downside risk if and when portfolio managers try to exit some of their positions
as a result most managers appear to be looking to lock in some profits after an extraordinary bull run in which oil prices have risen by percent since june
