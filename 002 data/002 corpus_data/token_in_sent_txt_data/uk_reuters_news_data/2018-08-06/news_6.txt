berlin wants power to intervene if non-eu buyer gets 15 pct of a german firm -report
berlin reuters berlin wants to be able to intervene in investments and takeovers if an investor outside the european union acquires a shareholding of at least percent in a german company a newspaper reported on tuesday
berlin tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of takeovers by chinese companies making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of percent
the economy ministry should be able to intervene if a investor acquires a direct or indirect shareholding of at least percent of voting rights in a german company die welt newspaper cited a draft law as saying
in germany and other countries including the united states france australia and britain there are concerns that china and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers
the proposal to change the german foreign trade ordinance is being coordinated with other ministries and a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year die welt reported
when it comes to companies critical infrastructure or certain areas of other civil technologies such as it security we want to take a closer look in future it quoted german economy minister peter altmaier as saying
until now we ve only been able to make checks when at least percent of a company s shares have been acquired
now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors he added
altmaier said germany still wanted companies to invest in germany but added attentiveness where such investment affects national security interests was part of the social market economy
last week the german government signaled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of german companies in the case of a chinese bid for toolmaker leifeld
that came after leifeld s majority owner georg koffler said china s yantai taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the german government
last month a german state bank bought a stake in grid operator to prevent china s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition
the head of germany s domestic intelligence service has also said that chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from china with an increase in bids
