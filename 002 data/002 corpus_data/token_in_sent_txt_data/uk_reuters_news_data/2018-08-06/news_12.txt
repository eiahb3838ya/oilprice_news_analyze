world at risk of heading towards irreversible 'hothouse' state
london reuters the world is at risk of entering hothouse conditions where global average temperatures will be degrees celsius higher even if emissions reduction targets under a global climate deal are met scientists said in a study published on monday
the report comes amid a heatwave that has pushed temperatures above fahrenheit in europe this summer causing drought and wildfires including blazes in greece in july that killed people
around countries agreed in to limit temperature rise to well below above levels a threshold believed to be a tipping point for the climate
however it is not clear whether the world s climate can be safely parked near above levels or whether this might trigger other processes which drive further warming even if the world stops emitting greenhouse gases the research said
currently global average temperatures are just over above the period and rising at each decade
scientists from the stockholm resilience center the university of copenhagen australian national university and the potsdam institute for climate impact research said it is likely that if a critical threshold is crossed several tipping points will lead to abrupt change
such processes include permafrost thaw the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor weaker land and ocean carbon sinks the loss of arctic summer sea ice and the reduction of antarctic sea ice and polar ice sheets
these tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes
once one is pushed over it pushes earth toward another said johan rockstr√∂m of the report published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences and executive director of the stockholm resilience centre
it may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over
places on earth will become uninhabitable if hothouse earth becomes the reality he said
maximizing the chances of avoiding such a hothouse state requires more than just reducing greenhouse gas emissions the report said
for example improved forest agricultural and soil management biodiversity conservation and technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground are needed
commenting on the research some experts said uncontrolled warming is still uncertain but not implausible
in the context of the summer of this is definitely not a case of crying wolf raising a false alarm the wolves are now in sight said phil williamson climate researcher at the university of east anglia
