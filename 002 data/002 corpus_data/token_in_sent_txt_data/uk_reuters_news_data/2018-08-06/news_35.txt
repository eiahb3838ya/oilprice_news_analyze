update 1-white house to detail implementation of new iran sanctions monday -pompeo
aboard a government aircraft reuters the united states intends to fully enforce sanctions due to be reimposed against iran early this week on orders from president donald trump secretary of state mike pompeo said on sunday
washington s snapback sanctions are due to be reinstated against tehran at edt on tuesday a treasury official said speaking on condition anonymity
pompeo speaking with reporters returning with him from an asian trip said the white house would detail implementation of the measures on monday morning
it s an important part of our efforts to push back against iranian malign activity he said
the united states is going to enforce these despite opposition from european allies trump in may pulled the united states out of a deal between world powers and tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on iran s nuclear programme
trump had denounced the deal reached under his white house predecessor barack obama as in iran s favour
starting this week washington will reimpose sanctions on iran s purchases of dollars its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals coal and software
the united states has told other countries they must halt imports of iranian oil starting in early november or face financial measures
iranian president hassan rouhani said last week that trump s repudiation of the deal was illegal and iran would not yield to washington s renewed campaign to strangle iran s vital oil exports
iran will ease foreign exchange rules state tv reported on sunday in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency which has lost half its value since april due to fears about the return of sanctions
referring to recent sporadic protests in iranian cities pompeo said the iranian people are not happy not with the americans but with their own leadership
they re unhappy with the failure of their own leadership to deliver the economic promises that their leadership promised pompeo said the united states wants the iranian people to have a strong voice of who their leadership will be although he stopped short of calling for regime change in tehran
he later said in a message on twitter that the united states was deeply concerned about reports of iranian regime s violence against unarmed citizens and urged respect for human rights
protests broke out on sunday for a sixth night in iranian cities including kazeroon in the south according to social media
authorities reported the first fatality among protesters with the shooting of a man in karaj west of tehran
but they denied security forces were involved iranian news agencies reported the protests have often begun with slogans against the high cost of living and alleged financial corruption but quickly turned into rallies
pompeo said it would require enormous change by iran to get out from under renewed sanctions
they have got to behave like a normal country he said describing iranian leaders as bad he alluded to trump s suggestion last week of the potential for future negotiations with tehran a notion that senior iranian officials quickly rejected
we are happy to talk if there s an arrangement that is appropriate that could lead to a good outcome he said
perhaps that will be the path the iranians choose to move down with
there s no evidence to date of their desire to change to change their reporting by david brunnstrom additional reporting by lesley wrougton in washington writing by matt spetalnick editing by bill trott
