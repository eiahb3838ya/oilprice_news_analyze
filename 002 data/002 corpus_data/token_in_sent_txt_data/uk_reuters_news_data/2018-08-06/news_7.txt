update 1-ghanaian president sacks energy minister, gives no reason
accra reuters ghanaian president nana sacked energy minister boakye agyarko on monday a statement from the presidency said giving no official reason
press reports said agyarko was removed because was unhappy with his handling of an agreement to extend an existing deal with united arab ameri energy to operate a emergency power plant
the deal has been controversial in ghana with critics balking at a price tag of more than half a billion dollars
asked agyarko to hand over his office to the minister of lands and natural resources john peter amew until a new appointment is made the statement said
the west african country became an energy producer in late and produces around barrels per day mainly from three main fields which also produce most of ghana s gas for power generation
but intermittent power cuts have been a headache for the government as demand consistently surges ahead of supply
