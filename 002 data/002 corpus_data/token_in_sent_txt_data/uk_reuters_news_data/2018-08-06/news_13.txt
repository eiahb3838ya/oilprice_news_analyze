update 2-iran's rouhani dismisses trump call for talks on eve of new sanctions
adds details background by parisa hafezi ankara aug reuters iranian president hassan rouhani dismissed a call for talks on monday hours before washington was due to impose new sanctions in line with president donald trump s decision to pull out of a agreement over iran s nuclear programme
washington has said the only way iran could avert the sanctions would be to agree to new negotiations to abandon its missile and nuclear programmes
in a televised address rouhani said there could be no talks as long as washington was reneging on the deal
if you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife rouhani said
we are always in favour of diplomacy and talks
but talks need honesty rouhani said
trump s call for direct talks is only for domestic consumption in america ahead of elections and to create chaos in european allies tried and failed to persuade trump not to walk out of the agreement under which iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions
rouhani said washington would come to rue a move that had been rejected by other countries
america will regret imposing sanctions on iran they re already isolated in the world
they are imposing sanctions on iranian children patients and the nation he said
the prospect of sanctions has already hurt iran s economy with the rial currency falling this year and the government cracking down on protests
rouhani called on iranians to unite in the face of hardship
there will be pressure because of sanctions but we will overcome this with unity he said
the trump administration argues that the curbs did not go far enough and it wants to force iran back to the negotiating table
iran says that by abandoning the agreement washington has shown it can not negotiate in good faith
last month trump said that he would be willing to meet rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve relations
senior iranian officials and military commanders have rejected trump s offer of talks as worthless and a dream saying his words contradicted his action of reimposing sanctions
