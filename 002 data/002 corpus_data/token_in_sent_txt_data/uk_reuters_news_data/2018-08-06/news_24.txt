feature-villagers 'living between life and death' as pakistan's glaciers melt
badswat pakistan aug thomson reuters foundation when a glacial lake burst in pakistan s northern province in july sher baz watched helplessly as the waters swept away his family home
residents of badswat village which lies in ishkoman valley at the foot of the hindu kush mountain range s peaks were at the mercy of the flash flood that carried off homes roads and bridges as well as crops and forest
thank god we are alive but everything we owned was washed away by the floods when the glacial lake burst said baz a old father of four
although there are several glaciers near badswat village residents said this was the first glacial outburst in living memory
the authorities said the timely evacuation of villagers meant nobody had died
baz said the event had left him feeling stranded
surrounded by mountains and muddy water it seems we are living between life and death he told the thomson reuters foundation
pakistan has more glaciers than any other country outside the polar region more than in the karakoram himalayan and hindu kush ranges according to the pakistan meteorological department pmd
they feed the indus river system the country s water lifeline
but data gathered over the last years shows that all but about of the glaciers exhibit signs of melting due to rising temperatures meteorological officials said
as the glaciers retreat they leave behind lakes supported by ice dams or accumulations of rock and soil
inherently unstable these dams often burst sending huge volumes of water rushing into the villages below them
with glaciers melting faster than before we feel more vulnerable and it seems like we are under constant threat of a natural disaster said another villager shakoor baig
while he is used to coping with floods the farmer said he had not seen anything on this scale
baig who lost his home crops and fields joined nearly residents in badswat village who were evacuated to higher ground where some are living in temporary shelters
trapped between mountains receding waters and damaged roads providing residents with enough food and tents has been difficult said local relief group the aga khan agency for habitat which worked with the pakistani army to aid
such events are just the start said glacier expert and pmd head ghulam rasul
the disasters caused by glacier outbursts in these areas will not stop here
they will continue in the future because there are so many glaciers at risk of bursting he told the thomson reuters foundation
years of deforestation combined with climate change have led to a spike in temperatures in the region which has caused glaciers to melt rasul said
over the past years he said the average temperature in has increased by degree celsius compared to a rise of degree celsius in the regions of sindh punjab and
poor government management of forests and increased demand for timber have seen trees cut down he said even though conserving forests is essential in order to absorb carbon emissions and fight climate change
global warming has direct implications on mountainous areas in northern pakistan because of forest loss
deforestation happened due to the negligence of authorities since people would cut trees for construction and fuel rasul said
the essential thing to do is to grow more forests to mitigate the effects of global warming on glaciers in local authorities said rejuvenating the forest is a priority but replenishing the area would take time
the provincial government has already launched a campaign to grow the forest among other solutions to offset the rapid increase in temperatures in these mountains local government spokesman faizullah faraq told the thomson reuters foundation
with help from the international fund for agricultural development ifad faraq said the authorities were also developing infrastructure in nearby areas in case residents of vulnerable villages were forced to relocate
this is a big challenge and not a matter to resolve overnight but we are moving in that direction he said
rasul said the pmd had installed early warning systems in three areas to notify vulnerable communities of any glacial threats adding that more were needed so to provide sufficient advance warning ahead of the next event
and he said the pmd recommends that communities be better trained in coping with emergency situations
meantime all that villager baz can do he said was pray that his family would survive another day
i worry about the future and how to feed my family since i lost my land and my job ended too
i pray that god will save us from more natural disasters he said
