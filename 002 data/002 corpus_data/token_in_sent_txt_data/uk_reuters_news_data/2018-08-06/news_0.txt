update 2-dominion does not expect u.s. court order to hold up atlantic coast pipe
adds dominion comment background by scott disavino aug reuters a appeals court on monday vacated permits by two federal agencies that allowed dominion energy inc to build its atlantic coast natural gas pipeline a decision the company does not expect to hold up its billion to billion project
in response to the court s concerns about the environment dominion said it would work with the agencies to reinstate the permits for the pipe from west virginia to virginia and north carolina
we believe the court s concerns can be promptly addressed without causing unnecessary delay dominion spokesman aaron ruby said in an email
in the meantime ruby said dominion will continue work in west virginia and north carolina
the company has said it expects to finish the cubic feet per day pipe by late
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
the ruling was the latest victory for the sierra club and other opponents of gas pipelines in the court of appeals
last week the court told eqt corp to stop work on its mountain valley pipeline from west virginia to virginia after voiding two federal permits for that project
atlantic coast and mountain valley are two of several pipelines under construction to connect growing output in the marcellus and utica shale basins in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio with customers in other parts of the united states and canada
in the atlantic coast case the sierra club and others challenged decisions by the
fish and wildlife service and the national park service
the fish and wildlife service issued an incidental take statement under the endangered species act authorizing the company to build the pipeline in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species including mussels bumble bees crustaceans and bats
the court wants fish and wildlife to put more limits on how the company deals with the animals in a portion of the pipeline s route in west virginia and miles in virginia
dominion said it will avoid those areas until the agency clarifies the limits which the company expects shortly
the court wants the national park service to better explain why permitting a pipeline to cross under the blue ridge parkway in virginia is consistent with the conservation and preservation purpose including scenic views of a national highway
dominion said it expects the park service to provide the information and promptly reissue the permit
