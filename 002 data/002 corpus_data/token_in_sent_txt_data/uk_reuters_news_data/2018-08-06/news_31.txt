column-trump's trade war hits the one thing that was working - energy exports to china: russell
launceston australia reuters president donald trump claims that his tariffs on trade are working big time but this ignores signs that the best hope the united states had for boosting exports to china is being crushed as beijing clamps down on energy imports
one of trump s stated aims in launching tariffs against chinese imports was to lower the trade deficit between the united states and china which is in the region of billion a year
the trump administration has imposed tariffs on billion of annual trade with china with billion more due to be implemented in coming days
china has matched the billion and proposed charges on billion more
in a potentially massive escalation trump has threatened to impose tariffs on over billion of chinese goods virtually all of china s annual exports to the united states
graphic trade balance tariffs are working big time trump said in a tweet on sunday
every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the always to our detriment
i say as they come tax the latest chinese response included proposed tariffs on liquefied natural gas lng
the fuel now joins crude oil certain refined products and coal on the list of imports that may be slapped with duties of up to percent
in some ways the addition of lng to the list is symbolic
it s already clear that chinese companies have dramatically scaled back their purchases of energy products
china imported about barrels per day of crude in the first six months of according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
at about a barrel this was worth just below billion giving a potential annual trade of around billion
that may sound like small change in the overall context of trade with china
but crude oil represented one of the few areas where china could have realistically increased its purchases from the united states
china was also the biggest market for crude producers representing about percent of total exports while for china imports were a measly percent of the total
it s likely that crude exporters will be able to find other buyers but they may have to offer discounts or other incentives to build market share
while crude exports to china appear to have held up in august with about bpd expected to arrive they seem set for a slump in september
so far about bpd have been booked for arrival next month according to data and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the gulf of mexico to china s east coast
unipec the trading arm of china s largest refiner sinopec has suspended crude imports from the united states reuters reported on citing three sources familiar with the situation
it is not clear how long the temporary halt will last but one of the sources said unipec has no new bookings of crude until at least october
lng was another product where the united states had real potential to boost exports to china something trump touted before launching his trade war
china has overtaken south korea to become the world s number two importer of the fuel behind japan
rapid growth is likely to continue as beijing continues to implement measures largely aimed at reducing the burning of coal
china s imports of lng were about million tonnes in the first seven months of year according to data representing just percent of total purchases of million tonnes
august s imports are likely to be around tonnes with two vessels heading from the united states to china roughly matching the two cargoes offloaded in both june and may but well below this year s peak of seven in january
no cargoes at all have yet been booked for september raising the possibility that china s imports of lng will drop to zero even though any tariff action still has to be implemented
similar to crude oil and lng coal was another area where trump could have made a difference to exports to china
china isn t a major buyer of coal importing mainly coking coal used in
however with the price of australian thermal coal reaching year highs above a tonne exports of this type of fuel used in power stations would have been competitive
instead coal exports to china appear to be trending lower with about tonnes booked for arrival on four vessels in august down from the peak this year of tonnes on seven ships in april and also below the average of tonnes for the first seven months of the year
as yet no cargoes for september delivery have been booked although this may change since some coal is exported from long beach in california meaning it has a shorter journey time of around three weeks to reach china
overall what the data is showing is that chinese imports of energy are heading lower even ahead of potential tariffs
