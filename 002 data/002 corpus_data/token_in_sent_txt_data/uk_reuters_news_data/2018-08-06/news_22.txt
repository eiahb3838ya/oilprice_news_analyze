today trump saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu have become the symbol of mistrust in the world zarif was quoted as saying
their oppressive policies and violent measures have made them isolated
the world has distanced itself from their hostile policies against a first round of sanctions against iran lifted under the international deal over its nuclear programme are due to be reinstated on tuesday
they will cover iran s purchases of dollars its trade in gold and precious metals and its automotive sector
under the deal between tehran and world powers most international sanctions imposed on iran were lifted in in return for tehran curbing its nuclear programme
saying the deal had failed to address iran s ballistic missile programme its nuclear activities beyond and its role in regional wars trump withdrew from it in may in a move that israel which iran refuses to recognise and saudi arabia welcomed
israel supported the imminent resumption of sanctions
they will compel the iranians to decide between meeting the demands of the united states or risking the regime s collapse and fall
the first option is good the second excellent israeli intelligence minister israel katz said on twitter
shi ite iran has also been at loggerheads for decades with sunni muslim saudi arabia fighting a proxy war in the middle east and beyond that has influenced conflicts in iraq syria lebanon and yemen
these three countries want to create psychological tension against iran we will overcome this period of hardship zarif said
despite efforts by russia china and europe to salvage the deal the trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of iranian oil from november when the united states reimposes sanctions iran s oil and shipping industries
fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in iran in the past days with ordinary iranians chanting slogans against iranian leaders
