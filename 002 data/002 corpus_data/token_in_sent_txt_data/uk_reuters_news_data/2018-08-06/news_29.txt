analysis-friendship no more: how russian gas is a problem for germany
berlin reuters for decades the friendship pipeline has delivered oil from russia to europe heating german homes even in the darkest days of the cold war
but a new pipeline that will carry gas direct from russia under the baltic sea to germany is doing rather less for friendship driving a wedge between germany and its allies and giving chancellor angela merkel a headache
for president donald trump nord stream is a horrific pipeline that will increase germany s dependence on russian energy
ukraine fighting separatists fears the new pipeline will allow moscow to cut it out of the lucrative and strategically crucial gas transit business
it comes at an awkward time for merkel
with the fraying of the transatlantic alliance and an assertive russia and china she has acknowledged that germany must take more of a political leadership role in europe
the global order is under pressure merkel said last month
that s a challenge for us germany s responsibility is growing germany has more work to in april she accepted for the first time that there were political considerations to nord stream a project she had until then described as a commercial venture
most european countries want germany to do more to project european influence and protect eastern neighbors that are nervous of russian encroachment
but letting russia sell gas to germany while avoiding ukraine does the opposite depriving kiev of transit revenues and making it poland and the baltic states more vulnerable to cuts in gas supplies
the price would be an even greater loss of trust from the baltics poland and ukraine said roderich kiesewetter a merkel ally on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee
we germans always say that holding the west together is our center of gravity but the russian approach has succeeded in dragging germany at least in terms of energy policy out of this western many analysts say the business case for nord stream is thin
another pipeline already links russia and germany under the baltic
nord stream will double capacity but future demand is uncertain
on the flip side german industry likes anything that will provide energy more cheaply
merkel s social democrat coalition partners the leading voices in germany calling for a conciliatory approach towards russia are also in favor
the issue has divided berlin s political class
the parties agreed in their coalition talks earlier this year to make a commitment to the pipeline but did not put it in writing
according to margarita assenova an analyst at the centre for european policy analysis who is critical of nord stream russia can double gas exports to europe via existing ukrainian pipelines without building the new conduit
but despite opposition from european partners from washington and from within merkel s party nord stream continues
germany s diplomatic ambitions are being thwarted by the project s brutal business logic
on the other hand it has the strong backing of gazprom russia s energy giant which owns nord stream ag the project company
its boss matthias warnig once an east german spy tasked with reporting on west german business is seen as one of berlin s most formidable lobbyists
the pipeline is one of a network of projects seemingly designed to circumvent ukraine the largest and most troublesome of the countries once ruled from moscow
they include turk stream which crosses the black sea to bypass ukraine to the south
lawmakers say warnig has responded to their skeptical queries about the project by promising to take their concerns direct to russian president vladimir putin adding to the sense that the pipeline serves the kremlin s strategic interests
but for gazprom it makes sense transit across a country with which russia is in an undeclared war is risky and increasingly unreliable as ukraine s pipelines grow older
germany and the european union are attempting to broker an agreement between moscow and kiev to keep the gas flowing across ukraine when the current transit contract ends in
critics say this means european consumers will pay a subsidy to help keep ukraine afloat
in the spd sympathy for nord stream runs deep
gerhard schroeder the party s last chancellor was appointed to senior positions at russian energy companies after leaving office and regards putin as a close friend
for many of schroeder s generation cooperation with russia is in the tradition of the ostpolitik of their hero chancellor willy brandt who defied a skeptical washington to reach out to the soviet bloc now seen as a prelude towards ending the cold war
but a younger generation in the party often critical of schroeder s links to the kremlin is more cautious
germany is bound to russia by decades of cooperation on energy supply but it has to offer something to its western allies too officials say
that cooperation goes a long way last week merkel hosted russia s foreign minister sergei lavrov in berlin
he was accompanied by russian general staff chief valery gerasimov who has been banned from the eu since russia annexed crimea from ukraine in
keeping lines open to the kremlin is popular in germany where polls show people are towards russia than in almost any country
increasingly though officials wonder if germany is not paying too high a price in lost face
