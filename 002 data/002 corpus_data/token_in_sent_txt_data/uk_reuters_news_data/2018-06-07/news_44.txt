australian thermal coal prices surge as asia demand heats up
hot weather in china japan and korea pushes up demand thermal coal market outperforms lng this year close to brent but analysts say coal rally could soon wane by henning gloystein singapore june reuters australian thermal coal prices have hit their highest level since late as the market heats up on strong demand across north asia and china in particular
spot prices for delivery from australia s newcastle terminal last closed at per tonne just down from monday s the highest since november
coal last reached such levels back in early
newcastle is now up by almost percent from the record lows seen in early
with a near percent increase since the end of newcastle coal has far outperformed its main fuel competitor liquefied natural gas
coal is even close to the percent rally in brent crude oil prices which has come on the back of voluntary production restraint by producer cartel opec supply disruptions in venezuela and looming new sanctions against major exporter iran
traders said the price rally was largely down to a surge in imports from china as an early summer heatwave drives up electricity demand for air conditioning and industrial cooling
since april the seaborne thermal coal market has seen quite the move with stronger chinese demand being a key driver said dutch bank ing in a note to clients adding that this was largely down to warmer than usual weather data in thomson reuters eikon showed that average temperatures in china s capital beijing are set to surge to degrees celsius in the coming days which is degrees above the seasonal norm
hot weather is also supporting demand in other key demand regions in north asia including japan and south korea traders said
however commodities brokerage marex spectron said in a note to clients this week that some of the market tightness was likely and could soon wane as the peak of the heat wave passes
ing also said china was set to take a step back from the seaborne market in order to support domestic miners which could put pressure on newcastle coal prices
