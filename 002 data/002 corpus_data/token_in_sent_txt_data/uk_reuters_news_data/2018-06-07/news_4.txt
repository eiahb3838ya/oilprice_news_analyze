wax on, wax off: shale oil's 'waxy' features crimp u.s. jet fuel supply
new york june reuters jet fuel prices are at highs and part of the reason is linked to record shale crude production and the unique properties refiners contend with when they refine that oil
the united states produced about million barrels per day of crude from shale formations in
refiners have been using more of that abundant oil to manufacture diesel gasoline and jet fuel
shale crude is younger than some other types of crude so it differs somewhat from oil from other formations
the oil is a bit waxier like wax applied to skis said john jechura a professor of practice in chemical engineering at colorado school of mines
refiners have found that when making diesel their common product after gasoline they need to take measures to offset that waxiness to make the fuel useable for truck and car engines
one option is to add kerosene and other components commonly found in jet fuel market sources told reuters
however that reduces the available pool of jet fuel at a time when strong economic growth has boosted air travel
even though the shale boom has provided refineries with more domestic oil its properties have introduced challenges
not all refiners can make jet fuel and those that do must carefully allocate resources between jet fuel and its close chemical cousin diesel which is also in high demand
some jet fuel has been diverted to the diesel pool because diesel demand is quite strong this year in the particularly on the east coast said amrit naresh global distillate analyst at esai energy
prices for jet fuel began to rise substantially in april
on april jet hit cents per gallon above the sulfur diesel futures benchmark on the new york mercantile exchange
that was the highest since december excluding a harvey spike last year
jet fuel last traded at cent a gallon above futures traders said
prices have not been this high in june since
with diesel futures at about a gallon that puts jet fuel at a gallon
this summer airlines expect percent more passengers than they carried last summer according to the industry group airlines for america
still high fuel costs are squeezing airline profits
the international air transport association on monday forecast airlines combined profits would be percent lower than it had expected in december largely because of costlier fuel
production of jet fuel totaled nearly million barrels per day in march data from the energy information administration eia showed
imports of jet fuel declined in the first quarter adding to the squeeze
unplanned shutdowns at east coast refineries also helped push jet fuel prices higher this year said sandeep sayal vice president in the refining and marketing group at ihs markit
jet supplies have also come under pressure as some refiners have found it more profitable to make diesel as regulatory costs associated with that fuel have fallen said neil earnest president at consulting firm muse stancil in dallas
for a graphic on jet fuel price differentials see refineries have other options to reduce waxiness earnest said
they can use more specialty additives that cut wax or drop sludgier parts of diesel into other refining units to produce gasoline and other fuels
but jechura said shale crudes tend to have waxy components distributed more evenly through the oil making it more difficult to just heavy components
