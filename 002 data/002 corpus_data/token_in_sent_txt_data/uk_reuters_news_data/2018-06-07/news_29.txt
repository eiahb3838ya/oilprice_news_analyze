graphic china india coal imports vs price by clyde russell launceston australia june reuters coal prices in asia are being driven to highs by a rare combination of simultaneous demand growth in the region s top four importers
depending on the price used thermal coal is either close to a high or near the strongest in six years as china india japan and south korea imported more of the polluting fuel in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in
the australian thermal coal benchmark the weekly newcastle index ended last week at a tonne not far from the hit in late february which was the highest price since march
the daily spot price for newcastle cargoes hit a tonne on monday the highest since reaching in november which in turn was the best since march
lower grade thermal coal from indonesia has also been performing strongly with kilocalorie per kilogram coal assessed by argus media ending last week at a tonne up percent since the year low in
it s still below the peak this year of a tonne from late february which was the highest price since october
no matter which way the numbers are sliced and diced the message is the same namely that coal prices are performing strongly despite the fuel becoming increasingly unpopular in many countries because of its contribution to air pollution and climate change
it s also unusual for the top four asian importers to be demanding more seaborne coal at the same time as is currently the case
china imported million tonnes of coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
this was up percent or million tonnes from the same period in according to the data
india the coal importer after china brought in million tonnes in the period up percent or million tonnes from the first five months of last year
japan imported million tonnes up million tonnes while the region s number four importer south korea brought in million a small gain of tonnes
put together these four countries imported million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year
this has had the effect of tightening the market given the lack of new supplies to meet the demand
in fact exports from the top three shippers to asia have been remarkably flat in the period according to the data
australia shipped million tonnes in the first five months up slightly from the million in the same period in
indonesia managed million tonnes up from million while south africa was steady at million
this means that the increase in import demand isn t really being met by the traditional export powerhouses allowing countries such as the united states and russia to plug the gap
the united states shipped million tonnes of coal in the first five months of with million tonnes heading to asia
this is up percent from the million tonnes it shipped in the same period in of which million went to asia
it s a similar story for russia with total shipments up percent or million tonnes to million tonnes of which million tonnes went to asia a gain of percent
what the numbers show is that even though prices are high and rising the traditional major exporters are struggling to boost shipments
in australia this is most likely because of an inability to boost production quickly enough in indonesia it s largely because the government is mandating that more coal be supplied to the domestic market and in south africa there are infrastructure constraints mainly on the rail system
the numbers also show that currently the price of coal is high enough to make cargoes competitive in asia despite the greater cost of freight
the bulk of coal exported to asia is coking coal used to make steel but with the thermal price above a tonne it s likely that more of the fuel will head east especially to buyers in south asia
