canadian railways woo scarce workers with cold, hard loonies
reuters in a battle to unclog rail bottlenecks that left canadian commodities trapped in landlocked western provinces this winter the country s largest railways are offering c signing bonuses for experienced workers who can hit the rails right away and get trains moving
north america s transportation sector is struggling to hire staff amid rising demand from shippers and low unemployment with some large railroads offering bonuses as high as for experienced train crews in certain states
the bonuses are a new approach for canadian national railway co which is also bringing back recent retirees and has launched a new management trainee program to deepen its pipeline of future managers said spokesman patrick waldron
harsh weather and insufficient capacity snarled service this winter leaving grain and other commodities stranded in canada s landlocked prairies
the strengthening economy across the board makes the overall job market more competitive waldron said
cn initiated the bonuses last year which its smaller rival canadian pacific railway ltd then matched two sources familiar with the matter told reuters
waldron would not say how many cn workers were hired through the bonuses which has not been previously reported
cp declined to comment specifically on the bonuses
cn is rolling out its largest expansion in decades including a roughly percent boost to its workforce over two years by the end of
cp which said on thursday it would invest c million million on grain transport cars plans to hire workers although a spokesman did not specify a time period
cp offered its engineers and conductors a percent salary hike over four years as part of a tentative agreement reached last week
experienced conductors earn over c although salaries vary widely
since new recruits need up to six months of training before hitting the rails attracting experienced conductors who can work immediately is worth the bonuses expense said edward jones analyst dan sherman noting it amounts to less than percent of labor costs
the idea is to get them out there and get the trains rolling he said
but both railways could face stiff competition from the oil and gas sector as rebounding oil prices push energy patch salaries back up to the mark making those jobs far more attractive for workers said recruiters
railways hire from the same labor pool as many oil and gas firms
the global oil benchmark brent charged past a barrel last month for the first time since cheering executives in canada s energy capital of calgary alberta where a shift is underway from survival mode to cautious expansion
oil and gas sector job postings have jumped percent so far this year compared with said matt munro canada manager for recruiter petroplan
pay too is rising with the average weekly salary for a canadian oil and gas extraction employee in the first quarter rising percent to c statistics canada data shows
railway employee salaries by comparison averaged c in the first three months of the year

indeed some newly recruited railway workers are already ready to jump ship
i would go back to the energy sector tomorrow if the opportunity came along one recent cp recruit told reuters
