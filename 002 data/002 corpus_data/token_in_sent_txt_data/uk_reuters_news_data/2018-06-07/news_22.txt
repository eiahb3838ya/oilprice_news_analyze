algeria's bouteflika stops reforms to assert authority amid health concerns
algiers reuters algeria s president abdelaziz bouteflika has stopped unpopular tax increases and reforms to assert his authority and counter doubts about his health amid mounting speculation that he will seek a fifth term analysts said
there has been uncertainty over the direction of algeria an opec producer and key gas supplier to europe as bouteflika in office since has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in
the opposition and some intellectuals have urged the not to run again in next year s polls due to health concerns
imposing his authority bouteflika late on tuesday vetoed down a plan by prime minister ahmed ouyahia to drastically increase duties for passport and other documents to cope with a halving in vital gas and oil revenues between and
he had already stopped another proposal to open up farming to foreign investors to diversify the economy and seek new revenues
with oil prices having recovered bouteflika stopped the plans while announcing social and infrastructure spending worth billion dinars billion to boost his credentials ahead of a possible new candidature analysts said
he bouteflika wants to show that he is the country s ruler said a local analyst asking not to be named due to sensitivity of issue
his move came just a week after a group of intellectuals and opposition figures urged bouteflika not to seek a fifth term
your advanced age and your dramatic state of health command you to not take care of the duties of the state any more they wrote in an open letter
there is no doubt that another mandate would be an ordeal for you and for the country the letter said talking tough in a country where open dissent has been rare since a civil war with islamists in the killed some
bouteflika has yet to say whether he will run again but the ruling fln party has urged him to do so
if he does that would mean stability for the elites of fln army and business tycoons to postpone a potentially controversial succession
but it would move algeria where about half the population is under away from reforms to protect it against future energy price volatility oil and gas revenues make up percent of foreign exchange revenues
ouyahia had launched some steps which proved unpopular in a country where many harbour suspicions towards foreigners a legacy of the trauma of the independence war with france
for the elites political stability for now is key analysts said
while another term for bouteflika could be a source of dismay for young algerians worried about joblessness and austerity it would give a ruling caste of fln officials generals and businessmen time to set up a smooth succession
ouyahia dubbed by some in the fln as a dirty mission man in reference to some unpopular decisions has said he would not run against bouteflika
but by stopping his reforms and making him look weak bouteflika has sidelined him just in case should he have higher ambitions at some later point
bouteflika is demonstrating that he is a man of the people and trying to portray ouyahia as motivated only by unsympathetic fiscal calculations said geoff porter at narco consultancy
