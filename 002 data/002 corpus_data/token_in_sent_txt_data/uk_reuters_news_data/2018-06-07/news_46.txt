insight-billions in u.s. solar projects shelved after trump panel tariff
reuters president donald trump s tariff on imported solar panels has led renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than billion in large installation projects along with thousands of jobs the developers told reuters
that s more than double the about billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports
the tariff s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition
trump s steel and aluminium tariffs for instance have hurt manufacturers of farm equipment made with steel such as tractors and grain bins along with the farmers buying them at higher prices
white house officials did not respond to a request for comment
trump announced the tariff in january over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of america s sectors
solar developers completed installations costing a total of billion last year according to the solar energy industries association
those investments were driven by tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels mostly from china which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal
the solar industry employs more than people about three times more than the coal industry with about percent of those people in installation and percent in manufacturing according to the energy information administration
solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off said zoe hanes chief executive of charlotte north carolina solar developer pine gate renewables
gtm research a clean energy research firm recently lowered its and solar installation forecasts in the united states by percent and percent respectively citing the levies
officials at suniva a solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the trump administration to consider a tariff did not respond to requests for comment
companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy
solar giant sunpower corp opposes the tariff that will help its panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business along with its overseas manufacturing operations
there could be substantially more employment without a tariff said chief executive tom werner
the percent tariff is scheduled to last four years decreasing by percent per year during that time
solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by percent
leading developer cypress creek renewables llc said it had been forced to cancel or freeze billion in projects mostly in the carolinas texas and colorado because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete spokesman jeff mckay said
that amounted to about projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation he said
the projects accounted for a fifth of the company s overall pipeline
developer southern current has made similar decisions on about billion of projects mainly in south carolina said bret sowers the company s vice president of development and strategy
either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money sowers said
neither cypress creek nor southern current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel
they said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later
both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their projects from the tariffs
the office of the trade representative said it is still evaluating the requests
other companies are having similar problems
scott canada senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder mccarthy building companies said his company had planned to employ about people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff
pine gate meanwhile will complete about half of the megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire permanent employees hanes said
the company also withdrew an project that would have cost up to million from consideration in a bidding process held by southern co utility georgia power
it pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the trump administration was contemplating the tariff
it was just not feasible hanes said
for some developers the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the american heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations
that growth was concentrated in states where voters supported trump in the presidential election
south bend developer inovateus solar llc for example had decided three years ago to focus on emerging midwest solar markets such as indiana and michigan
but the tariff sparked a shift to massachusetts where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable chairman kanczuzewski said
other developers are forging ahead keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in
some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before trump s announcement
power global the development arm of korea s hanwha warehoused megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a texas project that broke ground in january
the company is paying more for panels for two nevada projects that start operating this year and next but is moving forward on construction according to larry greene who heads the firm s development in the west
intersect power a developer that cut a deal last year with austin energy to provide power to the texas capital city is also pushing ahead said ceo sheldon kimber
but the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels
the project is due to start producing power in
waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff s annual reductions he said
trump s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended which over time could significantly raise panel production and reduce prices
panel manufacturers first solar and jinkosolar for example have announced plans to spend million on projects to increase panel construction in the united states since the tariff creating about new jobs in ohio and florida
just last week korea s hanwha q cells joined them saying it will open a solar module factory in georgia next year though it did not detail job creation
sunpower corp meanwhile purchased manufacturer solarworld s oregon factory after the tariff was announced saving that facility s jobs
the company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations without specifying how many
but sunpower has also said it must cut up to jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs
jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation industry experts said
heliene a canadian company in the process of opening a facility capable of producing megawatts worth of panels per year said it will employ between and workers in minnesota
the factories are highly automated said martin pochtaruk president of heliene
you don t employ too many humans
