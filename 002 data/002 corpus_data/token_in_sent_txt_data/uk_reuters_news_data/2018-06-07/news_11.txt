update 2-equinor leads oil majors grabbing prime offshore brazil stakes
adds comment from petrobras ceo details of signing bonuses by alexandra alper and marta nogueira rio de janeiro june reuters norway s equinor asa led oil majors grabbing blocks in brazil on thursday snapping up stakes in some of the world s most alluring offshore geology despite fresh concerns about political meddling in the country s energy sector
a consortium of equinor exxon mobil corp and petroleos de portugal made thursday s most aggressive play offering more than three times the minimum bid for the uirapuru block in the santos basin off the coast of rio de janeiro
that meant partnering with brazil s oil company petroleo brasileiro sa or petrobras which joined all three winning consortia in the round
brazil s government collected billion reais million in fixed signing bonuses at the auction
the world s leading oil producers have been spending top dollar to lock up access to brazil s coveted offshore seeking to replenish depleted reserves as oil prices rise
billions of barrels of oil are in the brazilian beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor
unexpected changes to diesel pricing in brazil last month raised questions about renewed political interference at petrobras and triggered the surprise exit of chief executive officer pedro parente who had turned the company around
yet thursday s auction including winning bids from chevron corp bp plc and royal dutch shell plc underscored enduring appetite for brazil s offshore despite any meddling in petrobras downstream business
we didn t really make a connection with the fuel prices and the bidding rounds
it is quite an independent process said anders opedal country manager for equinor which changed its name from statoil last month
ivan monteiro speaking as petrobras ceo for the first time since being appointed on friday said the company would keep seeking to boost its exploration portfolio
petrobras equinor exxon and petroleos de portugal won the uirapuru block by offering the government percent of oil after covering costs well above the percent minimum bid
the uirapuru block is near the north carcara area which the same consortium clinched in an october round
opedal said it was too soon to say if the blocks would be developed jointly
equinor also won rights to develop the dois irmaos block of the campos basin along with bp and petrobras
exxon one of the few oil majors without stakes in brazil s world class geology until late last year has stakes in brazilian blocks after thursday s win
