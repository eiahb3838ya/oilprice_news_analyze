oil majors to bid on choice stakes in brazil's offshore
rio de janeiro reuters executives from oil majors were set to gather in rio de janeiro on thursday to compete for stakes in brazil s oil play home to some of the world s most alluring offshore geology as rising oil prices boost appetite for expensive offshore projects
a record companies including chevron corp bp plc and royal dutch shell plc registered to bid for four blocks in the offshore campos and santos basins part of the fourth auction on thursday
in the layer billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor
brazil south america s top producer has recently attracted record bids from the likes of exxon mobil corp also registered to compete on thursday as oil majors seek to replenish depleted reserves
a rise in oil prices to around a barrel may entice even more interest analysts say
decio oddone director of brazilian oil regulator anp said he expected it to be the first auction where all blocks are sold meaning an injection of billion reais million pounds into brazil s government
brazil has a history of respecting contracts and the assets are appealing said oddone brushing off concerns about a possible impact on the auction from a fresh wave of government meddling in fuel prices at oil company petrobras
a truckers strike over higher diesel prices paralysed commerce in brazil last month prompting the government to announce measures to cut prices for the fuel
this fanned fears of more government interference at petrobras and sent its chief executive officer packing
under current brazilian rules petrobras will likely serve as operator and take at least a percent stake in all blocks it expresses an interest in prior to the bid round
petrobras has raised its hand for the dois irmãos field in the campos basin and the três marias and uirapuru fields in the santos basin
including the fourth field itaimbezinho the areas up for auction make up more than square kilometres and mandatory bonuses to the government range from million reais million to billion reais million per block
other potential bidders include spain s repsol sa france s total sa and china s cnooc ltd
they will compete based on how much oil after cost they pledge to the government
minimums per block range from percent to percent
