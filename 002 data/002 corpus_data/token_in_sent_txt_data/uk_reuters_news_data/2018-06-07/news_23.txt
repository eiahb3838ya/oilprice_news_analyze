exclusive-exxon seeks to sell out of tanzanian gas field - sources
london reuters exxon mobil is seeking buyers for its stake in a large undeveloped gas field off tanzania according to three banking and industry sources as the company focuses on the development of an even bigger project in neighbouring mozambique
the planned sale is an example of chief executive darren woods strategy of freeing up cash and narrowing the american firm s focus on a number of giant projects around the world deemed to have the best prospects including in mozambique guyana and shale
woods who became ceo in january after predecessor rex tillerson retired and became secretary of state has come under heavy pressure from investors over the past year to turn around the world s largest oil and gas company as its output and earnings sagged
exxon holds a percent stake in tanzania s deepwater block field that was discovered earlier this decade
it holds an estimated trillion cubic feet of gas according to the website of norway s equinor which operates the block and holds a percent stake
the prospect has faced repeated delays in recent years due mainly to a lack of infrastructure and regulation for the country s nascent oil and gas sector complicating any sale
the sources said the value of the asset was unclear due to early stage of development and uncertain future
exxon declined to comment
a spokesman for equinor declined to comment on the sale process
he said the company had not changed its plans in tanzania
tanzania has moved down the priority list for exxon after it acquired a percent stake in the area development offshore mozambique billion from eni last year
area holding an estimated trillion cubic feet of gas is one of the world s largest gas discoveries in recent years and far bigger than the tanzanian field
the project is also far more advanced it is already under development and expected to start production in
exxon has also taken charge of the development of the liquefied natural gas plant at the site
