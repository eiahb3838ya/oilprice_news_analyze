finland slashes russia power trading tariffs to ease imports
oslo june reuters finland will reduce the tariff it charges on electricity imports from russia making it cheaper for energy traders to sell more russian power and boost the nordic country s security of supply its grid chief told reuters
the move conflicts with european union efforts to encourage eu members to reduce dependency on russian energy supplies
imports from russia as well as sweden are indispensable for finland to meet its growing domestic electricity needs and to cover its power production deficit but tariffs transmission fees and capacity payments kept russian flows low last winter
fingrid the country s grid will cut russian tariff levels from july onwards
the coefficient a tariff adjustment rate will be slashed to for importing power in hours and scrapped altogether for peak hours
reducing the trading tariffs will in principle make it less costly for traders to import russian power it is good for finland s security of supply fingrid s chief executive jukka ruusunen said
in the power trade finland s imports far exceed its exports but high transmission fees and capacity payments for electricity at times make it unprofitable to send even at seasonal peak prices
high transmission fees that vary depending on finland s and russia s price differences remain a discouraging factor for traders and were the main cause for last winter s low imports but cutting the coefficient to zero could push them up
the transmission fees are dynamic in peak demand even when prices are really high they also grow
that is why we had so low russian imports last winter
but lower tariffs will make imports just a bit less costly ruusunen said
reliability of power supply is particularly crucial to finland as its industrial sector including pulp and paper makers such as upm and stora enso but also for data centres that it wants built
finland which imports up to a fifth of its electricity needs at times of peak winter demand saw industrial energy needs grow by percent last year while net power imports hit a record high
net imports of electricity to finland amounted to terawatt hours twh which corresponded to per cent of its total electricity consumption
about twh were imported from russia
