exclusive-trump requested saudi oil support before iran nuclear decision - sources
reuters a day before president donald trump withdrew from the iran nuclear deal one of his senior officials phoned saudi arabia to ask the world s largest oil exporter to help keep prices stable if the decision disrupted supply
riyadh tehran s arch rival has long been a close washington ally but direct pressure on a member of organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec over oil policies is rare
washington last pressed saudi arabia to increase output in
riyadh has said that even though prices have spiked to over per barrel the highest since the market has yet to recover from a long slump
until the phone call saudi officials had been saying it was too early to raise output
riyadh took this line partly because higher crude prices could help the stock market float of a stake in state oil giant saudi aramco expected to take place in saudi industry sources had told reuters
so there was shock among some of saudi arabia s fellow opec members when it issued a supportive statement hours after washington imposed new sanctions on tehran
it said it was ready to raise output to offset any supply shortage
three sources familiar with the matter said a senior administration official had called saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman before trump s announcement to make sure washington could count on riyadh the de facto opec leader
one of the sources said the call took place on may
the other two did not specify a date for the call
washington was worried that the sanctions would curb deliveries from iran and push oil prices up the sources said
a white house spokesperson declined to comment on whether a call took place
a senior saudi official did not confirm the call but said we were made aware of the decision on the jcpoa joint comprehensive plan of action before the announcement we always have conversations with the about the stability of the oil the saudi statement in may threatened to undermine a deal between opec and its allies led by russia to curb output by about million barrels per day bpd starting from january to reduce a supply glut and boost prices
the deal is due to expire at the end of
opec will meet on june and needs a consensus of all members to officially change its output policy
iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh said last week he did not agree on the potential need to increase global oil supplies
an opec source familiar with saudi thinking said that riyadh and washington had discussed their oil policies before the announcement on iran
you need to work with your partners in dealing with any potential effect on supply that opec source said
the sudden shift in riyadh s public position came as a surprise to its gulf allies who coordinate opec policies closely
some gulf countries were upset that there was no prior consultation with them a separate source said
they felt riyadh had come under pressure from washington and they had not been consulted before public comments by saudi energy minister khalid
falih travelled to russia s economic forum in st petersburg last month and said the kingdom was prepared to gradually ease oil output curbs to calm consumers worries
the shift has also irked some producers outside the gulf
some people felt they were not properly consulted before the comments in petersburg a second opec source said
since the original international sanctions were lifted in january iran has struggled to raise production above million barrels per day
this is due to a lack of new projects
iran would benefit less than saudi arabia from an increase in supplies if it can not raise output as well as receive a lower price for existing production
a third opec source said it would be against the opec charter to raise output just because washington had requested it
for some opec members this is too much the source said
reliance on saudi crude imports has decreased in recent years in part as domestic shale output has risen but saudi arabia remains an important source of supply
the imported bpd from saudi arabia in march having reached a peak of more than million bpd during according to figures from the energy information administration
reuters reported in late may that opec and its allies could raise production by about million bpd from july to address any potential oil shortages
the sources say riyadh s shift in stance was prompted by pressure by washington and other consuming countries but does not reflect concern in saudi arabia that there is a supply deficit
in late april trump in a tweet criticized opec for high oil prices
india and china also raised concerns about high oil prices in separate calls with falih
the thinking before was to continue with the opec deal until the end of the year a fourth opec source said
but then trump and the iran nuclear deal happened and consuming nations started to complain
consumers are very important for additional reporting by timothy gardner in washington and steve holland editing by dmitry zhdannikov and anna willard
