edf must fix flamanville welding before reactor start-up -asn
paris feb reuters french utility edf will not be allowed to start up its new flamanville nuclear reactor without regulator asn s approval of a solution to problems with substandard welding the asn said on wednesday
last week edf said more than half of the weldings on the reactor s secondary cooling circuit did not meet required specifications
it said that did not affect flamanville s safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of
an asn spokeswoman said the weldings problem could have an impact on the calendar however
edf will have to present solutions in a report to the asn which will then seek input from experts in the second half of this year she said
asn will then rule on whether the reactor is fit for service
the spokeswoman said it seemed unlikely that asn would receive a full report on the issue from edf before the summer
