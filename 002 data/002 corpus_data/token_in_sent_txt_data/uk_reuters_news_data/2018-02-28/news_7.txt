rpt-brazil court upholds forestry law changes in blow to environmentalists
repeats with no change to text by jake spring brasilia feb reuters brazil s supreme court on wednesday upheld major changes to laws that protect the amazon and other biomes reducing penalties for past illegal deforestation in a blow to environmentalists trying to protect the world s largest rainforest
congress agreed to sweeping revisions in the law in that included an amnesty program for illegal deforestation on small properties that occurred before and reduced restoration requirements in others
the changes effectively reduced deforested land that must be restored under previous rules by square miles square km an area nearly the size of italy according to a study published in the journal science
environmentalists said that the revised laws known collectively as the forest code would create a culture in which illegal deforestation is acceptable
this awards the guy who deforested awards the guy who disobeyed the law said nurit bensusan policy coordinator at the brazilian organization instituto socioambiental
with this amnesty you create a climate that invites deforestation in the future
it creates the impression that if you deforest today tomorrow you ll be handed farmers and the agriculture lobby argue that the new laws allowed for continued growth of the sector key to the brazilian economy without bogging it down in ajudicating crimes of the past
the court decision has finally brought legal certainty to rural producers by forgiving penalties for deforestation before provided they comply with the law as rewritten in said rodrigo lima director of agriculture consultancy agroicone
if this apparatus had been struck down for example everyone who submits information on the rural land registry could be fined at any moment even as they are complying with the current the protections in question include those that apply to the amazon rainforest the majority of which lies in brazil which is vital to soaking up carbon emissions and countering climate change
deforestation in the amazon fell in the august to july monitoring period for the first time in three years although the square km square miles cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in and targets for slowing climate change
in televised oral arguments attorney general grace mendonca defended the revisions as constitutional saying that they had been designed to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic development
but many parts of the law designed to protect the environment have not been enforced with measures such as a national registry of rural land still not fully implemented
