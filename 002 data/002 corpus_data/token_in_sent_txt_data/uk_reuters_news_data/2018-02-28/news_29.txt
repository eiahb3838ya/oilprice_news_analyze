exclusive-update 2-nigeria's people getting poorer, govt to "muddle through", says imf
lagos reuters nigeria s people are getting poorer despite the country s slow recovery from recession and economic reforms are urgently needed the international monetary fund imf said in a report seen by reuters on wednesday
the fund expects the government to muddle through in the medium term and any progress could also be threatened if elections next year consume political energy and resources the report said
since emerging from recession in the second quarter of nigerian officials have repeatedly boasted that they have set the economy back on track
but critics say much of the recovery comes from a return to oil dependence after a rise in global oil prices and a rebound in crude production more the result of militants in the niger delta halting attacks on oil facilities than of economic policy under president muhammadu buhari s administration
the imf said in the report that the outlook for growth has improved but remains challenging
comprehensive and coherent economic policies remain urgent and must not be delayed by approaching elections and recovering oil prices it said in its annual article iv review of nigeria s economy
higher oil prices would support a recovery in but a outlook is projected for the medium term under current policies with fiscal dominance and structural constraints leading to continuing falls in real gdp per capita the imf said
in the report it identified risks to growth including additional delays to implementing policies and reforms ahead of elections security tensions and oil prices a fall in which could see capital flows reversed
further delays in policy action including because of pressures can only make the inevitable adjustment more difficult and costlier the report said
the lender repeated its call for nigeria to simplify its complex foreign exchange system a bugbear for the imf for more than a year which has left large gaps between official rates and various windows that certain groups can use to get other rates
moving towards a unified exchange rate should be pursued as soon as possible the imf said
imf staff does not support the exchange measures that have given rise to the exchange restrictions and multiple currency the fund further singled out the central bank saying it should discontinue direct interventions in the economy
the central bank of nigeria cbn frequently injects hundreds of millions of dollars into the foreign exchange market to keep its own rates stable
commercial banks struggling to remain solvent were also called out but not identified by the imf including one that the lender said was already insolvent some of these banks are kept afloat through continuous recourse to the cbn s lending the imf said it does not comment on purported leaks
a spokeswoman for the fund said a statement would be issued after the lender s board meets to discuss its assessment on friday
a nigerian finance ministry spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a phone call and email requesting comment
