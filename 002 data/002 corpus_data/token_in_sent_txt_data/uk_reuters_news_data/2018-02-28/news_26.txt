south sudan lawmakers accuse dpoc oil group of dumping old chemicals, threaten shutdown
juba reuters south sudanese lawmakers have accused the consortium running the country s last working oilfields of dumping expired chemicals in the bush and have threatened to shut down production unless it stops
members of parliament s energy committee told the assembly they had seen containers holding old chemicals including potassium chloride in a remote area in the northeast saying locals feared for their health
reuters could not immediately verify the assertion
the dar petroleum operating company dpoc which runs the northeastern neighboring oil blocks and near the borders of sudan and ethiopia told reuters it had no one available to comment
spokespeople and officials from the members of the consortium china s sinopec and cnpc malaysia s petronas south sudan s nilepet and egypt s energy all declined to comment
any move to go through with the threatened shutdown would deal another heavy blow to south sudan s economy which depends on its crude reserves for almost all its revenues and has already been battered by more than four years of civil war
james lual deng kuel head of the energy committee told parliament on wednesday last week that members had found chemicals were being dumped km miles from a village in a location known as the gumry expired toxic chemicals yard
the boxes were left exposed to the winds and rains that might blow and carry the toxic material away he said
the accusation and threatened action mark the first time south sudanese lawmakers have moved to enforce standards on protecting the environment laid out in a law governing the oil industry
the parliamentarians spoke to dpoc staff members at the site according to a report submitted to parliament by the committee members seen by reuters
the lawmakers told parliament they had seen shipping containers filled with expired chemicals that they said had come over the border from sudan
they provided photographs of sacks and containers and in the report said the chemical was potassium chloride that had expired in october
mp susana peter machar told reuters last week her delegation had also seen additional shipping containers carrying expired chemicals arriving in paloich by truck from sudan
she said that if the consortium did not halt what she described as dumping we will force them to shut down oil production and we are serious
the oilfields are the last still operating in the impoverished country after conflict shut down others and froze investment
they are estimated to produce about barrels per day a third of the country s peak reached before the war
