mongolia's oyu tolgoi mine to lift force majeure
toronto feb reuters the oyu tolgoi copper and gold mine in mongolia s southern gobi desert will lift force majeure effective march and majority owner turquoise hill resources ltd said on wednesday that it expected to make up any effect over the next few quarters
force majeure was declared after protests by chinese coal haulers disrupted deliveries by blockading roads near the border leaving oyu tolgoi convoys unable to deliver copper concentrates
force majeure is a legal status companies invoke when they can not make deliveries of a commodity because of forces outside of their control
turquoise hill majority owned by miner rio tinto said the blockade was lifted and the border but ongoing congestion had hampered a return to normal border traffic
a period of consistent convoy crossings and stable concentrate supply chain are required before force majeure can be lifted said turquoise hill which owns percent of oyu tolgoi with the mongolian government holding the remainder
the chinese truckers were protesting increased enforcement of rules requiring them to pay mongolian taxes and social insurance to receive permits to deliver coal a source in the capital ulaanbaatar said in january
the source said mongolian authorities had also stopped chinese truckers from picking up coal from the mine
last week the mine said it would weigh alternatives to guarantee electricity supply after casting doubt on state plans to build a power plant in the region
oyu tolgoi is under pressure to procure power from domestic rather than chinese sources within the next four years as stipulated in a investment agreement
