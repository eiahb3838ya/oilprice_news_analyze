the return of the plants which liquefy domestically produced gas that is then trucked to has raised lng supply in china s interior pushing nationwide lng prices lower
these restarts are also a sign that gas producers sinopec and china national petroleum corp have resumed piping gas to the facilities after the government ordered them to divert shipments from the plants to residential users to make up a supply shortfall during the winter heating season

sinopec and cnpc cut gas supplies to the lng plants to meet the newly created demand from residential consumers
these buyers were converted to gas or electric heating ahead of this winter to reduce air pollution from heating as part of the government s war on smog
the companies could not cope with the extra demand because of inadequate infrastructure and insufficient domestic output
the government rules on the fuel switching also prioritised residential users over industrial consumers
cnpc and sinopec declined to comment on whether they have resumed piped gas shipments to the lng users
more of the lng plants are expected to resume operations in the coming weeks as gas supplies improve said zhang mengjie gas analyst at longzhong information group
data from longzhong shows the lng plants were operating at just percent of capacity last week versus percent a year ago and a typical level of percent
the percent is equivalent to daily output of million cubic metres according to reuters calculations based on overall daily operating capacity of million cubic metres
chinese lng prices have fallen as the plants return to production and as some remain closed for the lunar new year holiday
the daily wholesale lng price index tracking spot prices across the country assessed by industry publication fell percent to yuan per tonne from monday to wednesday
demand from downstream users is not very good now as some of them remain on holiday and won t be back until next week said diao zhouwei a natural gas analyst at ihs markit
with the weather getting warmer demand from residential users is declining which leaves more fuel for the industrial chinese yuan renminbi reporting by muyu xu and josephine mason editing by christian schmollinger
