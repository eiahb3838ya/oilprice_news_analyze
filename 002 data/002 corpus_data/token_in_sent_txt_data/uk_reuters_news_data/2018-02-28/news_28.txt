adds details on each refinery context and quote by marianna parraga houston feb reuters venezuelan pdvsa s refineries will operate at percent of their total capacity in march due to a lack of spare parts light crude and feedstock according to an internal document from the firm seen by reuters on wednesday
the company s refineries in venezuela and the caribbean have been hit by the s oil output decline leaving pdvsa short of the crude grades its facilities need to produce fuels for the domestic market and for export
a severe lack of cash stemming from export and production declines has led to delays in buying spare parts and equipment for needed maintenance while limiting the volume of imported products diluents and feedstock the firm can afford
pdvsa s refining network plans to process barrels per day bpd of venezuelan and imported crude next month a slight increase versus an average of bpd in march last year
that is still low compared to its total installed capacity of million bpd including the isla refinery in curacao
the venezuelan domestic market s fuel consumption which surpassed bpd a decade ago has declined in recent years amid a long economic recession hyperinflation and lack of basic medicine and food which are forcing venezuelans to skip meals and leave the country
pdvsa estimates the domestic market will consume some bpd in march
but because of its refining system s low operating level pdvsa s declining output and pacts requiring the firm to export fuels to repay debts the company will still require bpd of imported products diluents and crude in march the report said
last year venezuela faced intermittent shortages of gasoline and other fuels
pdvsa has ramped up its requests to buy imported crude and fuels on the open market since december
last week it awarded tenders to buy russian oil gasoline blend stock catalytic naphtha vacuum gasoil diesel and components for gasoline according to offers seen by reuters
the amuay refinery venezuela s largest will process bpd of crude next month due to lack of spare parts and equipment malfunctions the report said
that volume includes bpd of upgraded oil coming from the petropiar joint venture with oil firm chevron corp
amuay s flexicoker delayed coker hydrotreater alkylation unit and one of its crude distillation units are expected to remain out of service while its fluid catalytic cracker fcc and two other distillation units will operate with limitations the document said
at the cardon two crude distillation units will remain under maintenance while two hydrotreaters the alkylation units the hydrodesulfurization unit hds and the catalytic cracker will operate with restrictions due to lack of input limiting crude processing to bpd
venezuela s two smallest refineries the puerto la cruz and the bpd el palito will also operate with constraints due to insufficient feedstock and lack of spare parts according to the report
we are considering importing crude for el palito refinery to maintain in service the distillation and medium conversion units the report said
el palito is expected to process bpd and puerto la cruz will process bpd in march
the isla refinery in curacao will process bpd in march due to maintenance work planned to finish in at one of crude distillation units the alkylation unit the fcc the hydrotreater and the reformer
most of the crude input will come from imports according to the document
