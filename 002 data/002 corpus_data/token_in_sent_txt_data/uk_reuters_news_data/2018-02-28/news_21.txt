update 2-chevron board member's tweet questions oil industry's future
houston reuters a member of chevron corp s board of directors sent a tweet on wednesday that questioned the future of the oil industry given the rise of renewable energy technologies
if oil energy consumption is declining and renewableenergy consumption is on the rise what does that mean for the future of the oil industry dambisa moyo an economist and author who joined the oil company s board in wrote on twitter on wednesday morning
the tweet deleted less than five hours after it was posted was accompanied by two graphics produced by the financial television network cnbc
one showed oil consumption slipping from through and the other showed renewable energy consumption rising across the same period
chevron exxon mobil corp and other oil producers have come under increasing pressure to invest less in oil projects and more in solar wind and other renewable energy technologies
an active presence on twitter with followers moyo added several hashtags to her post that have been associated in the past with activists pushing for greater adoption of renewables by oil producers including environment getsmarter and moyo could not be reached for additional comment
chevron said the tweet showed the diversity of thought amongst its leadership
this simply demonstrates that chevron s board takes into account multiple points of view on the important topic of the future of energy chevron spokesman kent robertson said in an emailed statement
moyo who tweets under the handle dambisamoyo is also a board member of barclays plc and barrick gold corp
john watson who retired as chevron s chairman and chief executive earlier this month told reuters last fall that he did not see demand for oil peaking in the foreseeable future
the view is widely shared in the oil industry and leaders of the world s biggest oil companies are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat from climate change policies or renewable technologies
chevron reported a quarterly profit earlier this month that fell far short of wall street s expectations denting its stock price
the international energy agency said earlier this month it expects global oil demand to rise million barrels per day this year
