oil output forecast at mln barrels per day in sonangol chairman targets investment and exploration chairman says debt down to bln from bln in adds sonangol debt figure chairman quote by stephen eisenhammer luanda feb reuters oil output in angola africa s no
crude producer is forecast to total around million barrels per day in the chairman of oil company sonangol said on wednesday close to the million bpd it averaged last year
sonangol s carlos saturnino said he aimed to keep production steady by launching fresh investment and exploration in the sector with angola facing a gradual decline in oil output as aging fields become less productive
the fall in crude prices has devastated government finances over the past few years as oil makes up percent of exports
in angola produced million bpd but output has been partly constrained since then by cuts
speaking at a news conference in luanda saturnino said net profit for sonangol which regulates angola s oil sector was million in versus million the previous year when oil prices were lower
debt in fell to around billion from billion in saturnino said due mainly to a government cash injection of about billion over that period
of the current billion in debt saturnino said just under billion was with chinese banks namely the china development bank and bank of china
it was saturnino s first briefing since angolan president joão lourenço fired isabel dos santos daughter of his presidential predecessor from the helm of sonangol
lourenço took power in september and is seeking to win credibility with international investors and shed angola s image as an opaque oil economy with rampant corruption
saturnino said sonangol had been sick when he took over in november and criticised the previous administration as being on costly consultants and having conflicts of interest
sonangol is sick it has challenges but it s trying to treat itself to muscle and in time it will run and sprint again he said to loud applause from employees
