judge says she blocked louisiana pipeline permit on 'irreparable harm' concern
houston reuters a judge in louisiana who halted development of a section of energy transfer partners bayou bridge oil pipeline last week said on tuesday that her decision was designed to prevent further irreparable harm to wetlands
district judge shelly dick on friday issued a temporary injunction preventing work on an extension to the bayou bridge system revoking a permit and siding with environmentalists and fishermen who have expressed concerns about its potential effect on the local economy and wildlife
the million pipeline which is already under construction is intended to move crude oil from lake charles louisiana to james louisiana and pass through the atchafalaya basin a nearly one million acre hectare wetland that is vital to the state s flood protection system and commercial fishing industry
the court battle renews a struggle between the oil industry and environmentalists who are using lawsuits to halt or delay new infrastructure projects
energy transfer partners faced similar controversy over its dakota access pipeline which was temporarily halted following protests but ultimately began service last year
bayou bridge pipeline respectfully disagrees with the district court s ruling that the army corps of engineers did not properly consider the limited impacts of construction in the atchafalaya basin a spokeswoman for energy transfer partners said by email on wednesday
the army corps of engineers conducted two comprehensive environmental reviews that found no significant impact in the basin she said
a representative for the army corps of engineers declined to comment
energy transfer said this week that it was appealing the ruling
environmentalists and local fisherman say spoil banks created during pipeline dredging disrupt natural water flow in the basin and suffocate crawfish
louisiana is home to large oil refineries and has many pipelines that cut across the atchafalaya basin
the court confirmed that the army corps can t just keep issuing more permits for pipelines in the atchafalaya and ignoring the fact that they are routinely violated jan hasselman an attorney for earthjustice the group representing the plaintiffs said on wednesday
after decades of noncompliance with the law which has devastated the basin there is a glimmer of hope that the oil and gas industry will start being held accountable he added
the association of oil pipe lines an industry group said pipelines have the least amount of local environmental and climate change impacts compared with other transport methods
