update 2-bosch shuns battery cell production in blow to europe
berlin reuters germany s robert bosch the world s biggest automotive supplier has decided against producing its own battery cells saying the billions of euros of investment needed was too risky
the decision is a blow to european politicians and car manufacturers who have called for companies to band together to create a regional battery cell producer to compete with asian players such as samsung and panasonic
given dynamic external market factors that can only be predicted with difficulty it is unclear whether this investment would pay off for bosch and when bosch said in a statement on wednesday
bosch had said it would only consider making battery cells if there was a chance it could capture a fifth of that market by a move it said would require about billion euros billion of investment to create gigawatt hours of capacity
in the overall interest of the company such an investment is not justifiable rolf bulander head of mobility solutions said on a conference call
for new entrants market conditions are more than bosch said it would continue to work with cell suppliers to design cells for and batteries and buy these cells from them
to be a significant player in electric mobility we don t need to produce the cells by ourselves bulander said
the company said it was therefore halting its research into cell technologies which had cost it in the region of million euros and dissolved the lithium energy and power gmbh kg leap joint venture for technology
bosch also plans to sell seeo which it bought in to enhance its expertise in batteries and already has potential buyers said bulander declining to elaborate
separately bosch said it did not expect a decline in registrations of cars to accelerate after germany s top administrative court on tuesday removed uncertainty over the legality of diesel bans in cities
the market is looking for secure framework conditions then it will decide in favour of diesel vehicles bulander said noting current diesel models complied with emissions limits
