oslo reuters greenpeace activists have boarded a rig that was due to sail to the arctic to drill prospects on behalf of oil firm statoil the environmental group said on thursday
we have two people on board and on the water to ensure the rig does not leave port
our activity started at gmt this morning truls gulowsen the head of greenpeace in norway told reuters
we are prepared to stay as long as necessary he added
the action took place at the skipavik yard on norway s west coast where the drilling unit was being prepared for the upcoming work
the west hercules rig belongs to seadrill and is contracted to statoil via its north atlantic drilling affiliate
statoil said last month the rig would drill two exploration wells during the upcoming summer season with options for a further five wells adding the west hercules would provide for a safe and efficient operation
on thursday the oil company said the greenpeace action would not affect operations
there s a contract for upcoming work but we haven t begun any operations yet in that regard
it s from this summer and onwards statoil spokesman morten eek said
greenpeace and other groups in january lost a lawsuit against the norwegian government over the continued drilling in the arctic arguing that the award of exploration licenses violated citizens right to a clean environment
the environmental groups have since appealed the verdict
