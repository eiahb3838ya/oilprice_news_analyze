update 1-macron pushes for eu minimum price for carbon
brussels reuters europe must set a minimum price for carbon french president emmanuel macron said on thursday something that would require a new tax on imports from countries that are not doing enough to tackle climate change
since his election in may macron has championed policies to combat climate change putting him at odds with president donald trump who pulled the united states out of the paris climate accord
macron reiterated that france would increase the price of carbon emitted there to euros per tonne in from euros this year
but he said the carbon trading market was not working efficiently at the european level
we need a european price floor for carbon
i know it won t be easy there will be resistance from all around macron told a conference on financing sustainable growth in brussels ahead of a summit of european union leaders
such a minimum price would incentivise greener investments but would need to be accompanied by a tax on goods from countries beyond europe s borders who do not make the same environmental choices he said
macron also said there should be a target for eu budget spending to help a transition to a green economy and no eu spending should be hostile to the environment
i think a target of percent of the budget would allow for this transition to be ambitious rather than measured as it is reporting by richard lough and vey editing by robin pomeroy
