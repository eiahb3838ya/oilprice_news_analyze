update 2-china partially wins wto case over obama-era u.s. tariffs
geneva reuters the united states did not fully comply with a ruling against its tariffs on a range of chinese products a world trade organization compliance panel said in a ruling on wednesday that either side can appeal within days
the ruling came ahead of the white house s announcement on thursday that president donald trump will announce tariffs on chinese imports aimed at curbing theft of technology
the move is expected to trigger retaliation from beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war
china went to the wto in to challenge tariffs on chinese exports including solar panels wind towers steel cylinders and aluminium extrusions
at the time it said its complaint covered an annual billion in exports to the united states
the wto panel agreed that the united states had not correctly used third country prices to assess the subsidies but supported the assertion that exporters were getting subsidies from chinese public bodies despite beijing s assertions to the contrary
china s commerce ministry said late on wednesday that the wto ruling showed that the united states was a repeat abuser of trade remedy measures and urged it to take immediate action to correct faulty practices
if china s complaint survives a potential appeal it would move a step closer to retaliatory sanctions on trade although the two sides would first have to settle on the value of sanctions which would involve a round of legal argument
the dispute centred on investigations carried out by the department of commerce between and
the products concerned were solar panels wind towers thermal and coated paper lawn groomers kitchen shelving steel sinks citric acid magnesia carbon bricks pressure pipe line pipe seamless pipe steel cylinders drill pipe oil country tubular goods wire strand and aluminium extrusions
many of china s complaints about specific investigations were rejected in the panel s report but other points were upheld
