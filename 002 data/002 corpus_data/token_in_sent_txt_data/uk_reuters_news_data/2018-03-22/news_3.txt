update 4-saudi expects oil producers to extend output curbs into 2019
washington reuters opec members will need to continue coordinating with russia and other countries on supply curbs in to reduce global oil inventories to desired levels saudi arabian energy minister khalid said on thursday
opec and countries struck a production supply agreement in january to remove million barrels per day from global markets and end a supply glut
the cuts helped lift oil prices to current levels of around per barrel
the oil producers will convene in june in vienna to discuss further cooperation
crude oil futures settled on thursday at a barrel and brent crude settled at
we know for sure that we still have some time to go before we bring inventories down to the level we consider normal and we will identify that by when we meet in vienna falih told reuters in an interview in washington
and then we will hopefully by identify the mechanism by which we will work in it was unclear what oil supplies would need to be in he said
falih has previously said that opec would do better to leave the oil market slightly short of supplies rather than ending too early the output cut deal
falih said on thursday there is a general acceptance among producers that further coordination does not necessarily mean maintaining the same level of cuts
it just means that the mechanism has worked and they have committed to work within that mechanism for a much longer period he said
a new framework requires agility and a willingness to do things differently in terms of what levels of production as the market saudi arabia and russia have spearheaded efforts to reduce global oil stockpiles to their average ending years of oversupply sparked by the rapid rise in production from shale oil producers in the united states
despite continued rapid growth in output from the united states falih said he did not consider the shale industry to be a threat
without shale supplies he said global supplies would have been tight
saudi arabia needs high and stable oil prices if it is to succeed in turning the planned share listing of state oil company saudi aramco into the world s biggest share sale
saudi arabia is planning to list up to percent of saudi aramco in the offering
a successful ipo could give the company a total valuation of up to trillion trillion making it the world s biggest oil company by market capitalization
falih said the kingdom may still move forward with the planned initial public offering ipo in the second half of despite previously raising doubts it could be delayed to next year
the timing of a float would depend on market conditions and the kingdom is ready to execute the ipo at any time
we have prepared all documentation to be ready to do both domestic and international listings falih said
we have not closed the door on he said the kingdom needed to be sure that the market is ready and is this an optimum time to falih said the company could be floated either domestically or internationally late this year
new york is still in the running for the ipo but saudi officials still need to weigh the potential legal risks of a listing in the united states he said
we have concerns obviously aramco is too big and too valuable and too important he said
we could be potentially at risk from some frivolous lawsuits and litigation that we have to consider in our final legal challenges could arise from a law that would allow victims of militant attacks to sue foreign governments for compensation
