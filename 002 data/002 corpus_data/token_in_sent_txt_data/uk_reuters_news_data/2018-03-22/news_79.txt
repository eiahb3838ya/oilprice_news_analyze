china's oil futures: frazzle or dazzle for foreign traders?
beijing reuters china s crude oil futures to be launched on monday will be a major step in beijing s push to win greater sway over oil pricing but for western traders it will likely bring frustration as well as opportunity
shanghai crude aims to rival the world s two crude benchmarks luring overseas traders with the promise of a deep pool of liquidity and the chance for arbitrage between asian and european markets
however the contract will also come with quirks that traders used to london s brent or west texas intermediate wti may find less appealing including shorter business hours unique chinese trading habits and extended holiday breaks
trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens will also likely hamper initial on the shanghai international energy exchange ine executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told reuters
the rules around trading methodology will be unfamiliar for western houses said john browning chief operating officer of hong futures broker bands financial ltd which is an approved overseas intermediary for the ine
they ll have to get to grips with a different set of trading parameters including initial margin calculation rolling between months order cancellations ratios etc
it s all very so far china has opened more than trading accounts including the country s oil majors and about brokerages
ten foreign intermediaries have registered including bands financial straits financial services and other hong kong based affiliates of domestic brokerages
changes are still being made to entice overseas users
on tuesday the government said it would waive income taxes for foreign investors for the first three years
specific issues for traders include shanghai s shorter trading hours split into three slots with the afternoon session ending at local time gmt just before london ramps up
although the exchange will have an overnight trading session to match late european and early trading it will close for more than six hours before trade resumes in beijing
this could mean the contract risks having to play each morning to the moods and swings of europe and america rather than setting its own price several senior futures traders said
chinese trading habits may also be a shock to foreign users they said
chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months but instead pick specific months in which they deal due to a different cost structure
that could complicate efforts to trade spreads between brent wti and shanghai
these and other factors mean the contract may have a hard time building correlations with brent and wti that would make arbitrage possible said albert helmig chief executive of financial consultancy grey house and a former vice chairman of nymex
it s a china market with chinese characteristics said helmig
still china offers the potential for a deep liquid market buoyed by an explosion of interest from investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in shanghai zhengzhou and dalian
in the total traded value of shfe s steel derivatives contracts was trillion from domestic investors
this compares with global turnover of more than trillion in international oil futures the world s biggest commodity market
previous attempts at an asia benchmark have foundered
contracts set up by the dubai mercantile exchange a decade ago have not matched brent or wti traded on the intercontinental exchange and the new york mercantile exchange nymex owned by cme group
china hopes it can do better with oil majors like petrochina and sinopec expected to provide liquidity analysts said the contract has a chance of succeeding even if it faces caution
launching a new exchange is enormously complex so if the initial uptake for the contract isn t that strong it isn t necessarily a bad thing said bands browning
