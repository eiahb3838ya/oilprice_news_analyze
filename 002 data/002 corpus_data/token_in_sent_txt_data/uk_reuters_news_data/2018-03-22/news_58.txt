german court says energy regulator's grid fee cuts too high
duesseldorf march reuters a german court on thursday said the energy regulator would damage the profits of gas and power grid operators by cutting the returns on their network investments too severely
the higher regional court in duesseldorf upheld complaints by network companies against the plan in a decision which can be appealed against within one month
the return on equity for operators of gas and power grids is set by germany s federal network agency bnetza which plans to cut the return to percent from percent for new networks and to percent from percent for old grids
grid operators including amprion in which rwe holds a minority stake and which owned by belgium s elia and asset manager ifm investors filed lawsuits to have the decision reversed
the new rates set for five years are to kick in from for gas grids and from for power networks with a one percentage point change cutting sales by an estimated billion euros
bnetza must weigh the potential welfare of consumers for whom the grid fees constitute around a quarter of retail bills against the need to be fair to operators
