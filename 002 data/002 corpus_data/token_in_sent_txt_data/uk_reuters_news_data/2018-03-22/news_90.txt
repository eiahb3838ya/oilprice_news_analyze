column-self-driving vehicles test attitudes to risk: kemp

by john kemp london march reuters uber has suspended road tests of vehicles after the first pedestrian was killed by one of its vehicles operating under autonomous computer control
proponents of vehicles claim they would be safer as well as more energy efficient but those safety claims will now come under heightened scrutiny
in theory vehicles should eliminate several major causes of road traffic accidents including excessive speed intoxication and inattention
but there are concerns about how vehicles will interact with unpredictable human drivers and pedestrians as well as unmapped hazards such as temporary road obstructions
there are also fears about how vehicles would cope with hacking or widespread disruption of their communications systems too much sun could wreak havoc on driverless cars bloomberg march
the accident investigation into sunday s crash will mark an important test of the technology but also of the ability of politicians regulators and the media to think about risk in an intelligent way
all transportation is fraught with risk and road transport is particularly dangerous even with a human behind the wheel uber cars kills arizona woman crossing street reuters march
every year there are more than million reported crashes involving motor vehicles in the united states according to the bureau of transportation statistics motor vehicle safety data bts
in almost people were killed in accidents according to the national transportation safety board
transportation fatalities ntsb
of those more than percent were killed in accidents involving motor vehicles dwarfing the number killed on the railroads marine transport aviation and pipelines
road traffic fatalities included nearly pedestrians over motorcyclists and fatal motor vehicle crashes overview department of transportation
road traffic crashes are the number one cause of death for young people between the ages of and according to the national highway transportation safety administration
and they are one of the top two causes of accidental death for people in all age groups motor vehicle traffic crashes as a leading cause of death in the united states nhtsa
in a worrying trend roads appear to have become more dangerous in the last few years reversing the downtrend over the previous quarter of a century
the number of crashes injuries and fatalities has been growing faster than highway traffic volumes since around
road deaths rose to per million miles driven in up from in and a recent low of in
the trend among pedestrians has been particularly worrying with fatalities surging by percent in to the highest level since
many road accidents have been attributed in whole or part to driver misbehaviour
alcohol was involved in more than fatalities in
speed in more than
and distraction in more than
driving is already relatively dangerous in the united states so the question is whether vehicles increase or reduce the existing risks not whether they can eliminate risk altogether
so far vehicles have completed fewer than million miles of tests cars under scrutiny after pedestrian death financial times march
supporters and critics have long acknowledged the inevitability of a vehicle being involved in a serious accident and eventually being the cause of a fatality
some had hoped vehicles would log million miles or more before the first fatal accident to prove they are safer
but that shows a misunderstanding of how statistics work since the first fatal accident is as likely to occur on the first mile as on the mile assuming the safety level remains constant
until vehicles are tested on actual roads for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of miles it will not be possible to evaluate their safety relative to vehicles
the advent of vehicles poses complicated questions about safety but is no different from any other new technology
every new technology is initially beset by accidents and that has been particularly true in transportation where early steam engines automobiles and aircraft were all initially
all federal safety regulation in the united states stems originally from the response to the problem of exploding steam boilers in the nineteenth century bursting boilers and the federal power burke
the advent of steam engines on riverboats prompted a spate of explosions killing crew passengers and unlucky bystanders
between and lives were lost in boiler explosions on steamboats
between and there were explosions killing people
one particularly serious explosion aboard the steamboat helen mcgregor near memphis reportedly killed people
the many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that portion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities of the country president andrew jackson wrote in his state of the union message to congress in
the fact that the number of those fatal disasters is constantly increasing notwithstanding the great improvements which are everywhere made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances which have made in that branch of science shows very clearly that they are in a great degree the result of criminal that these evils may be greatly lessened if not substantially removed by means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly the eventual response after many years of delay was a system of safety regulation including boiler standards and inspections
the arrival of the internal combustion engine and the automobile generated a similar surge of accidents among drivers and pedestrians and a legal and regulatory response
early aircraft too were far more prone to mechanical failure or pilot error than has been the case in recent years
but no one would now suggest steam boilers automobiles or aircraft are simply too dangerous to be practical any more than in future people will think vehicles are too dangerous
in every case of new technology safety lessons have been learned through a painful process of trial and error that has unfortunately cost lives
vehicles will be no different
the challenge is to introduce sensible and balanced safety regulations while encouraging continued development of a technology that has potential to save lives and bring a range of other benefits
that requires a very transparent approach from the technology companies and a calm and reasoned response from politicians regulators and journalists
