rome march thomson reuters foundation conflicts and climate disasters particularly drought drove the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger up by about percent last year and the situation is getting worse a report said on thursday
last year million people in countries faced crisis levels of hunger compared to million people in countries in and million in according to the food security information network fsin
the fsin is a global project set up to strengthen food and nutrition security information systems that is sponsored by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao the world food programme and the international food policy research institute
we are clearly seeing a trend now from million to million from to million people literally marching to the brink of starvation around the world said david beasley wfp s executive director
we will never address the issues of the day until we end some of these conflicts he added at the report s launch
the fsin report said the rising numbers in were largely due to new or intensified conflicts in myanmar nigeria the democratic republic of congo south sudan and yemen
in conflict will remain a primary driver of food security it said while severe dry weather is expected to affect crop and livestock production and worsen hunger in many parts of africa
yemen where a proxy war between a military coalition and the houthi movement has displaced more than million people since would remain the world s most concerning food crisis the report said
it also singled out eritrea north korea and venezuela as places of concern but said a lack of data made it difficult to estimate the number of people left hungry
the analysis showed the situation could worsen in in at least three or four countries luca russo senior food crises analyst at the fao told the thomson reuters foundation
the fsin uses a five phase scale with the third level classified as crisis fourth as emergency and fifth as
in south sudan we all applaud ourselves because we avoided famine last year but the figures today tell us we might have famine in south sudan in the next few months and this can also apply to other countries russo said
