analysis-can philippines storm survivors hold companies to account for climate damage?
manila march thomson reuters foundation veronica cabe still remembers every minute of the more than hours she and her family spent huddled on the roof of their home in manila in as floodwaters swept past carrying dead bodies animal carcasses and coffins
typhoon ketsana which killed about people was the most devastating typhoon to hit the philippine capital in decades
as the frequency and intensity of storms increased cabe began to speak up about holding someone responsible
in she became a petitioner in a landmark complaint soon to be examined by a national inquiry which accuses global oil mining and cement companies of human rights violations by playing a role in driving climate change
next week cabe will be among more than a dozen experts and citizens to testify that the greenhouse gas emissions of some firms infringe on filipinos rights to life food water sanitation and adequate housing through the growing impacts of global warming
we thought we would die on that roof it was so scary so traumatic said cabe a community organiser
but it also made me really angry can we only pray
should we just accept our fate whenever disaster strikes or can we hold someone accountable
if the carbon majors are causing damage then they can not just carry on she said
the philippines is ranked as one of the countries most severely hit by wild weather by climate change
now disaster survivors and about a dozen rights groups led by greenpeace southeast asia are aiming to force companies to declare their plans to prevent and mitigate the impact of emissions from extracting burning and selling fossil fuels which scientists say are warming the planet
the philippine commission on human rights chr an independent body set up by the government agreed in to conduct an inquiry and will hold its first public hearings next week in manila followed by additional hearings in london and new york
oil giants chevron and bp and miner rio tinto are among the carbon majors cited in the petition
the three companies did not respond to emails seeking comment
but at least half a dozen companies submitted responses in to the commission and organisations backing the complaint outlining the steps they are taking to curb corporate emissions
some firms also argued they were not subject to the commission s jurisdiction nor required to submit to its proceedings
the inquiry is the first time a government agency has accepted and acted on a request for investigation of the environmental responsibility of companies that sell or are heavy users of fossil fuels according to zelda soriano an attorney with greenpeace southeast asia
it s the first case to use the framework to take on carbon majors causing climate change
it is a big deal for a small human rights body in a small country she told the thomson reuters foundation
the commission can only make recommendations to philippine legislators and the business world and has no enforcement powers
but soriano said the inquiry would set a precedent and the commission s resolution and proposed measures would add weight to every existing and future litigation case in any part of the world no matter the outcome
the philippines complaint complements a global upsurge in legal challenges seeking redress for impacts
legal filings in countries from germany to pakistan and the netherlands aim to force faster action to tackle climate change and its impacts or claim damages from energy firms
earlier this month a federal appeals court rejected the government s bid to halt a lawsuit by young people claiming that the administration is violating their constitutional rights by ignoring the harms caused by climate change
in norway activists have said the country s plans for arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation s founding principles to limit warming
according to a study commissioned by the climate justice programme and greenpeace international companies including chevron exxonmobil and bp have contributed a large share of the carbon dioxide and methane emissions causing climate change
the philippine human rights commission will allow companies named in the complaint to present their arguments and aims to conclude its inquiry this year soriano said
it plans to pass a resolution next year
the commission in a statement said the case was novel in its attempt to haul the carbon majors in a petition involving human rights and promote the notion that businesses have an obligation to respect human rights
the inquiry it is hoped would result in the improvement development of measures to further protect and promote human rights in this era of climate change it added
this and other cases attest that governments are not moving fast enough or ambitiously enough on climate said sarah labowitz of the new york university stern center for business and human rights
even if the philippines petition isn t successful on the merits we can look at it as a demand made by people without a lot of power for action by the biggest and most powerful actors she said
the hearings in the philippines come amid rising instances of violence against activists trying to protect the country s environment
the philippines recorded the highest number of such attacks in asia last year
cabe s former colleague gloria capitan was shot dead in for opposing a project in bataan province
but cabe said the fight must go on urging companies to do business in a way that does not harm communities or nature
we need electricity but not at the cost of our lives and at the cost of the environment she said
