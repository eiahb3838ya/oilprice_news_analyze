goldman alumni set up $1 bln macro fund with focus on commodities
lausanne switzerland march reuters jonathan goldberg the founder of one of the world s largest hedge funds bbl commodities is launching a new billion macro fund with his former goldman sachs colleague ben jacobs that will trade currencies and equity indices based on commodities trends
the new fund was launched in march and is in the process of raising million from founders with the remaining fundraising expected to close by the end of the year
bbl commodities itself currently has some million to million under management
the new fund will be a rare beast in the market where commodities are often being traded by macro funds based on trends
but goldberg says the world will face a number of tectonic changes relating to commodities in the next few years that will be so big that they will allow the trading of entire countries based on them
one of the trends he says is the upcoming change in global marine regulations in that will set a new upper limit for sulphur content in fuel used for shipping to cut pollution
the rule will see a drastic reduction in demand for fuel oil currently used in ships and raise demand for cleaner diesel
that in turn will depress the value of heavy sulphurous crude oil from places such as canada as they tend to yield more fuel oil than diesel
what happens to the balance of payments of canada when your main export product gets less value
and who which country and currency does better in this scenario
that is what the fund will be looking at said goldberg
the wall street journal was first to report about the launch of the fund
the impact from new marine fuel regulations might be as big as if not bigger than those from the shale boom on the global oil industry said goldberg
when shale oil production soared in the world had an oversupply of million barrels per day of oil equal to around one percent of demand
but when new marine fuel regulation comes into play demand for diesel will probably increase by about million barrels per day or by over six percent of current global diesel demand said goldberg
he said the fund will be also look at currencies such as the australian dollar and russian rouble interest rates and equity indices across commodity producers
people are saying the world will have a petrochemical boom
so we for example will be looking at what this boom means for broad indices said goldberg
he said the advantage of having a macro fund exploring commodity trends is primarily in having access to more liquid asset classes
the gasoline market is simply less liquid than the canadian goldberg is fairly bullish on oil prices in the short term but in the medium term he expects crude to come under pressure as global demand growth is set to slow opec cuts will end while and canadian output will increase on the back of improved efficiency
