island of plastic debris in pacific far bigger than previous estimates, study says
new york march thomson reuters foundation a giant island of plastic floating in the pacific ocean holds as much as times more debris than was previously thought posing a significant threat to the food chain scientists said on thursday
the garbage patch in waters between california and hawaii consists of fishing nets plastic containers packaging and ropes said the ocean cleanup foundation which headed up a study published in scientific reports an online journal
the research using aerial images revealed the mass of trash is much denser as much as times more dense than had previously been estimated the study said
it s shocking said joost dubois a spokesman for the ocean cleanup foundation which led the team of researchers from seven countries
nearly nations late last year signed a united nations resolution to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea a move some hope will pave the way to a legally binding treaty
the new research estimates the accumulation is metric tons trillion pieces of plastic
most of those pieces are tiny microplastics it said
in another way of describing its size joost said it is made up of enough trash to fill jumbo jets
the plastic has accumulated into a mass due to currents scientists say
the research studied a patch of more than square miles million square kilometers of the ocean
a product plastic disintegrates slowly and one item pulled from the patch was about years old they said
it harms marine life by killing creatures such as turtles and dolphins that ingest it and it harms humans by entering the food chain in the form of microplastics said dubois
we basically poisoning our own food especially for those of us relying on fish for our diet dubois said
