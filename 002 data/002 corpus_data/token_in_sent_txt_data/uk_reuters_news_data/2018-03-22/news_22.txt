london reuters british prosecutors will recover million pounds from a corruption case in which a canadian energy company bribed chadian diplomats in north america the serious fraud office sfo said on thursday following a court ruling
canada s griffiths energy using a front company called chad oil bribed senior diplomats at the chadian embassy to the united states with discounted share deals and payments in return for oil contracts in the central african nation the sfo said
griffiths energy which changed its name to caracal energy inc in pleaded guilty to corruption charges brought by canadian authorities in the same year
the london high court on thursday granted the sfo s civil order to recover million pounds lost in that corruption case after a trial the prosecutor said in a statement
the ruling draws a line under a battle to seize funds from ikram saleh the wife of the former deputy chief of the mission for chad in the united states
saleh has days to appeal against the ruling
a lawyer representing her was not immediately available for comment
caracal was bought by diversified natural resource company glencore plc in
glencore declined to comment
the sfo said it began civil recovery proceedings after the corruption case came under the uk s jurisdiction following the company s takeover
this is a positive result in the ongoing fight against criminals who attempt to hide their gains in our jurisdiction said david green the outgoing sfo director
the recovered money will be transferred to britain s department for international development which will invest in projects in chad that will benefit the poor
