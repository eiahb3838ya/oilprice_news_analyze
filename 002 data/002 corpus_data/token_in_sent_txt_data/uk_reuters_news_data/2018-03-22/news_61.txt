update 2-global carbon emissions hit record high in 2017
london reuters global carbon emissions rose to a historic high of gigatons last year after three years of being flat due to higher energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements the international energy agency iea said
global energy demand rose by percent last year to million tonnes of oil equivalent more than twice the previous year s rate boosted by strong economic growth according to preliminary estimates from the iea
energy demand rose by percent in and percent on average over the previous five years
over percent of global energy demand growth was met by oil natural gas and coal while renewables accounted for almost all of the rest the iea said in a report
improvements in energy efficiency slowed last year
as a result of these trends global carbon dioxide emissions increased by percent in to gigatons a record high
the significant growth in global carbon dioxide emissions in tells us that current efforts to combat climate change are far from sufficient said fatih birol the iea s executive director
for example there has been a dramatic slowdown in the rate of improvement in global energy efficiency as policy makers have put less focus in this carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of global average temperature rise which countries are seeking to curb to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change
at talks in germany late last year among almost nations about details of a global climate accord scientists presented data showing that world carbon emissions were set to rise percent in to a new record
global emissions need to peak soon and decline steeply to this decline will now need to be even greater given the increase in emissions in the iea said in its report
the iea said asian countries accounted for two thirds of the global increase in emissions
china s emissions rose by percent to gigatons limited by renewables deployment and more rapid switching to gas from coal
most major economies saw an increase in carbon emissions though britain the united states mexico and japan experienced declines
the biggest drop came from the united states where they were down percent to gigatons due to higher renewables deployment
the iea said oil demand grew by percent or million barrels a day more than twice the average annual rate over the past decade driven by the transport sector and rising petrochemical demand
natural gas consumption grew by percent the most of all fossil fuels with china alone accounting for nearly a third of the growth
this was largely due to abundant and relatively supplies the iea said
coal demand was percent higher last year reversing declines over the previous two years due to rises in electricity generation mostly in asia
however electricity generation rose by percent due to the expansion of wind solar and hydropower
renewables had the highest growth rate of any energy source meeting a quarter of world energy demand growth the iea said
