endeavour energy kicks off north sea assets sale -sources
london reuters endeavour energy uk has launched the sale of its north sea oil and gas assets at an ambitious price target of million according to two industry sources and a document seen by reuters
the sale is part of group asset sales after endeavour s parent company filed for bankruptcy in
the uk company and its administrators have hired audit firm deloitte as their corporate finance advisor on the sale dubbed project arrow the document showed
information documents for the portfolio which includes interests in five producing fields a development project and some fields that have ceased production were sent to potential buyers in february with bids expected at the end of last month
the sources said the sale price target was ambitious given that some of the fields are no longer producing oil
the transaction could either be a sale of the share capital of endeavour or a sale of individual assets or a package of assets
endeavour energy could not be reached for comment and deloitte declined to comment
endeavour s parent company endeavour international corporation which was founded in the early and delisted from the new york stock exchange in was forced to file for bankruptcy following a sharp drop in oil prices that year
it subsequently abandoned a deal with bondholders to halve its billion debt and instead announced a sale of its assets accounting for percent of the company s total portfolio and the north sea fields
that process failed to attract bidders back then as oil prices remained low
the uk north sea off the northeastern coast of scotland has however seen a flurry of deals in the past two years as longstanding operators make way for a new generation of smaller firms focused on squeezing more profit out of old assets
private buyers such as neptune energy chrysaor and siccar point energy have snapped up unwanted assets from major energy producers which have seen investment fall by around percent since according to energy consultancy wood mackenzie
although north sea oil output has halved from its peak of almost million barrels a day at the turn of the century it has rebounded slightly in the past couple of years as new projects have come on stream
sources did not give any indication on the potential bidders but said that private equity firms continue to have an appetite to invest
wood mackenzie estimates that there are private vehicles with war chests of around billion for north sea acquisitions
