exclusive-us miners' union to endorse two more democrats in coal country
march reuters the main coal miners union is set to endorse two democrats running for congress in west virginia two sources familiar with the matter said on thursday a boost for democrats trying to win over a constituency that voted heavily for republican donald trump in
the united mine workers of america on friday will endorse richard ojeda for representative in the state s third district as well as incumbent senator joe manchin a democrat and former west virginia governor the sources said
they asked not to be named as they were discussing a confidential matter
the union sees ojeda and manchin as supportive of major issues facing coal miners particularly efforts to preserve their pensions the sources said
in addition neither candidate has fully embraced the democratic party s push for climate regulation a sticking point for miners
trump s white house win in was due in part to his promise to revive the ailing coal industry which has lost more than percent of its work force in less than a decade by rolling back environmental regulation
while his administration has chipped away at regulations the coal sector remains in the doldrums under pressure from cheaper and cleaner natural gas more than a year into trump s presidency
republican control of congress will be at stake in midterm elections in november when all seats in the house of representatives and of the senate seats will be up for grabs
the endorsements in west virginia this week follow the union s support for conor lamb in a special election for a house seat in pennsylvania that he won earlier this month
political observers have said that upset could be a bellwether for future races in areas that had supported trump
the umwa had organized a rally canvassing and phone bank operations for lamb
umwa president cecil roberts told reuters that lamb a former marine who wore work boots while talking with voters won because he focused on protecting miners pensions which are at risk of insolvency due to bankruptcies and mine closures
that s how conor lamb was able to swing those voters to his side roberts said
roberts said ojeda a former army paratrooper who comes from a long line of coal miners reminded him of lamb
the umwa has endorsed about three more republicans than democrats in house races so far in this cycle
but the tally will likely become evenly split between the two parties in the coming months as the union looks to races in ohio colorado and arizona said one of the sources
it is unclear how much the endorsements will help the candidates but miners are seen as an influential political constituency particularly in appalachia the epicenter of the coal industry
ojeda currently a state senator in west virginia who is seen as a favorite in a democratic primary to pick the party s candidate on may faces a tough election battle in his heavily republican southern west virginia district
trump won the district by percentage points against his democratic rival hillary clinton in and ojeda himself voted for trump
ojeda did not comment about the coming endorsement but said in an brief interview i m going to fist fight for workers who have been ojeda has said he supports more coal mining especially to fuel steel furnaces but also backs biofuels solar and wind power
in the umwa endorsed a republican in ojeda s district evan jenkins who is retiring to run for the senate
manchin meanwhile has long been the democratic party s strongest supporter of coal interests advocating more production and backing controversial subsidy proposals
but several republicans are lining up against him in the midterm elections
among them is don blankenship a former coal company executive who served a prison sentence for conspiring to violate safety standards at the upper big branch mine where miners died in
manchin s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the coming endorsement
the democratic national committee is not endorsing candidates before the primary votes but the organization likes what it sees in coal country
focusing on middle class families on american workers in these appalachian and more rural areas is something that is successful for democratic candidates to run on said elizabeth renda a dnc spokeswoman
