update 2-cheniere signs 25-year lng sales deal with taiwan's cpc
adds company remarks taiwan context aug reuters liquefied natural gas lng company cheniere energy inc said on friday it had signed a deal to supply taiwan s cpc corp which cpc valued at roughly billion
cheniere said it will sell million tonnes of lng per year on a delivered basis to the oil and gas company starting in
it said the purchase price will be pegged to the henry hub monthly average plus a fee
a cpc spokesman said the billion figure was based on current prices
cpc s company statement on saturday did not provide a monetary figure for the deal
most importantly it helps to further achieve the diversification of lng sources and stability of energy supply into the taiwan market that are among cpc s key objectives cpc chairman tai chein said in a statement on saturday
chein said that lng buyers see qatar australia and the united states as leading suppliers in the future
cpc has already been importing substantial volumes from qatar and australia
the deal is also viewed as an important part of taiwan s efforts to reduce its trade surplus with the united states according to a source familiar with the government s thinking
the contract is a significant boost to taiwan s trade relations with the united states particularly given the trump administration s focus on trade with asia the source said
the united states has become a major lng exporter in the last two years mostly due to the ramp up of cheniere s sabine pass terminal in louisiana
the company is also building the corpus christi terminal in texas
the cpc deal which is through cheniere s marketing arm is not tied to a particular project or liquefaction train
cheniere said the agreement ties up a portion of its portfolio volume on a basis with a investment grade counterparty
the company also retains the ability to use those volumes to support a future train or expansion project
cheniere announced in may that it was moving ahead with a third liquefaction train at its corpus christi project
it is currently marketing its sixth train at sabine pass with an investment decision expected next year
taiwan is the world s fifth biggest importer of lng shipping in almost million tonnes in according to the international gas union giving the island a global import market share of almost percent
the deal comes just a day before taiwan president tsai embarks on an overseas trip to visit diplomatic allies via transit stops in the united states which will be in los angeles and houston where many taiwan businesspeople work in the energy sector
