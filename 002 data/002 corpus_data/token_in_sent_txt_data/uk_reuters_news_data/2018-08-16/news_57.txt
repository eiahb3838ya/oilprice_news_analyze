china's solar giant gcl to make electric car move in new 'eco-town'
jurong china reuters china s leading solar equipment manufacturer gcl is planning a move into the electric vehicle sector aiming to make use of its expertise in energy to gain a vital competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded industry executives said
the firm is currently building a billion yuan million solar production base in a new at jurong near the city of nanjing which will also involve the construction of residences warehouses and public amenities
but the firm is now in talks with auto manufacturers to build facilities and production lines in jurong to support china s electric vehicle revolution tang yanzhe the head of the jurong project told reuters
our investment figures are very conservative and if the car firms come it is a long industrial chain and many supporting factories will also come he said
jurong is part of a special town program launched by jiangsu aimed at encouraging investment in strategic sectors
other towns are focusing on areas like fruit farming automobiles and
but the town s solar panel production line will be completed this year and go into operation at a time when china s solar manufacturers are struggling with overcapacity weak demand and trade frictions
after generation capacity rose by a record gw in the government has also put the brakes on new installations this year
gcl managers said outdated producers were most at risk
the firm will also put only half its new capacity into operation this year so production does not expand too quickly
critics say competition between china s cities and regions has caused overcapacity in a wide range of sectors including steel and solar and electric cars could be next
as many as cities in the yangtze delta region were competing to become car production bases and across the country enterprises had registered different models of electric cars by up from firms and models in just four months according to government data
automakers have already complained that china s regions are distorting the market by giving preferential treatment to local champions and beijing has promised to take action against blind sector growth
tang acknowledged that there were a lot of firms entering the sector but said those without core competitiveness would soon be eliminated
gcl is exploring alternative models to boost its competitiveness and aims to produce batteries that can be rented out to drivers and eventually recycled for use in solar energy storage
gcl s focus was on public transport and delivery vehicles and there was still room for growth tang said
the yangtze river delta is the biggest market for new energy vehicles the customer base is the most developed whether for delivery vehicles or passenger vehicles he said
