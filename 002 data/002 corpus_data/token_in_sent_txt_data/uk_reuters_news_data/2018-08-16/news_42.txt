focus-after kaombo, total doubles down on african oil
graphic of oil majors africa reserves by bate felix paris aug reuters shortly after launching a new project in angola french oil major total said it was searching for more resources in africa including in senegal and mauritania
the company is historically strong in africa and buoyed by rising oil prices and improved terms for its dollar kaombo contract in angola it is doubling down
guy maurice total s head of exploration and production in africa told reuters that the company had completed seismic surveys and planned to start drilling exploratory wells in senegal and mauritania in west africa
he did not give a specific timeframe but a source familiar with the matter said the drilling would begin at the end of this year or in early
total has broken ranks with some of its rivals in recent years and largely ignored the rush to shale
it is looking to eke out conventional oil and gas resources seeking projects in africa and the middle east
the strategy carries risks
it has left the company exposed to political instability that has deterred some competitors
and although production costs in its africa oil and gas operations have fallen from billion in to billion in they remain the highest among six geographic regions total operates in according to its annual report
total started production at the deep offshore kaombo north project in angola at the end of july
it has also announced it will launch another field in the southern african country zinia which is expected to pump oil in
the company has a bigger presence in africa than its rivals although several of them are also major producers there and have invested billions of dollars in recent projects
exxon mobil for example bought a percent stake in eni s rovuma development in mozambique last year for billion
total has the largest proven reserves in africa among the world s top oil companies last year according to a reuters analysis of company statements
with billion of barrels of oil equivalent boe in reserves in africa it outstrips eni s billion
for the african continent as a whole chevron has billion boe exxon mobil billion and royal dutch shell million
investors and analysts are looking closely at whether total can keep a lid on costs in angola where it has struggled to rein in spending in recent years and in needed oil prices at around a barrel to break even
total s maurice told reuters that a renegotiation with the angolan government and suppliers had allowed total to shave off billion from the initial billion budget for kaombo
on zinia capital expenditure was reduced by more than percent to billion from billion he added
while prices have rebounded since the market collapse nothing can be taken for granted said maurice
prices have gone from per barrel to over but we are not going to be bringing out the champagne because volatility is still there
we could still fall back to per barrel at higher oil prices at per barrel you don t look too closely at what you spend said maurice referring to negotiating contracts with suppliers and the government
he said the company s oil price had come down as a result of its cost savings but did not specify the price
the billion kaombo project kaombo north plus kaombo south which is due to start up next year will produce an estimated barrels of oil per day at peak according to total and is expected to increase angola s output by percent
zinia will add another barrels per day
a lot of the majors have had their heads turned by tight shale oil in the but total has not really gone that route
they re still focused on west africa and angola s a big part of that said adam pollard a senior research analyst on africa oil and gas at wood mackenzie
for angola an opec member and africa s second largest crude exporter total s commitment was important because its output had been declining steadily due to the lack of investments in its ageing offshore fields
in nigeria total s egina field is expected to start production in december and it will make a final investment decision on its ikike project this year as well as its lake albert project in uganda
the company expects these projects to help it increase its african production by percent to barrels of oil equivalent per day in compared with
it has also bought oil blocks in guinea namibia south africa and kenya
