update 2-en+ considers move to russia's new offshore zone
moscow reuters group hit by sanctions against russia in april said on thursday it was investigating the possibility of from britain s jersey to one of russia s new offshore zones
group which manages the energy and aluminium businesses of oleg deripaska was one of eight companies with ties to the russian tycoon to be placed on a treasury blacklist in april
the sanctions were related to moscow s alleged meddling in the election
also said on thursday that its board had already approved a move from cyprus to russia of one of its subsidiaries holding limited which manages the group s energy division
relocating holding limited would allow the group to benefit from russian legislation creating a domestic equivalent to foreign offshore tax havens
the legislation passed through russia s lower house in july established two special administrative regions within russia on russky island in the sea of japan and on oktyabrsky an island on a river in the russian exclave of kaliningrad
foreign companies registering in these regions enjoy the benefits of special tax regulations including zero taxes on profits received by way of dividends
since the sanctions group has taken several steps to protect its many hydropower and aluminium businesses
deripaska has stepped down from the group s board
greg barker chairman said the group was an early corporate supporter of the progressive russian legislation that makes this improvement to our ownership structure looks forward to being amongst the first major international russian companies to take advantage of this opportunity barker said
the company also said it remained committed to its listing on the london stock exchange
