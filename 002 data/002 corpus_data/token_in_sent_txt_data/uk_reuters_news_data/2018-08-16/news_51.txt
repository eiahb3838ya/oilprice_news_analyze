analysis-new fuel rules push shipowners to go green with lng
london reuters tough new rules on marine fuel are forcing shipowners to explore liquefied natural gas as a cleaner alternative and ports such as gibraltar are preparing to offer upgraded refuelling facilities in the shipping industry s biggest in decades
from international maritime organisation rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above percent compared with percent now unless they are equipped to clean up sulphur emissions
this will be enforced by fines levied by the imo s member states
using lng to power ships instead of heavy fuel oil or the lighter marine gasoil can reduce polluting emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides by to percent according to industry estimates
the stakes are high
analysts at swiss bank ubs estimate that the green shipping market could be worth at least billion over the next five years
to scoop up some that market the british territory of gibraltar is in the process of launching an power station whose accompanying storage tanks will also be able to be used to refuel cargo ships via barges
gibraltar already supplies the most marine fuel of any port in the mediterranean and aims to do the same with lng said manuel tirado chief executive of the gibraltar port authority
the gpa s aim is to be the number one lng bunker port in the med however this is something that will not happen overnight he told reuters
the shipping industry is under pressure to cut its emissions of the main greenhouse gas which causes global warming carbon dioxide by at least percent by from levels after the imo agreed on a target in april after years of debate
although still a fossil fuel lng emits to percent less than even fuel oil
a period of low oil prices slowed the of lng as a marine fuel
but over the past year as the oil price has risen appetite has grown in the cruise ship industry as well as in the container cargo and tanker sectors
there are currently ships around the world using lng according to ship certification experts dnv gl with between to expected to be delivered by
that is a still small fraction of a world fleet of more than commercial ships
valuation company vesselsvalue said ships with engines capable of using lng would be delivered in the largest annual number to date
over the last year or so there is a growing consensus among shipowners that lng is a reasonable next step
it is gaining traction said martin wold a senior consultant at dnv gl
but the transition to lng will take time with fuels also used to replace heavy oil
by dnv gl forecasts that only percent of energy for shipping will come from fuels
gas fuels will account for percent and the rest will be provided by energy sources such as biofuels and electricity
the global shipping fleet now consumes about million barrels per day of fuel oil
thomson reuters research estimates show fuel accounts for about half of a ship s daily operating cost
one of the challenges in using lng to power ships has been the investment needed to build the required refuelling facilities
in addition commercial vessels powered by lng cost around million more than regular ships
retrofitting is also costly as existing ships require space to install much bigger fuel tanks to keep the gas from evaporating
for gibraltar the construction of the new lng power plant by royal dutch shell will help to create some of the required ship refuelling infrastructure
the lng for the power plant will be used solely for the power plant
however the same marine infrastructure that provides the lng for the power plant will also be able to be utilised to supply lng to vessels
the current focus is to deliver lng by barge said tirado the gibraltar port authority chief
tirado said authorities in gibraltar were working on a legal framework that would allow ships to be refuelled with lng in the near future
a shell spokeswoman said the supply of lng to gibraltar opens up the possibility for other future lng applications in gibraltar such as the use of lng as a cleaner burning maritime fuel
malta is studying the provision of lng refuelling facilities at its ports and other places such as barcelona are working on providing lng bunkering
zeebrugge and rotterdam are already supplying lng via barges
elsewhere several lng bunkering vessels from which merchant ships can refuel have been delivered to operate in locations such as the amsterdam rotterdam antwerp region the north sea the baltic sea and the coast of florida
we are reaching a tipping point where shipowners are starting to commit to ships at scale said maarten wetselaar head of integrated gas and new energies at shell
planning for the to meet the sulphur rules in shipping companies can use fuel install a scrubber and continue to use heavy fuel oil or switch to lng
sulphur scrubbers can cost up to million per ship and will not help lower emissions in the longer term according to analysts at ubs
in the future ships could be fuelled by methanol biofuels systems or hydrogen but these are not technologically advanced enough and very costly
since demand will inevitably shift to compliant fuels low sulphur in the as well as lng the main losers will be refiners unless they adjust their production mix
refuellers slow to switch away from offering heavy oil may also get caught out
french container shipping line cma cgm the fourth biggest in the world has said it has ordered nine mega vessels for delivery from which will be powered by lng one of several options it is pursuing
replacing the entire fleet with solutions will take years so the group is committed to implement several solutions during this period cma cgm said
