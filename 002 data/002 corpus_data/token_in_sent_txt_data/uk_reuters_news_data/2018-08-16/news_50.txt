column-best commodity bets? exposed to china and less open to trade: russell
launceston australia reuters the recent gyrations in the world economy around turkey s currency and the escalating trade dispute have taken a toll on commodity prices especially industrial metals
however while sentiment can clearly pummel markets over a longer period of time not all commodities will be equally affected by the changing global economic dynamics
the key to which commodities are likely to perform better is china which is the world s largest commodity importer
even if the chinese economy does struggle under the weight of the trade barriers erected by president donald trump there are still likely to be commodities that can hold their own
the key is to look for commodities that are likely to remain in relatively high demand and are subject to supply constraints
on this basis coal becomes the darling of the commodity complex as chinese import demand has been robust and will likely remain so as beijing cuts back on domestic output as part of efforts to cut pollution
china s coal imports surged percent to million tonnes in the first seven months of the year from the same period last year according to customs data
and it s not just china boosting coal with the world s importer india also increasing overseas purchases by about percent in the first seven months to about million tonnes
while it s true that chinese import demand for coal has been partially driven by higher power generation because of the recent heatwave the market may also be changing from a structural perspective
china s coal output fell percent in july from the prior month to million tonnes the lowest in two years the national bureau of statistics said on
while coal has in recent weeks reached year highs of around a tonne china is also importing more natural gas both in a liquefied state on ships and by pipeline from neighbouring countries
imports of pipeline and liquefied natural gas lng rose percent in the first seven months of the year to million tonnes according to customs data
while the rate of growth has slowed from s breakneck speed china is still increasing its demand for natural gas at a pace that is rapidly eating away expectations of an oversupplied lng market after the commissioning of several new projects in australia and the united states
however coal is still a better bet than lng from a supply perspective with major exporters australia indonesia and south africa all largely unable to boost exports as mines are already running at capacity and new projects have been lacking
only the united states can realistically supply much more coal to the global market and its exports to china are now uncompetitive after beijing slapped a tariff on them in retaliation for tariffs on its goods
the other commodities that china may exert a positive influence upon are those most likely to benefit from the current in infrastructure spending most likely iron ore coking coal and steel
beijing has once again opened the fiscal taps in an effort to counteract any economic slowing caused by the trade dispute with the administration of president donald trump
china rolled out a billion urban railway plan on and pushed local governments to speed up the issuance of special infrastructure bonds amid fears of a slowdown in fixed asset investment which grew at percent in the first seven months of the year below market expectations
while these and other measures do little to ease worries about credit quality in china from a commodity perspective they are likely to underpin demand for the steel complex and perhaps to a lesser extent copper which is also used in construction for wiring
another factor worth noting is that while the commodities likely to perform better on the back of chinese demand are all tradable they are nowhere near as liquid as the ones that may underperform
crude oil natural gas copper and other metals such as zinc and nickel all have deep and liquid futures markets
while paper coal markets are well established they are tiny in comparison and the same can be said for iron ore and lng
they key to success in commodity markets in what may be challenging times ahead may lie in being a commodity that remains in demand in china and is less accessible to your average investor
