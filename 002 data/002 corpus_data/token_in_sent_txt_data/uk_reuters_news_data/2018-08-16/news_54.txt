judge orders keystone xl pipeline review in setback for trump
washington aug reuters a federal judge in montana on wednesday ordered the state department to do a full environmental review of a revised route for the keystone xl crude oil pipeline a move that could delay the project and prove a setback for the trump administration
for more than a decade environmentalists tribal groups and ranchers have fought the pipeline to carry heavy crude to steele city in nebraska from canada s oilsands in alberta
district court judge brian morris ruled for the indigenous environmental network and other plaintiffs ordering the review of a revised pipeline route through nebraska to supplement one the department did on the original path in
in his ruling morris said the state department was obligated to analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision to issue a permit for the pipeline last year
supporting the project are canadian oil producers who face price discounts over transport bottlenecks and oil interests and pipeline builders
transcanada corp which wants to build keystone xl did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling
it hopes to start preliminary work in montana in coming months and begin construction in the second quarter of
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did the state department
the ruling was a rejection of the trump administration s attempt to flout the law and force keystone xl on the american people said jackie prange a lawyer for the natural resources defense council an environmental group
in then president barack obama a democrat rejected the pipeline saying it would add to emissions that cause climate change and would mostly benefit canadians
president donald trump a republican pushed to approve the pipeline soon after he took office
a state department official signed a presidential permit in allowing the line to move forward
however morris declined the plaintiff s request to vacate that permit which was based on the review
last year nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the pipeline which will cost transcanada millions of dollars more than the original path
in a draft environmental assessment last month the state department said keystone xl would cause no major harm to water supplies or wildlife
that review is less than the full environmental impact statement morris ordered
