u.s. safety board links plugged drill pipe to oklahoma well fire
houston aug reuters there were signs that a natural gas well was not fully sealed before it exploded in january killing five workers the chemical safety board said in an updated report on the accident on thursday
the incident which took place at a pittsburg county oklahoma well being drilled for producer red mountain energy by drilling contractor was the deadliest drilling accident since the deepwater horizon rig explosion which killed people
the csb s chronology of events in the hours leading to the fatal blowout and fire showed a drill pipe was removed before it was fully emptied of the mud used to seal a well
later a mud pit at the site accumulated barrels of the material providing an indication of a possible gas influx in the well the report said
the report does not specifically say what caused the blast
the csb investigates major industrial accidents and makes recommendations to prevent future incidents
drilling said in a statement that it is cooperating with the csb
we value the perspective of outside stakeholders and will be working with the csb to understand their potential recommendations when they are available at the conclusion of the investigation a spokeswoman said
an attorney representing the family of one victim of the explosion said the report illustrates the safety failures that led up to the explosion
ten hours before it blew there were warning signs said michael lyons an attorney representing the family of parker waldridge a consultant killed in the accident
at this point the well should have been shut in
the mud pit gains were a big deal lyons said
