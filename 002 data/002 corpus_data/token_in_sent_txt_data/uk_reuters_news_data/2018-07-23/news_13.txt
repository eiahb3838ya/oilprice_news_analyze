the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london july reuters hedge fund managers have slashed bullish long positions in petroleum at the fastest rate in more than a year as the gentle in previous weeks turned into a rush for the exit
hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by million barrels in the week to july
net long positions were reduced by the number of barrels on record according to an analysis of data published by regulators and exchanges going back to the first quarter of
the net long position in petroleum was cut below billion barrels for the first time since the middle of september
the reduction was concentrated on the long side of the market where positions were slashed by million barrels as managers took profits after the rally in oil prices
short positions rose by just million barrels and remain close to lows confirming the shift in net positioning is being driven by rather than any newfound bearishness
long liquidation was concentrated in brent with net long positions in the north sea benchmark cut by million barrels the largest reduction since the series began in
but portfolio managers also cut net long positions in nymex and ice wti million barrels gasoline million barrels heating oil million barrels and european gasoil million barrels
hedge fund managers hold most of their positions in futures and options with a relatively short duration to expiry since these tend to offer the most liquidity so the has hit contracts especially hard
brent liquidation has therefore crushed the calendar spreads with contracts nearest to expiry now trading in contango and the whole of the first six months in a backwardation of less than cents per barrel
the accelerating in petroleum futures and options is not entirely surprising and conforms to a common pattern in financial markets
the sharpest liquidation and price falls come not straight after prices peak but when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent
benchmark brent prices have repeatedly failed to break up through the peak of just over per barrel set in may
fund managers are still essentially bullish towards the outlook for oil prices but the extremely stretched positioning during the first quarter has been partially corrected
portfolio managers hold more than eight bullish long positions for every short bearish position in the petroleum complex but the ratio is down from almost in the middle of april
in brent the ratio of hedge fund longs to shorts is down to from in late april in european gasoil the ratio is down to from in late may
for most market analysts and traders the oil market outlook remains fundamentally tight with strong growth in consumption while production continues to be disrupted by problems in venezuela and libya
pipeline capacity shortages in the united states may limit further growth in production from the prolific permian basin later in and early
on top of all this sanctions on iran threaten to remove millions more barrels from the market from the start of november though how many remains unclear
but the sharp rise in output and exports from saudi arabia in june and july has increased the availability of crude in the near term contributing to the in brent calendar spreads
and there are growing concerns about the combined impact of high oil prices a strengthening dollar and trade tensions on the health of the global economy and oil consumption in the rest of and
in the circumstances many fund managers have chosen to reduce their long exposure to oil without choosing to go short yet in a classic long liquidation cycle
