insight-sink or swim? islands innovate to thrive in a high-stress world
barcelona july thomson reuters foundation when the caribbean island of barbuda was battered by hurricane irma last september about percent of homes were destroyed or damaged and the entire population had to be evacuated
since the school year ended last month the pace of families returning from neighbouring antigua where many lodged with relatives or in centres has picked up even though reconstruction is unfinished the red cross said
almost half of barbuda s roughly people have gone back as the nation works on ways to protect people from future disasters while waiting for promised aid funds to rebuild homes which could take years
it s going to be a long and painful process antigua and barbuda prime minister gaston browne told the thomson reuters foundation
we just have to rely mostly on our resources and to find creative ways to generate income to continue the recovery in the face of serious and growing threats experts detect a sea change in many of the world s small island states and other remote island economies that share development challenges
they are finding innovative alternatives to lurching from one crisis to the next whether the problem is extreme weather mass tourism plastic waste water shortages or migration
barbuda aware it will take time to get back on its feet even as this year s hurricane season began in june aims to stay safer in future like many of its caribbean neighbours
brennan banks red cross operations manager for the irma response said the aid agency plans to build a new office on barbuda that can double up as an emergency shelter
it is also offering free training to locals and fixing up systems while working with the government to improve early warning on the two islands
such solutions often developed at least partly with islands themselves are already improving lives and protecting communities and environments on a small scale
but their fledging efforts need far more funding to make a difference and lessons learned in these living laboratories must be shared widely say officials and resilience experts
hugh riley of the caribbean tourism organization believes the region is better prepared for this year s hurricane season even if it is still vulnerable
every time we have an incident of some kind we learn from it he said
the whole business of rebuilding stronger has resonated with us rebuilding better has resonated with us rebuilding smarter has resonated with recent improvements include better government coordination communications systems that work more smoothly and faster evacuation plans he said
according to a june report from the world bank building back from a disaster stronger faster and in a way that includes everybody can yield major dividends for small island nations
doing so would reduce losses in people s wellbeing by an average percent across a sample of island states it said compared with percent for all countries in the study
for antigua and barbuda the reduction would be as large as percent
stephane hallegatte said the benefits of reconstruction that also protects against future disasters are comparatively large for small islands because they face a high level of risk and exposure to storms and other natural threats
many tend to have housing unable to resist even moderate hazards the world bank economist noted
there is a lot of potential for improvement he said
there are very cheap those can be as simple as giving local people who repair their own homes tougher roofing materials and teaching them how to attach the roof more firmly so it stays on in high winds
when the british virgin islands were blasted by hurricane irma in september more than a third of the territory s homes were destroyed or sustained major damage authorities say
construction workers have flocked in from all corners of the caribbean working marathon shifts to rebuild
but materials from windows to plywood and galvanised roofing are only arriving in dribs and drabs from puerto rico and the mainland with delays of up to three months
the government is working on a new building code tailored to more extreme weather and has set up a assistance programme to help lagging residents build back
yet some in the relatively affluent british overseas territory which has a population of just are falling through the cracks
it s as if the hurricane happened yesterday said government employee albert wheatley surveying the debris of his pink wooden house now overgrown with weeds
and i don t know when this will one way to cut long waits for financial help after a disaster is to use social welfare systems to channel cash to recipients said the world bank s hallegatte
after cyclone winston hit fiji in february the government used its three main social assistance programmes to deliver payments equivalent to three months of regular benefit to help residents recover
but many small island states have very little in terms of social welfare hallegatte noted
disasters can trigger the establishment of such schemes however and the world bank is now seeing greater government interest he said
if there is one place on earth where you really want to design your social protection system considering natural disasters that will be small islands he added
resilience advisor stewart said helping islands withstand the pressures they face requires a broad view encompassing everything from nature and culture to economics and the law
the island resilience initiative he leads is working with palau the marshall islands and fiji in the pacific to track their progress towards the global development goals agreed by the members in and decide on priority projects
the aim is to pave the way to an approach much more angled on resilience and precovery rather than constantly talking about recovery after disasters said
in the british virgin islands resort of cane garden bay the onslaught of hurricane irma made residents realise rapid development to cater for mass tourists disgorged by cruise ships had damaged their natural defences putting them in harm s way
they have since formed a volunteer committee to restore coral reefs wetlands mangroves and ponds that trap rainfall running off hillsides to protect the village from future floods and storms and preserve its natural beauty
you have to have a balance or you lose what you love said local celebrity quito rymer a reggae now rebuilding his restaurant and hotel wrecked by the hurricane
we have decided to take things in our scientists say warmer air and warmer seas around the globe are increasing rainfall and wind speed in storms and may have intensified the two hurricanes that battered the caribbean last year causing about direct deaths and losses estimated at billion
in its latest flagship report published in the intergovernmental panel on climate change pointed to rising sea levels as one of the most widely recognised climate change threats to coastal areas on islands and atolls
combined with extreme events like storm surges it identified severe sea flood and erosion risks for islands with saltwater degrading groundwater supplies
other risks from hotter seas include increased coral bleaching and reef damage which could undermine coastal protection fisheries and tourism hurting island communities and costing jobs scientists said in the report
mindful of those risks some islands in the caribbean the world s most region are looking beyond beach holidays for fresh ways to entice tourists from music festivals to fertility vacations and sports camps
kate brown executive director of the global island partnership glispa an alliance spearheaded by island leaders believes many islanders are painfully aware of climate change and wider environmental threats
in vanuatu palau and the seychelles for example they are already acting to manage the risks whether by introducing locally managed marine reserves or banning plastic bags and straws she said
you can go to a village virtually anywhere and they understand that climate change is impacting them she added
heaps of changes are being made
there has been a big shift away from waiting for other people to do one area that has seen a huge push said brown is action to clean up plastic waste which is polluting the oceans to the tune of million to million tonnes per year
eight million tonnes is like covering an area times the size of new york s manhattan island to according to a study by the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis at the university of barbara
on the indonesian island of bali tour guide wayan aksara joined and later became chairman of trash hero indonesia after getting a growing number of complaints from clients about rubbish on its beaches
the community group which has more than chapters across indonesia and about on bali uses social media to organise weekly garbage collection events for volunteers
there is a plastic problem in bali we need time but we have started already aksara told the thomson reuters foundation
big things start from small on ibiza a balearic island off spain s east coast known for its clubbing scene activists are pooling efforts to raise awareness of the growing plastic problem among its residents and million annual visitors
love ibiza now one of about organisations in a plastic free ibiza alliance started in late june is promoting beach cleans tote bags and biodegradable straws for instance and recruiting villa rental agencies restaurants and top djs to help sell an approach to tourists
the thing that makes this is the small size of the island said sarah drewer who runs online communications for love ibiza now
the message has to be really simple and without to manage scarce resources better and grow their economies cleanly some islands are turning to smart technology and digital solutions
on mallorca another of spain s four main balearic islands the small town of esporles is experimenting with the internet of things installing sensors to monitor water consumption and help detect leaks faster
it plans to extend its network to check on air pollution and ease parking problems in busy summer months
i think the data gives us very valuable information to analyse it and understand the next steps we need to take said the town s mayor maria ramon salas
meanwhile across europe s islands authorities are aiming to adopt renewable energy technologies to shrink the expense of providing electricity and cut their emissions
energy costs on the continent s inhabited islands are between and percent higher than on the mainland christopher jones senior energy advisor at the european commission told an april conference on smart islands
but in the past five years renewables from solar plants with battery storage to offshore wind turbines have become cheaper and switching to them creates jobs he added
today we have extraordinary opportunities he said
we are at the start of an energy revolution on the tiny greek island of tilos for example which suffers regular power cuts is betting on a new hybrid wind and solar power plant to meet its electricity needs
until this summer tilos got all its electricity from a diesel power plant on the island of kos km miles away which struggles to meet demand in the peak tourist season
mayor maria kamma hopes tilos push for a clean energy supply will go beyond keeping hotel lights on and ensure residents have a very good standard of living allowing them to work there all year round deterring young people from leaving and even enticing newcomers
experts say a rise in renewable energy provision on islands also could help entrepreneurs like former development worker joanna edghill
she and her husband set up an electric car company on the caribbean island of barbados five years ago
their business called megapower has since sold electric vehicles and set up charging stations plus a handful of solar on the island and is now expanding in the region
faced with high fuel import costs the caribbean is ripe for the electrification of transportation said curtis boodoo an academic working on the issue with the caricom regional group of countries
sourcing an adequate supply of food can also send import bills for islands in the caribbean and beyond
in many places residents and visitors get most of their food from shipping containers said ian mcneel who slow food barbados which promotes local organic produce and runs school programmes to reconnect children with farming
poor families in barbados can spend up to of their income on food often buying imported products that contribute to bad diets driving obesity and diabetes according to the food and agriculture organization fao
but some caribbean farmers are working to reverse that trend by reviving traditional crops and sharing their knowledge said arno boersma manager of the centre of excellence for the sustainable development of small island developing states
they include belmont estate a plantation on grenada that produces organic cocoa and spices and runs farm tours a restaurant and a museum he noted
besides a shortage of food many islands also suffer from insufficient drinking water but the islanders of kavaratti capital of the lakshadweep archipelago a group of islands in the arabian sea off india are making their own
once forced to use brackish water as the sea seeped into their limited groundwater supplies they now have a locally developed desalination plant
the best part is that we can close our eyes and drink a glass of water without worrying about falling ill resident khadeeja lavanakkal told the thomson reuters foundation
buoyed by the project s success the national institute of ocean technology set up two more desalination plants on lakshadweep islands in and is now building six more hoping to power them in future with the ocean s energy
the common wisdom is that as environmental pressures worsen with climate change making it harder to fish farm and find clean water some island populations might be forced to look for a new home
in the pacific that has raised ethical questions about whether larger countries like new zealand should offer humanitarian visas to climate migrants a policy now under consideration
some islands such as kiribati have bought land elsewhere with a view to moving whole communities while choiseul province in the solomon islands has plans to shift its capital to a safer location
but in other regions where sea level rise is less of an existential threat some islands are seeing migrants arrive not leave and governments are grappling with how to handle them
trinidad and tobago for example has received asylum requests from about venezuelans struggling to survive amid a political crisis and harsh recession at home according to april data from the refugee agency unhcr
ambulance driver miguel vegas is seeking refugee status for himself and his family
we just want permission to work
we want to pay taxes he told the thomson reuters foundation
the government of the nation is working on a new asylum system as lawyers say the current process does not meet international obligations to protect asylum seekers
but the influx of venezuelans is causing anxiety over whether there are enough jobs and social services to go round
on the greek island of tilos which has welcomed about syrian refugees fleeing war back home restaurants and other businesses offer the newcomers work in the tourist season
but there is little employment for the rest of the year
abdulkader hamo a kurdish refugee who left syria with his family last summer says his children are happy on tilos where they go to school and are no longer afraid of air strikes
nonetheless he is considering moving elsewhere
there is no work here
it s not great for a family he said
anastasia giannakopoulou a social worker with greek aid group solidarity now said refugees face the same difficulties as the local residents living in a small place with some seeking work on other islands in winter
the authorities are committed to creating job openings for everyone such as a planned cheese factory using milk from island goats that will employ people including six refugees
this is a really sustainable and profitable business which can withstand the passing of time and grow by adding more refugees in future said tilos mayor kamma
while there is no shortage of solutions to island problems not all are moving at the same speed creating a hunger for more knowledge and finance experts say
we need to figure out how to give a hand up to those that are going to struggle said glispa s brown
many island treasuries especially in the caribbean are massively indebted and lack the cash to build back better after disasters or pursue a more sustainable economic model
some caribbean islands are selling citizenship and passports to foreigners for chunky donations or investments
it s bringing in an enormous amount of money and it s helping us to reduce our debt burden in a very serious way said keith mitchell grenada s prime minister
after the hurricanes saint kitts and nevis offered citizenship for a family of four in return for a payment to a relief fund
those involved say vigorous vetting eliminates applicants with criminal backgrounds on international watch lists or involved in money laundering
but analysts say security risks remain and tax loopholes are easily exploited
overall islands face big hurdles in attracting donor funds and private investment noted the world bank s hallegatte
their governments often lack the staff to prepare and sell projects to potential backers
the investment sought is often too small to appeal and the cost of making deals and doing business is very high due to remote locations he added
but international development banks can help by working with islands to group diverse resilience projects and market them to investors as green bonds hallegatte said
regional insurance pools are also helping island states get quick cash to recovery after a disaster although they have attracted more governments in the caribbean than the pacific so far
under one innovative financing model eight caribbean island states have set up national trust funds to protect biodiversity and manage natural resources wisely and are putting in their own cash to match donor contributions noted glispa s brown
yet despite exciting developments there remains a gap in securing investment on the scale required she added
there a huge amount of resources needed for islands to get to where they want to be and also just to become more resilient to all the changes that are going on she said
