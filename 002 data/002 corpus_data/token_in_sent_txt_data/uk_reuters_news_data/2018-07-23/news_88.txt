feature-trash heroes and scavenger apps battle bali 'garbage emergency'
denpasar indonesia july thomson reuters foundation five years ago tour guide wayan aksara noticed that more and more visitors he showed around the indonesian island of bali were complaining about garbage on its beaches
bali s mounting rubbish problem was also becoming personal for aksara who lives near saba beach an undeveloped area close to the holiday resort of sanur which faces a constant battle with trash washed onto its shores from a nearby river
every time we drove around our guests would comment about it not being clean and the large amount of plastic said aksara
they would say the trash is bad that tourism here is not sustainable and ask what we are doing about aksara joined and is now chairman of trash hero indonesia a community group with more than chapters across indonesia and about on bali
it uses social media to organise weekly events for volunteers
aksara a also gives talks at schools and community events on how to manage waste better
like many parts of asia the indonesian archipelago of more than islands has a economy and population and a huge coastline with many densely populated cities
these factors have created a perfect storm for garbage in the surrounding seas said susan ruffo a managing director at the group ocean conservancy
garbage collection services and infrastructure have largely failed to keep pace with rapid development
now as awareness rises civil society groups like trash hero are playing an important role in bali s push to keep its famous beaches and temples free of rubbish
on saba beach surrounded by coconut trees and grazing cows the garbage strewn about includes toothpaste tubes shoes plastic bottles nappies drinking straws and cigarette packets
there is a plastic problem in bali we need time but we have started already aksara told the thomson reuters foundation
big things start from small globally more than million tonnes of plastics are dumped into the ocean each year scientists say about one truckload per minute
china indonesia vietnam the philippines and thailand are the top five culprits said ocean conservancy s ruffo
aside from the impacts on human health and wildlife economic cooperation a forum has put the cost to the region s tourism fishing and shipping industries at about billion per year
stung by criticism indonesia s president joko widodo who has targeted new balis across the archipelago to boost tourism has been quick to act
last year luhut binsar pandjaitan indonesia s coordinating minister for maritime affairs launched a national action plan pledging up to billion to cut ocean waste percent by
in june local media reported the government had teamed up with muslim clerics to tell their more than million followers to choose reusable bags over plastic ones
jenna jambeck a university of georgia professor who specialises in plastic waste and marine debris said indonesia had become a leader on the issue out of a desire to protect their amazing resources and beautiful country
bali s most popular tourist beaches are now cleaned of trash at least once a day by local authorities using heavy machinery
mass are organised at least three times a year on bali and across indonesia bringing together tens of thousands of tourists and locals to tidy up communities
despite this the rubbish problem on bali was so bad late last year that officials declared a garbage emergency
if you re finding plastic on the beach it s already too late said ocean conservancy s ruffo
it should never be there in the first place
how do you stop it at source
there is no one fix or silver tracing the origins of the trash on bali s beaches is difficult but experts estimate up to percent comes from the island itself
rubbish collected from hotels and villages by informal workers is often dumped in rivers and then carried out to sea before eventually finding its way back to the coastline
a rise in the use of plastic packaging over the last decade coupled with increased wealth and consumption has exacerbated the problem experts told the thomson reuters foundation
bali desperately needs to improve its landfill sites invest in more recycling facilities carry out regular trash collections and expand its piped water supply they added
businesses meanwhile should redesign products or change materials so they are easier to reuse or recycle said jambeck
governments also can make a difference by requiring a certain amount of recycled content in products banning plastic bags or taxing plastics she added
based in bali s cultural centre of ubud local company rumah kompos has six trucks that collect waste from hotels and private homes
the trash is then separated at the company s depot to recycle turn into compost or send to landfill
a new recycling facility funded by the government will boost rumah kompos capacity later this year said manager supardi asmorobangun
the facility will host local children at weekend green camps with a cinema showing films on climate change and plastic waste he said
the company has also begun piloting a free reusable water bottle scheme at schools in ubud
my dream for the next five years is for every village on bali to do rubbish separation asmorobangun said
we must do it now not new technologies and asia s army of informal rubbish collectors and scavengers are also key tools experts said
at sanur kaja village in denpasar garbage gatherers are reaping the financial rewards of joining a pilot project run by gringgo trash tech reflected in a row of brand new motorcycles parked near the local authority s waste collection facility
the company mapped out denpasar and began a project last year using existing waste infrastructure to improve recycling and collection
apps and gps helped create a zoning system in the village of residents enabling garbage gatherers to become and more efficient
as a result they can collect more rubbish from more households to increase their earnings
if these guys stop working this city will be shut down in less than a week said gringgo olivier pouillon
besides improving coordination with the local authority gringgo s app provides the latest prices for recyclable waste
the system now serves about percent of the village with three times as much rubbish collected said pouillon
the quickest way to stop the pollution is to track where the waste is going and that exactly what we done he said
