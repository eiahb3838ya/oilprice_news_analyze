most germans think europe can defend itself without u.s. help - poll
berlin reuters more than half of germans think europe can defend itself without military backing from the united states a poll showed on monday less than two weeks after president donald trump said he could withdraw support
only percent of respondents said they believed europe depended on military help the forsa poll showed
the survey found no significant difference between eastern german regions and western areas which have stronger historical ties to the united states
in the east percent thought europe did not need washington and in the west percent
trump gave an ultimatum to european allies on july warning a nato summit the united states could withdraw its support if europe did not share more of what he called an unfair burden on taxpayers in funding the alliance
in a rebuke to german chancellor angela merkel he also called germany a captive of moscow because he said berlin supported a baltic sea gas pipeline from russia
about percent of respondents said trump s comments about russia controlling germany were completely absurd according to the poll which surveyed germans
even more percent said they suspected that trump s motive for making the comments was primarily to promote the sale of liquefied gas in europe and germany
two thirds said they supported the construction of the nord stream baltic sea pipeline because it would help provide germany with a more reliable supply of natural gas
