update 1-california power grid urges consumers to conserve energy in heat wave
reuters california s power grid operator on monday issued an alert to homes and businesses to conserve electricity on tuesday and wednesday when a heat wave is expected to blanket the state
the california independent system operator iso the grid operator said it issued the flex alert due to high temperatures across the western united states reduced electricity imports into the state tight natural gas supplies in southern california and high wildfire risk
the iso s alert followed an earlier notice by southern california gas co socalgas the gas utility for the southern part of the state
socalgas issued a gas curtailment watch on monday notifying customers to be prepared to reduce gas use if needed with power generators expected to burn more fuel this week than usual to keep air conditioners humming
socalgas a unit of california energy company sempra energy said the watch would remain in effect until further notice
high temperatures in los angeles were forecast to top degrees fahrenheit celsius with the mercury expected to reach degrees on wednesday according to accuweather
the normal high in the city at this time of year is degrees
the iso said consumers can help avoid power interruptions by turning off all unnecessary lights using major appliances before and after and setting air conditioners to degrees or higher
gas supplies are expected to remain tight in southern california this summer and winter due to reduced availability from socalgas aliso canyon storage facility in los angeles following a massive leak between october and february and ongoing shutdowns of several pipelines
socalgas projected gas demand would rise from billion cubic feet per day bcfd on monday to bcfd on tuesday and bcfd on wednesday and thursday while receipts of the fuel via pipelines into california would only total about bcfd
that means socalgas will have to tap storage fields to make up the difference which could hurt the utility s ability to stockpile enough fuel to avoid curtailments for some power and industrial customers on the coldest days during the winter heating season
state and federal agencies have projected socalgas will only be able to deliver about bcfd from storage fields due to the aliso limitations and pipeline outages which has only occurred once in the summer in the past five years but is fairly common in the winter
