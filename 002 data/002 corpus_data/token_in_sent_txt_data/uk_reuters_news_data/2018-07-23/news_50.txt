column-china imports of u.s. crude to slump, rest of north asia steps up: russell
launceston australia reuters crude oil isn t formally part of the trade dispute between the united states and china but it may well be the first major flow to be disrupted significantly by the rising tensions
one of the successes in the efforts to lower the trade surplus enjoyed by china over the united states was exports of crude a result of the shale oil boom that has taken the to within a whisker of being the world s top oil producer
crude exports from the united states to china have surged this year with and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts showing china imported million barrels or about barrels per day bpd of oil in the first half of the year
this was up from just million barrels or bpd over the same period last year according to the data
much of the gain so far this year has been in recent months with the april to july period being four of the five strongest months on record and january this year being the other
july is set to be the month for chinese imports of crude with the data pointing to the arrival of million barrels or about bpd
expected shipments in august appear to be heading substantially lower however with only million barrels or about bpd expected to arrive at chinese ports
while these numbers may still change they are unlikely to shift much given the typical journey between ports in the gulf of mexico and china
this means all cargoes slated to arrive in china in august should have already left
it also means most cargoes likely to arrive in september would also have departed the united states but so far no such fixtures are showing
this doesn t mean there will be zero crude exports arriving china in september but it does raise the possibility that there will be a sharp decline
to put it in perspective of the cargoes unloaded in china in june nine left ports in april
given there is only one week left of july and no cargoes have yet left the for arrival in china in september it seems risks are rising that oil shipments to china are falling off a cliff
this may add to the existing trade tensions between china and president donald trump who has made it clear he wants a lower trade deficit with china
if crude oil exports do plummet though the trade deficit is likely headed higher notwithstanding tariffs already placed on some chinese exports by the trump administration
while this sounds like a poor outcome for crude exporters there is evidence suggesting other importers in north asia are taking up cargoes no longer being bought by china
south korea may import a record amount of crude in september with data pointing to the arrival of million barrels or about bpd
japan may bring in million barrels in september or about bpd the highest since january this year
taiwan s imports from the united states are slated at million bpd for august or about bpd which would be the highest on record
while additional imports from japan south korea and taiwan are probably insufficient to make up for the loss of chinese purchases they will provide some comfort to oil exporters
but they are also unlikely to do anything to ease the trade tensions between the trump administration and china
the looming slump in china s purchases of crude may be taken as a sign that beijing is prepared to fight back against trump even if the tactics are somewhat different
rather than impose tariffs china may simply persuade its refiners to move away from buying crude
this means pain can be inflicted on the united states without needing to impose tariffs or resorting to the bombastic rhetoric that typifies the trump administration
