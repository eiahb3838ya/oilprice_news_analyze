exclusive-general electric's power unit faces threat in saudi arabia
new york and abu dhabi reuters one of general electric co s largest and most valuable customers saudi arabia is lining up competitors to bid against ge for lucrative power plant work according to five people familiar with the situation
saudi electricity co has qualified at least two companies to provide service or parts for some of its more than turbines and it is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the plants over many years according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter
these approvals for the first time put saudi electricity in a position to break ge s hold on that work by having others bid against ge on maintaining the fleet among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry when the existing contracts come up according to the sources and industry databases
saudi electricity co sec has not yet offered any substantial contracts to new bidders and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids according to sources familiar with the matter
in response to questions from reuters ge said at present ge s units in sec continue to be covered under service saudi electricity initially declined to comment
in a joint statement to reuters on sunday after reuters published the companies stressed they have been partners on power generation for nearly years
sec has always embarked on a very balanced policy of procurement to ensure well diversified sources of suppliers said khalid executive vice president for generation of saudi electricity

the kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies according to a source with direct knowledge of saudi electricity
saudi electricity is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services rather than relying on ge as the sole provider because qualifying competitors will lower prices the source said
saudi electricity previously created competition for an earlier generation of turbines known as the according to the sources
after bidding began ge ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about percent sources said
one source with knowledge of ge s service history in saudi arabia said some turbines that saudi electricity purchased more recently may not be under agreements because the service price was high and those could be opened for bidding at any time
one side effect of saudi electricity qualifying firms to repair its is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside saudi arabia potentially threatening portions of ge s service business globally three sources said
saudi electricity s rigorous qualification process is seen as a stamp of approval that will help bidders sell to other utilities and industries one of the sources said
the companies saudi electricity has qualified for work on ge s are power systems mfg llc a unit of ansaldo energia spa of genoa italy and san combustion parts inc
both declined to comment
ge chief executive john flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to ge s power business where profit fell percent in the second quarter
the division which makes equipment for gas coal and nuclear power plants is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants
flannery said on friday that fixing the unit was clearly our top as a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue ge in may posted videos on youtube saying it is offering upgrades to turbines made by rivals siemens ag and mitsubishi hitachi power systems
two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on saudi electricity s plants chromalloy based in palm beach gardens florida and al masaood john brown in dubai

al masaood john brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain components at its dubai facility
it plans to present details of the planned investment to sec as a way of kick starting the formal process general manager brian waddell said in an email
chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on saudi electricity s turbines for the long term
