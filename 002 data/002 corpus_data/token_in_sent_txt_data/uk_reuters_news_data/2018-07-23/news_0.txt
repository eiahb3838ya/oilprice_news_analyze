u.s. republican unveils bill calling for carbon tax
washington july reuters a republican lawmaker in the house of representatives unveiled a bill calling for a carbon tax on monday saying he hoped the legislation would at the very least renew a debate on climate change that has languished for a decade
representative carlos curbelo a member of the house tax committee who faces a tough bid in florida said the legislation called the market choice act enjoys small but growing support among republicans who in recent years have been better known for rejection of carbon tax proposals
the measure is sure to fail
but curbelo speaking at a washington forum on monday remained upbeat
i truly believe that one day this bill or legislation similar to it will become law curbelo said
it will spark an important debate about investing in our country s infrastructure the way we tax and what to do to protect the environment he said
curbelo said his legislation would exceed the carbon reduction goals of the paris climate change pact by imposing a levy on industrial emissions which would begin in and rise annually
it would replace existing taxes on gasoline and aviation fuel
he said the tax would generate billion in revenue over a decade for infrastructure investments
the bill would also impose a moratorium on regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions
the legislation represents a small but meaningful shift for republicans on climate politics driven in part by candidates in swing states where increasingly frequent hurricanes and floods make no distinction between republicans and democrats
many republicans supported a climate bill years ago
but it died in the senate
since then republicans including president donald trump have largely stood firm on two positions cutting taxes and opposing climate legislation
last week the house voted to approve a resolution expressing the sense of congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the united states curbelo opposed the measure along with five other republicans
a seventh chose not to support the resolution by voting curbelo intends to discuss his bill with the bipartisan house climate solutions caucus which includes other republicans
we re seeing trends in the house that should give us hope said curbelo
the bill would be introduced formally later on monday
