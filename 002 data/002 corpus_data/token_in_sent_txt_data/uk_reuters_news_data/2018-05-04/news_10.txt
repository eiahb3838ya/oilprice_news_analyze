statoil targets deeper emission cuts to avoid stranded assets
reuters norway s statoil said it aims to cut its carbon footprint more aggressively as measures to reduce global warming could reduce the value of its assets leaving some of its reserves stranded underground
the possibility that large quantities of the world s oil will never be developed due to the increase of renewable energy and the electrification of transport has been a growing worry for investors in the oil sector
statoil norway s largest company started stress testing its portfolio of oil and gas assets against global energy scenarios set out by the international energy agency iea at shareholders request in
the iea s sustainable development scenario analyses the likely impact of energy policies by
the net present value npv of statoil s portfolio will be reduced by percent under the iea sustainable development scenario statoil s chief executive eldar saetre told reuters
however he said that would still leave statoil s portfolio with a massive npv
the iea says its scenario is aligned with the paris agreement goals to keep global warming from exceeding degrees celsius
saetre was speaking on the sidelines of a statoil presentation to investors in london where the company announced plans to reduce emissions from some of its new fields to kg of per barrel of oil equivalents boe less than a fifth of the global average
its carbon intensity at its offshore fields stood at kg per boe in compared to a global average of kg per boe
statoil said optimization and efficiency improvements have substantially strengthened its portfolio which includes the giant johan sverdrup oilfield off norway
the field will be powered from shore instead of generating electricity by offshore gas turbines the main source of emissions on the norwegian continental shelf
statoil reduced its emissions from kg of per boe in partly by divesting its oil sand operations in canada in
last year it said it would no longer explore for heavy oil which requires more energy and produces more emissions to lift barrels from the ground
however the company still operates two heavy oilfields in brazil and britain and is working with rosneft to develop a field in russia
despite the negative impact on npv in the sustainable development scenario we see very limited stranding of assets statoil said in its latest sustainability report
royal dutch shell said last month that it saw little risk of having stranded assets in its portfolio because of the oil major s current oil and gas reserves would be extracted before anyway
