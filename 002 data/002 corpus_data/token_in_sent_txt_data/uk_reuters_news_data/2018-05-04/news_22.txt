update 6-ex-volkswagen ceo winterkorn charged in u.s. over diesel scandal
reuters the united states has filed criminal charges against former volkswagen ag boss martin winterkorn accusing him of conspiring to cover up the german automaker s diesel emissions cheating in a rare attempt to prosecute a ceo for company actions
the indictment reopens the question of whether other senior volkswagen vw executives knew about the scandal which has dogged europe s biggest automaker for more than years and led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun cars
the indictment filed by the department of justice doj in secret in march was unsealed in a district court on thursday as vw held its annual meeting in berlin
winterkorn is charged with four felony counts including conspiracy to defraud the united states wire fraud and violating the clean air act from at least may through november after vw admitted using illicit software that allowed diesel cars to emit excess pollution without detection
winterkorn resigned within days of the scandal becoming public in september but other senior executives who were on the company s management board at the time continue to hold senior positions within the group
poetsch who was finance chief is now chairman of the supervisory board
herbert diess now group ceo joined the company on july as head of the vw brand only weeks before authorities divulged its cheating on
rupert stadler who was head of the audi brand in has been given additional responsibilities for group sales in a revamp announced by diess last month
bernd osterloh the company s powerful labour chief who also sits on the vw supervisory board is still in place
vw has said the decision to install illegal defeat device software was taken in below the management board level
none of the members of the board of management had at that time and for many years to follow knowledge of the development and implementation of this software function vw said in its annual report
a lawyer for winterkorn in germany did not immediately comment
winterkorn in january told german lawmakers he had not been informed of the cheating early and would have halted it had he been aware
a vw spokesman in germany said the company continues to cooperate with investigations but does not comment about probes of winterkorn is unlikely to face authorities
germany s federal justice ministry said on friday it does not extradite german nationals to countries outside the european union
winterkorn is currently in germany is unlikely to travel to a jurisdiction that might extradite him to the united states a source familiar with his thinking said
vw shares which were trading on friday were percent higher at euros at gmt
attorney general jeff sessions environmental protection administration epa chief scott pruitt and other senior trump administration official issued statements criticizing vw with the indictment
if you try to deceive the united states then you will pay a heavy price sessions said
in contrast with vw no individuals were charged at toyota motor corp in connection with its sudden unintended acceleration scandal or at general motors co for the of a deadly ignition switch defect
the federal government s decisions not to prosecute senior banking industry executives over the financial crisis has also drawn fire from advocates of tougher measures to deter corporate wrongdoing
vw has been fighting to move on from the scandal
it settled criminal charges with the doj in by agreeing to a billion billion pound payment and has pledged to spend billions on new electric vehicles
in total it has agreed to spend more than billion in the united states to address claims from owners environmental regulators states and dealers
but prosecutors in germany and the united states are continuing investigations into what senior executives at vw and its porsche and audi brands knew
they have also opened investigations into bmw and fiatchrysler related to their diesel emissions
vw has also offered to buy back about polluting vehicles
many are now stored in parking lots around the united states
vw has never commented on when individual management board members learned about the defeat devices
the filing with the district court said winterkorn was briefed about the consequences of being caught using an illegal emissions device on july
vw disclosed to authorities that it had used illegal software in its cars on and did not inform investors until the epa alerted the public on
vw chose not to disclose the issue earlier because it felt the matter could be resolved amicably with authorities its annual report said
sessions said in a statement that the charges against winterkorn showed volkswagen s scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the the indictment describes how vw employees presented powerpoint slides to winterkorn and other senior vw ag management at an meeting at vw s headquarters in the meeting provided a clear picture of how the company was deceiving regulators about software used to rig emissions tests of vw diesel vehicles it said
the indictment also alleges that vw employees recommended the company seek to get approval for diesel models from regulators without revealing the existence of the cheating software
winterkorn agreed to the plan the indictment said
the indictment also states winterkorn was informed of the emissions cheating by a memo sent in may
winterkorn has said he did not learn of the cheating until late august
at its annual meeting vw s new ceo herbert diess vowed to make the carmaker more honest but investors called for outside vetting of steps to restore its reputation
vw had initially suggested only executives knew of the cheating
but the indictment alleges winterkorn agreed with other senior vw executives to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive in total nine people have been charged and two former vw executives have pleaded guilty in the case and been sentenced to prison terms
one italian citizen former audi manager giovanni pamio is in germany awaiting extradition
six former vw executives charged including winterkorn are believed to be in germany and have avoided facing prosecutors
