analysis-nuclear deal a challenge for rouhani as iran hardliners close in
ankara reuters iran s hardliners are preparing to bring president hassan rouhani to heel if president donald trump scraps tehran s nuclear deal with major powers officials and analysts believe
trump has threatened to abrogate the agreement by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on may if britain france and germany do not fix its terrible flaws
this sets the stage for a resurgence of political infighting within iran s complex power structure iranian officials said
annulment of the accord could tip the balance of power in favour of hardliners looking to constrain the relatively moderate rouhani s ability to open up to the west
while the spotlight is on trump s eventual decision there will be a display of unity in tehran a senior iranian official told reuters on condition of anonymity
but when the crisis is over hardliners will try to weaken and sideline the president the official said
nor can the president expect any weakening of iran s system of clerical rule as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nuclear deal meaning rouhani will be in a situation said a relative of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei
for rouhani the stakes are high
if the deal falls apart he could become politically vulnerable for promoting the accord under which sanctions were lifted in return for tehran curbing its nuclear programme
it will also lead to a backlash against the moderates and who backed rouhani s detente policy with the west and any hope for moderation at home in the near future will fizzle out said political analyst hamid farahvashian
it is a delicate balance
khamenei knows that iranians many of whom took to the streets earlier this year to protest against high food prices can only take so much economic pressure
but the establishment does not want too much of an opening to the west despite the likely economic benefits
a weakened rouhani unable to push such policies is likely to serve out his term which ends in another senior official said
his removal would be a sign of weakness for the system
it would harm its legitimacy abroad the official said
but he will be blamed and pressured for the economic khamenei gave guarded backing to rouhani when he opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with world powers in order to end iran s economic and political isolation
but the supreme leader s aversion to the united states remains a formidable barrier to any diplomatic solution now so a trump withdrawal would make it hard for rouhani to pursue better relations with the west
the internal politics will make it difficult if not impossible for rouhani to pursue detente with the west and make concessions in return for economic gains said another iranian government official
the european signatories of the deal have tried to persuade trump not abandon it because they want to keep trading with iran
despite threats to walk away if trump buries the deal several iranian officials said that as long as tehran was not excluded from the global financial and trading system it could consider respecting the accord
but many foreign firms are hesitant to invest in iran worried by unilateral sanctions imposed over human rights violations terrorism and the dominant role of the revolutionary guard corps irgc in iran s economy
that is another area where rouhani is exposed
he has sought without much success to curb the economic activities of the irgc in order to attract foreign investment
but under the command of khamenei the irgc has ignored the government s attempts to limit its involvement in the economy
if the nuclear deal collapses what power rouhani has to limit that involvement will decline further boosting hardliners who want to see the president s powers reined in
the irgc has done well since the sanctions relating to the nuclear deal were lifted using front companies with no obvious link to the guard to serve as a conduit for investors returning to iran
if sanctions are reimposed as a result of the collapse of the nuclear deal the guard is well placed to evade them
considering their vast business network and political and military influence the irgc will be back to the business of evading sanctions as they did for years in the past said a western diplomat in tehran
the irgc stepped in when european oil companies abandoned energy projects after the united states and the european union imposed sanctions in
sepah the irgc is an asset for iran
they protect iran whenever needed
they rescued the economy when the enemies wanted to crush us with sanctions said a hardline politician who declined to be identified
if european investors yield to america s pressure and leave iran then sepah will take over he said
concerns over possible israeli military action against iran s nuclear facilities have empowered the irgc which runs security at home and abroad
but experts believe that even under the umbrella of an emboldened irgc hardliners might hesitate to apply harsh policies fearing a revival of the protests in january that showed the establishment was vulnerable to popular anger fuelled by economic hardship
