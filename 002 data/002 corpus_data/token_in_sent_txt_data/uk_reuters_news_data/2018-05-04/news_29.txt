rpt-europeans push last bid to salvage iran deal, but work on plan b
repeats may story with no changes political agreement could be ready for trump next week unclear why russia china should back tough approach eu could try blocking sanctions to shield companies by john irish and robin emmott may reuters european powers still want to hand donald trump next week a plan to save the iran nuclear deal but they have also started work on protecting business ties if the president makes good on a threat to withdraw six sources told reuters
trump who says the accord is a disaster has all but decided to withdraw by may officials say and looks set to reject four months of european efforts to address his concerns
but france britain and germany aim to present to the white house a separate political agreement that commits to taking a tougher stance on iran if they can agree it in time with the state department their american interlocutors
several of the sources said they were sceptical the effort would succeed and all said the europeans were also working on damage limitation scenarios if it fails
we have a week to continue talking to the americans to see if we can find an agreement on the deal said a senior european diplomat
but i don t think there is any reason to be overly the political agreement which is a culmination of transatlantic diplomacy does not include iran or russia and china the other parties to the accord
it seeks to spell out to trump that europe will seek to contain tehran s ballistic missile programme its influence in syria and yemen the terms by which inspectors visit suspect iranian sites and sunset clauses under which some of its terms expire
while the europeans and the americans have narrowed their differences they are struggling to agree on how to handle a desire to extend some of the limits on iran s nuclear programme without reopening the july accord
we re trying to find the right formulas that respond to the expectations of the americans but at the same time do not go against the deal said a second senior european diplomat
there is a chance of getting an agreement but even if we have we one i m not convinced that it will be enough to stop the withdrawing the diplomat said
in their package for trump the europeans are also grappling with a desire to make explicit that iran must give international inspectors access to military sites
the europeans say this is already implicit in the original deal
there s a view that the inspection provisions aren t strong enough which is not a view that is shared by the europeans said a third diplomat involved in the discussions
france s president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel are continuing to lobby trump but with the prospect of him changing his mind remote the focus has shifted to managing the fallout and avoiding a dangerous vacuum
macron in washington last week proposed that irrespective of trump s decision there should be a wider discussion between iran and the powers behind the original deal which took years to negotiate working towards a grand bargain
that would incorporate the existing nuclear deal and the issues currently discussed between europeans and americans
but it is hard to see how iran could be brought back to the table
tehran says it is abiding by the terms of the deal and has no intention to renegotiate it
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif on thursday rejected any form of renegotiation
france britain and germany all say they will stay in the deal even if the united states withdraws and try to protect and foster trade with iran that has soared since the european union lifted most of its economic sanctions on iran
iran s exports of mainly fuel and other energy products to the eu in jumped percent to billion euros billion compared to the previous year while investment in iran jumped to more than billion euros
if trump can t be persuaded not to withdraw the solution is to encourage the americans to keep conditions that enable our companies in related sectors to continue to trade said a french official
the german economy ministry said it was waiting for a formal decision on the iran deal before deciding whether to stop offering german firms export guarantees for business deals with tehran
such guarantees provide state protection for companies doing business abroad when foreign debtors fail to pay
the prospect of trade with europe would provide the europeans with a chance to assuage the iranians and dissuade them from rash decisions such as leaving the deal or reviving the nuclear activities they agreed to give up
countermeasures could include a special eu blocking statute developed in the but never fully used to shield european firms doing business with iran from legal action if washington reimposes sanctions
but eu plans to keep money flowing to iran would require the united states to approve export credit facilities and other funding support to help firms enter iran without fear of american legal ramifications
two european officials said reviving the blocking statutes would still be mostly a symbolic step to show the iranians that europe was committed to the deal
in practice companies would fear that investing in iran would harm their commercial interests with the united states
a senior iranian official agreed
these are good ideas to show the europeans are committed to the agreement but we think that if they have to choose between iran and the united states they will choose the america said the senior iranian official
