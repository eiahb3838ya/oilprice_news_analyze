interview-despite violence, somalia eyes a clean energy future - un
lisbon may thomson reuters foundation providing clean energy to somalis including those uprooted from their homes in the country could both improve lives there and provide new opportunities for entrepreneurs the envoy to somalia said
despite persistent violence somalia is slowly sorting its problems out with efforts underway to rebuild the state raise more tax revenue and improve security said michael keating the highest united nations official in the horn of africa nation
that image of somalia that is dominated by bombs and hunger is really out of date keating said on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in lisbon this week
the issue is how can energy contribute to moving the country forward as the population grows climate change and environmental degradation are contributing to the many problems faced by somalis who are competing for natural resources such as land wood and water keating said
that in turn is fuelling tensions
people are drifting into cities where they can t sustain themselves he told the thomson reuters foundation in an interview
some million people have been displaced from their homes inside somalia and another are registered as refugees in other countries according to figures
some have fled fighting while others have been forced to abandon their farms due to drought
but the legacy of years of civil war is not all bad keating noted
left with little functioning electricity infrastructure somalia has the chance to leapfrog to a more nimble approach using local grids powered by renewable energy
the need is pressing with a report on progress towards global energy goals this week showing only percent of somalis had access to electricity in up from percent in
just percent are able to use clean fuels for cooking with the rest resorting to dirtier forms of energy such as kerosene and charcoal which are damaging to health
keating has been talking to the government about whether somalia can make itself into a clean energy country drawing on solar wind and hydropower from its two big rivers he said
in to local energy providers banded together to form a power generation transmission and distribution company called beco which is slowly shifting to solar energy he noted
beco supplies megawatts mw of power operating in the capital mogadishu and other cities including afgooye and kismayo
the company aims to boost its solar power generation capacity by mw annually eventually reducing the share of power produced from fossil fuels mainly diesel to less than percent according to the united nations
other smaller enterprises such as power offgrid in jowhar are providing solar home systems and solar equipment to run irrigation pumps for farmers and cold storage for clinics and local businesses
ironically somalia is a great place to try and get things going said keating
however people are concerned about security and at a certain point you do need more government few market restrictions are imposed on businesses but that can lead to overlapping provision in some places and inconsistent standards he noted
agencies and other development organisations can support somalia s push for clean energy and universal access by bringing together government business and communities to chart a way forward and providing information about what has worked in similar environments keating said
the international community can also mobilise finance but attracting investment from the somali diaspora around the world is key he added
for somalia s large displaced population many crammed into informal settlements in the capital gaining access to clean energy is a question of dignity as well as safety he said
it about giving people who live in very tough circumstances the opportunity to contribute to their own welfare and make a living at the same time he explained
