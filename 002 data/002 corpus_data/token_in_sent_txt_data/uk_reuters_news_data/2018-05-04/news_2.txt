illinois to sue epa for exempting foxconn plant from pollution controls
washington reuters illinois attorney general said on friday she plans to sue the environmental protection agency for allowing a proposed foxconn technology co ltd plant in neighboring wisconsin to operate without stringent pollution controls
on tuesday the epa identified areas in states that do not meet federal air quality requirements for ozone a step toward enforcing the standards issued in
an exempted area was racine county wisconsin just north of the illinois border that is known to have heavily polluted air where foxconn is building a billion display plant
pollution monitoring data show the county s ozone levels exceed the parts per billion ppb limit
if racine county had been designated a area it would have required foxconn to install stringent pollution control equipment
attorney general lisa madigan said she would file a lawsuit in the district of columbia circuit court of appeals challenging the epa s ozone designations saying its failure to name racine county a area puts people at risk
despite its name the environmental protection agency now operates with total disregard for the quality of our air and water and in this case the epa is putting a company s profit ahead of our natural resources and the public s health madigan said in a statement
the epa under administrator scott pruitt left racine county off its list despite an agency staff analysis of ozone levels in wisconsin published in december which found that the county s air exceeded federal ozone limits
wisconsin governor scott walker who supports bringing foxconn to wisconsin tweeted on tuesday that the state would work with epa to implement a plan that continues to look out for the best interest of wisconsin s state assembly last year voted to approve a bill that paves the way for a billion incentives package for a proposed by foxconn
