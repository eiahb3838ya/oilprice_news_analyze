update 2-engie fast-tracks reactor restart as belgium faces power shortfall
belgium facing tight power supply due to nuclear outages grid operator says needs up to mw additional capacity says can not rule out power rationing adds grid operator statement background by alissa de carbonnel brussels sept reuters french gas and power group engie said on friday that maintenance work at its belgian nuclear reactor tihange would end earlier than planned which could ease concerns over tight electricity supply
belgium is facing an unprecedented power supply deficit ahead of winter with only one of seven nuclear reactors operated by engie s belgian unit electrabel scheduled to have been operational in november
the change in repair work will bring the number up to two
electricity grid operator elia warned on wednesday that belgium was facing a tough supply situation due to the outage of the reactors which accounts for percent of its installed capacity
with just a few weeks to go before winter starts belgium is facing the unexpected unavailability of multiple nuclear power stations a situation that is severely testing the balance between generation and consumption elia said in a statement
without an additional megawatts mw to mw of capacity elia said it can not always guarantee security of supply without a power rationing or load shedding plan
elia said it was talking to the belgian government and power operators but security of supply was not guaranteed for november the most critical month and it did not see solutions that could fully resolve the supply issue
which is why even if the belgian and international markets provide us with all available capacity we can not yet rule out the need to activate the plan elia said
fears over tight supply during the winter months when demand for heating rises has push belgian power contracts new highs
engie said tihange will now be shut for maintenance from until instead of until
electrabel operates two more reactors at tihange and four at doel producing about half the country s electricity
following the discovery of problems with the concrete in some of the plants outages were prolonged at its tihange and reactors
engie has faced criticism over its management of belgium s ageing nuclear plants with belgian public broadcaster rtbf running comments from an industry source accusing it of allowing degradation at its facilities
engie dismissed the report on friday saying nuclear safety is an absolute priority and that electrabel invests million euros million a year in maintenance work
the utility last week said the extended outages at belgian plants would push its net recurring income to the low end of its billion euros forecast range
