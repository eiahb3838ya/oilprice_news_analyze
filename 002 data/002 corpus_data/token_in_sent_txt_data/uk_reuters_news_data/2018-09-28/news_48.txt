german carmakers may offer diesel upgrade vouchers in compromise - faz
berlin sept reuters german carmakers may offer owners of vehicles affected by driving bans vouchers for hardware upgrades by suppliers such as baumot or hjs german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung faz reported on friday without citing sources
that would be a compromise between some german politicians who want bmw daimler and volkswagen to pay for the cost of making older diesel vehicles cleaner and the carmakers who say hardware retrofits would be much too expensive
the report by faz comes ahead of a diesel summit at the german chancellery on friday in which the government will try to agree by an deadline a way to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles without resorting to further driving bans
any solution is likely to cost several billion euros and transport minister andreas scheuer said this week his plan would not require taxpayer funds or money from the car owners putting the onus on carmakers instead
a coalition committee is to meet on monday to sign off on any decisions
faz said the voucher scheme would apply to some diesel vehicles meeting the euro emissions standard and would cover percent of the cost of upgrades up to a maximum level of euros per vehicle faz said
older vehicles meeting the euro standard would not be covered but their owners would be offered incentives to swap their vehicles for new ones
a person familiar with the matter told reuters on thursday that volkswagen was prepared to support hardware retrofits reversing its position and bowing to pressure that has mounted in the three years since it admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests
