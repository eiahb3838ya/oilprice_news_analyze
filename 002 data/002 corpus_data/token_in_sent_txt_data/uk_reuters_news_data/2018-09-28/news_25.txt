u.s. oil industry trade group urges trump to drop e15 biofuel deal
new york sept reuters the largest oil trade association urged president donald trump on friday to halt any plans to lift a ban on summer sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline and impose tighter trading restrictions on biofuel credits saying such a move would be unfair to consumers
the opposition by the american petroleum institute api means trump would need to disappoint a key energy constituency in order to move forward with the plan to help midwestern farmers by expanding sales of ethanol ahead of november s congressional elections
trump has repeatedly said he wants a solution to the nation s controversial biofuels policy which has support from both the rival corn and oil industries
this deal does nothing to fix the program it makes things worse api director frank macchiarola said on friday
it is giving away the store to the ethanol lobby and giving the consumers the the api which is concerned that expanding ethanol sales would cut into its market share believes as many as percent of cars are incompatible with gasoline and risk losing their warranty if it is put into the gas tank macchiarola said
the renewable fuel association disputes the api figure saying in a tweet that percent of cars in the united states can safely use
as part of the deal the white house is considering imposing restrictions on trading of biofuel credits in an effort to discourage speculation and reduce costs for oil refiners to comply with biofuels policy reuters reported
the renewable fuel standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool each year or buy credits from competitors who do
refining companies that must buy the credits have complained about volatile prices in recent years
the trade restrictions would include capping the number of credits a dealer can hold at percent of their company s annual compliance obligation and potentially also restricting certain parties from holding the credits for more than days
macchiarola said such restrictions would hurt liquidity in the rin market and do more harm than good
biofuel credit prices were near highs last year but have dropped sharply to their lowest since due mainly to the epa s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations
