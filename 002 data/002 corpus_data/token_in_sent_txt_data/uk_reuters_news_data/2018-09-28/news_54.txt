china says there are still 'weak links' in environmental compliance
shanghai reuters china still has to address a series of weak links in enforcing pollution rules the environment ministry said on friday after publishing its latest investigations into the compliance records of seven provinces and regions
china has been sending inspection teams across the country to find out whether local authorities have tackled environmental failings uncovered during previous probes
of the violations identified in the provinces of shanxi liaoning anhui fujian hunan and guizhou as well as the municipality of tianjin had already been fixed by the ministry of ecology and environment said on its website
but some regions were chasing success when it comes to fixing environmental problems and were not doing enough to rectify violations it said
china has been taking action against officials for failing to implement state policies as part of the government s war on pollution
the environment ministry has previously said that it had uncovered dozens of acts of fraud including equipment tampering by local governments and enterprises and complained in june that some authorities continued to prefer form over substance when it came to rectifying environmental problems
in recent inspection campaigns china has been focusing on the cleaning up of black and stinking urban water supplies and the removal of illegal construction on protected nature reserves
it has sought to enforce new emissions standards in sectors like steel and thermal power
in documents published by the ministry on friday local governments said they were now planning to spend heavily to try to comply with state environmental policies
southwestern china s guizhou one of the country s poorest regions said it had accumulated a total fund of billion yuan billion to spend on improving drinking water supplies building urban environmental infrastructure and treating pollution caused by livestock farming and heavy metal mining
china s biggest coal producing region of shanxi has also set up a environmental fund of billion yuan dedicated to improving air water and soil quality it said
