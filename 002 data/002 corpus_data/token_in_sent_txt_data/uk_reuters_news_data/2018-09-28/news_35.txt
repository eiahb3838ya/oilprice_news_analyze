feature-urban transformation: shopping by kayak in denmark's greenest neighbourhoods
copenhagen sept thomson reuters foundation kayaking along canals to pick up your groceries walking a few minutes to the metro station or cycling down pedestrianised streets to meet the neighbours if you want to live in copenhagen s north harbour a car would be obsolete
that at least is the aim of architect rita justesen
since she has been tasked with transforming the former industrial harbour in denmark s capital into a neighbourhood and ensuring its million square metres of residential and commercial floor space is financially viable and
that means cars tucked away inconveniently in centralised carparks to discourage driving more cycle paths canals and harbour pools clean enough to swim in and the construction of a metro station for its projected residents and workers by
as nations race to reach ambitious climate goals to lower carbon emissions many cities have been looking to sustainable urban designs to help residents cut energy use boost social and cohesion and cope with rising heat and flooding
designing spaces that acknowledge the impact of climate change can help to change behaviour and make it easier for people to live greener lives according to a report by the british psychological society
we said we would make a sustainable city the copenhagen way
that means that to live sustainably it has to be easy
so that means short distances to the metro shops and recreational functions justesen lead architect at city firm by havn told the thomson reuters foundation
we also really want to make an attractive district where people want to live and stay that for us is also sustainable in the long term said justesen as she walked past construction sites in north harbour which has housed residents since
around the world cities use more than of the world s energy and account for about of carbon dioxide emissions according to the united nations
with rapid urbanisation more than of people will live in cities by the projects
that is why cities are seen as key to meeting the commitment under the paris agreement of reducing emissions to keep the rise in global temperatures to well below degrees celsius above levels
a celsius rise would give vulnerable populations a chance of surviving climate shocks like flooding cyclones droughts and higher sea levels experts say
worldwide sea levels have risen centimetres inches since the late century driven up by melting ice and a natural expansion of water in the oceans as they warm united nations data show
a panel of climate scientists said in that sea levels could rise by up to a metre by
surrounded by open waters and prone to heavy rainfall copenhagen faces the same risks as poorer cities
the sea level around the harbour city is expected to rise by up to one metre over the next century according to the danish meteorological institute
copenhagen council estimated that if there were no form of protection from flooding due to storm surges the damage over the next century would cost up to billion danish krone billion
by comparison it would cost up to four billion danish krone million to prevent this from happening
apart from itself from the rise and flooding from green roofs and parks that absorb rainwater to large barriers that can curb flooding the city is also on a mission to become the first capital to cut emissions by
if we look at global development we see an increase in populations in cities and it s a really huge number
and if investments are not then climate change will be impossible to solve jorgen abildgaard director of the city s climate programme told the thomson reuters foundation
like justesen architect peter said creating spaces that help people cope with climate shocks has been at the core of all his designs at danish firm gehl
but fostering social cohesion and interactions are also crucial for sustainable cities of the future he said
the projects i ve been working on have had this focus on the environment socially financially nature to create better cities for the people living there and also to do something positive for the environment he said at his studio
cited the positive effects of a redevelopment project he worked on in the town of kokkedal kilometres miles north of copenhagen
though the rundown area had a reputation for crime and gangs it was revitalised through features like better lighting for improved safety green spaces and community gardens
it s no longer the ghetto but it s transformed into lively neighbourhoods with a new identity said
it s great that you can do a solution like that and at the same time you solve these climate challenges he said
