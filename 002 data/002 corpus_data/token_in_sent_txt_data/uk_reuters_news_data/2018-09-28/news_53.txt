focus-e.on targets innovations for smart energy future
frankfurt reuters germany s biggest power supplier wants smart homes to be smart business in a world of decentralized energy markets
that s why it teamed up this week with tech giant microsoft to produce a digital dashboard of all the electrical devices in a home from heating systems to solar panels to battery storage systems to electric cars
set to go on sale next year s home energy management system will be one of a range of products on offer from big german utility companies desperate to increase profits from their networks of millions of electricity and gas customers
faced with the prospect of flat earnings from just selling power german utilities are offering products from smoke alarms electronic door locks ev charging kits broadband and even the amazon prime delivery service to generate higher returns
they re also trying to get as many new customers as possible on board now to build brand loyalty for when complex smart homes become the norm rather than the exception and need technology to run efficiently
since announced plans in march to merge with rival innogy it has stepped up a race with vattenfall enbw and smaller utilities to persuade german customers to switch providers offering signing bonuses such as ipads washing machines or hundreds of euros in cash
the value of customers today is different from three to four years ago because customers have become more active said victoria ossadnik chief executive of s retail division energie deutschland
a study by consultants mckinsey company showed that earnings before interest and taxes ebit from downstream power activities in the european union will grow by a third to billion euros in the years to
but none of the increase will come from classic power supply said mckinsey tiziano bruno one of the authors of the study here published in may
bruno said the increase will come from a billion euro billion rise in the value of energy efficiency services to billion and that s why utility companies are set on customers now and coming up with new products
investors welcome the shift after years of underperformance by utilities when low wholesale power prices led to operational losses and plants were driven out of the market by renewable energy in germany s drive towards energy
german utilities have woken up and are working hard to ensure the customer side does not slip through their fingers said thomas deser a fund manager at union investment which holds percent of shares
if they manage to combine software hardware and services there is a great chance they ll keep working with the already has million private residential accounts in germany besides companies municipalities and cities and its drive for new clients helped it add in the first six months of
once it combines forces with innogy next year it will command a customer base of million retail clients across europe in countries such as the united kingdom the netherlands sweden italy czech republic hungary slovakia and romania
engaged in a similar offensive vattenfall which has million german household power accounts has added power and gas customers so far this year german chief tuomo hatakka told reuters this month
enbw has million household customers in germany
one of the challenges for big utility companies is to ensure they can hang onto new customers to make the cost of acquiring them worthwhile and to develop brand loyalty for the future
germany bundesnetzagentur here the regulator for several sectors including electricity and gas said million people switched power accounts in while million negotiated improved terms with their existing supplier
ralf kurtz a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers estimates that power companies will need to keep new clients for at least two years for the exercise to become viable
the utilities then need to ensure they are the ones offering products that will let people manage their energy supplies in an efficient way rather than allowing disruptors with experience of consumer data and digital market places to steal the show
announcing its deal with microsoft to create a digital dashboard of electrical devices said the market for home management systems in europe was a year but this could rise to at least within three years
digitisation internet of things and artificial intelligence provide us with new opportunities to offer customers increased efficiency and convenience said board member karsten wildberger
development bank kfw said in a study last month that while only percent of german households use smart energy devices to optimize electricity and heat consumption percent can imagine using them
digital smart meters which monitor consumption and feed data back to power suppliers have yet to take off in germany unlike other eu countries such as italy and the united kingdom
the expected demand in germany for more smart energy devices is why the big power companies are scouring the market to snap up promising startups to ensure they stay in the driving seat
an organization that has to involve itself with its daily business is unlikely to simply be able to produce disruptive innovation said uli huener head of innovation at enbw
it has adopted a strategy it lets employees develop ideas in an internal incubator it has put million euros into the enbw new ventures fund to buy minority stakes in startups and it also has set up an internal company builder to help get innovative ideas up and running
a division of called agile said on wednesday it had chosen six european startups with energy related products for a sponsorship program with a view to starting pilot schemes that could lead to commercial products
already cooperates with companies such as tado and nuki offering smart products like thermostats and electronic door locks and last month it also joined enbw and berlin investment bank ibb here in a financing round for startup lumenaza
the german software company has developed a system it calls that monitors renewable power production manages groups balancing supply and demand links renewable producers to customers and organizes billing
creating digital marketplaces for renewable energy suppliers from a wind farm to a home is seen as a significant opportunity in germany where there are already million private households with solar panels
the realization that the energy future is green fragmented and decentralized has now arrived at the highest management level said lumenaza s managing director christian chudoba
