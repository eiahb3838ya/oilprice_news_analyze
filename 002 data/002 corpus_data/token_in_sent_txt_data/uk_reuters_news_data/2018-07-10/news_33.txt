update 1-hapag-lloyd ceo says cutting costs as fuel prices rise
frankfurt reuters german shipping company is cutting costs to cope with a rise in fuel prices that led it to slash full year earnings forecasts last month its chief executive told shareholders on tuesday
major cost positions have risen more than initially expected and are pressuring operating margins ceo rolf habben jansen said in hamburg
we are responding to this development through forceful cost management and will keep competitive this way he added
among the measures being taken are accepting more valuable cargo trying to reduce terminal contract costs and stripping out economically inefficient ship systems he said
the effects of recent industry mergers have yet to be felt as the integration process is only just starting he added referring to a merger in april of three japanese rivals and chinese approval for cosco shipping holdings takeover of hong kong peer orient overseas international
habben jansen made no mention however of a reuters report on monday that bigger french rival cam cgm had made a merger approach which sent shares up to percent higher
in june cut its profit forecast saying freight rates had recovered more slowly than expected while fuel costs had ballooned as global oil prices respond to supply disruptions and tightness
the news led to several banks cutting their price targets on the stock while the company stressed it hoped to reap substantial synergies from its merger with arab peer uasc
habben jansen also said the global ship orderbook had shrunk to just percent of the total fleet
that should help bring supply and demand into a better balance over the next to three years he said
at the same time world shipping demand could rise percent per year which should result in freight rate increases from the second half of onwards
but the ceo also said increased geopolitical uncertainty as the world s leading economies head for a trade war was acutely felt by container liners and their customers
last month said it has stopped one of two feeder services to iran and would decide on the remaining one before a deadline imposed by the united states
the company s shares were down percent at gmt
