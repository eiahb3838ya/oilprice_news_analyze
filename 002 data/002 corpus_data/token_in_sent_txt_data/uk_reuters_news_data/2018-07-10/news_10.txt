update 3-cme, cheniere to develop first u.s. lng futures contract
adds quotes from cme and analysts by scott disavino july reuters cme group inc said on tuesday it will develop the first physically deliverable liquefied natural gas futures contract as growing worldwide demand has made the united states a key lng exporter
cme said the contract will take delivery at cheniere energy inc s sabine pass lng export terminal in louisiana
it could not say when it will launch the new product or provide details other than that it will trade on the cme s new york mercantile exchange nymex like its henry hub natural gas futures
overall world lng consumption has risen to a record billion cubic feet per day bcfd in from just bcfd in and is expected to keep growing by about percent a year through according to energy data
while lng trade on exchanges like the cme is still small experts believe volumes will increase rapidly in the near future as the united states becomes one of the world s biggest lng exporters
total lng export capacity is expected to rise to bcfd of gas in from bcfd now making the country the lng exporter in the world by capacity in
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
we have spoken to the market and they have expressed a desire to have a physically delivered lng contract that can help them manage price risks said peter keavey global head of energy at cme
pricing at cheniere s sabine pass is currently linked to the henry hub gas benchmark traded on cme s nymex
sabine pass was the first terminal in the lower states to produce and deliver lng for export to the world
cheniere is the biggest buyer of gas in the united states consuming over bcfd and is expected to increase purchases as more liquefaction trains at sabine pass and its corpus christi lng export terminal enter service
the company s current consumption represents almost percent of total projected gas production of bcfd in
with cheniere behind the cme futures contract the odds would favor the cme contract especially if cheniere immediately starts to sell its lng on a sabine pass contract basis said dominick chirichella director risk management trading and advisory services at emi dtn in new york
the lng market is in transition with a shift from towards contracts
current users of lng derivatives include big commodity trading houses like trafigura vitol and gunvor
i would surmise that in say five years there will be robust derivatives markets in lng said craig pirrong a finance professor specializing in commodities at the university of houston
