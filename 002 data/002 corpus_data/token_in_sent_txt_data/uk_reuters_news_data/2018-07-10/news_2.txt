update 9-oil rises on supply disruptions, large u.s. crude stock drawdown
new york reuters oil rose on tuesday supported by a expected stock draw and supply concerns in norway and libya though gains were tempered by the united states indication that it would consider requests for waivers from iranian oil sanctions

both crude benchmarks retreated from near highs after secretary of state mike pompeo said the united states would consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions on iranian oil
that basically took the wind out of the sails from the market said phil flynn analyst at price futures group in chicago
but it isn t unlike anything that they ve said before
but it all depends on which countries they re talking about

is it india
is it temporary waivers last month the united states said it wanted to reduce oil exports of producer iran to zero by november
still brent was buoyed by a strike by hundreds of workers on norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs leading to the shutdown of one oilfield
also bullish to prices was plummeting production in libya where output has halved in five months to barrels per day
working in the opposite direction of the norwegian oil workers strike and the geopolitical situation was the update on the syncrude oil sands facility said yawger at mizuho
on monday suncor energy said its syncrude facility would resume some production in july earlier than expected following an outage last month that disrupted total output and sent prices higher
the updated timeline has muted price gains and widened the difference between the two benchmarks said yawger
meanwhile members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries led by saudi arabia have agreed to boost output
still there is concern that doing so will use up global spare capacity and leave markets vulnerable to further or unexpected production declines
