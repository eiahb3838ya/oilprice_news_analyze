curb new nuclear plants and back renewables, uk government advisers say
london reuters britain should not back more than one new nuclear plant after hinkley point c is built before because renewable energy is the lowest cost for consumers an independent advisory group to the government said on tuesday
britain plans to build a new fleet of nuclear plants to replace ageing coal and nuclear reactors set to close in the as well as to help cut the country s carbon emissions
however private investors have proved reluctant to take on the huge costs of new nuclear plants and the government has come under fire for agreeing to pay a price for electricity from edf s hinkley point c plant due to come online by the end of which is way above rival power projects
last month the government said it might invest directly in another new nuclear plant planned by a unit of japan s hitachi
however the national infrastructure commission said moving to an electricity system powered by renewable energy sources could be the safest bet in the long term and be the lowest cost outcome for consumers
according to its calculations the cost of an electricity generation mix with a high quantity of renewables would be comparable to building further nuclear plants after hinkley point c and cheaper than implementing carbon capture and storage on fossil fuel plants
established in the commission is an independent body to provide advice to the government on how best to meet the country s infrastructure needs
in its first ever assessment for the government which it is required to produce once every parliament the commission recommended steps should be taken to ensure renewables account for percent of electricity generation by
currently around percent of britain s electricity comes from renewables such as wind and solar power up from percent five years ago
an energy system based on renewables and the technologies required to balance them may prove cheaper than building further nuclear plants as the cost of these technologies is far more likely to fall and at a faster rate the commission said
the national infrastructure assessment therefore cautions against a rush to agree government support for multiple new nuclear power stations and proposes that after hinkley point c in somerset the government should agree support for only one more nuclear plant before it added
the government has up to a year to respond to the commission s recommendations
