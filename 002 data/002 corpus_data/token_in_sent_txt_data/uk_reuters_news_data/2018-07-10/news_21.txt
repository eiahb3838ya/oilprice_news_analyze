update 5-hundreds of norway oil workers go on strike, shell shuts knarr field
oslo reuters hundreds of workers on norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal leading to the shutdown of one field and helping send brent crude prices higher
one union said hundreds more workers would join the strike on sunday if an agreement over union demands for a wage increase and pension rights was not reached
royal dutch shell said that due to the strike it was temporarily closing production at its knarr field which has a daily output of barrels of mostly oil but also natural gas liquids and natural gas
shutting the field whose owners are idemitsu wintershall and dea could take up to hours it said
norway is western europe s biggest oil producer
the disruption added to a rise in global oil supply outages and helped push brent crude up percent to per barrel
the output of norway s biggest oil producer equinor formerly known as statoil was not affected so far the company said even though it was shutting drilling operations at its snorre b platform
shortly after a midnight deadline passed a mediator said talks between two trade unions safe and ys and the shipowners association representing the rig employers had failed to reach a deal
the parties were so far apart from each other there was no point presenting a proposal that could be recommended to both sides mediator carl petter martinsen said in a statement
the safe union wants pension rights to be the same for everyone regardless of whether an employee is new to a company or has many years of experience
it also wants wages for drilling workers to match those of workers for oil companies which are higher
the norwegian shipowners association said safe was asking for a norwegian crown pounds salary increase for unskilled workers equivalent to about percent of current wages
the leader of safe said she did not recognise the figures presented by the shipowners association
around workers would walk out from tuesday with an additional employees joining them from midnight on sunday if the dispute is not resolved safe said in letters to the shipowners association
in total up to workers could join the action it said
norway s oil sector directly employed workers in of whom worked in production and in related services according to statistics norway
the rest were occupied in transportation through pipelines
it was the biggest strike affecting the sector since a industrial action in cut the country s output of crude by about percent and its natural gas production by about percent
talks between the two striking norwegian unions and rig employers will not resume for a few days the leader of safe rysst told reuters
we have no contact with the employers yet
it will take some days at least before we hear from them
if they want to contact us they will probably reach out to us before the bigger strike on sunday rysst said
the shipowners association representing the employers said it was keen to resolve the situation
we have no scheduled contacts as of now but we have every will to seek a solution jakob korsgaard lead negotiator for the shipowners association told reuters
the effect of a strike like this is substantial he did not specify whether the association would contact the unions before sunday s strike escalation
industri energi the union which represents the majority of norwegian oil drilling workers concluded a wage deal earlier this year with the shipowners association and is not on strike
safe said workers from the teekay petrojarl production ship operating at shell s knarr field would walk out initially
norway pumped million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids a day in according to bp s statistical review published in june
natural gas production was billion cubic metres last year bp reported making norway the world s seventh biggest producer and europe s largest gas supplier after russia
safe said workers on rigs that conduct exploration or production drilling for oil firms would also walk out on tuesday
that includes workers from the transocean spitsbergen rig from the songa offshore enabler from odfjell drilling s deepsea stavanger and from north atlantic drilling s west elara rig
others set to join the action include archer drilling workers on the snorre b platform operated by equinor from cosl working on the cosl innovator rig from island offshore a supply vessel firm and from the kca deutag modu drilling contractor working on the askeladden rig
