shell looks to meet growth in lng trucking in asia
singapore reuters royal dutch shell is planning to build a truck loading facility at its hazira liquefied natural gas lng terminal on india s west coast as it looks to meet demand from industrial users a top company official said on friday
the facility which could be ready by next year will be used to supply industrial demand through trucking in places that can t access supply from the grid said steve hill executive vice president at shell energy
it has a big potential growth in india because energy supply reliability is a big issue in india he said at a media briefing in singapore referring to lng being transported in trucks to industrial users
there hasn t been as much supply infrastructure in place but some of the import terminals are now putting the truck loading facilities in place so that s opening up that shell gas a unit of royal dutch shell plc holds a majority stake in the hazira lng terminal and port in a venture with a unit of france s total sa
lng trucking works well for locations with china and india the two obvious markets hill said
gas hauled by trailers is seen growing to a tenth of china s total gas consumption of around billion cubic metres bcm in from percent in but is a new development in india
shell expects lng demand to rise again in china this year as the world s importer of the fuel extends a program to switch from coal to cleaner gas beyond the capital beijing to large industrial cities hill said
the underlying policy that s driving this is basically community heating or small industrial users switching the boilers from coal to gas he said
this is structural demand the full effect of china s drive to switch factories and millions of homes from coal to gas to curb harmful emissions will be felt this year he added
india had the potential to be the next biggest growth market as it faced similar factors to china hill said
they are both countries with big populations developing rapidly growing economies and air quality challenges where gas has low penetration in the energy mix he said
it s harder to predict the timing in india but ultimately i m quite confident we ll see rapid growth in gas demand in reporting by jessica jaganathan editing by richard pullin
