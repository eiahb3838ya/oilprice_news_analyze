analysis-platinum's fuel-cell car bonanza proves elusive
london reuters the platinum industry has been waiting for cars to lift demand for years
now just as the technology finally looks to be gaining traction carmakers are finding ways to slash the amount of the expensive metal used
cars using fuel cells which generate electricity through a chemical reaction using hydrogen as a fuel and platinum as a catalyst comprise just a small fraction of an market dominated by battery power
both technologies have their advantages but a big obstacle to a wider rollout of vehicles has been a lack of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure
now however plans are underway to build networks in the united states germany japan and most significantly the world s biggest car market china
a number of major carmakers are building cars but they are radically reducing the amount of platinum used meaning the technology may not deliver the surge in demand for the metal that has long been flagged by some platinum producers and analysts
the companies efforts are driven by cost even at its current historically low price level platinum is still an expensive ingredient
at spot prices the grams of the metal it can take to power a car may cost more than
the amount needed for a diesel autocatalyst in comparison is worth just over at the top end

toyota s mirai prices for which start at just over in the united states is the world s car
we have been making steady progress to reduce platinum loading he said
the company is targeting further cuts that would result in levels below percent of today he added
he declined to give a precise figure for the amount of platinum used in toyota s fuel cells citing commercial sensitivities
daimler s new model the mercedes glc already uses percent less platinum than its previous fuel cell model the which was launched in
the automaker has reduced the size of its system by around
the latest model uses tens of grams per vehicle joerg wind manager of energy systems analyses at the german carmaker told an industry gathering in tokyo last week
wind said techniques such as increasing the platinum surface area used in catalysts could cut the amount of the metal needed in stacks
japan s honda and germany s audi have said they are also looking into reducing the amount of platinum they use in their vehicles though they did not specify by how much
however eradicating platinum entirely from fuel cells is not currently viable according to researchers
the large platinum reductions in fuel cells come at a time of uncertainty over the wider demand outlook for the metal in the auto industry which accounts for more than percent of consumption of the metal globally
platinum is primarily used in catalytic converters with the heaviest loadings seen in cars
diesel s market share has been shrinking in its main market europe following the volkswagen emissions scandal of
the scandal raised consumer awareness of diesel s high emissions of nitrogen oxides which can contribute to breathing problems and smog
in a further blow a court in berlin ruled last week that some german cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars
technology is still hugely overshadowed by battery power globally over million pure battery electric cars had been sold by the last year for which full figures are available versus just vehicles by the end of last year
advocates of technology say it is the greenest form of transportation available emitting only clean water though critics point out that producing hydrogen itself is energy intensive
vehicles are quicker to refuel than cars and typically have a longer range
in a major boost to technology china last month rolled out plans to promote including hydrogen refuelling capacity
the chinese push could lift fuel cells share of platinum automotive demand to as much as percent by from less than percent today according to materials specialist johnson matthey
johann wiebe lead analyst at precious metals consultancy gfms pointed to research from stanford university that suggests platinum could be substituted for cobalt in some technology in development though cobalt too is becoming pricier due to demand from battery makers hitting highs this year after surging percent in
despite the search for substitutes cutting platinum entirely from vehicle fuel cells currently doesn t look commercially feasible wiebe said
in the meantime thriftiness continues
you need to get the costs down he said
the aim is to get it down to around grams the eventual goal however is for fuel cells not to contain more platinum than a standard autocatalyst which is approximately three that would be a sizeable downward reporting by jan harvey in london additional reporting by naomi tajitsu in tokyo editing by pravin char
