access to equity markets for energy firms comes at an opportune time for private equity firms seeking to cash out of investments
investors are encouraged that crude prices have stayed above a barrel even as drilling activity pushed oil output past million barrels per day for the first time since
company fundamentals are also more resilient than months ago supporting the ipo pipeline
the stability in oil prices is a net positive
if energy companies can demonstrate to investors that they can generate cash flow in the current oil price environment they can go public said grant kernaghan citigroup s managing director of canadian investment banking
the recent volatility hasn t resulted in markets shutting down he added suggesting equity markets were still open despite a period up to when the s p dropped over percent
still experts said any selloff on the oil market that pushes crude prices below could derail these plans to go public
after ipos worth billion in the slump in oil from saw the subsequent three years raising just a combined billion from offerings according to thomson reuters data
so far this year five energy ipos have raised billion according to reuters calculations
four of these five oilfield services ipos had successful debuts while ipsco tubulars pulled its offering due to the market selloff
quintana energy services inc priced its ipo below the guidance range and then saw its stock drop further upon opening
however cactus inc sold more shares than originally planned and traded higher on its first day
unlike last year when an initial flurry of energy ipos was curtailed by a slump in crude prices bankers hope stronger fundamentals will sustain interest in new offerings in
last year services ipos were based on forward earnings and lacked existing cash flows meaning falling oil prices undermined investor confidence
now companies are well supported by current earnings and trade at low multiples said robert santangelo of equity capital markets for the americas at credit suisse
so far exploration and production e p companies have not shown the same willingness as services firms to accept a lower valuation that would restart offerings from that space creating a mexican between potential ipo candidates over who goes first according to one energy banker who spoke on condition of anonymity
covey has an incentive to go first a financing agreement that becomes more expensive if it is not able to list this year according to one of the sources aware of the ipo plans
even as companies prepare for ipos m a remains a viable exit option for buyout firms
private equity firms have been waiting for a better environment
the settling of the oil price does help them move forward said kevin headland senior investment strategist at manulife investments
