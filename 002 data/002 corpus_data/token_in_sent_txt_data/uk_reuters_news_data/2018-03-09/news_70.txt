global lng-global gas markets ease as traders handle papua outage; winter demand drops
papua new guinea quake triggers lng force majeure by exxon but warmer weather approaches for north asia europe gas demand to drop as spring breaks out in northern hemisphere by henning gloystein singapore march reuters global liquefied natural gas lng prices eased this week as the market digested the impact of the earthquake in papua new guinea that in late february knocked out exxonmobil s export facility just as extreme cold in europe spiked heating demand there
the sudden shortages triggered a rush for spot cargoes in the pacific and atlantic as utilities scrambled to meet demand pushing up prices earlier in march
exxon s outage in papua new guinea will last for weeks after the company declared force majeure last friday on its exports and has to assess damage to the remote gas processing facility and over km miles of pipeline to the lng export terminal
a company declares a force majeure when it is unable to fulfil a contract because of forces beyond its control
while some buyers reportedly bought lng spot cargoes at around per million british thermal units mmbtu in the immediate wake of the papua outage to meet demand multiple traders this week said overall lng market conditions were easing due to the onset of the low demand spring season across the northern hemisphere
asia spot lng prices were around per mmbtu on friday down from the previous week
weather data in thomson reuters eikon shows temperatures in tokyo beijing and seoul three core demand centres for lng in north asia to rise to around double their seasonal norms within the next two weeks implying a sharp in gas demand for heating
in europe where a spat of extreme cold caused prices to spike to records last week temperatures have also returned to seasonal norms and are expected to rise further in the coming weeks as winter ends
although lng markets are expected to ease during the upcoming low demand spring in the northern hemisphere katie bays an energy analyst at
height securities said in a note that markets were overall getting tighter due to structural demand increases especially in china where a government gasification programme is moving millions of households and factories from coal to gas
though prices have come in they remain around supported by outages in papua new guinea and by a sudden cold snap in northwest europe which sent uk gas prices soaring last week bays said
china s natural gas imports surged by more than a quarter last year and it overtook south korea as the world s importer of lng
only japan buys more although most analysts expect china to pass japan in the coming years as well
since china has significant domestic gas production and also has large pipelines feeding it from central asia its utilities only scale up lng purchases in the spot market when their demand can not be met otherwise especially during peak demand in the winter
the market will see a very tight winter next year with little new capacity set to come online bays said
low demand lulls during spring and tight winters triggering a wave of chinese buying will likely result in greater price volatility she added
