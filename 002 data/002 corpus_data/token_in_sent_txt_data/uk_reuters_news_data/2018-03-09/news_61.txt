update 2-trump-kim talks "some weeks" away - tillerson
changes slug adds background and russian foreign minister comments djibouti march reuters talks between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un will take some weeks to arrange secretary of state rex tillerson said on friday
trump said on thursday he was prepared to meet kim in what would be the first encounter between any leaders of the two countries
it potentially marks a major breakthrough in easing tensions over pyongyang s nuclear weapons programme
president trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would willingly meet with kim when conditions were right tillerson said
and i think in the president s judgment that time has arrived the decision was made by the president himself tillerson said during a visit to djibouti
now it s a question of agreeing on the timing of the first meeting between the two of them and that will take some weeks before we get all that worked trump has derided kim as a maniac referred to him as little rocket man and threatened in a speech to the united nations last year to totally destroy north korea if it attacked the united states or one of its allies
kim responded by calling the president a mentally deranged dotard
trump s aides have been wary of north korea s diplomatic overtures because of its history of reneging on international commitments and the failure of efforts on disarmament by previous administrations
some officials and experts worry north korea could buy time to build up and refine its nuclear arsenal if it drags out talks with washington
tillerson said the united states was surprised at how kim was in his conversations with a visiting south korean delegation
he said it was the strongest indication to date of kim s not just willingness but really his desire for talks
kim has committed to denuclearisation and to suspending nuclear and missile tests south korea s national security office head chung said on thursday after briefing trump on a meeting south korean officials held with kim earlier this week
china s foreign minister wang yi called on the united states and north korea to hold talks as soon as possible saying that at a news briefing in beijing on thursday that things will not be smooth sailing
russia believes that a possible meeting between trump and kim is a step in the right direction foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters while on a visit to ethiopia
