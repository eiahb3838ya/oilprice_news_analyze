we re looking at our options
investing in petrochemicals obviously is one of things that s on the books that we re evaluating right in response to a reporter s question coffman said the possible impact of tariffs approved by president donald trump on an expansion was unknown
obviously it s too early to tell that as well he said
we don t have the project about the coming change to maritime fuel in coffman said those refineries with coking capacity would benefit the most
cokers process residual crude from which most maritime fuel is made
cokers convert residual crude into fuel feedstocks or petroleum coke a substitute for coal
