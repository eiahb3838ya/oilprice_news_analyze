interview-turkish cypriots vow to launch gas search unless greek side pulls back
nicosia reuters turkish cypriots will launch their own exploration for oil and gas around cyprus if greek cypriots persist with their own plans their foreign minister said on friday as an uneasy standoff lingered over offshore resources
greek cypriots who run cyprus s internationally recognised government have licensed several offshore blocks to multinationals for oil and gas exploration
but italy s eni abandoned a scheduled drill last month because of the presence of turkish military vessels
a division of exxonmobil is due to launch an exploration attempt this year
either we will do it together by discussing agreeing and moving together or things will stop or we turkish cypriots will do the same thing we will start exploiting and drilling as well said kudret ozersay foreign minister of northern cyprus a breakaway state recognised only by turkey
turkey has vowed to prevent what it sees as a unilateral move by greek cypriots but eu member cyprus has shown no signs of backing down
brussels has urged turkey to avoid threats and refrain from actions that could damage relations with the bloc
asked whether the dispute could escalate ozersay said diplomacy would be the first tool we aim at cooling down the waters not warming them for that reason in the most recent incident we did not use force
we did not even demonstrate force
there was deterrence there he said adding the turkish cypriot side had pursued diplomacy before then
torn apart in a turkish invasion in after a coup seeds of division were sown earlier when a arrangement between greek and turkish cypriots crumbled amid violence just three years after the former british colony gained independence
greek cypriots were left running the internationally recognised government
our argument on the issue of maritime areas is not based on geography ozersay said to an observation that cyprus has only licensed maritime exploration areas lying south of the island where it exercises effective control and not to the north
it is based on historic rights and the rights deriving from the partnership republic he said from his office less than km miles from a checkpoint where hundreds of cypriots cross daily between the two sides
the thing is not only the turkish cypriot side but also the international community and the greek cypriot side accepts and acknowledges that we are the of those hydrocarbon resources ozersay said
greek cypriots have repeatedly said a peace deal would allow both communities to benefit from any offshore resources and have baulked at including the issue in reunification discussions
but peace talks collapsed last year with no sign of resuming soon
the talks ended primarily over a dispute on the role turkey would play in a cyprus
ankara has more than troops in northern cyprus and greek cypriots insist their departure be integral to any deal
although the sides have agreed in principle to unite cyprus as a bicommunal bizonal federation based on political equality they do not have the same interpretation of what that means ozersay said
we don t understand the same thing from the same sentence
we are repeating the same sentence but we don t understand the same thing
