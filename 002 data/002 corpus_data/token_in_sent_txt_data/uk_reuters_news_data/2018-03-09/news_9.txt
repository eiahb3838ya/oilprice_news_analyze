new york governor requests to exclude state from offshore drilling program
reuters new york governor andrew cuomo on friday said he had formally asked for the state to be excluded from a federal offshore drilling program that he said would threaten its ocean resources and endanger efforts toward a cleaner energy economy
new york state strongly opposes the department of the interior s national outer continental shelf oil and gas leasing program as it poses an unacceptable threat to new york s ocean resources to our economy and to the future of our children cuomo said in announcing the exclusion request
the program launched by the federal government in early january proposes to make over percent of the total offshore acreage available to oil and gas drilling
the plan would open two areas of the north atlantic coast adjacent to new york state for fossil fuel exploration according to a statement from cuomo s office
as the number three ocean economy in the nation new york stands to lose nearly jobs and billions of dollars generated through tourism and fishing industries should the exclusion not be granted cuomo said
instead of protecting our waters from another oil spill like the one that devastated the gulf this new federal plan only increases the chances of another disaster taking place he said
florida was granted exemption from the program on the grounds that the state relies heavily on tourism
interior department spokeswoman heather swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment
new york is one of several states that has asked to be exempted from the drilling plan and interior has said it is considering the requests and holding discussions with states as it finalises the proposal over the coming months
officials with at least two states california and washington promised to take additional steps toward thwarting the plan
in letters to the interior department last month they said they would block permits for transporting oil from new offshore rigs through their states
in an effort to promote renewable energy in the new york cuomo also announced billion in awards for renewable energy projects across the state
the awards driven by the clean energy standard mandate to obtain percent of new york s electricity from renewable energy sources by are expected to generate enough clean renewable energy to power more than homes and create over and jobs the statement said
