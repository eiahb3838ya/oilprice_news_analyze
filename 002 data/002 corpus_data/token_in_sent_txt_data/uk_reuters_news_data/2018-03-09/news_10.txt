update 1-france wants to renegotiate offshore wind projects-les echos
adds detail background paris march reuters the french government wants to renegotiate and possibly cancel offshore wind projects on the french west coast that were awarded in and the financial daily les echos reported on friday
the paper said the government as part of a package of laws submitted to the senate had included an amendment proposing the renegotiation or possible cancellation of the tender awards for a combined megawatt of wind power on six sites
government officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the les echos report
france awarded tenders in for a combined offshore capacity of mw representing investment of about billion euros to two consortia one led by edf and one by spanish utility iberdrola
it was followed by a tender for mw worth some billion euros won by engie
edf declined to comment
iberdrola and engie could not immediately be reached for comment
the projects were expected to produce their first power early in the but fierce local opposition has blocked progress and none of the utilities have yet decided to proceed
both tenders were awarded with contracts to sell power at around euros per mw
but since then prices for offshore wind power have more than halved and french energy regulator cre has criticised the high cost of the planned subsidies
les echos said the draft legislation noted that since technological progress had led to a substantial drop in costs the state might want to renegotiate terms
if that was not possible it could cancel the projects and launch new tenders
wind industry officials had said at a conference this week on the french offshore wind sector that they feared the government wanted to renegotiate the tender terms which they said would be a bad signal for investment in the industry
france has huge coastlines and major potential for wind but has not installed a single offshore wind turbine park while germany britain denmark and other european countries have built offshore wind parks with thousands of megawatts capacity
