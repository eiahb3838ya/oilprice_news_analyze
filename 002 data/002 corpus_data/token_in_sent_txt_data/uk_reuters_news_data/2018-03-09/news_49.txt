turkey's planned $20 bln russian-built nuclear plant facing delay
march reuters turkey s first nuclear power plant is likely to miss its target date as russian builder rosatom struggles to find local partners two people familiar with the matter said
the billion project is part of president tayyip erdogan s vision marking years since the founding of modern turkey
rosatom is looking at four turkish companies as possible partners but little progress has been made so far said one of the sources both of whom declined to be identified because the information is not yet public
rosatom said last month it was in talks with power producer euas after a deal with a consortium of three firms collapsed
concrete progress has not been made in the talks so far and this includes euas from the government side one source said adding that rosatom was keen to have a government entity such as euas as a shareholder
rosatom is looking for turkish partners to take a percent stake in the planned akkuyu nuclear plant in southern turkey
but the government is wary of euas taking on the percent stake by itself
a percent stake still means billion of funding even if it s spread over years the source said
it is a very big project there are many details and issues that need to be worked on
we can t expect this to be resolved the project is to be financed by rosatom and its partners and will involve loans from agencies and banks anastasia polovinkina director of rosatom affiliate rusatom energy international told a conference in june
the megawatt akkuyu plant is a intended to reduce turkey s dependence on energy imports but has been beset by delays since russia was awarded the contract in
but turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal two industry sources said
the firms are also worried that the guaranteed electricity price could eventually be lowered reducing future revenue they said
rosatom did not respond to a request for comment
officials for euas and the government declined to comment
rosatom last year said it would sell percent of akkuyu nukleer as the company which will build and operate the plant to a consortium made up of kolin insaat kalyon insaat and cengiz holding turkish firms that have been awarded major infrastructure projects under erdogan
however the final agreement was never signed and rosatom said kolin and kalyon had decided to pull out of the project
cengiz remains as a contractor and rosatom said last month that the two were in talks regarding other partnership options
rosatom has said it expects to find new investors for the project this year adding that could be a single investor for the entire percent or several firms taking smaller stakes
at a november news conference with erdogan russian president vladimir putin the launch for the plant s first reactor and said construction would begin in the near future
however rosatom has still not received a full construction licence from turkey s atomic energy authority
construction time for the plant is seven years
even if it receives the licence today the target is not very realistic one of the sources familiar with the matter said
