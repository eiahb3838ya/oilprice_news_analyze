insight-ola's sputtering india electric vehicle trial a red flag for modi plan
nagpur india reuters indian firm ola s pilot project to test a fleet of electric vehicles in the western city of nagpur was expected to herald a coming revolution in the indian autos industry
so far though it has only exposed fractures in prime minister narendra modi s ambitions to make all new vehicles electric by
with an initial investment of about million million pounds ola launched the project last year at an event that had all the trappings of a state function including a big gathering and flagging off by transport minister nitin gadkari
but nine months later the program has hit a snag ola drivers unhappy with long wait times at charging stations and high operating expenses want to return their cars and switch to variants
out of ola electric car drivers interviewed by reuters in nagpur more than a dozen said they have either returned their electric taxis and switched to diesel or are planning to do so
ola had said it would make charging points available across four locations in nagpur a city of about million people for its fleet of electric vehicles but on a visit to the city in late january reuters found only about a dozen charging points
ola has since added additional charging points but is still short of its target
ola did not respond to requests for comment for this article
getting infrastructure built in the world s biggest democracy where a culture proliferates is a barrier for a lot of businesses in india
and it is proving to be the same for charging stations ola was forced to close one in nagpur last year after protests by residents angered by traffic jams caused by drivers
it took more than five months to get government clearances to begin operating another station
the hurdles faced by ola in setting up sufficient charging stations for a fleet of expensive electric cars with a limited driving range expose the challenges the indian government and automakers will face if they are to get anywhere near realising the vision
global auto makers have repeatedly warned that india is not ready for electrification saying the government must first lay down a clear policy provide incentives to encourage manufacturing of electric vehicles to bring down their cost and create the charging infrastructure
gadkari added to uncertainty when he said last month that the government will no longer draft a separate electric vehicle policy
he did not comment on the vision
the ola project has not turned out to be economically viable for either the company or its drivers said one industry source familiar with ola s strategy
the project s not flying as of now and the economics is not working out the source said
electric car sales in india one of the world s auto markets made up less than percent of annual sales of more than million passenger cars
the lack of demand is mainly because they are expensive due to high battery costs and as their range is limited and there isn t a charging infrastructure
by comparison in china in electric vehicles made up about percent of annual passenger car sales of million
the indian government had been determined to promote electric vehicle use starting with public transport and taxis to combat rising pollution and reduce the nation s dependence on imported oil
india s ambition was part of a broader move by countries like china and the united kingdom which have set similar goals
this has spurred billions of dollars in investments by carmakers like volkswagen and ford motor even as many in the industry say they are unsure who will buy the massive numbers of electric vehicles governments want them to produce
mahindra mahindra is the only electric carmaker in india and the high cost of even its model which starts at rupees pounds is a barrier for many car buyers and a for taxi drivers who can get a diesel or gasoline propelled car for about half the price
ola has deep pockets and while it has with mahindra for the pilot project its struggle to make the fleet viable in a small indian city with much less congestion and space constraints than the biggest cities like mumbai underscores the magnitude of the challenges
a shortage of stations and the limited range of cars about kilometres has meant longer queues to recharge
during summer months when batteries discharge faster and need to be recharged more the situation may worsen unless more charging points are added said several drivers none of whom wanted to be named as they feared retribution from the company
the cars are owned by ola and leased to drivers for rupees a day but many complain that the amount is too high and they need to work for hours to make a decent living given they waste hours a day on charging
one of the drivers said that after paying ola the rent for the car and shelling out rupees per day for charging he is left with about rupees at the end of a day giving him little time to rest or spend with his family
if they don t give us the charging facility why should we drive these cars said the driver who had just spent an hour waiting for his turn to charge the car and would have to wait for another minutes while it charges
ola founder and ceo bhavish aggarwal told reuters last april that the company would pilot a few thousand electric vehicles in several indian cities in and then scale up in a major way
however almost a year later it has still to take the experiment beyond nagpur
at india s biennial auto show in february electric cars took centre stage but most were at a concept stage or sold only in global markets as automakers like toyota honda and renault took a circumspect approach to the new tilt toward electrification
once we make an investment there are huge risks said akito tachibana managing director of toyota s india arm adding as of now there is no clarity on who would buy such cars and what incentives the government will offer
charging infrastructure is a big piece of the puzzle that needs to be resolved for evs to be viable india has only about charging stations with charging points according to a january report by global consultancy ey
analysts estimate it costs between and to set up a station and that comes on top of expensive land purchases needed to build them
the ministry of heavy industries estimates a subsidy worth billion rupees will be needed to promote evs and charging infrastructure
automakers argue in the the government should make land available and invest in building stations while over the it would need to offer incentives to private investors
one additional problem is that unlike in western countries most car owners in india do not have garages or formal parking where chargers for cars could be installed
another issue is lack of a policy outlining incentives which has helped countries like china push electric vehicle sales
government wrangling over policy formulation in india is making it difficult for carmakers to plan investments
any distraction from the focus to draw a plan for introducing electric vehicles is going to make this a exercise that might not attract the attention of the right kind of investors cautions guenter butschek managing director at tata motors
