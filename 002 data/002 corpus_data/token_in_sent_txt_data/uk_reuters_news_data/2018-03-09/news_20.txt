nigeria immigration service launches trafficking probe after staff arrests
onitsha nigeria reuters nigeria s immigration service has launched an investigation after two of its staff members were arrested on suspicion of trying to traffic girls out of the country it said on friday
thousands of girls are each year taken illegally out of africa s most populous country where percent of the million inhabitants live on less than two dollars a day
a large proportion of them arrive in europe
we received information that two of our officers were arrested yesterday at murtala muhammed international airport lagos while trying to facilitate the trafficking of some underaged girls out of the country spokesman james sunday said
the comptroller general of immigration has been briefed about this and we have started investigations he added
the spokesman did not say how many girls were involved nor did he give their ages or say where they were allegedly being taken
the movement of people out of the country by criminal gangs often by sea rather than air has become a major problem for authorities in the west african country
the british government says nigeria is the fourth largest source of human trafficking to its shores and nigerians are the largest national group among african migrants travelling to libya and trying to cross from there to italy in boats
a report by the international organisation for migration iom published last year estimated that percent of nigerian girls arriving in italy by sea might be trafficking victims
