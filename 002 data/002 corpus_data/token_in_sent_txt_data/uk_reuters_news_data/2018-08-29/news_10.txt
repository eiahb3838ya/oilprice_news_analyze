analysis-tug of war for oil sector looking to feast after famine
stavanger norway reuters after years of restraint since crude prices slumped in oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the sector recovery
oil industry suppliers say they have cut costs and prices to the bone and the recent rebound in crude justifies better rewards for anything from rigs to logistics and engineering services
their overtures have met with stubborn resistance from producers
but there are increasing signs that something has to give including recent strikes at north sea platforms
the cost savings that we have achieved over the past three years are not sustainable said thierry pilenko executive chairman of technipfmc one of the world s biggest oil services groups
a rig that was once at pounds day is now at which is not even cash breakeven he added referring to rig rental rates
cost inflation will come back
the drilling industry working below breakeven is not the oil market is cyclical by nature if crude prices fall so does investment and then output which in turn drives up prices and oil services companies ride the rollercoaster by using the upturns to raise their prices to offset the downturns
global exploration and production spending shot up by a quarter in fell percent in jumped by about percent two years later and then tanked by more than a fifth in according to data from consultancy firm rystad energy
consequently average rig rates that were about for a floating rig in more than doubled by and then fell to about last year rystad said
it is still a feast or famine cycle the ceo of oilfield services group baker hughes lorenzo simonelli told an industry conference in the norwegian oil capital of stavanger
after benchmark oil futures contracts slumped from more than a barrel in to less than in early oil producers cut spending drastically and promised shareholders that cost discipline was here to stay
graphic signs of rising rates have begun to emerge in the united states but oil producers are loath to put the genie back in the bottle
there might be pressure on costs but we will never forget what we have learned equinor chief executive eldar saetre told the stavanger conference
indeed equinor s announcement on tuesday that it plans to drill production and exploration wells off norway during the next two decades came with a caveat
there is no room for cost inflation in those plans said arne sigve nylund head of equinor s norwegian operations
we need to deliver at the same level we are now
i call on suppliers to work with us on how to deliver at the lowest possible but with oil now trading around a barrel strikes at several of total s north sea offshore platforms are testimony to an industry wrestling with keeping efficiencies high and costs down
the way contracts are structured between producers and services will be key to the future level of costs
there is a big dichotomy now
some of the contractors are expecting to see price increases
they are almost saying it s my turn now luis araujo ceo of oil services company aker solutions said
i don t buy into that
i think we should work araujo pointed to clients such as aker bp offering contracts more akin to incentive schemes than ways to squeeze margins
in the future maybe suppliers are going to get paid by performance
so instead of getting paid by the daily rates you will be paid by how many metres you can equinor s saetre put it even more succinctly at the stavenger conference with the words of rock star bruce springsteen emblazoned on the big screen nobody wins unless everybody but given oil producers own constraints the message might not have trickled through quite yet
we have to be a bit cautious because the guys doing the presentations are the leaders
but then there is the next layer in line who are being educated to squeeze suppliers and not collaborate araujo said
