update 1-clashes shatter illusion of security in libyan capital
reuters a bout of fighting in libya s capital has laid bare the fragility of a militia cartel that had brought a veneer of stability to the city and encouraged the gradual return of foreign diplomats and plans for elections in december
major battles have become rarer in tripoli since last year as a handful of armed factions aligned with the internationally recognised government of national accord gna consolidated their control
but the ascent of four or five super militias has created resentment among groups excluded from the capital and from access to the spoils of libya s informal economy
that has heightened the risk of conflict and made the challenge of disbanding militias or integrating them into regular security forces more complex diplomats and analysts say
bringing militias to heel is seen as crucial to resolving a conflict that has divided libya since a uprising forced muammar gaddafi from power seven years ago slashing oil production and giving space to migrant smugglers and militants
fighting on monday and tuesday pitted the seventh brigade or kaniyat from tarhouna a town km miles southeast of tripoli against the tripoli revolutionaries brigades trb and the nawasi two of the capital s largest armed groups
the kaniyat and other groups from outside tripoli have noticed the success of rivals inside the city with growing unease
reports about the wealth power and extravagant lifestyles of some tripoli militia commanders have fuelled resentment
the profits from state capture now go to a narrower set of armed groups than ever before said wolfram lacher a researcher at the german swp
that s a very dangerous situation because it excludes powerful forces from access to levers of the state and administration and this is now causing those forces to build alliances against the big militias in as they launched their incursion into tripoli kaniyat denounced their rivals as the daesh islamic state of public money promising to cleanse them from the country
kaniyat made gains as tanks armoured vehicles and pickup trucks mounted with guns were deployed in densely populated residential areas of southern tripoli with explosions and heavy artillery fire echoing across the city
at least five people were killed and nearly wounded on the first day officials said
tripoli s big armed groups claim official status through the gna which is opposed by a rival government and military faction based in the east of the sprawling north african country but act with autonomy
they guard strategic buildings control tripoli s airport and have infiltrated ministries and many of the banks giving them access to coveted dollars at the official exchange rate about five times cheaper than the parallel rate
they place their people throughout the state administration particularly in positions that offer control of economic resources said lacher
since last summer an minister the mayor of tripoli and the head of the state religious authority have been among a series of senior figures to be abducted then released by militias
a key member of the gna s leadership fathi withdrew from his position after an armed group attacked his residence in june
earlier this month the national oil corporation denounced militia threats against the newly appointed head of its fuel distribution unit over efforts to tackle smuggling and the sovereign wealth fund said that it had been forced by threats and abductions to move premises
prominent libyans based abroad have said they seek the protection of armed militia factions not the government when they travel to tripoli
diplomatic staff evacuated amid fighting in and now tentatively returning ultimately depend on armed groups for access and protection
critics of a plan to hold national elections on worry that a free vote will be impossible and that militias will challenge with force any result they don t like
i think it s a race against time and i feel like the libyan state s disappearing said one senior diplomat
it s hard now to tell where s the state and where s the gaddafi s dictatorship left libya with few effective state institutions after his overthrow
