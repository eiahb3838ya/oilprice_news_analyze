nigerian vice president sees economy picking up after sluggish q2
abuja aug reuters nigeria s economy is expected to perform much better in the second half of the year vice president yemi osinbajo said on wednesday following sluggish growth in the second quarter
largely dependent on its oil reserves nigeria began climbing out of its first recession in years in as global crude prices rebounded and president muhammadu buhari s government implemented the early stages of a turnaround plan
but the recovery has been relatively slow and since the beginning of this year the pace has started to dip as the oil sector again struggles
we expect to see the growth figures doing much better osinbajo told reporters after the statistics office had released the figures earlier this week
what you are seeing today is a snapshot but if you look at the long term clearly we are going to be doing much better he said adding that a programme for million traders should begin to bear fruit in the coming months
the pace of economic recovery has been a sore point since buhari took power in on promises to rejuvenate africa s largest oil producer
flagging growth could spell trouble for buhari as he seeks in early
the vice president however said he expects a turnaround
we re very optimistic and we re going to power into the next year osinbajo said
