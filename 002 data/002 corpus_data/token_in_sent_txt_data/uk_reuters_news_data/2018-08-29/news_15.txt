refile-feature-milking it: solar coolers heat up earnings for kenya's dairy farmers
adds code by kagondu njagi kibumbu kenya aug thomson reuters foundation four years ago njeru kamuru nearly quit dairy farming
but when he learned that a plant was to be built in his kenyan village he changed his mind
before then kamuru said he struggled to sell more than half of the litres of milk his brace of cows gave during their morning and evening milking sessions
selling those six litres earned him about a dollar the rest of the milk went to his relatives on credit or was drunk by his wife and four children
breaking even was hard he said with the key problem a lack of refrigerated storage
i could spend the whole day at the farm waiting to sell milk to my fellow village customers kamuru told the thomson reuters foundation in kibumbu village in central kenya
and if the morning s milk supply was difficult to sell and it was he was at least able to pasteurize it to ensure it did not go off
the evening s milk supply was trickier
if there were no customers it all went to waste he said
others in the kibumbu dairy farmers association had the same problem so they approached the governor of tharaka nithi county and demanded that he honour a campaign pledge to construct a plant
in the facility opened using county funds
these days kamuru no longer sells milk to the villagers
his family uses two litres a day while the rest goes to the plant
the amount i deliver is recorded every day and then i am paid at the end of the month he said
kenyans often struggle with the country s unreliable electricity supply with the problem particularly acute in rural areas
for the country s dairy farmers who according to the s food and agriculture organization fao have million head of dairy cattle it s a particular problem
kibumbu s solar plant ensures that farmers like kamuru can store their milk safely day or night without it going off
the timing is good demand for dairy products is rising fast particularly in rapidly growing urban areas according to the kenya livestock producers association klpa
this means that farmers must have access to storage facilities that work around the clock without interruption said patrick kimani who heads the klpa
milk coolers provide such a typically local governments pay for plants then hand over ownership to dairy associations tharaka nithi county governor muthomi njuki said in a phone interview
it is then the responsibility of the farmers to pay for maintenance njuki added
the tharaka nithi facility does that by deducting percent of each farmer s monthly earnings
apart from being the klpa s kimani said solar plants are cheap to maintain and can deal with the blackouts that continue to trouble kenya
the dairy industry is an important part of kenya s economy worth about percent of gdp the fao estimates with about million people directly or indirectly working in it
kimani said the country has about one million dairy farmers but just percent can connect to the national electricity grid to refrigerate their milk
some of the rest rely on one of solar cooling plants set up in counties since kimani said
with the cost of solar technology falling he added building more plants will become increasingly affordable in coming years to help kenya s dairy associations
with demand for dairy products climbing kimani said there are plans for plants in key production areas to boost their capacity to process milk into products such as yoghurt and milk powder
at the office of the kibumbu dairy farmers association manager lucy muthoni divides her day between monitoring the milk containers that farmers bring in and checking that the solar system on the plant s roof is keeping the coolers humming
the plant receives more than litres of milk a day she said with about consumed by people in nearby chuka town and the rest sent to the capital nairobi for processing
solar power and milk make for a good combination she said
milk is most likely to go bad when the day is hot
yet it is when it is hot that the solar system can absorb and store more energy to keep the coolers operating during the day and at night muthoni told the thomson reuters foundation
and she added the fact that milk can be refrigerated means more local people are turning to dairy farming
at munene njoka s farm in kanjau village in central kenya he is cutting his maize crop even though harvest time is three weeks away
the reason
the five cows in his barn
njoka chops the maize into pieces then mixes it with dry napier grass to make silage a delicacy that he said makes his cows more productive
njoka who learned the technique during a farmers field day has no concerns about feeding his entire maize crop to his cows
doing so he said brings in more money
a single cow used to give me about eight litres of milk in a day before i learned about silage the father of two said
now i can get as much as litres from a single that brings in kenyan shillings a month he said
it beats growing maize to feed his family he said because if the rains fail then the crop will wither leaving him nursing a financial loss and stuck in an cycle of hunger
after investing part of the money back to the farm buying food paying school fees and health bills i still have enough to take my family out during weekends said njoka
that echoes kamuru s experience for him keeping dairy cows generates more income than growing maize in part because maize prices are kept low by cheap imports
but milk prices are always rising due to demand from a growing urban population
this assures me of a steady income all year round he said
