u.s. shale producer magnolia eyes tripling in size
houston aug reuters oil producer magnolia oil gas corp aims to at least triple in market valuation in coming years as it develops shale acreage across eastern and southern texas chief executive steve chazen said on wednesday
magnolia s shares have rallied about percent this year alongside a rise in crude prices and as the company has focused on shareholder returns amidst rising pressure from wall street on the sector
the company formed earlier this year by private equity firm tpg capital and chazen the former occidental petroleum ceo has been amassing acreage across the eagle ford shale formation and the austin chalk limestone and clay formation
the oil industry is about money not about romance chazen said in an interview
our model is to live within cash magnolia s market valuation of billion likely could grow to between billion to billion in coming years chazen said adding that such a level would be a manageable size to oversee as ceo
chazen declined to comment on when that level could be reached but the company expects to double in size without acquisitions within five years
our end game is to build our company to a rational size and if we continue to grow and generate excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders he said
magnolia which pumps more than barrels of oil equivalent per day invests less than percent of its cash flow into drilling and other operations saving the rest for growth opportunities and other uses
the austin chalk which lies atop the eagle ford in parts of texas is undergoing a renaissance of sorts as oil producers magnolia included deploy technology developed in the shale boom
magnolia which operates more than acres added to its holdings in the area earlier this month in a million purchase of acreage from privately held harvest oil gas
production from the austin chalk jumped to barrels per day bpd last year from bpd five years ago according to consultancy wood mackenzie which expects the production gains to continue
unlike some rivals magnolia has not invested in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico the largest oilfield
chazen s former company occidental is the permian s largest oil producer but that company bought much of its acreage years ago before land prices spiked
new entrants in the permian have a position because they have to pay a lot to get there chazen said
the eagle ford and austin chalk are less popular but the acreage costs are more reporting by ernest scheyder editing by richard chang
