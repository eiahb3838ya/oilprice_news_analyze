eu antitrust regulators charge belgian, spanish ethanol producers - sources
brussels aug reuters eu antitrust regulators have charged spanish ethanol producer abengoa and belgium peer alcogroup of rigging ethanol benchmarks a move likely to result in fines for the companies next year two people familiar with the matter said on wednesday
the european commission which opened an investigation into the case in december sent statement of objections to the companies in late july the people said
these charge sheets typically set out the eu competition enforcer s concerns about behaviour
the two companies are seeking to settle the case the sources said
such a procedure allows companies to admit wrongdoing in return for a percent cut in a fine
swedish company lantmannen which was also under investigation has not yet received a charge sheet suggesting that it may not be settling the case the people said
the commission confirmed that it had sent statement of objections to the companies but declined to provide details
three years ago the commission expressed concerns that the three producers may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks
abengoa and lantmannen did not immediately respond to a request for comment
a spokeswoman for alcogroup said she was not immediately in a position to comment
