update 1-nigeria's presidency rebuffs landmark oil reform bill in current form
adds presidency comment bill sent back to lawmakers contested part covers state oil company governance bill would curb president s power to award contracts reform key to reviving investment by paul carsten abuja aug reuters nigeria s presidency rebuffed a landmark oil industry reform law because of issues with its current form the executive said on wednesday marking a setback for plans to reinvigorate investment in africa s largest crude producing nation
the presidency said it had sent the petroleum industry governance bill pigb dealing in part with the management of the nigerian national petroleum corporation back to the national assembly last month
this legislation forms a section of the broader petroleum industry bill pib
part of the presidency s disagreement with lawmakers is the fact that the bill would reduce the power of the president and oil minister to oversee and award oil licences and contracts said a person with knowledge of the matter
president muhammadu buhari is also the nigerian oil minister
the pigb was returned to parliament at the end of july partly because it allowed a regulatory body to take percent of oil revenues to the detriment of federal state and local governments said ita enang a presidency official who liaises with the legislature
provisions such as the expanded remit of an oil fund and others that created conflicts in interpretation or ambiguity were also partly the reason why the bill was not fit for presidential assent enang said in a statement
the head of the upper house of parliament s committee on upstream petroleum was not immediately available for comment
the governance bill would create four new entities whose powers would include the ability to conduct bid rounds award exploration licences and make recommendations to the oil minister on upstream licences
both houses of parliament passed the governance bill in january but it still needed the president s signature to become law
senate president bukola saraki told reuters in may that it had been transferred to the presidency but a person familiar with the matter said it was not sent until july when parliament had intended to have all the pib sections passed
parliament has so far passed only the governance section of the bill after it was broken down into sections to try to accelerate its passage
when buhari came to power in passage of the pib was seen as critical for the revival of investments into the sector according to a presidential report from the time seen by reuters
the administration s plan had been to pass the pib within days of taking power according to the report which noted that uncertainties over the fiscal terms from an unapproved pib were a key issue in nigeria s oil sector
