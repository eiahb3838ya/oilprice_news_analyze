norway cold-proofs troubled kollsnes gas plant to protect uk flows
oslo reuters norway s largest gas processing plant kollsnes a key facility for british exports which faced outages last winter is having additional upgrades this summer to protect it against extreme weather later in the year operator gassco told reuters
in late february when a cold snap dubbed the beast from the east hit europe sending energy prices to highs kollsnes had to drastically reduce output as equipment parts froze stripping britain of gas supplies
on march the second day of the plant s outage the lack of supplies in britain coinciding with high demand caused prompt gas prices in the country to quadruple with the price reaching pence per therm the highest since the liberalisation of the market in the
the winterization programme for kollsnes has also been updated extensive heating measures to ensure the best possible production availability also during winter and extreme weather conditions is an example said gassco s spokeswoman lisbet kallevik
gassco is also working on reinforcing the power grid as a part of this project added kallevik
the kollsnes plant is at the middle of its planned maintenance period at the moment and works are scheduled to continue until
even though maintenance at norway s gas processing plants happens virtually every year this summer s works are much more extensive and targeted
a lot of the equipment that was more exposed to the elements is being insulated to withstand cold
the extraordinary weather conditions that kollsnes faced in february a combination of very low temperatures that reached as low as minus degrees celsius and strong wind created a challenge engineers call a cold bridge
in the event of a cold bridge impulse lines which are small pipes used to connect larger gas pipes with measuring instruments freeze
as a result typical process systems like pressure transmitters and pressure controllers connected to impulse lines used to trace heat are disrupted
gassco is now insulating the instrumented systems and will boost heat tracing of the equipment exposed to the weather elements to reduce vulnerability and the technical risk exposure on the plant
our target is to secure full production availability at the plant at all times but still it s impossible to promise that we will not see any outages this winter kallevik said
gassco declined to disclose the cost of the additional maintenance at kollsnes
equinor kollsnes technical service provider is also evaluating its short and routines for extremely cold weather to reduce the probability and consequences of equipment failure said the firm s spokeswoman elin isaksen
