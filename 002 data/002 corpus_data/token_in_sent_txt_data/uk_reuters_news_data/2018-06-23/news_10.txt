opec meets russia and allies to agree oil output boost
opec s deal on friday gave no specific output targets iraq sees real output increase by bpd iran says saudi can not compensate for venezuela output loss trump says hopes opec will increase substantially by ahmad ghaddar and vladimir soldatkin vienna june reuters opec meets russia and other allies on saturday to clinch a new deal raising oil output a day after agreeing a production hike within the group itself but confusing the market as to how much more oil it will pump
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries announced its agreement on friday but gave no clear output targets
russia and other oil producers will now meet opec in a bid to secure their participation in the pact
benchmark brent oil rose by or percent on friday to a barrel
president donald trump was among those wondering how much more oil opec will deliver
hope opec will increase output substantially
need to keep prices down trump wrote on twitter after opec announced its decision
the united states china and india had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth
opec said in a statement that it would raise supply by returning to percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts but gave no concrete figures
saudi arabia said the move would translate into a nominal output rise of around million barrels per day bpd or percent of global supply for opec and producers
iraq said the real increase would be around bpd because several countries that had suffered production declines would struggle to reach full quotas
iran said the real increase could amount to as little as bpd
russian energy minister alexander novak said on saturday he was happy with the decision even though he had previously pushed opec and to raise output by as much as million bpd
at this stage the million is quite rational he told reporters after arriving in vienna where opec is headquartered
iran opec s producer had demanded opec reject calls from trump for an increase in oil supply arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on iran and fellow member venezuela
trump slapped fresh sanctions on tehran in may and market watchers expect iran s output to drop by a third by the end of
that means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise opec output unlike top oil exporter saudi arabia
by not setting individual targets the opec deal appeared to give saudi arabia the leeway to produce more than its previous opec quota and fill the gap left by those such as venezuela who can not pump enough to meet their official allocation
but iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said that was not the case each country which has produced less than its allocation can produce more
those which can not will this means that saudi arabia can increase its production by less than bpd qatar can produce an additional bpd zanganeh told argus media
but this does not mean that venezuela s production should be produced by some other
venezuela will raise its production when it can
and if it can not others can not come in and produce on their behalf zanganeh said
opec and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by million bpd
the measure had helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel from as low as in
but unexpected outages in venezuela libya and angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around million bpd in recent months
saudi energy minister khalid has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to million bpd in the second half of
both saudi and iran can show that they won an opec delegate said
zanganeh can go back to his country and say i won because we are keeping the original agreement unchanged
falih can go back and say we will be able to raise production to meet market needs for a factbox on the history of opec oil output changes see additional reporting by alex lawler shadia nasralla and rania el gamal writing and editing by dale hudson and dmitry zhdannikov graphics by amanda cooper
