islamic state: free sunni women or iraqi security men die
baghdad reuters islamic state militants have kidnapped six members of iraq s security forces and threatened to kill them in three days unless the government releases sunni muslim female prisoners the group said on saturday
in a video posted by the group s amaq news agency six men with visible injuries on their faces appear sitting on the floor with two masked gunmen pointing assault rifles at them standing behind
islamic state s black banner hangs in the background
iraq s military spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment
in the video the men identify themselves as members of iraq s police or the popular mobilisation forces an umbrella grouping of mostly shi ite militias that fought with government forces against islamic state and nominally report to prime minister haider
i implore the central government of haider and the anbar provincial government we are now with the islamic state and we have three days
if the demand to release sunni women from prisons is not met we will all be killed said one of the hostages
abadi declared final victory over the hardline sunni militants in december but the group still operates from pockets along the border with syria and has continued to carry out ambushes assassinations and bombings across iraq
there has been an uptick in attacks by the group in recent weeks especially on a highway connecting the capital baghdad with the country s north where amaq said the men in the video had been taken
we give the rafidi government three days to release all sunni detainees from prisons in exchange for releasing these apostates or else their fate will be that of their predecessors said one of the gunmen using a slur for shi ites regularly employed by islamic state
