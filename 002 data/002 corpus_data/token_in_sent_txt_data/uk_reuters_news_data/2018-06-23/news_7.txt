update 3-saudi pledges 'measurable' oil supply boost as opec, russia agree deal
vienna reuters opec agreed with russia and other allies on saturday to raise output from july with saudi arabia pledging a measurable supply boost but giving no specific numbers
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries had announced an production agreement on friday also without clear output targets
benchmark brent oil rose by or percent on the day to a barrel
on saturday oil producers agreed to participate in the pact but a communique issued after their talks with the group provided no concrete numbers amid deep disagreements between opec saudi arabia and iran
president donald trump was among those wondering how much more oil opec would deliver
hope opec will increase output substantially
need to keep prices down trump wrote on twitter after opec announced its friday decision
the united states china and india had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth
opec and said in their statement that they would raise supply by returning to percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts after months of underproduction
saudi energy minister khalid said opec and combined would pump roughly an extra million barrels per day bpd in coming months equal to percent of global supply
top global exporter saudi arabia will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels he said with exact figures to be decided later
we already mobilised the aramco machinery before coming to vienna this meeting falih said referring to the saudi state oil company
russian energy minister alexander novak said his country would add bpd in the second half of this year
asked to what extent the decision to increase supply had been driven by pressure from trump novak said it is obvious that we are not being driven by tweets but base our actions on deep market iran opec s producer had demanded opec reject calls from trump for an increase in oil supply arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on iran and fellow member venezuela
trump slapped fresh sanctions on tehran in may and market watchers expect iran s output to drop by a third by the end of
that means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise output unlike saudi arabia
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said the real increase could amount to as little as bpd because saudi arabia would not be allowed to pump more on behalf of venezuela where output has collapsed in recent months
each country which has produced less than its allocation can produce more
those which can not will not
this means that saudi arabia can increase its production by less than bpd zanganeh told argus media
but falih said quota reallocations did not have to be strict meaning saudi wanted to fill the gaps left by others
some of the countries are not going to be able to produce so the others will
and that implies there will be indirectly a reallocation falih said
he also said opec could hold an extraordinary meeting before its next formal talks due on or adjust deliveries in september when its monitoring committee meets if global oil supply fell further because of sanctions on iran
opec and its allies have since last year been participating in a pact to cut output by million bpd
the measure had helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to around per barrel from as low as in
but unexpected outages in venezuela libya and angola have effectively brought supply cuts to around million bpd in recent months
falih has warned the world could face a supply deficit of up to million bpd in the second half of

zanganeh can go back to his country and say i won because we are keeping the original agreement unchanged
