interview-iran sees little extra oil if opec, partners stick to deal
vienna reuters iran said on saturday the world will see little extra oil reaching the market if opec and its partners adhere properly to a supply pact underlining a disagreement with top exporter saudi arabia
opec and a group of countries agreed on saturday that they would return to percent compliance with previously agreed oil output cuts after months of underproduction by opec countries including venezuela and angola
saudi energy minister khalid said this implied an indirect reallocation of extra production from countries unable to produce more oil to those such as his own and the other gulf opec members that are able to do so
but iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters that no reallocation was agreed at saturday s joint opec and meeting or the talks a day earlier
there is no such thing kazempour said
some people may do but they are in breach of the the comments underline that disagreement between iran and saudi arabia longtime rivals in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries persists despite extensive talks in vienna this week aimed at resolving differences
venezuela has been pumping more than barrels per day below its opec target because of natural declines in its oil output but in iran s view other countries should not step in to cover the shortfall
they can not go and say venezuela has bpd on the table and there is no cat to eat this meat i m the cat and i will jump on it kazempour said
if countries stick to their allocations output would rise by bpd in the first three months and up to bpd by the end of the year he said less than the million bpd mentioned by falih and some other ministers
this will come up naturally some is additional barrels some is restraint barrels because nobody can turn up tomorrow kazempour said
iran had demanded opec reject calls from president donald trump for an increase in oil supply arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on iran and venezuela
according to kazempour venezuela had said its output would partially recover in the next three to four months another reason why other producers should not step in to compensate
venezuela told us that bpd will come back he said
