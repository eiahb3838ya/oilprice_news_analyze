sabah no longer a 'fixed deposit' in election for malaysia's najib, says party rebel
kota kinabalu malaysia reuters malaysian prime minister najib razak can no longer count on the state of sabah on the island of borneo as a fixed deposit for his ruling coalition a senior defector said just days before the country goes to the polls
najib has called sabah along with neighbouring sarawak fixed deposits for consistently voting for his barisan nasional bn coalition thereby allowing the party to retain power for decades despite losing votes in peninsular malaysia
but an opposition groundswell in sabah famed for its rain forests beaches wildlife and mountains including the country s highest peak mount kinabalu threatens to upend expectations of a repeat performance
najib is still expected to win wednesday s election aided by recently redrawn electoral boundaries that the opposition and critics say favour his ruling pact and squabbling between the pakatan harapan coalition led by his former mentor mahathir mohamad and a national islamist party
the election commission and the government have both said the new boundaries are free from political interference
shafie apdal who leads the opposition push in sabah said anger is palpable among sabah people who he says have long suffered from poor public infrastructure porous border security and the lack of job opportunities despite supporting the ruling coalition for more than years
it s shameful for sabahans to be considered a fixed deposit when interest is not given back shafie told reuters in an interview at his home in the state capital of kota kinabalu
people are no longer there are few independent polls that measure voter sentiment in malaysia but analysts have mixed views on whether shafie s new parti warisan sabah can dent bn s hold on the state and shift the power balance in parliament
bn has said it is confident of retaining power in sabah
najib says the state now has better infrastructure and that the government has tackled issues like illegal immigration from the neighbouring philippines and indonesia
najib s coalition faces arguably its toughest election since malaysia gained independence from britain in as former prime minister mahathir mounts an unprecedented challenge at the helm of a resurgent federal opposition pact
the prime minister is also grappling with popular anger over rising living costs and allegations of graft as he seeks to better bn s performance in the polls when it lost the popular vote
shafie who quit najib s united malay national organisation umno party over the prime minister s handling of the graft scandal at development berhad said he had to speak out against his old friend for years on a point of principle
najib denies any wrongdoing
i m not a political prostitute that you can dump money in my mouth in my ears
i was his buddy now i m fighting against him shafie said
since campaigning officially kicked off on april najib has faced growing criticism from former friends and umno veterans
on saturday his party sacked two senior leaders and suspended another all loyalists of mahathir for speaking against najib and attending opposition events
at a campaign stop in kimanis a largely agricultural district southwest of the state capital shafie told a crowd of about supporters that change will only come if people roundly reject bn in both the general election and the state polls run concurrently
the power is in your hands
this is not for shafie apdal
it is not for any other leaders
we do this for the people and future of sabah he said surrounded by dozens of white flags bearing the party logo of a ship encircled by two clasped hands
bn currently holds of the parliamentary seats
shafie is promising higher petroleum royalties and greater state autonomy which are demands of sabah people
sabah separated from the peninsula by the south china sea accounts for nearly a quarter of the country s vast oil resources
the time has come to change sabah shafie said to cheers from the crowd
