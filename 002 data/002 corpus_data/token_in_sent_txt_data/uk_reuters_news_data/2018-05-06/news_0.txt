fraud-hit indian lender pnb targets over 10 pct business growth in 2018/19
new delhi may reuters indian lender punjab national bank pnb said on sunday it aimed to expand its total business percent to trillion rupees billion in the year to march and outlined steps to prevent more such frauds
the bank in february disclosed that two jewellery groups had defrauded it of more than billion by raising credit from overseas branches of other indian banks using illegal guarantees issued by rogue pnb staff at a mumbai branch over several years
while investigation continues into what has been called the biggest fraud in india s banking history pnb said after a board meeting that it had strengthened the process of underwriting credit to minimise the possibility of fraud
the new bank will split the process of credit underwriting into four divisions with different employees focused on sourcing appraisal process and underwriting documentation and disbursement and recovery it said in a statement
the bank will also rely more on an monitoring mechanism and reduce its dependence on physical inspection and audit to identify risks it added
pnb has constituted a specialised management vertical for early identification of bad loans the bank said
india s banks already burdened by a mountain as of last year are staring at a further rise in bad loans after the central bank tightened rules earlier this year
