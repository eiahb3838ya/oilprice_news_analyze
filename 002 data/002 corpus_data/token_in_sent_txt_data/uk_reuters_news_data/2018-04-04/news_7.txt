update 2-norway's dno raises faroe petroleum stake to 25.4 pct
oslo reuters norwegian oil firm dno increased its stake in faroe petroleum to percent on wednesday after announcing earlier in the day that it had bought a percent holding in the british company
dno bought the initial stake from israel s delek group and said after the market close that it would offer to buy up to percent of faroe s shares from other shareholders although it does not plan a full takeover
britain s takeover code dictates that a firm publishing a no intention to bid statement must refrain for at least six months from crossing the percent ownership threshold at which an obligation to make a mandatory offer is triggered
the norwegian firm returned to the north sea last year after years of expansion in the middle east with the aim of growing via acquisitions and other investment
dno now has decided to build a strategic shareholding in faroe petroleum and to support faroe petroleum management s north sea strategy it said
faroe earlier in the day announced it had made significant discoveries in its hades and iris exploration prospects offshore norway
a source close to faroe said the company expected dno to seek to appoint at least one new member to the faroe board
the norwegian firm was not immediately available for comment
faroe s shares closed percent higher at pounds on wednesday having hit a high of pounds during trading hours
to buy the percent stake dno paid a percent premium to the shares closing price on tuesday
the faroe board considers that the gbp per share price at which dno purchased the faroe shares from delek substantially undervalues the company and its prospects faroe said in an earlier statement
following dno s share purchase and the north sea discoveries investment bank bmo capital markets raised its share price target for faroe to pounds from pounds and repeated an outperform recommendation
dno shares closed down percent
