update 1-china importers hope to sell u.s. cargoes to north asia after tariff move
beijing reuters chinese importers expecting cargoes of commodities from beef to propane said they hope to sell the goods to south korea or japan after beijing s decision to slap extra tariffs on a swathe of items from agricultural products to chemicals
beijing on wednesday hit back against the trump administration s plans to impose tariffs on billion in chinese goods retaliating with a list of similar duties on key imports including soybeans planes cars whiskey and chemicals
the speed of china s move stunned financial markets
traders of soybeans of which china is the largest importer said they were bracing for mass cancellations of purchases even though the united states is the country s supplier
prices of soybeans shipped from ports in the pacific northwest the most direct route to asia dropped by to per ton on wednesday soybean traders said
buyers of propane used for making ethylene and propylene are looking to swap shipments for middle eastern barrels with buyers in south korea and japan
even though we are committed to supplies we could swap them for middle east cargoes with korean or japanese buyers by paying them per ton extra freight cost said a manager with an east chemical plant that buys propane and who gave only his surname zhong
china bought million tonnes of propane last year worth some billion or percent of its total imports
the additional tariffs will likely hit exporters such as enterprise product partners and phillips and give a boost to rivals in the middle east like qatar and saudi arabia
the market will be thrown into some initial chaos and the freight market will also be affected
diversions and swaps mean the demand for tankers will be lower as voyages are shorter to northeast asia and also shorter from the middle east to china said a senior dealer with jovo energy
the tariffs on beef were not expected to have much impact on the chinese market which had only resumed imports from the last year after a hiatus
china bought just tonnes of beef in worth million according to chinese customs less than percent of total imports
but the move could increase supplies of coveted items like short ribs to other asian countries like japan and south korea pressuring prices currently at record levels said one expert who declined to be named
