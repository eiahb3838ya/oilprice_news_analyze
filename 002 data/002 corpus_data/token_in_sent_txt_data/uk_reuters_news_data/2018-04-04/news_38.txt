rights groups pressure macron ahead of saudi prince visit to france
paris reuters ten rights groups urged french president emmanuel macron on wednesday to use a visit by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman to press him to end a blockade of yemeni ports and work for a diplomatic solution to the conflict there
pressure is mounting on macron to scale back military support for saudi arabia and the united arab emirates which are leading the coalition fighting the houthi group that controls most of northern yemen and the capital sanaa
the conflict has killed more than people and displaced more than three million
with prince mohammed arriving in france on sunday for a visit lawmakers and rights groups want macron to suspend weapons sales to the two countries which are among its biggest purchasers
the bombing of civilians in yemen must stop and we call on all sides in the conflict to stop them immediately anne hery of handicap international said
ahead of the visit of crown prince mohammed president macron has a choice protect civilians or sell some european countries notably germany have curtailed ties with the military coalition
but france britain and the united states have not followed suit
however paris has grown increasingly concerned by a worsening humanitarian situation and in december macron called for a complete lifting of a saudi blockade on yemen
the alliance which includes other sunni muslim states has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting houthi fighters and has often hit civilian areas although it denies ever doing so intentionally
france has to have a larger discussion not just about the sale of arms but the blockade of this country
that strategy hasn t worked jonathan cunliffe director of middle east operations for action against hunger told reporters
prince mohammed s visit comes at a delicate moment in relations
francois hollande nurtured closer ties with gulf arab states in particular saudi arabia as paris took a tough stance on iran during nuclear negotiations
hollande awarded former crown prince mohammed bin nayef france s highest honour the legion d honneur in
however the new crown prince has in past months emphasised closer ties with president donald trump just as macron has sought to improve relations with iran saudi arabia s shi ite rival for regional influence
prince salman deserves neither the legion d honneur nor the red carpet he deserves sanctions said benedicte jeannerod director of human rights watch in france
