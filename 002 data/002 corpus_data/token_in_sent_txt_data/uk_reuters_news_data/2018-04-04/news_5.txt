wider image-brazil jaguars find safe haven from floods in rainforest trees
uarini brazil reuters brazilian jaguars imperiled by hunters ranchers and destruction of their habitat have learned to survive at least one menace flooding in the amazon
they take to the trees
although they can be six feet long and pounds the largest south american cats nimbly navigate treetops where they stay from april to july when the rainforest floor is under water
it shows that even as a large animal the jaguar can withstand the flooding feeding breeding and raising its young in the treetops for three to four months says emiliano ramalho the lead researcher for project iauarete which is administered by the instituto mamirauá
this had never been documented before we began researching the jaguars the iauaretê project monitors jaguars in mamirauá studies their relationship with local residents and undertakes conservation for the species which lives deep in the rainforest
documenting jaguar behaviour during the rainy season is rare with their stays in the treetops first recorded by the researchers in after nine years of monitoring in the region
but from to in several visits to the mamirauá sustainable development reserve kilometres miles west of amazonas state capital manaus we photographed jaguars perched high on branches
called painted jaguars in brazil because of their intricately spotted fur jaguars are difficult to see in the dense jungle canopy
researchers discovered their behaviour after nearly a decade of studying them from floating bases braving the same conditions that put flood waters at the doorsteps of more than people living in the mamirauá reserve
on one expedition last month researchers with headlamps tracked down and tranquilized a black male jaguar at night placed his limp body on a blue tarp and wrapped his head in a towel as they fitted him with a black tracking collar measured his teeth and checked his vitals
so many jaguars have been fitted with trackers that researchers can now pinpoint them by holding up pronged radio receivers as they pilot small boats through the flooded forest
ramalho says that understanding this behaviour is further evidence supporting the need to preserve the amazon floodplain
the iauaretê project has teamed up with the uakari lodge in the reserve which is operated by an association of local residents to offer ecotourism trips that take advantage of the trackers to allow tourists to catch a glimpse of the animals
the goal is to raise awareness for conservation and generate income for residents
a trip to see jaguars living in trees costs reais per person
ecotourism fosters better relations between jaguars and residents who are sometimes fearful or angry because jaguars can eat livestock and pets
local resident railgler dos santos a field assistant on the project says seeing the intense black eyes of a jaguar staring out from the jungle has stayed with him
there s definitely a connection there having the fortune of seeing the animal face to face he said
