the march total is the lowest since april according to reuters surveys
opec is reducing output by about million bpd as part of a deal with russia and other producers to get rid of excess supply
the pact started in january and runs until the end of
adherence by producers in the deal rose to percent of agreed cuts from percent in february the survey found
there was no sign that other producers had boosted output to cash in on higher prices or to compensate for the venezuelan decline
oil has topped a barrel this year for the first time since and was trading above on wednesday
still opec says supply restraints should be maintained to ensure the end of a glut that had built up since
in march the biggest decrease in supply came from angola which exported cargoes two fewer than in the same month of
natural declines at some fields are weighing on output
production in libya which remains unstable due to unrest slipped because of stoppages at two fields el feel and el sharara setting back s partial recovery in output

output climbed in qatar after a dip in february that sources attributed to maintenance
nigeria also pumped at a higher level extending a run of more stable supply from africa s top exporter
nigeria and libya were originally exempt from cutting supply because their output had been curbed by conflict and unrest
for both told opec that output would not exceed levels
opec has an implied production target for of million bpd based on cutbacks detailed in late and taking into account changes of membership since plus nigeria and libya s expectations of output
according to the survey opec pumped about bpd below this implied target in march not least because of the involuntary decline in venezuela
