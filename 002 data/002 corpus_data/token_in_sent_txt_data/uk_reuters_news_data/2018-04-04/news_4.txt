wrapup 11-u.s. expects talks with china as trade fight escalates
reuters the united states voiced willingness on wednesday to negotiate a resolution to an escalating trade fight with china after beijing retaliated against proposed tariffs on billion in chinese goods by targeting key american imports but the chinese ambassador to washington said it takes two to just hours after president donald trump s administration proposed percent tariffs on some chinese industrial technology transport and medical products china shot back with a list of similar duties on major american imports including soybeans planes cars beef and chemicals
beijing s swift and forceful response raised the prospect of a quickly spiralling dispute between the world s two economic superpowers that could harm the global economy
while trump posted defiant messages on twitter his administration signalled possible wiggle room
asked whether the tariffs announced on tuesday may never go into effect and may be a negotiating tactic trump s top economic adviser larry kudlow told reporters yes it s possible
it s part of the he called the announcements by the two countries mere opening proposals
kudlow later told fox news channel i don t think it s a trade war
i think there is going to be intense negotiations on both i think we re going to come to agreements he said adding that i believe that the chinese will back down and will play cui tiankai china s ambassador to the united states held an meeting at the state department in washington with acting secretary of state john sullivan
negotiation would still be our preference but it takes two to tango
we will see what the will do the ambassador said afterward
the trade actions will not be carried out immediately so there may be room for manoeuvre
publication of washington s list on tuesday started a period of public comment and consultation expected to last around two months
the effective date of china s moves depends on when the action takes effect
if the two countries are unable to settle the dispute a trade war could destabilise commercial ties an important component of the global economy
china s action rattled farmers while shares in exporters of everything from planes to tractors were volatile
after dropping at the outset of trading wall street s three major indexes staged a comeback to close about percent higher as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from the trade fight
white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said implementation of the tariffs would depend on china s behaviour
it s going to be a couple months before tariffs on either side would go into effect and be implemented and we re hopeful that china will do the right thing she told reporters
i would anticipate that if there are no changes to the behaviour of china and they don t stop the unfair trade practices then we would move forward sanders said
trump who contends his predecessors served the united states badly in trade matters wrote on twitter we are not in a trade war with china that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the while washington targeted products that benefit from chinese industrial policy including its made in china initiative to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products in strategic industries such as advanced it and robotics beijing appeared to offer a response intended to inflict political damage
washington s list was filled with many obscure industrial items but china s struck at signature exports including soybeans frozen beef cotton and other agricultural commodities produced in states from iowa to texas that voted for trump in the presidential election
the list extends to tobacco and whiskey both produced in states including kentucky home of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell like trump a republican
trump said last month that trade wars are good and easy to win but key fellow republicans expressed unease over the latest developments
mcconnell said he was nervous about the growing trend in the administration to levy tariffs that could become a slippery slope while senator chuck grassley whose home state of iowa is a major agricultural producer said farmers and ranchers shouldn t be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire the possibility of an escalating trade war will result in a bumpy ride for the economy said james bullard president of the federal reserve bank of louis
china said its list of percent additional tariffs on goods covered items with a trade value matching the billion targeted on washington s list
goods that appear to face added tariffs in china include tesla inc electric cars ford motor co s lincoln auto models gulfstream jets made by general dynamics corp and corp s jack daniel s whiskey
information technology products from cellphones to personal computers largely escaped the latest salvo of trade measures despite accounting for a significant portion of bilateral trade
china ran a billion goods trade surplus with the united states in
trump has demanded that the china cut the trade gap by billion
the move was aimed at forcing beijing to address what washington says is deeply entrenched theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer from companies to chinese competitors charges chinese officials deny
the tariff list followed china s imposition of tariffs on billion worth of fruits nuts pork and wine to protest steel and aluminium tariffs imposed last month by trump
