tullow oil deals signed by disgraced peru ex-president under fire
lima reuters pedro pablo kuczynski s critics call it his last act
hours before the former wall street banker resigned peru s presidency in scandal last month kuczynski signed five oil contracts granting tullow oil exploration and drilling rights off peru s northern coast
lawmakers have vowed to investigate and try to repeal the contracts
they say there should have been a public auction an environmental study and consultations with fishermen biologists and coastal residents about sites that lie in an important fisheries area rich in biodiversity
critics are unconvinced by peru s oil promoting agency perupetro which said the contracts followed months of negotiations and should be celebrated for the million investment they will bring to a country where bidding rounds are often cancelled due to lack of interest
it s not normal for a president just before resigning to sign five decrees giving away our resources said congresswoman karla schaefer with the conservative party popular force
given kuczynski s background it raises a lot of kuczynski s less than two years in office featured clashes with popular force lawmakers who depicted him as an unscrupulous lobbyist
he resigned after being implicated in an alleged scheme to prevent possible impeachment over payments his consulting firm received from odebrecht a company at the centre of a massive graft scandal
kuczynski denies wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate with public prosecutors investigating him
kuczynski s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment about tullow oil
the company has been cautiously reviving its search for new oil and gas resources after emerging from one of the longest downturns in the sector s history with a billion debt pile
for foreign investors in one of latin america s most stable economies the latest controversy brought reminders of a how a more than yearlong graft scandal involving odebrecht has heightened scrutiny of government contracts and fuelled political feuds in peru
tullow said it started direct negotiations with perupetro as allowed by peruvian law in november
both the terms and conditions of our contracts and the process for approving them are similar to those signed with other oil companies in it said in a statement
but leftist lawmaker hernando cevallos said peru s new president martin vizcarra should rescind the contracts
this area is the source of percent of our fishing cevallos said
vizcarra s office declined to comment
yuri hooker a marine biologist who researches undersea life in peru said three of tullow s oil concessions contain high levels of biodiversity
this whole area is one of the most important breeding places in the pacific for whales and dolphins as well as fish and invertebrate species on the verge of extinction said hooker
the former head of perupetro francisco garcia said tullow will have to secure environmental approvals before drilling and denied anything irregular about the contracts
a minor oil producer peru has struggled to lure investments to its prospects as bigger players in the region such as mexico have grown more competitive by cutting red tape
now all we re doing is driving companies away garcia said adding that he resigned last month because most of his time was spent responding to lawmakers
