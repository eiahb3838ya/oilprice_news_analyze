update 1-developing nations to study ways to dim sunshine, slow warming
oslo reuters scientists in developing nations plan to step up research into dimming sunshine to curb climate change hoping to judge if a chemical sunshade would be less risky than a harmful rise in global temperatures
research into solar which would mimic big volcanic eruptions that can cool the earth by masking the sun with a veil of ash is now dominated by rich nations and universities such as harvard and oxford
twelve scholars from countries including bangladesh brazil china ethiopia india jamaica and thailand wrote in the journal nature on wednesday that the poor were most vulnerable to global warming and should be more involved
developing countries must lead on solar research they wrote in a commentary
the overall idea of solar is pretty crazy but it is gradually taking root in the world of research lead author atiq rahman head of the bangladesh centre for advanced studies told reuters by telephone
the solar studies may be helped by a new research project the solar radiation management governance initiative srmgi which is issuing a first call for scientists to apply for finance this week
the srmgi is financed by the open philanthropy project a foundation backed by dustin moskovitz a of facebook and his wife cari tuna the scientists wrote
the fund could help scientists in developing nations study regional impacts of solar such as on droughts floods or monsoons said andy parker a and project director of the srmgi
rahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether would work
among proposed ideas planes might spray clouds of reflective sulfur particles high in the earth s atmosphere
the technique is controversial and rightly so
it is too early to know what its effects would be it could be very helpful or very harmful they wrote
a panel of climate experts in a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in october is skeptical about solar saying it may be economically socially and institutionally among risks the draft obtained by reuters says it might disrupt weather patterns could be hard to stop once started and might discourage countries from making a promised switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energies
still rahman said most developed nations had abysmally failed so far in their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions making radical options to limit warming more attractive
the world is set for a warming of three degrees celsius fahrenheit or more above times he said far above a goal of keeping a rise in temperatures well below under the paris agreement among almost nations
