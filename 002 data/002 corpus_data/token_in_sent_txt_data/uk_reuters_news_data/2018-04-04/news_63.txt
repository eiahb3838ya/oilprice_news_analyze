analysis-oil giants stay in their own backyards in u.s. auction
new york reuters the trump administration heralded the government s sale last month of drilling leases in the gulf of mexico as a bellwether
if that is the case a reuters analysis of the sale s results shows reason to worry about demand in future offshore auctions
the sale brought in million as just percent of the million acres million hectares offered found bidders
reuters examined the acreage offered and leased and nearly all the purchases show big drillers stuck closest to existing infrastructure shunning the most areas
while crude oil production reached a record last year at more than million barrels a day most new development is in onshore shale regions
the
interior department has said it wants to open all coasts for drilling including the atlantic and pacific
but the gulf result indicates limited interest even in areas never mind unexplored coasts
the march auction included deepwater blocks each comprising roughly nine square miles
only of these blocks received bids and all but three of these were close to existing infrastructure and leases
it kind of looks like they re just shoring up their existing prospects right now said john filostrat a spokesman for the bureau of ocean energy management the division of interior that manages the auctions
filostrat said the administration is still optimistic about future auctions and believes more auctions are needed to show the current trends
for a graphic on gulf of mexico auction click here however money for exploration is increasingly flocking to other regions particularly latin america where energy reforms have attracted billions of dollars in investment from companies historically known as gulf heavyweights
a january auction by mexico brought in more than four times the bids as the sale
of the new leases in water depths of more than feet meters were immediately contiguous with existing leased acreage or production platforms and another were within about two miles of existing leases or infrastructure according to the reuters analysis
among the areas where companies submitted bids were mississippi canyon and green canyon two of the most densely leased plays in the gulf about miles km off the louisiana coast
royal dutch shell plc was the high bidder on two mississippi canyon blocks
overall shell picked up gulf blocks including adjacent to its deepwater developments known as kakias and stones and clustered around other actively leased areas
it told reuters that it wanted to acquire blocks that could potentially support future development using our existing bp plc s most notable bids were blocks in desoto canyon contiguous to a known gas field about miles from the louisiana coast
bp is strategic with its bids and we use the opportunity to expand and strengthen our plays a company spokesman told reuters
only three blocks leased were more than a few miles from existing acreage
those blocks were snapped up by chevron which declined comment
bidding on parcels close to known assets increases the likelihood of finds that can be produced affordably cutting infrastructure and supply costs
there s still interest but it is in areas where there was already existing knowledge of the resource base or existing development activity or existing production said michael cohen director of commodity research at barclays
spending a lot of money to prospect is probably not going to be looked upon with favor by investors he said
major oil companies remain lukewarm about pushing the boundaries of available frontiers desiring longer leases and lower royalty rates
deepwater offshore blocks currently require an percent payment to the government compared with percent for shallower areas and onshore drilling
an interior department panel in february recommended lowering those rates
it is something to look for in the august sale possibly said boem s filostrat
companies have also expressed a desire for longer leases to more effectively drill in unexplored areas further from the coasts
six deepwater regions more than miles off the louisiana coast received no bids at all
the water here is generally about two miles deep
the locale makes both drilling and transporting oil to shore especially costly
the high cost of building underwater pipelines is another deterrent
deepwater projects like chevron s jack and malo fields more than miles from the coast required a pipeline connecting them to existing gulf infrastructure closer to shore approved in during a boom when crude traded at about a barrel
oil prices have rebounded from s lows at less than a barrel but the industry is still in a bit of a wait and see mode said william turner a senior research analyst in houston for wood mackenzie
