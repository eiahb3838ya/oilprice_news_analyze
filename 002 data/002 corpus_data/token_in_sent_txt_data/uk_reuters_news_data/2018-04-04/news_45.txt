palestinians, seeking new developer, offer 45 pct stake in gaza gas field
new development structure for field after shell pulls out political tensions have delayed offshore project palestinians hope to become energy exporter by nidal gaza april reuters the palestinians are seeking to sell a percent stake in a gas field off gaza to help to develop the project its main stakeholder the palestine investment fund said on wednesday after royal dutch shell announced it had pulled out
gaza marine about km miles off the gaza coast has long been seen as an opportunity for the palestinian authority to join the mediterranean gas bonanza providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid
but palestinian political disputes and conflict with israel as well as economic factors have delayed plans to develop the field and shell had struggled to find a buyer for its percent stake in the field which it took over as part of its acquisition of bg group in
shell said on wednesday it had reached an agreement with the palestine investment fund pif to divest its interest in gaza marine
the pif a sovereign wealth fund said that under a new structure agreed with the palestinian authority the pif and its investment partner cc oil and gas ltd would each hold percent of development rights and a future foreign operator would have percent
the pif said the new structure would give momentum to one of palestine s most vital strategic assets fuel power plants in gaza and the city of jenin in the west bank and enable the palestinians to become an energy exporter
gaza marine is estimated to hold over trillion cubic feet of natural gas the equivalent of spain s consumption in
but plans to develop it were put off several times over the past decade
discovered at the end of the century it lies between two rapidly expanding gas hubs in egypt and israel both of which have attracted huge investments in recent years
attempts to develop the field were put on hold repeatedly after hamas which western countries and israel have designated as a terrorist group took control over the gaza strip in
israel then put an economic blockade on gaza raising questions about the financing of the project and the sharing of future profits among the palestinians
israel has however said in the past it supports the field s development
