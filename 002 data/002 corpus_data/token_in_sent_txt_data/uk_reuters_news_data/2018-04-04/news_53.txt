graphic china bri initiative by clyde russell hong kong april reuters china s belt and road initiative bri is one of those rare things that virtually everybody seems to have heard about but equally very few people can actually claim to have a detailed understanding of what it means
this dichotomy was in evidence at the belt and road conference hosted by mines and money in hong kong on tuesday with views ranging from the bri will be the driver of a new for commodities to that it s more of a marketing slogan aimed at boosting the image and influence of the government in beijing
on the side of thinking of the bri as a sort of a marshall plan for asia africa and even europe are a set of impressive sounding numbers which dwarf the scale of the initiative that helped to rebuild europe after world war ii
the heart of the bri is effectively building vast numbers of infrastructure and energy projects across at least countries that are home to a total of percent of the world s population and some percent of its economic output
the centrepiece of chinese president xi jinping s economic programme also involves developing the mines and oil and gas fields necessary to supply the raw materials for this vast undertaking
for its supporters the bri is the vehicle by which less developed countries will supercharge their growth and lift their populations out of poverty
asian countries need to spend trillion annually on infrastructure in the coming years more than double the current investment rate rani jarkas chairman of the advisory firm cedrus group told the hong kong event
it s these sort of numbers that are getting commodity investors and producers excited as that level of spending will require huge amounts of iron ore for steel coal for making cement and metals such as copper and zinc
but just as the big picture sounds very encouraging scratching below the rhetoric reveals that the bri may not be quite as big a deal as many expect
one of the questions i have posed at several conferences and events where the bri is a focus is to ask the audience to think of their top five bri projects what they know about them and how much they will add to commodity demand
this causes most people to stumble and bear in mind that the attendees at these events are drawn from the resource sector either as producers traders buyers or financiers
what becomes apparent is that the bri is currently more of a political initiative that china is using as a diplomatic tool to expand its influence especially in central south and southeast asia as well as africa
there doesn t appear to be a coordinated strategy for building the land transport corridors linking china to europe through asia or for the maritime projects that take in africa as well
what emerges is that chinese companies both the large enterprises soes and smaller companies are using the bri initiative as a vehicle when seeking investment opportunities
these opportunities still seem more focused on meeting the needs of the chinese companies rather than as part of a effort to develop the bri target countries
the flagship vehicle of the bri the asian infrastructure and investment bank aiib started operations from its beijing headquarters at the start of so it s somewhat unrealistic to expect it to already be a major factor driving bri investment
it has approved billion in loans so far according to data on its website and although that s somewhat more than small change it s also a far cry from the trillions of dollars in investment that those backers of the bri say will be delivered
it also appears the case that virtually any chinese foreign investment with the exception of property is being classified as related to the bri
this helps make it look like the bri is something significant rather than a collection of unrelated projects being undertaken by separate companies with little or no coordination
however just because the bri seems somewhat haphazard right now doesn t mean it will remain that way
it may be the great project of this century it may be nothing
but you have to be involved no matter what is how one investor put it at the conference
for commodity producers the takeaway is that the chinese are increasingly interested in developing resources that they believe will meet domestic needs and those of the bri
these include battery metals such as cobalt lithium and nickel but also copper and iron ore
the answer to whether the bri is indeed the start of a new for commodities will become apparent if beijing can successfully change the process from a slogan to a coordinated multilateral initiative that produces actual results
