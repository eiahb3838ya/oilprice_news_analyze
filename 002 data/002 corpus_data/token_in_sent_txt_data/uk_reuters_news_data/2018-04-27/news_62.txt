china the world s top steel producer has ordered a host of cities to crack down on heavy industry as part of its war on smog which has become a social issue amid concerns about damage to people s health
a sales manager at liguo zhenbei steel co which operates one of the closed mills said local authorities had ordered all steel plants in the city to shut until they meet the latest tough requirements aimed at cleaning its notoriously toxic air
mills no matter big or small have all stopped operations he said declining to give his name as he is not authorized to talk to media
the city s environmental bureau declined to comment
xuzhou dongnan steel industrial co ltd one of the city s biggest steel mills by production capacity is temporarily closed for maintenance an official told reuters by phone
the official did not say how long the plant would be shut
earlier this month the city launched six months of environmental inspections at industrial plants and construction sites as part of its action plan to clean its skies
at the beginning i thought my mill would be exempt from the closure list since our mill emits less harmful substances said a deputy general manager at an furnace eaf in the city
he said his family name was wang but declined to give his first name
he did not want the company he works for to be identified
eafs or use scrap steel and emit far less carbon than blast furnaces which have to go through the polluting sintering process to make hot metal
however wang s mill last week was also ordered to close until it can pass a test conducted by a environmental detection agency
that is unlikely to happen before the end of may he said
xuzhou is a hub of million tonnes of steelmaking capacity in the eastern province of jiangsu china s steel producing province after hebei
