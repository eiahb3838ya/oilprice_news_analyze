india aims to split gail within a year to open up gas sector
head of gas regulator says gail to be split by march pipelines to be made available to smaller proposals to allow to buy store fuel at lng terminals by promit mukherjee and nidhi verma delhi april reuters india plans to split gas utility gail by march next year to create two companies one marketing gas and another operating pipelines that can be used by consumers who buy direct from producers the head of the sector s regulator told reuters
gail india ltd is the country s biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the nation s pipelines giving it a stranglehold on the market for the fuel
by splitting gail the regulator of india s oil and gas sector hopes to increase the number of gas consumers and attract the billions of dollars needed to expand the pipeline network and build more liquefied natural gas lng terminals
all this should be done within this fiscal year to march
sarraf chairman of india s petroleum and natural gas board told reuters
gail already keeps separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses making it easier to split them into two entities before a change of ownership he said
sarraf did not say which business gail would retain
india s oil minister dharmendra pradhan in january said the company should focus on laying pipelines suggesting it is the marketing side that would be hived off
by unbundling gail and opening the sector the government hopes to increase gas use and meet its objective of raising the share of a cleaner cheaper fuel as a part of the energy mix to percent from percent in the next years
many power plants and small industries like ceramic glass and cement makers rely heavily on more expensive or dirtier fuels such as naphtha diesel and coal
in future though even small companies will be able to buy gas via pipelines without having to go through gail
only a handful of companies including petronet lng ltd indian oil corp ltd and gujarat state petroleum corp currently import and sell gas in india
the gas regulator hopes by july however to draft norms for allowing to bid for using lng terminals to import gas
we are planning to put lng terminals on public access to the extent of percent sarraf said
the regulator was also looking at how to open access to the pipeline network for smaller buyers
india s gas demand is constrained by low domestic output a small number of lng terminals just four and a pipeline network that does not reach enough customers
gail owns more than of india s existing km miles of pipelines but the government wants to more than double the network to expand gas deliveries
while the new pipeline company created by the division of gail would be expected to lead the way the government also wants other companies to bid for rights to build and operate pipelines
three lng import facilities are also under construction and there are proposals for many more
domestic gas production is also expected to rise
sarraf estimated an investment of nearly billion would be needed over the next several years for laying pipelines
only the western state of gujarat has an extensive city gas distribution network though some other major cities including new delhi and mumbai have been hooked up to gas
