exclusive-venezuela faces heavy bill as grace period lapses on china loans -sources
caracas reuters a grace period on chinese loans to venezuela has lapsed according to two venezuelan sources with knowledge of the matter potentially depriving the opec nation of billions of dollars in desperately needed oil revenue this year
china eased the payment terms two years ago on some billion billion pounds in deals under which venezuela sends shipments of crude oil and fuel to pay off debt allowing venezuela to make payments
the favorable conditions from beijing helped president nicolas maduro s socialist government weather a collapse in venezuela s economy which slid into hyperinflation and a painful recession following a downturn in oil prices
but the grace period has lapsed without a renewal in recent weeks according to the sources who have been briefed by chinese and venezuelan officials
that could deprive venezuela of some billion in annual revenue according to a reuters estimate based on current oil prices a crippling blow to a country already struggling to import basic goods like food and medicine
the sources who asked not to be identified said that venezuela continues to press for an extension but is responsible for making the full payments while the talks continue
the sharply increased payments would absorb roughly an additional barrels per day bpd of venezuela s oil production which has fallen to a low this year
state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa s pdvsa deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge percent in a year to million bpd in march according to official data reported to opec
china maintains its position of not increasing its exposure to venezuela and is adjusting conditions given that the price of oil is now per barrel above its level when the grace period was created said one of the sources
neither venezuela s information ministry nor state oil company pdvsa responded to requests for comment
china development bank which has underwritten most of the loans to venezuela did not respond to a request for comment
china s foreign ministry asked about the negotiations said that cooperation was proceeding smoothly and the loan contracts were in accord with international standards
caracas could seek to preserve cash flow by sending those barrels to other clients who pay cash defaulting on its obligations to china in the process and straining ties with a crucial political ally and its largest financier
beijing would have little incentive to pursue an embarrassing commercial dispute with a government it supported for years and may simply turn a blind eye to a default
maduro who is up for on may says his country is victim of an economic war led by his political adversaries with the help of washington
his critics say the country s plight is the result of a dysfunctional economic model
china for a decade courted the government of hugo chavez with generous financing arrangements as it sought to secure oil supplies for its economy and cultivate an ally in latin america
it extended more than billion in credit to venezuela over years
however beijing stopped renewing loans three years ago as venezuela s economy began spiraling downward as a result of the crash of oil prices
last year venezuela shipped some bpd of crude and fuel to china through bilateral agreements according to a reuters review of pdvsa trade documents
but only around bpd were applied to debt service under the grace period arrangement according to one of the sources with china paying the remainder in cash
without the grace period the amount applied to debt service rises to bpd the sources said
venezuela and pdvsa are in default on nearly billion in international bonds because they have failed to make more than billion in interest payments
bondholders have yet to take legal action in part because most believe maduro is unwilling to make changes to revive the economy and because sanctions effectively block them from buying any newly issued venezuelan bonds making a restructuring practically impossible
pdvsa also has hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding bills to suppliers and partners
italian energy company eni said on friday that pdvsa s debt had risen to million euros million from million euros in february and that payments were near euros reporting by corina pons additional reporting by marianna parraga in houston ben blanchard in beijing and engen tham in shanghai writing by brian ellsworth editing by daniel flynn and rosalba
