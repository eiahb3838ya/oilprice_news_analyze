update 3-conoco sues to enforce $2 bln award that venezuela scorns
caracas reuters venezuela on thursday scorned a billion award to conocophillips over a nationalization as the oil producer filed suit in a federal court to enforce the decision
venezuelan president nicolas maduro s government called the award a tough lesson given it was less than percent of what conoco originally sought
it also said it may appeal wednesday s ruling by the international chamber of commerce icc against venezuela s oil company pdvsa
conoco filed suit on thursday in the district court in manhattan seeking to enforce the award saying the court had jurisdiction because the icc arbitration was held in new york and pdvsa had not responded to a demand for payment
conoco s assets in venezuela were expropriated in following nationalization of the country s oil industry led by hugo chavez
the firm left the opec nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by pdvsa
the icc has no means of enforcing its decisions
we intend to be aggressive and persistent in recovering the award conoco chief financial officer don wallette told investors on a thursday conference call
it s something that s going to take time to recover the value that we conoco had sought up to billion from pdvsa for broken contracts and loss of future profits from the hamaca and petrozuata oil projects
the agreements with pdvsa contained price formulas that limited the compensation conoco could claim
a separate arbitration case by conoco against venezuela before the world bank s international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid introduced in could result in a final decision later this year a lawyer close to the case said
conoco s wallette said the company hopes the icsid award which is not subject to price formula limitations will represent a full compensation for our value the case is phillips petroleum co v petroleos de venezuela district court southern district of new york no
