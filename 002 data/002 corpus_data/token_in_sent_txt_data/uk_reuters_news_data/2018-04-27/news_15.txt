mangroves and mapping help mozambique tackle climate change
bonn germany april thomson reuters foundation m ozambique not only has one of africa s longest coastlines it is also the final destination for at least nine transnational rivers
that makes it a hostage to geography says manuel de araujo the mayor of quelimane a port city of people that lies about kilometres miles north of the capital maputo
the fact that percent of the country s population lives along the coast adds to the challenges of managing climate change he said in bonn on friday at an international conference on building resilient cities
with frequent extreme weather threatening the delicate urban balance of quelimane most of which lies below the population is extremely vulnerable to climate risks he said
the city is easily flooded both from rain and from marine floods and tides sometimes they all happen at the same time he said
in quelimane one solution involves restoring hectares of mangroves which act as a solution against flooding helping to stem the tide by preventing soil erosion
mangroves are our first line of defence araujo said of the scheme which is supported by the development agency usaid
the project has a social dimension too mangrove nurseries are planted in the poorest parts of the city where residents particularly women manage and conserve the young plants
high levels of poverty meant people were used to cutting down mangroves for cooking or building he said
but working with schools and religious leaders and putting out a conservation message in the local language via radio means the community now knows to protect mangroves
there is a political given that community members and leaders are involved in all stages of the restoration process he said
this is very important as it brings ownership to the a further kilometres northeast of quelimane is the popular tourist city of pemba
its mayor tagir carimo said nearly of the city is vulnerable to climate threats such as flooding and soil erosion
on the very day that carimo was sworn in as mayor pemba was pummelled by heavy rain and flooding the consequences of which he is still fixing
one major effort by his city has been to use satellite imagery and local knowledge to map parcels of land and neighbourhoods at higher risks of climate effects such as flooding he told the conference in bonn
the main gains are that from maps we can see properly what type of land we can use and advise people on which kinds of materials they should use to build houses roads and so on he said
whether building homes or drainage systems he said the population now feels more secure knowing that they are developing land in safe or areas
mozambique is one of the world s poorest countries with an average life expectancy of according to the world bank
that makes it to fund adaptation to climate threats said carimo
the main difficulty is how to provide finance carimo told the thomson reuters foundation particularly when survival often seems more pressing
however araujo noted the two might soon merge disasters cost mozambique between and percent of gdp annually with that figure set to rise due to climate change he said
given the country growing population and increased migration to its coastal cities both mayors said a shift in mindset was needed from funders to allow climate change adaption and development to go
