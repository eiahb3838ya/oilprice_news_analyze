feature-for turkey's alevi minority, dam-building plans threaten way of life
tunceli turkey april thomson reuters foundation b aris yildirim a lawyer and activist strolled across a manicured park on the edge of the munzur river that runs through tunceli a small city in eastern turkey
on the other side of a fence is the uzuncayir hydropower dam that was completed in and flooded a site sacred to alevis the country s largest religious minority
yildirim an alevi living in the home of his ancestors who revere nature has been on a mission since to stop the government from building more dams in the province
this park was built to appease us by the company who built that dam yildirim said bitterly
but now we have to pray through a yildirum has filed lawsuits and won some cases over the years
his latest battle is to prevent the government seizing land for the konaktepe dam which would be located inside a nearby nature reserve
winning he said could mean saving the alevi s cultural heritage
the founder of modern turkey mustafa kemal ataturk saw dams as a way forward for the developing nation and many of those now being built were planned decades ago
locals who oppose the dams have become victims of the country s energy politics said ozer meral uc an ecologist and member of the munzur flows freely movement a coalition of civil society groups in tunceli
officials have publicly said hydroelectric dams are needed to meet turkey s energy and water needs and reduce its dependency on countries that sell energy
the state wants to reduce its dependence on energy from foreign countries uc said
but the konaktepe will flood people s moreoever water stored in dams could prevent drought for several years if needed the government has said
last year water levels were at their lowest in nearly half a century
making up about percent of turkey s million people alevis draw from shi a sufi and anatolian folk traditions practicing distinct rituals which can put them at odds with their sunni muslim counterparts many of whom accuse them of heresy
the government is trying to assimilate us into sunni islam
there s a project to kill our culture and heritage said yildirim
the government which has held a series of workshops for alevis to allow them to voice their concerns in an effort to reconcile tense relations was unavailable for comment despite numerous emails and calls
four years ago yildirim won a lawsuit at the country s highest court halting construction of the konaktepe dam
the court ruled the dam was illegal as it would cut through the munzur national park an area rich in biodiversity where types of flora and fauna thrive
despite the ruling the government has continued to push forward with the project by buying and seizing land yildirim said
the ruling justice and development party akp has ramped up building dams in alone local media said despite an international outcry from environmentalists and local people
when the government seizes land to build infrastructure deemed in the national interest it is legally obliged to compensate landowners
when they refuse to sell cases end up in court
despite the court ruling four years ago the resmi gazete which publishes laws and official announcements said in the government would expropriate land in the mountains where the konaktepe dam was going to be built
once completed the dam would produce percent of the country s energy worth million annually according to a report from the istanbul water tribunal an international body that resolves water conflicts
some people have already sold their land
many of the people who sell their land don t understand the consequences yildirim said
back in celal kara s father sold his land when one of the first tunceli dams the mercan was being built
kara said he was duped
my father was convinced because the government then told us that our village will look like paris
but the trees were cut down
nature was destroyed and we lost our village she said
the konaktepe dam was one of a number of projects planned in in a deal between turkey and the united states department of commerce
the plan originally envisioned the involvement of exim bank which underwrites risk for companies abroad though the bank told the thomson reuters foundation by email it was involved only in the phase
opaqueness around the project means it is unclear which foreign or local companies are involved or even at what stage the process is at activists said
sarah bardeen a spokeswoman for international rivers a advocacy group said tunceli locals were in a difficult position
governments need to abide by their judiciary and turkey s judiciary decisively halted the konaktepe dam in
but the project is rearing its ugly head again bardeen said
if the government won t abide by the rules locals and their allies will have to target the financiers and the construction companies that are moving forward with an illegal project against the wishes of the local yildirim and other activists in the munzur flows freely movement said solar power would prove much less damaging to their sacred environment and could meet their energy needs
protests against projects fizzled out after the government fined protesters in tunceli and elsewhere following the attempted coup in when rogue elements in the military tried to overthrow president recep tayyip erdogan
turkey has been in a state of emergency since then
in the ovacik district of tunceli mountains loom over an alevi holy site where young men and women in jeans and sweaters light candles and place them in the crevices of steps on the edge of the munzur river
nearby yurdanur toprak a mother of two daughters cooks gozleme a dough
her cheeks red from the heat toprak said they did not need dams
the fish will die our nature will be damaged
