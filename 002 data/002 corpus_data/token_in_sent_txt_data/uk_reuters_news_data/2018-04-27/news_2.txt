u.s. seeks revision of rule on offshore oil wells made after bp disaster
washington reuters the trump administration on friday proposed relaxing a rule on offshore oil wells that was finalized after the bp plc disaster and crude spill in the gulf of mexico as part of its effort to slash regulations it considers burdensome on industry
the exact revisions to the well control rule proposed by the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee an office of the department of interior will be known next week when they are published in the federal register
but the proposed changes will include removing prescriptive requirements for monitoring of offshore drilling facilities and allow the oil producers to use approaches a bsee fact sheet said
the proposed revisions will also seek to minimize what bsee says are duplicative notifications of rig movements that operators are required to send to the agency
in addition independent groups would be allowed to do some certifications and verifications on parts of preventers which seek to stop the uncontrolled releases of crude according to the fact sheet
the macondo disaster killed oil rig workers was the biggest environmental disaster in history and has cost bp about billion
while drilling interests had pushed the agency to revise the rule scott angelle the director of bsee said in a blog that the agency would never put offshore workers or the environment at greater risk
at the same time we are equally dedicated to addressing overly burdensome regulations and even more so to amending or eliminating regulations that may decrease safety or increase the chances of environmental harm he said
randall luthi the president of national ocean industries association said changes to the rule would increase efficiency and do not in any way constitute a rollback in offshore
senator bill nelson a florida democrat was concerned the revisions would weaken the offshore regulations
these rules were put in place to prevent another massive oil spill off our coasts he said
we can t allow this new administration to take us backwards in the proposal will be published next week and open to a public comment period
