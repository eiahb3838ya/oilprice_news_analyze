update 1-germany approves offshore wind parks able to generate 1,610 mw
frankfurt reuters germany has granted approval for offshore wind parks capable of generating megawatts mw of power at contract prices above the unexpectedly low bids in an auction a year ago
the total amount of electricity that could be produced by the parks approved on friday equates to the power generated by one large nuclear power station or two big or power plants
offshore wind costs have fallen sharply around the north sea as the industry develops with turbines of to mw size due to be delivered in the next decade able to offer twice today s performance
proximity to existing construction and maintenance hubs and to onshore connections is also allowing more economies of scale
in the industry s infancy operators secured support payments for years as there was little experience of installing turbines far out at sea
six projects were granted licenses for construction at an average euro cents per kilowatt hour kwh compared with an average euro cents in the first auction a year ago the bundesnetzagentur network agency said
this auction wraps up two rounds for a total mw of projects applied for before after which new projects became subject to reforms to the offshore subsidy scheme
while the industry has cut costs sharply in recent years last year s results were widely viewed as overly optimistic
bundesnetzagentur president jochen homann said on friday this year s result reflected a changed competitive situation but noted the range of bids made by operators again included some not seeking a subsidy without giving details
the range was between zero and cents for the six projects three of which are in the baltic sea and three in the north sea
germany s innogy said it had been awarded the rights to build and operate the mw kaskasi wind farm in the north sea
denmark s orsted formerly dong said it won approval for two bids of a joint mw in the north sea
the other winning companies were iberdrola s german branch knk wind and baltic eagle
the operators rely on expected wholesale power price revenue for the time that the offshore wind capacity starts operating plus the auction price awarded to achieve profitability
the winners get an option to build the wind parks between and at the price they were awarded or pay penalties
they also gain the right to onshore connections and operation rights for years
german thermal operators currently obtain cents a kwh in the wholesale market for power delivery next year while of electricity pay around due to a high share of taxes and fees
last year orsted and enbw won a total mw of capacity permits for pledging to build mw of the total at zero subsidy
the next auction round will be held in for capacity after
