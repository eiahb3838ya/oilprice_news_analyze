analysis-higher oil prices could be a game changer for asia's trade-gap trio
kong reuters asia s most externally vulnerable economies india indonesia and the philippines have just taken a punch
treasury bond yields hit percent this week a level long touted as one to watch for potential portfolio outflows from the region where interest rates have barely shifted since the federal reserve began slowing hiking policy rates in late
an even bigger worry is that oil prices hit year highs not only do these countries run the biggest current account deficits of asia s major economies but they are also among region s most voracious oil importers
if oil prices stay at their current levels of around a barrel projections for inflation growth budget and trade deficits could be missed increasing selling pressure on the trio s currencies stocks and bonds already among asia s worst performers and potentially forcing their central banks to raise interest rates sooner than they otherwise would
higher rates could in turn hurt growth and budgets creating a loop that further erodes confidence in local assets
if higher oil prices are sustained interest rates will be raised faster than anticipated said tilak doshi analyst at energy consultancy muse stancil co
in its projections for growth and inflation indonesia s central bank said it works on an assumption of oil at a barrel
the philippines said it works with while india according to two finance ministry sources works with
these averages might still be attained if oil prices drop back but the recent has prompted many analysts to call an end to the oil market slump that started in and prompted hints that policymakers assumptions are changing
in february the philippines central bank raised its inflation projection to percent from percent previously mainly due to higher oil prices but expects this to be a temporary breach of its percent target
at the start of the year it was expected to raise interest rates once or twice in
now some analysts see three hikes
india and indonesia were the last major central banks in asia to cut rates last year and were mostly expected to stay put throughout but analysts say hikes are now on the table
indonesia said on tuesday it had been selling foreign currency in quite a sizeable amount to halt the rupiah s depreciation since last week
at an imf meeting in washington on sunday reserve bank of india rbi governor urjit patel flagged oil prices as a growing risk for inflation
philippines three interest rate hikes are expected in the next three meetings
if oil prices stay at these levels then rbi may have to raise rates indonesia is the next country to watch said robert subbaraman chief economist for asia at nomura
the philippines current account deficit doubled to percent of gdp last year
indonesia s current account deficit is seen doubling in the first quarter to percent of gdp the same level that india s was in
and things are getting worse
indonesia s crude oil imports bill rose by billion or percent on the year in
the philippines significantly scaled back oil imports in the first quarter but still spent million more than the total
india s oil imports cost rose by billion or percent in the same period
trade balances for india philippines indonesia deteriorate amid rising import costs local assets are feeling the pressure
the philippine peso indonesian rupiah and indian rupee have lost around percent from their early january highs
indian stocks fell around percent indonesia percent and philippines percent
bond yields are up basis points bps in india and more than bps in indonesia and the philippines over the same period
by contrast in south korea also a major oil importer but one that runs a trade surplus the won is steady stocks are up and bond yields are marginally higher
analysts see the selling pressure intensifying
this week maybank revised its rupee forecast to per dollar around current levels from previously and anz revised it to from
we think the surge in oil price is a key game changer for the rupee as the rise in oil prices present a double whammy on india one in terms of current account deterioration and two in terms of upside risks to inflation maybank analysts said
to be sure all three countries are considered to have adequate foreign exchange reserves and the current account positions of india and indonesia are better than during the previous lengthy period of outflows from asia in prompted by the fed s first signals that its unconventional easing measures were about to be rolled back
current account and fx reserves in india indonesia philippines higher oil prices could make those economies more vulnerable but are unlikely to cause panic
nomura estimates each per barrel increase in oil prices could widen the trade deficit in the philippines by percent of gdp and raise inflation by bps
in indonesia it could lower the trade balance by percent of gdp and add bps to inflation
in india it could worsen the current account balance by percent of gdp and increase inflation by bps
in a note in february anz said an average oil price of a barrel could add bps to inflation in each country
fuel prices are especially politically sensitive in asia s poorer countries and a further risk is that higher costs could push governments to raise subsidies or introduce tighter regulation on prices which could contain inflation but hurt central budgets and energy firms
indonesian president joko widodo and indian prime minister narendra modi are facing elections in the coming year having enjoyed oil prices at historically low levels throughout their terms
in indonesia state oil firm pertamina is shouldering the burden of subsidies as the government has pledged to keep prices unchanged for two years
india has not taken any such measures
i would classify subsidies as a policy mistake because it means reallocating fiscal resources in an inefficient way said alexander wolf senior emerging markets economist at aberdeen standard investments
