focus-the auto plants of the future may have a surprisingly human touch
reuters carmakers have big plans for their next generation of factories smarter designs artificial intelligence and collaborative robots building a wide range of vehicles on the same line
the plants will also feature a component they say is the secret ingredient to flexible manufacturing humans
s factory in shanghai which opened in is one of the world s most advanced auto plants assembling buick minivans and cadillac sedans and suvs including the hybrid for consumers
gm s shanghai plant is expected to eventually produce new electric vehicles primarily for the chinese market executives have said
the plant which gm operates with chinese partner saic motor corp ltd feels almost like a scene from a star wars film with battalions of machines quietly working in harmony
collaborative robots or cobots painted matte green and unrestrained by the steel cages that surround their larger industrial cousins are being programmed to work alongside humans on the line
one unusual operation advanced models now handle is installing gears in transmissions
they can actually feel they can pick up a gear set and mesh the gear into a transmission paul buetow gm s china manufacturing chief said on a recent tour of the plant
the robots reduce strain on humans and improve quality and consistency
globally automakers are embracing industry a term coined by german manufacturers for the digitalization and automation of assembly processes and the consensus is that fewer people will be required in future factories
but humans will still be needed
this is not about cutting head count said an insider familiar with industry efforts to upgrade and streamline auto plants in the united states china and europe
the focus instead is on improving flexibility and efficiency between machines and humans as automakers figure out how to build multiple models powered by gas engines electric motors or both in the same factory
it s not just blood and sweat that goes into manufacturing on an assembly line said united auto workers president dennis williams
it s critical thinking that automation can t a new generation of cobots is working alongside humans at general motors co plants from shanghai to orion township michigan
the orion plant north of detroit is one of the industry s most flexible
it builds three models on one line the chevrolet sonic the chevrolet bolt ev and the cruise av
more than robots work there including a cobots painted green to denote they can safely operate around humans
the machines handle the dirty dull difficult and dangerous tasks while people do the work requiring dexterity and intelligence says marty linn gm s principal engineer for robotics
in one section of the plant cobots glue protective pads onto headliners a tough job for humans because the glue is heated to scalding temperatures before it is applied
at another station a cobot takes new spare tires off a conveyor belt and stacks them on a cart
this gm s linn said was a job workers universally hated because it was repetitive and
at the end of the line cobots ensure headlamps are properly aligned
they will also be used to test sensors on automated vehicles linn said
markus schaefer head of production and supply chain at daimler ag s cars said the german automaker is paring back automation in final assembly to boost flexibility
we need this because we are making a greater variety of derivatives and as a premium automaker we make highly individualized vehicles he said
schaefer said mercedes will eventually have plants that can build vehicles with different powertrains and with both and drive
the automaker is converting its showcase sindelfingen plant to build the gla a compact utility vehicle as well as its luxury sedan
how collaborative robots and other digital tools are used will determine the size and layout of future factories and how many humans work there
ford motor co executive joe hinrichs created a stir last october when detailing the automaker s vision of a future factory for electric vehicles which have fewer parts than those with combustion engines and thus would require far less floor space fewer workers and lower investment
but like other major global carmakers ford appears reluctant to invest in dedicated plants until there is sufficient and consistent demand to justify the expense
ford has years of experience building different types of vehicles on one line including versions of the focus compact with gasoline engines and electric motors
ford has installed a few collaborative robots at its recently renovated louisville kentucky truck plant
the company is also using digital tools such as including augmented reality to map new assembly lines and predictive analytics to schedule repairs and maintenance before machines break down
the company has no immediate plans for a separate highly automated plant for its electric vehicles some of which are expected to share factory space with traditional models according to sources familiar with ford s strategy
an april report by barclays global auto investment team predicted robots won t kill all automotive jobs at least not in the near term
auto companies are working on perfecting the combination of human and robot according to the report because the human touch is still even tesla chief executive elon musk who long praised robots virtues and promised to turn his california electric car factory into a highly automated alien dreadnought has had something of an epiphany
bedeviled by technical glitches musk recently tweeted excessive automation at tesla was a mistake
humans are edward taylor reported from frankfurt germany norihiko shirouzu reported from shanghai and nick carey reported from detroit written by paul lienert edited by gerry doyle
