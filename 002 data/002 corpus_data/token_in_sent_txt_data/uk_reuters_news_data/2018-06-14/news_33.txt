exclusive-global warming set to exceed 1.5Â°c, slow growth -un draft
oslo reuters global warming is on course to exceed the most stringent goal set in the paris agreement by around threatening economic growth according to a draft report that is the s starkest warning yet of the risks of climate change
governments can still cap temperatures below the strict degrees celsius fahrenheit ceiling agreed in only with rapid and transitions in the world economy according to the s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc
the final government draft obtained by reuters and dated june is due for publication in october in south korea after revisions and approval by governments
it will be the main scientific guide for combating climate change
if emissions continue at their present rate warming will exceed by around according to the report which broadly reaffirms findings in an earlier draft in january but is more robust after comments from experts and a wider pool of scientific literature
the paris climate agreement adopted by almost nations in set a goal of limiting warming to well below a rise of above times while pursuing efforts for the tougher goal
the deal has been weakened after president donald trump decided last year to pull out and promote fossil fuels
temperatures are already up about and are rising at a rate of about a decade according to the draft requested by world leaders as part of the paris agreement
economic growth is projected to be lower at warming than at for many developed and developing countries it said drained by impacts such as floods or droughts that can undermine crop growth or an increase in human deaths from heatwaves
in a world for instance sea level rise would be centimeters inches less than with exposing about million fewer people in coastal areas to risks such as floods storm surges or salt spray damaging crops
it says current government pledges in the paris agreement are too weak to limit warming to
ipcc spokesman jonathan lynn said it did not comment on the contents of draft reports while work was still ongoing
it s all a bit punchier said one official with access to the report who said it seemed slightly less pessimistic about prospects of limiting a rise in global temperatures that will affect the poorest nations hardest
the report outlines one new scenario to stay below for instance in which technological innovations and changes in lifestyles could mean sharply lower energy demand by even with rising economic growth
and there is no sign that the draft has been watered down by trump s doubts that climate change is driven by greenhouse gases
the draft says renewable energies such as wind solar and hydro power would have to surge by percent from levels by to stay below while primary energy from coal decreases by
by that meant renewables would supply between and percent of primary energy
the report says governments may have to find ways to extract vast amounts of carbon from the air for instance by planting vast forests to turn down the global thermostat if warming overshoots the target
it omits radical fixes such as spraying chemicals high into the atmosphere to dim sunlight saying such measures face large uncertainties and knowledge reporting by alister doyle editing by john stonestreet
