disputed power tariff regime in norway may trigger battery storage market
oslo june reuters a proposed power tariff in norway that will make it expensive for subscribers to overconsume electricity could trigger demand for battery storage the country s water resources and energy regulator nve told reuters
the new tariff proposed by nve and due to take effect from is designed to replace the current volumetric regime as under the current system consumers have more capacity available than they actually use making network investments inefficient said nve
under the new system consumers may turn to energy storage solutions rather than pay the heavy premiums if their energy needs exceed their preset levels helping develop norway s relatively small battery market
customers subscribe to a certain amount of network capacity at a given price per kw
consumption beyond the subscribed level is charged at a significantly higher price said nve s senior adviser velaug mook
by all electricity customers will have a smart meter installed providing better information regarding installed and used capacity and prices which will allow them to calculate the subscription level they need he said
the proposed tariff model will give customers better incentives for storage of energy than today s tariff added mook
customers can use stored energy when their consumption is high and retrieve energy from the network for storage when their consumption is low
furthermore batteries can be used to reduce the cost of charging electrical vehicles she said
the proposed change hasn t found much support in the market with companies fearing higher costs in case their energy needs assessment falls short
after receiving feedback from public consultations nve said it understands the proposed subscribed capacity model is not preferred and will assess whether there is a need for adjustments
overall costs are not expected to increase for network users said mook
instead the price for the use of electricity per kilowatt hour goes down whilst pricing for simultaneous consumption in kilowatts is introduced
