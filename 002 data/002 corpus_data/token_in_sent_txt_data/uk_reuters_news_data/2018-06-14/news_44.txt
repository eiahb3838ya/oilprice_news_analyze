low on snow: norway's power prices soar as dry spring gulps down reservoirs
oslo reuters norway europe s largest hydropower producer faces higher energy costs this summer as much of the snow accumulating in its mountains evaporated or melted into the ground during a shock heat wave its water resources and energy regulator said
following an unusually cold winter that depleted power producers reservoirs more than usual companies had relied on a gradual spring melt to replenish dams but projections now show this is no longer feasible the nve directorate told reuters
some customers may not be happy with their power bill in but that is the cost of a weather dependent power system
in wet and normal years power prices tend to be lower nve adviser martin andreas vik said
with about percent of norway s energy needs covered by electricity from hydropower the expected lower reservoir levels drove spot power prices to above euros per megawatt hour on average this week double
from to early june temperatures in southern norway hit records for that time of the year exceeding degrees celsius fahrenheit and leading many municipalities to ban outdoor barbecuing to prevent fires
this is the driest period ever recorded with measurements from until today vik said as projections showed more snow had evaporated or melted into the ground than had flowed into reservoirs
the melting season is not over but we have less snow left in norway than normal vik added
by june the remaining snow that had yet to melt in mountain regions corresponded to an estimated future power output of terawatt hours as opposed to twh in a normal year he said
by june norway s reservoirs were percent full still higher than last year s percent but with much less snow left to melt it was only rain that could significantly increase it
last year reservoir fillings peaked at percent in late october
in the peak will come much earlier as norway has so far received twh less rain and snow than normal equal to percent in reservoir capacity nve said
while the cold winter and subsequent smaller inflows drove norway s prices higher they were not the only market driver vik said
increasing and coal prices combined with low wind power production in europe made norwegian electricity more competitive to export and even during the dry period norway continued to supply its neighbors through interconnections
