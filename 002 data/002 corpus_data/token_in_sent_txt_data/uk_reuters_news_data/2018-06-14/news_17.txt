eu's energy chief sees ukraine, russia gas talks in early july
brussels june reuters the european union is seeking a date in early july to mediate talks between russia and ukraine over future gas transit to europe once their contract expires in the eu s energy chief told reuters on thursday
russia s expansion of the nord stream gas pipeline directly to germany and the construction of the new turkstream pipeline to turkey has raised doubts about continued gas flows through ukraine the traditional route for supplies to europe
eu leaders worry the new routes will allow russian export monopoly gazprom which supplies over a quarter of the bloc s gas needs to cut volumes via ukraine depriving the struggling economy of valuable transit fees
this is a priority on which we have a european consensus european commission vice president maros sefcovic said
we have a percent consensus that the gas transits should be maintained in the post he highlighted germany s support and what he said was its acknowldgement that the issue had polarised the bloc after eastern european member states opposed the nord stream pipeline of which berlin is the main beneficiary
sefcovic said he wanted talks to bring together political and company representatives from both russian and ukraine as well as diplomats from france and germany
i hope that we can start working out how we are going to go through these very complex issues he said
if we solve this politically very sensitive issue then it would help us to solve other crucial issues for europe but also for ukraine s nagftogaz is seeking firm guarantees on future transits and sefcovic said clarity over future pipeline operations were crucial for securing european investment to modernise the country s gas transit system
the best guarantee would be the bookings and commercially viable volumes sefcovic said
