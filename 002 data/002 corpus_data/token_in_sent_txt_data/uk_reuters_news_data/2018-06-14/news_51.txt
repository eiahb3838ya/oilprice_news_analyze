rpt-column-oil market’s shock absorbers becoming dangerously depleted: kemp
repeats june column

the views expressed are his own chart chart by john kemp london june reuters sanctions on iran and the continued decline in output from venezuela will leave the oil market very vulnerable to any further production or consumption surprises next year
output and demand in the global market are each currently running at almost million barrels per day bpd
to ensure a steady flow of oil from the wellhead to consumers the industry relies on a series of shock absorbers to handle any interruption in supplies or unexpected strength in demand
in rough order of responsiveness these buffers are commercial inventories opec spare capacity strategic stocks production consumption restraint both commercial inventories and opec spare capacity have become dangerously eroded over the last months leaving the oil market much more vulnerable in
if all the other shock absorbers become exhausted oil prices will have to rise to the point where consumption growth begins to slow
the oil market s first line of defence comes from changes in the volume of commercial inventories held by producers traders and refiners
oecd commercial stocks currently stand at billion barrels composed of crude billion barrels other liquids million barrels and refined products billion barrels
additional stocks are held in countries as well as on tankers and in pipelines either in transit from oilfields to refineries and on to final customers or as floating storage
the vast majority of stocks are held for operational reasons to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil from wellhead to final customers
only a small percentage generally less than percent can be considered discretionary and available to act as a shock absorber
oecd crude and product stocks are already million barrels below the average according to the international energy agency oil market report iea june
the average was inflated by the glut of oil between and so it may not be representative of the normal level of inventories
but global oil consumption has also increased by more than million bpd over the five years since so other things being equal producers traders and refiners will want to hold more stocks for operational reasons
the fact that futures prices for both brent and wti are in backwardation implies oil traders see stocks as already fairly tight and expected to tighten further
for the last four decades the oil industry s second line of defence has been the existence of significant volumes of spare production capacity
nearly all spare production capacity is held by saudi arabia with smaller volumes held by kuwait and the united arab emirates
russia may also hold a small amount of spare capacity at the moment following the decision taken in to restrain production
other opec and members essentially produce as much as they are able and do not hold significant spare capacity
opec s spare capacity currently amounts to less than million bpd according to the energy information administration energy outlook eia june
in its latest oil market update the international energy agency explored a scenario in which exports from venezuela and iran could decline by as much as million barrels per day by the end of
to compensate for the lost output saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates could boost production by just over million bpd with additional supplies from russia according to the iea
but if this scenario comes to pass opec spare capacity will be reduced to less than million bpd the lowest level since
production with oil inventories already tight and spare capacity set to shrink the industry will have to fall back on strategic stocks and production to meet any unexpected shortfall
oecd governments and refiners hold almost billion barrels of crude and products in strategic storage which can be released in the event of an emergency
china has also amassed a strategic stockpile estimated at more than million barrels according to the international energy agency
strategic stocks are the third line of defence
but the circumstances under which oecd and china s strategic stocks would be released to the market remain opaque
experience suggests governments react to the security and economic threat from both actual shortages of crude a sharp rise in prices
however strategic stock releases can not be predicted and strategic stocks are not generally considered available to the market
the industry will therefore be forced to rely on production its fourth line of defence
most production comes from the shale sector with smaller volumes available from the accelerated development of existing oilfields in other parts of the world
but even production can take months or more to reach the market given the lengthy delays involved in securing extra drilling rigs fracking wells and connecting them up to the distribution system
the shale supply chain is already extremely stretched with reported shortages of experienced fracking crews and truckers
and pipelines to move the produced oil from the shale fields to refining centres on the gulf coast or onto tankers for export are full
producers may therefore struggle to plug any additional shortfall in oil supplies next year especially if consumption growth remains strong
and production from new oilfields takes too long to develop to be of any real use as a shock absorber
so the final shock absorber is always the consumer
oil prices will have to rise high enough in to slow growth in consumption and restore inventory and spare capacity buffers to a more comfortable level
rising prices will slow consumption growth through some combination of behavioural changes to cut fuel use switching to alternative fuels and slower gdp growth in consuming countries
consumption is not very responsive to a small change in oil prices at least in the short term so large price increases are required to enforce demand restraint
between and and again between and high oil prices coincided with falling consumption in the oecd
in both cases the rise in prices was followed by a slowdown in consumption growth and a faster increase in production eventually rebuilding stocks and spare capacity
the combination of falling venezuelan output sanctions on iran low commercial stocks low spare capacity and constraints on the expansion of shale is priming the market for higher prices in
the most likely outcome is a further rise in prices to enforce demand restraint a recession in the major consuming countries to bring the market back to balance again
