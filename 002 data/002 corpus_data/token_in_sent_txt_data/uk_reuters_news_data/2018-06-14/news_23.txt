update 2-vw could face further fines from german authorities
braunschweig germany reuters volkswagen could face additional fines in munich and stuttgart on top of the billion euros bln it has been told to pay for management lapses which caused emissions cheating on million vw diesel cars
prosecutors in the german town of braunschweig used a administrative order to fine volkswagen for oversight problems which allowed millions of polluting vw cars to hit the road
the fine is one of the biggest ever penalties imposed by german authorities against a company
it deals yet another blow to one of germany s big industries which is struggling to recover from the fallout from the emissions cheating scandal that broke in
the billion euro fine is not included in the billion euros billion that europe s biggest carmaker has set aside to cover costs related to its admission that it cheated diesel emissions tests and it will hit earnings analysts at evercore isi said
but shareholders should welcome the move since it marks an end to some of the criminal proceedings against the carmaker they added
however that is not the end of vw s legal problems
prosecutors in the southern city of munich said they too are examining whether to impose similar fines on vw s premium division audi for its role manipulating and cylinder diesel engines
that would be in addition to braunschweig s fine which sanctioned violations tied to diesel engines
stuttgart prosecutors who have launched a probe against employees at daimler porsche which is another part of the volkswagen group and auto supplier bosch said they too may consider the use of an administrative order
in all these proceedings it is possible that a regulatory offense procedure will be carried out we are still evaluating this possibility a spokesman for the stuttgart prosecutor s office said on thursday
prosecutors in braunschweig are also investigating volkswagen executives including chairman hans dieter poetsch and chief executive herbert diess to see if they informed investors in a timely fashion about the scale of potential fines faced by the carmaker for cheating emissions tests
the company denies any wrongdoing by its executives
braunschweig said it may rule on the matter in the coming months
the town is the main legal jurisdiction covering vw s headquarters in the german town of wolfsburg
on market manipulation it is possible that there will be a decision this year
a decision does not necessarily mean bringing charges it could mean closing the proceedings braunschweig prosecutor klaus ziehe said at a news conference
in a filing submitted to a braunschweig court on volkswagen argued it did not violate corporate disclosure rules because it did not understand the scope of potential fines and claims faced by the company
four days before regulators blew the whistle on volkswagen poetsch the company s chief financial officer at the time saw the potential financial risk from emissions violations at million euros the court filing shows
authorities disclosed volkswagen s systematic emissions cheating on sparking the biggest business scandal in the company s history and triggering a crackdown on emissions across the industry
volkswagen shares were up percent by gmt outperforming the dax index and the stoxx autos index
