u.s. energy firms chasing oil price rally stumble on old baggage
new york reuters with oil price recovery taking hold several oil and gas companies entered with a compelling plan sell undeveloped or less essential fields and invest the money to boost returns from their sweetest most productive spots
there is a catch though
the strategy assumes that with crude now up more than percent from its february bottom enough firms are keen to crank up production even if it means buying fields with higher extraction costs and lower margins
so far sale attempts suggest those buyers may be hard to come by
after a bruising downturn shareholders are looking to get a cut of improved profits and asset sale proceeds rather than underwrite acquisitions those involved in these deals say
oil and gas companies are no longer rewarded for simply grabbing land and public investors have become more discerning regarding acquisitions notes jon marinelli head of energy investment and corporate banking at bmo capital markets
shares of devon energy corp qep resources inc and southwestern energy co and others have rallied after they floated plans to sell acreage reflecting hopes that some of the proceeds will return to investors
but since shareholders across the industry in general favor shedding assets over acquisitions the sentiment makes striking new deals tricky
an informal poll of five investment bankers by reuters put the share of sales that failed to close in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this year at between percent and percent with marinelli putting the figure at around
dealmaking for oil and gas fields going into was already stagnating
while last year total sales were only marginally down from at billion the first quarter accounted for around percent of that figure according to data provider pls
graphic if proposed sales fail to materialize this year it could mean a time of reckoning for these oil and gas firms
if these companies can not execute the divestiture s that gave investors confidence on their future leverage profile you would likely see less investors trim or sell their positions said tim dumois portfolio manager at bp capital fund advisors which invests in energy stocks
among those seeking miner bhp billiton ltd has the most ambitious plans
facing the same pressure from shareholders as energy producers it wants to sell onshore shale assets in the permian eagle ford and haynesville basins valuing them at billion on its balance sheet
while bhp s permian and eagle ford land is generally considered attractive because of low production costs one of the eagle ford asset packages and its haynesville fields mainly produce shale gas making them less appealing to buyers given gas prices
bhp would consider a bid that valued the entire business below the company s original valuation if it ensured no unsold assets remained according to people familiar with the sale process
the company received bids from interested parties on may although a final decision on what it will do is not expected for a few months
for those weighing acquisitions bakken operator oasis petroleum offers a cautionary tale
shares in the company fell as much as percent in the two days after it said on it paid million for acreage in the delaware basin
since then major land purchases by oil and gas firms have fizzled with executives preaching focus on controlling costs and avoiding unnecessary expansion
we can do a whole lot of great work by hitting some singles brad holly chief executive officer of whiting petroleum corp told an industry event in april drawing on a baseball metaphor to describe how the company was looking for some really small things to add to its existing acreage
in the absence of companies as buyers private equity firms have picked up some slack the value of land bought by buyout firms rose to percent of the total in the fourth quarter from percent in the first three months of according to pls
however the in oil prices rather than whet their appetite further has an opposite effect making private equity firms wary that prices may not be as strong when they are ready to cash out
higher crude prices also boost sellers expectations making it harder for buyout firms to drive a hard bargain to ensure better future profits
such calculations gain added significance after years of returns on energy stocks trailing other sectors
if energy equity markets are underperforming the wider s p this reduces the chance of private equity buying larger assets because you don t think you ll get a good runway for an exit said glenn jacobson partner at trilantic capital partners
some sellers have now started moderating their expectations
hunt oil company for example owned by one of texas wealthiest families split a package of eagle ford land it was marketing for up to million in the fourth quarter into three individual pieces according to a person familiar with the transaction
two bits went to private equity buyers with a third sold to penn virginia corp for million the person added
the decision becomes do you hold your nose and sell or do you retain the asset said bmo s marinelli
