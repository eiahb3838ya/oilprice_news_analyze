this version of june story corrects to remove reference to incorrect description of occidental derivatives strategy
by ayenat mersie and david gaffen new york reuters many top shale oil producers are missing out on the rally in oil prices to more than a barrel because they sold their oil through futures contracts at about last year when that looked like a good deal
now it looks cheap
those hedged bets will hold down revenues and further frustrate wall street investors who have been disappointed by slow returns from the booming permian basin in west texas
the top shale producers will forego about billion in combined revenues in the second quarter with oil prices at about according to consultancy petronerds
many of those producers used hedges that guaranteed them between and a barrel
some west texas producers face a second dynamic they are forced to cut prices because the region s production is overwhelming its pipeline network raising transportation costs
west texas oil currently trades at a discount of to benchmark futures a spread that hit earlier in the month
some firms earlier protected themselves from the widening gap with hedges against the discount
but those that didn t and also hedged against future prices at for instance at have been forced to sell barrels at prices in the
many firms sold their future output at prices in the last year hoping to take advantage of rallies to lock in guaranteed income to cover drilling and production costs
those costs can be a barrel or less in west texas allowing the firms a healthy profit even as they protected themselves against future price slumps
but the cost of that protection is to forego the potential upside of higher prices
the second problem with pipeline capacity stems from surprisingly quick production growth that has pushed pipeline capacity to the limit several months before producers expected said michael tran global energy strategist at rbc capital markets
producers in west texas the nation s largest oilfield are now pumping more than million bpd compared with million bpd a year ago
with storage brimming and pipelines full producers have had to offer steep discounts to compensate for rising transport costs
the large gap between the futures price and permian basin oil is called the midland differential named for the town at the center of the west texas oilfield boom
until recently firms had not hedged the discount because the price of midland oil and futures have historically tracked closely together
the market for such hedging is also less active compared with futures hedging
but at the end of the first quarter shale companies had hedged against million barrels of s production in west texas compared with just million barrels at the end of the fourth quarter according to a reuters analysis of regulatory filings
it s really becoming a more widely used phenomenon said ben montalbano petronerds who said midland hedging volume has increased tenfold in the last two years
coming into this year cimarex energy co had hedged about barrels of west texas production at a discount to benchmark futures
that means if oil futures trade at a barrel cimarex would sell oil at as opposed to companies that didn t hedge and are exposed to the entire midland discount now at
in the first quarter cimarex increased its hedge against the differential to million barrels according to the firm s filings
about half of that however was hedged at a less favorable discount of per barrel effectively selling oil at if futures are at
cimarex produced about bpd in the permian in the first quarter
the company did respond to a request for comment
with major pipelines not expected to come online until next year and production increasing analysts expect the midland differential to remain high
occidental petroleum in a recent presentation said it expects this gap to hit a barrel by the third quarter
for the first time in three years we have not had a pipeline to come on to alleviate the bottleneck said tran
some firms including apache corp and pioneer natural resources said they don t have to worry about the differential because they have reserved enough space on pipelines to transport their oil
apache said it has started to hedge its midland exposure for
pioneer does not have any such positions said rich dealt cfo
pioneer has firm transportation in place over the next few years to move nearly all of its permian basin oil production to the gulf coast for export or sale to refineries dealt said
