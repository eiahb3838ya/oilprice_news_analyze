update 1-india ministry urges duty on chinese solar cells, modules
new delhi reuters india s trade ministry on monday recommended imposing a percent duty on imports of solar cells and modules from china for one year to try to counter what it sees as a threat to domestic solar equipment manufacturing
falling prices of solar cells and modules over percent of which india imports from china have triggered a decline in the cost of solar power generation and led indians increasingly to adopt the technology
india plans to make renewable power account for percent of its total installed capacity by from percent currently
the proposed safeguard duty which would apply for two years in total to imports from china and malaysia would be reduced in the second year to percent for six months and then percent for six months
the proposed duty is less than the percent recommended by indian authorities in january
the recommendation contained in a report published by the ministry and to be submitted to the government for approval is intended to address a serious threat to the domestic solar manufacturing industry from chinese imports the directorate general of trade remedies dgtr said in the report
indian solar cell and module manufacturers said cheap chinese imports were hurting the domestic industry while chinese manufacturers say imports are helping india accelerate its renewable energy adoption program
solar module manufacturers are facing tough and unhealthy competition from imported modules the report quoted the north india module manufacturer association as saying
the china chamber of commerce for imports and exports of machinery and electronic products said the real cause of injury to the domestic industry is aggressive pricing practices of other indian producers and not trade relations between the two asian nations have thawed recently despite fears of a trade war elsewhere with the two sides discussing ways to increase indian sales of farm products and india pushing china to give access to its software service firms
however the trade deficit has widened to billion in china s favor an over increase over the last decade
india s share in china s exports of solar cells and modules rose from about a fifth in the first half of to a year later the dgtr wrote adding that china had started targeting the indian market more some indian solar power generators like avaada ltd have expressed reservations about the duties
a safeguard duty would put solar projects worth more than billion indian rupees billion under jeopardy avaada told dgtr
