update 2-china sets record daily steel output for third month in a row
daily steel output hit record mln t in june mills improved efficiency to chase bumper margins profit margins at mills can top mills race to boost output ahead of winter curbs recasts adds details throughout by muyu xu and josephine mason beijing july reuters china s steel mills churned out record amounts of the construction material in june as producers rushed to cash in on hefty margins even as a trade spat between beijing and washington intensified
china which accounts for half the world s capacity produced million tonnes of crude steel last month national bureau of statistics data showed on friday
that s just shy of the million tonnes the united states produced in the whole of according to world steel association data
june output was below may s record million tonnes but june has one less day setting a new daily average production record for a third month in a row at million tonnes according to reuters calculations
steel mills were dashing to reap as much of the bumper profits as they could despite environmental checks said richard lu analyst at cru in beijing
the data may further inflame a bitter trade row
the united states and europe have accused china of exporting its surplus metal cheap hurting international rivals
china s steel exports rose last month to million tonnes their highest since july even after washington imposed import duties to protect industries
the production increase also comes as china has shuttered some mills to help curb choking pollution and ramped up environmental inspections suggesting that newer mills have ramped up operations to cash in on fat margins
china s steel output in the first half rose percent to million tonnes
steel prices have soared over the past year due to firm demand and on concerns about tightening supplies of metal used in construction and automotives as beijing seeks to close inefficient mills and clamps down on industries to clean the nation s skies
lu estimated that mills were earning a profit margin of about yuan per tonne of steel while analysts at huatai futures put profit margins for mills in northern china at over yuan a tonne one of the highest on record
monthly utilisation rates at mills reached percent in june the highest since october before winter production curbs had taken effect according to reuters calculation based on data from mysteel consultancy
analysts say it s not clear if china will continue its run
some particularly smoggy cities and provinces are also implementing ad hoc measures to beat bouts of pollution
last week top steelmaking city tangshan ordered mills to cut production for weeks over summer
steel output may not necessarily go down even though stricter restrictions are on the way said lu
steel mills in xuzhou city could reopen soon which will to some extent offset the production curbs in producers are also racing to make as much metal as possible before a new round of production curbs are imposed in november ahead of china s winter when pollution is at its worst
last winter government forced mills and heavy industry in of the most polluted northern cities to shut up to half of their capacity between november and march
more are expected to adopt similar curbs this winter
