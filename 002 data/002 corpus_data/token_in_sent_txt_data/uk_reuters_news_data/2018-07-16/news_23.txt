update 1-global regulators start monitoring crypto assets
adds more detail by huw jones london july reuters global regulators have published a framework for vigilantly monitoring risks from crypto assets like bitcoin and ether even though they don t pose a major risk to financial stability for now
wild swings in crypto asset prices have prompted central bankers to warn investors they could lose every penny
it is unclear at times which financial rules if any apply to the sector or if there is legal authority to regulate it
start ups have begun issuing new digital currencies via initial coin offerings icos raising concern among regulators over investor protection
the aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action
the financial stability board fsb which coordinates financial regulation for the group of economies said the framework focuses on how risks from crypto asset markets could spread to other parts of the financial system
monitoring the size and growth of markets is critical to understanding the potential size of wealth effects should valuations fall the fsb said in a statement on monday
the use of leverage and financial institution exposures to markets are important metrics of transmission of risks to the broader financial the aim of the new framework is to spot any financial stability risks early enough to take action
but the fsb cautioned that data is still patchy at times in a rapidly developing market that can be fragmented and opaque
it would assess whether the framework will need extra data at a later stage
moves to formally monitor the sector forms part of a compromise in march between members like france who wanted more radical action and other countries who preferred treading lightly for now
the fsb framework also includes trading volumes pricing clearing and margining for derivatives linked to crypto assets such as the bitcoin futures launched by cme group last december
crypto assets in general and crypto asset trading platforms do not pose global financial stability risks but they raise other significant concerns including consumer and investor protection market integrity and money financing the fsb said
it said its affiliate the basel committee which writes bank capital standards is conducting an initial stocktake of banks exposures to crypto assets
the committee is also looking at whether regulators are forcing lenders to set aside capital against holdings of crypto assets and considering whether to rewrite its rules to explicitly require such holdings to be covered
