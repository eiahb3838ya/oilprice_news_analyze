update 2-china to hit more sugar imports with extra tariffs from aug 1
all sugar to incur pct duties move follows several months of losses at local mills government action came as a surprise to trade adds comment detail on impact by dominique patton and hallie gu beijing july reuters china will levy extra tariffs on sugar imports from all origins starting from the commerce ministry said on monday just over a year after introducing hefty penalties on top growers including brazil and thailand
in may last year the government hit major exporting nations with penalties on sugar shipments after years of lobbying by domestic mills
it still exempted smaller producing countries and regions mostly in southeast asia and south america like in the philippines and el salvador
that list of exempt countries has now been cancelled the commerce ministry said in a monday statement
protective measures will be uniformly applied to all sugar imports it said
china allows million tonnes of sugar imports a year at a tariff of percent as part of its commitments to the world trade organization
shipments outside of that allowance imports are charged a higher tariff and need special permits
pressured by a large global surplus and rising domestic production chinese sugar prices have plunged this year pushing most producers into the red and threatening china s efforts to support millions of small farmers in the poor southern region of guangxi and neighbouring yunnan province
industry officials recently called on the government to tighten supplies from international markets amid rising worries that large global stocks would lead to more smuggling into china
still china s move came as a surprise to most traders who had not expected a rapid response from the government
we expected them to take action but not so fast said a sugar trader with an international trading house based in shanghai
chinese white sugar futures touched a low of yuan per tonne last week a level not seen since and they are currently hovering at a low
production costs though are as much as yuan a tonne for many mills according to the trader with the international house
the new tariffs will have limited benefit to the domestic market this year said liu hande president of processor and trading company guangdong zhongqing sugar group co china has already bought up much of the sweetener available from countries that had been on the exempt list he said but added that the tariffs should support prices from next year
imports already incur a percent levy and the protective measures added an extra percent duty to those imports last year taking the total to percent
this was set to fall to percent this year and percent next year
chinese importers sharply cut shipments from top supplier brazil after the tariffs were introduced last year
they also boosted shipments from smaller producers some of which exported to china for the first time
under the new measures china could return to buying more from brazil said the trader as it still needs a certain volume of imports to meet demand each year
