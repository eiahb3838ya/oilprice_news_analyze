column-hedge funds quiet before oil-price plunge: kemp
london reuters hedge fund managers made few adjustments to their positions in the petroleum complex in the week ending on july as the market remained calm before oil prices plunged the following day
hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by just million barrels in the seven days to july
net length increased for the third week running but the rise was much smaller than in the week ending july million barrels or june million indicating the recent wave of was largely complete
portfolio managers cut net long positions in brent million barrels while adding them in nymex and ice wti million gasoline million heating oil million and european gasoil million
the previous in wti ran out of steam with fund managers adding just million barrels of net long positions compared with million and million in the two prior weeks
while crude contracts continued to come under selling pressure funds started or continued to add slightly to bullish positions in refined fuels
net length in european gasoil increased for the first time in seven weeks while heating oil and gasoline both saw bullish positions rise for the second week running
the very limited position changes in the week to july suggest most fund managers had completed adjusting their positions after a bout of on crude and fuels that began in late april
but brent positions have declined in out of the last weeks and with no new buying in wti the gentle downward pressure on prices and calendar spreads finally turned into a torrent just one day later
