explainer-how unstable is libya's oil production?
tunis reuters after a relatively stable spell libya s oil production has again because of a standoff at eastern export terminals and the abduction of two workers at the giant sharara oilfield
military clashes followed by a political power struggle forced the national oil corporation noc to halt exports at ras lanuf es sider zueitina and hariga terminals in late june and early july threatening to keep offline as much as barrels per day bpd
the ports were reopened on july and eastern fields gradually resumed operations
a lengthy shutdown at el feel oilfield in the southwest also ended but two days later output at the nearby bpd sharara was slashed after two staff were kidnapped
national production had been hovering around million bpd for more than a year and reached million bpd in february with most recent shutdowns resolved in days or weeks
but the risk of further output shocks will linger while libya remains politically and militarily divided
libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in africa and has been a key light sweet crude supplier
around it produced more than million bpd and before the uprising in which muammar gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago it was pumping more than million
last year the noc outlined plans to raise production to million bpd by but said this would need around billion of investment
foreign oil companies including italy s eni total of france austria s omv and firms conocophillips and hess have production stakes through joint ventures with the noc
since libya s uprising rival groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands
power is split between shifting armed factions in the east and west aligned with competing administrations
they and other groups have cut off production at fields and ports including a blockade of terminals in libya s eastern oil crescent from
prolonged shutdowns have reduced pressure at wells
as libya s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices demands for salaries local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread
groups including islamist militants have attacked and fought over oilfields and ports
most the storage tanks at two major terminals es sider and ras lanuf have been damaged or destroyed
fields including mabruk and ghani remain closed
a lack of funding has been an additional drag on aging infrastructure and regular power outages are a further constraint
international companies have a limited presence onshore keeping exploration and development programs mostly on hold
reasons for shutdowns include economic protests by local groups pushing for cash or the release of jailed fighters which have affected ports major fields and parts of the pipeline network
the petroleum facilities guards pfg whose job is to protect oil installations often hold local agendas and loyalties
guards shut down the el feel field this year for more than four months
security is volatile
militants including some linked to islamic state are present in desert areas and have carried out attacks near facilities or fields in the sirte basin
risk is also linked to libya s domestic conflict
in a former pfg commander who had led earlier port blockades gathered opponents of military chief khalifa haftar along with mercenaries to attack ras lanuf and es sider held by haftar s forces since
after the assault was repelled haftar and his allies said they would take control of most of libya s oil through a parallel noc in the eastern city of benghazi complaining that too many of the revenues flowing through the central bank in tripoli had been passing to their rivals
the standoff was resolved with a promise to look into central bank spending and a sanctions threat against those trying to bypass the internationally recognized noc
but the internationally recognized government of national accord gna in tripoli which announced the investigation into spending lacks authority
meanwhile efforts to unify eastern and western factions showing little visible progress and plans for elections this year are uncertain
along with nigeria libya has been exempted from production cuts designed to bolster prices
both have signaled their intention to raise output
