global markets-asian shares fall on soft china data, trade war fears
msci asia pct shanghai composite pct pct china data shows slowing growth weaker industrial output by andrew galbraith shanghai july reuters asian shares fell on monday as new data showed china s economy slowed slightly in the second quarter compounded by fears of a trade war looming over markets
official data showed china s economy grew percent in the second quarter of cooling from the percent growth registered in each of the previous three quarters
while the gdp figures were in line with market expectations the new data also showed growth in china s industrial output pointing to slowing momentum and prompting some analysts to call for stronger government measures to support growth
taken together the data show an economy continuing to slow under the influence of a crackdown on excessive financial risk even as trade war headwinds gather
but jim mccafferty head of equity research asia at nomura said china s underlying economic data appears to be quite robust
i would be incredulous if china s gdp growth could continue at the level it s been historically
so i think there s always been an anticipation of some gradual slowdown but the slowdown of the growth rate is probably less than the market really wants to believe he said
he said concerns over the trade war were dragging down markets with investors spooked by the ratcheting up of trade war tensions
that s why i think markets are nervous because there s no precedent for this type of behaviour he said
