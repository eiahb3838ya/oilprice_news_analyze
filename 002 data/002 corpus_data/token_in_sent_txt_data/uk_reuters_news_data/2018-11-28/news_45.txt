update 2-saudi arabia wants united front on oil output; russia and nigeria hold out
reuters saudi arabia will not cut oil output on its own to stabilize the market energy minister khalid said on wednesday as nigeria and russia said it is too early to signal whether they would join any production curbs
oil producer group opec and its allies led by russia meet in vienna next week against the backdrop of concerns over a slowing global economy and rising oil supplies from the united states which is not involved in an existing agreement to restrain output
the negative economic outlook helped to push oil below a barrel this week from as high as in october prompting saudi arabia the de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec to suggest significant production cuts
riyadh however has come under renewed pressure from president donald trump who asked the kingdom to refrain from output reductions and help to lower oil prices further
possibly complicating any decision on oil output is the crisis around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul last month
trump has backed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman despite calls from many politicians to impose stiff sanctions on riyadh
falih was in abuja to meet his nigerian counterpart emmanuel ibe kachikwu
the saudi minister said signals from fellow opec members iraq nigeria and libya were positive ahead of the group s talks because all ministers want to restore oil market stability

russian energy minister alexander novak met russian oil producers this week to discuss cooperation with opec two industry sources said without providing details
nigeria s kachikwu told reporters it was too early to say whether opec member nigeria would participate in any cuts but added that there was absolute resolve within the organization to stabilize the market
falih this month said that the abundant supply of oil could require opec and its allies to reduce output in
he said at the time that supply could exceed demand by as much as million barrels per day bpd or percent of global demand suggesting that opec and its allies may try to reduce production by that amount
asked on wednesday whether cuts could be deeper than million bpd falih declined to answer
nigeria and libya were excluded from the previous cuts because of production declines caused by unrest though their output has now recovered
iran was also largely exempt from cuts
