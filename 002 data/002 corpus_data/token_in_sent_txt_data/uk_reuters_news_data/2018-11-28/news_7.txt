vandals cause 8,000 barrels of oil to spill in peruvian amazon
lima reuters peru state oil company petroperu said approximately barrels of crude oil had spilled in the amazon after vandals severed the pipeline and then impeded technicians seeking to repair the damaged pipe
the pipe began to spill oil on tuesday night after sabotage by members of the mayuriaga indigenous community in the loreto region of the amazon petroperu said in a statement
the townspeople prevented us from securing the pipe to stop petroleum from spilling from the pipe said beatriz alva hart a petroperu spokeswoman in an interview with local radio station rpp
mayuriaga community leaders could not be immediately located for comment
the pipeline which transports crude from oil fields in the peruvian amazon to refinery on the pacific coast has suffered repeated attacks by vandals over the past two years
petroperu said in the statement it had previously warned authorities that the community had threatened to attack that stretch of pipeline in protest of recent municipal election results in the district
it s an issue that has nothing to do with our company alva hart said later in the radio interview
since more than barrels of petroleum have spilled from the critical peruvian oil pipeline in attacks and barrels have sprung leaks because of corrosion or operative failures data from environmental regulator oefa showed
