canada's alberta says it will buy rail cars to transport crude
ottawa nov reuters canada s province of alberta is in talks to buy rail cars to transport barrels per day of crude oil and expects a deal to conclude within weeks premier rachel notley said on wednesday
notley who says the cars are needed to help deal with a glut of oil that has slashed the price of alberta oil told a business audience in ottawa she was disappointed the federal government was not helping fund the purchase
full pipelines have stranded much of western canada s expanding crude output driving down the price refineries are willing to pay
notley has asked prime minister justin trudeau s government to help pay for additional rail capacity though alberta had not received an answer from ottawa
