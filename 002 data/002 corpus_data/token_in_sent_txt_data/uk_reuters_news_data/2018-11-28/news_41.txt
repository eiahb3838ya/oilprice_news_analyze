nigerian opposition aims to outflank buhari with regional gambit
onitsha nigeria reuters the main challenger in nigeria s election next year aims to outflank president muhammadu buhari by campaigning in a sometimes neglected part of the country where the incumbent is deeply unpopular the southeast
with a tight race in prospect a strong showing there could give atiku abubakar the votes he needs to deny buhari a former military ruler a second term as the elected leader of one of africa s most powerful nations
abubakar is targeting regional voters who are mostly members of the igbo ethnic group through his choice of a local running mate and policies designed to meet calls for autonomy
the numbers are tempting
there were million registered voters in the five states of the southeast out of million nationwide at the last election in
the number of new voters registered in the southeast has grown faster than in other regions according to electoral commission figures seen by reuters
the opposition will still need to overcome voter apathy in the southeast where people have long felt there is little point in voting since presidents tend to be northerners from the hausa ethnic group or yoruba people from the southwest
while presidential elections in nigeria are usually cast as a fight between the mainly muslim north and the predominantly christian south victory may depend on a candidate attracting votes from outside his ethnic and religious base
at this stage most analysts expect a closely fought contest on with some predicting a narrow victory for abubakar
buhari is popular across the north so it suits abubakar to target a region where the president lacks support
buhari s unpopularity in the southeast stems from his decision to send troops on to the streets last year to crack down on secessionists
the issue is sensitive
for many the deployment was a reminder of the war over biafra a breakaway nation that was predominantly igbo
around a million people died mostly from starvation and disease before central government forces prevailed and many in the southeast feel igbos have been marginalised ever since
an igbo has not been president or vice president since nigeria s most recent transition to civilian rule in
if there are votes for abubakar in the southeast he may also win support among the many igbos living elsewhere in nigeria
abubakar named peter obi a former southeastern governor as his running mate in october and proposed devolving more power to regions in a policy dubbed restructuring that promises to give states greater control over their finances
advertising hoardings for the opposition people s democratic party pdp featuring abubakar s smiling face alongside that of obi outnumber those for buhari in the southeastern cities of onitsha and enugu
chukwunonye okereke director general of southeast youths for atiku a pdp organisation said the people in the southeast have not been treated fairly by this government
he buhari has been a ruler of abubakar himself said in a tweet earlier this month i am for of nigerians of the time
nigerians should never be divided by ethnic or religious lines
we must be united
we are one the comment may have struck a chord in the southeast since it reflects criticism that buhari has governed as a northern president concerned only with northern people
a group of influential igbo traditional rulers earlier this month endorsed abubakar a move that gives them potential access to important patronage networks if he wins
buhari is unpopular among market stallholders and shoppers in onitsha the biggest city in anambra state
i don t want buhari any longer in this country
we pray there will be a change said ifeoma eze who runs a business selling plantains
in nigeria everybody is crying there is no money
the money is not circulating she said complaining about the government s handling of the economy which experienced its first recession in years in only emerging last year
eric onyeka who runs a toiletries stall said we have had economic instability since the year buhari took office
buhari s supporters say much criticism is based on ethnic and religious prejudices rather than his policies
the current infrastructure that has been put in place surpasses what the people s democratic party did in years said ebubeagu okafor a spokesman for buhari s all progressives congress apc in enugu
he said buhari s administration had improved roads between the region s major cities and was developing a railway line to link the southeast with the oil heartland and the northeast
okafor also cited the resumption of building work on the second niger bridge a major river crossing as an example of buhari s commitment to the region
abubakar is thought to be betting that buhari s largesse may not be enough to win the region
atiku is probably banking on a growing voter population in these traditional pdp strongholds combined with a higher turnout of igbo voters who want to see an igbo vice president said malte liewerscheidt west africa analyst at teneo a consultancy
liewerscheidt also said abubakar s courting of the igbo vote could help him elsewhere
igbo support could also prove decisive in other regions particularly the southwest as there are huge igbo communities scattered across the country
in a key battleground state such as lagos this could swing the vote in atiku s favour he said
