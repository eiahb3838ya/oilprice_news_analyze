update 1-eu's climate chief calls for net-zero emissions by 2050
brussels reuters the european union s climate chief called for the bloc to take the lead and aim for greenhouse gas emissions by in its climate strategy published on wednesday ahead of key talks on curbing global warming
as president donald trump pulls the united states out of the paris climate accord european commission climate chief miguel arias canete said the bloc had to lead by example at next week s climate talks in poland
the eu executive published its strategy on wednesday setting out eight pathways to reducing emissions two of which chart a course for europe to becoming climate neutral by absorbing as much greenhouse gas as it emits
it s worth becoming the first major economy to fully decarbonise to fully reach net zero emissions canete told reuters on tuesday
it will require lots of effort but it is under a package of climate legislation adopted since the paris agreement on containing global warming the eu is on track to overshoot its pledge to reduce emissions by percent from levels by
new targets on energy saving renewables and transport emissions have helped set the bloc on course to cut emissions by percent by and percent by
that s okay but we need to do more canete said arguing that investment in clean energy would help grow the economy and save money on fossil fuel imports
upcoming talks are the most important since the paris agreement with delegates from nations set to haggle over the details of the pact which washington has said it will quit
the pact aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to degrees celsius to avert more extreme weather rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species
by publishing its ambitious plan eu officials hope to pull more weight at what are expected to be tough talks amid division among world powers
the role of the united states is less relevant and that puts more burden on our shoulders canete said
it will not be an easy conference but the european union arrives with lots of while trump rejects projections that climate change will cause severe economic harm a report detailing the dangers last month has spurred ministers from some eu nations to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned
however european governments are also divided over how to strike a balance between climate policy and protecting sectors such as automakers and coal mining
some including economic powerhouse germany are struggling to meet their targets
all of the pathways presented on wednesday chart a rise in electricity consumption but some rely more heavily on storage while others more on alternative fuels like hydrogen
in five scenarios the eu responsible for some percent of global greenhouse gas emissions achieves reductions of about percent by compared to some sectors like agriculture still account for high emissions
to achieve net negative emissions the bloc will have to invest more in carbon capture and sustainable advanced biofuels but also encourage consumers to change their habits the eu s modelling shows
the european commission hopes that the publication of its strategy will inspire national governments to greater ambition when they draft their own plans by the end of for meeting the bloc s current climate goals
