climate change 'biggest global health threat' of century, doctors warn
london nov thomson reuters foundation rising heat and wilder weather linked to climate change make it the biggest global health threat of the century with hundreds of millions more people already suffering in the last two decades medical officials warned wednesday
in a report published by the lancet medical journal scientists and health experts said climate change impacts from heatwaves to worsening storms floods and fires were surging and threatened to overwhelm health systems
that s the thing that really keeps me up at night said nick watts executive director of the lancet countdown an annual report tracking connections between public health and climate change
storms and floods for instance do not only cause direct injuries but can also shut down hospitals spur disease outbreaks and produce lingering mental health problems as people lose their homes he said
wildfires similarly hurt and uproot people but also dramatically worsen air pollution in broad areas
california s recent wildfires spurred by drought have cost more than lives but have also polluted air as far east as massachusetts said gina mccarthy a former head of the environmental protection agency now at harvard university s public health school
kristie ebi a professor of global health at the university of washington said multiple climate health impacts were often hitting at once
we see them coming at communities all at the same time she said
the lancet report produced by doctors academics and policy experts from organisations around the world called for fast action to curb climate change and prepare global health systems for growing challenges
a rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather altering patterns of infectious disease and compromising food security safe drinking water and clean air it warned
already million more people worldwide were exposed to heatwaves last year than in according to the report
hotter weather led to the loss of billion hours of labour in a percent jump from as workers in construction farming and other industries downed tools often squeezing family income
in india heat caused the number of hours worked to fall by almost percent in watts said
richer countries also are seeing the effects of heat the report noted
europe and the eastern mediterranean for instance appear more vulnerable than africa and southeast asia it said
that is largely because so many older people who are particularly at risk live in cities which trap heat and can be hotter than surrounding areas the report said
england and wales for instance saw more deaths than normal during a hot spell in june and july this year watts said
renee salas an emergency room doctor at massachusetts general hospital in the united states and an author of the report said she recently treated a man felled by heatstroke while trying to work two construction jobs
keep in mind that for every statistic there is a personal story she urged
such medical cases are the often hidden human cost of climate change she added
warmer conditions linked to climate change are enlarging the potential range of diseases such as dengue fever as well as other health threats the report said
since the baltic region has seen a increase in coastal areas suitable for cholera outbreaks while in africa s highlands zones where mosquitoes can survive have expanded by percent
hotter conditions may also be giving some microbes greater resistance to antibiotics salas said
and higher temperatures seem to be curbing the maximum harvest from farmland in all regions of the world reversing an earlier trend toward harvests the report noted
ebi of the university of washington said rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are shrinking nutrients in cereal crops hiking the risk of malnutrition even for those who get enough to eat
mental health threats meanwhile from children worried about their future in an overheating world to families stressed by disaster losses are on the rise she said
acting swiftly to curb climate change whether by switching to clean energy or getting more people to walk and use bicycles would lower healthcare costs by the same amount of money needed to reduce emissions ebi said
most mitigation policies are good for health and they good for health now she said
