refile-analysis-dismantling the oil industry: rough north sea waters test new ideas
this story has been refiled to correct spelling of surname of oil and gas uk decommissioning manager
by shadia nasralla london reuters scottish marine salvage group ardent is adapting the tanksit used to refloat the costa concordia the cruise ship wrecked off the italian coast in to decommission north sea oil platforms
it is one of several companies trying new ideas to win business in the market for dismantling disused oil platforms
in britain aging oil fields alone the opportunities could be worth up to billion pounds billion before according to industry body oil and gas uk
the ideas could then be deployed to other maturing fields such as in the gulf of mexico and southeast offshore decommissioning ardent says it needs at least two companies to sign up for a project to get off the ground
another company offering a new approach also needs several operators to commit
so far ardent has found it challenging to persuade companies to be the first to sign up
everyone is queuing to be second said ardent s decommissioning director stuart martin
oil companies are keen to reduce costs in a part of the market dominated by major global players such as technipfmc schlumberger saipem and allseas
beyond the floating tanks ardent has also joined forces with oil services firm worleyparsons and technology and shipping group lloyd s register to bring a service
this could save money by cutting out the need for lots of different contractors
proposes coordinating decommissioning work across companies to share equipment and staff
you got to give and the others a real tip of the hat
we all want them to win
it s in the best interest of the industry said jim house ceo of neptune energy which is planning decommissioning for its juliet and minke fields in the north sea
oil platforms are usually removed piece by piece and taken to the shore using complex vessels
the floating tanks that ardent used to lift the costa concordia are much cheaper to use industry experts say
this technology could have significant potential cost efficiencies the oil and gas technology centre which is funded by the british government said in a report
but ardent says it would need contracts for at least two buoyant tanks to go below current costs per tonne of steel removed and three to get below its target cost reduction of around a third
britain s industry regulator the oil and gas authority has set a target of percent cost cuts compared with levels
s main lever for cost reduction also depends on several operators committing to contracts
ardent is also proposing to oversee a project from production to scrapping the metal onshore
worley parsons would operate the platform and maintain the equipment and lloyd s register would plug the wells
it s a lot about an emerging set of companies and we don t yet know which is going to be the winning model said boston consulting group s philip whittaker
one of the biggest sources of value is how to integrate the decom work with the final stages of the production graphic cost of ardent projects graphic uk north sea decommissioning spending with other fields maturing and drying up across the worldand some experts expecting demand for oil to peak in the the north sea is a test bed for new decommissioning projects
if a company can plug oil wells without leaks and remove thousands of tonnes of steel platforms and pipelines some old in the rough deep seas between scotland england and norway they should be able to do it anywhere
industry body oil and gas uk expects oil companies to billion pounds billion on removing around platforms and km of pipelines in the next seven years
some tonnes of material will be returned to shore to meet environmental regulations
we ve got a mature basin with a steady flow of work said joe leask decommissioning manager at oil and gas uk
those resources and expertise can be exportable the gulf of mexico has had decommissioning projects in its warm calm waters for years but southeast asia is a new hot spot with more than platforms and subsea wells expected to be uneconomical by according to the bcg
that is followed by latin america west africa and the middle east future decommissioning hotspots with so much potential more established players are also trying different approaches to make decommissioning cheaper
service vessel group allseas is experimenting with new ideas
it specializes in subsea construction but is converting huge ships to lift structures as heavy as tonnes in one haul
we lift in a matter of hours and we re gone said allseas president edward heerema
the first job for allseas pioneering spirit the biggest construction vessel in the world was in the norwegian north sea removing repsol s tonne yme production unit
shell also used it to remove its tonne brent delta platform in
we have taken substantial costs out of our major decommissioning project the brent and we will continue to do so said steve phimister head of shell s north sea upstream
the whole industry needs to do that by editing by anna willard
