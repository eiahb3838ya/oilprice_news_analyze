iran halts gas exports to iraq for pipeline repairs -ministry
baghdad nov reuters gas exports from iran to iraq were halted late on tuesday for several days as iranian authorities work to repair damages caused to the pipeline during a recent earthquake
the cuts deprive iraq s power grid of megawatts mw iraq s electricity ministry said in a statement as iraq relies heavily on iranian gas to feed its power stations
iranian authorities informed the electricity ministry in baghdad that the flow of gas exports will be resumed during next few days after maintenance on the pipeline inside iranian territory are completed
the pipeline supplies several major power stations including two in eastern baghdad and one in eastern diyala province near the iranian border the ministry said
the oil ministry will supply the power stations which have been affected by the halt with fuel to keep operations going the ministry said
however both provinces can expect power cuts as a result the ministry said
iran which has large gas reserves alongside its oil resources exports small amounts of gas to turkey but production has struggled to keep pace with rising domestic consumption
the united states said earlier this month that iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from iran for a period of days as long as iraq does not pay iran in dollars
sanctions on tehran s oil sector took effect on
baghdad is seeking to renew and extend the exemption as it needs more time to find an alternative source iraqi officials said
