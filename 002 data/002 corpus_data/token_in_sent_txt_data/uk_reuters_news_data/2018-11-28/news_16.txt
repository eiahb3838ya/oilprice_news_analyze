update 2-orsted to invest $30 billion in green energy by 2025
copenhagen reuters denmark s orsted will invest billion in green energy up to it said on wednesday as it seeks to become one of a handful of future renewable majors leading a global transition from fossil fuels to green energy
while renewable energy technology is now able to compete with traditional power sources the industry remains vulnerable to changing political winds as governments around the world scramble on how to address climate change
orsted the world s largest offshore wind developer said it would have gigawatts gw of offshore wind power capacity by up from a previous target of gw and plans to further double capacity by to more than gw
one of the key drivers will be expansion in the nascent market where it recently made two acquisitions to gain a foothold in both onshore and offshore wind
president donald trump has blasted renewable energy as expensive accused wind turbines of killing birds and ruining landscapes while vowing to revive the coal industry
while trump this week rejected projections from his own government that climate change will cause severe economic harm many states have set ambitious targets to source energy from sources
however so far the impact on orsted s business has not been negative its chief told reuters
it has been quite positive under this administration thomas brostrom said pointing to efforts to remove red tape around environmental approvals and new auctions for acreage
he said the efforts were driven more by consideration for energy independency and job creation rather than reducing carbon emissions
orsted is also betting big on growing in taiwan which with a big push to attract investments in renewable technology has become a key battleground for the world s top offshore wind developers seeking a foothold in asia
however orsted acknowledged that offshore wind projects in taiwan could face delays after voters last week decided against a government plan to abolish nuclear power
the vote prompted taiwan to scrap its target of having no nuclear power by and to review its energy policy which since has been driven by the fukushima nuclear accident
before the vote the island s offshore wind market was expected to expand to gw by with government investments into onshore and offshore wind of billion
it was not a vote to stop the nuclear senior vice president at orsted thyge boserup said
i think it s rather the speed of the that is up for discussion he said
