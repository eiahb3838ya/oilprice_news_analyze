gasum to create finland's second largest biogas plant by late 2019
oslo nov reuters finnish gas firm gasum plans to expand the processing capacity of its biogas plant in the city of turku making it the second largest such facility in the country the firm said on wednesday
as a result of the expansion which is scheduled to be completed by september the plant will be able to produce some gigawatt hours gwh of biogas annually gasum said around double its current levels
increasing the production of biogas for use in business and transport is one of finland s energy and climate policy goals as it seeks to gradually phase out the use of coal
ari suomilammi gasum s biomas production director told reuters that the total expansion including investment for a liquefaction facility would cost about million euros
the project will allow the turku plant which is currently processing waste and sewage to produce a higher concentration of biogas which generates power and heating when burned
the plant is currently able to process about tonnes of organic waste
from september its capacity will be as high as tonnes
this is a big step forward towards our goal of a society and nutrient recycling a genuine circular economy solution gasum said in a statement
gasum owns twelve biogas plants across finland and expanded production in sweden with the acquisition of swedish biogas international a year ago a move that made it the biggest biogas producer in the nordics
in october gasum started delivering liquefied biogas lbg a renewable version of liquefied natural gas lng to finnish customers
