britain eyes large-scale co2 capture and use by mid 2020s
london reuters britain plans to help develop the country s first project to capture store and use carbon dioxide emissions by the the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis said on wednesday
carbon capture storage and use ccsu involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be compressed and stored to be used for industrial applications such as making drinks fizzy
the technology is also likely to be needed to help limit a rise in global temperatures at degrees celsius according to a recent report
the uk s first carbon capture usage and storage project will be up and running by the under government plans unveiled today beis said in a statement
under the plans britain will commit to setting out more details next year on how to develop the country s first large scale ccsu project and invest million pounds million in decarbonising industrial sites
the uk is setting a ambition for developing and deploying carbon capture and storage technology to cut emissions britain s energy and clean growth minister claire perry will say later on wednesday at a ccsu conference in edinburgh according to the beis statement
british power company drax earlier this week announced a pilot ccsu scheme at its biomass power plant in north yorkshire but britain has yet to develop a economically viable project
britain had previously viewed carbon capture and storage as a vital tool to help it meet its legally binding target to cut emissions by percent on levels by
in the government launched a billion pound competition to help fund a project to capture emissions from a gas or power plant and store them underground
despite several interested companies such as shell and sse it then made a shock decision in to pull funding from the scheme leaving the projects in limbo
there are fewer than ccsu projects in operation globally but many more will be needed to meet the challenge of climate change according to the international energy agency iea
without ccus as part of the solution reaching our international climate goals is practically impossible iea executive director fatih birol said in a separate statement issued ahead of the edinburgh conference
the paris climate agreement adopted by almost nations in set a goal of limiting warming to well below a rise of degrees celsius above times while pursuing efforts for the tougher goal of degrees celsius
