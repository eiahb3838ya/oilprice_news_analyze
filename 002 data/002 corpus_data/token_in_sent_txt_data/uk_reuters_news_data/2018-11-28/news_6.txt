interview-bp sees brazil's new biofuels policy boosting investment
sao paulo reuters brazil s latest policy to boost biofuels use has improved the outlook for ethanol production and should attract new investment in plants bp plc s chief executive for biofuels mario lindenhayn said on wednesday
brazil is advancing with additional regulation for the policy called renovabio and expected to be enacted in lindenhayn said adding that he does not see signs that the government of jair bolsonaro which kicks off in january would put up obstacles
we are very positive
this is a very important signal the country is giving creating a stable regulatory environment that will allow companies to invest lindenhayn told reuters on the sidelines of an energy presentation at the company s corporate office in sao paulo
renovabio will mandate fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell
the programme aims to double the use of ethanol by from around billion litres currently
the programme also targets increases for other renewables such as biodiesel
bp has three ethanol mills in brazil crushing million tonnes of sugar cane per year
it formed a venture last year with brazil s copersucar a leading global ethanol seller to jointly operate one of the largest fuel terminals in the country located in paul√≠nia in sao paulo state
lindenhayn said the programme provides an opportunity for mills in brazil which have experienced stagnation caused by years of low sugar prices and a long period of subsidized gasoline prices that led to the closure of many firms
if the programme advances as planned it will be a large opportunity
there are no greenfield projects around and the country is a net fuel importer he said
asked if bp would be interested in increasing ethanol capacity via acquisitions since there are several assets being offered in brazil by companies with financial difficulties lindenhayn said we will see we will on wednesday brazilian oil and fuels regulator anp published in the official gazette another part of renovabio complementary legislation with rules for biofuel companies to obtain certification
with that the plants will be able to issue and trade emissions reductions credits called cbios that fuel distributors could buy to comply with targets in case they fall short
it would be brazil s first emissions reductions market although limited to the fuels industry
