interview-big indian insurer bets on oil marketing companies for 2019
mumbai nov reuters india s aditya birla sun life insurance absli plans to increase its holdings in oil marketing companies as crude prices come under pressure and valuations in the sector turn attractive ahead of general elections next year
i think over the last five years we ve seen a huge of these stocks and a very sharp correction as we approach the elections deven sangoi chief investment officer for equities at absli the life insurance arm of aditya birla capital told reuters
the s p bse oil and gas index has lost more than percent of its value since it touched a record high of in november last year
oil prices have slumped by more than percent since early october pressured by concerns supply will exceed demand in as economic growth slows
with inventories rising it slipped to below a barrel on wednesday
sangoi said he expected oil prices to remain between a barrel
oil might even drop to a barrel if there is a demand shock due to a global growth slump he added potentially giving a boost to oil marketing companies margins
if this oil call goes right then i think oil marketing companies are a value said sangoi who manages about billion rupees billion in equities out of absli s billion rupees of assets under management
indian oil corp hindustan petroleum corp and bharat petroleum corp are among the top oil marketing companies in india
sangoi s bet also hinges on the outcome of national elections due by may
he said the current government had let oil marketing companies maintain their margins during a period of rising crude prices by passing the cost to consumers
opinion polls show prime minister narendra modi remains the front runner to win another term but his bharatiya janata party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition
markets are looking now for cues from five key state elections in the next few weeks
if the modi government comes back then this sector will just go through the roof sangoi said
he is also betting on power generating companies next year as a pick up in economic growth boosts demand for energy
i m a very firm believer that there is going to be very high growth in energy consumption if we continue to grow at percent sangoi said
an increase in tariffs by the regulator and better capacity utilisation at power plants should also help these firms he said
elsewhere sangoi said he expected private sector banks especially those with corporate clients to benefit next year as financial firms suffer from an ongoing credit crisis and bad loans which have plagued lenders continue to dwindle
