i urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft fayad said on twitter
apart from being illegal it puts your life and those of your families at the ruptured pipeline was near the tula refinery of state oil firm petroleos mexicanos pemex which in a statement blamed the incident on an illegal tap
