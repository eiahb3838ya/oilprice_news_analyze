venezuela opposition will name new citgo board this week -wsj
washington reuters venezuela s interim president juan guaido will name a new board for citgo petroleum corp this week republican
senator marco rubio told the wall street journal on wednesday
citgo the refiner and owned by venezuelan state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa is venezuela s top foreign asset
but the united states has imposed sanctions on pdvsa as part of washington s bid to pressure venezuelan president nicolas maduro to step down after he was last year in a vote critics have called a sham
the actions have in turn squeezed citgo
venezuela s opposition said on wednesday it would use income accrued by citgo since last month to finance its efforts to dislodge maduro
the interim president is going to name a new governance board very soon here probably as early as today or tomorrow and that ll be recognised under law rubio said in an interview with the journal
rubio added that the united states would then recognise that board as the legal entity controlling citgo
it was not immediately clear how rubio received that information
representatives for rubio citgo the white house and carlos vecchio the representative for guaido did not immediately respond to requests for comments
pdvsa has said it would use legal manoeuvres to block a takeover of citgo
washington has recognised guaido an opposition leader and head of venezuela s national assembly as the interim president of venezuela
other countries have followed suit
but maduro who denounces guaido as a puppet seeking to foment a coup against him has retained control of the state and still counts on support from russia and china
