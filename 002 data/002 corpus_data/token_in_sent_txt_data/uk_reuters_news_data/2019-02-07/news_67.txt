california utility pg&e vows more power shutdowns to prevent wildfire
sacramento reuters california utility pg e corp plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present
in a report to state regulators pg e said it would also remove trees near electricity lines trim vegetation over square miles square km and conduct thousands of inspections to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires
pg e is under intense scrutiny for its role in sparking more than a dozen wildfires over the past two years
it filed bankruptcy last month citing anticipated liabilities including the possibility its equipment set off november s deadly camp fire which destroyed the northern california town of paradise and killed people
the san utility which serves million customers said it would increase nearly tenfold its efforts to turn off the power to communities threatened by wildfire increasing the number of households and businesses potentially affected by blackouts in to million
such shutoffs were also used last year to keep live electricity in the lines from setting off a fire when high winds and heat hit extreme levels and nearby brush or trees could be ignited
mark toney who directs the utility consumer advocacy group the utility reform network turn said shutting off power would harm vulnerable people including those who rely on electricity to power medical equipment
the fact that there is such a dramatic expansion of power shutoffs as a strategy to stop wildfires is a sign of pg e s failure and mismanagement when it comes to trimming the trees and taking care of the grid he said
pg e spokeswoman kristi jourdan said the company would only turn off the power to a community as a last resort to keep people safe
we understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects the operation of critical facilities communications systems and much more she said
the company is also on probation in relation to a criminal conviction in the deadly explosion of one of its natural gas lines in the city of san bruno near san francisco
the judge in that case said he would consider the company s wildfire plan in deciding whether pg e should do more to prevent wildfire
california law requires all utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans annually
