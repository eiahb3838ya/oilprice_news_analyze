update 2-u.s. lng export plants to ramp up natgas use as gulf coast fog clears
adds genscape comment feb reuters natural gas flows to liquefied natural gas export terminals were expected to increase in coming days after collapsing to their lowest level in almost a year as fog clears along the gulf coast according to analysts and data from refinitiv
analysts said the drop was due to maintenance work at the lng terminals and the pipelines feeding them and fog which forced several vessels to drop anchor in the gulf of mexico
now that the fog is clearing the tankers are starting to move according to refinitiv s shipping data
there are three lng export terminals in the united states cheniere energy inc s sabine pass in louisiana and corpus christi in texas and dominion energy inc s cove point in maryland
those three pulled just billion cubic feet per day of gas from pipelines on thursday down from a record bcfd on according to refinitiv
one billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million homes for a day
that was the lowest amount of gas going to the lng terminals since late february
most of the pipeline flow declines were at sabine which dropped from a record bcfd in early january to bcfd on thursday with most of that decrease in february according to refinitiv
heavy fog high winds and rough seas have been occurring along the gulf coast since and many ports are experiencing traffic suspensions due to the weather conditions said rishi iyengar senior analyst natural gas markets at ihs markit s opis pointlogic
with vessel traffic at a standstill liquefaction activity appears to have been ramped down drastically iyengar said
in a notice to customers sabine pilots said they expect to resume work on thursday after suspending service from due to fog
those suspensions left seven lng tankers stuck in the gulf of mexico according to refinitiv s map
cheniere said it does not comment on operations
flows into corpus meanwhile dropped to near nothing since reaching bcfd in
energy data provider genscape said deliveries to corpus are starting to recover after a outage
while we aren t sure the reason for the corpus shutdown it s not uncommon for lng facilities to shut shortly after they begin service genscape said
corpus started up in december
flows into cove point meanwhile have mostly held around bcfd since november according to refinitiv
