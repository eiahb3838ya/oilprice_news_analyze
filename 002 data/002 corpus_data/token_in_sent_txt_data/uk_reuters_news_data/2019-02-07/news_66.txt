shares in the company fell nearly percent in a broader market that was up percent
the firm on thursday abandoned its target to and halved its target for the year to june to a million million taking into account the extra spending on its coal fleet
that spending comes after breakdowns at a number of plants including agl s loy yang recently led to blackouts as supply was unable to meet soaring cooling demand amid a brutal heatwave in southeastern australia

there is no question that policy and regulatory uncertainty is contributing to delays in both executing and approving projects he said
