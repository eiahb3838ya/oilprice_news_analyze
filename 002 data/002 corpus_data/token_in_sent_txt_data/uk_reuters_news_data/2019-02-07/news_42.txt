no plans to review gas fracking rules - british government
london reuters britain s government has no plans to review regulations for fracking gas in the country it said on thursday following calls from industry to revisit the rules
chemical giant ineos and fracking firm cuadrilla earlier this week said current restrictions around seismic events at fracking sites could force the industry to close
under the traffic light system fracking must be paused for hours following any seismic event of magnitude or above something which forced cuadrilla to halt its operations several times last year
we set these regulations in consultation with industry and we have no plans to review them a spokesman for the department for business energy and industrial strategy said in an email
the government however said it still believes shale gas could be an important energy source for the country and the industry could generate economic benefits and well paid jobs
cuadrilla said this week its test drilling in northwest england showed a rich reservoir of high quality and recoverable gas
environmentalists have campaigned against fracking saying extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with britain s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
they have also raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination
