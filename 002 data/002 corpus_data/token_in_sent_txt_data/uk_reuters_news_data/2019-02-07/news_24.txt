after air strikes in chad, france warns citizens to be vigilant
paris reuters france warned its citizens in chad on thursday to be extra vigilant after its fighter jets struck a rebel convoy that crossed last week from southern libya aiming to destabilise president idriss deby
french warplanes destroyed about trucks in a third day of air strikes on wednesday after deby asked paris for support
france sees him as key to a wider regional fight against islamist militants
given the air operations which the french military are carrying out in northeast chad and to prevent any malicious act against them french nationals are urged to be more vigilant the embassy said in a message to its citizens in chad
the strikes which started on sunday come as chadian rebels have increased their activities in southern libya since vowing last year to overthrow deby
the union of forces of resistance ufr a rebel chadian coalition created in after almost toppling deby has said it was behind this week s incursion which saw some trucks drive almost unopposed more than km miles into chadian territory
bombings are continuing today
several dozen vehicles have been destroyed and there are many seriously wounded a senior ufr official told reuters declining to say how many had died
we will not return to libya
we will wage war inside army spokesman patrik steiger said there had been no french air strikes on thursday and the military was assessing the state and intentions of the convoy
a statement after a chad government meeting said deby had informed ministers the column of mercenaries had been completely destroyed
deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in in a military coup
international observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office since and last year he pushed through constitutional reforms that could keep him in office until
france intervened in to stop the ufr toppling deby but president emmanuel macron has said he wants a new relationship with france s former colonies and the era of propping up leaders is over
however france considers its former colony as vital in the fight against islamist militants in west africa and based its operation barkhane force in the capital n djamena the incursion which chadian troops had initially attempted to stop underscores how deby s fight against islamist militants in the region has strained his military and hit the economy leading to growing dissatisfaction in one of the world s poorest nations
