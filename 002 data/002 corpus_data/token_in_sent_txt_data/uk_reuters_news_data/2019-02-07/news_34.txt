hungary calls on u.s. to spur exxon gas project in black sea
budapest reuters the united states could help hungary diversify away from russian energy by encouraging exxonmobil to proceed with plans to develop the gas field in the black sea hungary s foreign minister said
foreign minister peter szijjarto discussed diversification of hungary s natural gas imports with secretary of energy rick perry on wednesday the ministry said on thursday
he asked perry to do what he could to facilitate the start of production from which is controlled by exxon and romania s petrom a subsidiary of austrian firm omv
discovered off romania in with estimated gas reserves of trillion cubic feet the companies have since sought greater clarity from romanian authorities before developing the field
exxon said in january it was continuing to evaluate the project pinning its final investment decision on factors including competitive and stable fiscal terms for existing offshore concessions for the duration of the omv chief executive rainer seele said on wednesday that the company was in dialogue with the romanian government over the project which is expected to cost a billion euros
szijjarto said it was in hungary s strategic interest that the consortium make the investment required to produce the gas and that hungary has access to this new source of energy
hungary could import the gas via a pipeline romania is building from the black sea through an interconnector between the two countries which will be capable of handling reverse flows szijjarto was quoted by the ministry as saying
in november perry called on hungary and its neighbors to reject russian gas pipelines which washington says are being used to cement moscow s grip on central and eastern europe
hungary gets most of its gas from russia and russian firm rosatom is involved in a expansion of hungary s paks nuclear power plant the country s main domestic source of electricity
last year hungary agreed to buy billion cubic meters of natural gas from russia in
