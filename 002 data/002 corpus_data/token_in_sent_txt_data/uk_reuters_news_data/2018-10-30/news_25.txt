column-oil prices fall as economic outlook deteriorates: kemp

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london oct reuters global economic momentum is decelerating according to a broad range of financial and indicators which is weighing on worldwide equity markets and oil prices
the depth and duration of the slowdown is impossible to gauge at this point whether it turns out to be simply a mild and soft patch a longer but still positive growth recession with output falling relative to trend or an outright recession with activity falling in absolute terms
recent declines in equity markets and softness in freight indicators may turn out to be a false alarm or a pause within an extended cycle rather than mark a cyclical turning point
most commentary about the economic cycle is still influenced by the last deep and wrenching recession which accompanied the global financial crisis in
but severe recessions have not been common since the end of the second world war and most downturns have proved milder which therefore seems a more likely prediction for the next cyclical slowdown
in the united states recessions have tended to be short lasting less than a year in most instances and in some cases have seen business activity level off rather than decline
if the economy is nearing a cyclical peak however the next stage in the cyclical sequence is likely to involve some combination of fiscal expansion financial easing lower trade tensions lower oil prices further tax cuts or an increase in government spending possibly on highways and other infrastructure would be one way to ameliorate the slowdown and get the economy growing again
the federal government is already on course to run an annual budget deficit of more than trillion by the end of the decade but the prospect of even higher deficits is unlikely to forestall demands for fiscal stimulus
if the expansion slows or tips into recession the federal reserve will also come under pressure to cancel planned interest rate increases and rescind some of the rises that have already happened
with the target federal funds rate currently at percent up from a low of percent the central bank has scope to ease financial conditions by conventional interest rate reductions
in the event of a mild slowdown interest rate reductions on their own are likely to prove sufficient but if more aggressive measures are required the central bank could start expanding its balance sheet again
slower growth will lead to pressure on policymakers to reconsider trade policies that have disrupted global supply chains and damaged market access
the trump administration has argued the strength of the economy makes now an opportune time to tackle what it calls china s unfair trade and investment practices
a strong domestic economy can weather the pain of a trade war to protect strategic advantages according to this argument
but if the economic expansion falters the administration is likely to come under pressure to reconsider the costs and benefits of its aggressive trade policies
at a minimum the administration is likely to come under pressure not to worsen the downturn by escalating the trade war and to find ways to reduce tensions
if there is a downturn the administration will want it to be over well before the next presidential election in november
any slowdown in global growth is likely to see oil prices hit a plateau or even fall as consumption growth moderates while production continues to accelerate
lower oil prices would avoid another period of oversupply by curbing the projected expansion in output and stimulating faster growth in oil consumption
modestly lower oil prices would also provide some economic stimulus and form part of the natural cyclical progression a sharp fall in prices would worsen the economic outlook by curbing oil and gas investment
opec members could try to support oil prices by cutting their own output perhaps in conjunction with invited producers but only at the risk of losing market share again
attempting to support oil prices during an economic slowdown is unlikely to be successful so the most opec may be able to achieve is to avoid a rise in inventories and averting a price collapse
the precise mix of fiscal expansion financial easing reduced trade tensions and lower oil prices in the next stage of the cycle is impossible to predict in advance
but the potential for a cyclical slowdown and flat or lower oil prices is one reason hedge funds and other money managers have been cutting bullish bets on oil and refined fuels sharply since the end of august
