update 1-turkish ship to drill for oil and gas in mediterranean -minister
antalya turkey reuters a turkish ship will start drilling for oil and gas in the mediterranean on wednesday energy minister fatih donmez said a move that could create tensions with neighbouring cyprus and greece over jurisdiction
attempts to tap gas and oil in the eastern mediterranean along with a dispute over greece s maritime borders have recently caused friction between athens and ankara
turkey and the internationally recognised greek cypriot government in cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern mediterranean a region thought to be rich in natural gas
speaking at a ceremony for the launch of the drilling ship fatih donmez said it would begin drilling at the borehole located kilometres miles off the southern province of antalya and kilometres off antalya s alanya district
turkey has set its main goal as independence in energy donmez said
we don t have an eye on others resources our only issue is to present to our people the riches within our the first borehole will be some distance from the disputed territory which lies further south and around cyprus
turkey is almost completely reliant on imports to meet its energy needs and the lira s tumble against the dollar this year has driven up that cost putting pressure on energy companies to raise prices for consumers
to meet more of its needs domestically turkey recently announced a tender for operation rights of three new solar power plants and privatised seven coal fields
it also opened a new refinery to reduce dependence on imported oil products
donmez said on tuesday that turkey was also very close to buying another drilling ship
turkey warned greece last week to stay out of its activities in the eastern mediterranean heralding a potential showdown with cyprus
breakaway north cyprus which is supported by turkey says any offshore wealth also belongs to them as partners in the establishment of the cyprus republic in
greek cypriots who run the island s internationally recognised government say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all cypriots
the island was split in after a turkish invasion triggered by a brief coup
countless peacemaking endeavours have failed and offshore wealth has increasingly complicated peace negotiations even though greek cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion
