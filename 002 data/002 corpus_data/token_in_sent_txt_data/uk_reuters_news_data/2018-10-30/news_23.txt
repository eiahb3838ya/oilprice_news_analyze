reuters summit-vitol sees oil prices falling as demand growth falters
london reuters oil prices will likely fall next year as demand is curbed by trade wars and weakness in emerging market economies the world s biggest oil trader vitol predicted on tuesday
chief executive russell hardy told the reuters commodities summit that vitol had revised down its forecast for oil demand growth next year to million barrels per day bpd from million previously
it also cut this year s forecast to million from million
we have never been
we have always had an expectation that high prices would dent demand hardy said in his first interview since becoming ceo in march
crude markets are not that tight in the immediate term and a fair price of oil going into next year is probably closer to the or per barrel mark than the area that some people are talking oil prices jumped above per barrel earlier this month on fears of a steep decline in iranian supply as sanctions on tehran come into force on
hardy said he saw iranian oil exports declining but not as sharply as previously feared probably sticking above million bpd because china india and turkey were likely to continue buying crude from tehran
combined with softer demand this should help keep the oil market in balance for the first half of next year provided saudi arabia pumped near volumes and the world avoided another major supply disruption hardy said
there s not much room for things to go wrong in any supply sense because there is pretty much no spare capacity at the moment he said
a potential worsening of the environment represents a risk to the downside
if demand worsened further it could add downward pressure on prices because it would come just as the united states adds more oil to the market in the second half of
however the second part of would also see the market switching focus to tighter marine fuel rules coming into force in which are expected to give a major boost to diesel demand said hardy
the market is going to forgive oversupply based on a view of increased demand for distillates in he said
hardy also said he thought opec was unlikely to add supply to the market at its next meeting in december despite calls from president donald trump to help bring prices down
in the end opec produces million bpd and they don t have a great deal more supply to give the market
some parties within opec are beginning to think they need to be a little bit more conservative about because of the amount of increasing production
the united states is expected to add a new wall of supply next year and those volumes would be a major driver behind vitol s own expansion in crude refined products and liquefied natural gas lng markets hardy said
we re trying to position ourselves to make sure that we re getting some of that flow and that we re participating in those exports because the is about to embark on another massive expansion of its crude oil export capacity said hardy
vitol traded over million bpd of crude and products in and hardy said the figure would edge up in
lng traded volumes for this year are expected to be around million tonnes from million in
