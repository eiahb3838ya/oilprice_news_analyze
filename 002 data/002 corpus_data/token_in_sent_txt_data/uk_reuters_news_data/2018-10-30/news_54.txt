update 1-brazil's bolsonaro backs ethanol industry, pledges partnership
adds comments context on new policy by marcelo teixeira sao paulo oct reuters jair bolsonaro backed brazil s ethanol industry and pledged to be a partner of the biofuel sector according to remarks aired on monday during an international sugar conference in sao paulo
bolsonaro who beat leftist fernando haddad in a vote on sunday said in a video that he would like to see brazil retake global leadership in ethanol production which it lost to the united states some years ago
in the past we were leaders on this front and we will once again lead certainly he said in the video presented by congressman evandro gussi who authored the bill passed in congress this year that implements brazil s new policy to boost consumption of renewable fuels called renovabio
this industry is very important
it reduces carbon emissions and from something that is ours gives energy to brazil
you can count on us we are partners on this issue bolsonaro said
gussi said he recorded the video some days ago before the vote
the renovabio program is seen by many in brazil s sugar and ethanol industry as a lifeline to mills that are in a difficult financial situation after several years of low prices for the biofuel and the sweetener
the new policy which has yet to be fully regulated by the federal government that will take power on gives fuel distributors growing targets for annual traded volumes of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel
there were doubts in the ethanol industry if bolsonaro who at one point threatened to pull out of the paris climate treaty would back the policy and go ahead with its implementation
some days before the second round of the election he did a saying that brazil would honor the treaty it has signed
