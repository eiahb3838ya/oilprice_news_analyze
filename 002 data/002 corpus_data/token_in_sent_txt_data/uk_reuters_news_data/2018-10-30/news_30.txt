global oil majors including bp total and saudi aramco want to enter india s fuel retail market attracted by growing demand for gasoil and gasoline in the world s fastest growing major economy
a license has been applied for on behalf of puma energy a downstream distribution company in which trafigura is the largest shareholder and that application is still pending trafigura said in an email
puma energy in which trafigura has a percent stake operates in countries
last year it expanded into pakistan by buying a stake in a fuel retail network
according to indian rules a company can get marketing rights for transport fuels if it has invested or proposes to invest billion rupees million in the country s oil and gas sector over a year period
last year a consortium led by russia s rosneft and including trafigura and russian fund ucp paid about billion to buy percent of india s essar oil now known as nayara energy nayara operates a barrels per day oil refinery at vadinar in western gujarat state and controls fuel stations in india
trafigura which has about a percent stake in nayara applied for a fuel retail license for puma energy about two months ago an oil ministry source said
the payment made by trafigura for the essar oil stake can not be considered an investment in india s oil and gas sector this source said
an indian oil ministry spokesman said the government was examining trafigura s request for a retail sales license
it is being examined and some information has been sought on their investment plans in the country s oil and gas sector
once they reply it will be looked into the spokesman said
the oil ministry source however said it would not be difficult for trafigura to get the license as nayara has plans to expand its vadinar refinery set up a petchem plant and increase its number of fuel retail stations to in three years
we gave a license for retail sales of petrol and diesel to bp after it made a commitment to make fresh investment in exploration after buying a stake in indian oil and gas blocks from reliance industries the oil ministry source said
