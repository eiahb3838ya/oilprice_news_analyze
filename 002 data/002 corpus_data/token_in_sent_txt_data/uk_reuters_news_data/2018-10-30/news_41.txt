update 1-czech pm sees dukovany extension an option in nuclear plans
pm babis dukovany could be extended by years extension cost czk bln fraction of new unit cez future regulatory economic conditions part of assessment govt may decide this year on massive nuclear power expansion adds cez comment shares details prague oct reuters the lifespan of czech utility cez s dukovany nuclear power plant could be extended by years at a cost of billion crowns million a fraction of the price of a new unit prime minister andrej babis said on tuesday
the government has been considering how to fund a dollar expansion of cez s nuclear power plants before some units reach the end of their lifetime
it had aimed to make a decision this year
the government however has also raised the option of extending dukovany s life beyond which would relieve it of the pressure of having to decide now and give it more time
cez has balked at starting a tender without receiving state guarantees for the massive investment while babis has said the company central europe s largest listed utility that is percent can handle the project itself
cez s dukovany and temelin plants met percent of the country s energy needs last year
babis as quoted by ctk news agency said on tuesday the government committee debating the issue had discussed an extension at its last meeting
cez said it was possible to extend dukovany s lifespan but that any assessment should take future regulatory and economic conditions into account not just technical aspects
we can imagine an extension to dukovany s operation a company spokesman said in an emailed statement
some minority shareholders are afraid a nuclear power expansion through the construction of new reactors would dent dividend payouts if cez were pushed to finance it on its own
the company could face shareholder lawsuits
earlier in october industry minister marta novakova told reuters the state s preferred option remained cez guaranteeing the project
cez had scrapped its previous nuclear tender in after failing to receive state guarantees on power prices it had sought to minimise risks
cez shares were down percent on tuesday at crowns after gains of over percent in the previous session
