rising u.s. crude output sparks race to build export terminals
new oct reuters a competition is emerging among energy exporters proposing crude terminals along the gulf coast to handle a gusher of shale oil coming from west texas oilfields
on monday private equity firm carlyle group became the latest to place a bet proposing with the port of corpus christi what it said would be the first onshore export facility able to load the world s largest crude tankers
the winners of the export terminal race likely will be those best able to navigate a regulatory process that includes multiple government approvals and overcome labor and supply shortages that have already frustrating some early projects to expand export infrastructure
the contest comes as the shale revolution is expected to send the nation s oil production to million barrels per day by the end of from million bpd in according to the energy information administration
existing coastal terminals could be overwhelmed by late next year as a flurry of new pipelines come into operation and move million barrels of oil landlocked in west texas to the gulf coast say oil companies and analysts
carlyle s facility which aims to begin operations by late will compete with other texas and louisiana projects proposed by trafigura ag and pipeline operators enterprise products partners lp and tallgrass energy lp
enterprise and trafigura have not provided timelines noting permits must be secured first
tallgrass says it hopes to provide an offshore crude loading terminal off the lousiana coast by the third quarter of roughly a year behind carlyle s estimate
each aims to fully load very large crude carriers vlccs tankers able to carry up to million barrels of oil to markets in asia latin america and europe
most would require running pipelines away from ports and into the deeper parts of the ocean to allow loading of the larger ships
all of these proposals face significant licensing and other hurdles
like others the of corpus christi project must pass lengthy state and federal approvals
it also must await completion of an army corps of engineers project that has been delayed about a year said sean strawbridge chief executive officer of the port of corpus christi authority
one of the challenges is there more dredging demand than there is capacity in the united states right now he said
for the project to hit its target date it would have to secure permits by next spring and find dredging contractors to work immediately after finishing the army corps project he said
although shale production is expected to rise substantially it will not fill all the proposed projects said john coleman an oil market analyst at research firm wood mackenzie
everyone is racing to throw their hat in the ring and get their project done before everyone else he said
only one or two of the five proposed offshore ports likely will be needed
there s simply not enough oil volumes to go total crude exports hit a record million bpd in june and analysts say the ceiling is around million bpd which is less than the capacity of the export terminals beings considered
you can t build all these terminals so there is an advantage to being among the first sarah emerson managing principal at consultancy esai energy llc said on monday
today more than percent of crude exports move through corpus christi s port
its exports this year rose about bpd in the first nine months from bpd in
oil producer conocophillips which has exported about million barrels of crude from its south texas operations from corpus christi this year expects port facilities to be strained when coming pipelines open
there is probably going to be some tightness particularly at corpus probably in late when these pipes start up said don wallette conoco s finance chief
however port expansion from houston to corpus christi will resolve the problem he said
the danger for oil producers is the pipeline congestion that has landlocked crude in west texas becomes a gulf coast port congestion by
the refining industry can not consume all of the projected oil production
the nation began an building spree after former president barack obama in lifted a ban on crude exports
but as corpus christi s experience shows that building boom has driven up prices for needed dredging
its initial project to deepen a shipping channel to enough to accommodate tankers carrying million barrels of oil is being renegotiated after bids were more than percent of the budget for the work
with carlyle it aims to take a portion of the channel to deep
these projects aren t going to get any cheaper and the longer they take the more expensive they re going to be said the port of corpus christi s strawbridge
