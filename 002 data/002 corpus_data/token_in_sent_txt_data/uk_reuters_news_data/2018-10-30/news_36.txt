vattenfall seen as buyer of default-hit nordic nasdaq power portfolio
oslo oct reuters sweden s vattenfall is seen as the buyer of a norwegian power trader s portfolio after his default on nasdaq s nordic commodities exchange last month confirming on tuesday it was among the firms asked to participate in the auction
the trader einar aas racked up losses he could not cover
the move left commodities companies that are part of nasdaq s clearing house and the exchange itself to plug a million euro million hole in a contingency fund
after the default which was triggered by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads nasdaq said it had organised an auction to sell the portfolio
the exchange said it had invited four clearing participants to join in the auction but declined to identify them
we confirm that it was a winner
who the participants were we still can t comment on nasdaq told reuters
finland s fortum norway s statkraft and germany s uniper confirmed to reuters that they took part in the auction but were outbid
asked by reuters on tuesday whether vattenfall was among the firms nasdaq had asked to participate in the auction the company s chief executive magnus hall said we were asked he declined to confirm that the company had bought the portfolio
vattenfall has said it never comments on its trading decisions
but with fortum uniper and statkraft having failed to win the portfolio vattenfall is the only possible successful bidder
