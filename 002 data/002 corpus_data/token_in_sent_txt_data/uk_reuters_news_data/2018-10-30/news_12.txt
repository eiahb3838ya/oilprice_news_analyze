argentina restarts natural gas exports to chile
santiago oct reuters argentina has begun exporting natural gas to chile after a year interlude chilean president sebastian pinera said on tuesday as the two south american neighbors seek to increasingly integrate their energy supply and electricity grids
the unconventional gas is being piped from argentina s and vaca muerta shale field in the neuquen basin then sent over the andes mountain range to chile s southern province of biobio
we are working enthusiastically with argentine president mauricio macri to integrate our energy supply pinera said in a speech
the exports mark a turning point in energy trade in the region
argentina which sits atop the world s no
shale gas reserves was once a major supplier of natural gas to chile but triggered a diplomatic crisis in the by cutting off shipments when its own supplies ran low
the move sent chile a global mining powerhouse that has few hydrocarbons of its own scrambling to find new sources of supply
the spat also helped foster a move towards alternative energy sources like wind and solar in chile
pinera said the two countries had very different but often complementary energy needs and that depending on the time of year and circumstance could either export or import fuel and electricity across their shared border
this will permit us to back one another up without having to spend excess money to do so he said
