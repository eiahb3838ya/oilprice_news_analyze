reuters summit-u.s. grain handler andersons eyes growth after lansing deal
chicago reuters two years after fending off a hostile takeover attempt grain handler the andersons inc is expanding its commodity shipping and ethanol businesses and eyeing to acquisitions to stay profitable during a global supply glut that has hurt farmers
the andersons this month said it was purchasing the remaining percent stake in lansing trade group llc that the company did not already own by paying million in cash assuming million in debt and issuing stock in its acquisition
we basically triple our grain business and take our company up to just under billion in annual revenue andersons chief executive officer pat bowe said in an interview at the reuters global commodities summit on tuesday
the deal expands the andersons footprint beyond the midwestern crop belt
lansing s assets include grain elevators in idaho and louisiana hydraulic fracturing sand hubs in minnesota and texas and a former louis dreyfus company grain port in houston
bowe said the deal would increase within a year
that would be quite a comeback from two years ago when the hedge fund holdings inc offered to buy the andersons for billion an overture that was rejected
bowe joined the andersons shortly before the takeover attempt after a career at cargill inc
andersons shares are up about percent so far this year after slumping more than percent in
it is also building what it calls the greenest ethanol plant in the country in kansas and expects it to start up in bowe said
it has diversified into making flour for pasta and pretzels from the ancient grain spelt at the purity foods inc mill in michigan which it purchased for a few million dollars in
as primarily a domestic grain shipper the andersons has also been relatively insulated from the trade war that has hampered exports
soybean shipments to china valued at billion in have slowed to a virtual halt after china raised tariffs on the product in july
bowe said the company would entertain small to m a in the specialty crop nutrients and food space and was always buying rail cars but another large acquisition was unlikely in the next year
this is a big one for us bowe said of the lansing deal
