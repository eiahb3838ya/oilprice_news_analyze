s.korea asks u.s. for "maximum flexibility" on iran sanctions waiver
seoul reuters south korea has asked the united states for maximum flexibility on its request for a waiver to prevent south korean companies from being affected by renewed sanctions against iran the foreign ministry said
the sanctions against iranian crude oil exports are set to take effect on as part of president donald trump s efforts to force tehran to accede to a more restrictive deal on curbing its nuclear and missile programmes
south korea a ally and one of asia s biggest buyers of iranian oil has already stopped crude imports from iran
south korean building firms have also cancelled contracts in iran due to financing difficulties
foreign minister kang asked for the exemption in a telephone call with secretary of state mike pompeo late on monday the ministry said in a statement
minister kang requested the side exert maximum flexibility so that south korea can secure an exemption to minimise the damage to our companies the ministry said
pompeo said he noted seoul s position and would continue discussions on the matter the ministry said
the exemption issue is the latest sign of strain between seoul and washington over a range of issues especially the enforcement of sanctions aimed at limiting north korea s nuclear and missile programmes
south korea and japan have been in talks with the united states in a bid to avoid adverse impacts from the reimposition of sanctions on iran
both countries won waivers during the previous round of sanctions that ended in but washington has adopted a more aggressive stance this time
south korean buyers of iranian oil have cut their purchases in recent months due to expensive middle east grades and uncertainty over trade with iran
imports of iranian oil fell to zero in september for the first time since
another risk for south korean companies is that sanctions will make it difficult to receive and make payments in dollars for projects linked to iran
on monday hyundai engineering construction said it scrapped a billion won million pounds deal to build a petrochemicals complex in iran due to lack of financing
in june daelim industrial said a trillion won contract to build a refinery project in iran was cancelled due to financing problems
