corrects oil production to million bpd in paragraph libyan oil workers complain about work conditions state oil firm noc asking for pay increases tripoli oct reuters the chairman of libya s state oil firm national oil corp noc has asked the central bank to increase salaries of oil workers by percent in a statement said on tuesday
the north african country approved in such a pay rise which was never implemented as libya s chaos accelerated then with the country splitting in two government the following year and blockages and protests hampering production
noc chairman mustafa sanalla called for the implementation of a percent salary increase for all oil workers as per the budget the oil company said in a statement
he also called for the central bank which manages libya s oil and gas revenues in the absence of a government and parliament with national reach to make additional budget allocations for noc to repair facilities
sanalla said the wage increase was justified based on the recent rise of oil production to million barrels per day the highest level since when a wave of protests and blockades by armed groups and staff kicked off
there have been small protests over wages and work conditions on several facilities in recent weeks
the most volatile situation is at the el sharara oilfield in the south where a small group of libyan tribesmen staged a protest last week the latest in a series of incidents
workers like many libyans have been suffering from high inflation driven by the falling value of the libyan dinar that has made food imports more expensive
