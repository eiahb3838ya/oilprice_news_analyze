eu should brace for u.s. standoff over china, ex-wto chief warns
paris reuters the european union should prepare for its companies to be targeted by american sanctions in a worsening trade dispute between the united states and china former world trade organisation wto director general pascal lamy said on tuesday
as they weigh up a response to renewed sanctions against iran which have forced an exodus of european companies eu governments should consider the prospect of similar extraterritorial measures penalising china trade lamy told an international investment conference in paris
if the were to step further in not only hitting china with trade measures but with sanctions if they were to deal with china the way they did with iran then we would all have a big problem he said
that s why we need to have a careful look at what will happen in the case of a surge in global protectionism from brexit to the trade war has done little to dent foreign direct investment flows overall according to data presented to the xbma conference on mergers and acquisitions
the global volume of m a deals is projected to rise percent this year to trillion its annual total since the eve of the last major financial crisis
chinese investors accounted for a record percent of european inbound deal volume last year as some turned their attention away from the united states
trade is also expected to benefit from increased tariffs and other barriers
the trump administration in may withdrew washington from an international agreement to curb tehran s nuclear activities and imposed new sanctions against iran
that triggered the mass withdrawal of european companies from carmakers to oil majors in order to avoid crippling penalties reintroduced in stages on and

europe could create its own extraterritorial mechanisms to sanction breaches of environmental data protection tax and laws according to the paper by lamy and four others including louis schweitzer honorary chairman of carmaker renault
failing that brussels could use existing directives to halt the eu activities of foreign banks from a third country that imposes extraterritorial provisions on eu companies it said
it can not be ruled out that the united states will impose future sanctions on china that go beyond the current trade measures initiated by the american president which could then be applied extraterritorially the paper added
