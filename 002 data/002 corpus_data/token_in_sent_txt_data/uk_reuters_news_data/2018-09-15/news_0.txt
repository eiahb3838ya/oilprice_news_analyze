congo will declare cobalt and other minerals as "strategic" in coming days - mines minister
kolwezi democratic republic of congo reuters the prime minister of democratic republic of congo will sign a decree in the coming days to designate cobalt and other minerals as strategic and therefore subject to higher royalties mines minister martin kabwelulu said on saturday
the change is part of a new mining code which mining companies including glencore and randgold oppose as it axes tax exemptions and hikes royalties and profit taxes
they have been holding out the hope it might be watered down in further negotiations
the government has not yet formally announced which metals will be classed as strategic in the new code and subject to royalties of percent
before the code was introduced companies paid a rate of percent for cobalt
addressing a mining conference in the copper and city of kolwezi kabwelulu said in the coming days you will see the prime minister sign a decree to declare cobalt and certain other substances as miners of cobalt would have paid a royalty of percent under the new code if its designation had stayed the same
the government considers minerals with the strategic designation important for the economic social and industrial future of the country
the new code came into effect in june
companies say its tax hikes and cancelling of exemptions for existing projects against changes to the previous fiscal and customs regimes breach previous agreements with the government and will deter further investment
kabwelulu said all companies were paying the royalties and taxes as stipulated by the new code despite randgold saying in august it was still negotiating with the government
i know that randgold made a statement but it s not true he said
congo is africa s top copper producer and the world s leading miner of cobalt a mineral which has seen a surge in demand to the manufacture of electric car batteries and mobile phones
other major mining companies with investments in congo include anglogold ashanti ivanhoe mines china molybdenum zijin mining and mmg
