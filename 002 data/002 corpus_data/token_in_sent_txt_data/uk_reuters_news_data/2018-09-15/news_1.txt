islanders in kenya build recycled plastic boat to highlight pollution
lamu kenya reuters kenyan islanders have built a boat made entirely of recycled plastic collected during of the ocean to highlight the growing menace of plastic waste that ends up in the sea
last year the kenyan government imposed the world s toughest law against plastic bags with offenders including producers retailers and ordinary kenyans risking imprisonment for up to four years or fines of in a bid to reduce plastic pollution
many bags drift into the ocean strangling turtles suffocating seabirds and filling the stomachs of dolphins and whales
the construction of the boat has been dubbed the flipflopi project because of the hundreds of recycled plastic sandals that cover the vessel
the sailing dhow which the team built from over tonnes of plastic waste sailed for the first time in the waters off kenya s lamu island on saturday
its launch coincided with international world cleanup day during which environmental groups carry out activities to tackle pollution
the boat is a riot of colour including red green blue and yellow due to the flip flops used to cover the hull and other parts
we hope people around the globe are inspired by our beautiful multicoloured boat and find their own ways to plastics said ben morrison the founder of the flipflopi project
morrison who spent a decade building a travel business focussed on africa turned to constructing colourful boats in when he noticed alarming pollution along the kenyan coast
the team used kenyan facilities and technologies to recycle the plastic waste and was led by local boat builder ali abdalla skanda
we are proud to be a guide to the world and its inhabitants during this vital time of challenge for our ocean environment skanda said adding they had received support from around the world as they built the boat
najib balala the kenyan tourism minister praised the team when he attended the launch at lamu island a protected world heritage site popular with local and foreign holidaymakers on kenya s far north coastline
tourism is one of the top hard currency earners for kenya and officials in nairobi are keen to protect beach resorts along the coastline
