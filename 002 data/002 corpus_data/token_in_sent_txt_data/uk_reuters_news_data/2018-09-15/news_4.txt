rpt-florence seen testing n. carolina environmental codes on toxic hog waste
raleigh york sept reuters tropical storm florence could taint north carolina waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste as heavy rains test environmental rules written with milder weather in mind carrying the risk of contaminating water with bacteria like salmonella officials said on friday
many of the state s environmental codes were written to withstand a or storm
but florence promises heavy rains that some regions might not see in a thousand years straining systems meant to keep state residents safe
the deluge could push industrial waste sites to the limit governor roy cooper said on friday
all of the infrastructure here is going to be tested cooper told a news conference
we are deeply concerned about the inland florence would not be the first test of north carolina manure pits or sixteen lagoons flooded under the foot of rain that came with hurricane matthew in
the southeast part of the state is expected to get more than twice that amount in the days ahead said bryce link a meteorologist at dtn marine weather a forecasting service
there are industrial hog farms within north carolina s floodplain environmentalists estimate and duke energy corp has four coal ash sites in the coastal area touched by florence
if excrement escapes from the lagoons where it is stored it could potentially contaminate drinking water with bacteria like salmonella which can cause digestive problems and in certain vulnerable patients cause coli
the environmental protection agency is working with states and is ready to respond to any breaches a spokeswoman maggie sauerhage said
animal feeding operations above a certain size need to be designed and operated to handle the rainfall and runoff from storms sauerhage said in an emailed response to questions from reuters
even in the midst of a storm these feeding sites must report leaks she said
in north carolina hog and poultry waste pits make up acres of land according to a report from the environmental working group
still north carolina has fewer hog farms than it did when hurricane floyd inundated about sites in and sparked statewide reforms
ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past and duke energy has agreed to secure the sites in north carolina s lowland areas but that work is ongoing
erin culbert a spokeswoman for duke energy said the utility was ready to respond as needed to the storm
there is however disagreement over the risk posed by florence
andy curliss head of the north carolina pork council said spill dangers are overblown noting that hog farmers have faced severe weather before
this is not the first hurricane to hit north carolina said curliss who noted that many lagoons are at a low point across the state at this time of year
but a state lawmaker said that hurricanes have led to dangerous spills in recent years and north carolina s laws are too lax to confront severe storms such as florence
as a state we have put our head in the sand representative pricey harrison said
past storms should have been a wakeup reporting by patrick rucker in raleigh and jessica in new york additional reporting by tom polansek in chicago editing by leslie adler
