update 4-iraq restarts some kirkuk oil exports after year-long halt
kirkuk exports had been halted since october iraq took over kirkuk after failed kurdish independence vote washington was pressing baghdad erbil to find compromise current flows still modest not clear when will rise adds state department comment by dmitry zhdannikov and ahmed rasheed nov reuters iraq on friday restarted exports of kirkuk oil halted a year ago due to a standoff between the central government and kurdistan s region after a new government in baghdad agreed a tentative deal with erbil
the development is a win for the government which has been urging both sides to settle the dispute and resume flows to help address a shortage of iranian crude in the region after washington imposed new sanctions on tehran
state department spokeswoman heather nauert said on twitter that resumption of exports of kirkuk oil was another important step in our efforts to reduce iran s oil flows resumed at a modest level of around barrels per day bpd compared with a peak of bpd seen last year and it was not clear when and by how much they would rise industry sources said
the kirkuk crude is being exported to the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan by a pipeline crossing kurdistan
a spokesman for iraq s oil ministry asim jihad confirmed exports had restarted adding that an agreement had been reached to resume flows at bpd
the resumption of kirkuk shipments of between and barrels per day will not add to iraq s total exports jihad said
oil prices rose with brent crude up more than per barrel supported partially by the flows from kurdistan
the deal signals that new iraqi prime minister adel and oil minister thamir ghadhban are ready to work with erbil despite previous tensions and a failed independence referendum in september
the halting of exports from kirkuk in october stopped almost bpd flowing out of iraq towards turkey and international markets causing a net revenue loss of some billion over the past year
most of iraq s exports come from southern fields but kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the middle east estimated to contain billion barrels of recoverable oil
exports had been on hold since iraqi government forces retook kirkuk from kurdish authorities in
the kurds had taken control of kirkuk and its oilfields after islamic state militants drove the iraqi army out in and kurdish forces in turn ejected the militants
a pipeline baghdad once used for export via turkey was wrecked by islamic state leaving only one working
kurdistan is producing and exporting some bpd via the pipeline
resumed flows from kirkuk will lift this to bpd but short of the bpd the kurdish region had exported at some point last year
iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries where kirkuk s output has been diverted over the past year
the refineries are set to receive some bpd under the latest deal the sources said
baghdad and erbil have yet to find a compromise over maximum flow levels as well as budget transfers from the central government to erbil something the two sides have struggled to agree on for many years
