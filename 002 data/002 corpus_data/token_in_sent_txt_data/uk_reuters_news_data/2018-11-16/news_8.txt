column-oil market roiled by too much gasoline, not enough diesel: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london nov reuters global oil markets are increasingly with light distillates such as gasoline while there are not enough middle distillates such as diesel which has opened a big price differential between the two fuels
to keep meeting healthy demand for refiners are processing high volumes of crude and creating a glut of gasoline
gasoline prices for delivery in june are trading just per barrel above benchmark brent futures for the same month compared with a premium of per barrel for distillate fuel oil
early in october the gap in cracking margins was much narrower with premiums of and per barrel over brent respectively but since then gasoline prices have slumped amid fears of
gasoline prices have been hit by a combination of record refinery processing in the third quarter and flattening consumption from motorists which have left the market carrying record stocks for the time of year
diesel prices on the other hand have been supported by strong demand from the freight manufacturing and mining sectors as well as from oil and gas drillers themselves
distillate prices are also being supported by the prospect of even higher consumption from the start of when new pollution regulations on bunker fuels used in the shipping industry come into force
regulations adopted by the international maritime organization will require shipping firms to switch from using heavy fuel oil to middle distillates unless they install expensive scrubbers to clean up their sulphur emissions
differential growth in light and middle distillate consumption is not a new problem
gasoline and diesel consumption are driven by different factors which means that growth rates differ more often than they are the same
gasoline consumption is more weighted towards private motorists while distillate is geared towards commercial freight transport aviation manufacturing farming mining and oil and gas production
gasoline is weighted regionally towards the united states and japan while distillate is weighted more towards europe latin america africa asia and the middle east
as a result gasoline use tends to be steadier across the business cycle while distillate consumption varies much more with the state of the economy
in a typical expansion gasoline consumption tends to dominate in the early stages while distillate growth takes over as the cycle becomes more mature
if the expansion or contraction is synchronised globally the impact on distillate demand becomes much more pronounced than if it is concentrated in only a few regions
growth in distillate demand during and has left inventories relatively low while the introduction of new imo regulations threatens to tighten them even further in and
like any commodity market even small imbalances between the production and consumption of individual fuels can have an outsized impact on prices
but gasoline and distillate are from the same refining process so refiners have no option but to cope with the resulting large swings in margins
refiners have some flexibility to change the ratio in which they produce light and middle distillates by altering the slate of crudes they process and running their fluid catalytic cracking fcc units in rather than mode but the flexibility is quite limited
for the most part the market for individual fuels is made to balance through changes in prices and consumer behaviour
rising distillate prices will force the freight transportation sector to focus on improving fuel economy by trimming schedules consolidating loads switching from air freight to ocean shipping and slow steaming
freight and logistics firms have considerable scope to cut fuel consumption by reducing part loads minimising empty backhauls and switching away from air freight sacrificing delivery speed for improved fuel economy
shipping companies can also achieve large reductions in fuel consumption by making even a small reduction in sailing speed
in a period of high fuel prices shipping companies can trade increased sailing times smaller schedules and larger fleets higher capital costs for reduced fuel consumption lower operating costs
the growing gap between diesel and gasoline prices will also accelerate the shift away from diesel towards gasoline for private motor cars and fleet vehicles especially in europe
government regulations and taxation policies are already favouring the sale of gasoline and electric vehicles rather than diesel cars but the fuel price differential will speed up the shift
in britain for example the average retail price of diesel is now more than pence per litre percent higher than gasoline and the gap has almost doubled since the end of august
british sales of diesel cars have already fallen by almost percent in the first months of compared accounting for just percent of new sales down from percent the previous year
petrol car sales rose by percent over the same period and their share grew to percent from percent according to the society of motor manufacturers and traders
reduced diesel consumption in favour of gasoline in europe will play an important role in helping make more middle distillates available for the shipping industry in
the biggest source of uncertainty for both refiners and middle distillate consumers is the outlook for the global economy in and
synchronised global growth provided a big boost to middle distillate consumption in tightening the market considerably
but global freight volumes have grown much more slowly in as the economy has lost momentum easing some of the pressure on distillate supplies
if the global economy continues to slow or tips into recession in the looming distillate shortage will largely disappear and distillate margins will soften
if the global economy accelerates again however then strong freight demand coupled with the new imo regulations will likely push the premium for distillate fuels even higher
