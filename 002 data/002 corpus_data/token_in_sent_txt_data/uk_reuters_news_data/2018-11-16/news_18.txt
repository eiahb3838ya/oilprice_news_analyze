update 7-regulator 'stunned and terrified' after causing pg&e stock surge
reuters the chief of california s top utilities regulator said on friday he was shocked to learn that reassurances he made to investors about pg e caused the embattled power utility s stock to surge over percent in a matter of minutes
pg e s stock had slumped over percent since the state s wildfire broke out last week on fears that without help from california s government the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible
the fire destroyed the town of paradise and has killed at least people
california public utilities commission president michael picker told reuters on friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers
that echoed comments he made on an investor conference call organized by bank of america on thursday when he said he could not imagine allowing the state s largest utility to go into bankruptcy
picker was surprised hours later on thursday to learn that pg e s stock had surged over percent in extended trading in reaction to his comments
i was stunned and terrified picker said
i left the call yesterday and i went back to a workshop i was in so i didn t find out about it until several hours picker s remarks to a private group were unusual in part because public companies and their executives must follow federal rules aimed at avoiding selective disclosure of material news but a government official or other outside parties sharing an outlook on a public company does not face the same obligations experts say
pg e shares on friday closed up percent at on the new york stock exchange
the stock is still down about percent from before the fire started erasing nearly billion in market capitalization
the cause of the camp fire that destroyed the town of paradise remains under investigation
with pg e potentially facing mounting costs from wildfires the regulator would also consider potential options to restructure the company including separating its electricity and gas units picker told reuters
keeping wall street interested in investing in pg e and other california utilities is key to reducing the state s carbon emissions and making the power system more efficient he said
i don t think we people

but we want to make sure that we can continue to keep the lights on and be cleaner and cleaner and ideally more graphic pg e shares surge after thursday close on utility regulator comments california state senator bill dodd told reuters it was too soon to speculate about future legislation that might provide relief to pg e in case it is found liable for the camp fire
dodd sponsored legislation passed this year that lets utilities pass some of the costs related to liability from wildfires on to ratepayers but the bill did not specifically provide for
graphic fire fear citigroup on friday upgraded pg e s stock to buy from given the reaction in the stock market we think there was an appropriate level of urgency that something needed to be done citigroup analysts wrote referring to the regulator s statement
the price for pg e s more than billion of bonds also rose
the price of the march bond was up about points in afternoon trading after earlier trading as much as points higher
pg e s debt was pressured earlier this week after the utility borrowed billion under its credit lines and warned it could face liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage should its equipment be found to have caused the fire
the gains in bond prices came even after both moody s investors service and standard poor s cut their credit ratings on pg e late thursday to just one notch above junk bond territory and said the outlook remained negative
fitch ratings on friday also downgraded the utility s issuer default ratings
with the collapse in its bond prices this week most of pg e s bonds were trading as though they were already securities although friday s recovery brought many of them back in line with comparably corporate bonds
pg e has about million of floating rate notes maturing in two weeks and does not face another maturing security until october
that october million bond with a percent coupon yielded more than percent at one point in trading on thursday the first of pg e s securities to have breached that threshold
on friday the october note was up more than points to cents on the dollar with the yield dropping to percent
shares of edison international whose southern california edison subsidiary provides power in southern california jumped percent
while investors view it as at less risk than pg e to massive liabilities from wildfires its stock has been volatile over the past week as a second fire burned in that region
the woolsey fire in southern california also remains under investigation
the volatility in pg e shares has drawn a rush of trading in options
traders are betting the stock will remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term
