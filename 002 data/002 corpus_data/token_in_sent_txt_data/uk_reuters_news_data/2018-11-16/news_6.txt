colombia's private crude producers cautiously optimistic about duque
bogota nov reuters private oil producers in colombia said on friday they are optimistic about promises by president ivan duque to improve security and bolster the sector
duque who has been in office for days pledged during his campaign to lower taxes on businesses and improve security for crude producers in the country where leftist rebels regularly bomb pipelines and community protests sometimes stymie output
we re seeing progress we have all the confidence in the world in the administration said occidental petroleum chief executive vicki hollub on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in bogota
occidental operates the cano limon field in eastern arauca province
the cano limon pipeline run by state oil company ecopetrol has been offline for most of the year because of attacks by the national liberation army eln rebels
production and exports from the field have remained normal despite the bombings because ecopetrol is able to use the smaller bicentenario pipeline for transport
though the pipeline is currently shut it was attacked repeatedly last weekend
hollub who said occidental hopes to more than double its barrels per day net output in the coming years was optimistic about the security situation
the military is incredible oil companies may be among those who benefit from a proposed tax cut to corporations that is wending its way through congress
the government wants to reduce duties on businesses to percent over the next four years down from percent
other private producers were more cautious
it s still early but all the signs are positive said frontera energy chief executive richard herbert
what we need now is security in prospective less developed areas he said adding that blocks won by frontera back in in southern caqueta and putumayo provinces have not been developed because of ongoing security worries
herbert said he hoped there would be a new bidding round in so further oil areas could be opened to exploration
colombia has repeatedly delayed its deadline to receive offers for onshore areas at its jacinto auction
the round would be the first since
frontera estimates its average production will end at bpd some of which comes from fields in colombia
speaking at the close of the conference mines and energy minister maria fernanda suarez said she was confident the oil sector would continue to contribute to the country s development and its bid to become energy
