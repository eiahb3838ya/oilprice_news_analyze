exclusive-venezuela shifts oil ventures' accounts to russian bank -document, sources
caracas reuters venezuela s oil company pdvsa is telling customers of its joint ventures to deposit oil sales proceeds in an account recently opened at russia s gazprombank ao according to sources and an internal document seen by reuters on saturday
pdvsa s move comes after the united states imposed tough new financial sanctions on aimed at blocking venezuela s president nicolas maduro s access to the country s oil revenue
supporters of venezuelan opposition leader and interim president juan guaido said recently that a fund would be established to accept proceeds from sales of venezuelan oil
the united states and dozens of other countries have recognized guaido as the nation s legitimate head of state
maduro has denounced guaido as a puppet seeking to foment a coup
pdvsa also has begun pressing its foreign partners holding stakes in joint ventures in its key orinoco belt producing area to formally decide whether they will continue with the projects according to two sources with knowledge of the talks
the joint venture partners include norway s equinor asa chevron corp and france s total sa
we would like to make formal your knowledge of new banking instructions to make payments in dollars or euros wrote pdvsa s finance vice president fernando de quintal in a letter dated to the pdvsa unit that supervises its joint ventures
even after a first round of financial sanctions in pdvsa s joint ventures managed to maintain bank accounts in the united states and europe to receive proceeds from oil sales
they also used correspondent banks in the united states and europe to shift money to pdvsa s accounts in china
pdvsa several weeks ago informed customers of the new banking instructions and has begun moving the accounts of its joint ventures which can export crude separately
the decision was made amid tension with some of its partners which have withdrawn staff from caracas since sanctions were imposed in january
the sanctions gave oil companies working in venezuela including chevron and oil service firms halliburton co general electric co s baker hughes and schlumberger nv a deadline to halt all operations in the south american country
the european union has encouraged member countries to recognize a new temporary government led by guaido until new elections can be held
europe also has said it could impose financial sanctions to bar maduro from having access to oil revenue coming from the region
maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the opec country that has left many venezuelans malnourished and struggling to find medicine sparking the exodus of an estimated million venezuelans
sanctions designed to deprive maduro of oil revenue have left an armada of loaded oil tankers off venezuela s coasts that have not been discharged by pdvsa s customers due to payment issues
the bottleneck has caused problems for pdvsa to continue producing and refining oil without imported diluents and components
pdvsa also ordered its petrocedeno joint venture with equinor and total to halt oil output and upgrading due to a lack of naphtha needed to make the production exportable as the sanctions prohibit suppliers of the fuel from exporting to venezuela
