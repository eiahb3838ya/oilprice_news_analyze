update 1-mexico offensive against fuel theft leaves motorists stranded
guadalajara mexico reuters an offensive by mexico s new government against fuel theft at one of the country s main refineries has led to days of shortages at gas stations in several central states as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines
a reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of guadalajara in jalisco state were closed on sunday including those operated by state oil firm pemex spain s repsol and bp
there were long lines of motorists at those that were operating
i ve gone to gas stations and nothing there s none at any of them said alan delgado trying to fill his buick truck at a bp gas station in guadalajara
this is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and the shortages followed the closure of a pipeline from the salamanca refinery in the central state of guanajuato and as pemex started using more tankers to transport fuel
theft by gangs and oil industry workers from mexico s refineries is a major drain on government resources but the measures taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortages drag on
violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers
president andres manuel lopez obrador who took office in december confirmed on friday that less fuel was being sent through pipelines
i ask citizens for understanding and support because we need to solve this problem together
we are trying to get it resolved soon lopez obrador said in a televised speech
obrador has vowed to tackle theft outside and inside pemex or petroleos mexicanos which estimates that fuel worth more than billion pesos billion has been stolen since alone
the president said last month that mexico s armed forces would take part in security at pemex installations around the country including its refinery in salamanca
fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence according to guanajuato state governor diego sinhue
the mexican association of gasoline station business owners warned its members on that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the salamanca refinery
you are free to take measures that benefit your customers to limit the sale of fuel to liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public the association said
guanajuato governor sinhue took to twitter on sunday saying that pemex s chief executive octavio romero confirmed that after reopening the pipeline he expects to reestablish service to percent of the gasoline stations during the it was not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortages in other regions
pemex said on saturday that it is preferring the use of safer means of transport which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations leading to delays in the states of hidalgo mexico jalisco michoacan guanajuato and queretaro
pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to percent transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains
a may study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves between and had tapped pipelines roughly every kms miles along pemex s approximately km pipeline network
the government has not made clear if they see road and rail transport as a long term solution for fuel distribution
transporting fuel by road and rail is to times more expensive than by pipeline said gonzalo monroy a mexico oil analyst
if this keeps happening and expanding to other parts of the country the mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter said monroy
