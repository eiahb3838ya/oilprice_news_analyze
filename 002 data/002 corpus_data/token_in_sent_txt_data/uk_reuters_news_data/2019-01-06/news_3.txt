mexico offensive against fuel theft leaves motorists stranded
guadalajara mexico jan reuters an offensive by mexico s new government against fuel theft at one of the country s main refineries has led to shortages at gas stations across several central states as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines
a reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of guadalajara in jalisco state were closed on sunday and that there were long lines of motorists at those that were operating
violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income hurting mexico s refineries bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers
president andres manuel lopez obrador who took office in december said on friday that the shortages were caused in part by a decision to move fuel by tankers rather than pipelines
i ask citizens for understanding and support because we need to solve this problem together
we are trying to get it resolved soon lopez obrador said in a televised speech
obrador has vowed to tackle theft outside and inside the state oil firm petroleos mexicanos or pemex which estimates that fuel worth more than billion pesos billion has been stolen since alone
the president said last month that mexico s armed forces would take part in security at pemex installations around the country including a refinery the company runs in the city of salamanca in the central state of guanajuato
fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence according to guanajuato state governor diego sinhue
the mexican association of gasoline station business owners warned its members on that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the salamanca refinery
you are free to take measures that benefit your customers to limit the sale of fuel to liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public the association said
pemex said on saturday that it is preferring the use of safer means of transport which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations leading to delays in the states of hidalgo mexico jalisco michoacan guanajuato and queretaro
pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to percent transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains
a may study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves between and had tapped pipelines roughly every kms mi along pemex s approximately km pipeline network
