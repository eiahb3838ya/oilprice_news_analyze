qatari stake in rosneft paves way for global energy deals - doha envoy
moscow reuters the qatari sovereign wealth fund s acquisition of a stake in russia s rosneft sets the stage for collaboration between the russian oil major and qatar petroleum doha s ambassador to moscow said in an interview with reuters
the qatar investment authority qia became a shareholder in rosneft following the russian oil giant s privatization in late and now holds a percent stake
though qatar is a small oil producer compared to its massive gas production state oil firm qatar petroleum is on a drive to expand operations globally
qatar s ambassador to russia fahad bin mohamed said qia s stake opened the door to cooperation between rosneft and qatar petroleum in projects around the world
there is no malicious agenda said
just pure economic qatar is seeking international partnerships amid a boycott imposed by saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain and egypt which severed diplomatic and transport ties with the country in accusing it of supporting terrorism
doha denies the charge
qatar s joint projects with other energy firms do not raise eyebrows he said
so then why is there a question mark when we have a collaboration with rosneft reuters reported last year that russian state bank vtb secretly loaned around billion to qia to help finance its acquisition of the rosneft stake undermining the deal s stated aim of bringing foreign money into russia
rosneft denied the report
said he did not know whether russian funds were used to finance the deal
qatar could sell the stake but was unlikely to do so soon he said
we did not invest that much of a stake into this company to flip just like this very quickly said
the united states has called on qatar one of the world s top suppliers of liquefied natural gas lng to challenge russian gas dominance in europe
but the tiny gulf nation will not be at loggerheads with russia over the european market on political grounds said
we are in the space of the same commodity and we do want to expand our markets he said
if that expansion comes within the natural course of economic partnership then absolutely but if it comes within the context of any political rivalry then absolutely we will say no to that why try to push somebody out qatar could also partner in russian lng projects though participation in novatek s arctic lng has not come up in discussions he said
confirmed that qatar was in talks about buying russian air defense systems but said no contracts had been signed due to sanctions on russian military exports
the sanctions created considerable concern said
saudi arabia previously threatened to take military action if qatar installed the russian air defense system
we don t tell the saudis what they should buy said
and we won t let them interfere in our relationships with writing by polina ivanova editing by dale hudson
