update 1-northern china pollution up 16 pct in january
shanghai reuters air pollution in major northern chinese cities rose percent on the year in january official data showed with surging industrial activity making it increasingly unlikely they will meet their winter emissions targets
average concentrations of small hazardous particles known as in two major northern chinese emissions control zones climbed percent from a year earlier to micrograms per cubic meter according to reuters analysis of official pollution data
china has vowed not to ease up when it comes to fighting pollution even amid an economic slump but rising emissions of smog last month suggests that some provinces could struggle to balance that goal with an upturn in industrial production
the reasons for the increases in levels are not hard to identify said lauri myllyvirta energy analyst with environmental group greenpeace who noted that steel thermal power and cement production surged throughout the region in the final quarter of
the outsourcing of industrial output that took place last winter in order for beijing to hit its air quality targets was reversed this winter driving air pollution levels up in the region while the rest of the country has seen the worst performer over the month was the coal city of linfen in shanxi province which saw average levels of micrograms up percent from a year earlier
shijiazhuang the provincial capital of hebei china s biggest steelmaking region also saw emissions rise percent to micrograms
china s official air quality standard is micrograms while the world health organization recommends an annual average of no more than
over the three months beginning in november when heating systems are switched on throughout the north average in the cities reached micrograms up percent on the year
anyang a coal and steel producing city in henan province was the worst performer over that period with average concentrations at micrograms up percent
henan has blamed its poor performance this winter on unfavorable weather conditions
china s environment ministry did not respond to a request for comment
however senior official liu bingjiang told reporters last month that local governments would be held fully accountable for any failures regardless of the weather
most of the cities are aiming to cut pollution by percent compared to months earlier far lower than last year s target of around percent
the compliance period also began a month earlier in october when pollution is normally much lower
however they are still struggling to meet targets
with four months of the period passed and two to go it would take a very steep reduction in to get to the reduction target said myllyvirta
