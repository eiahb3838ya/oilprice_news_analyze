u.s. solar jobs down for second year as trump tariffs weigh
los angeles reuters the number of jobs in the solar industry dropped by percent in a second year of losses as the trump administration s tariffs on foreign panels and policy changes hit demand for installations according to an industry report released on tuesday
the job losses reflect how changing trade and environmental policies can alter the trajectory of an industry that was among the segments of the energy industry
the number of solar energy workers fell by to in according to the solar jobs census released annually by the research firm the solar foundation following a loss of jobs in
but jobs are expected to rise next year the report said
in early president donald trump imposed percent tariffs on imported solar panels to boost domestic manufacturing the opening salvo in what has become a trade war
the move led developers to cancel or freeze billions of dollars of investments in projects because most of the solar panels used in the united states are made abroad
on the manufacturing side there is little evidence so far of a boost
jobs in the industry s manufacturing sector a small slice of the overall industry fell percent in according to the report
policies of states are also critical to solar growth and changes in incentives and rates for projects in large markets led to job losses there according to the report
in california utility procurement slowed because power companies have fulfilled renewable energy procurement requirements
the state s commercial market also slowed due to a shift to rates that are less favorable to solar
in massachusetts the commercial market stalled ahead of the introduction of a new incentive scheme at the end of the year
the solar foundation said it expects a rebound in jobs of percent next year however due to recent declines in solar panel prices that have made them more affordable
china last year slashed subsidies for solar installations unleashing a flood of panels onto the international market and pushing prices below what they were before the tariffs were imposed
installation will receive the biggest bump more than percent the report said while manufacturing will rise percent the report said
jinkosolar holding co ltd hanwha q cells and some others are opening factories to avoid tariffs
