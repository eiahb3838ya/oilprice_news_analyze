update 4-trump says he could let china trade deal deadline slip, 'not inclined to'
reuters president donald trump said on tuesday that he could let the march deadline for a trade agreement with china slide for a little while but that he would prefer not to and expects to meet with chinese president xi jinping to close the deal at some point
tariffs on billion billion pounds worth of imports from china are scheduled to rise to percent from percent if the two sides can not reach a deal by the deadline increasing pain and costs in sectors from consumer electronics to agriculture
trump s advisers have previously described march as a hard deadline but trump told reporters for the first time that a delay was now possible
if we re close to a deal where we think we can make a real deal and it s going to get done i could see myself letting that slide for a little while trump said of the deadline at a white house cabinet meeting
but generally speaking i m not inclined to do we re doing very well over in china trump added
a growing number of businesses and lawmakers have expressed hopes for a delay in the tariff increase while the two sides tackle the difficult demands for major structural policy changes by china aimed at ending the forced transfer of american trade secrets curbing beijing s industrial subsidies and enforcing intellectual property rights
senator rob portman an ohio republican said he discussed the talks with trade representative ustr robert lighthizer last week and added that he thought the talks were constructive and i think they re making progress and my hope is that by march there will be enough progress to be made that at a minimum there could be a delay in the imposition of additional tariffs portman told reporters
portman who served as ustr during the george bush administration added that the trump administration is committed to structural reforms at this point and trump is less likely to settle for a deal mainly focused on increased purchases of commodities
erin ennis senior vice president of the business council said more time may be needed for a deal which will require a meeting between trump and his chinese counterpart to complete
what i am sensing is there is a strong desire on both sides to reach an agreement she added
trump said last week he did not plan to meet with xi before the march deadline
stocks rallied on trump s trade comments along with a tentative congressional spending deal aimed at avoiding another government shutdown
all three major indexes posted their biggest gains for the month so far with the dow jones industrial average snapping a losing streak to rise percent and the s p gaining percent
lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived in beijing on tuesday and are scheduled to hold talks on thursday and friday with chinese vice premier liu he the top economic adviser to xi
we re looking forward to several important days of talks mnuchin told reporters after arriving at a beijing hotel
lighthizer who arrived at the hotel earlier in the day did not answer reporters questions
