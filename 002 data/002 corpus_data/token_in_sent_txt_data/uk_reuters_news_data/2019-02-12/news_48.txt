update 1-germany set to have at least 2 lng terminals -minister
adds quote detail nordstream berlin feb reuters german economy minister peter altmaier said on tuesday he was optimistic that germany would build two terminals in the foreseeable future to import liquefied natural gas lng
as germany phases out nuclear power and coal it is increasingly turning to gas to compliment renewable energy sources
it is under pressure especially from the united states to cut its dependence on russian gas and buy in lng
altmaier told a meeting with german and energy officials and industry lobbyists that germany was weighing up the extent of state subsidies and regulations before private investors build the terminals needed for lng imports
of three sites under consideration brunsbuettel stade and wilhelmshaven altmaier was confident terminals would be built at two in the foreseeable future
all three projects are being carefully considered and examined he said
i am quite optimistic that at least two of the terminals will be realised within a very foreseeable period of altmaier made clear that the question of lng was a separate issue to nord stream pipeline backed by germany which will bring russian gas to europe under the baltic sea bypassing ukrainian pipelines
ukraine is concerned that the km mile pipeline will lead to a dramatic loss in transport revenues but germany is trying to reassure kiev that gas will still be transported from russia through ukraine s existing pipeline
the intention is to come as soon as possible to a new agreement between russia and ukraine he said
