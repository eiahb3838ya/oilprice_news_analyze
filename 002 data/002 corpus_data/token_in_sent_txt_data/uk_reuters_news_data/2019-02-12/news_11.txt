one of the oldest u.s. refineries in trouble again in philadelphia -court filings
new york reuters philadelphia energy solutions inc owner of the largest and oldest refinery on the east coast is facing another financial crisis just months after emerging from a controversial bankruptcy according to two sources and a reuters review of court filings
pes which exited bankruptcy in august saw its cash balance fall to million at the end of down from million just three months earlier a million decline according to a financial report filed late last month
the company entered bankruptcy roughly a year ago with million cash on hand court documents show
refineries based on the east coast suffer from difficult economics due to the cost of shipping crude oil from west texas or canada but pes has had other problems at the plant in south philadelphia including weak gasoline margins and high debt costs
the company filed for bankruptcy in january blaming its woes largely on the costs of complying with the renewable fuel standard a law that requires refiners to either blend biofuels like ethanol into fuel or purchase credits called rins from competitors who do
pes does not have those blending capabilities so it has to pay for credits
but a reuters analysis showed other factors played a role in the bankruptcy including the withdrawal of more than million in payments from the company by its investor owners
after filing for bankruptcy the company was given a waiver for half of its million in liabilities related to biofuels credits by the environmental protection agency
poor gasoline margins have hurt the company s bottom line as well
pes s weak cash position forced the refiner to significantly scale back a planned million maintenance project that began in january according to two sources familiar with the plant s operations
refiners perform maintenance to keep units operating reliably and safely protecting themselves from costly unplanned outages
i am not surprised that they are economically struggling once again but i didn t expect it to happen so soon christina simeone a director at the kleinman center for energy policy said
in the last three months of while pes saw its cash balance fall by million the compliance credits were trading at lows
they having financial difficulties when rin prices dropped percent
it pretty damming evidence against their bankruptcy claims that the rfs is the primary claim in filing bankruptcy said simeone who authored a report last year that predicted the refinery would close by due to poor economics
the site has been home to a refinery since
pes spokeswoman cherice corley said the company declined to comment
east coast refiners like pes lack access to cheaper crude that refiners in other parts of the country enjoy which inflicts greater pain on the region s industry when margins are low
delta air lines refinery in nearby trainer pennsylvania lost million in the fourth quarter
the company is considering selling the plant sources recently told reuters
pes recently secured a million loan from bardin hill investment partners formerly halcyon capital management one of the plant s owners two sources told reuters
the company still has more million in debt most of which comes due in
giant carlyle group lp rescued the refinery from closure in betting they could tap cheap shale oil out of north dakota and turn a hefty profit
the bet proved lucrative in the early years but once the discount on north dakota s oil eroded due to better transport options pes s bottom line started to suffer
carlyle became a minority owner once the company emerged from bankruptcy
deutsche bank ag and bardin hill are the primary owners now
bardin hill did not respond to requests for comment deutsche bank declined to comment
