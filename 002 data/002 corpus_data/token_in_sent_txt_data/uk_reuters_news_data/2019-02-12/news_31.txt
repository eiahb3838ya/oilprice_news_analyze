corrected-interview-dominion aims to cut u.s. methane releases by 50 pct by 2030
corrects headline to say releases instead of leaks by scott disavino feb reuters dominion energy inc said on tuesday it plans to cut the amount of methane escaping from its natural gas wells pipelines and other infrastructure by percent over the next decade as part of its effort to combat global warming
the company one of the biggest power and gas utilities even held contests among its business units to determine how much methane emissions they could reduce said diane leopold president and ceo of dominion s gas infrastructure group
rather than focus on saving money which drove some of our early methane emission programs we started thinking about sustainability and methane reductions leopold said
methane the primary component of natural gas is a major force in global warming because it has more than times the potential of carbon dioxide in the first years after it escapes into the atmosphere scientists say
the energy industry is the largest source of methane emissions according to the environmental protection agency
however unlike carbon dioxide there is a market for methane
the more methane kept in pipes the more gas companies have to sell to customers an additional incentive to reduce leaks
dominion said the program s goal is to prevent more than metric tons of methane or billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas from entering the atmosphere between and
the company said that would be equivalent to taking million cars off the road for a year
dominion has million gas distribution customers in west virginia ohio utah wyoming idaho and the carolinas over miles of gas pipelines and trillion cubic feet of underground storage and production
