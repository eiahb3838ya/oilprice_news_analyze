update 3-south africa's eskom extends power cuts as crisis persists
south african state power utility in crisis ramaphosa plans to split firm to boost efficiency power cuts due to unplanned outages diesel shortage eskom hopes to end power cuts this week official adds minister of public enterprises comments by alexander winning johannesburg feb reuters south african power utility eskom implemented major electricity cuts for a third straight day on tuesday as a shortage of generating capacity exposed the frailty of the struggling firm despite government promises to revive it
president cyril ramaphosa is trying to reform eskom which supplies more than percent of the power in africa s most industrialised economy but is drowning in more than billion of debt to lift the economy before an election in may
the utility said it would cut megawatts mw of power from the national grid from gmt on tuesday likely until gmt a day after cutting mw in the worst power cuts seen in several years
around a third of eskom s mw capacity is offline
public enterprises minister pravin gordhan told parliament on tuesday that south africa had asked italian energy firm enel for technical assistance to end the power cuts
enel will be sending two to three coal power station engineers to south africa shortly gordhan said
these outages have a massive impact on the economy from mining big industries manufacturing to small businesses like coffee shops he said
a senior generation official andrew etzinger told reuters that around mw was offline because of problems while approximately mw was out of service because of planned maintenance
a further mw was unavailable because of a shortage of diesel
oil company petrosa said it was in talks with eskom over emergency diesel supplies
the power crisis prompted an urgent meeting of eskom s board of directors and executives with gordhan on monday when it also pummelled the rand currency
on tuesday the rand was little changed against the dollar
etzinger said eskom was aiming to end the power cuts by the end of the week by bringing some generating units back online
the cuts are prompting frustration among ordinary south africans and shop workers many of whom do not have access to backup power sources like diesel generators
we re struggling said eunice mashaba a manager of a textile shop north of johannesburg
yesterday the power went off at half past four so we had to close the shop early
today we came in and there was no power
most of my customers don t carry cash they have to swipe and the card machine doesn t some firms in the mining sector the backbone of the country s economy are looking at alternatives to reduce their dependence on eskom
miner harmony gold said on tuesday that it was in talks to build a mw solar plant to supply power to some of its assets in an effort to cut its electricity costs and dependence on eskom
our eskom bill is massive
to replace eskom would be a fallacy we won t be able to do that
however where we have projects we can start building solar plants harmony chief executive peter steenkamp said at a presentation of the company s results
ramaphosa who announced a plan last week to split eskom into three separate entities in an effort to make it more efficient has said the latest power cuts are most worrying
the president s plan to split eskom faces opposition from powerful labour unions and from within his ruling african national congress party while some analysts have said a bolder approach is needed to address the financial rot at the utility
etzinger said eskom was for now treating unplanned outages at some of its power stations as technical breakdowns despite speculation from analysts that disgruntled union members could have sabotaged some units
there s no reason to believe it s sabotage he said
