update 1-dominion aims to cut u.s. methane releases by 50 pct by 2030
reuters dominion energy inc said on tuesday it plans to cut the amount of methane escaping from its natural gas wells pipelines and other infrastructure by percent over the next decade as part of its effort to combat global warming
the company one of the biggest power and gas utilities held contests among its business units to determine how much methane emissions they could reduce said diane leopold president and ceo of dominion s gas infrastructure group
rather than focus on saving money which drove some of our early methane emission programs we started thinking about sustainability and methane reductions leopold said
methane the primary component of natural gas has more than times the potential of carbon dioxide in the first years after it escapes into the atmosphere scientists say
the energy industry is the largest source of methane emissions according to the environmental protection agency epa
however there is a market for methane
the more methane kept in pipes the more gas companies can sell to customers
dominion said the goal is to prevent more than metric tons of methane or billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas from entering the atmosphere between and
the company said that would be equivalent to taking million cars off the road for a year
dominion has million gas distribution customers in west virginia ohio utah wyoming idaho and the carolinas over miles of gas pipelines and trillion cubic feet of underground storage and production
leopold said the company will cut methane emissions across all its gas businesses by reducing venting during planned maintenance and inspections replacing older equipment and expanding leak detection and repair programs among other things
the amount of methane that leaked from gas systems was about percent to percent of the country s total output according to studies by the epa and the environmental defense fund an advocacy group
leopold said the company did not want to estimate the cost of its programs since the goal was to reduce methane emissions
we wanted to find out how much methane we could save not the dollars we could save leopold said
she said dominion held competitions to design programs to reduce methane emissions
in one the company asked its businesses to figure out how much emissions they could reduce with million
dominion said this initiative builds on previous efforts to cut methane on the gas side of its business and carbon emissions on the power side
the company is also working with customers to help them cut their methane emissions
dominion has partnered with smithfield foods to invest at least million in north carolina virginia and utah to capture waste methane from hog farms that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and convert it into renewable natural gas to heat homes and power local industries
the trump administration meanwhile is rolling back rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions saying lighter regulations will boost economic growth
opponents say this will worsen global warming
with or without regulations we re going to proceed with our programs leopold said
