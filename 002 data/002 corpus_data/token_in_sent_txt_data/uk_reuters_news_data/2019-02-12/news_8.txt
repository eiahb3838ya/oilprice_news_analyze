update 3-acting pentagon chief reassures iraqis after anger over trump remarks
baghdad reuters acting defence chief patrick shanahan told iraqi leaders that washington understood its forces were in iraq at baghdad s invitation aiming to steady relations after president donald trump said troops were needed to keep an eye on iran
shanahan met prime minister adel abdul mahdi during an unannounced trip to baghdad on tuesday
i made very clear that we recognise their sovereignty their focus on independence and that we are there at the invitation of the government shanahan told reporters
trump infuriated iraqi politicians this month by saying that a presence was needed in iraq to observe iran
washington which occupied iraq from now has around troops in iraq at the request of the baghdad government to help fight against islamic state
iraq is an ally of both the united states and iran and its politics are often dominated by efforts to balance relations with two powerful countries that are bitter enemies
trump s suggestion that iran was the target of the presence in iraq was denounced across the political spectrum in baghdad last week including by abdul mahdi
president barham salih said the troops must stick to their state mission politicians in iraq s parliament pressed demands that the mission be scaled back
the uproar came just months after trump angered iraqi leaders on his only visit to the country so far
on the day after christmas trump stopped only at a air base in the remote desert
unlike predecessors barack obama and george bush he skipped the capital baghdad and met no iraqi officials
shanahan said the topic of troops in iraq and trump s iran comments did not come up during his talks with abdul mahdi but the prime minister told him that iraq needed to maintain strong relations with both washington and tehran
there is activity in their legislature the discussions have been should they restrict the number of forces in iraq and i wanted to make clear to abdul mahdi that we recognise our role we understand that we are there by invitation shanahan said
speaking after meeting with shanahan abdul mahdi said he respected the decisions of the parliament
the government has its view and the political blocs have theirs he said
officials have the middle east in recent months to reassure allies that washington remains committed to the region after trump announced in december that he would abruptly withdraw the troops from syria
that decision was opposed by top aides including defence secretary jim mattis who quit leaving his deputy shanahan in charge of the pentagon
shanahan met with military commanders while in iraq to get an update on the fight against islamic state
fighters have mounted an attack against islamic state s last bastion in eastern syria
officials have long estimated that the syria pullout could take until sometime in march or april to execute fully but have been reluctant to set an exact timeline given battlefield conditions
islamic state was declared defeated in iraq in but continues to wage insurgent attacks in some areas
