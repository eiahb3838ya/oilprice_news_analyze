update 2-opec cuts oil supply steeply but sees growing 2019 headwinds
london reuters opec said on tuesday it had cut oil production steeply under a global supply deal although it flagged headwinds confronting its efforts to prevent a glut this year including weaker demand and higher rival output
in a monthly report opec said its oil output fell almost barrels per day in january to million bpd
that is still slightly more than the demand opec expects for its crude on average in
worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies including russia agreed in december to make supply cuts
under the deal opec is lowering output by bpd from
in the report opec cut its forecast for world economic growth by percentage point to percent and highlighted a range of headwinds such as a slowdown in global trade
some recent positive developments could support the global economy at its current level including the recovery in oil prices possible progress in trade negotiations and monetary tightening by the federal reserve opec said in the report
nevertheless this would not lift the global economy beyond the growth oil extended a rally on tuesday above a barrel
crude has risen from less than in december supported by the saudi opec cuts and involuntary declines despite concerns about slowing demand
the supply cut was a policy after the producer alliance known as agreed in june to boost supply amid pressure from president donald trump to lower prices and cover an expected shortfall in iranian exports
opec changed course after prices slid from a barrel in october making the producers wary of a new glut
an cut from january had got rid of an earlier surplus
in a sign of excess supply opec s report said oil inventories in developed economies were above the average in december
the biggest drop in opec supply last month came from saudi arabia and amounted to bpd the report showed
with the supply cut delivered in january the opec members expected to cut supply under the deal achieved percent compliance according to a reuters calculation a high rate by opec s past standards
this could rise in coming months as saudi arabia voluntarily lowers supply by more than it agreed
saudi arabia plans to pump around million bpd in march more than bpd below its target under the deal its energy minister told the financial times
and further declines in iran libya and venezuela exempt from the supply pact could give a tailwind
opec said in the report that demand for its crude would decline to million bpd a drop of bpd from its last report as rivals such as the united states boost output and the slowing economy limits demand
this implies that the global market would see a slight surplus of about bpd in should opec keep pumping at january s rate although other things being equal the saudi plan to reduce supply further will offset this
opec forecast global oil demand would grow by million bpd in down bpd from last month
producers will boost output by million bpd more than expected previously
