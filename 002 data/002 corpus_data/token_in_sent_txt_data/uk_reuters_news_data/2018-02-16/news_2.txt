u.s. sets largest offshore oil, gas lease auction for march
washington feb reuters the trump administration on friday said it would offer the largest oil and gas offshore auction in history on march for areas in federal waters off the gulf coast less than a year after a similar sale yielded little corporate interest
the interior department said it would offer million acres mln hectares offshore texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida for oil and gas development an auction that includes all available unleased areas in the gulf of mexico
the blocks are from to miles to km offshore and in waters to feet to meters deep
the department announced the auction in october without an exact date
the sale is in support of president donald trump s america first offshore energy strategy which aims to reduce energy imports and boost jobs in the industry
but offshore drilling is expensive in a time of relatively low oil prices held in check partially by plentiful supplies of onshore petroleum which is cheaper to produce
a lease sale in august last year got a tepid response from oil companies
the offer of million acres received million in high bids for tracts covering acres hectares
bureau of ocean energy management spokesman john filostrat has said that interior hopes for a healthy number of bids more so than we did in reporting by timothy gardner editing by marguerita choy
