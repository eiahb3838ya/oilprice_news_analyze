interview-osce calls for effort to jumpstart ukraine peace process
munich feb reuters urgent efforts are needed to jumpstart the peace process in eastern ukraine the head of the organisation for security and in europe said on friday warning that continued daily ceasefire violations could spiral out of control
thomas greminger who took over as secretary general of the osce last july told reuters he hoped a meeting by top officials from germany france russia and ukraine later on friday could help end a political impasse on the crisis
a separatist insurgency led to fighting that has killed people since
while combat mostly ended in after france germany russia and ukraine sponsored a ceasefire agreement in the belarus capital minsk casulties are still reported on a near daily basis in incidents along the front line
the osce a european security body tasked with monitoring the agreement still sees an average of ceasefire violations a day greminger told reuters in an interview at the annual munich security conference
this has to stop greminger said
what we desperately need is another political impulse he said adding that it should come from the four countries that sponsored minsk
efforts to push for implementation of the peace deal have stalled amid the ongoing struggle to form a government in germany after september national elections
but officials from the four countries will meet on thursday evening on the sidelines of the munich conference
i would look forward to seeing germany again assuming a leadership role ideally together with france and then i think we have a fair chance that the russian federation and ukraine could come along greminger said
the parties have failed to withdraw heavy military equipment from the lines of conflict as agreed in the ceasefire agreement he said
there was also a big risk that shelling could inadvertantly result in a catastrophic chemical spill at a water filtration plant near the front he said
the risk is growing that one day you will have an incident that gets out of control he said
greminger said he worried about a general increase in tensions between russia and the west in the region at a time when both have staged snap military exercises
the osce set up during the cold war as a forum that would include both sides is still one of the few bodies which regularly brings russia together with the united states and its western allies
it has initiated a dialogue aimed at lowering military and political risks which greminger said could lead to some measures in months with an eye to working on conventional arms reduction in years
but the prerequisite was rebuilding trust among the parties greminger said
we need some political leadership and we need to do that now because we are on the brink of major conflict he said
greminger said he hoped ukraine could agree at friday s meeting to some concessions on a dispute over visas that prompted russian military officers to withdraw from a ceasefire control group in december
