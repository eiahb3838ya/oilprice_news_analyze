corrected-u.s. spending bill expands carbon tax credit, boosting oil producers
houston reuters a addition to the budget deal approved last week will help occidental petroleum corp and other oil producers by more than tripling a tax credit for injecting carbon dioxide back into the earth to increase crude output
the expansion although supported by environmentalists and energy producers had failed to move out of congress during the presidential election
its passage now likely will further boost already surging oil output in a year that production is forecast to hit million barrels per day
the injection process used for more than years to prolong output from traditional oil wells also is being tested by oxy and others as a way to speed more oil production from shale wells
president donald trump last week signed the spending plan into law
it boosts for years an existing tax credit to per metric ton of carbon dioxide injected underground up from per ton
this will be an economic driver for our nation said north dakota senator heidi heitkamp a democrat who had pushed for the credit s expansion with a bipartisan group of senators
it will hopefully push a lot of innovative technologies across a range of industries not just in coal or oxy denbury resources inc and others inject more than billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into traditional oil wells many of which came online more than years ago
the method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from plants and forces it back into the fields
that helps drive more oil to the surface
the technique one of several enhanced oil recovery eor strategies that can prolong the productive life of oilfields underpins more than five percent of oil output or about barrels per day according to energy consultancy advanced resources international
eor can help firms extract between percent and percent of all the oil held in a reservoir
that s far more than the percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling according to the department of energy
this legislation helps to ensure domestic energy security vicki hollub oxy s chief executive said in a statement
eor increases a producer s costs but because eor wells pump consistently for decades their value over time can exceed shale wells whose production quickly tapers off
oxy has not published anticipated financial benefits from the tax credit s expansion and wall street analysts who track the company have not offered any estimates
but partly because of its carbon operations oxy was able to raise its dividend during the oil price downturn from to
oxy this week swung to a profit that met wall street s expectations
