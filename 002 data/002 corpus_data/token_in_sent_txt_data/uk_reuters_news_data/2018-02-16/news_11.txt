update 2-merkel sees no threat in new gas pipe to russia, poland disagrees
berlin reuters the planned nord stream gas pipeline connecting germany and russia poses no threat to europe s energy security chancellor angela merkel said on friday publicly disagreeing with her polish counterpart
poland ukraine and baltic states fear the pipeline to be laid under the baltic sea would increase europe s dependence on russian gas and could cut off ukraine still fighting a conflict with separatists from gas transit fees
we had different views on the nord stream issue merkel told reporters at a joint press conference with polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki in berlin
we think this is an economic project
we are also for energy diversification
we also want ukraine to continue to have transit gas traffic but we believe nord stream poses no danger to diversification she said
morawiecki stressed the shared interests of poland and its main trade partner germany but disagreed with merkel that nord stream would diversify gas supplies
this is gas from the same source but via a different route
we indicate the risks related to cutting ukraine from transit he said adding however that merkel s comments on assuring ukraine s gas traffic fees were important
morawiecki has called for the united states to impose sanctions on the planned pipeline which secretary of state rex tillerson said last month the government sees as a threat to europe s energy security
once nord stream is going to be built russian president vladimir putin can do with ukraine whatever he wants morawiecki told reporters later on friday
and then we have potentially his army on the eastern border of the more than people have been killed since in the conflict in eastern ukraine
poland a member of the european union and nato shares a land border with ukraine
while the kremlin has denied providing military support for separatists in eastern ukraine the united states has sanctioned russian firms over moscow s role in the ukraine conflict and foreign companies helping russian energy exploration
separately nordic nations have voiced security concerns over the pipeline being laid near their shores under the baltic
germany and austria have focussed more on the commercial benefits of having more cheap gas arguing there could be little harm from an additional pipeline
german energy groups uniper and wintershall austria s omv group shell and france s engie have invested in the km pipeline
