air france-klm positive on ticket prices, takes pensions charge
feb reuters air expects ticket prices to be positive in the first quarter of this year and will offer more seats on routes to asia and latin america to meet demand although competition from trains was biting in france
the airline reported on friday an operating result of billion euros billion up percent but slightly missing the average analyst forecast for billion euros in a company compiled consensus
the group reported a net loss of million euros for due to a billion euro charge linked to a new pension deal for klm pilots and cabin crew
like other major european airlines the carrier benefited from low oil prices and strong travel demand last year while the collapse of monarch and air berlin has removed some competition from the market
air is also benefiting from a return of travellers from asia and latin america
it plans to increase capacity by percent overall on its main passenger network this year
we have been helped by the good environment chief financial officer frederic gagey said adding air s increase in profit was also helped by stable unit costs
the group had set an initial target early last year to reduce unit costs by percent but added caveats to that at its results
it said it was aiming for a reduction of percent this year excluding the impact of currency fuel and pension charges
gagey said on flights were up percentage point in february up percentage points in march down percentage point in april because of easter and up percent for may
analysts expect air to come under pressure from rising fuel costs this year and expansion of rivals in paris and amsterdam
it will also have to negotiate increased pressure on labour costs with unions having called for a strike on feb to support demands for a percent pay increase
gagey said unit revenues in the domestic market in france had come under pressure from new train routes to bordeaux and that the group was closely watching the development of new players
but it seems that launching flights without connecting services is challenging gagey said pointing to norwegian air shuttle which on thursday reported a bigger than expected loss for the last quarter of
traditional rivals iag and lufthansa are due to report over the next few weeks
