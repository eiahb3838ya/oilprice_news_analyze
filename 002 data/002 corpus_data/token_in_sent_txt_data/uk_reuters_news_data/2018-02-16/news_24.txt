update 3-audi chairman rubbishes report that ceo stadler to be removed
berlin reuters audi chairman matthias mueller appealed to workers to ignore a media report that chief executive rupert stadler was about to be ousted hoping to quell further unrest at the volkswagen group
german tabloid bild reported on its front page on friday that stadler would leave in april because of his handling of the diesel emissions affair in which audi played a prominent role
the report said stadler would however be given a new role as vw group finance chief
in a message to audi staff mueller who is also ceo of parent company volkswagen said the luxury carmaker needed the full concentration of management and workers to overcome its current challenges under stadler s proven leadership
please pay no attention to the personnel speculation spread by the media which lacks any foundation mueller said in the message sent to reuters by email
volkswagen has repeatedly attempted to draw a line under a scandal that broke out in when it admitted cheating tests in the united states to conceal the amount of noxious gases emitted by some of its vehicles
under mueller who took over when martin winterkorn quit days after the scandal broke the leading german carmaker has settled the main legal case to result from the cheating and sought to turn the page with an initiative
but the dieselgate crisis refuses to die reigniting conflicts between the powerful family management trade union and political interests who vie for the upper hand in the group
on thursday volkswagen s top labor representative said the company s drive to improve accountability seen by investors as a major plank in vw s ability to regain trust had made zero progress
sources have said that mueller is growing frustrated by a lack of support for his reform efforts and by the lingering scandal
vw chairman hans dieter poetsch said on monday there was no reason to question mueller s position
the revelation last month that german carmakers including volkswagen had commissioned tests in which monkeys were exposed to toxic diesel fumes were a stark reminder that vw had not yet put its past behind it
and last week audi s headquarters were searched by german prosecutors widening their inquiry into the manipulation of tests
stadler ran finance at audi for four years before becoming ceo in
he was a confidant of and former assistant to chairman ferdinand piech the scion of volkswagen s controlling clan who was himself ousted in
his position as ceo has been questioned before but so far audi s board has rallied around him
bild said stadler would be moved to take charge of vw group s finance portfolio currently run by frank witter a former head of the carmaker s financial services division
witter is well regarded among investors and uncontroversial with vw s powerful unions a source close to vw said
sources close to audi said there had been no discussion on the supervisory board about replacing stadler
the controlling panels at audi and parent vw are due to hold separate regular meetings next week
porsche se the group through which the billionaire porsche and piech families control their majority stake in vw declined comment
a senior source close to vw told reuters last week that stadler retained the backing of the clan
bild said that chief winfried vahland who quit the vw group weeks after the scandal broke out in declining to take up his post as north america chief was favorite to succeed stadler
should vahland refuse the job bmw development chief klaus froehlich was a possible alternative it said
but bmw said froehlich was not a candidate to replace stadler
reuters could not immediately reach vahland who has kept a low profile after quitting volkswagen
audi vw s main profit contributor did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the united states until november two months after the scandal at parent vw was revealed
audi developed the bigger liter diesel engines used in about vw audi and porsche models that in were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed emissions limits
