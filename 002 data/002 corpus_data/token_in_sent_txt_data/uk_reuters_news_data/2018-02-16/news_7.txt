albania plans to launch power exchange next january
tirana feb reuters albania plans to launch a power exchange next january and the government will choose partners to run it alongside the transmission system operator a government official said on friday
albania s parliament passed legislation on thursday paving the way for the government to move ahead with its plans for the exchange and meet a deadline set under a cooperation agreement with other balkan countries known as the western balkans six
we are optimistic we ll have the exchange by january
this is a difficult process entela cipa an energy specialist and adviser to the energy minister told reuters
dependant entirely on hydropower albania has been a net power importer since it dumped communism years ago except for when it exported for the first time
launching the plans for the exchange became possible after power generation transmission and distribution monopolies invested more than million euros million to upgrade their networks and cut losses
the albanian power exchange will be able to take on as shareholders international energy operators other transmission operators and also international financial institutions
cipa said the exchange will trade and intraday products
nord pool consulting is advising on the project
albania and neighbouring kosovo decided last november their transmission operators would own an equal share of the exchange she said
we are open to partnerships because international ones provide guarantees since the bourse of a small country like ours might find it hard to draw high trade volumes she added
albania is also talking about possible partnerships with montenegro and serbia
initially the exchange will work with industrial consumers which pay unregulated prices and which represent around percent of the power consumed in the country
