rotterdam port ceo "preparing for the worst" with brexit
rotterdam reuters the port of rotterdam is bracing for a british exit from the european union without any deal on customs and looking at measures such as hiring extra customs agents and dozens of fresh produce inspectors
ceo allard castelein said he had had two meetings in the past week with policy makers the cabinet the government and supporting officials about the consequences of a hard brexit which would move britain away from eu rules
if you have days left then you don t have time to embrace hypotheses that it will turn out pretty good in the end he told reporters
britain is due to exit the eu on march
let the government negotiate for the best we are preparing for the prime minister theresa may plans to take britain out of the eu s single market and customs union after an initial brexit transition period
the eu says that will mean tariffs and other barriers for goods shipped across the english channel
depending on the trade rules adopted by britain rotterdam and other transit points could need more customs officials to check produce and more agricultural inspectors because animals and products such as meat could need separate approval before entering the eu
britain is the netherlands second largest trading partner after germany with more than billion euros worth of annual bilateral trade according to government statistics
much of that trade flows through rotterdam europe s largest port
the dutch government s economic policy analysis agency forecasts that brexit will cost the netherlands percent of gdp by
while dutch prime minister mark rutte has said he favours a negotiated exit deal he has also underlined that he fully supports the eu s single negotiator in talks with britain frenchman michel barnier
castelein was speaking after the port reported results on thursday that showed strong growth in shipping containers
he said that tens of thousands of dutch companies that trade with britain via the port have never known an import or export document and would need education
castelein said hiring extra staff in customs and agricultural inspection was a process that needed to begin well in advance
in addition the port is looking at how to reorganise physical space to prevent congestion including creating new areas outside the terminals to load and unload
