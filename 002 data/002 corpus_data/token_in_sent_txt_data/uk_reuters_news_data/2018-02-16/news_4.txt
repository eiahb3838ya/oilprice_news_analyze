exclusive-mexico foreign minister heads to caribbean to win over venezuelan allies -official
mexico city reuters mexico s foreign minister will travel to jamaica grenada and saint lucia in march a mexican official said on thursday as part of efforts to erode venezuela s influence in the caribbean
meanwhile cuban diplomats will visit mexico in march to discuss the regional impact of the crisis in venezuela the official said
the cuban embassy in mexico city said the trip was not yet confirmed but that the two countries have regular bilateral meetings
still there are no signs that cuba a steadfast ally of caracas is ready to turn its back on venezuelan president nicolas maduro
mexican foreign minister luis videgaray s planned trip follows a visit to latin america and the caribbean earlier this month by secretary of state rex tillerson who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against venezuela could be mitigated in the caribbean
the mexican foreign minister s trip represents the latest development in pressure on maduro who retains loyalty from some caribbean nations that have long benefited from caracas oil largess and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts
the message is venezuela is not the only country that can help caribbean nations that if there s a crisis in venezuela they have more friends said the mexican official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the undisclosed trip
in a statement mexico s foreign ministry said videgaray was planning trips to the caribbean
the foreign ministry is eager for those trips to be arranged and so possible dates are being sought it said adding that several caribbean countries had invited the minister for work visits since last year
the foreign ministries of jamaica grenada and saint lucia could not be reached for comment
videgaray has led mexico s efforts to try and improve cooperation with its top trade partner on security immigration and foreign policy hoping to convince the united states to take a softer stance on the north american free trade agreement nafta that underpins the majority of mexican exports
president donald trump has threatened to quit the pact if it can not be improved to benefit workers
on his way to jamaica tillerson said the united states was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on venezuelan oil adding that canada mexico and the united states were studying how to mitigate the impact of such a move
restrictions on venezuela s oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the opec member which is gripped by severe shortages of food and medicine
such sanctions could also hurt refineries that process venezuelan oil
sanctions have so far focused on individual members of maduro s government and a ban on buying new venezuelan debt
in a june meeting in cancun foreign ministers from the organization of american states oas failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing venezuela with only countries backing the proposal shy of the threshold
saint kitts and nevis saint vincent and the grenadines and dominica voted against the resolution while grenada haiti the dominican republic trinidad and tobago and antigua and barbuda abstained
jamaica and saint lucia backed the proposal
officials from other caribbean nations will be present at videgaray s jamaican stop the mexican official said adding that the caribbean trip represents an attempt to end the stalemate in the june oas meeting
it s a result of cancun the official said
there was a bloc in the caribbean that wasn t pulling in the same direction as the reuters reported last year that mexico was looking at the possibility of replacing venezuela s petrocaribe programme that provided cheap loans for oil to caribbean nations and has helped maduro retain diplomatic support in the region
however the mexican official said it was still not clear how mexico could furnish caribbean nations with cheap energy given the country s struggling domestic fuel production and that mexico relies on oil income for about a fifth of the government budget
the energy ministry remains unconvinced by the oil diplomacy plan led by videgaray but there are signs it is becoming more flexible the official said
