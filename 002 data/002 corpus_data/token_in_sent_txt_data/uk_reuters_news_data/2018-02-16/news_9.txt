update 3-hezbollah says lebanon must be firm in israel energy dispute
beirut reuters hezbollah on friday urged lebanon to stand firm in its offshore energy dispute with israel and warned it could act against israeli oil facilities if necessary as the mediates between the two countries
in a televised address the leader of the movement sayyed hassan nasrallah described the issue as a battle for all of lebanon
if lebanon s higher defence council were to decide that israeli offshore oil and gas plants should be forbidden from working i promise they would stop working within hours he told a rally
diplomats have been mediating between lebanon and israel after a spike in tensions that also involved a dispute over a border wall which israel is building and hezbollah s growing arsenal
nasrallah said lebanon s territorial waters and efforts to explore for oil and gas in a block that lies along the contested marine border with israel has become the most pressing issue
lebanon signed its first exploration and production agreements last week with a consortium of france s total italy s eni and russia s novatek
nasrallah s speech came after lebanon s senior leaders met with a envoy on friday to discuss the dispute
a top lebanese official told the diplomat that current proposals for a resolution to the energy issue were not acceptable
the powerful shi ite hezbollah is part of lebanon s coalition government which includes almost all the country s main political parties
israel sees hezbollah as the biggest security threat on its borders and the united states regards it as a terrorist group
but washington also supports the lebanese military funding its forces partly as a counterweight to hezbollah
nasrallah said lebanese officials should not fear israeli military might but should warn officials of hezbollah s own strength
he also said the united states was not an honest broker and that lebanese officials should not be fooled by their mediation
if the americans come and say you must be responsive so that i restrain israel from you tell the americans they must accept lebanon s demands so that we hold hezbollah back from israel he said
the oil wealth is for all the secretary of state rex tillerson visited lebanon on thursday and said the united states was engaging with lebanon and israel to ensure their frontier remained calm
after his visit the acting assistant secretary of state david satterfield met senior lebanese officials on friday
but parliament speaker nabih berri reiterated the state s rejection of current proposals as unacceptable
this was an apparent reference to a maritime demarcation line proposed by diplomat frederic hof in
the line would give lebanon around two thirds and israel around one third of a disputed triangular area of sea of around sq km square miles
berri whose position is the powerful in government insisted during his meeting with satterfield that the maritime border should be drawn up through a committee that stemmed from a ceasefire state news agency nna said
he said he wanted to see a similar process as produced the blue line border which marks israel s military withdrawal from southern lebanon in
lebanon has hoped to explore for energy in its waters since other countries started finding gas in the area in but its plans were put on hold by political paralysis in beirut
it restarted a stalled tender process for five of its offshore blocks including three along the disputed border with israel last year after a political deal that led to the formation of a new government
lebanon has one of the world s highest ratios in the world and its economic growth is very weak
one of the blocks signed last week block lies partly in waters disputed by israel
an israeli minister has described the decision to explore there as very provocative
lebanon s energy minister has said the dispute with israel would not stop lebanon benefiting from potential undersea reserves in block
consortium operator total said it would not drill the block s first well near the disputed zone
