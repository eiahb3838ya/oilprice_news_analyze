update 2-allianz considers group's stance on coal insurance
munich reuters germany s allianz is considering whether to stop insuring new coal power plants but told environmental campaigners it would stay in the business for now
the percent slide in earnings reported by the insurer on friday brought into sharp focus the debate raging within its munich headquarters over how to balance the need to maximize profit with the desire to address environmental concerns
the company has put together a working group to study the issue of insuring new coal plants a spokeswoman said on friday with a decision expected in late april or early may
allianz s chief executive oliver baete was a leader in a drive to exit coal investments several years ago a significant move by one of europe s largest investors
it s not a question of if but rather a question of when and how to manage the transition from coal said a source familiar with baete s thinking

they need to be insured said board member guenther thallinger
we believe that with dialogue with various companies over time we can hopefully work down to a much lower level of coal he said
campaigners remain unhappy with allianz s stance
