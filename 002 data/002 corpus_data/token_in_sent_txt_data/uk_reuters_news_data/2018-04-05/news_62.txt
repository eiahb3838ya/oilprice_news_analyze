it said in december it had taken a preliminary decision to withdraw from the wca pending a full review
the miner came under pressure from australian green groups last year to leave any industry associations with policies that fail to match the company s support of the paris climate accord
in light of the material difference identified by the review and the narrow range of activities of benefit to bhp from membership bhp has reached a final view that it will cease membership of the wca bhp said in a statement
bhp said that it while it had identified material differences in its stance with the chamber of commerce the largest business lobby there were other benefits from the activities with the group
on the basis of these broader benefits and in light of the chamber s willingness to engage further on climate and energy issues through an invitation extended to bhp to join its energy and environment committee bhp has determined to remain a member of the chamber bhp said
bhp said it would also continue to work with the minerals council of australia in relation to its updated energy and climate policy position
