canadian cannabis deals boost boutique investment banks in 1st quarter
toronto reuters a slew of equity capital markets offerings in the cannabis sector helped smaller canadian investment banks and boutiques climb up the league table rankings in the first quarter according to thomson reuters data released on thursday
offerings accounted for about percent of overall canadian deal activity in a the first quarter when the total dropped percent from a year ago to c billion the data showed
volumes were largely hurt by weakness in the heavyweight energy sector
it was the slowest first quarter since at least
the decline of energy issuance has been dramatic relative to last year
if this keeps up it will be a tough year overall from a volume perspective said sante corona executive managing director and head of equity capital markets at td securities
td bank canaccord genuity and credit suisse took the top three positions in the equity capital markets rankings advising on deals worth c million c million and c million respectively
national bank of canada gmp capital and eight capital rounded out the top six
canaccord advised on deals the largest number
the strong performance of canaccord gmp and eight capital is unusual because the six biggest canadian banks tend to take all the top spots often only swapping places
with the exception of bank of montreal which has started participating in cannabis deals the major banks have stayed away
but the strong contribution from the cannabis sector which includes dozens of companies highlights the business opportunity it presents and all the major banks are evaluating the risks and benefits sources close to the big banks said over the past week on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive client matters
it s an entrepreneurial business model attracting risk capital
so the big banks don t like to risk their capital with earlier stage companies said daniel daviau chief executive of canaccord and former of investment banking at cibc
daviau said robust mergers and acquisitions in the cannabis industry were driving equity offerings
cannabis companies have decided they need scale to attack the global market he said
bankers cited greater depth and breadth of institutional investor interest
we re seeing increasing acceptance of the marijuana industry by blue chip investors said steve ottaway managing director investment banking at gmp
it is a natural evolution of the sector as companies are becoming big enough and deals are becoming significant enough to attract mainstream investor jpmorgan asset management invested in a c million offering by medreleaf a major licensed producer of cannabis ottaway said
jpmorgan did not respond to a request for comment
