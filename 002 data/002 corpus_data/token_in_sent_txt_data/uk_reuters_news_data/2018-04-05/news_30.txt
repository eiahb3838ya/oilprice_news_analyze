indonesia blames coal ship for oil spill, not state energy firm
jakarta reuters a coal ship that dropped anchor off the coast of the indonesian port city of balikpapan on borneo island was likely to blame for an oil spill after dragging a pipeline more than meters and causing it to crack an energy ministry official said
indonesia declared a state of emergency this week after the spill and fire killed five fishermen
the environment ministry said the oil covered an area of nearly hectares and had polluted km of coastal ecosystems including mangrove wetlands and marine mammal habitats
we suspect the pipe was dragged by the ship that caught fire oil and gas director general djoko siswanto told reporters on thursday
at the time it was bad weather so they had to drop anchor siswanto said noting it was an area where ships were not supposed to anchor
siswanto did not identify the vessel but said it was a coal ship with a panama flag
balikpapan is a bustling mining and energy hub sitting on a shipping lane serving one of indonesia s biggest thermal coal mining regions
pertamina had at first said initial tests showed the oil was marine oil used in boats but on wednesday said a cracked underwater pipeline linked to its refinery in balikpapan was the source
by tuesday night around cubic meters of spilled oil had been contained by a team from several oil companies operating in the area and government agencies the environment ministry said
thick clumps of oil were still visible in some areas on thursday but much less than the several days prior environment minister siti nurbaya said in a statement
the ministry which is responsible for supervising the cleanup and compensation claims had asked pertamina to contain the remaining oil and help affected members of the community nurbaya said
oil and gas director general siswanto said the spill had been stopped and the remains of the oil spill are still being cleaned up
he did not estimate how much oil had spilled
the spill had reduced the operational capacity of the balikpapan oil refinery a pertamina official said
a second smaller undamaged pipeline running next to the broken pipe was being used to deliver crude to the refinery with additional oil supplied via tankers siswanto said
some green groups have criticized pertamina for not taking responsibility for the spill
siswanto said pertamina had been late in announcing the source of the oil but said the government was investigating the company that owned the vessel suspected of breaking the state company s pipeline
the vessel owners would be questioned and could be charged over the deaths resulting from the spill he said
it depends on who was to blame
it depends on the investigation he said
