north korea's kim told xi he wanted to resume six-party disarmament talks - nikkei
tokyo reuters north korean leader kim jong un told chinese president xi jinping during talks in beijing last week that he agreed to return to talks on his nation s nuclear programme and missile tests the nikkei newspaper said on thursday
months of chill between beijing and pyongyang appeared to suddenly vanish during kim s secretive visit with china saying that kim had pledged his commitment to denuclearisation
quoting multiple sources connected to china and north korea the nikkei said that according to documents issued after kim and xi met kim told xi that he agreed to resuming the talks which were last held in
north korea declared the talks dead at the time blaming aggression
the talks grouped the two koreas the united states russia japan and host china
the sources said it was also possible that kim could convey his willingness to resume the talks to president donald trump at a summit set to take place in may but that it was far from clear if that meant the talks would actually resume
chinese officials were not immediately able to comment
china has traditionally been secretive north korea s closest ally though ties have been frayed by kim s pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles and beijing s backing of tough sanctions in response
north korea has said in previous talks that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the united states removed its troops from south korea and withdrew its nuclear umbrella of deterrence from south korea and japan
some analysts have said trump s willingness to meet kim handed north korea a diplomatic win as the united states had insisted for years that any such summit be preceded by north korean steps to denuclearise
