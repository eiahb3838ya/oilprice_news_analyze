u.n. quietly steps up inspection of aid ships to yemen
deploying more inspectors monitors to check ship cargos aim is to ensure weapons are not smuggled to houthi fighters saudis say cooperating with un to bring aid to hodeidah port houthi movement has stepped up attacks against kingdom by stephanie nebehay geneva april reuters the united nations is beefing up its inspections of ships bringing humanitarian aid to yemen to ensure that no military items are being smuggled and to speed delivery of relief supplies and saudi officials say
the move comes as the armed houthi movement controlling much of northern yemen steps up attacks on the kingdom hitting a saudi oil tanker on a coalition said overnight that riyadh s air defence had intercepted a missile which houthis said was aimed at storage tanks belonging to saudi aramco oil company
saudi arabia accuses iran of supplying missiles to the houthis who have taken over the yemeni capital sanaa and other parts of the country
tehran and the houthis deny the allegation
under an arms embargo imposed by the security council monitors from the verification and inspection mechanism unvim are based in ports in djibouti dubai jeddah and salalah to observe screening of cargo destined for yemen
we met with the unvim director and his team in riyadh and we agreed on improved and enhanced capability saudi ambassador to yemen mohammed told reporters in geneva on wednesday
he said unvim would increase its inspectors to from four and its monitors to from six and would also improve its technology to inspect ships
the team supporting the humanitarian coordinator in yemen lise grande confirmed to reuters on thursday those steps taken to increase the number of monitors and inspectors and the use of scanning equipment
a major pledging conference on yemen was held this week drawing pledges of more than billion toward a billion humanitarian appeal
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates which lead coalition air strikes in yemen in support of the government of president mansour hadi have contributed million
we are cooperating with the unvim and other organisations to facilitate and to increase the amount of ships that arrive to hodeidah port jabir said referring to yemen s main port for humanitarian and commercial goods under houthi control
unvim only checks commercial and aid ships going to northern ports under houthi control hodeidah salif and ras isa and not to aden which is under government control
yemen the arabian peninsula s poorest country is reeling from the world s worst humanitarian crisis where million people need vital assistance
when the houthis fired missiles at riyadh last november the coalition shut yemen s airports and ports
the united nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation and it was partially lifted
but diplomats say saudi arabia has been under heavy pressure from its main ally the united states to speed up aid
the blockade and delays have had a chilling effect on commercial suppliers as ships pay hefty demurrage fees as they wait for unloading experts say
the blockade of november and december has been solved in january but really the ships from djibouti to the harbour of hodeidah started regularly only at the end of february said nevio zagaria the world health organization s envoy in yemen
but bureaucratic impediments still slow the aid flow both at hodeidah and aden ports he told reuters
we are now early april we still have the backlog of thousands of pallets that have been waiting to be transported zagaria said referring to medical and other supplies
