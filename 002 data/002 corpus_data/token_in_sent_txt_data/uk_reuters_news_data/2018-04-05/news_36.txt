interview-qatar says too early to exit opec oil cuts as investment still low
doha reuters opec and its allies should maintain oil supply curbs to guarantee healthy price levels which will allow increased investment in the industry and help avoid a supply and price shock in the long run opec member qatar said
qatar s energy minister mohammed told reuters he also supported the idea of creating a permanent platform for opec s cooperation with russia even after the current round of joint oil supply cuts ends
there is a clear recovery in oil prices
but it has not been met with an increase in investments investment has been very low
my concern is that to demand is met comfortably sada said in an interview
investors are still cautious and
sada said that global oil demand was set to rise by at least million barrels per day this year or by a healthy percent
but the global oil investment purse of around billion was still too small to guarantee the required level of investment to replace production from mature fields and the launch of new projects
i would see the need to keep the opec cooperation momentum we need to restore investments
it could take months opec could start being concerned about gross opec and its allies led by russia have reduced production since the start of to ease a global oil glut stemming from the shale oil boom that saw oil prices crashing to below per barrel and investment in the oil sector falling by over trillion in the past three years
opec s production restraints have helped cut global oil stocks in industrialized nations from as high as million barrels above the average to as low as million barrels sada said
the tightening of the market propelled oil prices above per barrel this year but also encouraged shale oil drillers to increase investments and return to record production growth
even with shale the market is heading for balance said sada
he said record shale output was almost fully absorbed by demand increases but elsewhere investments were not growing
some million bpd of shale production have become an integral part of the global supply portfolio and demand could absorb even more as production was falling in places like venezuela mexico colombia and china said sada
russia has been hinting that opec should start considering exiting the cuts sooner rather than later to avoid giving too much of a boost to shale oil output
opec s leader saudi arabia has said cuts could be extended in one form or another into and also said riyadh and moscow were considering a deal to extend their oil cuts alliance to as long as or even years
sada said he supported the idea of longer term opec and cooperation the platform should stay
it is in the interest of everybody
the agreement on supply curbs is another thing
qatar is one of the smallest opec oil producers but is the most influential player in the global liquefied natural gas market thanks to its huge plants producing a total of million tonnes a year
sitting on the world s biggest gas field north field which it shares with iran qatar plans to expand its lng capacity to million tonnes and sada said it would be done before the gas market gets too tight in the early part of the next decade
we want this volume to come on time to fill the rising gap between supply and demand he said
sada also said that a long predicted global gas glut has effectively failed to materialize in the past few years
if you look at operational outages then there is hardly any surplus in the lng market today he said
if you go back three years there was a lot of projections of a gas glut
but it didn t happen the magnitude of supply surplus has diminished greatly and also the expectations of when the markets will balance were brought forward considerably he said
in fact four or five years ago people were talking about markets balancing by then they spoke about today they talk about markets balancing as close as by
