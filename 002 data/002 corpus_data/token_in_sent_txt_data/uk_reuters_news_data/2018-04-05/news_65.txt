column-lme options landscape suggests one last bull hurrah for zinc: andy home
repeats with no changesthe opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
options open interest by month call options by strike by andy home london april reuters is that it for the zinc price or does the market have one last hurrah before the bull cycle turns
london metal exchange lme zinc for delivery hit a high of per tonne on the culmination of a gradual but relentless tightening of the supply chain that had been playing out over several years
since then zinc has been dragged lower in the broader in the industrial metals space and is currently trading either side of the tonne level
analysts such as max layton of citi believe there is still the potential for one last leg higher to per tonne
but time is running out
the zinc price in the next three to six months is the best we re going to see for the next three to five years he told last month s metal bulletin zinc conference in london
the lme options market seems to agree judging by the concentration of bull positioning over the next three months
thereafter open interest drops off sharply until december when bearish views predominate
the consensus it seems is for zinc s bull cycle to peak sooner rather than later before a down cycle
but zinc confounded the bulls several times on the way up
might it equally confound the bears on the way down
graphic on lme zinc options open interest calls and puts through december graphic on lme zinc call options by major month and major strike the landscape of options positioning in the zinc market can t tell us where the price is going but it does give a fair idea of where the market thinks the price might be going
and in the short term the market still seems to be collectively bullish
the number of call options which confer the right to buy dwarfs the amount of put options which confer the right to sell in april may and june
the april options expire today but as of last night s close there were lots tonnes of call option open interest versus just lots of put open interest
the upside skew is even more extreme in june with tonnes of open interest on calls versus lots on puts
the june market positioning is clustered on three main strike prices namely lots lots and lots
the very highest strike price open is with lots sitting there on each of the front three months
after june however options open interest falls off a cliff up to december which tends to be a liquid month for options positioning in any given year
and although there are lots of wildly optimistic call options open on the strike in december upside interest is eclipsed by downside put option positioning
the market in other words appears to agree with the view of citi s layton and other analysts
if there s going to be one last bull hurrah it s going to happen by july after which options open interest and bull exuberance both plummet
this narrative of one last price peak is predicated on a building supply response to recent high prices
the international lead and zinc study group ilzsg expects some tonnes of additional mine supply to enter the market this year according to joao jorge the group s director of market research speaking at the same london conference
the ilzsg is forecasting mine production growth to accelerate from percent in to percent this year
the mine surge will result from a combination of restarts such as that announced by glencore last december and new mines such as vedanta s gamsberg project in south africa
the single biggest addition to global supply however will come from the century zinc mine in australia
century closed in but new century resources aims to produce zinc concentrates from the old tailings at the mine site
the company is guiding towards a restart of activity in the third quarter of this year with a to full capacity of tonnes per year of contained metal
that s around half of what century was capable of producing in its heyday
century it s worth remembering repeatedly dashed bulls hopes in the long to this year s high prices by staying open much longer than expected
the very fact it is coming back at all is astonishing but will new century like old century spring more surprises on the unwary this time by taking longer to ramp up than expected
if you re looking to the concentrates part of the market for an answer you re in for a disappointment
this year s benchmark treatment charges for the processing of concentrates into metal should provide some insight into the state of play in the raw materials segment of the supply chain
but after two fruitless rounds of meetings smelters and miners are still far apart on how much new supply to expect and how quickly to expect it
uncertainty around these changing supply dynamics this year is going to remain a key unknown for many months
a more immediate threat to the zinc consensus might come from visible stocks
lme inventory has fallen from almost tonnes in to a current tonnes just about all of it in the port of new orleans
the occasional arrival of more zinc in lme warehouses in the city such as the tonnes that were warranted in a single day on march has unsettled the market
there s nothing new to this new orleans zinc roundabout but with visible stocks so low what s happening to invisible stocks sitting in storage takes on added significance
quite evidently if more zinc miraculously turns up in the big easy it puts at risk the potential for that bull charge to new highs
there again with only tonnes of lme stocks available the london price is going to remain highly sensitive to further cancellations and drawdowns
maybe that s what the bull with the december calls on the strike price is hoping for
else is though
