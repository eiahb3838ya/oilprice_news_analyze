solar power eclipsed fossil fuels in new 2017 generating capacity-un
reuters chinese solar power led a record gigawatts gw of new renewable energy capacity added worldwide last year more than double the amount of new generation capacity from fossil fuels a report showed on thursday
globally a record gw of solar power capacity was installed last year with china contributing more than half or gw according to
environment the frankfurt collaborating centre and bloomberg new energy finance
the new renewable energy generating capacity also including wind biofuels and geothermal energy dwarfed the gw of net new capacity from fossil fuels in it said
we are at a turning point from fossil fuels to the renewable world erik solheim head of
environment told reuters
the markets are there and renewables can take on coal they can take on oil and fossil fuels however still dominate existing capacity
solar wind biomass and other renewables generated percent of world electricity in up from percent a decade earlier it said
climate scientists have advised governments that renewables should be the world s dominant source of energy by if they want to achieve the toughest goals set under the paris climate agreement to combat global warming
global investment in renewable energy rose by two percent to billion in from a year earlier
china invested the most in renewables at billion its largest amount ever and percent of the global total
much lower costs are the driver of solar investment worldwide said angus mccrone chief editor of bloomberg new energy finance and lead author of the report told reuters
and solar power in china benefited from government policies to help industry reduce air pollution and slow climate change he said
the report said the cost of generating electricity from solar photovoltaic technology fell by percent last year to per megawatt hour
in the united states renewable energy investment fell by six percent in to billion
however it was relatively resilient to policy uncertainties under president donald trump who wants to promote fossil fuels the report said
trump can no more brake this than those who opposed the industrial revolution could stop the industrial revolution said solheim a former norwegian environment minister
still trump s decision in january to slap tariffs on imported solar panels could dent solar power in the short term mccrone said
but there was no sign the congress would scrap tax credits for renewables that are a bigger driver of investment he said
europe s investment in renewables plunged by percent to billion due to factors including the end of subsidies in some countries for solar and wind and lower technology costs
in europe the fall in investment is strongly driven by germany and the uk said ulf moslener lead editor of the report at the frankfurt school
