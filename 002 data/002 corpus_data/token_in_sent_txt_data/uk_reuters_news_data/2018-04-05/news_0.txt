the white house is probing pruitt s lease of a room in a washington neighborhood for a night in a townhouse by the wife of energy industry lobbyist steven hart who lobbies for companies regulated by the epa
pruitt has told the washington examiner in an interview that he was dumbfounded his renting of the room in a townhouse was controversial and said his ethics officials reviewed the lease
but the epa s ethics office suggested there still could be questions about pruitt s housing arrangement
pruitt a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science also is facing criticism for frequent air travel spending on costly items in his office including a soundproof telephone booth and for a trip to morocco in which he promoted exports of liquefied natural gas
while trump appears to support pruitt the president can be fickle

in late march the epa s ethics office cleared pruitt of accepting an illegal gift from a lobbyist with the condo lease saying a number of other rooms nearby were available for rent for a similar or lower price
but the office issued a memo dated on wednesday and seen by reuters that the earlier review did not consider whether pruitt had violated other ethics rules with the lease
kevin minoli a top ethics official in the epa s office of general counsel said in the memo that the review did not address issues such as a rule requiring officials to avoid behavior that could result in their impartiality being questioned
it is important to note that the federal ethics regulations regarding impartiality apply regardless of whether something involves receiving a prohibited gift he wrote
in a separate statement about the memo minoli said it explained the ethical issues beyond the scope of the original review
the impartiality rule requires that government officials avoid doing things that could create an appearance of favoritism in government according to the office of government ethics
in the memo first reported by cnn minoli also said he did not have access to enough information to determine whether pruitt s actual use of the townhouse was consistent with the lease
trump s support for pruitt which he also voiced on tuesday comes even as lawmakers including three fellow republicans called for his resignation over the ethics questions
more questions surfaced as trump commented on pruitt
