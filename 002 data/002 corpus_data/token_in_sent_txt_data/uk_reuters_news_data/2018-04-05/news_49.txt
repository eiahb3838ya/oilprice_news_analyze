corrected-libya's national oil corp signs deal with artelia for new benghazi offices
corrects april story to remove reference to headquarters paragraph tripoli april reuters libya s national oil corporation noc said on wednesday it had signed a deal with french building and engineering group artelia to manage the development of its offices in the eastern city of benghazi
there have been plans for years to move the state oil firm s headquarters from the capital tripoli back to benghazi but it remains unclear when such a transfer could happen
noc did not say when the complex would be built
the buildings will include offices for other oil companies and a branch of libya s central bank as well as a hotel complex and a conference centre noc said in a statement
it said the deal had been signed by noc chairman mustafa sanalla and artelia executive director alberto romeo on friday and that funding would come from commercial banks
there were no details on the cost of the project
most of opec member libya s oil resources lie in the east of the country but former leader muammar gaddafi moved noc to tripoli and starved the eastern region of investment
benghazi now wants greater influence but parts of the city are in ruins after more than three years of fighting linked to a broader conflict that developed in libya after the country s uprising
rival factions based in tripoli and the east have vied for power over the past four years with some groups in the east making unsuccessful attempts to sell oil independently of tripoli
libya s oil production which was crippled by conflict and blockades after has partially recovered to more than one million barrels per day bpd last year
the noc recently announced it would organise an oil and gas conference in benghazi in october
