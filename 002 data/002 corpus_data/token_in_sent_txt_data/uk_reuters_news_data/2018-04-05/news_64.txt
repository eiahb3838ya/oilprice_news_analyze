rpt-column-with trade war, u.s. and china stumble into the thucydides trap: kemp
repeats april column
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own by john kemp london april reuters the united states and china have fired the opening shots in a trade war that may be hard to stop
washington has published a target list of items imported from china worth an estimated billion that would be hit with an extra tariff of percent notice of determination ustr april
beijing has responded with a target list of items imported from the united states worth a similar amount that would be hit by the same ad valorem tariff china retaliates for tariffs reuters april
the united states has appeared eager to impose tariffs to create leverage and force china into concessions on the bilateral trade deficit intellectual property protection and forced technology transfer
president donald trump has insisted trade wars are winnable and pushed his officials to increase the scope of the target list
for its part china has appeared anxious to avert a trade conflict but threatened a proportionate response to any unilateral action
both sides have been careful to leave time for further negotiations in an effort to prevent the tariffs from taking effect
most investors still seem convinced a deal can be reached without damaging the world s two largest economies
the trump administration has a track record of announcing aggressive and trade policies and then diluting or abandoning them in the face of stiff opposition and in exchange for comparatively minor concessions
trade wars however are like real wars in that they are easy to start but once underway the course is unpredictable and they can be difficult to halt
as a result trade war between the united states and china must be seen as one of the biggest risks to the global economy and commodity prices in and
neither trump nor chinese president xi jinping can afford to be seen to lose a trade conflict or make many concessions without securing something in return
trump made trade a central plank of his presidential campaign in and faces tough congressional elections in just seven months
fair trade and dealing with china s perceived abuses is an important issue for the president s core supporters and has qualified backing from some elements of the business community
in china xi has just been as communist party chief and had the constitution changed to allow him to extend his tenure as president based largely on his promise of strong leadership
like a real war the trade measures announced by both sides are largely for domestic political consumption and designed to play to a nationalist audience
behind the scenes both sides are trying to negotiate a settlement and have been leaking some details to the media in an effort to calm concerns about the economic impact
there are plenty of possible options to settle the dispute
the problem is that any compromise must allow both sides to save face
and that will be much harder now that tariffs have been announced
both sides are likely to come under business and economic pressure to avoiding a major disruption of global trade and with it the increased likelihood of a recession
but with the domestic political credibility of the leaders of both countries now on the line just as in a real war the scope for a mutually has narrowed
the trade conflict is really just one aspect of the increasing strategic competition between the united states and china
the united states wants to maintain its military diplomatic and economic superiority over all other countries while china is determined not to accept second place and to achieve parity
the problem has been termed the thucydides trap after the conflict in ancient greece between sparta the incumbent superpower and athens the rising superpower that led to the peloponnesian war
the problem of how to manage the rising power of china and its challenge to the superiority of the united states has been evident for two decades i remember discussing it frequently with colleagues in the late
china has appeared anxious to avoid the problem and the xinhua news agency has published numerous articles on averting the thucydides trap in recent years
the issue has been extensively discussed by officials including the president and foreign minister as well as in opinion commentaries china voice ten reasons china can avoid thucydides trap xinhua
even with this level of awareness however the two countries have already blundered into the thucydides trap on trade
the list of areas where the two powers are in increasingly pointed strategic competition now covers trade overseas investment advanced technology naval and military armaments
intensifying diplomatic competition also covers multiple regions including the south china sea southeast asia the indian ocean central asia the korean peninsula africa and latin america
there are compelling economic reasons for the united states and china to avoid imposing extensive tariffs on bilateral trade but both sides face tricky domestic political constraints
it is possible to envisage a grand bargain that can resolve many if not all of the outstanding differences between the two countries on business issues
there is still time for negotiations and opportunities for a mutually deal though the uncertainty in the meantime is likely to be extremely damaging
and just as real wars are often the result of unpredictable and unplanned escalation trade wars can also spiral out of control
