hanwha total petrochemical has bought at least tonnes of heavy naphtha a month so far this year versus an average of tonnes a month in said the sources who participate in the asian naphtha market
meanwhile sk incheon petrochem a unit of sk innovation purchased tonnes of the product for april delivery versus up to tonnes a month previously the sources said
heavy naphtha has a higher content of compounds known as aromatics that are used as precursors for petrochemicals such as xylenes and paraxylenes
