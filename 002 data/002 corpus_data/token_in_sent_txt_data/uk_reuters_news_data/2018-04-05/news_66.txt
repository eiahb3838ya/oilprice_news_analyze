refile-update 3-u.s. ethanol groups bristle as epa frees refiners from biofuels law
new york reuters the environmental protection agency has approved the request of small refineries to be exempted from the nation s biofuels laws an agency source said on wednesday marking a big increase from previous years and triggering an outcry from farm groups worried the move will hurt ethanol demand
the expansion of the waiver program represents the trump administration s latest clash with the powerful corn lobby as it seeks to help merchant refiners that claim the renewable fuel standard costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year
the law requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel each year or purchase blending credits from other companies a policy intended to provide a boost to midwestern corn growers reduce pollution and cut fuel imports
in the past the epa has issued between six and eight waivers from the rfs per year to small refining operations of less than barrels per day that can demonstrate they are struggling financially to comply according to a former official familiar with the waiver program under past administrations
this time that number has ballooned
while the applications continue to come in epa has granted roughly so far said the epa source who asked not to be named discussing the waivers
the source said the waivers cover the refineries obligations for which would come due this year
a spokeswoman for the epa liz bowman said nothing had changed under the administration of president donald trump
the criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations she said
reuters had reported on tuesday that andeavor one of the nation s biggest refining companies recently won exemptions from the epa covering its obligations at three of its smallest refineries the first evidence of the agency providing relief to a large and profitable company
biofuel groups blasted the epa for apparently expanding the use of the hardship waivers with two of them calling on the agency to immediately halt issuing new exemptions until the public gets a chance to review the agency s actions
epa does not disclose the waiver recipients arguing the information is business confidential
epa appears to be operating under the cover of night in a secretive process where the agency acts as judge jury and executioner to effectively reduce the overall demand for biofuels in this country absent any public discourse said emily skor ceo of biofuel producer growth energy
the national farmers union said it was particularly incensed by the waiver andeavor had acquired
hardship waivers were not designed for large corporations who net billions in profit each year
the national farmers union nfu is deeply disturbed by these reports and requests that epa cease granting these waivers it said in a letter to epa administrator scott pruitt
the news of the number of waivers epa has granted drove down prices for biofuel blending credits to their lowest levels since on fears that refiners that typically have to buy them would sell them instead traders said
lower demand for ethanol could hurt biofuel and agricultural companies like archer daniels midland co poet and green plains inc
refiners have applied for the waivers in larger numbers after a federal appeals court ruling last year that said the epa must expand the guidelines for approving them
they have also been encouraged to apply by the trump administration s recent efforts to broker a deal between the oil and corn industries to reduce the costs of the rfs industry sources said
those talks have not yielded a deal
refiners granted exemptions win in two ways they no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance
prices of renewable fuel credits plunged to as low as cents each on wednesday the first time they fell below cents since september according to the oil price information service

senator chuck grassley a republican who represents iowa the nation s largest state and who backs the biofuels industry said late on tuesday that the expansion of the waiver program raised legal questions
giving andeavor a free pass when other companies are required to follow the law of the land isn t just unfair it may be illegal grassley told reuters late tuesday
brooke coleman head of the advanced biofuels business council said he was concerned epa s pruitt was using the waivers to gut a program he dislikes
mr
pruitt is eviscerating a law the president supports in complete secrecy he said pointing out trump had campaigned on a promise to support the rfs
