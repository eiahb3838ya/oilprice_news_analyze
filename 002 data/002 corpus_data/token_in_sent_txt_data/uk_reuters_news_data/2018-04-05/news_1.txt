u.s. epa sued by 14 states over delay in methane emission standards
reuters fourteen states filed suit on thursday accusing the environmental protection agency of failing to issue regulations for curbing emissions of methane a potent greenhouse pollutant from existing oil and gas operations as required under the clean air act
the legal challenge led by new york state came nine months after a federal appeals court sided with environmental activists who sued to block the epa from freezing enforcement of its own rules to control methane leaks from new or modified fossil fuel facilities
in both instances epa chief scott pruitt has been accused of putting the interests of oil and gas companies ahead of the agency s obligation to protect air quality including the control of pollutants that scientists blame for global climate change
pruitt who was a leading epa critic as attorney general of the state of oklahoma before beginning his tenure as head of the epa has said he does not believe greenhouse gas emissions are the principal driver of climate change
as epa administrator pruitt has moved to carry out president donald trump s campaign pledge to roll back or reconsider a slew of environmental protections deemed burdensome by the industry including climate change regulations
in march trump signed an order to undo climate rules
and the epa that month halted efforts to collect data from fossil fuel operations to prepare performance standards that states would have to follow in devising measures for existing wells pipelines storage tanks pumping stations and other facilities
it was epa s unreasonable delay in developing those standards that thursday s lawsuit filed in district court in washington cited as a clean air act violation
the epa has a clear legal duty to control methane pollution from oil and gas operations new york attorney general eric schneiderman said
its continued refusal to do so is not only illegal but threatens our public health and the lawsuit prepared by his office was joined by california and other states including illinois pennsylvania new mexico vermont and iowa as well as the district of columbia and the city of chicago
pruitt was named as the sole defendant in the complaint which seeks a court order compelling the epa to devise and issue the emissions standards in question
an epa spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation
methane the main component of commercially distributed natural gas is also a byproduct of oil extraction
pound for pound it traps significantly more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide the most prevalent greenhouse gas though its effects are
the oil and gas industry accounts for nearly third of all methane emissions according to an epa report cited in the lawsuit
the overwhelming bulk of those emissions equivalent to million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year come from facilities in existence prior to the complaint said
the lawsuit cited an environmental defense fund study that found the industry could cut methane emissions percent below projected levels at an average annual cost of less than a penny per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced
the study said that reduction could save the economy more than million a year
