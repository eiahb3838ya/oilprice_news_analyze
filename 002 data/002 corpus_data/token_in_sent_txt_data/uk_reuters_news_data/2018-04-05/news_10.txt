hurricane forecasters see above-average 2018 u.s. storm season
houston reuters the united states faces an atlantic hurricane season with the gulf and east coasts facing nearly equal chances of being struck by a major hurricane packing winds over miles per hour km per hour colorado state university meteorologists said on thursday
there also is a percent probability that a major hurricane will move into the caribbean sea during the season that begins june and runs through said researchers at colorado state s tropical meteorology project
its forecast which expects seven storms to develop into hurricanes is similar to those recently issued by private forecasters accuweather and weatherbell analytics
the
climate prediction center will issue its outlook for in late may according to dennis feltgen spokesman for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
statistics show that on average the more active the overall atlantic basin hurricane season is the greater the probability of hurricane landfall wrote authors philip klotzbach and michael bell in their forecast
a summary of the three forecasts is in the table below
an average atlantic hurricane season produces named storms of which six become hurricanes three of them major
last year hurricanes harvey irma and maria devastated the gulf coast florida and puerto rico respectively
harvey inundated houston and forced the partial or complete shutdown of oil refineries including the largest and second largest in the united states
puerto rico continues to recover from maria which knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents
according to the colorado state forecast there is a percent probability a major hurricane will strike the east coast and a percent probability such a storm will make landfall between the florida panhandle and brownsville texas
both the accuweather and colorado state forecasts point to a weakening la nina pattern in the pacific ocean
la nina is the name for a pattern of cold ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean
the two forecasts do not expect an el nino pattern will form if the la nina ends
the el nino is the name for a pattern of warm ocean temperatures in the central pacific which produces high winds across the southern united states often breaking apart tropical storms
