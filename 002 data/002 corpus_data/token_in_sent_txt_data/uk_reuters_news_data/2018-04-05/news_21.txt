peugeot boss says co2 fines will create chinese 'trojan horse'
paris reuters a major european carmaker could be brought to its knees by carbon dioxide emissions fines allowing a chinese buyer to step in with its own electric vehicle technology peugeot maker psa group s chief executive said
carlos tavares who chairs european auto industry lobby group acea said that policymakers had failed to anticipate this outcome of the european union s goals
the impact is very obvious
it s going to create a chinese trojan horse in europe tavares told an industry event hosted by french car magazine le journal de l auto late on wednesday
his outspoken comments come against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between china and the united states and wider concerns about growing protectionism worldwide
they also underscore concerns about foreign influence over european manufacturers jobs and technology which have risen since china s geely snapped up percent of germany s daimler in february
if a european carmaker missed its targets and was brought to its knees by fines it could not be acquired by another big european carmaker purely because of antitrust rules tavares said without naming any manufacturer
that would create the opportunity for a foreign investor to bring in the kind of technology imposed by european authorities which means electric vehicles he said
and who s the leader in electrification
it s the chinese he added
psa itself by china s dongfeng motor has accelerated new vehicle development at opel and vauxhall after uncovering what tavares described as hidden emissions problems following the brands acquisition from general motors last year
thanks to the extra investment the group maintains it is now on track to meet goals averaging grammes per kilometer being phased in from backed by hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for
the current average for new cars is
tavares has called for the eu penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate charging networks saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of acea on march
acea has not approached the european commission to reopen any discussion of the goals a spokeswoman told reuters
president donald trump s administration moved this week to weaken goals previously agreed for in response to calls for a revision by carmakers
psa and other european carmakers are facing declining sales of diesel models making it harder to meet targets and avoid large fines
