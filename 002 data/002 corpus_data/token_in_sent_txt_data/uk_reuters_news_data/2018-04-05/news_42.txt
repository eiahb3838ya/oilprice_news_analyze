update 2-contourglobal seeking equity partner for new kosovo coal plant
london reuters power generator contourglobal hopes to secure an equity partner for its new power plant in kosovo by the end of the year or early the company ceo told reuters on thursday
several financial institutions such as insurers axa and ing have announced plans divest from investments as part of a move to limit global warming
however contourglobal ceo joseph brandt said he is confident of securing financing and a partner for an up to percent stake in the megawatt mw coal plant
the kosovo project is exceptionally political everyone involved recognise it its driven by the nature of kosovo as a fragile state brandt said in an interview
kosovo is struggling with power shortages and around percent of its power is produced in two ailing plants which are seen as among the worst polluters in europe
the country s government has endorsed the project and last year minister of development valdrin lluka said it would help kosovo s economic growth rise to or percent in the coming years up from around percent in
brandt was speaking to reuters following the company s first results announcement since listing on the london stock exchange last year
the company which operates power plants across europe latin america and africa and generates about megawatts said revenue rose percent to billion in
adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda rose to million from million
on listing last year the company said it planned to double its ebitda within five years which brandt said would mainly be achieved through acquisitions
we are confident this will happen sooner than five years given the recent acquisitions we have made he said
contourglobal said in february it would buy five mw spanish solar power plants from spain s acciona for million euros
brandt said the company was technology neutral about new acquisitions and could target renewable or thermal power plants
but he ruled out any acquisitions in the nuclear sector as it is not an area in which the company has expertise
i don t see that changing it is not an area we are looking at brandt said
