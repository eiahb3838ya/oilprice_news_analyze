interview-nord stream 2 can be justified if ukraine's interests safeguarded
berlin reuters germany s economy minister said he believed the nord stream pipeline can go ahead while preserving ukraine s vital interests but that berlin is also in talks to diversify its energy supply with liquefied natural gas
president donald trump in july accused germany of being a captive of russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the billion nord stream gas pipeline that is to be built in the baltic sea
berlin and moscow have been at odds since russia annexed crimea four years ago but they have a common interest in the nord stream project which will double the capacity of the existing nord stream route from next year
washington is concerned the pipeline which will bypass ukraine by running under the baltic sea will strip ukraine of important transit revenues and says moscow is using the project to divide europe
personally i believe that this project can be justified if ukraine s vital interests are preserved at the same time german economy minister peter altmaier told reuters in an interview conducted on friday for publication on sunday
and one of these vital interests is that even after substantial gas transit through ukraine will take place from russia
there are discussions about this at the moment he said adding that the detail of the talks was very difficult
ukraine derives up to percent of its gross domestic product gdp from transit charges
we will not reduce dependence on russia by torpedoing a pipeline such as nord stream and then sourcing gas from russia from other pipelines altmaier said
greater independence is only conceivable if in addition to the supply of gas we also create an lng infrastructure in washington has touted liquefied natural gas lng delivered by companies as an alternative to russian gas
altmaier said german government members were agreed they wanted to build the infrastructure to import lng soon and we are currently in the process of clarifying the location issue with private turning to britain s departure from the european union altmaier said an eu summit last week showed a deal on britain s withdrawal from the bloc could not be renegotiated but on the other hand that the european union is ready to provide clarification
between these two poles there is a certain amount of tension that can only be overcome by britain putting proposals on the table that as far as i can see are not yet available he added
on german domestic politics he said chancellor angela merkel s christian democratic union cdu was not divided following a robust leadership contest this month
it is now clear that we have a stable government with a chancellor for the next few years he added
