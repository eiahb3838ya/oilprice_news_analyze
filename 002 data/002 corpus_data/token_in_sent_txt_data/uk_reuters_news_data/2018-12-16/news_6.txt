update 3-mexico targets 50 pct jump in oil output under 'pemex rescue'
mexico city reuters mexico aims to lift oil and gas production by almost percent in the next six years and in january will award infrastructure and drilling contracts to develop fields state oil firm petroleos mexicanos said on saturday
octavio romero chief executive officer of the company generally known as pemex said the new government would increase exploration investment by around percent annually to reverse dwindling output as he presented a new plan for the industry
president andres manuel lopez obrador who took office on wants to revive pemex which has become heavily indebted as crude output fell from a peak of nearly million barrels per day bpd in to less than million in october
it s a new pemex rescue lopez obrador said alongside romero in the port of ciudad del carmen in the southern gulf of mexico shortly before his government was due to present its first budget with pemex s finances under close scrutiny
under the plan mexican crude output is due to climb to some million barrels bpd by the end of while gas production will also rise by about percent
output will stabilize in the coming months and start to pick up toward the end of next year the pemex ceo said
however projections presented in the government s first budget later on saturday suggested output would continue falling until
mexico s previous government sought to increase production by opening up production and exploration to private capital
but the decline has yet to bottom out
lopez obrador an admirer of lazaro cardenas the president who nationalized mexico s oil industry years ago was opposed to the constitutional overhaul of the industry carried out by his predecessor enrique pena nieto
the veteran leftist says he will respect private oil contracts awarded under pena nieto but this month challenged oil majors to start pumping oil quickly offering them a truce without giving further details
in the meantime mexico will speed up exploitation of mostly offshore fields in the gulf of mexico romero said
to this end contracts for the necessary infrastructure will be awarded on and to drill wells on he added
most of the fields are offshore and the government plans to issue integrated infrastructure contracts romero said
the drilling of the wells would be turnkey contracts that made the companies or consortiums responsible for delivery
pemex will be responsible for the engineering and supervision of the services
by december the fields should yield bpd of output romero said
energy secretary rocio nahle told reporters in the city that priority would be given to mexican firms in the contracting process based on a restricted list of invitees
romero said nine companies had expressed interest in drilling the offshore wells and five others had done so for the four onshore fields
all are majority he said
