analysis-climate talks pass baton in race to stop global warming
katowice poland reuters fractious climate change talks in poland showed the limits of international action to limit global warming in a polarized world putting the onus on individual governments cities and communities to stop temperatures rising
nearly countries at the united nations talks in katowice in the coal mining region of silesia saved the landmark paris agreement from disintegration on saturday by agreeing a package of guidelines for its implementation
but it deferred rules on carbon credits a spur to business and lacked any firm commitment to strengthen countries emissions cut targets by when the agreement comes into force
as such it left the parties a long way from the paris deal s goal of keeping global warming below degrees celsius let alone the cap of needed to avert more extreme weather rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species
the world is heading for a rise in temperatures this century the world meteorological organization has said
the paris agreement is based on individual commitments and expectations for the polish talks to produce much more than rules for how those would be measured had always been low the unity built in paris had been shattered by a wave of governments placing national agendas before collective action
only a handful of country leaders were present in katowice and the had to fly back to the meeting to urge progress
political will is missing alden meyer director at the union of concerned scientists a science advocacy group said as the conference staggered towards a finish delayed for more than hours by wrangling over parts of the text
but it provides the hooks for governments cities businesses civil society etc to do the work to get to the paris agreement goals he said
for conference president michal kurtyka it was a job well done
mission accomplished he wrote on twitter
our children look back at our legacy and recognize that we took the right decisions at important junctures like the one we face for nations already suffering from climate change the agreement which did not make clear how pledged funding would be provided was only just better than nothing
simon stiell environment minister of grenada in the caribbean told reuters it is barely scratching the surface of what we really require
investors said it would take more action at government level to persuade them to pump in the amount of money needed
those countries who push ahead with ambitious climate policies will be the ones to reap the investment and economic advantages of doing so said stephanie pfeifer chief executive of institutional investors group on climate change noting the transition was already underway
the united states set to withdraw from the process at the behest of president donald trump staged an event touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels including coal more efficiently while back at home trump has termed the paris deal ridiculous
a scientific report requested by the paris signatories said the share of power would have to be cut to under percent by along with big cuts to other fossil fuels to stop temperatures rising more than and causing devastating floods storms heat waves and drought
the united states as well as fellow oil producers saudi arabia russia and kuwait refused to welcome the report a term sought by countries seeking to focus minds on its findings
the final statement merely welcomed its timely completion and invited parties to make use of the information it contained
yet the row over the report was far from the only one china india russia australia japan brazil and the european union were all drawn into various rifts although china won some praise for helping to overcome concern especially from the united states that it would sidestep any rules
i think they have come a long way in recognizing they need to provide confidence jennifer morgan executive director of greenpeace international said of the chinese negotiators
describing washington as out of touch morgan noted the rules agreed in poland nevertheless bound all countries including the united states until its planned withdrawal in an achievement in itself
but that substitute for the need to build ambition she said
poland hosting its third climate conference came in for criticism for its commitment to coal the most polluting of fossil fuels
the meeting s final statement merely noted warsaw s call for a just transition allowing communities dependent on coal more time to adjust
the appointment of kurtyka poland s deputy environment minister to preside over the talks appeased some campaigners angered by the government s previous choice former environment minister jan szyszko
szyszko had expressed doubts that global warming is manmade in the past and increased logging in the ancient forest of bialowieza declared illegal by the european union s top court
however kurtyka s job was complicated by poland s environment minister saying he did not want discussion about raising ambition at the talks and poland s president vowing not to let anyone murder coal mining
a focus on technicalities in the first week was interpreted by campaigners as a pretext to avoid discussions on pledging deeper emissions cuts
kurtyka got countries to focus on the guidelines near the end of the second week but there was no collective action to harmonize or improve disparate pledges
each delegation has its own domestic interests our role as the presidency is to find balance which ensures reaching a compromise adam poland s chief negotiator said in the second week of talks
poland s ruling party the law and justice pis wants to scale back the share of coal in electricity production from percent to percent by
but the production of hard coal is expected to be stable for decades although percent of poles think it should be gradually phased out to reduce emissions according to a survey by pollster cbos in november
katowice the heart of poland s coal region is among the most polluted cities in europe because many people heat their homes by burning low quality coal which is the cheapest
residents say they have no choice
no climate decisions even the best ones will change the content of our wallets said maria ligeza an katowice citizen
without help people will be still burning what they additional reporting by bate felix and wojciech zurawski editing by philippa fletcher
