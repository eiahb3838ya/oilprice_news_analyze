refile-french pair invent plastic-to-fuel recycler fit for african bush
france reuters a french actor and a inventor have designed a machine that converts plastic waste into diesel and petrol which they say could help fight pollution and provide fuel for remote communities in developing countries
proponents of technology say the sector could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the next five years and that by melting plastics into fuel they are providing a solution to the planet s plastic waste crisis
opponents worry that the process creates harmful fumes
the idea is to encourage the collection of waste before it ends up in the oceans with a machine that fits in a shipping container and can create an income said samuel le bihan who has starred in french movies such as disco and mesrine
for years le bihan has bankrolled the development of the crude machine dubbed chrysalis in a hangar in in the hills behind the riviera city of nice
its designer is a scientist
plastic pellets are fed into a closed reactor where they are broken down at degrees centigrade to produce diesel gasoline and a carbon residue that can be used in crayons
a kilo of plastic gives a liter of liquid
it s separated between diesel and petrol said creator cristofer costes
with euro additional financing from the local authority the two men plan to create a larger prototype capable of converting kilograms of plastic into fuel every minutes
simple in design it will be reparable even in the depths of the african bush said costes
every year about million tonnes of plastic is produced
data shows eight million tonnes of plastic bottles packaging and other waste enters the ocean each year killing marine life and entering the human food chain
conservationists have warned that plastic pollution in the oceans could outweigh fish by
similar technologies to the chrysalis have already been developed by companies looking to help solve one of the greatest environmental problems facing humanity
british firm recycling technologies says their machine the can transform waste plastic into a novel raw material called plaxx which can then be by the plastics industry
if people see that plastic waste has a value they won t chuck it away said le bihan
i can t imagine how many tonnes of plastic waste there is lying around that we could editing by richard lough and alexandra hudson
