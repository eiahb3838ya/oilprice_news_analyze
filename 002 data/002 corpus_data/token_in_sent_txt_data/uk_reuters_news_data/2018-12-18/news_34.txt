global coal demand to edge higher to 2023 - iea
london reuters global coal demand will edge higher until as growth in india and other asian countries offsets a decline in europe and the united states the international energy agency iea said on tuesday
consumption of the fuel is expected to rise by an average of percent a year from million tonnes of coal equivalent mtce in to mtce in the agency said
the report comes days after nearly countries agreed to rules for implementing a landmark climate deal aimed at curbing emissions from fossil fuels to keep global temperature rises this century well below degrees celsius
despite significant media attention being given to divestments and moves away from coal market trends are proving resistant to change the report said
coal remains the global source of primary energy behind oil and the largest source of electricity
for the world to meet its climate goals more work is needed to develop carbon capture storage and use ccsu technology which captures and then either stores carbon dioxide underground or uses it in other industries the iea said
simply put to meet our sustainability goals there can be no future for coal without ccsu iea executive director fatih birol said
just carbon capture and storage plants are in operation around the world according to the global ccs institute
coal consumption in china is projected to fall percent per year to mtce in driven in part by efficiency improvements and policies to curb air pollution
a sharp increase is predicted for india with demand rising by mtce to mtce in boosted by a rise in power output and production of crude steel the iea said
