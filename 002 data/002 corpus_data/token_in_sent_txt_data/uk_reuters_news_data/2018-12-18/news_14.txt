solar system's most distant object is 'farout' pink dwarf planet
washington reuters scientists have discovered the most distant object known in our solar system so remote and unusual they chose the nickname farout for the icy pinkish dwarf planet about to times further from the sun than earth
astronomer scott sheppard of the carnegie institution for science in washington said on tuesday the dwarf planet officially designated as is estimated to have a diameter of to miles to km
there are roughly dwarf planets in the solar system
the biggest are pluto with a diameter of about miles km and eris with a diameter of about miles km
when i saw the object for the first time it was moving so slowly it was the slowest thing i ve ever seen
so i kind of muttered to myself far out kind of like that s but it s also a object in distance so that s why i went with calling it farout sheppard said
its discovery was announced on monday by the international astronomical union s minor planet center
we don t know too much about it sheppard added
we only detected it last month
from its brightness we can determine its size
we know its color
it has a pinkish reddish hue to it
if you put ices out there and you irradiate them from the solar radiation over time ices turn kind of a reddish pinkish color
so we think its surface is probably sheppard and other scientists spotted farout during their search for extremely distant solar system objects including a potential planet x that he said could be five to times the size of earth
in these researchers proposed the existence of a ninth major planet at the outer reaches of the solar system
they said farout is moving so slowly that it might need more than years for a single orbit of the sun
the observed solar system object is eris which orbits at about times the distance of the sun to the earth
pluto orbits at about times the distance of earth from the sun
