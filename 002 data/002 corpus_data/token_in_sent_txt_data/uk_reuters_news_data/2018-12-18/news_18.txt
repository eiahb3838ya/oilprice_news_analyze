update 2-vw may have to step up electric car plans to meet eu co2 targets
reuters volkswagen may have to step up its plans for mass production of electric vehicles in order to meet european targets to cut greenhouse emissions from cars its chief executive said on tuesday
the remarks came after the european union agreed on monday to cut emissions from cars by percent by and follow warnings from germany home to the bloc s biggest automotive industry that tough targets could cost jobs and harm the sector
this is more than the percent volkswagen vw still reeling from an emissions cheating scandal expected and would translate into a share for electric vehicles of more than percent of its expected total vehicle sales in ceo herbert diess said
this means that our planned restructuring programme which is needed to address this systemic change is not yet german economy minister peter altmaier said the targets were at the limit of what was technically and economically feasible
around industrial jobs in germany are tied to building petrol and diesel engined vehicles
this is a tough stretch and is at the higher end of expectations however we are convinced that this will help the industry to finally accept that combustion engines and platforms need to be standardized evercore isi analysts wrote
vw europe s largest carmaker has earmarked about billion euros billion pounds for the next five years to make sure it can achieve cuts of percent by retooling its production process to focus more on electric vehicles
the tougher eu targets diess said in remarks would require further changes to its strategy
restructuring our product portfolio possibly further reducing our combustion offering and a significant adjustment of our plant structures and additional battery cell and battery factories would be necessary diess said
he added the group s plans needed to be reviewed in autumn in line with the carmaker s planning calendar
overall vw plans to spend almost billion euros on developing electric cars autonomous driving and new mobility services by aiming to become the most profitable manufacturer of vehicles
german rivals bmw and daimler declined to comment on the eu targets referring instead to statements from industry groups
german car association vda said the targets were too high and criticised the lack of a clear roadmap for how the reductions would be reached
