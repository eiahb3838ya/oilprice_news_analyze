nigerian vote tough to call as week-long delay may hurt turnout
yola reuters nigerian teacher benjamin shagu flew km miles from the east of the country to the capital abuja to vote in the presidential election only for the vote to be delayed for a week just five hours before polls had been due to open
i have left my students for a week
i can t leave them for another week said the english teacher who travelled from the eastern city of yola weighing up the expense and disruption in returning to the city in which he registered to vote
many of the country s million eligible voters having spent considerable sums of money on travel face the same dilemma
the delay to the election now scheduled for saturday could depress turnout according to politicians and civil society groups
that in turn would reduce the mandate of the eventual winner to rule africa s most populous country and its biggest economy
the two main candidates president muhammadu buhari and former vice president atiku abubakar are also both over years old and have failed to generate significant excitement from a relatively youthful population
it disadvantages us because we need the turnout
our base is the youth population and they re the ones who can just easily get turned off from the whole process bukola saraki director general of atiku s campaign told reuters in an interview
the momentum was on our side he said
idayat hassan director of the think tank centre for democracy and development also said the delay would likely benefit buhari
his supporters had been galvanised in the last two elections with a high turnout in his core base in the northwest she said the region with the highest number of registered voters
the main opposition people s democratic party pdp typically attracts more support in the southeast a region where turnout has historically been low she said
yusuf tuggar a campaign team member of the ruling all progressives congress said his party would be hit harder because many of its northern supporters live in the south and could not afford to travel home
it hurts us more because we have more supporters he said
turnout in presidential elections has declined steadily since from nearly percent to just percent in
that is largely because of growing disenchantment with a political class seen as corrupt and out of touch with a population that includes a high proportion of people living in extreme poverty
hassan said that irrespective of the outcome lower voter numbers would be dangerous for the winner
sooner or later many people will question the legitimacy of elected representatives especially when they have not participated in the process said hassan
such concerns have led to the announcement of measures aimed at boosting turnout
the interior ministry said friday would be a public holiday to give people time to travel to the polls while fuel suppliers cut the price of petrol and a trade union that operates bus routes nationwide agreed to provide discounts for trips to voting points
the hope was that people would overcome the difficulties involved in making a second trek to the polls
i need to travel to perform my citizenship of nigeria said student francisca esidoy as she boarded a bus in the northern city of kano where she lives to make the kilometre miles journey to her southeastern home state of abia
but others could not be enticed
brauna afraimu a civil servant based in yola said he was too disillusioned to make the kilometre journey to nearby bauchi state
all these things will not motivate me to go and vote
i ve already spent a lot of my resources and time last week he said
