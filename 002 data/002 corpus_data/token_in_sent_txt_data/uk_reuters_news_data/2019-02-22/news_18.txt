update 2-iran still holding up its end of nuclear deal, iaea report shows
vienna reuters iran has remained within the key limits on its nuclear activities imposed by its deal with major powers despite growing pressure from newly reimposed sanctions a report by the nuclear watchdog showed on friday
the international atomic energy agency is policing the deal which lifted sanctions against tehran in exchange for restrictions on tehran s atomic activities aimed at increasing the time iran would need to make an atom bomb if it chose to
iran has stayed within caps on the level to which it can enrich uranium as well as its stock of enriched uranium the iaea said in a confidential quarterly report sent to its member states and obtained by reuters
not much has changed a continuing reporting of the implementation by iran a senior diplomat said on condition of anonymity summarising the report
the iaea also repeated its usual statement that it carried out complementary access inspections which are often at short notice at all locations in iran that it needed to visit
president donald trump pulled the united states out of the iran nuclear deal last may reimposing sanctions on iran s economy and lifeblood oil industry that were lifted under the agreement
european powers that signed the deal france britain and germany have sought to cushion the blow to iran of those sanctions
they are setting up a new channel for trade with iran but diplomats say it will not be able to handle the big transactions iran says it needs to keep the deal afloat
setting up that channel however has angered washington for undermining its effort to choke iran s economy in response to tehran s ballistic missile programme and its influence on the wars in syria and yemen
vice president mike pence last week called on those european powers to follow washington in pulling out of the agreement despite their position that the deal is worth keeping as long as iran sticks to it
the islamic republic has long said that it wants nuclear power only for purposes of civilian energy
iran s stock of heavy water a substance used as a moderator in some nuclear reactors stayed within the limit set by the deal and tehran continued to ship some of it out of the country with tonne having been exported during the quarter
the senior official said it was sold to an unspecified iaea member state
