we have to be a global player coordinating maritime minister luhut pandjaitan said in an interview in which he mapped out a broader strategy to go beyond simply exporting batteries or battery chemicals
indonesia the car production hub in southeast asia after thailand last month announced plans to introduce a fiscal scheme that will offer tax cuts to ev battery producers and automakers as well as preferential tariff agreements with other countries that have a high ev demand
of course maybe we can export these batteries
but then if you build a factory here you can also supply batteries to cars produced in indonesia said pandjaitan who also oversees energy mining and transportation

indonesia and australia are expected to sign a free trade agreement next month
