australian trade minister says import quotas, not blanket ban, slowing coal exports to china
sydney feb reuters australia s minister for trade simon birmingham said on friday delays to exports of coal to china were caused by import quotas and not a blanket ban on australian coal
the australian dollar fell more than percent on thursday after reuters reported that customs at dalian had banned imports of australia s biggest export earner since the start of february
birmingham however denied australia has been unduly treated
we have no basis to believe that there is a ban on australian coal exports into china or into any part of china birmingham told reporters adelaide
the application of those quotas combined with different testing and the quality assurance and environment is testing centres may be slowing down the processing of costing data of coal in certain parts of reporting by colin packham editing by sam holmes
