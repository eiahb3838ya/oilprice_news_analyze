refile-insight-the battle for citgo: how venezuela opposition leaders seized control
corrects spelling of citgo ceo s first name to asdrubal in first paragraph by marianna parraga feb reuters asdrubal chavez chief executive of citgo petroleum corp boarded the firm s corporate jet in caracas on after meeting with top officials of the embattled administration of socialist president nicolas maduro about the latest oil sanctions
upon landing in the bahamas where chavez has worked for about a year after being denied a visa he had received word from houston that it would be his last trip on a company plane and that his citgo email account had been shut off
control of the company had passed to citgo s top executive rick esser who with the backing of venezuela s rising political opposition and the government would begin clearing the way for a new board of directors at citgo
esser oversaw the moves to isolate chavez a cousin of the late venezuelan president hugo chavez and would soon start ousting other citgo executives close to the maduro administration
the at the prized subsidiary of venezuela s oil firm petroleos de venezuela pdvsa marked a crucial early victory for the country s rising opposition government led by president juan guaido as it struggles to remove maduro from office and break his grip on the opec nation s oil assets
the account of the transition of power at citgo is based on reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former citgo and pdvsa executives employees and and latin american advisors
guaido head of the nation s congress announced he would seize the presidency on because maduro s last year was a sham rendering the socialist leader illegitimate under venezuela law
guaido s claim to interim leadership until fair elections can be held was quickly backed by the united states and dozens of other nations
but maduro remains in control of the nation s military and pdvsa making citgo the obvious first target among national asset for guaido s opposition movement to claim with the help of the government
the battle for citgo could prove pivotal in the effort to unseat maduro because full control of a major refiner would provide a crucial source of revenue to a administration
citgo with more than billion in annual sales and operations that supply about percent of fuels may be the last remaining asset owned by pdvsa with a healthy balance sheet
as pdvsa s oil production and revenue have plummeted amid crippling debt mismanagement and international political pressure citgo s location and financial independence have shielded the firm from the worst of its parent company s meltdown

a meeting between white house national security advisor john bolton and citgo executives thrust the esser into the spotlight after bolton tweeted a photo of the meeting calling it very officials have voiced concern that guaido and his supporters had been too slow in seizing control of citgo and also have pushed for a say in choosing members of the refiner s new board a request guaido s team declined according to two people familiar with the talks
since clearing citgo s upper ranks of maduro allies esser has focused on securing alternatives to the venezuelan oil that feeds its refineries
recent sanctions prevent the firm from importing venezuelan crude after april which could cripple the company unless it can ensure it has the cash credit and contracts for alternate supplies
advisors to the incoming citgo board have separately urged officials to exempt citgo from sanctions and protect its assets from creditors once it is officially controlled by guaido s team
esser saw this crisis coming two years ago and put together a group to find new suppliers and test their oils in the event venezuelan crudes were restricted by sanctions according to a person familiar with the effort
the firm s efforts to sustain operations face a threat from creditors owed money by venezuela and pdvsa who could try to use that leverage to hamstring citgo s finances said carlos jorda a former citgo chairman and now a houston business consultant
the government could help the company hold off that threat he said
the treasury could say hold your horses you ll get paid but not paid by citgo but by venezuela when the maduro regime exits jorda said

palacios and other board members which include former citgo and pdvsa executives living in the united states did not respond to requests for comment
one of their priorities will be to audit the finances of a refinery project in aruba said the two people close to palacios
pdvsa and citgo agreed to a million overhaul of the idled facility in causing some citgo executives to resign in protest arguing the deal made no business sense
on monday citgo aruba refining officially put the venture on hold and laid off workers citing the impact of sanctions on pdvsa
the project has been clouded by corruption allegations according to four former and current citgo employees and two people close to the new citgo board
