insurance not enough to offset financial risks of climate change, analysts say
london feb thomson reuters foundation from homeowners facing higher flood insurance premiums to investors putting money into power plants financial risks related to climate change are growing analysts say
but working out how a switch to train travel could affect an airline or what an insurance firm should do to weather more flood claims is neither clear nor simple they say
help may be at hand however from guides published on friday to assess financial risks from the physical threats of climate change as well as the risks and opportunities of a global transition away from fossil fuels
what is the exposure financial institutions have to natural catastrophes
i don t think that question traditionally has been asked said greg lowe global head of resilience and sustainability for aon a insurance and risk firm
for disasters there s always been an assumption we have insurance for that said lowe whose firm contributed to the reports by climatewise an initiative of the university of cambridge institute for sustainability leadership that aims to better disclose and respond to insurance risks
with those risks growing particularly as emissions continue to rise traditional methods of dealing with them may not be enough as the world tracks toward degrees celsius or more of global warming the twin reports warn
if indeed people think we re headed on that path past it s going to be a hugely difficult task for the financial system to manage lowe predicted
over the next years the risks from heatwaves storm surges and floods will increase substantially because of warming already underway the physical threats report noted
in britain that could lead to higher flood insurance premiums and people more often made homeless by floods as well as greater investment by cities and towns in flood defences
that homeowners understand changing flood risks and will respond adequately to them is probably a generous assumption lowe said
but even for those who do grasp the shift simply boosting insurance coverage is unlikely to be an answer he said
i don t think buying more insurance is a politically or financially sustainable thing to do he said
even with insurance this is still a tremendous hardship on people if they are out of their rather there should be honest discussions about who foots the bill for the growing risk and damage he said
someone is going to pay for this
how that gets distributed through the financial system is the question he added
the new reports aim to demonstrate that it is possible to start taking a more precise look at the risks and their financial impacts and to give experts tools to do that said bronwyn claire senior programme manager for climatewise
for instance they could explore how changes in transport demand between trains and planes or a carbon tax that is influencing fuel prices might affect an airport in germany
the guides could also help investors spot opportunities she added
