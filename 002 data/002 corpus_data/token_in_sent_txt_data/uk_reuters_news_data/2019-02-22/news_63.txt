rpt-focus-engie to scale back overseas, cut costs to boost revenues - sources
repeats story from thursday engie to announce new strategy plan next week insiders say engie needs a big deal to restore cash flows state stake sale would increase vulnerability to activists engie shares among most undervalued in eu utilities index by geert de clercq and benjamin mallet paris feb reuters utility engie is poised to cut back its geographical spread of businesses and focus on grids and renewables in a billion euro drive to bolster revenues sources familiar with the matter said
engie has been criticised for being too complex and and ceo isabelle kocher is expected to address this in a corporate strategy plan to be announced next thursday when the company also releases results
two sources with knowledge of the company s plans said kocher was likely to scale back the number of countries engie operates in it is present in some countries notably in central europe
both said kocher would focus the gas and power group more strongly on grids and renewables after selling some billion worth of related assets in
one of the two sources a union official said kocher would aim to cut costs by billion over three years extending a billion euro cost reduction plan in
daily business newsletter la lettre a had first reported that engie was targeting a plan
engie will also need to acquire at least one business too make up for cash flow lost in its move away from fossil fuels two sources including a banker said
the plan will have to involve major acquisitions
the planets are aligned but the target remains to be decided one of them said
potential targets include the transportadora associada de gás pipeline owned by petrobras dutch renewables utility eneco or the renewable energy assets of portugual s edps sources said
engie cut is net debt to core earnings ratio to at the end of from two years earlier
it can further boost its financial firepower by selling part of its percent stake in french gas transport firm grtgaz which will become possible under the government s new loi pacte law
engie declined to comment on strategy or potential targets ahead of next week s presentation
more than anything kocher and new chairman clamadieu have to come with plan that reduces engie s conglomerate discount and boosts its shares
this is because the government s plan to cut its percent holding will remove engie s best defence against activist investors
for now the state s presence is a deterrent for activist investors but once it leaves engie becomes a possible target said an investment banker familiar with the company s thinking
activist investor elliott management s acquisition of a percent stake in drinks firm pernod ricard in december has focused minds across france s bluechip index on the need for a clear strategy attractive valuation and close relationships with major shareholders
at german rival uniper the presence of elliott and activist investor knight vinke has become a source of tension in the company s relationship with finnish shareholder fortum
engie s deeply discounted stock price shows the valuation potential of splitting off some of the group s assets
with a ratio engie is the undervalued share in the stoxx european utilities index with only uniper more undervalued by that measure refinitiv eikon data shows
more focused utilities trade at much higher multiples with renewable energy group orsted and innogy around times book and grid pureplays like red electrica and terna trading at nearly three times book
engie s conglomerate discount is due to its complexity one banker said
a large institutional investor said the company was a black box incomprehensible to investors
bankers and advisers say kocher s biggest problem engie s nuclear assets in belgium may offer its strongest defence against an activist attack
belgium plans to phase out nuclear energy by which will leave engie the expensive task of decommissioning its seven nuclear plants there
when an activist takes aim at a company it is usually because he sees something that management doesn t
but i don t see what solution an activist could bring for belgian nuclear the banker said
