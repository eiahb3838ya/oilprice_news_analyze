update 4-canadian regulator backs oil pipeline expansion, urges whale protections
winnipeg manitoba reuters canada s national energy board neb regulator recommended on friday that ottawa approve expansion of the trans mountain oil pipeline but made new nonbinding recommendations to mitigate harm to pacific ocean killer whales
the pipeline is in the national interest as it will create jobs and allow canadian oil to reach more markets the neb said in a report
but expanding it is likely to significantly harm the killer whale population off the coast of british columbia and increase greenhouse gas emissions from ships the board said in its report
a spill while unlikely would also be damaging it said
the neb made new recommendations ranging from offsetting increased underwater noise to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships
the recommendations constitute nonbinding advice to the government
ottawa in september directed the board to conduct a new review of its application to nearly triple the capacity of trans mountain which the government bought for c billion billion last year from kinder morgan canada to ensure it gets built
the move came after canada s federal court of appeal overturned the liberal government s approval to expand the pipeline which runs from alberta to the british columbia coast
the court ruled that the neb failed to consider marine impacts and that the government did not adequately consult indigenous groups
the neb s ruling is a political win albeit with mixed implications for prime minister justin trudeau ahead of a fall election
he faces both anger from western canadians over the oil industry s struggles and pressure from environmentally minded voters who do not want pipelines built
canada s oil production has expanded faster than pipeline capacity causing a glut last year that depressed prices
the neb s reaffirmation that the project is of national interest was essential said tim mcmillan president of the canadian association of petroleum producers
pending government legislation will make regulatory approval of future pipelines more difficult making it more important that the ones already in the queue get built he said
given recurring delays companies that drill wells remain doubtful trans mountain will be expanded said mark scholz chief executive of the canadian association of oilwell drilling contractors calling canada the black hole of the neb s report now goes to trudeau and his cabinet which by law has days to respond
consultation with indigenous groups is well under way and the government is in a strong position to decide within that time frame but has made no decision natural resources minister amarjeet sohi said in an interview
sohi said the neb s recommendations broadly align with his government s values but that it needs more time to study them
the southern resident killer whale population is already endangered and even the pipeline s relatively minor impacts would cause additional harm including from potential strikes by ships the board s chief environment officer robert steedman said
the board s decision is unsurprising given that the neb limited its review to nautical miles of the whales habitat and refused to consider the impact on areas said eugene kung lawyer at west coast environmental law
the fix was in from the start he said
this project amounts to a death sentence for the south resident the neb failed to produce evidence that the pipeline s expansion will benefit the economy said elizabeth may leader of canada s green party
the board also imposed binding conditions including issues of emergency preparedness and consultation with indigenous communities
