buhari a former military ruler who was later elected president in was criticised on monday for saying that anyone trying to intimidate voters or interfere with the voting will do it at the expense of his own life
atiku s party said buhari s comments were a call for jungle justice
members of buhari s all progressives congress party and those of atiku s pdp have accused each other of being behind the delay and colluding with the electoral commission
neither party has publicly provided evidence to back up their allegations
the inec s chairman mahmood yakoob has insisted that the vote will go ahead on saturday

buhari faces a close contest against atiku to lead a country that has africa s largest economy and is its top oil producer but is plagued by corruption and wide gaps between rich and poor
the election has been fought over buhari s handling of the economy amid fragile growth and growing unemployment as the country recovers from a recession in
