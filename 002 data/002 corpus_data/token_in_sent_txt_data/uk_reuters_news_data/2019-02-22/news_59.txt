analysis-asia's surging fuel exports depress refining industry profits
singapore reuters asia s biggest oil consumers are flooding the region with fuel as refining output is exceeding consumption amid a slowdown in demand growth pressuring industry profits
since the has been the world s biggest oil consuming region led by traditional industrial users south korea and japan along with rising economic powerhouses china and india
yet overbuilding of refineries and currently sluggish demand growth have caused a jump in fuel exports from these demand hubs
car sales in china the world s oil user fell for the first time on record last year and early sales also remain weak implying a slowdown in gasoline demand
for diesel china national petroleum corp in january said it expected demand to fall by percent in
that would be china s first annual demand decline for a major fuel since its industrial ascent started in
the surge in fuel exports combined with a percent jump in crude oil prices so far this year has collapsed singapore refinery margins the asian benchmark from more than per barrel in to just over
combine the slumping margins with labour costs and taxes and many asian refineries now struggle to make money
the squeezed margins have pummelled the stocks of most major asian petroleum companies such as japan s refiners jxtg holdings inc or idemitsu kosan south korea s top oil processor sk innovation asia s top oil refiner china petroleum chemical corp and indian oil with some companies dropping by about percent over the past year
jeff brown the president of energy consultancy fge said the surge in exports and resulting oversupply were a big problem for the industry
the pressure on refinery margins is a case of death by a thousand cuts refinery upgrades throughout the region are bumping up against softening demand growth he said

refinitiv shipping data shows fuel exports from those countries have risen since to a record of around million tonnes in january
the biggest jump in exports has come from china where refiners are selling off record amounts of excess fuel into asia
there is a risk for asian market turmoil if china s fuel export capacity remains at the current level or grows further said noriaki sakai chief executive officer at idemitsu kosan during a news conference last week
but japan s and south korea s fuel exports have also risen as demand at home falls amid mature industry and a shrinking population
japan s oil demand will drop by percent from while south korea s will remain flat according to forecasts from energy aspects
in japan oil imports have been falling steadily for years yet its refiners produce more fuel than its industry can absorb
the situation is similar in south korea the world s refiner by capacity according to data from bp plc
cho an official at the korea petroleum association which represents south korean refiners said the surging exports had triggered a gasoline glut
that glut caused negative gasoline margins in january
compounding the supply overhang in asia fuel exports from the middle east which the bp data shows added more than million barrels per day bpd of refining capacity from to have doubled since to around million tonnes according to refinitiv estimates
even more fuel is set to come
malaysia s petroliam nasional bhd is starting up its rapid refinery capable of processing bpd of crude while china and india also have several projects coming online this year and next
asia is expected to lead the global refining industry both in terms of capacity as well as capital expenditure between and data analytics firm globaldata said in a report published this week
between and new refineries are expected to become operational in asia said the report adding that this would increase petroleum products exports from asia
despite so many refineries coming to the market the outlook is not entirely bleak
fge s brown said new regulations by the international maritime organization imo that will require shippers to reduce the sulphur content in their fuel from next year meant demand for products like diesel and fuel oil lsfo would rise and improve refinery profits
the main relief will come as the market shifts into mode in the fourth quarter said brown
margins will recover restoring order to the for a graphic on middle east refined product exports to asia see reporting by henning gloystein in singapore additional reporting by jane chung in seoul and yuka obayashi in tokyo editing by christian schmollinger
