water deal crucial for kenya oil project might slip into q3-tullow
water needed to pressurise kenya s first oil wells plan has been to reach water deal in first indication of kenya crude pricing expected next week by shadia nasralla nairobi feb reuters a deal with local kenyan authorities that would allow tullow oil to pump water to pressurise oil wells crucial for a final green light for the country s only oil project may be delayed to the third quarter a tullow executive said on friday
tullow with partners total and africa oil is working towards a final investment decision fid by and had hoped the water deal would be reached by tullow s kenya managing director martin mbogo said
i would probably realistically put it more for in terms of landing that agreement mbogo told reuters referring to the deal organising the way tullow can tap a body of water straddling two counties in northwestern kenya
it s one of those things we absolutely need before we can get to tullow estimates that kenya s onshore fields in turkana province hold million barrels of oil and expects them to produce up to barrels per day from
another milestone to pass is land acquisition for infrastructure around the oil fields and the km pipeline to the indian ocean for which it plans to send out construction tenders within weeks
the government recently gazetted land it wants to buy in order to lease it to the oil partners
having clarity on land acquisition and pipeline tariffs is crucial to reach a final investment decision on the billion project which tullow wants to make money at a barrel
there is good but slower than expected progress on the land issue mbogo said
this week the kenyan government together with tullow approached potential buyers of kenya s crude including asian refiners like india s reliance independent oil groups and majors such as royal dutch shell
there will be further such meetings during international petroleum week in london next week to see whether buyers are willing to pay a premium to brent crude for kenyan oil
the government has an option to buy up to percent in both the fields and the pipeline which tullow expects it to exercise at least in part before the final investment decision
kenya has mooted floating its national oil company as holder of such a stake on the nairobi and london bourses
the oil ministry was not immediately available for comment on this
