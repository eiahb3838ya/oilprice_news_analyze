china says smog fight will continue even as economic pressures mount
beijing reuters china s battle against toxic air pollution is becoming increasingly difficult but the government will not relent in its efforts even as the economy slows an environment ministry official told reporters on wednesday
china has been shutting vast swathes of industrial capacity curbing traffic and cutting coal use in regions of the north but the ministry of ecology and environment warned last week that an economic slowdown was making the campaign against smog more challenging
last winter factories complained their businesses were hurt after indiscriminate production cuts forced them to close whether they had installed pollution controls or not
with july to september economic growth at its slowest quarterly rate since beijing is adopting a more nuanced approach this year
but while the government has set more pragmatic targets based on actual economic conditions poor weather is expected to make northern regions even more vulnerable to smog this winter and the campaign will be even more strenuous said liu youbin spokesman for the environment ministry
when making this winter plan we have to make sure it is feasible and achievable and it can not be too it will get harder and harder in the future to reduce pollution liu said
it is biased and not accurate to say china will relax measures he added
though smog has been cut rapidly during a war on pollution now in its fifth year environmental groups have warned that china has been backsliding on its environmental commitments allowing coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to creep back up
coal use fell in and but it has since recovered and carbon emissions could end up overtaking the record estimated at gigatonnes
but china s senior climate change official li gao told the wednesday briefing that while coal consumption has been on the increase the country s power plants are among the world s most efficient and the share of power continues to decline
energy consumption is closely connected to economic development and affected by the economic situation he said
power does have appeal to local governments if not considering external conditions so it will take time to tackle this problem it s normal to see some volatility on coal use in some years but our core policy is not changing and that volatility will not stop us reaching the targets said li in the sideline of the briefing
