black gold, white knuckles: oil refiners face rollercoaster ride as fuel margins seesaw
volatile refinery margins fuel oil and gasoil cracks soar gasoline plummets fuel oil supported by looming iran sanctions imo pushes up gasoil profits these cracks are extraordinary trifecta by henning gloystein singapore oct reuters oil product margins have been tossed around on a wild rollercoaster ride in october as factors like impending iran sanctions the trade war and upcoming new shipping regulations yank fuel profits up down and back again
some margins known as cracks including for asian fuel oil and gasoil have boomed while others like asian and european gasoline cracks have plunged
asia s cracks for gasoil and fuel oil have gained percent and a whopping percent respectively since the start of the year with most of the jump happening this month
these cracks are extraordinary said sukrit vijayakar director of indian energy consultancy trifecta
vijayakar a veteran of india s refining industry said such high gasoil and fuel oil cracks should move a refiner to maximise these products
keenly aware that these cracks are extraordinary he the refiner should protect such production decisions by hedging the cracks as an insurance to protect windfall gains vijayakar said
the margin on fuel oil a residue from crude processing is typically negative
in the last week of october however it stood at around per barrel pushed up in part by tightening supply ahead of sanctions against iran a major supplier of fueloil which the united states will impose from next week
another strong performer has been distillate fuel including gasoil
one of the biggest drivers here has been new regulation by the international maritime organization imo
this will force shippers to adopt cleaner fuel standards from and it pushing up demand for gasoil made from heavy crude
in an imo world we expect distillate margins will increase goldman sachs said on wednesday in a note to clients
we expect refiners with access to heavy crude barrels and yields to benefit most from the not all has been rosy in refining
this year has been particularly painful for refiners specialised in churning out gasoline
booming auto sales in emerging markets and especially china which sells more than million new cars every month but also healthy demand from the united states have in the past made gasoline a favourite among refiners many of whom maximised its yield
that boom has turned into a bust as refiners now pump more than even this growing market can absorb eroding profit margins
european refiners sent their excess fuel to asia hoping to find a home there for their surplus petrol
this came just as china s massive refinery sector started exporting excess gasoline as even its thirsty domestic market couldn t cope with the flood of fuel
analysts say things may get worse especially if an economic slowdown on the back of widespread emerging market currency weakness and the trade war sucks demand out from under a sector already swamped by glut
gasoline fundamentals continue to deteriorate and are a source of concern for us goldman sachs said on wednesday
