column-like silicon valley? miners face uphill slog in drive to go digital: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell melbourne oct reuters the mining industry wants to shed its image as a shoveller of dirt and instead be seen as a cutting edge employer of choice
it s a feat that could be compared to teaching an elephant to ballet dance
while mining companies have been quick to adopt new technologies to drive costs lower there is an increasing recognition that the industry needs to embrace the digital revolution if it is to prosper in the future
this means moving well beyond the driverless trains and trucks that have helped australia s major iron ore miners cut the cost of producing a tonne of the material by about over the past decade
harnessing technology and the people to use it was an theme at this week s international mining and resources conference imarc
but there was also tacit recognition that the industry is a long way from being attractive to the type of workers it will need if it is to harness the advantages of digital technologies
one speaker at the event related the story of a mining executive addressing students studying technology degrees at a university
when asked for a show of hands of who wanted to work in a industry committed to innovation and providing the materials needed for an electrified and economy virtually every hand went up
when the same students were asked to keep their hands up if they wanted to work in mining and virtually every hand dropped
rio tinto chief executive jacques told the conference that the industry needs to change the barbecue conversation
our industry is one of least trusted in the world he said in his keynote address on
the point is that mining needs to be seen as a positive force for the future of the world delivering the metals needed for electric vehicles renewable energy and the technologies that improve lifestyles
while the mining industry talks often about earning the social licence to operate it appears that there is now some appreciation that its needs to go beyond just engaging with the communities where it operates and to take its case to the wider public
how mining companies are going to achieve this remains the challenge
the industry hasn t been exactly that effective in convincing the public especially in advanced western democracies that it is part of the solution to the world s problems
in many ways the mining industry is losing the public relations battle against environmental activists
many of the latter fail to distinguish between the various types of commodities being mined the processes being used in extraction and the usefulness of the resource in helping or hindering action against climate change
the fact that mining industry groups are too often linked with coal also hurts the industry as a whole given the polluting fuel acts as a lightning rod for green activists
rio s jacques made the point that miners should be more engaged with social media saying who you are on social media is who you are
while his own company s twitter feed does do more than just parrot company press releases it has only followers
the main greenpeace feed has million and the worldwide fund for nature has almost million
a scan of twitter suggests jacques does not appear to have a verified account in his capacity as rio ceo and nor do bhp chief executive andrew mackenzie or glencore chief executive ivan glasenberg
perhaps if mining companies want to engage young people and convince them that the industry is an exciting place to work they should do more to reach out directly to them
the opportunities are definitely there
javier orellana the digital transformation lead at industrial software developer aveva told imarc that the industry could save as much as billion by by adopting digital technologies
certainly the nature of conferences like imarc has changed in recent years with significantly more presentations on technology and innovation and a rise in the number of companies highlighting digital technologies almost to the point where they outnumber the more traditional miners and engineering contractors
there is little doubt that mining companies are keen to embrace more technology
but it also appears that they aren t quite sure how to win over scepticism among the youth that they will need to do the work
