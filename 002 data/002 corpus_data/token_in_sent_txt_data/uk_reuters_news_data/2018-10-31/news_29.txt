update 1-anadarko may trim colorado work if oil drilling curbs pass
houston reuters oil and gas producer anadarko petroleum corp on wednesday said it may shift some investment out of colorado if voters in that state approve a ballot proposal that limits drilling in populated areas
the measure would put at least percent of new oil and gas development on lands off limits to new drilling the colorado oil and gas conservation commission has said
oil companies have raised tens of millions to oppose the measure
anadarko could shift focus to properties in the delaware basin which spans west texas and new mexico if colorado voters on november pass a law requiring up to separations between new wells and homes schools and parks executives said during an earnings conference call
we are interested in what s going to happen in colorado
that will have some impact in terms of where we ll allocate capital said chief executive al walker
the company s backlog of wells and approved well permits in colorado give it confidence in what it has scheduled in the state next year regardless of the vote executives added
pressure pumper liberty oilfield services which is headquartered in denver also said on wednesday that approval of the state s proposition drilling rules could affect its operations
it does not expect passage of the law to immediately curtail activity in the state liberty chief executive chris wright said on a call
that proposal would render a lot of lands undrillable
it s having the effect of oil companies shifting rigs out of colorado now and looking at the powder river basin and permian and bakken said gregory reid president of investment management firm salient mlp complex
if the rule is struck down shares of oil companies that have been negatively impacted by proposition could rally reid added
shares of anadarko were down percent tp in midday trading on wednesday even as analysts said its earnings were with expectations
