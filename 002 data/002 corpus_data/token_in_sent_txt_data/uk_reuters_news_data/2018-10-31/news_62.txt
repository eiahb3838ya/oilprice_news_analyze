japan's nuclear industry growing, but slower than government hoped
tokyo reuters japan s resurgent nuclear industry will miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country s electricity by a reuters analysis shows
with eight reactors running and one more set to come online in november nuclear has this year overtaken renewables in power output for the first time since the catastrophe when all of the country s nuclear plants were idled
yet operators can expect as few as six units to restart in the next five years and fewer than by the analysis shows
that is far short of the needed to meet the government target reiterated this year
based on the analysis the world s economy may get about percent of its power from nuclear in compared with a government target of percent
it s impossible to meet the target that s pretty much confirmed said takeo kikkawa an energy studies professor at tokyo university of science who sat on an official panel that reviewed japan s energy policy this year
he said he did not expect another round of restarts before
one major trading house predicts nuclear will account for percent of power production in according to a presentation given at a private seminar this year and shown to reuters
nuclear remains an unpopular energy option in japan and the country will reboot only a fraction of the reactors it had before the disaster
six reactors at fukushima daiichi are being dismantled in a exercise that is fraught with technological challenges and radioactive waste
operators have decided to decommission another units across the country since fukushima
the nuclear regulation authority created new safety standards from scratch after the disaster highlighted failings in the industry and its overseers
all reactors must be relicensed before restarting
yet japan s nuclear industry which before fukushima operated the world s number of reactors and provided about percent of the country s electricity has staged a significant recovery
the turnaround has exceeded expectations of analysts and the utilities themselves
kansai electric power and kyushu electric power for instance have won approval to restart or are on course to win approval for all the reactors they applied to relicense
those units are far from tokyo and are pressurised water reactors pwr unlike the boiling water reactor bwr designs favoured in eastern japan including those that melted down at fukushima
many court cases are pending for reactors in the east of the country
local political support varies and the regulator is locked in disputes with operators over earthquake risk assessment
the older bwr technology used in many of the reactors under review is also an issue because the stigma of fukushima hangs over them
when you come to the bwrs the issue becomes very politicized said nobuo tanaka the chairman of the sasakawa peace foundation who was the head of the international energy agency between and after a stint in japan s industry ministry
the reputation of tepco which operates two nuclear plants that have been damaged in natural disasters also looms large tanaka said
tepco does not have any support as a nuclear operator he said
the utility has to be removed from the equation before progress on bwr reactors can be made he said
tepco has reached the first stage of approval but faces strong opposition from local residents
but japan s utility lobby group said progress was being made
the safety reviews of pwr plants took time but they have been progressing steadily and there have been some developments in the bwr category as well satoru katsuno the chairman of japan s federation of electric utilities and president of chubu electric said of the outlook for restart approvals
chubu electric has been locked in a dispute for years with the regulator over disaster resilience measures at its hamaoka plant which uses bwr reactors

that will make it harder to meet its emissions targets under international agreement
the government estimates costs for replacement fuel mostly liquefied natural gas to compensate for idled reactors totalled trillion yen billion across the industry in the six years through march
the lack of realistic energy targets makes it harder for the industry to plan for investment utility officials say
and the issue of disaster resilience is not going away a big earthquake struck the northern island of hokkaido in september and left a nuclear plant reliant on backup generators
