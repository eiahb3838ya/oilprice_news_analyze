indonesia imposes mandatory use of b20 biodiesel in drive to cut fuel bill -deputy minister
singapore reuters indonesia has enforced mandatory use of diesel containing percent locally produced biofuel amid steps to rein in its fuel bill and cushion the impact on its economy of a currency crisis and higher oil prices a government official told reuters
speaking on the sidelines of the singapore international energy week conference deputy energy minister arcandra tahar said jakarta in september made use of the fuel known as mandatory in all diesel machinery in the country in a move to curb gasoil imports
major emerging asian economies including indonesia have been hit hard this year by rising crude oil prices which despite declining this month are still up by about percent since the start of while the rupiah indonesia s currency has hit a low this year
is there any impact the rupiah and oil prices will have on our economy
yes do we have a corrective action
yes we do said tahar
while industry watchers have been debating the possibility of indonesia introducing fuel price controls as india did this month amid similar troubles jakarta has yet to announce any such move
although indonesia is an exporter of crude oil itself it imports even more refined products including gasoline and diesel
that is putting huge pressure on the government budget and pertamina the country s oil company which is being squeezed between government fuel polices higher oil prices and the rupiah s slide
tahar said he expected indonesia s use of fuel in the farming sector to increase to million kilolitres next year from the current nearly million kilolitres
southeast asia s largest economy is also trying to boost the locally sourced fuel content in the oil gas and mining sectors by giving them a percent cut of gross tax revenue if they use at least percent of local content he said
if you have gross revenue of billion and using percent of local content you are going to get an incentive of percent or around million tahar said
that s a huge number compared to the cost saving you may get if you import from another last month jakarta s trade ministry issued a requirement to use letters of credit from banks affiliated with indonesian banks to help shore up the ailing rupiah
this will apply to the mining sector tahar said
a pertamina official said last week that it is looking to buy crude oil purchases in other currencies to reduce spending of foreign exchange in dollars
tahar said however that would be difficult as the main oil market in singapore trades in dollars
in the electricity sector meanwhile indonesia is switching primary sources of power plants from diesel to crude palm oil he said also a move to reduce the country s exposure to high oil prices
in the longer term he said indonesia plans to encourage the use of electric vehicles as it pushes to shake off its dependency on oil imports and boost energy security
he did not give specific examples of how the government would boost usage of electric vehicles
but he said oil product demand growth for next year will remain steady at percent
