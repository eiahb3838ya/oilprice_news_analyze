almost million venezuelans have fled since driven out by food and medicine shortages hyperinflation and violent crime
thousands have made their way to south florida
bolton s speech will come a day after trump was due to campaign in florida for republican candidates in tight senate and gubernatorial races in the elections and a day before former president barack obama was scheduled to rally democrats in miami
he is expected to be introduced by longtime republican representative ileana who is retiring from congress
the first elected to congress has been critical of trump but supported the hard line he has taken on cuba
trump has rolled back parts of obama s detente with cuba tightening rules on americans travelling to the island and restricting companies from doing business there
but trump has maintained diplomatic relations under obama with the former cold war foe
trump last month linked venezuela s economic collapse to its cuban sponsors in a speech to the united nations and bolton is expected to elaborate on that theme a senior administration official told reporters earlier this month
the trump administration plans to ramp up economic pressure on cuba s military and intelligence services the official said
the white house also wants to increase pressure on venezuela
on monday secretary of state mike pompeo discussed working on the issue with brazil s new jair bolsonaro
the government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist president nicolas maduro who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country s economic implosion
maduro who denies limiting political freedoms has said he is the victim of an economic war led by adversaries
earlier this year the trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting venezuela s oil sector but now sees less immediate need to do so given sagging production by the opec member
