study estimates 190,000 people killed in south sudan's civil war
nairobi reuters an estimated people have been killed in south sudan s civil war and when factors such as population displacement disruption to health facilities and lack of food are included the death toll is at least an independent study said

about south sudanese have died as a result of the civil war
the true number may be considerably higher said the study by researchers at london school of hygiene and tropical medicine released on tuesday
while it is plausible that some insecurity would have persisted in south sudan even without the civil war we are confident that a large majority of the violent deaths were attributable to the war itself it said
