update 1-climate-related financial disclosure becoming more mainstream-g20 task force
london reuters disclosure is becoming mainstream as more firms support and align their financial reporting to recommendations by a global task force though few disclose the financial impact on the company a survey shows
the task force on financial disclosures tcfd was set up by the s financial stability board at the end of to develop a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of risks and opportunities
this was partly in response to concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in threatening market stability
the framework launched in june last year applies to a wide range of sectors including financial sector organisations banks insurance companies asset managers and asset owners
in its first status report the tcfd surveyed the disclosures of companies and found that most were revealing information which was aligned with at least one of the task force s recommendations
today s announcement shows that climate disclosure is becoming mainstream
over companies are now supporters of the tcfd including the world s largest banks asset managers and pension funds responsible for assets of nearly trillion mark carney chair of the financial stability board said in a statement
this compares to the support of firms when the framework was launched last year
while many companies described risks and opportunities few disclosed the financial impact of climate change on the company the task force said
disclosures vary across industries the survey found
for example more companies reported their metrics and targets than financial companies did
but financial firms were more likely to disclose how they had embedded climate risk into their overall risk management
a minority of companies disclosed climate targets or the resilience of their strategies under different scenarios including a degree celsius or lower temperature limit
climate change can lead to droughts floods and extreme storms
as such events become more common people turn to insurance to cover the costs of damage which can increase premiums
there can also be a effect on house prices for example which can damage the overall economy
for oil gas and power companies as the world turns to a economy two thirds of the world s fossil fuel reserves can not be burnt
that undermines the value of assets held by such companies and also investments in them by banks and other financial institutions
in a separate report on wednesday the bank of england said only percent of banks in britain are managing climate risks with comprehensive plans
the international energy agency estimates that the switch to a economy will cost on average trillion in investments a year for the foreseeable future
however the value at risk of the global total stock of manageable assets due to climate change could be anywhere from trillion to trillion between now and the end of the century according to the economist intelligence unit
the tcfd will publish another status report in june next year which will analyse the disclosures made in financial reports
