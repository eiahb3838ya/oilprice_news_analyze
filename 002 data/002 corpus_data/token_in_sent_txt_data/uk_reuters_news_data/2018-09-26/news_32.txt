update 2-trump says he wants two-state solution for mideast conflict
united nations reuters president donald trump said on wednesday he wanted a solution to resolve the conflict the clearest expression yet of his administration s support for such an outcome
the trump administration has said in the past it would support a solution if both sides agreed to it
trump also said in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the united nations general assembly he wanted to unveil a peace plan in the next two to three months
i like a solution
that s what i think works best that s my feeling trump said
netanyahu has said any future palestinian state must be demilitarized and must recognise israel as the state of the jewish people conditions that palestinians say show he is not sincere about peacemaking
the united states arab allies are strong proponents of a solution
trump said at a news conference in new york later on wednesday he would be open to a solution if that was the preference of the parties themselves a position he had previously stated
if the israelis and the palestinians want one state that s ok with me
if they want two states that s ok with me he said
i m happy if they re doubts have mounted over whether trump s administration can secure what he has called the ultimate deal since december when the president recognised jerusalem as israel s capital and then moved the embassy there
trump said it is a dream of mine to secure an agreement before the end of his term in office in early
i don t want to do it in my second term
we ll do other things in my second term he said
i think a lot of progress has been netanyahu said after meeting trump he was not surprised at the president s preference for a solution for peace with the palestinians israeli media reports said
jerusalem is one of the major issues in the conflict
both sides claim it as their capital
trump s move outraged the palestinians who have since boycotted washington s peace efforts led by trump s and adviser jared kushner
the palestinians want to establish a state in the west bank and the gaza strip and east jerusalem
israel captured those territories in the middle east war and annexed east jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally
it regards all of the city as its eternal and indivisible capital
palestinian foreign minister riyad said trump s broad commitment to a solution was not enough
he has to spell it clearly the two states based on borders that east jerusalem is an occupied territory
these issues are very important for us in order us to really move forward maliki said in new york after meeting representatives of dozens of countries on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders
officials did not attend that meeting
asked if he would engage with the united states when it released its peace plan maliki said not at as long as he is sticking to his decisions about jerusalem about settlements and about moving the embassy there is no way he said
trump asked what israel might have to give up in return for the embassy s move to jerusalem replied i took probably the biggest chip off the table
and so obviously we have to make a fair deal we have to do something
deals have to be good for both parties israel got the first chip and it s a big reporting by steve holland and yara bayoumy additional reporting by michelle nichols and arshad mohammed at the united nations ali sawafta in ramallah and ori lewis in jerusalem writing by yara bayoumy editing by james dalgleish grant mccool and paul tait
