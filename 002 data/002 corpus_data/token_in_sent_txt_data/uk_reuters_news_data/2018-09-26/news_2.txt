u.s. trade officials 'pleased' with solar factory announcements
reuters the commerce department is pleased with the new domestic solar panel manufacturing investments announced since president donald trump imposed hefty import tariffs earlier this year but continued investment could depend on the outcome of ongoing trade talks a trade official said on wednesday
solar companies including sunpower corp china s jinkosolar holding co ltd and korea s hanwha q cells co ltd have all announced investments in manufacturing since trump imposed the percent tariff on imports in january
trump s move was intended to beef up domestic production but has also slowed the pace of domestic solar installations by pushing up costs
we re very pleased to see all these announcements cora dickson the commerce department s senior renewable energy specialist said at the solar power international trade show in anaheim california
dickson said many factors would impact any further announcements however including ongoing negotiations with canada and mexico over the north american free trade agreement or nafta
those negotiations could affect the flow of components and finished products across borders and alter the economics of manufacturing of solar panels
obviously free trade is wonderful and the flow of trade and the whole supply chain and global supply chain right now is being sort of disrupted and shifting around dickson said
you have to think about alternatives
but the end goal is to get china to play dickson noted that all of the new domestic solar capacity was for panel assembly and not the solar cells that are put together to make panels
we were hoping to see a resurgence in the cells
it hasn t happened yet she said
solar cell manufacturing takes more time to set up than panel assembly and a large share of cell imports gigawatts a year are exempt from the tariffs
trump s levy on solar panel imports in january was aimed at reversing years of decline in solar manufacturing under competition from cheaper asian output
but most of the solar industry lobbied against a tariff saying it would drive up the cost of solar panels and hurt the industry s robust job growth
many solar companies have requested exemptions from the tariffs and the commerce department last week granted seven of those requests dickson said
more decisions on exemptions will be made in due course she added without being specific
