column-third time lucky for ecb on rates as oil eyes $100: mcgeever
london reuters the european central bank s interest rate hikes of and were perhaps the biggest policy errors in recent central banking history
with oil coming into view again the last thing the ecb wants is a repeat
twice bitten thrice shy
the price of brent crude oil this week hit a barrel the highest in almost four years
it s up percent over the past year an inflationary red flag the ecb would normally find difficult to ignore
also this week ecb president mario draghi told the european parliament that an acceleration in underlying inflation in the euro zone was relatively vigorous and expressed confidence that a in wage growth would continue
add all that together you might think the ecb would quite readily backtrack on its pledge to keep interest rates at historically levels through the summer of next year and deliver an rate hike or two earlier
not this time
if anything an oil price shock of crude breaking above a barrel could tempt the current incumbents in frankfurt s eurotower to ease policy or at the very least go looser for longer rather than tighten
firstly the current spike in oil is more a function of supply constraints than surging demand
sanctions on opec members venezuela and iran have hit production there while spare capacity from opec and its allies remains historically low according to nomura
the world economy led by the united states is growing at a robust and steady clip
but the balance of risks to growth from trade wars to rising interest rates is tilted to the downside
slowing economic growth will cap oil demand
secondly oil prices notoriously overshoot accelerating in the to cyclical peaks and troughs
this means they rise far higher and fall much further than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier
thirdly signs of oil remaining high say above for an extended period could squeeze corporate profits and potentially force companies to lay off workers
rising unemployment in what is already a fractious and dangerous political environment would surely be viewed with alarm in frankfurt
in short there s a case to be made that this would be bad inflation not good inflation
certainly not the time for a of or
graphic oil and ecb rate hikes the ecb raised rates in july as oil hit a record high having doubled over the previous year
this was right in the midst of the global credit crunch bear stearns had been rescued only a few months before and lehman brothers would collapse a few weeks later
in oil was again above and the ecb raised rates not once but twice just as the euro zone debt crisis was bubbling up greece and ireland had already received bailout packages and bond yields in spain and italy were ballooning to levels that would eventually prompt draghi s whatever it takes intervention a year later
policymakers will be more cautious this time around not least because inflation although at target is lower than it was then
headline inflation is running at percent whereas it nudged percent in and percent in
the ecb expects its trillion euro trillion bond purchase scheme to end at the close of this year and keep rates low through the summer of next
the guidance on rates is vague enough to give the ecb a lot of leeway
it could raise rates in september next year or december or not at all and still justifiably have kept its pledge
