update 2-u.s. will not tap oil reserve as iran sanctions loom-perry
adds details on oil price moves background by timothy gardner washington sept reuters the trump administration is not considering a release from the emergency oil stockpile to offset the impact of looming iran sanctions and will instead rely on big global producers to keep the market stable energy secretary rick perry said on wednesday
if you look at the strategic petroleum reserve and you were to introduce it into the market it has a fairly minor and impact
the numbers i ve seen do anyway perry told reporters at the department of energy explaining the administration s thinking
oil analysts have speculated for months that the trump administration could tap the strategic petroleum reserve spr in an effort to tame rising prices ahead of the midterm elections
high oil prices are a political risk for president donald trump and his fellow republicans
the spr currently holds about million barrels of mostly sour grade crude in underground caverns in texas and louisiana
under law the government can sell up to million barrels of oil or about the amount of petroleum the united states uses in hours from the reserve over a number of weeks
perry said that while price spikes are possible in the i m comfortable that the world supply can absorb the sanctions that are up to barrels per day bpd of oil could reach markets if iraq allows it to flow from the kurdistan region in the north perry said
he also said up to an additional bpd could soon come to market from an oilfield in the neutral zone that saudi arabia and kuwait share if they come to agreement
oil traded in london fell cents to settle at a barrel on wednesday
on tuesday brent crude rose as high as the highest since november on worries about the of sanctions on on iran a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec
oil producers from opec and russia met over the weekend but ruled out any immediate increase in output
the move effectively rebuffed trump s calls on oil producers to take action
saudi arabian energy minister khalid said on sunday he does not influence oil prices after trump called on opec to bring down the cost of fuel
the white house has said it wants iran s oil consumers to cut their purchases to zero
but there are expectations that the administration could offer exemptions to countries that have reduced their intake
perry said he thought the sanctions could be carried out on a graduated basis apparently meaning limits on purchases could increase over time but he did not offer further details
