update 6-iran warns u.s. and israel of revenge after parade attack, mattis dismisses threat
reuters defense secretary jim mattis on monday dismissed iran s threats of revenge after saturday s deadly attack at a military parade in southwestern iran and said it was ludicrous for tehran to allege involvement
iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on monday the attackers who killed people at a military parade had been paid by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and that iran would severely punish those behind the bloodshed
the deputy head of iran s revolutionary guards also accused the united states and israel of involvement in the attack and said they should expect a devastating response
mattis told reporters at the pentagon that iran s threat did not give him any concern
we ve been very clear that they shouldn t take us on like that
and i am hopeful that cooler wiser heads will prevail mattis said
they ve so far blamed at least three countries and i think one terrorist group
we ll see how long the list goes
but it d be good if they knew what they re talking about before they started in the southwestern city of ahvaz thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of saturday s assault many chanting death to israel and america
twelve members of the elite islamic revolutionary guard corps were among the dead
the coffins wrapped in flags were carried by mourners
many held pictures of a boy killed in the incident one of the worst such attacks against iran s most powerful military force
iran s intelligence ministry said some people had been arrested in connection with the attack
weapons explosives material and communication equipment were seized in the house that belonged to the terrorist group that carried out the attack a ministry statement said according to the tasnim news agency
gunmen fired on a viewing stand in ahvaz where officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of iran s war with iraq
fars and irna news agencies said on monday five attackers were killed not four as previously reported by state media
the body of the fifth assailant had not been identified as it was mixed up with other casualties fars said
based on reports this cowardly act was done by people who the americans come to help when they are trapped in syria and iraq and are paid by saudi arabia and the uae khamenei said on his website
guards brigadier general hossein salami in a speech broadcast on state tv said you have seen our revenge before
you will see that our response will be crushing and devastating and you will regret what you have tasnim news agency quoted salami as saying the horrific crime exposed the dark side of an alliance that the united states saudi arabia and israel had created to counter iranian influence in the region
the secretary of iran s national security council said tehran needed to talk to its neighbours to avoid tensions
it s essential to be fully aware and increase our constructive dialogues to neutralise the plots of enemies who want to create suspicion and disagreement among regional countries ali shamkhani said
he also said sanctions against iran were illegal and president donald trump was using them as a tool for personal revenge
mattis said it was clear that iran still didn t know what had happened
he stressed the united states had no advance knowledge that such an attack was possible
i don t get woken up with phone calls over something we know is going to happen
it s just ludicrous to say we had anything to do with it he said
secretary of state mike pompeo asked by a fox news interviewer if the united states played any role in the attack said when you have a security incident at home blaming others is an enormous the loss of innocent lives was tragic pompeo added
there has been no reaction from saudi arabia or israel
accusations against gulf countries will almost certainly antagonise iran s regional foe saudi arabia
the oil are waging a war for influence across the middle east backing opposite sides in syria yemen iraq and lebanon
it is however highly unlikely the guards will strike any of its foes directly and risk setting off a regional conflict
analysts said the violence has led to a boost in domestic support for the guards which they could use to silence their critics who include pragmatic president hassan rouhani
rouhani engineered iran s nuclear deal with world powers that ushered in a cautious detente with washington before tensions flared anew with trump s decision in may to pull out of the accord and reimpose sanctions on tehran
iran s intelligence minister mahmoud alavi said a network of suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack the judiciary s news agency mizan reported
he did not elaborate
karim dahimi a human rights activist in london told reuters local sources had said more than people had been arrested in the cities of ahvaz khorramshahr and abadan in recent days mostly from the sunni muslim community
ahvaz national resistance an iranian ethnic arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in khuzestan province and islamic state have both claimed responsibility
the guard corps was set up after the islamic revolution to protect the shi ite clerical ruling system and revolutionary values
it answers to ayatollah khamenei and has an estimated military with army navy and air units
