new venezuela fuel payment system gets off to slow start
caracas reuters venezuela s new digital fuel payment system got off to a slow start on monday as most drivers paid with cash and only a handful of gas stations were equipped with the system that president nicolas maduro says will limit fuel smuggling
the new system entails venezuelans applying for and using a digital identification document to pay for fuel with the government providing gas stations with wireless devices that will read the card
leftist maduro has said the system will limit the trading of gas which is so heavily subsidized that drivers often do not even bother paying for it
last week he said the new payment system would roll out on monday
that followed a pilot earlier this month in border states where fuel smugglers are the most active though drivers at the time said the system was not functioning
gas station employees and drivers that reuters spoke to on monday said the system was not fully operational
right now payments aren t being made with the system it s only to show how it works said an employee of a gas station in caracas who asked not to be identified
this is a test phase it s a the information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment
maduro has said gasoline prices will rise to international levels by october but has provided no details on what the prices would be
the issue has been politically delicate since a austerity package that included a fuel price hike triggered rioting that left thousands dead
maduro s previous plans to raise gasoline prices have either been abandoned or resulted in insignificant increases that were quickly overtaken by inflation
many venezuelans reuters spoke to said they were confused about what the new prices will be and called the card a mechanism to withhold benefits and services from those who oppose maduro
to me this system is garbage said mercedes fernandez a systems engineer
we don t even know how much it s going to cost or how we re going to fernandez shortly thereafter filled her tank and paid for the fuel with a bank note worth bolivars currently the smallest denomination of legal tender
the combination of fixed fuel prices and annual inflation now topping percent has made gasoline so cheap as to be effectively free
for the amount it costs to buy one kilo pounds of cheese a driver could fill their tank times
