thousands mourn victims of iran military parade attack
london sept reuters thousands of people packed the streets of the southwestern iranian city of ahvaz on monday to mourn the victims of an attack on a military parade that killed people including members of the elite revolutionary guards
saturday s assault one of the worst against the most powerful military force of the islamic republic struck a blow at its security establishment at a time when the united states and its gulf allies are working to isolate tehran
iran has declared monday a national day of mourning
public offices banks schools and universities will be closed in khuzestan province
four assailants fired on a viewing stand in ahvaz where iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the islamic republic s war with iraq
islamic state s amaq agency posted a video of three men in a vehicle who it said were on their way to carry out the attack
a man wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with what appears to be a revolutionary guard logo discussed the impending attack in farsi in the video
we are muslims they are kafirs the man says
he adds we will destroy them with a strong and attack inshallah god willing ahvaz national resistance an iranian ethnic arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in khuzestan province also claimed responsibility for the attack
senior commanders of the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc have said the ahvaz attack was carried out by militants trained by gulf states and israel and backed by america
but it is unlikely the irgc will strike any of these foes directly
the guards could put on a show of strength by firing missiles at opposition groups operating in iraq or syria that may be linked to the militants who staged the attack
they are also likely to enforce a tight security policy in khuzestan province arresting any perceived domestic opponents including civil rights activists
