rpt-insight-in nigeria, shell’s onshore roots still run deep
repeating sept story with no changes to text shell says reducing presence in onshore nigerian fields but onshore production remains above of total most of the increase is due to new gas production spill volumes remain persistently high graphic shell spills graphic shell production in nigeria graphic shell onshore production by ron bousso bodo nigeria sept reuters royal dutch shell wants to reweight its footprint in nigeria to focus on oil and gas fields far offshore away from the theft spills corruption and unrest that have plagued the west african country s onshore industry for decades
but for the company that pioneered nigeria s oil industry in the the niger delta remains as important and problematic as ever
while shell has cut onshore oil production and sold some onshore assets it continues to invest in others
in fact onshore production has risen in recent years as a share of shell s output in nigeria an analysis of company data over the past decade shows
much of the increase comes from less polluting gas used mainly in power generation which shell thinks will be key to the transition to lower carbon energy
gas made up percent of onshore production in up from percent in
the company still controls thousands of kilometres of pipelines connecting inland fields to coastal terminals through its subsidiary shell petroleum development co of nigeria spdc however
so while spdc has cut oil production in the delta by percent since when it first started reporting data on spills the incidence of spills and theft from pipelines has fallen at a much lower rate and has picked up again recently the data shows
shell s nigeria country chair osagie okunbor hinted it was a sensitive balancing act
we are too big just to see ourselves as there is a problem and we have to run
that is not what we are thinking of doing he told reporters on a media trip to the country in july
but at the same time we don t want to spread our two pipeline spills in in the small community of bodo in ogoniland are emblematic of the problems in the delta a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps by pipelines and blighted by poverty and violence
on a speedboat trip to the site of a operation launched by shell last year a makeshift oil refinery stood idle on a charred landing
the ground was soaked with oil the air heavy with petrol fumes and slicks glistened in the water nearby
there were few signs of birds or fish
so far this year crude spills have been recorded already higher than the previous two years
in militant attacks pushed the volume of spills to more than barrels a high since
oil theft from spdc rose to around barrels per day bpd in a loss of nearly million for the year from bpd the year before
despite all the problems and costs however nigerian onshore operations generate billions of dollars annually
shell does not break down profits by country but a report on payments to governments that the company publishes annually showed it paid around billion in royalties taxes and fees to the nigerian government in
that means shell earned more than billion from oil and gas production in nigeria in around percent of its total global output
a shell spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of reuters data analysis
the nigerian petroleum ministry declined to comment
shell has shown it can shut down if it is not making money
it stopped producing oil completely in iraq last year after half a century in the country although it retains substantial gas operations
it s hard to think shell would stay put onshore and weather all the problems if the assets didn t offer decent returns said aaron sayne a financial crime lawyer working at the natural resource governance institute nrgi
to some extent the onshore must still be worth the shell remains central to nigeria s economy and society
spdc operated by shell with a percent stake while the nigerian national petroleum co has percent france s total has percent and italy s eni has percent is the country s largest oil joint venture employing thousands
the giant s operations drew unwelcome attention in the early when residents of the delta s ogoni region called for fairer distribution of oil wealth and compensation for spills
the government cracked down and in executed nine protest leaders including prominent writer ken prompting shell to end production in the area forever
it retained control of the pipeline however and nearly a quarter of a century later little seems to have changed on the ground
in shell accepted responsibility for operational faults that caused the spills that dumped tens of thousands of oil barrels into creeks around bodo and paid a settlement of million pounds to villagers
dozens of spills since including one by a barge carrying stolen oil that sunk in july are frustrating remediation efforts officials said
you clean it up you walk away somebody goes back there and does the same thing
it s like going around in circles said ogonnaya iroakasi ogoni restoration project supervisor and an spdc member
around percent of the spills are a result of sabotage shell data shows
shell has taken a number of steps to improve the situation in the area including training youth to start up businesses and funding local community patrols campaigns to raise local awareness and even a local radio station
but critics say it is not enough
i am not minimizing the challenge of but shell are not doing enough to solve it said daniel leader the bodo community s lead uk lawyer
the pipelines are not equipped with the most basic leak detection technology and shell is simply not present on the ground in these local residents are frustrated as the slow process stops many from fishing one of the main sources of income
much of the anger is focused on shell but eni has also struggled to cope in recent years
since starting to report data to authorities in the italian company has recorded more spills than shell according to amnesty international
please don t give up on us
i hope that you guys here can force shell to do the right thing michael porobunu chairman of gokana council of chiefs told the crew and reporters on his porch
spdc has sold of the field licences in the delta it held in mostly to local companies
it has applied to renew the remaining licences which expire next year
the divestments are a reminder of another cost of doing business in nigeria corruption
shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the million sale of oil mining licence to local firm neconde in
offshore operations are an attractive alternative to the delta in many ways
the bonga field km miles off the coast is one of shell s prized assets since starting up in
the giant tanker with a drilling platform that pumps barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas per day from a field one km below won the company s asset of the year award in for its safety and reliability
many risks remain
in the pipeline was shut down for months after militants detonated a bomb at its section
shell and eni face bribery allegations in a milan court over the purchase of an offshore licence
drilling offshore is also more expensive and technically complex
shell and its partners will decide next year on whether to develop a new offshore field bonga southwest
such an investment will reopen the window for the next wave of investment in deep water nigeria bayo ojulari managing director of shell nigeria exploration and production company said in lagos
