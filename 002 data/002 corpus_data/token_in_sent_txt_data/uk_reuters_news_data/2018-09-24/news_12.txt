preview-big oil readies brazil offshore bets, fearing election result
rio de janeiro sept reuters exxon mobil corp royal dutch shell plc and other companies will gather on friday in possibly their last crack at brazil s coveted offshore oil for another four years as a election spurs fears about barriers to foreign investment
the auction in rio de janeiro for four blocks in the santos and campos basins comes just a week before the most unpredictable presidential election in a generation which features candidates that may seek to slow the pace of oil auctions revise legislation or even claw back oil areas already handed out
they can try to revise the whole process of opening up the oil industry to international oil companies said an oil services industry executive who declined to be named
lured by world class geology shrinking reserves elsewhere and rising oil prices companies have dropped big money on brazil latin america s top oil producer to lock in stakes to its layer where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore
china s cnooc chevron corp bp norway s equinor and france s total are also all registered to participate in the auction
their interest has been fanned by policies under president michel temer including a loosening of rules that had favored local suppliers an extension of tax sweeteners and the removal of a requirement that state oil giant petrobras be sole operator in blocks
fears of a rollback of such policies should encourage big bets on friday according to edmar almeida an energy professor at the federal university of rio de janeiro
it will be a hotly contested auction he said
presidential frontrunner jair bolsonaro has said little about the oil sector although as a congressman he once voted against easing petrobras oil monopoly
he has floated the idea of privatizing petrobras and has indicated that he will champion a approach if he wins
however opinion polls indicate that a likely vote on would be a close contest
fernando haddad a leftist academic who has climbed into the no
spot after an endorsement from jailed former president luiz inacio lula da silva has a much more nationalistic view of the industry
vowing to recover the to serve the future of the brazilian people not the interests of international companies according to his platform he would restore stricter requirements for using local suppliers
it is unclear if haddad would also adopt lula s pledge to revert to giving petrobras the sole right to operate fields and slow the pace of auctions
ciro gomes a leftist former state governor in third place has threatened to freeze auctions and expropriate blocks already handed out
if haddad or gomes win we can say goodbye to auctions said another oil industry executive who asked not be named
they want to renationalize everything
it will be hell he said
the fiercest bids this week are expected to be for the tita and saturno blocks in the santos basin which were withdrawn by a court from a prior auction in march disappointing exxon
both pau brasil in the santos basin and the southwest of tartaruga verde in the campos basin received no bids in an auction last year
but this time petrobras exercised its right of first refusal to bid for the tartaruga verde block adjacent to an area it already owns
under brazilian rules petrobras can express advance interest in operating a block where it would control at least a percent stake though it can still bid on other blocks on the day of the auction
companies will compete by pledging the greatest share of oil subtracting overhead costs to the government with minimums ranging from percent to percent
