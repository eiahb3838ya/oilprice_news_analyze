the views expressed are his own by john kemp london sept reuters eleven years ago on monday the price of brent crude closed just below per barrel not far from where it is today
three days later brent closed above for the first time in history
less than months after that prices closed at an high of
past prices are not necessarily a guide to the future but the events of are a reminder that price moves are highly especially around turning points in the cycle
price moves tend to accelerate in the to cyclical peaks and troughs as the market struggles to overcome a worsening deficit or surplus
as a result oil prices tend to rise far higher and fall much further than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier
the current situation in the global economy and the oil market has many similarities to what happened in and
in the earlier episode the global economy had been expanding strongly for several years with rapid growth in oil consumption
the economic cycle peaked in december though that was not evident until about a year afterwards and oil prices continued rising for another seven months
yields on treasury notes peaked around june and equity markets hit their pinnacle in october
most of the other major industrial economies tipped into recession in the second half of or the first half of
in the oil market persistent concerns about demand destruction were raised but dismissed by many participants and validated only after prices peaked
the introduction of new standards for distillate fuel oil in the united states led to concerns about the availability of enough sweet crude
there were mounting concerns about the exhaustion of opec s spare capacity and the organisation s ability to add more barrels to meet demand from refiners
throughout and early opec leaders continued to insist the oil market was adequately supplied and they would make additional barrels available if refiners requested them
but the brent market moved into a sharp backwardation in the second half of and the first four months of indicating traders were concerned about oil availability
in september opec agreed to increase its collective production by barrels per day from the start of november citing the tightness in fuel markets and the shift in crude futures into backwardation
in december however opec s conference judged the market remained well supplied and that crude and product stocks were at comfortable levels and decided not to increase output further
in march the conference continued to judge the market well supplied noting growing downside risks in the world economy and blamed the continued rise in oil prices on factors especially speculators
in may the organisation s issued a statement saying there is clearly no shortage of oil in the market and blaming speculative funds for the increasing volatility in crude oil
the organisation promised to be proactive in monitoring developments and act if necessary to ensure a stable and balanced market but did not promise additional barrels
prices continued to accelerate higher and became increasingly volatile with price moves becoming frequent and many traders pulling back from making markets due to the increase in risk
opec insisted throughout that oil supplies were adequate saudi arabia and other members would provide more oil if refiners asked but that prices were being driven by factors
eventually the backwardation began to break down in may and spot prices started to fall from early july as the financial and economic outlook deteriorated
with the intensification of the financial crisis in september the global economy headed deeper into recession through the second half of the year and in the first half of
could the same sequence of events play out in
the economy and financial markets are again at a relatively late stage in the current cyclical expansion
in the rest of the world the global outlook is softening with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside according to many forecasters
oil consumption growth has been strong but may be starting to soften though as usual this will not be certain until after the event
brent calendar spreads are trading in a backwardation of around per barrel which is comparable to the corresponding point in september
new pollution regulations will tighten sulphur specifications for marine fuels from the start of which will put pressure on the availability of and sweet crudes
there are reported shortages of medium crudes as imminent sanctions reduce the export of oil from iran saudi arabia worries oil crunch could push up prices wall street journal
saudi arabia says it has enough spare capacity to increase production by another million barrels per day but some market participants are sceptical about the amount and the quality
the joint ministerial monitoring committee of opec and producers concluded on sunday the overall balance between supply and demand remains healthy
but hedge funds have amassed a large bullish position in brent crude amounting to almost million barrels betting prices will head even higher
