update 2-world oil demand, refining growth to peak in 2035 - unipec
singapore reuters world oil demand will peak at million barrels per day bpd in the up from just below million bpd currently as new technologies gradually eat into oil use china s unipec said on monday
improved energy efficiency and technological changes including the rise of renewables meant global oil demand growth would slow in coming years before peaking in unipec president chen bo told the annual asia pacific petroleum conference appec
this in turn will slow growth in global oil refining capacity which is set to hit billion tonnes per year in he said
we believe will be the last cycle of global refining capacity expansion
after it is difficult to see refining projects in construction except for some small upgrade projects and petrochemical projects said chen
unipec is the trading arm of asia s largest refiner sinopec
the switch to cleaner fuels will also boost global demand for liquefied natural gas lng particularly in the asia pacific after he added
an escalating trade war between china the largest energy importer and the united states has dampened the asian nation s demand for crude oil and lng
the united states exported barrels per day bpd of crude oil to china in the first half of and cargoes of lng through july or roughly percent of its total lng exports according to official data
despite the trade dispute chen said crude supply was an important new source for chinese refiners as it allowed diversification from middle east and african crudes
trade war tensions between the two countries would last for the time being and in the future we ll be active in this area he added
beijing has excluded crude imports from its tariffs list so far but most chinese buyers are staying away from oil as the trade war shows no signs of cooling
unipec resumed loading crude in september after a hiatus
china is also under pressure from the united states to reduce its iranian oil imports as washington aims to cut exports from opec s exporter to zero to force tehran to negotiate a nuclear treaty
buyers in europe japan south korea and india have either stopped or are reducing iranian oil imports sharply ahead of the introduction of sanctions in november
i expect we ll cut a little but the volume has not been finalised chen said without giving a timeframe for the cuts
he added that unipec has resumed normal loadings of saudi oil after it cut imports in
given the current supply and demand dynamic in global markets chen said crude oil prices between at and per barrel were normal
