update 1-merkel says eu should meet existing emissions aims, not set new ones
berlin reuters a proliferation of extreme weather events around the world provides ample evidence that climate change is a reality german chancellor angela merkel said on sunday but she rejected calls for more ambitious climate protection goals
extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns that climate change is gathering pace leading dozens of countries to call for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned
but merkel said such calls most recently from the european commission s climate chief miguel arias canete for swifter cuts to harmful carbon dioxide emissions would be counterproductive adding that setting new goals made little sense when european countries were already struggling to meet their cuts targets
i m not particularly happy about these new proposals she said of canete s call to increase from to percent the scale of cuts to target by
i think we should first stick to the goals we have already set ourselves
i don t think permanently setting ourselves new goals makes any merkel s government has already faced criticism for abandoning emissions targets it had set itself for after concluding they were unachievable while sticking to a target it had set itself for a decade later
this summer s sweltering temperatures across europe have reignited the climate debate with record temperatures across the continent causing sea ice to melt in the arctic and triggering forest fires across the continent
one summer doesn t on its own express it but the piling up of extreme weather conditions and the rising temperatures shows climate change isn t just in africa and the arctic and antarctic but here too merkel said
