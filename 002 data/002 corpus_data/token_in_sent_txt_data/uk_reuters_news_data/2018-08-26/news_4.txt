president donald trump pulled the united states out of a nuclear deal between iran and world powers in may and is reimposing sanctions on tehran
other parties to the accord are trying to find ways to save the agreement
trump s decision to withdraw from the accord has hurt the united states zarif said according to the iranian students news agency isna
from the time that trump announced the withdrawal from the nuclear deal america has not been able to reach its goals zarif said
washington aims to force tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in syria and iraq
zarif also said the nuclear deal has led to political conflict within iran
there are some in the country who instead of laying the groundwork for using the opportunities presented by the nuclear deal chose a political fight zarif said according to isna
