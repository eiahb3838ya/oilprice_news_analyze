"facebook effect" turns swedish steel town into tech hot-spot
oslo reuters facebook will double the size of its data center in sweden s northern city of lulea raising its total investments in the region to about billion crowns million the company said on monday
the campus opened in is the first facebook data center set up outside the united states
the expansion will make it one of the largest data centers in the world said node pole an investment hub partly owned by utility vattenfall which seeks to promote investments in data centers
sweden and its nordic neighbors with cheap electricity and low temperatures are attractive for data centers with many silicon valley giants and cryptocurrency miners rushing to move in
facebook will add a third building to the existing two at the lulea data center which vattenfall supplies electricity to
this third building will measure nearly square meters and we anticipate will start serving traffic in early facebook said in a statement
the expansion will increase the social media giant s total cumulative investment in the region to around billion crowns it added without disclosing the exact cost of the new project
lulea s mayor niklas nordstrom said the new building would double the size of the data center to more than square meters million square feet and double its capacity of operations
the current campus consumes more than one percent of sweden s total power production and that will also double he told reuters
the expansion will create about new facebook jobs at the center which currently employs fewer than people while its construction will create about temporary jobs nordstrom said
in sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centers by percent to the same level as other heavy industries such as steelworks and car plants making it attractive for new investments said node pole
sweden now has the lowest energy cost in the eu with the lowest carbon footprint it said explaining facebook s move
the city of lulea in northern sweden on the same latitude as alaska s fairbanks was built on the foundation of the steel industry
in the past decade it has also developed into a for data centers and other industries
more than data centers today operate in the area with german car maker bmw one of the companies storing data in the region
amazon also recently announced that three data centers will be built in sweden
boston consulting group estimated data centers could employ people in sweden by twice as many as are employed in the country s steel industry today according to a press release by lulea s mayor and lulea naringsliv a local development company
we call it the facebook effect
the new business and new jobs generated by the initial investment makes this about much more than a data center said li skarin chief executive of lulea naringsliv
