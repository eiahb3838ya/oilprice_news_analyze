update 6-u.s. imposes fresh sanctions on venezuela, pence calls for more action
reuters the united states on monday announced sanctions on three venezuelans and companies with ties to socialist president nicolas maduro for narcotics trafficking with vice president mike pence calling for more nations to increase pressure on caracas
the new sanctions continue a pattern of measures on individuals connected to maduro who is blamed by president donald trump s administration for a deep recession and hyperinflation that have caused food shortages in venezuela and sent a exodus of migrants into neighbouring countries
the individuals sanctioned on monday are fairly and the move is unlikely to create major economic hardship
trump has been considering but has so far opted not to impose sanctions on a venezuelan oil services company and on insurance coverage for tankers carrying venezuelan oil
those measures are still under consideration though one administration official said on monday speaking on condition of anonymity
pence told the organization of american states which includes venezuela as a member that they needed to take greater steps to isolate maduro
we believe it is time to do more much more pence said in an address to the oas in washington
every free nation gathered here must take stronger action to stand with the venezuelan people and stand up to their pence said the oas should suspend venezuela s membership and urged other members to cut off the nation s leaders from financial systems and restrict their travel visas
he also called on maduro to suspend elections scheduled for may saying he expected voter intimidation and manipulation of data
there will be no real election in venezuela on may and the world knows it pence said
the suggestion was immediately rejected by caracas
there is zero possibility that elections will be suspended said samuel moncada venezuela s ambassador to the united nations condemning pence s speech
maduro himself subject to sanctions last year regularly laughs off washington s disapproval and blames the empire for his country s economic woes saying it is trying to undermine his administration
of the newly sanctioned companies are based in venezuela and four in panama
they are owned or controlled by the three individuals the treasury said in a statement
the measures are aimed at having a chilling effect on other drug traffickers in venezuela and are one in a series of many steps said carlos trujillo ambassador to the oas
i think the trump administration is willing to do anything whatever it takes to make sure that venezuelan people get to enjoy democracy and the liberties that come with it trujillo said in an interview
trujillo said he thinks venezuela could leave the oas by the end of something he said was needed for the group to be taken venezuela has said in the past that they want to leave but it seems they don t find their way to the door he said
