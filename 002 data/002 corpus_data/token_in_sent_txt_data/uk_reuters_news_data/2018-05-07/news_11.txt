othman said the deal would provide about million tonnes of oil a year to sudan which in recent months has been hit by a sharp foreign currency crisis and an acute fuel shortage that has forced people to queue at gas stations for hours
once an oil exporter sudan was forced to begin importing it after the south seceded in taking with it of the country s oil output and its main source of foreign currency
a source in the presidency s office in khartoum said the final agreement is expected to be signed within days
sudan s foreign currency crunch arose from decades of sanctions that were lifted last year but new sources of foreign currency have failed to materialise
