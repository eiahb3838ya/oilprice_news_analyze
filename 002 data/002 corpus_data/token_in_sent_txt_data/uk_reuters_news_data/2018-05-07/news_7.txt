in many cases local governments are using this new money to address what was a growing backlog of deferred capital in adair county iowa construction of new wind farms has grown the tax base nearly percent over the last decade giving it money to fix bridges and streets

in jackson county minnesota a wind production tax generates nearly percent of the county s annual operating revenues and helped fund construction of a new public works facility
nearly half of the country s installed wind power capacity is located in texas iowa oklahoma and california the report showed
yet wind power is growing elsewhere
at least counties in states had wind farms as of january more than double the number that had them years ago moody s found
the developments have expanded rapidly in kansas and minnesota for instance

the tax boost is especially strong in counties that are allowed to apply their locally determined property tax rate to the valuation of wind turbines as they do in iowa
there the state lets wind farms be phased into a county s tax base starting at percent of a turbine s assessed valuation annually until it hits a maximum of percent
iowa s booming wind energy sector also prompted tech companies including apple alphabet microsoft and facebook to invest a total of nearly billion on data centers moody s said
counties can also tax annual kilowatt hours of wind energy produced as is the case in minnesota
moody s expects demand for wind energy to remain strong despite the of a federal production tax credit talk of tariffs on imported steel and waning political support for state incentives
