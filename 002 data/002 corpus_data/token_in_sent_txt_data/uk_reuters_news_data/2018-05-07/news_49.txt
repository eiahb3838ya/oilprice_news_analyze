exclusive-conoco moves to take over venezuelan pdvsa's caribbean assets -sources
reuters oil firm conocophillips has moved to take caribbean assets of venezuela s pdvsa to enforce a billion arbitration award over a nationalization of its projects in the south american country according to three sources familiar with its actions
the firm targeted facilities on the islands of curacao bonaire and eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of venezuela s oil exports last year
the three play key roles in processing storing and blending pdvsa s oil for export
the company received court attachments freezing assets at least two of the facilities and could move to sell them one of the sources said
conoco s legal maneuvers could further impair pdvsa s declining oil revenue and the country s convulsing economy
venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil exports which have fallen by a third since its peak and its refineries ran at just percent of capacity in the first quarter
the latin american country is in the grip of a deep recession with severe shortages of medicine and food as well as a growing exodus of its people
pdvsa and the venezuelan foreign ministry did not respond on sunday to requests for comment
dutch authorities said they are assessing the situation on bonaire
conoco s claims against venezuela and pdvsa in international courts have totaled billion the largest by any company
any potential impacts on communities are the result of pdvsa s illegal expropriation of our assets and its decision to ignore the judgment of the icc tribunal conoco said in an email to reuters
the firm added it will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions
pdvsa has significant assets in the caribbean
on bonaire it owns the bopec terminal which handles logistics and fuel shipments to customers particularly in asia
in aruba pdvsa and its unit citgo lease a refinery and a storage terminal
on the island of eustatius it rents storage tanks at the statia terminal owned by nustar energy where over million barrels of venezuelan crude were retained by court order according to one of the sources
nustar is aware of the order and assessing our legal and commercial options said spokesman chris cho
the company does not expect the matter to change its earnings outlook he said
conoco also sought to attach pdvsa inventories on curacao home of the isla refinery and bullenbay oil terminal
but the order could not immediately be enforced according to two of the sources
last year pdvsa s shipments from bonaire and st eustatius terminals accounted for about percent of its total exports according to internal figures from the company
the exports were mostly crude and fuel oil for asian customers including chinaoil china s zhenhua oil and india s reliance industries
from its largest caribbean operations in curacao pdvsa shipped percent of its exports last year including products exported by its isla refinery to caribbean islands and crude from its bullenbay terminal to buyers of venezuelan crude all over the world
pdvsa on friday ordered its oil tankers sailing across the caribbean to return to venezuelan waters and await further instructions according to a document viewed by reuters
in the last year several cargoes of venezuelan crude have been retained or seized in recent years over unpaid freight fees and related debts
this is terrible for pdvsa said a source familiar with the court order of attachment
the company can not comply with all the committed volume for exports and the conoco action imperils its ability to ship fuel oil to china or access inventories to be exported from bonaire
at the international chamber of commerce icc conoco had sought up to billion from pdvsa for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil producing joint ventures which were nationalized in under late venezuela president hugo chavez
the firm left the country after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by pdvsa
a separate arbitration case involving the loss of its venezuelan assets is before a world bank tribunal the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes
exxon mobil corp also has brought two separate arbitration claims over the nationalization of its projects in venezuela
