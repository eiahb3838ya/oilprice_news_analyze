update 2-indonesia sees coal output flat in 2019 amid equipment shortage
production seen at million tonnes in and mln tonne output cap in unlikely ministry miners waiting up to months for excavators contractor adds industry comments by fergus jensen nusa dua indonesia may reuters indonesia is targeting annual production of million tonnes of coal this year and next a mining ministry official said on monday as producers of the fuel are struggling to get new heavy equipment and parts
that s up around percent from the million tonnes indonesia produced in
indonesia s national development planning board bappenas has pushed for coal output to be capped at million tonnes in but according to coal and minerals director general bambang gatot ariyono that target needs to be harmonised with other considerations
otherwise there could be idle capacity or miners coal production could be he told reporters on the sidelines of the coaltrans asia conference
ariyono referred to environmental permits allowing output to reach million tonnes this year and million tonnes in and feasibility studies presenting other figures
amid concerns indonesia could exhaust existing minable coal reserves of billion tonnes years the government is considering measures to push miners to carry out exploration work before they can obtain permits to increase output
it could start next year ariyono said
indonesian coal exploration has increased as almost all miners have increased their capital spending this year pandu sjahrir chairman of the indonesian coal mining association told reporters
to improve the mine life a lot of miners are carrying out and increasing stripping ratios to increase reserves
that s a saving for the future almost all players he said
however heavy equipment shortages are limiting expansion particularly for smaller miners sjahrir said
in general getting equipment parts is difficult and up to the middle of it will be difficult to increase production but for smaller players it will be more difficult because of shortages of suppliers remain wary of providing equipment to contractors as purchases of costly heavy equipment are often repaid over a period of up to five years sjahrir said
according to andy coles president director of mining services contractor bis industries waiting times for excavators are currently around months
everyone is looking for equipment he said
shortages of equipment like trucks rollers and graders made by caterpillar inc komatsu and volvo mean it is harder for miners to ramp up output and take advantage of recent improvements in coal prices he said
the shortages also threatened to disrupt mining operations coles added
when you get rain combined with no maintenance you get a significant deterioration of roads and that impacts your hauling equipment destroys the springs
engines everything falls according to indika energy group managing director azis armand wet weather hit operations of many indonesian miners in and the first quarter of but conditions are now improving
