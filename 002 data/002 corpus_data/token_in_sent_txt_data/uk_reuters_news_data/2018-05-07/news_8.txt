update 3-iran says new sanctions would not stifle its oil industry
ankara reuters the iranian oil industry will continue to develop even if the united states pulls out of the nuclear deal and tehran would see the accord as operational as long as it can sell oil the oil ministry s news service quoted senior officials as saying on monday
president donald trump has threatened to pull out of the iran deal by not extending sanctions waivers when they expire on may unless european signatories of the accord fix what he calls its flaws
they can not stop iran
our oil industry s development will continue even if new sanctions are imposed on iran shana quoted gholamreza manouchehri deputy head of the national iranian oil company as saying on its website
sanctions imposed on iran in early by the united states and european union over its nuclear programme cut iran s crude exports from a peak of million barrels per day bpd before the sanctions to a little more than million bpd
but iran as a major oil exporter in january when international sanctions were suspended in return for curbs on iran s nuclear programme
manouchehri said iran planned to finalise seven upstream contracts worth around billion with foreign investors shana reported
these contracts will be finalised under the current challenging circumstances by year october
this planning has been made with the assumption of delayed presence of western companies he added
major european companies partly fearing harsh penalties because of the remaining sanctions on iran have been reluctant to do business with tehran which needs to attract over billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output
france s total became the first western energy firm to sign a deal with iran after the easing of international sanctions in agreeing to develop phase of the south pars offshore gas field with a total investment of billion
deputy oil minister amirhossein zamaninia also said that iran considered the deal alive if we can continue to sell our oil and its products even if the united states pulls out
also we should be able to maintain iran s oil market receive our oil money and secure foreign investment in our oil industry he added
iran says it aims to raise its crude oil production capacity to million bpd within the next four years though exports might be disrupted if trump refuses to renew iran s sanctions waivers next week
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec russia and several other producers began to reduce oil output in january in an attempt to erase a supply glut and prop up prices
they have extended the pact until december and meet in june to review policy
we back opec s decisions under normal circumstances
but iran always gives priority to its own interests whoever produces more oil has more power in the market zamaninia said
iran s regional rival saudi arabia meanwhile has shown a willingness to keep tightening crude markets
the world s largest crude exporter has consistently opposed iran s nuclear deal fearing that it will strengthen iran economically and allow it to increase funding for proxy conflicts in lebanon syria iraq and yemen
saudi officials want to limit iran s oil market
this is a fight over controlling the crude market zamaninia said
saleh hendi head of the nioc s exploration organisation said exploration blocks were also scheduled to be tendered in july
of the exploration blocks six blocks for which development agreements will be signed are expected to be attractive to foreign investors hendi said
