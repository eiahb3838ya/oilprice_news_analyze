refile-somalis turn a profit by transforming their scrap plastic
mogadishu reuters as the rubbish built up on the rubble of mogadishu s wrecked streets ahmed abdullah saw a business opportunity
he recruited a team of workers many of them refugees from somalia s long conflict and sent them out to collect plastic bags bottles and wrappers to turn into roof tiles and other recycled goods
they can not break you see abdullah said has he threw some of his tiles onto the floor to show their strength
they are made of the recycled plastics and years of fierce fighting in the coastal city have destroyed its infrastructure and left the surviving buildings pocked with bullet holes
the government is struggling to control a vast divided country where islamist militants from the al al shabaab group still launch regular attacks on the capital
regular rubbish collection is way down the state s list of priorities
a lot of rubbish like plastics paper bags are thrown outside the city said abdullah
when the piles get too big he added people start dumping it in the ocean
so in june he and others founded their company green plastic
muslimo aden ali said he gets paid somali shillings pounds for every kg of waste he brings in
we carry the rubbish on our heads and backs
it is a nice job
we survive on this he said
maryan abdullahi a mother displaced by fighting said she walks more than km miles a day searching for plastic
