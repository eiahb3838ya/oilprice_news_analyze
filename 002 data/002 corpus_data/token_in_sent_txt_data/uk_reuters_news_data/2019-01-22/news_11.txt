s. korea's moon calls for early warning system with china to fight dirty air
seoul reuters south korea s president said on tuesday he was truly ashamed of his government s inability to clear air pollution that has blanketed seoul and parts of the country for weeks and proposed an early warning system with china
south korea often accuses china of causing much of its air pollution but china says it is not entirely to blame and south korea should take more responsibility for its own air quality
the people had to suffer greatly last week due to an unprecedented number of days of dense fine dust president moon told a cabinet meeting on tuesday
i feel truly ashamed because we are unable to clearly address the south korea asia s fourth largest economy has been grappling with worsening air quality
last year the government shut down five aging power plants from march to june in a bid to reduce air pollution
moon called for further measures on tuesday including reducing the number of diesel cars on the roads and modernizing household heaters
moon said regional air pollution is a disaster that must be resolved through creative efforts and cooperation between governments
we know that there is a great deal of public concern because of the fine dust coming from china and because china is also suffering from fine dust it is necessary to strengthen cooperation to drastically reduce fine dust moon said
a senior chinese official acknowledged on monday pollution was a regional problem but that south korea should do more to solve its own problems in large cities like seoul
while air quality in key regions of china has improved by more than percent since concentrations of tiny particles in seoul were steady or rose slightly said liu bingjiang of china s atmospheric pollution department of the ministry of ecology and environment
the experiences of many countries shows that in the process of treating atmospheric pollution in a region the local emissions treatment of large cities is more important liu said at a monthly briefing
if we blame transmission effects and do not face up to our own problems we will not grasp those problems and miss the best chance to solve air pollution he added
liu said china was in close cooperation with regional neighbors like south korea and japan and more studies were needed to determine the interaction of pollution between cities
a joint study conducted by the space agency nasa and south korea s national institute of environmental research in found that about percent of south korea s pollutants originated within the country while percent came from other countries including percent from china
chinese and south korean officials met tuesday in seoul as part of ongoing talks on the pollution problem
