exclusive-ship in deadly black sea blaze was turned away from port over sanctions
moscow reuters two ships ablaze in the black sea region leaving at least crew dead caught fire while transferring fuel after one vessel was barred from using its usual port in southern russia due to sanctions risk two sources told reuters
the vessels which caught fire on monday have the same names as two tankers the maestro and venice which were included on a sanctions advisory note last year for delivering fuel to syria
the treasury note published in november advised that any dealings with these or other vessels involved in transporting fuel to syria could result in sanctions
the maestro was subsequently barred from using temryuk port in southern russia by the owners of its only gas terminal two industry sources said where it had previously loaded liquefied petroleum gas of russian and kazakh origin for export to the middle east
the russian company could not be reached for comment
vessels can resort to transfers of fuel a risky manoeuvre especially if they are transferring flammable fuel if they do not have access to a port for loading
temryuk port did not immediately respond to a request for comment
reuters was unable to reach the owners of the vessels
russia s transport ministry said the two ships caught fire on monday while loading gas during stormy conditions
russia permits loading of gas at just three locations in the region all ports a source in the ministry said
all transfers especially of such dangerous cargo moreover during stormy weather and in the winter raises big questions the source said
the ministry source said they did not know whether the tanker had been barred from the port but added that doing so was within the rights of the owners of the gas loading terminal
ten sailors out of a combined crew of were confirmed dead by the ministry s maritime unit on tuesday
a further remain missing presumed dead while were rescued it added
the crew was made up of turkish citizens and from india the ministry said
the ships are still on fire and no attempts are being made to put out the blaze due to rough sea conditions a ministry spokesman said
refinitiv data showed milano shipping as the owner of the venice and maestro shipping of the maestro
the venice was recently renamed as the candy one industry source said
but two traders separate to the industry sources told reuters that both vessels were ultimately owned by one turkish company milenyum denizcilik gemi
milenyum was placed on the sanctions list in for arranging the shipment of liquefied petroleum gas and gasoil to syrian government controlled areas
phone numbers for milenyum and milano shipping listed online were not answered
on last year the treasury department added nine russian and iranian individuals and companies on its sanctions list for participating in the shipment of petroleum to syria
it also issued an advisory note warning of the potential sanctions risk for any entities involved in such shipments which listed ships including the maestro and venice as having delivered oil to syria between and
reuters reported in december that both the maestro and venice continued operations after the announcement and regularly entered temryuk port according to refinitiv data
after the reuters report the maestro was barred from using the port s gas terminal by its owners and thereby denied access to the port the two industry sources said
but the venice now known as candy continued to dock at temryuk refinitiv data showed
there s every indication that some black scheme was going on one of the industry sources said
why else would the venice load up with gas and then immediately transfer it onto another tanker the source said adding that the venice was likely to have been permitted access to the port as it had changed its name to candy since the sanctions note
since the announcement the has travelled to near the lebanese and syrian coastline on three occasions refinitiv data showed on tuesday while the maestro has made the same journey once
the data does not show at which port the vessels finally docked
they appear to turn around before reaching the coast
vessels wishing to conceal their location have been known to switch off their transponders and go dark
though ships are allowed to switch off their signalling systems in certain circumstances for example for reasons of security such instances are relatively limited and rare richard meade managing editor of lloyd s list intelligence in london said
both vessels weren t showing up as live despite being fairly close to receivers meade said
this certainly would raise red flags in terms of anybody looking at the accident or criminal the maestro s signalling system last reported its location on saturday when it was located off the coast of turkey in the black sea according to refinitiv data
but on monday it was near the kerch strait a body of water between crimea and southern russia which connects the azov sea to the black sea
there it met the venice which had left temryuk port on sunday morning with a fresh cargo of liquefied petroleum gas an industry source said
after attempting to transfer the highly flammable fuel both ships were on fire
