experts say it’s safe to treble limit for tremors at britain's fracking sites
london jan reuters britain could safely raise the limit for tremors at gas fracking sites to three times their current level two seismologists said on tuesday
fracking at cuadrilla s preston new road site in lancashire northwest england was halted several times last year after seismic activity exceeded limits put in place under britain s traffic light regulation system
under the system work at fracking sites must be halted for hours if seismic activity of magnitude or above is detected
cuadrilla the only company to have fracked for gas so far in britain has said the current seismic regulations are too stringent and could thwart the industry
existing regulations are quite conservative and are set at a level that is unlikely to be felt brian baptie head of seismology at the british geological survey said at a briefing with journalists
he said the limit could safely be raised to magnitude since this is a level similar to vibrations caused by a heavy bin lorry going past and would not pose a risk to buildings or people
magnitude would still be a conservative level ben edwards specialist in engineering seismology at the university of liverpool said at the same briefing
the seismologists warned that raising the limit could lead to higher magnitude so called trailing events which can occur after fracking has stopped but said these would still likely be too small to cause any damage
fracking or hydraulically fracturing involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure
it is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with britain s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
they have also raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination
the process also uses huge amounts of water which must be transported to the site and local residents have complained about disruption from traffic and noise and a potential drop in the value of their homes
the government however is keen to cut the country s reliance on imports of natural gas which is used to heat around percent of britain s homes
both of the seismologists have advised britain s industry regulator the oil and gas authority
cuadrilla is percent owned by australia s aj lucas while a fund managed by riverstone holds a percent stake
