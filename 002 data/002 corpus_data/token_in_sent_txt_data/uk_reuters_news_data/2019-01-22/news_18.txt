update 4-italy's salvini bashes france over libya role in new diplomatic spat
rome reuters deputy prime minister matteo salvini stoking a war of words between rome and paris said on tuesday that france did not want to bring calm to libya because its energy interests there clashed with those of italy
relations between italy and france traditionally close allies have grown frosty since the league and movement formed a coalition last year and took aim at french president emmanuel macron
a source in macron s office dismissed the latest attack as ludicrous while italian prime minister giuseppe conte sought to ease the escalating tensions saying relations between the two countries remained strong despite a string of recent rows
on monday france summoned italy s ambassador after salvini s fellow deputy prime minister luigi di maio accused paris of creating poverty in africa and generating mass migration to europe
salvini backed up di maio saying france was looking to extract wealth from africa rather than helping countries develop their own economies and pointed particularly to libya which has been in turmoil since a uprising in that overthrew strongman muammar gaddafi
in libya france has no interest in stabilising the situation probably because it has oil interests that are opposed to those of italy salvini told canale tv station
a french diplomatic source said it was not the first time that salvini had made such comments and that it was probably because he felt he had been upstaged by di maio
the source added that the accusation was baseless and reiterated that french efforts in libya were aimed at stabilising the country preventing the spread of terrorism and curbing the migration flows
italy s eni and france s total have separate joint ventures in libya but eni s ceo claudio descalzi denied in a newspaper interview last year that there was any conflict between the two firms in the north african state
salvini is head of the league while di maio leads
both are campaigning hard for european parliamentary elections in may and are eager to show they have broken with the consensual politics of and parties
the two men have repeatedly targeted neighbouring france and accused macron of doing nothing to help handle the hundreds of thousands of mainly african migrants who have reached italy from libya in recent years
asked about the latest diplomatic spat salvini said on tuesday france has no reason to get upset because it pushed away tens of thousands of migrants at the french border abandoning them there as though they were beasts
we won t take any lessons on humanity from a french presidential source said populist forces in italy and elsewhere were looking to undermine countries like france and germany which wanted to strengthen the european union
the european elections will be the place where we confront those as you can see again today with the ludicrous comments from the italian government who seek to destroy the european project and the partnership the source said
looking to prevent a diplomatic rupture the italian prime minister issued a statement praising relations with paris saying that rome merely wanted a debate within europe on difficult issues such as immigration
this row does not call into question our historic friendship with france nor with the french people
this relationship remains strong and steady in spite of any political disputes conte said in a statement
