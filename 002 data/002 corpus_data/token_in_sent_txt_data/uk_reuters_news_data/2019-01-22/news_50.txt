oslo reuters apple l oreal and mitsubishi electric are among more than global firms which scored top marks in a ranking of corporate efforts to slow climate change
many companies say they are stepping up action on climate change since almost governments struck the paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting from fossil fuels
but only two percent of firms that submitted data made the a list of cdp s index including johnson johnson nestle china mobile and microsoft
cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project said its data showed the shares of its index leaders tend to outperform on stock markets
companies are coming under increasing pressure from shareholders to address climate change
cdp said the stoxx global climate leaders index based on the cdp a list outperformed the stoxx global of major firms by percent a year from december to july
we think climate action is a lead indicator of quality in other areas especially sustainability and management dexter galvin global director of corporates and supply chains at cdp told reuters ahead of the index publication on tuesday
galvin said it was hard to compare the results with previous years due to changes in the questions posed
as a result a company that dropped off the list was not necessarily performing worse he added
cdp asks companies to disclose their performance on climate change and separately surveys their efforts to limit water use and to protect forests in its study which is backed by more than investors with assets of trillion and is meant to spur efforts to protect the planet
galvin said cdp would in future be bolder in naming and shaming in the report which was issued to coincide with the start of the world economic forum in davos
among examples of efforts made by its a list companies cdp said danish lego launched the first lego elements made from plastic sourced from sugar cane
and korean electronics company lg display had developed and invested in more than reduction technologies between and it added
