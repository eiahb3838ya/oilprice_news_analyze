special report-the political battle behind the dismantling of a worker safety rule
newport news reuters when wardell davis landed work with a norfolk virginia shipbuilding contractor in the fall of he felt lucky
then years old with no high school diploma davis had for years bounced between jobs
the contractor he says promised better pay for grueling labor blasting the hulls of navy ships with coarsely ground coal particles to remove rust and paint
he recalls the fog of dust created as workers fired the crushed coal a residue from power plants against the ship bottoms from hoses moving through the tented blasting area in respirators and protective suits
a year later davis found a better job with a plumbing and heating company
he became a father but still found time to hit the ymca most days for a swim a lifelong passion
then in he began struggling to hold his breath under water soon he couldn t hold it at all
he was dogged by a persistent cough sweats and nausea
in doctors at norfolk s sentara hospital found a black foreign material in his lungs
davis successfully filed a disability claim for interstitial fibrotic disease caused by exposure to abrasive blasting four years and three biopsies later davis survives on a single lung
unable to work he lives on disability payments and has brought suit against abrasives manufacturers and safety equipment providers he alleges failed to protect him
they deny responsibility for his failing health
if i ever would have thought that this would have happened to me i would ve never ever worked there he told reuters his words punctuated by coughs
davis was one of an estimated shipyard and construction workers who regulators say are exposed each year to beryllium a toxic carcinogenic element laced through the coal waste often used in abrasive blasting grits
these workers lie at the heart of a regulatory drama unfolding behind the trump administration s push to relax safety rules it deems burdensome to businesses
just after the election the trump administration and its congressional allies began moving to unravel key provisions of a federal rule issued in the last days of the obama presidency that sharply limited workplace exposure to beryllium and required certain industries to carefully monitor health risks
beryllium inhalation has long been known to cause lung cancer and berylliosis a debilitating potentially fatal respiratory illness
yet efforts to set an updated workplace exposure standard had been stymied for decades by debates over what the new exposure limit should be
the obama rule was based on a compromise developed by labor and industry stakeholders
the trump administration has left the new beryllium exposure limits intact
but in june it announced plans to exempt shipbuilding and construction operations from the rule s ancillary provisions which require air quality testing new workplace hygiene measures and employee health monitoring for illnesses
that decision scheduled to take effect in june would remove the estimated workers from the protections a government analysis shows
a occupational safety and health administration analysis found that the measures now being supplanted could have saved lives estimating they would avert four deaths a year in the shipbuilding and construction sectors
the protections would cost affected industries nearly million a year or about per worker according to the assessment
that analysis a mandated component of the process put the savings to society from averted deaths and illnesses at nearly million yielding a net economic benefit of about million a year
without the benefits of the air testing and health monitoring requirements the exposure limits for beryllium are meaningless said david michaels who headed osha for seven years under obama
if there s no air testing or disease surveillance there s no way to know how much exposure workers are getting or who may be getting sick said michaels who now teaches at the george washington university school of public health
at the department of labor which oversees osha spokeswoman amy louviere said it would be inappropriate to comment for this article because the process is ongoing
the white house did not respond to interview requests
the trump administration s plan to weaken the beryllium rule offers a case study in the renewed power businesses can wield in the regulatory process
in this case emails and government documents reviewed by reuters show a small industry the manufacturers of abrasive blasting grit used a modest lobbying campaign and congressional allies to unwind a rule a decade in the making
never in osha s history has the agency decided to roll back worker protections for a carcinogen deborah berkowitz osha s former chief of staff wrote the agency on behalf of the national employment law project a nonprofit workers rights group
the rule s critics say its provisions for construction and shipyard operations are unnecessary because workers in those environments are already protected by other osha safety requirements
extra costs unfairly fall on businesses they say
osha officials have a mentality that there s no such thing as too much safety said ike brannon president of capital policy analytics a consulting firm that advises businesses on regulatory issues
previously a chief economist for several republican congressional offices brannon says the beryllium rule s construction and shipyard provisions reflect a broken regulatory system that tends to discount business impacts like lost jobs or greater compliance representative bobby scott the new chairman of the house committee on education and the workforce said in response to reuters questions that the panel will investigate whether osha has valid economic or scientific rationale to eliminate the beryllium rule s shipyard and construction provisions
the virginia democrat noted that osha has routinely included such provisions in other health standards including a rule on toxic silica dust
by killing those provisions for beryllium he said the trump administration has created a double political push more than a dozen lawmakers ultimately took up the fight to get the ancillary provisions stripped from the rule
all are republicans mostly from districts with shipbuilding or abrasives manufacturing operations
leading the charge representative bradley byrne of alabama a member of the education and workforce committee who chaired its subcommittee on workforce protections until the democrats took over the house of representatives this month
byrne opposed the provisions out of concern they would kill jobs at gulf coast abrasives manufacturing companies spokesman seth morrow said
any additional costs could result in layoffs he said
in a march letter to administration officials byrne noted that the abrasive blasting industry employs more than people
the beryllium rule was the last major action osha took as the obama administration wound to a close it was published january just days before trump was sworn in
lobbying for its repeal began almost immediately
on march the new administration announced it would delay implementing the beryllium rule in light of substantive concerns raised about its effect on the shipyard and construction industries said a notice published in the federal register and signed by osha administrator dorothy dougherty
dougherty who retired from the agency in june declined to comment
osha provided heavily redacted versions of her emails to reuters which sought them under the freedom of information act
the agency has failed to respond to reuters foia requests filed more than nine months ago for emails from other senior officials involved in the decision
dougherty s notice referenced just one name as the source of osha s concerns about the ancillary provisions alabama s byrne
on march byrne had sent a letter to the labor department and office of management and budget director mick mulvaney whose agency oversees all regulatory proposals by federal agencies urging them to scrap the beryllium rule s ancillary provisions for shipyard and construction operations
the letter sprang from meetings with two abrasive manufacturers in his district spokesman morrow said
both of the manufacturers the mobile abrasives inc and harsco minerals were members of an industry group the abrasive blasting manufacturers alliance that paid lobbying firms nixon peabody and squire patton boggs to try to block the safety requirements
the abma s opposition centered on how the rule would affect the market for the abrasives its members produce
in comments submitted to the federal register by squire patton boggs the alliance said the rule would incentivize employers to switch from abrasives to alternative blasting materials without any safety benefit
harsco referred questions to the abma which declined comment
byrne s letter was submitted the same day as those comments
it included passages that were nearly identical to what the alliance said in some cases word for word
other language in byrne s letter was nearly verbatim to an article published by a scientist employed by harsco in an industry news publication five days earlier
former patton boggs senior partner mark cowan a lobbyist who served on trump s labor department transition team also became involved
on march cowan who served as deputy head of osha under president reagan attended a meeting at the labor department where squire patton boggs lobbyists asked agency lawyers about osha s plans for the beryllium rule
cowan later wrote an essay arguing that thanks to existing safety rules the workers were never threatened by beryllium exposure to begin neither cowan nor squire patton boggs replied to interview requests
gop opposition mobilizes hours after osha announced the beryllium rule delay on march byrne sent another letter to the agency
this one was organized with virginia republican robert wittman of a house subcommittee overseeing naval programs and infrastructure and by other congressional republicans from the house and senate
the letter thanked osha for the delay but urged it to issue a new beryllium rule that did not include the ancillary safety provisions for the shipyard and construction industries
that same day byrne s campaign received in contributions from the associated builders contractors an industry group that supports scrapping the ancillary provisions
byrne wittman and others who signed the letter have drawn financial support for years from the contractors and other industry groups with a stake in the rule including the shipbuilders council of america which donated to each lawmaker in the election cycle
morrow said the two groups had made other donations to byrne and that there was no correlation between the donations and beryllium rule
asked about the donations shipbuilders council of america president matthew paxton said worker safety is the top priority of our industry and that the council is part of a safety alliance with osha
the associated builders contractors did not respond to interview requests
on may harsco employees and cowan attended another meeting at the white house s office of management and budget
seventeen days later osha announced a second delay in the rule s implementation
and on june osha announced its proposal to revoke the safety requirements entirely
virginia s wittman joined byrne in raising concerns because he believed the initial rule could cause potential job loss his office told reuters
osha his office said needed to reassess the mobile abrasives chief financial officer matthew serda told reuters he did not fear losing jobs
instead he said he sought byrne s help to lift the frivolous requirements for the shipyard and construction industries because they would disincentivize those companies from buying coal slag
that could compel manufacturers to switch to costlier abrasives such as glass and garnet
the abrasive blasting industries are already heavily regulated serda said
twenty years ago when workers were wearing bandanas yes it may have been necessary
nowadays they re wearing all kinds of protective equipment he said
i just have not seen anyone contracting beryllium disease from coal slag in the years i ve been working around when osha initially announced plans to revise the beryllium rule it said its previous analyses had not accounted for compliance with personal protective equipment and housekeeping provisions already required at shipyards and construction sites
that argument ran against decades of osha protocol which held that if significant risk of exposure to a hazardous substance can not be completely eliminated ancillary provisions are necessary beyond existing protective equipment said jordan barab former deputy assistant secretary of osha under obama
morrow the spokesman for byrne said there are no known instances of illness in the shipbuilding and construction industries
that point comes with an asterisk no one is officially checking for such illnesses say dozens of occupational health specialists and worker safety advocates interviewed by reuters
the symptoms of berylliosis shortness of breath a persistent cough fatigue are similar to those of some other diseases
as a result diagnosing the malady requires a specific blood test that just a few laboratories in the country perform said one of the labs the national jewish health advanced diagnostics laboratories
they cost about per person the lab says
the nonprofit center for construction research and training a research arm of north america s building trade unions that has partnered with osha to educate construction workers about health hazards has researched beryllium exposure
in a series of studies it found airborne beryllium concentrations of more than times the new permissible exposure limit during coal slag abrasive blasting operations
other studies by groups including the national institute for occupational safety and health found health problems in various construction trades
lee newman a beryllium researcher at the university of colorado denver said he has treated construction trades workers who did demolition work and went on to develop berylliosis
berylliosis definitely afflicts such workers he said
to say otherwise is to ignore the published science on the subject newman said
confounding illness shipyard and construction workers have sought treatment for lung ailments through the association of occupational and environmental clinics a network of some clinics specializing in laborer illnesses and injuries
so many of these cases probably were beryllium disease but nobody s ever going to know said association executive director kathy kirkland
since occupational clinics are equipped to treat common worker ailments but not to test workers blood for beryllium specifically it is impossible to know how many cases were misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis or other pulmonary diseases
at the newport news shipyard a beryllium education campaign is underway driven by local union leaders such as allen harville former safety chairman of united steelworkers local
at a recent town hall harville explained the berylliosis symptoms to a hall of shipyard workers
wardell davis said he wishes his employer had told him about the health risks posed by coal slag and given him a chance to get his blood tested for beryllium years ago
he now prepares for more tests while pushing ahead on the lawsuit he filed alleging abrasives manufacturers and safety equipment providers failed to protect him
his suit pending in newport news circuit court seeks damages from more than a dozen companies
temporary laborers like davis who don t belong to a union are most likely to encounter beryllium exposure said chris trahan cain director of safety and health at north america s building trades unions
large unionized construction companies are shifting away from coal abrasives in favor of alternatives cain said
smaller companies that often employ immigrant workers remain likelier to use them
my concern is that it s the most vulnerable workers she said
