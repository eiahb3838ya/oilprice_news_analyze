rpt-canadian railways ration space as commodity congestion problems worsen
repeats story with no changes to text by rod nickel winnipeg manitoba jan reuters canada s two major railways are rationing space on trains traveling to the country s biggest port and recently prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion the latest indication of their struggle to meet demand from new trade deals
that move prompted canada s transport regulator last week to start an investigation into rail services around port metro vancouver after shippers complained of discriminatory treatment of certain commodities by canadian national railway cn and canadian pacific railway cp
canada is a top shipper of crops fertilizer oil and pulp but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving from ordering railways to clear grain backlogs to alberta s crude oil curtailments this month due to full pipelines
deals with the european union and pacific nations are boosting demand for commodities adding further strain to canada s transportation infrastructure
currently the united states and mexico account for at least percent of canadian exports
both railways last month rationed the volume of traffic around vancouver by restricting movement of some commodities such as peas lentils pulp and paper according to shipper notices seen by reuters
the restrictions called embargoes are usually a tool of last resort for railways to ease congestion by temporarily limiting traffic
but in december shippers allege that cn and cp used them more often than normal harming some commodity sellers more than others in an effort to push through the maximum overall volume
cp imposed embargoes on three specific transloaders facilities that empty rail cars into containers for loading onto vessels
these transloaders handle peas and lentils but were prevented from doing so in december for days at a time said greg northey director of industry relations at pulse canada
the delays caused some containers to miss their vessels triggering contract breach penalties northey said
it was a total mess he said
embargoes also added costs for pulp and paper producers who are trying to bolster ties with asian buyers amid ongoing tariff disputes with the united states
for a second consecutive year the railways imposed more embargo restrictions on pulp and paper than usual in december leading to shipping delays according to the forest products association of canada whose members include canfor corp and west fraser timber
we can t do business like this if we want to diversify markets said association chief executive derek nighbor
it s just a missed poor rail service costs the forest products industry c million million annually the association said
december s problems cost mills as much as a further c million each it said
several shippers said the transportation agency will be asked at a hearing in late january to consider whether the railways discriminated against shippers that fill manifest trains those carrying a variety of products
the investigation could also consider whether the railways violated their common carrier obligations to haul a full range of freight
for cn and cp the investigation raises the risk of further regulation in an industry where they already complain of too much government control
in a statement cn said the transportation agency s investigation should examine the full supply chain and take into account the impact that rain and wind had on operations late last year
cn said freight shipments are up percent from november to
cp chief executive keith creel said he takes great exception to cp being included in the agency s investigation adding in a statement that he is not aware of formal complaints
since the railways embargo and permit system was implemented in december to clear freight the flow of cars to grain terminals has improved
but it is unclear how the backlog happened in the first place said wade sobkowich executive director of western grain elevator association
it indicates that railways have failed to invest in adequate capacity to move goods at peak times he said
canpotex ltd the offshore sales arm of potash producers nutrien ltd and mosaic co has also been affected by congestion and delays around vancouver spokeswoman natashia stinka said
