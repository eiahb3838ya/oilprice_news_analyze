british billionaire dyson moves vacuum giant to singapore
london jan reuters james dyson the billionaire brexit supporter who revolutionised vacuum cleaners with his bagless technology is moving his corporate office and tax registration to singapore from britain to be closer to his fastest growing markets
the company said the move from britain was not driven by the looming departure from the european union or any tax implications
it already manufacturers products in asia and will build its new electric car in singapore
much of its product development will remain in south west england
chief executive jim rowan said the group was seeing the biggest demand for its products like air purifiers and hairdryers as well as cleaners in asia
it allows us to make sure we will be putting our best efforts to secure those opportunities as well as keeping an eye on those investments especially ev electric vehicles and batteries he said
rowan who is already based in singapore will be joined by other senior executives
he said the change in the company s overall tax bill would be negligible as a result of the move and the company was still expanding its research and engineering operation in britain
the move comes as dyson said its annual profit had broken through the billion pound barrier for the first time driven by strong demand in china and other asian countries
