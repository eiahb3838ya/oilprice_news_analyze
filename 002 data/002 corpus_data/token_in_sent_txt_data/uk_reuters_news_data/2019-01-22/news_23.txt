exclusive-worst-case no-deal brexit puts bentley's return to profit at "fundamental risk"
crewe england reuters carmaker bentley is on track to be profitable this year but a brexit puts that at fundamental risk its boss told reuters adding that the chance of britain leaving the eu on march with a deal now seemed fairly britain the world s fifth largest economy is due to leave the european union the globe s biggest trading bloc in days but the government s negotiated deal was rejected by lawmakers leaving open the possibility of a disorderly brexit
the car industry which employs over people in the country has warned that any tariffs and customs checks would hit firms such as bentley s parent company volkswagen as it both exports from britain and imports vehicles and components
bentley which made a million loss in the first nine months of last year is undergoing a turnaround under new boss adrian hallmark who said the group is on course to return to the black but that plan could be undone depending on the form brexit takes
it s brexit that s the killer he told reuters
if we ended up with a hard brexit that would hit us this year because we do have a potential to get beyond to do the it would put at fundamental risk our chance of becoming like other carmakers the brand is taking steps to prepare including building up stocks of imported parts from two days to days and building a higher proportion of cars for some markets in the next few months
we will build more cars for china or the than we would normally do in the period hallmark said
hallmark said he believed the company was prepared and did not plan to temporarily halt output after britain leaves the bloc on march as planned by fellow automakers mini and honda
carry more stock and it s a few million pounds per year
if we had to stop production then that would be a similar value per day he said
hallmark said were three possible outcomes on brexit a deal by march which has a fairly low probability no deal with a degree of unrest and chaos or an extension to britain s eu membership
german automakers bmw daimler and volkswagen made around percent of the million cars sold in britain last year with less than percent of the total built in the country
in britain was the largest single export market for german automakers which sold new cars there or percent of their overall global exports
of the top automotive plants which export the highest proportions of their output to britain seven are in germany including ford in cologne psa in eisenach volkswagen in ingolstadt and mercedes in bremen according to data compiled by lmc automotive
britain s brexit negotiators have pointed to the car industry as an example of where the eu would lose out if there were new trade barriers a source close to the matter told reuters last year
bentley based in the northern english town of crewe recorded a percent decline in sales to vehicles hit by a delay in the arrival of its continental gt model
in china sales rose percent
asked whether the company might move some bentley production out of britain to overcome any brexit hit hallmark said he did not see that happening in the medium term
you can never say never but there s no intention of moving what we have to other facilities because of brexit he said
when we look at new products are they under question
of course they are like every product that is in there was under question we have to be competitive and we reporting by costas pitas editing by guy faulconbridge and jane merriman
