refile-u.s. biodiesel lobby drops effort to adjust $1-per-gallon tax credit
adds dropped letter to word in first paragraph by tom polansek and michael hirtzer chicago may reuters the biggest biodiesel lobbying group has dropped its push to convert a tax credit available to blenders of the biofuel into one for producers the vice president of federal affairs said on friday
the tax credit benefits companies that blend biodiesel into gasoline sold at gas stations
it first went into effect as part the american jobs creation act from to and has often been renewed retroactively in the years since
the national biodiesel board previously sought to change the credit to benefit biodiesel producers it represents saying the credit was intended to support the domestic industry
by contrast some blenders who benefited from the credit were also importing millions of gallons of foreign biodiesel
but import duties imposed by the commerce department have nearly stopped biodiesel imports from indonesia and argentina that were being sold below value kurt kovarik the board s vice president of federal affairs told congressional staff members this week in an email that was obtained by reuters
the change recognizes the success of the trade case in preventing imports of illegally dumped and subsidized biodiesel he said
the board also wants congress to extend the blender s tax credit over a long period of time kovarik said
the national biodiesel board had pushed this year for the credit to be installed retroactively to and extended through but lawmakers as part of a budget deal in february only approved the credit for
scott irwin agriculture economist at the university of illinois said the group is recognizing it will probably fail to convince congress to adjust the credit to apply to biodiesel producers instead of blenders
the political environment for getting the tax credit extended is getting more difficult he said
they are putting all their eggs on the extension of the credit rather than a reporting by tom polansek and michael hirtzer additional reporting by jarrett renshaw in new york editing by grant mccool
