moscow reuters a return to the oil production levels that were in place in october baseline for the current deal to cut output is one of the options for easing curbs russia s energy minister said on saturday
sources said this week that saudi arabia and russia were discussing raising opec and oil production to ease months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far
when we extended the agreement until the end of we spoke about such possibilities of returning to the october level novak told reporters
but a decision will be made in june he added referring to meetings of opec and countries in vienna on june
the existing deal came into force on january and envisaged global oil producers reducing their combined output by million barrels per day bpd to cut bloated stockpiles and prop up oil prices

in march and in april this year it failed to fully comply with the deal pumping at the pace of million bpd a high

novak was also quoted as saying on saturday he expected iran to reduce its output by no more than percent as a result of the move by the united states to withdraw from a nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions against tehran
i think the output reduction will not be as significant as many expect ria news agency quoted novak as saying when asked if he agreed with an estimate that the sanctions could remove as much as barrels a day from the market
some percent is probably the maximum level he said
novak also estimated that the geopolitical risk premium to the oil price was around per barrel
