update 3-canadian natural cuts capital budget 20 pct, shares jump
adds details on outlook crude by rail share update quote from executive by julie gordon vancouver dec reuters canadian natural resources ltd on wednesday forecast a roughly percent drop in capital spending in compared with blaming a lack of market access for its oil and the dysfunctional pipeline nomination process
but canada s largest oil producer also said relief was on the horizon noting it sees some barrels per day bpd worth of new takeaway capacity in place for western canadian producers by the fourth quarter of
that will be further bolstered by the alberta government s controversial decision to mandate output cuts of percent or bpd to help boost sagging canadian crude prices a plan which canadian natural supports

the rare move to mandate cuts is unusual for a market economy like canada and a number of integrated producers with secured pipeline access and domestic refinery capacity expressed disappointment saying they prefer market solutions to the canadian natural also said it was pushing for immediate changes to the nomination system for canada s largest crude pipeline network
enbridge inc s mainline system that carries about million bpd of crude and other liquids operates as a common carrier which means producers nominate or request space on the line on a monthly basis and are allocated a share of capacity based on total requests
producers game the system by requesting more space than they need leading to air barrels leaving the pipelines running below capacity

enbridge has been trying to fix the problem for years

longer term the company is watching progress of two export projects that have faced recent delays transcanada corp s keystone xl pipeline and the trans mountain pipeline expansion
together they would add another million bpd of export capacity for canadian producers of which canadian natural has secured bpd of space
that transport security would allow the company to move ahead with larger growth projects
canadian natural said it expects production to be between million barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd and million boepd
the company said it has the ability to produce more condensate a very light oil that is used in blending and is not included in alberta s production caps
