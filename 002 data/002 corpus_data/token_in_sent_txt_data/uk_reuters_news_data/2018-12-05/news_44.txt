rpt-column-u.s. oil reserves rise to record despite production boom: kemp
repeats with no changes to text chartbook by john kemp london dec reuters crude oil reserves hit record levels at the end of as annual reserve additions outstripped production for the eighth time in nine years government data published last week shows
reserve growth is the main reason predictions about future oil shortages have been repeatedly proved wrong
policymakers have long fretted about the damage to the economy and national security of exhausting domestic oil reserves oil scarcity ideology in national security policy stern
as early as the geological survey was predicting reserves might be exhausted by petroleum resources of the united states report of the national conservation commission gpo
scarcity concerns became prominent again in the the and the market madness a century of oil panics crises and crashes clayton
policymakers responded by pressing for more conservation encouraging the development of overseas reserves reserving domestic supplies for future military needs or experimenting with alternatives
but scarcity forecasts have underestimated the impact of improvements in technology mostly driven by price changes of which shale extraction has been the most recent and dramatic
and we will have cooked the planet through global warming long before we run out of fossil fuels
no mineral including oil will ever be exhausted wrote the late morris adelman an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology genie out of the bottle
if and when the cost of finding and extraction goes above the price consumers are willing to pay the industry will begin to and as former saudi oil minister zaki yamani observed in oil will be left in the ground
the stone age came to an end not because we had a lack of stones and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of the oil age too will end if and when it is replaced by a superior energy source just as mainframe computers buggy whips and typewriters have all been largely superseded
but it won t end for lack of oil
proved oil reserves increased by billion barrels percent in compared with the previous year according to the energy information administration
crude oil and natural gas proved reserves eia
these are estimated volumes of oil that analysis of geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty are recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions
estimates change in response to new field discoveries greater understanding of existing fields technology and changes in prices and costs as well as the amount produced
reserves in amounted to billion barrels of oil surpassing the previous peak set in and enough to sustain production at current rates for years even if no new reserves are added
texas accounted for half the total increase billion barrels followed by new mexico billion alaska billion colorado billion california billion and north dakota billion
tight oil or shale plays accounted for billion of extra reserves with the permian basin in western texas and eastern new mexico billion and eagle ford in texas billion barrels accounting for the lion s share
producers also added almost billion barrels of additional proved reserves in the section of the gulf of mexico
oil producers added billion barrels to their proved reserves last year as a result of new field discoveries and extensions of reserves within existing fields the eia says
they also added another billion barrels as a result of changed estimates of what they can produce using existing technology and at current prices and costs with other adjustments adding billion barrels
reserve additions from all these sources combined comfortably outstripped the billion barrels of oil that were actually produced during the year
nobody finds a reserve just as nobody finds a factory according to adelman
oil reserves are not gifts of nature they represent the outcome of improvements in technology and heavy investment in exploration and production
reserves are renewable and constantly renewed if and only if there is enough inducement to invest in creating them
the inducement depends on price and cost adelman wrote
proved reserves have risen and fallen broadly in line with contemporary production as both have responded to the same price signals
the ratio of proved reserves to contemporary production has been broadly stable at between and years since at least the late
most reserve additions have come from within existing fields as drilling leads to better understanding of the extent of the resource new strata are discovered and recovery techniques improve
for example california s kern river oilfield was thought to contain just million more barrels of oil in but actually produced million more by and was then estimated to have another million remaining
the field had not changed but knowledge had science technology and not least the detailed geology learned by development adelman wrote
at any given moment reserves are being added everywhere the reserve increments of any given period are overwhelmingly in existing fields he explained
the constant search for prospects takes the industry to the fringes of known reservoirs and beyond
the search process is driven by cost comparison
the industry is a great instrument scanning all deposits old and new to develop the cheapest increment or tranche into a in this respect shale has been no different from earlier technological breakthroughs that have led to enormous reserve growth mostly within existing fields and plays
