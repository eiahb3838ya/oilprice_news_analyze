explainer-why is canada's alberta forcing oil production cuts?
dec reuters the western canadian province of alberta this week announced mandated temporary oil production cuts a rare move aimed at bolstering sagging crude prices caused by rising production that has outstripped pipeline capacity and led to a glut in storage
alberta premier rachel notley said the mandated percent cuts some barrels per day bpd are needed to draw down volumes of crude in storage in western canada and bring relief to sagging canadian crude prices
once storage volumes return to more normal levels the forced cuts will be reduced to bpd
the cuts will be spread among companies producing at least bpd based on average production
crude production in alberta s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity creating a bottleneck and a buildup of product in storage
more crude is now moving across the border by rail and by truck but it is not enough to clear the glut
adding to the woes refinery maintenance has taken some buyers temporarily offline
the steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the canadian economy by some estimates and at one point canadian oil was selling for more than less than oil traded on futures markets
canada produces some million bpd and exports about million bpd to the united states about percent of canada s total crude exports

this is a rare move for a market economy like canada but it is not the first time an alberta government has mandated cuts
in peter lougheed forced cuts to protest a national energy program that he said would have harmed the province s oil industry
the controversial cuts are supported by many canadian producers but not all of them
companies like cenovus energy inc and canadian natural resources ltd are vocal supporters of the move with cenovus saying the move will help it maintain capital spending to prepare it to move more oil when more pipelines are available in
executives from canada s suncor energy inc husky energy inc and imperial oil ltd integrated producers with domestic refinery and upgrading capacity expressed disappointment however saying they prefer market solutions to the problem
the larger percent cuts are expected to last three or four months into the first half of according to a number of analysts at which point much of excess storage will be drawn down
after that the smaller cuts will remain in place until to ensure that storage levels do not get too high again
alberta said it will monitor the market closely and reductions will be adjusted accordingly as storage is drawn down or new transport capacity comes online
producers will be allowed to choose where they cut production allowing them to shut in their least lucrative barrels to make up their cut quota instead of having to cut across the board alberta said
the baseline for each company will calculated based on the best six months of the year
each operator will have their first barrels per day exempted so small producers are not affected
western canada select wcs heavy blend crude typically trades at a discount to the west texas intermediate wti benchmark with the lower price reflecting the cost of transport and the quality of the product
the discount has typically been around but has widened in recent months hitting a record at below wti in october according to data from shorcan
alberta and oil producers prefer to add more pipelines but projects face fierce opposition from environmentalists and some aboriginal groups
construction is underway on enbridge inc s line pipeline replacement from alberta to the united states with the project expected to be in service by the end of
transcanada corp s keystone xl pipeline from alberta to the united states is facing a supplementary environmental assessment after a federal judge in montana halted construction last month
the impact on timing remains unclear
the third project is the trans mountain pipeline which is now owned by the canadian government
plans to triple the capacity of that line which runs from alberta to a port in the vancouver area are undergoing a new regulatory review
it is unclear when construction will begin
crude by rail has ramped up sharply this year hitting nearly bpd in september
alberta said last week that it would buy locomotives and rail cars to add an additional bpd of crude by rail capacity
it expects the first trains to be running by december with all online by august
crude by rail will narrow the differential but not as much as pipelines
dealing with the low crude prices is essential for notley who faces an election no later than the end of may
her party faces a tough challenge from the united conservative party led by jason kenney a former cabinet minister with the federal conservatives
