update 3-mexico's new president throws down gauntlet to oil majors
mexico city reuters mexico s new president andres manuel lopez obrador said on wednesday he would not cancel contracts issued to foreign and national oil companies by his predecessor but challenged them to pump oil quickly or no further oil fields would be offered
lopez obrador took office on saturday promising to increase the government s role in the energy industry and roll back what he described as a era in which successive governments gradually opened up the economy
during the election campaign he pledged to review the contracts issued under a landmark energy reform for any signs of corruption
he and his team have not said they have uncovered any wrongdoing in the contracts already awarded
the contracts will not be cancelled so there won t be a loss of confidence he told reporters at a daily news conference
under mexican law the independent oil regulator known as the national hydrocarbons commission cnh runs the auctions supervises the contracts and is the only entity that can cancel the contracts
how lopez obrador handles the energy industry will be one of the biggest challenges of his term
he has promised to raise oil production from historic lows but has not fully clarified how beyond promising more investment in the public sector
during the transition the former mexico city mayor issued a series of abrupt policy changes that battered stocks bonds and the peso
despite the new president s efforts to reassure investors in recent days markets have yet to recover lost ground
the president however did not rule out inviting more investment to mexico s untapped deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico even as he sharply criticized the energy reform a few days before in his inauguration speech
he said companies that have already won contracts should hurry up with their investment and with pumping oil
we can t keep on giving out territory for the extraction of hydrocarbons if there is no investment and there is no production he said adding he was opposed to companies speculating with the contracts
we want them to demonstrate that they are going to invest and produce oil
we will make a decision based on results he said adding that there will be a truce without giving further details
it can take years before investments turn into production
the last government said the contracts could generate billion of investment over the life of the contracts
industry experts say it will be several years before significant amounts of crude flows from the projects
capital economics said the challenge of producing significantly more oil in three years would be very hard to meet suggesting it could take more than twice that time for private oil production to really take off in mexico
it is the clearest sign yet that amlo intends to stop the energy reform in its tracks the research group said in a note referring to lopez obrador by a common nickname
according to cnh data firms have committed hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration and other work plans approved by the regulator
lopez obrador did not say whether he would postpone or cancel a round of auctions set for next february though analysts have said the tenders are unlikely be carried out as scheduled
the tenders cover oil and gas blocks including nine shale areas in addition to partnership rights for seven onshore joint ventures with pemex
mexico s crude production fell to the lowest level in decades under the previous government
lopez obrador says investment in oil company pemex has declined as a result of the reform and private sector investment has not risen significantly
responding to a question about future deepwater oil auctions lopez obrador said the projects had not produced one barrel of while the complicated deepwater projects snapped up by the likes of royal dutch shell exxon mobil corp chevron corp and total sa are still in the exploration phase some onshore projects offered under the reform are now producing about barrels per day bpd official data shows
that includes about bpd from two onshore joint ventures with pemex in which private partners operate the projects plus another bpd from projects operated by new private producers
pemex produced about million bpd in october after consecutive years of decline
