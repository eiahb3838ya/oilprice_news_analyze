wrapup 3-china confident it can clinch u.s. trade pact, trump demands "real deal"
shanghai reuters china expressed confidence on wednesday that it can reach a trade deal with the united states a sentiment echoed by president donald trump a day after he warned of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences
the remarks by the chinese commerce ministry follow a period of relative quiet from beijing after trump and chinese leader xi jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in argentina on saturday
in a brief statement the ministry said china would try to work quickly to implement specific items already agreed upon as both sides actively promote the work of negotiations within days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map
we are confident in implementation it said calling the latest bilateral talks very successful
trump in a post on twitter linked beijing s silence to officials travels and said he thought xi had been sincere during their weekend meeting to hammer out progress over trade
very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina
not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting
all subjects discussed trump wrote on wednesday
the president a day earlier had said the ceasefire could be extended but warned tariffs would be back on the table if the talks failed and that he would only accept a real deal with china
china s foreign ministry referred specific questions to the commerce ministry which is due to hold its weekly news briefing on thursday in beijing
we hope the two working teams from both sides can based on the consensus reached between the two countries leaders strengthen consultations and reach a mutually beneficial agreement soon foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told reporters
the threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world s two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief
the mood has quickly soured however on scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the negotiating period and markets continued to slide on wednesday in part from confusion over the ceasefire s lack of detail
failure would raise the specter of a major escalation in the trade battle with fresh tariff action and chinese retaliation possibly as early as march
the white house has said china had committed to start buying more american products and lifting tariff and barriers immediately while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection
sources told reuters that chinese oil trader unipec plans to resume buying crude by march after the deal reduced the risk of tariffs on those imports
china s crude oil imports from the had ground to a halt
global financial markets sank to lows on wednesday amid the renewed trade concerns extending tuesday s slide

narrow agreements and modest concessions in the ongoing trade dispute will not bridge the wide gulf in their respective economic political and strategic interests moody s investors service said in a report that predicted relations will remain contentious
officials from the united states and a number of other major economies have often criticized china for its slow approach to negotiations and not following through on commitments
china has said comparatively little about the agreement after senior chinese officials briefed the media following the meeting and and chinese accounts of what the deal entails have sometimes differed
officials now face the difficult task of fleshing out a deal that is acceptable to the chinese but also involves significant enough concessions not to be torpedoed by the china hawks in the trump administration capital economics said in a note this week adding that higher tariffs could simply be delayed
a chinese official told reuters that officials were waiting for the leaders to return before publicizing details
president xi and his most senior officials are due back in china on thursday having visited panama and portugal since leaving argentina
on wednesday the global times tabloid which is run by the chinese communist party s main newspaper said the trump administration s statements about the deal including the agreement that china would buy trillion in additional goods were designed to highlight or even exaggerate facets of the deal that benefited the united states
it will be a situation if a deal is realized
but if not more fights and talks will continue alternately for a longer while
chinese society should maintain a calm attitude it said
