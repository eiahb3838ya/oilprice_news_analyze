update 1-brazil antitrust watchdog says looking at wider petrobras refinery sales
sao paulo reuters brazilian antitrust watchdog cade will begin an investigation on wednesday that may result in mandatory sales of refineries by oil company petroleo brasileiro sa cade said in a statement
according to the cade statement the watchdog will investigate the influence of petrobras on fuel prices given that it controls percent of brazil s refining capacity
petrobras earlier this year proposed selling a percent stake in four refineries as part of a wider effort to reduce debt
the company said it would retain about percent of its domestic refining capacity after the privatization
but it stopped the process in july after a decision by the supreme court that privatizations must be approved by congress and after buyers were spooked by a truckers strike in may that forced the company to cut diesel prices
cade revived the issue on wednesday and cited a previous analysis concluded by its technical body adding that the partial sale of the assets may not be enough to create independent competitors and that the company should sell the assets the analysis by the technical body said that petrobras should include in the refineries sale units that are close to each other to reduce distribution costs and increase competition
petrobras should also sell assets in brazil s richest region the southeast the technical body said
the refineries the oil company initially intended to offer to investors were in other regions
in a statement the oil company said it will prove during the investigation it does not have anticompetitive practices
petrobras does not have a monopoly on refining since the
but more competition in the sector depends on a regulatory framework that attracts new reporting by tatiana bautzer editing by sonya hepinstall
