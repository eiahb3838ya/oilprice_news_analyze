refile-update 3-france drops fuel tax hike as "yellow vest" anger persists
paris reuters president emmanuel macron s government is dropping further hikes in next year s budget in the face of protests across france over living costs his prime minister said on wednesday a day after announcing their suspension for six months
the macron administration is struggling to defuse the anger driving the yellow vest protests as it reels from the worst riots seen in central paris in five decades last saturday
the government is ready for dialogue and is showing it because this tax increase has been dropped from the budget bill prime minister edouard philippe told the lower house of parliament
the concession was the latest attempt to quell the worst crisis of macron s presidency after announcing the suspension only the day before
his government indicated earlier that it could also amend a wealth tax that macron shrank last year to cover only real estate assets earning him criticism as the president of the rich
a macron aide denied that any eventual revision of the wealth tax would represent a major by macron a former investment banker adding that the president remained committed to his reform drive
government spokesman benjamin grivet said all policies needed to be periodically evaluated and if deemed not to be working should be changed
he said the wealth tax could be reassessed in the autumn of
if a measure that we have taken which is costing the public money turns out not to be working if it s not going well we re not stupid we would change it griveaux told rtl radio
the unrest over the squeeze on household budgets comes as oecd data showed that france has become the most highly taxed country in the developed world surpassing even denmark
griveaux later told a weekly news conference that macron had called on all political parties trade unions and business leaders to press the need for calm
student protests and planned trade union strikes in the energy and port sectors next week nonetheless underscored the risk of contagion
and with little sign its concessions are calming protesters nerves the government is also preparing for a new round of possible violence on saturday
i want to tell the thugs we will stand up to them and won t give an inch philippe told lawmakers
security sources said the government was considering using troops currently used on patrols to protect public buildings
the yellow vest movement because of the jackets worn by protesters began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes but morphed into a broader rebellion against macron
his administration s shift on fuel tax came after rioters ran amok in central paris torching cars looting boutiques vandalising cafes and private residences and cafes in affluent neighbourhoods
philippe earlier said the suspension to the would be used to examine other measures to bolster household spending power
it marked the first major by macron in his in office at a time polls show that barely one in five french people think he is doing a good job
nearly seven out of eight people told pollsters that the measures did not satisfy the movement s demands according to an elabe survey for bfm tv
the poll also found that although percent were against the violence seen last saturday percent supported the gilets jaunes movement
president donald trump appeared to mock macron over the policy shift which could make it harder for france to meet its emissions reduction target a core element of the paris climate agreement of
i am glad that my friend emmanuelmacron and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago trump tweeted late on tuesday as climate talks take place in poland on how to enforce global action
the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst adding to macron s difficulties college students are agitating and the hardline cgt trade union on wednesday called for strikes in the energy industry and at ports on
