update 4-faroe petroleum's asset swap with equinor could raise stakes in dno bid battle
oslo reuters faroe petroleum has struck a deal to swap norwegian oil and gas assets with equinor in a move that could raise the price that hostile bidder dno has to pay to secure the british energy company
while faroe petroleum s chief executive graham stewart said the deal had been in the works before norway s dno launched its million pound million offer last month and was not intended to stop the bid analysts said it would make faroe a more attractive takeover target
the deal hasn t happened overnight
we haven t pulled it as a rabbit out of the hat as a defense strategy even if it looks like it stewart told reuters
he said the company had held discussions about the swap with equinor for months and most intensely during last summer
faroe rejected dno s pence per share bid on saying it significantly undervalued the firm
faroe s ceo declined to discuss what price level could be acceptable to its shareholders but said that the latest swap deal has made the company more valuable
we want to secure the best value for our shareholders and the latest deal can not be ignored he added
dno which already owns percent of faroe raised questions over the deal however arguing it switched future growth potential for cash flow from fields with declining output
while faroe has asserted this is not designed to stop the dno offer we need to ask if this is good value for a company seeking growth that is the test this deal needs to satisfy the firm said in a statement
faroe said the swap would significantly reduce the need for capital investments as the company s stake in billion njord project would fall to zero from percent while it would add barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd for faroe in
its overall output is expected to rise to boepd in making the company more confident in its ability to boost production to more than boepd in the medium term stewart said
as a result of the swap faroe will get equinor s stakes in the vilje and ringhorne east fields while equinor gets faroe s stakes in bauge and hyme an oilfield connected to njord
in addition faroe will get part of equinor s stakes in the marulk and alve fields
the companies did not give a value for the assets involved but rbc capital estimated that at an oil price of per barrel the overall deal is worth about million
sparebank markets analyst teodor said that at first glance the deal looked better for faroe than equinor and will make faroe a more attractive acquisition target
we believe pence per share will be the final transaction price in the drama said
maybe a tad higher after today s faroe shares were down percent at around gmt narrowly outperforming a european oil and gas index down percent weighed down by weaker crude prices
equinor shares were down percent while dno s were down percent
