s.korean firm proposes building lng import terminal in australia
melbourne dec reuters a south company has proposed building a terminal on australia s east coast to import liquefied natural gas the fifth proposal for such a project in the world s lng exporter
the proposals have come after three new lng export plants on the east coast have sucked gas out of the southeastern market and nearly tripled wholesale gas prices in places such as sydney over the past two years
epik a lng floating storage and regasification unit fsru project development company on wednesday said it had signed an agreement with the port of newcastle to do preliminary work on a proposed fsru that it estimated would cost up to million including onshore infrastructure
we are confident that by importing lng via a new fsru terminal we will be able to provide an infrastructure solution that is capable of delivering a source of alternative gas supplies to the region epik managing director jee yoon said in a statement
port of newcastle the world s largest coal export terminal said the plan was in line with its own efforts to diversify
the port faces the decline of coal exports due to the global drive to cut carbon emissions
port of newcastle is uniquely placed as a deepwater port with enviable land and channel capacity said the port s spokesman sam collyer
epik s spokesman based in houston declined to say where the financing for newcastle lng would come from
the million to million cost is well above estimates for four other proposed lng import projects one in new south wales two in the state of victoria and one in south australia
those projects aim to start importing lng around or despite a report by the australian government s commodities forecaster in july saying the economics might not work as it might be difficult to find cheap lng beyond credit suisse analyst saul kavonic said there was not enough of a market for all five projects to go ahead
