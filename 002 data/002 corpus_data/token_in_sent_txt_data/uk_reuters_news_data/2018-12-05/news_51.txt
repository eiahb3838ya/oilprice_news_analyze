update 2-two key canada-to-u.s. oil pipelines hit by disruptions
new reuters two major pipelines carrying oil from canada to the united states were hit by disruptions on tuesday the latest hit to canada s oil industry just days after the alberta government announced forced cuts in crude production
a number of lines on the enbridge inc mainline system which carries crude and other liquids were hit by power outages in the western canadian province of saskatchewan due to severe weather the company said tuesday
transcanada corp s crude keystone pipeline was also shut due to the outage according to a shipper on the line and traders
there was no estimated restart timeline for the line one source said citing a notice to shippers
the company did not respond to a request for comment
the outages though temporary are just the latest constraints to hit western canadian oil producers already struggling to export crude due to full pipelines as production has surged to a record at more than million barrels a day in
both systems originate in alberta where most of canada s oil is produced
enbridge for its part said it will remain in contact with saskpower that province s primary utility through the night to evaluate the possibility of starting the lines the mainline system ships about million bpd
the alberta government on sunday imposed mandatory output cuts of percent or bpd until excess crude in storage is drawn down
the cuts will begin in january
western canadian select wcs heavy oil prices weakened on the news dealers said closing at a barrel below west texas intermediate benchmark prices
in october that discount hit a record of below prices but had narrowed to a discount on monday after the production cuts were announced
traders said they expect the outages to be brief
if the lines are not up tomorrow i m sure folks will start to get nervous one shipper on the lines said
transcanada s keystone line runs to steele city nebraska and from there to other markets
decreased power consumption on that line was observed at about est gmt according to market intelligence firm genscape
enbridge said its lines and would be shut through the night as saskpower anticipates power will remain down until at least until wednesday morning
