act on climate change to cut 'outrageous' pollution deaths - who
katowice poland dec thomson reuters foundation f ighting climate change is one of the best ways to improve health around the world and the benefits of fewer deaths and hospitalisations would far outweigh the costs of not acting the world health organization said on wednesday
keeping global warming well below degrees celsius as governments have pledged to do under the paris agreement could save about a million lives a year by through reducing air pollution alone the agency said
burning fossil fuels which emit carbon dioxide the main culprit for climate change is a major driver of air pollution the who said in a report issued at climate talks in poland
maria neira who s director for public health said exposure to air pollution causes million deaths worldwide every year
this is one of the most outrageous things happening today she said
we want to tell countries the more you delay this clean energy transition the more you will be responsible for the millions of deaths that are recorded every health gains resulting from action to curb climate change from adopting renewable energy to getting people out of cars and onto bicycles would add up to about twice the cost of rolling out those policies globally and even more in china and india the who said citing a recent study
who scientist and report author diarmid said health had often been disconnected from discussions on climate change but there was now an urgent need to break down the barriers and talk about the benefits for society
this is the same fight and we have the same answers he added
in the countries that emit the most greenhouse gases the cost of air pollution for public health is estimated at more than percent of gross domestic product the who report said
in comparison keeping warming to the paris deal temperature limits would require investing about percent of global gdp
kristie ebi professor of global health at the university of washington said the world now had scientific evidence that people today are suffering and dying from climate change
the consequences range from chronic diseases linked to air pollution such as asthma and lung cancer to as crop yields fall and rising carbon dioxide levels in the air slash nutrients in staple foods she added
inia seruiratu fiji s minister of agriculture and disaster management said his pacific island nation was already experiencing the effects of climate change on health such as an increase in diseases after storms and floods
it is working to build health clinics that can also withstand strong winds and other extreme weather he noted
despite such efforts the who report said financial support particularly for small island nations and the poorest countries remains woefully inadequate
only about percent of funds provided by international institutions for measures to adapt to climate change have been allocated to health projects it added
money is also lacking for scientific research into the different options for tackling the problem ebi said
if countries do not ramp up efforts to protect their people s health on a warming planet the battle is likely to end up in the courts warned who s neira
that is already happening lawyers and plaintiffs in climate change legal cases told reporters on the sidelines of the talks in the polish city of katowice
in switzerland for example a lawsuit has been filed on behalf of about elderly women who are challenging the government s emissions reduction policy on the grounds that they are vulnerable to heatwaves exacerbated by climate change
and in an ongoing court case filed against the government health experts have diagnosed plaintiffs with asthma linked to air pollution and emotional trauma caused by climate stresses group member vic barrett said in poland
it is not just about saving the planet and the glaciers in the future it is about protecting the health of the people right now said who neira
