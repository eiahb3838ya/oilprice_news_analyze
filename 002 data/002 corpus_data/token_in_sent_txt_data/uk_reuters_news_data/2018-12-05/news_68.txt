german solar battery maker sonnen qualifies to provide grid services
frankfurt reuters german solar battery maker sonnen has won approval to join the lucrative market for keeping the country s power network in balance giving a boost to its drive to reach profitability
cornefert head of sonnen s eservices retail unit told reuters it had been accepted by germany s biggest power grid firm tennet to join the balancing market in which companies compete in auctions to either deliver power or take it into storage to keep the system balanced
sonnen will start bidding in primary balancing power auctions from next week by pooling the power generation and storage of its thousands of small customers he said
for the first time a big network of home storage systems becomes a protagonist in the energy market cornefert said
the move will put sonnen in competition with german power firms including big players rwe and uniper
sonnen which secured million euros million in may from shell ventures and existing shareholders to expand at home and abroad has sold around battery storage systems to german households with rooftop solar panels
while its customers typically consume percent of the power they produce themselves the batteries help them store power for later use release it to the public grid or share it with other sonnen community members in an online network
joining the balancing market provides another option with the company set to offer megawatt mw blocks of flexible production or storage up to a maximum mw it said
that only equates to a small power plant but has potential to expand as storage becomes cheaper and generation becomes less centralized
germany has million solar systems whose subsidized sales tariffs are due to be phased out in the coming years
providing balancing power is becoming more important
as more variable renewable power capacity is built in germany s drive to become a economy drops or surges in grid frequencies are becoming faster and more intense
grid frequencies must not deviate too far from around hertz to keep flows on power transmission lines intact
control measures taken by grid managers entail adjustments within seconds currently earning operators potentially around euros per mw per year
cornefert said sonnen might pay back earnings from the balancing market to customers in the form of entitlements to free power
