explainer-opec's challenge - to pump more oil while keeping deal in place
vienna june reuters for opec with its deal is a nice problem to have
once known for rampant cheating on agreed oil output targets the organization of the petroleum exporting countries has been on a pact in place since january cutting around one and a half times the promised amount
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets on friday to decide on output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the united states india and china to cool down oil prices by producing more crude
three opec members iran venezuela and iraq have been reluctant to consent to a formal increase in opec s output target agreed as part of a deal with russia and other producers and running until the end of
but on wednesday iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said opec members that had on cuts should return to compliance with agreed quotas a possible compromise to keep both the existing deal and produce more oil
if all opec members produced as much as they were allowed under the deal opec output would in theory rise by about barrels per day based on reuters estimates of the group s production in may
but in practice it would mean a much smaller boost of less than a of that amount effectively from saudi arabia
riyadh is considered the only opec member pumping that could add significantly more at short notice
while saudi arabia s cutting by more than required has helped opec s compliance involuntary reductions in venezuela amid economic crisis and in angola due to natural decline have had a larger impact and can not be reversed at short notice
so a larger increase agreed by opec would require a new set of output targets
this could reallocate production from members their quotas to those that can pump more namely saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates
it could also raise targets for all even though any increase would come from only a few members
so far there is no indication that iran and the other members would agree to such a reallocation although with officials holding extensive talks in the to friday s opec meeting further compromise could be made
if the existing deal is retained and saudi arabia felt there was a need to add more oil riyadh could still increase production unilaterally as it did after a meeting in june ended with no decision
