iran may agree increase in opec oil output - minister
june reuters iran may agree to an increase in oil output by opec and its allies through producers who have overdelivered on cuts moving up to their quotas iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said in an interview with cnn
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec russia and several other producers had agreed to cut output by about million barrels per day bpd starting from january
the agreement has driven down inventories and pushed up oil prices
however a number of producers including saudi arabia have been cutting more deeply than planned despite outages in venezuela and libya meaning they could modestly boost output while complying with their quotas
the compliance or i say is close to in recent months percent
it doesn t need any agreement or resolution from opec to comply percent zanganeh said
bringing compliance to percent from current levels would mean adding at least million bpd of crude to the market sources have said
opec meets on friday to decide output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the united states and china to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude
zanganeh said opec members are discussing about going back to percent compliance and they could agree to increase supply at the meeting without the need for new agreement or resolution
