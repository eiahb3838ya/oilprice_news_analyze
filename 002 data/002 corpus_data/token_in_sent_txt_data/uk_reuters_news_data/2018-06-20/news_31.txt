german power, gas grids co-operate on storage plans up to 2030
companies plan to build big plants aim to help cope with expanding renewable power volumes supervisory bodies must agree as customers pay bill frankfurt june reuters major german power and gas grid firms amprion and open grid europe oge unveiled plans on wednesday to jointly build large ptg plants next decade seeking to harness a new technology to help store and transport renewable energy
the two said they had presented the proposals to germany s energy regulator the federal network agency with a view to securing permission for plans that stretch to a period when germany is phasing in tougher climate protection goals
we are looking at to megawatt mw size ptg plants potentially in lower saxony or northern westphalia state amprion board member brick said by phone after a press conference in berlin
a first plant could go up in or early he added
ptg technology offers a way to solve the storage problem of volatile electricity output from wind and sunshine by running it through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen which can be used as a transport fuel or fed into gas grids
grids must deploy new strategies to cope with the government s latest targets to nearly double the share of wind and solar power to percent of electricity generation by
so far ptg plants have only been up to mw in size at test locations
while government plans say they want mw of power storage by we won t get far with a maximum mw per plant brick said
the ptg plants would complement thousands of kilometres of new north to south cables also planned by amprion and its peers to come online by to accompany the boom in green power production
but the lines have been delayed by public opposition
amprion s annual report showed that of germany s targeted gigawatts gw of installed renewable capacity by percent has already been put in
but only percent of a total km of new power lines designated to accompany the new capacity has been built
this has resulted in northern germany often wasting excess wind power while the industrial south risks shortfalls
the resulting costs for redispatch major intervention measures on the power grid by engineers in rose by percent to billion euros billion
this is contentious as consumers must share grid costs as part of their bills
