update 2-siemens uk boss: give us clarity on how post-brexit trade will work
london reuters the united kingdom needs to urgently clarify how trade with the european union will work after brexit and the world s economy should remain in the customs union unless there is a proper alternative the boss of siemens uk said
with only nine months left until the united kingdom is due to leave the eu little is yet clear about how trade will flow as prime minister theresa may who is grappling with a rebellion in her party is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc
my biggest worry about brexit is that i don t know what we are planning for juergen maier the uk ceo of german engineering giant siemens told reuters in an interview
we need to put something in place quickly that works and if that is not possible and until that point then we have to just default to staying in the customs union maier said
may has ruled out staying in the eu customs union which clubs the eu members in a area where there is a common import tariff for goods
but the nature of the future trading relationship with the world s biggest trading bloc has split may s government and conservative party
under the current timetable both london and brussels are working towards a final brexit deal in october to give enough time to ratify it by brexit day in march
maier said we ship thousands of goods daily across the borders that help keep power stations running that help keep trains running that help keep british manufacturing running are those parts going to be able to pass pretty frictionlessly over the border or are we going to be in a situation where we have supply chains that are struggling to deliver to us and where we are struggling to export from the uk the views of the siemens boss highlight the growing sense of nervousness among business leaders about the prospect of britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade
the uk is siemens market after the united states germany and china
it employs people in the uk and uk jobs depend on it
if the brexit we end up having provides significant friction provides significant cost then of course that will be an argument against making investments here in the uk he said
maier who was born in germany and moved to the uk when he was said he was not seeking to stop brexit but wanted britain to seek a soft and reasonable departure
around percent of the uk s total trillion trade in goods last year was with the eu so may wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible
the options discussed so far though offer nothing close to the current ease of trade according to maier
i would like to stay in the customs union until we see a workable alternative and i haven t seen one yet he said
maier said that adding just two minutes onto every lorry s customs procedure passing through the southern english port of dover would produce a tailback on either side of the channel after one day
supporters of brexit admit there may be some pain for the uk s trillion economy but that it will prosper when cut free from the eu which they cast as a failing experiment in european integration
many ceos though fear that a disorderly brexit will disrupt supply chains across europe and cripple the economy for at least a decade by deterring investment
maier said planning for brexit was tough
the fact is it is very difficult because we don t know exactly what we are planning for
contingency planning is very difficult when the options are so we have got contingency plans that we can implement depending on various scenarios and one of those scenarios is a no deal but let me tell you that scenario doesn t look very good he said
so how much has all that brexit worry cost siemens so far
we haven t put a figure on what brexit has cost us so far
but it is relatively small to what a brexit is likely to cost especially in a no deal editing by stephen addison and elaine hardcastle
