vedanta says acid leak severe at south indian copper smelter
thoothukudi india june reuters vedanta ltd said on wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its southern indian copper smelter was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences
the district administration had said on sunday the leak was minor and steps were being taken to empty the storage tanks as a safety precaution
there is a severe leakage in the pipe flanges and the pipe flanges are submerged in the acid pool collected in the dykes around the acid storage tank the company said in a petition to the madras high court
vedanta the indian subsidiary of vedanta resources said it sought a limited reconnection of the electricity supply for maintenance to guard against a potential loss of life and damage to air and ground water
there is a grave risk and danger as there are other tanks and there are flammable chemicals and materials within the plant area it said
however the district s top administrative official sandeep nanduri stuck to the earlier view that the leak was minor
that is their version and this is ours
however we are completely evacuating the sulphuric acid from all tanks as a safety precaution said nanduri
the tamil nadu state government ordered a permanent closure of the plant and disconnected the power supply last month following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters killing of them
the protesters demanded a permanent shutdown of the plant which they said was causing air and water pollution
locals and activists see the smelter as a risk to fisheries
vedanta says the protests are based on false notions
vedanta also said it was unable to meet government officials because of the tense situation prevailing after the protests
a senior state minister told reuters in an interview early this month that there was no question of engaging with the company and the plant will remain shut
the smelter which has been shut for about three months annually produces about a million tonnes of sulphuric acid a corrosive byproduct of copper smelting used as a raw material by the fertiliser industry
it accounted for over a third of india s refined copper production and employed over people
the company plans to appeal the government s move to shut the plant
