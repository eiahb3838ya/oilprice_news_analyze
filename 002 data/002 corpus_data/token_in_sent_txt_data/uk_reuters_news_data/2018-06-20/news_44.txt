vienna june reuters india the world s oil consumer and importer on wednesday urged opec nations to fill a supply gap and ensure sustainable oil prices as geopolitics affect the output of some producers
the world faces likely lower oil exports from iran opec s producer after president donald trump pulled out of a nuclear accord with a vow to renew sanctions against tehran
india is the biggest oil client of iran after china
political conditions sometimes internal and sometimes external result in reduced output of some countries
we expect from opec and its members a commitment to step in and more than fill the gap to ensure sustainable prices indian oil minister dharmendra pradhan said at a seminar in vienna
he said currently high oil prices dent the economic development of many countries
the already fragile world economic growth will be at threat if oil prices persist at these levels
my fear is this will lead to energy poverty in many parts of the world he said
