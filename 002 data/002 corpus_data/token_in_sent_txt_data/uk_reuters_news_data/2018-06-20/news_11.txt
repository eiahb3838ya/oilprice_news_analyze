update 2-pdvsa's exports sink in june amid seizures, shipping backlog -data
houston reuters venezuelan pdvsa s oil exports fell percent in the first half of june compared with may according to internal trade reports from the company as deepening output declines and seizures of some caribbean assets disrupted crude and fuel shipments
pdvsa exported barrels per day bpd in the first two weeks of june a drop versus million bpd shipped in may
the numbers do not include cargoes of upgraded oil by two of pdvsa s joint ventures which are exported separately
the trade data reveals the extent of the oil firm s export crisis from declining crude output a lack of cash for spare parts and equipment and a loss of employees fleeing due to hyperinflation and the nation s severe recession
it also underscores how producer conocophillips use of court attachments in the caribbean to satisfy a billion billion arbitration award against pdvsa over a nationalisation have left the venezuelan company with limited ability to meet supply contracts especially to asian customers
pdvsa did not immediately reply to a request for comment
in june pdvsa increased its loading of larger vessels to deliver bigger cargoes to some customers according to the company s reports and thomson reuters vessel tracking data
it also began seaborne transfers to ease tanker congestion at the opec country s main oil port of jose
but the strategy has not succeeded in solving the shipping delays
pdvsa s exports so far in average million bpd percent below the million bpd shipped last year due to falling output and a lack of access to the caribbean ports it previously used for shipping and storing oil according to the company s documents
as of wednesday more than tankers were anchored off venezuelan shores some of which were waiting to load about million barrels of crude and products for export
that backlog was down slightly from a peak earlier this month
several very large crude carriers vlccs and suezmax tankers chartered by reliance industries nayara energy pdvsa s unit citgo petroleum and valero energy were among those in line according to reuters data
pdvsa this month asked customers not to send tankers to lift oil for exports until it had loaded vessels waiting for weeks at two main venezuelan ports
the oil company since has been working to catch up on crude and refined products shipments to its largest customers but through the first half of june its contract compliance remained low according to the firm s data
deliveries of merey heavy crude and fuel oil to china national petroleum corporation cnpc one of pdvsa s largest creditors satisfied only percent of the bpd required by its contracts in june the data showed
two vlccs chartered by cnpc and subsidiaries have been waiting since late may to load crude at jose according to reuters data
shipments of boscan heavy crude to chevron corp covered percent of the contracted volume in the first two weeks of june while crude and fuel supplied to cuba met percent of its bpd contract
no crude shipments were delivered to indian refiners in the first half of the month out of the bpd of venezuelan crude contracted
but two large tankers carrying million barrels combined were shipped to the asian country this week the reuters data shows
india s reliance and nayara energy have at least two more deliveries pending this month
large tankers sent by the companies have been waiting for up to a month to load at jose port
