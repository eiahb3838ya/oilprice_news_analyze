total's north sea oilfield workers hold strike ballot
london reuters britain s biggest labour union is balloting rig workers at three of total s north sea oil platforms over a potential strike due to the company s refusal to reduce the number of unpaid working days the union said on wednesday
after the oil price crash in the workers agreed to work an extra days unpaid to help the company during the downturn wullie wallace regional officer of unite the union said
however with the recovery in oil prices to around a barrel their highest in over three years the workers want to return to the previous system which total has so far refused
the ballot will end on june and any industrial action would affect oil output from the alwyn dunbar and platforms most of which feeds into the key forties crude stream
some also contributes to the benchmark brent grade
wallace said industrial action could take two forms an end to working overtime or a series of strikes which would affect output
the workers include those in the control room and production technicians
an output disruption could impact the global oil market as the price of forties crude is one of the five grades used to set the dated brent benchmark which is in turn used to price the bulk of the world s oil trades
around one fifth of all north sea oil comes from the forties crude stream
the company has rejected unite s proposal to reduce the number of days worked offshore
the days were given up for no extra payments in order to assist total e p uk at the height of the downturn unite said in a statement
instead the union said the company had proposed a new system of work shifts versus the traditional two weeks which would bring the number of extra days to
no one should be expected to work twenty one days in a row working twelve hour shifts being pushed to the limits of what is safe mentally and physically wallace said in the statement
total said it was consulting with its workforce and the proposed rota change was prompted by its acquisition of maersk oil that completed in march
the purchase made total the second largest operator in the north sea
following the recent acquisition of maersk oil we now have a number of different rotas across our worksites and we would like to introduce a uniform system a total spokeswoman said
unite said the industry has been gradually shifting to longer shifts and that raised the likelihood of health problems
the three off rota pattern is now worked by percent of the workforce offshore compared with just percent working the same pattern in it said
the world s top oil companies had to make drastic cuts during the oil price downturn
their balance sheets showed a recovery last year while in the majors are expected to generate more cash than at any time this decade
total recovered faster than some of its competitors posting a percent rise in net profit last year
