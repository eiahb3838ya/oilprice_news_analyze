in wind-down, bankrupt suniva wants to abandon solar panels
june reuters a solar company that convinced washington to impose protective tariffs on cheap imports to help it survive is seeking bankruptcy court approval to abandon its inventory of solar panels as it winds down operations
in a filing with the bankruptcy court in delaware late on tuesday suniva inc requested approval to abandon solar panels with a liquidation value that it says exceeds million
the filing follows news last week that suniva s biggest creditor sqn capital management won an auction of the solar company s technology licenses and manufacturing equipment
in a news release sqn said it was on the verge of determining which partner will provide the best path to revitalizing the company and meeting the overwhelming demand for suniva s suniva roiled the solar industry by starting a battle over tariffs that a leading industry group the solar energy industries association said would drive up the cost of solar and lead to thousands of job losses
rather than using its tariff victory to reorganize suniva last month held an auction for many of its assets and is now seeking to abandon solar panels it had been storing in warehouses according to the filing with the bankruptcy court in delaware
norcross suniva filed for chapter bankruptcy in april
days later it filed a request for tariff relief to help it compete against inexpensive solar panel imports
in its court filing on tuesday suniva said it no longer needs the solar modules for a reorganization and proposed that another creditor wanxiang america corporation take possession of them in exchange for its claims
the company did not disclose how much it owes wanxiang but said it does not believe the value of its inventory exceeds that amount
suniva also requested that wanxiang pick up some of maintenance costs related to the solar modules saying it held on to the inventory throughout its bankruptcy proceedings solely for wanxiang s benefit
a hearing is scheduled for june
