munich reuters munich prosecutors questioned audi s arrested chief executive rupert stadler about a global scandal on wednesday a person familiar with the matter told reuters
stadler who was arrested on monday and is being held at a prison in the southern german city of augsburg spoke with investigators in the presence of his lawyer the source added
prosecutors and stadler s lawyer did not comment on the nature of their discussion
stadler himself was not reachable for comment

munich prosecutors are investigating him for suspected fraud and false advertising in connection with emissions test cheating by audi part of the broader dieselgate scandal that has engulfed volkswagen vw since
they remanded stadler in custody on monday to prevent him from obstructing their probe
stadler on tuesday temporarily stepped down from his position as ceo of audi and as a member of vw s management board
audi named abraham schot as interim ceo
stadler has been under fire ever since audi admitted to using cheating software in november two months after vw but has enjoyed backing from members of the porsche and piech families who control vw and audi
the technique of using software to detect a pollution test procedure and to increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests was first developed at audi
in designing the defeat device vw engineers borrowed the original concept of the emissions software from audi vw said in its plea agreement with authorities in january in which the company agreed to pay a billion fine to reach a settlement with regulators
vw has insisted the development of illegal software also known as defeat devices was the work of employees and that no management board members were involved
prosecutors have challenged this by indicting vw s former ceo martin winterkorn
investigations in germany are continuing
