update 7-iran signals compromise for modest rise in opec oil output
vienna reuters iran signaled on wednesday it could compromise on a small increase in opec oil output when the group meets this week as saudi arabia scrambled to convince fellow members of the need for a larger rise in production
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries meets on friday to decide output policy amid calls from major consumers such as the united states and china to cool down oil prices and support the global economy by producing more crude
iran said on tuesday opec was unlikely to reach a deal setting the stage for a clash with kingpin saudi arabia and russia which are pushing to raise production steeply from july to meet growing global demand
but on wednesday iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said opec members that had overdelivered on cuts in recent months should comply with agreed quotas
that would effectively mean a modest boost from producers such as saudi arabia that have been cutting more deeply than planned despite production outages in venezuela and libya
opec could keep the same deal with compliance going back to percent said an opec source who is aware of iran s stance
opec mohammad barkindo said he was confident there would be a deal when the producer group meets in vienna on friday
russia has proposed opec and producers raise output by million barrels per day bpd effectively wiping out existing production cuts of million bpd that have helped rebalance the market in the past months and lifted oil to per barrel
oil traded as low as in
saudi energy minister khalid also said on wednesday that the market demanded more oil in the second half of this year and that opec was moving toward a good decision
ecuador said opec and its allies could agree to a compromise increase in output of around million bpd
a decision to increase output could be taken even with iran refusing to sign up as has happened before in opec

he said trump had contributed to the rise in prices by imposing sanctions on opec members iran and venezuela which will likely lead to lower exports
zanganeh said he would leave vienna on friday even before opec holds talks with producers the next day but efforts were underway on wednesday to convince iran to participate in a deal
sources said saudi arabia did not want to be seen as putting too much pressure on iran and hence russia was instead trying to convince tehran
zanganeh was due to attend a ministerial committee on thursday two sources said
iran is usually not part of the committee which includes russia saudi arabia the united arab emirates oman kuwait algeria and venezuela
iraq and venezuela have also opposed a relaxation of production cuts fearing a slump in prices

gulf oil producers views still differed on wednesday on how much to increase production and whether such a move should be gradual sources said
they nevertheless tried to bring iran on board for a deal with ministers from the uae kuwait and oman meeting zanganeh on wednesday
oman s oil minister mohammed bin hamad said he believed iran would agree to an output increase on friday
he said the meeting would tackle with oil output cuts and that iran was very cooperative
