update 2-u.n. special envoy jolie visits syrian refugees in iraq
domiz camp iraq reuters the world is failing to properly invest in the syrian refugee crisis and families women and children are suffering terribly as a result refugee agency special envoy angelina jolie said on sunday
the hollywood actress was visiting the domiz camp in the kurdistan region of iraq which is home to syrian refugees displaced by seven years of civil war
funding received by the high commissioner for refugees unhcr to help refugees from the syrian conflict fell sharply this year from when the agency received only percent of the funds it needed jolie told a news conference
there are terrible human consequences
when there is even not the bare minimum of aid refuge families can not receive adequate medical treatment
women and girls are left vulnerable to sexual violence many children can not go to school and we squander the opportunity to invest in refugees she said
unchr will publish figures on tuesday that show that the number of displaced people globally and the duration of their exiles are the highest they have ever been she said
at the same time political solutions seem to be completely lacking leaving a void that humanitarian aid can not fill
words like unsustainable don t really paint a picture of how desperate the situation really is said jolie
she met families at the camp including two mothers who are now widows caring for young children after their husbands died from conditions that could have been treated under normal conditions jolie said
in domiz was a small camp housing tents
now it is a town complete with concrete houses shops and fast food stalls
ahmed hussein a refugee father of nine children one of whom died and five of whom are handicapped said he and other refugees lacked access to basic treatment and could not find jobs
i wish angelina had come to my house to meet my handicapped children who need medical treatment he said in his makeshift house where he has been living since when he fled the syrian town of qamishli with his family
on saturday jolie visited mosul the biggest city in northern iraq which iraqi forces took back last year from islamic state militants who had occupied the city for three years forcing residents to flee
jolie met families from western mosul and walked through bombed out streets video footage and photos provided by the unhcr showed
normality has returned to many parts of mosul with displaced residents leaving camps nearby to return home but reconstruction in the old city in west mosul has been slow
it was largely destroyed during a campaign by a alliance of iraqi government units kurdish peshmerga fighters and shi ite militias backed by air support from a coalition
this is the worst devastation i have seen in all my years working with unhcr
people here have lost everything jolie said in a statement
they are destitute
they have no medicine for their children and many have no running water or basic services she said
i hope there will be a continued commitment to rebuilding and stabilising the whole of the city
and i call on the international community not to forget jolie has worked for unhcr since visiting uprooted civilians from iraq to cambodia and kenya
this was her fifth visit to iraq unhcr said
