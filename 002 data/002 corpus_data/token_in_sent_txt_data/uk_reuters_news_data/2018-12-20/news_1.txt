tullow agreed early last year to sell total most of its stake in ugandan fields for million but cnooc later exercised its rights to buy half of the tullow assets on sale
i gave conditional consent for this transaction subject to payment of tax obligations as assessed by the uganda revenue authority of about million energy minister irene muloni told a news conference
the three firms currently each hold a percent stake in the fields and tullow is now selling percent of its stake which will be split equally between total and cnooc
tullow spokesman george cazenove said in an emailed statement tullow believed it should not have to pay the assessed ugandan tax
as tullow has stated on a number of occasions we believe that this deal should not attract substantial tax liabilities and that this position is supported by uganda s tax laws he said
tullow and its partners remain in discussions with the government of uganda on this matter and the deal will only complete when those negotiations are brought to a satisfactory muloni said after the deal is finalised tullow would be a and total would be the operator in the northern part of license area while cnooc uganda would be the operator of the southern part of the area
given the above progress we now expect the licensed companies to undertake the final investment decision for the upstream projects before june she said
uganda discovered commercial crude oil deposits in the west of the country near the border with the democratic republic of congo more than years ago
the start of commercial production has been repeatedly delayed due to a lack of required infrastructure such as a refinery and an export pipeline
the government said last month that it now expects oil production to start in a year later than previously expected
muloni said the government also planned to do another licensing round for vacant blocks in but the number of blocks that would be auctioned has yet to be determined
muloni said uganda s gross crude reserves had also been revised downwards after new reservoir analyses to billion barrels from billion previously
recoverable reserves remained at billion barrels
ugandan fields also held billion cubic feet of natural gas she said
the oil firms are expected to spend between billion and billion to develop ugandan fields and the associated infrastructure and the east african country is banking on that investment and potential proceeds from crude exports of about barrels per day to drive growth
