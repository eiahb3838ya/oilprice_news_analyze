column-china's credit loosening may not do much for commodity demand: russell
launceston australia reuters china s commodity imports may get a shot in the arm from beijing s decision to ease credit conditions in the world s economy but it may not be as big a boost as followed prior monetary loosening
the people s bank of china on sunday announced a steep basis point cut in the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves matching a similar move in april
the easing of the reserve requirement ratios rrrs will inject a net billion yuan billion into the banking system making it easier for banks to extend credit
the loosening of monetary conditions appears to be aimed at shoring up confidence in china s economy which has been battered by the escalating trade war with the administration of president donald trump
there are signs that china s economy is feeling some pain from the tariff barriers being erected with equity prices struggling and certain indicators such as fixed asset investment trending weaker
in prior years relaxing credit conditions has resulted in much of the cash being used for infrastructure and housing construction thereby boosting demand for raw material such as iron ore steel and copper as well as thermal and coking coal for energy to process them
there is generally some expectation that the extra cash in the economy will flow through to additional spending on activity such as building railways and apartment buildings
but it s worth noting that april s lowering of the rrrs didn t really do much for the level of iron ore imports which have remained in a narrow band for much of the year and are down percent in the first eight months of the year compared with the same period in
coal imports have been stronger so far in but this is more likely a reflection of stronger demand for thermal power generation as well as robust steel output and production restrictions on the domestic industry
official trade data for september has yet to be released but data compiled by refinitiv suggests a pullback in seaborne coal imports in the month
china s seaborne coal imports were million tonnes in september the data showed down sharply from million tonnes in august and the weakest month since february last year
a drop in coal imports may not be too surprising given it s currently the shoulder season between the summer and winter power demand peaks and higher prices may also have caused some reluctance among chinese buyers
iron ore imports also tracked weaker in september but not by much with the refinitiv data estimating million tonnes down from august s million
iron ore imports this year have held in a remarkably steady range according to the data with march s million tonnes being the softest and may s million being the strongest
what the data suggests is that china s demand for iron ore hasn t been much affected by either the trade dispute with the united states or by earlier stimulus efforts
iron ore prices in china were also largely unmoved by the easing of credit with dalian commodity exchange futures opening slightly stronger after the national day holidays
the contract rose as high as yuan a tonne in early trade on monday up from a close of yuan on but by midday it was trading around yuan
this is perhaps recognition that any stimulus will take some time to work its way through the system and if there is any boost to commodity demand it will take several months to materialise
