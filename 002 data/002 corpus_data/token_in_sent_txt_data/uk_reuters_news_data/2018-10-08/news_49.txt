bioenergy leads growth in renewable energy consumption to 2023-iea
london reuters bioenergy from liquid biofuels and biogas will lead growth in renewable energy consumption to due to its rising use in the heating and transport sectors according to the international energy agency iea
overall renewable energy will continue to grow to accounting for percent of energy consumption growth as countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions to try and keep global warming in check
while growth in solar and wind power is set to continue in the electricity sector bioenergy will remain the largest source of renewable energy the iea said in an annual report on renewables
modern bioenergy is the overlooked giant of the renewable energy field said fatih birol the iea s executive director
its share in the world s total renewables consumption is about percent today in other words as much as hydro wind solar and all other renewables combined he added
modern bioenergy refers to liquid biofuels produced from pulpy residue from sugar other plants biogas and other technologies
traditional bioenergy refers to the burning of biomass such as wood animal waste and traditional charcoal
the share of renewable technologies meeting global energy demand is expected to increase by a fifth to percent in
china will lead global growth in renewable energy due to policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all sectors and lessen harmful air pollution and will surpass the european union as the largest consumer of renewable energy by the report said
of the world s largest energy consumers brazil will have the highest share of renewables by far almost percent of total final energy consumption in driven by a significant contribution of bioenergy and hydropower
globally solar photovoltaic capacity is forecast to expand by almost gigawatts gw to terrawatt by more than all other renewable energy technologies combined
wind energy will be the contributor to renewable capacity growth growing by percent but hydropower will remain the largest renewable electricity source by
