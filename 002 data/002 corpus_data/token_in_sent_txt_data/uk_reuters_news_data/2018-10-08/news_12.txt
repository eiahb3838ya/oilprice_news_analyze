rocked by trump's sanctions, iranian oil exports drop further
london reuters iran s crude exports fell further in the first week of october according to tanker data and an industry source taking a major hit from sanctions and throwing a challenge to other opec oil producers as they seek to cover the shortfall
the islamic republic exported million barrels per day bpd of crude in that period refinitiv eikon data showed
an industry source who also tracks exports said october shipments were so far below million bpd
that s down from at least million bpd in april before president donald trump in may withdrew the united states from a nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions
the figure also marks a further fall from million bpd in september
tanker schedules are often adjusted and exports can vary week by week
the early october figures add to signs however that iranian exports are falling more steeply than expected stretching the ability of saudi arabia russia and other producers to fill the gap
the government s tough stance raised the stakes for a more significant iran export loss than previously foreseen said norbert ruecker head of macro and commodity research at swiss bank julius baer
oil prices have extended a rally on expectations the sanctions will test the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other producers
brent crude on wednesday last week reached a barrel the highest since
none of the iranian crude exported in the first week of october is heading for europe according to the refinitiv data
the tankers are sailing to india china and the middle east
while washington has said it wants to cut iran s oil exports to zero iran and saudi arabia say that is unlikely
the trump administration is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports
india a major buyer has ordered iranian oil for november although new delhi does not yet know whether it will receive such a waiver
iran has questioned whether the market needs more oil and says its output is holding steady at about million bpd
iran has pledged to block any opec supply increase that the country deems to be against its interest
the market does not want a single barrel iran s representative on opec s board of governors hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters in late september
but figures opec compiles from secondary sources that include media and government agencies put output in august at million bpd down bpd from july
some of these sources say output fell further in september
iran may indeed have not cut production yet to match the rate of decline in its exports as the country appears to be storing more oil on ships as it did during sanctions that applied until the nuclear deal
