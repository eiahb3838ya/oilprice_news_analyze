update 2-u.n. warns world must take "unprecedented" steps to avert worst effects of global warming
report to guide governments on meeting paris targets report affirms meeting rise target better than exceeding rise would demand removing global sea level to rise less with a hike adds ipcc vice chair comments in paragraph by nina chestney and jane chung oct reuters society would have to enact unprecedented changes to how it consumes energy travels and builds to meet a lower global warming target or it risks increases in heat waves storms and the chances of drought in some regions as well as the loss of species a report said on monday
keeping the earth s temperature rise to only degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit rather than the target agreed to at the paris agreement talks in would have clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc said on monday in a statement announcing the report s release
the ipcc report said at the current rate of warming the world s temperatures would likely reach between and after an increase of above levels since the
keeping the target would keep the global sea level rise metre inches lower by than a target the report states
that could reduce flooding and give the people that inhabit the world s coasts islands and river deltas time to adapt to climate change
the lower target would also reduce species loss and extinction and the impact on terrestrial freshwater and coastal ecosystems the report said
there were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at and that came so clearly
even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at compared to thelma krug of the ipcc told reuters in an interview
and now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters krug said
the ipcc met last week in incheon south korea to finalise the report prepared at the request of governments in to assess the feasibility and importance of limiting global warming to
the report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the paris agreement during the katowice climate change conference in poland in december
to contain warming at global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about percent by from levels and reach net zero by
any additional emissions would require removing from the air
the report summary said renewable energy would need to supply percent to percent of electricity by to stay within a limit compared with about percent now
using carbon capture and storage ccs technology the share of power would need to be cut to percent and coal to under percent
there was no mention of oil in this context in the summary
if the average global temperature temporarily exceeded additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below by
but the report said the efficacy of measures such as planting forests bioenergy use or capturing and storing were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks
but the effects of not meeting the target would mean huge changes to the world
the lower level would mean the arctic ocean would be free of sea ice in summer only once per century not at least once a decade under the higher target
coral reefs would decline by a still unsustainable percent to percent instead of being virtually wiped out under the higher increase
the report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it said amjad abdulla the ipcc board member and chief negotiator for an alliance of small island states at risk of flooding as sea levels rise
