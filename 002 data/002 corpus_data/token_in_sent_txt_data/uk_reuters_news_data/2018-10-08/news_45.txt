temperatures to rise 1.5 degrees celsius by 2030-2052 without rapid steps - u.n. report
report to guide governments on meeting paris targets exceeding rise would demand removing global sea level to rise less with a hike by nina chestney and jane chung oct reuters temperatures are likely to rise by degrees celsius between and if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase a report said on monday
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc met last week in incheon south korea to finalise the report prepared at the request of governments in when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed
the report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the paris agreement
the paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below above levels while seeking to tighten the goal to
there has already been a rise of since the as industrialisation lifted emissions of carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change
a rise of would still carry risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of the report summary said
meeting the limit required rapid and unprecedented change in land and energy use industry buildings transport and cities it said adding temperatures would be higher between and at the current pace
the targets agreed in paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after it said
to contain warming at manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about percent by from levels and reach net zero by
any additional emissions would require removing from the air
limiting warming to is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes said jim skea of the ipcc working group which assesses climate change mitigation
the summary said renewable energy would need to supply to percent of electricity by to stay within a limit compared with about percent now
using carbon capture and storage ccs technology the share of power would need to be cut to percent and coal to between and percent
there was no mention of oil in this context in the summary
if the average global temperature temporarily exceeded additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below by
but the report said the efficacy of measures such as planting forests bioenergy use or capturing and storing were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks
steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology the report said
it said keeping the rise in temperature to would mean sea levels by would be cm lower than if the warming was the likelihood of an arctic ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade and coral reefs would decline by percent instead of being virtually wiped out
the report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it said amjad abdulla the ipcc board member and chief negotiator for the alliance of small island states
