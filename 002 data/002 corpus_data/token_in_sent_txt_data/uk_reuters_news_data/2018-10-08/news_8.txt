qatar airways considers fuel surcharge to help return to profit
doha oct reuters qatar airways may consider a fuel surcharge on tickets to help it return to profit amid a regional dispute and rising oil prices chief executive akbar told reuters on monday
qatar airways reported last month a million riyal million loss for the financial year ended march citing a political dispute that has seen it banned from four arab countries and has suggested it could make a loss again
saudi arabia the united arab emirates uae egypt and bahrain have all banned qatar airways since june as part of a dispute they have with the government of qatar
the airline has said it has mitigated the impact of the dispute by launching flights to new destinations increasing flights on existing routes and leasing aircraft to other airlines and now hopes to return to profit in the financial year
we hope we will be able to move to profitability in the current financial year even though the oil prices are rising said baker
to do this baker said the airline might consider a fuel surcharge similar to those applied by other airlines
carriers including cathay pacific and malaysia airlines have said this year they are adding a fuel surcharge to airfares as oil prices continue to rise
higher oil prices will put pressure on our bottom line but this is our business sometimes oil is higher said baker
