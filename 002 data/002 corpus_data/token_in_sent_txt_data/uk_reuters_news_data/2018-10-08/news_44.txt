feature-philippine resort city chooses 'morally correct' low-carbon path
puerto princesa philippines oct thomson reuters foundation w hen theresa walgraeve and her husband set up their resort in puerto princesa a city on the philippine island of palawan they worried about mosquitoes and monsoon damp and the high cost of electricity
that s when the island s zero carbon resorts programme approached them with suggestions on how to save energy and costs from solar panels and led lights to rainwater harvesting refillable bottles and bamboo roofs for extra cooling
the walgraeves enrolled in the programme made the changes and achieved significant savings theresa walgraeve said
they were not very big adjustments but we were able to cut our electricity and water use by a fair amount she said
many guests are also mindful and appreciate the fact that we are zero carbon
and we are happy that we make a difference to not just puerto princesa and palawan but also the in puerto princesa became the first southeast asian city to earn a zero carbon label meaning it produces no more emissions than it can offset according to an audit by environmental partnership seed and the manila observatory
in fact by preserving its forests using green building design and shunning the diesel that once powered generators in homes and hotels the city is carbon negative meaning it pulls more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits according to the audit
that makes it an outlier in the philippines
but it like other philippines cities has motivation to act the nation is one of those most severely hit by wild weather triggered by climate change with its coastal cities particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and deadly storms
a report by the world s leading climate scientists released monday gives a stark warning that such threats will continue to grow unless the world can hold hikes in global temperatures to degrees celsius just a half degree higher than today
around the world cities are at the frontline of the battle to curb emissions as urbanisation surges
more than of the world s population is forecast to live in cities by according to the united nations
cities consume also more than of the world s energy and account for about of carbon dioxide emissions according to the un
southeast asian cities are very vulnerable yet lagging behind in incorporating more renewable energy generation in their plans said rob roggema a professor and urban sustainability expert at the university of technology sydney
often it is the lack of political will that is the reason
but it can be done no matter how big or small the city with the participation of residents and the private sector he said
most cities around the world are already dealing with the effects of climate change from hotter and more humid summers to deadlier storms and frequent flooding
a growing number are taking action
leaders of some of the biggest cities recently vowed to make all buildings carbon neutral by
more than cities have pledged to become zero carbon by
admittedly puerto princesa is a smaller city with a population of people according to the census
but palawan island with its beaches and clear blue waters is seen as a green leader in the country
years ago the island was being ravaged by illegal logging and fishing and rampant mining said edward hagedorn who was elected mayor of puerto princesa in
hagedorn who hailed from a family of loggers vowed in his victory speech to make the city clean and green and protect its natural resources
in two decades as mayor after upending term limits hagedorn clamped down on commercial logging and mining and introduced electric tricycles
he also pushed the tourism industry towards more sustainable practices to draw more responsible visitors to its attractions which include a subterranean river named in as one of the new wonders of the world
that shift has helped replace jobs lost in mining and logging he said
i had seen firsthand the destruction caused by rampant logging fishing and mining hagedorn said
when i won the election i had an epiphany i wanted to show that economic development is possible without destroying the environment
a low carbon pathway is the morally correct one he told the thomson reuters foundation
at his urging palawan passed a strategic environmental plan in
it declares the state must protect develop and conserve its natural resources and enhance the environment while pursuing goals
the palawan council for sustainable development was set up to oversee this goal
one of its key actions was launching the zero carbon resorts programme in with funding from the european union
while member resorts did not receive financial assistance they could request an audit and were advised on how to make improvements to increase energy efficiency said adelinea who leads the project
lessons from the experience now have been incorporated into a zero carbon and green building policy for palawan passed last month
we are an island so we are particularly vulnerable to climate change impact said
the measures we introduced in the tourism sector renewable energy sources use of local materials and green technologies are being extended to other sectors as the push for zero carbon has had mixed results worldwide
while some cities have made significant progress in reducing emissions there have also been some notable failures
masdar city in abu dhabi touted as the world s first city remains behind schedule and sparsely populated
south korea s songdo billed as the world s greenest city also has faced challenges meeting its aims
cities in the philippines have struggled too
the capital manila and popular tourist destinations including cebu are battling choked streets and rising pollution
president rodrigo duterte earlier this year called boracay island a popular resort a cesspool and ordered its closure for six months warning of a looming environmental disaster
in contrast puerto princesa s popularity as a favoured destination for tourism has steadily grown with more than visitors last year compared to in said frances victorio who worked on the greenhouse gas audit in
today puerto princesa has the largest forest area in the philippines at percent and boasts one of the healthiest coral reefs said victorio a former chief of the philippine climate change commission
the city will most probably remain until at least according to the audit when population growth and vehicle emissions threaten to outpace efforts to cut emissions
still it s a good example of what can be achieved if people put their heads together and work for a common goal victorio said
we had good leadership and everyone was ready to pitch in for the greater good of clean air and clean water for us our children and our reporting by rina chandran rinachandran
