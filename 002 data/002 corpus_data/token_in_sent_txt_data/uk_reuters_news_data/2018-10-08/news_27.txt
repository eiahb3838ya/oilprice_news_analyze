norway to spend more on looking for oil and gas near russian border
oslo oct reuters norway plans to step up spending on looking for oil and gas in the northern barents sea close to its border with russia the country s budget showed on monday
the government has proposed to allocate an extra million norwegian crowns million to conduct a survey over a large geographical structure that straddles the border with russia
knowledge is crucial both for good resource management and for safeguarding national economic interests norway s oil and energy minister freiberg said in a statement
the country s oil and energy ministry did not identify the structure but said it was located in an area which is not yet opened up for petroleum exploration and development
a reuters source familiar with the decision said the areas the government wanted to take a close look at were opposite exploration blocks awarded by russia on the other side of the border

norway s oil company equinor previously called statoil had plans to drill with rosneft in one of the blocks known as perseyevsky
but western sanctions imposed on moscow after russia seized crimea from ukraine in have ended such plans
oslo and moscow did a deal in to end a dispute over their maritime border which included oil and gas exploration
but since russia s annexation of crimea norwegian officials have expressed concern about russian military exercises in the region
norway also fears that tensions between russia and the west could have implications for svalbard which belongs to norway but has become significant because of growing interest in arctic oil and norwegian petroleum directorate said last year the area bordering russia southeast of the arctic archipelago of svalbard which is not yet opened up for exploration could hold billion barrels of oil equivalents
the directorate which has previously conducted surveys and drilled shallow wells to collect sediment samples said there were a few large structures straddling the border with russia including sentralbanken high
