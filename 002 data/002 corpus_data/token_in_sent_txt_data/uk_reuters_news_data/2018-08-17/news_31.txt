pressure mounts on trump to deliver for iowa ahead of elections
des moines iowa reuters warren bachman a iowa soybean farmer is one of many who turned clarke county into donald trump country as the republican president took percent of the votes in in a county that went for democrat barack obama four years earlier
but bachman s loyalty to trump is wavering under the weight of a trade war that has disproportionately hurt farmers due to big tariffs on agricultural exports
other farmers meanwhile are upset that the white house has not yet followed through on a promise to reform rules that would boost demand for ethanol one of the state s biggest businesses
i still support him but not as much bachman said between bites of pork chops and baked beans at the iowa state fair in des moines last week
i am afraid we are close to seeing a repeat of the where farmers across iowa lost their land because they ran out of money and couldn t get november s congressional elections represent the first nationwide response to trump s aggressive trade policies particularly in the farm belt which runs roughly from indiana to kansas and the dakotas which favoured trump heavily two years ago
the administration s move to impose numerous tariffs on imports has sparked retaliation particularly from top agricultural buyer china which put levies on products like hogs corn and soybeans hammering those markets
soybeans are among the with prices down percent since may
the united states exported billion in agriculture products in including billion in soybeans according to the department of agriculture
farmers say they are growing impatient as harvest season approaches
trump is more popular in the farm belt than in the nation overall but his support there has dipped from percent approval in to percent in early august according to polling
trump won iowa by percentage points in after obama carried the state twice
for a graphic on how trump farm belt approval rating has fallen with soybean and hog prices see the anxiety is starting to escalate said iowa governor kim reynolds a republican locked in a tight race with democrat fred hubbell
they are willing to give him some more time but the window is closing and they have to see some movement somewhere to alleviate the bachman said he is a registered republican but has not decided whether to vote for reynolds in november saying he will pull the lever for whoever will best protect the state s agricultural industry
he said the tariffs on imported metals have increased the costs for farming equipment but that he had saved money for a down cycle
but his wife linda bachman who supported hillary clinton in said her husband is too proud to acknowledge the burden on their family including their son who is just starting out as a farmer
he s stressed out
i see it every day and we are worried about our son she said
democrats are hoping to pick up two congressional seats in iowa as part of their quest to win the house of representatives they need to win a net seats to regain control of the chamber
the president is using iowa farmers and its families as poker chips in a trade war said abby finkenauer a democrat running against republican incumbent rod blum in a race for a house seat in eastern iowa that forecasters rate a
blum has been a staunch trump supporter in a region that generally leans to democrats in presidential elections but which flipped to trump in
last month in iowa blum publicly thanked trump for his trade stance
you ve taken some heat for it in the but in the long run the farmers the manufacturers the employers are all going to be better off said blum who did not respond to interview requests
the administration last month announced billion in aid for farmers hurt by tariffs
finkenauer however said the state needs someone to stand up to the president not pat him on the back
china s tariffs are a direct hit to iowa the nation s top exporter of corn and pork and no
exporter of soybeans behind illinois
iowa exported nearly billion in agricultural goods in trailing only california according to usda data
china is the world s biggest importer of soybeans and among the largest pork buyers
but iowa farmers are also getting hit by levies imposed by mexico the leading importer of pork
dean hamblin owns a farm in buchanan county which also flipped to trump from obama
in an august town hall event he urged republican senator joni ernst to push the president to act quickly
we can t wait for a year to settle this tariff business
if we lose those markets they will be gone forever hamblin told ernst who agreed
prices for lean hog futures have fallen percent since may
ernst noted farmers are throwing away pigs heads for the first time because the tariffs wiped out the market for them
hog parts such as feet tongue and heads are shunned by most americans but are considered a delicacy in china and iowa farmers had profited handsomely by exporting those products
trump s energy policies also factor in to the election outlook
iowa is the top producer of ethanol it produced million barrels in a quarter of the nation s total according to the energy department and as such federal policy regarding this biofuel is a sensitive topic in the state
refiners are required by law to blend billion gallons of biofuels yearly into the fuel supply but the government has not increased that level for several years causing domestic ethanol demand to flatline
to increase demand farmers have asked washington to rescind a ban on selling a gasoline with higher levels of ethanol in the summer
that has not happened yet
instead over the last year the industry has become embroiled in a related dispute with washington
the white house has become more aggressive than the obama administration in granting numerous requests from refiners seeking relief from having to blend or pay for the cost of adding biofuels to the nation s fuel supply
that undercuts demand for ethanol farmers say
last month trump attempted to mollify the corn industry telling a roomful of iowa farmers that he was close to lifting the ban drawing cheers in the state and surprise in washington from those unaware of the plans
trump in recent weeks has told agriculture secretary sonny perdue and others to strike a deal with the oil industry that will lift the ban according to three sources briefed on the meetings
oil companies have opposed these efforts
the goal was to get something done in august to help embattled incumbents like blum
but summer is nearly over and farmers have not seen the relief they expected
we are sick of the runaround on the said kevin ross an iowa farmer from pottawattamie county which trump won with percent of the vote
this is something that has gone on way too reporting by jarrett renshaw in des moines iowa editing by david gaffen and matthew lewis
