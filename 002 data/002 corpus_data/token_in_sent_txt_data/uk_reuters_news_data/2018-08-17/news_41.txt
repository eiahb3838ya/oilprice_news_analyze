update 3-u.s. secretary of state names brian hook special envoy for iran
washington reuters secretary of state mike pompeo on thursday named senior policy adviser brian hook as washington s special representative for iran
the move came as the trump administration prepared to increase economic pressure on iran by restoring sanctions to force tehran to end its nuclear weapons program and support for militant groups in the middle east
hook will lead a newly established iran action group to coordinate the state department s pressure campaign on iran pompeo told a news conference
the announcement was not a surprise
hook who has pushed for tough action against iran has been leading the department s talks with allies in europe and asia to persuade them to support sanctions and cut off iran s oil supplies as of november
the iran action group will be responsible for directing reviewing and coordinating all aspects of the state department s activity and will report directly to me pompeo said
we are committed to a effort to change the iranian regime s behavior and the iran action group will ensure that the department of state remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners he added
president donald trump announced in may the united states was withdrawing from an iran nuclear deal sealed in between tehran and six world powers
the united states has said it would only end the sanctions if iran allowed the negotiation of a tougher deal
hook who was a close adviser to former secretary of state rex tillerson worked with national security advisor john bolton on iran sanctions while bolton was the
ambassador to the united nations under republican president george bush
hook also served as an assistant secretary of state during bush s administration and was an adviser to the republican presidential campaigns of mitt romney and tim pawlenty
trump has said he would be willing to meet iranian president hassan rouhani although tehran said the way back to talks was for the united states to return to the nuclear deal
asked whether he supported such a meeting and whether his brief would be to set up those talks hook said if iran showed that it was willing to change its behavior then trump was prepared to engage in dialogue in order to find washington aims to force tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in the middle east where iran is involved in proxy wars from yemen to syria
iran and other signatories including britain france germany russia and china have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement even as the united states has started reimposing some sanctions on iran
dennis ross a former official in democratic and republican administrations said hook s new post might be a bureaucratic maneuver to try to inject more clarity into washington s policy toward tehran
it creates an address within the administration for making the approach a more coherent one with someone being given broader responsibility across departments to try to shape the policy said ross now a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy think tank
at least that would be the real question is is the policy going to continue to be just basically strong tough rhetoric and sanctions or is it going to be something more to curtail what washington sees as iran s destabilizing actions in syria yemen and iraq he added
