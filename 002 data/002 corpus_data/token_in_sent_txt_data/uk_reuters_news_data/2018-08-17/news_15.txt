update 3-denmark's maersk to spin off drilling, hand total shares to investors
copenhagen reuters
said on friday it would spin off its offshore drilling operation and list it in copenhagen next year the latest move by the danish shipping company to focus entirely on transport and logistics
maersk which cut its profit outlook this month sold maersk oil to french oil major total last year in a billion deal as part of a restructuring under soren skou who became chief executive in
skou used to head maersk s container business and is a veteran of the danish firm whose mainstay industry is emerging from a fierce price war as too many ships chased too little business denting profitability
however a rise in freight rates combined with ballooning bunker fuel costs have triggered recent profit warnings from maersk and rival
skou said on friday that the development in freight rates had been positive and that the company had regained control of its costs in the second quarter after a rise linked to its acquisition of hamburg sud shipping line
but maersk said that its profitability had been hit by an almost percent spike in the price of bunker fuel which is used to power its ships
by divesting its oil and gas business maersk can no longer use oil as a hedge against downturns in the container market although it said it was looking at a recovery for the remainder of the year driven by lower costs and higher freight rates
maersk said that following the demerger of maersk drilling in which the maersk family s holding company will retain a significant stake a material part of its remaining shares in france s total which it acquired as part of the oil unit sale will be distributed to shareholders
in march maersk took a percent stake or million shares in total
it sold stock worth billion in july leaving it with million total shares
shares in maersk were up percent at gmt while total was little changed
prospects maersk said it had evaluated different options for maersk drilling and decided that it offered the best prospects for shareholders as a company
an outright sale of maersk drilling has been made difficult by an oversupplied drilling rig market which has not yet recovered despite a recent gain in oil prices
maersk has not publicly put a price tag on the drilling division but analysts have previously valued it at around billion
it reported a percent increase in ebitda to million while sales grew around percent in the quarter to million
the would release cash proceeds of around billion maersk said which fearnley analysts said was above the billion expected by the market
the danish firm also said it had secured debt financing of billion from a consortium of international banks to ensure a strong capital structure after a listing
moody s and standard and poor s both cut maersk s credit rating to close to the lowest investment grade levels in and the company has vowed to do whatever it takes to protect its rating
fearnley s analysts said maersk s plans to hand over shares in total to its investors improved its dividend prospects
the distribution of total shares supports our view of an extraordinary dividend potential of around percent in both they said
maersk confirmed its preliminary earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda of million
