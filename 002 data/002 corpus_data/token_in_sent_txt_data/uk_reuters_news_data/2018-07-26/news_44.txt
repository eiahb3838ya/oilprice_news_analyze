toyota plans to expand production, shrink cost of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
toyota city reuters toyota motor corp is doubling down on its investment in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles designing passenger cars and suvs and pushing the technology into buses and trucks to build economies of scale
as toyota cranks up improvements for the next generation of its mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fcv expected in the early it is hoping it can prove wrong rival automakers and industry experts who have mostly dismissed such plans as commercially unviable
the maker of the prius the world s first car in the says it can popularize fcvs in part by making them cheaper
we re going to shift from limited production to mass production reduce the amount of expensive materials like platinum used in fcv components and make the system more compact and powerful yoshikazu tanaka chief engineer of the mirai said in an interview with reuters
it is planning a phased introduction of other fcv models including a range of suvs trucks and commercial trucks beginning around a source with knowledge of the automaker s plans said
the automaker declined to comment on specific future product plans
but it has developed fcv prototypes of small delivery vehicles and large transport trucks based on models already on the road as tesla inc develops a commercial from the ground up
we re going to use as many parts from existing passenger cars and other models as possible in fuel cell trucks said ikuo ota manager of new business planning for fuel cell projects at toyota
otherwise we won t see the benefits of mass the company is also betting on improved performance
toyota wants to push the driving range of the next mirai to kilometers from around kilometers and to hit kilometers by a separate source said
driven by the belief that hydrogen will become a key source of clean energy in the next years toyota has been developing fcvs since the early
hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and stores more energy than a battery of equivalent weight
the mirai was the world s first production fcv when it was launched in
but its high cost around before government incentives and lack of refueling infrastructure have limited its appeal
fewer than have been sold globally
lmc automotive forecasts fcvs to make up only percent of global passenger car sales in compared with percent for battery evs
the international energy agency predicts fewer fcvs than and hybrid electric vehicles through
many automakers including nissan motor co and tesla see cars as a better solution to gasoline engines
only a handful including honda motor co and hyundai motor co produce fcvs
but people familiar with toyota s plans said the automaker thinks demand will perk up as more countries including china warm to fuel cell technology
the company also sees fcvs as a hedge against a scarcity of key ev battery materials such as cobalt
for now mirais are assembled by hand at a plant in toyota city where technicians push partially constructed units into assembly bays for detailed inspections
this process yields just cars a day a sliver of toyota s average domestic daily production of about vehicles
strategic analysis inc which has analyzed costs of fcvs including the mirai estimates that it costs toyota about to produce each of its fuel cell stacks by far the vehicles most expensive part
toyota has been building up production capacity to change that as it expects global fcv sales climb to units annually after from about
strategic analysis estimates that would allow toyota to reduce costs to about per stack
it has already begun to use parts developed for the mirai in other models such as the fuel cell stack which is used in kenworth freight trucks being tested in california the sora fc bus it released in japan in march and the delivery trucks it will test with stores in japan next year
it will be difficult for toyota to lower fcv production costs if it only produces the mirai the first source told reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue
by using the fcv system in larger models it is looking to lower costs by and using common parts across vehicle classes he added
the mirai s high production costs are largely due to expensive materials including platinum titanium and carbon fiber used in the fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems
engineers have been reducing that by improving the platinum catalyst a key component in the layered cells in the fuel cell stack which facilitates the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces electricity
we ve been able to decrease the platinum loading by percent to percent and deliver the same performance said eri ichikawa a fuel cell engineer at cataler corp a toyota subsidiary that specializes in catalytic converters
strategic analysis says using that much less of the precious metal would save up to per fuel cell stack based on an estimate that toyota now uses about grams of platinum per unit
by consistently focusing on these issues we will be able to progressively lower the cost of fcvs in the future tanaka said
