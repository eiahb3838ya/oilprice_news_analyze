factbox-risks to middle east oil and gas shipping routes
dubai july reuters saudi arabia said on thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the red sea after yemen s houthis attacked two crude tankers underscoring risks caused by the conflict in the world s top oil exporting region
iran in its row with the united states over sanctions has also threatened to block the strait of hormuz the other major strategic shipping route for oil from the region and the main route for iranian crude exports
below are facts about region s shipping routes bab any move to block the bab the narrow waterway between the coasts of yemen and africa at the southern end of the red sea would virtually halt oil shipments through egypt s suez canal or the sumed crude pipeline that link the red sea and mediterranean
the sumed pipeline with capacity for million bpd runs roughly parallel to the suez canal and can be used by oil tankers that can not navigate the canal waterway
an estimated million barrels per day bpd of crude oil and refined petroleum products flowed through the strait in to europe the united states and asia according to the energy information administration eia
reuters data shows saudi crude exports through bab which is about miles km wide at its narrowest point between djibouti s coast and the yemeni mainland are estimated to be bpd
closing the strait which has a shipping channel just two miles km wide would force oil and liquefied natural gas lng tankers around the southern tip of africa extending the distance for a vessel travelling between saudi arabia and the united states by miles km
this would add weeks to the journey time and extra costs although saudi arabia could export its crude along that route on vessels
about million bpd of oil or more than percent of seaborne traded crude was transported in through the strait of hormuz making the waterway at the southern end of the gulf the most important oil transit channel in the world according to eia figures
the strait which is about miles km wide at its narrowest point separates the arabian peninsula from iran
most of the crude exported from saudi arabia iran the united arab emirates kuwait and iraq must slip through a four mile km wide channel between the omani and iranian coasts
more than percent of the crude oil that moves through it is sent to asia mainly japan india south korea and china
in addition lng tankers from qatar the world s biggest lng exporter pass through the strait
the fifth fleet based in bahrain and responsible for an area that includes the gulf red sea gulf of oman and parts of the indian ocean has said it would not allow any disruption of traffic through the strait
saudi arabia and the uae have pipelines that can transport their crude without passing through the strait
the uae can ship crude from it indian ocean coastline while saudi arabia s alternative route runs to its red sea port of yanbu
most oil exports from saudi arabia the world s biggest crude exporter which produces about million bpd are transported by ship through the strait of hormuz
in addition the pipeline known as petroline mainly transports crude from the kingdom s eastern fields to yanbu which lies north of bab so shipments could avoid that red sea shipping chokepoint
the petroline has capacity to transport about million bpd of the kingdom s oil exports that can reach million bpd
saudi arabia has a parallel bpd natural gas liquids ngl pipeline linking gas processing plants in the east with ngl export facilities at yanbu
it also provides only a partial alternative to saudi shipments of ngl from the gulf
state oil giant saudi aramco plans to launch its overhauled muajjiz oil terminal on the red sea this year lifting its total loading and export capacity to as much as million bpd
located on the red sea muajjiz had been used as an export terminal for iraqi crude through the iraqi pipeline in saudi arabia ipsa but it has not carried iraqi crude since saddam hussein invaded kuwait in
other opec members in the region iran the uae kuwait and qatar rely almost entirely on the strait of hormuz
a kuwaiti official said percent of kuwaiti oil shipments go to asia and do not pass through bab
the remaining percent of its shipments passing through the red sea chokepoint were mostly refined products
the uae has built a new pipeline the abu dhabi crude oil pipeline with a capacity of million bpd to carry the bulk of its production to fujairah a bunkering hub and oil terminal on the indian ocean bypassing the strait of hormuz
qatar a small crude exporter shipped about trillion cubic feet tcf per year of lng through the strait of hormuz in according to bp statistics
nearly percent of iraq s crude is exported through gulf ports and through the strait of hormuz
most of it heads to asia
iran s total reliance on crude exports through the strait of hormuz is one of the reasons why it is unlikely to be blocked
