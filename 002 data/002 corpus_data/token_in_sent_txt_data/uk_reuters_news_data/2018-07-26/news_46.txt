london july reuters europe looks set to install gigawatts gw of new wind power capacity this year slightly lower than last year s record of gw according to estimates by industry group windeurope
in the first half of this year europe installed gw of onshore wind mainly in germany france and denmark
a further gw of new offshore wind capacity was also added mainly in britain belgium and denmark
for the whole of the year gw of new onshore wind and gw of new offshore wind is expected
we are on track for a solid year in new wind farm installations but the growth is driven by just a handful of markets windeurope s chief policy officer pierre tardieu said in a statement
windeurope expects a drop in france s new installations because of administrative issues which have resulted in the country s latest auction being
in offshore wind europe is too dependent on the uk which is striding ahead in current installations and in committing to future volumes tardieu said
by contrast the rate of new installations has slowed down in germany
other countries also need to beef up and speed up their plans on offshore wind he added
the new german government has also been slow to reveal when gw of new onshore wind promised for will be auctioned and to confirm auction volumes beyond that
