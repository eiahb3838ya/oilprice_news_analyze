exclusive-india's hpcl cancels iran oil shipment after insurer excludes coverage  - sources
new delhi reuters india s hindustan petroleum corp hpcl cancelled the purchase of an iranian oil cargo earlier this month after its insurance company refused to provide coverage for the crude because of sanctions three sources with knowledge of the matter said
hpcl india s refiner renewed its installation insurance which protects against any accidents at its refinery or storage sites in early july
however the new policy would not protect against any incidents involving iranian oil processed or stored at its refineries the sources said
the refiner had planned to load million barrels of iranian crude onto the suezmax tanker ankaleshwar in early july but cancelled the purchase after it was unable to sell it on to another buyer said the sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter
india is the buyer of iranian crude after china and without insurance coverage to protect their plants the country s refineries may have to cut off their imports earlier than anticipated
the united states said in may it plans to some sanctions against iran starting in august with full sanctions in place by november after withdrawing from a accord with iran limiting its nuclear programme
hpcl faced problems in lifting cargo from iran because its annual insurance policy was renewed in july after the pulled out of the nuclear deal in may said one of the sources adding the company will not be able to lift any iranian oil
hpcl s iranian imports account for only barrels per day bpd of its full demand of bpd but other indian refiners that take larger volumes are likely to face the same problem if their annual policy is up for renewal before november
hpcl did not respond to requests from reuters for a comment
companies have until to fully wind down activities with iran or risk exclusion from the financial system
however banks shipping firms and insurance companies are already cutting ties with iran and without financing or insurance coverage refiners will have to halt their purchases
iran had hoped to sell more than bpd of oil to india during the current fiscal year that started in april oil minister bijan zanganeh said in february
however the insurance issues may mean a reduction in imports even as india is intent on continuing dealings with iran
the problem in procuring iranian barrels appears to be happening much before the deadline said senthil kumaran a senior analyst at consultants fge
most of the reinsurance market is based in the so without the blessing of the iranian oil buyers will find it almost impossible to take and process iranian indian insurers rely on general insurance corp for reinsurance which depends on western to hedge its risk
general insurance did not reply to a request for comment
