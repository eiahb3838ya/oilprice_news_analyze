graphic india coal imports by source by clyde russell launceston australia july reuters india s coal imports appear to have surged in july and may even come close to a monthly record as it grapples with domestic transport woes and rising demand for electricity
coal imports are on track to reach million tonnes in july according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts
the data was filtered to include only cargoes that have already unloaded are awaiting or currently discharging or are expected to arrive before the end of the month
the final figure for july may be adjusted but it s likely that the month will be near the previous record of million tonnes from july or top the figure of million from june
the rising imports come even as coal prices surge on the back of strong demand from china the world s biggest importer and other asian countries including japan
imports for the first seven months of the year are likely to be around million tonnes up percent from the same period a year earlier according to the data
india is likely to be a reluctant buyer of imported coal given the country tends to cut back on overseas purchases in times of high prices
prices for thermal coal used in power generation have scaled peaks so far in with the australian benchmark weekly newcastle index hitting in the week to july the highest since september and up percent since the end of last year
however australia isn t a major supplier of thermal coal to india with the bulk of its exports to the south asian nation being coking coal
india s main supplier of thermal coal is indonesia where prices have also been rising but perhaps not quite so dramatically as for the australian grades
indonesian coal with a calorific value of kilocalories per kilogram as assessed by argus media ended at per tonne in the week to july having dropped for the past four weeks to be up only percent since the end of last year
it s also down from its peak so far in of a tonne hit in late february although it is also well above the trough of from the week to apr

what the prices show is that indonesian coal has underperformed australian coal meaning that it should be enjoying a relative advantage in a buyer such as india
but the data isn t showing this with imports from indonesia weakening in june and july
july s total is likely to be around million tonnes down from june s million and million in may which was the best month since december last year
in contrast coal shipments from australia to india have been moving sharply higher with million tonnes likely to have arrived in july the strongest month since shipping data started in
of course the bulk of this will still be coking coal used to make steel but looking at the breakdown of the vessels and it appears at least some cargoes were thermal coal
the other winner is india s supplier south africa with imports rising to around million tonnes in july also a record
south africa s exports are thermal coal and are of a higher calorific value than the bulk of shipments from indonesia
this shows that indian utilities are prepared to pay more for coal which may be a sign that they are seeking to maximise the efficiency of their boilers or are concerned about minimising the amount of pollution per unit of electricity generated
it also seems likely that coal imports may remain elevated for at least the coming months given the difficulties being experienced by producer coal india in securing rail transportation
however as the import bill surges it s also likely that political heat will be turned up on coal india given it s the policy of prime minister narendra modi s government to produce enough coal domestically to cut imports to zero
