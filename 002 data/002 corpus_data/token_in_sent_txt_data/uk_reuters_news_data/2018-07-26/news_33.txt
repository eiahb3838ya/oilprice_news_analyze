update 2-laos scrambles for food, medicines, coffins three days after dam burst
khokong laos reuters troops searched for survivors in the remote southern tip of laos on thursday three days after the collapse of a hydropower dam sent a torrent of water charging across paddy fields and through villages as rescuers rushed aid to thousands of homeless
the scale of the disaster was still unclear in part because of the inaccessibility of the area but also because reports from the communist country s state media have been scant and sketchy
for graphic on map locating the collapsed dam in laos click the official laos news agency said that people were confirmed dead and were missing following the failure of the dam on monday a subsidiary structure under construction as part of a hydroelectric project in the province of attapeu
earlier reports had suggested the death toll would be much higher and on wednesday the vientiane times had said more than people were waiting to be rescued from swirling floodwaters many of them on trees and the rooftops of submerged houses
in the village of khokong a sea of mud oozed around the stilt houses that were still standing and dead animals floated in the water
seven villages were hit two very badly
there were houses and only about are left standing said a medical official who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media
we retrieved one body today
i suspect there will be more as the water goes down and the road becomes easier to he said villagers were warned about three to four hours before the dam burst but few had expected the water to rise as high as it did
the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said roads and bridges were damaged and boat and helicopter were the only means of transport in the areas
schools in safe areas were being used as evacuation centres and about families needed tents for shelter it said
on a road to the small town of sanamxai reuters saw trucks carrying aid including fresh water and blankets for those made homeless
the government put their number at
phra ajan thanakorn a buddhist monk returning from sanamxai said he had delivered food and medicine in four trucks that had come from vientiane the capital some km miles to the north and he was heading back there to load up with more
the situation is really bad he told reuters
all the relief efforts are at sanamxai
there are volunteers distributing food and medicine for survivors every day there
they are still lacking food medicine and rescue and relief teams from around asia have headed into attapeu a largely agricultural province that borders vietnam to the east and cambodia to the south
laos one of asia s poorest countries has ambitions to become the battery of asia through the construction of multiple dams
its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build the dams under commercial concessions that involve the export of electricity to more developed neighbours including thailand
laos has finished building dams says thai group terra with more under construction and dozens planned
rights groups have repeatedly warned against the human and environmental cost of the dam drive including damage to the already fragile ecosystem of the region s rivers
the dam that collapsed was part of the billion billion power project which involves laotian thai and south korean firms
known as saddle dam d it was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams
the project s main partner south korea s sk engineering construction said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the laos government to help rescue villagers
the firm blamed the collapse on heavy rain
laos and its neighbours are in the middle of the monsoon season that brings tropical storms and heavy downpours
in cambodia s northern strung treng province nearly families that were also affected by the flooding from the dam in laos were moved to higher ground
these people will be affected for about seven to days and once all the water flows into the mekong we will be fine said keo vy a spokesman for the national centre for disaster management
an official at sk engineering construction said fractures were discovered on the dam on sunday and the company ordered the evacuation of villages as soon as the danger became clear
laotian minister of energy and mines khammany inthirath told a news conference in the capital that the company could not deny responsibility for the destruction of livelihoods and property
the vientiane times cited him as saying that all compensation would be borne by the project developer percent
