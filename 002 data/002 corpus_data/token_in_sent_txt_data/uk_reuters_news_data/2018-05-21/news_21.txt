bulgaria open to russian role in nuclear power project
moscow may reuters bulgaria is reviving plans to develop its belene nuclear power plant and is open to russian participation in the project bulgarian president rumen radev said on monday after talks with russian prime minister dmitry medvedev in moscow
bulgaria cancelled the megawatt plant in after failing to find investors
it had also faced pressure from washington and brussels to limit its energy dependence on russia which was under contract to build the plant
the bulgarian government decided last week to ask parliament to lift a ban on the development of the nuclear project
there are already announcements for the revival of the belene nuclear project which supposes russian participation as well radev told reporters on monday after meeting medvedev
bulgaria had to pay more than million euros million to russian state nuclear company rosatom for cancelling the belene project but also received nuclear parts for two megawatt reactors
as a result the country has to decide what to do with the equipment
separately radev also said he hoped that talks for direct russian gas deliveries to bulgaria could be resumed
the prime minister and government hold most power in bulgaria and the president has a largely ceremonial role but he can shape public opinion appoint ambassadors and veto legislation
