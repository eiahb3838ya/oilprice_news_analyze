ukraine likely to need fresh imf support in coming years - iif
london reuters ukraine is likely to need a new imf bailout programme in the coming years to plug an up to billion hole in its finances the institute of international finance has warned
ukraine is hoping to get a billion tranche from its current imf package in the next three to six months but new analysis from the iif on monday laid out the country s precarious picture
real exports are now roughly half the level they were in economic growth is a better but not stellar percent a year and its energy import bill is rising in tandem with global oil and gas prices
it s the country s external finances that pose the biggest risk though the iif said
for kiev to remain comfortable next year bond market lenders will have to rollover percent of their loans to the country
however if that rollover rate stayed at last year s percent level the government would face a billion funding gap and one of billion if rate dropped down to percent
unless capital inflows pick up substantially ukraine will likely need fresh imf support in coming years to meet its needs the iif analysis said
the cumulative financing gap for could reach billion or percent of international reserves in a low rollover rate ukraine s current imf programme is due to finish next year
the country has so far received billion of what was originally supposed to be billion of aid
its overall amount of debt has fallen and its reserves have more than doubled during the programme but both are projected to reverse these moves as it comes to an end
between now and it has billion of imf and other official sector debt payments due
the government s revenues will also be squeezed the iif said as new gas pipes allow russia to pump its gas around ukraine rather than through it meaning it will no longer have to pay transit fees
