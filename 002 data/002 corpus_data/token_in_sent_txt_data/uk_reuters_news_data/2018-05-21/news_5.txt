turkey's erdogan says nuclear-armed states "threatening the world"
ankara reuters turkish president tayyip erdogan on monday accused countries with nuclear weapons of threatening the world and criticised the united states s withdrawal from the nuclear deal with iran
those who have more than nuclear warheads are currently threatening the world he said referring to the approximate total number of warheads worldwide most of which are held by the united states and russia
apparently referring to such states as iran he added why are countries with nuclear warheads posing a threat to them if we are to be fair to show a just approach then the countries with nuclear weapons which portray nuclear power stations as threats have no credibility in the international community he said at an iftar dinner for the muslim holy month of ramadan
erdogan said the middle east had to be cleansed of all nuclear weapons in an apparent reference to israel believed to be the only nation in the region to possess them
president donald trump withdrew the united states days ago from the deal between tehran and six major powers which limited iran s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions
trump ordered that sanctions be reimposed
earlier on monday secretary of state mike pompeo demanded iran take additional steps such as pulling out of the syrian civil war
iran dismissed washington s ultimatum and a senior iranian official said it showed the united states was seeking regime change in iran
the withdrawal from the nuclear deal comes as relations between nato member turkey and washington have soured over a host of issues ranging from policy in syria to trump s decision to move the embassy in israel to jerusalem
france germany and britain have said they will try to save the nuclear deal with tehran
as turkey we do not accept issues including the iran nuclear deal that have been put to bed
we find the other signatories stating their loyalty to the agreement in the face of the administration s decision very positive erdogan said
